Abstract
In the high energy environment of the Large Hadron Collider, there is a finite probability
for the longitudinal tail of the hadronic shower represented by a jet to leak out of the
calorimeter, commonly referred to as longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, or jet punch-
through. This thesis prescribes a method for identifying such punch-through jets via
the use of muon activity found behind a jet in the ATLAS muon spectrometer, finding an
occurance rate of up to 18% in the worst aected regions. Punch-through jets were found
to degrade the measured jet energy scale by up to 30%, and jet energy resolution by a factor
of 3. A correction to remove these eects was developed in Monte Carlo and validated in
data, with associated systematic uncertainties derived. The correction was found to negate
the degredation of the measured jet energy scale, improving the jet energy resolution by up
to 10% in the worst aected regions, and up to 1.6% overall. The correction was integrated
into the final 2012 ATLAS jet energy calibration scheme as the fifth step of the Global
Sequential corrections. The prescription developed in this thesis to derive the correction is
currently being used by ATLAS in Run II of the Large Hadron Collider.

I have received help from many people during the course of my DPhil that have made this
thesis possible. First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Cigdem Issever, who
provided me with valuable feedback, support and guidance throughout my DPhil, without
which this thesis would not have been possible.
From the ATLAS JetEtMiss group, Caterina Doglioni gave me much help when starting
to work on jet punch-through and also whilst performing studies for the Dijet Mass Reson-
ances analysis. Steven Schramm provided helpful insight during meetings when developing
the jet punch-through correction. Integration of the correction into the Global Sequential
framework was made possible through long Skype chats with Santiago Batista, whom to-
gether with Reina Camacho Toro and Joe Taenzer formed a great team that I had the
pleasure of working with when producing the Global Sequential CONF note.

Preface
The work in this thesis was done as part of the ATLAS collaborations jet and missing
transverse momentum group, and as a result was dependent on the work of thousands of
other scientists that helped to design, construct and run the detector. The author of this
thesis was the sole analyser for all studies, producing all figures aside from the top-left and
top-right plots in Figure 2.7, in the Appendices and the following chapters:
Chapter 4. The author performed studies that, coupled with the studies in Appendices A
and B (also performed by the author), led to N
segments
being used as the primary indic-
ator for jet punch-through and motivated the need for a jet punch-through correction.
Chapter 5. The author developed a procedure to calibrate jets using N
segments
to remove jet
punch-through eects. Initial code to derive and test the jet punch-through correction
was implemented mainly from scratch, using a modified version of the jet response
fitting tool. This was later incorporated by the author into the main framework used
by ATLAS to derive the Global Sequential corrections.
Chapter 6. The author proposed the dijet balance method used to validate the correction
and derive its associated systematic uncertainties, implementing and running the code.
Chapter 7. The author performed all performance studies in this chapter, modifying the
derivation code to test the impact of the correction on jets, and modifying the dijet
analysis code to test the eect of the correction on the dijet mass resonances search.
The work in this thesis led to the jet punch-through correction being incorporated into
the final 2012 ATLAS jet energy scale calibration as the fifth step in the Global Sequential
calibrations, as described in Chapter 8. The performance of these final ATLAS 2012 Global
Sequential corrections, together with the procedure used to validate them in data (also
performed by the author as detailed in Appendix E), is published in Reference [1].
The procedure developed and implemented in this thesis to derive the jet punch-through
correction is currently being used by ATLAS in Run II, with improvements planned in the
future as will be mentioned in the Conclusions.
In addition to the work in this thesis, the author also performed studies for the ATLAS
Dijet Mass Resonances search, contributing to initial 14 TeV sensitivity studies documented
in Ref. [2], and fit stability tests for the 8 TeVanalysis published in Ref. [3].

Introduction
The LHC completed Run I in 2012, with ATLAS collecting 5.46fb1and 22.8fb1of data
at 7 and 8 TeV respectively. During this period, the Standard Model was probed to scales
never reached before, and the existence of the Higgs boson finally confirmed by ATLAS and
CMS in July 2012 [4, 5]. Measurements of hadronic final states were integral to both this,
and to searches for New Physics where they appear as both backgrounds and signatures for
new particles.
Hadronic final states appear in the detector as hadronic showers. Hadronic jets are a
fundamental ingredient in clustering these hadronic showers into objects from which the
kinematic properties of the hadronic final states can be measured. They are also indispens-
able theoretical tools, allowing theoretical predictions to be compared with experimental
results. Accurately measuring the energy of hadronic jets is therefore integral to the success
of New Physics searches and precision measurements of the Standard Model.
One key factor aecting the accuracy of energy measurements of hadronic jets is how well
the hadronic shower represented by the jet is contained within the hadronic calorimeter of the
detector. Longitudinal leakage of a jets hadronic shower outside of the hadronic calorimeter,
commonly referred to as jet punch-through, can degrade the accuracy of the measured
energy of the hadronic jet. Leakage can also induce non-Poissonian fluctuations in the
measured energy, degrading the jet energy resolution, an important quantity in determining
the quality of a calorimeter, and the quality of the overall energy measurement. The initial
ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale was found to be sensitive to these eects.
This thesis describes the development, derivation, validation and performance of a new
Introduction 2
correction, the jet punch-through correction, designed to remove the eects of longitudinal
hadronic shower leakage from the ATLAS jet energy scale. It begins with an overview
of the Standard Model, the theoretical constraints that give rise to hadronic showers and
necessitate the use of jets, and the basic calorimetry concepts integral in measuring the energy
of hadronic showers, in Chapter 1. A summary of the Large Hadron Collider and ATLAS
experiment is given in Chapter 2. This is followed by an explanation of jet reconstruction
within ATLAS in Chapter 3. An explanation of how punch-through jets are identified,
and the subsequent impact of jet punch-through on the initial ATLAS 2012 jet energy
scale is explored in Chapter 4, which motivates the need for the correction derived in this
thesis. The procedure used to derive this correction is described in Chapter 5, with the data
validation of the correction performed in Chapter 6, from which systematic uncertainties on
the correction were derived. The performance of this correction in terms of its impact on
the ATLAS jet energy scale and a search for New Physics is assessed in Chapter 7. Lastly,
the final ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale calibration that incorporates this correction is briefly
outlined in Chapter 8.
The jet punch-through correction was derived for four anti-k
jet collections in total:
EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS scale jets with R = 0.6 and R = 0.4. In the main
chapters of this thesis, plots corresponding to studies done using jets at the EM+JES+GS-
scale with R = 0.6 are shown. Studies using jets at the LCW+JES+GS-scale with R = 0.6
can be found in Appendix D.
Chapter 1
Theoretical Background
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics summarises our current understanding of the
fundemental interactions of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces. It catalogues the
gauge bosons that mediate these interactions, along with the known leptons and quarks
that form the fundemental building blocks of all matter. It is the culmination of decades
of experimental and theoretical progress in quantum physics, built upon the foundations of
Quantum Field Theory (QFT).
Whilst it has had unparalleled success in predicting physical quantities to unprecendented
accuracies, it is only an eective theory, describing the world down to the scale of  1 TeV.
In order to develop a more completely theory, it is necessary to search for new physics at
the high energy frontier, currently being probed by the Large Hadron Collider. Accurately
measuring the kinematics of hadronic final states is critical to the success of such searches,
and also for precision measurements of the Standard Model.
This chapter gives the theoretical motivation for the use of jets to measure the kinematics
of hadronic final states, and the need for methods that ensure the measured jet energy is un-
aected by longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, motivating the correction described in this
thesis. The chapter begins by giving an overview of the Standard Model in Section 1.1. This
is followed in Section 1.2 by an outline of the theory of the strong force - Quantum Chromo-
dynamics - and the theoretical constrains that necessitate the use of jets to link theoretical

predictions of strong processes with experimental measurements. Processes important in
making energy measurements using calorimeters, as well as the problems associated with
longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, are described in Section 1.3. Section 1.4 summarises
the Monte Carlo simulations used in this thesis.
1.1 The Standard Model of particle physics
The Standard Model is a relativistic, non-abelian1, locally gauge invariant Quantum Field
Theory [69]. Its local gauge invariance under the symmetry group SU(3)SU(2)U(1)
gives rise to conserved currents under Noethers theorem [10], mediated by massless gauge
bosons. SU(3), represented by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), couples to the colour
charge, mediated by eight gluons with dierent permutations of colour. SU(2)
U(1) rep-
resents the Electro-Weak (EW) force that gives rise to the weak hypercharge, mediated by
the W, W 0 and B0 bosons. Gravity is not described by the SM.
The symmetry of the SU(2)
U(1) group is broken (known as electro-weak symmetry
breaking) using the Higgs mechanism [11, 12] via spontaneous symmetry breaking, resulting
in the formation of two new gauge bosons through the mixing of W 0 and B0- the photon
() and Z boson2. The photon couples to electric charge, mediating the electromagnetic
force described by U(1) and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The W and Z bosons
become massive through EW symmetry breaking and couple to weak isospin, mediating the
weak force described by SU(2). Another consequence of electo-weak symmetry breaking is
the formation of a condensate manifesting as a scalar field, the Higgs field, mediated by the
massive and neutral Higgs boson that couples to mass. The existence of the Higgs boson
was confirmed by ATLAS and CMS on 4th July 2012 [4, 5].
The interactions of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces manifest as 24 half-integer
spin fermions, each with a respective anti-fermion that has inverted quantum numbers. These
1The transformations of the weak (SU(2)) and strong (SU(3)) symmetry groups do not commute, resulting
in self-interactions of the gauge bosons.

fermions combined with the gauge bosons (integer spin) and the scalar Higgs boson (spin
0) make up the known particles of the SM, as summarised in Figure 1.1. The fermions are
split into three generations of six quarks and six leptons based upon their interactions and
mass, with each successive generation being increasingly massive. Quarks carry non-integer
electric charge and colour, interacting via the strong and electromagnetic forces. Isolated
quarks are never observed due to asymptotic freedom, but instead form colourless particles
called hadrons, as will be explained in Section 1.2.1. Leptons are further split into three
with unit charge and three neutral, with all carrying weak isospin and no colour charge, thus
being invisible to the strong force.

1.2 Quantum Chromodynamics
The theory of strong interactions began in the 1930s with the development of isospin by
Heisenberg, used to explain the similarities between the proton and neutron (nucleons) [14].
Yukawa then introduced the exchange of mesons as a method of generating a nuclear force
capable of binding nuclei together [15]. Flavour symmetries that extended isospin to SU(3)
led to the development of the Eightfold Way by Gell-Mann and Neeman [16, 17], resulting
in predictions of the  and colour, both later experimentally verified [18]. Gell-Mann [19]
and Zweig [20] observed this framework could be explained by introducing an underlying
point-like structure of hadrons - quarks. Bjorken [21] postulated that this structure should
result in the electron proton (ep) scattering cross-section in the limit of infinite momentum
transfer (Q2), also known as the deep inelastic limit, scaling as:
2p  q (1.1)
where Q2 = q2 = (pp0)2 is the dierence between the initial (p) and final (p0) scattering
particle momentum. This was confirmed by an MIT-SLAC collaboration [2224], resulting
in Feynman calling these point-like constituents partons [25]. This led to Bjorkens x being
identified as the fraction of the longitudinal hadron momentum carried by a given parton.
Further deep inelastic scattering experimental results [2224] showed the probes scattered
from point-like spin-1/2 constituents, leading to the introduction of colour as an additional
quantum number to satisfy Fermi-Dirac statistics [26, 27]. From the cross-section for elec-
tronpositron annihilation into hadrons, it was inferred that three colours existed - red, blue
and green. The spin-1 gluon and structure of the proton were then inferred kinematically
from momentum distributions of the partons, suggesting the proton is made from 3 valence
quarks (up, up, down) mixed with a sea of lower energy quark/anti-quark pairs and gluons.
The quark model eventually led to the development of Quantum Chromodynamics.
Two key features of QCD are confinement and asymptotic freedom. Confinement results
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 7
in quarks and gluons being bound inside colour neutral states such as nucleons, however at
suciently high energies (small distance scales) they act as free - asymptotic freedom. These
features prevent the experimental observation of free quarks and gluons. Instead, quarks and
gluons are measured by the detector as collimated showers of hadrons clustered into jets.
1.2.1 Singularities, asymptotic freedom and confinement
Perturbative expansions of calculations involving loops, such as the loop in Figure 1.2, result
in singularities called ultra-violet divergences.
Figure 1.2: Fermionic loop correction to S-channel annihilation [28].
In order to remove these non-physical infinities to give physically meaningful results,
a renormalisation procedure is necessary. This is performed through the subtraction of
the infinities through counter-terms embedded in bare parameters that are unmeasurable.
These subtractions are introduced via corrections to the renormalised parameter at a scale
known as the renormalisation scale 
. As 
is introduced by hand, any physical variable
calculated must be independent of 
when summing over all orders of perturbation theory,
however the calculation still depends on 
when truncating the calculation at a given order.
This results in the renormalisation correction being dependant on 
and Q2. An important
renormalised parameter is the strong coupling constant, which can be calculated to Leading
Order (LO) via [29]:
1 + S(
)0 ln(Q2/
(1.2)
The renormalised coupling constant is thus a function of the scale of the process, and
runs with energy. This can be seen from the experimental measurements of S as a function
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 8
of Q, shown in Figure 1.3. Making the substitution ln(2
) = ln(2
)  1
, S(Q
can also be expressed as [29]:
0 ln(Q2/
(1.3)
where 2
can be interpreted as the non-perturbative limit, at which point perturbative
methods break down due to 
 1 as Q2  2
. This phenomenon of the strength
of the strong force increasing with distance3 leads to confinement of quarks within colour
neutral states. Conversely, as Q2  1, 
 0, resulting in quarks behaving as free particles
at high Q2 (small distance scales) - asymptotic freedom.
Figure 1.3: S as a function of Q [30].
1.2.2 Hadronization
Experimentally, asymptotic freedom results in high energy probes being necessary to eject
quarks and gluons from the nucleon, while confinement prevents quarks and gluons from
3  1p
, where  is the wavelength of the probing particle.
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 9
being observed directly. Instead, they appear in the detector as collimated sprays of particles.
This process can be summarised for hadronic collisions (such as the pp collisions at the Large
Hadron Collider) as follows [31]:
1. Two hadrons collide at high Q2, where each hadron can be viewed as a bag of partons.
2. A collision between one parton from each hadron (incoming partons) results in the
hard scatter of interest, giving the outgoing partons.
3. Bremstrahlung results in emissions from the incoming (Initial State Radiation or ISR)
and outgoing (Final State Radiation or FSR) partons.
4. Additional partons within the hadrons may collide within a single hadron-hadron col-
lision - multiple interactions.
5. As the distance between the outgoing partons increases (Q2  2
 1. This
results in a non-perturbative process, whereby the colour force can be seen as a string
connecting two particles with opposite colour charges. The colour potential in the
string increases as the separation between the two colour charges increases, eventually
resulting in the string breaking and creating two new colour charges at its endpoints.
When two opposite colour charges are close together they will recombine into hadrons.
This process is called hadronization, and results in collimated sprays of particles.
Figure 1.4: Pictorial representation of 2  2 body hard scattering event [32].
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 10
These steps are represented schematically in Figure 1.4.
The collision remnants from the hard scatter not identified as interesting (ISR, FSR,
multiple interactions) are referred to as the underlying event.
1.2.3 Measuring inclusive QCD processes: jets
The emission of infinitely soft particles or particles at small angles in QCD processes can
cause infra-red and collinear divergences respectively. These can cause infinities during
calculations, that result in a divergent inclusive QCD cross-section. The Kinoshita-Lee-
Nauenberg (KLN) theorem [33, 34] states these divergences cancel when using inclusive
observables insensitive to processes involving a variable number of final-state partons. Such
inclusive observables are called infra-red safe, and have kinematics that reflect the kinematics
of the final state partons. This requirement to use such infra-red safe observables can be
likened to the finite spatial resolution of the detector preventing individual final state partons
from being resolved.
In 1977, Sternman and Weinburg [35] introduced the concept of jets - collimated groups
of particles generated by hadronization - as inclusive objects with a rigorous definition that
could be used to connect calculations from perturbative QCD to experimental measurements
of hadronic final states. Their definition was based upon the assumption that two partons
with suciently high momentum will produce back-to-back jets. The jet cross-section was
then defined as the number of events containing two cones of opening angle , that contain a
fraction (1 ) of the total energy of the event, where  is the fraction of energy in the event
not contained within the cone. Provided  and  are not too small, the result is perturbat-
ively well behaved. Today, many dierent jet definitions are available. Chapter 3 contains
more information on these definitions and jet reconstruction in the ATLAS experiment.
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 11
1.3 Energy measurement using calorimeters
In modern particle physics experiments, the energy of final-state particles is commonly meas-
ured through total absorption in a block of matter called a calorimeter. Calorimeters also
provide additional information for particle ID, event selection, triggering and precision meas-
urements. The measurement process of a calorimeter is destructive, meaning particles are
no longer available for inspection after measurement (with the exception of muons).
They are popular due to a number of useful features. Their energy resolution4, ,
improves with increasing energy, making them ideal for use in detecting the high energy
products of collisions in high energy physics experiments. They are relatively compact due to
the amount of material necessary to contain a particle shower / log(E), as will be discussed
more in Section 1.3.3, making the material cost manageable. Finally, they are sensitive to
both charged and neutral particles.
Calorimeters make use of a range of dierent technologies, including scintillation, Cerenkov
radiation, ionization, and cryogenic phenomena. There are two main types of calorimeter:
homogeneous and sampling calorimeters. Homogeneous calorimeters are made only out of
material sensitive to particles (active material) such as scintillating crystals. Sampling calor-
imeters are made from alternating layers of active materials (scintillators, semiconductors,
noble liquids) and high density passive materials that act as absorbers (Fe, Cu, Pb, etc.).
Sampling calorimeters are used by ATLAS because they require less material and are thus
cheaper, however their energy resolution is poorer than homogeneous calorimeters.
Dierent particles react in dierent ways with the calorimeter, depositing energy via a
variety of processes. Electrons and photons form electromagnetic showers in the calorimeter,
whilst hadronic final states form hadronic showers. The dierent interactions through which
they lose and deposit energy in the calorimeter are important considerations in the design
of the calorimeter, especially in terms of the amount of material necessary to fully contain
the showers. Shower containment is vital in providing accurate energy measurements.
4 and E are the width and mean of the measured energy distribution respectively.
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 12
1.3.1 Electromagnetic showers
When interacting with the calorimeter, electrons and positrons lose energy via bremsstrahlung
and ionisation, while photons lose energy via electron-positron pair production, and the
photoelectric and Compton eects. At low energy, ionisation and the photoelectric/Compton
eects dominate. At high energy however, such as the environment at the Large Hadron
Collider, bremsstrahlung radiation and electron-positron pair production dominate, resulting
in the production of electromagnetic showers.
A convenient distance measure for electromagnetic showers is the radiation length (X0),
defined to be the mean length of material required to reduce the energy of a photon or
electron by 1/e. The longitudinal depth of the shower maximum in units of X0, tmax, is then
given by [36]:
ln(E0/Ec)
(1.4)
where E0 is the initial electron or photon energy, and Ec is the critical energy at which
energy loss rates due to bremsstrahlung and ionisation are equal. Here, E
= 610 MeV/(Z+
1.24) [37], and is only dependant on the atomic number of the material Z. Therefore the
longitudinal depth of the shower maximum, and thus the amount of material required to
contain 95% of the shower, increases logarithmically with energy of the electron or photon.
1.3.2 Hadronic showers
The presence of strong hadronic interactions with matter makes hadronic showers more com-
plicated than electromagnetic ones. The strong interaction results in the following processes
(summarised in Figure 1.5):
 The production of hadronic shower particles through hadronization and the decay of
these hadrons. Neutral pions (0) account for  1
of the produced particles, which
subsequently decay into two photons (0  ), producing electromagnetic showers.
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 13
These electromagnetic showers develop in the same way as those initiated by high
energy electrons or photons.
 Nuclear reactions resulting in the release of neutrons and protons. The nuclear binding
energy released by these interactions is not normally absorbed by the detector, resulting
in invisible energy. These processes can also result in the production of neutrinos (and
muons) that leave the detector unobserved, contributing to escaped energy.
Figure 1.5: Schematic of hadronic shower [38].
As a result of these additional interactions, the energy response of a hadron, defined to
be the ratio between the detected (reconstructed) energy and the true energy of the incident
particle, is smaller than the energy response of an electron of the same nominal energy. Two
approaches are generally taken to improve the response of hadrons:
 Compensation: Calorimeters that use specialised active layers to capture invisible en-
ergy are called compensating calorimeters. Examples of this are calorimeters that use
high-Z materials such as uranium (238U) combined with scintilator plastic to ensure
electrons and hadrons have the same response. When using uranium, nuclear reactions
will also produce neutrons, which can further produce additional neutrons and -rays
by inducing fission of other nuclei, enhancing the amplitude of the hadronic shower.
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 14
 Non-compensation: Calorimeters that have a dierent response to electrons and had-
rons are called non-compensating calorimeters. Instead of using specialised active lay-
ers to measure invisible energy, non-compensation is accounted for through the use
of additional calibrations which restore the hadron response to the electron response.
ATLAS uses a non-compensating calorimeter.
The ratio of the electron response to the pion response (e/) is one method of assessing
the level of non-compensation, where an e/ > 1 suggests non-compensation. The hadron
response (and thus e/) in non-compensating calorimeters will be lower for showers with
a lower electromagnetic component. The fraction of electromagnetic energy in a hadronic
shower, f
, is shown in Figure 1.6 (left) to increase as a function of the initial pion energy,
resulting from higher energy pions having more energy available for hadron (0) production.
Thus e/ for a non-compensating calorimeter will increase with initial pion energy.
Figure 1.6: Fraction of electromagnetic energy in hadronic shower (left) [39] and e/ for
various e/h values (right) [40] as a function of initiating pion energy.
An energy independent way of assessing non-compensation is to use the ratio of the calor-
imeter response to the electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic components of a hadronic
shower, e/h [41]. One parameterisation for extracting e/h from measurements of e/ is [42]:
1 + (e/h 1)  k  lnE (1.5)
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 15
Here, k = Ee/E
ln(E)
, where E is the total hadronic shower energy and E
is the contribution
from the electromagnetic part of the shower. Calorimeters with e/h > 1, e/h = 1 and e/h <
1 are called undercompensating, compensating and over-compensating respectively. Non-
compensating calorimeters are undercompensating. Figure 1.6 (right) shows e/ as a func-
tion of initial pion energy for dierent e/h values, which confirms e/ for non-compensating
calorimeters increases with initial pion energy. ATLAS has e/h = 1.362 0.006 [43].
Hadronic shower profiles are governed by the nuclear interaction length (I), defined to
be the average distance hadrons travel before inducing a nuclear interaction [44]:
I  35g/cm2A1/3 (1.6)
where A is the nuclear mass number. I is generally much larger than X0 e.g. For copper,
X0 = 1.4cm, while I = 15cm [40]. As a result, hadronic calorimeters are generally much
deeper than electromagnetic calorimeters.
Figure 1.7: The longitudinal shower profile for 300 GeV pion interactions in a block of
uranium, measured from the induced 99Mo radioactivity [45]
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 16
The longitudinal shower profile for 300 GeV pion interactions in a block of uranium,
measured from the induced 99Mo radioactivity, is shown in Figure 1.7. The figure shows
how the number of nuclei in the shower changes with the depth of the shower measured in I.
The shower maximum, t
is approximated to 0.2 lnE[GeV ]+0.7 = 1.85 I in this case, with
95% of the shower contained at a depth of L95, where L95 = tmax + 2.5(E[GeV ])
0.3  7.4 I
for this shower. Thus for a 300 GeV pion, uranium with a depth of 8 I is required to achieve
95% containment. An alternative form for the amount of material required to contain 95%
of the hadronic shower is [46]:
L(95%) = (9.4 lnE[ GeV] + 39)[cm Fe] (1.7)
Whilst these definitions do not give identical results, they both suggest that the length
of material needed to contain a hadronic shower grows with the logarithm of the energy of
the particle that initiated the shower, similar to what is seen for electromagnetic showers.
For a 300 GeV pion in iron, Equation 1.7 gives  92.62 cm, while  124 cm is obtained from
the other definition when taking I for iron to be 16.77 cm [47].
1.3.3 Issues associated with longitudinal hadronic shower leakage
Longitudinal hadronic shower leakage refers to the leakage that occurs when the longitudinal
tail of the hadronic shower is not contained within the hadronic calorimeter. Longitudinal
leakage, for the purposes of this thesis, does not include escaped energy - energy lost due to
neutrinos and muons produced during the hadronic shower escaping the calorimeter undetec-
ted. As seen from Equation 1.7 the amount of material required to contain a hadronic shower
increases with lnE. Longitudinal hadronic shower leakage is thus more likely to occur when
E is larger, or when the shower passes through a layer of the detector with less material. In
addition, the probability of longitudinal leakage is higher when the shower begins later in
the calorimeter.
When leakage occurs, the energy of the leaked shower is not measured, lowering the
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 17
hadronic response. The process is stochastic, resulting in non-Poissonian fluctuations of the
measured hadronic energy. As well as aecting the mean of the measurement, this can have
a negative impact on the resolution of the calorimeter, where the resolution is a measure of
the fluctuation of the measured energy around the mean measured energy. The resolution
is a commonly used measure of the quality of a detector - the better the resolution, the
better the detector. For non-compensating hadronic calorimeters, the resolution, E
, can be
expressed via [45]:
 B  C
(1.8)
is aected by fluctuations in the invisible energy content of the shower, a result
of fluctuations in the electromagnetic shower fraction, nuclear excitations/fission/binding
energy, and heavily ionising particles. B is a constant term aected by inhomogeneities and
longitudinal shower leakage. C
is aected by electronic noise and sampling fluctuations. 
denotes addition in quadrature. The energy resolution therefore gets worse as a result of
longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, a result of the increasing contribution of B.
These eects were confirmed in the study in Reference [48] that assessed the eect of leak-
age on the energy response and energy resolution of the ATLAS hadronic tile calorimeter.
The study was performed using 100 GeV pion test beams fired at a prototype calorimeter
configuration composed of five sector modules with total thickness 9.4 I. Each module
(visible in Figure 1.8) consists of 57 periods, with each period consisting of four layers.
The first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates, whilst the second and
fourth layers consist of alternating steel plates and scintillator tiles [48]. The modules were
mounted onto a scanning table (Figure 1.8), allowing for high precision movements along
any direction [49]. The test beam was fired at incidence angle  = 10, with impact point
Z along the axis parallel to the face of the calorimeter varied from -36 to 20 cm.
In order to detect for leakage, plastic scintillator detectors called muon walls were placed
behind and at the right side of the calorimeter modules, resulting a setup similar to that
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 18
shown in Figure 1.9. An event was tagged as having longitudinal or lateral leakage if at least
one hit was detected in the muon walls behind or to the side of the calorimeter respectively.
Figure 1.8: Prototype tile calorimeter module (left) [48] mounted onto the scanning table
(right) [49].
Figure 1.9: Example arrangement of muon walls. [50].
Figure 1.10 taken from this study shows the mean energy (left) and energy resolution
(right) as a function of Z for hadronic showers experiencing various types of leakage. The
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 19
energy resolution is characterised by looking at the RMS of the energy distribution divided by
the mean energy, RMS(E)/E. The no leakage case is represented by black squares, while
longitudinal leakage is represented by open squares. The results clearly show longitudinal
leakage reduces the measured mean energy from 100 GeV to 90-92 GeV(an 8-10% reduction).
It also drastically worsens the energy resolution, from  0.1 to between 0.15 and 0.3.

51] using data from the CITF collaboration [52]:

where 
and E
are the resolution and mean energy respectively for events with longitudinal
hadronic shower leakage, while 0 and E0 are the resolution and mean energy respectively
for events without longitudinal hadronic shower leakage. The resolution degradation from
Equation 1.9 was found to be within reasonable agreement with the observed degradation
in Figure 1.10 [48].
Chapter 1. Theoretical Background 20
Longitudinal hadronic shower leakage is thus an important consideration in calorimeter
design, and also in the subsequent calibrations involved in measuring the energy of the
hadronic shower from the energy depositions the calorimeter. The correction described in
this thesis aims to remove the aect of longitudinal hadronic shower leakage on the energy
response and the energy resolution for hadronic showers measured using jets by ATLAS.
1.4 Monte Carlo simulation of QCD processes
Monte Carlo (MC) event generators are used to simulate the energy and direction of particles
produced in pp collisions. Simulations are used to assess the true energy of jets that interact
with the detector, allowing their energy response and resolution to be easily measured (see
Section 3.4). MC simulations are therefore extremely useful in studying the aect of longit-
udinal hadronic shower leakage on the measured jet energy, and are used in this thesis to
derive a correction to remove these eects. An overview of the MC event generators used in
ATLAS can be found in Ref. [53].
The baseline simulation samples used in this thesis are dijet events produced using
Pythia8 [54] (version 8.160) with the CT10 PDF set [55] and the underlying-event tune
AU2 CT10 [56]. Hadronic showers are simulated with the QGSP BERT model [57]. Mul-
tiple parton interactions are simulated separately using Pythia8 as minimum bias events
using the A2M tune [56] and the MSTW2008LO PDF [58]. The simulated multiple parton
interaction detector signals are then overlaid on-to the hard-scatter detector signals [1].
In this thesis, this Pythia8 sample is referred to as the nominal Pythia8 Monte Carlo
sample. The full sample contains approximately 38.9 million simulated jet events. The
samples are generated in eight transverse momentum bins (X slices), generated at
s = 8
TeV. Each slice is generated with a flat jet transverse momentum spectrum. In order to form
the final event sample with the correct shape in the jet transverse momentum, the i-th event

The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), situated at CERN in Geneva, is a high centre-of-mass
energy proton-proton (pp) collider, designed to push the boundaries of our understanding of
the fundemental nature of the universe at the Terascale. The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC
ApparatuS) experiment is located at interaction point 1 on the LHC [60]. It is a general
purpose detector, designed to search for a broad range of new phenomena, discover the
Higgs boson, and also provide precision measurements of the standard model processes at
the energy frontier of particle physics. At the time of writing, the LHC had just begun Run
II, with ATLAS recording data from LHC collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.
Run I refers to the data taking period from 2010-2012.
This chapter will briefly describe the LHC in Section 2.1, followed by an overview of the
ATLAS detector and its sub-systems in Section 2.2.
2.1 The Large Hadron Collider
The LHC is the worlds largest and most energetic particle accelerator. Situated on the
French-Swiss border in a 26.7 km tunnel at a mean depth of 100 meters, it is the result of over
20 years of design, development, construction and testing. The LHC accelerates two beams of
protons (or lead ions) circulating in opposite directions to high energies (O( TeV)), bringing
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 23
them to collision within detectors situated at four interaction points, depicted in Figure 2.1.
LHCb is a specialised b-physics experiment [61], ALICE is a heavy-ion experiment utilising
data from heavy (lead) ion collisions [62], and ATLAS [60] and CMS [63] are general
purpose detectors designed to study a multitude of dierent phenomena. The design centre-
of-mass collision energy of the LHC is 14 TeV, although for Runs I and II the operational
centre-of-mass energy was lower, as will be discussed in Section 2.1.1.
Hydrogen molecules from a standard gas bottle provide the protons that are injected into
the CERN accelerator complex displayed in Figure 2.1. To reach the operational centre-of-
mass energy, the protons are accelerated through a chain of accelerators: LINAC 2 (50
MeV)  Proton Synchrotron (PS) Booster (1.4 GeV)  PS (28 GeV)  Super Proton
Synchrotron, SPS (450 GeV)  LHC (O( TeV)).
The LHC accelerator contains a total of 9593 magnets, including 1232 dipole magnets to
bend the beam, 392 quadropole magnets to focus the beam, and 8 radio-frequency cavities
per beam to provide acceleration. For Run I, the main dipoles generate unprecedented 8.4 T
magnetic fields, achieved by using superfluid liquid helium to cool the magnets to < 1.9 K.
The number of events, N
, produced by a process with cross section 
is given by:
Ldt (2.1)
where L is the instantaneous luminosity. Thus, in order for the LHC experiments to be
sensitive to rare processes with low cross sections, the instantaneous luminosity delivered by
the collider must be optimised to be as high as possible. The instantaneous luminosity is
dependant on the LHC beam parameters:
L = N1N2nbfr
F (2.2)
whereby the LHC proton beams are arranged into trains of bunches of protons, such that,
N1 and N2 represent the number of particles per bunch in each beam, nb is the number of
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 24
bunches per beam, f
is the rotation frequency, F is a reduction factor to account for the
crossing angle at the interaction point, and  measures the beam size in the x and y plane.
The LHC is designed to hold 2808 bunches, each containing up to 1.15 1011 protons, with
a separation of 25 ns between each bunch. It has a design luminosity of L = 1034cm2s1,
achieved with beam parameters set to 
= 16.7m and f
= 11.25 kHz [64].
Measurements of the luminosity can be made by expressing the luminosity as:
L = nbfr
visn
(2.3)
where  is the number of interactions per bunch crossing and 
is the inelastic pp cross
section. ATLAS uses event counting to measure /
in terms of visible quantities
vis/
that take into account ineciencies in the detector.
vis is obtained by counting the number of activated readout channels per bunch cross-
ing via multiple methods, including the LUCID and Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM)
detectors, timing information from the liquid-argon calorimeter, and hit counts in the muon
chambers (see Ref. [65] for a full list). Using multiple methods helps to reduce the uncer-
tainty on vis. Combining Equations 2.3 and 2.2 allows 
to be measured in terms of
, obtained through van der Meer (vdM) scans. In a vdM scan, the event rate is mon-
itored while the beams are scanned across each other, first in the x direction and then in the
y direction, from which 
can be extracted. The uncertainty in the vdM measurement
dominates the uncertainty on the measured luminosity.
Increasing the number of protons per bunch to increase the luminosity also increases the
average number of interactions per bunch crossing, , known as in-time pile-up. Increasing
the luminosity by increasing the number of bunches per beam can cause the bunch spacing
to be less than the detector latency, resulting in out-of-time pile-up. Reducing 
increase both types of pile-up. Pile-up results in additional uninteresting events that can
obscure interesting physics events and degrade detector performance, making it an important
consideration when optimising beam parameters to increase luminosity.

2.2 The ATLAS detector
The ATLAS detector is a general-purpose particle detector designed, built and operated by
a collaboration of over 2900 physicists from 172 dierent institutions and universities located
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 27
throughout the world. Figure 2.3 displays the layout of the detector.
Figure 2.3: Schematic of ATLAS detector [69].
The detector is hermetic, aiming to cover the full 4 steradian range, exhibiting both
forward-backward and cylindrical symmetry. It is composed of concentric sub-detector layers
that encompass the collision point at their centre.
Figure 2.4: Schematic diagram of particles passing through ATLAS detector [70].
Closest to the interaction point is the inner detector, containing the ATLAS tracking
system designed to measure the trajectories of charged particles. This is surrounded by the
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 28
liquid-argon electromagnetic calorimeter designed to measure the energy of electromagnetic
showers, followed by the tile hadronic calorimeter used to measure the energy of hadronic
showers. The muon spectrometer forms the outer-most detector layer, used to measure
muons. Momenta measurements of charged particles from tracks are made by bending their
trajectories using two magnet systems: a 2 T solenoid surrounding the inner detector and a
larger 2-8 T toroidal magnet lying outside the calorimeter. A schematic diagram displaying
the traversal of various particles through these detector layers is shown in Figure 2.4.
2.2.1 The ATLAS coordinate system
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with the collision point at its centre. The
z-axis runs parallel to the anti-clockwise beam direction, the x-axis points towards the centre
of the LHC and the y-axis points upwards. The azimuthal angle, , is measured in the x y
plane, while the polar coordinate, , is measured relative to the z-axis. In most analysis,
defining a Lorentz-invariant coordinate axis is useful. As most particles measured will have
E  m, it is convenient to use the pseudorapidity, defined as:
 =  ln tan(
) (2.4)
which is the ultra-relativistic approximation of the rapidity, y = 1
ln(E+pz
), where E is the
particle energy and p
is the z-component of the particle pT. The metric for    space,
R, is given by:
2 +2 (2.5)
2.2.2 The Inner Detector
The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID), displayed in Figure 2.5, is designed to provide high-
resolution tracking information achieved through fine detector granularity.
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 29
Figure 2.5: Diagram displaying ATLAS Inner Detector [71].
The solenoid magnetic field enables the track momenta to be measured from the curvature
of the track, allowing the primary vertex to be identified as the vertex with the highest sum
of transverse momentum (pT) of tracks pointing towards it, normalised by the number of
tracks. High-resolution tracking also allows the transverse (d0) and longitudinal (z0) impact
parameters to be precisely determined as the distance between the track and the beamline at
perigee1 and the z-coordinate of the track at perigee respectively. The ID covers the region
 < 2.5, consisting of three concentric sub-detectors:
1. The Pixel detector is constructed of 1744 pixel modules installed in three layers
closest to the beam pipe. Each module has 47,232 pixels, with 90% (10%) of pixels
having area 50m  400m (50m  600m) and thickness 250m. This high pixel
density provides an intrinsic accuracy of 10m  115m in the R   (R  R) plane
for the barrel (end-cap) region [72].
2. The Semiconductor tracker (SCT) consists of 15,912 silicon strip sensors surround-
ing the Pixel detector, each with 770 strips. Pairs of sensors are aligned in modules
with a small stereo angle of 40 mrad, allowing the measurement of a two-dimensional
hit coordinate. There are four concentric barrels and nine end-cap disks, ensuring all
tracks with || < 2.5 will pass through a minimum of four SCT layers. These features
1The perigee point is the point along the track which is closest to the beam-line.
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 30
allow for an intrinsic accuracy of 17m 590m in R (RR) space for the barrel
(end-cap).
3. The Transition radiation tracker (TRT) consists of 370,000 drift chambers, known
as straws, surrounding the SCT, that simultaneously act as a particle tracker and a
transition radiation detector to aid in electron identification. The 4mm diameter straws
are arranged parallel to the beam-line in the barrel and radially in the end-cap. The
TRT covers the region || < 2.0, only providing R   position information, with an
intrinsic accuracy of 130m per straw.
2.2.3 The ATLAS calorimeter system
The ATLAS calorimeter system, displayed in Figure 2.6, is used to measure the energy and
position of final state particles through energy depositions of showers in the calorimeter.
The calorimeter system employs a sampling technique, whereby layers of active and passive
material are sandwiched together to alternate absorption and measurement of energy, allow-
ing for a more compact design with almost complete containment of the particle showers,
collectively covering || < 4.9.
Figure 2.6: Diagram displaying ATLAS calorimeter system [73].
In order to account for the dierent properties of electromagnetic and hadronic showers,
the ATLAS calorimeter is composed of two subsystems - the ElectroMagnetic (EM) and
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 31
Hadronic Calorimeters (ECAL and HCal respectively). As mentioned in Section 1.3.2,
the ATLAS calorimeters are non-compensating, with the correct hadronic scale restored via
the Jet Energy Scale calibration, described in Section 3.5.
In order to ensure the calorimeters provide good containment of electromagnetic and
hadronic showers, with minimal probability for longitudinal shower leakage into the muon
systems, the ECAL has thickness  22X0 ( 24X0) in the barrel (end-cap), while the HCal
has thickness  9.7I ( 11I) in the barrel (end-cap). A distribution of the calorimeter
material as a function of  can be seen in Figure 2.7. It will be shown in Section 4.1 that
the ATLAS calorimeters still display a probability for hadronic longitudinal shower leakage,
which is highly dependant on this distribution of detector material.

Electromagnetic calorimeters
The ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeters, commonly known as the LAr calorimeters, use
liquid-argon as the active material and lead as the absorber that induces showering within
the calorimeter. The LAr barrel consists of two identical cylindrical components collect-
ively covering || < 1.475, while the end-caps are separated into two coaxial wheels covering
1.375  || < 2.5 and 2.5  || < 3.2. The region between the forward and barrel compon-
ents (1.375  || < 1.52), is the poorly instrumented crack region, often excluded when
reconstructing electrons.
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 32
The LAr calorimeter barrel, displayed in Figure 2.8, has an accordion structure designed
to avoid azimuthal cracks, provide full  symmetry and allow for fast readout. It is segmented
into three layers, each with decreasing granularity. The first layer, used to reconstruct the
 position of the shower and provide particle identification, has a granularity of  =
0.00310.098 = 4.69mm147.3mm. The second (third) layer has a granularity of =
0.0245  0.0245 = 37.5mm  36.8mm (   = 0.0245  0.05 = 37.5mm  75.1mm),
collecting the bulk (tail) of the electromagnetic shower.
Figure 2.8: Segmentation of electromagnetic barrel calorimeter [73].
Prior to the calorimeters, in the region || < 1.8, particles traverse an 11 (5) mm layer
of liquid-argon forming the barrel (end-cap) presampler. Energy from the presampler is
readout separately from the rest of the LAr calorimeter, and is weighted to recover energy
losses due to particles traversing inactive material upstream of the LAr calorimeter.
Hadronic calorimeters
The ATLAS hadronic barrel calorimeter, commonly known as the Tile calorimeter, is split
into the barrel and extended barrels covering the regions 0  || < 0.8 and 0.8  || < 1.7
respectively (displayed in Figure 2.9). There is a gap between the extended tile barrel and
tile barrel calorimeter of  600 mm in the region 0.8 <  < 1.0, which is instrumented by
the Intermediate Tile Calorimeter (ITC). The ITC consists of a calorimeter in the region
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 33
0.8 < || < 1.0 (cells D4 and C10 in Figure 2.9) and scintillators between 1.0 < || < 1.6
(E1-E4 in Figure 2.9).
Figure 2.9: Segmentation of tile calorimeter [73].
The Tile calorimeter consists of three layers, with a granularity of   = 0.1 0.1
in the first two layers and    = 0.1  0.2 in the final layer. It employs plastic
scintillator as its active material and steel for the absorber. The plastic tiles are staggered
in depth and connect to photomultiplier tubes via optical fibres at both sides. Particles
depositing energy in the scintillators produce scintillation light with intensity proportional
to the deposited energy. The light is collected using wavelength-shifting-fibres and funnelled
into the photomultiplier tubes to be readout.
Hadronic calorimetry is extended to the forward region via theHadronicEndcapCalorimeter
(HEC), which covers 1.5  || < 3.2. It is important to note that the transition from
the barrel to the HEC is poorly instrumented, and likely to have an increased probability
for longitudinal hadronic shower leakage. In order to deal with the larger flux of higher
energy particles in the forward region, the HEC employs liquid-argon as its active mater-
ial and copper as the absorber. The HEC is split into two layers, with a granularity of
  = 0.1 0.1 in the first and   = 0.2 0.2 in the second.
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 34
Forward calorimeter (FCal)
Calorimetry is extended to the region 3.1  || < 4.9 by the forward calorimeter, commonly
known as the FCal. It is positioned 1.2 m from the front face of the ECAL in order to reduce
the neutron flux, and has a depth of  10I. As with the HEC, liquid-argon is used as the
active material to deal with the high particle fluxes. The FCal is split into three layers, the
first of which employs copper as its absorber, while the last two use tungsten.
2.2.4 The ATLAS muon spectrometer
The ATLAS muon spectrometer (displayed in Figure 2.10) is designed to measure the
momentum of muons in the region || < 2.7, and provide trigger information in the region
|| < 2.4. Information from the muon spectrometer is used in this thesis to study the impact
of longitudinal hadronic shower leakage.
Figure 2.10: Schematic diagram of muon spectrometer [73].
Momentum measurements are made by deflecting muons with the help of large air-core
toroid magnets, three in the barrel at 0.5 T and two in the end-cap at 1 T. The muon system
consists of four types of tracking chambers installed in three concentric cylindrical shells
around the beam axis in the barrel regions (|| < 1.0) and four large wheels perpendicular
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 35
to the z axis in the end-cap region (1.0  || < 2.7) [73]:
 Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) complement MDTs by providing additional pre-
cision tracking in the forward region (2.1 < || < 2.7), where higher particle fluxes
require finer granularity. They are multi-wire proportional chambers providing both
R and  coordinate information, with a resolution of  60m.
 Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) provide bunch-crossing identification and well
defined pT thresholds for triggering, as well as additional tracking information, in the
|| < 1.05 region. They are gaseous parallel electrode-plate detectors operated in
avalanche mode. Each chamber has two layers, providing  and  coordinate measure-
ments. Coincidences between tracks in consecutive layers are used to reject background.
 Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) provide trigger capability and determination of the 
coordinate to complement MDTs in the 1.05  || < 2.4 region. They are multi-wire
proportional chambers which operate in quasi-saturated mode.
 Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT), shown in Figure 2.11, provide precision tracking in
the region || < 2.7 via proportional drift tubes filled with Ar-CO2. The chambers form
three layers in the barrel and four in the end-cap, as visible in Figure 2.10. The tubes
are 3 cm in diameter with an average resolution of  80m. Each chamber contains two
multi-layers of three (four) drift-tubes in the middle/outer (inner-most) layers. The
MDTs are essential in reconstructing information relating to muon activity behind jets
that are leaking into the muon spectrometer as a result of longitudinal hadronic shower
leakage, as will be explained in Section 4.1.

2.2.5 Trigger and Data Acquisition
Technological limitations mean it is only possible to record data at a rate of 200Hz, however
the LHC delivers data at a rate of up to 1 GHz (closer to 20 MHz during 2012 [75]), with
the majority of these events being uninteresting. In order to select interesting events for
analysis oine, ATLAS employs a trigger system. The trigger system is designed to reject
background without biasing selection.
The ATLAS trigger system consists of three levels: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2) and the
Event Filter (EF). The L1 trigger is a hardware base trigger installed onto the detector,
while the L2 and EF are software based triggers collectively referred to as the Higher Level
Trigger (HLT), implemented on an o-detector computer farm. Triggers are organised into
trigger configurations (or trigger menus), composed of trigger chains containing a sequence
of triggers from L1 to the EF. Trigger chains may be prescaled in order to reduce the event
rate for processes with high cross-sections, with prescales adjusted based on the current LHC
luminosity and physics program2. An overview of the trigger system is shown in Figure 2.12.
2A trigger with prescale p will randomly select events with a probability of 1/p, reducing the event rate.

run are taken from [94].
3.3.4 Trigger and data acquisition
It is technically infeasible to record the detector readout (1.6 MB per event) at the bunch
crossing rate expected at the LHC (40 MHz). Moreover, the majority of these events are
uninteresting in terms of the LHC physics program. For these reasons, ATLAS has a
trigger system to identify and retain interesting events for further analysis oine.
The trigger is split into three levels with successively lower event rates: level 1 (L1),
level 2 (L2) and the event filter (EF). This is achieved by aording a longer latency
for later levels to apply more refined selection criteria, as shown in Figure 3.8. The
L2 and EF triggers are collectively referred to as the high level trigger (HLT), and are
implemented on an o-detector computer farm.
The L1 trigger searches for high-pT leptons, photons and jets, in addition to events
with significant total transverse energy or transverse energy imbalance. The decision is
made using muon trigger chamber information (RPCs and TGCs) and reduced-granularity
calorimeter information. Since the decision latency (2.5 s) is longer than the bunch
spacing (25 ns), event data is stored in pipelines while a decision is made.
The detector coordinates of interesting features identified by the L1 trigger, known as
regions of interest (ROIs), are passed on to the L2 trigger. The L2 trigger then requests
the full degree of detector information for these ROIs (2% of total event data), in order
to make a more informed decision. Finally, the EF trigger has access to the full event
Figure 2.12: Overview of ATLAS trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ) system [76].
The L1 trigger uses reduced granularity information from a range of detector subsystems
to search for signatures from high-pT muons (using the RPCs and TGCs), as well as elec-
trons/photons, jets3,  -leptons decaying into hadrons, large missing transverse momentum
(EmissT )
4 and large transverse momentum (
) (using the calorimeter sub-systems). The
acceptance rate of the L1 trigger is 75 kHz, with a latency of 25 s [60].
The L2 trigger is seeded by coordinates of possible trigger objects identified by the
L1 trigger, known as Regions-Of-Interest (ROI). Information on the energy and types of
signatures (roughly 2% of the total event information) is used to limit the data readout
to an event rate below 3.5 kHz, with an average latency of 40 ms. Finally the EF uses
reconstructed physics objects containing information close to the fully reconstructed oine
physics objects to make a decision, reducing the event rate to 200 Hz with a latency of  4
s. The full trigger system reduces the data retention rate from 64 TB/s to roughly 1 GB/s.
For studies in this thesis, events are selected using single jet triggers. An overview of the
ATLAS 2012 jet trigger can be found in Figure 2.13. At L1, decisions are made using the
raw calorimeter energy in calorimeter towers (see Section 3.3) of size   = 0.2 0.2.
A sliding window algorithm is used to select local maxima, and if the maxima has E
above
threshold the event is retained, with the ROI passed to L2. In 2012 an additional L1.5 trigger,

is constructed as the vector sum of the momenta of all objects originating from the primary vertex,
assuming the initial momentum in the transverse plane is zero.
Chapter 2. The LHC and the ATLAS Experiment 38
also known as the L2 Fast Scan (L2FS) trigger, was implemented for certain trigger chains.
The L1.5 trigger reconstructs anti-k
jets using all of the L1 trigger towers as inputs, as
opposed to just the trigger towers falling inside the ROI, and passes these anti-k
jets to L2.

Figure 1: Schematic illustrating the jet trigger implementation in 2011. Jets were identified at L1 using
JEs with a sliding windows algorithm. In the original scheme, jets were found at L2 with a simple cone
jet algorithm, seeded by the L1 jets RoIs, using noise-suppressed calorimeter cells. An unseeded anti-kT
jet algorithm was run over topological clusters formed from calorimeter cells at EF independent of any
jets found at L1 or L2. In the new scheme (including L1.5), jets could also be found at L2 with an
unseeded anti-kT jet algorithm using either TTs or JEs from the L1 calorimeter system. These L1.5 jets
could be used in L2 trigger decisions and could seed L2 RoI-based jet finding.
Figure 2.13: Overview of ATLAS 2012 jet trigger [77].
At L2, anti-k
and cone jets are reconstructed using the L1 or L1.5 trigger inputs as
seeds, the energy of which are used to filter events passed to the EF. Decisions at the EF
are then performed using fully reconstructed jets. The jet trigger system is split into two
independent subsystems - the central jet triggers (|| < 3.2) and the forward jet triggers
(3.2  || < 4.9). Please see Chapter 3 for a full description of jets and their reconstruction.
Jet triggers are characterised by their turn-on curves which represent the triggers ef-
ficiency () as a function of p jetT , whereby the eciency is defined to be Npass/Nprobe, where
is the number of events that pass the trigger and N
probe
is the number of events that
pass some fully ecient probe trigger. For analyses, triggers are only used in their plat-

2.3 Simulation of the ATLAS detector
GEANT4[83] combined with the ATLAS simulation framework [84] is used to simulate the
ATLAS detector. Depositions in the detector are converted into detector signals and re-
constructed with the same format as the ATLAS detector read-out and online software.
Simulation is tuned using test-beam data and in-situ measurements. In addition to the
full GEANT4 simulation, an ATLAS fast simulation procedure, known as Atlfast-II (AFII),
designed to reduce the computational overhead required to produce MC samples, is also
implemented. AFII makes use of look-up tables to simulate correlations between variables
in the detector. Please see Reference [85] for more information. For all studies in this thesis,
only full simulation samples were used, as in 2012 AFII did not simulate the correlation
between energy deposits in the calorimeter and hits behind jets in the muon spectrometer.
2.4 Data used in this thesis
Data recorded by ATLAS during 2012 at
s = 8 TeV is used in this thesis. Data is divided
into data periods, runs and luminosity blocks. Only data deemed reliable for physics analysis
were used. In addition, data events are required to have at least one collision vertex with 2
or more tracks, with ptrackT > 150 MeV. The longitudinal position of the vertex is required to
be within 10 cm of the detector centre. In the presence of multiple pp collisions, the collision
vertex with the largest scalar sum of p2T of its associated tracks is labelled the primary vertex.
Chapter 3
Jet Reconstruction
It was mentioned in Section 1.3.2 that QCD confinement results in final state quarks and
gluons produced from proton-proton scattering manifesting as groups of collimated particles
via hadronic showers. In detectors, hadronic showers are clustered into physically meaningful
objects called jets. In order for meaningful measurements to be made using jets that can be
compared to theoretical predictions, the concept of a jet must be well defined. A schematic
representation of a jet is displayed in Figure 3.1. This Chapter details the definition, recon-
struction and the initial ATLAS 2012 calibration scheme for jets, prior to the development
of the jet punch-through correction in this thesis.
Figure 3.1: Schematic of hadrons from a hard collision clustered into a jet object [86].
The specifications that a jet definition must meet are outlined in Section 3.1. Jet defin-
itions used by ATLAS are given in Section 3.2.1. ATLAS inputs to these jet definitions
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 42
are listed in Section 3.3. A method to evaluate the calorimeter jet energy response through
comparisons with simulated particles is described in Section 3.4. The initial ATLAS 2012
jet energy scale calibration scheme, designed to obtain jets that are correctly reconstructed
at the hadronic scale, whose sensitivity to longitudinal hadronic shower leakage is studied
in this thesis, is explained in Section 3.5. Section 3.6 then describes the jet cleaning cuts
used in this thesis to ensure only real jets unaected by detector malfunctions are stud-
ied. Techniques used to identify the flavour of the jet initiating parton are discussed in
Section 3.7.
3.1 Specifications for a robust jet definition
According to the 2007 Les Houches accord [87], a jet definition must comprise of:
 A jet algorithm that clusters energy deposits or particles into a single jet object.
 A recombination scheme that defines how the four-momenta of the jet is obtained
from the sum of its constituents.
 A full specification of the jet algorithm parameters.
A robust jet definition must meet certain theoretical and experimental requirements, dis-
cussed in detail in [8891]. A brief overview of these requirements can be found below.
For a jet algorithm to be theoretically well behaved, it must be insensitive to QCD scale
eects, giving finite perturbative results at all orders, allowing for meaningful comparisons of
data with the most recent theoretical predictions. This is achieved by ensuring the algorithm
is insensitive to QCD singularities (described in Section 1.2.3) resulting from:
 Infra-red emissions, manifesting via the radiation of very low pT (soft) particles. Jet
algorithms insensitive to infra-red emissions are said to be infra-red safe. See Figure 3.2
for a schematic example of an infra-red unsafe algorithm.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 43

and one jet with (right) an infra-red emission present [88].
 Collinear emissions, manifesting as particles radiated at a very small angle with respect
to the original parton. Jet algorithms insensitive to collinear emissions are said to be
collinear safe. See Figure 3.3 for a schematic example of a collinear unsafe jet algorithm.

presence of a collinear emission (right) when compared to the case without one (left) [88].
A jet algorithm must also be order independent, reproducing the same physical results
irrespective to whether the inputs are partons, particles or calorimeter objects. In addition,
it is desirable for the jet algorithm to be invariant under longitudinal boosts along the beam
axis, aiding comparisons between the CM and lab frame.
Finally, experimental considerations such as the implementation and computational costs,
ease of calibration, as well as resilience towards eects such as calorimeter noise and pile-
up, must be considered. FastJet[92, 93] is used to employ the ATLAS jet reconstruction
software in the ATHENA framework.

3.2 Jet definition in ATLAS
As mentioned in Section 3.1, a jet definition comprises of a jet algorithm and a recombination
scheme. This section will go into detail on the jet finding algorithms and recombination
schemes used by ATLAS.
3.2.1 Jet algorithms used in ATLAS
Jet algorithms help to reduce the complexity of the final state, combining a large number of
final-state particles into a few jets. There are two broad classes of jet finding algorithms [94]
employed within ATLAS: cone algorithms and successive recombination algorithms. Each
have their own theoretical and experimental strengths that dictate their area of application.
Cone algorithms
Jets are defined as dominant directions of energy flow. For the ATLAS jet trigger software,
a simple seeded cone algorithm - the ATLAS Cone algorithm - is employed at L2 for fast jet
reconstruction (see Section 2.2.5). The ATLAS Cone algorithm can be defined as a seeded
iterative cone algorithm [95], whereby the algorithm starts at some seed object that sets
some initial direction, around which a cone of radius R in    space is drawn and the
four-momenta of all particles in this cone summed. The resultant sum is used as the new
seed direction, and the process is iterated until the direction of the resultant cone is stable
(does not change significantly between successive iterations). The seed is chosen to be the
highest pT input and must be above the 1 GeV threshold.
The resultant jets may overlap, sharing constituents. In order to rectify this, a split-
merge step is performed in which two jets are merged if more than a fraction (f) of the pT of
softer jet is overlapped with the harder jet, otherwise the shared constituents are given to
the closer jet. For ATLAS, f = 0.5.
The issue with this algorithm is that while being collinear safe, it not infra-red safe.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 45
However, the low computational time associated with this algorithm make it useful for jet
finding when making trigger decisions, where fast computational times are essential.
Sequential recombination algorithms
Jets are formed by defining a distance between pairs of input objects (d
) and performing
successive recombinations of the pair of closest input objects, only stopping when all resulting
objects are farther apart than some threshold distance, set by the distance between the object
and the Beam (d
1). Common d
and d
parametrisations are shown in Equations 3.1
and 3.2 respectively:
= min(p2
, p2
, (3.1)
= p2
, (3.2)
where i and j are indices of the objects under consideration, pT is the transverse momentum
of the object, R
is the spatial distance between the objects in  space,  is a parameter
that governs the relative power between the energy and geometric scales, and R is a pre-
defined distance parameter - larger R values result in wider jets.
Three commonly used values of  are 1, 0 and +1, which give the anti-k
[96], Cam-
bridge/Aachen [97] (C/A) and k
[98] algorithms respectively. The dierences in these three
algorithms are down to the momentum weighting and constituent ordering. The anti-k
and k
algorithms are pT ordered, whereby the anti-kt algorithm clusters begins with high
pT constituents, while the kt algorithm does the opposite, beginning with low pT constituents
(eectively reversing the QCD parton shower). This is contrasting to the C/A algorithm
that is angular-ordered, relying only on distance weighting.
Figure 3.4 shows an example of the anti-k
and C/A jet algorithms with R = 1,
1B represents Beam
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 46
clustering random soft ghost particles into jets in a simulated event. The anti-k
algorithm
gives circular jets, whereas the C/A and k
algorithms give somewhat irregular shaped jets.
Figure 3.4: A sample parton-level event, together with many random soft ghosts, clustered
with three dierent jet algorithms - k
(top-left), C/A (top-right), and anti-k
(bottom). The
distance parameters (R) are set to 1. Illustrated are the active catchment areas of the
resulting hard jets [96].
The sequential recombination algorithms are all infra-red and collinear safe, and require
no split/merge step. Anti-k
jets are preferred for ATLAS analyses as they demonstrated
the best overall performance in the detailed studies performed in [99]. In addition, their
circular shape allows for a well defined jet area useful in pile-up subtraction techniques (see
Section 3.5.2). One downside of the anti-k
jet algorithm is the sensitivity to calorimeter
noise, however this is compensated for through the use of noise suppressed inputs, as detailed
in Section 3.3. Anti-k
jets with R = 0.4 and R = 0.6 are the focus of the calibration studies
in this thesis, and were the most widely used by ATLAS analyses during Run I.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 47
3.2.2 Recombination scheme
ATLAS uses the four-vector recombination scheme to obtain the final jet four-momenta
from the sum of its components four-momenta, producing a massive jet. This is the most
widespread recombination scheme [95] as recommended by [88].
In the four-vector recombination scheme, the jet four-momenta is calculated as the sum
of the four-momenta of its constituents:
constitX
(3.3)
where N
constit
is the total number of constituents that form the final jet, P
is the four-
momenta of the i-th constituent, and P
is the final jet four-momenta.

physical input objects. In ATLAS, commonly used input objects include tracks, stable
particles2 generated by Monte Carlo event generators, and calorimeter based inputs, from
which jet finding produces track jets, truth jets and calorimeter jets respectively. Figure 3.5
shows a schematic of this. The most widely used calorimeter input objects for jet finding in
ATLAS are topological clusters, topoclusters [102104], from which topojets are produced.
An alternative calorimeter input exists in the form of towers [102], groups of calorimeter
cells bounded by a fixed two-dimensional grid in    space, however these are used less
frequently due to their increased sensitivity to noise. Therefore, only topojets formed from
topoclusters are used in this thesis.
Topoclusters are groups of calorimeter cells designed to follow the shower development,
taking advantage of the fine segmentation of the fine ATLAS hadronic calorimeter. They
follow a 420 signal-to-noise ratio (t 3) pattern, designed to find eciently low energy clusters
without being overwhelmed by noise. Seed cells are selected to have a signal-to-noise ratio
> 4, to which neighbouring cells with a signal-to-noise ratio of t
neighbour
are iteratively added, forming a proto-cluster. Next, all cells neighbouring this proto-cluster
are added (t
> 0). Local maxima cells within these proto-clusters are then identified.
Proto-clusters containing more than one local maxima are split, using the local maxima as
seeds for a new iteration of topoclustering. Final topoclusters are formed from the resultant
proto-clusters, whereby the topocluster four-vectors are constructed with energy equal to
the sum of the energy of the constituent cells, zero mass and direction as that of the unit
vector pointing from the centre of the ATLAS co-ordinate system to the energy-weighted
topocluster barycentre [105].
Two topocluster collections are formed, one at the EM-scale, and one at the LocalCluster
Weighting (LCW) scale. EM-scale topoclusters are obtained by clustering cells calibrated
at the EM-scale as described in Reference [106]. LCW-scale topoclusters are then built by
taking the EM-scale topoclusters and applying a local signal cluster weight to the calorimeter

cells within these clusters, designed to correctly reconstruct the response of the calorimeter
to hadrons. The weight aims to improve the resolution compared with the EM-scale, and is
assigned based on whether a cluster is identified as electromagnetic or hadronic in nature,
determined from the energy density and shower shape. For hadronic clusters, the weight is
a correction aimed at accounting for the non-compensating nature of the ATLAS detector.
For both electromagnetic and hadronic clusters, the weight compensates for energy falling
outside clustered cells, estimated from how isolated a cluster is, and energy falling outside the
active areas of the calorimeter 4, determined from the position and energy deposited in each
layer of the calorimeter. The weight is derived from neutral and charged pion interactions
simulated using Geant4 [105, 107].
Studying the calibration and performance of ATLAS topojets punching through the
calorimeter is the focus of this thesis. Truth jets are invaluable reference objects in these
studies, used to form a jet energy response (see Section 3.4). Truth jets used in this thesis
do not include stable muons and neutrinos for consistency with the ATLAS jet calibration
(Section 3.5).
3.4 Association of truth jets to calorimeter jets
Truth jets in Monte Carlo can be matched to calorimeter jets to provide information on a
jets constituent particles. For studies in this thesis, this is done via one of two procedures:
1. Ghost matching: This involves artificially spraying the calorimeter with particles
of infinitesimally small p
(ghost particles), reclustering the particle and calorimeter
jets, and then counting the number of overlapping particles. If > 50% of the particles
overlap between a given truth and calorimeter jet, these jets are said to be matched.
2. Geometrical matching: Calorimeter jets are matched to truth jets within a cone
of R < 0.3. Matching is performed in order of decreasing jet pT, discarding jets
4This correction is expected to have some sensitivity to jet punch-through. It will be shown in Appendix D
that LCW jets after the full jet calibration scheme still display energy losses due to jet punch-through.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 50
that have already been matched; ambiguities are resolved by choosing the jet with the
highest pT as the match.
Matching truth jets with calorimeter jets allows the reconstructed level jet properties to
be compared with the particle level jet properties, allowing the jet energy response (R) and
jet pT response (RpT ) to be defined as:
R = Ecalo
truth
pcaloT
ptruthT
, (3.4)
where E
(pcaloT ) and Etruth (p
truth
T ) are the energy (pT) of the calorimeter jet and its
associated truth jet5 respectively. The jet response provides a measure of the calorimeter
response to jets, and is used as a basis for the jet energy calibration, described in Section 3.5.
The detector eects mentioned in Section 3.5 can cause the measured jet energy, and thus
jet response, to fluctuate, resulting in a Gaussian distribution, as shown in Figure 3.6. The
magnitude of these fluctuations can be used as a measure of the jet energy resolution (jet
pT resolution), parametrised as the standard deviation of a Gaussian fit to the jet response
distribution, R (R
). The fitting procedure is described in detail in Section 5.4. The
resolution is commonly assessed via the fractional resolution, RR (
). The final ATLAS
2012 JER measurement is described in Section 8.3.

Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 51
It is important to note that this jet response is not sensitive to escaped energy due to
muons and neutrinos, a consequence of using truth jets without muons and neutrinos.
3.5 Initial ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale calibration
As mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter is non-compensating,
having a lower response to hadrons when compared with electrons due to the additional
non-ionising hadronic interaction present in hadronic showers, not found in electromagnetic
showers (see Section 1.3). This section will detail the derivation of a set of corrections that,
in addition to restoring the correct hadronic energy scale - the Jet Energy Scale (JES) -
from the electromagnetic scale, also aim to remove additional detector eects, including:
 Additional energy deposits due to in-time and out-of-time pile-up.
 Energy losses due to inactive detector regions (dead material).
 Signal losses in calorimeter clustering and jet reconstruction.
 Energy deposits of particles not included in the jet reconstruction.
 Dierences in energy reconstruction due to jet flavour (gluon or quark initiated jets).
 Energy losses due to longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, aecting jets in the tail of
the jet response distribution. Please note the initial 2012 calibration described in this
section was originally still sensitive to these eects, as will be shown in Chapter 4. The
development of a correction to remove these eects is the focus of this thesis.
The initial ATLAS jet calibration scheme in 2012 was a multi-stage procedure, involving
Monte Carlo corrections derived using the baseline Pythia8 samples (described in Sec-
tion 1.4). The calibration can be applied to jets clustered from topoclusters at both the EM
and LCW scales. The calibration scheme is outlined in Figure 8.1.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 52
First, the jet direction is corrected to point back to the primary vertex via the Origin
Correction, as explained in Section 3.5.1. Next, the eect of pile-up is removed through
the jet area based and residual pile-up corrections, described in Section 3.5.2. The jet
energy is then restored to the correct hadronic scale using the Absolute EtaJES correction,
as outlined in Section 3.5.3. The Global Sequential (GS) corrections are then applied, a
sequence of four corrections that aim to reduce flavour dependencies of the jet energy scale
and improve the jet energy resolution, detailed in Section 3.5.4.

the GS corrections are labelled EM+JES+GS (EM+JES) and LCW+JES+GS (LCW+JES)
jets respectively.
3.5.1 Origin correction
As mentioned in Section 3.3, topoclusters, and thus topojets, are reconstructed to have four-
vectors pointing towards the geometrical centre of the ATLAS detector. The jet four-vector
is corrected such that the direction of the jet points towards the hard-scatter primary vertex
(defined in Section 2.2.2). The origin correction achieves this by recalculating the kinematic
variables for each topocluster using a vector constructed with the primary vertex to the
topocluster centroid as its direction. The jet four-vector is then re-defined as the vector
sum of the modified topocluster four-vectors. The correction dramatically improves the jet
 resolution whilst leaving the jet energy unaected.

origin
or , while
the  coordinate of the jet vector pointing towards the geometrical centre of the ATLAS
detector is referred to as 
3.5.2 Pile-up corrections
Due to the calorimeters long integration time, objects reconstructed from calorimeter de-
positions are especially susceptible to in-time and out-of-time pile-up (described in Sec-
tion 2.1.1). Pile-up can degrade the jet energy resolution, in addition to shifting the jet
energy scale. Such pile-up eects must be corrected for.
The pile-up correction in the ATLAS 2012 jet calibration scheme consists of two parts,
outlined in detail in [109, 110]. The first is an area based subtraction technique based on the
assumption that pile-up energy depositions can be treated as a uniform, diuse background,
adding signal to the jets. This diuse background is characterised by measuring the pile-up
energy density in the calorimeter in the    plane, 6 , and the measured jet area in this
plane, A7.
The second part in the pile-up correction is a residual -dependent correction designed
to remove any lingering dependence of the jet pT on in-time and out-of-time pile-up. The
dependence on in-time pile-up is characterised by the number of reconstructed primary
vertices, N
, through the factor  (N
 1). Out-of-time pile-up is accounted for via
hi, where hi is the average number of interactions per bunch crossing. The full pile-up
correction is given by:
pcorrT = pT  A  (NPV  1) hi, (3.5)
where pcorrT is the pile-up corrected pT of the jet [110].
6 is defined to be the median of the jet energy density, 
, where p
and Ajet are the p
Voronoi measured jet area [111] respectively of an anti-k
jet with R = 0.4 reconstructed in the central
detector region (|
| < 2).
7A is calculated using an active areas method in which ghost particles, are uniformly added to an event
and jets in the event reclustered. The fraction of ghosts clustered in each jet gives an indication of A.
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 54
3.5.3 Jet energy scale correction
The jet energy scale correction aims to correct the calorimeter jet four-vector back to the
particle level scale, restoring the correct hadronic energy scale. It uses the jet energy response
as defined in Equation 3.4 as a basis, and produces jets at the EM+JES and LCW+JES
scales from EM and LCW jets respectively.
Only isolated truth and calorimeter jets are used for the calibration. An isolated calor-
imeter jet is defined to be one with no other calorimeter jet with uncalibrated p jetT > 7
GeV within a cone of R < 1.5 R, where R is the jet radius. Similarly, an isolated truth
jet must have no other truth jets with ptruthT > 7 GeV within a cone of R < 2.5 R.
In order to evaluate the jet energy response as defined in Equation 3.4, calorimeter jets
are matched to truth jets geometrically as described in Section 3.4. For EM jets, the JES
correction uses the jet energy response at the EM-scale, R
, formed from the EM-scale
calorimeter energy of the jet, EEM
, as its basis. The average EM-scale response, hR
is measured from the mean of a Gaussian fit to the R
distribution in bins of E
truth
. For each (E
truth
)-bin, the average EM-scale jet energy, hEEM
i, is also measured
from the mean of the EEM
distribution. The calibration function, F
calib,k
, is obtained
from a fit to the mean EM-scale response as a function of the average EM-scale jet energy,
i, in each 
bin k. For LCW jets, the jet energy response at the LCW-scale,
, is used instead, formed from the LCW-scale calorimeter energy of the jet, ELCW
The correction function, F
calib,k
, is then formed in the same way as for the EM
calibration. The fitting function used is parametrised as [105]:
calib,k
EEM or LCW
ln EEM or LCW
(3.6)
where 
are free parameters, and N
is chosen between 1 and 6 depending on the goodness
of fit. The final jet energy scale correction, relating the measured calorimeter jet to the true
energy, in each 
-bin, is then defined as 1/F

At this stage, an additional -correction is applied to remove biases in the reconstructed
 of jets, introduced by under-measured EM-scale energies of topoclusters in poorly instru-
mented regions of the detector. The correction is derived as the average  = 
truth
origin
in (E

)-bins, parametrised as a function of 
[105]. As well as removing the biases
in , the correction also brings the pT response closer to 1 (improved closure).
Figure 3.8 displays the pT response as a function of p
truth
after the application of the jet
energy scale corrections for R = 0.6 EM jets. It is important to note that there is still some
inherent non-closure for jets with ptruth
< 100 GeV that grows as ptruth
decreases. This is
due to non-Gaussian and noise threshold eects causing poor fits at low ptruth
[108]. Similar
eects are seen when looking at the jet energy response as a function of E

The Global Sequential (GS) corrections [1] form the final step in the initial 2012 ATLAS
jet calibration sequence. They are a series of four sequential corrections that aim to further
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 56
improve the JER by removing multiple eects that impact the jet energy measurement,
including energy loss in inactive areas of the detector, and the flavour of the parton initiating
the jet. This is achieved by removing the jet response dependence on any jet property, x,
that is sensitive to these eects. One jet property is used for each step, giving four steps in
total. In order:

2. ntrk: The number of tracks associated to jets is sensitive to the flavour of the jet-

), while
Light-Quark (LQ) initiated jets tend to have fewer particles (smaller n
) [112].
3. widthtrk: The tracking jet width, widthtrk, is defined as the average distance between
the tracks associated to the jet and the calorimeter jet axis, weighted by the track
pT. widthtrk is defined in Equation 3.9, where i refers to the tracks and R(i, jet) =q
(jet  track, i)2 + (jet  track, i)2. Close to a transition region, it provides an in-
dication of how many particles hit poorly instrumented regions.

The variables used, the detector regions they are applied to, as well as the order in which
they are applied, are summarized in Table 3.1. The improvement in performance does not
depend on the sequence in which the corrections are applied.

For jets at the LCW+JES scale, only the track based corrections are applied, as the LCW
calibration (described in Section 3.3) already includes a dead material correction, resulting
in no further improvement in resolution from the calorimeter corrections.
The GS corrections are multiplicative, derived by inverting the jet response as a function
of x, C(x) = R1(x). The corrections are relative to the JES correction in Section 3.5.3. They
are binned in |
| and constructed as a function of p jetT and jet property x, Frel(p jetT , x). The
response is obtained from the mean of a Gaussian fit to the response distribution evaluated
in bins of |
|, ptruth
and jet property x. The function Frel is then constructed in bins of
| using a sequence of two Gaussian kernels: a one-dimensional Gaussian kernel followed
by a two dimensional Gaussian kernel. The final correction function is defined via:
Frel(p jetT , x) =
i=1 CiwiP

(3.10)
with the final two dimensional Gaussian kernel, w
, defined to be:

and hxi
are the average pT and x of the jets in each bin, Gauss(x) is the amplitude of a
Gaussian function with  = 0 and  = 1, 
and 
are width-parameters of the Gaussian
kernel and  denotes addition in quadrature [1]. The kernel-width parameters used were
found to capture the shape of the response across  and p jetT , and at the same time provide
stability against statistical fluctuations [1].
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 58
The procedure requires that the correction for variable x
(F irel) is calculated using jets
to which the correction for variable x
i1 (F i1rel ) has already been applied. The jet transverse
momentum after correction number i is given by [1]:
piT = F irel(xi) pi1T = F irel(xi) F i1rel (xi1) pi2T = ... (3.12)
3.6 Jet cleaning
In order to eectively study the impact of punch-through jets, it was important to ensure
jets used were not fake, and not poorly measured due to detector eects other than jet
punch-through, such as calorimeter noise spikes, or dead tile regions. Fake jets include
energy deposits coming from groups of noisy cells in calorimeters, cosmic muons and beam
backgrounds. A combination of jet cleaning cuts were used to remove such jets. The cleaning
cuts used an extension of those found in Ref. [113]. A jet passing these cuts is deemed good.
Bad jet rejection
Bad jets are due to background or detector eects. Rejection of bad jets involves:

Ugly jet rejection
Ugly jets are poorly measured jets falling into problematic detector regions.

permanently oine cells are masked during jet reconstruction and their energy is es-

not fully understood, thus jets depositing > 50% of their energy in this region are
rejected.
Rejecting jets over-corrected by masked cell correction
As mentioned above, cells aected by high voltage trips and permanently oine cells are
masked during jet reconstruction. In 2012, the correction responsible for estimating the
energy of these masked cells was unable to correctly handle entire dead cells. As high pT jets
are more collimated, they are more sensitive to this overcorrection. The presence of these
over-corrected jets can bias the jet response. They are rejected by vetoing jets falling into
masked tile regions. This masking is done artificially in MC to prevent biasing data/MC
comparisons.
Additional pile-up rejection cuts
The Jet Vertex Fraction (JVF) is the fraction of summed track pT for all tracks matched
to a given jet and associated with the Primary Vertex (PV), relative to the total summed
pT for all tracks matched to the jet [110]:
JV F (jet
pT(track
pT(track
(3.13)
where JV F (jet
) is the JVF defined for each given jet
with respect to the primary
vertex PV
. The JVF is close to 1 for hard scatter jets, and close to 0 for pile-up jets. A cut
on the JVF can be used to reject spurious calorimeter jets resulting from local fluctuations in
pile-up activity, as well as real QCD jets originating from single pileup interactions, resulting
in improved stability of the reconstructed jet multiplicity against pile-up [110].
Chapter 3. Jet Reconstruction 61
Removal of excess overlaid pile-up events in MC
In MC, the reconstructed pT spectra are not smooth at low pT due to overlaid pileup events.
These are a result of pileup causing jets from lower pT samples to migrate to higher pT
bins. These jets then acquire larger Monte Carlo weights (Equation 1.10), distorting the pT
spectra. To remove these problematic events, it was required that pavgT /p
leading truth

where pavgT = (p
T )/2, p
leading truth
T ) is the truth (reconstructed) pT of the highest
pT jet and p
T is the pT of the second highest pT jet.
3.7 Flavour tagging
It is necessary to use tagging methods when attempting to study eects resulting from
the flavour of the jet-initiating parton. This is done dierently at truth level in MC and
reconstructtion level in data:
 Truth flavour tagging: The jet flavour is determined by geometrically matching
the jet with generator level hadrons/partons: if a b-hadron is found within a cone
of R < R of the jet, where R is the radius parameter of the jet algorithm, the
jet is labelled as a b-jet. If no b-hadron is found, the procedure is repeated for c-
hadrons. If no such association can be made for a jet, the highest energy parton from
the event generator before the parton shower that points to the jet determines its
flavour. This definition is sucient to study the flavour dependence of the calorimeter
response to jets. Theoretical ambiguities of jet flavour assignment are irrelevant in this
context [112].
 b-jet tagging in data: To identify b-jets, the MV1 tagger was used. MV1 is a neural-
network algorithm that integrates the output of several simple tagging algorithms (SV1,
JetFitter, IP3D) to exploit dierent features (reconstructed vertex, impact parameter)
of the jet during tagging. More information of the performance of the MV1 algorithm
can be found here [116, 117]. MV1 was used at a 70% eciency operating point.
Chapter 4
Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet
Reconstruction
Jets clustered from hadronic showers experiencing longitudinal leakage are called punch-
through jets. It was shown in Section 1.3.3 that longitudinal shower leakage reduces the
mean energy and energy resolution of objects involving hadronic showers, and so is expected
to have a similar impact on energy measurements using jets.
This chapter outlines studies that test how sensitive the initial ATLAS 2012 jet energy
scale calibration described in Section 3.5 is to jet punch-through eects. First, the methods
used to study punch-through jets with reconstructed dectector variables are explained in
Section 4.1. The investigation into the sensitivity of the initial ATLAS 2012 jet energy
scale to jet punch-through eects is outlined in Section 4.2, focusing on the impact of jet
punch-through on the mean jet energy response and jet energy resolution.
4.1 Identifying punch-through jets
In order to assess the impact of jet punch-through on the jet energy scale and jet energy res-
olution, and to develop a correction applicable to both data and Monte Carlo, it is necessary
to identify reconstruction level variables that capture the dependence of the jet response on
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 63
jet punch-through. Such variables fall into two distinct categories, associated with:
 Muon activity behind the jet: Charged particles in the longitudinal tail of the
hadronic shower penetrating into the muon spectrometer will generate muon hits and
segments, N
and N
segments
respectively. The number of hits/segments present is
indicative of the amount of leakage.
 Shower profile in calorimeter: Showers that start later in the calorimeter are more
likely to experience leakage. Thus a large fraction of a jets energy deposited in the
final layers of the hadronic calorimeter, a small fraction of energy deposited in the
EM calorimeter, or the shower maximum occurring in the outer layers of the hadronic
calorimeter, are all suggestive a jet may be punching-through.
Initial studies outlined in Appendix B showed some dependence of the jet energy response
on calorimeter variables linked to jet punch-through, however the variables that showed
promise were limited to the central detector regions (|
| < 1.4). As a result, the muon
activity behind a jet was used as the primary discriminator to study jet punch-through in
this thesis. Variables used to quantify the muon activity behind a jet, a concrete definition of
a punch-through jet based upon these variables, and an estimation of the jet punch-through
probability for dijet events are outlined below. All plots in this section were made using the
same data, MC and dijet, selection outlined in Section 6.2.
4.1.1 Reconstructing muon activity behind jets (Nsegments)
Two main variables are used to measure the level of muon activity behind a jet: the number
of muon hits, N
, and the number of muon segments, N
segments
, found behind a jet in the
muon spectrometer. Muon hits occur when charged particles pass through the muon spectro-
meter. Muon segments are partial tracks constructed from muon hits. Muon spectrometer
chambers with intersecting regions of activity in the detector, such as MDTs with hits in
concurrent multi-layers (see Section 2.2.4), are selected for segment reconstruction [118, 119].
Association of muon hits and segments to jets is done in two steps:
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 64
1. Building the muon shower containers: Segments found to be within a cone of
R < 0.4, and hits found to be within  < /8 and  < /8, of an anti-k
R = 0.6
jet, are filled into muon shower containers during the event reconstruction. The 
and  coordinates of a muon shower container correspond to the those of the anti-k
R = 0.6 jet to which they are associated in this step. In Run I, muon shower containers
were only reconstructed for anti-k
R = 0.6 jets with p jetT > 50 GeV at the EM+JES
or LCW+JES scale. These containers had to be associated to jets with dierent R
sizes.
2. Association of muon shower container to a jet: Muon shower containers are said
to originate from the closest jet within a cone of R < 0.3. No more than one muon
shower container is associated to each jet. The number of muon segments and hits
within the selected container correspond to the number of muon segments and hits
associated to the given jet.

The plots in Figure 4.2 were produced using MC samples overlaid with backgrounds from
data. The full procedure used to generate these samples is described in Ref. [120]. Much
better agreement is seen for both N
segments
and N
, with a drastic improvement seen in the
shape agreement for N
. The impact is smaller for N
segments
, likely due to inherent noise
filtering present in the algorithms used to reconstruct N
segments
[118, 119]. This confirms the
large shape dierences seen for N
are due to poorly modelled backgrounds:
 Lack of accurate noise simulation of hits in muon chambers in MC.
 Out of time pileup in muon spectrometer not well described in MC.
 Presence of beam background in data not well simulated in MC.
As a result, N
was not used for studies in this thesis. Figure 4.3 shows the reconstruc-
ted muon segment eciency as a function of 
for data and MC. Good agreement can be
seen, with a general reconstruction eciency of above 99%. This confirms N
segments
is a well
modelled, eciently reconstructed variable.

the shower (and thus jet) initiating parton, and the amount of material the shower passes

dependent, largest for high energy jets in poorly instrumented 
regions.
Figure 4.4 compares the jet punch-through probability defined to be the fraction of jets
with one or more particles entering the muon spectrometer measured in MC simulation [122],
with plots of N

and the amount of material the jet is presumed to have

probability, as expected from Equation 1.7, that the punch-through probability increases as
the energy of the initiating particle increases. This is mirrored in N
segments
which increases
as the jet energy increases.
Comparing the punch-through probability vs 
from MC with Figure 2.7 confirms the
probability is largest in poorly instrumented regions of the detector (1.3  |
| < 1.9).
Again, this is mirrored when looking at N
segments
, where N
segments
is larger in poorly
instrumented regions of the detector. Spikes are also present when looking at N
segments
where there is less material, and the jet punch-through probability is larger. Data and
MC appear to agree relatively well in these plots.

Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 68
The above observations are highly suggestive that N
segments
is linked with the occurrence
of jet punch-through. For this reason, N
segments
is used as the primary discriminator for jet
punch-through in this thesis. The final thing to consider when using N
segments
is background
processes that could produce segments behind a jet in the muon spectrometer. One key
background comes from the presence of b-quarks in the sample.
The weak mixing of quark flavours is governed by the mixing angles in the Cabibbo-
Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [123, 124]. Thus b-quark decays to c and u quarks
are constrained by the CKM up-bottom and charm-bottom mixing angles, |V
| and |V
respectively. |V
| = (40.9  1.1)  103 [100] and |V
| = (4.15  0.49)  103 [100] are
both small ( 1), resulting in b-decays to c and u quarks being heavily suppressed. As
weak decays to electrons are also suppressed due to chirality, b-quarks preferentially decay
into muons, which can produce hits and segments in the muon spectrometer behind the jet
associated with the b-quark (b-jets). For this thesis, these muons do not constitute leakage
of the hadronic shower associated with the b-jet, and so the additional hits and segments
they produce constitute an additional background that must be avoided.

can be seen the fraction of b-jets appears to increase from 1-10 segments, at which point
segments
declines until N
segments
 20. For N
segments
 20, the fraction of b-jets appears to
stabilise. Real muons are expected to have between three and six segments associated with
them, which suggests the observed behaviour is due to the muon produced in the b-decay.
As we are looking to study the eects of real hadronic shower leakage, as opposed to muons
produced from b-decays, N
segments
 20 is used as an operating point for many studies in
this thesis. The exact requirements used to define a punch-through jet in the context of this
thesis are detailed in the next section.
4.1.2 Defining a punch-through jet
In order to eectively study the impact of jet punch-through, it is important to define what
is meant by a punch-through jet in the context of the work described in this thesis. It was
shown in Section 4.1.1 that N
segments
shows correlations expected from a variable related to a
jet punching-through into the muon spectrometer. Thus, N
segments
is the main discriminator
used to select and study punch-through jets in this thesis. In doing this, the following two
limitations on N
segments
must be considered:
1. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, during Run I muon shower containers were only recon-
structed for jets with p jetT > 50 GeV at the EM+JES or LCW+JES scale. As a result,
segments
information is only available for jets with p jetT > 50 GeV.
2. Figure 4.5 shows the fraction of b-jets stabilised when N
segments
 20. This sug-
gests that in the region N
segments
< 20, N
segments
cannot be used independently to
discriminate between real hadronic shower leakage and b-jet decays.
Based upon these two observations, a punch-through jet is defined to be a jet with
segments
 20 and p jetT > 50 GeV. This because for jets with pT < 50 GeV, no Nsegments
information is available. In addition, this ensures only jets experiencing real hadronic shower
leakage as opposed to leakage due to b-jet decays are selected. From this point, any reference
to a punch-through jet refers to any jet meeting this specification.
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 70
4.1.3 Estimating a jet punch-through probability
In order to understand the prevalence of jet punch-through within the ATLAS detector at
s = 8 TeV in both data and MC, it is useful to define the fraction of punch-through jets,
or jet punch-through probability, as:
punchthrough =
N jets(N
segments
 20)
N jets(N
segments
 0) , (4.1)
where P
punchthrough is the fraction of jets with Nsegments  20 (punch-through probability),
N jets(N
segments
 20) is the number of jets with N
segments
 20 and N jets(N
segments
is the total number of jets.

Figure 4.6 displays the fraction of punch-through jets (or P

increases as the jet energy increases (as expected from Figure 4.4), and is largest in the

at low E to 10% at high E, and is lowest in the forward region - 1.9  |

4.2 Jet punch-through and the measured jet energy
As described in Section 4.1, N
segments
is used as a measure of the muon activity behind a jet,
and thus to quantify the extent to which a jet is punching-through the calorimeter. Thus the
impact of jet punch-through can be studied by assessing the dependence of the jet energy
scale and jet energy resolution on N
segments
. These studies are only done for punch-through
jets as defined in Section 4.1.2. The nominal Pythia8 dijet Monte Carlo samples were used,
with the MC dijet event selection detailed in Section 6.2 applied. Only information from the
two leading jets in each event was used.
For all studies in this section, as opposed to being extracted from a fit, all mean values
are calculated as the weighted mean:
hxi =
(4.2)
where hxi is the weighted mean of x, w
is the weight (in this case the MC weight given in
Equation 1.10) and x
is the bin centre for the i-th bin in the histogram. The RMS, for the
purposes of this thesis, is defined to be the standard deviation of the distribution, calculated
RMS(x) = 
 hxi)2 (4.3)
where 
is the standard deviation of x, x
is the bin centre for the i-th bin and N
is the

4.2.1 Jet energy mis-measurement due to jet punch-through
The magnitude of energy loss due to jet punch-through is measured using two variables:
 The jet energy response as defined in Equation 3.4 is used to assess the fraction of a
jets energy lost due to jet punch-through. A jet energy response below 1 for jets with
large N
segments
will be a good indicator that the jet energy is being under-measured
due to jet punch-through.
 The magnitude of energy lost by a jet due to jet punch-through, E
truth
(4.5)
where E
truth
is truth energy of the jet, and E
is the reconstructed calorimeter jet
energy calibrated at the EM+JES+GS or LCW+JES+GS scale. This definition is not
perfect, and is sensitive to noise. The main function of this variable is to provide an al-
ternative measure of the imbalance between the truth jet energy and the reconstructed
jet energy that can be used to determine how the imbalance changes with N
segments
As such, this variable will only be used to crudely assess the magnitude of energy lost
due to jet punch-through in conjunction with the jet energy response.
It is important to note that both of these variables, as they use truth jets without muons
and neutrinos, will not be sensitive to energy losses due to escaped energy (see Section 1.3.2).
This is ideal, as for the purposes of this thesis, escaped energy is not considered under
longitudinal hadronic shower leakage.
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 73
In Section 4.1.1, it was shown that N
segments
is correlated with the jet punch-through
probability. Thus by looking at how these two variables correlate with N
segments
, the extent
to which energy leakage due to jet punch-through aects the jet energy scale can be assessed.

is dependant on E

. From the top-left plot in Figure 4.7, it is clear the fraction
of energy lost decreases as E

increases, with up to 25% losses observed for jets with
200  E
truth
[ GeV] < 400. However the bottom-left plot shows that although a smaller
fraction of energy is lost by higher energy jets, the magnitude of energy loss is still larger
at high E
truth
. The top-right plot in Figure 4.7 shows the |
< 1.3 and |
> 1.9
regions appear to display the largest energy losses due to jet punch-through, even though
it was observed in Figure 4.6 that jets in the region 1.3  |
| < 1.9 displayed the
highest jet punch-through probability. This is likely due to the reduced material in the
1.3  |
| < 1.9 region, resulting in a larger number of low energy particles leaking into
the muon spectrometer. This produces more muon segments, but with smaller energy losses,
thus causing higher response jets to appear in higher N
segments
bins.
4.2.2 Eect on jet energy response tails
It has been shown that jet punch-through causes a reduction in the measured mean jet energy
response. However, it is expected jet punch-through will also result in jet-by-jet fluctuations
of the response, whereby punch-through jets will have a lower reconstructed energy, resulting
in a jet energy response of < 1. This can artificially inflate the low response tail (R < 1).
This is investigated by looking at the percentage of events within the response distribution
that fall below a given response value, called the response threshold (Response thr) for the
purpose of these studies. By varying the response threshold and comparing the fraction of
events below the threshold in dierent N
segments
bins, it is possible to study the impact of
jet punch-through on the tails of the distribution. This is eectively comparing how the
cumulative frequency distribution of the response changes with N
segments
In Figure 4.8, the response threshold is varied from 0.2 to 1 in increments of 0.2 for an
example response distribution. The response threshold is annotated by the dotted red line,
with the corresponding fraction of events below this threshold represented by the shaded
region. The bottom-right plot in Figure 4.8 shows the fraction of events in these shaded
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 75
regions plotted against the corresponding response threshold. As expected, as the response
threshold increases, the number of events below threshold increases.

4.2.3 Degradation of jet energy resolution due to jet punch-through
It was seen in the previous section that energy losses due to jet punch-through increase the
fluctuation in the measured jet energy, contributing to the low response tail in the jet energy
response distribution, consistent with what we expect from Section 1.3.3. This eect can
degrade the jet energy resolution. Thus it is important to study the impact of jet punch-
through on the jet energy resolution. The jet energy resolution, r, is defined in this context
in terms of the RMS of the jet energy response:
RMS(R)
hRi (4.6)
where RMS(R) is the RMS (as defined in Equation 4.3) of the jet energy response and hRi
is the mean jet energy response. In the remainder of this thesis, comparisons between jet
energy resolution values are often made by taking the dierence between the two resolution
values in quadrature, whilst also taking into account the sign of the dierence:

grading. As with the response, the eect as a function of N
segments
is worse for lower E

jets, with the resolution increasing from  6% to  18% - a degradation of up to 300%. The
degradation as a function of N
segments
is worst in the region 1.3  |
| < 1.9. Although
the degradation depends on |
| and E
truth
as a function of N
segments
, when looking at the
resolution vs percentage of energy loss, there appears to be very little dependency on E
truth
Poor statistics plague the 1.9  |
| < 2.7 region. Overall, a very clear degradation
can be seen as the percentage of energy loss increases. These observations are consistent
with those discussed in Reference [48] (see Section 1.3.3), where the resolution was seen to
degrade by up to 200% due to longitudinal hadronic shower leakage.
4.2.4 Flavour dependencies
The flavour of the jet initiating parton can impact the jet constituents, changing the com-
position of the charged particles that may penetrate the muon spectrometer in the event of
a jet punching through the calorimeter. This can impact the observed correlation between
the jet energy response and N
segments
. Thus it is important to study how jet flavour aects
this relationship.
In this section, jets are tagged using the truth flavour tagging prescription in Section 3.7.
Jets tagged as originating from an up, down or strange quark are labelled as Light Quark
(LQ) jets, b-jets are those tagged to be originating from a b-hadron and gluon jets are those
tagged to be originating from a gluon. It is important to note that the samples used were
dominated by LQ-jets for jets with E
truth
> 400 GeV. For jets with E
truth
< 400 GeV, LQ
and gluon jets are dominant, with gluon jets becoming progressively more dominant at lower
truth
. In addition, at high ptruth
(ptruth
> 200 GeV), the GS corrections (see Section 3.5.4)
reduce the dierence between the LQ and gluon jet response to below 1%, and thus very
large dierences in the jet response due to flavour are not expected (see Ref. [1] for more
information).
Figure 4.12 shows how the jet energy response as a function of N
segments
varies for LQ,
b and gluon jets in comparison with the inclusive jet sample. The comparison is made
Chapter 4. Impact of Jet Punch-Through on Jet Reconstruction 80
for jets with 600  E
truth
[ GeV] < 800 and 1600  E
truth
[ GeV] < 2000 in the
0  |
| < 0.6 and 1.3  |
| < 1.9 regions. As the sample is dominated by LQ-jets
in these E
truth
regions, we see a clear bias of the inclusive jet response towards the LQ-jet
response. In all regions, the LQ-jet response displays the strongest negative correlation with
segments
. The b-jet and gluon-jet response is generally in agreement to within errors. The
dierence between the LQ, b and gluon jet response is smaller at low N
segments
. Overall these
plots suggest that particles leaking from LQ-jets deposit fewer segments when compared with
particles carrying the same amount of energy, but leaking from b and gluon jets. However,
it is important to remember that the jet energy response defined here does not take into
account muons and neutrinos escaping the calorimeter. Including muons and neutrinos in
the truth jet collections used would cause the b-jet response to shift to lower values, a result
of the escaped muon.
Figure 4.13 compares the resolution vs N
segments
for the dierent jet flavours in the same
truth
and 
regions. As with the response, it can be seen the jet energy resolution of LQ-
jets displays the largest sensitivity to N
segments
, showing the largest degradation as N
segments
increases, while b-jets and gluon-jets generally display a more similar jet energy resolution.
Although small dierences are observed in the dependence of the jet energy response and
jet energy resolution on N
segments
for dierent flavour jets, due to the lack of ecient flavour
tagging techniques at high energy in data, flavour was not taken into consideration when
deriving the punch-through correction, described in Chapter 5.

Chapter 5
Jet Punch-Through Correction
As shown in Section 4.2.1 (Appendix D), the currentATLAS EM+JES+GS (LCW+JES+GS)
jet energy calibration is sensitive to eects due to jet punch-through, with a clear degredation
in both the jet energy response and jet energy resolution observed as N
segments
increases.
This chapter details the derivation of a jet punch-through correction that aims to remove
the observed dependancies of the jet energy response and jet energy resolution on N
segments
thus producing a jet energy scale insensitive to the eects of longitudinal hadronic shower
leakage. The correction is another MC correction, applicable to both data and MC, specific-
ally targeting punch-through jets as defined in Section 4.1.2. It is designed to be relative to
the JES correction in Section 3.5.3, and applied after the GS corrections.
A detailed overview of the derivation procedure can be found in Section 5.1. Section 5.2
then describes the selection applied to jets used to derive the correction. A discussion of the
binning used for the jet energy response distributions can be found in Section 5.3, while the
procedure used to fit these distributions is described in Section 5.4. The process of obtaining
corrections relative to the JES correction in Section 3.5.3 is explained in Section 5.5. These
relative corrections are then used to form the jet punch-through correction function using a
sequence of Gaussian kernels as detailed in Section 5.6. Finally, the corrections derived from
the kernels, along with the final jet punch-through corrections applied to 2012 ATLAS data
can be found in Section 5.7.
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 84
The jet punch-through correction was derived for anti-k
jets, with R = 0.4 and R =
0.6, calibrated with the EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS schemes, producing jets at the
EM+JES+GS+PT and LCW+JES+GS+PT scales respectively, as defined by Equation 5.1.
5.1 Overview of derivation
The jet punch-through correction exploits the dependence of the jet energy response on
segments
. As N
segments
is just another jet property, this response dependency allows the jet
punch-through correction to be constructed in a similar way to the GS corrections (described
in Section 3.5.4), whereby the correction, C(N
segments
), is derived by inverting the jet energy
response as a function of N
segments
segments
) = R1(N
segments
)). The correction is
relative to the jet energy scale correction. Deriving the correction in this way enables easy
integration into the initial ATLAS 2012 EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS jet calibration
schemes described in Section 3.5. The full procedure used to derive the jet punch-through
correction is outlined below:
1. Select for real jets unaected by detector malfunctions and other calibration related
issues as described in Section 5.2.
2. Produce distributions of R in bins of E
truth
segments
and 
. The binning decisions
are outlined in Section 5.3.
3. Extract  = hRi|
truth
segments
from a Gaussian fit to these distributions. The
fitting procedure is described in Section 5.4.
4. Normalise hRi|
truth
segments
by the mean jet energy scale (hRiJES|
truth
) to ob-
tain a correction relative to the jet energy scale correction described in Section 3.5.3
(FJES). This procedure is explained in Section 5.5.
5. Construct the correction function in bins of 
(FPTrel (Ejet, log Nsegments)|det) using a
smoothing procedure involving a sequence of two Gaussian kernels. Section 5.6 goes
into detail on this step.
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 85
The punch-through corrected energy in each 
bin is then defined as:
EEM+JES+GS+PT
EEM+JES+GS
FPTrel (Ejet, log Nsegments)|det
(5.1)
where EEM+JES+GS+PT
is the reconstructed energy of the jet when taking into account energy
losses due to jet punch-through, EEM+JES+GS
is the jet energy after the fourth GS correction
(see Section 3.5.4) and FPTrel (Ejet, log Nsegments)|det is the final jet punch-through correction
function. For LCW+JES+GS jets, the final corrected jet energy is ELCW+JES+GS+PT
, ob-
tained by replacing EEM+JES+GS
in the equation above with the energy of the jet at the
LCW+JES+GS-scale, ELCW+JES+GS
5.2 Jet selection
The baseline high statistic Pythia8 dijet samples detailed in Section 1.4 were used to derive
the correction factors. The weights defined in Equation 1.10 were therefore applied to restore
the correction jet pT distribution shape. The MC cleaning cuts described in Section 3.6 were
applied to remove excess overlaid pile-up events. As only MC was used, no trigger selection
was applied. Events were required to contain at least one primary vertex with > 4 associated
tracks.
In order to ensure only real jets unaected by detector malfunctions were used, the jet-
by-jet cleaning cuts detailed in Section 3.6 were applied. The jet isolation criteria described
in Section 3.5.3 were applied to ensure only isolated jets were used. At least two jets passing
these criteria were required in order for an event to be used.
Truth jets were required to have pT > 7 GeV and were matched geometrically to
calorimeter jets as described in Section 3.4. In addition, only jets defined to be punch-
through jets using the definition in Section 4.1.2 were used during the derivation (p jetT > 50
GeV and N
segments
 20). Finally, all jets used were calibrated to the EM+JES+GS or
LCW+JES+GS scale.
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 86
5.3 Determination of binning
Using jets and events passing the selection criteria in the previous section, distributions of
the jet energy response in bins of 
segments
and E
truth
must be obtained, to which a
Gaussian distribution can be fit. The mean jet energy response extracted from these fits
is ultimately used to form a smooth correction as a function of log N
segments
and E
truth
binned in 
. The final correction function must eectively capture the dependencies of
the jet energy response on N
segments
truth
and 
observed in 4.2.1. In order to do this,
the following two requirements must be met when determining how to bin the jet energy
response distributions:
1. The 
binning must preserve any dierences in the structure of the mean jet energy
response plane in (E
truth
segments
) phase space due to 
, whilst also maximising
the statistics available for fits.
2. The E
truth
and N
segments
binning must provide adequate statistics for fits to converge,
while avoiding the masking of finer structures present in the mean jet energy response
plane in (E
truth
segments
) phase space.
These requirements are met by:
1. Studying the variations in the mean jet energy response as a function of E
truth
segments
in bins of 
and optimising the 
binning to minimise these variations
(see Section 5.3.1).
2. Optimising the E
truth
and N
segments
binning in order to maximise the number of suc-
cessful fits whilst keeping the binning as fine as possible (Section 5.3.2).
5.3.1 Preserving det dependencies
In the jet energy response studies performed in Section 4.2.1, the top-right plot in Figure 4.7
showed the jet energy response was similar for jets in the region |
| < 1.3, but dierent

in the 1.3  |
| < 1.9 and 1.9  |
< 2.7 regions. These regions correspond to
the distinct detector regions listed in Table 5.1. As these three 
bins represented distinct
detector regions, and showed dierences in the mean jet energy response, they were used for
the derivation of the jet punch-through correction.

5.3.2 Nsegments and Etruth binning
As mentioned in Section 5.3, the N
segments
and E
truth
binning must be chosen to be as fine as
possible whilst preserving enough statistics to allow the maximum number of fits to converge.
In order to take into account the fact that we are using weighted events, the number of ef-
fective entries (N
) as defined in Equation 4.4 is used as a measure for how many events are
available in each bin. Figure 5.1 shows how N
varies as a function of E
truth
and N
segments
for the three 
bins - 0  
< 1.3, 1.3  
< 1.9 and 1.9  
< 2.7. It is clear
is largest in the high E
truth
, low N
segments
region. The statistically limited regions are at
low E
truth
and high N
segments
i.e. N
decreases as N
segments
increases and E
truth
decreases.
However in the highest E
truth
region N
begins to decline due to the limited number of jets
in this region. This is compatible with what was observed in Section 4.1.3 whereby the jet
punch-through probability is largest for jets at high E
truth
. It is also important to note the
derivation is very statistically limited in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region, where no bins have
> 100. This is due to the increased detector material in this region.
From this figure, one could conclude large bin widths should be used at low E
truth
, high
segments
, while smaller bin widths should be used at high E
truth
, low N
segments
. However as
mentioned above, it is important the binning used does not mask any structures that may
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 88
be present in the mean jet energy response vs N
segments
truth
plane. Figure 5.2 shows the
mean jet energy response as a function of E
truth
in bins of N
segments
(left) and as a function
segments
in bins of E
truth
(right) for jets in each of the three detector regions.
Looking at the mean jet energy response as a function of E
truth
, there is a clear dependence
of the response on E
truth
when binning in N
segments
. As N
segments
increases, the dependence
of the mean jet energy response on E
truth
appears to grow stronger.
At low E
truth
, the response is high in all 
regions, reaching up to 60% above 1. This
high mean jet energy response arises from a combination of the pT > 50 GeV cut biasing
the response and the non-closure of the JES in this region (see Section 3.5.3). As E
truth
increases, the response then decreases to below 1, before increasing again but never again
reaching above 1. The turning point in the response vs E
truth
curve occurs at between 100
and 200 GeV for the 0  
< 1.3 and 1.3  
< 1.9 regions. In the 1.9  
< 2.7
region this turning point occurs later (E
truth
 600 GeV). As mentioned in Section 4.2.1,
even though the response is increasing with E
truth
is still larger at high E
truth
As a function of N
segments
, we see the previously observed trend of the response decreasing
with increasing N
segments
. The curves appear to get gradually steeper as N
segments
increases
until N
segments
 100 after which point the gradient of the curves appears to plateau.
Based upon these observations, it is clear that even though the low E
truth
region is
lacking in statistics, large bins cannot be used as this could prevent the behaviour of the
response at low E
truth
from being captured accurately by the Gaussian kernel when forming
the correction function. Instead, the binning must be fine in the low E
truth
region, with
bins getting progressively larger in the high E
truth
region where the gradient of the curve
appears to stabilise. Similarly, fine binning is necessary in the low N
segments
region to capture
the change in the gradient of the curve, while at high N
segments
larger bins are sucient to
capture the observed behaviour. The final binning used is discussed in Section 5.3.3 and
based on similar bin widths at log scale.

5.3.3 Final binning
Based on the studies in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, the jet energy response distributions were
binned using the bins in Table 5.2. The binning is fine in the low E
truth
, low N
segments
region, gradually getting coarser as E
truth
and N
segments
increases, ensuring the binning does
not mask structures in the response plane observed at low E
truth
and low N
segments

5.4 Fitting procedure
As mentioned in Section 5.1, the third step of deriving the jet punch-through correction
function involves fitting a Gaussian function to the jet energy response distribution binned
truth
segments
and 
. The mean jet energy response is extracted from this fit and
used by the Gaussian kernels (see Section 5.6) to produce the correction function (FPTrel ).
It was shown in Figure 3.6 that the jet energy response distribution is Gaussian when
binned in 
and E
truth
. When binning in an additional third dimension (N
segments
), this
fact also holds, as can be seen from the jet energy response distributions for jets with
25  N
segments
< 50 and 600  E
truth
[ GeV] < 800 in the detector region 0  
< 1.3
in Figure 5.4.
The initial distribution is shown on the top-left of Figure 5.4. Prior to fitting, the bin-
ning of this distribution is optimised using Scotts normal reference rule, defined in Equa-
tion 5.2 [125]. The rule calculates the optimum bin width, h
, which limits the number of
bins used in the histogram. The standard deviation of the normal distribution in question
is defined by  and n is the sample size (number of entries in the histogram). As we are
dealing with weighted entries, n = N
. The resultant rebinned histogram is shown on
the top-right of Figure 5.4.
3.5
(5.2)
Only the 1.6 core of the distribution is fit, where  and  are the mean and standard
deviation of the distribution respectively. The fitting procedure uses a combination of the
log-likelihood and 2 minimisation fitting methods as is outlined below:
1. The initial fit is done using the log-likelihood fitting method, and is used to obtain
initial values for  and . The fit range is chosen on a bin-by-bin basis according to
the shape of the distribution.
2. The fit range is then reset to 1.6, where  and  are extracted from the fit in Step
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 94
1. The distribution is then fit again, but this time using a 2 minimisation method,
as the log-likelihood implementation used did not calculate errors for fits to weighted
distributions correctly.
3. The fit range is again reset to  1.6, this time taking  and  from the fit in Step
2. The distribution is then re-fit, again using the 2 minimisation method.
The red line in the bottom plot of Figure 5.4 represents the resulting fit, whereby the solid
red line is the fit to the  1.6 core of the distribution, with the dotted line representing
the tails that are not fit. The resultant fit can be seen to be good (2

Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 96
Figure 5.5 shows the extracted mean responses and their associated errors for all three
bins. Only fits with a 2
< 50 were used. The errors (
) are calculated as the
standard error on the mean 2. Empty bins represent regions where there were insucient
statistics for the fits to converge. This was especially problematic in the forward region
(1.9  
< 2.7), where the punch-through probability is lower due to the increased
detector material. As a result, there is a gap in the extracted mean response plane at
800  E
truth
[ GeV] < 1000.
It can be seen that the extracted mean jet energy response increases as E
truth
increases
and decreases as N
segments
increases, as expected based upon prior studies in Section 4.2.1.
Thus the jet punch-through correction will be largest for jets with low E
truth
and high
segments
- as large as 25% in some regions. In addition, the response reaches smaller values
in the central 
region (0  
< 1.3) than in the other detector regions, therefore the
correction will be largest in this region.
5.5 Converting to a relative correction
As mentioned in Section 5.1, the jet punch-through correction function is a correction relat-
ive to the jet energy scale correction. This ensures the correction leaves the mean jet energy
scale unchanged while still improving the jet energy resolution. To do this, the mean jet en-
ergy response values obtained in Figure 5.5 are normalised by the mean jet energy response
when integrating over all N
segments
bins via Equation 5.3. Thus the relative jet energy re-
sponse (hR
truth
segments
) is the mean jet energy response in each N
segments
truth
bin (hRi|
truth
segments
) relative to the mean jet energy response integrated over N
segments
(hRiJES|
truth
). hRi
truth
is obtained by fitting the jet energy response distribu-
tions in bins of E
truth
and 
using the same fitting procedure as described in Section 5.4.

As expected, only the low E
truth
region is aected by the normalisation. The observed
dependence in Figure 5.5 of the jet energy response on E
truth
segments
and 
remains
unchanged, with the response being lowest in the central 
region (0  
< 1.3), for
the low E

, high N

region of phase space.
5.6 Obtaining a smooth correction function
As the parametric form of the response as a function of (E
truth
segments
) is not known,
non-parametric methods must be used to obtain a smooth correction function. One method
that can be used to achieve this is bilinear interpolation [126] of the relative response values
shown in Figure 5.7 as a function of (E
truth
segments
). However, bilinear interpolation
is sensitive to local fluctuations, which can result in statistical fluctuations in the relative
response as a function of (E
truth
segments
) becoming exaggerated, distorting the shape of the
correction function. An alternative approach is to use a non-parametric regression technique
that allows the global shape of the response curve to be taken into account when constructing
the correction function. This is achieved by using a smoothing technique known as Gaussian
kernel regression.
5.6.1 Overview of Gaussian kernel regression
Given a set of n observations of the random variable Y as a function of the random variable
X, regression aims to determine the relationship between Y and X:
Y = m(X) (5.4)
where m is a mathematical function. Kernel regression can be used to determine this re-
lationship when the mathematical form of m is not known. This involves determining the
conditional expectation of Y given thatX = x using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, m
The estimator is constructed as a locally weighted average of all n observations of Y as a
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 100
function of X, using a kernel3 with bandwidth , K
), as a weighting function. The
bandwidth is a parameter of the smoothing whose significance will be explained below. The
estimator is defined as [128]:
(x) =
(5.5)
where Y
and X
are the Y and X values respectively of the i-th observation (data point).
The chosen kernel is a Gaussian kernel [129] (hence Gaussian kernel regression):
) = e
2 (5.6)
The Gaussian kernel acts as a similarity function [130], characterising the distance
between x and X
. The kernel has value 1 if x and X
are identical and falls to zero as
the distance between x and X
increases. As a result, the Gaussian kernel will give larger
weights to Y
observations at X
values closer to the x position m
(x) is being estimated
at, and smaller weights to those observations further away. In this way, the estimated value
of m
(x) is most dependant on nearby observations, with a small dependence on the global
shape of Y as a function of X.
The bandwidth or smoothing parameter, , determines the width of the Gaussian kernel,
and thus how quickly the kernel weight falls to zero as the distance between x and X
increases. As a result, the bandwidth controls how strongly m
(x) is weighted towards
nearby observations over the global shape of the Y vs X curve, and thus how smooth
the estimated curve is. If the bandwidth is too large, under-fitting occurs, resulting in an
estimated curve that does not capture the important features of the relationship between
Y and X. However if the bandwidth is too small, over-fitting can occur, causing statistical
fluctuations to become over-exaggerated. Therefore the bandwidth must be optimised to
avoid over and under fitting.
3A kernel is defined to be a non-negative weighting function that integrates to one and has mean zero [127].
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 101
Equation 5.5 can only be used to estimate the random variable as a function of one
variable (X), however the jet energy response needs to be constructed as a function of two
variables (N
segments
and E
truth
). In order to estimate Y as a function of a d-dimensional vector
of variables X, where X = (X1, ..., Xd)
) in Equation 5.5 must be replaced by a
multiplicative kernel, K
) [131]:
j (5.7)
where X
and 
are the X
and bandwidth values for the j-th variable. Thus dierent
bandwidths must be provided for each variable Y is being parametrised as a function of,
resulting in d bandwidth parameters. The resulting d-dimensional estimator is given by:
(x) =
(5.8)
For binned data, Y
and X
represent the mean Y and mean X values respectively in
the i-th bin, with n being equal to the total number of bins, N
. In this case, the error
, can be taken into account by applying a normalisation of 1
to the kernels in
Equations 5.6 and 5.7 to give the normalised kernels in Equations 5.9 and 5.10 respectively.
This normalisation ensures Y
values with large errors have smaller weights, and thus a
smaller impact on m

5.6.2 Methodology for deriving correction function
The correction as a function of (Ejet, N
segments
) in bins of 
, FPTrel (Ejet, Nsegments)|det ,
where Ejet is the reconstructed jet energy at the EM+JES+GS or LCW+JES+GS scale, is
obtained from the relative response values in Figure 5.7 via a three step procedure:
1. Perform smoothing of the relative response in the N
segments
dimension only, in bins of
and E
truth
, using m
(x) from Equation 5.5 with the normalised kernel from Equa-
tion 5.9. Here, X is log N
segments
, and Y represents the relative response values from
Figure 5.7, where X
and Y
are the mean log N
segments
(loghN
segments
), relative
response and error on the relative response (
) respectively in the i-th N
segments
x is therefore the log N
segments
value at which the relative response is to be estimated.
The smoothing parameter, , was chosen to avoid biasing the response towards stat-
istical fluctuations. This step produces the relative response as a function of N
segments
in bins of 
and E
truth
, FPTrel (log Nsegments)|det,Etruth .
2. Convert from bins of E
truth
to Ejet via Equation 5.11 to give FPTrel (hlog Nsegmentsii)|
jet .
Here, hEjeti
and hE
truth
are the mean Ejet and mean E
truth
values respective, and
FPTrel (log hNsegmentsi
) is the relative response obtained by evaluating the function from
Step 1 at the mean N
segments
, all in the i-th (E
truth
segments
) bin.
= FPTrel (log hNsegmentsi
truth
(5.11)
3. Perform a two-dimensional smoothing of the relative response as a function of (Ejet,
segments
), in bins of 
, to give the final correction function, FPTrel (Ejet, Nsegments)|det .
This step is performed using m
(x) from Equation 5.8 with the normalised kernel from
Equation 5.10. Here, X, and thus X
, are two dimensional vectors:
log N
segments
logEjet
5 , Xi =
loghN
segments
loghEjeti
5 (5.12)
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 103
where X
i1 = loghNsegmentsii and Xi2 = loghEjetii are the mean Nsegments and mean Ejet
values respectively in the i-th (Ejet, N
segments
)-bin. As this step involves smoothing
as a function of two variables, the kernel takes two smoothing parameters as input -
one for N
segments
segments
) and one for Ejet (
jet). As with the smoothing para-
meter in Step 1, both N
segments
and 
jet were chosen to ensure the response was not
biased towards statistical fluctuations. Y is the relative response function from Step
2 (FPTrel (log Nsegments)|
jet), where Y
is this function evaluated at hlog N
segments
the Ejet bin containing hlogEjeti
(FPTrel (hlog Nsegmentsii)|
jet). Y
is then calcu-
lated as:
vuuut
FPTrel,nom(log Nsegments) FPTrel,j(log Nsegments)
(5.13)
where FPTrel,nom(log Nsegments) is the nominal relative response function obtained after
Step 1 and FPTrel,j(log Nsegments) is a shifted relative response function obtained by per-
forming Step 1 using a modified version of the response vs N
segments
curve, whereby
the fit in the jth N
segments
-bin is shifted by +1
In regions at the edges of the (E
truth
segments
) phase space, where no correction could be
derived due to a lack of successful fits, the correction function was frozen to be the correction
derived in the nearest bin with information. This freezing procedure involved:
1. Iterating over all N
segments
bins from low N
segments
to high N
segments
. When reaching
areas of phase-space where the estimator failed to estimate a relative response value
due to lack of statistics, use the relative response value in the prior (lower) N
segments
bin. This iteration is performed over all Ejet and 
bins separately.
2. Repeat Step 1, but this time iterate over all Ejet bins from low to high Ejet, instead of
from low to high N
segments
. This iteration is performed over all N
segments
and 
separately.

5.7 Results
The correction function after the application of the one-dimensional Gaussian kernel can be
found in Section 5.7.1, while the final correction function derived using the two-dimensional
Gaussian kernel can be found in Section 5.7.2. To assess how well the derived correction
function resembles the original relative response values in Figure 5.7, the 2

as a whole, resulting in the interpolated response after applying the one-dimensional kernel
being incredibly close to the original values obtained from the fits. Thus even though the
errors were observed to be small for the relative response in Figure 5.7, the 2
is still small.

5.7.2 Final jet punch-through correction function
The final correction as a function of Ejet and log N
segments
after the two dimensional kernel
is shown in Figure 5.11 for each of the three 
regions.
The correction function decreases with N
segments
and increases with Ejet, which is as
expected. The correction function is relatively smooth as a function of log N
segments
and Ejet
in the 0  
< 1.3 and 1.3  
< 1.9 regions. Comparing Figure 5.11 with
Chapter 5. Jet Punch-Through Correction 107
Figure 5.9, it can be seen that the empty bins present in Figure 5.9 have now been filled out
through a combination of the two-dimensional kernel estimating response values for empty
regions of phase space, and the correction being frozen at the edges of the (Ejet, N
segments
phase space. In the 1.9  
< 2.7 region, the correction function displays a distinct
boundary between the high and low Ejet regions at Ejet  350 GeV. This is a result of the
empty region created by the lack of fits in the 800  E

in Figure 5.5.

suggests over-estimated errors, as with the 2
observed for the one-dimensional kernel
(Figure 5.10). However, the errors on the relative response in this region were seen to be
small in Figure 5.7. Thus the conclusion is the same as with the one-dimensional kernel in
this region - the small 2
is due to the lack of convergent fits in this region, resulting in the
derived correction function, on average, being almost identical to the input relative response
values.

Chapter 6
Data Validation and Systematic
Uncertainty
Chapter 5 described the derivation of the jet punch-through correction function. The cor-
rection was derived using MC, and is designed to be applied to both MC and data. The
validity of the correction function in data is dependant on the correlation between the jet
response and N
segments
being well modelled. Any dierences due to modelling must be taken
into account as an uncertainty on the correction function.
This chapter details the method used to validate the jet punch-through correction func-
tion in data, from which a systematic uncertainty on the jet punch-through correction is
estimated. This involves assessing how well MC can reproduce: (1) Shape of the input
segments
distributions and (2) Dependance of the jet response on N
segments
In data, of course, only reconstructed information is available. Therefore, a jet response
cannot be constructed as in Equation 3.4. As a result, in-situ balance techniques must be
used to assess the response of the jet energy scale in data, and thus the impact of jet punch-
through on the jet energy scale. Section 6.1 details the in-situ dijet balance technique used
to do this, while Section 6.2 details the selection criteria used to select well balanced dijet
events. The trigger strategy used in data is explained in Section 6.3.
Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 110
A comparison of the shape of the input N
segments
distributions between data and MC can
be found in Section 6.4. The impact of jet punch-through on the jet energy scale in data
and MC is then compared in Section 6.5. Inconsistencies in modelling are used to derive an
uncertainty on the jet punch-through correction function as described in Section 6.6. The
final uncertainties on the jet punch-through correction function can be found in Section 6.6.2.
6.1 Dijet balance method
As mentioned previously, in data the jet response cannot be calculated as in Equation 3.4
due to the lack of truth information. Instead, a tag-and-probe technique exploiting the pT
balance in dijet events was used to form a reconstructed jet response. This reconstructed
jet response captures the imbalance in a dijet system with one fully contained jet and one
punch-through jet, and is thus sensitive to jet punch-through eects.
Dijet events were selected by requiring the two highest pT jets to be back-to-back using
the selection criteria in Section 6.2. The tag (reference) jet was defined to be a well calibrated
reference jet fully contained within the calorimeter with N
segments
= 0. The probe jet was
defined to be a punch-through jet with N
segments
 20. A schematic representation of the
topology of such an event is displayed in Figure 6.1.

Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 111
The mean reconstructed jet response as a function of Nprobe
segments
(R(Nprobe
segments
)), defined
in Equation 6.1, was used to assess the balance. Here, pprobeT (Nsegments  20) is the pT of
the probe jet, while prefT (Nsegments = 0) is the pT of the reference jet. Thus comparing the
reconstructed response between data and MC provides an avenue to verify the eects of jet
punch-through on the jet energy scale were well modelled. Section 6.5 goes into detail on
how the mean reconstructed response was measured.

(6.1)
The uncertainty on the jet punch-through correction aims to account for any miss-
modelling in the way jet punch-through aects the jet energy scale. To do this, the uncer-
tainty on the jet punch-through correction function was taken to be the dierence between
the data and MC mean reconstructed response as a function of N
segments
, Ejet and 
. Jets
used in the balance were calibrated at the EM+JES+GS+PT and LCW+JES+GS+PT
scale. This ensured any additional data/MC dierences that could have been introduced by
the application of the jet punch-through correction were also incorporated into the uncer-
tainty, which could then also be interpreted as the uncertainty on the final scale after the
application of the correction. Section 6.6 goes into detail on how the uncertainty is derived.
It is important to note the balance can also be assessed using the asymmetry variable
(A). Studies comparing the asymmetry variable with the reconstructed response can be
found in Appendix C.
6.2 Event selection
Events were required to pass the data quality requirements outlined in Section 2.4. Events
were also rejected if either of the leading jets, or any other jet with pT greater than 30% of
the pT of the sub-leading jet, failed the jet cleaning requirements in Section 3.6.
In order to select for well-balanced dijet events, additional kinematic cuts were applied.
Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 112
The event was required to have at least two jets, with at least two tracks coming from the
primary vertex (as defined in Section 2.2.2). The two leading jets were required to have
 > 1701. They were also required to be isolated via the reconstructed jet isolation
criteria described in Section 3.5.3. If there was a third jet (J3), a cut on the Jet Vertex
Fraction (see Section 3.6) was used to reduce the eect of in-time and out-of-time pile-up:
 pJ3T was required to be smaller than max(12 GeV, 0.25pavgT )
 If |
| < 2.5, |JVFJ
| > 0.25 was required.
To ensure we were only looking at probe jets with the jet punch-through correction
applied, a cut of pprobeT > 50 GeV was used. In addition, all jets were required to be within
the muon spectrometer acceptance region (
< 2.7).
The binning defined in Section 5.3.3 that was used to derive the correction function
was also used to validate it in data. This was done to minimise any dierences that could
occur due to bin convolutions. However, instead of binning in E
truth
, pprobeT was used. Some
probe
T bin merging was done in the high p
probe
T region due to the lack of statistics in data.
This resulted in nine pprobeT (GeV) bins: 50-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-200, 200-600, 600-1000,
1000-1600, 1600-3000, 3000-4500.
The same dijet selection criteria applied to data was applied to MC. No trigger selection
was applied to MC, however the additional cleaning cuts specified in Section 3.6 were applied
to remove additional overlaid pileup jets. The trigger selection applied to data was described
in Section 6.3.
Finally, for the reconstructed response studies in Section 6.5 that utilise the tag-and-
probe method described in Section 6.1, events must have one fully contained calorimeter jet
segments
= 0) and one punch-through jet (N
segments
 20).
A total of 14.45 fb1of data collected by ATLAS during 2012 were used for these studies.
For MC, the nominal Pythia8 dijet samples detailed in Section 1.4 were used.

6.3 Trigger strategy
The trigger selection in data made use of a combination of single jet triggers. Triggers are
characterised by their eciency vs p jetT curves (see Figure 2.14) and are increasingly prescaled
in order to ensure the available bandwidth of 200 Hz was not exceeded. Distinct p jetT regions
were identified in which single jet triggers had an eciency of greater than 99% (their plateau
region). The lowest prescaled trigger in each p jetT region for EM+JES-scale jets is shown in
Table 6.1. Please see Section D.4.1 for the equivalent LCW+JES-scale p jetT regions.

> 150 GeV cut,
while L2FS signifies the trigger chain used the L2 Full Scan algorithm (see Section 2.2.5).
For this analysis, the p jetT regions the leading and sub-leading jets belong to were found,
and the lowest prescaled triggers from each p jetT region combined. This resulted in the event
being accepted if at least one of the triggers passed. If both jets fell into the same p jetT region,
they were assigned identical triggers, and thus only one trigger was used.
In order to account for the trigger prescales, a weight calculated using Equation 6.2 was
applied. Here, w
is the applied weight, PS is the prescale of the j-th or k-th trigger,
whereby j and k are the index of the trigger used for the leading and sub-leading jet respect-

6.4 Nsegments distribution comparison
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, it is important to verify the shape of the
input N
segments
distribution is comparable between data and MC when binning in both
pT and Nsegments. In Figure 4.2 when comparing the Nsegments distribution in data and MC
for all jets, MC deviated from data by up to 50% in the high N
segments
region.
Figure 6.3 compares the shape of the N
segments
distribution in each of the three 
regions
for jets with 600  prefT [ GeV] < 1000. In the 0  det < 1.3 region, the discrepancy
between data and MC grows with N
segments
, reaching up to 70% in the high N
segments
region.
For the 1.3  
< 1.9 region, dierences of up to  20% can be seen for jets with
segments
 100, however this discrepancy disappears for jets with N
segments
> 100. In
Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 115
both of these regions, MC has more events than data at very low N
segments
and fewer events
at high N
segments
. As observed during the derivation of the correction function in Chapter 5,
there is a lack of statistics in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region at high N
segments
, however at low
segments
(< 5) the distributions show relatively good agreement.

Comparing Figure 6.3 with Figure 4.2, it appears the large discrepancy in the 0

is oset by the better agreement in the 1.3

Although the discrepancies in the 0

the high N

region, the impact of N
segments
on the response in data and MC must be
compared to assess how this dierence in modelling may aect the correction function.

jet punch-through on the JES between data and MC. The mean reconstructed response is

gion before (top) and after (bottom) the jet punch-through correction applied, in data (left)
and MC (right).
The fitting procedure used was identical to the one used to derive the correction function
(described in Section 5.4). However, it is important to note here that the fits at high
segments
are very statistically limited in all regions, a result of requiring events to have one
punch-through jet (N
segments
 20) and one non-punch-through jet (N
segments
= 0). To
account for this, the quality of fit requirement was loosened by removing the limitation of
< 50, and instead requiring |mean

|  (0.5  
), where mean

mean extracted from the fit, mean

can be seen that the reconstructed response distributions are Gaussian before and after the
application of the correction. The 2
values are  1, suggesting reasonable fits.

Figure 6.5 compares the reconstructed response as a function of Nprobe

the central 
region (0   |
| < 1.3). The curve is shown before and after the
Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 118
application of the jet punch-through correction.
Before the correction is applied, the reconstructed response decreases as N
segments
creases. The degradation is less severe for jets at higher pT, where the reconstructed response
can be seen to degrade by as much as 30% ( 15%) in the highest N
segments
region for jets
with 200  pprobeT [ GeV] < 600 (600  pprobeT [ GeV] < 1000). Thus it can be concluded
that the reconstructed response and truth response (Equation 3.4) behave in a similar way.
After the correction is applied, the reconstructed response is corrected back to within a
couple of percent of 1 in regions it is applied (N
segments
 20), suggesting any imbalance
due to jet punch-through has been largely removed. The 200  pprobeT [ GeV] < 600 region
is statistically limited in the high N
segments
region in data with fits producing large errors.
Before the correction, the data/MC dierences appear to be roughly compatible with
zero for jets with 200 < pprobeT [ GeV] < 600. The dierences are slightly larger after the
correction, but still within a few percent of 0 when taking into account uncertainties. For
jets with 600  pprobeT [ GeV] < 1000 at high Nsegments, the dierences reach  7% before
the correction. This is reduced to  5% after the correction.
From these plots, it can be concluded that the eect of jet punch-through on the jet
energy scale is reasonably well modelled. Any dierences seen here are taken into account
through an uncertainty on the correction function as described in Section 6.6.
6.6 Derivation of an uncertainty
An uncertainty on the jet punch-through correction is necessary to take into account the
data/MC dierences seen in the reconstructed response curves in Figure 6.5. The uncertainty
is constructed as a function of (N
segments
, pprobeT ) in bins of det, analogous to the jet punch-
through correction being constructed as a function of (N
segments
truth
) in bins of 
Uncertainties are derived for anti-k
jets, with R = 0.4 and R = 0.6, calibrated with the
EM+JES+GS+PT and LCW+JES+GS+PT schemes.
Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 119
6.6.1 Constructing the uncertainty
The uncertainty is calculated as the absolute dierence between the data and MC mean
reconstructed response as a function of N
segments
, in 
and pprobeT bins. This is defined in
Equation 6.3, where R
is the uncertainty on the jet punch-through correction function,
i is the reconstructed response in MC, hRdata
i is the reconstructed response in data
and |

segments
signifies these values are in bins of (
, pprobeT , Nsegments). Thus for
Figure 6.5, the uncertainties are obtained by taking the absolute values of the dierences in
the bottom plots in order to obtain symmetric uncertainties.

The uncertainty obtained in (
, pprobeT ,Nsegments) bins is displayed in Figure 6.6. Empty
bins represent regions where no uncertainty was derived due to the lack of successful fits.
The uncertainty increases as pT decreases, and in general increases as Nsegments in-
creases. The uncertainty reaches up to 13% in the 0  
< 1.3 region, 10% in
the 1.3  
< 1.9 region and 8% in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region. It is import-
ant to note however the error on the uncertainty is large for the larger uncertainties in the
0  
< 1.3 and 1.3  
< 1.9 regions. This likely due to low statistics in these
regions. Also, it is clear (as with the derivation of the correction) that the 1.9  
< 2.7
region is statistically limited, with uncertainties only derived for two bins in this region.

Chapter 6. Data Validation and Systematic Uncertainty 121
To construct the uncertainty function, the same sequence of Gaussian kernels used to
derive the correction function in Section 5.6 was used. For the uncertainty however, the
kernels are a function of (log pprobeT , log Nsegments) as opposed to (logE
jet, log N
segments
). As
with the correction function derivation, 
probe
and N
segments
were optimised to capture the
shape of the uncertainty across 
and (pprobeT , Nsegments), whilst providing stability against
statistical fluctuations. The uncertainties shown in Figure 6.6 were used as inputs (C
) to the
one-dimensional Gaussian kernel to form an uncertainty as a function of (pprobeT , Nsegments) in
bins of 
. For regions of phase space limited by a lack of successful fits, three approaches
were taken:
1. Freeze the uncertainty function at the value in the nearest (pprobeT , Nsegments) bin with
information, using the same freezing procedure mentioned at the end of Section 5.6.
2. Allow the derived uncertainty function to extrapolate the uncertainty into regions with
no information.
3. As the 1.9  
< 2.7 regions suered from low statistics and thus very few fits
(seen in Figure 6.6), a weighted average was calculated via Equation 6.4 using the
available uncertainties. This weighted average was then taken as a flat uncertainty
for the entire region. In Equation 6.4, x is the weighted average taken to be the flat
uncertainty, w
2 is the inverse square of the error on the uncertainty and x
is the
uncertainty. It is also important to note that for anti-k
R = 0.4 jets, no fits were
successful in the 1.9  
< 2.7 regions. As a result, the derived anti-k
R = 0.6
uncertainties in this region were used for anti-k
R = 0.4 jets.

6.6.2 Final uncertainties
The final uncertainties as a function of (pprobeT , Nsegments) for each of the three det bins are
shown in Figure 6.7. Both the frozen and extrapolated uncertainties are shown.
It can be seen the uncertainties are relatively smooth as a function of (pprobeT , Nsegments).
For the 1.9  
< 2.7 region, the uncertainty is the weighted average as described above,
and is thus the same for the frozen and extrapolated methods. This gives a flat uncertainty
at  7.5%. The extrapolated uncertainties reach up to 12% (10%), much higher values
than the frozen uncertainties that reach up to  6% ( 4.5%) in the 0  |
| < 1.3
(1.3  |
| < 1.9) region. The uncertainties grow larger as N
segments
increases and pprobeT
decreases. Thus the uncertainty is large in regions of phase space with a large jet punch-
through correction.
The 2
is 0.33 (0.32) in the 0  |
| < 1.3 region and 0.433 (0.430) in the
1.3  |
| < 1.9 region for the frozen (extrapolated) uncertainties. No 2
was calculated
for the 1.9  
< 2.7 region as a weighted average was used here. These 2
values
are small (< 1) for both the frozen and extrapolated uncertainties, although slightly larger
for the frozen ones. The small 2
values are due to the limited statistics resulting in large
errors on the uncertainties in some regions.
As the frozen uncertainties are observed to be smaller and with slightly better 2
values,
these were used as the nominal uncertainties on the jet punch-through correction function.
The uncertainties have negligible impact on the total JES uncertainty (as will be shown in
Section 8.2).

Performance of the Jet
Punch-Through Correction
It was shown in Chapter 6 that the jet punch-through correction removes the dijet imbalance
due to jet punch-through in both MC and data, correcting the in-situ response as a function
segments
back to 1. This chapter investigates how the jet punch-through correction
impacts jet energy reconstruction in MC in Section 7.1, followed by an assessment of how
the correction aects a search for new physics in Section 7.2.
All performance studies in this chapter used the nominal Pythia8 samples, with the
selection cuts used to derive the correction factors described in Section 5.2.
7.1 Impact on jet energy reconstruction
The impact of the jet punch-through correction on jet energy reconstruction is assessed by
looking at the aect on the jet energy scale in Section 7.1.1, the resultant change in the jet
energy response tails in Section 7.1.2, and corresponding eect on the jet energy resolution
in Section 7.1.3.

The aim of the jet punch-through correction was to remove the dependence of the jet en-
ergy response on N
segments
, while leaving the mean jet energy scale in 
and E
truth
unchanged. Studies in this section will confirm the correction meets these specifications.
From Figure 7.1, it can be seen that the correction does not aect the Gaussian nature of
the jet energy response distribution, with the correction mainly impacting the low-response
tail. The higher E
truth
bin appears to have been aected more than the low E
truth
bin. This
eects suggests the correction is behaving as designed, accounting for jet energy losses due
to jet punch-through by pushing the response of jets in the low response tail back to 1, and
having a larger impact on the RMS of the response of higher E
truth
jets, that have a larger
jet punch-through probability. A more thorough study of the impact of the correction on
the jet energy response tails can be found in Section 7.1.2.

bins compared before (solid circles) and after (empty circles) the application of the
jet punch-through correction, in each of the three 
bins used to derive the corrections.
The mean jet energy response is almost identical before and after the correction, making it
very dicult to discern the empty circles from the solid circles. The dierence is observed
to be small - below 0.3% in all bins. This dierence appears to grow with E
truth
, as expected
Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 127
from the fact the fraction of punch-through jets grows with E
truth
(see Figure 4.6).
Thus it can be concluded the correction is working as designed - removing the jet energy
scale dependence on N
segments
, as seen in Figure 7.2, whilst also keeping the mean jet energy
scale response unchanged, seen in Figure 7.3.

7.1.2 Eect of correction on jet energy response tails
In order to understand the impact of the jet punch-through correction on the jet energy
resolution, it is first important to investigate the impact of the correction on the low response
tails in the jet energy response distributions, observed to grow with N
segments
in Section 4.2.2.
Figure 7.4 compares the percentage of events below a given response thresholds for jets with
and without the jet punch-through correction applied. The comparison is shown for jets in
the 0  
< 1.3, 100  N
segments
< 150 bin at high (200  E
truth
[ GeV] < 400)
and low (1000  E
truth
[ GeV] < 1200) truth energy. These plots are analogous to those
in Figure 4.9.
Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 128
It can be seen the jet punch-through correction reduces the percentage of events in the
tails in both bins. This eect is common in all 
truth
and N
segments
bins. Combined
with the removal of the dependence of the jet energy response on N
segments
, these eects help
to reduce the low response tail in the mean JES response, as was seen in Figure 7.1.

An eective way of analysing the impact of the correction on the jet energy response
tails as a function of E
truth
is to analyse how the 2 and 1 quantile positions of the jet
energy response distribution are aected by the correction. Figure 7.5 shows the position
of the 2 and 1 histogram quantiles, and position of the quantiles relative to the mean
response (calculated as in Equation 4.2), for the jet energy response distribution as a function
truth
, before and after the correction, in each of the three 
regions. The correction
pushes the 2 and 1 quantiles to a higher response value, with the shift in the position
of the quantiles growing with E
truth
, and largest in the 1.3  
< 1.9 region (a shift
of up to 15%). This shows the largest impact is in regions of phase space with the largest
fraction of punch-through jets.

The 2 and 1 fit quantile positions for the jet energy response distribution are shown
in Figure 7.6, along with the position of the quantiles relative to the mean response extracted
from the fit. The fit was performed in the same way as described in Section 5.4, with only
the 1.6 core of the distribution being fit. As a result, the fit does not adequately capture
the shape of the tails of the underlying distribution. However, in general, the correction also
pushes the fit quantile positions to higher response values, although the shift is not as large
as compared with that of the underlying distribution seen in Figure 7.5.

The2 and1 fit quantile positions in Figure 7.6 for jets with 1600  E
truth
[ GeV] < 2000
in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region appear to display a degradation that was not observed when
looking at the histogram quantiles in Figure 7.5. Figure 7.7 displays the fitted jet energy
response distribution for these jets along with a direct comparison of the distributions. It is
clear that the correction has had very little impact on this distribution, with no noticeable
impact on the shape of the distribution. Additionally, even though a degradation is observed
when using the fits, an improvement is seen in the RMS, whereby the RMS is reduced, albeit
by a very small amount, from 0.05039 before the correction to 0.0506 after.

7.1.3 Impact on jet energy resolution
The reduction in the size of the low jet energy response tails seen in Section 7.1.2 is expected
to reduce the overall fluctuations in the jet energy response, therefore improving the jet
energy resolution. Figure 7.8 shows the jet energy resolution, described in terms of the RMS
in Equation 4.6, before and after the application of the jet punch-through correction. The
resolution is shown as a function of N
segments
, for dierent E
truth
bins in each 
region.
These plots are analagous to those in Figure 4.11.

Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 133
In the 0  
< 1.3 and 1.3  
< 1.9 regions, it can be seen that the
correction, in general, improves the jet energy resolution. The improvement appears to be
marginally larger as E
truth
increases, reaching up to  10%. Although an improvement
in the jet energy resolution is observed in most regions, the dependence on N
segments
not completely removed. An apparent degradation is seen in the 1.3  
< 1.9,
400  E
truth
[ GeV] < 600, high N
segments
region, however, low statistics in this region
result in large errors on the RMS. The response distributions for these two bins are shown
in Figure 7.9, from which the apparent degradation can be seen to be caused by a large low
response tail still present, while the mean of the distribution has been shifted back to 1.

Figure 7.10 shows the jet energy resolution when integrating over N
segments
, defined in
terms of the RMS, and extracted as  from a Gaussian fit to the response distribution
performed using the procedure described in Section 5.4.
The jet punch-through correction is observed to improve the jet energy resolution. When

looking at the resolution in terms of the RMS, the improvements clearly grow with E
truth
and are largest in the 1.3  
< 1.9 region, reaching up to  1.6%. This is consistent
with the shift in quantile positions observed in Section 7.1.2. The improvement in the
resolution extracted from the fit can be seen to follow the same trend in general, however
the improvement observed is smaller. This is again due to the fit only being performed for the
 1.6  core of the response distribution, preventing it from adequately capturing the full
eect of the correction on the low response tail. In addition, although no improvement in the
resolution could be seen in Figure 7.8 for jets in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region, the improved
statistics when integrating over N
segments
makes it possible to see a clear improvement in
Figure 7.10.

7.2 Impact on Dijet Mass Resonances search
One of the simplest searches that can be constructed is a search for high mass resonances in
the invariant dijet mass (m
) distribution in dijet events, where m
is the invariant mass
Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 135
of the vectorial sum of the four-momenta of the two highest pT jets in the event:
j1 +m
j2 + 2(Ej1Ej2  |pj1||pj2| cos(j1j2)) (7.1)
where m
j1, Ej1, and |pj1| are the mass, energy and magnitude of the three-momentum of
the highest p
jet in the event (j1), whilst m
j2, Ej2, and |pj2| are the mass, energy and
magnitude of the three-momentum of the second highest p
jet in the event (j2), and 
j1j2 is
the angle between the three-momenta of the highest and second highest p
jets in the event.
The hypothesis for the search is that many new physics models describe new particles
or excitations created as S-channel resonances that can produce dijet final states. Processes
from Quantum Chromodynamics produce a smooth, rapidly falling, m
spectrum. Thus,
if the resonances produced by the new particles or excitations are suciently narrow, they
will appear as bumps in the dijet mass distribution over the smooth background, that can
be searched for.
This search relies on the jet energy scale being well calibrated at high energy, the region
of phase space most aected by jet punch-through. As a result, an important test of the
jet punch-through correction is to assess the impact of the correction on the obtained dijet
mass spectrum for this analysis.
Reference [3] describes the dijet mass resonances search in detail and shows the final limits
set on the existence of new particles when using the full 2012 ATLAS dataset, amounting
to 20.3fb1 of data.
7.2.1 Overview of analysis
The analysis follows the following steps:
1. Preparation of invariant dijet mass distribution: This is formed in data and Monte
Carlo by selecting dijet events and constructing the m
distribution.
Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 136
2. Search Phase: This stage involves searching for resonances above the QCD background
in the m
distribution. The expected background is defined by a four-parameter fit
function of the form [3]:
f(x) = p1(1 x)p2xp3+p4 lnx (7.2)
This function is fit to the m
distribution obtained from data in Step 1. Statistical
tests are then performed in order to find the largest bump and calculate the significance
in terms of the deviation of the bump from the background fit. A bump with 5
significance would indicate the discovery of a new particle. This technique and its
sensitivity to certain benchmark models is tested in Monte Carlo simulation, after
which the technique is further validated using a random sub-set of the full dataset
(amounting to 5.07fb1).
3. Limit setting phase: In the event no significant deviation from background is found,
limits (constraints) on New Physics phenomena are set using the current data. This
involves using simulated signals for New Physics models as benchmarks. Limits are
set for two scenarios: (1) New Physics benchmark models and (2) Generic resonances
in the form of Gaussian and Breit-Wigner signals.
The impact of the correction on the dijet mass distributions and the excited quark bench-
mark signal samples is assessed.
7.2.2 Jet and event selection
The analysis uses the nominal Pythia8 MC samples, and 20.3fb1of data. It is performed
using anti-k
R = 0.6 jets. Events were required to pass the data quality requirements
outlined in Section 2.4. In addition, events were rejected if either of the leading jets, or any
other jet with pT greater than 30% of the pT of the sub-leading jet, fail the jet cleaning
requirements in Section 3.6.
Chapter 7. Performance of the Jet Punch-Through Correction 137
In order to select for well-balanced dijet events, additional kinematic cuts were applied.
The event was required to have at least two jets, with at least two tracks coming from the
primary vertex (as defined in Section 2.2.2). The rapidity, y 2 of two leading jets were
required to be within |y| < 2.8. The two leading jets were required to have pT > 50 GeV,
and have a combined invariant dijet mass of m
> 250 GeV. Finally, events must satisfy
|y| = 1
sublead
| < 0.6, where y
and y
sublead
are the rapidities of the leading and
subleading jet respectively. The y cut favours central collisions where the dijet mass is
expected to be largest, helping to enhance the signature of exotic phenomena.
No trigger selection was applied to Monte Carlo. In data, in order to increase the number
of events in the dijet mass distribution by an order of magnitude, events are collected using
a combination of two single jet trigger streams - the normal stream, and the delayed stream.
The delayed trigger stream includes events that were recorded after the normal stream due
to constraints on the reconstruction time.
7.2.3 Impact on simulated excited quark signal samples
One such New Physics benchmark model tested by the dijet mass resonances search is
the existence of excited u and d quarks (q) that are one possible manifestation of quark
compositeness. Details on the simulation of these samples can be found in Reference [3].
Example signal m
distributions for q with masses m
 = 1250 GeV and m
 = 3750
GeV before (GSC) and after (PT) the application of the jet punch-through correction are
shown in Figure 7.11. Distinct resonances in the m
distributions can be seen representing
the excited quark particles. From the ratio, it is clear the punch-through correction appears
to be increasing the number of events at high mass.

at higher values of m
 . The increases seen are very small, between 0.1 and 0.3 % for m
and 0.2 and 0.5 % for RMS(m

pushing up m
in events aected by punch-through, increasing the higher mass m
tails as
seen in Figure 7.11, increasing both hm
i and RMS(m
). The increase seen is small due to
the limited N
segments
range to which the correction is applied.

The final m
distribution (left), and the percentage of events above some m
threshold
against the threshold (right) in data are shown in Figure 7.13 before (GSC) and after (PT)

events in the high mass tail, suggesting it is doing as intended and increasing the number
of high-mass events available that could potentially aid in the discovery of a new resonance.
The fraction of events in the high mass tail can be seen to increase by up to 30%.

7.2.5 Future studies
Whilst the studies in Sections 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 allowed the impact of the jet punch-through
correction on the distributions involved in the dijet mass resonances analysis to be assessed,
better measures of the impact of the correction are available. One such measure would be to
assess the impact of the correction on the significance obtained when performing the Search
Phase of the analysis detailed in Section 7.2.1 on a QCD background sample injected with
the simulated signal from Section 7.2.3. This would involve running the Search Phase for
QCD background obtained from data injected with simulated signal with and without the
jet punch-through correction applied, and then assessing the change in the significance of
the resulting bump in the dijet mass distribution. A large improvement in the observed
significance would indicate the correction could provide large benefits to the analysis. Due
to time constraints, this study could not be performed, but is important to consider for the
future.
Chapter 8
Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale
The jet punch-through correction is an MC based jet energy response correction dependant
on a jet property (N
segments
), similar to the GS corrections described in Section 3.5.4. This
enabled it to be easily intergated into the final 2012 ATLAS jet energy scale calibration as
the fifth and final step in the GS correction sequence.
This chapter details the final 2012 ATLAS jet energy scale calibration after the inclusion
of the jet punch-through correction derived in this thesis. Section 8.1 gives an overview of
the additions to the calibration outlined in Section 3.5 that result in the final ATLAS 2012
jet energy scale. The uncertainties on the final ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale are shown in
Section 8.2. Lastly, the final ATLAS 2012 jet energy resolution is detailed in Section 8.3.
As the jet punch-through correction was integrated into the GS corrections for the final
ATLAS 2012 jet energy calibration, the EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS scales in this
chapter refer to the scales after the application of the jet punch-through correction.
8.1 Final ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale
The final ATLAS jet calibration scheme in 2012 was an extension of the initial calibration
described in Section 3.5, involving the same Monte Carlo corrections with the addition of the
Chapter 8. Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale 142
jet punch-through correction as part of the GS corrections, followed by an additional set of
data-driven corrections derived using the full 2012 ATLAS dataset with
L dt = 20 fb1.
The data-driven corrections aim to reduce the dierences observed in the jet energy scale
response between data and the Monte Carlo used to derive the corrections. The final calib-
ration scheme is outlined in Figure 8.1.
Figure 8.1: Final calibration chain for ATLAS 2012 jets [108].
8.1.1 Final 2012 Global Sequential corrections
The final 2012 GS corrections included the punch-through correction developed in this thesis
as the fifth step, with the first four steps and their derivation procedure as described in Sec-
tion 3.5.4. The derivation of the punch-through correction integrated into the GS derivation
was identical to that described in Section 5. As shown in Figure 8.2, the final 2012 GS
corrections improve the jet pT resolution. The punch-through correction is applied from the
upper green triangles to the lower blue triangles, however no clear improvements are seen
from this figure. Improvements due to the jet punch-through correction are not visible in
this plot due to a couple of main reasons:
 The pT resolution in Figure 8.2 is shown as a function of ptruthT , whereas the improve-
ments seen in Section 7.1.3 were for the jet energy resolution as a function of E
truth
Chapter 8. Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale 143
 The resolution in Figure 8.2 is being measured as the standard deviation of a fit to the
jet pT response distribution, divided by the mean jet pT response. This fit is performed
in the same way as described in Section 5.4, only being done to the 1.6 core of the
distribution. As a result, this method does not capture the full eect of the correction
on the tails of the response distribution - the place where the punch-through correction
has the most impact.
The reduction in dierences in the response of quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets also
results in a reduction in the jet energy scale flavour based uncertainties (shown in Ref.[1]).

through correction (lower blue triangles). Bottom plots show the dierence in quadrature
between the resolution with the GS corrections (0) and the resolution at the EM+JES scale
without the GS corrections ()[1].
The final 2012 GS corrections including the jet punch-through correction, were validated
in-situ in data by exploiting the pT balance in dijet events. The method used was independent
of the one described in Chapter 5. The full data validation procedure for the final 2012 GS
corrections is detailed in Appendix E. The final 2012 GS corrections were published in
Ref. [1].
Chapter 8. Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale 144
8.1.2 Residual in-situ calibration
The final step in the final 2012 calibration chain is the residual in-situ calibration, only
applied to data. It is derived in data, and designed to improve the data-MC agreement.
In-situ techniques employing the balance of physics objects in the transverse plane are
used to derive the corrections, whereby the balanced is assessed through the ratio:
hp jetT /prefT idata/hp jetT /prefT iMC , (8.1)
where p jetT and p
T are the reconstructed pT values of the jet and balance object (photons, Z
bosons or other jets) respectively. The ratio represents the compatibility of the reconstructed
pT response in data (hp jetT /prefT idata) with that in MC (hp jetT /prefT iMC), and defines the residual
correction. The closer the ratio is to 1, the better the data-MC agreement.
Firstly, the pT balance in dijet events is exploited to apply an -intercalibration to re-
move residual pseudorapidity dependent dierences in the jet response. This is achieved by
equalising the average pT of forward jets (0.8  |det| < 4.5) to the pT of balancing jets
in the central region (|
| < 0.8). These corrections are generally below 2% [133].
Following this, the balance of Z bosons, photons and well calibrated low-pT jets (multi-
jet) against an ordinary jet is used to derive in-situ JES corrections for jets with |
| < 0.8.
This is done for jets with 20  pT  200 GeV (Z +jet), 30  pT  800 GeV (+jet)
and 300  pT  1700 GeV (multi-jet). These measurements are combined via a weighted
average based on a 2-minimisation to give a combined measurement of the response ratio,
used for the residual in-situ correction [133], while also providing a source of uncertainty on
the jet energy scale (see Section 8.2).
The ratio from these in-situ methods was cross-checked using a method whereby the jet
energy scale is estimated from the response of single hadrons (single hadron response) [101,
134]. This method also provides an extension of the insitu-methods to higher energies
(pT > 1500 GeV). The two methods were found to be in agreement.
Chapter 8. Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale 145
8.2 Jet energy scale uncertainty
A jet energy scale uncertainty is derived for jets calibrated to the final 2012 jet energy
scale with p jetT > 15 GeV and |det| < 4.5. The uncertainty is defined in terms of 66
independent parameters (nuisance parameters) originating from multiple sources. From the
insitu-methods described in Section 8.1.2, the balance methods contribute 22 systematic and
34 statistical sources, related to methodology, detector description, physics modelling and
a mix of detector and modelling eects. The single-hadron response contributes a single
high pT uncertainty at pT > 1500 GeV. The -intercalibration contributes 2 sources - one
systematic and one statistical. The pile-up corrections described in Section 3.5.2 contribute
4 sources - a , N
and pT dependent uncertainty, and an uncertainty associated with the
miss-modelling of , where  is as defined in Section 3.5.2 and used in Equation 3.5. 2 sources
are attributed to jet flavour dierences, one associated with the degree of knowledge of the
flavour composition of jets in an event, and another associated with generator dierences
in the response for gluon-initiated jets. The final source of uncertainty comes from the jet
punch-through correction, determined in Chapter 6.
The final uncertainties on the EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS scales after the applic-
ation of the insitu calibrations are shown as a function of p jetT for central jets in Figure 8.3,
and for forward jets in Figure 8.4 [135]. The total jet energy uncertainty is dependent on how
well the composition of an event is known, due to the increase in the flavour uncertainty in
events with unknown composition. In the central region, the jet punch-through uncertainty
can be seen to be small (< 0.2 %), and only visible in the high p jetT region (p
T > 600GeV),
contributing a negligible amount to the overall uncertainty. In the forward region, the un-
certainty can be seen to be larger, reaching up to  0.6 % in the higher pT region, but is
still not the dominant uncertainty.

jet measurements whilst Relative in situ JES refers to the uncertainty arising from the dijet
-intercalibration. Punch-through refers to the uncertainty on the final (muon-based) stage
of the global sequential correction. [108, 135]
8.3 Jet energy resolution
As mentioned briefly in Section 3.4, the energy of a reconstructed jet can fluctuate with
respect to the initial energy of the initiating object. This occurs due to eects mentioned
in Section 3.5 that aect the energy measurement of a jet, including statistical fluctuations
inherent to the energy measurement in calorimeters, the finite jet area, pile-up radiation
being captured within the jet, jet punch-through, etc. Most of these eects lead to a Gaussian
Chapter 8. Final ATLAS 2012 Jet Energy Scale 148
distribution, shown in Figure 3.6. An exception to this is jet punch-through, which aects
the tails of the jet response, as shown in this thesis.
Fluctuations in the jet energy are measured in terms of the (fractional) jet energy resol-
ution, parametrised as a function of three terms:
(pT)
 C, (8.2)
whereN parametrises the eect of noise (electronic and pile-up), S parametrises the stochastic
eect arising from the sampling nature of the calorimeters and C is a pT independent con-
stant term. In MC, (pT)
can be parametrised in terms of the width of the jet response
distribution (see Section 3.4). In data, for the majority of the pT spectrum, the resolution is
determined from the width of the pT balance of jets to well measured photons or Z bosons,
and extended through higher pT through dijet events, using the in-situ methods described
in Section 8.1.2.
In both MC and data, the jet energy resolution is largest at low pT, improving as pT in-
creases. The jet energy resolution values for EM+JES+GS (LCW+JES+GS) anti-k
R = 0.6
jets are outlined in this paragraph. In MC, for jets with |
| < 0.3, the resolution is  18%
(21%) at ptruth
= 30 GeV, decreasing to 3% (3%) at ptruth
= 1000 GeV. The MC resolution
displays  10% ( 5%) fluctuations as a function of 
, with the best resolution observed
at 2  |
| < 3. In data, at pT  30 GeV, the combined resolution is  20%, decreasing
to  4% ( 4%) at pT  1000 GeV [108]. A fit to the resolution as a function of pT was
performed in data using the parametrisation in Equation 8.2. The extracted values for the
parameters N , S and C are displayed in Table 8.1.
Jet punch-through eects are expected to contribute to the constant term, however at
the time of writing, studies to test the magnitude of this contribution had not yet been
performed. This is something that will be investigated in the future.

Summary, Conclusions and Outlook
Measuring the kinematics of hadronic final states is important not just for precision meas-
urements of QCD predictions, but also for searches for New Physics, such as the Dijet Mass
Resonances search described in Section 7.2. Hadronic jets are indispensable tools in this
process, allowing measurements of the kinematic properties of hadronic showers produced
by hadronic final states to be made. As a result, in order for searches and precision meas-
urements involving hadronic final states to be successful, the energy of hadronic jets must
be accurately measured. One key consideration when measuring the energy of hadronic
showers, and thus jets, is longitudinal hadronic shower leakage outside of the calorimeter,
also known as jet punch-through. This is a stochastic phenomenon that is dependant on
the energy of the shower initiating parton and the amount of material the shower passes
through. Studies using test beam data showed longitudinal shower leakage decreased the
measured mean shower energy by 10%, worsening the resolution by up to 30% (shown in
Section 1.3.3).
In order to study the impact of jet punch-though on the initial jet energy scale calibration
described in Section 3.5, Section 4.1 established that the number of muon segments found
behind a jet in the muon spectrometer was a good indicator of jet punch-through. A punch-
through jet was thus defined to have N
segments
 20 in order to distinguish between b-jets
and real jet punch-through. The fraction of punch-through jets was confirmed in the same
section to be larger for jets with higher energy passing through regions of the detector with
less material, reaching up to 10%.
Studies in Section 4.2 then showed that even after calibrating jets with the EM+JES+GS
Summary, Conclusions and Outlook 151
(LCW+JES+GS) calibration scheme discussed in Section 3.5, jet punch-through still had
an impact on the jet energy response and jet energy resolution. The jet energy response
was observed to decrease by up to 30% as N
segments
increased, with the decrease smaller
in the higher energy region, but corresponding to a larger energy loss. An increase in the
fraction of events in the low response tail due to jet punch-through was shown to cause the jet
energy resolution to worsen by up to 15%, consistent with the test beam data. The resolution
degradation as a function of N
segments
was worse for higher energy jets, as expected. However,
as a function of the percentage of energy lost, the degradation in the energy resolution was
shown to be independent of jet energy. In addition, comparing the impact of punch-through
on dierent jet flavours showed that light-quark jets are the most sensitive to energy losses
due to jet punch-through, and also experience the largest degradation in jet energy resolution.
These observations motivated the need for a correction, the jet punch-through correction, to
remove the eect of jet punch-through on the initial 2012 ATLAS jet energy scale.
Chapter 4 outlined the derivation procedure used to derive the jet punch-through cor-
rection from Monte Carlo simulation. This was achieved by extracting the mean response in
bins of 
truth
and N
segments
using a Gaussian fit, followed by the use of Gaussian kernels
to obtain a smooth correction function as a function of N
segments
and E
truth
in bins of 
with values ranging from 0.6 to 0.98. The largest corrections were observed in the central
region |
| < 1.3 in the low energy, high N
segments
region. The correction was validated in
data in Chapter 6 by assessing the dijet imbalance in a dijet system with a punch-through
jet balancing a fully contained jet, as a function of N
segments
of the punch-through jet. The
dijet imbalance due to jet punch-through was observed to be consistent between data and
Monte Carlo to within a few percent, with the correction largely removing the imbalance
observed as a function of N
segments
. Two sets of systematic uncertainties on the correction
were derived as the dierence in the in-situ response between data and Monte Carlo - frozen
uncertainties and extrapolated uncertainties. The frozen uncertainties were observed to be
lower, and taken to be the nominal uncertainties on the correction, growing with N
segments
but decreasing with p jetT , reaching 8% in the 1.9  |det| < 2.7 region. These uncertainties
had near negligible impact on the overall jet energy scale uncertainties (Section 8.2).
Summary, Conclusions and Outlook 152
The performance of the correction was assessed in Chapter 7, where the dependence of
the jet energy response on N
segments
was observed to be largely removed by the correction.
The correction was also observed to shrink the low response tails, pushing the negative 1
and 2  quantile positions to higher response values, resulting in the jet energy resolution
being improved by up to 1.6% in the highest energy regions. However, the correlation
between the increasing energy resolution and an increase in N
segments
was not completely
removed, suggesting the eects of jet punch-through on the jet energy resolution were not
completely negated. These improvements were shown to have a positive impact on the
dijet mass distribution, used by the dijet mass resonances search to look for new, high-mass
resonances, whereby the correction increased the fraction of events in the high mass tail in
data by over 30% in some regions. The mean and RMS of signal dijet mass distributions
were also increased. As a result of the positive impact of the jet punch-through correction,
it was integrated into the final ATLAS 2012 jet energy scale as the fifth and final step of
the GS corrections, mentioned in Chapter 8.
In conclusion, this thesis described the derivation, data validation, determination of
systematic uncertainties and assessment of the performance of a new correction designed to
remove the eects of longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, also known as jet punch-through,
from the ATLAS jet energy scale and jet energy resolution. N
segments
was identified as
an observable linked to jet punch-through, which the jet energy response was shown to
be sensitive to. The correction derived to remove this dependence reached values of 0.6%
(a 40% correction) in the lowest E
truth
regions with an uncertainty of up to 8% in the
1.9  |
| < 2.7 region that had near negligible impact on the overall jet energy scale
uncertainty. The correction was shown to remove the dependence of the jet energy response
segments
, improving the jet energy resolution by up to 1.6% in the highest energy regions.
These eects consequently increased the fraction of events in the high mass tail in data by
over 30%, whilst also increasing the mean and RMS of signal dijet mass distributions, useful
in setting limits/constraints on the search for New Physics.
As a result of the work in this thesis, the jet punch-through correction was included in the
Summary, Conclusions and Outlook 153
final 2012ATLAS jet energy calibration as the fifth step in the Global Sequential calibration.
Although only results for anti-k
jets with R = 0.6 calibrated with the EM+JES+GS scheme
are described in the main chapters of this thesis, similar results were found for anti-k
with R = 0.4 and R = 0.6, calibrated with the EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS schemes,
resulting a correction derived for all four of these jet collections. Results for anti-k
R = 0.6
jets calibrated with the LCW+JES+GS scheme are described in Appendix D.
In Run II, with the LHC operating at
s = 13 TeV, the jet punch-through correc-
tion will be even more crucial due to produced jets reaching higher energies with greater
punch-through probabilities. At present, the correction is being derived using the procedure
outlined in this thesis, however, as shown, the eects of jet punch-through on the jet energy
resolution were not completely removed by the correction. In addition, only small improve-
ments were observed in relation to the dijet mass resonances signal samples. These eects
are largely a result of the N
segments
definition, and limiting the correction to N
segments
due to the presence of b-jets in the low N
segments
region. Therefore in order to improve the
performance of the correction as Run II progresses, N
segments
will be ghost associated to
jets in an attempt to reduce backgrounds and thus allow the N
segments
cut to be reduced
by further pin-pointing the b-jet threshold. Augmenting the correction with calorimeter
information (see Appendix B) will further improve the correction, and allow an extension of
the correction to regions of the detector with no muon spectrometer (|
| > 2.7).
As well as improving the correction, additional studies on the performance of the cor-
rection could also be performed. These include further studies on the impact of the jet
punch-through correction on searches for New Physics, specifically looking at the impact
on the sensitivity of searches and the limits set. It would also be useful to perform a more
thorough analysis of the impact of jet punch-through on the constant term of the jet energy
resolution, including a parametrisation of how energy losses due to jet punch-through impact
the overall jet energy resolution. This could be compared to Equation 1.9, and also be used
to gain a better understanding of the impact of longitudinal hadronic shower leakage on jet
energy measurements in general.

the correlation between N

Calorimeter Studies
This appendix describes studies utilising calorimeter information on the energy profile of jets
in the calorimeter to study jet punch-through, mentioned briefly in Section 4.1.
B.1 Calorimeter variables sensitive to jet punch-through
A jet that begins showering later in the calorimeter is more likely to punch-through. There-
fore the following variables that relate the jets energy deposition profile in the calorimeter
can be used to study jet punch-through:
1. fTile2: Fraction of the jets energy deposited in the final (third) layer of the hadronic
barrel calorimeter. A large f
T ile2 could indicate a punch-through jet. This variable is
limited to the region |
|  1.4.
2. fECAL: Fraction of the jets energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. A
small f
could indicate a punch-through jet. This variable is limited to |
|  3.2.
3. SMAX: The calorimeter layer in which the maximum energy per unit interaction
length was deposited1. The correspondence between the sampling layer numbers

T ile2 displays good agreement at very low values, with increased discrepancies
observed as f
T ile2 increases. Discrepancies in fT ile2 are slightly reduced in the 800  E <

displays good agreement in
the ECAL presampler and the third ECAL layer. Agreements for the other ECAL layers are
within 25% for jets with 100  E < 150 GeV and 20% for jets with 800  E < 1000 GeV.
Data and MC agree to within 30% in the HCAL layers in both energy regions, with the
exception of the third HCAL layer for jets with 100  E < 150 GeV, where large dierences
are observed.
Overall the agreement is observed to be satisfactory, with no drastic dierences in shape
observed between data and MC.
B.3 Correlations with Etruth
In order to determine how the calorimeter variables mentioned in Section B.1 correlate with
jet punch-through, it is important to determine how these variables depend on the jet energy
and 
. Figure B.2 displays f
(top-left), f
T ile2 (top-right) and SMAX (bottom) variables
truth
. Each variable is displayed in the 
regions it is valid within.
It is clear that as E
truth
increases, f
decreases in all 
regions. This is the correlation
one may expect to see if f
is an indicator for jet punch-through, whereby the jet punch-
through probability increases with E
truth
, and a punch-through jet is expected to have a
lower f
due to the shower developing later in the calorimeter, thus f
is expected to
decrease as E
truth
increases, as observed. f
is observed to be consistent in the regions
| < 1.3 and |
| > 1.3 for E
truth
> 90 GeV, with a lower f
observed in the
| > 1.3 region. Thus f
does not seem to clearly correlate with detector material,
which is desired for a variable useful in studying jet punch-through.
T ile2 increases with Etruth in the |det| < 1 region. However in the 1  |det| < 1.3
Appendix B. Calorimeter Studies 162
region the correlation is not as clear, with f
T ile2 decreasing in the region 40  Etruth < 200
GeV, however f
T ile2 then increases with Etruth for jets with Etruth  200 GeV. Thus in the
high E
truth
region, where the jet punch-through probability is expected to be highest, we see
T ile2 increases, which suggests the increasing fT ile2 could possibly be linked to an increased
punch-through probability at higher E

is only shown for |
| < 0.6. It is clear that for E
truth
> 40 GeV, as S
increases as E
truth
increases, consistent with the idea that S
could correlate with jet
punch-through, with the shower maximum moving to outer detector layers as E
truth
increases.

can be seen to increase as f
T ile2 increases and fECAL decreases, and increases
moves to outer detector layers, peaking for jets with S
in the final layer of
the hadronic calorimeter. The correlations grow stronger with higher E
truth
. Coupled with
the observations in Section B.1, this is highly suggestive that jets with a high f
T ile2, low
and S
in the final layer of the hadronic calorimeter, are more likely to punch-
through the calorimeter, as increased muon activity is observed behind them. Reasonable
agreement is observed between data and MC. Similar observations were made in all other
regions these variables were studied in, with larger numbers of segments seen in regions
of the detector with less material.
B.5 Dependence of response on calorimeter variables
In the previous section it was observed that jets with a high f
T ile2, low fECAL and low SMAX
have a larger N
segments
behind them, suggesting these jets are more likely to punch-through
the calorimeter. It is also important to test how the jet energy response, and thus the
measurement of the jet energy, is correlated with these variables. Figure B.4 shows the
response vs f
T ile2, fECAL and SMAX in the |det| < 0.6 and 1  |det| < 1.3 regions, before
and after the application of the muon based (N
segments
) jet punch-through correction. Only
the |
| < 0.6 region is shown for S
as this variable is not currently constructed in the
other detector regions.

In the |
| < 0.6 region, the response increases as f
increases from  0.96 at
 0.1 to 1 at f
 0.6, showing the response degrades as f
decreases. This
could be due to the higher punch-through probability at low f
, as suggested by the higher
muon activity in this region. This is further suggested by the eect of applying the punch-
through correction, whereby the jet response at low f
is increased by the correction
by up to 2%, with the largest increases seen at low f
. The cut on N
segments
could be preventing the response from being completely restored to 1 in this region. In the
1  |
| < 1.3 region, no clear correlation is seen with f
in general, aside from the
increase in the jet response as f
decreases for jets with 200  E
truth
[GeV ] < 400.
For f
T ile2, we see a clear degradation in the jet energy response as fT ile2 increases, with
a reduction of 30-40% observed in the |
| < 0.6 region for jets with f
T ile2  0.6. The
increased N
segments
in this region highly suggests this degradation is linked to jet punch-
through, whereby the jet punch-through correction pushes the response in the high f
T ile2
region back towards 1. The impact of the correction increases with f
T ile2, improving the
response by up to 10% (2%) for higher E
truth
jets in the highest f
T ile2 region, with |det| < 0.6
(1  |
| < 1.3). As with f
, the correlation is not completely removed, likely due to
the N
segments
 20 restriction on the correction.
It is clear when looking at the response vs S
, the response degrades as S
proaches the outer calorimeter layers, with a degradation of 20-30% for jets with S
in the final layer of the hadronic calorimeter. Again the high value of N
segments
observed
in this region suggests this degradation is linked to jet punch-through, whereby a 5-10%
improvement in the response is observed when applying the jet punch-through correction.
For all calorimeter variables, very little dependence is seen on E
truth
(agree in general to
within 1%), unlike the correlation between the response and N
segments
which showed a clear
dependence on E
truth
. The only E
truth
based dierences observed are at low f
in the
1  |
| < 1.3 where jets with 200  E
truth
[GeV ] < 400 show a higher response.
These plots suggest jets with low f
, high f
T ile2 and SMAX in the outer calorimeter
layers experience a degradation in their measured energy due to jet punch-through. The

lack of correlation between the response and f
in the region 1  |
| < 1.3, along
with the restriction of f
T ile2 and SMAX to |det| < 1.3 and |det| < 0.6 respectively prevented
the iteration of the jet punch-through correction in this thesis from exploiting the observed
correlations between calorimeter variables associated with jet punch-through and the jet
response, instead opting to focus on N
segments
. However, future iterations of the jet punch-
through correction will aim to incorporate the dependencies seen here, in order to improve
the impact of the jet punch-through correction on the jet energy resolution and analyses.

As jet punch-through is related to how the hadronic shower develops in the calorimeter,
it is useful to study the shape of the shower in the calorimeter in relation to the amount
of muon activity found behind the jet in the calorimeter. By doing this, a method to

shower shape is related to N

in the region |
| < 0.6, with the aim to extrapolate
this to the region |
| > 2.7 in the future. The calorimeter layers a jet in the |

region passes through are shown in Figure B.5.
To study how the shower shape aects the muon activity behind a jet (N
segments
), the
fraction of the jets energy deposited per unit interaction length,
layer
layer
, in each of these
calorimeter layers, is plotted, along with the N
segments
and the energy of the jet (E). For
MC, E
truth
and the jet energy response are also plotted. These plots are then split based
upon which calorimeter layer contains the maximum energy deposition per unit interaction
length (S
), which is equivalent to binning depending on which layer has the maximum
fraction of energy per unit interaction length (as Ejet is a constant factor for all layers when
looking at a single jet). Figure B.6 shows these plots for data while Figure B.7 shows these
plots for MC.
In both MC and data, as observed previously, N
segments
grows larger as S
approaches
later layers in the calorimeter. Further studies will need to be performed in the future to
fully understand the shower shapes observed for jets with S
in the later layers in the
calorimeter.

reconstructed asymmetry displays a clear dependency on N
segments
, whereby the imbalance
increases as N
segments
increases. The imbalance appears to be smaller at higher pprobeT . This
is compatible with what was seen with the truth and reconstructed response.

couple of percent of zero to within errors. In the 600  pprobeT [ GeV] < 1000 region,
the dierences are generally observed to be small (< 5%). The dierences appear to be
lower after the punch-through correction when compared with those in Figure 6.5 in the
200  pprobeT [ GeV] < 600 region, but similar in the 600  pprobeT [ GeV] < 1000 region.
As with the reconstructed response, this suggests the aect of jet punch-through on the jet
energy scale is reasonably well modelled.
C.3 Comparison with reconstructed response
The reconstructed response can be obtained from the asymmetry via Equation C.2. Fig-
ure C.3 shows plots comparing the response obtained from the asymmetry (Response (A))
with the response obtained directly from the reconstructed response distributions shown in
Figure 6.5 (Response). The comparison shown is for jets with 200  pprobeT [ GeV] < 600,
600  pprobeT [ GeV] < 1000 and 0  |det| < 1.3 for both data and MC.
It is clear the response obtained from both methods is compatible to within errors, con-
firming the reconstructed response values measured in Section 6.5 are reliable. For the
uncertainties on the jet punch-through correction in Chapter 6, the reconstructed response
is obtained directly as opposed to from the asymmetry as it was found the reconstruc-
ted response fits had better 2
values. This can be seen when comparing Figures 6.4
and C.1, whereby three out of the four fits have 2
closer to 1 for the reconstructed re-
sponse fits. As mentioned before, the correction is working well - leaving the N
segments
region untouched and restoring the asymmetry and reconstructed response to 1 for jets with
segments
 20.

Appendix D
Punch-through studies with LCW jets
This appendix contains jet punch-through studies pertaining to the fraction of LCW jets
that experience jet punch-through in Section D.1 and the eect of jet punch-through on
the LCW+JES+GS jet energy scale and resolution in Section D.2, as well as outlining the
derived LCW jet punch-through correction function in Section D.3, uncertainties on the
correction function in Section D.4, and performance of the correction in D.5. Although plots
are only shown for jets with radius R = 0.6 in this appendix, the correction was derived for
both R = 0.4 and R = 0.6, EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS jets.
D.1 Punch-through probability
Figure D.1 shows the fraction of punch-through jets as defined in Section 4.1 as a function
of E and |
|. It is clear that as with EM+JES+GS jets, LCW+JES+GS jets with at high
E, passing through |
| regions with less material, are more likely to punch-through the
calorimeter, reaching as high as 15 (20) %.

D.2 General energy studies
Here are the LCW+JES+GS equivalents to those in Chapter 4. Sections D.2.1, D.2.2
and D.2.4 contain plots related to Sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 respectively.
D.2.1 Degradation of the jet energy scale due to jet punch-through
Figure D.2 shows the energy response and E
as a function of N
segments
. It is clear that even
though the LCW correction has a correction sensitive to jet punch-through (see Section 3.3),
there is still a dependence of the LCW+JES+GS calibration scheme on N
segments
and thus jet
punch-through. The degradation is more severe for low E
truth
jets - up to 30% - compatible

it is clear that jet punch-through increases the fraction of jets in the LCW+JES+GS-scale
low response tail, as was seen for EM+JES+GS-scale jets (Figure 4.9).

D.2.3 Degradation of jet energy resolution
The jet energy resolution vs N
segments
and energy loss % due to jet punch-through is shown
in Figure D.4. A degradation in the LCW+JES+GS-scale jet energy resolution due to an
increase in N
segments
, and thus jet punch-through, is observed, consistent with EM+JES-scale
jets (Figure 4.11). The degradation as a function of N
segments
is worst for low E
truth
jets in
the 1.3  
< 1.9 region, however as a function of energy loss %, very little variation is
seen as a function of E
truth
. However, for jets in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region, the low jet
punch-through fraction limits the available statistics, preventing a clear degradation of the
jet energy resolution as energy loss increases from being seen.

D.2.4 Flavour dierences for LCW jets
A comparison between the jet energy response vs N
segments
for LQ, gluon, b and all-jets is
shown in Figure D.5. As mentioned in Section 4.2.4, the samples used are LQ dominated at
high E
truth
, and so the inclusive jet response is heavily weighted towards the LQ-jet response.
As with EM+JES+GS jets (Figure 4.12), LQ-jets show the largest degradation in the jet
energy response as N
segments
increases, with the degradation of gluon and b-jets generally
being compatible to within errors.

D.3 LCW jet punch-through correction
This section displays the LCW+JES+GS-scale jet punch-through correction factors derived
using the method explained in Chapter 5. The mean jet energy response for LCW+JES+GS-
scale jets extracted from the fitting procedure described in Section 5.4 is displayed in Fig-
ure D.7 (see Figure 5.4 for the equivalent EM+JES-scale jet plots). The extracted mean
response values display the previously observed degradation of the jet energy response
segments
increases, with a larger degradation observed for lower E
truth
jets. In the
1.9  |
| < 2.7 region, very few fits converged due to the lack of statistics, as was
the case for EM+JES-scale jets.

D.4 Systematic uncertainty on correction for LCW jets
The uncertainties on the LCW+JES+GS-scale jet punch-through correction were derived
using the method described in Chapter 6. The triggers used are detailed in Section D.4.1,
while the LCW+JES+GS-scale punch-through uncertainties are displayed in Section D.4.2.
D.4.1 Trigger strategy
The trigger strategy for the dijet balance method used to estimate the systematic uncertain-
ties for the jet punch-through correction is described in Section 6.3. Table D.1 shows the
T regions and the associated fully ecient single jet triggers for LCW+JES+GS-scale jets.

In this section, the LCW+JES+GS-scale plots for the response curves in Section 6.5 are
displayed in Section D.4.3, the LCW+JES+GS-scale punch-through uncertainties before the
application of the Gaussian kernels are displayed in Section D.4.4 and the final uncertainties
are displayed in Section D.4.5.

D.4.3 Reconstructed response curves
Figure D.9 shows the reconstructed response vs N
segments
before and after applying the
jet punch-through correction for LCW+JES+GS-scale jets. As with EM+JES+GS jets
(see Figure 6.5), the dependence of the reconstructed response on N
segments
seen before
the application of the correction is removed by the jet punch-through correction, with the
reconstructed response corrected back towards 1. The data and MC reconstructed response
values agree to within 5% both before and after the application of the correction, with the
disparity growing with N
segments

Figure D.10 shows the reconstructed asymmetry as a function of N
segments
for LCW+JES+GS-
scale jets (see Figure C.2 for EM+JES-scale jets) before and after the application of the jet
punch-through correction. It can be seen the correction removes the increase in the recon-
structed asymmetry as N
segments
increases. Data and MC agree to within 5%.

D.4.4 Uncertainties from fits
The uncertainties on the LCW+JES+GS-scale jet punch-through correction obtained by
comparing the mean reconstructed response extracted from fits for data and MC is shown
in Figure D.12 (see Figure 6.6 for EM+JES-scale jets), as a function of N
segments
and p jetT in
all three 
regions. The uncertainties can be seen to reach 9% in the 0  
< 1.3
region, increasing as p jetT decreases as Nsegments increases. This is the same trend as was seen

D.4.5 Final LCW jet punch-through uncertainties
The final jet punch-through uncertainties, after the application of the one and two dimen-
sional Gaussian kernels, for LCW+JES+GS-scale jets, are shown in Figure D.13 for all
three 
regions. Both the frozen and extrapolated uncertainties are shown. As with the
EM+JES-scale jets (see Figure 6.7), the uncertainty in the 1.9  
< 2.7 region is the
average of the two uncertainty values in Figure D.12, weighted by their error, calculated to
be  5%. The extrapolated uncertainties are seen to be largest, reaching 12% in the lowest
T , Nsegments, 0  det < 1.3 bin, while the frozen uncertainties reach 8% in the same
region.

D.5 Performance of LCW punch-through correction
This section discusses the performance of the LCW jet punch-through correction in terms of
its impact on the fully corrected LCW jet energy scale and jet energy resolution. The plots
are the LCW equivalent to those shown in Chapter 7.
D.5.1 Impact on the jet energy scale
From Figure D.19, it can be seen that the jet energy response distribution for LCW jets is
still Gaussian after the application of the jet punch-through correction, with the correction
mainly impacting the low response tail (see Section D.5.2 for more detailed studies).

well, largely removing the dependence of the jet energy response on N
segments

Finally, Figure D.16 compares the jet energy response integrated over N
segments
function of E
truth
for each of the three 
regions, before and after the application of the jet
punch-through correction. It is clear from this figure that the jet punch-through correction
has a negligible aect on the mean JES (< 0.1%). As mentioned previously in this thesis,
the jet punch-through correction aims to remove the dependence of the jet energy scale on
segments
, whilst also leaving the mean JES binned in 
and E
truth
the same. Thus it can
be concluded the jet punch-through correction works as designed for LCW+JES+GS-scale
jets, as it also does for EM+JES-scale jets.

D.5.2 Impact on jet energy response tail
The percentage of LCW jets below a response threshold before and after the application
of the jet punch-through correction is show in Figure D.19, from which it can be seen the
percentage of jets in the low response tail is reduced by the correction.

The 2 and 1 fit quantile positions, before and after the application of the correction,
are shown in Figure D.19. As with the histogram quantiles, the fit quantiles can be, in
general, seen to be pushed to higher response values by the correction. However as the
fit is only done to the   1.6 core of the distribution, the shift in fit quantiles is not as
substantial as the histogram quantiles, as the fit does not completely capture the behaviour
of the response tails.

scale jets, as was also observed for EM+JES-scale jets in Section 7.1.2.

D.5.3 Impact on jet energy resolution
The jet energy resolution before and after the application of the correction as a function of
segments
for LCW jets is shown in Figure D.20. The correction can be seen to improve the
resolution by up to 10% in the 0  |
| < 1.3 and 1.3  |
| < 1.9 regions, but has
little aect in the 1.9  |
| < 2.7 region. The dependence of the resolution on N
segments
is not completely removed in any region however. This is consistent with what was seen for
EM+JES-scale jets in Figure 7.8.

The impact of the jet punch-through correction on the overall jet energy resolution when
integrating over N
segments
, with the resolution estimated from the RMS and as  of a Gaussian
fit to the jet energy response distribution, is shown in Figure D.21. Again, as the fit only
captures the   1.6 core of the distribution, the impact of the correction on the low
response tail is largely neglected, and thus very little improvement in the resolution extracted
from the fit can be seen. However when looking at the resolution in terms of the RMS,
a clear improvement of the resolution can be seen. The improvement is largest in the
1.3  |
| < 1.9 region, reaching up to 1%, and smallest in the 1.9  |
| < 2.7
region.

Appendix E
In-situ validation of GS corrections
This appendix details the data in-situ validation of the final 2012 GS corrections described
in Section 8.1.1, and is adapted from Reference [1]. Section E.1 outlines the dijet balance
method used, Section E.2 details the event selection applied to select for well balanced dijet
events, the trigger strategy is then outlined in Section E.3, and finally the input variable
distributions and balance in data and MC are compared in Section E.4.
Please note that as this appendix refers to studies using the final 2012 GS corrections,
the EM+JES+GS and LCW+JES+GS scales referred to here include the jet punch-through
correction derived in this thesis. The validation was done for anti-k
jets, with radius R = 0.4
and R = 0.6, calibrated with the EM+JES and LCW+JES schemas. Only plots using anti-k
R = 0.4 jets calibrated with the EM+JES scheme are shown.
E.1 Overview of dijet balance method
The GS corrections can be validated using a variation on the tag-and-probe method used to
validate the jet punch-through correction, described in Chapter 6. When validating the jet
punch-through correction, one can select the probe to be a jet experiencing punch-through,
and the reference jet to be a fully contained jet. However for the other GS corrections, a
clear choice for the probe and reference jet is not always available. As a result, choosing
Appendix E. In-situ validation of GS corrections 200
which of the two back-to-back jets is the reference jet and which is the probe jet is arbitrary,
and the events are always used twice, inverting the roles of reference and probe. The jet
whose calorimeter response dependence on the jet structure variables is studied is referred to
as the probe jet, while the other is referred to as the reference jet. The calorimeter response
to jets is measured through the asymmetry variable is then defined as:
A(x) =
probe
T (x) prefT
T (x)
, (E.1)
where x is any of the variables used in the GS corrections (see Table 3.1) and pavgT is the
average pT of the probe and reference jet
1. Both pprobe
and prefT depend on x, but the
dependence is explicitly written only for the probe jet because the jet property used to build
the correction is the one of the probe jet. The probe and reference jet are both calibrated
with the same scheme. When computing correction number i, they are both corrected up to
the (i 1)th correction (see Sec. 3.5.4). The mean response as a function of x is given by:
hR(x)i =
probe
prefT
, (E.2)
which correspond to a good approximation to:
hR(x)i = 1 + hA(x)i/2
1 hA(x)i/2 . (E.3)
Equations E.2 and E.3 are analogous to Equations C.1 and C.2 respectively from the jet
punch-through tag-and-probe method. For this method, Equation E.3 is used to calculate
the average jet response instead of Equation E.2 since A(x) is Gaussian in bins of fixed pavgT ,
while the jet response distribution R(x), calculated as pprobeT /prefT in bins of prefT , is not2.
As with the jet punch-through validation in Chapter 6, the validation of the GS correc-

sian.

tions involves verifying both the distributions of input jet property variables, and also the
relationship between jet response and jet property variables, are well modelled.
E.2 Event selection
The dijet selection used for the GS data validation is a modified version of the event selection
used for the jet punch-through correction data validation studies in Chapter 6.
Events are required to have at least one vertex with 2 or more tracks, with ptrackT >
150 MeV [1]. The longitudinal position of the vertex is required to be within 10 cm of the
detector centre.
Events where the two leading jets have a pavgT > 20 GeV and  > 2.5 radians are
used, where  is the azimuthal angle between the two leading jets in the event and pavgT
correspond to the average pT of the two leading jets. A cut on the Jet Vertex Fraction (see
Section 3.6 (|JVF| > 0.25) is used to reduce the eect of in-time and out-of-time pile-up for
jets with |
| < 2.4 and pT < 50 GeV. If there is a third jet (J3), additional requirements
in the event are applied:
 If |
|  2.4, pJ3T is required to be smaller than max(10 GeV, 0.4pavgT ).
 If |
| < 2.4, pJ3T is required to be smaller than max(12 GeV, 0.4pavgT ) and a |JVF| >
0.25 for pJ3T < 50 GeV is applied.
The same event selection criteria are used in the MC simulation and in the data. The
bin boundaries are defined in Table E.1. For some variables, bins were merged in order to
obtain higher statistics. Unlike the method in Chapter 6, this method requires that both
jets be in the same |
| bins to avoid the -intercalibration contributions that this method
is more sensitive to due to the extended 
range.
The trigger selection applied is defined in Section E.3.

As the GS data validation studies extend into the more forward detector regions (  2.8),
the trigger strategy used is dierent from that in Section 6.3. The trigger selection still uses
single jet triggers, but the selection is designed such that the trigger eciency is greater than
99% for a specific region of pavgT , instead of p
T . As a result, this strategy does not use a
combination of triggers for each event, but instead uses a single trigger. This trigger is either
a forward or central trigger, depending on whether the jets fall into the region

E.4 Results
The input jet property distributions are compared between data and MC in Section E.4.1,
the dijet asymmetry data/MC comparisons are shown in Section E.4.2, and comparisons
between the jet punch-through uncertainties derived using the method in Chapter 6 and the
method described in this appendix are shown in Section E.4.3.
All MC corrections in the final ATLAS 2012 jet energy calibration chain described in
Section 8.1 were derived for both full and fast simulation samples. This includes the GS
corrections, with the exception of the jet punch-through correction, for reasons mentioned
in Section 2.3. Thus for the first four GS corrections, plots compare both fast (AFII) and
full simulation with data.
E.4.1 Input jet property distributions
Figures E.1 and E.2 show the distributions of the f
T ile0, fLAr3, ntrk, widthtrk and Nsegments
variables in data and inclusive jet MC events. Distributions for the two leading jets recon-
structed with the anti-k
algorithm with R = 0.4 and calibrated at the EM+JES scale with
| < 0.6 and 80 < pavgT < 110 GeV and 600 < pavgT < 800 GeV bins are shown. The
segments
variable is not shown for 80 < pavgT < 110 GeV due to the low number of events
in data. Compared to data, the reference Pythia8 MC exhibit higher (lower) values for
the f
LAr3, ntrk and widthtrk (fT ile0 and Nsegments) variables. Similar results are found in the
other pavgT bins. In general, lower values of the fT ile0, fLAr3 variables are observed for the full
simulation with respect to AFII. As tracking variables are modelled in the same way in both
MC simulations, dierences observed are due to statistical fluctuations. These dierences in
the input distributions of the jet structure variables have little impact as long as the average
jet response as a function of the variables is well described by the simulation, as will be

Appendix E. In-situ validation of GS corrections 208
For the layer energy fractions, the dierence between data and the reference Pythia8 full
simulation MC sample in the 80 < pavgT < 110 GeV (600 < p
T < 800 GeV ) bin is 4% (1%) at
worst. Slightly bigger dierences are observed between data and AFII for the f
LAr3 variable.
Similar results are found in the other pavgT bins for the layer fractions. For the widthtrk
and n
variables, dierences smaller than 5% (1%) are found in the 80 < pavgT < 110 GeV
(600 < pavgT < 800 GeV ) bin. Tracking variables are modelled in the same way in both full
and AFII simulations, dierences observed between both are due to statistical fluctuations.
The asymmetries measured with data and their dependence on the jet variables used to
derive the GS corrections compare well to the asymmetries obtained with the MC simulation.
Dierences are typically small compared to the size of the proposed corrections, validating
their application to data. Systematic uncertainties for the first four GS corrections are not
evaluated from the asymmetry studies shown here, but are taken into account by the jet
energy scale uncertainty described in Section 8.2.
Impact of truth-level imbalance on reconstructed asymmetry
The measurement of the response through the asymmetry defined in Equation E.1 assumes
that the particle-jet level asymmetry is zero. This is true on average, but not when computed
in bins of x. The measured asymmetry A(x) is therefore a mixture of detector eects and
imbalance at the truth level. In order to remove the eect of imbalance at the truth level, a
new asymmetry is defined:
A0(x) = A(x) Atruth(x) (E.4)
In this equation, A(x) is given by equation E.1 and Atruth(x) is :
Atruth(x) =
probe
T,truth(x) prefT,truth
T,truth(x)
(E.5)
where pavg
T,truth(x) = (p

T,truth(x) + p
T,truth)/2. Atruth(x) is the asymmetry at the particle-jet

level (or truth asymmetry) and is calculated by matching reconstructed jets to particle jets
geometrically, as explained in Section 3.4. Atruth can of course only be determined in the
MC simulation. When using A0(x) instead of A(x) in equation E.3, the eects of imbalance
at the truth level are removed and the resulting response depends only on detector eects.
Accounting for the particle-jet imbalance is particularly important for the corrections that
depend on the energy in the n
and the width

Figure E.6: Response calculated from the reconstructed asymmetry as a function of f
T ile0,

Appendix E. In-situ validation of GS corrections 211
Figures E.5 and E.6 show the jet response calculated from the reconstructed and truth
asymmetry as a function of f
T ile0, fLAr3, ntrk, widthtrk and Nsegments for jets at the EM+JES
scale with |
| < 0.6 and for two pT bins, 80 < pT < 110 GeV and 600 < pT < 800 GeV in
data and MC simulation. The disagreement between data and the reference Pythia8 MC
sample in this bin is 4% at worse. Disagreements of up to 5% are observed in other bins,
particularly for the jet width
and f
T ile0.
Comparison with truth response
The response calculated from the reconstructed and truth asymmetry, shown in Figures E.5
and E.6, can also be compared to the truth response as defined in Equation 3.4. Figure E.7
shows this comparison as a function of x. The dierences are observed to be small, with the
response from data and full-sim compatible with the truth response to within 1%. Similar
compatibility is seen across all |
| and pprobe
regions, for all four jet collections.

Figure E.8: Data-MC dierence in the reconstructed response calculated using the GS
dijet balance method and the jet punch-through (PT) dijet balance method, for jets at the
EM+JES+GS (top) and LCW+JES+GS (bottom) scales, with 200  pprobe
[ GeV] < 600
(left) and 1000  pprobe
[ GeV] < 1600 (right). The bottom plot shows the dierence
between the two methods.
The uncertainties on the jet punch-through correction, derived using the method de-
scribed in Chapter 6, can also be calculated using the dijet balance method described in this
appendix. The uncertainty is the dierence in the reconstructed response between data and
MC. Figure E.8 compares the uncertainty derived using these two methods for EM+JES+GS
and LCW+JES+GS scale, R = 0.6 jets. It is clear from this figure that the uncertainties
derived from the two methods are compatible. This compatibility was observed for all other
pprobe
and |
| regions.
