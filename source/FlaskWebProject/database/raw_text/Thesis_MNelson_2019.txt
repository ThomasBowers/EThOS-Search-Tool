Abstract
The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the triumphs of contemporary
science, but it is well-established that this theory must be incomplete. This thesis
focuses on searching for the production of new matter, motivated by beyond-
Standard Model framework of supersymmetry, with data recorded by the ATLAS
experiment during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. One of the crucial physics
objects in the search for new matter described in this thesis is the hadronic jet.
Before describing in detail the multi-jets search for new matter, which uses 36
fb1 of ATLAS data in signal regions where at least 7 hadronic jets are required
in the final state, the latest developments in hadronic jet physics at ATLAS shall
be motivated and studied. Particular detail will be paid to new approaches in jet
reconstruction, jet mass calculations and the corresponding jet mass resolution,
and jet calibration at the energy and mass scales. Furthermore the issue of pileup
contributions to hadronic jets shall be described, together with recent studies
outlining how new developments in inputs to jet reconstruction and jet grooming
can be used to improve the performance of hadronic jets in ATLAS and mitigate
the effects of pileup therein. The full power of jet reconstruction at ATLAS will
then be utilised in the multi-jets analysis. With the 36 fb1 ATLAS data-set, no
statistically significant evidence for new matter is reported, and new constraints
on the mass of gluinos and stops are pushed up to 1.8 TeV and 1.4 TeV, at the 95 %
confidence level, respectively (within the context of particular sets of new physics
models). The multi-jets search is sensitive to final states with moderate EmissT , and
consequently is used to assess the LHC sensitivity to both R-parity-conserving
(RPC) and R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetric scenarios. World-leading
constraints across this RPC-meets-RPV spectrum will be assessed at the 95 %
confidence level. Finally the ultimate plans for the full Run 2 iteration of the
multi-jets analysis, amounting to 140 fb1 of data, will be described.

Acknowledgements
It is exceptionally difficult to condense into a few paragraphs the numerous people who have
supported and guided me up to this point. I am hugely indebted to each and every one of you,
and there are far more of you who have helped me than I can mention here. To you all, I am
grateful to have had your support, guidance, and friendship every step of the way.
First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Claire Gwenlan and the Oxford SUSY
group leader Alan Barr, both of whom have provided an immense amount of support and
insight throughout this time, and have not only been incredibly supportive and helpful in my
research, but have also encouraged me to pursue the areas of particle physics on ATLAS which
I became most interested in. It has been a privilege to be a part of the Oxford SUSY group,
and to work with some of the most remarkable scientists I have ever encountered. Ive had
a lot of fun working with (and learning from) the present and past academics, postdocs, and
students in Oxfords particle physics group, including Will Fawcett, Will Kalderon, Jon Burr,
Nurfikri Norjoharuddeen, Moritz Backes, Bill Balunas, Todd Huffman, Cigdem Issever, Lydia
Beresford, James Frost, Hayden Smith, Luigi Marchese, Gabija Zemaityte, Kathrin Becker,
Santiago Paredes, Jesse Liu, and Aaron ONeill (to name a few)
I owe immeasureable amounts of thanks to the generations of Oxford SUSY group students
who preceded me. In particular I would like to thank Will Fawcett and Will Kalderon for
welcoming me to the group, and providing a wealth of advice, patience, and insight from the very
beginning. Will Fawcetts infectious enthusiasm and sterling work ethic was a real inspiration
during the wonderful days of the multi-jets analysis. I am also grateful to Jon Burr, who could
always be relied on to ask the difficult (and important) physics questions and provide hours
and hours of helpful coding and software advice. Finally, I must personally thank Jesse Liu for
the intense, thought-provoking, and insightful physics discussions during our studies. Jesse was
always there to provide a new take on a problem in an analysis/the field as a whole, and I have
grown so much as a physicist throughout my time working with him. I can only hope that I
have been even half as helpful to the younger Oxford SUSY generation: Aaron, Gabriel, and
Jonas.
It has been a privilege to be a member of the multi-jets analysis, and even more of a
privilege to work with such a talented team of scientists. Im particularly grateful to Will
Fawcett and Jon Burr (again), as well as Teng Jian Khoo and Marco Valente who have been
an absolute pleasure to collaborate with, and were always there with the right answers to any
questions I had. Many, many thanks also to the members of the wider ATLAS SUSY group for
their help over the years, in particular Till Eifert, Zach Marshall, Max Swiatlowski, and Chiara
Rizzi.
In this thesis I talk about jets. A lot. It has been a real highlight of my past few years to
work in the ATLAS Jet/EmissT group. When I started on ATLAS, I thoughts I would be involved
in study of jets as a means of qualifying as an ATLAS author, but the immense enthusiasm for
the field and fun I had propelled me to work with this group for the rest of my doctorate (and
hopefully a few years beyond it) I have loved every moment of learning about the intricacies
of jet physics and reconstruction, substructure, grooming, calibration, and much more besides.
Not to mention the karaoke nights at the Hadronic Calibration workshops. My sincere thanks
to David Miller, Piere-Antoine Delsart, Steven Schramm, and Cigdem Issever who really got me
hooked on jets and have taught me so much. Cigdem deserves special recognition for supervising
(and getting me through) my qualification task  thanks so much Within the jet substructure
group, I am grateful for the happy memories and wonderful discussions and workshops, and
in particular must thank Chris Delitzsch, Jen Roloff, Matt LeBlanc, Chris Young, Christophe
Clement, Oleg Brandt, Joe Taenzer, Sam Meehan, Amal Vaidya, Jason Veatch, Ece Akili, Dag
Gilberg, Ben Nachman, Francesco Spano, Jacob Rawling, and Peter Loch for being wonderful
friends and colleagues in the jet world. I have learned so much from each of you.
I must extend a special thanks to the LTA community for providing a wonderful experience
of life at CERN; those LTA dinners, parties, and Wednesday/Friday beer sessions kept me
(almost) sane, and sharing those experiences in particular with Amal Vaidya, Alison Tully,
James Cowley, and Matt Tilley has been a blast.
To close, I must thank a few particularly important people who have shaped me as a scientist
over the years. During my undergraduate years at Cambridge, Julia Riley was a particularly
inspiring teacher, mentor, and Director of Studies, instilling in me not only the foundations of
science, but also a belief in myself. Unforgettably, I would not be where I am today without the
constant guidance and friendship provided by John Fry and John Dainton at the University of
Liverpool. During my late schooldays, John Fry was a real inspiration and introduced me to
the world of research, particle physics, and CERN. The days spent working with him on NA62
during my undergraduate summers are some of my happiest, and I owe him so much for his
kindness and encouragement to pursue scientific research as a career.
To really close, I must thank those who have shaped me as a person over the years, in
particular my parents, Beverley and Gary; my sister, Bethany; and my late-grandmother, Mavis.
My immense thanks to them for their unending love and support. This thesis is dedicated to all
four.

Preface
The work presented in this thesis was completed by the author as a member of the ATLAS
collaboration. In ATLAS no publication is created alone, and the work described in this thesis
is of course no exception. What follows is a list in reverse chronological order of publications
that the author has made leading contributions to during the 2015  2018 Run 2 ATLAS
data-taking. Many, but not all, of these publications are covered in this thesis. For completeness,
two upcoming journal publications (where the author is serving as an analysis leader and
paper editor) are briefly described at the end.
Publications
 In situ calibration of large-R jet energy and mass in 13 TeV proton-proton
collisions with the ATLAS detector (ATLAS Collaboration, 2018, accepted by EPJC,
see reference [104])
The author was the main developer of the combined jet mass (Chapter 6 of this thesis) and sole
responsible for its creation and continued maintenance in ATLAS, which resulted in substantial
improvements in the calculation and measurement of the jet mass resolution, applied to both
Monte Carlo and in situ studies in ATLAS.
 Jet Mass Resolution in ATLAS Run 2 Monte Carlo Simulations (ATLAS Col-
laboration, 2018, ATL-PHYS-PUB-2018-015, see reference [101])
This work is described in Chapter 6. The author was the analysis contact, contact editor, and
chief developer of all studies in this publication, primarily interested in formally quantifying the
behaviour of the jet mass resolution in ATLAS Monte Carlo, and its systematic uncertainties.
These studies will directly impact and change how jet mass resolution systematics are calculated
in ATLAS, allowing for the eventual switch from systematics based on Gaussian smearing to
systematics based on the forward-folding of Monte Carlo jet masses. The authors development
of jet mass resolution smearing methods has allowed for the resolution systematic uncertainties
to be directly applied to many searches and measurements in ATLAS, from exotics searches to
top differential cross-section measurements.

 Search for pair production of higgsinos in the HH in final states with at least
3 b-tagged jets in
s = 13 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector (ATLAS
Collaboration, 2018, Phys. Rev. D 98, 092002)
This paper summarises a search for electroweak production of Higgsinos, which decay in final
states with b-jets. The author led the H  bb tagging study by comparing b-tagging approaches
using track-jets with those using standard small-radius jets, for both resolved and boosted
Higgsino production signals, and was also the responsible for evaluating the theory systematics
for the key Monte Carlo backgrounds, such as tt and single top production. This work is not
described in this thesis.
 Reinterpretation of searches for supersymmetry in models with variable R-
parity-violating coupling strength and long-lived R-hadrons (ATLAS Collabora-
tion, 2018, ATLAS-CONF-2018-003, see reference [161])
The author led the reinterpretation of the multi-jets analysis in large classes of R-parity-violating
supersymmetric models with long-lived particles and displaced vertices, resulting in new limits
on the R-parity-violating coupling which had never been determined before at ATLAS, and
presented this work at the SUSY 2018 conference. This work is also briefly described in Chapter
9 of this thesis.
 Impact of Alternative Inputs and Grooming Methods on Large-R Jet Recon-
struction in ATLAS (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017, ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-020, see
reference [123])
Much of this work is described in Chapter 7. The author was the sole developer of a generic
jet mass and energy calibration framework, allowing for the simultaneous jet energy and jet
mass calibration of the shortlisted jet collections in this publication, which are based on Soft
Drop grooming and constituent subtraction techniques. These calibrations were key to the
final conclusions of this study, which has gone on to change the nature of large-radius jet
reconstruction in ATLAS. The author also studied the role of jet reclustering as a jet groomer,
which had not previously been considered in ATLAS. Finally the author directly contributed to
all decisions and discussions on the final metrics used to determine the shortlisted large-radius
jet definitions, and presented this work at the BOOST 2018 conference.
 Search for new phenomena with large jet multiplicities and missing transverse
momentum using large-radius jets and flavour-tagging at ATLAS in 13 TeV
pp collisions (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017, JHEP 12 (2017) 034, see reference [70])

https://cds.cern.ch/record/2297485
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP12(2017)034
This paper forms the basis of Part III of this thesis, and the author was one of the lead
investigators, playing a role in every aspect of this challenging multi-jets analysis: from n-tuple
production to the final HEPData entry, to the determination of key systematics such as the
flavour-dependence of the data-driven QCD background estimation technique. In addition
the author led all studies in applying jet substructure techniques using reclustered jet masses
and top-tagging with jet-level variables, and also introduced reinterpretations based on R-
parity-violating supersymmetry to this (historically) R-parity-conserving supersymmetry search,
allowing for the sensitivity to stop production to be assessed. Finally, the author was the sole
responsible for the final analysis exclusion limits on three simplified models and the pMSSM
slice of supersymmetric phase-space. Since publication, the author has become an analysis
contact for the current iteration of this new physics search, which uses the full Run 2 ATLAS
data-set, and has presented the work in this paper at the following conferences: SUSY 2018,
LHCC in 2018, and the UK IoP conference in 2018.
 Jet reclustering and close-by effects in ATLAS run II (ATLAS Collaboration,
2017, ATLAS-CONF-2017-062)
The author developed and derived the jet mass calibrations for small-radius jets, used to create
the reclustered large-radius jets in this study. This had direct implications for the reclustered jet
mass resolution, which offers performance gains over the mass resolution of conventional large-
radius jets in ATLAS. Reclustered jets are further utilised in the multi-jets search, described
in Part III of this thesis. The details of this publication shall not be discussed further in this work.
 Pursuit of new phenomena in final states with high jet multiplicity, high
jet masses and missing transverse momentum with ATLAS at
s = 13 TeV
(ATLAS Collaboration, 2016, ATLAS-CONF-2016-095)
This paper is the 18 fb1 iteration of the multi-jets analysis, and highlights the authors first
contributions to that search for new physics. For this publication, the author was responsible
for devising cross-checks of the analysis region definitions and cut-flow, and also developed
and calculated the systematic uncertainty arising from the flavour-dependence of the QCD
background estimation technique. This publication is not discussed in this thesis.
 Jet mass reconstruction with the ATLAS Detector in early Run 2 data (ATLAS
Collaboration, 2016, ATLAS-CONF-2016-035, see reference [98])
The author was responsible for deriving the jet mass calibrations for both the calorimeter and
track-assisted jet masses (Chapter 6), and led the software implementation and calculation of
the combined jet mass (Chapter 6), which subsequently became the recommended jet mass
definition for jet reconstruction in ATLAS. The author also presented an extension of this work
at the LHCC in 2017.

Upcoming Publications (working titles)
 New Approaches in Jet Reconstruction and Grooming in Run 2 of the ATLAS
detector
This will be a journal paper aiming for publication later in 2019. The author is one of the
paper editors, responsible for the final publication. In addition the author has worked on jet
energy and jet mass calibrations of new jet collections, including those based on Soft Drop,
particle flow, and track-calo cluster (TCC) jet definitions. The author has also been working
on using unfolding techniques in data with these new jet definitions, and is the responsible for
the data and Monte Carlo comparison studies of several jet substructure variables which will
be considered in this publication, in order to assess the performance of Monte Carlo modelling
of Run 2 ATLAS data. Some of the ongoing work in this analysis is briefly described in Chapter 7.
 Search for new phenomena with large jet multiplicities and missing transverse
momentum using large-radius jets and flavour-tagging with the full run 2
ATLAS data-set
This is the upcoming paper for the full Run 2 multi-jets analysis, for which the author is the
analysis contact and contact editor. In this analysis the author is leading a programme of
research and development which will include the study of particle flow jets, object-based EmissT
significance, quark-gluon tagging, and jet reclustering optimisation into this search for the first
time in order to enhance analysis sensitivity to gluino production at the LHC. The author is
active in every aspect of this analysis, contributing to the n-tuple production, region definitions,
systematic uncertainties, and fitting strategies. Some of the ongoing work in this analysis is
briefly described in Chapter 10.

Introduction
The goal of particle physics is to analyse and understand the universe from its most fundamental
constituents, and to explain how those most basic building blocks of reality are formed
and interact with other fundamental physical objects, or particles. This endeavour has been
practised by humanity for thousands of years: in 6th century BC, the Ancient Grecian pre-
Socratic philosopher Anaximenes of Miletus proposed that all of creation is composed of four
fundamental elements  earth, air, fire, and water. Around 4th century BC, Leucippus and his
pupil Democritus coined the word atomos  meaning uncuttable  to describe the indivisible
building blocks of matter. This early atomism was further developed in Greek society by
Epicurus, and subsequently (and independently) emerged in Islamic philosophy. Although far
from a true reflection of the rich and complex subatomic nature of our observable universe,
these theories do illustrate the early human desire to understand and underpin reality in its
most basic possible terms.
Modern particle physics has grown from countless theoretical and experimental scientific
developments over the past millennia. The 1896 discovery of the electron  the first experimental
verification of fundamental matter  propelled the experimental study of particle physics into
mainstream scientific endeavour. Over the course of the 20th century, the electron discovery was
accompanied by the experimental observation of a plethora of new particles across laboratories
around the world. In parallel to this, the field of modern theoretical physics was turned on
its head by the developments of relativity, quantum theory, and the eventual unification of
1. Introduction 2
special relativity and quantum physics into Quantum Field Theory (QFT). With the theoretical
framework of QFT as a guide, the theoretical foundations of a theory which explained the
observation of these new particles  fundamental fermions which form bound hadronic states
of baryons and mesons, along with leptons; and the bosons which mediate the interactions of
reality itself  were synthesised into the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The SM
continues to be tested by experiments around the world, often situated at large national and
international laboratories, such as the Organisation europenne pour la recherche nuclaire, or
CERN, situated at the French-Swiss border outside Geneva, Switzerland. It was at CERN that
the discovery of the Higgs boson  a long-sought crucial ingredient to the SM  was announced
in July, 2012, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments which operate on the Large Hadron Collider
ring. This discovery is the jewel in the diadem of the SM, and provides further support that we
are moving ever closer to a more complete description of the matter content of our universe.
This thesis is not about praising verbatim the numerous (and astonishingly accurate)
predictions of the SM, but rather focuses on describing its theoretical shortcomings and outlining
how modern particle physics experiments are searching for new physics and new matter beyond
what the SM predicts. In this thesis, we shall aim to establish connections between theoretical
proposals for sources of new physics beyond the SM and experimental searches for that same
new physics, using data taken at the ATLAS experiment throughout 2015 and 2016. Physicists
use complex reconstruction techniques to measure and analyse the production of particles at the
LHC, be they electrons, muons, photons, etc. However, one crucial physics object  the central
physics object to the work described in this thesis  is the hadronic jet. Jets are experimental
manifestations of the complex processes of hadronisation and fragmentation of particles, as
predicted by QFT, produced in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC. This thesis will present
some of the latest studies of jet physics at the ATLAS experiment, including the reconstruction,
calibration and substructure of hadronic jets. These jets shall then be utilised in a search for
new physics  motivated by the beyond SM theory of Supersymmetry  taking place at the
ATLAS experiment. We shall see how jet physics can be used to set world-leading constraints
on the production of supersymmetric new matter at the LHC.
This story shall be described across three Parts. In the first Part of this thesis (Chapters 2-4)
the theory of experimental particle physics shall be briefly outlined, starting with the theoretical

foundations of the SM, the subsequent development and motivation of beyond SM theories

to connect the theoretical background described in Part I with the jet reconstruction techniques
and developments presented in Part II, and motivate a benchmark search for new physics which
the author has been leading, inspired by the prospect of the production of new matter at the
LHC, which subsequently decays to final states with many hadronic jets. These connections are
visually illustrated in Figure 1.1. A summary of this thesis is then provided in Chapter 11.

The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The modern theory of particle physics is a mathematical description of a collection of particles,
which can be characterised by fields described in the framework of Quantum Field Theory, and
their associated interactions. Together these particles and interactions comprise the Standard
Model of Particle Physics (SM), which utilises the concept of symmetry and symmetry groups to
produce predictive, measurable quantities which are realised in nature to a significant degree of
accuracy. The SM, which can be thought of as an effective field theory describing the particles
and interactions up to large energy scales [1], is certainly one of the greatest theoretical and
experimental triumphs of the 20th Century. In this Chapter we shall examine the fundamental
concepts which underpin the SM, first describing the constituent fundamental particles and
forces of our universe, before discussing the quantum field theories of the electromagnetic,
electroweak, and strong interactions of subatomic particles. We shall then move to a brief review
of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism [24]; this process provides a deep understanding of
where and how the building blocks of our observable universe acquire mass. Finally, the basic
principles of collider physics phenomenology shall be reviewed.
2.1 The Particle Content of the Standard Model
The contents of the SM can be broadly classified according to a quantum number characterising
a given particles intrinsic angular momentum, referred to as spin. The spin takes integer or
half-integer values in units of the reduced Planck constant, ~; the nature of a particles spin
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 6
value is fundamental to the role it plays in the SM, and its subsequent interactions.
2.1.1 Fermions and Matter
Particles possessing half-integer spin, such as 1/2, are referred to as fermions. The fermions
of the SM are traditionally thought of as fundamental (or point-like) particles which give rise
to matter in the observable universe. In other words, they can be thought of as representing
the fundamental building blocks of reality as described by the SM. The beginnings of particle
physics are rooted in the discovery of the electron, the first spin-1/2 fundamental particle to
be measured, by J. J. Thomson, in 1896 [5]. The electron, and other subsequently discovered
fermions, are summarised in Table 2.1, together with their electromagnetic charges (in units of
elementary charge, e).

Table 2.1: The SM fermions, each possessing a spin of +12 . The top six are the quarks; the bottom
six the leptons. There are also corresponding anti-fermions of opposite electric charge. Masses are
taken from the 2018 Review of Particle Physics [6].
The fermions can be further subdivided in sets of quarks and sets of leptons, where the
former interact via the strong and electroweak forces of nature (to be described in Section 2.2)
while the latter only interact electroweakly. There are six flavours of quark, each described
by a different flavour quantum number, and each quark type is further distinguished by three
colours (red, green, blue) corresponding to quantum numbers of the strong interaction; anti-
quarks carry corresponding anti-colour. There are six leptons, and additionally six anti-leptons,

comprising the electron, muon, and tau particles, together with their nearly massless [7] neutrino
counterparts. Putting these together, the SM endows nature with 48 fundamental fermions.
2.1.2 Bosons and Forces
Particles possessing integer spin are referred to as bosons, where spin-0 bosons are said to be
scalars and spin-1 vectors (or gauge bosons). The bosons can be thought of as the particles which
mediate the interactions between the fermions; as such they can be interpreted as the force
carriers of nature. Perhaps most familiar is the spin-1 gauge boson responsible for mediating the
electromagnetic interaction between charged fermions (and described by the theory of Quantum
Electrodynamics): the photon. Together with the W+, W, and Z particles, we arrive at
the gauge bosons responsible for mediating electroweak interactions. Finally, the gluon, g, is
the gauge boson responsible for mediating strong interactions in nature, as described by the
theory of Quantum Chromodynamics. There are in fact 8 gluons, each with different colour
wavefunctions, bringing the total number of bosons necessary for strong and electroweak physics
up to 12. The bosons of the SM are summarised in Table 2.2.

Higgs boson, H 125.1 GeV 0 0 N.A. 2012
Table 2.2: The SM bosons, together with the forces they mediate. Masses are taken from the Review
of Particle Physics [6].
One distinction among the family of bosons is the presence of what is currently the only
experimentally detected scalar particle, the spin-0 Higgs boson [8, 9]. The Higgs boson has a
special place in the SM, and we shall see in Section 2.3 how it gives rise to the experimentally
measured masses of the fermions and bosons comprising our universe. Adding in the 13 bosons
described by the SM, we are left with 61 fundamental building blocks of nature.

2.2 Quantum Fields and their Interactions
To understand the theoretical dynamics of the SMs particles and their interactions, we need to
introduce the formalism of Quantum Field Theory. In classical physics, it is possible to construct
a Lagrangian for some mechanical system or classical field which, when processed through the
Euler-Lagrange equations, gives rise to the equations of motion underpining that system or field.
The forces and particles of the SM can be understood using the same Lagrangian formalism,
where now the fundamental objects of the system are quantum fields. We shall see that the
interactions of the SM fall out naturally when one requires that the SM Lagrangian (density),
LSM be invariant under certain special symmetry transformations. This is the group-theoretic
essence of the SM. To illustrate this concretely, let us start with the simplest case, quantum
electrodynamics, before building up the various Lagrangians which will allow us to obtain the
final LSM.
2.2.1 Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
Let us begin with a Lagrangian for the (special) relativistic motion of a spin-1/2 particle, such
as an electron, of mass m, which is described by the fermionic quantum field :
LDirac = i m, (2.1)
where the adjoint fermionic field is denoted , and  are the Dirac  matrices in some
representation. This Lagrangian is invariant under a global U(1) transformation of . However,
let us now consider how the Lagrangian changes under a local U(1) transformation:
(x) (x) = ei(x)(x). (2.2)
It is clear that LDirac is no longer invariant under this local symmetry. However, it is
possible to restore the invariance observed under the global U(1) symmetry by first generalising
to the covariant derivative:
  D =   ieA, (2.3)
where it is necessary to introduce a new gauge field, A, which we also require to transform
under a local U(1) according to the following rule:
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 9
A  A = A +
(x). (2.4)
We now see that, with these new variables, the Dirac Lagrangian is invariant under a
local U(1) transformation. Furthermore, by introducing a new gauge field A with a well-
defined local U(1) transformation, the invariance of the original Dirac Lagrangian has been
restored. Physically, A corresponds to the electromagnetic field four-potential, and it is
related to the electromagnetic field tensor, F , by
F = A  A. (2.5)
Recall from classical field theory that the manifestly covariant form of Maxwells equations
follow from the Lagrangian
LMaxwell = 
 . (2.6)
By combining this Lagrangian, which fully captures the classical electromagnetic field in
vacuo, with the Dirac Lagrangian for a relativistic fermion, we have arrived at a result which
describes the field theory of quantum electrodynamics:
LQED = LDirac + LMaxwell = iD m 
 . (2.7)
Expanding out the first term in this new Lagrangian, we now obtain the original first
term in LDirac, and an additional ieA term. This additional term corresponds to an
interaction vertex between two fermion fields and the new A gauge field, and is characterised
by the e scale of charge. Such an interaction is shown in the Feynman diagram in Figure 2.1,
and it represents the most basic QED vertex. This is perhaps the most profound concept
in the Standard Model of particle physics: by requiring the invariance of Lagrangians under
specific continuous symmetry transformations, new gauge interactions arise naturally. This
QED Lagrangian characterises the physics of interactions between charged matter particles,
and the physical realisation of the new gauge field is the photon.
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 10

term in the QED Lagrangian.
2.2.2 Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
QED is a local U(1) gauge theory, where two local U(1) transformations also commute; thus it
is said to be an Abelian theory, and, as such, is the simplest of the gauge field theories realised in
nature. An important physical consequence of Abelian gauge field theories is that the charge of
the group does not act on the new gauge fields which are generated by imposing the symmetry
requirement. In other words, in QED the photons (the gauge bosons) are not electromagnetically
charged and as such do not directly interact with each other electromagnetically; this is of course
not the case for e.g. electrons in QED. The theory of the strong interactions is described by
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and is similar in structure to QED. However, there are two
important differences: 1) the QCD Lagrangian is invariant under a local SU(3) transformation,
giving rise to new SU(3) gauge fields; 2) the theory is non-Abelian1. Consequently, the gauge
bosons introduced through the local SU(3) invariance of QCD carry a group charge, and as such
they interact with each other. Specifically, we say that QCD possesses an SU(3)C symmetry
(or colour symmetry) and the gluon gauge bosons have a colour charge. The fermions of the
theory, quarks, also interact through this same colour charge. Akin to the positive and negative
e charge of QED, in QCD there are three colour charges: red, green, and blue. Anti-quarks
possess anti-colour charges. The quarks are described by fermion fields, , which transform in
1Non-Abelian gauge theories belong to a specific class of results referred to as Yang-Mills theories.
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 11
3-dimensional representations of SU(3)C . The QCD Lagrangian, including a summation over
the six quark flavours (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) is thus defined:
LQCD = 
GaG
f{u,d,s,c,b,t}
((iD mf )), (2.8)
where the multiple gluon fields are labelled by the a index, f corresponds to a particular quark
flavour, and Ga is the gluon field strength tensor. The QCD covariant derivative has the form:
D =  + igstaAa, (2.9)
and the field strength tensor is described by
Ga = A
  A
  gsf
abcAbA
 . (2.10)
Here gs is the strong interaction coupling strength, and the Aa are vector fields introduced
to ensure the local SU(3)C invariance of the Lagrangian. The ta are the generators of the SU(3)
group, and these directly enter the local SU(3) symmetry transformation:
(x) (x) = eit
aa(x)(x), (2.11)
which leaves LQCD invariant. In SU(3) groups, there are 8 such generators and consequently
8 gluon fields associated with the theory. Physically these correspond to 8 coloured gluon states,
justifying the need for 8 gluons which was taken for granted in Section 2.1.2. These generators
also define the SU(3) Lie algebra, through the commutation relation:
[ta, tb] = ifabctc. (2.12)
The fabc are the SU(3) structure constants, and manifestly fabc is an antisymmetric tensor. It
is worth noting that, in Abelian gauge theories, these structure constants are 0, and consequently
the AbAc cross-term in Ga disappears; what remains is something akin to the QED field strength
tensor. There also exists a 3-dimensional representation of these ta generators, given by a2 ,
where the a are the 8 3  3 Gell-Mann matrices [10], which extend the original Pauli matrices
to dimension-3.
One vital feature of QCD (and QED) for the physics described in this thesis is that the gs
coupling varies with respect to the energy scale of interest (the coupling is said to run). The

(b) 1-loop gluon self-energy correction.
Figure 2.2: The leading order loop corrections for the quark and gluon self-energies, where the effects
of the vacuum polarisation are included for the gluon loop. These are important 1-loop corrections to
the quark and gluon propagators that contribute to the running of the strong coupling.
gs characterises the QCD interaction strength at the vertex; consequently the actual coupling
strength varies as g2s (at tree-level), and we usually write s = g2s/4. The value of s can be
calculated at the quark and gluon propagator loop level by considering contributions from both
the quark colour interaction and gluon colour interaction loops, shown in Figure 2.22.
At the 1-loop level, s runs with energy scale Q according to:
s(Q2) =
s(2)
1 + 0s(2) ln(Q2/2)
, (2.13)
where
11NC  2Nf
. (2.14)
This relates the strong coupling at the energy scale of interest Q to the value of the coupling
at some fixed scale , often referred to as the renormalisation scale; it is usual practice to take
 = mZ , the Z boson mass pole. In the SM the number of colours and quark flavours are NC
= 3 and Nf = 6 respectively, and hence 0 is positive. Therefore, s is predicted to decrease
with Q2; this has been experimentally confirmed in a number of particle physics experiments, as
shown in Figure 2.3.
As Q2 , s  0. This vanishing coupling gives rise to asymptotic freedom, an important
physical consequence of QCD, where at sufficiently high energies (such as in the early universe)
the QCD coupling is small enough for quark and gluons to behave like free particles. A physical
2There are additional contributions from the quark-gluon vertices, but here we just illustrate the leading
order quark and gluon self-energy corrections.

experiments, as well as pp and pp collider experiments. From [6].
realisation of this is the creation of a plasma of free quarks and gluons, a state of matter which
can be created and studied in heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the ALICE experiment [11].
Based on coupling strength, QCD can now be split into perturbative and non-perturbative
regimes. At higher energies and lower s, QCD theory is perturbative, and thus predictive
calculations can be derived analytically. At Q2  1 GeV2 perturbative QCD breaks down and
we enter a non-perturbative regime (set by some QCD energy scale, QCD  200 MeV [12])
where analytical calculation can no longer be performed. This has huge implications for the
physics of hadronic jets, and the lower-energy process of hadronisation, which we will introduce
in Chapter 5. For completeness, it is worth noting that the equivalent 0 arising from 1-loop
corrections to the QED photon propagator is negative. Therefore, the QED coupling increases
with energy and the theory contains no asymptotic freedom. The fact that different couplings
run with energy has important consequences for treatments of beyond Standard Model physics,
which shall be discussed in the next chapter of this thesis.
2.2.3 Electroweak Theory
The electroweak theory is an example of the unification of two seemingly disparate laws of
nature: the electromagnetic theory of QED and the theory of weak interactions, responsible for
nuclear processes such as -decay. Having discussed QED in some detail, we shall first outline
some of the key experimental observations of the theory of weak interactions in order to build
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 14
up a mathematical formulation of weak physics, before generalising this to the full electroweak
theory. The weak force mediates nuclear -decay, based on the underlying d  u + e + e
process. We want to describe this process using a non-Abelian gauge theory, where the gauge
boson of interest should turn the down quark to an up quark at one vertex (conserving quark,
and consequently baryon, number), and the electron to a neutrino at another vertex (conserving
lepton number). Since one particle is being turned into another at each vertex, we clearly require
a representation of this theory that contains at least two elements; a representation based on the
non-Abelian SU(2) Lie group achieves this, so we shall construct a weak theory using SU(2). To
make progress, we need to understand what the Lie algebra of SU(2) is. Fortunately, because
SU(2) is the (double) covering group of the SO(3) group describing three-dimensional rotations,
the two groups have identical Lie algebras. Consequently, the generators of the two-dimensional
SU(2) representation are just the Pauli matrices used to generate SO(3):
, 2 =
, 3 =
, (2.15)
with Lie algebra [i2 ,
2 ] = iijk
2 , where ijk is the Levi-Civita tensor.
Denoting the SU(2) gauge fields by W i, we may write the covariant derivative for this
two-dimensional representation as:
D =  + i
W i
i =  + i
W 3 W
  iW 2
W 1 + iW 2 W 3
=  + i
2W+
2W W 3
, (2.16)
where we have now introduced the complex gauge fields W =
(W 1  iW 2). The
significance of these new complex fields is apparent when the covariant derivative acts on the
SU(2) quark and lepton doublets, which for the first generation particles are denoted q =
and l =
. Putting these doublets into the covariant derivative subset of the weak Lagrangian,
Lweak  ilDl + iqDq, (2.17)
generates interactions of the form ig
2W+ e. This is a very satisfying result, and we
have now recovered the desired weak interactions where the quark and lepton transformations are
achieved via the exchange of W+ and W gauge bosons, where the  signifies electromagnetic
charge. Starting from the foreknowledge of -decay, and underlying SU(2) symmetry, the
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 15

of (1  5) arises from the need to project out the left-handed components of the particle wavefunctions,
since the weak interaction does not conserve parity.
weak interaction vertices have followed straightforwardly. However, we have neglected one
key empirical observation thus far: parity violation. In 1957 it was observed by Madam Wu
et al [13] that weak interactions do not conserve parity, and therefore Lweak is not invariant
under the spatial inversion x  x. It is possible to write down Lagrangians which are both
Lorentz invariant and parity violating by introducing the matrix:
5  i0123. (2.18)
The projection operators, PL,R = 12(1  
5), act on fermion fields, , to generate the
left- and right-handed components PL,R = L,R. Right-handed fermions have directions of
spin pointing in the same direction as their motion, whilst left-handed fermions have their
direction of spin pointing in the opposite direction to their motion. In the parity-violating weak
interaction, only left-handed fermions and right-handed anti-fermions couple to the W gauge
bosons. This feature can be added to the theory by using the PL projection factor in the flavour-
changing W vertex. Now the parity-violating weak Lagrangian contains interactions of the form
i g
(1 5)W+ e, as shown in Figure 2.4 for case of electrons and electron-antineutrinos.
We have now formulated an SU(2) theory of weak interactions, where the fermion fields are
charged under weak isospin, I3 = 0,  12 (corresponding to the eigenvalues of the third SU(2)
generator). So far, we have derived the W vertices which give rise to -decay, but there are
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 16
also vertices which involve the W 3 . Naively one might assume that this field corresponds to the
physical Z boson, however the Z does couple to right-handed fermions. Progress can be made
by recalling that the photon, a gauge boson arising from a U(1) theory, also couples to both
left- and right-handed fermions. It is therefore possible to generate the Z field by considering a
mixture of the W 3 field with a second U(1) boson (denoted B) which couples to both left- and
right-handed fermions. We have now arrived at the first real indication that the SU(2) weak
theory and U(1) electromagnetic theory can be combined into one electroweak SU(2)  U(1)
theory.
First, put the left-handed quark and leptons into SU(2) doublets q,L =
and l,L
, with coupling g. We will now also endow these doublets with a new charge, called
weak hypercharge, Yq,l arising from an additional U(1) transformation with a B gauge field
and a coupling constant g. The right-handed fermions are SU(2) singlets (because they do
not transform under the symmetry) uR, dR, and eR, with weak hypercharges Yu,d,e. The
W 3 and B fields now mix to produce the physical Z and A fields of the Z boson and
photon in the following manner:
cos W sin W
 sin W cos W
, (2.19)
where the Weinberg angle, W has been measured by, among other experiments, the LEP
experiments with value sin2 W  0.23 [14].
With the mixing of the W 3 and B fields established, the covariant derivatives can be used
to deduce the values of the charges in electroweak theory. Since only the B is associated with
the right-handed fermions, these particles must contribute the following covariant derivative
to the electroweak Lagrangian:
Lelectroweak  RgYBR  Rg cos WYAR. (2.20)
By comparing this with the QED Lagrangian, it follows immediately that |e| = g cos W
and the Y corresponds to the electric charge: Ye = 1, Yu = +23 , and Yd = 
3 , again
confirming what was taken from granted in Table 2.1. Similarly, the covariant derivative for
the left-handed fermions will contain the piece
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 17
Lelectroweak  L(
3W 3 + g
B)L  L(
sin W3 + g cos WY)AL. (2.21)
This result, and the fact that the q,L and l,L doublets contain states which only differ
in electric charge by one unit of e, leads to |e| = g sin W , Yq = + 16 , and Yl = 
2 . Thus we
have now arrived at a unified electroweak theory, satisfying the experimentally observed -decay
of the weak interaction, the parity violation of the weak interaction, the parity conservation
of interactions associated with the Z boson and photon, and the associated weak isospins
and weak hypercharges. Denoting the left-handed weak interaction symmetry SU(2)L and the
additional B field hypercharge symmetry U(1)Y , we can summarise the group structure of
electroweak theory as SU(2)L  U(1)Y . Including the QCD colour symmetry, the SM can now
be summarised as a gauge field theory operating under SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry.
We are now almost in a position to formulate the SM Lagrangian, but two crucial details have
been neglected. Firstly, because left- and right-handed fermions have been placed into different
representations of SU(2)L  U(1)Y , we are prevented from writing a mass term for fermions.
Since electrons clearly have a mass, this is a problem. The invariance of these Lagrangians
under the various symmetries (or gauge invariance) also forbids the gauge bosons in the theory
from possessing a mass. This is fine for the case of QED, since the photon is massless and
electromagnetism is a long-range force. However, the weak interaction is a short-range force,
due to the relatively large masses of the W and Z bosons which have been experimentally
measured. Again, we have arrived at the same mass problem for bosons  how can these
masses be recovered without breaking the gauge invariance of the theory? The solution is
referred to as the Higgs mechanism, originally introduced in [24].
2.3 The Higgs Mechanism
The issue of generating boson and fermion masses without breaking the gauge invariance of
the electroweak theory was solved through an elegant approach introduced by Brout, Englert,
Guralnik, Hagen, Higgs, and Kibble in a series of independent papers published around 1964,
most commonly referred to as the Higgs mechanism. The idea was to spontaneously break the
electroweak symmetry SU(2)L  U(1)Y  U(1)EM , where U(1)EM is the local electromagnetic
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 18
Figure 2.5: The Mexican hat Higgs potential in the complex plane, after spontaneous symmetry
breaking where the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is generated. The circle traces out
the minimum of the potential, with radius related to the magnitude of the Higgs vacuum expectation
value. In this complex plane there are both radial and circular degrees of freedom, again generated by
spontaneous symmetry breaking.
U(1) symmetry of QED, by introducing a new complex scalar SU(2) doublet, , with weak
hypercharge 1 and weak isospin 12 . The corresponding Lagrangian is
LHiggs = (D)(D) + yf (l,LeR + eRl,L) + V (), (2.22)
where the first component contains the electroweak covariant derivative, D, and therefore
describes the couplings between the new complex scalar and the electroweak gauge bosons. The
second term describes the coupling between the new scalar and the fermions. Finally, the
third term is the Higgs potential
V () = 2 + ()2. (2.23)
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 19
2.3.1 Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB)
For 2 < 0, the Higgs potential will have minima (vacuum expectation values) at || = v2 ,
where v =
. This symmetry can now be spontaneously broken by choosing a vacuum
value 1
and expanding the  about its radial and (three) circular degrees of freedom.
This gives rise to the famous Mexican hat potential, shown in the complex plane of the 
field in Figure 2.5. We may now write the general expanded  as:
(x) =
eiGa(x)
v + h(x)
, (2.24)
where the Ga(x) label the three circular degrees of freedom, the a are the usual SU(2)
generators, and the h(x) corresponds to the expanded radial degree of freedom. By substituting
this  field into the covariant derivative term of the Higgs Lagrangian, and assuming that the
W 3 and B fields mix to produce the correct Z and A fields, we may now write the covariant
derivative term of the Higgs Lagrangian in the following expanded form:
LHiggs  (D)(D) =
g2(h2 + 2vh+ v2)W+ W
(g2 + g2)(h2 + 2vh+ v2)ZZ  2h2  vh3 
h4, (2.25)
where we have worked in the Unitary gauge which ensures that the Ga circular degrees of
freedom, often referred to as Goldstone bosons, are absorbed into the longitudinal components
of the W and Z boson gauge fields. We have now generated mass terms for the W fields, the
Z field, and the Higgs itself, which can be read off from the Lagrangian:
gv, (2.26)
g2 + g2v =
cos W
, (2.27)
2|| = v
2. (2.28)
Notice that there is also no AA term generated, and so we have also recovered the massless
photon field: m = 0. A couple of Higgs interaction terms have also been generated: vh3
describing the trilinear Higgs vertex and 4h
4 describing the quartic Higgs vertex. Precise
measurements of these vertices will be a vital goal of future collider physics programmes.
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 20
2.3.2 Fermonic Masses from the Higgs
Again, we may substitute the EWSB  field into the second term in LHiggs to generate the
fermion mass terms. Performing this substitution yields:
LHiggs  yf (l,LeR + eRl,L) = 
(l,LeR + eRl,L)(v + h), (2.29)
where it should be recalled that the leptonic fermion mass term is split into left- and right-
handed components l,LeR + eRl,L. Once again, the fermion masses and fermion-Higgs inter-
actions can be read off directly from the Lagrangian. The masses for leptonic fermions f are given
, (2.30)
and the couplings by
yfh, (2.31)
where the yf are the different leptonic fermion Yukawa couplings. Clearly, a fermion requires
both a left- and right-handed field in order to acquire a mass through these Yukawa couplings;
for this reason the Standard Model is unable to endow the neutrinos with mass if we assume
that only left-handed neutrinos are present in nature. The fact that several experiments have
confirmed the presence of non-zero neutrino masses is therefore the first empirical example of
beyond Standard Model physics phenomena observed in nature.
In the above treatment, we have focused on how the masses and couplings are obtained
for the leptonic fermions by using the l,L doublet and eR singlet. For quarks, we may obtain
the fermion masses using a very similar procedure but we must be aware of one complication:
in the quark sector it is possible for weak interactions to take place between different quark
generations, and consequently the weak interaction eigenstates of the theory are not identical
to the quark mass eigenstates. We shall start from the SU(2)L quark doublet of hypercharge
Y = 16 , 
q,L =
, where i labels the three quark generations (previously the i index had
been implicitly implied). There are also the usual SU(2)L right-handed singlets uiR and diR,
with hypercharges of 23 and 
3 respectively. Working from the fermion term in the Higgs
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 21
Lagrangian it is then possible to obtain the general form for the component of the Higgs
Lagrangian which generates the required quark-Higgs couplings:
LHiggs  
q,Ld
R + y
,
R + h.c.
, (2.32)
where i, j = 1,2,3 are generation indices and ,  = 1,2 index the SU(2) representations.
Appending h.c. denotes adding the Hermitian conjugate of the preceding expression in the
equation. The additional , = (2), is added to ensure that the Lagrangian is invariant. At
this point it is also worth noting that the above component of the Higgs Lagrangian is invariant
under transformations of charge and parity (CP invariant) if and only if the Yukawa coupling
matrix elements yijq = (yijq ).
When expanding about the Higgs vacuum, the above Lagrangian should generate the quark
mass terms. We have already noted that the weak and mass eigenstates are not identical,
and therefore there is some mixing in the quark sector giving rise to non-diagonal yijq . The
required mass terms will therefore follow from diagonalising these yijq :
yu = UuYuSu, yd = UdYdS
d, (2.33)
where Uu and Ud are 3  3 unitary matrices, and the Y are diagonal. The quark
fields transform according to
uL  UuuL, dL  UddL, uR  SuuR, dR  SddR. (2.34)
Under these transformations, the terms on the Higgs Lagrangian transform in the following
manner:
q,Ld
R  q,LUdYdS
dSddR = q,LUdYddR. (2.35)
The quark masses can now be generated by setting the  field to its vacuum expectation
value 1
. The generates the quark mass term in the Higgs Lagrangian, namely
LHiggs  vY
R  vY
R + h.c. = m
R + h.c. (2.36)
With the quark masses now defined, the interaction terms between the quarks also transform
according to, for example,
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 22
uiL
diL  u
(U uUd)
L. (2.37)
Comparing this with the standard vertices (such as those which arise in QED) it is clear that
the weak interaction between quarks, which involves a flavour change, can be written in terms of
these U matrices. In fact the weak eigenstates can clearly be expressed as a linear combination
of the mass eigenstates. The mixing matrix used to achieve this combination is given by
U uUd = VCKM =
Vud Vus VubVcd Vcs Vcb
Vtd Vts Vtb
 (2.38)
Omitting the complex phase, the inter- and outer-generational VCKM matrix elements
have been measured to be [6]:
|Vud| |Vus| |Vub||Vcd| |Vcs| |Vcb|
|Vtd| |Vts| |Vtb|
0.97420 0.00021 0.2243 0.0005 (3.94 0.36) 10
0.218 0.004 0.997 0.017 (42.2 0.8) 103
(8.1 0.5) 103 (39.4 2.3) 103 1.019 0.025
(2.39)
VCKM is referred to as the Cabibbo-Kobyashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, where the matrix
elements must be measured experimentally and the element (VCKM)ij quantifies the probability
of a weak flavour changing interaction between the quark flavours i and j. The CKM matrix
is approximately diagonal: its diagonal elements have magnitudes close to unity, with small
off-diagonal values. The smallest (VCKM)ij values are measured for flavours i and j which
are separated by two generations, demonstrating that flavour-changing weak charged current
interactions become more suppressed as the generation gap between the quark flavours increases.
Another important feature of this matrix is that it contains matrix elements which have a
non-zero complex phase, , giving rise to CP violation which has been experimentally observed
in the quark sector.
The idea of flavour mixing described here is also relevant for the lepton sector as well.
Previous measurements of the flux of neutrinos emitted from the Sun, or those measured in
the atmosphere, indicate that a neutrino of a particular flavour may transmute into one of
another flavour as it propagates. The first indication of such a phenomenon was inferred from
measurements of an electron neutrino deficit on Earth with respect to the expected flux from the
Sun. Similar flavour mixings have been observed between other neutrino generations, and, as
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 23
already mentioned, these neutrino oscillations cannot be explained by the SM as described thus
far because they lead to the important physical consequence that neutrinos are not massless.
However, these oscillations can be quantified by constructing a mixing matrix to account for
the difference between the weak eigenstates and mass eigenstates in the neutrino sector. Like
the CKM matrix, this is new matrix is also a 3  3 unitary matrix, and contemporary neutrino
experiments are working to assess the precise values of its matrix elements. One important
outstanding question is whether or not there is CP violation in the neutrino sector; measuring a
non-zero complex phase in the matrix elements of this so-called Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-
Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing matrix will provide direct evidence that the neutrino sector
indeed conspires to violate charge-parity symmetry.
2.4 Putting it all together: the SM Lagrangian
With the Higgs mechanism for bosonic and fermionic masses outlined, it is now possible to
summarise the SM Lagrangian as arising from the complete set of particle interactions predicted
by the electroweak and QCD Lagrangians, together with the Higgs Lagrangian and  field
which endows the gauge bosons, quarks, and leptons with their masses without breaking the
gauge invariance of the SM. The total SM Lagrangian can now be compactly summarised as:
LSM = LQCD + Lelectroweak + LHiggs. (2.40)
As previously discussed, the LSM can not be the complete story; it does not out-of-the-box
generate the necessary neutrino mass terms, nor does it quantify the neutrino oscillations,
without the requirement of additional mixing in the neutrino sector. This is a first real hint
of beyond SM physics (BSM), and indeed the major focus of this thesis is searching for the
direct production of beyond SM physics at the Large Hadron Collider. More general BSM
theories will be briefly discussed in the next Chapter.
2.5 Collider Physics
Before moving to beyond SM physics, it is instructive to briefly outline the phenomenology
of the particle physics expected in proton-proton colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), in order to define a few useful concepts which will be revisited later in this thesis.
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 24
2.5.1 Scattering Theory
The process i  f occurs at some rate if which can be calculated to first order using
Fermis Golden Rule [15]:
if =
|f |H|i|2, (2.41)
where H is the interaction Hamiltonian for this process of interest, and  is the density of
final states. This rate is related to the process cross-section, , where:
if =
. (2.42)
Here J is the initial particle flux in the process. The f |H|i is the matrix element
for the process, to first order in perturbation theory. Generalising this to higher orders, we
may define the generalised matrix element to beMif . The density of final states must be
determined based on a Lorentz invariant phase-space element. Putting this together, the full
Lorentz invariant cross-section is then defined as:
if =
|Mif |2. (2.43)
This formula can be used to compute the cross-section for interactions such as the production
of quarks from the initial proton-proton scattering in the LHC beam, such as the process uu
 dd where down-type quarks are produced from the scatter of the up-quarks in the protons.
The cross-section for this process can be calculated to be:
uudd =
|Muudd|2
642s
d, (2.44)
where s is the square of the centre-of-mass energy of the initial beam of particles and the
integral is taken over the solid angle of the interaction.
2.5.2 Luminosity
The luminosity is the ratio of the number of events, N (such as uu  dd processes), measured
in some time interval, and the cross-section for that process. If such a process is measured in a
detector, then the measurement will be affected by the detector efficiency () and acceptance
(A). As a result, the final number of events measured in an analysis (Nmeas) is
2. The Standard Model of Particle Physics 25
Nmeas =
, (2.45)
and the luminosity is given by
Nmeas
. (2.46)
The integrated luminosity (where the integration is over time), given by
Ldt, provides a
measure of the total number of events recorded over some interval of time, and will be discussed
further in the context of the LHC and the ATLAS experiment in Chapter 4.
2.6 Summary
In this Chapter the fundamental theory of the Standard Model of physics has been reviewed,
and the ideas of symmetry breaking, gauge invariance, the Higgs mechanism, and the nature of
bosonic and fermionic forces and masses have been outlined. In addition the basic concepts
of process rate, cross-section, and luminosity have also been presented. The SM is a hugely
successful example of an effective field theory in nature; one that accurately predicts the particles
and interactions present around the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. In spite of this, it
fails to account for important observations such as the non-zero mass of neutrinos. With this in
mind, we shall now briefly discuss other major shortcomings of the Standard Model and how
extensions to the Standard Model have been constructed to account for these limitations in
the existing theory. The major BSM theory considered in this thesis is that of supersymmetry,
and we shall briefly summarise the guiding theoretical ideas of this framework.
Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics
We now move towards a more in depth discussion of some of the major outstanding problems
with the current Standard Model of Particle Physics. These include, but are not limited to,
the explanation of massive neutrinos, the apparent presence of dark matter in our observable
universe, the various mass hierarchies between the SM particles, the clear matter-antimatter
asymmetry necessary to give rise to the universe as we know it, and ultimately the need
for an eventual Grand Unification of the known particle physics fields, including gravity,
into a more complete theory of fundamental physics. We shall explore these fascinating
outstanding problems very briefly, before outlining the main phenomenology of the theory
of supersymmetry [1623], which is a theoretical extension of the SM which very naturally
incorporates solutions to many of these challenging problems.
3.1 Problems with the Standard Model
3.1.1 Neutrino Masses
As reported in Table 2.1 the three experimentally observed generations of neutrino, e, , and
 , undergo oscillations due to a mixing between neutrino weak eigenstates and mass eigenstates,
and consequently there must exist a mass hierarchy in the neutrino sector. Indeed two possible
hierarchies are allowed by nature, and these normal and inverted hierarchies are shown
in Figure 3.1. As briefly discussed in the previous Chapter, the presence of a right-handed
neutrino, R, naturally allows for mass in the neutrino sector. A class of theories known as
seesaw mechanisms [25] can also explain how suitably light lepton neutrinos can be produced,
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 27

neutrinos, 1, 2, and 3. For each mass eigenstate, the relative contributions from the weak eigenstates
(e, ,  ) are also provided as a function of the (currently unknown) CP-violating phase, CP. The
mass splittings, as determined by solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments, are also indicated.

together with a much heavier R. In the simplest of these theories, two or more right-handed
neutrino fields are introduced which do not interact electroweakly. One may write down a
neutrino mass matrix made up of two mass scales: the electroweak scale mass, melectroweak 
102 GeV, and the Grand Unification Theory (GUT) scale mass mGUT  1016 GeV which is the
relevant mass scale for the new physics. For a mass matrix of the form,
0 melectroweak
melectroweak mGUT
, (3.1)
the two eigenvalues are approximately |1|  mGUT and |2| 
m2electroweak
, corresponding
to the masses of the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the light lepton neutrinos respectively.
This provides the necessary lighter neutrino masses around or below 1 eV. The right-handed
neutrinos are the new physics particles for the GUT-scale, which corresponds to the energy
scale where the running electroweak and strong couplings are comparable in size and might well
unify into a single coupling corresponding to a strong-electroweak interaction. A popular GUT
theory is the SO(10) extension to the SM, of which SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y is a subgroup.
15 states of a single SM generation fit nicely into the 16-dimensional representation of SO(10),
where the 16th state is an SM gauge singlet, happily playing the role of a right-handed neutrino.
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 28
Figure 3.2: The three complementary approaches to dark matter searches. LHC experiments such as
ATLAS focus on the production of dark matter from collisions of known particles. From [26].
3.1.2 Dark Matter
Measurements of the rate of the rotation of galactic spirals [27], and the gravitational lensing
studies of the fluid motion of gas in the two colliding galaxy clusters forming the Bullet
Cluster [28] are examples of the astronomical evidence for the existence of an additional
form of matter, referred to as dark matter. Dark matter itself must be massive and interact
gravitationally but not electromagnetically; as such, we would expect particles of dark matter
to be incredibly weakly interacting. The latest projections estimate that only  5 % of the
matter-energy content of the observable universe consists of regular SM matter, whilst dark
matter alone is responsible for a  25 % slice [29]. Searches for dark matter particles are one of
the most active investigations in particle and astrophysics.
A class of dark matter particle of particular theoretical interest are the so-called weakly-
interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. Such particles are assumed to interact only through
gravity and the weak interaction, or other possible new interactions which produce cross-sections
no higher than the weak interaction cross-section. The large mass of these WIMPs would
cause them to be slow moving enough to be insufficient to overcome their mutual gravitational
attraction, and consequently WIMPs would tend to clump together into large clusters of cold
dark matter. WIMPs in the  100 GeV mass range also have the correct range of self-annihilation
cross-sections to give rise to the correct amount of dark matter required after the thermal
freezeout of the early universe (the so-called dark matter relic density) [30]. The three main
methods of (typically WIMP) dark matter searches are shown in the schematic in Figure 3.2.
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 29
In this thesis, we explore the possibility of creating dark matter through the proton-proton
collisions at the LHC. The production of dark matter is described in numerous new physics
models, which produce many signatures and search strategies, and it is also predicted by many
supersymmetric physics theories.
3.1.3 Hierarchies
With the Higgs mass experimentally measured, the vacuum expectation energy is calculated
to be 246 GeV. This value sets the scale for electroweak symmetry breaking. One important
outstanding issue throughout the SM is understanding why the electroweak scale is so far
from the natural gravitational energy scale, set by the Planck mass mPlanck  1019 GeV. This
discrepancy lies at the heart of understanding why the weak interaction force is  1024 times as
strong as gravity. It shall be demonstrated that supersymmetry provides a neat and natural
solution to this Higgs mass hierarchy problem in Section 3.2.1.
3.1.4 Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry and Baryogenesis
There is no significant experimental evidence to suggest that there exists significant concentra-
tions of antimatter in our observable universe, and there is therefore a clear matter-antimatter
asymmetry in reality. The Sakharov conditions [31] outline the requirements for a matter-
dominated universe to be the need for:
 Baryon number violation.
 CP symmetry violation.
 The presence of particles that do not achieve thermal equilibrium.
Baryon number violation is of course required to produce an excess of baryons over anti-
baryons, and the additional CP violation allows for unequal numbers of left-handed baryons
and right-handed anti-baryons to be produced. The third condition is easily achieved through
a rapidly-expanding universe, causing the rate of particle-antiparticle annihilation to drop.
The Standard Model naturally incorporates baryogenesis through certain topological phase-
transitions (such as sphaleron production) but this is insufficient to account for the present
observed baryon asymmetries in nature. BSM theories, such as supersymmetry, can introduce
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 30
Figure 3.3: The running of the SM couplings (black, dotted lines) and running of the same couplings
in a BSM extension based on supersymmetry (solid, coloured lines). In this case, the unification is
achieved via the minimal supersymmteric standard model (MSSM), a supersymmetric model which we
shall shortly review. The masses of new SUSY particles are varied as a common threshold between 750
GeV and 2.5 TeV, and the S(mZ) between 0.117 and 0.120. From [22].
additional CP violating terms which can drag the predicted baryon asymmetry up to what is
experimentally observed through cosmological and astronomical studies.
3.1.5 Grand Unification
The electroweak scale corresponds to the energy scale at which the theories of weak interactions
and electromagnetic interactions are successfully unified into a single complete framework. One
might imagine that it is also possible to unify the electroweak and strong interactions at some
higher energy scale. The Standard Model is unable to provide such a unification out-of-the-box as
evidenced by the nature of the running electromagnetic, weak, and strong couplings in Figure 3.3.
There is no obvious energy scale where these couplings unify, if we assume the typical running
of these couplings as provided by the SM. It is therefore desirable that BSM theories also unify
these strong and electroweak couplings. The familiar SO(10) is an example of a GUT which
unifies these couplings at the GUT mass scale, mGUT  1016 GeV. Theories of supersymmetry
similarly offer a nice unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong couplings at the GUT
scale. An example of the unification achieved via a SUSY model is shown in Figure 3.3.

fermion loop (left) and a scalar loop (right) respectively.
3.2 Supersymmetry (SUSY)
Having established the incompleteness of the Standard Model, it is natural to ask how one can
make some progress in extending its theoretical framework. We have already briefly discussed
the idea of extending the internal symmetries of the SM, such as introducing an SO(10) GUT
symmetry which can be spontaneously broken to yield the original SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y
SM. Another approach is to introduce additional spatial dimensions to the theory, explored for
example in so-called Kaluza-Klein models. Finally, one may try to extend the external, space-
time symmetry of the SM which corresponds to the symmetries of the Lorentz transformation
and translations. This latter approach is the essence of supersymmetry (SUSY). Supersymmetry
offers solutions to several shortcomings of the SM: it solves the Higgs mass hierarchy problem,
unifies the gauge couplings at the GUT scale, provides suitable WIMP dark matter candidates,
introduces additional CP violation necessary for baryogenesis in the early universe, and so on.
3.2.1 Higgs Mass Hierarchy Problem
One of the original motivations for SUSY was its elegant solution to the Higgs mass hierarchy
problem, briefly described in Section 3.1.3. In the Higgs Lagrangian, the 12m
2-term will
receive radiative corrections from loops of fermions, f , as shown in Figure 3.4. A fermion with
Yukawa coupling yf will now provide a correction to the Higgs mass [22]:
m2H = 
|yf |2
2UV +O(m
f ln UV), (3.2)
where UV is some cut-off scale which has been introduced the regularise the loop-diagram
integral in the mass calculation. This should be interpreted as the scale of new physics, which
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 32
could be up to the Planck mass scale where gravity becomes relevant, above which the SM
breaks down as an effective field theory. We can now see that the physical Higgs mass gains a
quadratic divergence from this loop correction: how can this divergence be removed, and the
experimentally verified Higgs mass be recovered? The gauge boson masses, being protected by
the symmetries of the SM Lagrangian [32], do not have any quadratic divergences of this nature;
can we introduce symmetries to protect the Higgs mass in a similar manner? Indeed we can:
consider introducing the second diagram in Figure 3.4, where some new scalar S contributes a
term ySh2SS to the Higgs Lagrangian, thus generating a correction to the Higgs mass of size1:
m2H =
2UV +O(m
S ln UV). (3.3)
It is now possible to cancel the quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass by introducing
two new scalar fields, with yS = |yf |2. These new scalars can be introduced through an
extension of the Poincar symmetry2 of the SM.
3.2.2 Superalgebras and Superfields
The Poincar group is described by generators M (rotations and Lorentz boosts) and P  (the
momentum operator, describing symmetry under translations) with algebra:
P , P 
= 0, (3.4)
M , P 
= i(P   P ), (3.5)
M ,M
= i(M +M M M). (3.6)
We now wish to extend the Poincar group. However, the famous no-go Coleman-Mandula
theorem (1967) [33] states that, in 3+1 dimensions, there is no non-trivial mix of Poincar
and internal symmetries except for the direct product of the two. However, this restriction
only applies to bosonic generators, and indeed it was demonstrated by Golfand and Licktman
(1971) [16] that the Poincar algebra may be extended by introducing the additional fermionic
1The change of sign for the scalar is vital for the solution to the hierarchy problem, and arises from the
spin-statistics theorem.
2The Poincar group describes the Lorentz and translational symmetries of spacetime: x  x = x .
The Lorentz symmetry alone is described by the proper orthochronous group, SO(1, 3)+.
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 33
spinor generators Q (where  = 1, 2) which act on bosonic representations and turn them
into fermionic ones (and vice-versa):
Q|boson  |fermion, Q|fermion  |boson. (3.7)
Adding in these additional generators extends the Poincar group to the so-called super-
Poincar group, which now possesses an algebra describing Lorentz and translational symme-
tries, and additional supersymmetric transformations between bosons and fermions. The
algebra is summarised as3:
= ()Q, (3.8)
Q, P
Q, P 
= 0, (3.9)
Q, Q
Q, Q
= 0, (3.10)
Q, Q
= 2()P, (3.11)
where  are the antisymmetrised products of the Pauli matrices (see [34] for more details):
() =
   
. (3.12)
The dot notation we have adopted is a common shorthand for these Weyl spinors:
() := ,  := (
0). (3.13)
In 1975 Haag, Lopuszanski, and Sohnius generalised the Coleman-Mandula theorem in order
to demonstrate that the most general quantum field theories are those described by the direct
product of the above super-Poincar group algebra and internal symmetries. Having gone to some
pains to describe this algebra, let us now try and understand how its representations help to solve
the original hierarchy problem. The effect of acting on a standard model particle representation
3This algebra corresponds to N = 1 supersymmetry, where only one spinor generator Q is added to the
theory. SUSY further generalises to N > 1 but it has been demonstrated [34] that such theories are not chiral,
and therefore cannot correspond to the observable universe as we know it. They do however have interesting
applications in pure mathematics and certain classes of string theory, but we shall stop at that in this thesis ...
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 34
(i.e. a SM particle wavefunction) with Q is to produce a new particle representation with
identical quantum numbers except for the spin, which now differs by 12 . These new particles are
referred to as superpartners. For any fermion f this generates two new scalar fields SL and SR,
created from Q acting on the left- and right-handed fermion representations respectively4. This
is precisely what is required to cancel the quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass due to the
fermion f .
To write down supersymmetric Lagrangians it is necessary to generalise the notation of space
and fields to superspace and superfields. We shall not discuss this in detail, but simply comment
that a superfield is a mathematical object with arguments created from x (regular spacetime
tensors) and spinors of Grassmann numbers [34], often denoted  and . The superfield also
satisfies a specific set of transformations of its (generalised) covariant derivatives. More detail
can be found in [34]. Rather than dwell on this further, we shall now briefly describe the particle
content predicted by the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [22].
3.2.3 Phenomenology of N = 1 SUSY
3.2.3.1 Particle Content
New supermultiplets of particles may be formed under the action of Q: these are divided
into chiral and vector supermultiplets. In the language of supersymmetric Lagragians, the
quantum fields corresponding to the particles in these supermultiplets are described by chiral
and vector superfields respectively, which generalise the SM quantum fields to superspace. The
fermionic particles of the SM fall into the chiral supermultiplet, where the left- and right-handed
components of each are paired with new scalar particles. The symbols for these new fields match
that of the original fermion, but with a tilde, and the naming convention is to prepend an s to
the original fermion name. Thus, the electron, which has right- and left-handed components in
the SM, is paired to two selectron scalar superparticles, eR and eL respectively.
The SM gauge bosons are associated with spin-12 fermions in vector supermultiplets; gauge
bosons are of course massless before EWSB, and the superpartners are correspondingly spin-12
Weyl fermions. These new fermions are named by appending an ino to the name of the original
4The L and R in SL,R label the handedness of the fermion which generates the new scalar, since scalars by
definition do not have such handedness.
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 35
SM boson, and adding a tilde. Thus, the gluon has a superpartner referred to as the gluino,
denoted g.
Finally, we turn to the supersymmetric extension of the Higgs field. In the SM we have
a single Higgs doublet which, based on its scalar nature, should be placed into the chiral
supermultiplets. However, in doing this, the SUSY transformation has the effect of generating
new fermionic fields for each of the complex scalar fields in the Higgs doublet. This gives rise to
a gauge anomaly in which new loop diagrams break the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian.
Such an issue can be circumvented by imposing that the sum of the hypercharge over all of
the fermions in the theory is 0; thus the original gauge anomaly may be cancelled by adding a
second Higgs doublet with Y = 1 to the theory [22]. In this extended Higgs mechanism we
introduce these separate doublets, (H+u , H0u) and (H0d , H
d ), which generate the masses of the
up- and down-type quarks respectively. Under the SUSY transformation these complex Higgs
scalars now generate two additional fermion doublets, (H+u , H0u) and (H0d , H
d ), referred to as
Higgsinos. Following electroweak symmetry breaking, each of these Higgs doublets acquires a
vacuum expectation value, vu and vd for the up- and down-type doublet respectively. These are
related to the overall Higgs VEV by v2u + v2d = v2. Another important free parameter of the
SUSY theory is the ratio of these new VEVs, tan  = vu
. We now have the full particle content
of N = 1 SUSY; the resultant particles are summarised in Table 3.1.

3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 36
Two Higgs doublets, each consisting of two complex fields, gives rise to 8 degrees of freedom:
3 of these degrees of freedom are absorbed into longitudinal modes of the gauge bosons as
before. The remaining 5 degrees of freedom give rise to 5 physical Higgs fields: 2 scalars H0
(corresponding to the original SM Higgs) and h0, 1 pseudoscalar A0, and two charged scalars H.
In addition, the wino, zino, and bino superpartners (collectively referred to as gauginos) mix
with the Higgsino states: mixing with the neutral Higgsino states generates sets of neutralinos
0i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), and mixing with charged Higgsino states produces sets of charginos 
i , where
i = 1 corresponds to the lightest mass state, and i = 4 the heaviest mass state. A relatively
large mixing between the third-generation sfermion mass eigenstates is also permitted by current
experimental constraints on flavour-changing neutral currents and mixing in the kaon system [35].
3.2.3.2 SUSY Breaking Scale and Naturalness
We have briefly touched on SUSY particle masses. However, in the current framework, the new
SUSY particles will be massless before electroweak symmetry breaking, and mass degenerate
with the physical SM particles afterwards. Had such a symmetry been truly realised in nature,
SUSY particles would have been experimentally observed by now. This suggests that some
additional physics must exist which serves to break the current symmetry, pushing the physical
SUSY particle masses to higher scales than their SM partner masses. We therefore propose
that there must exist some mass scale, at which SUSY is spontaneously broken in a manner
that grants higher masses to the superpartners and still ensures that they have masses in the
right range to allow for the cancellation of quadratically divergent terms in the Higgs mass
to all orders, thus resolving the hierarchy problem. This form of SUSY breaking is said to be
soft. Numerous mechanisms for soft SUSY breaking exist [3639], and are beyond the scope
of this thesis, and the addition of SUSY breaking terms to the Lagrangian has the effect of
introducing many new free parameters for the theory. In the MSSM-variant of SUSY breaking,
the most general gauge invariant, R-parity-conserving (see Section 3.2.3.3) addition to the
MSSM Lagrangian which provides soft SUSY breaking adds an additional 105 free parameters
to the theory beyond those of the SM. These 105 additional parameters generate a rich and
complex phenomenology in the MSSM, however there are 6 particularly important parameters
in this theory which are worth highlighting. These are:
 M1, M2, M3: Bino, wino, gluino masses respectively.

 tan : Ratio of the two Higgs doublet VEVs, vu
A crucial concept when dealing with models of SUSY breaking is that of naturalness, namely,
the degree of fine-tuning required by a particular SUSY breaking model to generate the correct
physical SM particle masses after radiative corrections. A natural SUSY scenario is one where
the fine-tuning is as mild as possible, and as such should e.g. generate the correct physical Higgs
mass after cancelling the quadratically divergent terms with a minimal amount of fine-tuning
required. Following soft SUSY breaking, there are several important contributions to the physical
Higgs mass and the electroweak fine-tuning of the MSSM: the most crucial contributions come
from constraints on Higgsinos, stops, and gluinos. At the Higgs mass one-loop level, the stop
particle contribution is generated through the mixing (tR, tL)  (t1, t2). Soft SUSY breaking
will then endow these stops with physical masses mt1 and mt2 . The correction from these stop
and top partners, in terms of the key free parameters of the MSSM, is then:
m2H = m
Z cos
2 2 +
22v2
mt1mt2
(Af   cot )2
mt1mt2
(Af   cot )2
12mt1mt2
+ ... (3.14)
From this equation it seems apparent that experimental constraints on the mass of stops are
important for addressing the Higgs hierarchy problem, and to recover the correct physical Higgs
mass with minimal fine-tuning it is required that the stops have mt1,t2  O(10
3) GeV. However,
this is a misleading picture of natural SUSY contraints. The stop mass also depends on the
gluino mass, and therefore the gluino mass also provides a correction to the Higgs mass at the
two-loop level. It is in fact the case that the most stringent naturalness upper limits, from a
phenomenological point-of-view, are provided by the gluino mass. Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated [40] that light stops are not a particularly generic requirement of natural SUSY,
but light gluinos generally are. Constraints on the stop and gluino masses shall be discussed
in much greater detail in Part III of this thesis, and the multi-jets search described therein
provides new sensitivities to both of those supersymmetric particles. Constrains on Higgsino
masses are not determined in the LHC analysis outlined in this thesis, but it is worth mentioning
here that the most robust requirement for low electroweak fine-tuning of the MSSM is that
Higgsinos should be relatively light, typically with a mass upper bound around 1.0 TeV, which
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 38
is also in the range required for dark matter to be made from Higgsinos [40]. The notion of
naturalness is important but should not be the overarching factor when dealing with different
SUSY breaking scenarios. There is no good reason for us to exist in a natural, minimally
fine-tuned universe, although this notion is an aesthetically and theoretically satisfying one. If
indeed our reality is realised as a minimally fine-tuned one, we might well expect to see evidence
of gluino, stop, and/or Higgsino production at the LHC.
In addition to solving the hierarchy problem through naturalness, the MSSM also pro-
vides corrections to the electromagnetic, weak, and strong coupling such that the three are
approximately unified at the mGUT scale.
3.2.3.3 R-Parity-Violating SUSY
One important quantum number we have yet to consider in our review of SUSY phenomenology
is R-parity, PR. In the MSSM baryon and lepton number are no longer conserved by all
couplings in the theory. However, experimental studies of the stability of the proton [41]
also directly constrain baryon- and lepton-number violating terms in BSM theories. In SUSY
we can force such baryon- and lepton-violating couplings to be forbidden by imposing the
conservation of the R-parity quantum number, defined as:
PR = (1)3(BL)+2s, (3.15)
where B, L, and s are the baryon, lepton, and spin quantum numbers of the particle of
interest. Under this definition, SUSY particles have PR = 1 and SM particles have PR = +1.
In R-parity-conserving SUSY the number of sparticles is conserved at each decay vertex, and
consequently there exists a lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) which is stable. Typically,
this LSP corresponds to the neutralino 01, and can be interpreted as a candidate for WIMP
dark matter. Once again, we arrive at another pleasing consequence of SUSY: the RPC MSSM
naturally produces a dark matter candidate which may exist in the mass range necessary to be
consistent with WIMP dark matter and universal relic density constraints.
However, SUSY could in fact be an R-parity-violating (RPV) theory. RPV theories contain
additional lepton- and baryon-number violating terms in the SUSY Lagrangian. Such terms are

diagram on the right is suppressed if squark masses are much greater than gluino masses.
characterised by the additional couplings ijk and ijk5, which characterise the probabilities
for lepton- and baryon-number violating decays of the LSP respectively. In such scenarios
the LSP may propagate as a long-lived particle, before decaying to SM particles. The size
of the decay probability determines the lifetime of the LSP, ranging from prompt decays
to more long-lived scenarios. We shall consider specific examples of RPV and RPC SUSY
models in Part III of this thesis.
3.3 Supersymmetric Models at Hadron Colliders
3.3.1 SUSY Production at the LHC
Given the motivation of naturalness, it is possible for the proton-proton collisions at the LHC to
directly produce gluinos and stops via strong-production gluon interactions. Example leading-
order production mechanisms for gluinos at the LHC are highlighted in Figure 3.5. It is also
possible to directly produce other gauginos and Higgsinos via electroweak processes, however
such production mechanisms are suppressed with respect to the strong-production of gluinos and
stops due to their smaller production cross-sections. These cross-sections are shown in Figure 3.6.
3.3.2 Simplfied Models
In direct searches for the production of new physics, it is helpful to motivate (in part) analyses
using so-called simplified models [44] which capture the preeminent features of the new physics.
Such models are constructed from a specific signature (e.g. high multiplicities of hadronic jets
produced in SUSY cascade decays), rather than from the full SUSY Lagrangian and SUSY
breaking description, and can be thought of as models which capture the essence of SUSY
phenomenology rather than the details and predictions of a very specific, complex model
capturing all of the features of a small portion of the phase-space. Such models are typically

parametrised in only a few variables (rather than the 105 of a full MSSM model), such as the
gluino mass, LSP mass, stop mass, and branching fraction for certain decays. This simplification
makes the models useful for guiding how analyses should optimise their search strategy, without
being too constrained to a specific area of the SUSY parameter space. By basing the model
on a small set of free parameters, it is also easier to statistically interpret the analysis results
in a meaningful way. Since simplified models are, by their nature, not fully calculated models
of SUSY and SUSY breaking, their statistical interpretation should be taken with a pinch of
salt, but is still useful for gauging the sensitivity of the LHC to gluino and squark production.
The task of performing full reinterpretations of SUSY models, such as the MSSM or related
scenarios, is an important piece of work and involves input from both the experimental and theory
communities. We shall revisit the simplified models considered in search for supersymmetry
in final states with many hadronic jets in Part III of this thesis.
3.4 Summary
We have now completed a review of BSM physics pertinent to the analyses of this thesis, having
focused in particular on the theory of supersymmetry. We have seen that SUSY offers an ideal
solution to the Higgs fine-tuning problem, albeit constrained by the need for low fine-tuning in a
3. Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics 41
natural theory. We have also seen that SUSY must be a broken symmetry, and how the various
mechanisms of SUSY breaking give rise to a rich phenomenology, in particular focusing on one of
the simplest cases of the MSSM. Finally, we have briefly reviewed the idea of SUSY production
at the LHC and how the use of simplified models can motivate certain specific signatures for
SUSY, allowing LHC searches to reinterpret their results in a simplistic approach based only on
a few free variables, such as sparticle masses and branching fractions. In the final section of
Part I of this thesis, we shall describe the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, and focus on how
common physics objects are reconstructed from detector hardware and firmware, with the end
goal of data-production for analysers searching for signatures such as SUSY.
The ATLAS Experiment
The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) experiment [45], shown schematically in Figure 4.1,
is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ring [46], located at the
European particle physics laboratory, CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland. In this chapter, we shall
briefly review the LHC and the ATLAS experiment, including its various detector subsystems,
before finishing with a summary of the different physics objects which are reconstructed
in ATLAS and correspond to the central objects for all performance studies and physics
analyses outlined in this thesis.
4.1 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
The LHC is a 27 km circumference proton synchrotron located below the CERN laboratory in
the tunnel used for a Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), a collider experiment which ran
from 1988  2000. The full injector chain of the LHC is illustrated in Figure 4.2: protons are first
extracted from a supply of hydrogen gas situated in an electric-field, before being accelerated
to energies of 450 GeV. The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [46] acts as the pre-injector for
the LHC, and during Run 2 of ATLAS the protons, upon injection into the final synchrotron
ring, are accelerated to beam energies of 6.5 TeV. The four major experiments  including
the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS detectors [45, 47], and the LHCb detector [48] are
constructed around collision points wherein the two proton beams collide at a centre-of-mass
energy of
s = 13 TeV. For Run 2 the peak luminosity of the collider has been increased to
4. The ATLAS Experiment 43
4. The ATLAS Experiment 44
21  1033 cm2s1 1, twice the original design luminosity. Protons are accelerated and collided
in bunches every 25 ns. In order to achieve these collision rates and luminosities, there must
be multiple proton-proton interactions per bunch-crossing. Although such interactions allow
us to achieve the desired particle production rates, a consequence of this is the presence of
stochastic, QCD-dominated minimum-bias proton-proton collisions which do not correspond
to the hard pp interaction of interest; such collisions are referred to as pileup and will degrade
the desired final detector performance unless suitably accounted for. The average pileup and
integrated luminosity throughout Run 2 LHC data-taking, which extended from 2015 to the
end of 2018, are shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4 respectively. The mean number of inelastic pp
collisions per crossing is denoted by , where  corresponds to the average pileup over all
colliding bunch pairs [49]. Pileup contributions may arise from collidion events in the same
bunch-crossing (in time pileup) or in separate bunch-crossings (out of  time pileup).
4.2 The ATLAS Detector
4.2.1 Coordinate system
In ATLAS a right-handed coordinate system is adopted: the z-axis points along the beamline,
with the x-axis inwards towards the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis upwards. In the
transverse plane, cylindrical coordinates (r, ) are used, where  is the azimuthal angle around
the beam pipe. The polar angle, , defines the pseuodrapidilty variable,  =  ln tan(/2). In
the massless limit, this is equivalent to the rapidity y = 12 ln
, a useful variable which has
a nice physical interpretation as the relativistic boost along the beam axis, which takes an
observer from the laboratory frame to a frame in which the particle moves only perpendicular to
the beam itself (i.e. transverse to the beamline). The geometry of the ATLAS cylinder can be
unfolded into a flat plane in    coordinates, where the separation between physics objects in
this plane is given by R =
()2 + ()2, and  plane is also transverse to the beamline.
The geometry of the ATLAS detector removes the ability for the momentum fraction of the
colliding partons in the longitudinal direction of the beam to be easily measured, and therefore
transverse quantities are typically used in detector-level analysis. An important example is the
transverse momentum vector, pT = (px, py). Conservation of the transverse momentum plays
an important role in the inference of different physics objects in the ATLAS    plane.

4. The ATLAS Experiment 47
4.2.2 Overview
ATLAS is one of the two large, general purpose particle physics detectors at the LHC and
extends to 46 m in length. It has a cylindrical design, and is almost entirely hermetic with most
detector subsystems split into barrel and end-cap components (see Figure 4.1). The detector
can be divided into several major subsystems. The innermost central inner detector (ID) [52]
consists of silicon pixels and silicon strips comprising the semiconductor tracker (SCT), enclosed
by the transition radiation tracker (TRT), which together provide tracking information and
particle identification up to || < 2.5. The ID is surrounded by a solenoid magnet, which
provides a near uniform 2 T axial magnetic field, allowing the transverse momentum of the ID
particle tracks to be accurately determined. Moving outwards, we have the calorimeters: these
are split into the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters respectively, EMCAL and HCAL,
which are a series of liquid argon (LAr) detectors [53] in the barrel and end-cap regions, together
with plastic scintillator tiles in the barrel region only (this is referred to as the TileCal [54].)
A 4 T toroidal magnetic field further surrounds this calorimeter region, which extends to ||
< 4.9. Beyond this there are a series of muon detectors, comprising the muon spectrometer
(MS) subsystem [55], which is responsible for the fast-triggering (in addition to the full ATLAS
trigger system, described later) and detection of muons.
4.2.3 Inner Detector
The ATLAS Inner Detector, and its subsystems, are shown schematically in Figure 4.5. The
purpose of the ID is to provide detailed measurements of the paths of the charged particles
produced close to the interaction point. By encasing the ID in a solenoid magnetic field, it
is possible to measure the curvature of these tracks, from which the transverse momentum of
the propagating particle is determined. These tracks may also be associated to the vertices
corresponding to the original hard-scatter event2, or to subsequent secondary vertices produced
through the later decay of long-lived particles which propagate some non-negligible distance
from the interaction point. The identification of such vertices, associated with the measured
tracks, are vital for the identification of e.g. B- and D-mesons close to the original interaction
point(see for example techniques utilised in [56, 57]).
2This is just the hard process which the partons of the original pp collision are involved in, and it shall be
discussed in more detail in the context of jet physics in Chapter 5.

lower panel.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 49
4.2.3.1 Pixel Subsystem
The pixel system [52], which is the innermost ATLAS subsystem, comprises 2 end-caps (each
comprising 3 disks) and 3 outer barrel layers made from 1744 biased silicon modules, combined
into over 80 million 50  400 m individual silicon pixel cells. The passage of charged particles
through these silicon modules liberates electron-hole pairs, producing a multitude of charge
carriers (proportional to the energy of the charged particle). The application of a bias voltage
causes these charge carriers to drift, generating a charge separation which is subsequently
amplified to produce the recorded signal. These signals are used to accurately measure the
position of the charged particle to a precision of approximately 10 m. For Run 2 an additional
innermost pixel layer  the Insertible B-layer (IBL) [52]  has been added, providing an
additional 286 modules comprising 13 million 50  250 m silicon pixels. The IBL allows for an
extremely precise determination of tracking parameters, vital to the identification of short-lived
mesons. This combined pixel subsystem spans up to 150 mm from the interaction point. Any
particle produced within || < 2.5 passes through the 4 pixel layers of the pixel system.
4.2.3.2 Semiconductor Tracker (SCT)
The SCT [45, 52] is another biased silicon detector, and spans from 27.5 to 56 cm from the
interaction point. It consists of 4 cylindrical barrel layers and 2 end-caps, each with 9 disks,
through which charged particles propagate, allowing for the measurement of tracks to within ||
< 2.5. The SCT consists of 4088 double-sided silicon modules, which are arranged into strips
roughly 13 cm long and 80 m wide. Additionally there are axial silicon strips at an angle of 40
mrad to the initial strip layers, providing additional tracking information. The result is over 6
million readout channels, which provide measurements on the charged particle  position to
within approximately 16 m. Additional z- and r-measurements are provided, using the barrel
and end-cap channels respectively, to a precision of 580 m in z and approximately 16 m in r.
4.2.3.3 Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT)
The TRT [45, 52] component is build from straw detectors, 4 mm diameter kapton tubes,
filled with a Xe/CF4/CO2 gas mixture (to a volume of 3 m3) and 30 m diameter anode
wires running along the detector centreline. Like the SCT, it provides coverage up to ||
< 2.5. As charged particles propagate through the gas mixture, electrons are liberated and
drift towards the central anode wire, liberating additional electrons along the way. Additional
4. The ATLAS Experiment 50
materials of varying dielectric constant surround the straws, and these emit transition radiation
when highly-relativistic electrons cross at the boundaries between them. In total, the TRT
provides 420 000 readout channels, with the particle drift time measurements providing a
charged particle spatial resolution of approximately 170 m. In this way the TRT provides
additional information for electron identification as well as tracking.
4.2.4 Calorimeters
A schematic of the ATLAS calorimeter system is provided in Figure 4.6: these surround the
ID solonoid magnets and provide energy measurements of both charged and neutral particles
up to || < 4.9. These calorimeters consist of alternative layers of active and passive material.
The passive materal acts as an absorber; it is typically very dense in order to produce many
interactions between itself and the propagating particles of interest [45, 53]. The interwoven
layers of active material react to the particles which pass through them, and the constituents
either become ionised or scintilate, generating signal current or emiting light which is detected
by photodetectors, respectively. The measurements from these two materials can be combined
to measure the shower shapes and energies of the interacting particles in the calorimeter. Since
the particles which are measured are also absorbed in the process, calorimeters are destructive
detectors.The ATLAS calorimeters are non-compensating, and as such the detector responses at
the electromagnetic and hadronic scales differ. Dedicated calibrations are derived to account for
such differences, and shall be briefly discussed in the context of jet physics in Chapter 5.
4.2.4.1 Liquid Argon (LAr) Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The LAr calorimeter [45, 53] comprises an electromagnetic barrel (EMB, || < 1.475) and two
end-caps which are divided into three parts. The electromagnetic end-caps (EMEC, 1.375 < || <
3.2) are situated the closest to the interaction point. Further out are the hadronic end-caps (HEC,
1.5 < || < 3.2), and finally at a similar distance, but closer to the beam pipe, lie the forward
calorimeters (FCAL, 3.1 < || < 4.9). The EMB and EMEC use plates of lead and stainless
steel as absorbers, whilst the HEC uses copper plates. The FCAL consists of 3 modules in each
end-cap: the first module uses copper as the absorber and is optimised for electromagnetic shower
measurements, and the second two use tungsten as the absorber and are optimised for hadronic
shower measurements. Liquid argon serves as the active material throughout these calorimeter
systems. Copper-kapton tape electrodes are placed between layers of absorber in order to collect

electrical signals. In order to measure a uniform energy distribution in , the absorber plates
are arranged in a zig-zag accordion fashion, and the plates are also etched uniformly in order to
provide an electrical readout in uniform towers in   . The EBM is finely segmented in order
to provide precision measurements of the energy depositions of electrons and photons.
4.2.4.2 Tile Hadronic Calorimeter
Surrounding the electromagnetic calorimeter is the simpler Tile hadronic calorimeter (Tile-
Cal) [45, 54] subsystem. This comprises a barrel surrounding the EMC and two extended
barrels outside the EMECs, with no additional end-cap. Steel plates are used as absorbers, with
plastic scintillators providing the active material in a series of tiles, extending radially as a set
of wedge-shaped modules. The scintillating active material generates light which is transmitted
by blue-to-green wavelength shifting fibre optics, which is then read out using photomultiplier
tubes situated outside the module system. These modules are segmented in to three layers in
order to provide a segmentation of  and  of 0.1  0.1 for the two inner layers, and 0.1
 0.2 for the third outer layer. The TileCal provides a total thickness of 9.7I in the barrel,

and 10I in the end-caps, where I denotes the nuclear interaction length.3
4.2.5 Muon System
The outermost muon spectrometer (MS) [45, 55] component (shown schematically in Figure 4.7)
comprises several subsystems. The MS provides near-hermetic coverage of the barrel volume of
the inner ATLAS subsystems, and also provides measurements of the forward regions using the
large lever arm of the muon wheels. Due to access requirements for cabling and services to the
detector, the MS is not fully instrumented in the central || < 0.1 region. In total, the MS utilises
four different detector technologies [55]: monitored drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, resistive-
plate chambers, and thin-gap chambers. Additionally the ATLAS toroid magnets utilised in the
MS comprise 8 barrel coils and 2 sets of 8 end-cap coils, generating fields of up to about 4 T.
3The nuclear interaction length is the mean free path for nuclear interaction of a high-energy hadronic particle.
Shorter interaction lengths result in less calorimeter material required to contain particle showers.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 53
4.2.5.1 Monitored Drift Tubes (MDTs)
The MDTs [55] provide the vast majority of the MS coverage, and operate using similar principles
to the TRT straw tubes. The aluminium MDT straws are larger, with diameters of 30 mm and
lengths between 0.7 and 6.3 m, and contain a pressurised Ar/CO2 gas mixture surrounding a
central wire. These are separated into sets of 3 or 4 layers, and lie parallel to the field of the toroid
magnet in order to provide the best possible measurement of the direction of the bending muons.
4.2.5.2 Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs)
The CSCs [55] are situated in the forward region of the detector, but closer in than the toroid
system, where the particle densities are too high for the MDTs to function reliably. These
consist of multiwire proportional chambers with anode wire spacing of 2.5 mm, together with
perpendicular cathode strips which provide a second spatial coordinate, and are filled with an
Ar/CO2 gas mixture. The CSCs benefit for a much finer granularity than the MDTs, and are
therefore able to measure the muon activity in the forward region, with a radial precision of 40 m.
4.2.5.3 Resistive-plate Chambers (RPCs)
The typical time for charges to drift in the MDT straws is 500 ns, which is far too slow for
accurate muon triggering. To aid triggering, two RPCs [55] are placed in the barrel region. These
are made from two resistive Bakelite plates, separated by a 2 mm gap containing a gas mixture
of C2H2F4/Iso-C4H10/SF6 in a uniform electric field. This additional technology provides a 1 ns
time resolution and a 10 mm positional resolution (in each case, in the plane of the RPC plates).
4.2.5.4 Thin-gap Chambers (TGCs)
The RPCs, though necessary to provide an exceptional timing resolution, do suffer from poor
granularity. In place of the RPCs, TGCs are used in the end-cap regions. TGCs comprise of a
plane of 50 m anode wires, separated by 2 mm, which are held between two grounded plates
and immersed in a pentane/CO2 gas mixture. This allows for much higher granularity in the
end-caps (measuring the precision of the propagating particle to within approximately 5 mm),
whilst maintaining a sufficiently effective response speed for the fast triggering of muons.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 54
4.3 Trigger
The LHC has a collision rate of approximately 40 MHz, corresponding to a total output rate of
around 50 TB per second. This rate of information would completely overwhelm the data-storage
capabilities of ATLAS (where the maximum storage size of data-sets is approximately 1.3 MB
per event, assuming the full storage capacity is reached). In addition to this, the vast majority
of LHC physics collisions give rise to soft QCD processes, which are typically not the physics
processes of interest. Finally, there is a limit to the data-storage and information-transfer rate
of many of the subdetectors, typically at the level of 100 kHz. It is therefore imperative to limit
the actual number of events which the detector reads out so that a more manageable amount of
data can be recorded, whilst still ensuring that the physics processes of interest are not lost;
this is controlled by a trigger system [58].
The ATLAS trigger system is divided into two subsystems for Run 2 data-taking: the Level-1
(L1) trigger, and the Higher-Level Trigger (HLT). The L1 trigger is a hardware-based trigger and
is designed to reduce the input 40 MHz rate down to a more manageable 100 kHz, as required by
the readout limitations of the hardware of ATLAS. The HLT is a software-based trigger which
further reduces this rate down to 1 kHz. Different sets of online cuts and thresholds (trigger
strategies) are considered in order to trigger on different physics objects of interest to analysers.
4.3.1 L1 Trigger
The L1 trigger consists of two separate subsystems: the calorimeter trigger (L1Calo) and the
muon trigger [59]. Signals from these two systems, together with additional trigger subsystems,
are combined in the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). This CTP is responsible for making
the final L1 trigger decision, and ultimately deciding whether an event is accepted for further
consideration at the HLT, or rejected. The CTP also applies dead time, so that there is a
sufficient time-gap between two L1 event acceptances, allowing adequate time for detector
readouts to register each acceptance without overlap between the two signals; a maximum
number of L1 event acceptances is also set in order to prevent inputs to the HLT causing that
trigger system to overflow.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 55
The L1Calo receives information from the entire calorimeter, divided into trigger towers of
varying size in   . For example, in the barrel region these towers measure 0.1  0.1
up to || < 2.5, 0.2  0.2 for 2.5 < || < 3.1, and 0.1  0.2 for 3.1 < || < 3.2. Electron and
photon candidates are formed using a sliding-window algorithm [59] across the trigger towers,
comparing the energy sizes against a given threshold, and requiring that the shower from which
the event is triggered on does not extend to the hadronic calorimeter, remaining localised to the
electromagnetic calorimeter. Tau candidates are formed in a similar manner, but the condition
of shower localisation to the electromagnetic calorimeter is removed. Similarly, a sliding-window
algorithm across trigger towers from both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters is used
to form jet and missing transverse momentum candidates (which shall be discussed in more
detail shortly).
The L1 muon event acceptance decision within || < 1.05 is determined by the RPCs in the
barrel, and for 1.05 < || < 2.4 by the TGCs in the end-caps. In the barrel coincident hits in at
least 3 of the 4 layers of the inner two planes of the muon system are required, which allows for a
low-pT trigger. In order to trigger on high-pT muons in the barrel region the event must pass the
acceptance requirements of the low pT trigger and also have coincident hits in the third plane of
the muon system. A similar procedure is employed for triggering on events using the end-caps.
4.3.2 HLT
The HLT is able to view ATLAS globally, considering all detectors at once. This is in contrast
to the L1 trigger, which makes decisions by considering the various detectors in sections and
combining these using a central trigger system including processing from L1Topo [60]. The
L1 trigger defines certain regions of interest (RoIs), which are used by the HLT to perform
CPU-intensive algorithms, such as track reconstruction. The final set of HLT physics objects
are designed to be as close to their offline counterparts as possible, prior to any offline physics
reconstruction. It is this offline physics reconstruction, using events which pass the final L1 and
HLT trigger system, which is employed to generate the final set of physics objects considered
by analysers. We shall now briefly turn to these offline physics object definitions.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 56
4.4 Physics Object Reconstruction
Following trigger acceptances at the L1 and HLT, ATLAS software is used to perform an
offline reconstruction according to the recommendations of the various Combined Performance
(CP) groups. The final list of reconstructed physics objects correspond to the objects of
interest for most ATLAS analyses4.
4.4.1 Primary Vertices and Tracks
Tracks are reconstructed from the hits produced by charged particles interacting with the inner
detector material, and are required to have pT  500 MeV with reconstruction within || < 2.5.
First the raw readout from the pixel and SCT detectors is translated into sets of space-point
measurements of the propagating charged particles, giving rise to sets of detector hits. A seed
track is then formed from the hits in the pixel layer, and is extended to the SCT. To reduce fake
tracks, it is required that the candidate tracks are formed from at least a total of 7 hits in the
combination of the pixel and silicon microstrip trackers. In addition, the longitudinal impact
parameter relative to the primary vertex, |z0| sin , must be less than 1.5 mm, where the  angle
is the angle between the beam and the measured track. Additionally the track transverse impact
parameter |d0| relative to the primary vertex must be less than 1.5 mm. Finally the candidate
tracks are further extended to include information from the TRT. Following this, the entire
track is re-fitted using information from all of the ID. An extra track-finding algorithm is then
applied backwards, starting from the TRT measurements, in order to improve the efficiency
of reconstructing secondary tracks which may arise from the presence of decaying long-lived
particles, or photon conversion processes.
Primary vertices are identified using a dedicated vertex-finding algorithm [62], which searches
through the vertices of the event. Vertices are reconstructed by requiring the association of at
least two charged-particle tracks with pT > 400 MeV, reconstructed within the inner detector.
The sum of the squared transverse momentum of all tracks associated to each vertex is calculated,
and the vertex with the largest squared sum of pT is deemed to be the primary vertex originating
from the hard-scatter event. This provides one primary vertex per pp bunch-crossing.
4Notable exceptions are the so-called data-scouting, or trigger-level, physics analyses pioneered during Run
2 of ATLAS [61].
4. The ATLAS Experiment 57
4.4.2 Electrons and Photons
Electrons and photons are reconstructed in parallel from the measured calorimeter cell energy
clusters. These clusters are formed using the process of topoclustering, which shall be discussed
in detail in Chapter 5. Complete details can be found in Reference [63]. These two objects are
distinguished by matching the clusters to different tracks in the ID, where the electron will be
matched to a charged track. The clusters of interest are first identified by starting from seeds
with transverse energy, ET > 2.5 GeV, and then applying a sliding-window algorithm in 
  to fully locate the cluster. The track matching is achieved through extrapolating tracks
with pT > 400 MeV from their last-measured point in the ID to the LAr calorimeter, and then
comparing the - and -coordinates of the extrapolated track to the position of the original
seeded cluster: the two are considered matched if the distance between the track impact position
in the LAr and the EM calorimeter cluster barycentre has  < 0.05. If there is no matched
track, then the cluster is identified as an unconverted photon. To then distinguish electrons from
the converted photons it is necessary to look for two close-by oppositely charged ID tracks which
originate from a vertex displaced with respect to the interaction point. The total reconstructed
energy is then calculated from the deposited energy in the material in between the calorimeter
and the interaction point and the cluster energy (following corrections for any energy which
may fall outside of the LAr).
4.4.3 Muons
Muons are reconstructed by combining tracks formed in the ID and adding in information from
the muon spectrometer, giving an improved background rejection from non-LHC muons such
as those produced from cosmic ray showers in the atmosphere. The final muon identification
procedure results in four different types for analyses [64]:
Combined Muon : Here the reconstruction is performed independently in the ID and muon
spectrometer and, if the tracks from each system can be successfully combined, then the
resulting single track is dubbed a combined track. Following this, the track is re-fitted in order
to take into account information from both the ID and the muon spectrometer. This is the most
common type of muon used in analyses, and also has the best momentum resolution performance.
4. The ATLAS Experiment 58
Stand Alone : Here the trajectory of the muon is reconstructed from muon spectrometer
information only, and then extrapolated back to the point of closest approach with the beam
line. No ID information is provided in the reconstruction, and this type of muon is used outside
of the ID acceptance, in 2.5 < || < 2.7.
SegmentTagged : It is possible to identify ID tracks as muon tracks if they can be
extrapolated from the ID to the muon spectrometer, such that the tracks are associated
to at least one track segment in the MDT or CSC chambers. These segment-tagged muons can
be used to enhance the final detector muon acceptance.
CalorimeterTagged : Finally it is also possible to identify ID tracks as muon tracks if they
can be extrapolated to the calorimeter, and from there be associated to calorimeter energy
deposits which are consistent with the presence of minimum ionising particles. Again this
method helps to increase the overall muon acceptance in the detector.
4.4.4 Jets
Jets form the central physics object of this thesis, and the more standard jet definitions are
formed from the calorimeter energy deposits created from topoclustering. A jet acts as a proxy
for the complex and collimated sprays of hadronic energy produced from QCD, and the theory
of jet physics and jet reconstruction is rich, complex, and deeply fascinating. We shall postpone
further discussion of jet reconstruction to Chapter 5. It is also possible to flavour-tag a jet, where
the flavour of a quark inside a hadron can be identified using the jet information. In this thesis
b-tagging [65] is employed to identify jets which contain a B-hadron. The relatively long lifetime
of a B-hadron (approximately 1.5 ps) gives the particle a longer transverse flight distance. This
allows for tracks of charged particles originating from the decay of the B-hadron to be identified
as those not originating from the primary vertex, and can be used to construct a secondary
vertex. This additional information is used in various approaches to b-tagging in ATLAS.
4.4.5 Taus
Taus present a particular challenge in object reconstruction; they may decay both hadronically
and leptonically, and are sufficiently long-lived to be easily mistaken for b-tagged jets. The lep-
4. The ATLAS Experiment 59
tonically decaying taus give rise to muons, electrons, and neutrinos, and cannot be distinguished
from prompt electrons or muons in the detector. Consequently, it is only possible to identify
hadronically-decaying taus, which correspond to roughly 65 % of all tau decays [6]. Hadronic tau
decays are categorised as either one-prong or three-prong, depending on the number of charged
tracks which are subsequently detected. The virtual W boson produced from the tau decay
typically decays to a heavy resonance, such as a a or . The  decays to a charged and
neutral pion, giving rise to the single charged track of the one-prong mode, whereas the a decays
into three (or four) pions in a mix of three charged pions (and a neutral pion), giving rise to the
three-prong mode. Taus are initially identified from the collection of reconstructed jets, where a
Boosted Decision Tree is used to classify jets as originating from taus or otherwise [66]. This
algorithm uses information from the shape of the jets, as taus typically produce more collimated
jets and have different energy fractions in the EM calorimeter due to the presence of neutral pions.
4.4.6 Missing Transverse Momentum
Due to the conservation of momentum in the transverse direction to the LHC beam axis, the
sum of the transverse momenta across all final state particle should, under the assumption
of a perfect detector reconstruction, sum to zero. Some particles, such as neutrinos or the
hypothetical LSP particles in SUSY phenomenology, are invisible to particle detectors and may
propagate through the detector without leaving any signal. This would generate a momentum
imbalance in the final sum: the negative vector sum of all the momenta in the event is defined
as the missing transverse momentum, EmissT . The magnitude of this vector, EmissT , is typically
used in analyses. In calculating the EmissT it is necessary to take in to account the effect of
mismeasurement and miscalibration of the physics objects in the event, and the contributions
from pileup where particles produced from one interaction point can be confused with those
produced in another during the same bunch-crossing. The final missing transverse momentum
is calculated from the x- and y-components of the various physics objects in the event which
are associated with the primary vertex:
Emissx(y) = E
miss,electrons
x(y) + E
miss,photons
x(y) + E
miss,muons
x(y) + E
miss,taus
x(y) + E
miss,jets
x(y) + E
miss,soft
x(y) . (4.1)
The final term, Emiss,softx(y) is the so-called soft term [67] which accounts for signal in the
detector which is not associated with any of the well-defined physics objects above. This soft
4. The ATLAS Experiment 60
term can be calculated using either unassociated calorimeter energy deposits (the calorimeter
soft term (CST)) or tracks originating from the primary vertex which are not associated to any
of the physics objects in the event (the track soft term (TST)). In Run 2 of ATLAS, the TST is
used for the soft contribution as it was found to be more pileup robust than the CST.
4.4.7 Overlap Removal
It is possible for the same reconstruction procedure to double-count a physics object, for example
an energy cluster in the calorimeter may be identified as both an electron and a jet. To mitigate
this issue in a physics analysis, a procedure called overlap removal is applied following the
object reconstruction. This is described in detail in Chapter 8.
4.5 Summary
The description of the LHC and the ATLAS detector concludes the first part of this thesis,
which aims to provide a theoretical and experimental overview of the techniques used in the
various physics analyses at the ATLAS experiment. We shall now turn to the major analysis
contributions of this thesis, focusing first on jet reconstruction and performance techniques in
Run 2 of the LHC (Part II), before turning to a benchmark search for new physics utilising the
Run 2 ATLAS data-set and the jet reconstruction techniques subsequently presented (Part III).

Hadronic Jet Performance during Run
2 of ATLAS
Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2
The central physics object considered in this thesis is the hadronic jet. Here a jet is hadronic in
the sense that it is produced through initial hadron-hadron collisions, such as the proton-proton
collisions at the LHC, and is generated through the radiation and decay of a hadron (as opposed
to a lepton). Broadly speaking, a jet is simply a proxy for capturing the radiation produced by
the complex QCD processes taking place after the initial proton-proton hard-scatter event, or
additional radiative emissions during the hard-scatter. This radiation is subsequently deposited
in the ATLAS calorimeter, where its energy and angular direction can be measured. We will
see in future chapters how jet reconstruction [68] and calibration [69] are essential to numerous
searches for new physics, and how such searches are also driven by what sort of information (i.e.
decay products) can be captured within the jet itself. Indeed the central physics analysis in this
thesis, the ATLAS multi-jets search [70, 71], is a search for the production of new physics which
can give rise to final states with many hadronic jets reconstructed using calorimeter information.
Since hadronic jet physics will play a leading role in the multi-jets search, the second major
part of this thesis will therefore aim to bring the reader up-to-date with the state-of-the-art
in jet reconstruction and calibration at ATLAS, providing a firm foundation in the jet physics
which is utilised in numerous new physics searches motivated by supersymmetric models.
This chapter will present an overview of the concept of a jet in hadron-hadron colliders,
focusing on the inputs required to build these jets and how they act as successful proxies for
the original hard-scatter collision. The latter requires finding a meaningful way to reconstruct
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 63
these jets in the ATLAS detector, and theoretical approaches to a meaningful reconstruction
will also be motivated. In addition, the concept of jet calibration, which will be utilised
extensively in subsequent chapters, is also presented using the example of calibrating the energy
of a jet measured from the ATLAS data-set with the energy determined from Monte Carlo
simulation. Such calibration procedures are necessary in order to correct for several effects,
including differences between truth and detector-level Monte Carlo, differences between detector-
level Monte Carlo and data, and additional corrections due to the flavour-dependence of the
reconstructed jet, the non-compensating nature of the ATLAS calorimeter [69] and consequently
the loss of energy when photons, leptons, and hadrons traverse both the electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters.
5.1 Overview
5.1.1 Building an Interaction
Before defining and formalising a jet it is necessary to recall in some detail how interactions
occur in proton-proton colliders such as the LHC. In Figure 5.1 five identical cartoons of a toy
interaction are presented, with different parts of the interaction highlighted. Such a process can
originate from a simple 2-2 scattering of quarks or gluons in the colliding protons, illustrated in
the Feynman diagram in Figure 5.2. To be consistent with the literature, these colliding quarks
or gluons will be referred to as partons [72, 73] in the following discussion.
Figure 5.1a shows the initial hard-scatter between the two partons originating from the
colliding protons produced in the LHC beam, and is further simplified in Figure 5.2a which
shows the Feynman diagram for the s-channel [74] hard-scatter event. The physics is encoded
in a matrix element,M, containing the wavefunction information for incoming and outgoing
partons (denoted u, where u labels a parton of arbitrary flavour):
M = 4SCuu
u, (5.1)
where S is the strong coupling, Q is the energy scale of the scattering,  are the usual Dirac
 matrices [75], g is the Minkowski metric, and the colour interaction of QCD is encapsulated
in the C-term, or colour factor, obtained by summing over a traceless Hermitian matrix

Figure 5.1: A toy model of simple two-two scattering, where the additional processes of multi-partonic
interactions (underlying event) and showering of the partons produced from the initial scatter give rise
to complex final states consisting of multiple hadrons (commonly pions), leptons from hadronic decay,
and radiation. Reconstructing and reinterpreting such processes measured using calorimetry is one of
the major challenges in contemporary hadron-hadron collider experiments.
representation of the QCD SU(3)C generators (the Gell-Mann matrices [10], see Chapter 2).
In addition to the hard-scatter, there is also often initial state radiation, (ISR) where one of
the incoming partons emits a quark or gluon via the strong interaction before the hard-scatter
takes place. This is highlighted in Figure 5.1b and a simplified Feynman diagram, where an ISR
gluon is emitted from an incoming quark, is shown in Figure 5.2b.
The proton has a remarkably complex substructure consisting of both valence and sea
quarks, as well as virtual gluons produced in strong interactions between those quarks [76].
Consequently additional interactions between other partons which form the proton, but are not
the same partons involved in the hard-scatter, also take place. This is shown in Figure 5.1c and
is referred to as the multiparton interaction (MPI). More generally, the interaction incorporating

MPI, ISR, final state radiation (FSR) of quarks or gluons after hard-scatter, and the soft remant
of the proton is referred to as the underlying event (UE). The partons produced in both the
hard-scatter and UE processes can then undergo (non-perturbative) partonic showering [77],
where they generate cascades of radiation, typically producing copious numbers of soft gluons
and light quarks in addition to the hard-scatter particles. Such soft radiation production is
demonstrated in 5.1d.
The final, and perhaps most complex, process is that of hadronisation, shown in Figure 5.1e.
Here the numerous partons which are produced from both the hard-scatter and the partonic
showering form colour-singlet bound states of hadrons [10]. These hadrons then propagate
through ATLAS and their propagation and decay products can be experimentally measured e.g.
as tracks in the ATLAS inner detector and/or energy deposits in the calorimeter.
Having built up this toy model of an interaction, it is clear that even simple 2-2 scattering
processes can give rise to final states of many bound hadrons, as well as additional hadrons
coming from UE, ISR, and partonic showering. An experimental realisation of such complex
QCD-dominated final states is provided in Figure 5.3 which shows an ATLAS Run 1 event
where two top quark candidates have been reconstructed in the calorimeters. There are large
collimated sprays of energy produced by the partonic showering and hadronisation described
above, and the problem now becomes one of reconstructing top quark candidates from these

deposited sprays of energy and matter. An algorithm which is accurate at capturing the energy
and matter and inferring the original hard-scatter process is essential, and this is where hadronic
jet reconstruction can now be employed.
5.1.2 What is a Jet?
A jet is simply a proxy for particles (and their decay products) arising from the partonic
hard-scatter, showering, and hadronisation described in the previous section. The purpose of jet
reconstruction is to find a way of grouping collimated sprays of matter (as measured in e.g. the
calorimeters) into a single physics object, with a well-defined four-momentum. Geometrically,
this can be thought of as a cone in r  of the ATLAS coordinate system, with some radius
given by R =
()2 + ()2). The radius of the jet can be tuned to capture an entire spray
of radiation and matter in one region of the detector.
Jets can be formed from a variety of inputs, in both data and Monte Carlo simulations [79].
Monte Carlo hadrons simulated without any detector interactions are referred to as truth-level
stable particles (excluding muons and neutrinos), and can be clustered into a truth-level jet;
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 67
Figure 5.4: An illustration of some of the different Monte Carlo inputs which can be given to a
jet reconstruction algorithm: partons, leading-order and beyond, can form parton jets; jets can also
be formed from the partonic shower, and finally the full chain of hadrons at truth-level. This latter
example gives rise to truth-level jets. From [80].
simulated detector readings can be clustered into a reconstruction-level jet; and of course actual
data measurements in the tracker or calorimeter can be clustered to form so-called track or
calorimeter jets respectively. The relationship between various classes of inputs and the resultant
jets are summarised in Figure 5.4, where the inputs and the final jet are connected via the jet
definition (next section). As already eluded to, any jets measured in data, such as calorimeter
jets, are calibrated by comparing their four-vector properties with those of associated jets which
are measured in Monte Carlo, such as these truth-level and reconstruction-level jet objects.
5.2 Jet Reconstruction
A jet definition is required to carry out jet reconstruction: this consists of a jet algorithm used
to build a jet from some class of inputs, together with a recombination scheme [81] which takes
the jet constituents and combines their energies and momenta in a meaningful way in order to
determine the jet four-momentum, from which quantities such as the mass and energy of the jet
can be extracted.
5.2.1 Jet Inputs
5.2.1.1 Monte Carlo Inputs
As previously mentioned, truth-(reconstruction-)level jets are formed from the application of
a jet definition to truth-(reconstruction-)level hadrons/stable particles, both of which come
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 68
entirely from simulation.
Specifically reconstructed (reco, or detector-level) jets are those obtained from signals that
simulate the entire chain of the ATLAS detection and data storage process, from detection
through interactions of particles with matter, to signal collection, the final electronic read-out
and calibration of the inputs. Truth (also referred to as generator-level) jets are obtained by
applying the particular jet reconstruction algorithm to the stable particles in simulated events
that have a lifetime  such that they propagate distances c > 10 mm in the ATLAS detector.
5.2.1.2 Topoclusters
Calorimeter jets are constructed from calorimeter energy deposits in the ATLAS    plane,
referred to as topological clusters, or topoclusters [82]. Alternative inputs to jets will be considered
in subsequent chapters, but historically topoclusters have been the baseline calorimeter input to
jet reconstruction throughout Runs 1 and 2 of ATLAS.
Topoclusters are formed from calorimeter cells [82], which are topologically connected in
   or on each calorimeter layer, in order to eventually extract an energy signal and suppress
electronic noise from the calorimeter. Cells are grouped according to their cell significance, Scell,
which is the ratio of the cell signal energy measured at the electromagnetic scale (EEMcell ) and
the energy arising from the background noise due to pileup events and detector electronics,
denoted pileupcell and noisecell respectively. The cell significance is then defined to be:
Scell =
EEMcell
(pileupcell )2 + (noisecell )2
. (5.2)
Cells are clustered together based on their cell significance evaluated with respect to three
parameters: S, P , and N . The topoclustering algorithm begins by isolating the seed cell which
has the largest magnitude of cell significance |Scell| > S, where S = 4 is the default. These
seed cells form the initial proto-cluster (illustrated in Figure 5.5a). All cells which are in the
same calorimeter layer as the seeds, or which have significant overlap in   , and have a
significance |Scell| > N , where N = 2 is the default, are added to the proto-cluster, causing it
to grow (Figure 5.5b). Once there are no remaining cells satisfying this growth criterion, all
additional neighbouring cells satisfying |Scell| > P , where P = 0 is the default, are grouped

into the proto-cluster. Following this, the algorithm moves to the next seed cell and iterates
again until there are no remaining cells to cluster. The above procedure does not prevent the
formation of proto-clusters with several local energy maxima. In order to minimise such an
effect, topoclusters that have at least two local energy maxima with EEMcell > 500 MeV are split
between the two energy maxima and the cells at the boundary are shared based on the distance
between each local maximum and the centre and energy of those boundary cells. The final
topoclustering output is shown in Figure 5.5c, where the boundaries are indicated in dark lines.
The final product should be a set of topoclusters, where each topocluster is defined to be
massless and have a total energy given by the weighted sum of the energies of the separate
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 70
constituent calorimeter cells. Each cluster has an associated  and  coordinate given by the
sum of the separate  and  of each cell, weighted by the absolute value of the energy of each cell.
The resulting topoclusters which are positive in energy are the inputs to the calorimeter jets.
However, before these inputs can be provided, it is first necessary to calibrate these topoclusters
in order to account for differences between the behaviour of the cells at the electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter scales. Such differences are a consequence of the non-compensating nature
of the calorimeter, which results in smaller measured signals for hadrons than for electrons or
photons of the same energy upon entering the calorimeter. The correction is referred to as Local
Cluster Weighting (LCW) [69, 82] calibration. Topoclusters which are subsequently corrected
using this LCW calibration are referred to as LCTopoclusters (denoted LCTopo), whilst those
which are not corrected are simply used for reconstruction at the electromagnetic scale only,
and are referred to as EMTopoclusters (denoted EMTopo). Both LCTopo and EMTopo objects
have been the standard ATLAS jet inputs until recently (see Chapter 7).
5.2.2 Jet Algorithms
Having defined the jet inputs for Monte Carlo and data, the next issue is to understand
how those inputs can be combined in a theoretically sound manner. The kinematics of
the resultant jet should try to match the kinematics of the underlying physics objects or
particles that the same jet captures. The basic physics and computational requirements of
a jet definition were laid out in the 1990 Snowmass Accord [83]. This is summarised by the
requirement that a jet definition should be:
 Simple to implement in an experimental analysis;
 Simple to implement in a theoretical calculation;
 Defined at any order in perturbation theory;
 Yields finite cross-sections at any order in perturbation theory;
 Yields a cross-section that is relatively insensitive to hadronisation.
These requirements are automatically satisfied by requiring that the jet algorithm be infrared
and collinear safe. The concept of collinear safety is shown in Figure 5.6. Each cartoon contains

three lines, where the height of each line corresponds to some pT. These straight lines represent
jet inputs, such as truth-level particles. The red looping lines represent additional collinear1
splittings that have been added to the event, such as gluons radiated off the propagating particle.
Case a) is the initial state, and in b) a collinear splitting is added to the event. The resulting jets
formed are unmodified by the presence of this extra splitting, and therefore the jet algorithm
used is said to be collinear safe because the additional splitting doesnt change the final number
of jets reconstructed when compared with a). In c) and d) the introduction of a collinear
splitting changes the final jet multiplicity; the jet algorithm now reconstructs two jets in d) due
to the extra splitting. In this case, the jet algorithm is collinear unsafe.
Figure 5.7 provides an example of infrared safety in jet algorithms. In a) a W bosons decay
products are combined into jets with some algorithm, giving rise to a final state with two jets.
In the cases of b) and c) an additional low energy emission, such as a gluon emission, is added
to the event. In b) the additional emission doesnt change the final number of reconstructed
1Collinear in the sense that the angle of the emitted radiation is along (or nearly along) the direction of the
original particle.
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 72
jets but in the case of c) the extra soft radiative emission has the effect of causing the decay
products in the event to be combined into a single, larger jet. In b) the jet algorithm is infrared
safe whilst in c) is it infrared unsafe.
Many early jet algorithms suffered from being collinear and/or infrared (IRC) unsafe.
Promising early IRC safe algorithms, such as the MidPoint algorithm [84], involved sorting
nearby particles or calorimeter energy deposits in to geometrical cones of some fixed size, based
on some distance measure between those particles or energy deposits. Modern IRC safe jet
algorithms used in ATLAS and CMS, referred to as sequential recombination algorithms [68,
85], combine different jet inputs i and j, with detector-frame coordinates (i, i) and (j, j)
respectively. The combination is based on some distance measure dij, and produces a jet of
some radius R. In these recombination algorithms the distance measure is of the form:
dij = min(p2pT,i, p
R2ij
, (5.3)
where Rij =
(j  i)2 + (i  j)2 and the distance between the ith input and the beam
is, by construction, diB = p2pT,i. The p parameter takes values of 1, 0, 1, corresponding to three
different jet algorithms. These are referred to as the anti-kt [85], Cambridge-Aachen [86], and
kt [87] algorithms respectively. The anti-kt algorithm combines the hardest (highest pT) jet
inputs first, building the core of a jet containing the highest momentum density and then working
outwards in momentum space to build the remains of the jet from softer inputs. This gives
rise to highly conical jets in   . The Cambridge-Aachen approach uses a purely geometric
distance measure, based only on the Rij between the inputs, and the kt works in a similar
way to the anti-kt, but builds up the jet from the softest inputs first. An example of the jets
formed from these three algorithms is provided in Figure 5.8.
In ATLAS the anti-kt algorithm is used to build jets of size R = 0.4 from electromagnetic
scale topoclusters (EMTopo), giving rise to so-called AntiKt4EMTopo jets, or small-radius jets.
Truth-level particles from Monte Carlo simulation are also used to construct truth jets, and in
ATLAS the standard R = 0.4 jets made from truth particles are referred to as AntiKt4EMTruth
jets. These have been used in ATLAS throughout Run 1 and Run 2. Anti-kt was chosen
because it provides geometrically conical jets. It has been implemented in the FastJet [88] jet
reconstruction software package, and is computationally fast when compared with many other

approaches to jet reconstruction, (see Figure 5.9), with a computation time for N inputs scaling
like O(N logN) [68, 88].
The anti-kt algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. From the list of all jet inputs (topoclusters, or truth-level particles, ...) determine all possible
dij between each input and all diB between an input and the beam (see Figure 5.10).
2. If the min(dij) < diB, combine the i and j inputs and return to the start.
3. Otherwise, declare input i to be a jet, remove it from the list of inputs, and return to the start.
4. Iterate until there are no remaining inputs in the list, such that all of the original inputs
have been either classified as a jet or as part of a jet.
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 74

various different jet reconstruction algorithms. The sequential recombination algorithms are the most
computationally efficient for a given number of input clusters, often by several orders of magnitude.
From [68].
Once the jet has been constructed using the jet algorithm, the final step in the jet definition
is to apply a recombination scheme which provides the jet with a meaningful four-momentum.
In ATLAS the so-called E-scheme [81, 88] is adopted, whereby the total jet four-momentum
is calculated by summing the four-momenta of each of the jet inputs. How one can extract
important quantities from the jet four-momentum forms an important part of this thesis, and
in particular forms the basis of the jet mass discussion in the next chapter.
5.2.3 Jet Grooming
So-far the reconstruction of R = 0.4 jets has been discussed, as these are the standard jets
adopted for many analyses in ATLAS. It is possible to construct jets of any radius, and in
ATLAS the second type of jet considered is the so-called large-radius jet. Typically a radius of
size R = 1.0 is used.
The need for large-radius jets in ATLAS can be understood by considering the decays of heavy
particles, such as W/Z bosons or top quarks. Consider the hadronically-decaying W boson, W
 qq. It is reasonable to imagine that each of the quarks produced in this decay would undergo
hadronisation and the resultant bound states would be reconstructed as a single AntiKt4EMTopo
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 75

adopted by ATLAS. Clusters are grouped in    space based their separation from other clusters
and from the beam itself. This distance measure depends on the geometrical separation of clusters in
  , the inverse square of the cluster transverse momenta, and the desired radius of the final jets.
jet per initiator quark. However, the very high centre-of-mass energy of the pp collisions in the
LHC often give rise to vector bosons with a much higher transverse momentum than their mass.
In this case, the decay products of such a W would be more collimated along the direction of the
W s momentum. In a two-body decay such asW  qq the angular separation Rqq between the
decay products depends on theW mass and transverse momentum according (approximately) to:
Rqq 
x(1 x)
, (5.4)
where x is the momentum fraction carried by each of the two quarks. The decaying quarks
will have approximately the same momentum, and so the above expression reduces to Rqq 
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 76
2mW/pT. For a sufficiently boosted W boson, the angle between the decay products can be
small enough for those decaying quarks to be exceptionally collimated. W s produced at a pT
in the 400  500 GeV range will decay in to quarks with an angular separation around 0.4,
and so resulting parton showers of those quarks will overlap such that they can no longer be
separately resolved in a jet of size R = 0.4. Instead a jet of size R = 1.0 can be used to capture
the entire hadronic decay of the W . It is for this reason that large-radius jet reconstruction is
crucial when dealing with heavy particles propagating through the detector at high transverse
momenta, and particles of this nature are said to have a high Lorentz boost (often deemed to be
boosted). Since these R = 1.0 jets are typically used to reconstruct the hadronic decay of heavy
particles, they need to be built from topoclusters which are calibrated to the hadronic scale, and
consequently are build from LCW-calibrated topoclusters. We refer to these as AntiKt10LCTopo
jets in the ATLAS nomenclature.
One implication of using larger jets is that they are more susceptible to contamination from
several sources: radiation from out-of-time pileup in the high-luminosity conditions of the LHC;
multiple parton interactions from the underlying event; and the presence of softer particles from
showering effects. These soft contaminations can diminish the measured resolution of the jet,
and need to be combated. One popular approach for dealing with this is jet grooming [68],
where an algorithm is applied which attempts to remove the soft particle contamination in the
R = 1.0 jet, without removing the component from the hard-scatter which is endowed with
the meaningful physics. In Chapter 7 the concept of jet grooming and its implications for jet
performance will be discussed in detail, and several different jet groomers will be presented and
analysed. Section 5.3.2.1 will focus on one example of a jet groomer, jet trimming [89], which
has been used as the de-facto jet grooming algorithm in ATLAS [90] until very recently.
5.3 Calibration at the Jet Energy Scale (JES)
Having presented the method of reconstructing both small and large-radius jets in ATLAS,
the next important step is to calibrate these objects beyond the EM and LCW schemes. This
section briefly summarises the jet calibration chain for the jet energy scale (JES) [91] calibration.
The JES derives calibrations which first corrects the energy of a reconstruction-level jet in

with the energy of that reconstruction-level jet.
5.3.1 Small-Radius Jets
The complete chain for small-R jets is shown in Figure 5.11, and each of these components
will now be briefly summarised.
5.3.1.1 Origin Correction
Jets are reconstructed from inputs defined in the detector reference frame, and are therefore
pointing in some direction with respect to the centre of the ATLAS detector. The purpose of
the origin correction is to recalculate the four-momentum of all jets such that they are pointing
in some direction now with respect to the primary vertex associated with the hard-scatter event,
while keeping the energy of the jet constant. This has the effect of improving the  resolution in
Monte Carlo, defined to be the residual of reco-level jet  and the truth-level jet , reco  true,
where reco is the origin-corrected, reconstruction-level jet . This should be distinguished from
the  in the detector frame of reference, which is also used in jet calibrations and shall be denoted
det. The origin correction is applied in this way to jets in the 2015 and 2016 ATLAS data-set,
but from 2017 onwards this origin correction was automatically applied to the clusters before any
jet reconstruction takes place (and would therefore not form part of the jet calibration chain).
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 78
5.3.1.2 Jet Area and Residual Correction
The purpose of the jet area and residual corrections is to remove any additional energy which
comes from particles and radiation produced from in-time and out-of-time pileup, and would
contribute significant background noise to the jet reconstruction in the event.
The jet area [92, 93] (also known as the catchment area), A, is a way of defining the region
of    space where contributions from pileup and the underlying event affects the kinematics
of the jet. In order to form an area out of the point-like topocluster jet inputs, the active area
method [92] is employed in ATLAS jet reconstruction. 2 In this approach, a large set of randomly
distributed particles (referred to as ghosts), each with an infinitesimal transverse momentum, is
added to the list of topocluster inputs. The resulting four-vector of the final jet is completely
unmodified due to the use of the infrared-safe anti-kt algorithm, and the active area of the jet is
the ratio of the number of ghosts clustered into the jet to the number of ghosts per unit area
in the    grid of ATLAS, g. A dense coverage of ghosts is injected into the jet    grid
of topoclusters, and the final area is determined by averaging over many measurements with
different sets of ghosts used. Putting this together, the full four-vector jet area is then:
A = lim
ggt
, (5.5)
where the summation runs over all ghosts gi clustered within a jet J , and ggt is the ghost
transverse momentum density. The topoclusters and ghosts will all be clustered to form the jet.
As a result, due to pileup contributions in an event being (approximately) randomly-distributed,
the resulting jet area will provide a measure of how susceptible the jet is to pileup contributions.
The final ingredient to the area calculation is the pT density of pileup events, which is the
transverse momentum per unit area added to the event by pileup. The density, , is calculated
from the median of the pT/A distribution of all the i reconstructed R = 0.4 jets in the event:
 = median
. (5.6)
2A simplification of the jet area comes from visualising the reconstructed jet as a geometrical cone, of radius
R, such that jet area is then simply R2.
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 79
For simplicity, the  was taken as a constant with respect to the jet  until recent developments
which incorporated the jet -dependence into the final  calculation.
The pileup correction is now applied to the jet four-vector in its entirety, producing the
new corrected jet four-momentum, pcorr :
pcorr = p  A, (5.7)
and this reduces to a single correction on the reconstruction-level jet pT,
reco,corr
T = p
T   A. (5.8)
Following the jet area subtraction, two residual corrections to the pT are applied to remove
any additional dependence on the in- and out-of-time pileup contributions. These additional
contributions can arise from high-occupancy regions of the calorimeter which are not fully
considered in the  calculation. The residual pT-dependence on the in-time pileup is investigated
by considering the number of primary vertices in per event, NPV, whilst out-of-time pileup
dependence is inferred from the number of interactions per bunch-crossing, . The residual
pT is defined as the difference between the reconstructed jet pT and the pT of a geometrically
matched truth jet (which is by definition insensitive to pileup). The truth jet is geometrically
matched to be within a R < 0.3, where R =
(reco  true)2 + (reco  true)2.
The residual pT dependencies on NPV and  are observed to be roughly linear in nature.
The linear fits are parametrised by the gradients  and  respectively, where different  and 
terms are determined for different values of the jet . Once the  and  coefficients have been
smoothly extracted for different jet  they can be used to derive the fully-corrected jet preco,corrT ,
which now takes into account the area subtraction and the NPV and -dependence:
reco,corr
T = p
T   A  (NPV  1)   . (5.9)
The results of applying first the jet area correction, and then the full residual correction,
are shown in Figure 5.12. The jet pT dependence on NPV and  is removed by applying these
pileup and residual corrections, producing new corrected jets which are ready to be calibrated

at the jet energy scale.
5.3.1.3 Monte Carlo -JES Correction
Having performed the jet area subtraction on the R = 0.4 jets, we are now in a position to
derive corrections to the energy and  (beyond the initial origin correction) of those same jets.
For these R = 0.4 jets calculated at the Monte Carlo reconstruction-level, the purpose of the jet
energy scale (JES) calibration is to correct the jet energy determined at the reconstruction-level
such that it is consistent with energy determined from geometrically matched truth-level jets,
to within a few percent of the true value.
The jet energy response, RE, is defined as the ratio of the jet energy determined at the
detector-level (i.e. as determined through the Monte Carlo-simulation of the ATLAS calorimeters)
to the energy calculated from truth-level jets which are geometrically matched to be within
R < 0.3 of the reconstruction-level jets. The response function is defined as:
Ereco
Etrue
, (5.10)
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 81
where reco and true label the MC reconstruction-level and truth-level quantities re-
spectively. The jet responses are different to (and typically smaller than) unity due to the
non-compensating nature of the calorimeter, the presence of inactive material in the detectors,
detector noise thresholds giving rise to some signal losses, the leakage of energy due to particles
falling outside the calorimeter, and out-of-cone effects where particles which should fall into
the detector-level jet cone do not fall into the truth-level cone. The simulated topoclusters, from
which the detector-level jets are reconstructed, may also be split and this has a direct effect on
the mass of the reconstructed jet. Implications for the jet mass scale shall be discussed in the
next chapter.
The calibrations determined for R = 0.4 jets are derived using samples of QCD dijets
produced in simulated LHC pp conditions at collision energies of 13 TeV. The jet energy is
calibrated to truth-level using the technique of numerical inversion. An energy calibration
is determined by first calculating the jet energy response in bins of the det and Etrue and
extracting the mean of a Gaussian fit to each response. The average response as function of det,
for different bins in the truth jet energy, is depicted in Figure 5.13a for AntiKt4EMTopo jets.
The mean jet energy responses are parametrised in Etrue, but numerical inversion transforms
them into a function of Ereco, for each jet det bin . This resulting energy response is then fitted
according to a multi-logarithmic groom function, again for each det bin. This groom function
is a parameterisation of the energy loss for particles showering in a calorimeter. This new
fitted quantity is referred to as the calibration function, F calibm, (Ereco). There is one calibration
function per det bin. The JES-calibrated jet energy is then defined:
ErecoJES =
Ereco
F calibm,
(Ereco). (5.11)
The second stage of the -JES calibration corrects for the differences between the recon-
struction and truth-level jet . As the  is a dimensionless quantity, a calibration is derived
based on the residual  and not the  response. The residual considered is:
 = reco  true. (5.12)

energy response. From [91].
The final  residuals are determined as a function of Etrue, and are applied to the JES-
calibrated jets in bins of the same Etrue. The typical residual correction to the jet  is small.
Putting all of this together, the jets have now been origin and pileup corrected, and calibrated
at the Monte Carlo reconstruction-level to truth-level, in both energy and . After correcting
for the -JES, the closure3 of the AntiKt4EMTopo jets is well within 5 % of unity, and within 2
% for the majority of the jet energy and  phase-space, particularly at higher jet energies.

degree of non-closure means that the jet calibration method closes well.

5.3.1.4 Global Sequential Calibration
Following the -JES calibration, an additional Global Sequential Calibration [69, 91] (GSC)
is applied to correct for the additional differences in the energy distribution and calorimeter
shower shape of the jets, and to also improve the jet resolution. These effects arise from the
dependence of the jet on different quark flavours, including the dependence on the quarks and
gluons initiating the jet, as well as the effect of jets passing through the calorimeter subsystems
and being misidentified as muons (punch-through). A quark-initiated jet will typically include a
few hadrons contributing a large fraction of the total jet pT, and will therefore penetrate deeper
into the calorimeter. However, a gluon-initiated jet will typically carry more soft radiation and
lower pT constituents, leading to a smaller measurable response in the calorimeter and a shower
shape with a larger transverse profile, i.e. a larger jet width. For AntiKt4EMTopo jets, five
observables have been identified, based on Run 1 ATLAS studies [69], which help to reduce the
JES resolution and flavour-dependence of the jets when applied as a correction through this GSC.
For each observable a jet pT response is constructed from QCD dijets Monte Carlo events, and
this response is numerically inverted in order to derive a correction to the jet four-momentum
as a function of the jet ptrueT and det. The effect of each correction is to remove the dependence
of the jet response on that particular observable, whilst ensuring that the jet energy at the
electromagnetic scale remains unmodified. The corrections from these responses are applied
sequentially:
 fTile0: the fraction of jet energy measured in the first layer of the hadronic tile calorimeter,
extending up to |det| < 1.7.
 fLAr3: the fraction of jet energy measured in the third layer of the electromagnetic LAr
calorimeter, extending up to |det| < 3.5.
 ntrack: the inner detector track multiplicity (|det| < 2.5), where the tracks must have pT
> 1 GeV, and be associated with a jet.
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 84
 Wtrack: the average pT-weighted transverse difference in the    plane between the axis
(defining the geometrical centre) of the jet and all associated inner detector tracks with pT
> 1 GeV.
 nsegments: the multiplicity of muon tracks associated with the jet, extending up to |det| <
The Monte Carlo jet pT response as a function of each of the five GSC observables is shown
in Figure 5.14. Features such as the spikes at fTile0 = 0 come from the leakage of jet energy
outside of the electromagnetic calorimeter. In spite of such features, the closure is observed to
be within 2 % of unity after the full GSC is applied.
5.3.1.5 In situ JES
The in situ calibration is now performed in order to correct the jet energy scale as measured in
data to the reconstruction-level Monte Carlo jet energy scale. This correction is necessary so that
the jet energy as measured in real ATLAS data can be faithfully compared with the simulated
jet energy, both at reconstruction-level and truth-level. The in situ calibration consists of a
chain of sub-calibrations:
 Dijet -intercalibration.
 Z + jet balance JES calibration (20 GeV < pT < 500 GeV).
  + jet balance JES calibration (36 GeV < pT < 950 GeV).
 Multi-jet balance JES calibration (300 GeV < pT < 2000 GeV).
The -intercalibration is derived using both data and Monte Carlo; it uses dijet events with
jets that are calibrated up to the GSC, selecting central jets (|det| < 0.8) in order to calibrate
forward jets (0.8 < |det| < 4.5). In each selected dijet event a well-calibrated reference jet is
isolated in the central region and is balanced in its transverse momentum against a probe jet in
the forward region, where these two jets have transverse momenta prefT and p
probe
T respectively.
Defining pavgT as the average of these reference and probe transverse momenta allows one to
define the asymmetry, A, and relative jet response Rint:

Jets which have then been calibrared up to the -intercalibration stage are used in the Z +
jet and  + jet balance, the next stage of the in situ calibration. There are two approaches
to deriving each of these calibrations: direct balance and missing projection fraction (MPF).
In the direct balance method the transverse momentum balance, RDB, is calculated from the
ratio of the transverse momentum of the leading jet, which is back-to-back with some angle 
to a photon or leptonically-decaying Z boson reference object, to the transverse momentum
of that same reference object (see the illustration in Figure 5.16):

where prefT = pVT | cos((V, jet1))| and V refers to the reference photon or Z boson.
In the MPF approach the well-defined reference Z or photon is instead balanced against the
entire hadronic recoil of the event4. In this way the MPF response represents the calorimeter
transverse momentum response to the total hadronic recoil per event:

4The hadronic recoil corresponds to the set of all other particles produced in the event, other than the
reference object, typically from the hadronisation of proton remnants and gluon ISR.

The balances are calculated using events in 2015 data (black), Monte Carlo Powheg + Pythia (red),
and Monte Carlo Sherpa (blue). The lower pad ratio gives the size of the correction to apply to

where n is a unit vector along the direction of the reference object, ErefT is the missing
transverse momentum of the reference object, and EmissT is the missing transverse momentum
vector calculated directly from the negative sum of the transverse momenta of the topoclusters
in the event. The direct balance and MPF methods are used in tandem as a cross-validation of
the Z/ + jet correction. However, the MPF method has the distinct advantage of being nearly
independent of the choice of jet algorithm in the reconstruction since jets are not used directly
in its calculation. The MPF is also less sensitive to contributions from pileup and the underlying
event [91]. Figure 5.17 shows the balances calculated from MPF, using a Z as a reference, and
the direct balance, with a  reference object. Again this balance is derived for data, Powheg
+ Pythia 8, and Sherpa events, where the Powheg + Pythia8 is the nominal choice of
Monte Carlo. The size of the correction is largest at lower jet transverse momenta.
The final stage in the in situ calibration is the multi-jet balance (MJB) where a high pT
jet is balanced against a system of many lower pT jets which are already fully-calibrated up
to and including the Z/ + jet balances. Using the transverse momentum of the leading

Following the derivation of the calibration factors for each of these in situ balances, the
final closure in the jet response between data and Monte Carlo is obtained through a statistical
combination and interpolation of second-order polynomial splines [91], shown in Figure 5.18.
Here the total uncertainty is given by the green band and is consistent with the data/MC
response closure from each of the separate balances. The central value of the combination closes
to within 2-3 % across a wide range of jet pT up to over 2 TeV.
5.3.2 Large-Radius Jets
We have now considered the full jet energy scale calibration chain for standard AntiKt4EMTopo
jets. The R = 1.0 jets formed from LCTopo inputs are calibrated in a similar manner, but
without the pileup and residual corrections or any GSC applied. In place of these, the pileup
contributions are removed by the application of a jet grooming procedure. Throughout Run 2
of ATLAS the standard R = 1.0 jet grooming procedure has been jet trimming [89].
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 90
Figure 5.19: A cartoon illustrating the trimming a circular jet. From [90].
5.3.2.1 R = 1.0 Trimmed Jets
In the jet trimming procedure, shown schematically in Figure 5.19 the initial large-radius
jets constituents are first of all clustered into subjets of size Rsub using the kt algorithm to
recluster the softest constituents first. After the kt-clustering, the algorithm proceeds by looping
through each of the subjets and calculating the ratio of the transverse momentum of the ith
subjet to the total transverse momentum of the jet, piT/p
T . If piT/p
T < fcut (where fcut is
a tunable parameter) the subjet is deemed to be sufficiently soft and is removed from the
jet. During Run 1 of ATLAS, extensive optimisation studies were carried out to determine
a sensible choice of Rsub and fcut [90]: Rsub = 0.2 and fcut = 0.05 were adopted and the
resulting large-radius jets have until recently been the standard R = 1.0 jet definition in ATLAS:
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets.
5.3.2.2 Reclustered Jets
There is a second approach to producing large-radius jets, referred to as jet reclustering [96], or
jets from jets, which will prove vital to the multi-jets search for new physics presented in the
third part of this thesis.
The basic idea of jet reclustering is to create a large-radius jet from smaller jets, and thus
in ATLAS the standard reclustered jet definition is an R = 1.0 jet made from AntiKt4EMTopo
jets acting as inputs to the sequential recombination algorithm used in the reclustering. The
major advantage of reclustered jets over the standard trimmed LCTopo jets is that they are built
from well-defined and calibrated AntiKt4EMTopo inputs. The reclustering process therefore
inherits the calibrations and systematic uncertainties associated with the AntiKt4EMTopo
jets, and consequently the reclustered jets do not require an additional set of calibrations

or systematics. Another advantage is that jet reclustering can be easily re-run on the same
inputs, and therefore turns the jet radius itself into a tunable parameter which the user can
modify to make a new jet collection depending on the particular analysis or final state of
interest. It is also possible to apply jet grooming to reclustered jets in the same way as the
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets. These features of the reclustering shall have
interesting implications for the multi-jets analysis.
5.3.2.3 R = 1.0 Jet Calibration
The AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets are first origin-corrected, and then -JES
corrected by geometrically matching reconstruction-level and truth-level jets within R < 0.75,
and determining the fitted jet energy response in Monte Carlo using dijet events (as outined in
Section 5.3.1.3). For completeness, AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets before and
after the -JES correction is applied are shown in Figure 5.20, as a function of the jet reco. The
level of closure is similar to what is observed for AntiKt4EMTopo jets, and is within 5 % for the
majority of phase-space. Different bins of the truth-level energy are considered, with the best
closure observed at energies above 300 GeV.
After -JES, no GSC is applied, but another set of in situ corrections (Like those de-
scribed in 5.3.1.5) are applied.

Monte Carlo JES and in situ calibration uncertainties. From [91].
5.3.3 JES Uncertainties
Briefly, we shall now consider the dominating systematic uncertainties affected the JES calibration
of jets. A feeling for the relative magnitude of the different components of the JES systematic
can be gleaned from Figure 5.21, which shows the JES uncertainties for AntiKt4EMTopo jets, as
a function of the jet pT and , measured in ATLAS 2015 data.
In general the largest systematic uncertainties come from the in situ measurements of the
JES. For the Monte Carlo-driven residual, -JES, and GSC corrections the largest uncertainties
are due to flavour-dependence of the response and jet composition, and the pileup. The in situ
uncertainties which dominate originate from:
1. Mismodelling in Monte Carlo (estimated by comparing different Monte Carlo generators and
partonic showering frameworks).
2. Topology dependence in the different balances (estimate by varying the cuts applied to select
the reference object).
3. Uncertainties inherited from existing calibrations, such as the Monte Carlo-only jet calibration.
The majority of these in situ uncertainties come from the Z + jets and multi-jet balance
stages of the calibration.
5. Jet Reconstruction and Calibration in Run 2 93
For the MC JES and GSC, an estimate of the flavour response uncertainty is obtained from
the difference between the jet energy responses of gluon jets (labelled as gluon jets using the
truth record parton identification) in Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 [97] generators:
response
flavour = fgluon  (R
Pythia 8
E,gluon R
Herwig 7
E,gluon ), (5.18)
where the fraction of gluons in the sample is controlled by fgluon = 0.5, assuming a 50:50
split between gluon and quark jets.
The flavour composition uncertainty (assuming a 100 % uncertainty on the gluon fraction
fgluon) is defined:
composition
flavour = 
fraction
gluon 
|RPythia 8E,lightquark RPythia 8E,gluon |
fgluon RPythia 8E,gluon + (1 fgluon)RPythia 8E,lightquark
, (5.19)
where light-quark refers to jets associated with highest energy truth-labelled parent u-,
d-, and c-quarks. This uncertainty could clearly be reduced by better constraining the gluon
fraction estmate in Monte Carlo.
The pileup uncertainties are obtained from the uncertainties on the fits ( and ) to the
residual response dependencies on  and NPV as a function of the jet ptrueT . There is also
an additional uncertainty coming from the topology-dependence of , calculated using the
difference in the magnitude of  between Z + jets,  + jets, and dijet Monte Carlo, different
Monte Carlo generators, and also with data.
The Jet Mass and its Resolution
Having presented the basic concept of hadronic jets, their reconstruction in simulated and
measured ATLAS data, and the calibration of their energy scale, we shall now focus in some
detail on one of the most rudimentary but powerful properties of a jet: the jet mass. Such
a quantity encodes information about the masses of the hadrons which form the jet, and is
therefore the central variable in numerous particle physics analyses which rely on information
from reconstructed jets. Indeed we shall see in Part III of this thesis how the total jet mass of
reclustered jets is utilised in the multi-jets search as a proxy for the presence of heavy particles
which could be contained in those jets, making the jet mass one of the most important quantities
in that analysis. More specifically, we can think of the jet mass as the most simple variable that
describes the substructure [68] of a jet.
In this chapter we shall formally quantify the jet mass and describe how it can be calculated
from the constituents of the reconstructed jet. During Run 2 of ATLAS the jet mass definition
underwent substantial redevelopment [98100], and the need for such progress shall also be
motivated and described in detail, before the process of jet mass calibration is briefly outlined.
Following a discussion of the jet mass magnitude and scale, we shall then investigate the
degradation of the jet mass arising from the interaction of hadronic jets with the ATLAS
detector. To quantify this degradation, the jet mass resolution [101] is introduced and two
approaches of calculating this resolution, and its associated systematic uncertainty in physics
analyses, are presented and compared [99, 101]. Having invested much time in the most primitive
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 95
of jet substructure variables, more complex substructure variables will be outlined in Chapter 7,
and will prove invaluable to the studies therein described.
6.1 The Jet Mass Scale
6.1.1 Overview
Like the jet energy scale, the jet mass scale is a dimensionless quantity and it evaluates
the relative size of the jet mass calculated at reconstruction-level to the jet mass at Monte
Carlo truth-level, or the relative size of the jet mass as measured in data to the Monte Carlo
reconstruction-level mass. Both a Monte Carlo and in situ jet mass calibration [98, 99] is derived
in order to correct for differences between each of these different jet masses, using techniques in
the spirit of jet energy scale calibration which has already been detailed. Before very briefly
outlining this jet mass scale calibration, the jet mass definitions of interest must be formally
described.
6.1.2 The Calorimeter Mass
Throughout Run 1 of ATLAS, and during early Run 2, the standard jet mass definition was the
calorimeter mass [98, 102], mcalo. This jet mass is calculated solely from information provided
by the calorimeter cells. Recall that the two standard ATLAS jet definitions, AntiKt4EMTopo
and AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets, are reconstructed from electromagnetic
and hadronic scale calorimeter topoclusters respectively. For brevity, well refer to such
jets as calorimeter jets. For a calorimeter jet, J , reconstructed from calorimeter-cell (i.e.
topocluster) constituents, labelled i, which each have an energy Ei and three-momentum pi,
the calorimeter mass is simply the invariant mass obtained from the total four-momentum
of all i constituents of the jet:
mcalo =
(
. (6.1)
A difficulty with the calorimeter jet mass is that it is more susceptible to soft, low-energy,
wide-angle contributions such as pileup. This is because this mass has an explicit dependence
on the angular separation between its constituents. To see this, consider a calorimeter mass
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 96
calculated from summing over N constituents making up the jet. The mass can be written:
(mcalo)2 =
m2i +
2EiEj(1 cos ij)
EiEj(ij)2
pT,ipT,j(Rij)2,
(6.2)
where in the final two lines the approximations of mcalo  mi and small ij are applied,
where ij is the angle between the i and j constituents. In the final line the result is re-expressed
in typical detector coordinates, where the R =
(i  j)2 + (i  j)2 in ATLAS   
coordinates. Thus the calorimeter jet mass explicitly depends on the angular separation of its
own constituents.
6.1.3 The Track-Assisted Mass
Another limitation of the calorimeter mass is its dependence on the finite granularity (thought
of as a resolving power) of the ATLAS calorimeters. Recalling that the opening angle between
the decay products of a heavy hadron captured within a sufficiently large-radius jet of some
pT scales like mhadron/pT, it is clear that as the transverse momentum of the jet increases
the angular separation between the decay products contained in the jet decreases, causing
the jet to become more collimated (i.e. it has a larger Lorentz boost). For a sufficiently
large Lorentz boost, the angular separation between the captured decay products will be
comparable in size to the calorimeter cells used in the jet reconstruction. Consequently the
ability to resolve the energy and momentum of these decay products, and hence reconstructed
mass of the jet, will degrade substantially beyond some high pT. One simple approach to
reduce the impact of such degradation is to use more information from the ATLAS detector,
such as the four-vector information measured from the tracks reconstructed in its Inner Detector.
Tracking and calorimetry are combined in the track-assisted mass [98], mTA, defined as:
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 97
Figure 6.1: A summary of the complete jet mass scale calibration chain for AntiKt4EMTopo and
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets in ATLAS. Currently only the larger-radius jets are
calibrated at the in situ level. Both the calorimeter and track-assisted jet mass definitions need to be
separately calibrated.
mTA =
pcaloT
ptrackT
mtrack. (6.3)
Here pcaloT is the transverse momentum of the calorimeter jet, while ptrackT is the transverse
momentum of the four-vector sum of tracks which are associated to the same calorimeter jet.
The invariant mass of this track four-vector sum is mtrack, and this is set to the pion mass (due
to the large multiplicity of pions contributing to the reconstructed tracks). The pcaloT /ptrackT ratio
provides a measure of the charged-to-neutral component of the jet, and therefore helps to correct
for charged-to-neutral fluctuations in the jet mass, improving the resolving power of the jet
mass compared to a track-only definition of mtrack. As a slightly technical aside, the tracks are
associated to the calorimeter jet using the method of ghost-association [92]. Ghost-association is
a technique which matches tracks to calorimeter jets by treating the tracks as infinitesimally soft,
low-pT particles (the track pT is set to some very low sub-MeV value). Such tracks are then added
as inputs to the anti-kt algorithm along with the calorimeter clusters. Following reconstruction
it is then possible to identify which tracks were clustered into which jets and thus isolate the list
of tracks associated to each particular jet of interest. This can be used to construct track jets,
or to match the tracking information to the clustering information in the jet reconstruction.
6.1.4 Jet Mass Calibration
The jet mass is highly sensitive to contributions from additional interactions arising from pileup
and the underlying event, as well as soft wide-angle radiation captured in the cone of the jet.
Approaches to pileup mitigation, such as the jet area method already discussed, or jet grooming,
help to reduce these sensitivities. However, it is necessary to derive a full set of calibrations
for the jet mass scale using a similar approach to the jet energy scale calibration chain. The
corresponding jet mass calibration chain is shown in Figure 6.1. The jet mass calibration takes
jets which have been calibrated at the jet energy scale, both in Monte Carlo and in situ, as inputs.

separation in  between two truth and two reconstruction-level jets, as well as the maximum
separation in    between a reconstruction-level and truth-level jet considered for those two
jets to be geometrically matched. From geometrically matched reco and truth jets, the jet
mass response is defined in a similar fashion to a jet energy response:
mreco
mtrue
, (6.4)
where mreco is the reconstruction-level jet mass, which will be either mcalo or mTA obtained
from Monte Carlo detector-level events depending on the mass definition considered in the
calibration. The jet mass response is calculated in bins of ptrueT , |det|, and mtrue. The
number and choice of variables was determined in order to provide distributions of the
response which were sufficiently Gaussian, so that the average response could be extracted
using the mean of a Gaussian fit. Several examples of such responses and fits, in different
bins, for both mass definitions, are shown in Figures 6.2 and 6.3 for AntiKt4EMTopo and
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets respectively. The JMS calibration is derived
from the same Pythia 8 QCD dijet samples used in the JES calibration. The small- and
large-radius reconstruction-level jets are calibrated relative to the truth-level AntiKt4Truth
and AntiKt10TruthTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jet collections respectively.
The calibration is derived bin-by-bin using the same numerical inversion technique procedure
in the JES calibration. The calibration function, Fm,, is again obtained for different jet
|det| and is constructed from a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel [103] of the mean fitted
response, Rm. This has the functional form:

Example calorimeter and track-assisted jet masses, before and after Monte Carlo jet mass
calibration, are shown in Figure 6.4, for a sample enriched in W/Z jets. The application of
the QCD dijet-derived calibration function moves the position of the jet mass closer to the W
and Z pole masses, as would be expected. In addition, the average jet mass response is shifted
towards unity following the application of these calibration functions. The calibration closure
is shown in Figure 6.5 for the calorimeter and track-assisted jet masses.
6.1.4.2 In situ Calibration
Following the Monte Carlo calibration, the JMS is corrected for in data through an in situ
calibration [104]. This in situ procedure uses the same Z+jets balance,  + jet balance, and
multi-jet balance techniques already described in Section 5.3.1.5 to calibrate the jet mass
response in data vs. Monte Carlo. These techniques have already been described in detail.
For completeness, the double ratio of the jet mass response following the combination of all
in situ calibrations is shown in Figure 6.6, where the calibration has been derived using the
2015+2016 ATLAS data-set. The in situ component of the calibration chain is applied to

6.1.5 The Combined Mass
The primary concern when interested in a precision measurement of the jet mass is how well
this quantity can be resolved in the ATLAS detector, based on the detector limitations of
reconstructing the initial jet. This is quantified by the jet mass resolution (JMR) [101]. Lower
values of the JMR correspond to better resolving power in the measurement of the jet mass.
As stated earlier, at higher transverse momenta the finite granularity of the calorimeter causes
the calorimeter jet mass resolution to degrade; in this case JMR improvements are obtained by
using the track-assisted mass. However, at lower transverse momenta the track-assisted mass
resolution degrades due to the appreciable charged-to-neutral fluctuations in the pcaloT /ptrackT -term.
At these lower transverse momenta it is therefore the calorimeter mass resolution which is
smaller. Ideally what a user needs is a jet mass definition with the smallest possible resolution
at any given jet pT in their particular measurement or search. The logical step in achieving this

is to find a meaningful way of combining mTA and mcalo such that JMR improvements from
mcalo are emphasised at lower pT, while the improvements from using mTA are still expressed at
higher pT. The combination of these two mass definitions, such that the resolution on the mass
is minimised across the jet pT, is referred to as the combined jet mass, mcomb.
The combined jet mass is a linear sum of the calorimeter and track-assisted masses, weighted
such that, across the range of the jet pT, it has a lower resolution than the separate calorimeter

mass and track-assisted mass. mcomb is a simple linear combination, and is defined as:
mcomb = wcalo  mcalo + wTA  mTA, (6.8)
where the two weights are constrained to sum to unity: wcalo + wTA = 1. The optimal
weights are calculated by minimising the combined jet mass resolution, starting from its formula.
The jet mass resolution is calculated from the same jet mass response employed in the JMS
calibration. The combined mass response can be written in terms of (approximately) Gaussian
jet mass responses by dividing throught the combined mass by the truth jet mass, giving :
Rcombm = w
calo  Rcalom + w
TA  RTAm . (6.9)
Assuming the correlations between the calorimeter and track-assisted masses are negligible,
the mathematical variance of the above mass response can be written
var(Rcombm ) = (w
calo)2  var(Rcalom ) + (w
TA)2  var(RTAm ). (6.10)
Each jet mass response distribution will have some width , coming from the square root
of the variance (var(x) = 2x). Using this, and re-writing wTA in terms of wcalo, we obtain
an expression for the width of the combined jet mass response:
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 105
(comb)2 = (wcalo)2  (calo)2 + (1 wcalo)2  (TA)2. (6.11)
Recall that the final goal is to determine a mass definition that minimises the jet mass resolu-
tion. The jet mass resolution is obtained from the width of the jet mass responses, corresponding
to these . Consequently the problem now reduces to finding the wcalo that minimises comb.
Performing this minimisation with respect to wcalo, we arrive at the combined mass weights:
wcalo =
(calo)2
(calo)2 + (TA)2
, wTA =
(TA)2
(calo)2 + (TA)2
. (6.12)
In the presence of non-negligible correlations between the calorimeter and track-assisted
mass responses, the combined mass variance expression acquires an additional covariance term:
var(Rcombm ) = (w
calo)2  var(Rcalom ) + (w
TA)2  var(RTAm ) + 2w
calowTA  cov(Rcalom ,R
(6.13)
The new combined mass weights follow from an identical minimisation of the above equation,
yielding, for the calorimeter mass-term:
wcalo =
(TA)2  caloTA
(calo)2 + (TA)2  2caloTA
, (6.14)
where  is the correlation coefficient of Rcalom vs. RTAm and is related to the covari-
ance through the expression
cov(Rcalom ,RTAm )
caloTA
. (6.15)
The calculation of the combined jet mass therefore depends directly on the resolutions of the
calorimeter and track-assisted masses. The combined jet mass is designed to be used with the
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets and the weights are obtained from calorimeter
and track-assisted mass resolutions studied in Monte Carlo QCD dijets events, in pp collisions at
13 TeV. The basic selections for the jets, including truth-matching and isolation, are summarised
in Table 6.1 i.e. they follow identical selection criteria for the large-radius jets used in the original
Monte Carlo jet mass calibration. The jets used to obtain the weights are calibrated at both
the jet energy and jet mass scales. The jet mass resolution is calculated from the interquantile
range of the jet mass response of Monte Carlo reconstruction-level jets to truth-level jets:
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 106
IQnR(Rm)
2M(Rm)
, (6.16)
whereM(R) denotes the median of the jet mass response distribution and IQnR(R) is the
68.0 % coverage interval of the interquantile range1 of the jet mass response, and is a measure of
the absolute size of the resolution. The quantity that has been referred to as the JMR is in fact
the fractional JMR, where the absolute value is quantified by IQnR(R)/2, and the median
acts as a central value of the jet mass response. In this chapter, when the JMR is calculated
and compared it is always a fractional JMR, but the fractional word in the text description
will be dropped for simplicity.
The jet mass resolutions for the calorimeter and track-assisted masses which are used to
derive a combined mass are shown in Figure 6.7. The JMR is parametrised in terms of the
reconstruction-level mass and the ratio of that mass to the calorimeter jet transverse momentum.
Figure 6.7a shows the general behaviour for the calorimeter mass resolution: at lower mcalo/pcaloT
the jets have a larger Lorentz boost and are therefore more collimated. Due to finite granularity
of the calorimeter, the JMR consequently degrades.
The final performance of the combined mass will be assessed in Section 6.2. Figure 6.8
summarises the first application of the combined jet mass, comparing the performance of the
combined jet mass resolution with respect to the mass resolutions obtained from the calorimeter
and track-assisted masses respectively. The combined jet mass resolution is significantly
smaller than the calorimeter mass resolution at higher truth jet transverse momenta, due
to the additional tracking information provided by the track-assisted mass component. The
reduced resolution in this boosted regime has been utilised by numerous searches for exotic
particle production on ATLAS.
6.1.6 Particle Flow
We need to now briefly summarise the concept of Particle Flow and its use in jet reconstruction,
as particle flow jets will be directly compared with topocluster-based jets both later in this
chapter, and in subsequent chapters. Particle flow jets offer improvements to the jet performance
1Such range is defined as q84%  q16%, where q84% and q16% are the 16th and 84th percentiles of a given
distribution.

(e.g. a better jet energy resolution) by adding tracking information explicitly into the inputs of
the jet algorithm.
Particle flow objects (PFOs) [105] are constructed by matching tracks, which have passed
stringent selection criteria, to electromagnetic scale topoclusters in the calorimeter. The tracks
used in the matching must be reconstructed from at least nine hits in the silicon detectors, where
no missing hits in the pixel tracker are observed. To avoid double-counting energy, the charged
component from the track is compared with its expected deposition in the calorimeter, which
is then removed from the corresponding matched topocluster. Following this subtraction, the
algorithm further handles the case of energy being split between multiple adjacent topoclusters.
The final PFOs contain tracking information from charged tracks, as well as calorimeter
information from the corrected topoclusters. One may think of particle flow as a generalisation
of the track-assisted jet mass, where the matching of the track has been extended to each
calorimeter cell, rather than just a matched reconstructed calorimeter jet. The anti-kt algorithm
is then applied to produce small-radius jets from these PFO inputs, where tracks satisfying
|z0| sin  < 3.0 mm are considered. The resulting particle flow jet energy and mass are then
fully calibrated in precisely the same manner as the topocluster-based jet definitions which
have already been described in some detail. We will refer to the resulting R = 0.4 jets as

AntiKt4EMPFlow jets. A schematic illustration of the process of track-matching and cluster
splitting in ATLAS PFO reconstruction is provided by Figure 6.9.
6.2 The Jet Mass Resolution
From an analysis perspective, the jet mass is crucial to differentiating a number of different final
state topologies. Resonant peaks are absent in the invariant mass distribution derived from jets
originating from gluon, b-, c-, or light-quark jets. We will refer to such jets collectively as QCD
jets. Such jets have a mass distribution which features only a low mass logarithmic enhancement2
followed by a decline arising from phase-space limitations. Understanding the form of different
jet mass distributions allows for the selection and reconstruction of event samples of final states
containing W/Z, top, and H  bb jets. Consequently, one may measure their differential
kinematic properties and/or search for resonant and non-resonant deviations from the Standard
Model (SM) predictions. Estimating the mass resolution for such analyses, and developing a
reliable and testable methodology for the propagation of its systematic uncertainties, forms the
basis of this Section.
The jet mass plays an important role in identifying (and tagging [106]) the hadronic decays
of top quarks and heavy bosons (W , Z, Higgs) and in differentiating between them. Having
discussed the jet mass and its calibration in some detail, together with formally defining how
the jet mass resolution is obtained, we now focus on studying the impact of determining the jet
mass resolution in various Monte Carlo final states, for both small- and large-radius jets. All jet
JMRs will be presented for several topologies: W/Z, top, H  bb, and QCD jets.
In these studies, two different JMRs will be discussed and evaluated. A Monte Carlo-
based JMR is evaluated from the spread of the difference between reconstruction-level and
(geometrically matched - see Table 6.1) truth jet masses in simulated events. Such a Monte
Carlo-based JMR has already been defined in Section 6.1.5. In turn, a second JMR is obtained
by using the JMR relative scale between data and simulation derived using the in situ technique

of forward-folding [98, 102] (discussed in Section 6.2.4). This second JMR has the advantage of
being corrected using Run 2 data; it does not just rely on Monte Carlo information alone. Finally
the propagation of JMR systematic uncertainties is illustrated first for the MC-based JMR [107],
and then for this second data-corrected JMR (which is often referred to as a forward-folded
JMR in the literature [99, 104]). This is presented in Section 6.2.5.
6.2.1 Monte Carlo Samples
Samples of simulated events for proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13
TeV are used to study the ATLAS detector response and JMR of various reconstructed jet
definitions. The samples used for these studies are summarised in Table 6.2.
The exotic production of W  and Z  bosons [108, 109] provides a copious source of simulated
boosted W and Z bosons, and of top quarks, respectively. The graviton [110] production
provides a source of di-Higgs states, which decay to bb. The W  and Z  signals are motivated by
several BSM theories, such as Little Higgs Models [108], whilst the graviton is motivated by
Randall-Sundrum models which generate gravitons and describe reality as a higher-dimensional
universe with warped geometry between different branes [110]. These three signal samples
are produced with W  and Z  boson masses ranging from 400 to 5000 GeV and graviton masses
ranging from 400 to 3000 GeV, providing a spectrum of final state jets with a wide range of
Lorentz boosts. The simulated events are re-weighted so that the distribution of the mean
number of interactions per bunch crossing in simulation matched what has been observed in the
data collected by the ATLAS detector in the years 2015 and 2016. These same signal-samples
will be used in the studies in Chapter 7.
The samples are processed using the full ATLAS detector simulation [111], based on GEANT
4 [112].

common background in ATLAS. These samples give rise to large-radius W/Z jets, top jets,
H  bb jets, and QCD jets, respectively. In addition to the basic requirements outlined in
Table 6.1, such jets are matched, using ghost-association [92], to a truth-level W/Z, top or H
particle respectively, with the exception of QCD jets, where no matching requirement to a truth
particle is imposed.
6.2.2.1 Monte Carlo JMR Estimate for Large-Radius Jets
Lets first describe JMR as a function of large-radius jet ptrueT in some detail. The behaviour is
shown in mtrue/ptrueT bins for QCD jets, and mtrue bins for W/Z, top and H  bb jets (signal
jets), for the calorimeter mass mcalo resolutions in Figure 6.10. For the jets arising from the
signal samples, the JMR is binned in mtrue. This is motivated by the presence of an intrinsic
mass scale expectation for such jets, namely at the W , Z, and Higgs mass poles. However there
is no intrinsic mass scale for QCD jets, and so the JMR is shown as a function of mtrue/ptrueT in
that case, allowing one to proxy the particle-level angular spread of the decay products produced
by the parent particle generating the jet.
Binning in mtrue/ptrueT provides a complete overview of the general JMR behaviour in the
QCD jets distribution, where the JMR is largest at low mtrue/ptrueT values. Fixing this ratio
selects jets in which the energy distribution has approximately constant angular spread. For
this fixed ratio, the energy content of the jet increases as ptrueT increases. The calorimeter energy
resolution is reduced with increasing jet energy and, as the angular resolution contribution is
roughly constant, the overall JMR resolution is expected to be reduced as a function of ptrueT at
fixed mtrue/ptrueT . On the other hand, if instead ptrueT is fixed, then as mtrue/ptrueT decreases in size,
the angular separation between the decay products becomes comparable to the finite granularity
of the calorimeter, causing the jet mass resolution to degrade. The largest JMR values are
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 113
observed in the curve corresponding to the smallest mtrue/ptrueT : here the subjet angular spread
becomes comparable in size to a cell in the hadronic calorimeter and the limitations due to the
spatial granularity of the detector are more significant.
For W/Z, top and H  bb jets, each JMR curve corresponds to an ensemble of jets with an
approximately fixed mass (distributed about the upper and lower bounds of each mtrue bin).
Fixing the mass gives rise to a decreasing angular spread of the decay products as ptrueT increases.
It is therefore expected that the reduction in energy resolution of the calorimeter at higher ptrueT
is offset by the increase in angular resolution of the jets. In addition, at a fixed ptrueT , jets with
smaller masses are expected to have smaller angular spread and similar energy content to the
larger mass jets, thus generally resulting in a larger JMR for a large fraction of the explored
ptrueT range.
Having described the calorimeter mass resolution in some detail we now move towards
quantifying the combined mass performance. In order to make a quantitative comparison of
the MC-based JMR for mcalo and mcomb, the two different resolutions have been overlaid, as
a function of transverse momentum of the truth jet matched to the detector-level jet. The
JMR for each of the two jet mass definitions is compared in Figure 6.11, where now large mass
windows have been placed on all four sample topologies. In addition to the truth jet matching,
the truth jet mass is required to be in an interval containing the mass peak corresponding to
the reconstructed W/Z, H  bb, or top jets. For the QCD jets, an mtrue interval ranging up to
200 GeV is imposed. For top, W/Z, and H  bb jets there is an absolute 27 % improvement
in the resolution for mcomb, particularly at higher momenta where the jet is more boosted and
the mcomb definition contains substantial component from the tracking information. The mcomb
weights are derived using a sample of QCD jets and so, in topologies different from QCD jets,
the expected improvement in performance for mcomb can be reduced in the very low ptrueT regions
where the mcalo contribution to mcomb is dominant. This is most evident in the very first ptrueT
bin, for example in the case of W/Z jets. Other important sources of under-performance in
mcomb include the breakdown in the assumption of a Gaussian detector response and neglecting
the correlations between the calorimeter and track-assisted masses3.
3The effect of including these correlations has been previously studied, and has been found to be small in
comparison to e.g. non-Gaussian detector effects.

In Figure 6.12 the MC-based JMRs of three types of small-radius jets are compared: those
reconstructed from electromagnetic scale topoclusters, from electromagnetic scale particle flow
objects, and from hadronic scale/LCW topoclusters. As with the comparison of the calorimeter
and combined mass JMRs, here a large mass window is taken in each sample. The additional
tracking information utilised in particle flow provides a superior resolution across the majority
of the jet ptrueT range, most clearly for the QCD jets where there is up to an absolute 6 %
improvement at higher ptrueT . The use of particle flow has previously been shown to improve the

jet energy resolution at low ptrueT , because in that regime the tracking resolution is superior to the
calorimeter jet energy resolution. This feature serves as one of the most important motivations
for using particle flow jets, and the improvement in the JMR seen here provides further support
for their wider usage. JMR performance of LCW-topocluster-based jets is generally similar to
EM-topocluster-based jets, as both approaches rely on calorimeter-level information only.

6.2.2.3 Systematic Uncertainties on the Monte Carlo-based Jet Mass Resolution
The MC-based JMR systematic uncertainties result from a multitude of sources encompassing
effects from the detector geometry, higher-order corrections in the simulation of the final state
of interest, the calculation of the non-perturbative QCD parton shower, hadronisation, and
the underlying event, and the modelling of the interaction of the simulated particles with
matter. During Run 1 these were estimated by varying the assumptions on each effect separately,
re-calculating the JMR for the varied scenarios and quantifying the spread in the new resolutions
from the nominal resolution where none of these assumptions are modified. Based on these
studies [107] the resulting relative systematic uncertainty on the JMR was estimated to be
20 %. This value is also supported by comparisons of Run 1 data with simulations [117]. To
understand this uncertainty, we need to build up a picture of resolution smearing. Resolution
smearing is a way of modifying a simulated kinematic quantity in order to obtain new values
which are closer to what is truly measured in data, and there will be some uncertainty associated
with this process. This 20 % can be thought of as an uncertainty in over-smearing the jet mass,
and it is applied directly to the MC-based JMR using the method of Gaussian smearing (see
below), in order to account for additional detector effects and mismodellings in the original MC
simulation. The MC statistical uncertainties for large-radius jets are comparable in size for both
mass definitions, and are at the percent level in the bulk of the JMR phase-space. At higher
transverse momentum and boost, they are slightly larger due to the combination of the falling
nature of the involved distributions with the size of the simulated samples. The MC statistical
uncertainty is therefore a subdominant contribution compared to the much larger detector and
modelling effects, and thus it is not considered further.
To mimic the variation induced by the JMR uncertainty, the JMR is increased by multiplying
the jet mass by a random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution. A way to increase
the standard deviation of a Gaussian variable by a factor  is to apply a transformation
on the variable that results in a scaled enhancement. This can be applied to the Monte
Carlo JMR in the following way:
(MC)2 = 2MC + (xMC)
2. (6.17)
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 118
For example, for the 20 % increase obtained from Run 1 studies,  is set to 1.2 and
Equation 6.17 is solved to give x  0.66. The Gaussian random variable used for smearing, G,
is then constructed as a Gaussian distribution of unitary mean and a standard deviation of
xMC. The smearing transformation is then applied to the jet mass in the following way:
mreco,smeared = mreco  G(1, xMC). (6.18)
Following smearing, a new JMR is calculated for mreco,smeared. If the response distribution of
the smeared mass is Gaussian, this formalism guarantees that the following condition is satisfied:
reco,smeared
MC  MC(m
reco,smeared/mtrue) = MC(mreco/mtrue) (6.19)
where the JMR MC for a given response R is defined in Equation 6.16.
6.2.3 Investigating non-Gaussian features of the Jet Mass Resolu-
The ideal case of a perfectly Gaussian detector mass response is not realised in reality. In
general the jet mass response is affected by non-Gaussian features arising from e.g. the non-
compensating nature of the calorimetry, and therefore deviations from  = 1.2 are expected
when comparing the smeared and original resolutions. This leads to a definition of non-
Gaussianity that is obtained purely from MC:
MC(mreco,smeared/mtrue)
MC(mreco/mtrue)
, (6.20)
if a smearing of s % is applied. For a Gaussian detector response, this non-Gaussianity
will have a value of 0. An immediate consequence of this result is that any non-Gaussianities
could be inferred by looking at the jet mass response. Example jet mass responses illustrating
some non-Gaussian behaviour in QCD jets, and an example of a more Gaussian response in
W/Z jets, are shown in Figure 6.13. Such response features give rise to the non-Gaussianity
for a 20 % smearing shown in Figures 6.14 and 6.15. These non-Gaussianities are quantified
for mcalo and mcomb of large-radius jets, respectively, and are obtained relative to the truth-
level transverse momentum, selecting a suitable window in truth mass for a given sample topology.

Figure 6.13: The jet mass response for large-radius jets. The calorimeter jet mass definition is
used. A Gaussian fit has been overlaid for illustrative purposes. The pcaloT bins have been chosen for
demonstrative purposes as examples of distributions which are or are not reasonably Gaussian.
Clearly the ideal smearing of  = 1.2 is not recovered in any of the samples or jet mass
definitions, i.e. a non-zero value of non-Gaussianity is obtained in all cases. The combined mass
closure appears to be similar to the closure from the calorimeter mass resolution, with some
improvements from the combined mass (depending on the bin of interest), such as for the H 
bb jets.
Figure 6.16 shows the impact of the non-Gaussianity for the four different sample topologies
considered for the small-radius jets based on EM topoclusters (AntiKt4EMTopo jets). Similar
levels of non-closure are observed. Differences in non-Gaussianity between small and large-radius
jets are expected due to the different jet reconstruction, use of grooming for large-radius jets,
and jet-area pileup correction used for small-radius jets. At low ptrueT , the bb, top, and W/Z jets
generally have larger statistical uncertainties for small-radius jets.
The results of this section indicate one of the important limitations of using Gaussian
smearing to estimate the JMR systematic uncertainty: that the underlying responses are not
Gaussian. Section 6.2.5 will explore this further, using a JMR based on information from data
vs. MC. This is a second, data-driven, JMR approach. However, first the idea of forward-folding
needs to be presented.

6.2.4 Jet Mass Resolution from Forward-Folding
We shall now describe the approach of forward-folding, which is an alternative method to
Gaussian smearing, and is also used to modify the simulated jet mass so that it better agrees
with data. Forward-folding has an immediate advantage over Gaussian smearing in that it uses
Run 2 in situ information in the transformation it applies to the jet mass. As we saw previously,

which rely the jet mass and its systematic uncertainty.

to the simulation. The associated systematic uncertainties on such a measurement are also
extracted. This information is captured by a set of in situ-derived parameters defined below. In
the present studies such parameters are then used to correct the Monte Carlo JMR to match data.
In the forward-folding transformation, the detector-level jet mass is modified in the following
way (assuming the relative jet mass scale is unity [99]):
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 123
mrecoFF = m
reco|(mtrue, pcaloT ) + 
mreco|(mtrue, pcaloT ) m
reco|(mtrue, pcaloT )
, (6.21)
where mreco|(mtrue, pcaloT ) is the average detector-level jet mass, given a truth mass mtrue
and a detector-level pcaloT . The  parameter is derived from in situ studies [99] involving samples
enhanced in top jets and W jets with pcaloT < 1.0 TeV.
For the studies outlined in this chapter, the forward-folding transformation is applied to
large-radius jets in simulated samples of W and top jets, where the  depends on the mass
and transverse momentum of the jet. To perform the transformation and extract a JMR,
information about the jet mass response is required. This is obtained by dividing both terms
of Equation 6.21 by the truth mass, which is fixed, thus obtaining:
Rm,FF = Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT ) + 
Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT ) Rm|(m
true, pcaloT )
, (6.22)
where Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT ) is the average jet mass response, given mtrue and pcaloT . In the
forward-folding transformation, the value of  depends on the mass and on the momentum of
the jet. It is more usual to quote the variable , defined as   1 + . The measured values for
, and the associated uncertainties , are summarised in Table 6.3. These have been obtained
from the detailed studies in [99], where the relative JMR and JMS were extracted using 2016
ATLAS data, amounting to 33 fb1 of integrated luminosity.
Consequently, given mrecoFF and Rm,FF, the forward-folding JMR definition is obtained from
Equation 6.16 as:
FF =
IQnR(Rm,FF)
2M(Rm,FF)
, (6.23)
where Rm,FF is parametrised as a function of mtrue and pcaloT .
When IQnR(Rm,FF)/2 coincides with the standard deviation of Rm,FF, which we will denote
by (Rm,FF), using the definition of Rm,FF in Equation 6.22 allows one to write IQnR(Rm,FF)/2
=  (Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT )). In addition, given that taking the average of Equation 6.22 results
in Rm,FF = Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT ), whenM(Rm,FF) coincides with Rm,FF and IQnR(Rm,FF)/2
coincides with (Rm,FF), Equation 6.23 becomes:

As a consequence, Equation 6.24 provides the following approximation for the JMR
derived from forward-folding:
FF = (Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT )). (6.25)
This approximation is adopted in order to estimate FF in these studies. In this light it
is relevant to emphasise the physical interpretation of the -value: it is the relative JMR,
representing the ratio of the forward-folding (data-driven) JMR to the MC-based JMR, and
therefore the natural parameter for forward-folding. As previously highlighted, the studies in
[99] established the relative JMR from 2016 data, summarised in the lower ratio of Figure 6.17.
The  adopted in these studies are taken directly from this Figure.
The uncertainty on  is used to derive the corresponding up (+) and down () systematic
JMR variations FF according to:
FF = ( )(Rm|(mtrue, pcaloT )). (6.26)

6.2.5 JMR comparisons: Gaussian Smearing versus Forward-Folding
With forward-folding and its JMR defined, two comparisons between this new JMR and the
purely MC-based, Gaussian smeared JMR can now be made: first the relative magnitudes of
each JMR, and second the relative uncertainties ascribed to them. To ensure a fair comparison,
we must apply a Gaussian smearing to the MC-based JMR which should be equivalent to a
forward-folding scaled by , and in general we shall see that this smearing does not correspond
to the proposed 20 % based on Run 1 studies. The comparison of the JMR magnitude for
equivalent-sized Gaussian smearing and forward-folding corrections provides a further assessment
of the size of non-Gaussian effects on the jet mass reconstruction.
6.2.5.1 Comparing JMR values
In the ideal case of a Gaussian detector response, the ratio of forward-folding to an MC-based
JMR suitably modified with a Gaussian smearing is expected to yield unity.4

Table 6.3: The different -values considered in the forward-folding procedure, extracted from
Figure 6.17. The top two rows are the  values derived from W jets, and the bottom two rows
are derived from top jets. The corresponding ptrueT -values are given. The equivalent x-values for a
Gaussian smearing, assuming a Gaussian detector response, are also given. In the final row, the  
 of 0.62 would produce a non-real x  x, and so this lower bound is set to 0 (no smearing).
Given a  value used in forward-folding, lets first define MC,corr to be the MC-based JMR,
which has been corrected to the value of the JMR determined in situ from data using forward-
folding. This is achieved by applying a Gaussian smearing by x to the jet mass such that,
assuming a Gaussian detector response, its JMR is the same as the forward-folding JMR derived
using . We will denote the x value used in this Gaussian smearing to mimic the effect of a 
forward-folding x, to make it explicit that it has been calculated to be equivalent to a given
4This property has been confirmed by performing a simulated experiment, in which a Gaussian-distributed
random variable is both smeared and forward-folded on an event-by-event basis, and the ratio of the two resulting
distributions is consistent with unity.
6. The Jet Mass and its Resolution 126
 value assuming a Gaussian distribution. The values of FF and the corresponding MC,corr
are referred to as the nominal data-corrected JMR. Now, recall that in the forward-folding
procedure the  are a function of jet mtrue and jet ptrueT (see Table 6.3). Therefore, in order
to determine the appropriate equivalent x-values, a variable smearing approach is adopted,
where the Gaussian smearing also depends on the mtrue and ptrueT of the jet. This allows for a
consistent comparison to be made with the forward-folding. The ratio FF/MC,corr then directly
tests the initial assumption of a Gaussian detector response necessary to match x to , and
therefore deviations from unity provide another handle on the magnitude of the non-Gaussianity
in reconstructing the jet mass.
The x are calculated by substituting the forward-folding coefficient  in Equation 6.25 with
the  coefficient in Equation 6.19, and by then using Equation 6.17 to derive the corresponding
x-value. The corresponding uncertainties on x are obtained using the same approach, but
now the -value is replaced by its uncertainty, . The results of this procedure are reported in
Table 6.3. These new x-values are then used to construct a Gaussian smearing function where
the x-value changes as  changes. The ptrueT ranges considered are different for the two different
sample topologies for which the  parameter is available (as shown in Figure 6.17): first a W
jets topology where 200 GeV < ptrueT < 350 GeV, and then a top jets topology where 350 GeV
 ptrueT < 1000 GeV.
The new jet mass- and jet ptrueT -dependent Gaussian smearing scenario is compared with the
forward-folding scenario in Figure 6.18. The magnitude of the ratio is within about 5 % of unity,
thus quantifying the effects from the non-Gaussianity to be at the 5 % level.
6.2.5.2 Comparing JMR Uncertainties
Given the systematic uncertainty on forward-folding JMR defined in Section 6.2.4, lets now
denote the up (+) and down () variations of the nominal MC,corr, by MC,corr+ and MC,corr.
These JMRs depend on x + x and x  x, respectively. Recalling the discussion of the
previous section, it should now be clear that these variables correspond to an MC-based JMR
with Gaussian smearing of x  x applied, such that it has an equal magnitude to a JMR

associated with forward-folding are consistent with what is observed in the case of the Gaussian
smearing. However, for top jets with 350 GeV < ptrueT < 500 GeV the forward-folding systematic
uncertainties are consistent with being as much as 20 % smaller than the size of the uncertainties

associated with Gaussian smearing for for +. Furthermore, the forward-folding uncertainties
are then observed to be up to 40 % larger than the Gaussian smearing uncertainties in , for
ptrueT > 500 GeV. The explanation behind this sudden jump in the size of the forward-folding
uncertainty may have multiple contributions, including differences in the origin of the jet (W vs.
top), as well as the large increase in  for ptrueT > 500 GeV, as shown in Table 6.3. There is also
an impact from the variable smearing approach itself: the x  x variation for ptrueT > 500
GeV requires a Gaussian under-smearing which would not be a real number (i.e. (x  x)2
< 0), and therefore no smearing is applied as an approximation. It is therefore reasonable to
partially attribute this 40 % difference between the two methods to the inability of the Gaussian
smearing approach to correctly modify the JMR. This demonstrates a fundamental advantage of
the forward-folding procedure in the treatment of JMR systematic uncertainties. It is clear that
the previous Run 1 procedure of assessing JMR sytematic uncertainties with Gaussian smearing
needs to be reworked to an approach inspired by the in situ forward-folding methodology. This
is now an ongoing and active area of research within ATLAS, and new recommendations for
deriving the JMR systematic uncertainty based on forward-folding with Run 2 data are expected
in 2019/2020, inspired by the detailed studies summarised in this chapter.
Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of
ATLAS
During Run 1 of the LHC, large-radius jet reconstruction was studied extensively [90] and the
optimal reconstruction algorithm for such large-radius jets was found to be based on anti-kt
reconstruction with a radius parameter of R = 1.0. These jets were constructed from locally
calibrated topological clusters, and were groomed with the trimming algorithm. Different values
of the trimming parameters (subjet radius, Rsub, and subjet transverse momentum fraction,
fcut) were studied and an optimal set of values obtained. Trimming and LCTopo inputs have
already been described in some detail, as has the standard large-radius jet definition in ATLAS:
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20. This final choice of jet algorithm, input, groomer,
and grooming parameters was based on the ability of the reconstructed jet to discriminate some
signal from background, as well as the robustness of the jet reconstruction in the presence of
pileup.
Since these AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets were determined to be an opti-
mal large-radius jet definition in Run 1, there has been a renaissance in the field of jet grooming
and jet reconstruction. Developments include a series of detailed papers proposing new jet
grooming algorithms [118120], new methods of pileup mitigation [121, 122] beyond the more
standard approach of jet area subtraction, and consequently the creation of new classes of inputs
to the jet reconstruction. With a myriad of new jet groomers and inputs on the market, as
well as the significant gain in luminosity and pileup during Run 2 of ATLAS, it is natural to
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 131
wonder if the original optimal Run 1 jets are still performing the best out of a broad suite
of jet definitions, or can we do better and arrive at a new large-radius jet definition that is
more robust against pileup and offers improved signal and background discrimination? It is
this question that drives the studies summarised in this Chapter. The end goal is to determine
new, more sophisticated R = 1.0 jet definitions that will ensure that future analyses using the
full ATLAS Run 2 data-set utilise the best jet reconstruction techniques, in order to enhance
that final measurement or sensitivity to New Physics. Another important consideration (not
described in this Chapter, but discussed briefly in Appendix A) is the performance of both
current and new large-R jets in future, upgraded incarnations of the ATLAS detector.
This Chapter outlines the Run 2 jet reconstruction studies which we shall refer to as the jet
inputs and grooming scan. In these studies, hundreds of different R = 1.0 jet definitions are
considered, which are constructed from different combinations of new jet groomers, grooming
parameters, and new jet inputs. Several metrics of good jet performance are investigated:
the ability to discriminate W reconstruction from QCD background, the jet mass scale and
resolution, the pileup dependence of jet substructure variables (we shall describe these in more
detail shortly), and the ability of these jets to identify, or tag, bosons and top quarks. These
initial studies [123] are based entirely on Monte Carlo simulation, but ultimately will be followed
by dedicated data-driven assessments of the jet performance. Of the hundreds of new jet
definitions, the most promising jets from this scan were put in to a shortlist, and new jet energy
and mass calibrations were obtained in order to confirm that calibration at the jet substructure
level doesnt modify the conclusions of the initial longlist inputs and grooming scan. Before
describing the studies of the scan in detail, it is necessary to summarise the new inputs and
groomers that have been scrutinised. Therefore these shall first be discussed in some detail.
7.1 New Jet Inputs
The initial set of new jet inputs are modifications to the traditional locally calibrated topoclusters
by including pileup subtraction at the topocluster (or jet constituents) level using the techniques
of Voronoi subtraction and constituent subtraction [121], and afterward applying an additional
pileup reduction procedure which cuts on the jet pT, known as SoftKiller [122]. The very latest
inputs and grooming scan now includes a class of inputs which exploit additional detector
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 132
information from tracking in the jet reconstruction. These include modifying clusters by
associating tracks and subtracting off the matched cluster energy, which is the particle flow [105]
procedure already outlined in Section 6.1.6, as well as the association of tracks in order to reduce
the angular resolution of the final jet; these new objects are referred to as track-calo clusters and
are an ATLAS innovation which have been shown to greatly enhance sensitivity to searches for
new physics in specific dijets channels [124]. We shall not focus on these track-based inputs in
this thesis, but they are under active study and shall follow in additional publications in 2019.
7.1.1 Voronoi Subtraction
The method of Voronoi subtraction extends the original jet area -subtraction [92, 93], which
is applied at the jet reconstruction level, to the jet constituents level. First, lets define the
Voronoi area, AVoronoi, of the ith jet constituent (e.g. a topocluster in  ) to be the area of all
the points in    that are closer to this ith constituent than to any other constituent in the
event. As discussed in Section 5.3.1.2, the  is the median ratio of the jet transverse momentum
to jet area for the radius R jet reconstructed in the event. The Voronoi area is then subtracted
from each constituent (again, labelling constituents with i) in the following way:
pcorrT,i = pT,i   AVoronoi. (7.1)
The effects of applying Voronoi subtraction are summarised in Figure 7.1, which shows the
Voronoi areas in a simulated event in   , before and after the Voronoi area subtraction.
Clearly the subtraction produces many constituents with negative pcorrT ; we need an approach
to deal with such situations, and two common procedures adopted are negative suppression
and Voronoi Spreading. For negative suppression, the clusters with negative pcorrT are simply
removed from the event; they are not considered in the subsequent jet clustering or calculation
of the energy in the event arising from hard-scatter. Alternatively, the procedure of Voronoi
Spreading seeks to suppress the negative energy clusters, rather than remove them entirely. The
negative pcorrT in a given cluster is now spread across several nearby clusters. First consider some
ith cluster with negative pcorrT , and for each cluster i:
1. Find all j  S clusters in the event with an angular separation between i, Rij , less than 0.4.
2. Calculate a weight for each cluster j, with respect to the target cluster, i:

such that the sum of all wij across the j clusters is unity. This weight corresponds physically
to the relative influence of a given cluster on its neighbours.
3. Following this, the negative transverse momentum of the target i can now be spread
across all j  S according to:
pcorrT,j  max(0, p

value to zero.

level jets with a transverse momentum over 20 GeV. What can be seen is that the application

of the suppression and spreading preserves such jets. Both the Voronoi-suppressed and Voronoi-
spread inputs are considered in these studies, and will be referred to as VorSpreadLCTopo and
VorSuppLCTopo inputs respectively.
7.1.2 Constituent Subtraction
A second approach to pileup subtraction at the jet constituents level is the aptly-named
Constituent subtraction [121]. The constituent subtraction approach uses an area calculated by
populating the event, in   , with ghost particles (the same ghosts used in the method of
ghost-association), rather than the purely geometrical area calculation of Voronoi subtraction.
The  is computed from the median transverse momentum density in the same manner as in
Voronoi and jet area subtraction. The subtraction algorithm begins by populating the event
with these virtual ghost particles, which have a transverse momentum satisfying:
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 135
T = Ag  . (7.4)
Here Ag is the area of the ghost particle, which is set to 0.01, and in this way the pgT mimics the
typical pileup observed in a small  slice of 0.1 0.1. Once these ghosts have been added to the
event, the next step is to calculate the angular separation between the ith cluster and kth ghost:
Rik =
(i  gk)2 + (i  
k)2. (7.5)
Once all cluster-ghost combinations of angular separations have been calculated, the
associated cluster-ghost pairs are then sorted in order of ascending Rik. The algorithm
now proceeds iteratively through each of these cluster-ghost, i-k, pairs, modifying each cluster
according to the information from the associated ghost.
If : pT,i  pgT,k: pT,i  pT,i  p
T,k; p
T,k  0. (7.6)
Otherwise : pgT,k  p
T,k  pT,i, pT,i  0. (7.7)
This algorithm is continued until some Rik > Rmax is achieved. This Rmax is just a
tunable parameter in the algorithm, and for the grooming and inputs scan a value of 0.25 was
chosen based on dedicated ATLAS studies described in [125]. Inputs based on topoclusters
with this additional constituent subtraction applied shall be denoted CSLCTopo.
7.1.3 SoftKiller
Finally, the SoftKiller (SK) [122] approach simply uses the pT of a given particle to classify
whether it originates from a hard-scatter event, or from pileup. The SoftKiller algorithm makes
a hard transverse momentum cut on an event-by-event basis by first splitting the entire event in
to  grids of some scale l, and applying a cut on the pT such that afterwards half of the grids
in the event are empty. This scale l, which is just the length of one of the side of an    grid,
is the tunable parameter in SoftKiller, and different values have been investigated in the ATLAS
studies summarised in [125]. For the inputs and grooming scan, a grid size of 0.6  0.6 has
been used. The area-based pileup mitigation techniques are applied to the clusters before they
are provided to the SoftKiller algorithm, because doing so means that the cluster four-vectors
can be appropriately corrected before a final decision is made to remove them entirely from
the event. The inputs based on the combination of constituent subtraction and SoftKiller,
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 136
or Voronoi subtraction and SoftKiller, we shall denote CSSKLCTopo, and VorSuppSKLCTopo or
VorSpreadSKLCTopo respectively.
The sequential effects of applying Voronoi subtraction (and suppression), followed by
SoftKiller, are shown in Figure 7.3 for a high pileup event (average interactions per bunch-
crossing,  = 200) of Pythia 8 QCD dijets with a pp collision energy of 14 TeV, expected for
the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC. It can be seen that the combination of the subtraction
and SoftKiller leaves an event which is dominated by the hardest jet constituents. Following
this, jet reconstruction can now be applied in order to generate new VorSuppSKLCTopo jets.
7.2 New Jet Groomers
Jet trimming has been the ATLAS workhorse of jet grooming since its implementation following
the extensive Run 1 jet definition optimisation studies [90], and has already been described in
some detail (Section 5.3.2) following the discussion of AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20
jet reconstruction. Another popular jet grooming procedure is pruning [126], which was
proposed by the theory community shortly after trimming. Since the implementation of
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets in ATLAS there have been two major develop-
ments in jet grooming: first the introduction of the Modified Mass Drop Tagger (mMDT) [118]
in 2013 and, crucially the 2014 generalisation of this mMDT algorithm, referred to as Soft
Drop [119]. Soft Drop is a highly favoured groomer for theorists, and has been employed
in CMS large-radius jet reconstruction for some time, whereas ATLAS lacked any dedicated
study of its performance in jet reconstruction. Even in the past two years, Soft Drop has been
further extended, spawning new algorithms of recursive Soft Drop and bottom-up Soft Drop [120]
which shall be studied in some detail. There is also a relatively new approach to quark-gluon
discrimination using a new technique of iterative Soft Drop [127], but we shall not explore that
particular facet of Soft Drop declustering any further.
7.2.1 Pruning
The motivation of pruning [126] is to find a way to algorithmically modify the clustering sequence
of a reconstructed jet, such that specific splittings which make up that clustering sequence, and
which pull in contributions from pileup and the underlying event, are discarded. To achieve this

a pruning radius must be determined, such that the hardest prongs/splittings of the jet fall in
to separate subjets, allowing softer radiation falling outside of these prongs to be removed. The
algorithm commences by taking the constituents of the initial large-radius jet and reclustering
them using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm1. This forms a clustering sequence, which is
supposed to represent the intuitive parton shower branching of the jet based on the angular
ordering of the constituents.
As the name suggests, the sequence is split into a series of clusters, j1, j2, ... etc. At each
merging step in the cluster sequence, j1 + j2  j3, a check is conducted to see if the clustering
is either soft or wide-angled using the following conditions:
Wide angle : R(j1, j2)  Rcut 
2m(j1, j2)
pT(j1, j2)
(7.8)
Soft : z  zcut, (7.9)
where R(j1, j2), m(j1, j2), and pT(j1, j2) are the angular distance, mass, and transverse
momentum from the potential cluster combination j1 and j2, and z = min(pT(j1),pT(j2))pT(j1,j2) , assuming
the j1 cluster is softest. The z can be thought of as the energy fraction of the softest cluster
at the merging step. The Rcut and zcut are tunable parameters in the algorithm. If the
clustering is either soft or wide-angled (i.e. if one of the above conditions is met), then the
cluster with the smaller pT is discarded. A cartoon of the pruning procedure is given in Figure 7.4.
Pruning was used to groom jets in CMS during Run 1 [90], before Soft Drop (see Section 7.2.3)
was adopted. CMS pruned with parameters Rcut = 0.5, zcut = 0.1: smaller Rcut and larger zcut
1Recall that this is a sequential recombination algorithm with p = 0, and thus combines constituents i and j
based solely on their angular separation in  and , Rij
, where R = 1.0 for ATLAS large-radius jets.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 139
correspond to more aggressive pruning.
7.2.2 Modified Mass Drop Tagger
One of the groundbreaking publications which helped to establish jet substructure as a coherent
phenomenological and experimental field was that of the BDRS algorithm [128], used to remove
background jets (which will have more collinear splittings and soft radiation) in searches
for the Higgs boson. An extension of this procedure, and a small modification thereafter,
led to the modified mass drop tagger (mMDT) algorithm [118]. The creation of the mMDT
tagger provided a nice solution to an issue with the calculation of the jet mass: namely, it
provided a groomed jet which had a radiation pattern that gave an analytical mass calculation
free of so-called non-global logarithms [68, 118]. This has nice theoretical consequences of
making the final mass simpler to calculate analytically, as well as potentially reducing its
associated theoretical uncertainties. For this reason mMDT, and generalisations such as Soft
Drop, are favoured by the theory community as the de-facto grooming tools for experimentalists.
The mMDT procedure begins in a similar manner to pruning: first the constituents of
the initial large-radius jet are clustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm, producing a
Cambridge-Aachen jet, labelled j. Then the last step of the clustering is undone, splitting
j into two subjets, j1 and j2, with pT(j1) > pT(j2). Following this, the mass drop and
balance splitting conditions are tested:
Mass Drop : m(j1) < m(j2) (7.10)
Balance Splitting :
min(pT(j1), pT(j2))
pT(j1, j2)
> zcut. (7.11)
If both of these conditions are passed, the algorithm immediately stops and the original jet,
j, is kept. If either condition is failed, the softer j2 is discarded and j1 becomes the new j in
the algorithm. The new j is then once again undone, and its constituents combined into a new
Cambridge-Aachen jet. Again the last clustering step is undone, creating a new j1, and the
conditions repeated. For the studies described in this Chapter, the mMDT is used in grooming
mode:  is set to an infinitely large number to ensure the mass drop condition is always satisfied.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 140
Once this procedure has been applied to the clustering history of the jet, the remaining
constituents are reclustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm, with a radius parameter R
= 1.0, and a subjet radius parameter of Rfilt = min(0.3, R(j1,j2)2 ). Any constituents which fall
outside of the three highest pT subjets are discarded.
7.2.3 Soft Drop
Soft Drop [119] is an extension of the modified mass drop tagger by modifying the original zcut
criterion to include an explicit angular distance dependence on the jet. We shall first briefly
discuss the original vanilla Soft Drop before highlighting more recent developments in Soft
Drop grooming.
7.2.3.1 Vanilla Soft Drop
The original idea of Soft Drop is to simply extend the requirement on the cluster energy fraction,
z. The algorithm proceeds by reclustering the jet constituents into a Cambridge-Aachen jet
of size R (as always, R = 1.0 in these studies). The first step of clustering is undone, giving
the two j1 and j2 branches just as in the mMDT case, and then if the condition:
min(pT(j1), pT(j2))
pT(j1, j2)
< zcut
(7.12)
holds the lowest pT branch is removed and the process is repeated by going deeper into the
clustering sequence of the jet i.e. by then undoing the last clustering step on the remaining
branch which has survived this first Soft Drop condition. Otherwise, the algorithm immediately
terminates and the jet is unchanged. The angular component of the jet is controlled by the
value of :  = 0 reduces to the original mMDT case which is then purely a cut on the soft
radiation entering the jet. Increasing  permits increasing amounts of soft and wide-angle
radiation to enter the jet, making the grooming less aggressive. Like the mMDT algorithm, Soft
Drop also removes non-global logarithms in the analytical jet mass; unlike mMDT, there is no
filtering with Rfilt applied to the jets once the clustering history of the jet has been scanned.
A cartoon of this vanilla Soft Drop declustering is provided in Figure 7.5.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 141
Figure 7.5: A cartoon of the vanilla variant of Soft Drop, based on those in [90].
7.2.3.2 Recursive Soft Drop
Recursive Soft Drop [120] offers a simple extension to vanilla Soft Drop. In the original Soft
Drop grooming, the algorithm finishes an iteration once the soft drop condition is satisfied, and
consequently it finds the first hard splitting in the clustering history, and takes this as the jet.
With a little extra thought it is clear that this procedure is limited. Consider the top quark 
a top quark decay can be captured in a large-radius jet and will typically have a three-prong
decay pattern: one prong (or energy cluster) from the b-quark, and two from the hadronic decay
of the W . Here, the three-prong decay may mean that standard Soft Drop is not sufficient to
find the actual jet as it proceeds until only one hard-splitting is found. In recursive Soft Drop,
the algorithm instead proceeds until N hard-splittings have been found i.e. the clustering is
undone once, giving j1 and j2, but the first iteration of the algorithm is not complete until the
Soft Drop condition has been satisfied N times, where the clustering history of the hardest
subjet is followed at each step where the Soft Drop condition is tested. N is an additional
tunable parameter, which takes integer values and has an infinity setting: for the case N =
 the entire clustering history of the jet is explored before the first iteration of the algorithm
terminates. The algorithm therefore progresses until N + 1 subjets have been found, or until all
subjets are made up of single particles. A schematic depiction of recursive Soft Drop is provided
in Figure 7.6. From the above description, it is clear that N = 1 recursive Soft Drop reduces to
the original vanilla variant, and N = 0 simply returns the original jet.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 142
Figure 7.6: A cartoon of the recursive variant of Soft Drop. From [120].
7.2.3.3 Bottom-up Soft Drop
Another variant is Bottom-up Soft Drop (BUSD) [120] which has been developed as an alternative
to N =  recursive Soft Drop. Recursive Soft Drop provides a top-down grooming approach,
where the jet is analysed and groomed starting from its complete clustering sequence, thought
of as a tree of partonic branches. In contrast, the BUSD approach starts from the leaves of
the jets clustering history, reclustering those leaves based on whether or not the Soft Drop
condition is passed. It can be applied locally to groom the jet, or globally to groom the entire
event.
The local variant of BUSD starts from the leaves of the clustering history of the jet, and
proceeds by applying the Soft Drop condition to each pairwise combination of particles in the
initial Cambridge-Aachen clustering history. At each step in the large-radius jet Cambridge-
Aachen reclustering, a pseudojet is obtained from combining particles i and j with smallest
distance dij = Rij/R, with a transverse momentum given by:
pseudojet
max(pT,i, pT,j) if the Soft Drop condition fails,
pT,i + pT,j otherwise.
(7.13)
Since one begins from the full clustering history, BUSD effectively inverts the procedure of

event-level and therefore does not require any specific jet definition. The groomed event will
afterwards then contain a subset of the original particles from the ungroomed event, and these
can then be combined using any jet algorithm. The global BUSD is an interesting first approach
to event-level grooming, and is certainly something which could be applied to ATLAS and CMS
data in the future. However, for the studies described in this Chapter, the local variant of BUSD
will be studied only.
7.3 Jet Substructure Variables
The previous chapter was devoted to the definition, scale, and resolution of the jet mass, the
simplest variable which provides information on the substructure of a jet itself. The field of
jet substructure is rich and fascinating and in this Chapter we will use several additional jet
substructure variables to construct metrics which assess the performance of different large-radius
jet definitions in ATLAS. As has been previously discussed, when a particle has a transverse
momentum comparable to (or greater than) its total mass, the angular separation of the
daughter particles is small enough for the full decay to be captured within a suitably large-radius
jet. Understanding the substructure of such jets allows us to differentiate those containing
a top decay from those containing a hadronic W decay, and so forth. This discrimination
can be achieved through analysing the mass of the jet, or, to take things a step further, the
distribution of energy within that jet. With this in mind, let us turn to two incredibly successful
approaches at scrutinising the energy distribution of particles captured within boosted jets:
N -subjettiness [129] and energy correlation functions [130]. These quantities belong to a broad
class of variables which quantify the overall jet shape.
7.3.1 N-subjettiness
Understanding the distribution of energy within a jet, and the direction of the energy distribution
with respect to some geometrical axis which defines the jet direction, is very important when one
is interested in differentiating large-radius jets which originate from top quarks from those which
originate from bosons, or even background QCD processes. A jet originating from hadronic top
decay will typically contain a three-prong energy distribution i.e. three well-defined hard lobes
of energy within the jet: in the dominant t  Wb decay, the b-quark will give rise to one energy
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 144
spike, and the W  qq, where q generically labels a quark, will give rise to the additional two
energy lobes. In contrast, for a jet originating from the hadronic decay of a W boson, there
will clearly only be two energy lobes, or prongs. A QCD jet would typically have its energy
smeared across the    space it occupies, and not display obvious prongy energy features.
It is therefore reasonable to consider the pronginess of the energy distribution of the jet as
an assessment of the jets substructure in differentiating jets originating from different heavy
particles and QCD. One popular approach to quantifying this pronginess is N -subjettiness [129].
The jet shape N -subjettiness variable, donated N , is calculated by first identifying N
candidate subjets from the jet of interest. This is achieved by taking the constituents of the
original jet, and applying the kt clustering algorithm, forcing it to return N subjets. Once the
N subjets and their directions have been obtained, the N can now be calculated according to:
pT,k min(R1,k,R2,k, ...,RN,k), (7.14)
where the summation runs over the k jet inputs (particles or energy clusters) with transverse
momentum pT,k and Ri,k is the angular separation in    between the ith candidate subjet
and the kth cluster. There is an additional factor out at the front, depending on some d0:
pT,kR0, (7.15)
where R0 is the radius of the jet of interest, which is of course 1.0 in these studies. From the
definition above, it is clear that jets with N  0 have their radiation strongly aligned with the
directions of the candidate subjets, and thus for such jets the N subjet hypothesis is a good
one. These jets will therefore have N or fewer actual subjets. Conversely, jets with N  0
have radiation distributed away from the subjet directions, and therefore such jets will in fact
contain at least N + 1 actual subjets.
To utilise N -subjettiness in identifying boosted heavy particles, it is not sufficient to only
require a small N . Consider the case of identifying boosted top jets. Top jets should have
three hard energy lobes, and hence three subjets. Therefore N = 3 is a natural choice, and
indeed 3 is small for true top jets. However, clearly 3 will also be small for jets with only 2
subjets, such as those originating from W bosons. However, we can still use 2 usefully here:
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 145
Figure 7.7: The 32 distribution for a truth-level sample of top jets and QCD jets. The top jets have
a smaller average 32 as expected from their strongly three-prong energy structure. From [129].
this variable will remain small for true W boson jets but will be larger for top jets, therefore a
powerful variable to discriminate 3-prong from 2-prong jets is in fact the ratio:
32 =
. (7.16)
Now, we have a variable 32 which will be smaller for top jets than for W boson jets, or
other jets with 2 energy lobes/prongs/subjets. Similarly the ratio 21 = 2/1 will be smaller
for jets with two-prong structure than one-prong structure, and as such is a good variable
for discriminating jets originating from bosons from jets originating from background QCD
processes. The separation power of the 32 for a truth-level simulation of top and QCD jets is
illustrated in Figure 7.7.
One disadvantage to using N -subjettiness is the need to rely on the direction, and hence
axis, of the jet itself. It is possible to quantify energy distributions within a jet without relying
on the jet axis by using a second class of substructure variables, referred to as energy correlation
functions.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 146
7.3.2 Energy Correlation Functions
The N -point energy correlation function (ECF) [130], eN , is defined:
i1,i2,...,iNJ
pT,ia
(N1
c=b+1
RiaRib
, (7.17)
where the summation is over all particles within some system J , which can be the entire
event or a single jet, and is a function of the transverse momenta of each constituent and the
angular separation in  between each pairwise combination of constituents. The  parameter
controls the amount of angular information which enters the ECF (in a similar manner to the
 parameter used in the Soft Drop condition):  = 0 removes all angular information in the ECF.
In this way, the two- and three-point energy correlations functions are defined:
i<jJ
pT,ipT,jRij, (7.18)
i<j<kJ
pT,ipT,jpT,kRijR
jk, (7.19)
with additional transverse momentum normalisations added at the front of each ECF. A
feature of this system of equations is that (N + 1)-point correlates tend to zero if there are only
N actual particles in the system J . In the context of jets, this would mean that a jet with only
N well-defined subjets will have a value of eN +1 significantly smaller than e
N . In this way, it
can be seen immediately that ratios of energy correlation functions behave much like ratios of N -
subjettiness, but without requiring an initial N candidate subjet hypothesis with defined jet axes.
Previous ATLAS studies have established that a variable which is very effective at identify-
ing jets which two hard energy lobes, i.e. those originating from bosons, is the so-called
2 variable [107], defined:
(e=12 )3
. (7.20)
The choice of  = 1 is used throughout the energy correlation definitions considered in
ATLAS. We shall return to this variable in the context of devising metrics for the jet inputs
and grooming scan shortly.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 147
7.4 The Jet Inputs and Grooming Scan
Having described the various new jet inputs, jet groomers, and jet substructure variables, we are
now in a position to outline the jet inputs and grooming scan which has been covered in several
public results [123, 131], with a further publication to follow later in 2019. This is an ambitious
project which seeks to understand if their is a more robust large-radius jet definition which
could be adopted in ATLAS, utilising the very latest jet inputs and grooming technology. The
selection is based on important metrics of pileup mitigation, behaviour of the jet mass scale and
resolution, and the performance of the jets in conventional W boson and top taggers [132]. We
shall first describe the initial ATLAS Run 2 grooming scan study, which studied jet definition
based on calorimeter information only, before briefly discussing future and ongoing work towards
a second Run 2 scan. This second scan is even more ambitious and considers jet definitions
where additional tracking information is used.
The scan uses variables that are directly affected by the jet energy and jet mass calibration.
Since the initial combination of inputs and groomers resulted in almost 500 different candidate
jet collections, it was impossible to derive dedicated JES and JMS calibrations for all such jet
collections within any reasonable timescale. Consequently, a two-step approach is adopted: a set
of sensible metrics are devised in order to build up a shortlist of about 5 winning jet collections
from the initial O(500). The shortlistsed jets are then calibrated at the JES and JMS, and,
since this study is purely Monte Carlo-based, there is no need for an in situ JES or JMS to be
determined. Once these shortlisted jets have been calibrated, their performance is re-examined
in order to confirm that the overall jet performance in the various metrics is not modified by
the additional calibration. Three Monte Carlo samples of jets are considered: two are signals,
where a W   WZ sample is filtered to provide a source of Wjets, and has top jets sourced
from a Z   tt signal; the final is a QCD background from a standard sample of Pythia 8
QCD dijets. These Monte Carlo samples have already been described in Chapter 6, and their
details are there summarised in Table 6.2.
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 148
7.4.1 First Run 2 Inputs and Grooming Scan
Following the application of constituent subtraction and pileup mitigation techniques to the
inputs for each jet, the anti-kt algorithm is used to cluster the jet constituents into large-radius
jets of size R = 1.0. In addition, jet grooming is then applied to remove additional energy flow
from pileup and the underlying event which could still contaminate the large jet. In the initial
scan modified Mass Drop, vanilla Soft Drop, trimming, and pruning are used to groom; jet
reclustering is also used in order to assess its power as a groomer. The full suite of groomers and
grooming parameters are summarised in Table 7.1. These different jet groomers are applied to
unmodified LCTopo inputs, as well as new inputs based on CSLCTopo, SKLCTopo, CSSKLCTopo,
VorSpreadLCTopo, VorSuppLCTopo, and VorSuppSKLCTopo.

Table 7.1: A different jet groomers, and grooming parameteters, considered in the initial jet inputs
and grooming scan.
In order to ensure a fair comparison between each of these different (uncalibrated) jet
definitions (recall that we are considering O(500) different collections in this scan), truth jets
of R = 1.0 are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm and are then geometrically matched
in    to the reconstruction-level jets. Two sample topologies are considered in these initial
studies: first a QCD background topology, where the jet pair corresponding to the leading truth
jet with pT > 300 GeV, and within R < 0.75 of the corresponding reconstructed jet, is kept.
The pT requirements ensure the jet is sufficiently boosted. Following this selection, grooming
is applied to both truth and reconstruction-level jets. The second topology is signal Wjet
sample, where the truth jet originating from the W boson is kept. Such a jet is identified as
the truth jet which is closest to the W boson in R, and is also within R < 0.75 of the
same particle. Once the truth jet which is to be kept has been identified, the same geometrical
matching is employed to find the appropriate reconstructed jet. Again, the truth jet must
have a transverse momentum above 300 GeV, to ensure that the W boson is fully-contained
such that its substructure can be faithfully studied. To ensure that jets are reconstructed well
7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 149
within the region of ATLAS where charged particle tracks may be reconstructed, and additional
requirement that the truth jet || < 1.2 is also imposed.
7.4.1.1 Background Rejection Performance
Due to the practical impossibilities of calibrating hundreds of jet collections (where the initial
inputs are at the LCW scale), the first sets of metrics considered have to be ones which allow
for meaningful conclusions to be drawn in the absence of a calibration. The first such metric
attempts to gauge which jet definitions are best at distinguishing the W -jet signal from a QCD
jets background using the jet mass as a discriminating variable.
The jet mass (for these studies we only consider the calorimeter jet mass) should provide
reasonable discrimination between QCD and Wjets: the former has a falling mass spectrum
arising from gluon emissions and splittings in the parton shower, the latter has a clear resonant
peak around the W boson pole. As previously discussed, the jet mass is highly dependent on
pileup, and therefore should also be dependent on the grooming technique and strategy applied.
Consequently so is the amount of QCD background expected within the phase-space containing
the W boson mass peak. Figure 7.8 shows the jet mass distributions for signal and background,
using R = 1.0 jets reconstructed from LCTopo inputs with Soft Drop grooming. A zcut = 0.1 is
applied, and  parameter values of 0.0, 1.0, and 2.0 are considered. The Soft Drop grooming
shifts the QCD jets to lower masses, whilst keeping the W mass signal relatively fixed. The
most aggressive grooming comes from  = 0.0, where no wide-angle information entering the jet
is kept and therefore more of the mass of the jet originating from soft interactions is groomed
away. In the case of Wjets, the mass originates from a clear hard splitting and thus the mass
peak is preserved when the wide-angle information is removed from the jet. This behaviour is
observed at both lower and higher ptrueT . Similar behaviour is observed when mMDT is used in
the grooming.
As expected, smaller values of zcut lead to a larger fraction of higher mass QCD jets, and
therefore the background contamination around the W mass peak (hence the background
efficiency, to be defined shortly) also increases. This is expected because decreasing the zcut will
result in a larger fraction of the softer components of the jet being kept during the grooming

In order to quantify the background rejection power of each jet collection, the smallest mass
window around the W peak is constructed such that 68 % of the signal jets are contained within
the window mass range. The total fraction of QCD jets which enter this same mass window
is determined, and the background efficiency for this fixed 68 % signal acceptance is defined
as 68 %Bkg = NQCD/(NQCD + NWjets). An example of such mass window is illustrated for the
standard AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets in Figure 7.10. For different jet ptrueT
ranges, the background efficiency is calculated for every jet collection; lower efficiencies indicate

that less QCD is contaminating the region of phase-space around the W mass peak. These
background efficiencies, for the different jet collections, are summarised in Figure 7.11 for two
different transverse momentum ranges.
The large heatmap of background efficiency, although complicated, comes with a few crucial
take-home messages. At lower ptrueT , background contamination can clearly be reduced by
modifying the inputs to include a form of pileup mitigation i.e. constituent subtraction. At
larger jet ptrueT , this distinction between different jets inputs is less obvious. Now, the amount of
background contamination is more dependent on the jet groomer itself; harsher jet grooming

pushes the QCD mass distribution to lower values and therefore increases the separating power
between the QCD background and the signal jets.
7.4.1.2 Jet Mass Pileup Dependence
The jet mass itself depends on both the energy scale of the jet and the angular spread of
that energy. Consequently, the effects of wide-angle contributions from pileup are even more
apparent in the jet mass than the jet energy alone. This should result in large changes in the
mass distribution with respect to the pileup, and therefore the performance of both the jet
mass scale, and its resolution, with respect to the in-time pileup (quantified by the number of
primary vertices per event, NPV) makes for an important metric. The variation in the jet mass
distribution for different ranges of NPV is illustrated in Figure 7.12.
In reality, it is not viable to study the pileup dependence of the jet mass scale (and its
resolution) because the jets are not yet calibrated at the energy and mass scale, and the
pileup dependence would be modified following any such calibration. In order to study pileup

dependence in a meaningful (uncalibrated) manner, instead the reconstructed W boson peak
is fitted iteratively with a Gaussian, in different bins of NPV, and the central value and 68
% interquantile range mass window are used as values of the average W boson reconstructed
mass and width respectively. Figures 7.13 and 7.14 show the average reconstructed W mass
and its width, W , for several different jet collections which were observed to provide some of
the lowest background efficiencies. The jets considered lie in the lower ptrueT range between 300
GeV and 500 GeV, which is more susceptible to pileup. Most grooming algorithms which use
unmodified LCTopo inputs observe an increase in the W jet mass as NPV increases, due to the
increase in uncorrelated energy flow entering the jet expected from conditions of higher in-time
pileup. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the standard ATLAS trimming configuration (Rsub = 0.2, fcut =
0.05) outperforms both the Soft Drop and pruning algorithms, as this trimming algorithm was

optimised based on Run 1 studies of the pileup dependence of different jet definitions [90] and has
been reported in numerous cases to be particularly pileup robust. In all cases, independent of the
grooming procedure adopted, the application of the constituent subtraction significantly reduces
the pileup dependence. Similar conclusions may also be drawn for the width of theW mass peak.
The values of the linear fit to the pileup dependencies of the W mass and its width are
used as proxies for the two metrics quantifying the pileup dependence of the jet mass scale
and resolution respectively. These values are summarised for all jet collections in the heatmaps
shown in Figures 7.15 and 7.16, which attempt to classify the pileup dependence of the jet mass
and jet mass resolution respectively. It is now evident that the pileup dependence of both mass
and resolution is significantly reduced when the LCTopo inputs are modified using constituent
subtraction, or Voronoi subtraction, with SoftKiller. The CSSKLCTopo and VorSuppSKLCTopo

inputs are particularly pileup robust. Between these two inputs, the CSSKLCTopo is the most
pileup robust in the lowest ptrueT region of phase-space considered in these studies. Between the
different jet groomers, the variations in pileup robustness are less strong. That said, perhaps
the most obvious general trend is that grooming techniques which are more aggressive tend to
provide jets with a smaller pileup dependence, as would be expected. This is illustrated, for
example, in the case of Soft Drop when contrasting  = 2.0 and  = 1.0 grooming with the
harsher  = 0.0 case.

The D2 variable is particularly powerful as it characterises the distribution of the hard energy
between all constituents within the jet; as such, it has significant utility in assessing the 2-

pronginess of the energy flow within the reconstructed jet. This variable is ideal for constructing
W/Z boson taggers, but it is sensitive to pileup contributions which can affect the energy flow
within the hadronic jet. Example pileup dependence is illustrated at low ptrueT in Figure 7.17,
and is most clearly observed when standard LCTopo inputs are used. Here, Soft Drop grooming
is applied to the jets. As was concluded in the case of the jet mass pileup dependence, using
constituent subtraction on the jet inputs improves the robustness of the substructure variable
with respect to NPV. An important application of D2 is in exotics searches for New Physics
(for example, see [124]), and therefore understanding its robustness against pileup for various
different jet collections is an obvious metric to consider.
The approach considered in order to measure the D2 pileup dependence is illustrated in the

Figure 7.18: A schematic demonstrating how the pileup dependence on a jet substructure variable,
such as D2, can be assessed in a meaningful way. The distribution of all events is first split into bins of
NPV, and the substructure variable is studied in each bin.
schematic in Figure 7.18. More generally, this sort of approach can be used to characterise the
pileup dependence in the tails of numerous jet substructure variables. First, the NPV distribution
across all events is split into several bins, i.e. [0, 15], [15, 30], [30, 45], etc. Following this, the
D2 distribution is plotted for the events (such as Wjet signal events) in the lowest NPV bin,
and a cut on D2 is defined that provides some desired signal efficiency. In these studies, a 50
% signal efficiency is required for jets with a mass above 50 GeV, using an initial NPV bin in
the range of 0  15. The same cut is then used on the D2 distribution described by the events
in the next NPV bin, and a new signal efficiency from this cut is calculated. This process is
iterated through all NPV bins, such that the signal efficiency can then be plotted with respect
to the average NPV. The gradient of the fit to this distribution then quantifies the D2 pileup
dependence on the jets considered in the sample of interest. This approach is extended to all jet
definitions considered in the scan, and efficiencies for both the Wjets and QCD topologies
have been studied. Example linear fits to NPV vs. D2 signal efficiency plots for Wjets are
shown in Figure 7.19 for a few different jet definitions, where LCTopo, constituent subtraction,
and constituent subtraction plus SoftKiller inputs are compared in each plot. The complete

Figure 7.19: The pileup dependence on the Wjet D2 efficiency, for different jet inputs and grooming
algorithms, in the range 300 < ptrueT < 500 GeV. The values of the different slopes from the linear fits
are provided in Figure 7.20.
heatmaps, made from the linear fits for each jet collection, are summarised in Figures 7.20
and 7.21 for Wjets and QCD topologies respectively.
The conclusions drawn from studying the D2 efficiency metric mirror those of the jet mass
and jet mass resolution pileup dependence metric. Again the inputs based on CSSKLCTopo
and VorSuppSKLCTopo are the most robust against pileup, with CSSKLCTopo outperforming
the Voronoi-suppressed inputs slightly. As before, the trimmed algorithm is seen to be stable
against pileup, even without using constituent subtraction or Voronoi-based techniques at the
jet inputs level, and in particular smaller values of Rsub are more robust against pileup than
larger values. For pruning, it is clear that larger values of Rcut and smaller values of zcut reduce
pileup robustness since they collectively reduce the amount of grooming applied to the initial jet.
These effects are more apparent in the Wjets topology, which has the two-prong distribution

7.4.1.4 Final Shortlist
The major conclusion from the initial set of studies in the inputs and grooming scan is that there
is not a single obvious combination of jet input and groomer which is superior to all the others,
when the results of all metrics are taken into account. However, there are clearly important
trends which have been observed across these different metrics. Based on these general trends,
a shortlist of promising new jet collections can be proposed. The finalist jet collections are
summarised in Table 7.2, based on studies which consider a QCD jets background and a W -jets
signal.
Constituent Type Grooming Algorithm Parametere Choice
CSSKLCTopo Soft Drop zcut = 0.1,  = 0
CSSKLCTopo Pruning zcut = 0.15, Rcut = 0.25
CSSKLCTopo Trimming Rsub = 0.1, fcut = 9 %
LCTopo Trimming Rsub = 0.2, fcut = 5 %
EMTopo Reclustering Rsmall = 0.4, fcut = 5 %
Table 7.2: The shortlisted jet inputs and groomers for the initial scan.
The CSSKLCTopo and VorSuppSKLCTopo inputs are the most pileup resilient, with CSSK
slightly outperforming VorSuppSK. For this reason, the CSSK inputs are kept in the final shortlist.
The trimmed LCTopo inputs which have been used as the standard large-radius jet definition in
ATLAS also performed very well, and are kept for further study, together with a reclustered jet
definition which uses R = Rsmall = 0.4 EMTopo jets as inputs. At high ptrueT , it was observed that
the Soft Drop algorithm performs best at separating W signal jets from QCD based on selecting
the jet mass alone. To ensure a fair comparison, it was decided that at least one example of
each grooming algorithm should be selected, and so the best performing trimming and pruning
configurations also make the shortlist. No mMDT grooming is included, but instead a Soft
Drop configuration with  = 0.0 (which reduces to mMDT in that limit) is considered in the
final shortlist. The second trimming configuration, which uses CSSKLCTopo inputs, was found to
provide excellent pileup robustness, although the degree of grooming it applied to a given jet by
is particularly aggressive. This aggressive trimming configuration further motivates the standard
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 being shortlisted so that the two algorithms may

be further compared.
In order to study these finalist jet definitions in more detail, the JES and JMS corrections
need to be derived and applied. The standard approach is adopted for each finalist jet collection:
the Monte Carlo JES is first determined in bins of Etrue, ptrueT , and det from a sample of QCD
dijets, and applied to those same QCD dijets to correct the reconstruction-level jets to their
matched truth-level jets in energy. Following this, those jets are then used as inputs to derive
the JMS in bins of mtrue, ptrueT , and det. The final JES + JMS calibration is then applied
to both the QCD and Wjets samples considered in these studies. As previously discussed,
it is expected that the closure in the jet mass response would be significantly improved after
applying the JMS correction. This is illustrated in Figures 7.22 and 7.23 for regions of low-
and high-ptrueT respectively, selecting a mass around the W mass pole, for both the QCD and
Wjets samples. Excellent closure in the mass response is recovered after the application of
the JES + JMS calibration, derived for each shortlisted jet collection. The precise features
in the jet mass response, such as the low response tails, vary between different groomers and
inputs. This information is captured in the fractional jet mass resolution, calculated from the
68 % interquantile range of the jet mass response and the median response. The JMRs for the
shortlisted jet definitions, as a function of ptrueT , are shown in Figure 7.24. The JMR behaviour
is characteristic of the calorimeter jet mass: at higher transverse momentum the JMR degrades
due to the Lorentz boost of the jet giving rise to an opening angle between the captured decay
products which is comparable to the calorimeter granularity.
7.4.1.5 Tagging Performance Post-Calibration
Following calibration, the shortlisted jet collections can now be tested as simple W boson
taggers. Two such taggers are considered: one based on a simple cut placed on the W signal
mass peak, and a second designed to mimic existing cut-based boson tagging at ATLAS [132],
consisting of a cut on the signal boson mass peak and a requirement on the D2 variable. Before
summarising the performance on these taggers on the finalist jet collections, we must outline a
systematic approach to studying tagging performance in particle physics. Assessing the tagging
performance is essentially a counting experiment, where one computes the tagging efficiency and
background rejection for a particular signal sample and background, based on a particular set of

efficiency values. Generally X can be a single variable or a collection of variables, but here a single
variable X is considered for clarity.

cuts on a particular set of variables. In the cartoon provided in Figure 7.25 a variable X has
been plotted for some signal (which has a large peak in some X-window) and a smoothly-falling
background. For some interval in X, denoted X, the total numbers of signal and background
events are measured to be NSig and NBkg respectively. An algorithm which tags signal and
rejects background will now have a tagging (or signal) efficiency,
Sig =
NSig +NBkg
, (7.21)
and background rejection factor,
NSig +NBkg
. (7.22)
By scanning across the X distribution in windows of size X, different tagging efficiencies
and background rejections may be calculated. A scatter plot of these different tagging efficiencies
against background rejections then forms the so-called Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve [133]. The typical form of a ROC curve is illustrated in Figure 7.26, where the best
taggers have high tagging efficiencies and comparatively high background rejection factors.
Now that we have developed a formal procedure for quantifying the performance of a tagger,
let us return to the two tagging performance metrics applied to the shortlisted jet collections.

7. Optimising Large-Radius Jets in Run 2 of ATLAS 171
In the first such study, a mass-only tagger is created by cutting on the calorimeter jet mass for
the signal W boson and background QCD jets. Such jet masses are shown, for two different
ptrueT bins, in Figure 7.27. The smallest possible mass window and central mass position are
constructed around the W boson signal peak in order to provide some W boson signal tagging
efficiency. For this fixed tagging efficiency, the background contribution within this mass window
is used to obtain the background rejection. The signal tagging efficiency is then varied, and a
new minimum W mass window consistent with this tagging efficiency is calculated. Then, as
before, the background rejection is re-evaluated. By continuing to vary the tagging efficiency,
and recalculate the new background rejection factor, the two example ROC curves in Figure 7.28
are obtained, for low and high jet transverse momentum bins. At lower transverse momenta,
the performance between the different jet collections tends to be similar since the background
QCD jet masses are typically pushed to lower values, and consequently have very similar mass
tails falling within the signal peak for the different jet collections. The reclustered jet collection
gives the optimal performance except at high tagging efficiency, where there is a decline. The
trimmed and pruned jet collections also drop dramatically in this region, due to their particular
grooming configurations which are harsh and therefore remove substantial amounts of signal, as
well as background, jets. At higher ptrueT the new CSSKLCTopo jet collections perform best, as
expected since these jet collections were selected based on their superior performance under the
background efficiency metric.
The second-tagger uses both mass and D2 information. First, in a similar manner to the
background efficiency metric calculation, the minimum mass window around the W signal is
found such that 68 % of all signal jets fall into the mass range. With this fixed mass window, the
D2 distribution is then scanned (example distributions, after the 68 % mass window selection
is applied, are shown in Figure 7.29), where the signal W jets have lower D2 owing to their
two-prong energy structure coming from the hadronic two-point decay of theW boson. Scanning
in windows of D2 then generates the mass + D2 tagger ROC curves shown in Figure 7.30.
The performance with this second tagger is dramatically different to the mass-only tagger: now
the standard trimmed LCTopo jets perform best at lower and higher ptrueT , and this difference
is particularly striking in the latter case. An understanding of this behaviour can in fact be
gleaned from Figure 7.29. At higher transverse momenta in particular, it is clear that the new
jet algorithms leave the Wjet D2 relatively unchanged, but they do modify the QCD jets

more significantly. For QCD jets these new algorithms have the effect of cutting away the
radiation more aggressively than the case of standard trimming, resulting in far fewer clusters
in the jet. This reduces the discrimination power between the QCD and Wjets, and hence
we see the dramatic drop in tagging performance from these CSSKLCTopo plus groomer jet
collections. A natural question is which component of the jet algorithm is removing the soft
radiation in the jet: the constituent-subtraction applied to the jet inputs or the jet grooming
itself? Studies which are not detailed here [123] revealed that in fact the choice of jet groomer
plays the primary role in over- or under-removing radiation captured within the substructure
of the reconstructed jet. This leads to a very important lesson: although aggressive grooming
configurations in trimming, pruning, and Soft Drop give rise to optimal robustness against
pileup, and maximize background rejection power, they also suffer from removing too much
radiation from jets such that the important substructure information associated with the jet
can be compromised. Therefore, for future studies, it was concluded that it is dangerous to
rely on overly-aggressive grooming (e.g.  = 0.0 Soft Drop) which risks removing too many
clusters and impairing the substructure discrimination utilised in conventional boson and top
taggers. With this lesson in mind, we shall now summarise the most recent scan which followed
the results outlined thus far. In this new scan, several important developments in Soft Drop
grooming shall be investigated in the context of W boson and top-tagging.
7.4.2 The Updated Inputs and Grooming Scan
7.4.2.1 Tagging Performance
In the most recently published iteration of the jet inputs and grooming scan [131], the two
latest developments in Soft Drop grooming (recursive and bottom-up Soft Drop [120]) have
been included. Now only three jet inputs are considered, based on the performance from the
previous inputs and grooming scan: LCTopo (unmodified), CSSKLCTopo, and VorSuppSKLCTopo.
In recursive Soft Drop, N = 3, and N = 5 iterations are considered. A few of the most promising
Soft Drop, pruned, and trimmed grooming parameter sets are also included in this new scan.
The background jets considered in this latest scan are again the QCD jets from Pythia
8 Monte Carlo. The signal jets are likewise Wjets, obtained by W -filtering the W   WZ
Monte Carlo, and matching reconstruction-level jets to a truth-level W boson within R < 0.75.
For this signal and background, once again a 68 % signal fraction mass window is constructed

around the W boson mass peak, and the D2 variable is scanned in order to generate the ROC
performance curve for this mass + D2 tagger. For different ptrueT ranges the QCD background
rejection factor has been calculated for a fixed signal tagging efficiency of 50 %, where the best
performing jet collections will produce the largest background rejections. These results have
been collected into the new heatmaps displayed in Figure 7.31 for high- and low-ptrueT ranges.
In the lower 300  500 GeV ptrueT range the pileup contributions to the jet masses are more
significant, and therefore notable improvements in the background rejection are observed when
switching to one of the input definitions based on constituent or Voronoi subtraction. Looser
recursive Soft Drop or bottom-up Soft Drop groomers (such as  = 0.5, 1.0) provide marginal
gains over vanilla Soft Drop grooming. At higher transverse momentum, the improvements
from different jet inputs are overshadowed by the groomer choice, and in fact it is clear that
some grooming configuration of a Soft Drop approach, or trimming, offers very good background
rejection, whilst pruning is clearly offering suboptimal performance.
A similar tagging study has been carried out for the top jets signal, obtained from the Z  
tt described in previous chapters in this thesis. The top jets are required to have a minimum
ptrueT of 500 GeV so that the top quark decay products may be fully-contained within the R =
1.0 jet. The reconstructed jet must also be matched to a truth-level top quark within R <
0.75. As with the W tagger, first a 68 % top jet fraction mass peak is constructed using the
smallest possible window around the top mass pole. Following this, the 32 is calculated for the
top jets and different values of 32 are scanned, thus generating a new top-tagging ROC curve.
Recall that lower 32 values correspond to three-prong jet substructures (as would be expected
from the dominant t  Wb decay.) This mass + 32 tagger is inspired by existing cut-based
top-taggers already in use in ATLAS [132]. For a fixed 50 % top signal efficiency, another set
of background rejection factor heatmaps have been generated for two transverse momentum
bins, shown in Figure 7.32. It is interesting to note that, for the top-tagging, the largest gains
in background rejection, at a moderate ptrueT range of 500  1000 GeV, come from the vanilla
Soft Drop grooming, whilst at much higher travserse momentum the background rejection is
poorer across all combinations of inputs and groomers.
In addition to the background rejection, once again the pileup robustness of the jet mass has
been studied for the Wjet signal, and is summarised by the heatmaps in Figure 7.33. Recall

that the most robust jet collections have jet mass-NPV gradients close to 0.0. Once again, for
all jet groomers, the pileup robustness at ptrueT 300  500 GeV is most clearly reduced by using
constituent subtraction or Voronoi subtraction on the LCTopo inputs. At higher transverse
momentum the differences between the various jets are markedly smaller, but there are a few
promising jet definitions which make use of Soft Drop. Notably, excellent pileup robustness is
observed in e.g. fcut = 0.09, Rsub = 0.1 jet trimming, but it must be recalled that this aggressive
grooming will remove substantial jet substructure information and lead to suboptimal tagging
performance.
Based on this second scan, several particularly promising combinations of jet input and
groomer have been calibrated at the JES and JMS, so that their tagging performance can
be studied with biases between reconstruction- and truth-level Monte Carlo minimised. The
ROC curves for the tagging performance of Wjets and top jets (which use the mass + D2
and mass + 32 taggers respectively) are displayed in Figures 7.34 and 7.35. Three different
configurations of CSSKLCTopo zcut = 0.1 vanilla Soft Drop ( = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0), and one of
CSSKLCTopo with standard trimming, are considered. For comparison, the original unmodified
AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets are included in solid black. The jet performance
varies between signal topology and ptrueT range, but general features in the tagging performance
are apparent. In the lowest ptrueT ranges (300  500 GeV for Wjets, and 500  1000 GeV for
top jets) the  = 1.0 Soft Drop jets offer the best tagging performance based on the moderate
grooming provided by  = 1.0 which successfully reduces wide-angle and soft contributions to
the jet without aggressively grooming away the substructure information. At higher ptrueT the
gains from  = 1.0 Soft Drop are less apparent in the W tagger, where there is degeneracy in
performance between Soft Drop and the two trimmed jet definitions. However, in the case of the
top-tagger, the improvements from the  = 1.0 jet collection are still clear across all signal tagging
efficiencies. Such observations make these AntiKt10CSSKLCTopoSoftDropZCut10Beta100 jets
potentially very promising in future boosted physics measurements and searches.
The studies described in this chapter have used the calorimeter jet mass definition. The
more optimal combined mass performance is briefly discussed in Appendix B.

7.4.3 The Future of Large-Radius Jets at ATLAS
In this chapter we have reviewed the standard R = 1.0 jet definition adopted in boosted object
searches and measurements in ATLAS, interesting theoretical developments in pileup mitigation,
jet grooming, and jet substructure, and finally how such breakthroughs can (and have) been
used to construct new large-radius jet collections which have the potential to greatly improve
pileup robustness and boosted object tagging in ATLAS analyses. It is becoming clear that the
standard AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets, which have been the large-radius jet
workhorse of ATLAS in recent years [90], can be improved upon using the latest developments
in Soft Drop jet grooming and constituent subtraction of calorimeter energy deposits. The
recent inputs and grooming studies presented here [123, 131] have brought these developments
into the spotlight of the ATLAS jet physics community, but it is evident that we have merely
scratched the surface. Future improvements, such as the use of particle flow and tracking
information, have the potential to further revolutionise jet physics in colliders. Two particularly
promising developments are the extension of particle flow jet inputs from R = 0.4 to R =
1.0 jets, the use of new tracking-based cluster variables (known as track-calo clusters [124]),
and ultimately the combination of particle flow and track-calo cluster jet definitions. These
advancements, together with the addition of constituent subtraction, SoftKiller, and Soft Drop
grooming, will change the face of jet reconstruction of ATLAS as we enter Run 3 of the
LHC. The work described in this Chapter has been central to future plans for large-radius
jet reconstruction in ATLAS, and work is currently ongoing to finalise these plans so that
new definitions with substantially improved tagging performance and pileup resilence can be
deployed in good time for physics analyses for Run 3 of the LHC. Latest studies indicate that
large-radius jet definitions based on particle flow inputs, together with constituent subtraction
and SoftKiller, with additional Soft Drop (recursive or bottom-up) grooming applied will be
very promising alternatives to the current trimmed definition.
If it disagrees with experiment, its
wrong. In that simple statement is the
key to science.

The Hunt for New Matter in Multi-Jet
Final States
Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final
states
One of the strongest motivations for the construction of the LHC, and the ATLAS experiment,
is to search for new physics and new matter at the high-energy frontier. The LHC has already
proved to be enormously successful, culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson [8,
9] by ATLAS and CMS towards the close of its first run. In parallel to these endeavours,
it has long been hoped that the LHC will provide the necessary energy scale at which new,
heavier, BSM particles might be discovered. In particular it is hoped that the discovery of
supersymmetric particles might be achieved during the LHC run. The final part of this thesis
attempts to synthesise the physics of Part I and Part II: we shall now focus on a search for new
physics, motivated by the theory of supersymmetry, which relies on the principles of hadronic jet
reconstruction to search for new forms of matter in final states where the hadronic jet activity
is complex. We shall refer to this search as the multi-jets analysis; such an analysis has been
one of the benchmark searches for SUSY during Run 1 [134] and Run 2 [70, 71] of the LHC.
We shall focus on the most recent publication of this analysis [70], a search for SUSY using
36 fb1 of ATLAS data, before briefly describing ongoing plans to extend this analysis to the
full Run 2 ATLAS data-set, which has amassed 140 fb1 of integrated luminosity. The full
details of this 140 fb1 analysis shall not be provided in this thesis, but this second piece
of work is very mature, aiming for a publication very soon, and is being lead by the author.
Some details on this ongoing work are provided in Chapter 10. The multi-jets analysis is
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 186
motivated through signatures where gluinos are pair-producted in the LHC proton-proton
collisions, and can undergo long decay cascasdes, generating heavy-flavour quarks and bosons,
and subsequently generating large multiplicities of hadronic jets, which may (or may not) have
moderate EmissT (see Section 4.4.6 for a definition). This feature puts the multi-jets analysis
in at odds with many other searches for SUSY-motivated new physics, which typically rely
on much cleaner final states with large amounts of EmissT generated by the presence of an
undetected, stable, lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). A particularly attractive aspect
of the multi-jets analysis is its sensitivity to a wider variety of new physics models; this shall
be demonstrated in the next chapter, where the results of this search are used to constrain
both R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating SUSY signals.
8.1 Analysis Overview
The basic analysis strategy is to create signal regions from events which contain at least 8, 9, 10,
or 11 AntiKt4EMTopo jets, zero leptons, and moderate EmissT . The jets are also required to have
pT > 50 GeV in all signal regions. These final states are motivated by models of new physics
where the pair production of gluinos can give rise to large jet multiplicities originating from the
decay cascasde of supersymmetric particles; specific models which are used to motivate region
definitions shall be described in Section 8.2. We also require that jets entering signal regions
have a EmissT significance (defined: EmissT /
HT) above 5.0 GeV1/2, where HT comes from the
sum of the jet pTs in the event. This variable is important for reducing the contamination from
standard model multi-jet events in the signal regions, and is indeed the key variable used in
measuring the major multi-jets background arising from QCD SM processes. Further details of
these kinematic variables are provided in Section 8.3.4.
Complex decay cascades provide copious numbers of heavy quarks, giving rise to jets initiated
by botton quarks (referred to as b-jets) and top jets. To enhance sensitivty to such heavy flavour
events, the analysis is further split into two streams: the flavour stream where AntiKt4EMTopo
jets which pass b-tagging requirements [65] are selected; and the fat-jet stream which uses jet
substructure information from large-radius jets to enhance the expected sensitivity to final states
with moderately boosted top jets, as well as reducing the tt background contribution. Another
major challenge of this analysis is the large SM background, originating from both leptonic
activity and the production of SM hadronic QCD multi-jet events. Following the prediction of
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 187
these background contributions, the data are compared with the SM expectations in order to
determine if any statistically significant excess of events is observed, as would be expected from
the presence of additional decay cascades arising from direct gluino production.
Although leptons are explicitly vetoed in the signal regions, it is still very possible that
leptons which are either misidentified as jets, or which fall out of the acceptance of the ATLAS
detector, enter these signal events. Such leptons originate dominantly from the semileptonic
decay of top quarks and W bosons, and it is therefore necessary to estimate the contribtution
to signal regions arising from these semileptonic top and W + jets events. This is done using
dedicated control regions: these are kinematically very close to the signal regions (i.e. they
share the same jet multiplicities) but are rendered orthogonal to them by requiring the presence
of an electron or muon. Monte Carlo estimates of the dominant top and W + jets backgrounds
in these control regions are then scaled to the data measured there using a background-only
fit [135], and the final normalisations extracted are then used to scale the leptonic backgrounds
contaminating the signal regions. This control region approach shall be described in detail in
Section 8.4.
The dominant background QCD cascade decays in the signal regions come from SM multi-jet
processes, which can look near identical to cascade decays originating from heavy, central
SUSY particle production. Monte Carlo simulations of 8, 9, 10, or 11-jet hadronic final states
are not reliable predictions of such backgrounds, and would require immense computational
power to generate a sufficiently large number of events. For these reasons, a fully data-driven
approach must be adopted to estimate this background. This fully data-driven approach
uses dedicated template regions to estimate the fully hadronic QCD jet background in the
signal regions, and is referred to as the template method (originally described in [134]). The
template method shall be outlined in Section 8.5.
8.2 Signal Models
The basic motivation behind simplified models has already been outlined in Section 3.3.2. In this
analysis three simplified models are considered, along with a more complex phenomenological
MSSM parameter space-inspired model [136] (the pMSSM slice). The pMSSM slice, and the
two-step, and gtt simplified models are used to aid the optimisation of kinematic variables and

jet substructure techniques, while the final model, referred to as the RPV stop model, is added
in order to quantify the analysis sensitivity to R-parity-violating SUSY. The full statistical
interpretations of these models shall be described in the next Chapter.
8.2.1 Two-Step Model
The two-step gluino decay model is one of the benchmark strongly-produced SUSY models,
which has been in use since Run 1 of ATLAS [134]. In the first step the gluino undergos a decay,
via a virtual squark, into a pair of first or second generation quarks and the lightest chargino,
1 . Subsequently, the chargino decays to a W boson and the next-to-lighest neutralino, 02.
In the final stage, this 02 decays to a Z boson and the LSP, 01 i.e. the lightest neutralino.
Each step in the decay chain is assumed to have a 100 % branching fraction. The decay
chain can be compactly summarised as:

This model is defined by mass parameters mg and m01 , where m1 =
2(mg + m01) and
m02 =
2(m1 + m01), and the pseudo-Feynman diagram is provided in Figure 8.1a. Such a
model generates large jet multiplicities, where the jets typically originate from light quark
production.
8.2.2 pMSSM Slice
The pMSSM slice is inspired by the results of a large Run 1 scan of the pMSSM parameter
space [136], where it was found that the Run 1 multi-jets analysis is uniquely sensitive to a
class of models where: 1) the gluino has a mass around 1.2 TeV; 2) there is an intermediate
Higgsino-like triplet of SUSY particles; and 3) there exists a bino-like LSP with mass around
60 GeV. The decay spectrum for such a model [136] is shown in Figure 8.2. Based on this
unique portion of phase-space, a new model is generated by varying the gluino and Higgsino
mass parameters and requiring the LSP to be bino-like1, with a corresponding 60 GeV mass.
Additionally, squark and slepton masses are set to 5.0 TeV (so that they are decoupled from
the gluino decay), and tan  is set to 10. These choices are motivated to ensure that the gluino
decays are those which the multi-jets analysis is sensitive to, and that the correct Higgs mass
is recovered. This is not a simplified model, and the decays of the intermediate sparticles
do not have fixed branching fractions. This gives rise to a more varied set of final decays
in the parameter space. Such branching fractions can result in heavy flavour b-jets and top
jets being produced in the final state, as indicated by the pseudo-Feynman diagram for the
slice in Figure 8.1b. The production of additional Z or Higgs bosons is also permitted by the
decays considered in the parameter space this model spans.

Figure 8.2: The typical mass spectrum for the original pMSSM parameter space for which the Run
1 analysis was found to be uniquely sensitive. This spectrum is generated using SoftSUSY [137]
together with the PySLHA software [138].
8.2.3 gtt Model
An additional signal model which this analysis should have sensitivity to is the so-called gtt
model, in which top quark-rich final states are produced by the direct decay of the gluino to tt +
01, via an off-mass-shell top squark. The pseudo-Feynman diagram is shown in Figure 8.1c. The
masses of the gluino and the 01 are varied to form a signal grid, where larger mass splittings
will generate more boosted top jets. In this regime it is possible that the model sensitivity
can be enhanced by using large-radius jets (trimmed or reclustered) and jet substructure
techniques, such as tagging jets based on the jet mass and jet shape variables already described
in Section 7.3. Theses studies shall be outlined in Section 8.3.6.
8.2.4 RPV t  sb Model
So far we have considered R-parity-conserving models, producing a stable LSP which could,
for example, be interpreted as a WIMP dark matter candidate. Many strongly-produced
gluino searches are not sensitive to RPV models, which produce final states without a stable
LSP and therefore with lower EmissT . One of the most powerful features of the multi-jets
search is that it is able retain sensivity to these RPV scenarios, because events with both
low and moderate EmissT can fall into its signal regions. Here we consider an RPV stop model
which starts with a gluino pair decaying through g  t + t. The last step of the decay
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 191
chain contains an RPV baryon-number-violating vertex where the stop LSP decays to heavy-
flavour particles: t  s + b. The signal grid is generated by scanning in mg and mt, and
the pseudo-Feynman diagram is given in Figure 8.1d.
8.3 Analysis Strategy and Physics Objects
ATLAS data for this analysis were collected from April  November, 2015, and April 
November, 2016. The data are amassed from lists of ATLAS runs and luminosity blocks which
pass a rigorous data-quality selection [139]. The final amount of data passing these selections,
set by the ATLAS Data Quality coordination, totals 36.1 fb1 of integrated luminosity to be
used for the multi-jets search.
8.3.1 Trigger
The initial event selection is made from events passing the 5- and 6-jet high-level triggers, where
these triggers take inputs from events which must pass the hardware-based Level-1 trigger,
requiring at least 4 jets with pT > 15 GeV. An OR of two high-level triggers is considered:
HLT_5j70 and HLT_6j45_0eta240; these require either at least 5 or 6 jets, and are close to
fully efficient at pT > 70 GeV or 45 GeV, respectively (and || < 2.4). The efficiencies of these
triggers as a function of the jet pT is shown in Figure 8.3, and it can be seen that the 5-jet
trigger is fully efficient by 85 GeV, and the 6-jet trigger by 70 GeV. Unlike many SUSY searches,
which trigger on EmissT , the multi-jets analysis only accepts events which cause these multi-jet
triggers to fire. This allows us to achieve lower EmissT thresholds than many other SUSY analyses.
As already mentioned, this provides a greater sensitivity to RPV SUSY signatures or other
BSM models which require little or no EmissT in the final state.
8.3.2 Event Selection and Cleaning
Prior to the event selection which defines the analysis control and signal regions, the events
must first pass a set of cleaning cuts and a preliminary selection.
The event cleaning cuts are applied in order to ensure that the events analysed are both
free of detector problems and originate from the proton-proton collisions of the LHC. Only
data runs and luminosity blocks which pass stringent data quality checks are selected as good

runs for users to analyse (the Good Runs Lists). Following this initial quality check, additional
cleaning cuts are designed to veto events which have passed into areas of the detector which
are no longer functioning, such as several inactive Tile calorimeter cells. Additional vetos are
placed to remove muons originating from cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere, to select on good
reconstructed primary vertices and to remove bad jets and leptons, as well as contributions from
pileup in the event. Events with known recorded errors in the SCT, LAr and Tile calorimeters
are also suitably vetoed. The standard event cleaning conditions are summarised in Table 8.1.

Bad jets Reject fake jets originating from non-collision sources, such as
cosmic-ray showers and misreconstruction in the calorimeter. Cut on
the pulse shapes of the calorimeter cell responses and the fraction
of the jet energy in each calorimeter cell to distinguish these

|| < 2.4, and JVT < 0.59 [141].
Bad Tile Cells Reject events which are strongly affect by dead regions of the Tile
calorimeter.
Additional LAr, Tile and SCT errors Events with known errors reported in the LAr, Tile, or SCT
are removed.
Table 8.1: A summary of the event cleaning cuts.
With the cleaning cuts now defined, the flow of data events from detector measurements to
consideration in the multi-jets analysis region definitions (next Section) follows from the logical
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 193
AND of the following steps:
1. Events pass the Good Runs Lists selection.
2. Events pass the multi-jet trigger selection, a local OR of HLT_5j70 and HLT_6j45_0eta240.
3. Events pass event cleaning.
Following this initial set of selections and cleaning cuts, the physics objects which then pass
overlap removal are used to select signal jets, leptons, and photons as described in Section 8.3.3.
8.3.3 Physics Objects Selection
Each event is reconstructed using the standard ATLAS reconstruction techniques described in
Section 4.4, and the reconstruction of the R = 0.4 jets from EMTopo inputs is as described in
Chapter 5. The physics object definitions used in this analysis are summarised in Table 8.2.
Following the initial event selection and cleaning, there are two different sets of physics objects
considered in the reconstruction: baseline and signal. The baseline objects are used to determine
overlap removal decisions and to calculate the EmissT , whilst the signal objects are used in the
final analysis event selections and have additional selection criteria. The basic overlap removal
and object definitions are implemented through the use of a centralised ATLAS software package
which applies the latest physics object definitions and recommendations as prescribed by the
various combined performance groups.
An overlap removal algorithm is applied in order to prevent a particular reconstructed
physics object being used twice in an event by removing it based on geometrical considerations.
Muons and electrons are treated as independent objects, but photons and taus are treated as
jets. The procedure adopted is applied sequentially, as follows:
1. If an electron and a muon share an inner detector track, the electron is removed.
2. If a photon has a R(photon, electron) or R(photon, muon) < 0.4, then it is removed.
3. Any jet which fails the loose b-tagging (80 % efficiency working point) selection is removed if:
 R(jet, electron) < 0.2; or
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 194
 the jet has no more than three tracks with pT > 500 MeV, or contains an inner detector
track matched to a muon such that the transverse momentum of the jet is less than the
muon and the muon track has more than 70 % of the sum of the transverse momenta of
all tracks in the jet.
4. If R(jet, electron (muon)) < 0.4, using the jets which survive requirement 3, then the
electron (muon) is removed.
5. If R(jet, photon) < 0.4, then the photon is removed.

Table 8.2: A summary of the basic physics objects used in the multi-jets analysis, together with their
baseline and signal selections. Signal and baseline electrons, muons, and jets are used; additionally
baseline photons are used in the overlap removal and EmissT calculation.
In addition, large-radius R = 1.0 jets are also constructed by reclustering all R = 0.4 jets in
the event, according to the procedure outlined in Section 5.3.2.2. b-jets are also considered, and
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 195
these are defined as signal jets which have also been identified with the MV2C10 algorithm [65],
which uses a multi-variate discriminant to identify jets which contain a B-hadron, and is designed
to give a b-jet selection efficiency of 70 % in simulated tt events.
8.3.4 Kinematic Variables
Following the physics object reconstruction, the signal objects are used in the calculation of
important kinematic variables which help to define the final regions of the analysis. There are
four variables which are of particular interest.
HT: the scalar sum of the pT of all R = 0.4 jets in the event with pT > 40 GeV and || < 2.8:2
T . (8.3)
In the leptonic control regions (formally defined in Section 8.3.5), leptons which meet the
same kinematic criteria as the jets are also used in the calculation of HT.
EmissT /
HT: this is referred to in this analysis as the EmissT significance of the event, and is
used to define the signal and control regions, and to estimate the data-driven QCD multi-jets
background. The power of this variable rests on the observation that its shape is approximately
invariant under any changes in the jet multiplicity, in events where the EmissT is dominated by jet
mismeasurements (as would be the case for high jet multiplicity, multi-jet events3). This variable
provides a metric for how much of the EmissT measured in an event is dominated by sources
of real EmissT (such as neutrinos or neutralinos) and sources of fake EmissT (jet mismeasurement
in the calorimeter): larger values of the EmissT significance are expected from events which are
dominated by real soures of EmissT . This feature of the EmissT significance will be important for
defining the analysis signal regions in Section 8.3.5. This definition of EmissT significance is not
the true significance, which should be a dimensionless quantity, but we can start from this
true significance in order to better understand the invarance of the E
shape. Assuming a
Gaussian EmissT resolution, (EmissT ), the true significance is a monotonic function of
(EmissT )2
2(EmissT )2
. (8.4)
2This selection is based on studies carried out in the Run 1 version of this analysis [134].
3See Appendix C for the full set of analysis EmissT /
HT plots.
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 196
We are interested in scenarios where the EmissT is dominated by jet mismeasurement, and
therefore the dominant component of the (EmissT ) comes from the jet resolution:
(EmissT )
(pjetT )
2. (8.5)
The jet resolution is obtained from the calorimeter energy resolution, and therefore can
be approximated by (pjetT ) 
T over a wide range of calorimeter energies. Recalling
the definition of HT, it now follows that
(EmissT )
2  HT. (8.6)
Inserting this result into our original expression for the (Gaussian) true significance, we
see that such a true significance may be approximated as a function of
(EmissT )2
, (8.7)
which is equivalent to the definition E
which we started out with.
mT: this transverse mass variable is used when defining the leptonic control regions, and
is calculated from the lepton pT (plT), the EmissT , and the -angle between the EmissT and the
lepton, (EmissT , plT). It is defined as:
2plTEmissT
1 cos((EmissT , plT))
. (8.8)
If a parent particle, P , undergos a decay into visible and invisible daughters, then the mT
distribution has a kinematic end-point at the rest mass of P . This makes mT effective at
reducing signal contamination in the control regions by requiring some upper value, mT < x
GeV. Since typical new physics particles will have larger mT-values than SM particles.
MJ : this event-level jet mass is the total mass of all R = 1.0 (reclustered) jets in the event
with pT > 100 GeV and || < 1.5, and is defined as [145]:
MJ =
mR = 1.0j . (8.9)
This variable is designed to be sensitive to the production of heavy flavour background,
larger gluino masses, and to also work as a discriminating variable to reject tt backgrounds.
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 197
8.3.5 Region Definitions
The kinematic regions of interest are split into four categories: signal, control, template, and
validation regions. The signal regions are designed to be rich in signal events, whilst having
a much smaller contribution coming from Standard Model processes. The control regions are
designed to be dominated by events coming from specific backgrounds, typically the largest
Monte Carlo simulated backgrounds in the analysis, so that the Monte Carlo predictions for
such backgrounds can be tested and appropriately normalised to match the data. Both the
template and validation regions are designed to be dominated by the largest background in the
analysis, that of Standard Model multi-jet production. Template regions are used to measure
the SM multi-jet contribution in data, and therefore predict the size of this background in
the signal regions, whilst the validation regions assess how well the multi-jet prediction closes
with respect to the data, and also provides a measure of the uncertainties associated with the
estimate of the multi-jet background from the template region. Let us briefly motivate the
kinematic requirements in each of these regions.
Signal regions: Signal regions veto events which contain at least one electron or muon; such
leptons may be produced with neutrinos, generating sources of real EmissT , which would otherwise
contaminate the signal region. In order to be sensitivie to signals which do produce real EmissT ,
such as through the LSP production, a requirement of EmissT /
HT > 5 GeV1/2 is imposed. This
also serves to remove multi-jet events where the jets have been mismeasured in the calorimeter,
generating fake EmissT . The long decay chains associated with the signal models produces final
states with typically 7 or more hadronic jets, so we also require that there be at least 7, 8, 9, 10,
or 11 jets in the final state. The signal regions are further subdivided into flavour and fat-jet
streams. In the flavour stream, final states containing at least 0, 1, or 2 b-jets are considered in
order to be sensitive to the b-jets which can be produced in these long decay cascades; in the
fat-jet stream, the MJ variable is calculated from R = 1.0 jets (reclustered from the 7 or more
R = 0.4 jets) in the event, and two regions are constructed for each jet multiplicity, requiring
MJ > 340 GeV or > 500 GeV. Such regions enhance the sensitivity to heavy flavour final states,
such as top quark production, and the production of heavier gluinos. Jets in the flavour stream
are required to have a threshold of pT > 50 GeV or 80 GeV, where the 5-jet and 6-jet triggers
which fire on the events are close to fully-efficient. Jets in the fat-jet stream are required to
pass a pT > 50 GeV threshold. For the pT > 50 GeV, jet multiplcities of at least 8, 9, 10, or 11

are considered; for the 6-jet pT > 80 GeV regions, multiplicities of at least 7, 8, or 9 jets are
considered. In the flavour stream, the combination of 4 pT > 50 GeV regions and 3 pT > 80
GeV regions, each with 0, 1, or 2 inclusive b-jets, totals to 21 signal regions. The inclusive 8, 9,
and 10 pT > 50 GeV regions in the fat-jet stream, each with a 340 or 500 GeV requirements
on MJ , adds an additional 6 signal regions, bringing the total up to 27. These selections are
summarised in Table 8.3.
Control regions: Control regions are designed to be kinematically similar to signal regions, yet
orthogonal in order to be rich in backgrounds and comparitively sparse in signal contamination.
Orthogonality is achieved by requiring exactly one electron or muon in the event. To reduce
statistical uncertainties, an inclusive Njets-jet signal region is controlled by an inclusive (Njets 
1) jet control region. Similarly the requirement on EmissT /
HT is also relaxed in order to increase
the available statistics. There are two control regions for each signal region: the first with a b-jet
veto applied, enhancing the contribution of W + jets backgrounds, and the second requiring
at least a single b-jet in the event, enriching the region with tt background. The same signal
region pT thresholds also apply to the control regions. Leptons are also included as jets, for the
purposes of selection, if they pass the same pT and || requirements as the jets in the event, in
order to model the effects (on kinematic variables) of hadronic taus and jets being misidentified
as leptons. Finally, mT < 120 GeV is also required in order to remove contributions from signal
processes; this variable has a kinematic endpoint around mW for leptonically-decaying W s, but
has no such bound when the lepton and EmissT originate from different decays. The control
regions are summarised in Table 8.4, and the different EmissT /
HT thresholds are indicated in
Table 8.5. In the control regions with higher jet multiplicities, this threshold is lowered in order

to increase the available statistics.
Template and validation regions: To extract a viable measurement of the shape of the
multi-jet background a template region is defined. The signal regions associated with the pT
> 80 GeV threshold have corresponding template regions where exactly 5 jets and 0 leptons
are required; the pT > 50 GeV signal regions have a corresponding 6 exclusive jet, 0 lepton
template region. After extracting the multi-jet shape in these 5- and 6-jet template regions,
the prediction (based on these template shapes) is tested in exclusive 6-jet and 7-jet validation
regions respetively. We shall describe these regions, and the template background estimation
procedure, in more detail in Section 8.5.
A shorthand notation is adopted for labelling the different regions in this analysis: first
a SR-, CR-, TR-, or VR- is prepended for a signal, control, template, or validation region
respectively. Following this, a piece is added of the form <multiplicity><i/e><threshold>,
where <multiplicity> refers to the jet multiplicity, the i or e denote whether the jet
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 200
multiplicity selection is inclusive or exclusive, and the <threshold> corresponds to the jet
pT threshold of 50 or 80 GeV. The final component is stream specific: for the flavour stream,
<multiplicity><i/e>b is appended, where the <multiplicity> corresponds to the b-jets in
the event. For the fat-jet stream, MJ<threshold> is appended to correspond to the two MJ
thresholds at 340 and 500 GeV. So for example, SR-9ij50-0ib-MJ340 corresponds to a signal
region with at least 9 jets, each with pT > 50 GeV, at least 0 b-jets in the event, and MJ >
340 GeV. Or in the flavour stream, SR-8ij80-2ib corresponds to a signal region with at least
8 jets, with pT > 80 GeV, and at least two b-tagged jets in the event.
8.3.6 Jet Reclustering and Jet Substructure for Top-Tagging
Models such as the gtt produce final states with top quarks, where the mass-splitting between
the LSP and the gluino can be large, resulting in boosted top production. Such boosted heavy
flavour could be captured using large-radius jets, and the substructure information gleaned from
these jets could be utilised to make a heavy-flavour tagger. In the multi-jets analysis large-radius
jets have been investigated in order to tag heavy-flavour production. Two approaches have been
considered:
 Fat-jet stream: here the R = 0.4 jets are reclustered into R = 1.0 jets, and the total mass of
the reclustered jets in the event is used to increase the sensitivity to the production of heavy
flavour, such as top jets. The MJ variable has already been described in Section 8.3.4.
 Substructure top-tagging: here LCTopo trimmed R = 1.0 jets are reconstructed in the
multi-jet events, and the mass and 32 substructure variables are used to construct a
top-tagger and identify top quarks produced in gtt-like scenarios.
As has already been stated, the final analysis uses the fat-jet stream approach in order to
increase sensitivity to heavy flavour production, but this was only fully adopted after performing
a direct comparison of the expected sensitivity to gtt signals obtained from the substructure
top-tagger. For completeness, this sensitivity study shall now be briefly summarised.
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 201
8.3.6.1 Top-Tagging in Multi-Jets
The approach of top-tagging described below is an expolaratory study carried out by the author,
and, although it was not used in the final analysis, it was important in establishing the power
of event-level variables in searches for new physics.
Top-tagging using jet-level substructure methods has been investigated substantially during
Run 1 and Run 2 of ATLAS [132]. There are several different approaches to top-tagging within
and outside of ATLAS, ranging from sophisticated machine-learning and Boosted Decision Tree
taggers [146], to simpler taggers which select top-like candidates from a selection based on a
few jet substructure variables. The latter are often referred to as cut-based taggers [132]. For
the multi-jets analysis, it is necessary for the tagging efficiency to be high (70 % or higher)
in order to preserve as much of the SUSY signal as possible, and consequently sophisticated
machine-learning taggers are not a feasible option due to their low signal efficiency (40  50
% [132, 146]). This motivates the use of a simple, cut-based tagger which allows for the higher
tagging efficiencies, at the cost of inferior background rejection.
For these studies a standard cut-based ATLAS top-tagger is adopted [132]. When given an
input jet collection, this tagger selects each jet and uses the jet pT in a lookup table which, for
a given jet pT, identifies the optimum cuts on the jet mass and jet 32 (see Section 7.3 for the
definition), which give the best background rejection for some fixed tagging efficiency provided
by the user. An 80 % tagging efficiency working point is considered in these studies.
Figure 8.4 shows the correlation between jet mass and 32, and also the jet mass and
pT, before and after the standard top-tagger is applied to a sample gtt signal point, where
LCTopo inputs have been reconstructed into AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 jets.
The tagging has the expected effect of preserving jets which occupy the peak about the lower
32-value, whilst removing those which occupy the much higher 32 peak. For larger values of pT
the tagger also correctly keeps jets which have an invariant mass around that of the top quark
mass.

and after top-tagging. A gtt simulated signal point is considered. The large reduction in jets can be

8.3.6.2 Expected Sensitivities from Top-Tagging and MJ
For the final sensitivity studies, the expected signal significance4 is calculated for several
different gtt signal mass points, assuming a dominating tt and QCD multi-jets background. New
top-tagged signal region definitions have been constructed from the observation of reasonable
discrimination between signal and background for final states with approximately 3 or more
top-tagged jets.
4The contours correspond to values where the signal Z significance (X
) is equal to 1.64, where it is assumed
that the data yield matches the simulated SM prediction.

Figure 8.5: The expected significance for 8ij50-0/1/2ib-0/1/2/3it for the gtt model and the
expected significance for the 8ij50-0ib-MJ340 region.
The impact of the top-tagging on the sensitivity to the gluino and LSP mass is quantified
by first defining additional regions where there are top-tagged large-R jets. Four regions are
considered: 0it, 1it, 2it, and 3it for 0, 1, 2, 3 inclusive top-tagged large-R jets respectively.
A final summary of the expected signal sensitivity from top-tagging is presented in Figures 8.5
for a region where at least 8 small-radius jets with pT > 50 GeV, and zero leptons, is required.
Similar behaviour is observed in regions with other large jet multiplicities. These plots should be
compared with the expected sensitivity to the same gtt signal grid point achieved by applying
jet reclustering and the MJ cuts described in Section 8.3.4 . This is also shown in Figure 8.5,
again with the usual requirement of zero leptons and at least 8 small-radius jets in the final state.
Comparing the different sensitivities obtained from top-tagging demonstrates that a very
similar reach is obtained from the separate top-tagging and MJ selections, where the latter
approach provides a greater sensitivity to larger gluino masses. This is an interesting and

important lesson for searches targeting strongly-produced SUSY scenarios. Techniques such as
top-tagging, which use substructure variables applied to individual jets, perform best for searches
which target final states where the jets are highly boosted and the final state structure is simple,
typically consisting of 1 or 2 jets, and perhaps a lepton. Such final states are typical among
ATLAS exotics searches, where conventional top-tagging is utilised frequently. This is not the
case for the models of SUSY considered in the multi-jets analysis; here the final states contain
many jets, and therefore, for the same collision energy, the average jet momentum is lower and the
jet consequently less boosted. For these less boosted jets a better variable to use is not a jet-level
one, but an event-level variable. For example, theMJ , which is the event-level jet mass, is seen to
be more sensitive to the (moderately) boosted gtt gluinos than the jet-by-jet N -subjettiness and
mass variables of the top-tagger. The MJ variable encodes information about the mass of the
entire event, and this acts as an effective proxy for heavy flavour production, which is typically
massive, but not necessarily strongly boosted. Such event-level information therefore gives MJ ,
and similar variables, an advantage over conventional jet-level substructure information.
8.4 Leptonic Background Estimation
Standard Model processes which produce multi-jet events with one or more leptons are catagorised
as leptonic backgrounds. Although a lepton veto is applied to the signal regions, it is still
possible for leptonic backgrounds to contaminate them. The lepton veto only applies to
electrons and muons, hence hadronically decaying tau leptons (originating from top or W
bosons) contribute. Hadronically decaying taus are treated as jets, and the real EmissT from
the associated neutrino will also enter the signal regions. Additionally, there are cases where
the electons or muons may fall out of the detector acceptance, or be misreconstructed in the
detector, generating more EmissT . Finally, it is also possible for EmissT originating from the Z
  decay to enter our signal regions. With these effects established, it is important to
estimate the contamination of leptonic backgrounds in the signal region; this is achieved through
Monte Carlo simulation of such backgrounds. The two dominating Monte Carlo backgrounds
are leptonically and semileptonically decaying tt, and leptonically-decaying W bosons which
are produced in association with jets (referred to as the W + jets background). Smaller
backgrounds include the production of leptonically-decaying Z bosons and associated jets (Z +
jets), single top production, diboson production of WW , WZ, or ZZ, and the production of
tt in association with heavier particles  this final background covers the three-top, four-top,
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 205
tt + W , tt + Z, tt + H, and tt + WW topologies, and is collectively referred to as ttX.
These additional backgrounds are comparatively very small and are estimated in the signal
regions through Monte Carlo simulation alone.

These leptonic backgrounds, and their associated Monte Carlo generators, are summarised
in Tables 8.6 and 8.7. For all background simulations, the ATLAS detector response is modelled
using the full simulation of GEANT 4 [112] (a fast simulation [148], based on a simpler
parameterisation of the ATLAS electromagnteic and hadronic calorimeter, is used to model
the signal). Leptonic tt and single top are simulated using Powheg [149] interfaced to
Pythia 6.428 [150] for partonic showering. The production of W/Z + jets, and dibosons, is
modelled using Sherpa 2.2.1 and Sherpa 2.1 [95] respectively. With one exception, the ttX
backgrounds are simulated using MadGraph 5 v.2.2.2 [116] interfaced with Pythia 8.186 [113,
115] for the parton shower; ttH is instead simulated using MadGraph 5_aMC@NLO
v.2.2.3 [116], again interfaced with Pythia 8.186. In additional, the Monte Carlo events
are reweighted in order to account for:
 Differences between the pileup distributions as measured in ATLAS data and the expected
pileup profile simulated in the Monte Carlo.
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 206
 Differences between the efficiencies of b-jets, electrons, and muons measured in data to
those simulated in Monte Carlo [65].
The contributions from the two largest leptonic backgrounds are first estimated using Monte
Carlo events in the dedicated tt and W + jets control regions defined in Section 8.3.5 and
Table 8.4. A global fit of the simulated backgrounds to data is carried out in these control
regions (see Section 9.1.1 for details) in order to obtain normalisation factors which are applied
to the leptonic backgrounds in the signal regions to improve the background prediction there.
The control regions must be rich in the two largest leptonic backgrounds in order for the
normalisations from the fit to be derived with a good statistical precision. Each signal region is
controlled by two control regions according to the nomenclature outlined in Section 8.3.5. For
example, the SR-8ij50-0ib region is controlled by the CR1l-7ij50-0eb and CR1l-7ij50-1ib
for W + jets and tt backgrounds respectively. The distributions of the number of jets in these
two control regions is shown in Figure 8.6 after the application of the normalisations from the
fit to data. The two largest simulated backgrounds can be clearly seen (blue corresponds to W
+ jets, green to tt), and the uncertainties shown are statistical. The agreement between data
and Monte Carlo, post-fit, is very good and provides confidence in our approach of extracting
background estimates in such kinematic regions of phase-space. It should be noted that the
final normalisations which are derived incorporate the effects of theoretical, statistical, and
systematic uncertainties. The treatment of these uncertainties is described in Section 8.6.
8.5 QCD Multi-Jet Background Estimation
The dominant background in this analysis comes from Standard Model QCD multi-jets events.
It would be expected that such final states would have little or no EmissT , however detector
resolution effects can lead to mismeasurement of the jets, generating sources of fake EmissT . Due
to a lack of reliable Monte Carlo for simulating such high jet multiplicity final states, a full
data-driven approach must be adopted, which we shall refer to as the template method.
The template method is an ABCD approach, where the EmissT /
HT distribution is used to
extract the background estimate. Let us first define a template region which corresponds to a
EmissT /
HT distribution which is fully measured in data. Two template regions are considered
in order to estimate the multi-jets background in the pT > 50 GeV and pT > 80 GeV signal

additional kinematic cuts which depend on the particular signal region of interest. An example
template region is shown in Figure 8.7 and corresponds to TR-6ej50-0ib i.e. exactly 6 jets, with
pT > 50 GeV, and 0 inclusive b-tagged jets in the event. The various Monte Carlo backgrounds
are overlaid, together with the data (dark circles), and the large orange contribution comes from
the QCD multi-jets background is also fully measured in data here. The two largest Monte
Carlo backgrounds, semileptonic tt and W + jets, are normalised according to a background-
only fit. The peak at lower EmissT /
HT is dominated by the fake EmissT contributions from jet
mismeasurement in the calorimeter and leads to the large population of QCD multi-jets events.
At the heart of the template method is the approximate invariance of the shape of the
EmissT /
HT distribution as the jet multiplicity changes, which was justified in Section 8.3.4.
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 209
In the template region, the shape and event yield is measured at EmissT /
HT < 1.5 GeV1/2,
where the multi-jets background dominates, and at EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2, which is the
same EmissT /
HT cut used to define the signal regions. The EmissT /
HT distribution is then
considered for one of the signal regions, which is blinded at EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2. The
shape and yield of events at EmissT /
HT < 1.5 GeV1/2 is then extracted in that region in order
to obtain a normalisation to the shape measured in the original template region. Denoting the
yields in the < 1.5 GeV1/2 and > 5.0 GeV1/2 by NA and NC for the template region, and NB
and ND for the signal regions, the invariance of the significance shape implies that NCNA =
holds, and therefore the multi-jet background estimate in the signal region is determined from:
ND = NB
. (8.10)
Before using this technique to estimate the multi-jet background in a signal region, it is
first necessary to check that the prediction matches the data well, and this is achieved by
testing the template prediction in validation regions. Predictions extracted from the TR-6ej50-*
and TR-5ej80-* templates are validated in the VR-7ej50-* and VR-6ej80-* EmissT /
HT  1.5
GeV1/2 regions respectively, and also in the 1.5 GeV1/2  EmissT /
HT < 5.0 GeV1/2 region of the
signal region under consideration. As a concrete example, the template method is illustrated
for the SR-8ij50-0ib and SR-7ij80-0ib regions in the schematic in Figure 8.8, showing the
relationship between the template, validation, and signal regions in EmissT /
HT  jet multiplicity
space.
For the case of SR-8ij50-0ib, the event yield is measured in the TR-6ej50-0ib EmissT /
< 1.5 GeV1/2 to be Ndata6j (1.5) and in the EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2 to be Ndata6j (5.0). This is
directly measured from data and will therefore include all backgrounds; the total Monte Carlo
background estimates in these regions are denoted NMC6j (1.5) and NMC6j (5.0). The background
estimate is now tested in the VR-7ej50-0ib region, using a normalisation derived from the
events with EmissT /
HT < 1.5 GeV1/2, which shall be similarly denoted Ndata7j (1.5). Again the
yield from the Monte Carlo-only background is NMC7j (1.5). Putting this together, the estimate
of the multi-jet background in the validation region is:

The EmissT /

observed to close well with respect to the data, and is entirely covered within the statistical and
systematic uncertainties (to be evaluated shortly).
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 212
Before finishing with the template method, one final detail needs to be addressed. It has
been measured that the HT in the event is correlated with the jet multiplicity [134]: events with
a larger jet multiplicity should, on average, posses a larger measured HT. Consequently there
will always be some EmissT /
HT-dependence on jet multiplicity, despite the initial assumption
of the invariance of its shape between different regions, However, it is possible to reduce this
dependence by binning the template region in HT, where lower bin boundaries of 0, 600, 900,
and 1200 GeV have been found to be sufficient to remove the dependence of the template region
shape on HT. Another important factor affecting the shape of the template is the relative
composition of heavy-flavour (such as b-quark initiated) jets in the final state. This effect is
accounted for by assessing the flavour-dependence of the template method as a systematic
uncertainly, and shall be discussed in detail in Section 8.6.3.
8.6 Treatment of Uncertainties
In addition to the statistical uncertainties there are also several sources of systematic uncertainty
which need to be considered. The systematic uncertainties are divided in three classes: detector,
theory, and the template systematics. The detector systematics are applied to the Monte
Carlo backgrounds and arise from the detector simulation and physics object reconstruction
effects on such backgrounds. The theory systematics are also applied to the Monte Carlo
backgrounds and arise from differences between Monte Carlo generators, partonic showering,
and radiation effects when simulating different backgrounds. Finally, the template method
itself comes with its own set of systematic uncertainies, which are applied to the background
prediction from this same method. These include uncertainties due to the non-closure of the
template prediction with respect to data, the flavour-dependence of the template, and the choice
of HT-binning in the template calculation. These systematics enter into the fitting procedure
(to be described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.2.1) as Gaussian constraints with widths calculated
from the variation of the nominal yield with the systematic of interest.
8.6.1 Detector Systematics
The detector systematics describe the uncertainties, applied to Monte Carlo only, which
incorporate the effects of detector simulation and physics object reconstruction. Dominating
detector systematics come from: uncertainties on b-tagging in the flavour stream signal regions,
accounting for up to 4 % in some regions; uncertainties due to the measurement of the jet
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 213
energy scale and jet energy resolution, varying from 6  12 % in certain signal regions; and an
uncertainty in the simulation of the soft term of the EmissT , which has an effect of up to 8 % in
the fat-jet stream. Additional uncertainties, such as those on the detector luminosity of the
recorded data-set, are small (< 1 %). Briefly, the full list of detector systematics corresponds to
the following:
Jet energy scale: The jet energy scale calibration, described in Chapter 5, corrects the energy
of a jet, measured in both data and reconstruction-level Monte Carlo, to the energy of the
original parton. Uncertainties due to differences in Monte Carlo modelling of the calibration,
the physical modelling of different processes, and the jet flavour, trigger inefficiences, and pileup
effects on calibrated data collectively give rise to 73 nuisance parameters. The correlations
between these parameters can be reduced to produce a final set of 4 nuisance parameters [151],
which are then varied independently in the final fit.
Jet energy resolution: The spread of the reconstructed jet energies, as measured in the
detector, around the true values is characterised by the jet energy resolution. A single nuisance
paramter is assigned for this uncertainty, which is evaluated by smearing the jet energies with a
Gaussian function, where the width of the Gaussian is characterised by the difference between
the energy resolution measured in data and measured in Monte Carlo.
b tagging: b-tagging scale factors account for differences in the b-tagging efficiencies between
data and Monte Carlo, and these differences come with associated uncertainties [152]. These
scale factor uncertainties are propagated through the final fit. The procedure of b-tagging in
ATLAS is briefly described in Section 4.4.4.
EmissT soft term: The soft component of the EmissT has uncertainties associated with its scale
and resolution. Up and down variations on the EmissT scale, and the smearing of the soft term
in order to account for the differences between data and Monte Carlo, are used to assess the
magnitude of this uncertainty.
Electron and photon energy scale, and resolution: Two nuisance parameters are applied
to cover these uncertainties: the first covers the scale uncertainty on the electron and photon
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 214
response, and the second covers the total resolution uncertainty. Effects of correlations between
uncertainties are neglected.
Electron selection efficiency: Uncertainties arising from electron reconstruction, identifica-
tion, and isolation selections are accounted for by varying the electron scale factors.
Muon energy scale and resolution: A single set of up and down variables covers the
uncertainty on the absolute muon energy scale, which again quantifies the difference between
the energy as measured in data and Monte Carlo. The tracks in the inner detector and muon
spectrometer are also independently varied according to the resolutions of those detectors; the
effects of this on the combined track measurement is calculated in order to account for the
resolution uncertainties.
Muon selection efficiency: Additional muon scale factors are varied to account for the
uncertainty on their measurements and selections, and the statistical and systematic components
of this uncertainty are treated separately.
Pileup reweighting: The pileup reweighting scale factor, used to correct the Monte Carlo
pileup distribution to its measurement in data, is varied upwards and downwards in order to
account for the uncertainties on the overlaid pileup distribution in the Monte Carlo.
8.6.2 Theory Systematics
The theory systematics assess the uncertainties coming from the matrix element generation and
the subsequent showering and decay of the initial particles produced in the matrix element, as
well as additional uncertainties coming from radiative emissions of the decaying particles. It was
found that the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from the simulation of QCD radiation from
the top quarks in tt events, amounting to an uncertainty of up to 25 % of the total tt background
prediction. The uncertainties due to partonic showering and additional radiative effects were
found to be smaller (or comparable) in size. The calculation of the theory systematics is split
into three major Monte Carlo backgrounds: tt, W + jets (the largest backgrounds), and the
remaining minor backgrounds for which theory systematics were not explictly calculated but
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 215
rather global, conservative estimates are applied.
Leptonic and semileptonic tt: Uncertainties from the generation of the matrix element are
assessed by comparing the predictions from two different generators; the nominal sample is
produced using Powheg for the matrix element generation, and Pythia 6.428 for the partonic
showering. A sample using MadGraph 5_aMC@NLO in place of Powheg provides the
variation for the matrix element generation uncertainty. Additionally, alternative samples using
Pythia 8.186 and Herwig++ [97] in place of Pythia 6.428 provide the variation for the
partonic showering uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty arising from radiative emissions (i.e.
gluon emissions above and below the nominal expected rates) are investigated using two variants
of the nominal Monte Carlo settings which increase/decrease the rate of QCD radiation overlaid
on the base physics process; these are referred to as RadHi and RadLo respectively.
W + jets: The W + jets backgrounds are generated using Sherpa 2.2.1 and come with their
own set of Monte Carlo weights which correspond to different variations of the Monte Carlo
renormalisation, factorisation, resummation, and matching scales [153]. The renormalisation and
factorisation scales, R and F respectively, set the energy scales for truncating the calculation
of the matrix element coupling constant and parton distribution functions [154], such that diver-
gences are factored out. These scales are varied according to the following sets of configurations:
{R, F} = {0.5, 0.5}, {0.5, 1.0}, {1.0, 0.5}, {1.0, 1.0}, {1.0, 2.0}, {2.0, 1.0}, {2.0, 2.0}, (8.13)
where {x, y} refers to a varying the R and F scales by factors of x and y of the nominal
scales. The resummation scale corresponds to the scale at which the calculation of the parton
shower is truncated, and the matching scale sets the energy at which a given emission is treated
as part of the matrix element or as part of the partonic shower. In order to determine the
variations which generate the final Monte Carlo weights, these scales are varied between 1/
2 of the magnitude of the nominal scale.
Minor backgrounds: The remaining backgrounds predict comparatively small numbers
of events in the signal regions, as such they do not require a detailed calculation of the-
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 216
ortical uncertainties. Rather, global and conservative uncertainties5 on each of these mi-
nor backgrounds are applied:
 Z + jets: 40 %
 diboson: 50 %
 single top: 30 %
 ttX: 30 %
8.6.3 Template Systematics
The three uncertainties contributing to the total template systematic originate from the non-
closure of the template prediction with respect to data, the flavour-dependence of the template
arising from the semileptonic decays of B hadrons, and the effects of HT binning on the template.
8.6.3.1 Template non-closure uncertainty
The largest systematic uncertainty on the template prediction arises from its non-closure: the
degree to which the prediction deviates from data in regions where little signal is expected. To
quantify this non-closure, the differences between the prediction and data are assessed in a series
of validation regions. The closure of the prediction is checked against the number of observed
events in regions with EmissT /
HT  (1.5, 2.0), (2.0, 2.5), and (2.5, 3.5) GeV1/2, for  8,  9,
and  10 jet regions; it is also checked in the EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2 exclusive 7-jet validation
region. The closure is defined as the difference between the total background prediction and the
observed number of events in data in each region. For a given signal region the symmetrical
systematic uncertainty applied is the maximal deviation in any of the closure regions of the
same jet multiplicity or lower, for the same MJ and/or b-jet requirement. The non-closure is
therefore evaluated separately for each of the different b-jet multiplicities and jet pT thresholds
in the flavour stream, and separately for the two different MJ thresholds in the fat-jet stream.
Example degrees of non-closure of the total background estimation is provided in Figure 8.10
for the 0ib regions in the pT > 50 GeV and pT > 80 GeV threshold flavour stream, and the MJ
> 340 GeV in the fat-jet stream. Across the different signal regions, the non-closure uncertainty
varies from 7.40 % to 29.70 %, and is generally larger in regions with high inclusive jet multiplicity.
5These uncertainty estimates are based on Run 1 studies [134].

8.6.3.2 Template flavour uncertainty
The usual approach to building the template region requires no selection on the number of
b-jets. However, events with b-jets are more likely to have real EmissT due to the semileptonic
decays of B-hadrons, which would have the effect of broadening the EmissT /
HT distribution.
As this broadening is not accounted for in the template estimation, it is necessary to derive an
uncertainty which covers its impact on the EmissT /
HT distribution.
In order to evaluate the size of this effect on the template prediction two separate template
regions are constructed (let us take the example of the template prediction for the pT > 50
GeV regions): the first from a selection requiring exactly 6 jets and no b-jets (6ej50-0eb),
and the second from a selection requiring exactly 6 jets and at least 1 b-jet (6ej50-1ib). A
similar procedure is applied to the 5-jet template used when considering the pT > 80 GeV
multi-jet prediction. These two contributions are added to give a flavour-split yield, Fs, the
total yield from the template prediction and the leptonic backgrounds. This Fs estimate is
then added in a linear combination with the same yield expected from the original (0ib)
flavour-blind template, Fb:
T = fFb + (1 f)Fs, (8.14)
where f is constrained to lie between 0 and 1. In fact, because there are three b-jet
multiplicities considered in this analysis, it is necessary to construct three different types of
flavour-blind and flavour-split templates:
 0ib flavour-blind, 0eb + 1ib flavour-split (as above).
 1ib flavour-blind, 1eb + 2ib flavour-split.
 2ib flavour-blind, 2eb + 3ib flavour-split.
Independently for each b-jet multiplicity, this background estimate T calculation is per-
formed in the same validation regions used to assess the template non-closure uncertainty. In
each of these regions, the optimal f value is determined through a 2 minimisation with
respect to the E observed data:

where  is the sum in quadrature of the statistical uncertainties in the data and total
background prediction. The uncertainty on f is determined by varying f until the agreement
in the validation regions has deteriorated sufficiently to create an increase in the 2 of the
data  prediction comparison of 1. Equivalently, f comes from the change in f necessary
to modify each minimum 2-value by the amount  2 = 1. Once the optimum f value has
been determined in the validation region corresponding to a given signal region, the systematic
uncertainty in the EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2 signal region is evaluated as the difference between
the mixed template and the flavour-blind template, i.e. T (optimum f)  T (f = 1). This
systematic is generally subdominant compared to the non-closure systematic, and is typically
largest in the higher jet multiplicity, higher b-jet multiplicity signal regions: the per signal
region uncertainty varies from < 1 % to 19.10 %.
8.6.3.3 Template HT binning uncertainty
As already stated, the template estimate is binned in HT in order to factorise out low-HT effects
which distort the EmissT resolution, other than jet mismeasurement. The choice of HT binning
is based on the quality of the closure of the template, and a good choice is found to be HT
= (0, 600), (600, 900), (900, 1200), (1200, ) GeV. An alternative binning of (0, 600), (600,
800), (800, 1000), (1000, 1200), (1200, 1400), (1400, ) GeV is considered, and the difference
between the two predictions is taken as a (small) systematic uncertainty. This difference is
evaluated across all valdiation and signal regions and is found to amount to typically no more
than a couple of %, smaller than the non-closure and flavour-dependence systematics.
8.6.4 Systematics Summary
Before moving to the unblinded results in the next Chapter, we close by presenting the summary
of the various systematics considered across the different analysis signal regions, shown in
Figure 8.11. The uncertainties are split into the statistical, theory, experimental (detector), and
template components. The theoretical uncertainties tend to dominate the total uncertainty in
each signal region, however there are also substantial contributions from the experimental and
template uncertainties, particularly at higher jet multiplicities. It should be noted that the total
8. Hunting for new phenomena in multi-jet final states 220
uncertainty in each region is in fact calculated through the background-only fit, to be described
in Section 9.1.1, and correlations between the various systematics are accounted for in doing so.

Constraining new phenomena in multi-jet final
states
We now turn to the unblinded results of the multi-jets analysis, using the 2015 and 2016
ATLAS data-set. In addition, interpretations of various simplified models, and the pMSSM
slice, are also discussed and the latest constraints on the masses of gluinos, neutralinos, and
stops generated by these different signals are presented. We shall also determine the expected
and observed sensitivities to several other R-parity-violating models of SUSY, by making use
of the analysis sensivity to both moderate- and low-EmissT final states.
9.1 Results with 36 fb1 of ATLAS Data
Before unblinding the signal regions and comparing the observed data with the total background
prediction, the individual components of the total background, together with their uncertainties,
are fitted in order to improve this final prediction. This is achieved using a background-only fit,
which takes information from the tt and W + jets control regions and extracts normalisation
factors, tt and W+jets, which fit the backgrounds to data. A similar normalisation for the
data-driven multi-jets estimate, multijets is also extracted using the template validation regions.
9.1.1 Background-Only Fit
The background-only fit is applied using the statistical techniques in the HistFactory software
package [155], which is in turn steered using the ATLAS HistFitter package [135]. The
analysis is first split into different channels, which correspond to different regions of phase-space
9. Constraining new phenomena in multi-jet final states 223
defined by specific selection criteria, namely a given signal region and the two associated control
regions. Each channel is simply an event count of the different backgrounds (referred to as
samples) and data. Since we are considering simple event counts, often in channels with few
events, an appropriate probability density function for each channel, c, is the Poissonian:
Pois(nc|c) =
ec , (9.1)
where c and nc are, respectively, the expected and observed number of events in channel
c. The expected number of events is determined from the predicted backgrounds b i.e. the
Monte Carlo predictions for tt and W + jets, and is given by
cbb,c()Sb,c. (9.2)
In the above, c denotes the true value of the detector luminosity and b are the various
normalisations for the different backgrounds b (which we wish to obtain through this background-
only fit). The b,c() represent the relative values of c when a parameter is changed by some
fraction  of its standard deviation. In this way, varying a parameter by a  uncertainty
corresponds to  = 1, and therefore b,c(+1) and b,c(1) denote the 1 up and down
systematic variations respectively. This variable therefore directly incorporates systematic
uncertainties into the fit. By definition, b,c(0) = 1, i.e. corresponds to the nominal value of
c. The Sb,c corresponds to the (unscaled) expected number of events in channel c from the
background b (per unit integrated luminosity): it is the product of the background bs total
cross-section, its acceptance for falling into channel c, and the efficiency with which the detector
reconstruction-level physics objects fall into channel c, given their truth-level properties.
In addition to this Poissonian, we also need to account for the measured detector luminosity,
L0, and its associated uncertainty, L. These values are determined from beam-separation
scans (similar to what is described in [156]) and, for the total ATLAS 2015 and 2016 data-set,
are measured to be 36.21  0.77 fb1. The true luminosity, , is constrained by a Gaussian
probability distribution, G(L0|,L), centred on the measured luminosity. This feature will
also need to be added to our final likelihood for the background-only fit.
9. Constraining new phenomena in multi-jet final states 224
In this fit the values of  are allowed to float. Allowing for this can result in profiling of
the systematic uncertainties, whereby the uncertainties can be shifted to values with large || in
order to give a better fit to the data in channel c. Since the calibrations and variations provided
by the various performance groups are typically trusted at values not too far above || = 1, it is
important to ensure that profiling of the uncertainties is constrained to -values close to what
is recommended. This is achieved through the application of Gaussian constraints on  for each
systematic variation p: Pp(ap, p), where the ap are chosen such that P is centred on 0 with
width 1.
Putting all of this together, we now arrive at the full expression for the likelihood function
of the background-only fit:
L(, |n, a) =
Pois(nc|c)G(L0|,L)
Pp(ap, p), (9.3)
where  and n are vectors of all scale factors b and observed events nc in each channel c.
By maximising this likelihood, W+jets and tt can be extracted for each of the signal regions.
9.1.2 Unblinded Results
The leptonic background estimations, multi-jet template validation, and background-only fit
evaluation of the  normalisations and systematic uncertainties takes place while the analsysis
is still blinded. That is to say, data points are not added to the EmissT /
HT > 5.0 GeV1/2
signal regions. Following the background-only fit, the normalisations are applied to the tt
and W + jets backgrounds (and systematics) and the analysis is unblinded in the signal
regions. Example unblinded EmissT /
HT distributions in the SR-8ij50-0ib, SR-9ij50-2ib
and SR-10ij50-0ib-MJ340 signal regions are shown in Figure 9.11. The dominant multi-
jet background prediction from the template method, as well as the Monte Carlo leptonic
background, are overlaid with the data. Two example signal model mass points, for the two-step
and pMSSM models, are also shown; these have larger event yields at higher values of EmissT /
as would be expected. Comparing the SM background with the data, it is clear that there is
no statistically significant excess above the SM expectation in these signal regions (see Table 9.1).
1For completeness, the EmissT /
HT distributions for the remaining signal regions are provided in Appendix C.

new physics process should predict in order to be excluded by that signal region; equivalently
this corresponds to an upper limit on the cross-section for BSM processes, given the luminosity
of the data. The fit considers one signal region, and all associated control regions, at a time; all
possible values of the signal strength normalisation factor, sig are scanned, until the p-value of
the signal plus background hypothesis is smaller than 0.05, or equivalently excluded at the 95 %
confidence level [157].
The model-independent fit begins by modifying the expected number of events c by adding
a single signal event in the signal regions, with a normalisation given by the signal strength
parameter, sig (hereafter simply denoted ). No assumptions are made about the nature
of this signal, and the effects of signal contamination in the control regions and systematic

uncertainties are neglected.  is the only parameter of interest in the fit; all other parameters
(such as background normalisations) are absorbed into a list of nuisance parameters, , such
that the likelihood may be written as a funtion of  and . To compute the upper limits on
the BSM events, the profile log-likelihood ratio [157] is employed as the test-statistic, which
is derived from the relative likelihood ratio:
() =
L(, ())
L(, )
, (9.4)
where  and  are the - and -values which maximise L, and () is a curve with points
corresponding to the maximum value of L for a given . The ()-value is close to 1.0 when
the agreement between the data and the hypothesis value of  is good.
The profile log-likelihood ratio test statistic is defined:
2 ln()   ,
0  <  (9.5)
where in this scheme data with  <  are not considered part of the final rejection region
on the statistical tests. To make progress, it is necessary to obtain a p-value, which can
be calculated from the probability density function of this test statistic, f(q|). For large
numbers of observed events, an estimate of this function is obtained using the asymptotic
approximation [158]. However, if the number of observed events is low then it is necessary to
obtain an f(q|) using Monte Carlo technique in which many pseudo-data-sets are sampled
from the original L of interest. Once the probability density has been correctly evaluated, the
p-value for the signal plus background hypothesis is computed from the integral
ps+b =
q,obs
f(q|)dq. (9.6)
 is scanned until a ps+b < 0.05, at which an exclusion at the 95 % confidence level on
the upper limit of the number of signal events in the signal region is attained, here denoted
S95obs. This can also be interpreted as an upper limit on the visible BSM cross-section: 95obs
= S95obs/Lint, where  corresponds to the fraction of the total cross-section to which the signal
region is sensitive. It is also possible to calculate the expected upper limit, S95exp, using the
test statistic for the background-only hypothesis:

All of the above assumes that a signal can only lead to a positive enhancement in the number
of event counts (the convention adopted in ATLAS) and thus the presence of new physics is
associated with an excess of events in a given region. The expected and observed upper limits on
BSM physics, together with the upper limit on the visible cross-section and the 95 % confidence
level for the background-only hypothesis, CLb, is summarised in Table 9.2 for each signal region
in the analysis. Knowledge of these upper limits is useful for theorists who may wish to perform
reinterpretations of the analysis results.
In the above treatment we have only associated excesses in data with the presence of new
physics, and have not accounted for the possibility of a downward fluctuation in data. In order
to ensure that such downward fluctuations dont result in new physics signal being incorrectly
excluded at the 95 % confidence level, ATLAS uses the conservative CLs prescription [159], in
which the p-value from the signal-plus-background hypothesis is normalised to the p-value
for the background-only hypothesis:
CLs =
1 pb
. (9.9)
Whilst CLs is not a true confidence level, it is always higher than CLs+b, and a signal
strength sig is considered excluded if it has CLs < 0.05. This CLs prescription is used to
calculate both the model-independent results in Table 9.2, and the model-dependent limits
(discussed in the next section).
9.2.1.2 Model-dependent Fits
In the event that no statistically significant excesses are reported, limits may be placed on
sets of specific models using the same likelihood function and test statistic considered in the
model-independent fit. This model-dependent fit is used to reject the hypothesis from certain

signal models, namely those outlined in Section 8.2. The best expected signal region is included
in the fit, together with the control regions and their associated background normalisation, and
sig is allowed to float. The CLs is calculated for sig = 1 at different signal grid points (e.g.
a grid built from the mass of the gluino and the neutralino), creating an exclusion contour
in the parameter-space of the signal grids, usually the particle mass points. A given signal
point is excluded at the 95 % confidence level if its CLs < 0.05. A 95 % exclusion contour

9.2.2 Constraining Gluinos, Neutralinos, and Stops
In the final sensitivity calculation the 27 signal regions are combined by considering, for each
signal grid point, the particular region which gives the best expected sensitivity calculated from
applying the signal hypothesis to the expected results from the Monte Carlo backgrounds and
multi-jet template estimation. The combined regions are used to calculate the final observed
limits, which test the signal hypothesis against the actual observed event yields as measured in
data. Systematic uncertainties are also included in the final limits.
In the pMSSM slice the gluino masses are excluded at the 95 % CL up to 1800 GeV, for
chargino masses of up to 600 GeV. For the R-parity-conserving simplified models, the gluino
masses can also be excluded up to about 1800 GeV in the case of the two-step models, whilst
in the gtt simplified model, the more boosted gluino mass points can be excluded upto about
1540 GeV, whilst the compressed neutralino LSP masses can be excluded up to about 520 GeV.
These exclusion limits are shown in Figures 9.3 and 9.4 for the pMSSM slice and the two-step
and gtt signals respectively. These limits should be interpreted with some caution because they

apply to specific models within the SUSY parameter space. However they do provide indications
that multi-jets is able to constrain the gluino mass up to values encroaching on 2.0 TeV, which
can be disfavoured by certain naturalness arguments.2 For completeness, a comparison of the
multi-jets sensitivity to the two-step model with other ATLAS SUSY analyses is provided in
Figure 9.5, which again indicates that gluinos are being excluded up to around 2.0 TeV at the
95 % confidence level.
As has been briefly discussed, the stop model considered in this analysis contains an R-
parity-violating coupling for the direct decay of the stop quark to purely heavy-flavour SM
particles (bs for the simplified model considered here). In this RPV scenario, gluino masses can
be excluded up to about 1400 GeV and the exclusion on the stop mass reaches about 900 GeV.
This 900 GeV mass could be interpreted by some as being in tension with the expected masses
for the production of stop quarks in natural SUSY scenarios, and is competitive with the limits
from other models considered in direct searches for stop production [160]. The limits are shown
in Figure 9.6.
In principle it is possible to extend the exclusion power of this analysis to other simplified
models, and particularly to different classes of RPV simplified models where the neutralino
can be long-lived, or decay promptly. The analysis regions are sensitive to final states with
little and moderate EmissT , and therefore to a variety of scenarios which depend on the strength
of the RPV coupling. The analysis sensitivity to the R-parity-violating phase-space, beyond

9.2.3.1 The RPC-meets-RPV Spectrum
Since the multi-jets analysis is sensitive to a variety of SUSY scenarios, both R-parity-conserving
and violating, it is interesting to quantify how this sensitivity changes with respect to the size
of the R-parity-violating coupling where, in the limit of zero R-parity couplings RPC SUSY
is recovered. There is also a clear relationship between the strength of the coupling and the
distance the sparticle involved in the decay propagates within ATLAS: smaller couplings will be
2A word of caution here: it is important to recall that natural SUSY is most strongly constrained by limits
on Higgsino production, as briefly discussed in Chapter 3.

generation quarks (q = {u, d, s, c}), and the gtt model has a non-zero 323 coupling of the
neutralino to heavy-flavour, 01  tbs. The models with larger couplings, giving rise to prompt
RPV decays, will produce less EmissT in the final states, and strongly produced SUSY analyses
which rely on an EmissT trigger will lose sensitivity once the average EmissT associated with the
neutralino falls below the trigger threshold. Analyses such as the multi-jets search, which have
no EmissT trigger threshold, should not be affected as severely and hence retain some sensitivity
to these lower EmissT , prompt decays.
9.2.3.2 Results
The gqq and gtt are generated by varying the gluino mass and the  coupling. The observed
sensitivity from the multi-jets analysis, calculated from the usual model-dependent fit, is shown
by the solid red curve in Figures 9.8 and 9.9 , where the expected sensitivity is also given by
the dotted red curve. For the first time in ATLAS, limits have now been set across the fully
theoretically motivated 112 and 323 spectra, for different gluino masses. Several RPC- and
RPV-focused SUSY searches are considered. In Figure 9.8 the multi-jets sensitivity to gqq

is compared with another SUSY search which is optimised to search for gluino production,
leading to final states with 2 to 6 jets [163]. This analysis is generally more sensitive than
the multi-jets search at lower 112 where the neutralino is more long-lived and the final states
typically have a jet multiplicity lower than 7 (which multi-jets is optimised for). In Figure 9.9
the multi-jets sensitivity to the gtt model is compared with several other SUSY analyses. The
analyses indicated by the green [164] and black [165] curves are optimised to search for RPV
SUSY scenarios, and are therefore the most sensitive, for a given gluino mass, at larger 323
where the RPV neutralino decays more promptly. An interesting comparison is with the multi-b
analysis [166], which has a limit indicated by the blue curve. This analysis searches for RPC
gluino production with final states with 3 or more b-tagged jets, not dissimilar to certain signal
region strategies in the multi-jets analysis. This analysis is more sensitive than the multi-jets
search at lower 323 because its signal regions are explicitly optimised to exclude RPC gtt
signals with heavier gluinos, unlike the multi-jets analysis where a more model-independent
view is taken in its optimsiation. Interestingly, the multi-b sensitivity falls sharply at larger
323, whilst the multi-jets sensitivity remains reasonably constant. Here we are seeing the effect
of the EmissT trigger which is used in the multi-b analysis, where there is a loss in sensitivity

Multi-Jets with Full Run 2 Data
To close Part III of this thesis, we shall briefly review the status of the latest iteration of the
multi-jets analysis, which is using the full Run 2 data-set and is aiming for publication in
2019. This latest quest for new matter is making use of several innovative developments in jet
physics, including optimisations of the reclustering algorithm, the technology of particle flow jet
reconstruction, and the ongoing development of taggers which can classify quark- and gluon-
initiated jets in complex multi-jet final states. These exciting endeavours are now briefly outlined.
10.1 Jet Reclustering Optimisation
The jet reclustering algorithm, used to construct the MJ observable, reclusters jets into new
jets of some larger radius [96]. In the 36 fb1 iteration of the multi-jets analysis, the reclustering
approach adopted is to combine the R = 0.4 jets into new ones of size R = 1.0, without applying
jet grooming of any kind, which would remove additional soft contributions to the jet. It is
believed that these R = 1.0 jets should be sufficient to capture sufficiently boosted heavy objects,
however the reclustering procedure has never been optimised.
For the full Run 2 analysis, the jet reclustering definition has been optimised by studying
reclustered jets of differing reclustered radii (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6) and studying
the expected sensitivity to different SUSY models in the inclusive 8-jet signal region, scaled to
an integrated luminosity of 120 fb1 1. In addition to changing the reclustered jet radius, the
1Comparable to the projected full Run 2 integrated luminosity at the time of these studies
10. Multi-Jets with Full Run 2 Data 240
event-level jet mass has also been modified in order to find, for a given reclustered jet definition,
the jet mass cut which provides the largest gain in signal sensitivity. As well as fixed-radius
reclustering, variable-radius [167] (VR) reclustering is also investigated. In the VR approach,
individual jets are reclustered into larger jets of some radius R which explicitly depends on
the jet pT according to R = /pT, where  = 2mX defines the mass scale of the reclustered
jet. Different mass scales are considered: mX = (90, 125, 175, 300, 500, 1000) GeV; and two
maximum reclustered radii set: Rmax = 1.8 and 2.5. The effect of the maximum radius is in
fact negligible. The effects of varying jet trimming [89] parameters on the reclustered jets are
also measured, and also found to be negligible. The studies summarised here therefore use
untrimmed jets.
An important conclusion of this scan is that sensitivity to compressed2 regions of SUSY
phase-space can be enhanced by using larger reclustered jet radii, so that a decaying object with
a larger opening angle (between its respective decay products) can be fully captured within the
reclustered jet cone. Conversely, smaller jet radii can be more sensitive to boosted regions of
phase-space where the average opening angle between decay products will shrink enough to
allow the parent particle to be fully contained within the smaller reclusterd jet. However, it
is also possible to instead keep the jet radius fixed at R = 1.0 and vary the MJ cut on the
reclustered jet. It is observed that standard R = 1.0 reclustered jets, with MJ cuts at a340 and
500 GeV, provide as much sensitivity to typical SUSY models as the most promising other, more
exotic reclustered jet definitions considered in the scan. This point is illustrated in Figures 10.1
(which shows the performance of different jet radii for MJ = 500 GeV is first shown), 10.2
(showing the R = 1.0 jet definition covering a nice range of sensitivities to the simplified model
for different MJ ) and finally 10.3 (which shows different VR jets with MJ > 500 GeV imposed).
These studies are carried out using gtt signal model points.
Studies using the two-step, pMSSM, and RPV stop signal models show similar expected
sensitivities between various reclustered jet definitions. Scanning through the different jet
collections, it was observed that the R = 1.0 untrimmed jets provided a good sensitivity to a
variety of signal models, which could be easily tuned by varying the MJ parameter. Again,
consistent with results from previous iterations, MJ of 340 and 500 GeVare found to offer the

best sensitivity to the more compressed and boosted regions of phase-space respectively.
For the case of variable-radius reclustering it is observed that no single combination of a VR
reclustered jet and some MJ cut provides the best possible signal sensitivity across all of the
available phase-space for the various SUSY signal models considered in the multi-jets analysis.
Therefore, putting all of these observations together, it is concluded that the original R = 1.0
jets with MJ cuts at 340 and 500 GeV offer the best signal sensitivity, and so these are adopted
as the reclustered jet definition for the full Run 2 iteration of the multi-jets analysis.
10.2 Object-Based EmissT Significance
The event-level variable considered in the template method is the EmissT significance; recall that
this variable quantifies the relative likelihood that a measurement of EmissT in the event originates
from a real source (such as a neutrino or some other undetected new physics particle) or a
fake source (e.g. jet resolution mismeasurement). The definition considered thus far is in fact
a macroscopic approximation to the true EmissT significance, which would in reality depend

on the resolutions from all physics objects in the event and not just the jets. A more general,
object-based EmissT significance [168] can be calculated from the hypothesis test that the real
EmissT carried by invisible particle is zero, against the hypothesis that it is different from zero.
This significance quantifies the likelihood that, given there is a measurement of EmissT , it
is from a real source rather than a mismeasurement or unwanted detector effect. Under the
assumption that the detector physics objects which enter into this calculation have transverse
momenta with probability distributions which are Gaussian and described by a covariance
matrix Vi, the significance can be reduced to a 2 expression:
S2 = (Emiss,realT )
T(iVi)1(Emiss,realT ). (10.1)
The covariance matrix encodes the resolutions of the different hard physics objects which
make up the EmissT calculation. Five objects enter into this calculation: electrons, photons,
hadronically-decaying taus, small-radius jets, and muons. In addition the track-soft term (TST)
is also added: recall that this TST is calculated from the transverse momenta of reconstructed
inner detector tracks which are not associated with any hard object in the detector, but which

are associated to the primary vertex of the event and therefore do not originate from pp collisions
associated with pileup. In addition the covariance matrix also contains the correlations between
the components of the particular object resolution which are longitudinal and transverse to the
direction of the total EmissT in the event.
The object-based definition of the EmissT significance is being adopted for the full Run 2
multi-jets analysis. The new definition is more correct than the macroscopic definition, and
preliminary studies indicate that the closure of the background prediction with respect to data
is much improved in more challenging regions of phase-space when the object-based significance
is adopted. This is illustrated in Figure 10.4, where the 36 fb1 3 SR-11ij50-0ib region is
compared for both the EmissT /
HT significance and the object-based significance.
10.3 Particle Flow Jets
One particularly attractive prospect for the full Run 2 analysis is the use of AntiKt4EMPFlow
jets as the small-radius jet definition (see Section 6.1.6 for more details). In using these jets the
analysis will benefit from the improved jet energy resolution at lower pT from the additional
tracking information, as well as improvements to the EmissT resolution. Studies also indicate that

the relative proportion of multi-jet background expected in the signal regions will also be reduced
using the new particle flow jets. This is shown in Figure 10.5 where the template fraction of
the total background is calculated for different lower bounds on the object-based EmissT in the
SR-8ij50-0ib signal region definition (note that the multi-jet background is estimated from
the usual template method and the other backgrounds are simulated in Monteestimatesdata in
the 8-jet signal region is explicitly used of course). It can be seen that for a signal region based
on EmissT significance above 4.0 or 5.0 (now unitless, as this is the object-based definition), there
is a 30 % reduction in the multi-jet background in the signal region when the PFO significance
is used, which calculates the object-based EmissT significance using the particle flow information.
10.4 Quark-gluon Tagging
An important conclusion of the studies in Section 8.3.6 is that the largest improvements
in sensitivity estimates to SUSY models considered in the multi-jets analysis comes from
constructing event-level variables, such as MJ , and not jet-by-jet variables such as those used
in conventional top-tagging. One of the major challenges when analysing complex multi-jet
10. Multi-Jets with Full Run 2 Data 246
final states is differentiating the quark-initiated jets from the gluon-initiated jets, where the
latter come from higher-order showering effects of the initial hard-scatter event. It would be
advantageous to develop a rigorous procedure for identifying such gluon-initiated jets so that
they can be removed in the final selection, whilst preserving the jets which are produced from
the original hard-scatter event. Several quark-gluon taggers are available for such a task. A
simple tagger measures the number of tracks associated to a jet, ntrack [168]. Gluon-initiated jets
tend to undergo more radiative emissions, and therefore such jets are wider with respect to their
axis, and have more tracks associated to them. Therefore by selecting jets which have fewer
associated tracks, it is possible to remove some gluon-initiated jets from the event. Cutting on
ntrack works well at the jet level, but at the event-level such a variable suffers from the same
problems as the substructure variables considered in top-tagging. In the multi-jets analysis, the
task is therefore to construct an event-level quark-gluon discriminating variable based on the
initial ntrack information from the individual jets in the event.
For the ntrack ATLAS tagger [168], a jet is selected and its pT is measured. A given track
multiplicity value, ntrack,X , is considered for each jet, and the value depends on the jet pT.
This ntrack,X is the typical upper limit on the track-multiplicity for a quark-initiated jet in
the pT-range of the jet of interest. The jet is then classified as either quark or gluon-initiated
according to this simple prescription: if ntrack > ntrack,X the jet is tagged as gluon-initiated,
otherwise it is considered to be quark-initiated.
This classification can be extended to the event-level in a simple way. For each quark-
tagged jet, a counter Q can be incremented by 1. Then, summing over all of the jets in
the event, the event-level QJ is defined:
QJ =
Qi, (10.2)
where the sum is over all i quark-tagged jets in the event. This definition can be generalised
by adding appropriate weights in the following way:
QJ =
(wqiQi + w
iGi). (10.3)
10. Multi-Jets with Full Run 2 Data 247
Here the Qi and Gi start from 0, and the former is incremented by 1 for a quark and the latter
by 1 for a gluon. The wi are defined in order to add larger weightings for jets with either few
or many associated tracks. The weights themselves can be optimised. For example, if a jet has
a measured number of associated tracks ntrack, then one possible definition for these weights is:
wq/g = 1.0 +
|ntrack  ntrack,X |
ntrack,X
. (10.4)
The use of such event-level quark-gluon tagging variables, and variants thereof, remains under
investigation.
10.5 Summary
In this chapter we have briefly described that latest developments in the multi-jets analysis with
the full Run 2 ATLAS data-set. The author is serving as one of the leaders of this analysis, and
is spearheading the incorporation of some of the latest jet and EmissT reconstruction techniques in
order to enhance the sensitivity to new physics at the LHC. This analysis is now in a very mature
stage, with most of the details surrounding the signal region definitions, systematic uncertainties,
and statistical fitting procedure finalised and will further our understanding of the fundamental
building blocks of reality using the very latest LHC physics data in an upcoming publication.
Conclusions
The LHC has now completed its second full run of data-taking, amassing approximately 140 fb1
of integrated luminosity suitable for physics analysis. This is an extraordinary, record-breaking
achievement in experimental particle physics. At the time of writing, many ATLAS analyses
which use this full Run 2 data-set are being prepared, including the latest iteration of the
multi-jets search, which the author is leading. These analyses will also benefit from the latest
technology in jet reconstruction, an area which the author has contributed to actively and with
great enthusiasm throughout Run 2 of ATLAS, and which was outlined in Part II of this thesis.
The first major component of original work in this thesis has focused on research and devel-
opment in hadronic jet physics, including 1) improvements which allow ATLAS experimentalists
to better measure jet kinematic variables, such as the jet mass, and assess their uncertainties
through the introduction of new jet mass definitions, resolutions, and approaches to extracting
resolution systematics; 2) the development of calibrations at the jet energy and jet mass scales
which are pivotal to all ATLAS analyses utilising jet reconstruction; 3) the introduction, and
subsequent performance analysis of, new inputs to jet reconstruction and new approaches to
pileup mitigation in large-radius jets, achieved via a combination of constituent-level pileup
subtraction techniques and new jet groomers beyond the standard approach of jet trimming
(such as Soft Drop and variants thereof). Putting all of this together, the work in Part II of this
thesis has led to entirely new large-radius jet definitions, and jet mass calculations, within the
ATLAS collaboration which will enhance the precision of new particle physics measurements, and
11. Conclusions 249
increase our sensitivity to new physics scenarios in dedicated searches, both in supersymmetry
and in other exotic contexts.
In the final part of this thesis, the techniques of jet reconstruction have been applied in
a benchmark search for new physics, motivated through models where gluinos are directly
produced and subsequently decay through complex cascades which generate final states with
many hadronic jets and EmissT . With 36 fb1 of ATLAS data, the quest for new matter in
these multi-jet final states has not produced any statistically significant deviation from the
predictions of the Standard Model, but this has allowed the author to constrain a variety of
models of new physics, including the masses of gluinos in R-parity-conserving supersymmetric
models to up to 1.8 TeV. Further to this, R-parity-violating supersymmetric scenarios, where
the lightest supersymmetric particle also decays, have been uniquely constrained by capitalising
on the low EmissT final-states permitted in multi-jets signal regions. In this context, the mass
of stop particles have been constrained to around 1.4 TeV and, for the first time at the LHC,
new constraints on the spectrum of the R-parity-violating decay vertex have been established,
indicating that limits on both prompt and long-lived RPV SUSY scenarios can be examined
up to moderate gluino masses around (and beyond) 1.5 TeV. Whilst these constraints could
begin to be interpreted as being in tension with the expected supersymmetric spectra arising in
natural models of SUSY1, it is worth bearing in mind that it is the job of an experimentalist
to make detailed, thorough, and trustworthy measurements of our observable universe so that
current physics hypotheses can be assessed, and new and exciting theories of physics can emerge
from the conclusions, ready for a new set of stringent and dedicated measurements to be
made. In this spirit, experimentalists at the LHC are now readying themselves for the third
run of data-taking in the early 2020s, where we shall continue to test the Standard Model
of particle physics and resume our quest for the production of new (and unexpected) forms
of matter at ever higher luminosities and collision energies.
1It is important to recall that there is also a degree of model-dependence in the limits discussed in this thesis.
Appendices
Appendix: Jet Mass Resolution at the HL-LHC
One important motivation for understanding the pileup robustness of different jet definitions, and
the impact of different jet input and grooming procedures on jet reconstruction, is quantifying
how the jet performance evolves in environments where the pileup contribution is significant.
An important use-case is for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [169], which is expected
to come online in the late 2020s. The average number of interactions per bunch-crossing
in the HL-ATLAS experiment is projected to be around 200, significantly larger than the
O(50) recorded during Run 2. Such dramatic increases in pileup will only deteriorate the
resolution of jet properties measured in the calorimeter, if for example the current R = 1.0
ATLAS jet definition (AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20) remains unmodified. This
deterioration is illustrated in Figure A.1, where the jet mass resolution is shown with respect
to the jet ptrueT , for simulations of the same QCD, W/Z-jet, and top jet topologies considered
in Chapters 6 and 7. The calorimeter mass definition is used, and the simulated jets have
been calibrated at the jet energy and jet mass scales in both the Run 2 (
s = 13 TeV) and
HL-LHC (
s = 14 TeV) cases. The large degradation in the resolution at higher transverse
momenta, due to the finite granularity of the calorimeter, is evident (and expected). The
red shows the expected JMR using simulated Run 2 2015 + 2016 data conditions, where the
average number of interactions per bunch-crossing is 21; in the blue, HL-LHC conditions are
simulated with an average of 200 interactions per bunch-crossing. A detector simulation of the
upgraded ATLAS inner tracker detector (ITk) [170] is also used for the HL-LHC JMR1. In all

conditions with an upgraded ATLAS detector based on the ITk Step-1.9 detector geometry (red and
blue respectively). The jets are reconstructed from LCW-calibrated calorimeter cell clusters, and
separate Monte Carlo-based jet energy scale and jet mass scale calibrations have been derived for the
Run 2 jets and HL-LHC jets, with good closure in the mass response observed after calibration.
three topologies, the JMR performance at low ptrueT is significantly worse in the high pileup
environment. This is a dramatic illustration of the limitations in current jet reconstruction
at ATLAS, and demonstrates the need for more effective pileup mitigation at the level of the
jet constituents if we are to utilise jet substructure techniques at the HL-LHC with improved
or comparable systematic uncertainties to what we currently have.
Appendix: Soft Drop Combined Mass
Following the latest inputs and grooming scan, the jet definition using zcut = 0.10,  = 1.0 Soft
Drop on CSSKLCTopo inputs has been studied in the combined jet mass definition. The combined
jet mass weights are again constructed from a sample of Pythia 8 Monte Carlo QCD dijets, and
used to construct the combined mass from the separate calorimeter and track-assisted masses.
The resulting jet mass resolutions are shown in Figure B.1, where both the combined and
calorimeter masses for the standard trimmed and Soft Drop jets have been overlaid. The Soft
Drop jet mass resolution will not necessarily be smaller than the trimmed; a more interesting
comparison is the pileup dependence of the combined mass. It was observed in Chapter 6 that
the combined mass performance at lower jet ptrueT could be non-optimal, in part due to the
presence of pileup in the calculation of the weights.
In Figures B.2 and B.3 the Soft Drop and trimmed combined masses are shown. Three
different cases are considered: first an inclusive case where there is no -cut applied to the
QCD dijets sample which is used to derive the combined mass weights; then the low pileup case,
where only dijet events with average  < 25 are used to calculate the combined mass weights;
and finally the high pileup case, where only dijet events with average  > 35 are considered
in the combined mass weight calculation. It can be seen that, in the case of trimmed jets, the
combined mass resolution at lower transverse momenta significantly worsens when higher pileup
events are used to construct the weights, as anticipated from previous observations. This is
not the case for the Soft Drop combined mass, where the combined mass resolution is superior

of constituent subtraction in the LCTopo inputs directly improves the pileup robustness of the
combined mass weights, and hence the mass resolution itself.

HT Distributions in all
Multi-Jets Signal Regions
This appendix summarises the remaining set of EmissT /
HT distributions in each of the signal
regions in the multi-jets search which have not already been described in the main body of
this thesis. Collectively these plots were included as material in [70]. The x-axes have variable
bin widths (up to 4 GeV1/2) and the y-axes indicate the numbers of events per 4 GeV1/2. The
plots show the major Monte Carlo backgrounds (semileptonic tt and W + jets), the data-driven
template QCD prediction, and the other combined backgrounds, together with 2015 + 2016
ATLAS data. Two benchmark signal points are also added, for the two-step and pMSSM models,
with parameters (mg, m01) = (1400, 200) GeV and (mg, m1 ) = (1400, 200) GeV respectively.

Glossary
Large Hadron Collider (LHC): The worlds largest and most powerful particle accelerator,
situated at CERN in Geneva.
Beyond the Standard Model (BSM): New physics theories which extend the Standard
Model in some way.
Supersymmetry (SUSY): A class of BSM theory that predicts the existence of a symmetry
between fermion and boson states, generating superpartner particle states.
R-parity: A multiplicative quantum number that is +1 for Standard Model particles and 1
for SUSY particles.
R-parity conserving (RPC): A particulary class of SUSY model in which the R-parity
quantum number is conserved at each interaction vertex.
R-parity violating (RPV): A particulary class of SUSY model in which the R-parity quantum
number may be violated at a given interaction vertex.
Sparticle: A superpartner of a Standard Model particle, hence a member of the SUSY sector
in a SUSY theory.
Lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP): The lightest sparticle in a given SUSY model.
In RPC models this will be stable and in cases where it is only weakly interacting it could be a
dark matter candidate.
Gluino: Superpartner of the gluon.
Higgsino: Superpartner of a Higgs boson.
Wino: Superpartner of a W boson.
Bino: Superpartner of a B boson.
Local cluster weighting (LCW): A calibration applied to topoclusters correcting e.g. non-
compensation in the hadronic response.
Jet mass (energy) response: the ratio of the reconstructed jet mass (energy) to the truth-
level jet mass (energy) when considering a Monte Carlo calibration of the mass (energy).
Gaussian smearing: A procedure for modifying the simulated jet resolution to account for
additional detector effects, using a multiplicative Gaussian function of the resolution.
Forward-folding: A procedure for modifying the simulate jet resolution to account for
additional detector effects, using a linear transformation which includes a term derived directly
from studies in data.
Closure: The degree of closeness of the calibrated jet mass (or energy) response to unity, where
the deviation from unity quantifies the non-closure.
Grooming: an algorithm which removes soft and wide-angled contributions from a jet, typically
to remove pileup contributions. Examples include trimming, pruning, and Soft Drop.
Missing transverse momentum, EmissT : an event-level variable, which is the magnitude of
the negative vector sum of all visible momenta in the event.

A.1 The fractional calorimeter jet mass resolution as a function of the truth jet
transverse momentum. The resolution is determined from jets produced via
beyond Standard ModelW  WZ  qqqq and Z   tt signals, and the QCD jet
process, using AntiKt10LCTopoTrimmedPtFrac5SmallR20 reconstruction. The
JMR is shown separately for typical ATLAS Run 2 conditions and for HL-LHC
conditions with an upgraded ATLAS detector based on the ITk Step-1.9 detector
geometry (red and blue respectively). The jets are reconstructed from LCW-
calibrated calorimeter cell clusters, and separate Monte Carlo-based jet energy
scale and jet mass scale calibrations have been derived for the Run 2 jets and
HL-LHC jets, with good closure in the mass response observed after calibration. 253
