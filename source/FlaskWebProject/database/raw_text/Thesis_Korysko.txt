Abstract
The high energy physics community considers electron-positron linear col-
liders in order to complement the results obtained at the Large Hadron
Collider. In order to achieve the design luminosity above 1034 cm2s1,
these linear colliders require a nanometer beam size at the Interaction
Point (IP). The electron and positron beams are transported inside the
Beam Delivery Systems (BDS) from the linear accelerators (LINACS) to
the IP. The beam is focused by two strong quadrupoles in the Final Fo-
cus System (FFS) where chromatic effects and aberrations are corrected
thanks to a local chromaticity correction scheme. Two projects are being
studied now, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact
Linear Collider (CLIC). Their FFS and the local chromaticity correction
are being tested at the Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) at KEK in
Japan. This test facility has been studying this matter for more than 20
years, achieving two of its main goals: obtaining a stable beam size around
37 nm at the IP and an orbit stabilisation with a nanometer precision at
the IP. However, these goals were achieved at 10% of the nominal beam
intensity. Indeed, when increasing the beam intensity, the beam becomes
more unstable and its size grows. This is mainly due to wakefields in the
ATF2 extraction line. Ultra-relativistic electrons going through the beam
pipe interact with the surrounding structure and create an electromag-
netic field, the wakefield. This field interacts with electrons inside the
same bunch (short-range wakefield) but also with electrons in the follow-
ing bunches (long-range wakefield). In ATF2, one considers that bellows,
flanges and cavity BPMs are the main sources of wakefield. This effect
results in increasing significantly the beam size at the IP. This thesis will
show the impact of these intensity-dependent effects inside ATF2 and
how to mitigate them. It will also show the impact of the same intensity-
dependent effects in future electron-positron linear colliders, the ILC and
CLIC.

Introduction
Particle physics is the study of the fundamental constituents of matter. The funda-
mental structure of matter is summarized by the Standard Model [6]. Everything in
the universe is made of building blocks called fundamental particles: the fermions,
the particles that make up all matter, and the bosons, the particles that carry forces
[7]. Fermions are either leptons or quarks.
There are three charged leptons, the electron, the muon and the tau, which all
have a charge of 1e (with e the elementary electric charge) and their respective
corresponding neutrinos with zero charge (0e) [8].
There are six different quarks, Up, Charm, Top which have a charge of +2
e and
Down, Strange, Bottom which have a charge of 1
e. Quarks combine in pairs to make
mesons or in triplets to make baryons. Protons and neutrons are baryons. Protons
are made of two up quarks and one down quark, and neutrons of one up quark and
two down quarks.
Three fundamental forces govern the interactions between those particles: the
electromagnetic force that has an infinite range and is mediated by a massless particle,
the photon (), the strong force that confines quarks into hadrons and is mediated
by another massless particle, the gluon (g), and the weak force, responsible for the
radioactive decay of atoms mediated by W and Z0 bosons [9]. The list of leptons
quarks and bosons with their respective charges is shown in Table 1.1.
A sixth boson, the Higgs boson which was predicted in 1964 by six physicists
including P. W. Higgs [10]. It was finally observed in 2012 with the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with
two detectors, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS
(ATLAS) [11][12]. In order to increase the production rate of Higgs bosons and thus
to study the Higgs boson more precisely, new colliders are being designed.

1.1 Circular and linear accelerators
From the Cockcroft-Walton generator in 1932 [13] to the first proton-proton collisions
in the LHC in 2009 [14], particle accelerators have been used to study the particles of
the Standard Model. The beam energy is one of the key parameters for those studies.
Since, as the energy increases, the number of possible reactions also increases, there
is a quest for higher and higher energies. A beam energy of 6.5 TeV was achieved in
the LHC in 2015, the highest energy ever obtained in an accelerator [15].
In order to increase the energy of the particles, these particles go through accel-
erating cavities where an electromagnetic field is generated. This field accelerates
the particles longitudinally. In the case of circular accelerators, the accelerating cav-
ities can be used multiple times in order to accelerate the beam turn after turn. To
keep the beam within a circular orbit, bending magnets are used. However, when
a charged particle is being accelerated radially, electromagnetic radiation is emitted
called synchrotron radiation. The radiated power, which causes undesired energy loss
1.2. Circular and linear colliders 3
in such accelerators, is defined as [16]:
60(m0c2)4
(1.1)
where c is the velocity of light, 0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, m0 is the rest
mass of the particle, E is the energy of the particle and  is the bending radius.
1.2 Circular and linear colliders
The accelerated particles are gathered into bunches and collided at an Interaction
Point (IP) where new particles are generated from those collisions. The nature of the
emitted particles and the interactions that can take place, depend on the center-of-
mass energy of the collision. The rate R at which a given interaction X occurs when
the beams collide is defined by:
R(X) = L(X) (1.2)
with (X) the cross-section of the interaction and L the luminosity. The luminosity
is a key parameter in the study of colliding beams. The basic expression for the
luminosity is [17]:
L = fcoll
4xy
F (1.3)
where fcoll is the average collision frequency, n1 and n2 are the number of particles in
the colliding head-on bunches, x and 
x are respectively the horizontal and vertical
Root Mean Square (RMS) beam sizes, and F is a factor of smaller than 1 that takes
into account geometric effects such as a crossing angle and finite bunch length and
dynamic effects such as the mutual focusing of the two beams during the collision. In
order to increase the number of events at the IP, one has to maximize the collision
frequency, maximize the beam intensities (n1 and n2) and minimize the transverse
beam sizes at the IP.
Higgs bosons are produced from proton-proton collisions in the LHC. Protons are
not fundamental particles, they are made of quarks and gluons. Thus, the interactions
that take place in the LHC are between quarks and gluons and not the protons them-
selves. Since the energy of each gluon and quark is not precisely known, uncertainties
exist in the analysis of the products of the collisions. Furthermore, particle identifica-
tion at the LHC detectors is hard due to the background in the collision events which
comes from strong interaction between quarks and gluons. The collisions of leptons,
which are point-like fundamental particles, leads to a lower background.
1.3. Linear electron-positron colliders 4
Using muons or taus would be challenging due to their short lifetime, 2.2 s and 290
fs respectively. Electrons and positrons are stable. Moreover, as seen in Eq. 1.1,
P  E
, then circular electron colliders are more sensitive to synchrotron radiation
than linear colliders. Thus, it seems that the next ideal large machine for studying
the Higgs, so called Higgs factory, would be a linear electron-positron collider. The
Higgs bosons would mainly be produced by Higgs-strahlung (ee  ZH) and WW
fusion (ee H) as shown in Fig. 1.1 [18].
Figure 1.1: Feynman diagrams for production of Higgs bosons via Higgs-strahlung
(left) and WW fusion (right).
1.3 Linear electron-positron colliders
There are two main future linear electron-positron collider designs, the International
Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).
1.3.1 The International Linear Collider (ILC)
The ILC is a linear electron-positron collider being considered for the post-LHC era.
A centre-of-mass-energy of 500 GeV would be achieved using the superconducting
radio-frequency accelerating technology [19]. A schematic of ILC is shown in Fig.
1.2. Electrons are created by a photocathode DC gun. They then travel through a
5 GeV, 3.2 km long damping ring. They go through a two-stage bunch compressor
system before being injected into the main LINAC. This high-energy electron beam
then passes through an undulator producing high-energy photons which convert into
electron-positron pairs. Both electron and positron beams are injected into two 11
km long main LINACs using 1 GHz superconducting radio-frequency cavities. Those
cavities operate with an average gradient of 31.5 MV/m. Finally, each beam travels
through two Beam Delivery Systems (BDS) to the IP where a detector will study
1.3. Linear electron-positron colliders 5
the collisions. In the BDS, detailed in Sec. 5, the beam is focused to the nanometer
scale after going through collimators, beam diagnostic systems, strong magnets, etc.
A nanometer-level beam size is obtained at the IP thanks to a Final Focus System
(FFS) scheme called local chromaticity correction [20]. This FFS is described in Sec.
2.1.3. Effects such as wakefields due to resistive-walls and Beam Position Monitors
(BPMs) make the system very sensitive to the beam intensity.
1.3.2 The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC)
The Compact Linear Collider aims to collide e+e beams with a centre-of-mass energy
from 380 GeV up to 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV. To obtain the high beam energy, an innovative
two-beam acceleration design, using accelerating cavities made of copper is used,
delivering an accelerating gradient of 100 MV/m [21]. The CLIC accelerating scheme
plans to increase the beam energy from 9 GeV, coming from the Damping Rings, to
1.5 TeV in a single pass for the third energy stage. The high energy main beam is
accelerated using RF power extracted from a secondary, high intensity but low energy,
drive beam, using special RF devices called Power Extraction and Transfer Structures
(PETS). The high current drive beam is obtained by recombining the bunches coming
from the drive beam accelerator. This recombination is done in the delay loop and the
combiner rings CR1 and CR2 [22, 23]. The beam travels then in the BDS, detailed in
Sec. 6 where its size is squeezed to the nanometer level. The latest CLIC parameters,
studies and results are summarized in the recent Project Implementation Plan [24].

1.4 Introduction to beam dynamics
In order to study the beam dynamics, a local 3-dimensional coordinate system (x, y, s)
is defined as shown in Fig. 1.4, with x the radial outward direction, y the vertical
upward direction, s the curved longitudinal particle trajectory and z the local tangent
to s. The coordinate s gives the position along the beam line, the particle coordinates
x and y measure the transverse distance from an ideal reference and z measures the
longitudinal distance to the ideal reference. A bunch is made of particles. If z < 0 the
particle is moving behind the bunch centre and arrives later in time than the bunch
centre at an arbitrary reference position.
s particle
Figure 1.4: Schematics of the reference particle trajectory, the transverse and longi-
tudinal coordinate system.
Considering a linear approximation, the vertical transverse motion of a particle is
defined as [25]:
y(s) = yr.t.(s) + y(s) +Dy(s) (1.4)
with y(s) the vertical coordinate at the location s, yr.t. the reference trajectory, y the
vertical orbit variation due to the betatron motion (transverse oscillations) and Dy
the orbit change due to an energy offset where Dy is the vertical dispersion function
and  = p/p is the relative deviation from the design momentum. Note that the
horizontal transverse motion would follow Eq. 1.4 replacing y by x.
In order to focus the beam transversely, quadrupole magnets are used. The equa-
tion of vertical motion in one quadrupole follows [25]:
= k(s)y with k =
(B)a
(1.5)
with k(s) the normalised focusing strength, BT the quadrupole pole-tip field, a the
pole-tip radius and (B) the magnetic rigidity of the beam. In classical optics,
rays with different wavelengths will observe a different refractive index in a lens and
1.4. Introduction to beam dynamics 9
therefore experience a different focal length. In accelerator physics, one can observe
some similarities. Particles with different momenta feel a different focusing strength
while traversing the same quadrupole and thus have a different betatron oscillation
frequency. In order to correct the variation of the quadrupole focusing strength
with the particle momentum, the so-called chromaticity, sextupole magnets are used.
These are a non-linear elements which have to be installed at locations with nonzero
dispersion to correct chromatic effects. The sextupole field is defined as:
(B)a2s
(1.6)
with BTs the sextupole pole-tip field, as the pole-tip radius and (B) the magnetic
rigidity.
If one considers only the effects of linear elements, for a constant beam energy,
the vertical betatron motion, solution of 1.5 follows [26]:
y(s) =
y(s)cos(y(s) + 0) (1.7)
with y the vertical beta function,  the emittance and y(s) the betatron phase. The
beta function modulates the amplitude of the beams betatron oscillations along the
beamline, the emittance is a measure of the average spread of particle coordinates
in a position-momentum phase space and the betatron phase represents the phase of
the sinusoidal oscillation between two s positions in the machine. 0 is the initial
phase of any given particle at s = 0. A phase advance of 2 means that a full period
of oscillation is done between those two points.
In addition to the beta function, two functions are used to characterize the betatron
motion, they are as follows:
(s) = 
d(s)
, (s) =
1 + 2(s)
(1.8)
It is customary to describe the envelope of all particles of a beam in phase space
by an ellipse, here in the vertical plane, described by:
y2 + 2yy + y2 =  (1.9)
where y = dy
, , ,  are the already defined Twiss parameters and  is the emittance.
The area of the ellipse is equal to . The ellipse and some of its parameters are shown
in Fig. 1.5. ,  and  determine the shape and the orientation of the ellipse. Two
important parameters are defined: the vertical beam size y =
yy and the beam
divergence y =

Figure 1.5: Schematics of the ellipse with selected parameters.
During a transformation along a beam transport line, the ellipse will continuously
change its shape and orientation but will keep a constant area. A classic example
is the Focusing quadrupole-Drift-Defocusing quadrupole-Drift (FODO) lattice. A
schematic of this lattice is shown in Fig. 1.6. The first focusing quadrupole will focus
the beam and, after a drift space, will reduce its beam size. It translates into a rotation
of the ellipse of 90 degrees. Once the beam is focused, it is defocused by a defocusing
quadrupole which, after a drift space, translates into another rotation of the ellipse of
90 degrees which brings the ellipse back to the initial position. Alternating focusing
and defocusing quadrupoles are often used that way in order to keep the beam orbit
stable.
These concepts will be used in the following chapters

2.1.1 The ATF2 beamline
The Accelerator Test Facility 2 (ATF2) is a linear electron accelerator designed to
study the feasibility of beam dynamics and technologies required for the next gener-
ations of linear colliders [27]. It was built at the Japanese High Energy Accelerator
Research Organization (KEK). Beam operations began in 1997 with the ATF2 which
had an initial goal of achieving small emittance beams to meet the requirements for
future linear colliders such as the ILC. The goals were achieved in 2001 [28, 29]. In
2008, in order to study the challenges of obtaining and measuring nanometer beam
sizes, ATF was upgraded to ATF2 [30]. ATF is made of an injector, a LINAC, a
Damping Ring (DR), and the ATF2 beamline. The layout of ATF2 is shown in Fig.
2.2 [31]. As of January 2019, the ATF2 beamline consists of 49 quadrupoles, 5 sex-
tupoles, 7 dipoles, 4 skew quadrupoles, 22 correctors (12 in the vertical plane and 10
in the horizontal one), 38 Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) (13 Stripline BPMs and
25 Cavity-BPMs (C-BPMs). The beamline is made of a 52 m long extraction line
(EXT) and a 38 m long Final Focus (FF) and matching section. A Radio Frequency
(RF) gun generates bunches with a large range (0.01 1010 e per bunch to 1.0 1010
e per bunch) at a frequency of 3.12 Hz. These bunches are accelerated to 1.28 GeV
in an 88 m LINAC. They are then injected into a 139 m circumference damping ring
where they are stored for between 100 and 450 ms. The beam emittance is reduced
due to synchrotron radiation. This damping ring provides a vertical emittance of less
than 10 pm which is comparable to the requirement of the ILC BDS [32, 33]. The
electron bunches are extracted from the damping ring with a kicker [34]. They then
2.1. ATF2 setup and goals 12
go through an emittance diagnostic section including Optical Transition Radiation
monitors, which measure the transverse beam size and permit emittance reconstruc-
tion [35]. The beam is then transported, focused and tuned in order to obtain a
nanometer beam size at the IP.
The relevant ATF2 design beam parameters are listed in Table 2.1. The Twiss
parameters of the beamline are shown in Fig. 2.1. The chromaticity of the ATF2
beamline is designed to be comparable to the ILC final focus system with a resulting
design IP vertical beam size of 37 nm. Recently, the ATF2 beamline has been operated
with a 10 times larger horizontal IP beta-function, x, than originally designed so as
to make the effect of multipole field errors comparable with the tolerances of the
ILC final focus design. This optics is referred to as the 101 optics because of the 10
times larger x and the same y compared with the original design, while the nominal
configuration is labeled 11 optics.

2.1.2 Goals of ATF2
The ATF2 beamline was designed and built in order to fulfill two main goals:
 Goal 1: Achieve a small vertical beam size at the IP (37 nm) and demonstrate
the efficiency of the FFS based on local chromaticity correction;
 Goal 2: Control the beam position and demonstrate the efficiency of the beam
orbits stabilisation to the nanometer level at the IP.
Significant resources and work have been put in during these last few years in
order to achieve goal 1. A minimum vertical beam size of 42 nm was measured in
2016 as shown in Fig. 2.3 [36]. However, due to several machine imperfections, which
are defined in section 4.2, such a small beam size was hardly achieved since then.
Furthermore, these measurements were obtained with a beam intensity of 1  109
electrons per bunch, 10% of the nominal intensity.
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION

2.1.3 The final focus system and local chromaticity correc-
The ATF2 beamline was built to study the ILC FFS based on the local chromaticity
correction technique [20]. The optical layout of the system in shown in Fig. 2.4.
In order to obtain nanometer-scale beams at the IP, the beam is focused by Final
Doublet (FD) magnets: QF1 and QD0. However, the strong focusing magnets of the
FD generate chromaticity. This chromaticity is corrected locally by two sextupoles
(SF1 and SD0) adjacent to the FD quadrupoles and by dipoles upstream that gener-
ate dispersion across the FD (B2FF and B1FF). The sextupoles generate geometric
2.1. ATF2 setup and goals 15
aberrations, so two more sextupoles in phase with them are placed upstream of the
dipole magnets (SF5 and SD4) in order to correct those aberrations.

2.1.4 ATF2 phase advance
The phase advance is one of the key parameters for the intensity-dependent effects
studies. Indeed, depending on the phase advance, the impact of a kick will be different.
Between the extraction of the DR and IP, the vertical phase advance was designed to
be 8, which means that a kick at the extraction will lead to an angle offset at the
IP and a position offset will lead to a position offset. The phase advance between the
IP and positions upstream in the beamline is shown in Fig. 2.5.

2.2.1 The IP Beam Size Monitor (IP-BSM)
A beam size monitor [37] was installed at SLAC Final Focus Test Beam (FFTB)
during the 1990s, measuring a beam size of approximately 70 nm [38]. In order
to measure beam sizes down to 37 nm, this IP Beam Size Monitor (IPBSM) was
modified and installed at the ATF2 IP. A schematic of the system is shown in Fig.
2.6. It consists of an optical system for the lasers and a gamma detector. A laser
beam with a wavelength  = 532 nm is generated and sent to a vertical optical table
located at the ATF2 IP where it is separated into two beams. These two beams create
interference fringe patterns which are then intersecting with the electron beam. The
laser fringe pitch is defined by the wavelength () and crossing angle of the two laser
paths (): d = /2 sin(/2). The overlap of the laser fringe pattern and the electron
beam creates Compton scattered photons. Those photons are detected downstream
of the IP by the photon detector and the measured modulation depth of the laser
interferometer (M) is written as a function of the IP vertical beam size (y):
M = C cos  exp (2k2y2y) (2.1)
N+ N
N+ +N
(2.2)
with C the modulation reduction factor, which includes systematic effects such as
the alignment accuracy, the polarization, the temporal coherence, the phase jitter,
the tilt of the fringe pattern, etc. [39],  the crossing angle of the two laser paths,
ky = /d, d = /2 sin(/2) and N+ and N the maximum and minimum signal
intensity, respectively. From Eq. (2.1), the beam size is expressed as a function of the
modulation depth:
C cos 
). (2.3)
For ATF2, 3 laser crossing modes (2-8-degree mode, 30-degree mode, 174-degree
mode) are used to increase the range of possible beam size measurements [40]; their
dynamic ranges are shown in Fig. 2.7 [4].

2.2.2 Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system
2.2.2.1 Stripline BPMs
In order to measure the beam position in the ATF2 beam line, a set of 38 BPMs are
used: 13 stripline-BPMs and 25 Cavity-BPMs (C-BPMs). A picture and a schematic
2.2. ATF2 beamline diagnostics 18
of a Feedback On Nano-Second Timescales (FONT) stripline-BPM, of the same type
of the other stripline-BPMs used in the beamline, are shown in Fig. 2.8. Stripline-
BPMs are made of four strips, or electrodes, and are connected via feedthroughs to
the readout. The beam offset compared to the center of the BPM is determined by
measuring the potential difference between the electrodes [41]. 13 stripline-BPMs
are localised in the first half of the ATF2 extraction line. The first one is 3.09 m
downstream of the extraction kicker and the last one is 32.72 m. They are able to
measure the beam orbit in both planes with a resolution between 5 m and 20 m
as shown in Fig. 4.11.

2.2.2.2 Cavity BPMs (C-BPMs)
The ATF2 C-BPMs are designed to operate using the dipole mode (TM110) with
a frequency of 6.422 GHz. This means that the dipole mode field strength depends
linearly on the transverse beam offset from the cavity center, and it is zero for a beam
centered within the cavity [41]. A picture and a schematic of the device are shown
in Fig. 2.9. They have an aperture with a radius of 10 mm. This aperture is one
of the smallest apertures in the beamline and thus, these C-BPMs create significant
wakefield kicks that will be an important point in the rest of these studies. These
C-BPMs have a resolution smaller than 1 m as shown in Fig. 4.11.

2.2.3 Upstream FONT BPMs
A set of 3 stripline BPMs are located in the ATF2 extraction line between the BPMs
MQF9X and MQD19X: P1, P2 and P3. They are part of the FONT system used
for stabilizing the vertical beam position in the upstream ATF2 beamline [42]. The
positions on P1, P2 and P3 are shown in Fig. 2.10. The design goal for the FONT5
system is to stabilize the vertical beam position to the 1 m level at the entrance to
the final-focus system. These three stripline BPMs measured the beam orbit with a
resolution of around 291  10 nm at 0.51010 e [43, 44, 45].

2.2.4 FONT IP-BPMs
Three C-BPMs were installed in the interaction point region of ATF2. Two are
located before the IP, IPA and IPB and the third one after the IP, IPC. The position
of IPA, IPB and IPC are shown in Fig. 2.11. They were developed and optimized
to measure the beam position with a nanometer-level resolution [46]. The BPMs are
used to provide an input to a low-latency, intra-train beam position feedback system
deployed in single-pass, multi-bunch mode with the aim of demonstrating intra-train
beam stabilisation on electron bunches.

Chapter 3
Simulations of intensity dependent
effects in ATF2
3.1 Introduction to wakefields
In order to understand the intensity-dependent effects in ATF2, one has to look at
the impact of wakefields. The integrated fields seen by a test particle traveling on
the same, or on a parallel path, at a constant distance s behind a point charge Q are
called the integrated longitudinal (z direction) and transverse (x and y directions)
wakepotentials [47]. They are respectively defined as:
W (r, s) =
(r, z, s) + cz B (r, z, s)]dz
W (s) = 
[Ez (z, s)]dz
The wakepotentials are excited by a charged particle with charge Q located at s = 0
when it travels through a beamline component of length L with transverse offset
with respect to the centre of the beam pipe r. The longitudinal wakepotential is a
function of s; whereas the transverse potential is also a function of r. The integrated
wakepotentials W and W are normally obtained using 3D electromagnetic solvers
(e.g. GdfidL [48]) or using analytic models. Notice that the integrated wakepotential
is normalized to the charge of the exciting particle, such that its units are V/C.
It is customary that the wakepotentials are normalized to the length of the ele-
ment, L:
W (r, s) = W (r, s) /L
W (r, s) = W (r, s) /L
3.1. Introduction to wakefields 23
such that the wakepotentials have units V/C/m. In the following, the symbol  is
dropped and one indicates with W and W the normalized wakepotentials, expressed
in units of V/C/m.
The longitudinal and transverse transferred momenta experienced by a particle
with charge q because of the wakepotentials W and W while traveling through an
element of length L, are then:
P =
W [eV/c]
P = 
W [eV/c]
The transverse and longitudinal kicks felt by a particle, at position z along the
bunch, due to all leading particles (z  z > z):
r =
W (r (z) , z  z) (z)dz
P =
W (z  z) (z)dz
with:
  (z) normalized line charge density of the bunch, such that 
  (z)dz = 1
 r (z) transverse radial position of the leading particles as a function of their
position z along the bunch [mm]
 Q total charge of the bunch [C]
 P particles momentum [eV/c]
The wakefield functions are often approximated with their Taylor expansions with
respect to r (normally, just zeroth and first orders are considered)
W (s) W (s) longitudinal monopole mode (0thorder)
W (r, s) rW1, (s) transverse dipole mode (1storder)
such that:

 r(z) W1, (z  z) (z)dz
P (z) qQ L
W (z  z) (z)dz

The kick thus reads:

Figure 3.1: Scheme of the two-particle model.
A scheme of the two-particle model is shown in Fig. 3.1. In the two-particle beam
model (1: leading, 2: trailing), the integrals become very simple:
W1, (z  z) (z)dz W1, (z12) [V/C/m/mm]
W (z  z) (z)dz W (z12) [V/C/m]
where z12 is the distance between the two particles (normally one takes z12  2z),
and W1, and W are the single-particle normalized wake functions. Such that the
kick on the trailing particle reads:
r2 =
Lr1 W1, (z12) [rad]
P2 =
L W (z12) [eV/c]
where r1 is the offset of the leading particle.

3.1.2 Effects of wakefields on the beam
3.1.2.1 Single-bunch beam breakup
Figure 3.2: Resonant buildup of the displacement of the tail relative to the head of
the bunch.
An important effect in high-intensity electron LINACs is single-bunch beam breakup,
which is caused by the transverse dipole mode. As a result of the external focusing
forces, an off-axis particle at the head of the bunch will execute transverse betatron
oscillations around the beam axis. The tail particles would do the same as the head,
if it were not for the transverse wakefields induced at the head that affect the tail.
The effect of such a wakefield is a resonant buildup of the displacement of the tail
relative to the head of the bunch (see Fig. 3.2). The bunch shape, during beam
breakup by the action of the dipole wakepotential, is heavily distorted and assumes
a known banana shape. This induces an apparent transverse beam size growth.
3.1.2.2 Orbit deflection and beam size at the IP
In order to estimate the impact of the induced wakefields at a certain location, the
wakefield kick given in Eq. (3.1) can be transported to the location of interest using
the first order transport matrix formalism. Using this formalism, the horizontal and
vertical position difference at the IP with and without a wakefield source, i, can be
estimated as:
r(x, y) =
ix,y
x,y sin 
x,yr(x, y)i (3.3)
where ix,y is the betatron function at the wakefield source location, 
x,y is the beta-
tron function at the IP, ix,y is the betatron phase advance difference between the
wakefield source and the IP and (x, y)i is defined in Eq. (3.1).
3.2. Simulations of corrections and intensity dependent effects 26
The wakefields induced by the source i also induce a change on the transverse
beam size at the IP. The transverse beam size at the IP, x,y, taking into account the
wakefields induced by the wakefield source i, can be estimated as [49]:
2x,y = 20x,0y +w2Q2 (3.4)
where 0x,0y is the beam size at the IP without taking into account the wakefield, Q
total charge of the bunch and w the intensity dependence parameter.
3.2 Simulations of corrections and intensity de-
pendent effects
3.2.1 Wakefield sources in ATF2
As previously explained, charged particles that travel across the vacuum chamber of
an accelerator induce electromagnetic fields. They are enhanced by discontinuities
in the beamline geometry. Devices such as C-BPMs or bellows in the beamline lead
to a wakefield kick that alters the beam quality. In order to calculate the impact of
wakefields in ATF2, simulations were done with PLACET [50], a code that simulates
the dynamics of a beam in the main accelerating or decelerating part of a linac in
the presence of wakefields, misalignments and other imperfections. It allows one to
investigate single and multi-bunch effects, and to simulate different types of correc-
tions [50]. In order to simulate with PLACET the impact of wakefields in ATF2,
rigid-bunch simulations were considered. These simulations consist in computing the
wakefield kick assuming that the longitudinal profile of the bunch is Gaussian and
does not change along the beam trajectory. As stated earlier, the wakefield kick was
calculated with GdfidL, an electromagnetic field simulator [48], assuming a 7 mm
Gaussian beam with a charge of 1 pC traveling through the element with an initial
transverse offset of 1 mm. There are three main wakefield sources in ATF2: C-BPMs,
bellows and flanges.
3.2.1.1 Cavity BPMs (C-BPMs)
The main wakefield sources in the ATF2 beam line are the 25 C-BPMs [51]. The
position of the C-BPMs is shown in Fig. 3.3. They are used to measure the horizontal
and vertical beam orbit from the extraction of the damping ring all the way to the
IP. The geometry of the ATF2 C-BPM, inputted in GdfidL, is shown in Fig. 3.4 with
a beam aperture a = 20 mm, the resonator diameter Dr = 53.7 mm, the resonator

length Lr = 12 mm, the wave-guide height hw = 7.5 mm and the wave-guide width
Ww = 28 mm. The resulting calculated transverse wakepotential for a Gaussian bunch
of 7 mm and a 1 pC charge with a vertical offset of 1 mm is shown in Fig. 3.5. The
wakepotential is computed for a test bunch, and then normalized to the reference
units in order to be scaled to any charge or any offsets one needs.

the distribution of the electrons in one bunch is shown (in blue).
3.2.1.2 Bellows
ATF2 contains around 100 bellows. Most of them are masked and thus do not generate
any wakefields. However, the unmasked bellows are strong wakefield sources. Their
position is shown in Fig. 3.6. The geometry of the bellows used in the beamline is
shown in Fig. 3.7 and the wakepotential is shown in Fig. 3.8. Bellows are the second
strongest wakefield source in ATF2.

significant wakefields. Their position is shown in Fig. 3.9. The geometry of the
flanges used in the beamline is shown in Fig. 3.10 and the wakepotential is shown in
Fig. 3.11. Flanges are the third strongest wakefield sources in ATF2.

3.2.2 Orbit, dispersion and wakefield corrections
In current and future particle accelerators, where a nanometer-scale emittance is
achieved, high precision alignment of magnets and elements is required. Typical
residual misalignments are in the range of 50-100 m and in extreme cases, the align-
ment tolerances can be as small as 10 m. In order to meet this goal and to maintain
it, beam-based alignment techniques are used.
3.2.2.1 One-to-one correction
The One-to-one correction consists of minimizing the transverse position of the beam,
with respect to the beam pipe centre, measured at BPMs. In ATF2, BPMs are
located inside quadrupoles and steering magnets are used in order to kick the beam
and make it pass through the center of the BPM. A schematic of the correction is
shown in Fig. 3.12. In the beamline, the transverse centroid position of the beam
measured downstream at the location s = j is:
iji sin (j  i) (3.5)
In matrix form:
c1b1 sin (b1  c1) 0  0
   
  0
c1bm sin (bm  c1)  
cnbm sin (bm  cn)

(3.6)
where i is the dipole kick, i is the location of the initial disturbance and j the
location of the observation, y is the measured vertical orbit at m BPMs, bj  ci
is the phase advance between BPM j and corrector i and M contains the transfer
matrix elements between the correctors and the BPMs [25]. In ATF2, there are more
BPMs than correctors. Thus, in order to minimize the orbit at BPMs, one has to
calculate  from Eq. 3.6 as:
M ty =M tM
 = (M tM)1M ty
(3.7)
where (M tM)1M t is the so-called pseudo-inverse of M .

However, the One-to-one correction does not address the effects of spurious trans-
verse kicks due to magnet misalignments and steering magnets, which indeed generate
unwanted dispersion. Thus a second correction is used, the Dispersion Free Steering.
3.2.2.2 Dispersion Free Steering (DFS)
The Dispersion Free Steering (DFS) is an algorithm which corrects the effects of
unwanted dispersion, which leads to emittance growth [52]. In practice, two beams
are tracked with two different energies, E1 and E2. Steering magnets are then used
to correct the orbit and reduce the orbit difference due to dispersion between the two
beams y,E. A schematic of the DFS is shown in Fig. 3.13.

The Wakefield Free Steering (WFS) is an algorithm which corrects the difference
in the orbit introduced by wakefields [53]. In practice, two beams are tracked with
different charges Q1 and Q2. Steering magnets are then used to correct the orbit and
reduce the orbit difference between the two beams y,Q. A schematic of the WFS is
shown in Fig. 3.14.

3.2.2.4 IP tuning knobs
In ATF2, there are five sextupole magnets (SF6,SF5,SD4,SF1 and SD0). In order
to correct the linear aberrations in the ATF2 FFS, sextupole magnets are displaced
[54]. These sextupole knobs are orthogonal, meaning that the conditions between
the sextupoles shifts are established to correct independently the chosen set of beam
aberrations at the IP independently of the others. The transverse positions of all
the sextupole magnets are set using movers. Each sextupole is displaced individually
in the horizontal and vertical planes to build the corresponding aberration response
matrices. When a sextupole magnet is moved horizontally, a quadrupole field is
generated. The strength of the generated quadrupole field is proportional to the
horizontal offset and changes the horizontal and vertical beam waists. In ATF2, three
main linear aberration contributions, impacting the vertical beam size, are corrected
during the tuning process. These aberrations are the vertical beam waist shift y ,
vertical dispersion y and x/y coupling at the IP [55].
Nonlinear knobs are also constructed in order to correct the residual 2nd order
aberrations at the IP. These knobs use the strength variations of the 5 sextupoles.

They mainly reduce the correlations between y and x2, between y and x  y and
between y and x  x [56].
3.2.2.5 Impact of One-to-one, Dispersion Free Steering, Wakefield Free
Steering corrections and IP tuning knobs
The efficiency of the corrections was studied with PLACET. The ATF2 beam line
with the wakefield sources listed in 3.2.1 was considered. A Gaussian bunch with
30,000 macro particles was tracked through 100 machines in order to sample the
space of possible configurations. Each machine had a different random misalignment
seed. Those machines have the following static errors: 100 m RMS misalignment
for quadrupoles, sextupoles and BPMs, 200 rad RMS roll error for quadrupoles
and sextupoles and a strength error of 0.01% RMS for quadrupoles and sextupoles.
For this study, the beam intensity was 1.0  1010 e. As shown in Fig. 3.15 and
summarized in Table 3.2, the average vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines,
y , is reduced from more 138  86.2 m with no correction to 1220  337 nm after
applying the One-to-one correction. Then, reducing the impact of dispersion and
wakefields on the orbit, thanks to DFS and WFS corrections, reduced the average
vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines to 904 145 nm. Finally, the IP tuning
knobs corrected the linear and second order aberrations and thus reduced the average
vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines to 58.4  4.7 nm, close to the design
value of 37 nm for a perfect machine.
The implemented corrections, which are reproducing what was done in the real ma-
chine, permitted to obtain an average vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines
of 58.4  4.7 nm which is in the same order of magnitude as the measured vertical
beam size in the last four years as shown in Fig. 2.3.

3.3 Impact of static errors: misalignments, spuri-
ous multipoles, rolls
In order to study the impact of static errors, a Gaussian bunch with 30,000 macro
particles was tracked through 100 machines. In this first scenario, only misalignments
of quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sextupoles were considered. Five different amplitudes
of RMS misalignment were studied here: 0 m (perfectly aligned machine), 25, 50,
75 and 100 m. The impact of those misalignments on the average vertical IP beam
size (y ) is shown in Fig. 3.16 as a function of the intensity. The dots correspond
to the average of 100 machines and the error bars to the standard error, i.e. the
standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of machines. The larger
the misalignment amplitude, the larger is y and this effect scales with the beam
intensity. Indeed, the slope of each case shows that for a perfectly aligned machine,
y is the same at low and high beam intensity, but the larger the misalignment
amplitude, the larger is the correlation between y and the beam intensity. This is
due to the fact that a larger misalignment amplitude leads to a larger orbit distortion
at wakefield sources, thus a higher wakefield kick and a larger beam size at the IP.
In a similar way as for the misalignments, the impact of the quadrupoles and
sextupoles strength errors was studied. 100 machines with multipole strength errors
of 104 RMS in both quadrupoles and sextupoles were considered. This means that

each machine had a different random strength error seed. Quadrupoles, sextupoles
and C-BPMs are also misaligned by 100 m RMS. The results are shown in Fig. 3.17.
These strength errors increase the vertical IP beam size. Indeed, 38 perfect machines
provided a vertical beam size of at most 38 nm, against 15 machines for the random
multipole case.
Finally, the impact of roll errors (rotation around the magnet axis) of 200 rad
RMS was studied in BPMs, quadrupoles and sextupoles. The impact on the vertical
beam size as function of the intensity can be seen in Figure 3.18 for the above simu-
lation conditions. The error bars represent the standard error for 100 machines. The
beam size growth due to such roll errors is around 2.2 nm at 0.21010 e and around
4.4 nm at 1.0  1010 e. The impacts of static errors are summarized in Table 3.3.

3.4 Impact of dynamic errors: incoming position
and angle jitters
Static errors are not the only errors which have a significant impact of the vertical
beam size. One also has to study the impact of dynamic errors. Indeed, the incom-

ing jitter is one of the key parameters to quantify and to understand the intensity-
dependent effects in ATF2. The ATF2 beam is injected in the extraction line with
both angle and position jitters [57]. In order to study their impact, the following
simulation conditions were considered: quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sextupoles have a
misalignment of 100 m RMS and a roll error of 200 rad RMS and the strength er-
ror of quadrupoles and sextupoles is 104 RMS. In this case again, One-to-one, DFS,
WFS corrections, as well as IP knobs were applied on each machine. This was done
for 100 machines and 200 pulses per machine.
In order to quantify the amplitude of the incoming jitter, measurements were
performed in ATF2 using the FONT upstream BPMs. An incoming position jitter
of 1.0y and an angle jitter of 1.0y were measured, with y , the beam divergence
(y =
). The detailed studies can be found in section 4.3.
In the simulations, four amplitudes of jitter: 0.1y, 0.3y, 0.5y and 1.0y for the
position jitter and 0.1y , 0.3y , 0.5y and 1.0y for the angle jitter were considered.
These different position and angle jitters induced a larger average bunch transverse
position at wakefields sources, r, and thus larger wakefield kicks r, as seen in Eq.
3.1. The impact of an incoming angle jitter of 0.1y was first studied. The vertical
IP beam size dependence on the beam intensity and the IP beam size distributions
for 0.1  1010 e and 1.0  1010 e are shown in Fig. 3.19. The dashed line is the
intensity-dependent parameter fit defined in Eq. 3.8. The results for an incoming
0.1y beam position jitter are shown in Fig. 3.20. For each machine 200 consecutive
pulses were tracked, reproducing the number of pulses the IPBSM needs to compute
the beam size in ATF2. The error bars represent the standard error for 100 machines
and 200 pulses per machine. As noted earlier, the wakefield kicks are linear with
the beam intensity and the beam size at the IP has a quadratic dependence with
the intensity of the deflecting kicks, thus, the beam size at the IP has a quadratic
dependence with the beam intensity as seen in Fig. 3.19. A second order fit was
introduced to compare the different cases and an intensity-dependent parameter w
was defined as:
y
2  0y
(3.8)
with y the vertical beam size at the IP, Q the beam intensity, and 
0y the vertical
beam size at the IP at zero beam intensity (i.e. considering no wakefield sources).
The ATF2 incoming beam position and angle jitter amplitudes are uncertain. In
order to study the full spectrum of possibilities, the effects of amplitudes between

0.1 and 0.5 y for the position jitter and between 0.1 and 0.5 y for the angle one
were simulated. Figures 3.21 and 3.22 show, respectively, the impact of the position
jitters and the angle jitters on the vertical beam size at the IP (y ). The error bars
represent the standard error for 100 machines and 200 pulses per machine. One can
conclude that the position jitter has a higher impact not just on the average beam
sizes at each beam intensity, but also on the intensity-dependent parameter. Indeed,
for an incoming position jitter of 0.5y, the intensity-dependent parameter is equal
to 5.91  0.99 nm/109 e compared to 3.33  0.25 nm/109 e for an incoming angle
jitter of 0.5y .
In reality, the beam is injected with both position and angle jitters at the same

time. The effect of both jitters was studied considering the previous static imperfec-
tions and corrections but this time with position and angle jitter amplitudes from 0.1
to 1.0 y and 0.1 to 1.0 y respectively. The impacts of such jitters on the vertical
beam size at the IP are shown in Fig. 3.23. The error bars represent the standard
error for 100 machines and 200 pulses per machine.
Only the impact of incoming vertical jitters was considered so far. In the real
machine, the beam arrives with position and angle jitters in both the vertical and
horizontal planes. The previous static imperfections and corrections were taken into
account for these simulations. The beam was injected in the ATF2 extraction line
with incoming horizontal position and angle jitters of respectively 0.3x and 0.3x

Table 3.4 and Table 3.5 summarise respectively the impact of the angle and po-
sition jitters, separately at low and high intensity on the vertical beam size at the
IP, and the impact of the angle and position jitters simultaneously at low and high
intensity on the vertical beam size at the IP. Table 3.6 summarize the impact of the
statics and dynamic effects on the vertical beam size at the IP (y ) in function of the
beam intensity with wakefields calculated with PLACET.
In conclusion, static and dynamic errors have a significant impact on the vertical
beam size at the IP at high intensities, in the presence of wakefields. However dynamic
errors have a larger impact on the beam size. An initial position jitter of 0.5y leads to
increase of the average vertical beam size at the IP of 27% and 103% at respectively
0.1  1010 e and 1.0  1010 e. One can observe that when both jitters are taken
into account the impact of the incoming angle jitter is negligible. This is due to
the phase advance between the extraction kicker and the IP. Indeed, the impact of
a kick at a certain position translates into a position offset at the IP if the phase
advance is (n+1/2) between those two points. The vertical phase advance between
the extraction kicker and the IP is 8, thus the incoming angle offset translates into
an angle offset at the IP, making negligible its impact on the vertical beam size.
3.5 Wakefield knobs
In order to reduce the beam size growth due to wakefields, a system of wakefield knobs
was installed and tested in the beamline between BPMs MQD10AFF and MQF9AFF
(see Fig. 3.3). It consists of two C-BPMs on one mover and a bellows on a second
3.5. Wakefield knobs 46
mover as shown in Fig. 3.25. The idea is to scan the positions of these sources
independently. The performed 2D scan permits one to find the best position of each
mover that corrects the wakefield kicks generated by the previously studied wakefield
sources. The correction consists of creating a compensating wakefield kick of opposite
sign to the one generated by the beam line elements. The system was installed at
s=61.6 m, in a high- region to maximize the impact as shown in Fig. 2.1 and the
phase advance between the position of the system and the IP is 2.5 as shown in Fig.
2.5. This means that a wakefield kick at the position of the system will translate into a
position offset at the IP. The impact of this system was simulated with PLACET. The
following simulation conditions were used: misalignment of quadrupoles, C-BPMs and
sextupoles of 100 m RMS for 100 random seeds and One-to-one, DFS and first order
knobs at the IP. The position of each mover is scanned from -3000 m to 3000 m
with 20 steps. Figures 3.26 and 3.27 show the impact of the position scans of the
bellows and the C-BPM respectively on the vertical IP beam size (y ) in one machine
considering the other mover at zero. A 2D scan of the positions of the two sources
leads to a minimum beam size of 37 nm shown in Fig. 3.28. This correction was
tested with beam intensities from 0.1  1010 e to 1.0  1010 e. The impact of the
wakefield knobs and how it scales with the beam intensity is shown in Fig. 3.29. The
error bars represent the standard error for 100 machines and 200 pulses per machine.
The correction is effective, decreasing the average vertical beam size at the IP (y )
for 100 machines from more than 61 nm to around 45 nm. As one can expect, the
impact of the mover with 2 C-BPMs is larger than the one with the bellows as shown
in Table 3.7. Thanks to the wakefield knobs, a vertical beam size at the IP of 37
nm was obtained for 16 machines at 1.0  1010 e. A histogram of the impact of the
wakefield knobs on the vertical beam size at the IP at 1.0  1010 e is shown in Fig.
3.30.

3.6 Bunch length impact with the beam intensity.
For all the previous ATF2 simulations, a 7 mm long bunch was considered. However,
bunch length measurements showed that the bunch length, z, depends on the beam
intensity. As will be discussed in section 4.1, z varies from 6.2 mm at 0.1  1010
e to 8.5 mm at 0.8  1010 e. In order to show the impact of the bunch length on
the intensity-dependent effects, the following simulation conditions were considered:
quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sextupoles have a misalignment of 100 m RMS and a
roll error of 200 rad RMS and the strength error of quadrupoles and sextupoles is
104 RMS. In this case again, One-to-one, DFS, WFS corrections and IP knobs are
applied on each machine. This is done for 100 machines and 200 pulses per machine
considering an incoming position jitter of 0.3y. The impact of taking into account
the correlation between the bunch length (z) and the beam intensity is shown in Fig.
3.31. The error bars represent the standard error for 100 machines and 200 pulses
per machine. As shown in section 4.1, the bunch length was measured for intensities
between 0.1  1010 e and 0.8  1010 e. The dashed line is the intensity-dependent
parameter fit defined in Eq. 3.8. The average vertical beam size at the IP is smaller
for a beam with a correlated bunch length at low intensity, 0.1  1010 e, since the
bunch length is smaller than 7 mm. However, at high intensity, 1.0  1010 e, since
the bunch is longer than 7 mm, the wakefield kick is larger, and thus the beam size
at the IP is 3 nm larger as shown in Fig. 3.32, which is not negligible. The error

3.7 Conclusion
The static and dynamic imperfections were studied with PLACET. The ATF2 goal
one target value of 37 nm is hard to obtain with realistic conditions at 1.01010 e with
the One-to-one, DFS, WFS corrections and the IP knobs. However, they decrease
the average vertical beam size drastically. Indeed, without applying any corrections,
the average vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines with static imperfections
is 138  86.2 m. However, in order to mitigate those effects, correction techniques
were implemented and tested, showing good results. One-to-one correction decreased
the average vertical beam size at the IP for 100 machines to 1220  337 nm. DFS and
WFS corrections squeezed the beam to 904  145 nm. Then, the IP knobs reduced
the beam size to 58.4  4.7 nm.
An average IP vertical beam size of 45.2  0.9 was obtained with static imper-
fections and after applying the One-to-one, DFS, WFS corrections, IP knobs and
wakefield knobs. Thanks to the wakefield knobs, the ATF2 goal one was achieved
for 16 machines at the nominal beam intensity of 1.0  1010 e/bunch in simulations.
This correction is promising for future ATF2 beam tuning operations.
These corrections were tested experimentally in the ATF2 machine and are described
in the next chapter.
Chapter 4
Measurements of
intensity-dependent effects in
In order to measure the intensity-dependent effects and to compare them with simu-
lations, different sets of measurements were done in the ATF2 beam line.
4.1 Impact of the intensity on the bunch length
The bunch length was obtained by using a streak camera to measure the time structure
of the synchrotron radiation from one of the bending magnets in the arcs of the ATF2
damping ring [58]. Light emitted by synchrotron radiation in the ATF2 damping ring
passes through a system of three mirrors and two lenses before arriving at the streak
camera as shown in Fig. 4.1. The source point is located 270 mm downstream of the
entrance edge of a bending magnet at the end of the west arc of the damping ring.
The first mirror, made of aluminum-coated copper, reflects the synchrotron radiation
light by 90 upward. The light is then reflected by a second mirror and focused by
passing through the first lens. Then, it is reflected by a third mirror and passes
through the second lens to focus the light before it arrives at the streak camera. The
second lens has a rotating filter which can be used to reduce or increase the intensity
of the light received by the streak camera.
In order to measure the bunch length, the shutter of the camera and the gain were
set up and remained constant for the rest of the measurement. The chosen parameters
were 20 ms for the shutter and 27 for the gain. The amount of light arriving at the
camera, also called area, was kept constant using the filtered lens. An example of
an observed streak image is shown in Fig. 4.2. The bunch length was measured for 15

beam intensities, ranging from 0.11010 e to 0.81010 e. The measurements were
repeated on two separate days. The estimated bunch length, average of 10 bunches
per beam intensity, is shown in Fig. 4.3. The error bars represent the standard error
for 10 consecutive bunch length measurements for each beam intensity.
The conclusion is that the bunch length, z, varies from 6.2 mm at 0.1  1010 e
to 8.5 mm at 0.81010 e. This result matches measurements from 2004 [29] and the
model established in 2001 [59] for calculation of the intra-beam scattering effects in
the ATF damping ring.

4.2 Machine and beam instabilities
ATF2 is a test facility and is suffers from different types of instabilities and drifts
such as slow orbit drifts, beam intensity and beam energy drifts.
4.2.1 Slow beam orbit drift
The orbit drift, with a period of a few hours, makes the beam unstable and the
beamline needs to be re-tuned regularly. Figure 4.4 shows the vertical orbit at two
selected BPMs over a few hours. The orbit drift varies from a few m to a few tenths
of m. The vertical orbit spread is due to the beam orbit jitter.
Figure 4.4: Vertical orbit at two selected BPMs: QD10AFF and QF9AFF. 50000
pulses travel in ATF2 in 4h27.
4.2. Machine and beam instabilities 56
4.2.2 Beam intensity drift
As shown in Fig. 4.5, the beam intensity can drift by 2.0  109 e in a few hours.
One reason for this drift is the temperature drift during the day for the long period
oscillations and the temperature of the damping ring for the short period oscillations.
Figure 4.6 shows the correlation between the variation of the beam intensity and the
air temperature inside the damping ring.
Figure 4.5: ATF2 beam intensity drift, measured by the Integrated Current Trans-
former located near the IP.

rent Transformer located near the IP and the air temperature in the damping ring
(right-hand side).
4.3. Measurement of the incoming position and angle jitters 57
4.2.3 Dispersion drift
The dispersion drift is due to the fluctuation of the beam energy coupled with the
kick of the extraction kicker. The vertical dispersion (y) was measured four times.
One can observe in Fig. 4.7 that the vertical dispersion drifts away from its target
value of zero. After 6:30 hours, close to the IP, the vertical dispersion drifted by
38 mm.

4.3 Measurement of the incoming position and an-
gle jitters
As explained in Sec. 2.2.3, three BPMs are located in the ATF2 upstream area: P1,
P2 and P3. They were used to measure the vertical and horizontal beam positions
with a resolution of 157  8 nm at 0.821010 e [60]. In November 2018, the upstream
beam position and angle jitters were measured. The vertical position was measured
for 400 consecutive pulses each for beam intensities in the range0 0.111010 e to
0.791010 e, shown in Fig. 4.8. The position resolution of those three stripline
BPMs is better with a higher beam intensity [44]. The measured upstream vertical
position jitter at 0.791010 e is 0.9 m at P1, 1.4 m at P2 and 0.8 m at P3.

Figure 4.8: Vertical position beam jitters at upstream BPMs P1, P2 and P3 vs. beam

In order to extrapolate the incoming jitter to other locations in ATF2, the orbit
was calculated using transfer matrices. Let the initial beam have a vertical position
jitter of y0, an initial angle jitter of y
0 and an initial energy jitter of 0. If the vertical
position jitter, angle jitter and energy jitter at the BPM P3 are yP3, y
P3 and P3,
then the relationship between y0 and yP3 is given by:
= R0P3
(4.1)
with R0P3 the transfer matrix between the extraction of the damping ring and BPM
P3. y0 and y
0 are obtained simply by inverting the R0P3 matrix. The position and
angle jitters measured at P3 were 0.84 m and 1.07 rad respectively, and hence the
calculated incoming vertical position jitter using the transfer matrix from the model
is 1.3 m and 1.3 rad, respectively.
The measured beam position at one of the first calibrated ATF2 striplines, MQF3X
(s=10.2 m) is shown in Fig. 4.9. This measurement was done at 0.651010 e. The
measured vertical jitter at this BPM was extrapolated to the jitter at the extraction
kicker and an incoming vertical jitter of 11.3 m for 1000 consecutive pulses was
calculated.
4.4. Impact of the intensity on the BPM resolution 59
Figure 4.9: Vertical position beam position at upstream stripline BPM MQF3X.
An incoming vertical position jitter of 6 m was considered in the simulations,
which is the average of the jitter measured by the FONT BPM and by the stripline.
This corresponding to 1.0y, with y the vertical beam size at the extraction kicker
if one considers the nominal incoming Twiss parameters. A similar amplitude was
considered for the incoming angle jitter, 1.0y , with y the vertical beam divergence
at the extraction kicker. However, as stated earlier, striplines and C-BPM resolutions
are strongly linked to the beam intensity as explained further in the next section.
4.4 Impact of the intensity on the BPM resolution
ATF2 employs two types of BPMs to measure the beam orbit: striplines and C-
BPMs. In general, C-BPMs have a better resolution than the striplines. In order to
calculate the resolution of each BPM, one can use the Model Independent Analysis
[61]. The purpose is to remove the correlations between all BPM measurements. The
correlation coefficients can be calculated as follows:



d1,1 d1,2  d1,N1
d2,1 d2,2  d2,N1
  
dM,1 dM,2  dM,N1



(4.2)
dk =Dk vk (4.3)
4.4. Impact of the intensity on the BPM resolution 60
With dik the measured beam orbit in BPM k for machine pulse i, M the number of
machine pulses, N the number of BPMs and vj the correlation coefficients between
BPMs and the one of interest, k. N  1 BPMs are considered for Dk and vk since the
orbit of BPM k is removed for the resolution calculation [61]. For a vertical angle
jitter of 0.8 m at P3, v can then be computed using:
vk =D1k 
dk (4.4)
One defines
Rk the position residuals vector as:
dk Dk vk (4.5)
Finally, the resolution of BPM k, k, is as follows:
Mi R
(4.6)
This resolution depends on the beam intensity q. It can be characterized by:
+B2 (4.7)
with A an amplitude and B a constant error associated with mechanical motion and
electronics noise [62]. Figure 4.10 shows, for one of the cavity BPM, MQD4AFF,
the vertical resolution and how it evolves with the beam intensity. The calculated
vertical resolution is around 350 nm at low beam intensity (0.1  1010 e) and 68 nm
at a higher beam intensity (0.47  1010 e). This is the best BPM in the beamline.
This resolution calculation can also be used to find if there is any problem with BPMs
along the line. Figure 4.11 shows the resolution of BPMs along the line. One can
easily see where are the stripline BPMs. They have a poorer resolution (few microns)
than cavity BPMs (tens of nanometers). Striplines are located from s=0 m to s=25,
at s=31.7 m and s=32.7 . C-BPMs are located at s=27.7 m, s=29.2 m and s=30.6 m
and from s=34.8 m to the end of the line.

However, the measured beam orbit is correlated with the beam intensity. In order
to quantify this correlation, a mathematical factorisation was used and is explained
in the next section.

4.5 Impact of the intensity on the beam orbit
4.5.1 Correlation between beam orbit and beam intensity
using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method of factorisation of a rectangular
matrix [61, 63, 64]. Given D, a N M matrix, then the singular value decomposition
of D exists and is a factorization of the form:
D = USV T (4.8)
where:
U is a M M orthogonal matrix,
S is a M N diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and
V t is a transpose of a N N orthogonal matrix.
The diagonal values of S are the singular values, noted Sn. They are sorted from
the highest to the lowest values and they represent the strength of the correlations
between the data in D. A typical way to use SVD on the orbit is to store in the D
matrix the information as follows:
d1,1 d1,2  d1,N
d2,1 d2,2  d2,N
   
dM,1 dM,2  dM,N
(4.9)
where:
dik is the measured displacement in BPM k for machine pulse i,
M is the number of pulses, and
N is the number of BPMs.
The SVD of D gives information about correlations between the spatial parame-
ter, the beam position at BPMs, and the temporal parameter, the pulses. In order to
see the correlations between the beam position at BPMs and the beam intensity or
between consecutive pulses and the beam intensity, one can add the beam intensity
information in the last column of the Dq matrix as:
d1,1 d1,2  d1,N q1
d2,1 d2,2  d2,N q2
    
dM,1 dM,2  dM,N qM
(4.10)
4.5. Impact of the intensity on the beam orbit 63
where:
qi is the charge or beam intensity of pulse i.
The Dq matrix can then be written as follows:

u2,1 u2,2  u2,M
   
uM,1 uM,2  uM,M

In order to study the correlations between the vertical orbit in the ATF2 beamline
and the beam intensity, data were collected pulse by pulse. In the following case, the
beam intensity was increased step by step every 1000 pulses from 1.0  109 electrons
per bunch to 5.0  109 electrons per bunch as shown in Fig. 4.12.

The diagonal S matrix is shown in Fig. 4.13. In this case, a cut-off threshold for the
noise was assumed at log10(Sn) < 3. This means that only the 6 first singular values
were considered to be physical and the others are considered to be measurement noise.

(4.12)
Each row of the spatial matrix V represents the amplitude of the correlation be-
tween the same column of D and a particular singular value. For example, the element
Vij tells how strong is the correlation between the i-th BPM (or the beam intensity
for i = N +1) and the j-th singular value. The strength of the correlation corresponds
to the ranking of the singular values: the singular value ranking first corresponds to
the strongest correlation. Thus, the spatial matrix V contains the information on the
parameters that evolve with the orbit (betatron oscillations, dispersion, etc.). In this
case, for example, the second column displays a very good match with the nominal
dispersion through the ATF2 beamline, as shown in Fig. 4.14. The second singular
value amplitudes were scaled to the vertical dispersion measurements. This suggests
that the second singular value is associated with the beam energy variations.
The last row of the spatial matrix V represents the correlation between all singular
values and the beam intensity. This is shown in Fig. 4.15. While the data show, for
example, no correlation between the beam intensity and the second singular value,
namely decoupling bunch charge variations from beam energy variations, one can
observe a peak at the sixth singular value. This means that this singular value

One can now reconstruct the matrix Dq as Dq = USqV T , with Sq the diagonal
matrix keeping only the sixth singular value. Dq represents the difference in the
vertical orbit due to intensity-dependent effects for each BPM and pulse. Fig. 4.18
is a contour plot of the matrix Dq. The peaks show the locations where a strong
correlation is observed between the orbit and the beam intensity: four stripline BPMs,
MQD2X, MQF4X, MQD8X and MQD13X, corresponding to BPMs 4,6, 10 and 15
and two C-BPMs (MQM14FF and MQM12FF). This can mean two things, either the
BPM is not properly calibrated and then it needs to be calibrated or if it is calibrated,
then there is a strong wakefield source upstream of those BPMs or at those calibrated
BPMs.

4.6. Impact of the beam intensity on the beam size 68
In conclusion, the SVD data analysis permitted one to extract, from raw BPM
data, several physical parameters. If the beam intensity is added in the analysis, it
permits one to localize BPMs where a strong correlation between the vertical orbit
and the beam intensity is observed after filtering the noise part and to quantify the
size of the impact of wakefields on the vertical orbit. The beam intensity also has a
significant impact on the vertical beam size at the IP as explained in the next section.
4.6 Impact of the beam intensity on the beam size
The ATF2 beam size is measured with the IPBSM, as described in Sec. 2.2.1. For
each of the following experimental results, the beam had to be tuned manually. The
first- and second-order knobs were applied iteratively in order to decrease the vertical
IP beam size. As shown in Fig. 2.7, there are three laser crossing modes for the
IPBSM. The ranges of the measurable beam sizes are summarized in Table 4.1. The
2-8 mode can measure a beam size between 6 m and 360 nm. Tuning starts
with this mode. Then, when the beam is smaller than 400 nm, one can switch to
the 30 mode and continue the tuning until the beam size is smaller than 80 nm.
Tuning is finally done after switching to the 174 mode.

Numerous measurements were done in order to study the intensity-dependent effects
in ATF2. Most of them were done at 30 mode. Figure 4.19 shows an example
of measurements of y vs. the beam intensity without applying DFS and WFS
corrections and wakefield knobs, done at 30 mode. 200 pulses were required to
measure each beam size. The error bars represent the error due the IPBSM laser
jitter, the beam orbit jitter and other types of errors, explained in [40]. The intensity
dependence parameter w is 21.51  1.49 nm/109 e. This means that the vertical IP
beam size would be 110 nm larger at 11010 e than at 0.11010 e.
4.7 Mitigation strategies
4.7.1 Dispersion Free Steering
In order to reduce the intensity-dependent effects and to make the machine more
stable, mitigation techniques and corrections were implemented and tested in ATF2.
As in the simulations, the Dispersion Free Steering correction uses the ATF2 extrac-
tion line steering magnets or correctors to correct the difference in the orbit due to
dispersion. A script was implemented in order to automatically calculate the impact
of kicks at different positions on the orbit and build the response matrix. This matrix
is (N M) with N the number of steering magnets and M the number of BPMs.
A first response matrix is calculated with a beam at the nominal beam energy of
1.28 GeV. A second response matrix is calculated for a beam with a higher energy of
1.2817 GeV.
The DFS script finds a combination of corrector kicks that minimizes the impact of
a change of energy and corrects the orbit at the same time. The results are shown in
Fig. 4.20 and Fig. 4.21. In the horizontal plane, the goal is to make the dispersion as
close as possible to the target (in red). In the vertical plane, the goal is to minimize
the dispersion in the line. In both planes, the DFS correction decreases the impact
of dispersion on the orbit and thus makes the machine more stable.

4.7.2 Wakefield Free Steering (WFS)
The Wakefield Free Steering works like DFS but uses the beam intensity instead of
the beam energy. The first WFS response matrix is computed for a beam intensity
of 2.0  109 electrons. The second WFS response matrix is computed for a beam
intensity of 6.0109 electrons. As in DFS, the strength of the correctors is calculated
in order to reduce the impact of wakefields on the beam orbit. Figure 4.22 shows the
convergence of the WFS correction. After 10 iterations, the norm of the difference
between the vertical orbit at high intensity, 6.0  109 electrons (yHQ) and at low
intensity, 2.0  109 electrons, (yLQ) defined as yHQ  yLQ =
  yHQ  yLQ 2, at
each BPM, is decreased by more than 30%. This means that, on average, at each
BPM, the impact of wakefields on the vertical orbit was decreased by 12 m.

4.7.3 Impact of DFS and WFS on the vertical IP beam size
After applying DFS and WFS corrections, the machine should be less sensitive to dis-
persion and wakefields. In Fig. 4.23 is shown the impact of DFS and WFS the vertical
beam size at the IP y . For each beam size measurement, 200 consecutive pulses are
taken into account. The error bars represent the standard error for 200 pulses. In
conclusion, the DFS and WFS corrections reduced the intensity dependence param-
eter from 22.39  1.18 nm/109 e to 15.04  2.02 nm/109 e. Intensity-dependent
effects on the beam size at the IP were clearly decreased.

4.7.4 Wakefield knobs
As described in 3.5, a wakefield knobs system was implemented inside the ATF2 beam
line. The measurements are similar to what is done in simulations. The position of
the mover with two C-BPMs was first scanned, then the position of the mover with
the bellows. This was done iteratively in order to find the best position of those
two movers. A few iterations of these measurements are shown in Fig. 4.24. First,
the position of the bellows mover is scanned and a minimum beam size of 200 nm is
achieved as shown in Fig. 4.24a. The position of the C-BPMs mover is then scanned
and decrease the vertical IP beam size (y ) to 180 nm as shown in Fig. 4.24b. A
second iteration of the bellows mover is then applied to obtain a beam size of 160
nm as shown in Fig. 4.24c. Finally, a beam size of 150 nm is reached with a second
iteration of the C-BPMs mover as shown in Fig. 4.24d. These scans were done at
0.77  1010 e. The impact of the wakefield corrections is shown in Fig. 4.25. The
error bars represent the standard error for 200 pulses. One has to note that the
wakefield correction was applied on an uncorrected machine and not after applying
DFS and WFS because of issues in the beamline during the measurement. The
intensity-dependent parameter was decreased from 27.13  1.40 nm/109 e to 14.51
 1.26 nm/109 e. This wakefield knob system seems efficient to reduce the impact
of wakefield kicks and the intensity-dependent effects in general. It offers freedom in
the correction with two movers and two different wakefield sources.

4.8 Comparison between simulations and measure-
ments
In order to compare simulations and measurements, the vertical IP beam size was
measured at 174 mode after spending a long time tuning the beam and applying
corrections. Figure 4.26 shows that at low beam intensity, 0.1  1010 e, a vertical
IP beam size of 57 nm was obtained and at a higher beam intensity, 0.4  1010 e,
the vertical IP beam size was 72 nm. The error bars represent the standard error
for 200 pulses. The measured intensity-dependent parameter was w = 13.76  1.59
nm/109 e. These measurements are compared with PLACET simulation considering
the following simulation conditions: quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sextupoles have a
misalignment of 100 m RMS and a roll error of 200 rad RMS, the strength error
of quadrupoles and sextupoles is 104 RMS. One-to-one, DFS, WFS corrections and
IP knobs are applied on the machine. This is done for 100 machines and 200 pulses
per machine. The incoming position jitter is 1.0y and the incoming angle jitter is
1.0y . The simulated intensity-dependent parameter was w = 13.78  0.34 nm/109
e. These results are summarized in Table 4.2.

In conclusion, measurements in the ATF2 beamline permitted to quantify and
mitigate the intensity-dependent effects. The bunch length is increasing from 6 mm
at 0.1 1010 e to 8.5 mm at 0.8 1010 e in ATF2. The orbit, dispersion and beam
intensity drifts have been measured and the temperature oscillation leads to a short
period drift of the beam intensity. The incoming position jitter was measured with
both FONT and ATF2 stripline-BPMs. The conclusion is that the incoming vertical
position jitter is around 6 m, which represents 1.0y. The BPMs vertical resolution

was measured for each BPM, with an average of 600 nm for C-BPMs at 0.5 1010
e, with a minimum of 68 nm at BPM MQD4AFF. The SVD analysis permitted to
reconstruct the correlation matrix Dq in order to localise the sources of wakefields
or the uncalibrated BPMs. The DFS and WFS corrections lead to a decrease of the
dispersion in both planes and reduce the intensity-dependent parameter from 22.39 
1.18 nm/109 e to 15.04  2.02 nm/109 e. The wakefield knob corrections also showed
some promising results, decreasing the intensity-dependent parameter from 27.13 
1.40 nm/109 e to 14.51  1.26 nm/109 e. ATF2 PLACET realistic simulations
considering the number of wakefield sources, their localisation, their wakepotential,
the static and dynamic imperfections but also the impact of the One-to-one, DFS,
WFS corrections and the IP and wakefield knobs, reproduce what was measured in
the ATF2 beamline. The measured intensity-dependent parameter was 13.76  1.59
nm/109 e and the simulated one was 13.78  0.34 nm/109 e.
The intensity-dependent effects due to wakefields were studied in both ILC and
CLIC using the same wakefield implementation than in ATF2. The results are pre-
sented in the next two chapters. The good match between PLACET simulations and
measurements in ATF2 makes the results on ILC and CLIC more trustworthy.

5.1 ILC BDS 250 GeV
5.1.1 Beam and machine parameters
The 250 GeV center-of-mass energy stage would be the first stage of the ILC. In
order to simulate the impact of wakefields in the ILC BDS, the latest official 500 GeV
lattice was translated from MAD (Methodical Accelerator Design) [65] to PLACET.
The MAD version was found on G. Whites Bitbucket [66]. The 250 GeV lattice was
obtained by scaling down the 500 GeV lattice. The ILC BDS final focus system is
based on local chromaticity correction (Section 2.1.3). For the 250 GeV ILC, the
vertical beam size at the IP is squeezed to 7.7 nm and a luminosity of 0.82  1034
cm2s1 is obtained [19]. At the end of the 2254 meter long BDS, as in ATF2, a
final doublet is used, with two strong quadrupoles, in order to focus the beam at the
IP. The vertical phase advance between the entrance of the BDS and the IP is 12,
which means that an incoming angle offset will translate into an angle offset at the
IP and an incoming position offset will translate into a position offset at the IP. The
horizontal and vertical phase advances and the Twiss functions in the ILC 250 GeV
BDS are shown in Fig. 5.1. The ILC 250 GeV main parameters are summarized in
Table 5.1.

5.1.2.1 Efficiency of Beam-Based Alignment corrections
The efficiency of the Beam-Based Alignment correction and knobs in the ILC BDS
was studied with PLACET. A Gaussian beam comprised of 2.0  1010 electrons and
30,000 macro-particles was tracked from the entrance of the BDS to the IP. As in
ATF2, the ILC 101 C-BPMs generate wakefield kicks. The positions of those BPMs
are listed in Appendix B. The wakepotential of these C-BPMs was calculated using
GdfidL for a 300 m long bunch and is shown in Fig. 5.2. Imperfections are taken
into account: misalignment and roll error of quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sextupoles by
respectively 50 m RMS and 200 rad RMS and a quadrupole, and sextupole strength
error of 1.0  104. These values are based on the studies done in [67]. 100 machines
were studied and the same corrections as in ATF2 were applied: One-to-one steering,
DFS, WFS and the following knobs: < y, x >, < y, y >, < y,E > and < y, x  x >,
< y, x  y > < y, x E >.

The impact of the corrections on the particle distribution at the IP for one machine is

average vertical IP beam y from 69.4  26.8 m without any correction to 9.43 
0.30 nm with One-to-one, DFS, WFS and knobs. In comparison, the vertical IP beam
size in a perfect machine is 7.7 nm.

5.1.2.2 Impact of static errors
In order to study the impact of static errors, the following simulation conditions were
used with PLACET: misalignment and roll error of quadrupoles, C-BPMs and sex-
tupoles by respectively 50 m RMS and 200 rad RMS and quadrupoles, sextupoles
strength error of 1.0  104. 100 machines were studied and the same corrections as
in ATF2 were applied: One-to-one, DFS, and the following knobs: < y, x >, < y, y >,
< y,E > and < y, x  x >, < y, x  y > < y, x  E >. This was done for intensities
between 2.0109 e and 2.0 1010 e. The impact of wakefields on the average vertical
IP beam size y is shown in Fig. 5.5 and summarized in Table 5.3. The error bars
represent the standard error for 100 machines. The beam size growth due to the
short-range wakefield is negligible if one considers all C-BPMs as wakefield sources.
Indeed, the growth between the vertical IP beam size at 2.0109e and 2.01010e is
0.03 nm, around 0.32 % of the nominal beam size. The effect is 430 times smaller
in the ILC 250 GeV BDS than in ATF2 considering this previously cited conditions
and imperfections. However, in reality, a bunch train made of 1312 bunches is travel-
ing in the ILC BDS. Each bunch feels the already studied short-range wakefield, but
consecutive bunches will also feel the long-range wakefields.

5.1.3 Multi-bunch simulations
5.1.3.1 Long range wakefield
In order to study the multi-bunch intensity dependence and dynamic imperfection
effects in the ILC BDS, one should consider long-range wakefields such as those gen-
erated by resistive walls. The ILC BDS beam aperture profile is shown in Fig. 5.6.
It has an aperture between 10 mm and 30 mm. The resistive walls wakepotential Wl
used in the simulations is defined as follows [68][69]:
Wl(z) = 
L (5.1)
where b is the radius of the beam pipe, Z0 is the impedance of the vacuum, r the
conductivity of the pipe, L the length of the beam line segment. In the ILC BDS, the
5.1. ILC BDS 250 GeV 83
bunch separation is 554 ns and there are 1312 consecutive bunches. Thus, the length
of the bunch train is 217.9 km. In Fig. 5.7 is shown the calculated wakepotential for
the ILC BDS resistive walls, considering a copper beam pipe and a beam pipe radius
of 10 mm for the length of a train (218 km) and for the length of the ILC BDS
( 2254 m). A corresponding wakepotential was calculated and used as a wakefield
source for each beam pipe aperture.

5.1.3.2 Impact of long-range wakefields for a train with a constant in-
coming offset
Given that the kick due to long-range wakefields is uniform on one whole bunch, one
can consider just one macro-particle per bunch. This macro-particle represents the
barycenter of this bunch and carries the full charge of the bunch. The effects of the
resistive walls with PLACET were simulated using one macro-particle per bunch. The
consecutive 1312 bunches of the ILC train were injected in a perfectly aligned machine
with the same offset. The bunches were tracked all the way to the IP where the orbit
of each bunch was calculated. This study was done for initial offsets of 0.01y, 0.05y
and 0.1y in position and 0.1y in angle (where y and y are respectively the beam
size and beam divergence at the entrance of the BDS). In Fig. 5.8 and Fig. 5.9 are
shown the vertical orbit difference (y) between the first bunch and the last bunch
of a train at the IP for five different beam intensities for respectively an incoming
position offset of 0.1y and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y . The conclusion is
that the impact of dynamic error is significant. Indeed, the last bunch of a train
gets deflected by more than 3.0 nm for an incoming position offset of 0.1y and by
19.9 nm for an incoming angle offset of 0.1y at 1.0  1010 e. The orbit deflection
increases linearly with the bunch number. The IP vertical orbit deflection also scales
with the amplitude of the error as shown in Fig. 5.10. In order to quantify more
easily the impact of dynamic errors, one can use the vertical orbit deflection at the IP
(y) normalised by the vertical IP beam size (
y ), in this case 
y =7.7 nm. Figure
5.11 shows the impact of an incoming position offset of 0.01y and an angle offset
of 0.01y on the vertical orbit deflection at the IP and how it scales with the beam
intensity. These offset values are in the order of magnitude of the ones calculated
for CLIC [70, 71]. At 2.0  1010 e, the last bunch of the train is deflected by 1.85y
compared to the first one. In reality, the incoming jitter will also have a horizontal
component. The impact of an incoming position offset of 0.01x and an angle offset
of 0.01x in the horizontal plane and 0.01y and 0.01y in the vertical plane on the
vertical orbit deflection at the IP is shown in Fig. 5.12. In this case, at 2.0  1010 e,
the last bunch of the train is deflected by 4.15y compared to the first one.

5.1.3.3 Impact of long-range wakefields for a train with random incoming
offset
A different approach is to consider incoming consecutive bunches of a train with a
random incoming offset. Indeed, the incoming jitter could fluctuate due to different
sources like the vibration of quadrupole magnets, strength jitter of quadrupole and
dipole magnets, etc. [72]. In this study, incoming consecutive 1312 bunches were
injected with normally distributed position and angle offsets between -5% and 5%
with an average of zero [73]. The distribution of the incoming offsets is shown in
Fig. 5.13. This offset distribution was used for the incoming horizontal and vertical
position and angle jitters and multiplied by the corresponding values of x, x , y
and y . The resulting vertical vertical orbit deflection between the first and last
bunch is shown in Fig. 5.14. The effects of random incoming offsets lead to kicks
compensating each other inside the ILC BDS, resulting in a small orbit deflection
at the IP. The last bunch of a train is deflected by 0.065y , or 0.501 nm, which is
negligible compared to the beam size of 7.7 nm.

PLACET with resistive wall effects included.
5.1.3.4 Impact of long-range wakefields on the luminosity
The quality of the delivered electron and positron beams is quantified by the lumi-
nosity at the IP. In order to study the impact of the previous dynamic imperfections,
5.1. ILC BDS 250 GeV 89
one considered that the tracked electron beam was colliding with a perfectly cen-
tered positron beam coming from the positron BDS. Thus, the vertical offset between
the two beams corresponds to the vertical orbit of the electron beam at the IP. The
calculations were done with the code GUINEA-PIG [74]. The resulting luminosity
degradation versus the relative offset of the colliding beams is shown in Fig. 5.15,
where L is the calculated luminosity and L0 = 0.82  1034 cm2 s1. The results of
the impact of incoming dynamic errors in the 250 GeV ILC BDS on the luminosity
are summarized in Table 5.4. At low beam intensity (2.0  109 e) the impact of an
incoming position or angle offset has a negligible impact on the luminosity. However,
at high beam intensity (2.0  1010 e), an incoming position offset of 0.1y leads to a
luminosity loss of 36% and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity loss
of 75%. For a train injected with both position and angle offsets of 0.1y and 0.1y
respectively, the luminosity loss is 47%. Last but not least, a train injected with a
position and angle offsets in both planes of 0.1 leads to a luminosity loss of 64%.
However, if one considers random offset around zero, it seems that the long-range
wakefield kicks are compensating each other which leads to a small vertical deflection
between the first bunch and the last bunch of the train at the IP, which makes it
negligible.

5.2 ILC BDS 500 GeV
5.2.1 Beam and machine parameters
The second phase of the ILC would be an upgrade to 500 GeV center-of-mass energy.
For the 500 GeV ILC, the vertical beam size at the IP is squeezed to 5.9 nm and
a luminosity of 1.8  1034 cm2s1 is obtained [19]. The phase advances are slightly
different in the ILC 500 GeV BDS, compared to the 250 GeV one, but still around
12 between the entrance of the BDS and the IP. The phase advances and the Twiss
functions are shown in Fig. 5.16. The ILC 500 GeV main parameters are summarized
in Table 5.5.

5.2.2 Single-bunch simulations
5.2.2.1 Efficiency of Beam-Based Alignment corrections
The efficiency of the Beam-Based Alignment correction and knobs in the 500 GeV
ILC BDS was studied with PLACET. As in the 250 GeV BDS, a Gaussian beam made
of 2.0  1010 electrons and 30,000 macro-particles was tracked from the entrance of
the ILC BDS to the IP. The simulation conditions are the same as in Section 5.1.2.1.
The impact of the corrections on the particles distribution at the IP for one machine
is shown in Fig. 5.17. The results of the corrections on the vertical beam size at the
IP (y ) for 100 machines are shown in Fig. 5.18 and are summarized in Table 5.6.

The whole procedure in the 500 GeV BDS reduces the average vertical IP beam

0.30 nm with One-to-one, DFS, WFS and knobs, really close to the beam size in the
perfect machine, 5.9 nm.
5.2.2.2 Impact of static errors
In order to study the impact of the short-range wakefields and static errors, the same
simulations were done in the 500 GeV BDS. The simulation conditions are the the
same as in Section 5.1.2.2. The impact of wakefields on the average vertical IP beam
size y is shown in Fig. 5.19 and summarized in Table 5.7.

The beam size growth due to the short-range wakefield is also rather small in the
500 GeV BDS if one considers all C-BPMs as wakefield sources. Indeed, the growth
between the vertical IP beam size at 2.0109e in a bunch and 2.01010e is 0.04 nm,
less than 0.7 % of the nominal beam size of 5.9 nm.
5.2.3 Multi-bunch simulations
5.2.3.1 Impact of long-range wakefields for a train with a constant in-
coming offset
The same multi-bunch studies were done for the 500 GeV BDS. The beam was injected
with offsets of 0.01y, 0.05y and 0.1y in position and 0.1y in angle. In Fig. 5.20
and Fig. 5.21 are shown the vertical orbit differences between the first bunch and the
last bunch of a train at the IP (y) for five different beam intensities for respectively
an incoming position offset of 0.1y and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y . The
impact of dynamic error is significant. Indeed, the last bunch of a train gets deflected
by more than 3.1 nm for an incoming position offset of 0.1y and by 32.6 nm for an
incoming angle offset of 0.1y at 2.0  1010 e. The IP vertical orbit deflection also
scales with the amplitude of the error as shown in Fig. 5.22. Figure 5.23 shows the
impact of an incoming position offset of 0.1y and an angle offset of 0.1y on the
vertical orbit deflection at the IP and how it scales with the beam intensity. The last
bunch of the train is deflected by 0.6y compared to the first one at 2.0  1010 e.
The impact of an incoming position offset of 0.01x and an angle offset of 0.01x in
5.2. ILC BDS 500 GeV 95
the horizontal plane and 0.01y and 0.01y in the vertical plane on the vertical orbit
deflection at the IP is shown in Fig. 5.24. In this case, the last bunch of the train is
deflected by 1.51y compared to the first one at 2.0  1010 e.

PLACET with resistive wall effects included.
5.2. ILC BDS 500 GeV 98
As in the 250 GeV BDS, in order to study the impact of a train with random jitter,
the incoming consecutive 1312 bunches were injected with normally distributed offsets
between -5% and 5% with an average of zero [73]. The resulting vertical vertical orbit
deflection between the first and last bunch is shown in Fig. 5.25. The last bunch of a
train is deflected by 0.003 y , or 0.015 nm, which is negligible compared to the beam
size of 5.9 nm.
5.2.3.3 Impact of long-range wakefields on the luminosity
As in the 250 GeV BDS, the previously studied electron beam was collided with
a perfectly centered positron beam coming from the positron BDS. The resulted
luminosity degradation versus the relative offset of the colliding beams is shown in Fig.
5.26, where L0 = 1.8  1034 cm2 s1. The results of the impact of incoming dynamic
errors in the 500 GeV ILC BDS on the luminosity are summarized in Table 5.8. As
in the 250 GeV BDS, at low beam intensity (2.0  109 e) the impact of an incoming
position or angle offset has a negligible impact on the luminosity. However, at high
beam intensity (2.01010 e), an incoming position offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity
loss of 18% and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity loss of 68%. For
a train injected with both position and angle offsets of 0.1y and 0.1y respectively,
the luminosity loss is 20%. Last but not least, a train injected with a position and
angle offsets in both planes of 0.1 leads to a luminosity loss of 41%. In the ILC
500 GeV BDS, the impact of incoming random offsets around zero is also negligible.
Thus, the deflection of one bunch in the train between the entrance of the BDS and
the IP is rather small, 0.06 nm in this case. The resulting luminosity loss is then
negligible.
Those results are obtained if no correction is applied. In the ILC, the bunch separation
is large, so, in realty, such a position drift at the IP could be compensated with an
intra-train feedback, diminishing its effects on the luminosity.
In conclusion, the intensity-dependent effects due to short-range wakefields are
negligible in both the 250 and 500 GeV ILC BDS. The intensity-dependent parame-
ter is around 0.04 nm/109 e for both energies, representing an increase on the vertical
beam size at the IP of 0.03 nm and 0.04 nm for 250 GeV and 500 GeV respectively.
However, the intensity-dependent effects due to long-range wakefields have a signifi-
cant impact on the luminosity. Indeed, at 2.01010 e, the impact of incoming vertical
and horizontal position offsets of 0.01y and 0.01x, respectively, and incoming verti-
cal and horizontal angle offsets of 0.01y , 0.01x , respectively leads to a luminosity
5.2. ILC BDS 500 GeV 99
loss of 64% in the 250 GeV BDS and of 41% in the 500 GeV BDS. The beam in the
500 GeV case is stiffer than in the 250 GeV case, the effects are then smaller.

However, the bunch separation is large in the ILC, thus the bunch-to-bunch position
and angle offsets caused by dynamic effects can be corrected with intra-train IP
position and angle feedback corrections. They are applied using a stripline kicker
located near the IP. The impact of such a system was studied and the conclusions are
reassuring, it can recover more than 90% of the luminosity [45, 75, 76].

The CLIC 380 GeV center-of-mass energy stage would be the first stage of CLIC.
The Twiss functions and the CLIC BDS 380 GeV main parameters are shown in
Fig. 6.1 and Table 6.1. The main differences between the ILC and CLIC BDS for the
wakefield studies are the bunch population, four times smaller, the bunch length, 4.3
times smaller and the bunch separation, 1108 times smaller. The CLIC BDS final
focus system is also based on the local chromaticity correction seen in Section 2.1.3.

6.1.1 Single-bunch simulations
6.1.1.1 Efficiency of base based alignment corrections
As for the ILC BDS, the effect of the Beam-Based Alignment correction and knobs
in the CLIC BDS was studied with PLACET. A Gaussian beam comprising 5.2109
electrons and 30,000 macro-particles was tracked from the entrance of the CLIC BDS
to the IP. The 134 BPMs used in CLIC are X-band BPMs [77]. The positions of the
CLIC BPMs are listed in Appendix C and their geometry is shown in Fig. 6.3. The
6.1. CLIC 380 GeV BDS 103
wakepotential of these BPMs was calculated using GdfidL for a 70 m long bunch
and is shown in Fig. 6.4. For the static imperfections in the CLIC BDS, the following
numbers were taken into account: misalignment of quadrupoles, BPMs and sextupoles
by 50 m RMS, roll error for quadrupoles, BPMs and sextupoles by 200 rad RMS
and quadrupole, sextupole strength error of 1.0  104 RMS. This is larger to the
ones considered in the FFS [78] since aligning the BPMs and magnets in the whole
BDS would be harder [79]. 100 machines were studied and the same corrections as
in ATF2 were applied: One-to-one, DFS, and the following knobs: < y, x >, < y, y >,
< y,E > and < y, x  x >, < y, x  y > < y, x  E >. Those corrections use a
slightly different technique than the one used in ATF2 or in ILC. Indeed, in CLIC, all
quadrupole magnets and BPMs would be on movers. Thus, the orbit correction would
be based on moving the magnets and the BPMs and not by changing the strength of
steering magnets [80]. Hence, if the beam travels through the center of a quadrupole
it experiences no dipolar kick and thus the downstream trajectory remains unchanged
if the strength of the quadrupole magnets is changed. The beam can then be centered
in the quadrupole by finding a position where changing the strength of the quadrupole
gives a minimum difference in beam position at a downstream BPM. Ideally there
should not be any other magnetic elements between the quadrupole and the closest
downstream BPM.

One-to-one and DFS corrections reduce the average vertical IP beam size for 100
machines y from 706  161 nm without any correction to 137  38 nm. Then, the
IP knobs squeeze y to 4.82  0.57 nm. In comparison, the vertical IP beam size in
a perfect machine is 2.9 nm.
6.1.1.2 Impact of static errors
The impact of static errors were simulated in the CLIC 380 GeV BDS the same way as
was done in ATF2 and in the ILC BDS. The following simulation conditions were used
with PLACET: misalignment and roll error of quadrupoles, BPMs and sextupoles by
respectively 50 m RMS and 200 rad RMS and quadrupoles, sextupoles strength
6.1. CLIC 380 GeV BDS 106
error of 1.0  104. 100 machines were studied and the following corrections were
applied: One-to-one, DFS, and the following knobs: < y, x >, < y, y >, < y,E >
and < y, x  x >, < y, x  y > < y, x  E >. This was done for intensities between
5.2108 e and 5.2 109 e in order to show the intensity-dependent effects. The
impact of wakefields on the average vertical IP beam size y is shown in Fig. 6.7 and
summarized in Table 6.3. The beam size growth due to the short-range wakefield is
larger than in the ILC BDS if one considers all CLIC BPMs as wakefield sources.
Indeed, at 5.2108e bunch charge, the growth between the vertical IP beam size and
5.2109e is 0.47 nm, around 9.8 %. This is due to the fact that the 134 CLIC C-
BPMs have a wakepotential peak of 0.71 V/pC/mm compared to 0.16 V/pC/mm for
the 101 ILC C-BPMs. In reality, a bunch train is made of 352 bunches is traveling in
the CLIC BDS, hence one also has to take into account long-range wakefield effects.

wakepotential due to resistive walls was calculated using Eq. 5.1. The CLIC BDS
copper coated beam pipe has an aperture between 15 mm and 74.5 mm. The CLIC

6.1. CLIC 380 GeV BDS 108
In the CLIC BDS, the bunch separation is 0.5 ns and there are 352 consecutive
bunches. Thus, the length of the bunch train is 52.8 m. In Fig. 6.9 is shown the
calculated wakepotential for the CLIC BDS resistive walls, considering a copper beam
pipe and a beam pipe radius of 15 mm for the length of a train (53 m) and for the
length of the CLIC BDS (1949 m).
The same multi-bunch studies were done for the CLIC 380 GeV BDS. Initial offsets
of 0.01y, 0.05y and 0.1y in position and 0.1y in angle were considered [79]. In
Fig. 6.10 and Fig. 6.11 are shown the vertical orbit difference (y) between the
first bunch and the last bunch of a train at the IP for five different beam intensities
for respectively an incoming position offset of 0.1y and an incoming angle offset of
0.1y . The conclusion is that the impact of long-range wakefields is significant in the
CLIC BDS as well. Indeed, the last bunch of a train gets deflected by 2.79 nm for
an incoming position offset of 0.1y and by 1.71 nm for an incoming angle offset of
0.1y at 5.2  109 e. The orbit deflection increases linearly with the bunch number.
The IP vertical orbit deflection also scales with the amplitude of the error as shown
in Fig. 6.12. An incoming train with an incoming position offset of 0.01y leads to
a vertical orbit deflection at the IP of 0.28 nm. Figure 6.13 shows the impact of an
incoming position offset of 0.1y and an angle offset of 0.1y on the vertical orbit
deflection at the IP and how it scales with the beam intensity.

6.1.2.2 Impact of long-range wakefields for a train with random incoming
offset
As in the ILC BDS, in order to study the impact of a train with random jitter, the
incoming consecutive 352 bunches are injected with normally distributed position and
angle offsets between -5% and 5% with an average of zero. The distribution of the
incoming offsets is shown in Fig. 5.13. The resulting vertical vertical orbit deflection
between the first and last bunch is shown in Fig. 6.15. The effects of random incoming
offsets lead to kicks compensating each other inside the CLIC BDS, resulting in a small
orbit deflection at the IP. The last bunch of a train is deflected by 0.005 y , or 0.015
nm, which is negligible compared to the beam size of 2.9 nm.

PLACET with resistive walls.
6.1.2.3 Impact of long-range wakefields on the luminosity
As in the ILC BDS, the previously studied electron beam was collided with a per-
fectly centered positron beam coming from the positron BDS. The resulted luminosity
degradation versus the relative offset of the colliding beams is shown in Fig. 6.16,
where L is the calculated luminosity and L0 = 1.5  1034 cm2 s1 [24]. The results of
the impact of incoming dynamic errors in the 380 GeV CLIC BDS on the luminosity
are summarized in Table 6.4. At low beam intensity (0.52  109 e) the impact of an
6.1. CLIC 380 GeV BDS 112
incoming position or angle offset has a negligible impact on the luminosity. However,
at high beam intensity (5.2  109 e), an incoming position offset of 0.1y leads to a
luminosity loss of 16% and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity
loss of 9%. For a train injected with both position and angle offsets of 0.1y and
0.1y respectively, the luminosity loss is negligible. A train injected with a position
and angle offsets in both planes of 0.1 leads as well to a negligible luminosity loss.
In the CLIC 380 GeV BDS, the impact of incoming random offsets around zero is also
negligible due to consecutive bunches kicking in opposite directions, making the sum
of all those kicks close to zero. Thus, the deflection of one bunch in the train between
the entrance of the BDS and the IP is rather small, 0.015 nm in this case. The re-
sulting luminosity loss is then negligible. Those results were obtained if no correction
is applied. As in the ILC, such a position drift at the IP could be compensated with
an intra-train feedback, diminishing its effects on the luminosity [82, 83].

In conclusion, the intensity-dependent effects due to short-range wakefields are
rather small in the CLIC 380 GeV BDS but not negligible. The calculated intensity-
dependent parameter is around 0.39 nm/109 e, representing an increase on the verti-
cal beam size at the IP of 0.47 nm when increasing the intensity from 0.52109 e to
5.2  109 e, 16% of the nominal vertical beam size. The intensity-dependent effects
due to long-range wakefields have a significant impact on the luminosity. Indeed, at
5.2  109 e, an incoming position offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity loss of 16%
and an incoming angle offset of 0.1y leads to a luminosity loss of 9%. However, as
in the ILC, the bunch-to-bunch position and angle offsets caused by dynamic effects
can be corrected with intra-train IP position and angle feedback corrections. They
are applied using a stripline kicker located near the IP. It has been shown that it can
recover up to 50% of the luminosity [83].
Conclusions
Summary
The next ideal large particle collider for studying the Higgs, the so-called Higgs fac-
tory, would be a linear electron-positron collider. The efforts have been put on two
main projects, the ILC and CLIC. They are based on the same FFS with a local
chromatic correction in order to obtain nanometer-scale beams at the IP. In order
to obtain a beam which satisfies the requirements, the impact of static and dynamic
imperfections has to be taken into account. In ATF2, the test facility which studies
the feasibility of the FFS, these static and dynamic imperfections coupled with the
wakefield effects deteriorate the beam quality and increase the beam size at the IP.
They consist in the misalignment, the roll errors and the strength errors of magnets
and BPMs and in the incoming position and angle jitters.
In order to compensate for those imperfections, correction techniques are used.
Considering static imperfections, the impacts of One-to-One, DFS, and WFS correc-
tions and sextupole knobs showed that they can decrease the beam size by a factor
224 for ATF2, 7360 for the ILC 250 GeV, 5545 for the ILC 500 GeV and 147 for
the CLIC 380 GeV. Those corrections are necessary in order to correct the beam size
growth due to wakefields.
In ATF2, the extraction kicker injects the beam into the extraction line with
incoming position and angle jitters. The incoming position jitter has a significant
impact on the vertical beam size at the IP, making the primary ATF2 goal of achieving
a small vertical beam size at the IP of 37 nm, hard to achieve. The impact of static
and dynamic errors with wakefields were simulated in ATF2. The intensity-dependent
parameter w, measuring the impact of an increase of the beam intensity on the vertical
beam size at the IP, defined as w =
, was equal to 13.78  0.34 nm/109 e.
Measurements in ATF2 lead to an intensity-dependent parameter w of 13.76  1.59
nm/109 e with a tuned machine at 174  mode. This shows that the wakefield
effects were localised, computed and understood well in ATF2 with the tracking code
developed at CERN, PLACET.
To correct the intensity-dependent effects in ATF2, a few corrections were tested.
The DFS and WFS corrections lead to a decrease of w from 22.39  1.18 nm/109 e to
15.04  2.02 nm/109 e at 30 mode. It has to be noted that the amplitude of intensity-
dependent parameter w before applying corrections depends on the conditions of the
machine and varies from 20 to 28 nm/109 e.
The new wakefield knobs system was also tested. This comprised two wakefield
sources on movers, localised at 2.5  phase advance before the IP, at a high beta
region. This system decreases the intensity-dependent parameter from 27.1 nm/109
e to 14.5 nm/109 e. DFS and WFS corrections and wakefield knobs are necessary
steps in the ATF2 tuning procedure in order to achieve goal 1.
The impact of static and dynamic imperfections coupled with wakefields was also
studied in the ILC 250 GeV and 500 GeV BDS. Thanks to the One-to-One, DFS,
and WFS corrections and sextupole knobs, the achieved average vertical beam size
at the IP, at the nominal beam intensity of 2.01010 e, was 9.43 nm, close to the
design value of the perfect machine in the 250 GeV, 7.7 nm. For the 500 GeV BDS,
the vertical beam size at the IP was 6.06 nm, compared to 5.9 nm for the perfect
machine.
The short-range wakefield effects are negligible for both 250 and 500 GeV lattices.
The calculated intensity-dependent parameter was 0.04 nm/109 e, which represents
an increase of 0.03 nm between 0.21010 e and 2.01010 e for the 250 GeV BDS
and of 0.04 nm for the 500 GeV BDS. One-to-One, DFS, and WFS corrections and
sextupole knobs are imperative corrections in order to obtain small beam sizes that
satisfy the machine requirements.
However, the long-range wakefield effects are significant. Indeed, at 2.0  1010 e,
the impact of incoming vertical and horizontal position offsets of 0.01y and 0.01x,
respectively, and incoming vertical and horizontal angle offsets of 0.01y , 0.01x ,
respectively leads to a luminosity loss of 64% in the 250 GeV BDS and of 41% in the
500 GeV BDS.
However, the bunch separation is large in the ILC, thus the bunch-to-bunch po-
sition and angle offsets caused by dynamics effects can be corrected with intra-train
IP position and angle feedback corrections. They are applied using a stripline kicker
located near the IP. This would be a crucial correction in order to have a luminosity
loss smaller than 10%.
Thanks to the One-to-One, DFS, and WFS corrections and sextupole knobs, the
achieved average vertical beam size in the CLIC 380 GeV stage at the IP, at the
nominal beam intensity of 5.2109 e, was 4.8 nm, close to the design value of the
perfect machine, 2.9 nm. The calculated intensity-dependent parameter was 0.39
nm/109 e, which represents an increase of 0.47 nm between 0.52109 e and 5.2109
e, 16% of the beam size at the IP. In CLIC also, One-to-One, DFS, and WFS
corrections and sextupole knobs are indispensable corrections in order to obtain small
beam sizes that satisfy the machine requirements.
The long-range wakefield effects are not significant in the CLIC 380 GeV BDS.
Indeed, at 5.2109 e, the impact of incoming vertical and horizontal position offsets
of 0.01y and 0.01x, respectively, and incoming vertical and horizontal angle offsets
of 0.01y , 0.01x , leads to a luminosity loss of less than 0.5%.
Suggestions for further work
In order to reduce the intensity-dependent effects in ATF2, the implemented DFS and
WFS could be optimised by making them automatic and part of the tuning procedure
after the BPM calibration.
The ATF2 wakefield knobs could also be improved by making the 2D scan of the
movers and thus the positions that lead to a minimum vertical beam size at the IP
automatic. Different wakefield sources could also be employed in order to make this
correction more efficient.
The measured impact of the previously cited corrections was only done at 30
mode. It would be interesting to apply these corrections with a tuned and stable
machine at the 174 mode.
Due to some PLACET code limitations, the long-range wakefield studies were
done with one macro-particle per bunch in the BDS. An interesting study would
be look at multi-bunch and multi-particle long-range wakefield simulations from the
RTML to the IP.
The final suggestion would consist of studying the impact of the wakefield knobs
in CLIC and ILC.
