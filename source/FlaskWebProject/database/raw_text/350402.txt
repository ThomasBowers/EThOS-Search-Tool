" The seed has already done part of the job. It has 
packaged the major portion of the proteins of the cell 
into specific sites called protein bodies. All that is 
necessary, therefore, is to break open the cell, shake 
loose the packages and separate them from one another. "

ABSTRACT 
Data obtained using cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, L. fialp), to validate 
the equipment used for air classification showed that the feed rate of 
the air classifier (Alpine iOOMZR) and flour moisture content influenced 
fines yield. 
A calibration curve for the determination of separation cut size for 
17 settings of the air classifier, was derived from Coulter counter 
particle-size analysis of matched pairs of fines and coarse fractions. 
One other variety-of cowpea and two varieties each of fababean 
(Vicia faba, L. ) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajans, L. ) were also air- 
classified at selected separation. cut sizes. The protein content of the 
fines decreased, as separation cut sizeincreased, fababean giving the 
greatest (23 to 42%) and, cowpea the lowest (0.2 to 16%) protein shifts. 
Light microscopy showed that fababean flour contained a high proportion 
of large starch granules (> llUm) and cowpea-flours contained a high 
proportion of small starch granules (:  3.5pm). Large starch granules 
were excluded from the fines, whereas small starch granules entered the 
fines, acting as diluents to the protein. This was confirmed by starch 
analysis. Thus, starch-granule-size distribution was found to be a 
primary determinant of the suitability for air classification, of the 
starclVlegumes studied. 
The crude fibre content of the fines was significantly lower than 
the whole flourfor fababean and pigeonpea, but not for cowpea, whereas, 
the indications were, that hemicellulose fractionated into the fines of 
all the air-classified legume flours, excepting one variety of pigeonpea. 
Oligosaccharides concentrated in the finesfor flours of fababean and 
pigeonpea, but not of cowpea. Ash showed no difference in the fines 
of any of the legumes, compared with the whole flour, while the fate of 
sucrose was not clearly established. 
This thesis describes these and related investigations.

CHAPTER 1 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
Air classification is a technique for the dry separation of particles 
in finely-ground powders and flours, according to their size, density and 
shape. Recent studies have shown that air classification can be applied to 
starchy grain legumes (pulses), for separating and concentrating various 
components of the flours, into a protein-rich fraction called the fines, 
and a starch-rich fraction called the'coarse fraction. 
Grain legumes are protein plants which have been defined (Boulter, 1979) 
as those with 20% or more protein in their edible parts. They are recognised 
as important sources of protein in the diet of populations of many tropical 
areas of the world, where meat, milk, eggs and fish are in short supply 
(Bressani et al., 1973). The use of grain legumes in the diets of such 
populations aids the achievement of a good mixed diet. 
Leguminous grains provide 18.5% of the worlds'protein consumption 
(Boulter, 1979). The protein is rich in lysine but tends to be low in 
sulphur-containing amino acids. On a wet weight basis the content of 
protein in grain legumes is higher than that of milk, fish and eggs 
(Paul and Southgate, 1978). Cereals, which have a lower cont-ent of protein 
(approximately half that of grain legumes), provide 66% of the worlds' 
protein consumption. In contrast to grain legumes, the protein of cereals 
is low in lysine and is the limiting amino acid in diets based soletj on 
cereals. Grain legumes are therefore a natural supplement to cereals and 
most other staples. For each legume and cereal, there will be an optimum 
mixture which will supply protein of higher quality, than either of the 
two foods eaten alone (Doughty and Walker, 1982). Together, they provide 
the quantity and quality of protein desirable for human feeding and are 
, particularly valuable for 
those with higher protein requirements, such as 
infants, children and pregnant and lactating women. 
As well as protein, grain legumes are good sources of certain vitamins, 
in particular thiamin and niacin, as well as certain minerals such as calcium 
and iron. They are., however, devoid of carotene and ascorbic acid; the 
latter nutrient is synthesised during germination (Doughty and Walker, 1982). 
On the negative side, grain legumes are known to contain a wide range of 
antinutritional factors, but most of these are rendered harmless by heat 
processing. One group of substances which may limit the use of legumes in 
human nutrition are the oligosaccharides, which are not destroyed by heat 
processing (Bressani et al., 1973) and have been implicated in the product- 
ion of flatus in the large intestine of man (Calloway, 1966). Flatus is 
produced by the bacterial fermentation of oligosaccharides, which cannot be 
broken down by the digestive enzymes of man. 
Food legumes can be divided into two main groups; oilseeds, including 
soyabean and lupin, and starchy grain legumes. Oilseeds such as soyabean, 
are not suitable for air classification, as the high lipid levels are reported 
to prevent effective fractionation of components. Chickpea, a starchy grain 
legume of unusually high lipid levels, was also reported to be unsuitable 
for air classification (Sosulski and Youngs, 1979). Few systematic studies 
have been published on air classification of starchy grain legumes. For this 
present study, three legume species, cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea, were 
chosen, which although not commonly eaten in the mature form in the western 
world, are important sources of protein for many populations in developing 
countries. 
This literature review is divided into two parts. In the first part, 
attention is given to the structure and composition of starchy grain legumes 
with emphasis on the structure of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea. The second 
part is concerned with air classification. This includes an appraisal of 
equipment used for milling and air classification, as well as a discussion 
of the air classification of grain legumes, with emphasis, where possible, 
on the three legumes studied.

1.2.1 Structure 
The main anatomical co: r. ccn--ntc- of --rain ar se edon 
and embryo axis, which constitute 13,85 and 2% respectively of cowpeas (Phillips. 
1982) and 14 and 8610 for the hull and combined cotyledons and embryo axis resp- 
ectively, of fababeans (White, 1966). The seed coat can be thick, as in 
soyabeans, or thin as in mungbeans. 
The cotyledons contain a store of food reserves for the early growth of the n 
plant. In a study on limabeans, Rockland and Jones (1974), using scanning elec- 
tron microscopy (SEM), found t- _L ere in a rat within 
the cotyledon, whole cells  
honeycomb-like arrangement, joined to the middle lamella. In another SEM study, 
Mc Ewen et al. (1974) reported for fababeans, that cotyledon cells were 100 to 
500 micrometers (im) in diameter, with walls about 2im thick. 
The cotyledonary cells of starchy legumes contain discrete protein 11-odies anq 
starch granules. For fababeans, McEwen et al. (1974) reported that the Urotein 
bodies were 1 to 5im in diameter while the starch granules were 10 to 40wm long 
n to 25, -, m --. -ie. 
A typical cotyledonary cell of a starch legume is shown in 
Figure 1. In some legumes such as

groundnuts, globoids containing phytate have been observed within the protein 
bodies and starch granules (Doughty &'Walker, 1982). Surrounding the protein 
bodies and starch granules are membranes containing lipid bodies, called 
spherosomes, which are particularly predominant in oily legumes. 
In general, 'the starch granules of grain legumes are oblong and vary in 
size, depending on species and stage of maturity. Several authors have obs- 
erved both small and large starch granules in legume seeds (see Table 1). 
There is a wide variation in starch granule sizes reported by different workers 
for the same legumes. This may be due not only to intervarietal variation 
and method of sampling, but also to the different methods 'of particle-size measure- 
ment used. One problem with the interpretation of the literature in this

field, is that some workers do not report the methodology used for measurement 
of starch granule size. In addition, very few authors attempt to apply the 
necessary statistical treatment to results obtained using microscop. e-- methods. 
As far as intervarietal differences are concerned, Tolmasquim et al. 
(1971) reported that starch granules of 5 varieties of cowpea did not show 
any variation in size, whereas Lineback and Ke (1975) found varietal variation 
in starch granule size for Phaseolus vulgaris. Considerable variation in, 
starch granule size has been reported for fababeans (see Table 1), which may 
be due to investigation of different varieties by different workers. 
1.2.2 Composition 
Data for proximate analysis of various legumes have been published by 
many workers, and are summarised in Table 2 for cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea. 
Gupta (1983) found that both genetic and environmental factors cause the 
differences in chemical composition of legumes.

1.2.2.1 Protein 
Amongst the starchy grain legumes, there is considerable variation in 
protein content between species, as is shown in Table 2. This is due to a 
certain extent, to differences in the cultivars studied but also to the method 
of nitrogen analysis. Cowpea varieties have been reported to range in protein 
content from 21.2 to 30.6%, fababean from 22.9 to 39.8% and pigeonpeas from 
20.6 to 26.3% (Gupta, 1983). 
The protein present in legume seeds is mainly of two types; the albumins 
which correspond to the metabolic proteins and the globulins which are the 
storage proteins. The former are found in the structural components of the 
cells, such as membranes and cell walls and functional components such as 
enzymes, while the latter are mainly present in protein bodies. The globulins 
in the protein bodies contain both legumin and vicilin in cowpeas, fababeans 
and pigeonpeas (Mosse and Pernollet, 1983). Other proteins include the toxic 
components, haemagglutinins and trypsin inhibitors of the seed (Liener and 
Kakade, 1980), which affect the quality of the protein. Other factors affect- 
ing the quality of a protein are its essential amino acid pattern, the prop- 
ortion of essential to non-essential amino acids and the biological avail- 
ability of essential amino acids, including digestibility (Gupta, 1983). The 
essential amino anid composition of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea is shown 
in Table 3. This table also includes a comparison of the three legumes with 
soyabean, which is the most widely used legume protein in human nutrition, 
with a high protein quality similar to beef and the FAO (1973) provisional 
amino acid scoring pattern. 
The limiting amino acids in most diets are usually the sulphur- 
containing amino acids followed by lysine and possibly threonine and tryptophan. 
Compared with the FAO scoring pattern (FAO, 1973) legumes are generally low 
in sulphur-containing amino acids, but high in lysine. In addition, Tara and 
Rama Rao (1972) found that methionine followed by isoleucine were the limiting 
amino acids in the protein of pigeonpea.

1.2.2.2 Available carbohydrate 
The principal carbohydrate of starchy legumes is starch, which is well 
absorbed and utilised by man. Legumes provide an equivalent energy value, 
on unit-weight basis, to that of cereals (Gupta, 1983). Values for the starch 
content of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea can be seen in Table 2. The vari- 
ation in starch content for fababeans, as reported by various authors, ranged 
from 30 to 56.3% (see Table 2). Data in Table 2 show that these three 
species vary quite considerably between and within species. The greatest 
variation in values in Table 2 is for starch. This is most difficult to 
compare between laboratories, because of the differences obtained using dif- 
ferent methodologies (Southgate, 1969). For this reason, sensible conclusions 
about variation in starch content, can only be made on data published by the 
same authors. Arora and Das (1976) showed for cowpea varieties, that the 
starch content varied from 51 to 67%. 
Legumes contain more sugar than cereals, with sucrose as the major 
sugar and only small quantities of glucose. In contrast to cereals, they 
contain appreciable quantities of oligosaccharides which are further discus- 
sed in Section 1.2.2.4. Publihed data for the sucrose content of cowpeas, 
fababeans and pigeonpeas is presented in Table 7. 
1.2.2.3 Dietary fibre 
Legumes contain a substantial amount of dietary fibre, moreso than cereals. 
This is shown in Table 4, for whole wheat compared with cowpea, fababean and 
pigeonpea. Dietary fibre is defined by Trowell (1972) as "the skeletal 
remains of plant cells that are resistant to hydrolysis by the enzymes of man". 
The role played by dietary fibre in the alleviation of a wide range of human 
diseases has been actively researched in recent years (see, for example, 
books edited by Spiller and Kay, 1980, and Birch and Parker, 198). Only 
recently haw- data become available in the literature, on the dietary fibre 
content of legumes, as in the past. foodstuffs were only analysed for crude 
fibre. Crude fibre is not synonymous with di-etary fibre. The crude fibre 
methodology was primarily developed as a measure for use in the study of 
ruminant diets. It is the portion of a foodstuff or feed that results from 
extraction with dilute sulphuric acid, followed by refluxing with a dilute 
solution of sodium hydroxide, under specified conditions (Southgate et al., 
1978). The value obtained corresponds to all the lignin and most of the 
cellulose, without any of the hemicellulose fraction. Not only can humans 
make no use of lignin and cellulose in their diet, they cannot digest the 
chemically complex hemicellulose fraction either. The dietary fibre content 
of the three whole legumes studied is shown in Table 4 and ranged from 4.3 
to 20.3%. Intervarietal differences in dietary fibre content of starchy 
grain legumes can occur, as is evident from data for pigeonpea varieties, 
showing a range from 18.5 to 23.2% (Kamath and Belavady, 1980). The various 
conponents of dietary fibre are not distributed uniformly throughout the 
legume seed. This is further discussed in Section 1.2.2.5.

1.2.2.4 Minor components 
(a) Lipids: The lipid content of most starchy grain legumes is low and ranges 
from 1.3 to 3.0% for the whole seed in data given in Table 2 for cowpea, 
fababean and pigeonpea (Doughty and Walker, 1982), with little variation between 
species or varieties. One exception to this is chickpea, which contains a 
relatively high proportion of lipid (5.6%; FAO, 1972) in comparison with other 
starchy grain legumes. In contrast, the fatty-acid compoEition of the lipids 
shows a considerable variation (Salunkhe et al., 1983). The major fatty acids 
of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea are linolenic and linoleic, oleic and linoleic, 
and linoleic, respectively (Salunkhe et al., 1983). The total saturated and 
unsaturated fatty acids of these three legumes are shown in Table 5. Legume

Fababean 13.1 63.8

lipids have appreciable quantities of free fatty acids, which have high oxidation 
potentials. The presence of these components, along with lipoxygenases, are 
responsible for the development of 'off-flavours' at various stages in process- 
ing (Forss, 1969). 
(b) Minerals: The ash content of grain legumes varies from ce. 2.0 to 5.0/0 and shows 
little variation between legume species (see Table 2 for ash values of cowpea, 
fababean and pigeonpea). Legumes are a good source of iron and calcium (Doughty 
and Walker, 1982), being richer in these respects than most cereals. However, 
phosphomus is mainlypresent as phytate. Phytic- acid may effect the absorption and 
utilisation of divalent cations, such as calcium., in the seed, by the formation 
of insoluble phytate salts (Arora, 1983). In Table 6, the iron, calcium and 
phosphor us contents of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea, present in the whole, 
dried seeds are shown. Cowpea contains more iron than either of the other 
two species.

(c) Vitamins: Legumes are also good sources of thiamin (vitamin Bl) and 
niacin, butere devoid of carotenoids and, ascorbic acid. The thiamin and niacin 
contents of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea are shown in Table 6, where cowpea 
is shown*to be higher in both these vitamins than the other two species. 
(d) Toxic Components,: Certain toxic components present in grain legumes can 
affect their nutritional quality. These include protease inhibitors (which 
inhibit the proteolytic activity of certain digestive enzymes), 'phytohaemagglut- 
inins and flatus factors, as well as many others of more minor importance, which 
are discussed adequately elsewhere (Lienerand Kakade, 1980). 
It has been reported that cowpeas contain trypsin and chymotrypsin inhib- 
itors (Liener and Kakade, 1980), but only in low amounts (Molina et al., 1976). 
Fababeans are reported tocontain trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, pronase 
and papain inhibitors (Liener and Kakade, 1980). Bramsnaes and Olsen (1979) 
showed that fababean contains 4 trypsin inhibitors and 2 chymotrypsin inhibitors. 
Pigeonpea has only been reported to contain trypsin inhibitors (Liener and 
Kakade, 1980). Protease inhibitors are thought to have little significance 
for human nutrition, as for most legume species studied, it has been shown that 
human trypsin is not affected to any great extent (Liener and Kakade, 1980). 
Additionally, legumes are normally cooked before being eatEn and trypsin 
inhibitors are heat labile (Liener and Kakade, 1980). - 
Cowpeas were found to have practically no haemagglutinating activity by 
Valdebouze et al., (1980), although Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982) reported 2% haem- 
agglutinating activity. Liener and Kakade (1980) reported the presence of haem- 
agglutinins in fababeans, but pigeonpeas contained no haemagglutinating activ- 
ity according to the same authors. Haemagglutinins are destroyed by sufficient 
moist heat treatment and should not, therefore, have any significance in the 
human diet. I 
As far as cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea are concerned, the most important 
toxic substances are flatus factors, which are not destroyed by cooking or other 
forms of heat treatment (Calloway, 1966), and favism factors, present in fababeans. 
Grain legumes are reported to be the notorious producer of flatulence (Calloway, 
1966), which causes considerable discomfort when legumes are consumed in large 
quantities, especially by young children, as well as being a social inconvenience. 
It is the flatulence'caused, by ingestion of legumes, which has discouraged wider 
use of these low-cost, high-protein foods (Doughty and Walker, 1982). The specific 
factors responsible have not yet been entirely established, although oligo- 
saccharides have been identified to be associated with gas-production. Consider- 
able variation in'the degree of flatulence production has been shown between 
species (Murphy, 1964). 
Oligosaccharides develop during ripening of the legume seeds, as the moisture 
content decreases (Murphy, -1964)., and may bind directly to the protein molecules, 
preventing denaturation and thus stabilising the protein (Levitt, 1972). The 
most commonly found oligosaccharides in le gumes are raffinose, stachyose and 
verbascose. These sugars all contain a(1-6) galactose linkages, which make 
them indigestible to mammalian enzymes., due to absence in the gut of 
a-galactosidase. These non-digestible sugars pass into the large intestine, 
where they are fermented by anaerobic microorganisms (Clostridia spp. ) which 
pcisess a-galactosidase. This enzyme causes cleavage of the galactose units 
from the sucrose moiety and fermentation of these sugars results in formation 
of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide (Akapunum and Markakis, 1979). 
The raffinose, stachyose and verbascose contents of cowpea, fababean and 
pigeonpea are shown in Table 7. Stachyose was reported to be the major oligo- 
saccharide of,. cowpea (4.8%) by Cristofaro ot al. (1973) and by Akapunum and 
Markakis (1979). Verbascose was reported to be the major*oligosaccharide of 
fababean (2.6% by Cerning-et al. -(1975). and Colonna et al. (1971) and of 
pigeonpea (4.1%)by Cristofaro et al. (1973). However, Schweitzer et al. (1978) 
did not measure verbascose. One reason, why many workers do not measure 
verbascose, is that it is difficult to obtain in pure form for use as a standard. 
The wide variation in techniques used for the determination of oligosaccharides is 
indicated in Table 7 and may partly explain why the variation in data between 
different workers for the same legume is so high. Modem chromatographic 
methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/ 
mass spectrometry have been developed recently, which are more sensitive than 
older techniques such as paper chromatography and thin-layer chromatography 
(Macrae and Zand Maghaddam, 1978). However, little attention has been given 
to the extraction procedures for oligosaccharides prior to their chromatography, 
i. e. separation techniques; the efficiency of extraction methods may also have 
caused the variation in data reported (Macrae and Zand Moghaddam, 1978). 
Oligosaccharides are not the only factors which have-been shown to cause 
the production of flatulence following ingestion of legumes. The extent of 
the digestibility of the carbohydrate in legumes has also been implicated 
(Srinivasa Rao, 1976). Tadesse (1981) suggested that lignin, cellulose and 
hemicellulose, act as a substrate to the microorganisms in the gut and may also 
yield flatus gases. This is supported by evidence of change in dietary fibre 
composition during passage through the lower gut (Tadesse, 1981).

eating fresh or cooked fababeans. It mainly effects inhabitants of Mediter- 
ranean origin and is caused by an inborn error of metabolism, which should 
not be confused with an allergic response. A susceptible individual has a 
reduced level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and)thus, low 
levels of-reducedglutathione. The latter means that-the red blood corpuscles 
are less able to cope with the presence of oxidising toxic agents such as the 
favism factors. This leads to a chain of events, resulting in lysis of the 
red blood corpuscles by the reticulo-endothelial system. The substances 
causing this reaction are, in fababean, the a-glycosides, vi'cine and convicine, 
and are only found in this legume species (Liener and Kakade, 1980). Vicine 
was found to be present in whole fababeans at 0.72% and convicine at 0.27% 
by Pitz et al. (1980). 
1.2.2.5 Effect of dehulling on legume composition 
The seed coat (hull) proportion of the seed (dry weight) has been reported 
as 12.8% for cowpea (Phillips, 1982), 15 and 13.7% for fababean (Sosulski, 
1982; White, 1966) and 14.6% for pigeonpea (Jambunathan, 1981). White (1966) 
reported that the hull of fababean seeds was 13.7% by dry weight. As-would 
be expectedinter-varietal differences in hull content of legumes may occur, 
as shown for 8 fababean cultivars studied by Marquardt et al. (1975),, which 
gave values which ranged from 11.2 to 12.8% of the dry weight of the seed. 
The proximate compoEition of dehulled cowpea and fababean seeds is shown 
in Table 8, for comparison with the whole seeds in Table 2 (Section-1.2.2). 
The content of protein, starch lipid and ash of dehulled cowpeas and fababeans 
was higher than for the whole seeds (Molina et al., 1976). Thus, the hulls 
have only low quantities of these components, as can be seen for fababean in 
Table 8 (Marquardt et al., 1976). Phillips (1982) reported that the seed- 
coat of cowpeas contained a significant amount of protein (10.9%), with little 
difference in essential amino acid profile between the cotyledons and seed 
coat. However, non-essential amino acids were more variable. 
The crude fibre compoEition of fababean cotyledons and hulls was found

to be 1.4 and 53.5%, respectively, by Marquardt et al. (1975), which indicates 
that the majority of the cellulose and lignin of the legume is present in the 
hull. The fibre composition of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea whole seeds, 
dehulled seeds and seed coats was shown in Table 4. Dehulled cowpea contained 
2.5% crude fibre whereas the whole seed contained 7.5% and the seed coat 45.1% 
crude fibre (Table 4, Phillips, 1982). Few data are available on the dietary 
fibre content of the three legumes studied. The most detailed work published 
so far is for pigeonpea (Kamath and Belavady, 1980), which shows that dehulled 
pigeonpea contained 13.4% dietary fibre (Table 4), approximately two thirds of 
the dietary fibre content of the whole seed -(20.3%). 
Much of the dietary fibre 
present in the dehulled legume seed is in the form of hemicellulose. This can 
be seen in Table 4 where hemicellulose values for pigeonpea and fababean are 
10.3 and 7.2%, respectively. 
The mineral composition of the cotyledons and hull of fababeans was comp- 
ared by Marquardt et al. (1975), who found that calcium was higher in the hull 
than the cotyledon (0-38 and 0.05%, respectively) and conversely, phosphorus, was 
higher in the cotyledons than in the hull (0.64 and 0.08%)respectively). The 
seed coat contained very few nutrients, except for calcium and iron (Kapoor and 
Gupta, 1977). 
The content of oligosaccharides in fababean whole seeds, cotyledons and 
hulls was investigated by Cerning et al. (1975) and is shown in Table 7. It 
was found that verbascose concentration was similar in the whole seed and 
cotyledons, weight for weight, but the cotyledons were higher in raffinose, 
stachyose and sucrose. 
The seed coat of cowpeas was found to contain a significant amount of 
trypsin inhibitor (123.3 TI units/mg) in comparison with the whole seed (12.4 
TI units/mg) (Phillips, 1982). This finding. may partly explain the indigestible 
nature of legume hulls'(in Africa, seed coats of legumes are usually removed 
before feeding them to children as they are considered to be poorly digested, 
Phillips, 1982). There are no data available in the literature on the distri- 
bution of favism factors in fababean seeds. 
1.3 AIR CLASSIFICATION 
Air classification is a dry separation technique, which can be applied to 
any material with a population of particles of different masses. The separation 
individual particles can be predicted from Stokes' Law, which states, that. ) 
when a population of discrete particles of varying size is introduced into a 
rising air stream of constant and uniform velocity, particles below a certain 
mass will be carried upwards, whileall particles above that certain mass will 
fall downwards (Lauer end Prem, 1978). The smaller particles separated in this 
way, are collectively called the fines or fines fraction and the large particles 
are called the coarse fraction. The mass at which the particles separate, is 
called the separation cut size, cut size or cut point. 
Many air classifiers are designed to employ centrifugal forces rather than 
gravity, along with air flow, to achieve separation of particles quickly and 
more efficiently. A diagram of the physical forces operating in such an air 
classifier can be seen in Figure 2. A particle within such an air classifier- 
is subjected not only to the frictional force of air moving towards the inside 
of the air classifier wheel, but also to the centrifugal force of the rotating 
wheel, tending to throw it towards the outside. Under such conditions, smaller, 
less dense particles move towards the centre of the wheel and largermore dense

particles, move towards the outside. A centrifugal classifier of this nature 
would be equipped with the means of collecting the two fractions. The separation 
cut size (d T) 
for a specific particle size, is the point at which there is an 
equilibrium between the two forces already mentioned. This is expressed by the 
following equation: - dT2= 18 ne rr 
(n, viscosity of air; c 
radial speed of 
air; r, clearance,, of classifier wheel; e, particle density; cu . peripheral speed 
of particle). Particles larger than dT are centrifugally extracted as oversize 
towards the outside of the classifier wheel and smaller particles are carried 
inside by the air-stream. Fine, less dense particles, are therefore affected 
more by frictional forces and coarse, higher density particles, by the mass- 
dependent centrifugal forces. 
At any given separation cut size, there will alwVs be a certain amount 
of particles smaller than this size, which enter the coarse fraction and a 
certain amount of particles larger than this size which enter the fines fraction. 
The separation cut size is calculated at the point at which the weight of 
particles below that size, which pass into the coarse fraction, equals the 
weight of particles above that size, which pass into the fines (see Section2.2.1.2 
for details of calculation). For centrifugal air classifiers, the separation 
cut size (d ) can be varied, by altering the two matching values of speed and T 
air flow"rate (see Section 2.2.1.2). In practice, it is not possible to predict 
the movement of a particle by Stokes' Iaw in such air classifier, because the 
forces acting on any particle will depend on its position within the classifier 
and it is not possible-to measure this. Thus, to predict the behaviour of 
particles of a given substance (a) within such air-classifiers, it is necessary to 
use an empirically-derived calibration curve for another material (b). This is 
further discussed in Section2.2.1.2. Having predicted the separation cut size in 
such a manner for substance (a), particle-size analysis of the fines and coarse 
fractions of substance (a) can be used to confirm the separation cut size, at 
any given setting of the air classifier (see Section 2.2.1.2). Suitable methods 
of particle-size analysis are discussed in Section, 2.2.2., 
The first and most critical stage of the air classification process is 
conversion of the raw material into a condition which will allow separation to 
occur. This is achieved by size reduction using milling. The fineness obtained 
by milling, will be dependent on the raw material and the type of mill used. 
Intense pulverising, down to a particle-size distribution of 60wm or less, is 
needed for air classification of'many materials (Lauer and Prem, 1978). 
The remainder of Section 1.3 is concerned with mills used for flour pep- 
aration prior to air classification of grains, and. in particular, grain legumes, 
In addition the principles upon which present-day air classifiers are based 
are discussed, as well as factors affecting the air classification procedure. 
Finally, the application and uses of air-classified wheat, other non-leguminous 
foods and, in particular. grain legumes are discussed. 
1.3.1 MillinR of Grains for Air Classification. 
For air classification it is desirable to mill the grain to a flour of 
suitable fineness, such that the cell organelles are released without damage 
to starch granules. Starch damage would affect the particle-size distribution 
of the flour and also the functional properties of the'starch. The nature and 
size of cell structures of starchy grain legumes have already been discussed in 
Section 1.2.1. 
The finest size reduction is obtained with impact pulveriser mills. This 
type of mill has been found to be most suitable for preparing grain flours 
for air classification, as the material is smashed apart rather than being 
sheared. Photomicrographs (McEwen et al., 1974) indicate that protein, which 
is localized in discrete bodies (see, Section 1.2.1), is found, on milling (using 
an impact pulverizer mill), to range from individual bodies (1 to 511m) to 
aggregates of 20 to 30Pm, containing many protein bodies. Starch granules were 
found to remain intact on milling with such a mill (McEwen et al., 1974) and only 
a few protein bodies and cell wall fragments were found adhering to the starch 
granules. By contrast, roller mills (used in the wheat flour industry) crush 
the material, producing a wide range of particle sizes (2 to 200um in diameter 
for wheat, Jones et al., 1959), with fewer particles below 40um (this will 
depend on the hardness of the wheat, Kent, 1975). In addition, small starch 
granules are / 
more strongly embedded in the protein than larger starch granules, in 
both wheatand starchy grain legumes (Jones et al., 1959). Discrete particles 
could only be isolated after additional grinding of such, wheat flour in an 
impact mill (Jones et al., 1959). 
The fineness of impact milling is dependent on the number of collisions 
with other particles and collisions with the grinding surfaces. The fineness 
of the particle-size distribution of flours obtainedjusing impact mills, is 
mainly a result of the much higher operating speeds of - such mills. - 
The fineness 
of the flour also depends on the type of grinding surfaces and the size of any 
screen openings. 
Two examples of impact pulverizer mills,. are the pin or stud millie. g. 
Contraplex 630C (Alpine)., and universal cross-flow mill e. g. Ultraplex 10OLU 
(Alpine). The pin mill is capable of high impact velocity (180m/s), which is 
sufficient to separate organelles, yet is below that at which significant starch 
damage occurs. Fedec (1980) found that starch-granule damage became significant 
at 240m/s, using an Alpine Contraplex A250 pin mill. Heat produced within the 
pin mill is considerable at rotor speeds higher than 180m/s and this would 
detrimentally affect the material. Fedec (1980) recommended, therefore, speeds 
of less than 180m/s. 
Simple pin mills have one stationary and one rotating pin disc. Finer 
particle reduction of flour is obtained when two rotating discs are used, such 
as in the Alpine Contraplex 6300 pin mill. Several workers have used such a 
pin mill for preparation of grain legume flours, for air classification, including 
Vose et al. (1976), Fedec (1980) and Sosulski and Youngs (1979). Pin mills 
are most suitable for milling of soft and brittle products and products cont- 
, 4h%W. 3 lia. 
aining fats, askwear and tear on this type of mill is high. 
Whole pulverised wheat was shown by Alpine (1979a) to yield flour with 
25 to 30% of particles less than 161im, 45 to 55% less than 201im, 80 to 90% 
less than 40pm and 96 to 99% less than 90pm. However-A, Alpine did not mention 
the method of particle-size analysis. Using an Alpine'pin mill 250W, Sosulski 
and Youngs (1979) found, for 8 dehulled legumes, that all'particles of the 
resulting flours were below 45pm (particles measured using a 325 Tyler mesh). 
Fedec (1980) confirmed that fine particle-size distributions-in legume flours 
are produced by pin milling (Alpine Contraplex A250 pin mill), Using an . Alpine 
air jet sieve A20OLS for particle-size analysis this worker found that the 
majority of the particles were less than 35pm, with low starch damage, although 
the method of testing for starch damage was not mentioned. This latter observ- 
ation was confirmed by Vose (1978), using-the Alpine 250W pin mill, who observed 
little starch damage in barley, when the flour was examined by SEM. However, ' 
Tyler et al. (1981) found'that chipping and splitting of the granules occurred in 
grain legume flours when the coarse fraction from air classification was remilled 
using the double pass technique (see Figure 5). This was thought to be the 
reason for the increased starch content of the second fines fraction. 
The univeral cross flow mill operates at a speed of ca. 120m/s. The Alpine 
Ultraplex 10OLU mill, is of this type and was used in the work described in this 
thesis. It is'described in detail in Section2.2.1.1. This type of mill has a 
sieve insert, of rasp-trapeze design, suitable for preparation of flour for air 
classification, and is suitable for milling of food materials, such as starchy 
grain legumes'which have low fat content and where wear and tear is expected, 
causing little starch damage, but producing fine particle-size distributions in 
the range 5- 601im (Alpine, 1982). Alpine (pers. comm., 1979) compared the 
particle-size distributions (using the Air Jet Sieve) of whole cowpea flours, 
after milling using the Alpine 160Z Ko lloplex pin mill and the Alpine 10OLU 
Universal mill, both of which are laboratory-scale mills. They found that a finer 
flour was produced with the latter mill (75% of parlicles below 32pm, 90% below 
75vm), than with the former mill (70% of particles below 32pm, 85% below 75pm). 
Several authors have observed that the fineness of milled flour can be ' 
affected by various parameters, other than mill type. Jones (1960) reported 
that, when mill feed rate was reduced in the laboratory roller mill (manufacturer 
not specified), it gave rise to wheat flour with a finer particle-size distri- 
bution. The same author found that drying the flour from 13 to 11.5%, did not 
affect the fineness of wheat flour although the method of particle-size analysis 
was not specified. Kent (1965) showed that hard wheats gave more fines by air 
classification, when they were moistened prior to pre-milling treatment by 
roller mill; however. this did not apply for soft wheats. Kent (1965) suggested 
that moisture,, at this stage, helped to ease the individual components of the 
grain apart during roller milling in hard grains, where protein-starch attach- 
ments may be stronger than in soft wheats. For pea flour, PFPS (1974) found 
that the moisture content of the whole peas, as well as the method of grinding, 
affected the particle-size distribution of the flour. In addition, Fedec (1980) 
also observed that seed moisture affected particle-size reduction of dehulled, 
cracked, pintobeans, using the Alpine Contraplex pin mill A250 and the Alpine 
air jet sieve for particle-size analysis. This worker found that a moisture 
content of 8% produced the finest flour for pintobeans. 
1.3.2 Air Classifier 
The first air classifiers to be produced, were gravity air classifiers 
(Lauer and Prem, 1978). These separators can be used for the separation of 
particles greater than 3001im from finer particles. In all these classifiers, 
the fine product escapes"in an upward direction, together with the air, and the 
coarse product leaves the classifier in a downward direction, due to gravity. 
The separation cut-size is modified by varying the ascending air velocity. For 
all types of gravity air classifiers the process is long and-time consuming, as 
there are several stages to the air classification. Firstly the greater part 
of the fines are removed, then the particles nearer to the separation cut size 
are removed. 
When the change in amount of the oversize fraction entering into 
the fines is negligible, the separation cut size has been achieved. 
Centrifugal air classifiers are predominantly used on an industrial scale. 
Included in this group, are the larger production scale air classifiers such as 
Mikroplex Spiral air classifier type 132MP (Alpine) and the smaller scale ones 
such as the Multiplex laboratory zig-zag air classifier 100MZR (Alpine, see 
Section 2.2.1.2 for details). These air classifiers operate on the same prin- 
ciple as gravity air classifiers, except centrifugal forces are used in place 
of gravity. This allows a considerably stronger separation effect and decreases 
separation time. The centrifugal forces will carry large and/or more dense 
particles outwards. The air drag (Stokes' friction) will tend to carry smaller 
and/or less dense particles inwards. (see Figure 2 for details). 
The core part of centrifugal air classifiers,. is a classifier chamber, 
containing a rotating classifier wheel. The classifier chambers of these two 
types of centrifugal air classifier are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

To adjust the separation cut size of the Mikroplex 123NP air classifier, 
a lever outside the classifier chamber adjusts the guide vanes on an arbitrary 
scale. Classifier-rotor speed is fixed for all separation cut sizes. By vary- 
ing the angle of the guide vanes, different separation cut sizes can be achieved, 
as the more open the position of the vanes, the greater the air flow within the 
classifier. The Alpine Mikroplex 132MP air classifier has been used by several 
authors reporting on the air classification of grain legume flours. One disadv- 
antage of this equipment is that, because ofitslarge size, cleaning is difficult 
and time-consuming. Therefore only about two samples per day can be conveniently 
prepared. Additionally, work on this machine entails use of large quantities of 
material and running costs'are' high. 
In contrast to the Mikroplex 132MP air classifier, the Alpine Multiplex 
100MZR air classifier is small, easy-to-clean, with low, running costs, uses small 
samples and up to 20 samples can be air-classified in_one day. Air flow rate 
and classifier rotor speed can be set precisely, which should enable achievement 
of precise separation cut sizes, whereas the Mikroplex 132MP air classifier has 
only an arbitrary scale for adjustment of guide vanes. In addition, the separ- 
ation cut size range of the 100MZR is wider (2 to 801im) than the 132W (3 to 3011m), 
which means it can be used-for more varied purposes. These factors suggest, 
that the Alpine Multiplex 100MZR would be. suitable for a laboratory study of. the 
behaviour of grain legume flour over a range of separation-cut sizes.

1.3.3 Application of Air ClaSsification 
The technique of separating particles in air was first developed for use 
in the chemical, dyestuffs, ceramics and white clay industries to form products 
sharply graded in the 2 to 601im range of particle sizes. In the late 1950S and 
early 1960s, modern commercial air classifiers were developed and these found 
application for the displacement of proteinfrom wheat flour and other grains. 
At a chosen separation cut size, the majority of starch granules present 
in a flour can be excluded from the fines fraction, producing a fines fraction of 
higher protein concentratiorL than the original flour (see Figure 5 for details 
of process). Thus, the finest particles (fines) contain higher protein levels ty 
the coarser fractions (Vose, 1976). Wheat fractions produced in this way, have 
found a number of applications in the baking industry, which are discussed 
below.

*, a double-pass technique involves re-air classification of the coarse fraction 
after re-milling, to produce a second fines fraction and a second coarse fraction; 
t, some workers follow the above procedure, but do not re-mill the coarse fraction, 
this is not denoted as a double-pass technique in this thesis. - 
As much of the published data on air, classification deals with the concen- 
tration of protein from wheat, it is important to consider how wheat flour 
separates during the processi to make comparisons with legume flours. Therefore, 
in the following Sections, the literature on the air classification of wheat 
will be discussed, followed by that on other non-leguminous foods and grain 
legumes. Only the single pass method of air classification will be discussed 
initially, data on the double pass technique being confined to the end'of each 
discussion. The interpretation of the literature on the air classification of 
foodstuffs is complicated by the lack of informa tion given by authors on the 
exact separation cut size used. Where air classifiers such as the Mikroplex 
132MP are used, particle-size analysis is necessary to determine separation 
cut size used for each fractionation. 
1.3.3.1 Wheat and other non-leguminous foods 
Jones et al. (1959) found that the feed rate of wheat flour into the air 
classifier affected separation cut size. This was also noted by Sullivan et al. 
(1960), who found that increasing the feed rate for air classification decreased 
the sharpness of separation and increased the separation cut size for wheat 
flour. Jones et al. (1959) showed that there are three principal groups of 
particles in pin-milled wheat flour: large particles of either cell wall material, 
including starch and protein agglomerates, or larger detached starch granules or 
seed coat (> 40iim); medium-sized starch granules, some with adherent protein 
(15 to 40um); small chips of free "wedge" protein and detached small starch 
granules (< 15um). Jones (1960) reported that the most important factors deter- 
mining separation by air classification were, firstly, size and., secondly, shape 
of the particles. This author assumed that the densities of protein (1.39/cc) 
and starch (1.5g/cc) were too close to have any effect on air classification 
of wheat flour. This factor is not mentioned by any otherworkers. Jones (1960) 
did not mention how the density values were obtained, nor did he describe the 
materials on which they were measured. 
One factor. which affected starch content of the fines fractions obtained 
by air classification of wheat, was the variety of wheat used. Jones (1960) 
showed that the proportion of small starch granules. present in different types 
of wheat, varied considerably, whereas there was less variation in the number 
of larger starch granules. 
There is some evidence to suggest (Vose, -1978) that the protein content 
of air-classified wheat-flour fractions varies in certain chemical character- 
istics, depending on which anatomical part of the endosperm it came, from. Wedge 
or interstitial protein is the amorphous protein of the endosperm matrix and 
is readily fractionated by air classification. Adhering protein is the-protein 
that remains on the starch granules after extensive milling and is not removed 
after air classification. This protein has 3 to 4 times more-bound lipid than 
wedge protein Nose, 1978). Vose (1978) reported that there is more adherent 
protein in hard wheats (1: 3), than in soft wheats (1: 1.04), which may in part 
explain why there is less starch damage in soft wheats, as there is less adherent 
protein to break away during milling. 
Using a Mikroplex 132MP air classifier, Jones (1960) showed a sharp increase 
in yield and fall in protein content of the fines fraction of wheat flour, as 
the separation cut size began to exceed ca. 19pm; the size at which larger starch 
granules are abundant. This was confirmed by Sullivan et al. (1960) for air- 
classified wheat flour. The protein content of fines, produced at different 
cut sizes, was highest in the finest fines fraction (< ca. 16pm), using an 
Alpine Hikroplex 132MP air classifier (Sullivan et, al. 1960), and decreased 
rapidly up to 25pm, with the entry of starch granules. 
As well as protein and starch, other components have been found-to fraction- 
ate specifically into the fines or coarse fractions during air classification 
of wheat, including ash, sugars and fibre. Further work by Sullivan et al., 
(1960) revealed that ash separated with the finest wheat flour particles (under 
8um) to give a fines fraction with twice the ash content of the original flour. 
This was thought to be due to the high ash content of cell wall material and 
protein sheaths, which both separated into the fines fraction. Starch granules 
have a very low ash content; therefore at 15Vm separation cut-size these authors 
found that the ash content of the fines fraction produced. was well below that 
of the original flour, due to the larger proportion of starch granules in this 
fraction compared with the flour., On increasing the separation cut size from 
15 to 30Pm, Sullivan et al. (1960) showed that the ash content increased again 
in the fines fraction, due to the entry of small endosperm and peripheral cells. 
Mae Arthur and D'Appelonia (1976) air-classified 4 varieties of. pin-milled, 
hard red spring wheat into high, low and intermediate protein fractions. The 
first fines (by a single pass), contained the highest amounts of protein and 
also the highest amounts of ash and total sugars, including sucrose, maltose 
and raffino se. Varietal, differences in protein,. ash and sugar contents were 
also observed. The coarse fraction of hard wheatiwhich had been air-classified, 
was found to consist of cell wall material with associated pentosans and cellulose, 
as well as damaged starch and large starch granules (Yamuzaki, 1969). 
By SEM, Jones (1960) showed thatrepeated pin milling and air classification 
of the coarse fraction, using a Mikroplex 132MP air classifier, removed protein 
attached to the starch granules of wheat, hence reducing the number of agglomer- 
at.. es. However, no mention was made of the amount of starch damage that may 
have been incurred. Low and intermediate protein-content fractions from air 
classification of hard red spring wheat, by the double pass method (MacArthur 
and D'Appelonia, 1976), were found to contain total sugar levels similar to 
those present in the original flour and higher moisture contents than the first 
fines fraction. They concluded, that the, latter observation was due to the 
larger particles in the second fines fraction, compared with the first fines 
fraction, which decreased the surface area for water loss. 
Air classification of hard winter wheats (Stringfellow et all., 
showed that the protein shift (for definition see Section 2.3.2) was lower in 
hard wheats, than in soft wheats, which had been air-classified using a-4-part 
and an 8-part fractionation (the coarse fraction is remilled, and re-air classi- 
fied, at the same cut size, 3 times and 7 timesjrespectively). The total 
protein shifted into the fines ranged, -from 
20% to 34% for the. 4-part fraction- 
ation and from 30% to 60% in the 8-part fractionation. 
The potential of using air classification for the fmcho. )ation of other 
non-leguminous foods has been investigated by several workers. Air classification 
of pin-milled waxy barley (using an Alpine Contraplex A250 pin mill and a 
C. E. Bauer 751 Centrisonic air classifier) was inve-stigated by Fedee (1980), 
with a view to producing a starch-rich fraction, high in amylopectin and low 
in protein. This investigation was not successful as protein, and starch were 
not sufficiently separated from each other. The air classification of whole 
hexane-extracted cotton seed- was investigated by Martinez (1969) using an 
Alpine Kolloplex 160-Z pin mill and a Bauer air classifier (type not mentioned). 
Particle-size analysis was carried out by light microscopy. This worker used a 
4-part fractionation, in which the coarse fraction from air classification was 
re-air classified without remilling, at a slightly larger separation cut size. 
This was carried out four times. The separation cut size used was not mentioned, 
it was simply noted that variables within the air classifier were set to separ- 
ate out only the finest, particles. The first and second fines fractions, when 
pooled together gave, a dry weight yield of 51% with a protein content 73%. 
Martinez (1969) noticed, that, if the original cotton-seed flour had a-high moist- 
ure content during defatting, grinding and, air classification, the first fines 
fraction was of higher protein content but, had a lower dry-weight yield, than 
if a flour of lower moisture content were used., PhosphorQs.., and ash were found 
to concentrate in the fines. This was due to the fact that globoids are inclus- 
ions in the protein bodies of cottonseed and constitute a large part of the 
phosphor5 and ash of the flour. Martinez (1969) showed that the hulls concen- 
trated in the coarsest fraction and the final fines fraction produced, (as phown by 
a high value for crude fibre). \AKe6 the cottonseed used for air classification 
was glanded, the pigment glands were also found to, enter the coarse fraction. 
Martinez (1969) also found that the presence of hulls, though not significant 
in, grinding and air classification, affected the dry weight yield of the first 
fines fraction and the protein content of the final fines fraction produced. 
This would be expected, if the hull predominantly mills to coarser particles, - 
which usually separate intothe coarse fraction. 
Data on the behaviour of cotton seed defatted flakes during air classificatiorX 
ha, cP-also been published by Kadan et al. (1979) and Kadan et al. (1980). These 
authors wished to produce an edible protein product, low in gossypol (a toxic 
component of the pigment glands of glanded cottonseed, dispersed throughout 
the kernel). They firstly investigated the most suitable mill for the purpose 
of breaking up the seed, but which left the pigment glands intact, then; by air 
classification, it was found possible to remove the gossypol into the coarse 
fraction at a separation cut size of 15im, using a Donaldson A-cu cut A-12 
classifier, in which cut size was altered by changing classifier rotor speed 
and keeping air flow rate constant. For complete removal of gossypol, the fines 
fraction was re-air-classified three times, at progressively larger cut sizes 
without remilling. This gave rise to a final fines fraction which was higher 
in protein (60.4%) and low in gossypol (0.1%) compared with 54.6% protein and 
2.0% total gossypol in the defatted flakes. In this wayj air classification 
was used by Kadan et al. (1979) to remove toxic components and produce an edible, 
low-gossypol fraction. 
The air classification of spray-dried potato, gave rise to a coarse fraction 
of 96% starch (Holm, 1981). Air classification of spray-dried potato has 
also been investigated by Eriksen (1981), for the production of high-purity 
starch ccneentrates. The use of air classification for this purpose removes 
problems of waste effluent, which have been of major concern in the production 
of potato starch. 
1.3.3.2 Air Classification of Leguminous Grains 
If data on the behaviour during air classification of fine-milled cereals 
and tubers are compared with those of grain legumes, variations in protein 
shift (see Section 2.3.2 for details) are apparent, with the highest protein 
shift being for some grain legumes Nose et, al., 1976). In starchy grain legumes, 
proteins exist as discrete protein bodies, rather than as cell matrix around 
the starch granules. as in wheat. Therefore, the wedge protein found in wheat 
flour does not exist in legume flour, although there may be some adherent protein. 
legumes are usually reported to contain fairly uniform, large diameter starch 
granules, compared to the mixed populations of small (1 to lOpm) and medium to 
large sized ones (15 to over 40Pm) found in cereal grains Nose, 1978; and 
Naivikul and D'Appelonia 1979b). Starch granule sizes for cowpea)fababean and 
pigeonpea are shown in Table 1. 
1.3.3.2.1 Protein 
Although the protein content of the fines is to some extent a reflection 
of the protein content of the original grain legume, some grain legumes are 
found to displace protein more efficiently than others. Even different varieties 
of the same species show wide variation in protein shift. For example, dehulled, 
pin-milled and air-classified pintobeans (P. vulgaris)_ did not displace protein 
as well as dehulled, pin-milled and air-classified great northern whitebeans 
(P. vulgaris), using either the single or the double-pass technique (Fedec, 1980). 
Table 9 summarises published data on the air classification of legumes, some 
flours including cowpea and fababean using single and double pass procedures. 
None of the cut sizes quoted in the literature in Table 9 were substantiated 
by particle-size analysis. 
Reichert (1982) showed that the protein content of grain legumes was inversely 
related to the content of other components present in the seed; the-lower 
thep3Dtein content of the legume, the greater the content of cell wall material, 
lipid, ash, starch and sugars. These components will have the effect of 'diluting, 
the protein present in the fines fraction, if they fractionate into this fraction. 
Reichert (1982) observed that the protein content of the fines fractions 
of four varieties of dehulled, pin-milled (Alpine 250CW) and air-classified 
(Alpine 132MP)fieldpeas was greater, if the separation cut size was reduced. 
However, Fedec (1980) found that if the separation cut size was reduced so that 
the protein content of the fines fraction was greater than 65% for pea flour, 
the dry weight yield of the fines was very low. The increase in protein content 
of the finesas separation cut size was reduced, was most marked in legumes 
containing higher protein contents, such as fababean (Reichert, 1982). Fababean 
was found to displace protein more efficiently than any other legume (Table 9, 
Vose et al., 1976 and Lauer and Prem, 1978). 
The protein yield (protein separation efficiency, see Section 2.3.2) of 
8 dehulled, pin milled (Alpine 250CW) and air-classified (Alpine 132MP) legumes, 
including cowpea and fababean, was investigated by Tyler et al. (1981) at a 
separation cut size of 121im. However, no mention was made of whether the

separation cut size was checked by particle-size analysis (see Section 1.3.2). 
A double pass air-classification technique was used, qrwl results for protein 
content of the fine and coarse fraction were recorded after one and two passes, 
and are shown in Table 9. The content of protein remaining in the coarse 
fraction of cowpea and fababean (Table 9) was 14.2 and 19.6%, respectively; after 
a single pass. The protein remaining in the coarse fraction was thought to be 
adherent protein and agglomerates of starch and protein bodies (see Section 1.3.3.1% 
which could be dispersed by remilling of the coarse fraction and submitting it 
to the double pass procedure. In Table 9, the protein content of the second 
coarse fraction of air-classified cowpea and fababean (Tyler et al., 1980) was 
6.2 and 12.4%, i. e. less than the protein content of the first coarse fraction. 
These workers also noted that the protein yield of the fines fraction did not 
vary within a single species, but only between species. However, cowpea was 
an exception and intervarietal variation was observed for this legume. These 
observations were contrary to the work of Fedec (1980), who observed inter- 
varietal variation for P. vulgaris (Table 9). 
The differences in protein yield between species (Table 9) and between 
varieties of cowpea, may be due to seed hardness affecting milling and the 
resulting particle-size distribution of the flour (Tyler et al., 1981). 
Data for cowpeas inTable 9 show that with a single pass, at a cut size of 
15V4 cowpea does not yield a fines fraction with as high a content of protein 
(51%) as does fababean (75.1%). Cowpea has a lower protein content than fababean 
and substantially more dietary fibre in the flour and fines fractions. This 
adds confirmation to the suggestion of Reichert (1982) that other components, 
such as fibre, act as "diluents" to the protein during air classification. 
One other aspect of legume component fractionation, which has received 
some attention from research workers, is the behaviour of individual amino acids 
during air classification. Pea protein concentrate, produced by air classifica- 
tion (PFPS, 1974), was found to be high in lysine and adequate in all other 
essential amino acids,, except the sulphur-amino acids, in comparison with the 
FAO (1973) provisional amino-acid scoring pattern. Patel et al. (1980) found 
that the sulphur-containing amino acids of navybean flour (P. vulgaris) concen- 
trated in the coarse fraction during air classification. 
Many researchers in the field of air classification have chosen to separate 
grain legumes by the double pass method (Figure 5) and some have used a separa- 
tion method at two cut sizes, the first one lower than the second (Figure 5). 
A comparison of data obtained for air classification of legume flours7using the 
single and double pass methods (Table 9), shows that considerably more protein 
can be retrieved from the flour with a second pass, but the second fines fraction 
also contains more starch Several varieties of dehulled and pin-milled great 
northern whitebeans (P. vulgaris) containing 23.2 to 27.0% protein were air - 
classified by the double pass method by Sahasrabudhe et al. (1981). The varieties 
produced a mean fines protein content of 79.9% and dry weight yield of 32%. 
Pin-milled pea flour was air-classified by PFPS (1974) by the double pass method, 
at a single separation cut size of 15Vm. By this method, the protein content of 
the final coarse fraction was only 2 to 3%. Little information. on the degree 
of starch damage produced by remilling of the coarse fraction, has been reported 
for grain legumes. It is likely that the higher content of starch)present in 
the second fines fraction, is largely, due to fragments of damaged starch granules 
incurred by remilling of the coarse fractio4 which are now-. small enough to enter 
the fines fraction. If this is so, the functional properties of this fraction 
will be altered. 
1.3.3.2.2 The fate of fibre components in whole and dehulled leRumes. 
Many workers have chosen to dehull legumes prior to pin-milling and air 
classification, as removal of the hull prior to milling increases the protein 
content of the flour before air classification ee Tables 2 and 8 for details). 
Hull removal also decreases the crude fibre content of the flour, the coarse 
fractions and, to a variable extent, the fines fractionsof air-classified legumes 
(Fedec, 1980 see Table 10). Vose et al. (1976) showed that the crude fibre 
contents of the coarse fractions of air-classified pea flour were reduced from 
8% to 1%, if the peas were dehulled. Air classification of dehulled legumes 
increases the dry weight yield of the fines fractions relative to whole legume flou,,, 
Therefore, dehulling may result in marginal alteration of the protein. content 
and crude fibre content, of, fines in comparison with whole legumes. This was 
partly confirmed by Fedec (1980), who produced fines fractions of 25 and 30% 
dry weight yield and 48.6 and 52.8% protein from air-plassified pea flour, 
with and without hulls, respectively (Fedec, 1980). 
Various workers have found that the coarse fractions of air-classified 
whole legume flours contained the majority of the crude fibre, as the hull 
concentrated in the coarse fraction during air classification. These workers 
include Sosulski and Youngs (1979) and Vose et al. 
_(1976). 
for fababeans, Aguilera 
et al. (1982) for navybeans (P. vulgaris) and Kon et al. (1977), for California 
small whitebeans (P. vulgaris). In contrast to the aforementioned findings,

a number of authors including Fedec (1980),,, found that crude fibre concentrated 
in the fines fractions of some legumes whether or not the legume was dehulled. 
These data are summarised in Table 10. Tyler et q1. (1981) found that the 
fractionation of crude fibre of dehulled legumes varied from species to species 
(Table 10). 
It was found by Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982), using AOAC (1980) method 
32.20 for NDF (insoluble dietary fibre), that, when 11 dehulled grain legumes, 
including cowpea and fababean, were air-classified, the fines fractions contained 
the majority of the insoluble dietary fibre. -This was also observed 
Youngs (1975) for field peas using the same analytical methodology. The 
dietary fibre of the cotyledons is mainly composed of hemicellulose (Kamath 
and Belavady, 1980; see Section 2.3.2.3)., 
A comparison of the fibre compositions of fieldpea (P., sativum ) cell 
wall material (the part remaining after repeated washing and, wet sieving of 
the macerated legume) and fieldpea hull was made by Reichert (1981) using 
AOAC method. -7.050 for'ADF (crude fibre) and AOAC'method 32.20 for YDF (insol- 
uble dietary fibre). Pea hull was found to contain a total of 68.3% cellulose, 
whereas the cell wall material contained only 10.6% cellulose. On the other 
hand, pea cell wall material contained a total of 22.3% insoluble hemicellulose 
and the hulls only 7.5%. The results of the work of Reichert (1981) show 
that fieldpea cell'wall material concentrated in the fines fractions during 
air classification. Using the enzyme-modified NDF method of Robertson and 
Van Soest (1977) for insoluble dietary fibre, Aguilera et al. (1982) found 
that the dietary fibre content of the fines fraction of dehulled air- 
classified navybean flour was higher than in the coarse fraction (3.8 and 
3.3% respectively). In addition, these authors found that the hulls contained 
40.4% insoluble dietary'-fibre of which 60% was'crude'fibre. Thus, the consider- 
able quantities of hemicellulose that are known to be present in the cotyledons 
of grain legumes (Kamath and Belava:. dy, 1980). may be finely-ground by milling, 
and enter the fines fraction during the process of air classification. 
1.3.3.2.3 Toxic components - 
A knowledge of the fate of toxic components of grain legume flour during 
air classification is important, if the air-classified fractions are to be 
used in food products. The oligosaccharide composition of whole grain legumes 
was reported in Section 1.2.2.4and is shown in Table 4 for cowpea. fababean 
and pigeonpea flours. The whole pin-milled flour of whitebeans 
(P. vulgaris) 
was - found by Sahasrabudhe"et al. (1981) to contain slightly more stachyose 
than the dehulled pin-milled flourby HPLC. The oligosaccharides , raffinose 
and stachyose, were found to fractionate into the fines fraction during air 
classification, although the separation cut siz Ie was not mentioned. Colonna 
et al. (1980) observed a decrease in oligosaccharide content in the air- 
classified coarse fractions of dehulled fababeans',, smooth peas and wrinkled 
peas, by HPLC, which'implies that they were concentrated in the fines. ' The 
oligosaccharide content of 11 dehulled legume flours and their air-classified 
fines and coarse fractions were investigated by Sosulski'et al. (1982), using

gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results are shown in 
TablelOA for cowpea and fababean. The oligosaccharides and sucrose were concen- 
trated in the fines fraction and reduced in the coarse fraction. For fababean, 
the oligosaccharides were concentrated in the fines fraction, but sucrose was 
reduced in the fines fraction. Total (%-galactoside, present in flour and fines 
was higher for cowpea than for fababean. For the 11 legumes studied by these 
authors, the fines fractionscontained between 40 to 90% more oligosaccharide 
than their respective flours. 
Bramsnaes'and Olsen (1979) examined air-classified fines fractions of 
fababean flour and found that the glycosides, vicine and convicinewere closely 
related to the proteins and thus concentrated in the fines fraction. Favism 
factors of fababean were found to be concentrated in the fines fraction by air 
classification, by Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982). Additionally, Elkowitz and 
Sosulski (1982) found that trypsin inhibitors and haemagglutinins concentrated 
in the fines fraction, by air classification of cowpea and fababean flours. 
1.3.3.2.4 Other minor components 
Lipid, ash, phosphor us, zinc and potassium have been found to concentrate in 
the fines fraction of air-classified legumes by several authors including Kon 
et al. (1977), who studied California small whitebeansand Colonna et al. (1980), 
who studied pea and fababeans. Patel et al. (1980) found that calcium was not 
concentrated in the fines fractions, but the coarse fractionsof air-classified 
whole navybeans. Additionally, calcium was found to fractionate away from 
phytate, into the coarse fractions of air-classified legumes by Kapor and Gupta 
(1977). Iron was found, to be concentrated in the fines fraction (Patel et al., 
1980). 
It was noticed by Reichert (1982), that dehulled pea flour of, lower 
protein content, contained higher quantities of ash (3.3%) (as well as fibre 
and sugars), than, *dehulled pea flour of higher protein content (2.8% ash). 
It wag also noted by Sosulski and Youngs (1979), that fines fractiorasof pin-milled 
and air-classified flour of 8 different grain legumes. contained a higher proportion 
of lipid and ash than the corresponding flours. Lipid was also found to be 
concentrated in the fines fractions of air-classified field-pea (P. vulgaris) 
by Reichert (1982). It was suggested, that fieldpea protein bodies are coated 
with a structure rich in lipid (Reichert, 1982), and this accounted for its 
concentration in the fines fraction during air classification. The vitamins 
and minerals of pea protein concentrate were also found to be concentrated in 
the fines fraction after air, classification by PFPS (1974). 
1.3.4 Uses, of Air-Classified Fractions 
1.3.4.1 'Wheat 
A use must be found for all fractions of an air-classified material, not 
only the fines, if the process is to be c9mmercially profitable. The ability 
to separate 70% - extracted wheat flour by air classification, led to the 
development of a range of raw materials with different starch and protein contents 
and different functional properties. By supplementation of air-classified 
wheat flour, it is possible to maintain a constant protein content in flour for 
the breadmaking industry, despite varietal and environmental effects. In Great 
Britain this has led to a reduction in imported wheat of higher protein content, 
thus decreasing costs to the bread industry (Jones et al., 1959). 
The majority of bread in the U. K. is made from hard wheat, which has a 
higher protein content than soft wheats; however, Pep'linski, et al. (1964) showed 
that soft wheatswhich produce flours suitable for pastry and cake products 
(protein content 6to 9%), could produce a fines fraction, by air classification, of 
ca. 20% protein, which could therefore be incorporated into soft flour for the 
bread industry. Air classification is used nowadays by Rank Hovis MacDougall 
Ltd (UK), to produce free-flowing flour for cake-making, by removing the fines 
(protein concentrate) from the flour at a certain separation cut size* The fines 
are then used for bread-making (RHM report, 1979). Further applications were 
reported by Vose (1978), who noted that by air classifying wheat flour, -a fines 
fraction of intermediate particle-slze, obtained by the double pass technique, 
can be used when chlorinatedfor cake-making, while a second coarse fraction, 
which is granular, could be used for biscuit-making, 
1.3.4.2 Other non-leF_uminous food materials 
Air classification of whole, defatted cottonseed flour (Martinez, 1969) 
by a single pass, produced two products; a protein concentrate for human food 
use and a coarse residue of high nutritional quality for animal feeds. The 
protein concentrate from air classification of whole cottonseed flour (Martinez, 
1969) was also tested in bread formulae, at the same level as a non-fat, dried 
milk control (2.6%). No significant, differences were found between the two 
breads. Additionally, Kadan et al. (1980) used air classification as a means 
of removing the toxic gossypol from glanded cottonseeds. This component entered 
the coarse fraction leaving a high protein fines fraction which could*be used 
for human foods. Thus the potEntial use of cottonseed has been expanded, from 
one which was primarily production of edible oillwith use of by-products in 
animal feeds. 
Air classification of spray-dried potato granules, was shown to produce 
a fines fraction which contained 9.9% protein as well as a coarse fraction or 
starch concentrate (96% starch', Holm 1981). Production of starch concentrates 
in this manner avoids costly waste effluent disposal, which has been of major 
concern to the potato-starch industry (Holm, 1981., and Eriksen, 1981). 
1.3.4.3 Legumes 
The potential uses of air-classified legume fractions are many, but-at 
present most of these products are only at the research stage. In this Section, 
uses reported in the literature for the fines and coarse fractions of whole and 
dehulled, air-classified legumes are discussed. 
The-wide range of physical characteristics shown by air-classified products 
may find considerable use in the food industry, as food processors require raw 
materials with weak, intermediate or strong functional properties, 'depending 
on the end use (Sosulski and Youngs, 1979). Sosulski and Youngs (1979) showed 
that the fines fractions of 8 air-classified legume flours gave high values 
for oil emulsification, whippability and foam stability. Coarse fractions 
gave high water absorption, paste and cold viscosities. The functional properties 
vary in air-classified legume fractionsas their composition depends on the ratio 
of protein: starch: lipid in the original flour and, hence, in the fines and coarse 
fractions. 
Air classification of grain legumes has potential in parts of the world, 
such as temperate locations of Europe, the Prairies, Nigeria and India, where 
soya will not grow successfully, but where other legumes produce high yields. 
In these areas, air-classified legume products could be used, rather than relying 
on the importation of soya products currently used in food manufacturing of 
products. As far as product development is concerned, pea protein concentrate, 
produced by PFPS (1974), using a single pass through the air classifier, at a 
separation cut size ca. 15 um, was mixed with wheat flour. This combination 
was successfully utilised in the manufacture of crisps, similar to potato 
crisps. 
In breadmaking, fababean air-classified protein concentrate was supple- 
mented in weak, medium and strong wheat flours by Patel and Johnson (1974). 
At a level equivalent to 20% fababean flour, this mixture produced bread, with 
acceptaU e quality and satisfactory physical dough properties. Air-classified 
legume products may find use in the bread industry to increase the protein 
content of wheat flours (PFPS, 1974). However, so far, reports of the use of 
air-classified legume products have been disappointing. PFPS (1974) found 
that a reduced loaf volume was observed unless gluten was added. In breadmaking, 
considerable research is needed to incorporate new materials into bread to 
make a successful loaf, as was found by Ellis et al. (1981) when incorporating 
guar gum into bread to make high-fibre bread for diabetics. Eventually, these 
workers modified the process and succeeded in making an acceptable loaf. 
Due to the relatively high lysine content of legumes-and air-classified 
protein concentrates, they may be used in combination with cereals or other 
products to increase the nutritional quality of food products(Kon et al. 1977). 
This has important applications in infant weaning foods, for use in developing 
countries, where milk, fish and eggs are in short supply, and for other groups 
with high protein requirements, such as children, pregnant and lactating women. 
Indeed, PAG (1973) stressed that an effort should be made to increase the use 
of grain legumes as protein supplements to cereal grain and/or root-based diets. 
PAG (1973) also stressed that food legumes have primary importance for providing 
economical protein concentrates as ingredients in processed nutritious foods, 
including foods'for weaning and pre-school children. Cereal grain protein is 
deficient In lysine, thus it could be supplemented by legume protein, PAG, (1973). 
For each legume and cereal there will be an optimum mixture which will supply 
protein of higher quality than either of the two foods eaten alone. PAG (1973) 
recommended that research be carried out to diversify processing forms and 
uses of legumes, for soups, protein, rich foods and pasta products. 
Patel and Johnson (1974) found that there was a marked increase in lysine, 
threonine and tyrosine in bread, supplemented with fababean protein concentrate. 
The protein efficiency ratio for air-classified pea flour was raised from 
1.46 to 2.55 by addition of 10.4% methionine and raised to 2.02 when wheat 
flour was added as a supplement (PFPS, 1974). Thus, air-classified pea flour 
is a natural supplement to wheat flour. 
Pea flour and air-classified pea protein concentrate were added as forti- 
fiers (33% and 20% respectively) to hard red spring wheat, in the manufacture 
of noodles and spaghetti, to increase the quallity and quantity of pasta (Nielsonet a-Z 
1980). Fortification increased the protein content up to 27% for noodles and 
24% for spaghetti. Dough handling for noodles, however, deteriorated as the 
level of fortification increased and cooking losses were greater, despite decreased 
cooking time. The work reported by Nielson et al. (1980)-did not result in 
the development of a successful product. However, these technical problems 
may deserve further research, as pasta, fortified with air-classified legume 
protein, could be usefully exploited for increasing the protein content of 
diets, arising where pasta is eaten as a large part of the diet (PFPS, 1974). 
Air-classified fractions of roasted, navybean flour (Aguilera et al., 1982), 
have potential in food products, as they would give longer shelf-life to food 
products made from the fractions, due to inactivation of thermo-labile enzymes 
during the toasting process. In addition, roasting the flour reduced trypsin 
inhibitor activity and inactivated haemagglutinirAs. 
The starchy coarse fractions from air classification, can be used for 
a variety of applications. such as adhesives for corrugated board production and 
the manufacture of pressure-sensitive microcapsule coatings for carbonless paper 
Nose, 1978). In addition, the presence of protein in the coarse fraction 
means, that this fraction could be used in the production of snack or gravy 
formulations, as areplacement for wheat flour (Aguilera et al., 1982), and 
also in animal feeds. It is possible to purify the coarse fraction further 
to obtain a purified starch, by further remilling and air classification, to 
produce a coarse fraction of only 3% protein (Youngs, 1975). 
The fibre from dehulled grain legumes, prior to milling, has potential 
use in high fibre food products, if the beany flavour can be removed (Sosulski, 
1982). In the case of field peas, the hulls have been used as a natural source 
of dietary fibre, especially in high fibre breads (Sosulski, 1982). and may 
become extensively used for this purpose instead of wheat bran. 
The s=ess of commercial legume air-classification depends on the ability 
of the fractions to compete economically with soyabean-derived flours and starches, 
from wheat and corn processing, and on finding a market for the coarse fraction 
containing residual protein (Colonna et al., 1980). 
1.4 AIMS OF WORK PRESENTED 
This project is concerned with the study of component fractionation of 
grain legumes on a small-scale, using a laboratory air classifier and other 
equipment on loan from Alpine Process Technology (UK) Ltd, from 1980 to 1983. 
The objective was to investigate the potential of air classification of grain 
legumes, for the production of protein concentrates for human food. 
The work reported here is, firstly, a validation study of equipment used 
(Chapter 3), namely the Alpine air jet sieve A20OLS and its application to 
particle-size analysis of legume flours and air-classified fractions, the 
Alpine laboratory universal mill 10OLU and the Alpine laboratory zig-zag air 
classifier 100MZR. The second part (Chapter 4), is a detailed study of the 
air classification of a single grain legume and the final part (Chapter 5), 
is a comparison of the air-classification characteristics of two varieties 
of each of three species of grain legumes. 
An examination of the literature showed no detailed study of the effect 
of separation cut size on the behaviour of legume flour during air classification, 
although this had been carried out to some extent. for wheat flour. Several 
authors had studied the air classification of grain legume flours at a single 
separation cut size, giving no rationale for their choice of separation cut 
size. Most of the reported work had been carried out without using suitable 
methodology for particle-size analysis. In addition, experimental design was 
such, that no proper statistical treatment of results could be made. There 
is therefore, no data in the literature on the reproducibility of air class- 
ification of grain legume flours, using any equipment. Only a few workers 
have reported fractionation of components other than protein, such as fibre 
and toxic components, in relation to protein fractionation. 
In choosing grain legumes for this study, it was necessary to avoid over- 
lap with on-going air classification programmes, such as those of the Prairie 
Regional Laboratory, Saskatoon, Canada, working with Phaseolus Vulgaris and 
Pisum sativum, or the Food Research Institute, Norwich, England, working with 
Pisum sativum. The species chosen for this work were cowpea, Vigne unguiculata (L) 
Walp-. fababean, Vicia faba (L), and pigeonpea, Cajanus cajans (L). They were 
chosen, because they are important sources of protein for many populations 
in developing countries, such as Africa (cowpeas), India (pigeonpeas) and the 
Sudan (fababeans), and were recommended by the PAG in 1973, for future research 
in the production of protein concentrates, for use in the feeding of infants 
and pre-school children. In addition, cowpeas had been air-classified by 
Tyler et al. (1981), who found that protein yields were low in the fine frac- 
tions, but they did not investigate the reasons for this. Fababeans had 
been air-classified by several workers, including Lauer and Prem (1978) and 
Tyler et al. (1981), who reported extremely high protein yields in the fines 
fractions in comparison with other starchy grain legumes. Thus, the indications 
were that cowpeas and fababeans would provide interesting comparative data. 
No workers had studied the air classification of pigeon"'peas. 
For each legume species, two varieties were taken for study. One variety 
of each species was purchased in Reading. These were, therefore, grain legumes 
Which had been produced commercially overseas, fumigated and imported. The 
second variety of each legume was obtained from one of the International' 
Institutes of Tropical Agriculture, based in the tropics. These samples were 
freshly harvested, non-fumigated, catalogued legumes of known history. Very 
little data in the literature pertains to grain legumes of known history. 
The objectives of this work were therefore divided into"three main parts, 
which are described in the following Sections. 
1.4.1 Validation of Equipment (Chapter 3) 
It was necessary to validate the Alpine universal mill 10OLU and the 
Alpine zig-zag air classifier 100MZR used for this study, to facilitate 
interpretation of data on air classification, and to allow work to be repeated 
by others. It was necessary that experimental design allowed for adequate 
statistical treatment of results, necessary for full interpretation of data. 
In the past, it has not been possible to dediice whether differences in data, 
obtained by various workers, are due to poor reproducibility of equipment, 
differences in equipment, or factors associated with the food'material used. 
Particle-size analysis is of particular importance in a study of air 
classification, as far as milling and air classification itself are 
concerned. In the programme of study, the Alpine air jet sieve A20OLS was 
initially used for the determination of particle size, so this equipment also 
required validation. However, during the course of subsequent work (Chapter 
it became clear that this technique -was not satisfactory for this purpose 
and other methods were necessary. Those chosen were, light microscopy and 
the Coulter counter. 
The Alpine air jet sieve is a rapid, dry-sieving technique, in which 
mesh-blinding is reduced, as air is forced upwards through the sieve and particles 
are drawn through the mesh by. suction. As the sieves are precision-made, 
an accurate particle-size analysis can be obtained for suitable materials. 
For this equipment, the effect of alumina, an anti-sticking agent, and moisture, 
on the measurement of particle-size distribution of cowpea flour was investigated. 
Several authors had indicated that the most suitable millfor the production 
Of an ultra-fine flour needed for large-scale air classification of grain 
legumes, was the pin mill (e. g. Vose, 1978). However, for laboratory purposes, 
the mill, recommended by Alpine Process Technology (UK), Ltd, was-the universal 
10OLU mill. Preliminary trials had revealed that this mill gave a finer flour 
than did a laboratory pin mill (Section 1.3.1). The effect of grain legume 
feed rate and mill running-time (Experiment 4) on particle-size distribution 
was studied, for the Alpine universal mill 10OLU with 0.2mm rasp-trapeze 
sieve insert. 
The air classifier used was the Alpine laboratory zig-zag air classifier 
100MZR. This had some advantages over larger air classifiers. These included 
the ability to give precise settings of air flow rate and classifier speed, 
which make it possible to estimate separation cut size from the manufacturerts 
data (Section 2.2.1.2). Being a small-scale air classifier, only small samples 
are needed for operation and as many as 20 samples can be air-classified in 
one day, making it suitable for research work. There is only one report in 
the literature dealing with the validation of air classifiers, and this was 
for pea flour by Fedec (1980), using a Bauer Centrisonic air classifier, 
model 751. For the 100MZR, the effect of flour moisture (Experiment 5), 
sample weight (Experiment 6) and feed rate (Experiment 7), during air class- 
ification was investigated. In addition, the influence of small changes in 
air flow rate and classifier speed settings, on yield of fines and coarse 
fractions was investigated (Experiment 8). Air classification was carried 
out using the single-pass technique (Figure 5) and a single batch of whole 
cowpea flour was used throughout. the air classification studies. 
1.4.2 Effect of Chanp in7 Separation Cut Size of the Alpine ZiR-Zag Air 
Classifier 100MZR on Fractionation of Cowpea Flour (Experiment 9) 
-To study of the effect of changing separation cut size of the air class- 
ifier, on separation of legume flour components, one legume flour (cowpea 
variety 1) was studied in detail over a range of separation cut sizes. 
For each setting of the air classifier, the fractions of cowpea flour were 
analysed for their particle-size distributions, to enable the separation 
cut size to be calculated, for comparison with the estimated separation cut 
size (see Section 2.2.1). For each setting of the air classifier, the 
fractionation of moisture, dry weight and protein was investigated, as well 
as the fractionation of other components, including starch, dietary fibre, 
sucrose and oligosaccharides. 
1.4.3 Effect of ChanRing Separation Cut Size-of*the Alpine Zig-Zag Ai 
Classifier 100MZR on Fractionation of Flour from Three Legume 
Species (data to include two varieties of each Species, Experiment 10). 
A comparison was made of the air classification behaviour of flours 
produced from 3 legume species, under the same milling conditions (Tables 
11 and 12). Air classification was carried out over a range of separation 
cut sizes selected from data obtained in Experiment 9. The three legume 
species chosen. were cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea (Section 1.4). Two 
varieties of each of these species were included to give some indication of 
intervarietal variation during air classification. Although differences in 
the air classification characteristics of flours of different species of 
grain legumes had been shown by a number of workers (eg Sosulski and Youngs, 
1979), there were no reports of any intervarietal variation for the three 
species mentioned. For each setting of the air classifier, analyses were 
carried out as in Experiment 9, on the whole flours and fines fractions. 
CHAPTER 2 
MATERIALS EQUIPMENT AND METHODS 
2.1 MATERIALS 
The grain legumes used are described fully in Table 11, together with 
their moisture, crude protein and hull contents. Cowpea variety 1 was used 
for Experiments 1 to 8 (Chapter 3) and Experiment 9 (Chapter 9). Cowpea 
variety 2, fababean varieties 1 and 2 and pigeon pea varieties 1 and 2 were 
used for Experiment 10 (Chapter 5). Legumes obtained from international 
institutes overseas (variety 2) were non-fumigated, whereas those purchased 
in Reading were commercially available and had therefore been fumigated. 
A description of the legume flour batches used in Experiments 1 to 10 
are described in Table 12, together with their mill feed rates. An alteration 
of moisture content was carried out on samples of cowpea flour batch MI 
(Table 12) used in Experiments 2 and 5 and whole cowpeas used in Experiment 4 
as described below. 
Alteration of LeFume Moisture 
a) Whole legumes (Experiment 4): A single batch of whole cowpeas (variety 1, 
see Table 11) was divided into 2x 500g batches. One batch was dried, and 
one moistened. 
b) Legume flour (Experiments 2 and 5): A single batch of cowpea flour 
(batch Ml, see Table 12) was divided into 2x 500g batches for Experiment 5, 
and 2x 100g batches for Experiment 2, and treated as above. 
To increase the moisture content of the whole legumes and whole legume 
flour, the batches were placed, individually, on a tray on a platform of a 
desiccator filled with water and left to equilibrate, for 24h on the top of 
an oven set at 100 0C 
To reduce the moisture content of the whole legumes and whole legume 
flours, the batches were placed on the outside top of an oven held at 1000C, 
for 4h. 
The batches were then stored in air-tight containers and moisture 
determinations were carried out as described in Section 2.3.1.

2.2 SPECIAL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUE 
2.2.1 Air Classification 
2.2.1.1 Alpine laboratory universal mill JOOLU 
The Alpine laboratory universal mill 10OLU, or Ultraplex cross flow 
mill, is an impact pulveriser mill. It operates at much higher speeds 
(idling speed 17,500 rpm) than do mills)such as the hammer and roller milly 
and hence produces a flour of fine, particle-size distribution. The applic- 
ation of this type of mill for the preparation of grain legume flours for 
air classification, has already been discussed (Section 1.3.1). The impact 
element consists of a band of steel plates, placed radially on the edge 
of the rotor as shown in'Figure 6. The stationary grinding tract is a ring 
of metal strips, with a sieve insert, which can be of various designs. For 
milling of grain legumes. a rasp-trapeze sieve, resembling a cheese-grater, 
is most suitable, and was used for the work described in this thesis, with

of the plates and the grinding track. 
Operation The grain legumes were fed manually into the mill, via the feeding 
tray. The milled legume was collected in a flour sack, tightly fastened to 
the collecting chamber at the base of the mill. After operation, the flour 
was stored in airtight containers marked with a flour batch number (Table 12) 
and the mill was cleaned thoroughly.

2.2.1.2 Alpine laboratory zig-zag air classifier 100YIZR 
The Alpine zig-zag 100MZR air classifier consists of three basic parts: 
the classifier, filter and blower (see Figures 7 and 8 for details). These 
are connected by hoses. The classifier consists of a rotating zig zag wheel, 
drive motor, air volume meter, feeding device and collecting vessel for 
the coarse material, which passes outwards through the zig-zag channels. 
A short pipe leads from the classifying chamber to a small cyclone in which 
the fines material is separated from the carrying air, after passage through 
the centre of the classifier wheel, and collected in a bottle. The air 
with any unseparated fines. subsequently passes through a fabric filter. 
Air throughput is maintained by the blower attached to the filter. 
Air volume (flow rate) is adjusted by means of an air throttle behind the 
cyclone outlet. Power is transmitted from the drive motor (0.22 ki') to the 
classifier wheel by a drive belt. The speed of the classifier wheel is meas- 
ured electrically by use of an alternating current generator in the control 
gear, which has two ranges, 0 to 21 X 103 rpm and 0 to 7X 103 rpm, in 100 rpm 
divisions. Air flow rate is indicated by a float-meter in the range

The core part of the Alpine zig-zag air classifier lOOMZR is a rotating 
classifier wheel with zig-zag shaped channels, each of which has 6 components, 
into which air enters from outside (see Figure 4, Section 1.3.2). The 
separation cut size of the air classifier is varied, by combining two match- 
ing values of classifier speed and air flow rate, as described in Section 1.3.2. 
As Stoke's law cannot be applied in practice to air classifiers of this type 
(see Section 2.2.2), further values of classifier speed and air flow rate 
for a given separation cut size, can only be obtained empirically. 
This is 
done by construction of a calibration curve of separation cut size (um) 
against classifier speed (rpm), either by estimation or by direct measurement. 
These two methods are described below. 
a) Estimation: To obtain an estimated calibration curve of separation cut 
size against classifier speed for a given material, it is necessary to use 
the calibration curve of a ground material of known uniform density and 
particle-size distribution. For this purpose, the calibration curve for 
limestone was used. Allowance was then made for the differences in densities 
of the two materials using the equation : /2 where d is the 
separation cut size of the new material (um), di is the separation cut size 
of limestone (Lim), e is the density of the new. material and el is the density 
of limestone (g/cc) (Alpine, 1979 (a)). In this way, the separation cut 
size can be calculated for the new material, for each successive classifier 
speed and the estima(ted'ealibration curve constructed as shown in Figure 9. 
Air velocity can be calculated from the estimated calibration curve. using 
the equation: 
55 -n M3 /h 
(Alpine, 1979 a), where v is the air flow 
rate and n is the classifier speed (rpm). Thus, matching values of air flow 
rate and classifier speed can be obtained for each separation cut size. The 
'main problem with estimation of the calibration curve in this manner. is the 
measurement of density. A discussion of the application of this method 
for cowpea flour is described in Chapter 4.

hence the density) of 40 g cowpea was determined 4 times giving 1.194, 
1.214,1.193,1.219 g/cc. Thus, i = 1.204 g/cc- 
b) Direct Measurement: To obtain a calibration curve of separation cut size 
against classifier speed by direct measurement, matching values of classifier 
speed and air velocity ( calculated as above ), are chosen and 
2345 678910 
Classifier speed (rpm X 103) 
samples of the chosen food material are air-classified at these settintim., s. 
The particle-size distributions of the resulting pairs of fines and coarse 
fractions are subsequently obtained using a technique, such as Coulter counting 
(see Section 2.2.2.2) or microscopy. The separation cut size is the point 
at which the weight of particles below that size which pass into the coarse 
fraction, equals the weight of particles above that size, which pass into 
the fines (see Section 1.3 for further details). Using these data it is 
possible to construct a new calibration curve for the material in question, 
without the necessity for density measurement. 
Operation Five parameters must be fixed before operation of the air classifier. 
These are classifier speed (rpm), air flow rate (M3 /h), feed drive speed 
(units), feed rate (kg/h) and sample weight (g). 
Classifier speed and air flow rate values, representing individual 
estimated separation cut sizes, were calculated from empirical data obtained with 
limestone as discussed previously in this Section. These covered an estimated 
separation cut size range of 10 to 26 Um (see Table 13 and Figure 9). 
A feed drive speed of 0.6 units was used throughout this project except 
for Experiment 8, where feed drive speed was increased, to prevent clogging 
of flour in the feed drive worm at faster feed rates. 
For operation of the air classifierthe sample bottle was filled with 
feed material and the air classifier started, firstly, by turning on the 
three-phase electrical cut-out switch, secondly, the blower was started and, 
thirdly, the air classifier (Figure 7). The flour then passed into the air 
classifier chamber, via the feed drive worm. 
After air classification the machine was turned off in the reverse of 
the above order. Finally, any flour adhering to the fine and coarse collect- 
ing chambers was brushed into the respective collecting bottles. For the 
fines, this procedure was a little more extensive; the front panel of the 
air classifier chamber was removed and the internal parts cleaned, and 
brushed into the fines bottle. The resulting fine and coarse fractions 
were weighed and recorded with details of all parameters used.

2.2.2 Particle-Size Analysis 
The study of the separation of-powdered material, using air classific- 
ation, is considerably aided by a knowledge of its particle-size distribution. 
Methods for the determination of particle-size distribution include microscopy, 
a series of sieves of known sizes, such as the Alpine air jet sieve, and analysis 
by Coulter counter. 
Microscopy is valuable for identification of components in a non- 
homogeneous powder (or flour). However, as a method for particle-size analysis, 
it is tedious, as, whether using light or scanning electron microscopy, many 
observations are needed for statistical validity (200 observations, on each 
of three individual slides for light microscopy, Flint, 1982, pers. comm. ). 
The use of microseopytwithout proper-use of experimental design and statistical 
analysis, may partly explain why there is so much reported variation in 
particle-size of cell components of grain legumes (see Table 1). Particle- 
size analysis of starch granules of flour has been carried out using wet 
sieving (Evers and Lindley, 1977). However, one of the main difficulties 
encountered, was removal of proteinaceous material in which the starch granules 
were embedded (Evers et al., 1973). Dry sieving methods include shaking, 
vibrating and air jet sieving. The former two methods usually comprise a 
nest of sieves of different. sizes. The flour to be tested is placed on the 
top sieve and after a period of shaking or vibrating, the weight of flour 
in each sieve is calculated. However, problems with blinding of the meshes 
are common. The air jet sieve (Alpine), is designed to overcome problems 
of mesh-blinding and can be used to give particle-size distributions as low 
as 1011m, due to the development of precision microsieves. Finely-dispersed 
silica can be used to help disperse sticky particles, which agglomerate, 
as the silica particles (< lum) coat the fine particles in the flour. Anti- 
-static agents., such as finely-dispersed synthetic aluminium oxide 
(A-1203t 
, particle size 0.0005 to 0.03 jim), can also be used to prevent blinding, 
especially on the microsieves. The air jet sieve has been shown to be a 
suitable method of particle-size analysis for some materials. Thus, 
Brown et al. (1970) found the air jet sieve was a reliable and reproducible 
method of particle-size analysis for Portland cement. Using microsieves 
of 10 to 30ilm, Fedec (1980) investigated the particle-size distributions 
of dehulled pintobeans and great northern whitebeans, using the air jet sieve, 
and he concluded that it was a reliable method for these flours, although 
he did not compare it with any other method. 
Coulter counting-is a rapid method of particle-size analysis, the main 
disadvantage of this technique being the need for experienced operators. 
Evers. (1981) used the Coulter counter for particle-size analysis of wheat 
flour, and found that there were 3 times more small starch granules present 
(< 10um) than had previously been found, using other methods of particle- 
size measurement. This worker also noted 
iha t particle-size is being recog- 
nised as an important quality factor in wheat flour for confectionary product- 
ion. In this industry, particle-size analysis is now carried out by Coulter 
counter, whereas previously it was carried out by slow sedimentation methods 
(12h for a complete analysis). The model ZB Coulter counter yields data 
requiring considerable calculation, to obtain a particle-size distribution, 
for a ground material. This can be overcome by use of a computer program. 
Particle-size analysis of whole -milled and air-classified legume flours, 
was carried out in this project using the air jet sieve, Coulter counter 
and light microscope. 
2.2.2.1 Alpine air let sieve A20OLS 
This equipment consists of two basic parts. These are the air jet sieve 
housing with contact-switch timing clock, a vacuum gauge for negative pressure 
and a Plexiglass lid, and a vacuum cleaner with dust filter and air-suction 
conduit. These are connected by hoses. Each sieve has a separate sieve 
drum with a plastic packing collar to prevent air leakage. This machine 
can be adapted to house drums of 200mm diameter (such as 32 to 125 um mesh) 
and microprecision sieve drums of 75 mm diameter (such as 15um mesh). 
Air enters the air jet sieve at the base of a rotating slit nozzle, as 
shown in Figure 10)and is sucked through the sieve mesh upwardslby the action 
of the vacuum pump (attached via a discharge socket, Figure 10), which finally 
draws the air back through the sieve meshIcarrying with it any particles 
which are smaller than thesize of the sieve holes. After operation, the

coarse material remaining on the sieve is weighed so that the amount of fines 
passing through the sieve can be established. To obtain data on particle- 
size distribution of a flour, the coarse sample can be passed to each of 
a series of la; pr sieves in turn. However, samples investigated using the 
microsieve attachment must be carried out independently. 
Operation A series of sieves were used for particle-size determination in 
this study: 32,45 and 63 Um macrosieves and the 151lm microsieve. Using 
a digital balance with tare-facility (Sartorius), a sample of flour 
for macrosieves and lg for microsieves ) was accurately-weighed onto the 
sieve mesh. The sieve drum was fitted into the air jet sieve and the lid 
secured. Sieving time was 4 min (macrosieves) and 8 min 
(microsieves), as 
recommended by Alpine (leaflet no BV 390/17E). After operation the lid was 
removed and any adherent material brushed into the sieve drum. The sieve 
was then reweighed and the percentage of particles passing through the sieve 
mesh calculated. Data were not corrected for moisture content. 
2.2.2.2 Coulter counter ZB 
The Coulter counter electronically measures andenumerates the size of 
particles passing through it. Data obtained are independent of density of 
the material studied. Measurement is made on the assumption that all part- 
icles are spherical. The main parts of the equipment are shown in Figure 11 
and include a glass tube with an orifice of known size, a glass manometer

Particles to be counted are suspended in a suitable electrolyte solution 
and mixed by ultrasonification. On opening the top tap (Figure 11), a vacuum 
is created which causes the sample to flow through the tube aperture; this 
unbalances the mercury manometer. Closing the top tap, shuts off the vacuum 
and the mercury begins to syphon back, carrying the-sample through the 
orifice. The mercury column has a start andcLstop probe placed at a certain 
distance apart, such as 0.5 ml, which give a constant sample volume at each 
count and these activate the electronic counter. The start probe automatically 
places the counter at zero (see Figure 11). Normally there is a constant 
current passing across the electrodes (one situated inside and one outside the 
Coulter tube). This current is interupted when a particle passes through 
and this alteration of current is recorded. If the particle is small, the_ 
interuption is only for a very short period, while a larger particle causes 
a longer period of interuption. The particles pass rapidly through the tube 
orifice creating pulses of current, which are displayed on an oscilloscope. 
The amount of amplification is determined by the gain control switch on the 
side of the machine. At the same time as the pulses are displayed on the 
oscilloscope, their levels are measured by a threshold-determining step, 
set at a certain voltage. At any given threshold, pulses will only be recorded 
if they are greater than this voltage. If the threshold level is reduced 
by steps, for a given sample material, it is possible to obtain a complete 
particle-size distribution. Background counts are taken of the electrolyte 
to take into consideration any particles it may contain. The total count 
of a sample is obtained by decreasing the threshold level until no further 
increase in count is obtained. 
Monosized particles of a known size, such as latex beads, lying between 
5 and 20% of the aperture diameter, are used to calibrate the Coulter counter 
(see Coulter manual). Using the half-count technique (Coulter manual) for 
determination of the calibration constant , values for the threshold level(t), 
attenuation (A) and aperture current (I) are obtained. These are required 
in order to calculate the equivalent particle volume (V) from the equation 
v= t. I. A. The calibration constant (k), can be determined from the 
equation k=3d where d is the particle diameter. As the response 
vlt--. I. A 
of the Coulter counter is essentially linear with respect to particle volume, k 
can be used to calibrate particle-size diameter from any other combination of 
3 VT_ instrument settings, using the equation d=k. t. I. A providec( that 
the diameter of the orifice, gain control and matching switch remain constant. 
Operation The single threshold technique was used throughout this work, with 
a 200pm orifice tube. The electrolyte'system used was ammonium thiocyanate (5%) 
in isa, -propyl alcohol, filtered through a 0.5pm Millipore filter made of 
Cellotate. The electrolyte was used to fill the orifice tube and also for 
sample dispersion. 
Analysis of a sample was carried out in, the following order: background 
count on electrolyte solution; calibration, using the half-count technique 
(see Coulter manual) with 13.5iim latex beads dispersed in electrolyte solution; 
sample preparation and particle-size analysis of sample dispersed in electrolyte 
solution. To prepare a sample, the flour was taken on the tip of a glass 
rod and dispersed into a beaker of electrolyte solution and ultrasonified 
for 30 see for complete dispersion. It was necessary to achieve a concentration 
of particles giving 10% or less coincidence (for details see Coulter manual). 
After analysis, the particle-size distribution of the sample was calculated 
using a comput er program (see Appendix 1) written in Algol 68 by K. Freeman. 
This programme produced a cumulative weight Uoversize) distribution curve 
for each sample and a table of corresponding numerical values, according 
to the method described previously in this Section. 
Determination of separation cut size by Coulter counter The cumulative 
weight distribution curves., obtained using this computer program for pairs 
of fines and coarse samples., were plotted together. as shown in Figure 12. 
Separation cut size is the point at which the weight of particles below that 
'size, 
which pass into the coarse fraction, equals the weight of particles 
above that size, which pass into the fines, as discussed in Section 1.3. 
An example of this procedure is given in Figure 12, for a separation 
cut size of 1011m. 
Figure 12: Determination of Separation Cut Size by Coulter Counter -a 
typical example (in this case, dry weight yield fines 50%, coarse 50%) 
cd 10 
An equal amount of overlap 
(10% in this case) between 
fines and coarse fraction 
occured at 1011m. Thus, 
101im is the separation 
cut size. 
Studies of reproducibility Reproducibility of the Coulter counter was 
investigated using 13.5 um latex beads as a standard material, and whole 
cowpea flour produced using the Alpine universal mill 10OLU (Variety 1, flour 
batch Ml, see Table 12), the results of which are shown in Figures 13 and 14, 
respectively. Precision of Coulter counting was found to be high, as the 
peak of the 'histogram' in Figure 13, for 13.5um latex beads occurs at 13.511m. 
In addition reproducibility of data, shown by the SED of 2 means in Figures 
13 and 14, was considered acceptable for comparative purposes. 
Much of the reported literature on air classification of legumes flours 
had been c4rried out using flour milled in the Alpine 250CW*pin mill (see 
Section 1.3.1). Indeed, authors such as Vose (1978) have concluded that 
only the pin mill will provide legume flour of sufficiently fine particle- 
size distribution for satisfactory air classification. As. for the work 
undertaken in this thesis, the Alpine 10OLU universal mill was recommended 
by the manufacturers (see Section 1.3.1), a comparison of the particle- 
size distributions of cowpea flours produced using both types of mill

was undertaken. For this purpose a sample of cowpea flour (of unspecified origin, 
purchased in Canada), vhich had been dehulled and milled by the Alpine 
250CW pin mill at the Prairie Regional Laboratory, Saskatoon, Canada, was provided 
by Dr A. F. Walker. A comparison of the particle-size distribution of this 
pin-milled flour and universal-milled whole variety 1 cowpea flour batch Ml 
(see Table 12), by Coulter counter, is shown in Figure 15. 
Dehulled, pin-milled cowpea flour was found to have a slightly finer 
particle-size distribution, ranging from 4 to 36um, than whole '' universally- 
milled cowpea flour (4 to 4211m see Figure 15). However, this difference 
in particle-size distribution could be accounted for. by the presence of 
larger hull fragments in the whole flour, but not in the dehulled flour. 
2.2.2.3 Light m1croscop 
Light microscopy was carried out using a Nikon light microscope with 
differential interference contrast (Nomarski), in order to give photographical 
representation of particles, in particular starch granules, present in the 
legume samples used in this thesis and also to record the sizes of starch 
granules. 
(1) Photomicroscopy: Slides of individual whole legume flours and fines 
fractions were prepared with the help of Dr Olga Flint, Procter Department 
of Food Science, University of Leeds. A smearing method was used for mount- 
ing the'samples, whereby a 
'small amount of sample was placed on a slide, 
the stain was added and another slide was smeared across the surface to 
spread the stained material thinly. A coverslip was then added. Photographs 
were taken of suitable fields, as quickly as possible, in order to prevent 
the samples from drying out. Samples were stained and 'photographed using 
the following procedures: 
(a) A strong solution of Lugol's Iodine, so that the starch granules were 
stained black and proteinaceous material was stained orange/red. Photographs 
were taken using 'Bright Field' at objective magnification x20, with a light 
setting of approximately 8.0 units (exposure time 0.017 see).

magnification used was x20, with a light setting of 12 units and an exposure 
time of 0.25 sec,,. The same fields photographed in this way, were also photo- 
graphed using polarised-light, to facilitate identification of starch granules 
and to investigate the extent of starch damage. For this purpose the light 
setting was 12 units with an exposure time of 2 to 8 sec 
(c) Toluidine blue stain (Flint and Firth, '1981); using this stain, samples 
were prepared, mounted, covered, as described above, and photographed at 
a light setting of 9.0 units and exposure time of 0.017 sec . 
Toluidine blue is an ortho-chromatic stain, i. e. it can colour different 
constituents in different colours (Flint and Firth, 1981). It is a basic 
dye of blue colour which, in the presence of materials containing acid groups 
(metachromatic materials), such as (carbohydrates-. -hemicelluloses and pectins) 
and proteins, it will stain in a range of colours from purple to red. 
(2) Starch Rranule measurement: An eye-piece was 'calibrated by use of a 
stage micrometer, such that one division was equivalent to 3.5 Um at an objective 
magnification of x20. The sample to be investigated was stained with iodine 
stain on a watch glass (iodine in potassium iodide, or Lugol's Iodine), such 
that the starch granules were blue-black. A small amount of the stained 
material was mounted on a glass slide, from the tip of a glass rod, and 
covered with a coverslip. Preliminary observations of starch granule size 
were made in order to group the granules into size ranges by diameter. Where 
granules were not spherical the longest diameter was used. With the aid of 
a five-channelled, tally counter, approximately 200 to 300 observations of 
starch granule-size were taken on each of two separate slides, in five size 
ranges, as described in Chapter 4. The-starch granule sizes were then converted 
into micrometers and put into the relevant size range. Mean data for each 
size range werethen tabulated. 
2.3 ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES 
2.3.1 Moisture 
Approximately 2g samples of legume flour or air-classified fractions, 
were accurately weighed into aluminium moisture dishes. They were heated 
for lh at 130 
0C 50C in an oven , cooled in a desiccator containing dehydrated 
silica gel and reweighed (AOAC, 1975 , method 14-004). 
Dry weight yields of air-classified fines and coarse fractions were 
calculated by the following equation: 
Dry weight yield Dry weiRht of sample (g) 
Dry weight original flour (g) 
2.3.2 Determination of Total NitroRen For Estimation of Crude Protein 
P-11 Xjeldahl nitrogen determinations for this study were carried out using 
a Technicon thermostated aluminium digester block, holding 250ml Kjeldahl 
tubes, and a Technicon Autoanalyser Ill system. The nitroprusside-salicylate- 
hypochlorite system was used with the latter equipment, for the determination 
of ammonia (Crook and Simpson, 1971). Approximately 0.5g whole flour, 0.3g 
fines fractions and 0.2g coarse fractions were weighed accurately and digested 
according to the method of Marshall and Walker (1978). This is a short method 
of digestion which uses. hydrogen peroxide, with selenium as catalyst. The 
aluminium block was preheated for all determinations and during digestion 
small filter funnels with sealed-off ends, were placed into the tops of the 
Kjeldahl tubes in order to reduce acid loss. Three replicate analyses of 
each sample were carried out. All data were calculated on a dry weight basis 
as crude protein. Where appropriate, for each run of the air classifier, 
protein yield (%) and protein shift (%) were calculated from crude protein 
and dry weight yield data for the fines.

2.3.3 Starch 
Starch analysis was carried out using the method of Southgate (1969), 
with enzyme digestion of starch by amyloglucosidase (Boehringer), using a 
Carlo-Erba Autoanalyser (Erba Science) for determination of glucose. Glucose 
was determined by a colour reaction with neocuproin (Fisons), which was 
measured spectrophotometrically. 
2.3.4 Dietary Fibre 
Acid detergent fibre (ADF) was determined by the method of Goering and 
Van Soest (1970). ee Figure'16). Detergent fibre analysis (carried out as 
shown in Figure 16)_makes use of the fact that quaternary ammonium compounds 
dissolve polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids. By further analysis, 
lignin was determined. Ash values were obtained by placing ADF residues in 
a muffle furnace at 600 
0C for 3h and recording weight loss. Cellulose values 
were calculated by subtracting ash and lignin from ADF, as ADF corresponds 
to cellulose, lignin and ash. 
Hemicellulose was calculated by subtracting values for sugars (excluding 
glucose), crude protein, -starch, and ADF from 100%. -The hemicellulose values 
obtained are therefore estimations, as they include lipid and glucose,, which 
were not analysed. However, lipid and glucose levels of all those legumes 
studied are low and fairly consistent between varieties (see Tables 2 and 7, 
Chapter 1). 
Neutral detergent fibre (NDF)-was determined by the method of Goering 
and Van Soest (1970) and additionally by the method of Terry and Outen (1973), 
in which starch in the sample waspredigested using amyloglucosidase (Boehringer). 
followed by refluxing in neutral detergent solution. NDF corresponds to 
total insoluble dietary fibre, i. e. cellulose, -lignin and insoluble hemi- 
cellulose.

and sucrose'by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The detection 
system used was refractive index (model 750/13, ACS), high pressure pump 
(model 750/03, ACS), chart recorder (model BS600 Bryans, &-; itchFz, Surre-1).

The differential refractive-index detector is a bulk-property detector. 
The refractive index of a cell., filled with mobile phase, is compared to that 
of an analytical cell (which initially only contains mobile phase), through 
which the column eluent flows. The refractive indices will balance until 
a solute enters the analytical cell. When this occurs, an electrical signal 
is generated, which can be amplified and transfered to a recorder. 
The composition of'the mobile phase used for HPLC in this study was 
42: 58 WO, water: acetonitrile (Rathbum), respectively, degassed under 
vacuum. This was used at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. 
Sucrose, raffinose, stachyose (all from BDH) and verbascose (a gift 
from Dr. E. Cristofaro, Nestle, Switzerland) standards Bmg/m4), were used 
at the beginning and end of each run. Peak height was used to quantify the 
oligosaccharide and sucrose present in each sample. 
The response of the refractive index detector to raffinose, stachyose 
and verbascose was found to be linear, using standards of 2,4,6,8 and 10 
mg/ml, which covered the concentration range of the samples (see Figure 17).

3.1 AIR JET SIEVE 
3.1.1 Experiment 1: The Effect of Alumina on Measurement of Particle-Size 
Distribution of Cowpea Flour UsinR the Air Jet Sieve 
3.1.1.1 Experimental methodology 
The aim of this Experiment was to establish the applicability, of the 
air jet sieve for particle-size analysis of cowpea flour. Preliminary work 
had indicated that the finer air jet sieves were prone to blinding during 
analysis. The manufacturers of the air jet sieve (Alpine) recommended the 
use of alumina to prevent this problem. The design of Experiment 1 is shown 
in Figure 18. Four sieves were used for this Experiment, i. e. 15,32,45 and 
63 Vm sieves, the 32 to 63 Pm sieves being a series. The 15pm sieve was used 
independently of the other sieves, as different fittings were used on the 
air jet'sieve to accomodate its smaller size. The other difference in 
operation of the 15vm sieve)in comparison with the others, was that the time 
taken for the maximum weight of particles to pass through the sieves of the 
32 to 63 Um sieves series was shorter U min) than for the l5um sieve (8 min). 
The effect of alumina (Aerosil -R972 standard, Degussa Frankfurt-M, 
West Germany) as an anti-sticking agent, was studied in comparison with the 
same flour without alumina, using a single batch of cowpea flour (variety 1, 
flour batch Ml, see Tables 11 and 12), milled through the Alpine universal 
10OLU mill using a 0.2mm ras-o-trapeze screen. The experimental design was 
carried out in a completely randomised order.

Each lOg sample (with 2% alumina) was first placed on top of a 32pm 
sieve of the air jet sieve for 4 min and the weight of the sample remaining 
on the sieve recorded. The sample remaining on the 32um sieve was then 
transferred to a 45um sieve for 4 min and similar measurements were recorded. 
Finally, the sample remaining on the 45um sieve was transferred to a 63lm 
sieve and the process above was repeated. The fraction from the top of the 
63um sieve was collected and stored for moisture determination. 
In addition to these measurements, ten lg samples of cowpea flour 
(with 2% alumina) were passed through the 1511m microsieve, and the fraction 
remaining on the sieve weighed and collected for moisture determination. 
Ten replicate samples of cowpea flour without alumina (N) were treated 
in the same way as those with alumina. The relative humidity (%) and 
temperature (00) of the laboratory atmosphere were recorded and pressure 
within the air jet sieve checked for each run. 
Statistical analysis of the weights of flour passing through each sieve 
and the moisture contents of the flours remaining on the 15wm and 63pm sieves 
was carried out using analysis of variance, the Students' T test and the 
standard error of the'difference of two mean's (SED; ' 2s , where 
-s is the Ari 
standard deviation and r the number of replicates). 
3.1.1.2 Results Experiment 1 
The mean weight of whole cowpea flour batch Ml passing through the 15, 
32,45 and 631im air jet sieves, with and without addition of alumina, are 
shown in Table 14 and Figure 19 (these were calculated from the weight of 
flour remaining on each sieve, for each of 10 replicate samples). Statistical 
analysis of results for the 32 to 63Pm sieves, using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) are given in Table 14, and revealed that treatments differed signif- 
icantly at the 0.1% level. A further breakdown of treatment into sieve size, 
alumina addition and interaction of sieve size and alumina, showed that 
significant (0.1%) interaction of alumina with sieve size occuired (Table 14). 
This interaction is illustrated in Figure 19, where the lines for percentage 
weight particles passing through the air jet sieves, with and without alumina 
addition, cross over, between the 15 and 32 Vm sieves. However, sieve size 
contributed most of the difference between the two treatments as was expected 
(Table 14). The interaction effects observed for alumina and sieve size made 
it necessary to consider the sieves individually, using the Studentls T test. 
Alumina had no effect on the percentageweight ofparticles passing the 321im 
sieve, as indicated in Figure 19 and Table 14, but had a significant positive 
effect on the weight of flour passing through the 45wm sieve (0.1%) and the 
63pm sieve. A Student's' T test of results from the 1511m sieve. revealed 
that addition of alumina had a significantly negative effect on the weight 
of flour passing through the 15um sieve (0.1%, Table 15), as it decrease-d 
the amount of flour passing through. 
The moisture of flour remaining on the 15 and 63 Um. sieves is shown in 
Table 16 and was not effected by alumina, as shown by Studen-es- T-test (Table 16). 
Values for moisture content ranged from 10.2 to 10.5 % (means of 10 replicates), 
and were consistently lower in moisture content than the original flour batch 
Ml (10.9% moisture).

3.1.1.3 Discussion Experiment 1 
Contradictory results were obtained. between the effects of alumina on 
the dry weights of cowpea flour passing through the 151im and 32 to 63 um air 
jet sieves. Statistical analysis of data revealed that alumina'decreased 
the passage of flour through the 15Pm sieve mesh, had no effect on the 32VM 
sieve and increased the passage of flour through the 45 and 63pm sieve 
meshes (Figure 19). The findings on the 15pm microsieve, were in contrast 
to the recommendations of Alpine (leaflet BV 390/17E), which stated that 
alumina was useful as an antisticking agent for all sieves, particularly the 
microsieves. The recommendations had been supported by Fedec (1980), who 
had analysed the particle-size distribution of pintobean flour using the 
air jet sieve. He found, that 2% alumina increased the percentage weight 
passing through the 10 to 30 vm microsieves. 
Air jet sieving was also found to have a drying out effect on whole 
cowpea flour, with or without alumina (Table 16), although there was no obvious 
relationship with the atmospheric conditions on the day of operation (Figure 20). 
It may be, that for legume flours, alumina is effective for the 15vm microsieve, 
if the moisture of the flour is low. This would explain the results of Fedec 
(1980), since the flour moisture in his experiments was reduced from 12 to 8%. 
As several workers, such as Fedec (1980), Sosulski et al. (1979) and 
Youngs (1975), have chosen to use a separation cut size of ca. 1511m, for suc- 
cessful air classification of grain'legume flours, the 15um microsieve was 
potentially the most useful of the air jet sieves available for use in this 
project. In view of the results of this experiment using alumina, it was 
decided to discontinue use of alumina. Further work was needed on the effect 
of changes in moisture content of cowpea flour, on air jet sicLving, with 
emphasis on its effects on the 15wm microsieve (Experiment 2).

Measurement of Particle-Size Distribution usinR the Alpine Air 
Jet Sieve A20OLS 
3.1.2.1 Experimental Methodol2. gy 
The aim of Experiment 2 was to establish whether the moisture content of 
cowpea flour affected the measurement of particle-size distribution using 
the air jet sieve. Three. 100g samples of cowpea flour (batch M1, see Table 12) 
were taken. The moisture contents of two of these samples were then altered, 
such that one was dried (to ca. 8%), one was moistened (to ca. 14%) and one 
remained untreated (ca. 11%) (For procedures involved see Section 2.1). These 
flours were then passed through the air jet sieve; as seven, lOg samples 
for the 32,45 -and 63 ijm sieves and seven, lg samples for the 15pm sieve, as 
described in Experiment 1. The experimental design was completely randomised 
and is shown in Figure 21. The weight of flour passing through each sieve, 
and moisture of the final fractions remaining on the 63pm and 15wm sieves 
were determined. Statistical analysis of results included analysis of variance 
and the Studens T test, as well as the standard error of the difference 
of two means.

Differences in weight passing through the air jet sieve of 5 to 10%, would 
be of practical significance. When flour moistened to 14.1% was used, the 
weight of flour passing through the 15um sieve was decreased by 9%, in comparison 
with the untreated flour (original moisture content 10.9%, see Table 18). 
For the 32,45 and 63 Um sieves, use of moistened flour, decreased the weight 
of flour passing through the sieves by 1.6,0.2 and 0.7% respectively (Table 18% 
in comparison with the untreated flour. When dried flour (7.7% original 
moisture) was used for air jet sieving, a reduction in weight passing through 
the sieves, of 5.2%, was observed for the 15pm sieve and of 1.5,0.6 and 0.9 % 
for the 32,45 and 63 Um sieves respectively (Table 18). Analysis of variance 
(Table 17) for the 32 to 63 lim sieve series, revealed that the differences 
in weight passing through the sieves using different flour moistures, were 
significant at the 5% level. Further analysis by Students' T-test (Table 17) 
showed that these differences were only significant for the 321im sieve and

then, only between moistened and untreated flours (1%) and dried and untreated

the highest percentage of flour passing through the air jet sieve when 
untreated flour was used. 
The moisture contents of the samples remaining on the 15 and 63 Um air

thus, the moistened samples had been dried and the dried samples, moistened, 
during air jet sieving. Analysis of variance was carried out on the data 
in Table 20 for the 15 abd 63 Pm sieves together (Table 19).

Sieve size was found to have no effect on moisture of flour remaining on the 
sieve after air jet sieving and interaction between sieve size and moisture content 
was not significant. However, a significant-difference was found to exist 
between moisture contents of the samples remaining on the sieves for-, the 
different treatments. Student:  T-test (Table 19) for data using the 151im- 
sieve, showed that only dried and-untreated flour samples gave fractions 
remaining on the sieves,, with significantly different moisture contents. 
Variability of weight of flour passing through the air jet sieve for 
each set of 7 replicates, was higher for the 15vm sieve (SED of 2 means 1.69) 
than for the 32 to 63 vm sieve series (SED of 2 means 0.54, see Table 18). 
Variability of mean data for moisture content of flour samples remaining on 
the 15 to 63 jim. sieves was low (SED of 2 means 0.51, Table 20). 
A comparison of percentage weight of cowpea flour passing through the 
15 and 32 um air jet sieves from Experiments 1 and 2, is given in Table 21 
with data from Fedec (1980) for dehulfed, pin--milled- pintobeans for 
comparative purposes. For Experiments 1 and 2, data for the 151lm microsieve 
can be seen to be more variable than that of the 321im sieveas shown by the 
higher SED of two means. 
3.1.3.2 Discussion Experiment 2 
Raising the moisture content of whole cowpea flour from 10.9 to 14.7%, 
or lowering it from 10.9 to 7.7%, was found to decrease the percentage of 
flour passing through the 15 to 63 vm sieves of the Alpine air jet sieve - 
k2OOLS (Table 18). However, these differences were only statistically sig- 
nificant for the 15um microsieve and the 32Um sieve (Table 17). Fedec (1980) 
reported that the moisture content of whole grains affected particle-size 
distribution of pintobean flour, using the Alpine air jet sieve A20OLS. The 
results of Fedecs work are given in Table 21, for comparison with the results 
of this study, as they were carried out using the same sievesand'show that 
the dehulled pinto bean flour contained a higher proportion of fine particles 
than did whole cowpea flour, at both 15 and 32 Um. However, Fe'dec worked with 
dehulled seeds, which would yieid a higher proportion of fines than whole seedsj 
and also used a different type of mill (Alpine Contraplex A250 pin mill). 
In addition, these differences may be due to differences in seed character- 
istics between species. On the other hand, the percentage of particles between 
15 and 32 Um was similar for both whole cowpea flour and dehulled pintobean 
flour (Table 21), ranging from 39.1 to 51%. Thus differences in particle- 
size distribution between these two flours occur mainly below 15 and above. 32um.

In contrast to data obtained in Experiment 2, using whole beans of 
four different moisture contents, Fedec (1980) found that the greatest 
percentage of particles passed through the air jet sieve, when the flour was 
equilibrated to 7.80% moisture (Table 21). However, as this altered the 
moisture of the beans before milling, it was not clear whether moisture of 
the legume affected its particle-size distribution during milling, or 
whether the moisture content of the flour affected subsequent particle-size 
analysis using the air jet sieve. 
The moisture of flour samples remaining on the sieves was only signif- 
icantly different for the 15im sieve and only between dried and untreated 
flour samples (Table 19). The other samples were found to equilibrate to 
similar moisture contents (ca. 9%). regardless of the original moisture contents 
of the flour, or the size of the sieve used for analysis (Table 20). Therefore, 
flour high in moisture content was dried, while flour low in moisture content 
was moistened, by the air flow within the air jet sieve. This equilibrating 
effect was not obviously related to atmospheric conditions on the day of the 
experiment as discussed in Experim-ent 1, despite the fact that so much air 
is drawn into the machine during operation. 
There was a large difference in percentage particles passing through 
the 15 compared to the 32 um sieves, in both Experiments 1 and 2, and for whole 
cowpea flourand also in the work of Fedec (1980) for pintobean flour (Table 21). 
These differences show that there is a change in particle-size distribution 
between 15 and 32 pm. From published data on starch granules sizes of 
grain legumes (Table 1), it is likely that much of the material lying between 
15 to 32 um is starch granules. 
This study of the air jet sieve has revealed the importance of the 15Pm 
microsieve for particle-size analysis of grain legume flours. Unfortunately, 
this sieve has been found to produce consistently more variable results for 
percentage cowpea flour passing through the air jet sieve, than the other 
sieves (Table 21). 
The data for this Experiment. on the weight of flour passing through the 
15 and 32 jim sieves, for cowpea flour of different moisture contents, has 
implications for legume flours in general, analysed by this method of 
particle-size analysis, as whole legumes vary considerably in their moisture 
contents. 
3.2 THE MILL 
Principles of the Alpine universal mill 10OLU and the methods of operation, 
were discussed in Section 2.2.1 
3.2.1 Experiment 3: The Effect of Mill Feed Rate and Running Time on 
Particle-Size Reduction of Whole-Milled Cowpeas and Moisture Content 
of Flour. 
Experimental methodology 
This experiment was designed to study the effect of mill feed rate and 
mill running time on particle-size distribution of cowpea flour. The effect 
of mill running time was studied to determine any effect of increased heating 
of the mill, as milling proceeded. Whole cowpeas (variety 1, Table 11) 
were used for this Experiment. To study the effect of mill feed rate, three 
feed rates were chosen, one considered to be fast (ca. 18.0 kg/h),, one 'normal' 
(ca. 8.5 kg/h) and one slow (ca. 6.5 kg/h), (see Table 12). Using a stop- 
watch to maintain the appropriate feed rate, the cowpeas were fed by hand 
into the mill in 250g batches. The order of milling of the batches was 
recorded (a, b, c and d). For each feed rate, four, 250g batches (total lkg), 
were fed through the mill and collected individually. Three replicates were 
carried out for each feed rate and the mill was turned off briefly between 
collections. All experimentation for a single feed rate was carried out on 
one day. 
The experiment was designed as a split-plot, with 9 main plots (3 mill 
feed rates x three replications), as shown in Figure 23, and was carried out 
in a completely randomised order. 
Moisture determinations were carried out on all the milled flour batches 
(single analyses, 36 replicates in all). Analysis of particle-size distribution 
was carried out on all samples, using the air jet sieve as in Experiment 1 
(single analyses for each sample),, using the 32 to 63 ilm sieve series and the 
15um microsieve, without the use of alumina. The weights of flour remaining 
on each sieve were recorded. 
Analysis of variance and Student's T-test were carried out on resulting

3.2.1.2 Results Experiment 
The results of Experiment 3 are given in Tables. 22 to 25. The effect 
of. feed rate of whole cowpeas variety 1 (see Table 11 for description) into 
the Alpine 10OLU universal mill, on particle-size distribution of whole cowpea 
flour using the 15 - 63 lim air jet sieves, is shown in Figure 24. For the 
151lm air jet sieve, 22.1%, 24.5% and 27.3% of the weight of the flour samples 
passed through the air jet sieve, for flours produced at 6.5,8.5 and 18.0 kg 
mill feed rates, respectively (Table 23). For the 32 to, 63 Um sieve series, 
a higher percentage of flour passed through- the air jet. sieves at 8.5-kg/h,. 
than at either of the other two feed rates (Table 23). 
The moisture content-, of the flours after milling at the three feed rates, 
carried out as four 250g flour batches for each feed rate. are shown-in 
Table 25. Little difference in moisture content of flours was found between 
feed rates 6. '5 and'8.5 kg/h, but the moisture content of the flour for the 
fast feed rate(18.0 kg/h) was higher (see Table 25). 
Analysis of covariance was under taken initially, using thecomputer 
package 'Genstatt, on the 15 and 32 lim sieves, for all data in Tables 23 and. 
25. The treatments were feed rate and batch of flour milled (a, b, c, d, 
see Figure 23) with moisture as covariate. This showed that batch did not' 
effect moisture of the flour at any feed-rate studied, therefore a subsequent 
analysis of variance (shown in Tables 22 and 24) was carried out without the 
covariate. As the 32 to-63 lim sieves are a related series-and interest'is 
placed mostly on particles under 32pm in this project, analysis of variance 
was carried out for data from Table 23 for the 15 and 32 Vm sieves only. 
From this analysis, batch of flour milled was found to have no significant 
effect on %. weight of cowpea flour passing the 15 and 32 lim sieves (Table 22). 
However, % weight of cowpea flour passing the 1511m and 32pm sieves was found 
to be significantly effected by feed rate (5% and 1% level, -of significance, 
respectively). T-testing of data for the 32VM sieve showed that there was 
no difference in particle-size distribution, as shown by air jet sieve data, 
between flours produced at feed rates 6.5 and 18.0 kg/h (65.2% and 63.7% 
flour passing through the 32Vm sleverespectively), but feed rate 8.5 kg/h 
had a significantly finer particle-size distribution (69.8% flour passing 
through the 32Vm sieve). This is illustrated in Figure 24 for the 32 to 
63 vm sieve series.

However, for the 15pm sieve there was a significant difference (5%) in particle- 
size distribution between flours at the three different feed rates, by analysis 
of variance (Table 22), -and T-testing showed that feed rate 18.0 kg/h had a 
significantly finer particle-size distribution than feed rates 6.5 and 8.5 
kg/h (see Tables 22 and 23). No differences in particle-size distribution 
were found between feed rates 6.5 and 8.5 kg/h (Figure 24). 
The effect of mill feed rate on moisture content of flour (Table 25), 
was found to be statistically significant (0.1% level) by analysis of variance 
(Table 24). T-testing (Table 24) revealed that there was nodifference in 
moisture content between flour batches, milled at 6.5 and 8.5 kg/h (10.3 and 
10.1 %, respectively), but flour milled at 18.0 kg/h had a significantly higher 
moisture content (0.1% level) than the other two feed rates (11.4%). 
The reproducibility of air jet sieve data in this experiment is shown 
by the standard error of the mean (SEM) for'each mean value in Table 23; ' 
For Experiment 3, it was consistently low for all data regardless of'sieve 
size or feed rate. If the results of Experiments 1,2 and 3 are compared for 
the weight of flour passing through the 15 and 32 Um air jet sieves (Table 
26), it is found that data)obtained under similar conditions, are variable.

3.2.1.3 Discussion Experiment 
Sample batch (a, b, c, d, see Figure 23) of whole cowpeas (variety 1, 
see Table 11) was studied, to monitor the effect of running time of the mill. 
Heat build up may occur within the mill during milling of large samples and 
could affect the moisture content of the flour and/or particle comminution 
However, using the Alpine air jet sieve A20OLS for particle-size analysis, 
it was found that the batch used did not affect particle comminution of whole 
cowpeas by the Alpine 10OLU universal mill, nor did it affect the moisture 
content of the flour (Tables 22 and 24). Thus, in future work, small or 
large samples can be milled withileknowledge that the particle-size distribution 
of the legume flour is not affected. 
The particle-size distribution of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was found 
to be affected by mill feed rate, using the air jet sieve for particle-size 
analysis, for the sieves considered to be of most use in this work. (15 and 
32 jim, see Table 22). However, conflicting results were obtained for these 
two sieves, with respect to which feed rate produced the finest flour. A 
feed rate fo 8.5 kg/h produced a significantly finer flour than did feed 
rates 6.5 or 18.0 kg/h, according to a Student' T-test for data from the 
321im sieve (see Figure 24). In contrast, a feed rate of 18.0 kg/h produced 
a finer flour according to data from the 15Pm sieve (see Figure 24). The 
15wm air jet sieve was previously found to give similarly conflicting results 
with the 32 to 63 um sieve series (Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiments 
1 and 2, results for the 151jm sieve were more variable than those for the 
32 to 63 Pm sieve series (Tables 15 and 18) and it was concluded that data 
obtained from the 151im sieve should be treated with caution. 
There are a few reports in the literature of the effects of feed rate 
on particle-size distribution of flour. Thus, using the Alpine Contraplex 
A250 pin mill, which is a much larger scale mill than the 10OLU mill, 
Fedec (1980) found that fast feed rates (400 to 600 kg/h) did not provide 
adequate particle-size reduction of Great Northern whitebean flour, as the 
material passed through the mill too quickly for thorough comminution . 
This author advised the use of slower feed rates (150 kg/h). Additionally, 
Jones (1960) found that the particle-size distribution of wheat flour was 
finer when slower feed rates were employed, using a fluid energy mill. The 
work of these two authors is thBrefore in agreement with data obtained using 
the 32pm air jet sieve in Experiment 3, i. e. that faster feed rates led to 
larger particle-size distributions. However, work reported in Experiment 3 
for the 32pm sieve, suggested that very low feed rates also increased particle- 
size distribution. Data obtained using the 15Pm air jet sieve in Experiment 
3 showed that faster feed rates led to finer particle-size distributions. 
However, variability was considerably higher for the 15Vm sieve than for the 
32iin sieve (Table 26). Differences between 15vm data were therefore considered 
to have no practical significance at fast and 'normal' feed rates, and a 
feed rate of close to 8.5 kg/h was adopted for all future work reported in 
this thesis. 
Moisture loss during milling of whole cowpeas was significantly less 
when a fast feed rate of 18.0 kg/h wqs- used. However, different moisture 
losses did not affect the particle-size distribution of cowpea flour, accord- 
ing to covariance analysis-, thus differences in particle-size distribution 
were due to feed rate (Table 24). However, if the results of Experiment 2 and 
3 are compared, the differences in particle-size distribution. caused by 
changing feed rate, are much smaller than those caused by altering moisture 
content of the flour (see Tables 18 and 23). In contrast with these findings, 
Jones (1960) found that moisture content of wheat flour did not affect 
particle-size distribution. 
Comparable data for weights of flour (milled under similar conditions) 
passing through the air jet sieves in Experiments 1,2 and 3 (Table 26) were 
found to be variable for both the 15 and 32 pm sieves. As the measurement 
of particle-size distribution was important for a study of air classification, 
it was concluded from Experiments 1,2 and 3, that another method of measure- 
ment would have to be investigated alongside the air jet sieve (Experiment 6 
and Experiment 9). For this purpose, the Coulter counter was selected. No 
such comparison of methods of particle-size analysis has been reported in 
the literature for food materials, although Brown et al. (1970) compared 
the Coulter counter and air jet sieve for particle-size analysis of Portland 
cement.

3.2.2.1 Experimental MethodoLaU 
The aim of this Experiment was to establish whether the particle-size 
distribution of legume flour could be affected during milling, by the moisture 
content of the seeds. The Experiment was of a completely randomised design 
and is shown in Figure 25. Whole cowpeas (Variety 1, see Table 11) were 
divided into three 500g batches. The moisture contents of two of these

batches were altered, such that one was dried (ca. 8%) and one was roistened

batches of cowpeas were then milled through the 10OLU Universal Mill (Alpine), 
at feed rates of ca. 11 kg/h and the resulting flour samples were stored in 
air-tight containers at room'temp-erature, (see Table 12 for"details of sample 
codes). Three, 100g sub-samples from each flour were then air-classified 
at classifier speed 8.5 Kc le rpm and air flow rate 46.5 M3 /h, at a constant 
feed rate of 0.6 kg/h. The resulting finesand coarse fractions were weighed 
and stored for analysis. Moisture determinations were carried out on the 
three flour samples in duplicate and on the fines and coarse fractions obtained 
after air classification. The particle -size distributionsO replicates)i 
of the whole flour samples were investigated by Coulter counter (see Section 
2.2.2.2). 
Statistical analysis of results was carried out using analysis of 
variance and the standard error of the difference of two means. Variability

All data were collected at a single setting of the air classifier (8.5 x 103rpm). 
The moisture contents of the fine and coarse fractions produced by 
air-classification were shown to change in comparison with the whole flourr. 
Fractionation of moisture between fines and coarse fractions was alFo 
observed; the coarse fractions in all cases contained more moisture than 
their respective fines (Table 27). The moisture contents of the whole cowpea 
flour were dried, 8.9%; untreated, 11.3%; and moistened, 13.0% (Table 27).

The change in moisture content of -air-classified fractions was most marked 
in the dried and moistened flours (see Table 27). Thus, dried flour fines 
and coarse fractions gained moisture during air classification, while moistened 
flour fines and coarse flour fractions lost moisture. There was little change 
in the untreated flour fines and coarse fractions in comparison with the 
untreated whole flour. No significant differencesin the moisture contents 
of the fines fractions for the different treatments were found by analysis 
of variance (ANOVA). However, differences in the moisture contents of the 
coarse fractions were significant at the 0.1% level (ANOVA, Table 27) 
Analysis of variance of the dry weight yields of fines fractions, 
revealed a significant difference at the 0.1% level between the three 
moisture treatments. The dry weight yield of fines was found to be greatest 
for the dried flour (16.5%) and similar for both untreated and moistened flours 
(12.5 and 12.8 %, respectively, Table 27). 
I Further examination of data by Students' T-test showed, as expected, 
that the dried flour produced a significantly higher (0.1%) dry weight yield 
of fines than either the moistened or untreated flour (Table 27). No statist- 
ical differences in dry weight yield of the coarse fraction were found 
(Table 27). 
The reproducibility of mean data for all three moisture treatments is 
shown by the SED of 2 means (Table 27). This value is low in comparison with 
mean values for all measurements, indicating good reproducibility (although 
dry weight yield of coarse fractions has a higher SED of 2 means, the data 
have higher values too). 
The particle-size distributions of the three whole flour samples from 
this Experiment, determined by Coulter counter, are shown in Figure 26.

samples. for each flour batch, using the between-replicates mean square, showed 
that replication forthe dried flour was much less variable (0.39) than for 
the moistened flour (8-15) and the untreated flour (5.70, Figure 26). 
3.2.2.3 Discussion Experiment 
Differences in whole cowpea variety 1 moisture prior to milling. did 
not affect the particle-size distribution of the resulting whole flours (by 
Coulter counter analysis) to any practical extent (Figure 26). However, 
moisture differences may affect the uniformity of aggregation of particles, 
such that drier flours contain less agglomerates. This would explain why 
reproducibility of replication during particle-size analysis was higher for 
the dried flour in this Experiment. 
Drying whole cowpeas prior to milling (which produced a flour of 8.9% 
moisture), produced a 4% greater dry weight Bield of fines after-air classificatiorl, 
than was obtained using flour which had had the moisture content altered 
(11.4% moisture, Table 27). This would be of significance to industrial users 
of the process. 
Moistening whole cowpeas prior to'milling (which produced a flour of 
13.0% moisture) did not affect the dry weight yield of the fines or coarse 
fractions obtained after air classification (Table 27). The dry weight 
yields of these fractions were similar'to those of the untreated flour. 
This is thought to be due to drying out of the moistened flour, due to 
air-equilibration during classification, ' which reduced the moisture content 
of the fines fractions of both moistened and untreated legume flours to 
similar levels. 
Fractionation of cowpeas'by air classification in this work, -was there- 
fore most efficient, in terms of dry weight yield of fines after air class- 
ification, when whole cowpeas were dried to 8.9% moisture. This may be due 
to the fact that particles in drier legume flours are less adherent to each 
other during air classification.

3.3.1 Experiment 5: The Effect of Cowpea Flour Moisture on Sample 
Separation During Air Classification. 
3.3.1.1 Experimental methodology 
The aim of this Experiment was to establish whether differences in flour 
moisture could affect the fractionation of particles during air classification, 
as measured by dry weight yield and crude protein content (N x 6.25) of the 
fines. For this purpose a single batch of cowpea flour (Nl, for details 
see Table 12) was taken and divided into three 500g samples. The first' 
sample was left untreated (ca. 11% moisture). The moisture content of the 
second one was raised (ca. 15% moisture) and the moisture content of the 
third one was reduced (ca. 8% moisture, for details of procedure see Section 
2.1). The design of this Experiment is shown in Figure 27. Air classification 
was carried out in random order on three- 100g replicate subsamples of each 
flour sample, at classifier speed 8.5 x lOrpm and air flow rate 46.5 M3 /h, 
at a feed rate of 0.6 kg/h (100gl 10min). The fine and coarse fractions 
were weighed and stored for analysis. Moisture and total nitrogen determin- 
ations were carried out on the three flour batches and all the fines and 
coarse fractions collected from air classification (for details of method- 
ology see Section 2.2.1). Particle-size analysis of the untreated flour 
was also carried out by Coulter counter for comparison with the untreated 
flour in Experiment 4)as different flour batches were used for each Experiment 
(Table 12)pand analysed using a computer program (for details see Section 
2.2.2.2).

Results of Experiment 5 were analysed statistically using analysis of 
variance and the standard error of the difference of two means. A comparison 
of data from Experiments 4 and 5 was also made for moisture and dry weight 
yields of fines fractions, in order to investigate whether the time of 
moisture alteration affected air classification, using analysis of variance. 
3.3.1.2 Results Experiment 
The results of this Experiment are shown in Table 28. The moisture 
contents of the fines fractions after air classification were lower in all 
cases than the original whole flours. The dried flour (8.8% moisture) 
yielded fines fractions of 7.4% moisture. The untreated and moistened flours 
(10.6 and 15.5% moisture) yielded fines fractions of 8.8 and 9.0% moisture, 
respectively. Analysis of variance (Table 28) of moisture contents of the 
fines fractions revealed significant differences between the three treatments 
at the 1% level. T-testing showed that the dried flour fines contained 
significantly less moisture at the 1% level, than the moistened or untreated 
flour fines. There were no differences between moisture contents of untreated and 
moistened fines.

The dry weight yield of fines was lower when moistened flour was used for 
air classification than when dried or untreated flours were used; 14.8% 
moistened; 17.3%, dried; 17.1% untreated (Table 28). These observations were 
confirmed by analysis of variance and T test. The dry weight yield of the 
moistened flour was found to be significantly lower at the 1% level, than 
those of the other two treatments (which were not statistically different 
at the 5% level, Table 28). 
The crude protein content of the fines fraction fell into a similar 
pattern to the dry weight yields. The air-classified moistened flour, 
produced a fines fraction containing 46.8% protein (untreated, 49.3%, and 
dried 53-0% These data were found to be significantly different at the 
5% level (Table 28). T testing showed that the protein content of the 
moistened flour fines was significantly lower than the dried flour fines 
(2%), or the untreated fines (5%). However, there was no significant diff- 
erence between the protein contents of the dried and untreated flour fines 
fractions, at the 5% level. This is likely to be due to replicate variation, 
which was high for this parameter (SED of 2 means, 3.29, Table 28). 
Air classification of the dried cowpea flour. produced a fines fraction 
with a higher protein yield than the moistened or untreated flours (see 
Table 28). The protein yield of the fines fractions of three treatments 
were found to be significantly different, by analysis of variance, at the 
1% level (Table 28). Further testing using a Student'S' T-test revealed 
that the protein yields of all three treatments were significantly different 
from each other, i. e. 
the dried-cowpea flour fines fractions had a significantly 
higher protein yield than the untreated-flour fines fractions (at the 5% 
level) and also a significantly higher protein yield than the moistened- 
flour fines fractions, at the 1% level. Thus, the moistened flour fines 
fractions had the lowest protein yield (Table 28). 
Replicate variability was shown to be low for all measurements excepting 
protein content, as shown by the SED of 2 means (Table 28). A comparison 
of the air classification data from Experiments 4 and 5, in which whole 
cowpea moisture was altered before and after milling, respectively, was carried 
out (Tables 29 and 30). This comparison could be made because the same batch

of cowpeas (variety 1, Table 11) had been used for both Experiments. In 
addition, similar milling conditions had been used for the flour 
batch 
used in Experiment 5 (Nl) and the three flour batches used in Experimnent 
(Mll, M12 and13, see Table 12). 
In Table 30, data from Experiments 4 and 5 for the three moisture treat- 
ments dried, untreated and moistened, are given for moisture of whole flour, 
moisture of fines and dry weight yield of fines. 
Statistical analysis of results was carried out using analysis of variance 
for the moisture contents of the whole flours, -, and 
fines and the dry weight 
yield of the fines (Table 29), using the- untreated flours as controls. Inter- 
action, between time of moisture alteration and moisture content of the whole 
flours (moisture x time), was found to be significant at the 0.1% level (column 1, 
row 3). However, this interaction did not effect the moisture content of 
t he fines (column 2, row 3) or the dry weight yield of the fines (column 3, 
row 3, Table 29). 
A significant difference was found between the moisture contents of 
the dried and moistened whole flours of both Experiments analysed together, 
as would be expected (column 1, row 1), and also between the moisture contents 
of the whole flour of the two Experiments analysed individually (column 1,

to be significantly different between dried and moistened flours, for data

and 5 (Before v After).

3.3.1.3 Discussion Experiment 5 
Whole., milled cowpea flour, which had been dried to 8.8% before air class- 
ification, gave rise to fines fractions with-a significantly higher protein 
yield than flour which had been moistened or untreated prior to air class- 
ification (Table 27). Flour, which had been moistened to 15.5%, produced fines 
fractions with significantly lower dry weight yields, protein contents and 
protein yields (Table 27). 
Air classification greatly reduced (by 6.5%) the moisture content of 
the fines fractions of flour roistened to 15.5%, but had little effect on 
the finer, fractions of untreated and dried flours (Table 27). However, 
PFPS (1974) found that air classification of dehulled pea flour (5.6% moisture). 
considerably reduced the moisture content of the fines fractions, to 3.6%, 
whereas the coarse, fraction remained similar to the whole flour (5.3%). 
Youngs (1975) air-classified whole, field pea flour (moisture not given) and 
found that fines fractions contained less moisture (5.0%) than the coarse 
fractions (5.7%). 
Although the untreated-whole flours from Experiments 4 and 5 had similar 
moisture contents (Table 30), the moisture contents of the fines fraction 
were markedly different (11.0 and 8.8%)respectively, Table 30). Analysis 
of variance (Table 29) showed that these differences in moisture contents 
of the fines, were not due to the effect of time of moisture alteration 
(column 2, row 3),; thus, they must be due to other factors which differed 
during the two Experiments. The dry weight yield of the fines fractions 
for the untreated flours from Experiments 4 and 5 were also different (12.5 
and 17.1% respectively). Thus, the'driest, untreated fines fractions (Experiment 
5) gave rise to' the greatest yield of fines. As previously mentioned 
(Experiments 4 and 5), drying the flour caused a higher dry weight yield 
of fines after air classification. However, the extent of drying out, that 
occurs within'the air classifier, may also effect the dry weight yield of 
the. ines. 
The moisture content of the dried-whole flours of Experiments 4 and 5 
were similar (8.9% and 8.8%lrespectively, Table 30), although the moisture 
contents of the dried-flour fines varied by 2%. The dried-flour fines of 
Experiment 4 gained moisture (to 9.5%), whereas the dried-flour fines of 
Experiment 5, lost moisture (to 7.2%, Table 30). Overall, a greater drying 
out effect was observed between whole flour and fines in Experim'ent 5 than 
in Experiment 4, together with the higher dry weight yield of fines obtained 
in Experiment 5. 
The moisture content of the moistened-whole flour of Experiments 4 and 
5 varied by 2.5% (Table 30) and gave rise to fines fractions of lower moisture 
content (10.6 and 8-5%,, resectively, Table 30). Thus, a greater drying oTA 
effect occurred for the moistened flour of Experiment 5 than Experiment 
In addithn, the, dry weight yield of fines was higher for Experiment 5 than 
Experiment 4 by 2%. 
In all cases, the fines fractions of Experiment 5 had significantly 
lower moisture contents than the fines fractions of Experiment 4 ane also 
had significantly greater dry weight yields (row 2, Table 29). These differ- 
ences between Experime, nts 4 and 5 are likely to be due to different atmos- 
pheric conditions in the laboratory during air classification for the two 
Experiments, as they were carried out at different times of the year (Experiment 
4, July; Experiment 5, December). 
In both Experiments, the dry weight yields of the moistened flour fines 
were lower than the dried flour fines. Statistical testing of data showed 
that. although the moisture content of the whole flour is affected by the 
time of alteration (interaction, moisture x time, Table 29)5this interaction 
had no effect on the moisture contents or dry weight yields of, the fines 
fractions after air classification. 
The use of whole flours of closer moisture contents for each'experiment 
would have simplified interpretation of this work. As atmospheric conditions 
were, not recorded for Experiment 4 and 5, further work is needed to determine 
the effect of atmospheric conditions on moisture content and dry weight yield 
of fines. It was not possible to follow this line of study in this present 
work as (a), only a limited time was available and (b), there were no suitable 
facilities available, for controlling atmospheric humidity in the air class- 
ifier. 
The particle-size distributions of the untreated flour batches from 
Experiments 4 and 5 (Figure 29) showed only small differences (flour batches 
Ml and H13, Table 12), according to Coulter counter analysis. 
Differences between the two flour were ca. 5% cumulative volume at. 
particle sizes below 20pm and increased to ca. 7% beyond this size (Figure 
29). Indeed, particle size distribution cannot account for differences in 
dry weight yidd, as flour kom Experiment 4 was finer, but a greater fines dry 
weight yield was obtained in Experiment 5. Thus, most of the differences 
in dry weight yield and protein content of the fines fractions after air- 
classification, were due to the effect of moisture content of whole cowpea 
flours on the air classification process: moist flour particles may adhere 
more readily to the air classifier walls and to each other than drier 
flours. 
Vcther the moisture alteration occurs in the whole legume or the milled 
flour, the drier the fines fractions are, the greater the dry weight yield 
of the fines. Thus, to maximise dry weight yield of the fines, grain legumes 
should be conditioned to 8 to 9% moisture prior to air classification. 
Alternatively, data presented show that use of dry air may also increase 
dry weight yield of fines. This finding needs further investigation. 
Maximising the dry weight yield of fines will be of economical significance, if the 
production of legume protein concentrates by air-classification is used on an 
industrial scale. 
3.3.2 Experiment 6: The Effect of ChanRinR Sample Weight of Cowpea Flour 
on the Dry Weight Yield of Fines and Coarse Fractions Obtained from 
Air Classification. 
3.3.2.1 Experimental methodoloZy 
The aim of this Experiment, was to determine the variation between repli- 
cates at different sample weights, in order to decide whether the reproducibility 
of small sample weights was adequate for further work on air classification 
(i. e. 100g). Small sample weights would be preferable, as they would mean 
smaller amounts of sample would be needed and less time would be taken in 
air classification. This Experiment was a completely randomised design and 
can be seen in Figure 30. For each sample weight, 3 replicates were air- 
classified. A throug1put rate of 0.6 kg/h was used, and the feed drive 
motor was set at 6.5 units. The classifier speed was set at 8.5 x 
10' rpm and the air flow rate at 46.5 M3 /h. The fines and coarse fraction 
were weighed and stored for analysis (see Figure 30 for Experimental design). 
Moisture determinations were carried out on the whole flour and all fines 
and coarse fractions collected. Results were then analysed statistically 
using analysis of variance and Student's- T test, and the standard error of 
the difference of 2 means.

3.3.2.2 Results Experiment 6 
The effect of varying air classifier sample weight on dry weight yield 
and moisture contents of the fines and coarse fractions of air-classified 
whole cowpea flour (batch 11, see Table 12), is shown in Table 31. 
Using a sample weight of 100g. produced the greatest fines dry weight 
yield (19.2%, see Table 31). However, analysis of variance revealed that 
none of the dry weight yields in Table 30 were significantly different from 
each other at the 5% level. The dry weight yields of coarse fractions for 
the three different sample weights gave similar values (79.3 to 81.7%), 
with no practical differences. 
A reduction in moisture content of the fines occurred (from 8.6 to 8.0%) 
as sample weight was increased(Table 31). However, these differences in 
moisture content were not significant at the 5% level (Table 31). 
Fractionation of moisture between fines and coarse fractions occurred. 
The majority of the moisture was found to be associated with the coarse 
fractions (Table 31), with no trend between sample weights. A loss of moist- 
ure of 11.9 to 14.6 % occurred during air classification (Table 31). 
The variability of data was low and similar for both dry weight yield 
and moisture content of the air-classified fractions at all three sample 
weights, as shown by the SED of 2 means (Table 31).

3.3.2.3 Discussion Experiment 6 
Sample weight did not affect reproducibility of dry weight yield during 
air classification, for the fines or the coarse fractions (Table 31), 
YaSiability being low for all three sampIeweiAsinvestigated. Additionally, 
sampleyeight had no significant effect on dry weight yield of the fines 
fractions during air classification, despite the decreased moisture content 
of the fines fractions at larger feed quantities (Table 31). 
samji-e--w'eigh of 100g was therefore adopted for all future work with the 
Alpine zig-zag air- , classifier 100MZR, as it is a convenient weight. 
3.3.3 Experiment 7: The Effect of Changing Feed Rate of the Air Classifier 
on Yield of Fine and Coarse Fractions of. Air-Classified Cowpea Flour. 
3.3.3.1 Experimental methodoloR 
The aim of this Experiment was to establish whether fractionation of 
cowpea flour during air classification was affected by different feed rates. Too 
fast a feed rate maycause clogging in the classifier wheel and therefore 
affect dry, weight yield of finEsfractions. The experimental design was 
completely randomised and is shown in Figure 31. 
Three feed rates were choscn, one considered fast (ca. 1.0 kg/h), one 
average (ca. 0.7 kg/h), and one slow (ca. 0.4 kg/h). A stopwatch was used 
to maintain an even feed rate. The cowpea flour (Ml, for details see Table 12) 
was continuously tapped into the feeding device of the air classifier, from 
the sample bottle, using a plastic hammer. The feed drive motor was set at 
6.5,7.5 and 8.5 units, respectively, for the 0.4,0.7 and 1.0 kg/h feed rates, 
to help prevent clogging in the feed worm at faster feed rates (manufacturers 
information). Three 200g replic.. ates were carried out at each feed rate. 
The air classifier was set at 8.5 x 103 rpm and 46.5 m. 3 /h for the duration 
of the Experiment. The fines and coarse fractions were weighed and stored 
for analysis in air-tight containers. 
Moisture and total nitrogen determinations were carried out on the 
whole flour and all fine and coarse fractions produced (see Section 2.3. ). 
Results were expressed in terms of dry weight yield, crude protein content(%) 
and protein yield M. The results were then analysed statistically using 
analysis of variance, T test and the standard error of the mean (SEM;

3.3.3.2 Results Experiment 7 
The results of Experiment 7 are shown in Tables 32 and 33. Changing 
the feed rate of flour into the air classifier, from 0.4 kg/h to 1.0 kg/h, 
did not affect the moisture content of the fines or coarse fractions (Table 33) 
of cowpea flour. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference between

but not for the coarse fractions. T-testing revealed a significant difference 
at the 0.1% level, between the dry weight yields of the fines at feed rates 
0.4 kg/h and 1.0 kg/h, and at the 1% level, between feed rates 0.4 and 0.7kg/h, 
which could therefore be regarded as a group for statistical purposes. 
Values for the protein conten-, of the fines were 46.9.49.0 and 48.5% 
at 0.4,0.7 and 1.0 kg/h., respectively. Protein content of the coarse fraction 
showed no differences at any of the feed rates (20.7,20.1 and 20.8 %, respectively 
Table 33). Protein yields of the fines were found to be highest at the

Variability within and between mean data was low for all analyses, as 
shown by the residual mean square (Table 32) and the standard error of the

3.3.3.3 Discussion Experiment 7 
Changing the air classifier feed rate. did not affect the moisture or 
protein content of the fines and coarse fractions of air-classified whole 
cowpea flour (Batch Ml, see Table 12). However, dry weight yield and, hence, 
protein yield of the fines were affected (Tables 32 and 33). Of the three 
feed rates investigated (0-4,0.7 and 1.0 kg/h), the slow feed rate was found 
to give the highest dry weight and protein yield of the fines and the fast 
feed rate, the lowest (Tables 32 and 33). 
No data havebeen published on the effect of air-classifier feed rate 
on fractionation of grain legume flour. Slow feed rates for air classification 
are likely to produce maximum separation of legume flour from a commercial 
point of view. However, 
slow 
feed rates are likely to increase the costs 
of the air classification process. Differences between dry weight yields 
at feed rates 0.4 and 0.7 kg/h, although statistically significant, were not 
very great (19.4% compared with 17.3%, Table 33) from a practical point 
of view. Thus a value of between these two values was adopted for all 
future work as a comproymise between operation time and efficiency of 
separation during air classification. 
3.3.4 Experiment 8: The Influence of Small ChanRes in SettinR of Air Flow 
Rate or in Classifier Speed on DrV Weight Separation of Cowpea Flour 
by Air Classification. 
3.3.4.1 Experimental methodol2Zy 
During operation of the Alpine zig-zag air classifier 100MZR in previous 
Experiments in this Section,. fluctuation in air flow rate had been noticed, 
as measured by the float meter, at fixed settings of air flow rate and classi- 
fier speed. Variation in dry weight yield of the fines fractions of the 
same flour batch, subjected to air classification on separate occasions 
(Experiments 5 to 7), had been observed at the same air, classifier settings. 
This Experiment was therefore designed to establish the effect on the dry 
weight yield of the fines and coarse fractions, of small changes in air flow 
rate (and for completcness, of classifier speed) of similar magnitude to that which 
might occur during operation of the air classifier, or due to setting error 
on the part of the operator. 
Cowpea flour batch ML (for details see Table 12) was used throughout this 
Experiment. The experimental design was completely randomised, and is shown 
in Figure 32. All conditions for air classification, apart from classifier 
speed or air flow rate, were kept constant, as in Experiment 6. 
In the first part of this Experiment, classifier speed was maintained 
at 8.5 x 103 rpm, and five settings of air flow rate were chosen, namely, 
44.5,45.5,46.5,47.5 and 48.5 m3 /h, and five settings of classifier speed 
were chosen, namely 8.00,8.25,8.50,8.75 and 9.00 X 103 rpm. Two replicates 
were carried out at each setting. 
Weights of flour in the fines and coarse fractions were recorded and 
samples stored in air-tight containers, prior to moisture determination. 
The resulting dry weight yields were statistically examined using analysis 
of variance, Studens T-test and the standard error of the mean (SEM, --D- ).

3.3.4.2 Results Experiment 8 
The results of Experiment 8 are shown in Tables 34 and 35. Small increases 
in air flow rate (in steps of 1.0 M3 /h), were found to increase the dry weight 
yield of fines. 
-Table 
35. Analysis of variance (Table 34) showed that diff- 
erences in dry weight yield of fines were statistically significant at the 
0.1% level. Further T-testing indicated that no significant differences 
occurred. unless the air flow rate settings were more than 1m3 /h apart 
(Table 34), for all the settings. The dry weight yields of the coarse fractions 
obtained decreased as air flow rate settings were increased (Table 35), except 
for 44.5 to 46.5 m3 /h. 
Small increases of classifier speed (in steps of 250 rpm) decreased 
the dry weight yield of fines (Table 35). Analysis of variance showed that 
differences in dry weight yield of fines were significant at the 0.1% level. 
T-testing revealed that no significant differences occurred between settings

of classifier speed which were less than 10OOrpm apart. This is shown in 
Table 34 for classifier speeds 9.00 V 8.00 x l0iPm. The dry weight yields 
of the coarse fraction increased as classifier speed increased except for 
8-5Dto 8.75 X 103 rpm, 
The variability of reproducibility for fixed settings of the air class- 
ifier was shown to be considerable by the standard error of the mean 
(Table 35). In addition the variability of mean data was greater, in the 
fines fractions, when classifier speed was altered, than when air flow rate 
was altered (SEM data, Table 35), as shown by the residual mean squares 
(Table 34). Additionally, dry weight yield losses were minimal (Table 35). 
3.3.4.3 Discussion Experiment 8 
It was found in this Experiment, that dry weight yield of the fines 
fractions of air-classified whole cowpea flour (batch Ml, see Table 12) 
was significantly offected, when air flow rate settings were varied by more 
than 1M3 /h. The scale on the flotation chamber of the Alpine zig-zag air 
classifier (100MZR) is in lm 3 /h divisions, and has frequently (in Experiments 
5 to 7) been observed to vary by greater volumes than this at a fixed air 
flow rate setting. In addition, adjustments smaller than 1.0 M3 /h cannot 
be set accurately. Fluctuation in air flow rate, combined with operator 
error may therefore qffect the dry weight yield of fines fractions at 
individual separation cut sizes. 
Small changes in air flow rate had more effect on dry weight yield fract- 
ionation, than did small changes in classifier speed. Classifier speed 
changes only significantly affected fractionation, if they were in excess 
of 750 rpm (Table 34. ). This is unlikely to occur during operation of the 
Alpine zig-zag air classifier 100MZR, as the scale is finely divided (100rpm) 
and does not fluctuate during operation to any significant extent. On the 
other hand, variability of fines data, shown by the standard error of the 
mean (Table 34), was greater at each setting when classifier speed was varied, 
than when air flow rate was varied, as was illustrated by the residual mean 
squares in analysis of variance (Table 34). 
Variability of air classification data, such as dry weight yield, using 
constant settings, is due only to a small extent to air flow rate fluctuation. 
Other parameters such as atmospheric conditions on the day of operation may 
also be involved, but these were not investigated. 
CHAPTER 
THE EFFECT OF CHANGING SEPARATION CUT SIZE OF THE ALPINE IOOMZR AIR 
CLASSIFIER ON FRACTIONATION OF COWPEA FLOUR (EXPERIMENT 9) , 
4.1 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
This Experiment involved a study of the behaviour of whole cowpea flour 
during air classification over a range of different separation cut sizes 
of the air classifier. The aims of the study were-two-fold. Firstly, to 
compare estimated separation cut sizes (from the calibration curve for 
cowpea, Figure 37) withthose calculated from a study of particle-size distri- 
bution of fines and coarse fractions. For this purpose, the particle-size 
distributions of the whole flours, fines and coarse fractions, at all the 
estimated separation cut sizes studied, were determined using a Coulter 
counter. The particle-size distributions of the fines fractions were also 
analysed using the air jet sieve, in order to compare the two methods. 
Light microscopy was used to measure the size of starch granules present 
in the whole flour and fines fractions at 3 different separation cut sizes, 
to corroborate Coulter counter data and starch analysis. 
Secondly, to establish the effect of changing separation cut size of 
the air classifier on the fractionation of components of whole cowpea flour 
during air classification. The conditions chosen for milling, air classification 
and for use of the air jet sieve were based on those established in Experiments 
1 to 8 (Chapter 3). 
Air classification of whole cowpea flour was carried out at estimated 
separation cut sizes 10 to 26 vm, corresponding to classifier speeds 11.6, 
11.0,10.4,9.7,9.3,8.9,8.5,8.0,7.8,7.5,7.3,7.2,6.9,6.7,6.5,6.4, 
and 6.2 X 103 rpm (matching values of air flow rate for given classifier 
speeds are shown in Table 13). Cowpea variety 1 was used throughout this 
Experiment as flour batch Ml (for details see Table 12). The Experiment 
was carried out in two parts, designated Experiment 9A and Experiment 9B; 
the latter being an extension of the former. For Experiment 9A, 11 separation 
cut sizes were chosen, ranging from classifier speeds 11.6 to 7.3 x 10' rpm. 
Three replicates were carried out at each classifier speed, using a constant 
feed rate of 0.6 kg/h and sample weight of 100g, based on data obtained 
for Experiments 6 and 7 (Chapter 3). 
For Experiment 9B, 10 separation cut sizes were chosen, ranging from 
classifier speed 8.0 to 6.2 X103 rpm and air classification was carried 
out in the same manner as for Experiment 9A. The experimental design of 
Experiments 9A and 911 was completely randomised for all 63 observations 
and is shown in Figure 33. The fines and coarse fractions obtained at each 
classifierspeed were weighed add stored for analysis in air-tight containers.

An overlap in separation cut size between Experiments 9A and 9B (classifier 
speeds 8.0,7.8,7.5 and 7.3 x 103 rpm) was chosen, to examine the repro- 
ducibility of air classification between the Experiments in terms of dry 
weight yield. moisture and crude protein content of the fines fractions. 
4.1.1 Particle-Size Analvsis of Whole Flour, Fines and Coarse Fractions 
4.1.1.1 Light microscopy 
The effect of air classification on fractionation of starch granules 
in whole cowpea flour (variety 1, see'Table 7 for details), and fines fractions 
at classifier speeds 8.9,7.2 and 6.2 X 103 rpm were studied. For this 
purpose, fines material from the 3 replicate samples obtained at each 
classifier speed (8.9 and 7.3 X 103 rpm) of Experiment 9A were pooled. 
Fractions from Experiment 9B were pooled (see Figure 33), 'for the samples 
at classifier speed 6.2 X 103 rpm. These three samples were chosen, to 
represent the range of separation cut sizes investigated. 
For each sample, two slides were prepared, stained with'Lugolls Iodine 
(Section 2.3.1.2) and ca. 200 observations were taken of starch granule 
diameter from each slide using an objective magnification of x 20, as described 
in Section 2.3.1.2. The starch granules were grouped together according 
to their size in micrometers and the results converted to percentage starch 
granules present in each size range. 
Photomicrographs of the whole cowpea flour were taken using'differential 
interference contrast (Plate 1) and then polarized light (Plate 2), as 
described in Section 2.3.1.2. This helped in the identification of comp- 
onents and illustrated the extent of starch damage. Photographs were also 
taken of all the fines samples studied, using Lugols' Iodine, in order to 
depict starch granules and protein, which stained blue/black and orange/red, 
respectively (Plates 4,5 and 6). 
4.1.1.2 Investigation of separation' cut size using the Coulter counter 
The particle-size distribution of whole cowpea flour and all fines 
and coarse fractions,, which had been air-classified (for details see Figure 
33) in Experiments 9A and 9B, were analysed by Coulter counter, in order to 
obtain their particle-size distributions, using the single threshold tech- 
nique (see Section 2.2.2.2 for details). For-those samples which overlapped 
in Experiments 9A and 9B, only those from Experiment 9A were used. For each 
sample analysed, cumulative weight of particles over a specific size wa5 
plotted against particle-size (diameter) using a computer program (for 
details see Section 2.2.2.2 and Appendix 1). For each set of replicate 
data, i. e. for a matching pair of fines and coarse samples, these plots 
were compared., (see Section 2.2.2.2 and Figure 12 for details) and the 
separation cut size calculated. The estimated separation cut size and 
that determined by Coulter counter were then compared. 
Statistical analysis of this Experiment involved, comparison of the 
slopes of the estimated calibration curve for cowpea and the Alpine cali- 
bration curve for limestone (see Section 4.2.1.2) by Students T-test. 
In order to interpret the differences between estimated separation cut 
size and measured separation cut size by Coulter counter, for whole cowpea, 
the equation for the es1imeted calibration curve for cowpea was derived. 
By back-inference from this equatio4 filling in all parameters excepting 
density of cowpeas, an estimate of the density of whole cowpea flour was 
obtained, for comparison with the density that had been used (see Section 
4.2.1.2). 
The standard error of the mean (SEM) was used to show the extent of 
variability in Coulter counter separation cut size data. Additionally, 
the replicate mean square was also used for thesedata to show the variability 
within particle-size distributionsof cowpea whole flour, fines and coarse 
fractions at classifier speed 7.2 x 103 rpm. 
4.1.1.3 Air Jet Sieve 
Whole cowpea flour and all fines fractions, which had been air-classified 
in Experiments 9A and 9B (see Figure 33 for details), were passed through 
the 15 um air jet sieve using the method described in Experiment 2, without 
the use of alumina (Chapter 3). For classifier speeds which overlapped 
in Experiments 9A and 9B (see Figure 33 for details), only those samples 
from Experiment 9A were used. The wbiht of sample passing through the 
sieve was recorded for each sample, as percentage weight under 15 um. 
Statintical analysis of data included a comparison with data obtained 
for the same samples using the Coulter counter by linear regression and 
use of the standard error of the mean to examine variability of data. 
4.1.2 Component Analysis of Fines and Coarse Fractions 
Moisture determination: - 
The whole cowpea flour and all air-cla, ssified fractions produced in 
Experiments 9A and 9B (see. Figure 33 for details) were analysed for moisture 
content M according to the method given in Section 2.3.1. 
Dry weight yield: - 
The dry weight yields of all the air-classified fractions from 
Experiments 9A and 9B were calculated. The fines and coarse fractions were 
weighed after each run of the air classifier, giving a wet weight value 
which was then adjusted for moisture to give the dry weight (g). Dry weight 
yields were then calculated as described in Section 2.3.1. 
Total nitroRen (for estimation of Crude Protein): - 
Crude protein was estimated for the whole flour and all fines fractions 
from Experiments 9A and 9B, and for the coarse fractions of Experiment 9A. 
Total nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method (see Section 2.3.2) 
and crude protein was estimated as Nx6.25. As data obtained using the 
Kjeldahl method is prone to considerable variation (Walker, 1981), two 
replicate analyses were carried out for each sample analysed. 
Protein content (%), protein yield (%) and protein shift (%) were then 
calculated as described in Section 2.3.2. 
Dietary fibre, ash and starch: - 
Dietary fibre, ash and starch analyses were carried out. in duplicate, 
for cowpea whole flour and pooled samples of fines fractions, using the 
three replicate samplesproduced by air classification at individual separation 
cut sizes in Experiments 9A and 9B. Where overlap between Experiments 9A 
and 9B occurred, only samples from Experiment 9A were used. 
Acid detergent fibre (ADF) values, equivalent to the sum of cellulose, 
lignin and ash, were obtained by the method of Goering and Van Soest (1970). 
Individual lignin and ash values were also obtained by the method of the 
same authors (see Section 2.3.4 for details). kDF, lignin and ash components 
were analysed in whole cowpea flour and fines fractions at classifier speeds 
8.0,7.8,7.5,7.3,7.2,6.9,6.7,6.5,6.4 and 6.2 x 103 rpm. 
Starch was determined in whole cowpea flour and pooled samples of 
fines fractions, at classifier speeds9.7,8.9,8.0,7.2,6.7 and 6.2 X103 rpu by 
the method of Southgate (1969), (Section 2.3.3). 
Hemicellulose was estimated in the above samples, by difference, as 
described in Section 2.3.4. All data were corrected for moisture. 
In addition to these measurements, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) 
(equivalent to total insoluble dietary fibre and ash) values were obtained 
on the same samples analysed for ADF, by the method of Goering and 
Van Soest (1970) (method (a) in Table 42) and Terry and Outen (1973) (method 
(b) in Table 42, see Section 2.3.4 for details). Hemicellulose was calculated 
by subtraction (NDF - ADF). Variability of data was examined statistically 
using the standard error of the difference of two means. For two means 
to be significantly different they must vary by more than SED of 2 means 
x t(5%)n df (df, degrees of freedom). Hemicellulose values were compared 
with the estimated values obtained by difference. 
OliRosaccharides and Sucrose: - 
The same fractions analysed for fibre and starch were investigated 
for oligosaccharide and sucrose content. Pooled samples, however, were 
not used in this case, but the individual replicate fractions. The oligo- 
sac'eharides studied were raffinose, stachyose and verbascose. They were 
extracted from the sample and analysed by the HPLC method of Macrae and 
Zand-Moghaddam (1979) (see Section 2.3.5). 
Sucrose and oligosaccharides were identified from retention time, 
compared with standard solutions, and quantified by peak-height measurement. 
The results (in mg/ml) were then converted to concentration 
A yield recovery was calculated and results were analysed statistically,

reproducibility of the method, using analysis of variance, 95% confidence

4.2 RESULTS 
4.2.1 Particle-Size Analysis of Whole Cow pea Flour and Fines and Coarse 
Fractions of Air-Classified Cow pea Flour. 
4.2.1.1 Light microscop 
Photographs of whole cowpea flour and air-classified fines samples 
are shown in Plates 1 to 6. Whole cowpea flour, viewed under differential 
interference contrast (Plate 1) and polarised light (Plate 2). contained 
a high proportion of very small starch granules, many of which were present 
in agglomerates entwined with cell membrane, as they had not been disrupted 
by milling (Plate 1). Larger particles on Plate l, which do not show up 
under polarised light (Plate 2), may be hull fragments. The majority of 
small starch granules shown in Plates 1 and 2 were spherical in shape. 
The results of starch granule size analysis are shown in Table 36 
and Figure 34 for whole cowpea flour (variety 1) and air-classified fines 
samples. Starch granules were classified into 5 size groups of < 3.5pm, 
3.5 to 5.5 um, 5.5 to 7.0 um, 7.0 to 18 Um and 18 to 33 Um diameter. In 
whole cowpea flour, starch granules were found in each of the size groups 
(see Table 36). The distribution pattern is illustrated in Figure 34(a), 
and shows that there were few large granules in the range 18 to 33 lim 
(7.7%, Table 36), most of the granules being distributed among the other 
size ranges. The small size group,,:  3.5 Um, contained the highest percentage 
Of star'ch granules (30.1%, Table 36). 
Photographs of the fines samples at classifier speeds 8.9,7.2 and 
6.2 x 103 rpmsall carried out at the same magnification as the whole flour, 
are shown in Plates 3 to 6.

that differences in starch-granule size occurred between the three fines 
samples. The finest sample (8.9 X 103rpM, Plate 4) contained a large pro- 
portion of small starch granules, with a considerable amount of yellow/ 
orange stained protein and no large particles of hull%as found in the whole 
flour. The fines sample at 7.2 X 103rpM, also contained a high proportion 
of small starch granules, and a few larger granules (Plate ). In this 
photograph protein is stained less brightly. However, a considerable amount 
of protein is shown to be present (Plate 5) with a few larger fragments 
which may be hull. The fines sample at 6.2 X 103rpM, the largest separation 
cut size studied using light microscopy (Plate 6), contained a larger pro- 
portion of large starch granules in comparison with the other two samples 
and a few large fragments which may originate from the hull, and in this 
respect, was more comparable with Plate 1 for whole cowpea flour. 
The fines sample at 7.2 X 103rpm was also stained with Toluidine blue 
(Plate 3). The blue-stained materials are protein bodies, which are spherical, 
approximately < 5pm in diameter, some being smaller than the 
srallest starch granules and some larger (Plates 3 and 4 The purple-coloured 
material may be hemicellulose. Starch granules are not coloured by this 
stain. 
Photography also revealed that small starch granules tended to be 
spherical, whereas larger granules were often ovoid. (see Plates 4,5 and 
6). Starch granule damage was slight in these 6 photographs, none being 
apparent under polarised light (damaged granules do not show the cross- 
effect). However, one damaged granule is shown in Plate 5. During prepar- 
ation of material for microscop y, it was found that particles tend ed to 
flocculate when water-based stains were added, particularly in the fines 
samples. Hence, agglomeration appears to be greater in the photographs, 
than actually occurred in the dry samples. 
The air-classified fines samples studied were found to have different 
starch-granules size distributions to the whole flour (Table 36 and Figure 
34 b, c and d). No large starch granules (18 to 33 jim) were found in any 
of these samples as shown in Table 36. The fines sample at 8.9 X 103 rpm 
contained 60.3% small starch granules of 
3.5iim (Table 36) and only 2.1% 
granules of 7 to 18 pm. This is illustrated in Figure 34 (b). The fines 
samples at 7.2 X 103 rpm contained an even distribution of starch granules 
at each size range from < 3.5Wm to l8Vm as illustrated in Figure 34(c), 
butaspreviously mentioned, there were no large starch granules of 18 to 
33 jim. The distribution of starch granules in the fines samples at 6.2 
x 10'rpm is illustrated in Figure 34(d). There were more starch granules 
at < 3-5VM (36.1%) and at 7.0 to 18 jim (30.1%), than in any of the other 
size groups (see Table 36), and no large granules of 18 to 33 Pm.

size distribution of material in the fines fraction is distinct from that 
of the whole flour and coarse fraction. The coarse fraction shows consider- 
ably lower quantitiee of smaller particles than does the fines fraction or 
the whole flour, as would be expected, but shows some overlap of particles of 
the same size as those of the fines. 
Particle-size distribution data obtained by Coulter counter for classi- 
fier speeds 10.4,9.7.8.9,8.5,8.0,7.5,7.2,6.7 and 6.4 X 103 rpm are 
shown in Figure 36, for the fines and coarse fractions. Three distinct 
particle-size distributions are shown for the fines fractions and two dist- 
inct distributions are shown for the coarse fractions. 
The estimated calibration curve for whole cowpea, used for calculating 
classifier speed for each separation cut size, is shown in Figure 37, with the 
calibration curve for limestone. These two sets of data have linear 
relationships and appear to be parallel on log/log graph paper. The estimated 
calibration curve for cowpea was based on data provided by Alpine Process 
Technology (see Section 2.2.1.2 for details). 
The measured separation cut size at each classifier speed, calculated 
from data obtained by Coulter counter analysis of matched pairs of fines 
and coarse fractions (see Section 2.2.1.2 and Figure 12 for details of 
calculation), are also shown in Figure 37 and are found to fall between 
the curve for limestone and the estimated curve for cowpea (see Figure 37). 
The measured separation cut size range covered was found to be considerably 
smaller 0-sto 17-bvm) (seeTable 37), than the range of 10 to 26 Jim that 
had been intended to be covered (see Section 2.2.1.2, Table 13) for classi- 
fier speeds 11.6 to 6.2 X 103 rpm. The relationship between the estimated 
and measured separation cut size for cowpea flour is also shown in Figure 38 
on linear graph paper. The curve, for measured separation cut size fell 
below that of the estimated curve.

The estimated curve is of the type y= a(x) , where y. == 
v/d c 
(see Section 2.2.1.2: c, cowpea; dc, density of cowpea; b, slope; K, 
constant). It was therefore possible, using linear regression to carry 
outaStudents' T-test between the slopes (b) of the two calibration curves 
in Figure 37, for limestone (9) and the estimated curve for cowpea (b). 
This showed that the two slopes were not parallel. 
It can be seen in Figure 37, that the measured separation cut sizes for 
cowpea flour (by Coulter counter) are closer to those of the theoretical 
curve for limestone, than to those of the theoretical curve for cowpea. 
It is likely, that the density of the whole cowpeas used in this 
project, was underestimated using liquid paraffin, and was similar 
to that of limestone (2.7 gleco see Figure 37). Hence, the values 
obtained for theoretical separation cut size using a cowpea density 
of 1.204 g/cc (see Section 2.2.1.2. ), were considerably higher 
than those obtained by particle size measurement of the fines arA coarse 
fractions, using the Coulter counter. 
Due to the nature of the equation used for calculation ofthe theoretical 
curve, values of y (separation cut size) increased more rapidly as x (classi- 
fier speed) increased, than did corresponding values obtained from the curve 
for measured separation cut size against classifier speed. Hence the differ- 
ence between the two curves gradually increased as separation cut size 
increased (Figure 38). 
Between classifier speeds 10.4 to 8.5 X103 rpm and 8.0 to 7.2 X103 rpm, 
measured separation cut size showed little change: I-S to 10 Um and 1"Y-Ito 
14.21 jim respectively (see Figure 38). However, between 8.5 and 8.0 X103rpm 
the change in measured separation cut size was sharp: 10 to 11.3 um. 
In addition, at classifier speeds of less than 7.2 xlO3rpm the rate of change 
in separation cut size was also sharp. These data led to the appearance 
of two 'steps' in the relationship (see Figure 38 for details) occurring 
between classifier speeds 8.5 to 8.0 xlO3rpm and classifier speeds less than 
7.2 xlO3rpm, 
4.2.1.3 Comparison of the Air Jet Sieve and Coulter Counter for Particle. 
Size Analysis of Air-Classified Cowpea Fines Fractions. 
The results of particle-size analysis of air-classified cowpea fines 
fractions at classifier speeds 11.6 to 6.2 X 103 rpm, using the air jet 
sieve and Coulter counter, are shown in Table 37 and Figure 39. At 
classifier speeds 8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm, which correspond to separation cut 
sizes 17-6- 13GLim (see Table 37 for details), both sets of data are closely 
related. However, the two sets of data move further apart as classifier 
speed increases beyond 8.0 X 103 rpm (Figure 39). As shown by Coulter 
counter data, separation cut size decreases sharply between 8.0 and 8.5 
X 103 rpm from 1). S to 1.0'. 0, lim (see Table 37 for details). 
The relationship between-, air jet sieve and Coulter counter data, 
between classifier speeds 11.6 and 6.2 X 103 rpm, is also shown in Figure 
40 for pairs of mean data using linear regression. The correlation 
coefficient was calculated initially for data at slow classifier 
speeds (6.2 to 8.0 X 103 rpm) and then progressively recalculated to 
include higher classifier speeds. 
Correlation between data is high from 6.2 to 8.0 X 103 rpm, but 
deteriorates at classifier speeds larger than 8.0 X 103 rpm. In addition 
the variability of results shown-by the standard error of the mean 
(SEM) in Figure 39 was noticeably larger for the air jet sieve than for 
the Coulter counter, over the range of separation cut sizes investigated, 
and in particular at classifier speeds slower than 8.5 to 11.6 X 103 rpm.

4.2.2 Experiment 9: Component Analysis of Fines and Coarse Fractions 
Results of the effect of changing separation cut size of the Alpine 
laboratory zig-zag air classifier 100MZR, on the fractionation of components 
into the fines and coarse fractions of a single batch of whole cowpea 
variety 1 flour, are given in this Section. Seventeen estimated separation 
cut sizes were investigated, ranging from small (classifier speed 11.6 
x 10' rpm) to larger (classifier speed 6.2 x 103 rpm), in two parts, 
Experiment 9A and 9B (see Figure 33 for details of experimental design). 
4.2.2.1 Dry weight yield 
The dry weight yields of the fines and coarse fractions are shown in 
Table 38 and are plotted in Figure 41. In all cases, little dry weight has 
been lost during air classification.

Reproducibility between Experiments 9A and 9B was good (Table 38, SrD of 2 
means 1.58). The dry weight yield of the fines fractions increased as separ- 
ation cut size increased, and ranged from 3.8% at classifier speed 11.6 X103 rpm 
to 37.2% at 6.2 X103 rpm. The increase in dry weight yield of the fines fractions 
was most marked between classifier speeds 6.9 to 6.2 X103 rpm (Figure 41). 
Conversely, the dry weight yield of the coarse fractions decreased as Fepar-

4.2.2.2 Moisture 
The moisture content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was 10.5% (see 
Table 11). As separation cut size increased from classifier speed 11.6 
to 6.2 X103 rpm, the moisture content of the fines increased from 9.7 to 
10.3% (Table 40). However, T-values showed that these differences were 
not significant at the5% level as shown in Table 40, for any value obtained 
in either Experiment 9A or 9B (i. e. T (5%) = 1.53; thus, data must vary 
by more than this value to be significantly different). 
Moisture content of the coarse fractions ranged from 10.5 to 11.2% 
over the range of classifier speeds studied, but no pattern of change in 
moisture content was observed. In all cases, the moisture content of the 
coarse fractions was higher than in the equivalent fines fractions (Table 40).

Moisture fractionation between fines and coarse fractions is shown in Table 39 
from classifier speeds 11.6 to 7.3 X103 rpm, and also in Figure 43. The 
percentage of moisture in the fines fractions increased as separation cut 
size increased (Figure 43), and, conversely, the percentage moisture in the 
coarse fraction decreased. The rate of change of moisture fractionation in the 
coarse fractions changed markedly from classifier speeds 8.0 to 7.8 X103 rpm 
(Figure 43), but was more gradual in the fines fractions.

4.2.2.3 Crude protein 
The crude protein content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was 23.4% 
(mean of 3 replicates). The protein, content of the fines and coarse fractions 
are shown in Table 40. The crude protein content of the fines fractions 
was found to decrease as separation cut size increased from 50.5% at dassifier 
speed 10.4 X103 rpm (measured separation cut sizeISjim) to 29.6% at classifier 
speed 6.2 X 103 rpm (measured separation cut size 11.6jim) (Table 40). The 
pattern of decrease of protein content of the fines fractions is shown in 
Figure 44. Protein content decreased gradually from classifier speed 10.4 
to 6.2 X 103 rpmthe greatest changes occurring between classifier speeds 
8.0 and 6.2 X 103 rpm (Table 40 and Figure 44).

Classifier Speed (X103 rpm) (+ increase in separation cut size) 
The T value (5% significance level) for fines protein contentsfor Experiments 
9A and 9B, was 1.66 (Table 40), thus it can be seen that differences in 
protein content between consecutive classifier speeds are not always sig- 
nificant, such as between classifier speeds*9.7,9.3 and 8.9 X103 rpm 
(48.9,48.8 and 48.1 %, respectively). Reproducibility between Experiments 
9A and 9B was found to be high for protein content of the fines (Figure 44), 
and reproducibility between replicates for each mean was also high (SED 
of 2 means 0.82). 
The protein content of the coarse fractions decreased as classifier 
speed decreased, more slowly and erratically than did the fines 
(Table 40), 
the pattern of change being non-uniform (Figure 44). Thus, significant 
differences (at the 5% level), were not found between, individual classifier 
speedsIbut between groups (Table 40). The highest crude protein value in 
the coarse fraction was 21.7% at classifier speed 11.0 X 103 rpm and the 
lowest was 16.6% at 8.0 X 103 rpm, However, reproducibility of mean data 
was high (SED of 2 me-ons 0.56. Figure 42). 
The relationship between dry weight yield and protein content of the 
fines fractions over the range of classifier speeds studied is shown in 
Figure 45. These data were found to fit a modified logistic curve. i. e. 
yKy (protein content) = 70 -, 
169.931 
+e1+e (2.293 - 0-32t) 
where K is a constant; e, exponential function, and't dry weight yield. 
However, prediction of protein content from dry weight yield should be 
confined to the limits of data given in Figure 45, as this equation 
must be considered empirical. 
Loss of protein (g), incurred during air classification, is shown 
in Table 39 and was found to range from 0.3 to 2.4 %. Dry weight loss and 
protein loss values shown in Table 39 are very simila4 at Lost classifier speeds. 
Protein yield of the fines and coarse fractions is shown in 
Table 38. Protein yield of the fines increased as separation cut size 
became larger, ranging from 13.9% at classifier speed 10.4 X 103 rpm to 
47.0% at classifier speed 6.2 x 103 rpm. Protein yield of the fines fractions 
followed a similar pattern of increase as dry weight yield, from classifier 
speeds 11.6 to 6.2 X 103 rpm (see Figure 41). and was inversely related 
to proteincontent of the fines fractions (Figure 41). Protein yield 
variability between Experiments 9A and 9B was higher than for dry weight 
yield or protein content, and is a reflection of accumulation of experimental 
error from the determination of protein content and dry weight.

Dry Weight Yield (%) 
The protein yield of the coarse fractions decreased as separation cut 
size increased (Table 38) and ranged from 87.5% at classifier speed 11.6 X103 rpm 
to 58.6% at classifier speed 7.5 X103 rpm. For the coarse fractions, protein 
yield, dry weight, yield and protein content all decreased over the range of 
classifier speeds studied (Figure 42). 
Protein Shift The efficiency of separation of protein into the fines can be 
expressed as the protein shiftvwhich is an extremely useful value for comparaUve 
purposes Nose, 1978, see Section 2.3.2 for calculation). Protein shifts ranged 
from 7.0% to 17.1% in air-classified cowpea fines fractions (see Table 38). 
The greatest protein shifts occurred at separation cut size lit-pm (classifier 
speee-, s 8.0 to 7.5 xlO3rpm, Table 37), and form the plateau of the curve for 
protein shift against classifier speed in Figure 46.

The lowest protein shifts were found at separation cut sizes 10 Um and

4.2.2.4 Starch 
The starch content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was found to be 
49.4% (mean of two replicates, see Table 40). The starch content of the 
fines fractions increased as separation cut size increased (Table 40) 
and showed an inverse relationship to protein content of the fines 
(Figure 47). Thus, the fraction with the highest protein content 
(classifier speed 10.4 x 103 rpm, 50.6%) contained one of the lowest 
starch contents (4.2%). The starch content of the fines fractions incr- 
eased in a 'step-like' manner (Figure47), following a similar pattern 
to measured separation cut size derived from Coulter counter data, which 
are also plotted in Figure 47. Starch yield of the fines fractions incr- 
eased as classifier speed decreased (separation cut size increased) from 
0.8% to 13.7% over the range of separation cut sizes analysed, with-a 
sharp increase between classifier speeds 8.9 and 8.0 X 103 rpm (1.1 to 
3.8%) and between 7.2 and 6.7 X 103 rpm (6-3 to 13.7%), as shown in Table 
38. These classifier speed ranges are the same ranges at which sudden 
changes in separation cut size occurred according to Coulter counter anal- 
ysis (Figure 47). Additionally, a similar sudden increase at these class- 
ifier speeds was also found in the fines fractions for dry'weight yield 
and starch content (Figure 41 and 47, respectively).

to cellulose, insoluble lignin and ash),. of which 3.6% was cellulose, 
1.8% lignin and 0.8% ash (Table 41).

The OF content of the fines fractions at classifier speeds 8.0 to 6.2 
x 10' rpm ranged from 5.2 to 6.8%. No significant differences were found 
(at the 5% level) between the fines fractions and the whole flours at any 
of the classifier speeds studied, the data showing considerable variability 
(Table 41). Reproducibility of ADF was poor (SED of 2 means 0.82 , Table 41). 
Cellulose and lignin values ranged from 2.9 to 5.0% and 1.3 to 2.1%, respect- 
ively, in the fines (Table 41). No significant differences were found between 
the lignin content of the fines fractions and the whole flour (at the 5% 
level). Data for cellulose and lignin was variable in the fines, being 
lower than in the whole flour at some classifier speeds, but not at others, 
the data forming no pattern with change of classifier speed. 
The data show that whole cowpea variety 1 flour contained 16.2% 
total dietary fibre, of which 10.0% was hemicellulose and 6.2% ADF (Table 41). 
Thus, hemicellulose is the major fibre component in-cowpea variety 1. 
Data for the air-classified fines fraction at classifier speeds 8.0,7.2 
and 6.7 X 103 rpm show that total dietary fibre'content of the fines is 
considerably higher than in the whole flour (35.4% at classifier, speed 8.0 
X 103 rpm, Table 41). 
It was not feasible to carry out statistical analysis on total fibre 
data (or hemicellulose data)jas they were calculated by difference (Section 
2.3.4), and therefore can only be considered as preliminary observations, 
giving an indication of the fate of dietary fibre during air classification. 
However, total fibre shift data (Table 41), which were calculated in the 
same manner as protein shift (see Section 2.3.2), show-- that total fibre 
fractionates into the fines during air classification, giving similar values 
at the different classifier speeds studied (Table 41). Yield of total fibre 
in the fines fraction is also shown in Figure 48. 
Total dietary fibre values were greatly influenced by hemicellulose 
content (calculated by difference, Section 2.3.4) for both whole flour and 
fines. Hemicellulose contents of the fines fractions were higher than the 
whole flour (30.3% at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm compared to 10.0% 
in the whole flour, Table 41), showing a greater increase (ca. 3-fold) 
than did total dietary fibre (ca. 2-fold). Hemicellulose shift data 
revealed that this fibre component fractionated into the fines at all 
the classifier speeds studied (Table 41). being greatest (42.7%) at class- 
ifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm (measured separation cut size ca. 14-lim, see 
Figure 47).

Whole cowpea variety 1 flour contained 0.8% ash (Table 41). Ash content 
of the fines fractions was not significantly different (at the 5% level) 
from the whole flour at any of the classifier speeds studied, excepting 
6.2 X 103 rpm (1.7% ash, Table 41). Ash content was higher in the fines 
at some classifier speeds but not at others, the data forming a random 
pattern. However, the reproducibility of data was poor (SED of 2 means 
0.37, Table 41). Ash yield data for the fines fractions are shown in Fig- 
ure 48 for comparison with dry weight yield data. This Figure reveals that 
ash yield of the fines increases sharply from classifier speed 7.2 X 103 
rpm to 6.2 X 103 rpm. 
The results of two methods of determining Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF, 
total insoluble dietary fibre, Goering and Van Soest, 1970), are shown in 
Table 42 for whole cowpea flour and fines fractions at classifier speeds 
8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm. The NDF data were determined by Method (a) (Goering 
and Van Soest, 1970, without enzymic degradation of starch) and, Method (b) 
(Terry and 011ten, 1973, with enzymic degradation of starch))details of which 
are given in Section 2.3.4. 
Large differences in NDF values were found between the two NDF methods, 
for all samples (Table 42), Method (a) giving much higher values for NDF 
than Bethod (b) . For Method 
(a) significantly greater quantities of NDF 
were found in the fines fractions than in the whole flour at all classifier 
speeds studied, excepting 8.0 x 103 rpm, at the 5% level. For Method (b) 
no significant differences were found between NDF content of te fines and 
the whole flour, excepting classifier speed 6.4 x 103 rpm (Table 42). In 
addition. wide variability of NDF data are shown by the SED of 2 means 
(Table 42), Method (a) showing more variability than does Method (b). 
Relative to ADF values however, both methods show a higher degree of variability 
(Table 42). 
The high NDF values from Method (a) yielded high hemicellulose values, 
and the low values from Method (b) yielded negative values. For Method (a), 
hemicellulose values were greater than in the whole flour at all classifier 
speeds excepting 8.0 X 103 rpm, and showed variable results forming no 
pattern with change of classifier speed (Table 42).

4.2.2.6 OliRosaccharides 
The results of oligosaccharide analysis of whole cowpea variety 1 
flour and air-classified fractions at classifier speeds 10.4 to 6.2 X 103 rpm 
(separation cut size 7.5 to 17.611m) are shown in Tables 43 and 44 and 
Figure 48. 
Total oligosaccharide content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was 
found to be 7.2% (Table 43) and was composed of 6.0% stachyose, 1.2% 
verbascose and trace quantities of raffinose (Table 43). 
Total oligosaccharide content of the fines fractions ranged from 
5.7% to 8.2% (Table 43), but none were significantly different to the whole 
flour. Variability of mean data for total oligosaccharides in whole cowpea 
variety 1 flour and fines fractions ;s shown to be high by the 95% 
confidence intervals in Table 43. The yield of total oli. -osaccharides in 
the fines fraction is shown in Table 44 at classifier speeds 9.7,8.0, 
7.2,6.7 and 6.2 X 103 rpm, along with dry weight yield of these fractions. 
Oligosaccharide yield was found to increase as classifier speed decreased, 
in a similar manner to dry weight yield (Figure 48 and Table 44), and 
ranged from 8.3% to 42.5%. Data in Table 44 reveals that slight concen- 
tration of total oligosaccharides in the fines occurred at classifier 
speeds 6.2 and 7.2 X 103 rpm, as these are the only fractions in which 
total oligosaccharide yield exceeded dry weight yield. However, poor 
reproducibility of oligosaccharide data means that these results are not 
statistically significant. 
Total oligosaccharide content of the coarse fractions at classifier 
speed 7.2 X 103 rpm was 4.4% (Table 43), which corresponded to a yield of 
47.5% (Table 44), indicating that content of this fraction was reduced 
with respect to the whole flour. Howevera *ld recovery of only 71.5% 
(combined data from fines and coarse fractions) was obtained at class- 
ifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm (separation cut size ca. 14 jim), as shown in 
Table 44. This is most likely due to a high loss of dry weight for this 
sample (Table 40) and to poor reproducibility of the determination of 
oligosaccharides.

The stachyose content of the fines ranged from 4.4 to 6.6% over the 
range of classifier speeds studied, and was found to be significantly 
lower than in the whole flour (at the 5% level) at classifier speeds 10.4 
and 6.7 X 103 rpm, but not at any other classifier speeds (Table 43). 
Verbascose content of the fines ranged from 0.6 to 1.2% and was not 
significantly different from the whole flour (at the 5% level) at any of 
the classifier speeds studied, none of the fractions containing more 
verbascose than the whole-flour (Table 43). 
Raffinose content of the fines ranged from 0.1 to 0.5%, but was only 
significantly higher than the whole flour (at the 5% level) at classifier 
speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. The fines content for all three individual 
oligosaccharides, varied in a random manner (Table 43), forming no pattern 
with classifier speed. For the only coarse fraction analysed (classifier 
speed 7.2 X 103 rpm (Table 43)-

stachyose and verbascose were 
significantly lower than in the whole flour. 
Variability of data (including the coarse fraction and whole flour) 
are shown by the SED of 2 means for each oligosaccharide, in Table 43. 
All SED-of-2 means values were high in comparison with the data, thus-- 
differences observed may be due to lack of precision of the methodology 
employed. 
Sucrose content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was found to be 3.0%, 
and ranged from 1.3 to 3.0% in the fines, over the range of classifier 
speeds studied, being significantly lower in the fines (at the 5% level) 
in all cases excepting 9.7 X 103 rpm (Table 43). Sucrose'content of the 
fines varied in a random manner forming no pattern with changes in class- 
ifier speed. 
Comparison of data A comparison of moisture, dry weight yield and protein 
content of the fines fractions, of selected data from ExperimentS6,7 and 9 are 
shown in Table 45. These data can be compared because they were all carried 
out using the same batch of cowpea flour (Ml, see Table 12), with similar 
conditions for air classification. 
Moisture content of the fines is similar for all Experiments, excepting 
Experiment 6. Data for dry weight yield and protein yield are variable 
between'Experiments, varying from 14.8 to 19.3% and 29.4 to 37.5%7respect- 
ively (Table 45). Of all the data in Table 45, dry weight yield and 
protein yield for Experiment 9A at classifier speed 8.5 X 103 rpm are most 
different from the others. For these data, variability of the replicate 
values is higher than for any of the other results, as judged by the standard 
error of the mean (0.78 and 1.25, respectively, Table 45).

4.3 DISCUSSION 
If a study is to be made of the air classification characteristics 
of a finely-ground material, it is important to have a broad knowledge of 
the size of the particles. There are a mixture of organelles present in 
legumes, as previously discussed in Chapter 1; the major components being 
protein bodies (1 to 5 um; McEwen at al., 1974) and starch granules (10to 
48 um; Table 1). As far as air classification of grain legumes is concerned, 
starch granule-size distirlbution is of prime importance, as the major object- 
ive is to separate protein from starch. Thus, as well as a knowledge of 
overall particle-size distribution, a knowledge of starch granule-size 
distribution will aid understanding of this dry-separation technique, and 
choice of separation cut size. Cowpea flour was chosen for a detailed 
study of the influence of changing separation cut size on fractionation 
of components, in particular protein and starch. 
Cowpea variety 1 whole flour was shown by light, microscopy to contain 
a mixture of particles of different shapes and sizes (Plate 1). The use 
of polarised'light (Plate 2) for identification of undamaged starch 
granules, revealed that some of the large particles present were composed 
of clusters of small starch granules, which had not been disrupted by 
milling. Other particles (Plate 1) are hull-fragments, protein bodies 
and cell wall material from the cotyledons. 
Protein bodies were shown to be present in the fines fractions at 
classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm using toluidine blue stain (Flint and Firth, 
1981; Plate 3). These blue-stained bodies were discrete, spherical and 
ca. 1 to 5 um in diameter, in agreement with observations-made by McEwen 
et al. (1974) for fababean. In addition, the fines at the firestseparation 
cut size (classifier speed 8.9 X 103) were found to contain more protein 
(stained yellow/red by iodine; Plate 4), than the fines at larger separa- 
tion cut sizes (Plates 5 and 6). 
Large irregularly shaped hull fragments of varying sizes > 20 jim 
were found to be present in the whole flour (Plate 1) but were not apparent 
in the fines (Plates 3 to 6), at any of the classifier speeds investigated. 
In addition, a considerable quantity of fibrous-polysaccharide material, 
possibly hemicellulose, was present in the fines at classifier speed 
7.2 x 103 rpm, as shown by using toluidine blue stain (Plate 3). Polysac- 
charide material may account for the flocculation of particles which occurred 
when water-based stain was added to the samples, as it acts as a gelling 
agent. 
The only evidence of starch granule damage was found for one large 
starch granule in Plate 5. Agglomerates of small starch granules (Plates 
1 to 6)., which were observed here and also by Vose (1978), may shield these 
granules from, the-mill surfaces, thus preventing damage. 
The starch granules of whole cowpea flour were present as a mixed 
population of varying sizes, with a number of extremely small granules 
, (< 5 um, Plate 2). All starch granules of less than ca. 15 pm were observed 
to be spherical-shaped (Plates 1 to 6) and larger granules were oval- 
shaped (Plates 1 to 6) in agreement with observations made by Lineback 
and Ke (1975) for fababeans. Small starch granules may be newly formed 
granules, which grow as they mature and become more ovoid in shape in 
some species (Kawamura, '1969). In wheat flour, there is a gradual decr- 
ease in starch granule size from the centre to the periphery of the endo- 
sperm (Sullivan et al., 1960), but whether this occurs for grain legumes 
is not known. 
The starch granules of whole cowpea flour fell into 5 main groups 
(Table 36) of < 3.5 ijm, 3.5 to 5.5 vm, '5.5 to 7.0 Um, 7.0 to 18 Vm and 
18 to 33 Vm, the distribution of which was shown in Figure 34(a). 
Large granules'of 18 to 33 jim accounted for only 7.7% of the total number 
of starch granules present, whereas small granules of < 3.5 Vm accounted 
for 30.1% (Table 36). The sizesof starch granules in grain legumes have 
been reported by several workers, in particular for fababean, with much 
variation in reported sizes (Table 1), but few have looked at cowpea. 
Tolmasquim et al. (1971) reported starch granules of 10 to 40 Vm in whole 
cowpeas, although-the method of measurement was not mentioned, nor the 
number of observations made. In this work starch granules have been 
found to be much smaller than in the work of Tolmasquim et al. (1971) and, 
indeed, smaller than previously reported by any workers, for grain legumes 
in general. 
The starch granules of air-classified cowpea flour fines fractions 
at three classifier speeds: 8.9,7.2 and 6.2 x 103 rpm, corresponding to 
estimated separation cut sizes of 15,21 and 26 jim (Table 38), were found 
to be markedly different (Plates 4,5 and 6, respectively). 
Starch granule size anhlysis confirmed observations made by photo- 
graphy. In contrast to the whole flour, no large granules of 18 to 33 vm 
were found in the fines samples studied (Table 36). Thus, they must be 
excluded from the fines at the 3 classifier speeds studied. The majority 
, of the starch granules present in the fines samples at classifier speed 
8.9 x 10' rpm were < 3.5 lim (60.3%, Table 36) with only 2.1% of granules 
of 7 to'19 jim (Figure 36(b) and Plate 4). Due to the small size of these 
granules, it would not be possible to exclude them from the fines by air 
classification at the separation cut sizes normally used for grain legume 
flours (ca. 15 um). Tyler et al. (1981) found that cowpeas did not air 
classify well, ' as the fines always contained a considerable amount of 
starch. The small starch granules found in this workwould account for 
this finding, if this is applicable to all cowpea varieties. 
The proportion of larger starch granules (7 to 18 Vm) present in 
the fines samples, gradually increased as separation cut size increased, 
as would be expected (Table 36 and Plates 5 and 6), the fines 'at classifier 
speed 6.2 x 103 rpm containing the greatest proportion of granules of 
7 to 18 um (Figure 34(d) and Plate 6). In addition, there was a significant 
decline in the proportion of small starch granules (: S 3.5 i1m) present in 
the fines samples between classifier speed 8.9 and 7.2 X 103 rpm (Table 
36 and Plates 5 and 6). There are no data available in the literature with 
which to compare this work for any air-classified grain legumes. 
Vose (1978) reported that sedimentation of wheat flours in carbon tetra- 
chloride/benzene mixture (density 1.44 g/cc) at 20 
0C demonstrated whether 
or not wheat flours were suitable for fractionation by air classification. 
The higher the quantity of "free starch granules" in the flour, the greater 
the protein shift in-the air-classified flours. (In wheat flours, small 
starch granules are more strongly embedded in protein than the large granules 
and in some species of wheat they are less adherent than in others). 
Particle-size analysis by Coulter counter confirmed observations 
made by light microscopy. The particle-size distribution of cowpea flour 
ranged from ca. 5 to 35 um (Figure 35) and the fines at 7.2 x 103 rpm 
were found to have a finer particle-size distribution (ca. 4 to 20 Vm) due 
to exclusion of larger particles, such as hull fragments and large starch 
granules, during air classification (Figure 35). In addition, the coarse 
fraction at 7.2 X 103 rpm showed a coarser particle-size distribution than 
the whole flour (ca. 11 to 38 vm)jas expected. A region of overlap 
between particle-size distributions of the fines and coarse fractions was 
found to occur between ca. 12 Um and 20 Um (Figure 35). Overlap of 
particles at any given separation cut size is known to occur during air 
classification, i. e. particles greater than the separation cut size entering 
the fines and particles smaller.. entering the coarse fraction, (Lauer and 
Prem, 1978). This is taken into account, in calculating the separation 
cut size (see Figure 12). 
Cumulative particle-size distribution curves of fines and coarse 
fractions, at the range of classifier speeds studied (Figure 36), reve&led 
that there were three distinct groupings of particles in the fines and two 
distinct groupings in the coarse fractions. In the fines, these groupings 
occurred for those samples produced at classifier speeds 10.4 to 8.5 X 103 rpm, 
8.0 to 7.2 X 103 rpm and 6.7 to 6.4 X 103 rpm. In the coarse fractions, 
they occurred for classifier speeds 10.4 to 8.5 x 103 rpm and 8.0 to 6.4 
X 103 rpm (Figure 36). These particle-size groupings may be due to the 
inclusion or exclusion of starch granules of different sizes from the fines 
fractions at different classifier speeds, as was shown by light microscopy 
at classifier speeds 8.9,7.2 and 6.2 X 103 rpm, (Table 36). However, 
other polysaccharides will also affect the particle-size distributions 
of the fractions, depending on the separation cut size used. 
At the onset of this Experiment, a series of estimated separation cut 
sizes for the Alpine Laboratory zig-zag air classifier 100MR, were calc- 
ulated, using the density of whole cowpea (obtained by liquid paraffin 
displacement) and the Alpine calibration curve for limestone (as described 
in Section 2.2.1.2). The estimated separation out size range chosen was 
10 to 26 Vm, as 17 matching pairs of air flow rates and classifier speeds 
(Figure 28). Using the Coulter counter for particle-size analysis of air- 
classified fines and coarse fractions of cowpea flour, for the measurement 
of separation cut size, it was found that a smaller range of separation 
cut sizes had been chosen, ranging from IS to 17.6pm (Table 37 and Figure 
The estimated calibration cukve, for predicting the separation cut size 
of cowpea flour from classifier speed and air flow rate, was derived 
from an e4uation in which particle-size separation is a function of 
classifier speed (Figure 37, Alpine 1979a). The measured separation cut 
size curve (obtained using the Coulter counter) fell below this curve, 
indicating that the cowpea density used was too low., Indications are, 
that cowpea flour density is similar to that of limestone being more 
than twide that obtained using liquid parafin (. r, 2-7 and 1.204 g/cc, respect- 
ively, Figure 37). Cowpea flour is non-homogeneous, hence the density of 
different components willdiFer, and may partly account for the "step-like" 
appearance of measured separation cut size. The apparent density of protein 
bodies of grainlegumes can be most accurately determined using gradient 
ultracentrifugation. However, variation in results still occurs (1-36 to 
1.8 glee for Vicia faba, Mosse and Pernollet, 1983). The density of protein 
bodies of other legume species was found to range from 1.2 to 1.5 g/cc 
(Mosse and Pernollet, 1983). These workers also reported that protein 
bodies are heterogeneous depending on their location within the seed. 
Jones (1960) reported that protein bodies of wheat flour had a density 
of 1.3 g/ce, whereas starch granules had a density of 1.5 glee (a 13% 
difference); however1no mention was made of how Jones determined these 
data. Jones (1960), Vose (1978) afid Fedec (1980) all stated, that differ- 
ences between the density of protein bodies and starch granules of legumes 
and wheat, were too small to effect fractionation during air classification 
and suggested that size and shape of pErticles were most important. 
From classifier speeds 10.4 to 8.5 X 103 rpm, there was little change 
in separation cut size (7.5 to '10. o ,, jim, Figure 38). This is most likely 
to be due to the proportion of starch granules present in the fines 
remaining relatively constant between these classifier speeds. Indeed, 
according to cumulative particle-size distribution curves (Figure 36), 
all fines fractions at classifier speeds 10.4 to 8. _5 X 103 rpm have 
similar particle-size groupings, and light microscopy for 8.9 X 103 rpm 
showed that a large propprtion of the starch granules are less than 
12 Um (Table 36). These observations were confirmed by starch analysis, 
which showed that starch content of the fines remained constant between 
classifier speeds 9.7 and 8.5 X 103 rpm (4.2 to 3.9%, Table 40 and 
Figure 47). 
Between classifier speeds 8.5 and 8.0 X 103 rpm, separation cut 
size increased rapidly (Figure 38) from 10.0 to 13.73 jim. This may be 
due to inclusion in the fines of a group of starch granules of approx- 
imately 12 jim diameter, leading to a change in density of the fines and 
coarse fractions. A sudden change in starch content of the fines was also 
shown to occur between these classifier speeds (3-9 to 9.7%, Table 40 and 
Figure 47) in confirmation of results of particle-size analysis. 
From classifier speeds 8.0 to 7.3 X 103 rpm, separation cut size 
remained constant at approximately 1.4-lim. This was also observed in 
cumulative particle-size distribution curves, where-particle size did not 
change for samples between these classifier speeds. In addition, starch 
content of the fines did not show much change (9.7 to 12.0%, Table 40). 
In support of these observation: 6 light microscopy showed that changes in 
starch granule size distribution, in particular of small (S 3.5 jim) and 
larger(5-5 to 18 Vm) starch granules, do occur at different separation 
cut sizes, for classifier speeds 8.9 and 7.2 x 103 rpm (Table 36 and Fig- 
ure 35). 
Another change in separation cut size occurred at 6.9 x 103 rpm 
(Figure 38). Thisagain, may be due to a change in density of the fines 
and coarse fractions, due to inclusion in the fines fraction of another 
group of starch granules of > 15 Um diameter, as was shown by light 
microscopy between classifier speeds 7.2 and 6.2 X 103 rpm (Plates 5 and 
These observations were confirmed by starch analysis (Table 40), 
which showed that starch content of the fines increased rapidly from 
14.8% to 25.6% between classifier speeds 7.2 and 6.7 X 103 rpm (Figure 47). 
The logarithmic calibration curve for limestone, and the estimated 
curve for whole cowpea were found by linear regression (Figure 37) not 
to be parallel. Thus, estimated separation cut sizes and measured separa- 
tion cut sizes would not have been equal, even if density measurements 
had been precise. The measurement of the density of a non-homogeneous 
material such as cowpea flour, can only be an average density measurement_ 
of components each with a separate density. Thus, use of estimated 
calibration curves for the determination of separation cut size'. can only 
be used as a rough guide for the worker who wishes to use a particular 
separation cut size or range, for any given material other than limestone. 
A comparison of-, the performance of the Coulter counter, and_k1pine 
air jet sieve AlOOLS, using the 15 um microsieve, for particle-size 
analysis of air-classified cowpea flour fines fractim from classifier 
speeds 11.6 to 6.2 xlOrpm (Table 37 and Figure 375. showed that air jet sieve 
performance was closely related to that of the Coulter counter at larger 
separation cut sizes (classifier speeds 8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm)_ (Figure 37), 
but the relationship became less clear at smaller separation cut sizes 
(classifier speeds 11.6 to 8.5 X 103 rpm). For particle-size distribution, 
the air jet sieve gave lower and lessconsistent results than the Coulter 
counter at smaller separation cut sizes. These relationships were also 
shown by correlation coefficients for pairs of data derived from the air 
jet sieve and Coulter counter. Correlation between data was high (r = 0.78) 
from 6.2 to 8.0 x 103 rpm, but deteriorated as r was progressively recal- 
culated to include classifier speeds larger than 8.0 X 103 rpm (Figure 40). 
Plates 3 to 6 showed that, at classifier speed 8.9 X 103 rpm, the fines 
fractions contain a relatively higher proportion of protein, than at slower 
speeds. In grain legumes, protein bodies may'be surrounded by, lipid 
(Lui and Altschul, 1967), which would create stickiness in the fines samples, 
especially where protein concentration is greater, such as at classifier 
speeds 11.6 to 8.5 x 103 rpm (Table 40). Additionally, pectic substances 
and hemicelluloses have been found to concentrate with the fines fraction 
in air-classified legume flour, as shown by Sosulski (1982) and Vose et al. 
(1976), and also indicated by light microscopy here (Plate 3). Protein 
bodies and hemicelluloses1which may have been prevented from sticking 
together by the presence of starch granules, at larger separation cut sizes, 
are likely to be the cause of agglomeration of particles and blinding 
of the sieve mesh, preventing the passage of particles through the mesh 
and producing the effect shown in this Experiment. 
Overall, the air jet sieve was found to be less reproducible than 
the Coulter counter, using the 15 um microsieve for cowpea fines fractions 
at classifier speeds 11.6 to 6.2 X 103 rpm. Thus, the'air jet sieve was 
not used for furth3r particle-size analysis of air-classified legume 
flours (Experiment 10)1, the Coulter counter being used in its place. 
Between classiBer speeds 8.5 and 8.0 X'103 rpm, separation cut size 
changed considerably, from 10 to ca. lt jim (Table 37). This was 
accompanied by sudden change in dry weight yield of the fines (4.5%. 
Table 38). In addition, rate of increase of dry weight yield of the fines, 
again increased rapidly between classiA-. r speeds 6.9 and 6.2 X 103 rpm 
(Table 38), coincidental with a second increase in separation cut size 
(14, %Ito 11.61im). 
In terms of dry weight yield of fractions, air classification was 
found to be highly reproducible over the range of separation cut sizes 
studied and from a practical point of view there was little variability 
between Experiments 9A and 9B (Table 38). This was mainly due to the 
design of the Alpine laboratory zig-zag air classifier, enabling precise 
settings of classifier speed and air flow rate. Other equipment used for 
Eir classification of grain legumes, such as the Alpine 132MP air classifier 
( used by eg. Sosulski and Youngs, 1979), dcRsnot allow for such precise 
settings, as discussed in Section 1.3.2. 
Dry weight yield of the fines fractions was very low at smaller 
separation cut sizes tharr--14 lim. Indeed, at the smallest separation cut 
size (10 um), 95% of the original sample entered the coarse fraction 
(Table 38). Thus,, too much wastage of material occurs at low separation 
cut sizes, for use of these fractions to be justified, -economically. 
During air classification, moisture was found to fractionate to some 
extent between the fines and coarse fractions (Table 39). more moisture 
being associated with the coarse fraction than the fines. It is likely 
that the fines fractions have less moisture, as the particles have a 
greater surface area for water loss than do. the coarser particles. 
However, no one has previously commented on this phenomenoil, although 
PFPS (1974) presented data showing that the fines fractions of dehulled 
air-classified pea flour had less moisture than the coarse fractions 
respectively). (3.6 and 5.3%. 
In contrast to dry weight yield, protein content of the fines fractions 
was found to be greatest at the smallest separation cut sizes studied, such 
as 7-5 pm (50.6% protein, Table 40)jand decreased as separation cut size 
increased. However, this decrease in protein content of the fines was 
gradual, until separation cut size exceeded 14. -jim 
(Figure 44), after which 
it was rapid. Fines fractions with a protein content of 51% and, 51.6% were 
obtained (at a vane setting of 12 on the 132MP air classifier), when-dehulled 
pin-milled cowpeas of 27.2 and 27.6% protein; respectively, were air- 
classified by Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982). These results are similar to 
those obtained in this work at a separation cut size of *7. Sljm. 
Much of the dry weight loss incurred during air classification was 
due to loss of protein (Table 39). Protein bodies were found by light 
microscopy in this Experiment and by McEwen et al. (1974),. to range in size 
from 1 to 5 lim; thus they must have been lost through the fines filter, 
which is situated immediately below the fines collecting chamber (Figure 7). 
The greatest loss amounted to 2-5g, or 2.8% of the total dry weight of the 
sample (Table, 39). 
Where separation'cut size changes were rapid, such as between 
classifier speeds 8.5 and 8.0 x 103 rpm, changes in protein yield of the 
fines and coarse fractions were found to be most marked. An increase in 
protein yield of 8% occurred in the fines and of-10.3% in the coarse 
fraction. between these two classifier speeds (Table 38). Protein yield 
data were obtained from a calculation involving both dry weight yield 
and protein content of that fraction, thus, these values will emphasise 
changes occurring in both the parameters from which they were derived. 
The fractionation of protein into the finescan be expressed as the 
protein shift (Vose, 1978). In this study, protein shift was greatest 
for cowpea variety 1 flour, at a separation cut size of ca. 11+1im (17.1%) 
and was lower at smaller or larger separation cut sizes than this (Figure 46). 
A separation cut size of 1.4 Um was produced at classifier speeds 8.0-to 
7.2 X 103 rpmand air flow rates47.0 to 47.8 m3 /h (see Tables 13 and 37), 
respectively. At this separation cut size, a fines fraction with a rela- 
tively high dry weight yield. as well as protein content, was obtained 
(Tables 38 and 40). 
In comparison with published'data on air classification of other 
grain legumes, protein shifts (7 to 17%), obtained for cowpea variety 1 
flour, were low. However, Reichert (1982) also found that pin-milled 
cowpeas did not air classify well. Dehulled, pin-milled fababean produced 
a protein shift Of 38.4% according to Sosulski (1982) however, no mention 
of separation cut size used,, was given. The same author also obtained a 
protein shift of 30% from dehulled, pin-milled cowpeas. Dehulled, pin- 
milled pintobeans did not air classify well, according to Fedec (1980), 
producing a protein shift of 19.9%. This is a similar protein shift to 
that obtained for wh& cowpea flour in this work. . 
In most cases in the literature, dehulling was carried out prior to 
pin-milling. This increases the protein content of the original flour 
and thus increases the protein content of the fines fractions, however, 
it has little effect on the protein shift, according to the data of 
Sosulski (1982), who obtained a protein shift, of 38.4% from whole fababean 
flour, and also a protein shift of 35.0% from dehulled fababean flour. 
Use of the double pass procedure by many workers increased the 
problem of comparlig this work with the work of others. Elkowitz and 
Sosulski (1982)-also found that the coarse fractions of air-'classified 
cowpea,. after the double pass procedure, contained 10.4% protein, which 
is approximately half that obtained in this study-for cowpeas. Pin- 
milled cowpeas were air-classified by Tyler et al. (1981), who found that 
after the first fractionation,. at vane setting 12, on the 132MP air 
classifier, 15% of the protein of cowpea flour was present in the coarse 
fraction. This protein was thought to be mainly agglomerates of protein 
and starch, which could be dispersed by remilling of the coarse fraction. 
The crude protein content of the coarse fractions of air-classified 
cowpea variety 1 flour were found to be greatest at the finest separation 
cut sizes studied, but changed little (21.7 to 18.0%) between classifier 
speeds 11.6 and 7.2 Xl03 rpm (Table 40 and Figure 44). This is due to 
the small amount of fines material (3.8% at classifier speed-11.6 X 103 rpm, 
Table 38) present at small classifier speeds, and also to the poor protein 
shift values obtained for this grain legume (Figure 46). The crude protein 
content of the coarse fractions of dehulled air dassified cowpeas was found 
to be 9.0% by Sosulski (1982) after a double-pass, which is considerably 
lower than found in this work using the single pass. This illustrates 
that the double-pass technique considerably decreases the protein content 
of the coarse fraction, in comparison with a single pass. 
A comparison of the moisture contents, dry weight yields and protein 
yields of the fines from Experiments 6,7,9A and 9B (Table 45), using 
a-single batch of whole cowpea variety 1 flour, showed that, although 
settings of the air classifier varied slightly between Experiments, data 
compared favourably with the exception of data for classifier speed 
8.5 X 103 rpm in Experiment 9A., Howeverlthese data had the highest 
variability, which may, in part, explain why these differences areso 
noticeable. Overall, the comparison has shown that the Alpine 100MZR air 
classifier is capable of high reproducibility of data, provided flours 
of similar fineness are used for all work. 
Acid detergent fibre (ADF, cellulose, insoluble lignin, and ash) was 
found to be comparable with crude fibre values by Suleiman (1973). For 
example, this worker found that wholemeal wheat flour gave a value of 
2.8% for crude fibre and 3.0% for ADF. Whole cowpea variety 1 flour 
contained 6.2% ADF, which was composed of 3.6% cellulose, 1.8% insoluble 
lignin and 0.8% ash (Table 41). Phillips (1982) found that the ADF content 
of whole. cowpeas was 7.1% (Table 4) and Fedec (1980) found that the crude 
fibre content, of whole great northern whitebeans was 6.5%, in. agreement 
with the results of this study. However FAO (1972) reported that whole 
cowpeas contained only 4.8% crude fibre (Table 4). 
A study of the fractionation of ADF, cellulose and lignin, showed 
that there were no, significant differences between the whole flour and 
fines for any of these crude Ebre components, at any of the , classifier speeds 
studied (Table 41). This implies that crude fibre fractionated evenly 
between the fines and coarse fractions. Values for these components 
varied randomly in the fines. fractions at different classifier speeds, 
forming no pattern, and also varied at each classifier speed. Thus varia- 
bility of data may be the reason why no statistical differences were 
found between OF content of the fines and coarse fractions. 
HoweverIvariability ofADF results in this study may be due to differ- 
ences in the particle-size distribution of the fines fractions at differ- 
ent clasdfier speeds. Suleiman (1973) reported that fineness of the material 
affected OF results, and lower values were reported if the material was 
ground more finely. 
In this study, the hull of cowpea variety 1 was found to comprise 5% 
of the dry weight of the seed (Table 41). The hulls of legumes are known 
to contain mainly crude fibre (Kamath and Belavady, 1980), but also some 
sugars and protein (Chapter 1). As the ADF cont-ent of the whole flour 
was 6.2%, (Table 41)jsome of the crude fibre must originate in the cotyledons. 
Sosulski and Youngs (1979) found that crude fibre fractionated into 
the coarse fractions of whole, air-classified legumes. However, Tyler 
et al. (1981) found that crude fibre concentrated in the fines fraction 
of dehulled cowpeas, with a fibre shift of 22%. Crude fibre was found 
to shift into the fines fractions of great northern whitebeans by Fedec 
(1980), whether or not they were dehulled, in contrast with the work of 
Sosulski and Youngs (1979). However, this fibre shift was greater for de- 
hulled flour (22.0%) than for whole flour (5.5%). In addition, the crude 
fibre content of the fines and coarse fractions of great northern white- 
bean flour were decreased by 37.0% and 70.9%, respectively, when the hull 
was removed. Thus, the hull crude fibre components had fractionated mainly 
into the coarse fraction. The results of the work of Fedec (1980) indicate 
that crude fibre of the cotyledons behaved differently during air classi- 
fication, to the crude fibre of the hulls, entering the fines fractions 
rather than the coarse fractions. PFPS (1974) also observed that crude 
fibre fractionated into the fines fractions of dehulled air-classified 
peas, with a 12.5% fibre shift. Thus9dehulling of grain legumes decreases 
the crude fibre content of the coarse fractions of air-classified legumes, 
but has little effect on the crude fibre content of the fines. In addition, 
although dehulling increases the overall protein content of the flour, it 
has little effect on protein shift, according to the data of Sosulski (1982) 
and Vose et al. (1976) for fababeans. Hull removal increases the cost of the 
air classification process; therefore the decision on. whether or not 
to dehull will be based on the use of the coarse fraction. 
Whole'cowpea variety 1 flour contained 16.2% dietary fibre (hemi- 
cellulose, cellulose and lignin), of which 10% was hemicellulose'(Table 41). 
Hemicellulose'and total dietary fibre data must be considered as preliminary, 
as they are calculated by difference and therefore proper statistical 
treatment cannot be applied. However, the results indicate that hemicellulose 
is the major fibre component of whole cowpeas. Very little data havvbeen 
published on the dietary fibre or hemicellulose content of grain legumes, 
as most workers have analysed for crude fibre. However, the work of 
Kamath and Belavady (1980) shows that hemicellulose is'the major component 
present in pigeonpeas (10.1%), which is in good agreement with the data 
of this study (see Table 4). Dietary fibre'values in this study are, 
however, considerably higher for cowpeas, than those for insoluble'dietary 
fibre (neutral detergent fibre) reported by Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982 
see Table 4). However, these authors used dehulled cowpeas, which will 
have the effect of decreasing the overall dietary fibre content'of the 
seeds. In addition, neutral detergent fibre does not include soluble 
fibre components, which are high in legumes (Kamath and Belavady, 1980). 
Total dietary fibre content of the fines fractions was considerably 
higher than in the whole flour (Table 41) over the range of classifier 
speeds studied, ranging from 30.4 to 36.4% . These data were found to 
correspond to dietary fibre shifts of 22.6 to 25.1%. Thus, the indications 
are,. that total dietary fibre concentrated in the fines fractions of air- 
classified cowpea variety 1 flour. Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982) found that 
the fines and coarse fractionsof dehulled cowpea flour contained 7.8 and 
3.5% insolua dietary fibre (NDF)., respectivelyin comparison with 4.3% in 
the whole flour. Thus, these authors found that insoluble dietary fibre 
concentrated: h the fines fraction of air-classified cowpea, in agreement 
with these observations. 
Hemicellulose content of the fines fractions ranged from 25.1 to'" 
30.3% (Table 41), over the range of classifier speeds studied, being 
considerably higher than in the whole flour. Hemicellulose shifts ranged 
from 38.9 to 42.7%, indicating that this dietary fibre component concentr- 
ated in the fines during air classification, to a greater extent than' did 
the total dietary fibre. In addition, because hemicellulose is the major 
fibre component in whole cowpea flour, it has a large influence on total 
dietary fibre shift. 
Protein shift and hemicellulose shift into the fines. wer'e greatest 
at a separation cut size of 14 vm (Table 41 and Figure 46). Unfortunately, 
lack of material prevented an extension of this study to smaller separation 
cut sizes, in order to establish whether protein and hemicellulose shifts 
are correlated. This needs to be further investigated, using a precise 
empirical method for determining hemicellulose, as discussed later. 
Ash comprised 0.8% of whole cowpea variety 1 flour (Table 41), but 
was not significantly different in the fines fraction at any of the classi- 
fier speeds studied. excepting 6.2 X 103 rpm. This implies, that ash frac- 
tionated evenly between the fines and coarse fractions. The data formed 
a random pattern, and were condstently of high variability for all settings, 
which may, in part, explain why no significant differences were found. 
Ash yield data also indicated that ash fractionated evenly between fines 
and coarse fractions (Figure 48),, as the rate of increase of dry weight yield 
was similar to that of ash yield. 
In contrast to this study, Sullivan et. aL (1960) found that ash com-ionents 
of pin-milled wheat flour fractionated into the fines fractions at small 
separation cut sizes (ca 8 um), as protein sheaths' and cell wall material 
(which are finely-ground),, contain ash. Ash also fractionated into the 
fines at larger separation cut sizes (15-to 30 jim)', due to the entry of 
endosperm and peripheral cells which contain ash. However, little ash 
is associated with starch granules (Sullivan e't'al'., 1960), which'these 
authors found entered the fines fractions between 8 Vm and 1511m, in air- 
classified wheat flour. In addition, Sosulski and Youngs (1979) found 
that ash concentrated in the fines fractions of legume flours, such as 
fababean, during air classification (see Chapter 1). 
In the course of this study, NDF analysis was carried out on the 
whole flour and fines fractions of air-classified cowpea variety 1. 
However, both the method of Goering and Van Soest (1970) without pre- 
enzymic digestion of starchand with pre-enzymic digestion of starch 
(Terry and Outen, 1973)., were found unsuitable (Table 42). Both methods 
gave results well outside published data for dietary fibre for other 
legumes, for both NDF and hemicellulose, with no significant differences 
between the fines fractions and whole flour. The former method gave extremely 
high values., which showed a considerable variability between species, and 
the latter method gave extremely low valuesalso with wide variability 
(Table 42). In the case of the method without pre, -enzymic digestion of 
starch, the high, values obtained.. were due to the high starch contents of 
the fractions, causing problems during filtrationas the starch tends to 
gelatinize during heating, producing a viscous solution, which is difficult 
to filter. 
Several workers have found that, NDF residues from starchy foods are 
contaminated with starch and they havejound it necessary to treat either 
the food, or, the residuewith a starch enzyme to remove residual starch 
(Southgate et al., 1978). However, predigestion of starch by the method 
of Terry and Outen (1973), produced such low NDF values, that negative 
results were obtained for hemicellulose. The low NDF results are likely 
to be due to loss of residue, when the starch digest was transferred for 
NDF digestion, and also, to over-heating during NDF digestion. In addition, 
much of the hemicellulose in legumes is soluble (Kamath and Belavady, 1980), 
and will not be measured by NDF analysis, as this method extracts soluble 
dietary fibre components (Southgate et al., 1978). 
During the practical work and literature searching for, this project, 
it became apparent that a rapid, precise, standard method for routine 
analysis of dietary, fibre and its individual components, is needed. 
Some workers add to the confusion, by misinterpreting their data by using 
incorrect definitions for crude and dietary fibre(Bailey et al. --1978). The 
method of Southgate (1969), which involves sequential breakdown of the 
different dietary fibre components and analysis of the breakdown products, 
was not used for fibre determination in the present work, as time was 
limiting. This method, preferably including the modification of Englyst 
(1981) using gas liquid chromatography (published after the work described 
here was commenced), may prove suitable for determining individual 
dietary fibre components in materials such as legume flour. Nevertheless, 
the methodology will still be time consuming. 
The total oligosaccharide content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was 
9.2%. The major oligosaccharide in this flour was stachyose (6.0%), followed 
by verbascose (1.2%) and trace quantities of raffinose, (Table 43). These 
data compare favourably with the work of Sosulski et al. (1982), who found 
that dehulled cowpeas contained 4.4% stachyose, 0.5% verbascose and 0.4% 
raffinose using gas/liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and also 
with the work of Cristofaro et al. (1973) and Akapunum and Markakis (1979) 
for whole cowpeas (see Table 7). In addition, Onigbinde and Akinyele (1983) 
compared the oligosaccharide (raffinose and stachyose) content of 20 varieties 
of whole cowpeas using paper chromatography, but did not determine verbascose 
as they could not obtain the necessary standard. These results gave an 
average content of raffinose of 2.6% and stachyose of 3.3%. 
Total oligosaccharide content of the fines fractions was not signif- 
icantly different from the whole flour at any of the classifier speeds 
studied, ranging from 5.7% to 8.2% (Table 43), in a random pattern. Oligo- 
saccharide yield of the fines fractions was greater than dry weight yield 
at classifier speeds 7.2 and 6.2 X 103 rpm (Table 44, and Figure 48), which 
indicated that concentration did occur in the fines at these classifier 
speeds. However, results were highly variable; thus these results have 
no significance (Table 43). Oligosaccharides were found to concentrate 
in the fines fractions of dehulled, air-classified cowpeas by Sosulski 
et al. (1982), who found 8.64% total oligosaccharides in the fines fractions 
at an unspecified separation cut size, in comparison with 5.45% in the. 
dehulled flour. However, no other data has been published for air-classified 
cowpeas, 
Although total oligosaccharide content of the fines was not found to 
be significantly different from the whole flour, stachyose was found to 
be significantly lower in the fines at classifier speeds'10.4 and 
6.7 X 103 rpm, and raffinose was found to be significantly higher than in 
the whole flour at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm (Table 43). Verbascose, 
however, remained similar in the fines to the whole flour. It may be. that 
different anatomical parts of the seed contain different amounts of total 
oligosaccharide, but there is no evidence for this in the literature. 
However, Onigbindhe and Akinyele (1983), found that'when the hull of 
cowpeas was removed, the total stachyose and raffinose content of the 
seed was decreased by 29%. Thus, considerable quantities of these oligo- 
saccharides are present in the hull and will therefore fractionate into 
the coarse fraction during Edr dassification. 
A recovery of 71.5% was obtained for total oligosaccharides at a 
separation cut size of ca. 14.1im (classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, Table 
40). The same extraction procedure and analytical methodology were used 
for all analyses, therefore the low recovery may reflect an accumulation 
of experimental error. This is mainly because, in order to calculate 
oligosaccharide yield, not only are measurements of oligosaccharide content 
required for each of the fines and coarse fractions and whole flours, but 
also dry weight yields, which involve measurement of moisture content as 
well as weights of the air-classified samples. However, dry weight losses 
w. ere high at this classifier speed and will therefore have played a part 
in lowering recovery values. In addition, it is most likely that loss 
of oligosaccharide occurred during washing and filtering in the extraction 
pr6cedure, than at any other stage, and may also account for the variability 
observed. Sosulski et al. (1982) also observed a high degree of variability 
of oligosaccharide data, with a 13.4% coefficient of variation for verbas- 
cose, using the extraction procedure of Vose et al. (1976). 
Sucrose content of whole cowpea variety 1 flour was 3%, and was signif- 
icantly lower in the fines at all classifier speeds studied, excepting 9.7 
x 10' rpm (Table 43). This suggests that sucrose fractionated into the 
coarse fraction during air classification. Sosulski et al. (1982) found 
that the sucrose content of the fines of dehulled air-classified cowpea 
flour was similar to the whole flour: 2, '64% flour, 2.78% fines (see, 
Table 11). In contrast, Sahasrabudhe et al. (1981) found that sucrose 
content of the fines of dehulled, air-classified fababeans, was lower 
(1-35%) than the whole flour (2.8%), in agreement with this study. 
However, variation in findings between different workers may be due to 
variability'in methodology and equipment used for analysis, or even inter- 
varietal differences. 
Air-classification characteristics, which are to some extent investi- 
gated in Chapter 5, show that in terms of dry weight yield, protein content 
and protein shift, a separation cut size of ca. 14.1im, is most suitable 
for cowpea variety 1 flour. This separation cut sizewas the point at 
which dry weight yield of the fines was sufficiently high to-be considered 
useful from an industrial point of view (Table 38). Additionally, crude 
protein content of the fines was still high, as illustrated by the protein 
shift (Figure 46). To obtain a separation cut size of IL#-pm, using the 
Alpine laboratory zig-zag air classifier for air classification of whole 
cowpea flour, the classifier speed range 7.2 to 8.0 X 103 rpm must be 
used. - 
CHAPTER 5 
THE EFFECT OF CHANGING SEPARATION CUT SIZE OF THE ALPINE LABORATORY ZIG- 
ZAG AIR CLASSIFIER 100MZR ON FRACTIONATION OF FLOUR, FROM THREE LEGUME 
SPECIES, COWPEA, FABABEAN AND PIGEONPEA. (data includes two varieties of 
each species). 
5.1 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
The aim of this experiment was to establish the effect of air class- 
ification on the fractionation of flours from different legume species and 
varieties. Firstly, the differences in partide-size distribution of the 
legume whole flours were investigated, as differences in this respect 
between species or varieties would be reflected in'flour fractionation 
during air classification. In particular, any differences in starch granule 
size distribution, would affect the efficiency of protein separation by 
air classification. 
Secondly, the behaviour of each legume variety chosen was studied 
over a, range of separation cut sizes of the air classifier. The air- 
classified fines fractions were analysed for particle-size distribution 
and compoEition. Emphasis was placed on-the effect of air classification 
on dry weight yield of the fines fractions and crude protein separation, 
although some attention was also given to distribution of dietary fibre, 
starch and oligosaccharides between the fines and coarse fractions. 
One variety of cowpea and two varieties each of fababean and pigeonpea 
were used in Experiment 10, details of which are given in Table 11. The 
cowpea variety chosen for Experiment 10 was designated cowpea variety 2. 
Data corresponding to thme obtained in Experiment 10. were obtained for 
cowpea variety 1 in Experiment 9 and are included, where appropriate, in 
the results presented in this Section, for comparison with cowpea variety 2. 
Each legume was milled under the same conditions as cowpea variety 1 
in Experiment 9 (see Table 12 for details). The experimental design was 
completely randomised for all observations for each legume variety and is 
shown for fababean variety 1 in Figure 49. The locally-purchased legumes 
(in each case variety 1), for which more, material was available, were each 
air-classified at ten different classifier speeds from 8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm 
(see Figure 49). The legumes obtained from the international institutes 
(in each case variety 2), were air-classified at7 classifier speeds; 
these were 7.5 to 6.4 X 103 rpm for fababean variety 2 and pigeonpea 
variety 2 and 7.3 to 6.2 X 103 rpm, for cowpea variety 2. 
After air classification of each legume, the classifier was dismantled 
and brushed, to remove flour and the wheel was washed and dried. Three 
replicates were carried out for each legume variety, at each classifier 
speed. 
Due to time limitations, particle-size analysis, starch, dietary 
fibre and oligosaccharide analyses were carried out at a single classifier 
speed (7.2 X 103 rpm), in order for comparison between species and varieties 
to be made. Data for cowpea flour in Experiment 9--showed that this class- 
ifier speed corresponded to a separation cut size of l-Ljjm and was chosen, 
after analyses of data from Experiment 9 revealed that this separation cut 
size gave the greatest protein shift for cowpea variety 1. 
From time to time, in the presentation of results of Experiment 10, 
separation cut size is given alongside classifier speed. These data were 
obtained from Coulter counter measurements for cowpea variety 1 flour in 
Experiment 9.

5.1.1 Particle-Size Analysis 
5.1.1.1 Light microscopy 
Photomicrographs were taken, to illustrate the starch-granule size 
distribution of fababean variety 1 and pigeonpea variety 1 whole flours, 
and to aid identification of the components present in the whole flours 
and fines fractions (Plates 7 to 11). For all photographs, the field chosen 
was considered to be representative of the legume sample (see Section 2., 2.2.3). 
Photomicrographs, using differential interference contrast (Nomarski), 
were taken of fababean and pigeonpea variety 1 flours (Plates 7 to 9). 
The same sample fields were also photographed under polarised light 
(Plates 8 and 10). Fababean variety 1 fines fraction at 7.2 X 103 rpm 
was also photographed, mounted in toluidine blue stain (see Section 2.2.2.3) 
to show protein bodies and fibrous components (Plate 11). 
Starch granule size analysisusing the microscopic counting tech- 
niques described in Section 2.2.2.3, was carried out to determine any 
differences in starch granule size distribution between the whole flours 
of each variety of legume studied. In addition, the effect of air class- 
ification on the fractionation of starch granulesitD the fines fractions 
was examined (using the same technique), at a single setting of the air 
classifier (7.2 X 103 rpm), for fababean and pigeonpea variety 1, in order 
to complement Coulter counter measurements and starch analysis. Starch- 
granule-size data for cowpea variety 1 whole flour and fines from Experi- 
merA 9, are included in the results where appropriate, for comparison with 
cowpea variety 2. For the fines samples, pooled-samples were used of 
the three replicates produced during air classification. 
For each sample used for starch granule size analysis, two slides 
were prepared as described in Section 2.2.2.3 and stained with Lugolls 
iodine (see Section 2.2.2.3), as previously described in. Chapter 4 
(Section 4.1 ). 
Starch granule size distributions were illustrated using pye charts. 
In addition, variability of counts at each size range was described using 
the standard deviation. 
5.1.1.2 Coulter counter analysis 
The particle-size distributions of whole flours and fines fractions 
X 103 at classifier speed 7.2 rpm, of cowpea variety 2 and both varieties 
of fababean and pigeonpea, were obtained by Coulter counter Model ZB analysis, 
using the method described in Section 2.2.2.2. For each sample, three 
replicates were analysed individually (these were the three replicates from 
air classification at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, for the fines 
fractions). 
The "raw counts" from the Coulter counter were analysed by cumulative 
weight of particles over a specific size (% oversize), against particle- 
size in micrometers. Mean values for each set of three replicates were - 
obtained at each size level and compared for each species and variety. 
5.1.2 Component Analysis of Whole Flours and Fines Fractions 
The analyses described here were carried out on the whole flours 
of cowpea variety 2, fababean varieties 1 and 2 and pigeonpea varieties 
1 and 2 and on all individual replicate fines fractions from air classif- 
ication, unless otherwise stated (see Figure 49). All data are expressed 
on a dry weight basis. 
Moisture, dry weight yield and crude protein were determined as for 
Experiment 9. Dietary fibre and starch analyses were determined in dupli- 
cate, for all whole flours and pooled samples of fines fractions at classi- 
fier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, in the manner described for cowpea variety 1 
flour in Experiment 9. Whole flours and selected fines fractions were 
analysed for acid detergent fibre (ADF) and ash; for fababean and pigeonpea 
variety 1, at classifier speeds 8.0,7.5,7.2,6.7 and 6.4 x 103 rpm; for 
fababean and pigeonpea variety 2, at classifier speeds 7.5,7.2,6.7 and 
6.4 X 103 rpm, and for cowpea variety 2, at classifier speeds 7.2,6.7 and 
6.4 X 103 rpm, using the method of Goering and Van Soest (1970) as described 
in Section 2.3.4. Hemicellulose was calculated by difference (see Section 
2.3.4) for the whole flours and fines samples at classifier speed 7.2 
X 103 rpm, 
Starch analysis was carried out using the method of Southgate (1969), 
as described in Section 2.3.3, for the whole flours and pooled-samples of 
fines fractions at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. 
Oligosaccharide and sucrose analyses were carried out as described 
in Experiment 9, on all the whole flours and individual replicate fines 
fractions at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm (see Section 2.3.5 for details). 
The variability between mean data for all component analyses was 
examined using the standard error of the difference (SED) of two means, 
or the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical differences between 
mean data, at the 5% level, were obtained by multiplying the T value from 
the Student's t distribution table (with theQPPropriate number of degrees 
of freedom) by the SED of 2 means. These T values are shown in the tables 
for each analyses. 
5.2 RESULTS 
5.2.1 Particle-Size Analysis 
5.2.1.1 Light microscop 
Photomicrographs of whole fababean. variety 1 and whole pigeonpea 
variety 1 aaLr as hown: h Plates 7 to 10. If Plate 7 is compared with Plate 
8 (the same field under polarised light) for fababeans, several of the 
large particles are found to consist of groups of smaller starch granules, 
enmeshed in cell wall material. Other larger particles, not visible under 
polarised light, are likely to be hull fragmeiAs. Starch granules in 
fababean appear to be mainly spherical, with a considdrable variation in 
size. No very small starch granules are apparent. 
For pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour (Plates 9 and 10), some of the 
large particles in Plate 9 were also found to be clusters of small starch 
granules, when the same field was viewed under polarised light. Starch 
granules in pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour ranged from small-spherical 
to large-oval (Plate 10). 
Fababean variety 1 fines, at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, was 
illustrated in Plate 11 stained with toluidine blue (see Section 2.2.2.3). 
Purple-stained material is likely to be non-starch polysaccharide-and was abundant 
in this sample. Bluish-stained material is likely to be protein bodies. 
The clumped appearance of particles in Plate 11 is partly due to the aqueous, 
toluidine blue stain, causing particles to agglomerate. 
The starch granules of both fababean and pigeonpea' variety 1 whole 
flours had a higher proporti on of, larger starch granules than did cowpea 
variety 1 whole flour (Plates 1 and 2), and no very small starch granules.

In whole fababean variety 1 flour, starch granules were found in all 
of these size groups (Table 46), although few were present in the smallest 
size range, 
< 3.5 lim, (3.4%). Figure 50 (a) shows the'starch granules size 
distribution of fababean variety 1 whole flour, the size range. with the 
greatest proportion of starch granules being 11 to 22 Um (34.1%, Table 46). 
Thus, fababean variety 1 whole flour had few small starch granules and 
a large proportion of large granules > 11 tim, in contrast to cowpea 
variety 1 whole flour (Table 36, Experiment 9), which contained only 
7.7% large granules (18 to 33 Um, see Table 36). 
Pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour contained no large starch granules 
of 22.0 to 36.0 Um (Table 46) and a much larger proportion of small (S 3.5 11m) 
starch granules than did fababean varietyl whole flour (Figure 50, (C)). 
Thus, pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour contained a smaller starch granule 
size distribution. than did fababean variety 1 flour (Figure 50 (a) and (c)) 
ani was similar to cowpea variety 1 whole flour (Figure 34 a). 
Cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea variety 2 whole flours were devoid of 
starch'granules between 11 and 22 pm diameter in the'samples studied. In 
fact, cowpea variety, 2 whole flour contained no starch granules larger 
than ll. Um, the granules being evenly distributed between the size ranges 
< 3.5,3.5 to 7.0 um and 7.0 to 11 Um (see Figure 50 e ). The majority of 
the starch granules of fababean variety 2 whole flour ' were between 3.5 
and 11 Um in diameter (see Figure 50 f for details). 
Pigeonpea variety 2 whole flour contained 16.9% starch granules of 
22 to 36 Um diameter (see Table'46 and Figure 50 (g)). The majority of 
starch granulesYhowever, were found to fall between 3.5 and 11 Pm. The 
starch granule size distribution of pigeonpea variety 2 flour was therefore 
larger than for pigeonpe variety 1 flour, which contained no starch 
granules larger than 22 pm (Table 46). 
The results of starch granule size analysis of the fines of fababean 
and pigeonpea variety 1-at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm are shown in 
Table 46 and Figures 50 (b) and (d). Both fines samples contained more

small granules than, their respective whole flours. The fines samples of 
fababean variety 1 flour, air-classified at 7.2 X 103 rpm, contained 
about 4 times more starch granules of < 3.5 Pm than did the whole flour, 
and considerably less starch granules of 22 to 33 11m (see Figure 50 (b) 
for details). 
Pigeonpea variety 1 fines samples at 7.2 X 103 rpm contained about 
twice the number of small starch granules of _< 
3.5 jim diameter than did 
the whole flour'(Table 46), more starch granules of 3.5 to 7.0 jim, but 
less larger granules of 7 to 11 Vm (Figure 50 (d)). 
5.2.1.2 Coulter counter analysis 
The particle-size distributiorE of the whole legume flours and fines 
fractions by Coulter counter, a classifier speed 7.2 x 103 rpm, are shown 
in Figure 51. The coarsest particle-size distributions were shown by 
fababean variety 1 whole flour and pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour; 61% 
and 55% of the particles were greater than 20 Vm for fababean and pigeonpeat 
respectively (Figure 51). The finest whole flour particle-size distribu- 
tions were shown by cowpea varieties 1 and 2; 42% and 44% of the particles 
were greater than 20 pm, respectively (Figure 51). Fababean and pigeonpea 
variety 2, whole flours were found to have intermediate particle-size 
distributions. 
Pigeonpea variety 2 fines fractions, gave the coarsest particle-size 
distribution of the six fines fractions; 78% of the particles were greater 
than 10 Jim (Figure 51). Cowpea variety 2 fines showed the finest 
particle-size distributions overall. There was little difference in 
particle-size distribution between the other fines fractions at small 
particle sizes, with a range of 50 to 62% of particles greater than 10 Jim. 
However, variationin te particle-size distribution at the larger sizes 
(15 to 30 vm)- was greater than at the smaller sizes.

5.2.2 Component Analysis of Whole Flours and Fines Fractions 
Results of the effect of changing separation cut size of the Alpine 
laboratory zig. zag air classifier 100MZR, on the fractionation of compon- 
ents into the fines fractions of 6 legume flurs6 including two varieties 
each of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea (see Tables 11 and 12), are given 
in this Section. Ten separation cut sizes were investigated, ranging 
from small (classifier speed 8.0 X 103 rpm) to larger sizEs(classifier 
speed 6.2 X 103 rpm), as shown in Figure 49. 
5.2.2.1 Dry weiRht yield 
The dry weight yields of the fines fractions for all air-classified 
legumes are shown in Table 47 and Figure 52. The dry weight yield of fines 
decreased as classifier speed decreased from 8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm, for all 
legumes studied (Table 47), but the rate of change of dry weight yield varied 
between the legumes (Figure 52).

5.2.2.2 Moisture 
The moisture contents of the whole milled legume flours and fines 
fractions are given in Table 48. These data show that fababean variety 
1 and 2 whole flours fall at opposite ends of the moisture range of the 
legumes studied (8-5 and 12.9%, respectively, see Table 48). The moisture 
contents of the fines fractions were found to be lower than the whole 
flours, and were s1milar for all the fines fractions studied, although 
cowpea variety 1 exhibited the highest fines moisture contents (9.7 to 
10.3%).

5.2.2.3 Crude protein 
The crude protein content'(N x 6.25) of the whole flours and air- 
classified fractions are shown in Table 49 and ranged from 20.6 to 29.1%. 
The variability of data was greater for both species of fababean, than 
for the two varieties of cowpea and pigeonpea. Overall, both pigeonpea 
varieties had the lowest whole flour protein contents, and both fababean 
varieties the highest protein contents. 
The protein content of the fines fractions are shown in Figures 
53,54 and 55, for cowpea varieties 1 and 2, fababean varieties 1 and 2 
and pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2, respectively. The highest protein 
concentrations were found in fababean variety 1 fines fractions 
(Figure 54), at all classifier speeds studied (56.6 to 62.7% crude protein). 
The lowest protein concentrations were found in cowpea variety 2 fines 
fractions, i. e. 26.5% at 6.2 X 103 rpm (Figure 53). 
Both varieties of cowpea produced similar fines protein contents 
over the range of classifier speeds investigated (Figure 53), despite the 
fact that the two whole flours varied in protein content by 2.9% 
(Table 49). In all cases (Figures 53 to 55). decreases in protein content 
of the fines was more noticeable between classifier speeds 7.2 to 6.2 
x 10' rpm, than at faster classifier speeds than this. 
Fababean variety 1 whole flour contained more protein than fababean 
variety 2 whole flour (Table 49) and also concentrated protein to a greater 
extent than did variety 2 (see Figure 54 for details). Both fababean 
varieties gave higher fines protein contents by air classification 
than either cowpea or pigeonpea. A comparison of the two varieties of 
pigeonpea showed that variety 1 (which contained the highest whole 
flour protein content) fines fractions contained more protein, than did 
pigeonpea variety 2 fines fractions (Figure 55). 
The relationship between protein content of the whole legume flour 
and protein content of the fines at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm is shown 
in Figure 56, for all the legume species studied.

Protein Content of Whole Flour (%) 
For cowpea varieties 1 and 2 (Figure 53), both sets of data for dry weight 
yield and protein content were closely related. Fababean and pigeonpea 
(Figure 54 and 55) data showed greater varietal differences in dry weight 
yield than did cowpea. 
The relationship between dry weight yield and protein content of the 
fines, is also shown in Figures 57 to 59. As protein content increased, 
dry weight yield decreased: ha linear fashion, for each of the legume varie- 
ties studied. Using linear regression, a significant correlation at 
the 5% level (r =-0.92), was shown for all data for cowpea varieties 
1 and 2 (Figure 57). The data for the two fababean varieties did not 
follow the same relationship as the two cowpea varieties, or each other, 
so the data for these two varieties could not be considered together. 
Individually, 
lboth. 1varieties 
of fababean gave straight line relationships 
for protein content against dry weight yield, as shown by the correlation 
coefficients in Figure 58 (r 0.80 and r 0.931respectively). However, 
although the correlation for fababean variety 2 was significant at the 5% 
level the correlation for fababean variety 1 was not (see Figure 58). 
Pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2 showed a significant linear relationship 
between protein content and dry weight yield of fines (r =-O . 97for 
data from both varieties plotted together, Figure 59), as did the two 
varieties of cowpea (Figure 57). 
The protein yields of the fines fractions are shown in Table 50 
and Figure 60, and increased as classifier speed decreased. Fababean 
variety 1 showed the highest protein yields of, all the legumes (86.5% 
at 6.4 X 103 rpm), followed by pigeonpea variety 2 and fababean variety 
2 (Figure 60). The rate of increase of protein yield, relative to dry 
weight yield, is indicative of the efficiency of protein concentration 
of that legume. Variability of data was greater for protein yield 
than for dry weight yield, moisture or crude protein, and is a 
reflection of accumulated experimental error, as these -values also take 
dry weight yield into account (see Section 2.3.1).

Protein shift data are shown in Table 51 and Figure 61 for all legumes 
studied in this project. The greatest protein shifts being observed for 
fababean variety 1 (23.0 to 42.1%) and the lowest for cowpea variety 2 
(0.2 to 14.9%, see Table 51). Pigeonpea varieties gave intermediate 
protein shifts.

Changing the classifier speed affected protein shift into the fines, 
to different extents depending on the legume used, as shown in Figure 61. 
Figure 62, shows the relationship between protein shift into the fines 
at classifier speed 7.2 X-103 rpm and percentage small starch granules 
(< 7 ijm) in the whole flour, for all the legumes studied.

The starch contents of-the whole flours and fines fractions at 
classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm are shown in Table 52. Fababean variety 1 
whole flour contained the highest quantity of starch (52.5%), and pigeonpea 
variety 1 the lowest (31.9%). In all cases, the starch content of the 
fines fractions was markedly reduced in comparison with the whole flour, 
the greatest reduction being found in fababean variety 1 fines, which 
contained 9.9% starch at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. The least red- 
uction was found for cowpea variety 2 (44% whole flour, 22.7% fines frac- 
tion at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, see Table 52).

The relationship between protein shift, starch content and starch granule 
size is shown in Table 53. It can be seen1that where protein shift 
was high, starch content of the fines was low (fewer small starch 
granules < 3.5 jim were present in the flour).

A comparison of the dry weight yields and protein contents of the 
air-classified fines fractions of cowpea and fababean presented in this 
thesis is given, with literature values, in Table 54. In all cases in the 
literature quoted, the legumes were dehulled unless stated otherwise 
and no mention was given of the number of replicates carried out. In 
addition, separation cut size, taken from the literature in Table 54, 
is only an estimation. 
All workers mentioned in Table 54 used the Alpine pin-mill 250CW; 
Fedec (1980) used a Bauer Centrisonic air classifier (model 751); 
Sosulski and Youngs (1979), Reichert (1982) and Tyler et al. (1981) used 
an Alpine 132MP air classifier. 
A high degree of variability was shown between replicates for starch 
analysis, which is shown by the standard error of the mean (SEM, Table 52) 
in particular for pigeonpea (both varieties) and fababean variety 2.

5.2.2.5 Dietary fibre 
The dietary fibre results are shown in Table 55. The data shows 
that the ADF (a measure of crude fibre: - cellulose, lignin and ash) 
content of the whole flour. varied between species and varieties. 
The total fibre content of the whole legume flours studied, ranged 
from 11.6 (fababean variety 1) to 38.6% (pigeonpea variety 1), showing 
considerable variation between species and varieties (Table-55). For all 
the legumes except fababean variety 1 (in which OF was the major fibre 
component), hemicellulose was found to be the major fibre component, as 
shown in Table 55, being highest in pigeonpea variety 1 (28.5%) and 
lowest in fababean variety 1 flour (3.9%). 
The pr oportion of hull present in the whole legumes was found to be 
related to the OF content (r = 0.991) for all six legume flours together 
(Table 55), legumes with a high proportion of hull containing higher 
quantities of ADF and vice versa. Variability of mean data for ADF analyses, 
shown by the SED of 2 means, was high (Table 55). 
The ADF content of the fines fractions of cowpea varieties 1 and 2, 
at dassifier speeds 8.0 to 6.4 x 103 rpm, were not significantly differ- 
ent at the 5% level from their respective whole flours (see T values, 
Table 55). However, for fababean and pigeonpea variety 2 fines fractions, 
the ADF content was significantly reduced 
the 5% level), in comparison 
with the whole flours, and for fababean and pigeonpea variety 1 fines, 
the ADF content was also significantly reduced (at the 5% level), except 
at classifier speed 8.0 X 103 rpm (see T values, Table 55). Of all the 
legumes studied, pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2 fines showed, the most marked 
reduction in ADF content. However, no trend of ADF fractionation was 
observed at different classifier speeds (Figure 63). 
Data for the air-classified fines fractions, at classifier speed 
7.2 X 103 rpm. revealed that fractionation of total dietary fibre into the 
fines varied from variety to variety (Table 55) and was not related to

the original fibre content of the whole flour. The dietary fibre content 
of the. fines fractions i., ras much-higher than the respective whole flours 
for fababean and cowpea variety 1, was fractionally higher for fababean, 
cowpea and pigeonpea variety 2 fines fractions, and was lower for pigeonpea 
variety 1 fines fractions, as shown in Table 55 by the total dietary fibre 
shift values. 
Hemicellulose was found to fractionate into the fines fractions of 
all the legumes studied, during air classification at classifier speed 
7.2 x 103 rpm. It was most markedly concentrated in fababean variety 1 
fines fractions (hemicellulose shift 78%), and in cowpea variety 1 fines 
fractions (hemicellulose shift-42.7%, Table 55). The fractionation of 
hemicellulose into the fines during air classification is illustrated in 
Figure 64, which shows the wide variation in fractionation between species 
and varieties.

The variability of mean data was high for ash (SED of 2 means 0.29 to

Table 55. Pigeonpea variety 2 whole flour contained the lowest ash content 
(0.2'1) and fababean variety 1 whole flour, the greatest ash content (0.9%). 
The ash contents of the fines fractions were not significantly different 
from the respective whole flours, for any of the legumes at the classifier

The total oligosaccharide content of the whole flours ranged from 3.2% 
(fababean variety 1) to 7.2% (cowpea variety 1), as shown in Table 56. 
The major oligosaccharide present in the whole legume flours differed 
from species to species, but not between varieties of the same species 
(see Table 56). 
Total oligosaccharide content of the fines fractions of both varieties 
of fababean and pigeonpea.. was found to'be'sign ific I antly higher than 
in the respective whole flours, by Student's T-test (Table 56). However, 
a T-test showed that total oligosaccharides present in the fines frac- 
tions of both varieties of cowpea. were not significantly different 
from their respective whole flours (Table 56). On the other hand, 
oligosaccharide shift data in Table 56 revealed that all fines fractions 
had a positive oligosaccharide shift. The concentration of ol igosacc- 
harides, from the various whole legume flours, into the fines fractions 
at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, isillustrated in Figure 65. 
The highest stachyose content was found in the fines fractions of 
cowpea variety 2 (8.1%) and the highest verba6cose-content was found 
in the fines fractions of fababean variety 2 (7.0%). Raffinose was in 
low or trace quantities in all the samples (see Figure 66 for details). 
Varietal differences in individual oligosaccharide content were small., 
except between the verbascose contents of fababean variety 1 and 2 
fines (see Table 56 and Figure 66 for detafs). 
The sucrose contents of the whole flours are given in Table 56. 
Sucrose content of the fines fractions at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm 
ranged from 1.6 to 5.9%. With the exception of cowpea variety 1, 
sucrose values in the fines were higher than those for the whole flours.

5.3 DISCUSSION 
The whole legume flours studied in this project, were found to vary 
in. particle size distribution and in starch granule size distribution, 
between species and varieties. This may be due to stage of maturity 
of the legume (Doughty and Walker, 1982), as well as genetic and environ- 
mental effects. Photographs of fababean variety 1 whole flour (Plates 
7 and 8) and pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour (Plates 9 and 10) both 
showed evidence of agglomerates of small starch granules under polarised 
light. This had previously been observed for cowpea variety 1 flour 
(Plates 1 and 2). Thus, during the milling process, some agglomerates 
are only partially disrupted. However, there was little evidence of starch 
granule damage in fababean or pigeonpea flours, which can occur if the 
milling process is too severe. It is important to keep starch damage to 
a minimum, if the flour is to be used for air classification, as damaged 
starch granule-fragments would enter the fines. This may be the reason 
why Tyler et al. (1981), who air-classified fababean flour by the double 
pass technique (described in Figure 5), found that the second fines fraction 
(produced by air classification of remilled coarse fraction), contained 
considerably more starch than the previous fines fractions had (see 
Table 9). 
Cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea variety 1 flours, all contained a 
mixed population of particles of uniform and non-uniform shape. The non- 
uniform-shaped particles, not visible under polarised light, are likely 
to be hull fragments andcell wall material (Plaltw-es 1,7,9). The starch 
granules of these three legumes varied, both in size distribution and 
in shape. Fababean variety 1 whole flour contained few small granules, 
but many large granules, all of which were spherical-shaped (Plate 8). 
Pigeonpea variety 1 flour also contained mainly large granules, with 
a few small, spherical granules. The large granules tended to be 
oval-shaped (Plate 10). It was found previously (Chapter 4), that 
cowpea flour (variety 1) consisted mainly of small, spherical granules, 
with a few larger, oval granules. Jones (1960) showed that the, prop- 
ortion of small starch granules present in different types of wheat, 
varied considerably, whereas there was less variation in the number of 
large granules. 
Starch granules in the whole flours rangedfrom < 3.5um to 36 jm 
diameter, according to light microscopy. Cowpea variety 2 contained the 
greatest proportion of small starch granules of all the legume flours 
studied (Table 46), including cowpea variety 1 (Experiment 9), which 
may explain why flour of the former legume exhibited the finest particle- 
size distribution by Coulter counter analysis (Figure 51). However, 
particle-size measurement by light microscopy is subjective, as size is 
determined visually, thus particle-size measurement by Coulter counter 
and light microscopy, may not be in complete agreement, due to use of differ- 
ent methodologies. There was little difference in starch granule size 
distribution between cowpea varieties 1 and 2. 
Fababean variety 1 flour was found by starch-granule-size analysis- 
to contain the greatest proportion of large starch granules (22 to 26 Vm) 
and the smallest number of small starch granules (S 3.5 pm), of all the 
legume flours studied (Tables 46 and 36). This may account for its coarser 
particle-size distribution by Coulter counter analysis, than any of the 
other flours (Figure 51), although other larger particles, such as hull 
fragments, are also included in Coulter counter results. Fababean variety 2 
flour contained more smaller granules than fababean variety 1, which was 
also shown by its finer particle-size distribution by Coulter counter 
analysis. Thus, fababean exhibited a wide variation in starch granule- 
size distribution between the two varieties studied. 
Pigeonpea variety 1 whole flour contained no large starch granules 
of 22 to 36 um, and a considerable amount of small granules, whereas 
pigeonpea variety 2 whole flour did contain large granules of 22 to 26 um, 
but was devoid of granules of 11 to 22 jim, in the samples studied (Table 46). 
Overall, variation in starch granule size distribution between the two- 
pigeonpea varieties was small, pigeonpea variety 1 and 2 flours, being 
intermediate in starch-granule-size distribution between fababean variety 
1 and cowpea variety 1 and 2 flours, with a similar distribution to 
fababean variety 2 (Tables 46 and 36). Legume flours showing the largest 
and smallest starch-granule-size distribution,, therefore, had the coarsest 
and finest particle-size distributions respectively, overall. That starch 
granules should heavily influence the particle-size distribution is to 
be expected, as starch is the major component of starchy grain legumes 
(see Table 2). 
There was not sufficient time to carry out a complete particle-size 
analysis by Coulter counter, to determine separation cut size for indi- 
vidual settings of the air classifier, for the legume flours studied in 
Experiment 10, so data previously obtained for cowpea variety 1 wem used. 
Thus, in Experiment 10, separation cut sizes of the air classifier, relate 
to particle-size distribution data obtained using matching pairs of 
classifier speed and air flow rate for flour of cowpea variety 1. 
Photographs of fababean variety 1 fines at classifier speed 7.2 x 103rpm, 
using toluidine blue stain, showed the presence of a considerable quant- 
ity of purple-stained, irregularly-shaped, non-starch polysaccharide, and 
discrete, blue-stained protein bodies of <5 Um, as exemplified by Plate 11. 
It is difficult to compare this sample with the same technique used for 
cowpea variety 1 at the same classifier speed (Plate 3), as the staining 
is darker in Plate 11. However, both samples exhibit large quantities 
of purple-stained material and the sizes of the protein bodies are similar 
for both legumes. 
The starch-granule-size distribution of the fines fractions of cowpea 
variety 2 was not studied. However, the whole flour had a slightly finer 
particle-size distribution than did cowpea variety 1 whole flour, and ' 
the particle-size distribution of the fines of cowpea variety Z at classi- 
fier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, by Coultar counter, was finer than that of cowpea 
variety 1 fines at the same classifier speed (Figure 51). Additionally, 
starch analysis showed that the fines of cowpea variety 2 contained more 
starch than the fines of cowpea variety 1, at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm 
(TaUe 52). Thus, it is likely that cowpea variety 2 fines contained more 
small starch granules than cowpea variety 1. 
Starch-granule-size analysis of the fines of fababean and pigeonpea 
variety 1 flours, at'classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, revealed that they 
contained less starch granules of 11 to 36 jim and more starch granules of 
< 3.5 to 11 um. However, in comparison with cowpea variety 1 fines at 
the same classifier speed, fababean variety 1 fines contained considerably 
less small starch granules (Table 46 and 36). Coulter counter particle- 
size analysis of the fines confirmed these observations, as fababean 
variety 1-fines)at 7.2 X 103 rpm, were shown to have a coarser particle-size 
distribution than cowpea variety 1 and 2 fines. In addition, "'starch analysis 
showed that fababean variety 1 fines contained less starch than did 
cowpea variety 1 and 2 fines (Table 52). 
Although the starch granule size distribution of fababean variety 2 
fines was not'investigated, fababean variety 1 and 2 fines both exhibited 
similar particle-size distributions at classifier speed 7.2 x 103 rpm, 
by Coulter counter (Figure 51), and also contained very similar starch 
contents according to starch analysis (Table 52). Thus, it is likely 
that fababean variety 2 fines had a similar starch granule size distri- 
bution to fababean variety 1, showing little intervarietal variation 
of this parameter. 
In comparison with fababean variety 1, pigeonpea variety 1 fines 
contained considerably more small'starch granules. Coulter counter , 
particle size analysis confirmed these'observations, as pigeonpea variety 1 
fines, at 7.2 X 103 rpm, exhibited a finer particle size distribution than 
did fababean variety 1 fines at the same classifier speed (Figure 51), and 
also contained a great deal more starch according to starch analysis 
(Table 52). However, there was little difference between the starch granule 
size distributions of, cowpea and pigeonpea variety 1 fines at 7.2 x 103 rpm. 
The starch granule size distribution of pigeonpea variety 2 fines was not 
investigated, but particle-size analysis by Coulter counter showed that 
the fines of this variety of pigeonpea, at 7.2 X 103 rpm, exhibited a 
coarser partide-size distribution than the fines of pigeonpea variety 1 
at the same classifier speed (Figure 51). ' Thus, indications are, that pigeonpea 
idriety 1 fines contained less small starch granules than did pigeonpea 
variety 2. 
Air classification therefore, had the effect of decreasing the pro- 
portion of large starch granules present in the fines and increasing the 
number of small starch granules present, in comparison with the whole flour. 
The lower percentage of small starch granules present in fababean variety 1 
fines, in comparison with the other legume fines at the same classifier 
speed, is, a reflection of the starch-granule-size distribution of the 
whole flour. 'For fababean flour, the majority of the starch granules 
present' exceeded the separation cut size used and were therefore excluded 
from the fines fractions'during air classification, whereas, for cowpea 
flour, a great number of the starch granules present were small enough to 
enter the fines by air classification at classifier speed 7.2 x 103 rpm. 
Contrary to data obtained for cowpea variety 1 (Experiment 9), which 
showed that cowpea did not air classify well, as the fines always contained 
a considerable'amount of starch, fababean was found to edr classify well, 
the fines containing little'starch in comparison with cowpea. Pigeonpea 
flour fell intermediate to these two legume flours in terms of its suit- 
ability for air classification. Tyler et al. (1981) and Sosulski (1982), 
also observed that fababean-air-classified well (Table 9), with, signific- 
antly less starch present in the fines and a much greater protein'shift 
than cowpea. 'The high proportion of large starch granules found here 
for fababean variety 1, would account for this finding, if applicable 
to all fababean varieties. Thus, variation in starch-granule-size distri- 
butions may be the reason for variation in sixcess of air classification 
for different legumes. No information was available in the literature 
on starch granule size, or air classification characteristics of pigeonpea 
flour. 
Data on starch granule sizes of legumes from the literature, suggests 
that fababean starch granules are large. Naivikul and D'Appelonia (1978b) 
reported that fababean starch granules were large, oblong, 12 to 24 Wm 
in width and 20 to 48 um in length using light microscopy. McEwen et al. 
(1974), using SEM, reported granules of 25 to 40 um, of variable shape. 
Only Lineback and Ke (1975) found, starch granules smaller than 12 pm 
in fababean (Table 1). However, starch granules as small as 3.5 Jim have 
not previously been reported for grain legumes. Thus, the observation 
made by Vose (1978), that grain legume flours shift protein by air 
classification, more sixcessfully than wheat flours, due to the presence 
of more large starch granules and less small ones in legumes, may only 
be valid for certain legume species. 
Particle-size analysis by Coulter counter in this Experiment, showed 
that there was more variation in particle-size distribution amongst the 
whole flours of the six legumes studied, than amongst the fines (Figure 51). 
The wide differences in percentage hull content of the whole seed. may 
partly explain this variation (Table 55), as the hull tends to mill to 
coarse particles Mon et al., 1977), and is exclud4d from the fines during 
air classification. Particle-size analysis of the fines by Coulter counter, 
complemented starch-granule-size analysis, as it showed that the fines with 
the coarsest particle-size distributions were fababean varieties 1 and 2 
and pigeonpea variety 2 (5 to 30 jim, Figure 51), and that cowpea variety 
1 and 2 fines had the finest particle-size distributions. Thus, particle- 
size distributions of grain legume flours are considerably influenced by 
starch-granub-size distribution. 
For all legume flours studied, dry weight yield of the fines-fractions 
increased as classifier speed decreased (separation cut size increased) 
over the range 8.0 to 6.2 x 103 rpm, all the fines fractions showing the 
same rate of increase in dry weight yield (Figure 52). The dry weight 
yields of the fines of the air-classified legumes studied, varied from 
species to species and between varieties, cowpea variety 2 producing 
the greatest fines dry weight yields (44.3% at 6.2 X 103 rpm) and pigeonpea 
variety 1, producing the smallest fines dry weight yield (13.8% at 
8.0 X 103 rpm), for any classifier speed in the range studied (Table 47 
and Figure 52). These data compare favourably with available literature 
(Table 54) for air-classified cowpea and fababean fines. 
Fababean variety I flour contained the greatest protein content 
(29.1%) and pigeonpea variety 2 the lowest (20.6%, Table 49) of all the 
legumes studied. Intervarietal variation in crude protein content of 
cowpea and fababean seeds was reported to range from 22.9 to 34.6% and 
22.9 to 28.5% respectively by Mosse and Pernollet (1983). 
Protein fractionation into the fines fractions was greatest at the 
fastest classifier speeds (smallest separation cut sizes) for all the 
legumes studied (Figures 53 to 55 and Table 49) and gradually decreased 
as classifier speed decreased. However, the separation of protein and 
starch into fines and coarse fractions during air classification, was 
found to vary between species: cowpea varieties 1 and 2 gave values for 
crude protein ranging from 26.5 to 44.3%; fababean varieties 1 and 2 from 
48.6 to 62.7% and pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2 from 32.3 to 46.8%. Vari- 
ation between varieties at similar separation cut sizes, was small for 
cowpeas but more noticeable for fababean and pigeonpea (Figures 53 to 55). 
Tyler et al. (1981). compared the air classification behaviour of 
8 species of legumes, milled under the same conditions and observed that 
protein content of the fines fraction varied between species of legume, 
but not between varieties of each species. 
The-protein content of the fines fractions after air classification 
was, to a certain extent, a reflection of the protein content of the 
whole flour. Thus, for fababean varieties 1 and 2, which had the highest 
original protein content (29.1% and 26.6% respectively), the fines also 
contained the greatest protein contents at any given classifier speed. 
However, some legumes, such as pigeonpea variety 1, which had a low 
original protein content, produced higher protein contents in the fines 
fractions, ' at any given separation cut size, than did legumes such as 
cowpea variety 2', wlich had a higher whole flour protein content 
(Figure 56). 
Thus, in some cases, other factors must also determine the extent of 
protein fractionation. Reichert (1982) found that pea varieties with low 
proteln contents, had higher contents of fibre, lipid and sugars, than did 
pea varieties with higher protein contents. However, although this was 
also observed for fababean variety 1, which had the highest protein 
content and the lowest total fibre content, it was not the case for the 
other legumes. Thus, the inverse relationship'between protein content 
and other components found by Reichert (1982), may only occur within 
particular legume species, such as pea. 
In all cases, protein content of the fines was found to decrease more 
sharply after classifier speed 6.9 to 6.5 X 103 'rpM, (separation CUt Size14-27- 
jim). Thus, classifier speeds 6.9 to 6.5 X 103 rpm, may correspond 
to a critical separation cut size for protein enrichment of all the 
legumes studied in ths Experiment. 
The protein content of the fines fractions was found to be inversely 
related to the dry wO-Ight yield of the fines-fractions for all legumes 
studied (see Figures 57 to 59). This is because other components of legume 
flours, which are excluded from the fines at small separation cut sizes, 
such as starch granules, act as diluents to the protein when they enter 
the fines fractions at increasing separation cut sizes, and increase the 
dry weight yield. ' 
Protein content of the fines and dry weight yield of the fines, were 
found to hold significant linear relationships at the 5% level (Figures 
57 to 59), when the data for each legume variety was examined by linear 
regression. However, 'the equation of the line for protein content against 
dry weight yield, was found to vary between species for cowpea, pigeonpea 
and fababean, (Figure 57 to 59) and between varieties for fababean (Figure 
58). For cowpea and pigeonpea, the data were significantly correlated 
for both varieties of each species together, and gave similar relation- 
ships between species: 
y= 55.1 - 0.56x and y= 55.2 - 0.55x, respectively. However, fababean 
varieties 1 and 2 gave separate relationships, which were different to 
those of cowpea and pigeonpea: 
y= 66.8 - 0.20x 
(variety 1) and y= 88.6 - 1.31x (variety 2). Fababean 
variety 2 showed the steepest linear relationship of all the legumes 
studied and fababean variety 1 the least steep (b =-1.31 and-0.20 respect- 
ively). Thus, protein content of the fines can be predicted from dry 
weight yield of the fines, for the 6 legumes studied here. This type of 
relationship may also hold for other air-classified legumes. However, 
results presented here indicate, that the relationship would have to be 
established independL-ntly for each legume variety, due to variation 
between species, and possibly for specific varieties. 
Reichert (1982) showed that dry weight yield and protein content of 
air-classified pea fractions, was predictable from the percentage protein 
in the flour. This was not found to be the case for cowpea, fababean 
and pigeonpea in this study. However, this worker-made no mention of 
prediction of protein content of fines from dry weight yield. 
Protein yield was found to increase as classifier speed decreased 
(Figure 60))as would be expected from an increase in dry weight yield 
(Figure 52). The protein yield of the two cowpea varieties was similar, 
whereas fababean and pigeonpea protein yields varied more between 
varieties. Tyler et al. (1981) suggested that variation in protein yield 
(protein separation efficiency) between legume species, was due to varia- 
bility of seed hardness, which affected the particle-size distribution 
during milling. If this is the case., then seed hardness may vary more 
between fababean and pigdonpea varieties studied here, than between cowpea 
varieties. Tyler and Panchuk (1982) found that seed hardness effected 
milling effiaiency -a more complete separation of protein and starch 
during air classification, occurred with harder seeds. In addition, seed 
hardness was related to seed moisture content, dryer seeds being harder 
(Tyler and Panchijk, 1982). 
The extent of protein shift varied between cowpea, fababean and 
pigeonpea species and varieties, being lowest for both varieties of 
cowpea (0.2 to 14.3%), and greatest for both varieties of fababean (23 
to 42.1%) at any given classifier speed (Table 51). Fababean variety 1 
fines gave the greatest protein shift value (42.1%) of all the legumes 
studied, at a separation cut size of: 2.15 um, according to data from Experi- 
ment 9). Other'workers have found that fababean produces high protein 
shifts, including Vose (1978) who obtained a 48% protein shift with 
dehulled fababean, at a separation cut size of ca. 15 ijm. 
Protein shift into the fines of air-classified cowpea variety 1 flour 
over a measured cut size range of IS to 27-61im (Experiment 9), showed a 
maximum value at separation cut size 14. ljm (Figure 52). In Experiment 10, 
a narrower range of separation cut sizes was studied (131to 17.6pm accord- 
ing to data for cowpea variety 1 from Experiment 9). Indicationsare 
(Figure 61), that both cowpea varieties had already reached maximum 
protein shift values at the smallest separation cut sizes studied in 
Experiment 10. However, protein shifting in fababem variety 1 and 
pigeonpea variety 1 fines, continued to rise over the range of classifier 
speeds studied, 'thus, a maximum protein shift for these two legumes 
was'not attained. Protein shift in fababean variety 2 and pigeonpea 
variety 2 fines changed little over the separation cut size range studied, 
fababean variety 2 giving lower protein shifts than fababean variety 1 
and pigeonpea variety 2 giving higher protein shifts than pigeonpea variety 1 
(Figure 61). The protein shifting-characteristics of a legume are 
primarily' determined by its starch-granule-size dstribution (Vose, 1978). 
Therefore, legumes with a greater proportion of large granules (e. g. 
fababean variety 1), give higher protein shifts, than those with a greater 
proportion of small granules (e. g. cowpea varieties 1 and 2), as large 
granules will be excluded from the fines at small separation cut sizes 
(Table 53). Thus, there may be a different optimum separation cut size 
for maximum protein shifting for each legume. 
The starch content of the six legumes studied, was found to vary 
considerably, ranging from 41.8 to 52.5% between fababean varieties 
and'31-9 to 41.2% between pigecnpea varieties (Table 52). These data 
compare favourably with the literature for cowpea and fababean. Molina 
et al. (1976) reported that cowpeas contained 44.6% starch. Fababean 
starch content has been reported by several workers and ranged from  
30 - 56.3% 
(Table 2). However, Jambunathan and Singh (1981) reported 
that pigeonpea contained 60.7% starch, which: Lq con dderably higher than data 
reported here. 
At a single separation cut size, the original starch content of 
the whole flour was not found to be related to (a), the starch content of 
the fines (Table 52) or (b), the protein content of the fines (Table 49). 
This'is because it is the starch-granule-size distribution, rather than 
the quantity of starch present in the whole seed, which determines its 
fractionation by air classification. 
Legumes with high protein shifts at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm 
(fababean variety 1,35.8%; fababean variety 2,29.5%, Table 51), contained 
low fines starch contents (14.8 and 22.7% respectively, Table 52) and 
pigeonpea varieties, which gave intermediate protein shifts , contained 
intermediate f ines starch contents (Tables a& 52 1 Thus - starch content 
of the fines is negatively related to protein content of the fines, as would 
be expected. 
The ADF, content of, the whole flours was greatest (13.1%) for pigeonpea 
variety 2, and least for cowpea variety 2(4-4%, Table 55). Fababean 
variety I was the only legume studied in which the major fibre component 
was ADF (Table 55). As would have been expected, the ADF content of 
the seed was higher in legumes wlich had a high percentage of hull (Table 
55), as the hull of grain legumes is composed mainly of crude fibre 
e. g. Kamath and Belavady (1980). 
It is diffucult to compare the work of others on fibre composition 
of grain legumes, due to the variation in methodology for the estimation 
of fibre (see Section 4.3 for discussion, of this aspect). However, 
Phillips (1982) reported that whole cowpeas contained 7.2% ADF, which 
compares favourably with values found here (6.2%, cowpea variety 1). 
Marquardt et al. (1975) and Youngs (1975) found that whole fababeans 
contained 8.8 and 8.5% crude fibre respectively, which compare favourably 
with data-obtained here (7.7 and 10.7% respectively for fababean varieties 
1 and 2). Whole pigeonpea was reported to contain 5% crude fibre by FAO 
(1972) whereas ADF ranged from 10.1 to 13.1% in this study, for pigeonpea 
varieties 1 and 2. Tyler et al. (1981) reported that dehulled cowpea 
and fababean flours contained 1.28 and 1.30% crude fibre respectively. 
These data are considerably lower than ADF values for whole cowpea and 
fababean found here, emphasising that the majority of the crude fibre 
of, the seed is present in the hull. 
The OF content of the fines fractions of the 6 air-classified legumes 
varied between, species and varieties. There was signJflcantly less ADF 
(at the 5% level) present in the fines of both varieties of fababean and 
pigeonpea, than in the respective whole flours, except at classifier speed 
8.0 x 10'. rpm. However there was no trend over the range of classifier 
speeds studied, probably because the separation cut size range studied 
was not wide enough to show this (Table 55 and Figure 63). In contrast, 
the ADF contents of the fines fractions of cowpea varieties 1 and 2 were 
not significantly different from the whole flours, implying that ADF 
fractionated evenlybetween the fines and coarse fractions for this legume 
species. Marquardt et al. (1975) found that the crude fibre WAG, 1970) 
content of the fines fractions of dehialled.. air-classified fababeans was 
much reduced in comparison with the whole flour (1.8 and 8.5% respectively). 
Indeed, the value given by these authors for crude fibre content of the 
fines (1.8%), was much lower than the ADF values for the fines of fababean 
presented here, which varied from 3.7 to 6.7% (Table-55). However, this 
may have been a result of differences in methodology. Suleiman (1973) 
found that ADF analysis of wholemeal wheat flour. gave higher crude fibre 
yields (3.4 to 3.5%) than did AOAC crude fibre methods (1.7 to 2.8%). 
The fractionation of OF away from the fines, may be related to the propor- 
tion of the hull of the whole seed, as-in fababean and pigeonpea (Table 55), 
this fractionation is marked, whereas in cowpea, this fractionation is 
not so marked. Some of the crude fibre of the seed is present in the 
cotyledons and is likely to fractionate with the hemicelluloses, into 
the fines fractions. Thus, Tyler et al. (1981) found that the crude fibre 
content of the fines of dehulled cowpeas was twice that in the flour. 
The whole legume flour with the highest total dietary fibre content was 
pigeonpea (variety 1,38.6%; variety 2.30.6%, Table 55). - Fabebean variety 
1 contained the least dietary fibre (11.6%, Table 55) and cowpea varieties 
1 and 2 intermediate levels (16.2 and 19.8% respectively). 
The dietary fibre composition of the six whole legume flours varied 
in terms of hemicellulose. However, apart from fababean variety 1, which 
only contained 3.9% hemicellulose (Table 55), -hemicellulose was the 
major fibre in all the flours, ranging: from 10% (cowpea variety 1) to 
28.5% (pigeonpea variety 1). 
The dietary fibre contents of whole cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea 
reported in the literature, were summarised in Table 4. Using NDF analysis, 
Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982) reported that dehulled cowpea and fababean 
flour contained 4.28 and 4.30% total insoluble dietary fibre respectively. 
These values are considerably lower than values reported here, as the NDF 
method does not measure soluble dietary fibre. In addition, dehulling 
would make a large difference by lowering NDF values. Whole pigeonpeas 
were found to contain 13.5% dietary fibre by Paul and Southgate (1978), 
using the method of Southgate (1969) which is perhaps, the method yielding 
the most informative data on dietary fibre composition of foods at the 
present time. This dietary fibre value is however, considerably lower 
than whole pigeonpea values reported here (30.6 to 38.6%, Table 55). 
Hemicellulose data reported here were found in general, to be higher 
than in the literature (Table 4). Dehulled fababeans were reported to 
contain 7.2% hemicellulose by White (1966), in comparison with 3.9% and 
15.2% found here (Table 55) and whole pigeonpeas contained 10.3% hemi- 
cellulose (Kamath and Belavady, 1980), in comparison with 17.5% and 28.5% 
reported here (Table 55). The use of different methodologies for dietary 
fibre analysis may have caused part of this variation. However, the esti- 
mation of hemicellulose by difference - the method used here, will have 
led to an accumulation of experimental error, even though each individual 
mean was based on three replicate analyses. Interpretation. of differences 
between data presented here and that given in the literature, is made 
more difficult by the lack of published information on the effect of 
variety on dietary fibre composition of legumes. 
The dietary fibre content of the fines fractions of the 6 air- 
classified legumes was measured at 7.2 X 103 rpm (separation cut size 
15 jim, according to data obtained from Experiment 9). Dietary fibre 
content was markedly higher in the fines fractions than in the whole flours, 
for cowpea variety 1 and fababean variety 1 (Table 55). For cowpea, 
fababean and pigeonpea variety 2, only slight increases were observed in 
the fines, and for pigeonpea variety 1, the fines contained less total 
dietary fibre than the whole flour. As these data were calculated by 
difference, it was not feasible to carry out statistical analysis, however, 
results indicate that total dietary fibre fractionation and total dietary 
fibre content of the fines varied between species and between varieties, 
at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, ranging from 18.3% 
(fababean variety 1) 
to 35.5% (cowpea variety 1, Table 55). 
Calculation of total fibre shift (Table 55), revealed the extent of 
concentration of fibre into the fines for each legume. Fababean and cowpea 
variety 1 flours, contained the lowest dietary fibre content, but showed 
the highest fibre shifts (18.6 and 25.1% respectively, Table 55). Pigeonpea 
variety 1, was the only legume to show a negative dietary fibre shift value. 
Nhere the fibre shift value approached 0%, this indicated that fibre showed 
no fractionation between the fines and coarse fractions. Thus, cowpea 
variety 1 and fababean variety l, are the only two flours which showed 
evidence of a total dietary fibre shift into the fines. 
Hemicellulose was found to be the major component of dietary fibre 
present in the fines fractions, of all the legumes studied, and ranged 
from 13.2% (fababean variety 1) to 30.3% (cowpea variety 1). In all cases, 
excepting pigeonpea variety 1, hemicellulose content of the fines was 
clearly higher than in the whole flours (Table 55 and Figure 64). The 
degree of hemicellulose shift however, varied from legume to legume and 
was not related to the hemicellulose content of the whole flour 
(Table 
55), as fababean variety 1 which had the lowest whole flour hemicellulose 
content, gave the greatest hemicellulose shift (78%) and pigeonpea variety 
1, which had the highest whole flour hemicellulose content, gave the lowest 
hemicellulose shift (0.1%). In addition, the shift of hemicellulose was 
greater than the shift of total dietary fibre for all legumes studied, 
indicating that this component had a significant influence on the total 
dietary fibre shift. 
Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982) found that insoluble dietary fibre (NDF) 
shifted into the fines of dehulled cowpea and fababean flours, being incr- 
eased from 4.3 to 7.8% (81% increase) and from 2.7 to 5.4% (100% increase) 
in the air-classified fines respectively. As these legumes were dehulled, 
it is likely that the majority of the dietary fibre present in the flour 
was hemicellulose. Thus, the increases in hemicellulose content in the 
fines found by Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982), fall within the ranges of 
increase of hemicellulose found for whole cowpea and fababean varieties 
in Experiment 10. 
Reichert (1982) reported that pea flour with low protein content, 
contained greater quantities of other components, such as fibre, lipid 
and starch,. than did pea flours with higher protein contents. This was 
found to be the case for pigeonpea variety 1 (22.1% crude protein) and 
fababean variety 1 (29.1% crude protein), as the former contained the 
most dietary fibre and the latter the least dietary fibre (Table 55). 
No obvious relationship existed for the legume flours, taken as a whole, 
between protein and f ibre shif t. As protdn sIff t has'been f ound t> Im related t) starch 
granule size distribution, this implies that fibre shift is not related 
to starch fractionation, and may be depend%nt on variety as well as 
species. 
The ash contents of the whole flours were all <1% (Table 55). Pub- 
lished data (Table 2) for ash content of whole legumes are much higher 
than this, ranging from 3.2% (FAO, 1972) to 4.1% (Molina et al., 1976) 
for cowpeas; 2.4% (Naivikul and D'Appelonia, 1979b) to 3.6% (FAO, 1972) 
for fababeans; and 3.9%(Jambunathan and Singh, 1981) to 4% (FAO, 1972) 
for pigeonpeas. No significant differences were found between the ash 
contents of thb whole flours and air-classified fines, for any of the 
legumes at any of the classifier speeds studied, (see T values, Table 55). 
Differences may have been apparent, had the reproducibility of the method 
been better, as published data indicated that ash concentrates in the 
fines fractions of air-classified legumes. Marquardt et al. (1975) 
found 6.1% ash in the fines'of dehulled, air-classified fababeans, which 
was double the ash content of the flour. This value for ash content of 
the fines is high, and had differencesof this order been found here, they 
would have shown up in statistical testing, even within the limits of 
reproducibility of the methodology. 
The total oligosaccharide content of whole cowpeas, fababeans and 
pigeonpeas varied between species, but not greatly between varieties 
(Tau-, 
56). Whole fababean variety 1 contained the lowest levels of total oligo- 
saccharide (3.2%) and cowpe a variety 1 the highest levels (7.2%, see Fig- 
ure 65). The major oligosaccharide of both varieties of cowpea was stachyose 
(6.0% and 5.3% for varieties 1 and 2 respectively), whereas the major oligo- 
saccharide of both varieties of fababean and pigeonpea was verbascose 
(2.1 and 3.2% for fababean varieties 1 and 2 respectively; 2.9 and 3.7% 
for pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2 respectively). Raffinose was present in 
trace or small quantities in all three legume species. 
Several workers have analysed grain legumes for oligosaccharides, as 
shown in Table 7. Akapunum and Markakis (1979) found that the total oligo- 
saccharide content of whole cowpeas was 5.5%, the major oligosaccharide 
being stachyose. Cerning et al. (1975), found that whole fababeans 
contained 3.9% total oligosaccharides, and Cristofaro et al. (1973) found 
7.8% total oligosaccharides in whole pigeonpeas. Both these workers found 
that the major oligosaccharide of these two legumes was verbascose. 
Although these authors all used different extraction procedures and methods 
of analysis from that used here, nevertheless results are in close agree- 
ment to those found here. 
The total oligosaccharide content of the fines fractions ranged from 
5.1% (fababean variety 1) to 9.5% (cowpea variety 2), at classifier 
speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. Calculation of oligosaccharide shift data, 
' revealed 
that more oligosaccharide was present in the fines than in the whole flour, 
the highest shifts being for both varieties of fababean (17.1 to 19.5%. 
Table 56, Figure 66). Significant differences between the whole flour and 
fines fractions of fababean and pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2 were found 
(Table 56). However, no significant differences were found between the 
oligosaccharide' content of the whole flour and fines fractions for either 
variety of cowpea, 'even though cowpea variety 2 showed an oligosaccharide 
shift of 10.5% (Table 56). This is undoubtably due to the wide varia- 
bility of data (3 replicates for'each fraction), which was particularly 
high for cowpea variety 2 (SED of 2 means 1.20, Table 56). 
Fababean varieties 1 and 2 contained the lowest initial oligosaccharide 
contents (3.2 and 4.2%, Table 26) but gave the greatest oligosaccharide 
shifts. Conversely, cowpea variety 1 had the highest initial oligosacchar- 
ide content, but gave the lowest oligosaccharide shift (Table 56). Thus, 
the oligosaccharide content of the original flour has no bearing on the 
oligosaccharide content of the fines fractions after air classification, 
at the classifier speed studied in this work. Neither does it appear 
to be related to the original protein content of the flour (Table 49). 
For fababean and pigeonpea varieties, there was a linear relationship 
between oligosaccharide shift and protein shift (Figure 67). Indeed, 
Levitt (1972) has reported that oligosaccharides adhere to the protein 
bodies of leguminous seeds during maturation, in order to prevent denatur- 
ation and thus, to stabilise the protein. However, neither cowpea variety 
followed this relationship. Both cowpea varieties behaved differently to 
fababean and pigeonpea varieties in this study, in several respects. 
Firstly, they showed no significant fractionation of oligosaccharides into 
the fines and no significant reduction of ADF in the fines, as did faba- 
bean and pigeonpea flour. Secondly, they exhibited a smaller starch- 
granule-size distribution than did fababean and pigeonpea varieties and, 
thirdly, they gave lower protein shifts than did fababean or pigeonpea 
varieties. It is likely that the high proportion of small starch granules 
present in this species, interfem with fractionation of other components 
during air classification. 
Data for oligosaccharide fractionation during air classification 
obtained here for fababean, confirm data reported by Sosulski et al. (1982), 
251 1 
published after completion of-the practical work for this thesis. These 
workers investigated the oligosaccharide content of eleven species of 
air-classified legume, including cowpea and fababean, using gas chromatog- 
raphy/mass spectrometry, at a separation cut size of ca. 15 lim (Table 10a). 
The fines fractions were found to contain 40 to 90% more oligosaccharide 
than their respective dehulled pin-milled flours. The total oligosaccharide 
content of the fines fractions of cowpea and fababean flours was 8.6% and 
6.0% respectively, which is close to the results of this study, which 
were _ carried out at a separation cut size of 
11jpm (according to data 
obtained for cowpea variety 1 in Experiment 9). In addition, the coarse 
fractions showed a marked decrease in oligosaccharide content in the work 
of Sosulski et al. (1982), being reduced by 50.6% for coarse fractions of 
cowpea and by 46.9% for coarse fractions of fababean. No data was available 
inthe literature for pigeonpeas. 
The sucrose content of the six whole flours studied here, ranged from 
1.4 to 3.6% (pigeonpea and fababean varietyl respectively, Table 56), with 
variation between varieties. These data compare favourably with published 
data by Sosulski et al. (1982). who reported that dehulled cowpeascontained 
2.6% sucrose, and dehulled fababeans contained 2.0% sucrose (Table 10a). 
The fate of sucrose during air classification was inconsistent, with wide 
variation between varieties as well as species (Table 56). A concentration 
of sucrose occurred in the fines of cowpea, and a reduction in sucrose 
occurred in the fines of fababean. The fate of sucrose was also found to 
be inconsistent, by air classification of cowpea and fababean dehulled 
flours, by Sosulski et al. (1982). 
5.4 FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR AIR CLASSIFICATION OF GRAIN LEGUMES 
The work presented in this study, has indicated various areas of 
further research, necessary for the full understanding and application 
of air classification to the separation of components of grain legume 
flours. Previous workers have found that grain legume flours can be 
sur-essfully fractionated into protein-rich and starch-rich fractions by 
air classification. However, there have been relatively few studies reported, 
on optimisation of conditions of air classification, for the production 
of these fractions. In particular, little attention has been given to 
the size of discrete bodies. such as starch granules, within legume flours, 
or the separation cut size to be used for air classification. Recent 
work indicates that the varied properties of air-classified grain legume 
fractions,. may make them useful for food manufacturing purposes. Other 
characteristics of these fractions may lead to the development of food 
products with special dietetic or nutritional properties. 
5.4.1 The Application of Air Classification to Component Fractionation 
of Legume Flours 
Experiments presented here on the validation of laboratory air, 
classification equipment. for the production of legume fractions, as well 
as those on grain legume component fractionation (also presented here), 
have shown areas in need of further consideration, particularly if air 
classification is to be extended to other grain legumes. 
5.4.1.1 Optimum conditions for air classification 
Cowpea flour of 8 to 9% moisture was found to give a higher dry 
weight yield of fines after air classification, than cowpea flour of higher 
moisture contents, whether the moisture of the seed was altered before 
milling or the moisture of the whole flour was altered after milling. Since 
the completion of the experimental work presented in this thesis, the 
effect of seed moisture on the air classification of dehulled fababeans 
and peas has been reported by Tyler and Panchuk (1982). These workers 
found that dry weight yield of the fines increased and protein content 
of the fines decreased, as seed moisture was reduced from 14.3 to 3.8%. 
In addition, the NDF content of the fines increased as moisture of the 
seed was reduced. In contrast, in the work reported here, increased 
fines dry-weight yields, observed at lower moisture contents of the whole 
seed (8.9%, Experiment 4) and flour, (8.8%, Experiment 5), were coupled 
with an increase in protein content of the fines, not a decrease. Tyler 
and Panchuk attributed their observation to improved milling efficiency 
of legumes of lower moisture contents, which resulted in a better separ- 
ation of protein and starch, with an increased dilution of protein in the 
fines by other material than starch, due to finer grinding. In their 
studies, no measurement of particle-size distribution of flour was attempted, 
neither did they compare dried seeds with dried flours, in which the 
moisture was altered after milling. Work reported here, showed that moisture 
content offLour of the same particle size distribution also affected the 
fines yield. Thus, indications are. that it is the airclassification 
process which is affected by moisture content of the seed or flour and 
not the milling efficiency, as reported by Tyler and Panchuk (1983). 
Furthermore, the results of these workers showed, that there was a certain 
level of moisture (10.5%), below which there was no significant effect 
on dry weight yield or protein content of fines. Further studies may 
show that rather than drying the seed to 8 to 9% moisture, it may be 
possible to maximise the dry weight yield of fines by passing air of 
low moisture content through the air classifier. In addition, it may be 
found that the variability of yields of fractions, from a single setting of 
the air classifier, are reduced, if air classification is carried out 
under constant atmospheric conditions. Before a general procedure can 
be recommended, more data is required for a wide range of legume species 
on the effects of flour moisture on fractionation by air classification. 
5.4.1.2 Relationship between dry weiRht yield and protein content of the 
f in es 
For the three legumes studied, it was found that protein content and 
dry weight yield of fines held significant linear relationships, which 
differed between species and sometimes between varieties. A relationship 
of this nature may be exhibited by other grain legume flours, but each 
would have to be established individually. Vith a knowledge of such a 
relationship the protein content of the fines can be predicted from 
dry weight yield; a measure which could easily be used on an industrial 
scale by unskilled workers. 
5.4.1.3 Choice of separation cut size 
Published work regarding the air classification of grain legumes, 
does not provide rationale for choice of separation cut size. Infact, in 
much of the literature, separation cut size is not reported at all; for 
example, Marquardt et al. (1975) used"a process of air classification" 
and Eriksen (1981), a classifier speed of 13,500 rpm. Similarly, Reichert 
(1981)only mentioned use of a vane setting of 25; Tyler et al. (1981), 
a vane setting of 25 and Reichert (1982), two vane setting combina tions 
of 25 and 15, on the Alpine 132MP air classifier. All of these statements 
are mean ingless to a research worker using a different type of air classi- 
fier. Workers such as lauer and Prem (1978), Vose et al. (1976), Reichert 
and Youngs (1978) and Sosulski et al. (1982), all used a separation cut 
size of 15 pm, but do not mention how they determined this size, or why 
they chose it for air classification. Choice of separation cut size 
will ultimately be dependent on the use of the final product, however, 
in the work presented here, optimum protein shift was found to be a useful 
parameter for choice of separation cut size. This is a combined value of 
dry weight yield and protein fractionation. However, data reported here 
indicate that not all legumes reach maximum protein shift at the same 
separation cut size. Indeed, some of the legumes studied did not attain 
maximum protein shift within the separation cut size range studied ('7-5 to 
17.6pm); optimum separation cut size for cowpea was found to be ltt. Vm, 
whereas for fababean it was > 16 Um. Further investigation is needed to 
establish the optimum separation cut size for protein shifting in a wide 
range of legume species. 
5.4.1.4 The relationship between starch and protein fractionation 
Several authors have indicated that differences in density of particles 
(particularly starch granules and protein bodies) within a legume flour, 
may be a factor involved in air classification. Some authors, such 
as Vose (1978) and Fedee (1980) consider that the effect of these density 
differences are so small., that for practical purposes they can be ignored. 
However, there were indications from this work. that density may be exerting 
an effect. There is little reliable information in the literature on dens- 
ity of components of legumes. -Thus, there is a need for a study of the 
density of isolated protein bodies and starch granules of leguminous 
seeds, in particular. One technique which may be suitable for this purpose 
is ultracentrifugation (Mosse and Pernollet, 1983), although data obtained 
by this method shows considerable variability. 
This study has shown that fababean flour is more suitable for protein 
concentration by air classification than cowpea, with pigeonpea showing 
intermediate characteristics. Other workerspincluding Lauer and Prem (1978) 
and Vose et al. (1976), have remarked on the suitability of fababeans for 
protein concentration by air classification. Reichert (1982) had reported 
that a relationship existed between the amount of protein and starch in 
the whole flours and the protein content of the fines. However, from the 
work reported here, these differences in protein concentration shown by 
the flours of the 3 legume species, may be accounted for by the particle- 
size of the starch granules. Species with a high proportion of smaller 
granules (qg cowpea) give lower protein shiftsthan species with a high 
proportion of large granules (a& fababean). Studies on starch granule size 
distribution, need to be extended to all food legumes of low lipid content, 
as this may be a means of predicting which legumes will give the greatest 
protein shifts during air classification. However, if further work is 
undertaken, it is important that the same methodology should be used for 
all starch granule size measurements, so that results are comparable, as 
highly variable results have previously been shown for starch granule 
sizes of the same species. 
5.4.1.5 The fate of dietary fibre 
In the past, determination of fibre in foods was confined to crude 
fibre (cellulose and lignin), which can be easily measured using standard 
techniques. Nowadays, dietary fibre (cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and 
pectins) has been recognised to be of importance in human nutrition. There 
is evidence. that the physiological effects of the different components of 
dietary fibre may be important. in understanding the relationship between 
the human diet and health (Southgate et al., 1978). Fibre exerts a physio- 
logical effect along the gastrointestinal tract, consequent upon physical 
properties of the fibre. All fibre sources, but particularly cereal fibres, 
have been shown to increase stool weight. Fruit and vegetable gums and 
pectins, relieve dumping syndrome and lower serumelhalesterol and may have 
a place in the treatment of adult onset diabetes (Eastwood, 1981). Investi- 
gations have therefore shown that crude fibre measurements of food have 
only a limited value. However, the measurement of dietary fibre components 
is not straight forward and many difficulties have been encountered. 
Data presented in this thesis and results of others, indicate that 
crude fibre, measured as ADF in t-%e data presented here, shifts into the 
coarse fractions for some whole legume flours (e. g. fababean and pigeonpea), 
but not for others (e. g. cowpea). Other workers have shown that crude 
fibre of whole legumes predominantly enters the coarse fraction (Marquardt 
et al., 1975), but crude fibre of dehulled legumes enters the fines (Tyler 
et al., 1981). As there is little crude fibre in the cotyledons of legum- 
inous seeds, the air-classified flnes will therefore, be relatively free 
of crude fibre, which is of significance, as the aim is to produce a protein 
concentrate. However, a wider range of legumes needs to be studied, at' 
a range of separation cut sizes, before any conclusions on the fate of 
crude fibre during air classification can be made. 
Total dietary fibre data presented in this thesis are of a 
preliminary nature, as they were calculated by difference, but they indic- 
ate that total dietary fibre shifts into the fines for some legumes 
(e. g. 
fababeans and cowpea) but not for others (e. g. pigeonpea). Hemicellulose 
(also calculated by difference) was found to fractionate in the same way 
as total dietary fibre, but to a greater extent. Further investigations 
to establish the fate of dietary fibre components during'air classification 
of grain legumes, are important, for two reasons. Firstly, air classi- 
fication may represent a firststage in isolation of dietary fibre components 
of legumes, which may have use in dietetic diets and secondly, if these 
components enter the fines, 'they will act as diluents to the protein, 
decreasing protein shift. For this purpose, reliable methodology with 
step-wise analysis of components, giving comprehensive information, such 
as the modifications of the Southgate 
(1969) methods (e. g. Englyst, 1981) 
should be used. These methods are time -con sum in g, howeve r, rapid techniques are 
reliable. Additionally, a wide range of legumes should be studied. 
5.4.1.6 The fate of oligosaccharides 
Oligosaccharides have been implicated in the production of flatus 
in the large intestine of man (Calloway, 1966). Indeed, the presence of 
these substances in legumes, has been a reason given for the poor acceptab- 
ility of legumes (Doughty and Walker, 1982) as they are not destroyed by 
cooking or other forms of heat treatment (Calloway, 1966). In this 
work, oligosaccharides were found to significantly concentrate in the air- 
classified fines for fababean and pigeonpea, but not for cowpea. Data 
showing that oligosaccharides of most grain legume flours do enter the 
fines during air classification, have been published by Sosulski et al. (1982). 
However, Fleming and Reichert (1983) recently indicated that oligosaccharides 
of field peas are not partitioned during air classification. Levitt (1972) 
had suggested that oligosaccharides adhere to the protein bodies of legum- 
inous seedsbut'this may not be the case for all legumes. Further invest- 
igations are therefore needed. for a wide range of legume species, to 
determine whether they fall into two groups - those which concentrate oligd- 
saccharides, and those which do not. 
Changing the separation cut size for air classification of cowpea, 
was found here, to have no effect on fractionation of oligosaccharides. 
However, this legume showed no signifIcant fractionation-effect overall. 
Thus, the effect of changing separation cut size on fractionation of 
oligosaccharides needs to be fur_Vier studied, using legumes whch do show 
fractionation of oligosaccharides into the fines, during air classification. 
In the-experimental design of this thesis, sufficient replication ' 
was incorporated into experiments to show statistically significant differ- 
ences in oligosaccharide contents of fractions. However, there was, infact, 
a considerable amount of variability in analytical data. Further studies 
using alternative extraction procedures and methodology (e. g. gas liquid 
chromatography), may reduce this variability. 
5.4.1.7 Other-toxic substances 
Legumes in general contain considerable quantities of toxic components 
such as trypsin inhibitors and haemaglutinins, which are normally detoxi- 
cated, during cooking. In addition fababean contains favism factors, wlich 
are not destroyed on cooking. It is necessary to know the fate of these 
substances during air classification, so that appropriate detoxicating 
steps can be recommended for use with the legume fractions. 
Despite the considerable amount of research effort spent on the study 
of legume trypsin inhibitors, their importance in human nutrition may have 
been overestimated. The major form-of human trypsin (a cationic species) 
was only weakly inhibited by soyabean trypsin inhibitor (Liener, 1979). 
However, it is possible that trypsin inhibitors from other legumes, may 
be more effective in this respect than soya. Favic factors (found only 
in fababean) only effect a certain population of people, who should 
should abstain from eating fababean. Reports in the literature e. g. 
Elkowitz and Sosulski (1982) and Marquardt et al. (1975), indicate that 
trypsin inhibitors, haemaglutinins and favic factors, concentrate in 
the fines of legumes during air classification. Information is needed, 
on the effect of changing separation cut size on fractionation of toxic 
components, for a wide range of legumes. In addition, conditions necessary 
for detoxification of fractions, should be determined. 
5.4.2 The Potential Use of Air-Classified Fractions for Human Foods 
Air-classified grain legume fractions have potential in a wide 
range of human food products, some of which, have already been discussed 
(Section 1.3.4.3). k1though finding a use for the coarse (starch) fraction 
is important, commercial success of air classification is particularly 
dependent on the protein concentrates (fines), offering some potential use 
over and above that offered by soya products, as these are already prod- 
uced cheaply by commercial processes. The use of a new material in food 
manufacturing, depends greatly on its functional properties. 
5.4.2.1 A comparison of protein concentration by wet-processing and 
air-classification methods 
Air-classified legume products could be most umfully compared with 
wet-processed legume products. Wet-processing and air-classification methods 
for production of protein concentrates from legumes have been compared 
by several workers e. g. Collonna et al. (1980). Wet-processing methods 
involve water solubilization of protein and removal of the by-products 
by centrifugation. Wet-processing gives complete recovery of starch in 
the by-product, whereas air-classified protein concentrates still contain 
some starch (Collonna et al., 1980). However, the starchy by-products 
from wet-processing,, may contain more protein than do the air-classified 
starch fractions. Air-classified protein concentrates have been reported 
to contain aconsiderable amount of oligosaccharide (Sosulski et al., 1982), 
whereas wet-protein concentrateg do not, as these substances are almost 
entirely extracted (Sathe and Salunkhe, 1981; Eldijdge et al., 1979). 
Wet-processing methods used for production of protein concentrates 
and isolates from grain legumes, have several disadvantages which do 
not apply to air-classified legume protein concentrates. Waste effluent 
is a particular problem as it must be disposed of. In addition, the 
product and by-products need to be dried, which increases, the cost of 
the process. Wet-processing leads to a loss of nutritional value and 
certain functional properties of the protein, due to denaturation-and 
insolubilisation (Wolf and Cowan, 1975). PFPS(1974) also noted that air- 
classified products will be less prone to microbial attack than wet- 
processed products, as wet concentrates have higher moisture contents. 
With air classification, there is no effluent to dispose ofas the 
separating medium is air, and there are no drying costs. No chemicals 
are needed for the process, consequently there are no chemical changes 
in the proteins and other constituents and no loss of solids of nutrit- 
ional value, which if fractionated into the coarse fraction, will increase 
the value of this fraction. Thus, two products can be obtained from 
air classification of grain legumes; a protein concentrate and a starch 
concentrate (Vose, 1978). Additionally, there is no loss of functional 
properties and the proteins are not denatured. 
There are however, some disadvantages to the air-classification 
process in comparison with wet-processing: It is not possible to obtain 
such high protein contents by air classification, although some legumes, 
such as fababean, have the potential to produce a fines fraction of 70 to 
72% protein (Tyler et al., 1981). 
5.4.2.2 Food product manufacture 
In protein products obtained by wet-processing, the protein is the 
major determinant of the functional properties of the product (Martinez, 1969), 
although polysaccharides present, increase the water-absorption capacity. 
In contrast to air-classified legumes, in which the majority of the diet- 
ary fibre of the seed enters the fines fraction, in wet-processed legumes, 
the majority of the fibre is found to be present in the starchy by-product, 
although hemicellulose and cellulose are partially extracted 
Collonna 
et al., 1980). Thus, as would be expected, the functional properties of 
air-classified and wet-processed protein concentrates are markedly differ- 
ent. PFPS (1974) compared the functional properties of air-classified 
pea protein concentrate and wet-processed soya protein concentrates and 
found that water absorption capacity of the pea protein concentrate was 
little different from the original flour, whereas the soya concentrate 
had a much greater water absorption capacity. In addition, fat absorption 
was increased more in the pea protein concentrate. than in the soya concen- 
trate, in comparison with the original flours. Emulsification properties 
were considerably higher in the pea protein concentrate than in pea flour, 
but showed little change between the soya flour and soya concentrate. 
Apparent viscosity was higher in pea protein concentrate and lower in soya 
concentrate, in comparison with the whole flours. 
The functional properties of wet-processed soya concentrates, exploited 
by food manufacturers, include emulsion formation, emulsion stabilisation 
and fat absorption, in products such as sausages and frankfurters. Other 
functional properties utilised, are water absorption and retention in, for 
example, bread, cakes and macaroni; texture formation, by increasing the 
viscosity of soups and gravies and by gelation in ground meats. Soya 
protein concentrates can also be used in infant foods, although they are 
low in methionine and may need supplementation with this nutrient (Wolf 
and Cowan, 1975). 
A limited amount of research on the functional properties of air- 
classified legume fractions has already been published. Functional 
properties of air-classified fractions are being investigated for pea at 
the Food Research Institute, Norwich. Sosulski and Youngs (1979) found 
that the fines fractions of eight air-classified legumes, which had been 
processed at a separation cut size of 15 vm, using a single pass, gave high 
values for oil absorption, oil emulsification, whippability and foam 
stability, while the coarse (starch) fractions gave high values for water 
absorption, peak and cold viscosities. Considerable differences were shown 
in functional properties of various legume species, some legume fractions, 
such as pea and limabean, gave higher values in tests for functional 
properties, than others, such as fababean and mungbean, which gave higher 
protein shifts. These workers ascribed the variation in functional prop- 
erties amongst legumes, to the ratio of protein to starch and other 
constituents in the original flour. By re-milling and re-air classification 
of the coarse fraction (Figure 5), it may be possible to further separate 
the functional properties of grain legumes, as was investigated by 
Sahasrabudhe et al., (1981). 
No studies have been carried out on the functional properties of 
fractions at different separation cut sizes. With further research, this 
may result in production of tailor-made raw materials of weak, intermediate 
'strong 
functional properties, for use in food manufacturing. For these 
purposes, high protein concentration may not be a prerequisite, meaning 
that emphasis could be placed on legumes which do not exhibit high protein 
shifts (Sosulski and Youngs, 1979). 
The development of new food products from air-classified grain 
legumes will need extensive product development. Recently, considerable 
commercial interest has been shown in the use of extrusion cooking to 
produce a wide range of products, such as textured vegetable protein, 
breakfast cereals, quick cooking noodles and pasta, dried soups or 
gravy bases which can be reconstituted without lumping, snacks, and 
crispbreads (Linko et al., 1981). The types of materials extruded have 
included soyabean flours and protein concentrates, rice, corn and other 
cereals. Extrusion cooking could also be applied to air-classified frac- 
tions, for use in replacement of cereal flours and as supplements to cereals, 
in already existing processes, for protein enrichment of the products. 
In particular, they may be applicable for use in ready-to-eat, puffed, 
breakfast cereals. as a replacement for corn or rice, and in quick cooking 
noodles and pasta, which are convenient and energy efficient products, 
allowing quick preparation. These have already been discussed to a 
certain extent in Section 1.3.4.3. PFPS (1974) have investigated the 
use of air-classified pea protein concentrates as meat extenders and meat 
analogues. 
High fibre crispbreads, crackers and wafers, 6ould also be manufact- 
ured from the coarse fractions of air-dassified legumes. Snacks, similar 
to potato crisps, and other such products, could also be produced from 
the air-classified legume coarse fractions. These have already been given 
some attention by PFPS (1974), who produced a highly expanded snack 
product after extrusion using a 50/50 blend of pea coarse fraction and 
wheat flour. In addition, the coarse fractions also have potential in 
non-food applications, such as adhesives produced by high-temperature, 
low moisture extrusion. 
5.4.2.3 Specific food uses 
a) Legume milks: Although breast feeding is undoubtably the best 
for infant nutrition, artificial milks will always be in demand for mothers 
who cannot breastfeed. Most artifidal milks are modified cows, milk 
and thus, provide excellent nourishment for the majority of growing 
infants. However, some infants develop allergies to these milks. Soya 
milks are now available and have been sur-essfully used to feed infants, 
but as a certain proportion of infants also show allergy to these, 
other alternatives are required. Air-classified legume fines fractions 
could be developed for this purpose. Modifications, such as supplementation 
with methionine, would improve the nutritional characteristics of such 
products. These milks would also be of value for vegetarians and those 
on low-fat diets. 
b) Weaning foods: Infant weaning foods in many developing countries 
are composed only of refined starch staples, such as maize flour (Church, 
1979). Because of the swelling characteristics of starch granules, this 
type of food has a low energy and nutrient density and is bulky (high 
weight, volume and viscosity). An infant weaned onto such food ma y be 
in danger of not obtaining sufficient energy to meet requirements and 
additionally, such a diet tends to be low in protein. The addition of a 
protein-rich source, would not only increase the protein supplied by 
such a diet, but would also increase the amounts of other nutrients (such 
as zinc) which are normally associated with protein in the diet. 
Air-classified legumes could be used for enrichment purposes, but 
costs: hvolved in production of such a product may be prohibitively high. 
In addition, data presented here and in the literature, indicate that it 
would be necessary to remove oligosaccharides present in the fines 
fractions, before combination of the fraction with a staple crop such as 
wheat or maize. 
c) Dietetic foods: In recent years, the importance of dietary fibre 
in thehuman diet has been recognised and much research is being carried 
out in this area. This study has indicated that air classification may 
provide a method of concentrating dietary fibre, in particular hemi- 
cellulose, from grain legumes. This aspect could be of value in clinical 
trials, providing there is no need to remove protein present. Where 
dehulling is carried out prior to milling and air classification, the 
hulls have potential use in the rapidly expanding high-fibre foods 
market, and for ruminant foods (Phillips, 1982). 
A high-legume, high-carbohydrate diet, has recently been found to aid 
diabetic patients by reducing post-prandial blood gluco se levels (Leeds, 
1981). Blood glucose responses to a series of dried legumes, were studied 
by Jenkins et al. (1980b), who found that soyabeans and lentils, reduced 
blood glucose rises most effectively, followed by kidney beans, cowpeas 
and haricot beans. Leeds (1981) suggested that this effect was due to the 
slow digestion and absorption of carbohydrate from legume meals. However, 
side effects such as flatus and early satiety, limit widespread use of 
such a diet at present (Leeds, 1981), until a suitable method of reducing 
flatus can be devised. The work reported in this project and in published 
data, indicate that the carbohydrate from most whole legumes, excluding 
hemicellulose and a small amount of crude fibre, enters the coarse fraction 
during air classification. Additionally, oligosaccharides shift into 
the fines during air classification (Sosulski et al., 1982), thus, the 
coarse fractions contain reduced levels of oligosaccharide. Air classif- 
ication of grain legumes would provide a simple method of removing the 
bulk of the oligosaccharide from legume flours. This is an important 
finding and provides a promising area for future research and the potential 
-for using the low-protein, high-carbohydrate fraction for dietetic 
purposes. 
Grain legumes have been implicated in lowering raised serum cholest- 
erol levels in man and animals (Carroll, 1978), although nct all species 
to the same extent (Finnigan, 1983). The factors responsible for lowering 
cholesterol level, may be concentrated in one of the fractions produced 
by air classification of grain legumes, thus leading to the possibililty 
of developing a dietetic food for this purpose. Nutritional factors are 
an integral part of both preventative and therapeutic medicine. It is 
necessary thereforeto build-upon current knowledge of the effect of 
dietary legumes on hypercholesterolaemia. Further research should be 
carried outon the effects cn serum cholesterol levels, of legume fractions, 
as the process provides a simple, rapid technique, for separating components 
of grain legumes., without affecting their physical or chemical properties. 
CHAPTER 6 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
The aim of this work was to determine the potential of air , 
classification of grain legumes for the production of protein concen- 
trates for human food products. A survey of published data on the air 
classification of grain'legumes, showed that no detailed study of the 
effect of separation cut size on the separation of legume flour compo- 
nents during air classification had been carried out, although some 
attention had been given to wheat flour in this respect. Several authors 
had studied the effect of fractionation of components at a single separa- 
tion cut size, giving no rationale for thdr choice of separation cut size. 
The work presented in this thesis fell into three sections: 
a) validation of equipment used for particle-size analysis, milling and 
air classification (Chapter 3); b) A detailed study of the effect of' 
changing separation cut size, on the fractionation of a single batch of 
whole cowpea flour (Chapter 4), and c) a comparison of the effect of 
changing separation cut size, on fractionation of flour from 3 legume 
species, namely cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea, (data included 2 varieties 
of each species) (Chapter 5). ' 
6.1 VALIDATION'OF EQUIPMENT 
In order to facilitate interpretation of data on air classification 
of grain legumes, and to allow work to be repeated by others, it was 
necessary to study the effect of various parameters, on the behaviour of 
legume flour'subjected to the Alpine A20OLS air jet sieve for particle- 
size analysis, the Alpine 10OLU universal mill and the Alpine 100MZR laborat- 
ory air-classifier. The experiments were designed statistically, with 
sufficient replication to allow appropriate statistical analyses, including 
analysis of variance and Students' T test. 
1. The effect of alumina, as an anti-sticking agent. was investigated 
(Experiment 1), for use with the air'jet sieve using a single batch of 
whole cowpea flour. It was found, that alumina did not aid the passage of whole 
cowpea flour through the 15 and 32 Wm air jet sieves. 
2. The effect of whole cowpea flour moisture on particle-size analysis, 
using the 15 to 63 jim air jet sieves, was investiqe. teri in, Experiment 2. 
Moistening the flour to 15%, considerably reduced its passage through 
the 15 to 63 Lim air jet sieves, whilst drying it to 7% moisture, increased 
the passage of flour through these sleves. The use of the Alpine A20OLS 
air jet sieve for particle-size analysis of whole cowpea flour, showed 
that a 15 Um microsieve gave poorer reproducibility than did the larger 
32 to 63 Um sieves. 
3. The effect of mill-running time of the Alpine 10OLU universal mill, 
and feed rate of a single batch of whole cowpeas into the mill, on moist- 
ure content and particle-size distribution of flours produced, was invest- 
igated in Experiment 3. Running time did not affect the moisture content, 
or the particle-size distribution of the whole flour)as determined by the 
air jet sieve. However, a feed rate of approximately 8.5 kg/h produced 
a finer flour than either 6.5 or 18.0 kg/h, as determined by particle- 
size analysis using the air jet sieve. 
4. The effect of moisture content of whole cowpeas on milling efficiency, 
using the Alpine 10OLU universal mill, was investigated in Experiment 4. 
A sample of whole cowpeas (11.3% moisture) from a single batch (Ml), was 
dried to 8.9% moisture and another sample was moistened to 13.0% moisture, 
and milled through the mill at a constant feed rate. No differences were 
found in particle size distribution of the three flours determined by 
Coulter counter analysis. 
5. Fractionation of a single batch (Ml) of whole cowpea flour was 
investigated, using the Alpine zig-zag laboratory air classifier 100MZR, 
in Experiment 5. Three samples of a single batch of cowpea flour (10.6% 
moisture) were studied, one was dried (8.8% moisture), one moistened 
(15.5% moisture), and one left untreated (10.6% moisture). These were 
air-classified at a single setting of the air classifier. Moisture content 
of the flour was found to affect fractionation, as the dry weight yield 
and protein yield of the fines fractions were significantly increased 
for the dried flour, and significantly decreased for the moiRtened flour, 
in comparison with the untreated flour. 
6. A comparison of Experiments 4 and 5, revealed that whether the moisture 
content of whole cowpeas was altered before or after milling, the drier 
flour produced significantly greater dry weight, yields of fines, than did 
moistened or untreated flour. 
7. The effect of flour sample weight air-classified (100 - 300 9), on 
dry weight yield of fines and coarse fractions, was investigated in 
Experiment 6 (using a single batch of whole cowpea flour, at a dngle 
separation cut size, and a constant feed rate), and was shown to have no 
effect. 
8. The effect of changing feed rate of a single batch of whole cowpea 
flour into the air classifier, on dry weight yield and protein yield of 
edr- classified fractions, was investigated in Experiment 7, at a single 
separation cut size, using three feed rates of 0.4,0.7 and 1.0 kg/h 
respectively. A significantly greater dry weight yield and protein yield 
of fines was obtained at slower feed rates. 
9. The influence of small changes in settings of air flow rateor 
classifier speed of the air classifier, onyield of fines and coarse 
fractions, of a single batch of whole cowpea flour, was investigated in 
Experiment 8. Five air flow rates and five classifier speeds were studied. 
Only when air flow rate was altered by more than 1m3 /h, was there any 
significant difference in yield of fines fractions. Classifier speed 
changes only significantLy affected yield of fines, wh6n they were'in 
excess of 750 rpm. 
6.2 THE EFFECT OF CHANGING SEPARATION CUT SIMON THE FRACTIONATION OF 
A SINGLE BATCH OF WHOLE COWPEA FLOUR. 
1. An estimate of the separation cut size, for matching pairs of air 
flow rate and classifier speed, for the Alpine zig-zag laboratory air 
classifier, was calculated for cowpea flour, using the manufacturers data 
and the measured density of whole cowpeas. 
2. Using a single batch of whole cowpea flour, air classification was 
carried out at 17 settings, over the estimated separation cut size range 
10 to 26 pm. (Experiments 9A and 9B). For each estimated separation cut 
size, 3 replicate, 100g samples were passed through the air classifier, 
using a completely randomised design. 
IA computer programme written in Algol 68 was devised by Mr. K. Freeman, 
for analysis of raw data fYom the Coulter counter, to produce data for 
"cumulative weight oversize", at given particle sizes, and to summarise 
these data as plots of particle-size distributions of individual flour 
samples. 
4. The estimated separation cut sizes, were compared with. those calculated 
from data obtained by direct measurement of particle-size distribution of 
the resulting replicate pairs of fines and coarse fractions, from Experiments 
9A and 9B, at classifier speeds 10.4 to 6.2 X 103 rpm, by Coulter counter. 
5. The measured-separation cut size range covered in Experiments 9A and 
9B., was found to be narrower (7.5 to 17.6jm) than the estimated separation 
cut size range (10 to 26 Vm). A new calibration curve for whole cowpeas 
was then constructed. 
6. Photographs of wh& cowpea flour by light microscopy, showed that 
some of the larger particles present, were agglomerates of small starch 
granules and hull fragments. A considerable proportion of the starch 
granules were <5 ijm. In contrast, photographs of the fines at classifier 
speed 7.2 X 103 rpm, showed that no large hull fragments were present and 
the proportion of small starch granules (< 5 pm) was much greater than in 
the whole flour. Using a metachromatic stain, protein bodies of <5 Jim 
were shown to be present in the fines, in agreement with published data 
concerning the size of legume protein bodies, as well as a considerable 
quantity of non-starch polysaccharide. 
7. Starch granule size analysis of whole cowpea flour, by manual 
counting under light microscopy, revealed that some starch granules were 
much smaDer than previously reported, with 30.1% :j3.5 lim. Large 
granules of 18 to 33 pm accounted for only 7.7% of the total number. The 
starch-granule size distribution of the fines at 3 classifier speeds, 
were markedly different from the whole flour and from each other. No 
large granules of 18 to 33 lim were found in any of the fines. The proportion 
of starch granules in the range 7 to 18 pm present in the fines, increased 
as separation cut size increased. 
8. A comparison of the performance of the air jet sieve. using the 15 Vm 
microsieve and Coulter counter, for particle-size analysis of each 
replicate air-classified fines fraction, at classifier speeds 11.6 to 6.2 
x 10' rpm, showed that the air jet sieve data was less reproducible than 
Coulter counter data, particularly for fines produced at lower separation 
cut sizes (7-5 to fo.. O_ um). This may be related to the lower quantity of 
starch granules in these samples. 
9. All the coarse fractions produced, had higher moisture contentsthan 
the corresponding fines. Experiments 9A and 9B showed that dry weight 
yield of the fines fractions increased as separation cut size increased, 
being very low at measured separation cut sizes lower than*lL, pm. 
10. Protein content of the fines produced in Experiments 9A and 9B, was 
found to be greatest at the smallest separation cut size studied (e. g. 
50.6% at measured separation cut size of-7. Slim, compared with 23.5% for the 
whole flour). Protein content decreased steadily in the fines, as separ- 
ation cut size increased, until measured separation cut size exceeded 
15 lim, after which the decrease was more rapid. Results for protein 
content of the fines compared favourably with those reported in the 
literature for dehulled, pin-milled cowpeas. 
11. Protein yield of fines increased$as separation cut size increased, 
in a similar manner to the changes in dry weight yield. 
12. Protein shift into the fines of air-classified cowpea flour was 
poor, in comparison with protein shifts reported for other legumes. The 
greatest protein shift was 17.1% at separation cut size 1411m and was 
lower at separation cut sizes greater or smaller than this. Low protein 
shifts of cowpea flour have previously been reported, and may be attrib- 
uted to the large proportion of small starch granules in this legume 
flour, as found by light microscopy. 
13. The starch content of whole cowpea flour was 49.4%, which compared 
favourably with values reported in the literature. Starch content of the 
fines, at 6 classifier speed .s between 9.7 and 6.7 X 103 rpm. ranged from 
0.8 to 13.7%, increasing in a similar manner to changes in measured- 
separation cut size. 
14. Coulter counter and starch analysis, suggested that whole cowpea flour 
had*3 populations of starch granules at; < 121im, ca. 121im and >15 Jim. Light 
microscopy showed that there were few starch granules greater than 18 jim, 
and a large population of small granules of <7 Um. 
15. Whole cowpea flour was found to contain 6.2% acid detergent fibre 
(ADF), 3.6% cellulose, 1.8% insoluble lignin and 0.8% ash, by the method 
of Goering and Van Soest (1970). These data compared favourably with the 
literature. No statistical differences were found between ADF content of 
the whole flour and fines, at any of the classifier speeds studied. This 
was in accordance with some previous reports, although a direct comparison 
of data with the literature was difficult to make. due to use of different 
methodologies and dehulled legume flours. 
16. Whale cowpea flour was found to contain 16.2% of total dietary 
fibre and 10% hemicellulose. Hemicellulose and total dietary fibre data 
were calculated by difference and as such, they can only be considered 
as preliminary data. However, data for the hemicellulose content of 
whole cowpeas, compared favourably with published work on pigeonpea and 
indicated that this was the major fibre component of whole cowpeas. 
17. Total'dietary fibre contents of the fines at 10 classifier speeds, 
were considerably higher than in the whole flour, ranging from'30.4 
to 36'04%. over the-range of classifier speeds studied, and corresponded' 
to total dietary fibre shifts of 22.6 to 25.1%. Hemicellulose content 
of the fines ranged from 25-110 30.3%, over the range of classifier speeds 
studied, being considerably higher than in the whole flour. Hemicellulose 
shifts ranged from 38.9 to 42.7%. Changing separation cut size, did not 
significantly affect dietary fibre or hemicellulose fractionation. 
18. Ash comprised 0.8% of the dry weight of whole cowpea flour and was 
not statistically different in the fines, at any of the'classifier speeds 
studied (8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm). This was contrary to previous reports on 
cowpea and other legumes. 
19. Neutral'detergent fibre (NDF) analysis was carried out on whole cowpea 
flour and fines, by the method of Goering and Van'Soest (1970) with and without 
preenzymic digestion of starch. Both methods gave very variable results, 
well outside'those of published data for other legumes, ' for both NDF and 
hemicellulose (NDF - ADF). Without predigestion, high values fcr NDF and 
hemicellulose were obtained, while predigestion lead to low NDF and hemi- 
cellulose values., 
20. Total oligosaccharide content of whole-cowpea flour was 7.2%, the 
major oligosaccharide being stachyose (6.0/09), followed by verbascose (1.2%) 
and trace-quantities of raffinose. These data compared favourably with 
published data. Total oligosaccharide content of the fines at 6 separation 
cut sizes, were'not statistically different from the whole flourat any 
of the classifier speeds studied. 
21. Sucrose content of whole cowpea flour was 3%. The fines were found 
to contain statistically less sucrose than the whole flour, at all classi- 
fier speeds studied, excepting 9.7 X 103 rpm, 
6.3 A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECT OF CHANGING SEPARATION CUT SIZE ON 
FRACTIONATION OF FLOUR FROM THREE LEGUME SPECIES, COWPEA, FABABEAN 
AND PICEONPEA (data included two varieties of each species). 
The effect of air classification on the fractionation of flour from 
different legume species and varieties was investigated. One variety of 
cowpea and two varieties each of fababean and pigeonpea, were used in this 
study (Experiment 10). The cowpea variety chosen, was designated cowpea 
variety 2. Data corresponding to that obtained for cowpea variety 1 in 
Experiment 9, are included in the results where appropriate, for comparison 
with cowpea variety 2. Variety 1 legumes were purchased from a local 
commercial wholesaler. Variety 2 legumes were obtained from international 
institutes overseas, were freshly harvested, catalogued varieties and 
were non-fumigated. Each legume was milled under the same conditions as 
cowpea variety 1 (Experiment 9) and air-classified over a narrower range 
of 7 separation cut sizes. The experiment was organised as a completely 
randomised design, with three replicates at each separation cut size. 
Due to time limitations, particle-size analysis, starch, dietary 
fibre and oligosaccharide analyses, were carried out for the fines at 
a. single separation cut size only (7.2 X 103 rpm), in order for comparison 
between, species and varieties to be made. This classifier speed corresp- 
onded to a measured separation cut size of 14-Um and was chosen, after analysis 
of data for cowpea variety l. revealed that this separation cut size gave 
the greatest protein shift. Appropriate statistical techniques were 
used to aid the interpretation of results. 
1. Starchgranule size analysis was carried out using a manual counting 
technique with light microscopy, on, all the whole flours i. e. cowpea varieties 
1 and 2, fababean varieties 1 and 2 and pigeonpea varieties 1 and 2. Of 
the 6 whole flours studied, cowpea variety 2 contained the greatest prop- 
ortion of small starch granules (i 3.5 pm) and fababean variety 1 contained 
the greatest proportion of large starch granules (22 to 36 vm) and the 
smallest number of small starch granules (j 3.5 jim). Pigeonpea varieties 
were intermediate between'these two species in terms of starch granule 
size distribution. 
2. Starch granule-size analysis was carried out on the fines of cowpea, 
fababean and pigeonpea variety 1 flours, at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. 
These showed a decrease in the proportion of large starch granules and 
an increase in the proportion of small starch granules present, 'in comp- 
arison with the whole flours. Cowpea variety 1 fines, contained consider- 
ably more small starch granules (< 3.5vm), than did fababean or pigeonpea, 
and fababeans fines contained the least number of small starch granules. 
3. Coulter counter particle-size analysis was carried out on the whole 
flours and*replicate fines fractionsat classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. 
Results showed that fababean variety 1 whole flour, exhibited the coarsest 
partide- size distribution of all 6 legume flours studied, and cowpea 
variety 2 whole flour, the finest particle-size distribution. 
4. All the fines fractions contained less moisture than the whole flour, 
as was found for cowpea variety 1 (Experiment 9). 
5. For the 6 legume flours studied, dry weight 4eld of the fines increased 
as classifier speed decreased (separation cut size increased), over the 
range 8.0 to 6.2 X 103 rpm. However, the dry weight yield of the fines 
varied from species to species and between varieties, cowpea variety 2 
producing the greatest fines dry weight yield, for any classifier speed 
in the range studied. 
6. The crude protein content of the 6 whole flours ranged from 20.6 to 
29.1%, fababean variety 1 flour containing the highest protein content and 
pigeonpea variety 2 flour, the lowest. These values compared favourably 
with previously reported values for these legume species. 
7. The crude protein content of the fines fractions was greatest at 
the fastest classifier speeds studied, for all the flours. -Separation of 
protein into the fines during air classification, va23ed between species; 
the crude protein content of the fines of both varieties of cowpea, fababean 
and pigeonpea, ranging from 26.5 to 44.3%, 48.6 to 62.7%, and 32.3 to 48.6% 
respectively. 
8. Significant positive linear relationships were found between protein 
content and dry weight yield of the fines,, for all the legume flours, 
allowing protein content of the fines to be predicted from dry weight 
yield. This had not been previously reported. However, the regression 
equation varied for each species and between fababean varieties. 
9. Protein yield of the fines increased as classifier speed decreased, 
for all 6 legumes. However, while for cowpeas, the protein yield at a 
given classifier speed was similar for both varieties, greater variation 
between varieties was shown for fababean and pigeonpea. 
10. Protein shift for both varieties of fababean ranged from 23 to 42.1% 
and continued to rise over the range of classifier speeds studied. Protein 
shift for both varieties of cowpea, ranged from 0.2 to 15.8%, reaching an 
optimum value over theL range of classifier speeds studied. . 
Protein 
shift in both varieties of pigeonpea ranged from 14.6 to 25.7%, with 
little change with classifier speed. Indications were, that both 
fababean and pigeonpea variety I flours may not have attained maximum 
protein shift, within the classifier speed range studied, whereas both 
cowpea varieties and pigeonpea variety 2 did. Thus, there may be a 
different optimum separation cut size for maximum protein shifting, for 
each legume. High protein shifts have previously been reported, using 
fababean for air classification. 
11. Starch content of the whole flours varied between species and between 
varieties, ranging from 44 to 49.4% for cowpea, 41.8 to 52.5% for fababean 
and 31.9 to 41.2% for pigeonpea. These compared favourably with published 
data for starch content of cowpea and fababean. The starch content of the 
fines was measured at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. There was a negative 
relationship between starch content and protein content of the fines, 
fababean fines containing the lowest starch contents and cowpea fines 
the highest, of all the legumes studied. 
12. The acid detergent fibre (ADF) content of the whole flours, was 
greatest (13.1%) for pigeonpea variety 2 and lowest for cow? ea variety 2 
(4.4%). These data compared favourably with published data for cowpeas 
and fababeans. As expected, ADF content of the seed was greatest for 
those legumes with the greatest percentage of hull of the whole seed. 
13. There was significantly less ADF in the fines of both varieties of 
fababean and pigeonpea,, than in their respective whole flours, indicating 
that ADF fractionated away from the fines during air-classification for 
these two legumes. However, no differences in OF fractionation at 
different classifier speeds were noted. In contrast, ADF content of the 
fines of both cowpea varieties were not statistically different to the 
whole flours Most published data concerning the fate of fibre during air 
classification, indicates that crude fibre (which originates mainly from 
the hulls) enters the coarse fraction during air classification., 
14. Hemicellulose values for whole flour and fines fractions were calcul- 
ated by difference, and total dietary fibre calculated accordingly. The 
whole legume flour with the highest total dietary fibre content was pigeonpea 
(variety 1,38.6%; variety 2,30.6%). Fababean variety 1 contained the 
least dietary fibre (11.6%). These data were considerably higher than 
NDF data reported in the literature. However, the NDF method does not 
measure soluble fibre components. Apart from fababean variety 1, hemicellu- 
lose was the major fibre in all legume flours studied, in agreement with 
published data for whole pigeonpea. 
15. The dietary fibre content of the fines fractions of the 6 air-classified 
legumes, at classifier speed 7.2 X 103rpM, was markedly higher than in the 
whole flours, for cowpea variety 1 and fababean variety 1,. In addition, 
slight increases in dietary fibre content were found in the fines of variety 2 
of cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea. In contrast, the, fines of pigeonpea variety 
1 contained less dietary fibre than the whole flour. Evidence of a total 
dietary fibre shift into the fines was only shown for cowpea variety 1 and 
fababean variety 1 flour.

16. Hemicellulose was the major dietary fibre component present in the 
fines of all the legumes studied, ranging from 13.2% to 30.3% and was 
higher in the fines, than in the whole flours, for all legumes, excepting 
pigeonpea variety 1. Hemicellulose shift was greater than total dietary 
fibre shift for all legumes studied. Dietary fibre (as neutral detergent 
fibre) had previously been reported to concentrate in the fines of air- 
classified cowpea and fababean. 
17. Ash content of thewhole flours were all less than 1%. This was 
lower than published data. No statistical differences were found between 
the ash content of the fines fractions at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm 
and the respective whole flours, for any of the legumes studied, contrary 
to published data on these and other legume flours. 
18. Total oligosaccharide content of whole cowpea, fababean and pigeonpea, 
flours, showed variation between species, but little variation between 
varieties. Cowpea variety 1 contained the greatest levels of total oligo- 
saccharide (7.2%) and fababean variety 1, the lowest levels (3.2%). These 
values compared favourably with reported literature for these legumes. 
The major oligosaccharide of both varieties of cowpea was stachyose (5-3 
to 6.0%), whereas tho major oligosaccharide of both varieties of fababean 
and pigeonpea was verbascose (2.1 to 3.7%), with only trace quantities 
of raffinose, in accordance with published literature. 
19. Total oligosoecharide content of the fines ranged from 5.1% (fababean) 
to 9.5% (cowpea), at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. Significant differ- 
ances were found between the oligosaccharide contents of the fines and whole 
flours, for both varieties of fababean and pigeonpea, but not for cowpea. 
Data indicated, that oligosaccharidesmay shift into the fines with the 
protein, as had previously been reported in the literature for other 
legumes. 
20. The sucrose content of the whole flours ranged from 1.4 to 3.6%, with 
variation between species, but little between varieties. Data showed, that 
separation of sucrose during air classification was inconsistent. Wide 
variation occurred between the fines of the different varieties and 
species, at classifier speed 7.2 X 103 rpm. This inconsistency had 
previously been indicated in the literature for cowpea and fababean.
