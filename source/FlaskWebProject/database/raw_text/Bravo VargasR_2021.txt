Abstract
To avoid driving climate change on a dangerous path, a substantial reduction in greenhouse
gases emissions is required. Hence, a high penetration of renewable energy technologies is
essential, but most renewables are either affordable or dispatchable but not both.
Energy storage systems integrated into concentrating solar power (CSP) plants can enhance dis-
patchability and solar-to-electricity efficiency. Besides, the combination of dispatchable CSP
plants with lower cost photovoltaic (PV) plants exploits synergies between the reliability of
CSP with energy storage and cost of PV. However, this integration leads to complex interactions
between the different technologies and requires sophisticated design guidelines to achieve low
costs and high dispatchability simultaneously.
In this thesis, a two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework for the design and opera-
tion of hybrid CSP-PV plants with energy storage is developed. The two-stage optimisation
simultaneously optimises the design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant with respect
to competing technical and financial performances.
The multi-objective operational optimisation stage finds the best operational strategy of a
hybrid power plant with energy storage systems. The model, written in Python, uses a typi-
cal meteorological year to optimise one-year hourly operation. The results demonstrate that
the integration of an energy storage system in a concentrating solar power plant provides
dispatchability and, when hybridised with photovoltaic, enhances its competitiveness with
current electricity prices. The low mismatch between supply and demand, even when a fixed
commitment is required throughout the year, together with high overall efficiency, indicates
that the integration of energy storage in hybrid solar power plants is an opportunity to increase
the penetration of solar energy in the power sector.
The design of reliable and cost-competitive hybrid solar power plants requires the careful
balancing of trade-offs between financial and technical performance. Hence, the design op-
timisation stage optimises the capacities of the main components of the hybrid power plant and
handles financial and technical objectives.
Different configurations are analysed as case studies throughout the thesis to analyse the im-
pacts, interactions, and synergies of technology integration. Three locations are investigated,
which present different solar resource profiles: Seville (Spain), Tonopah (USA), and the Ata-
cama Desert (Chile).
The optimisation results are used to develop some guidelines for the optimal design of dis-
patchable hybrid solar power plants with energy storage based on the given solar resource
and required dispatchability. These guidelines provide an initial design for affordable and
dispatchable hybrid solar power plants and can enable their widespread deployment.
The model developed can be applied to other locations under different input parameters and
demand profiles. Besides, the flexibility of the model allows it to be extended in order to
evaluate different energy conversion and storage technologies to design hybrid power plants
with energy storage under different configurations and requirements. Thus, the optimisation
framework can provide valuable information for the integration of different technologies to
support the affordable and sustainable transition to a clean energy system.
Lay Summary
A substantial reduction of greenhouses gas emissions is required in the power sector to prevent
a significant rise in the global atmospheric temperature. Renewable power generation tech-
nologies are essential to achieve the required emissions reduction and to promote sustainable
development. The development of affordable and reliable renewable power plants is essential
to support the widespread deployment of sustainable energy technologies.
Current research on sustainable energy systems has shown that the integration of thermal
energy storage in large scale concentrating solar power plants enhances the reliability and
the solar-to-electricity efficiency of solar energy technologies. Besides, the hybridisation of
concentrating solar power plant with solar photovoltaic plants improves the plants affordability
while maintaining the reliability. The intermittency of the solar resource and the integration of
energy storage systems requires the use of sophisticated techniques for the optimal design of
hybrid solar power plants.
This thesis focuses on the development of modelling and optimisation tools to optimise the
design and operation of solar power plants with energy storage and to provide guidelines
for the optimal development of sustainable energy systems under different conditions and
requirements. Different configurations are analysed as case studies, to evaluate the impacts, in-
teractions, and synergies of technology integration. Besides, three locations are studied, which
cover a range of solar resource profiles, in order to evaluate opportunities in the integration of
clean technologies in different places.
The tools developed provide essential information in the decision-making process for the de-
sign of reliable and affordable power plants, going beyond the often used manual design
process. The optimisation provides key performance indicators such as affordability, reliability,
capacity factor, and efficiencies, to compare the performance of different designs and locations.
The results confirm that the integration of an energy storage system increases the reliability of
concentrating solar power plants and that the combination with photovoltaic plants is essential
to achieve competitive energy costs. The results highlight the potential of the integration of
different technologies in the design of affordable and reliable renewable power plants to support
the transition to a sustainable energy system.

Introduction
1.1 Overview
One of the main challenges as scientists is to support sustainable development, i.e. meeting
current needs of our society without compromising future generations to meet their own needs
(Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019). Provide access to
affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is one of the goals defined by the United
Nations (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019). This goal
not only focuses on eradicating energy poverty and indoor air pollution but also in preventing
the adverse effects of climate change.
Energy systems have been defined as "the connected processes of acquiring and using energy
in a given society or economy" (Jaccard, 2006). Three subsystems are usually applied to
describe energy systems: primary energy, energy carriers or secondary energy, and energy
end-use. Primary energy involves the natural form of energy, i.e. renewable resources (e.g.
solar, wind, wave, geothermal, biomass), fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, natural gas), and nuclear
fuels (e.g. uranium). Then, energy carriers involve transformation of primary energy and are
useful forms to connect primary energy with end-users. Common energy carriers are electricity,
fossil fuels products (e.g. diesel, gasoline, natural gas), heat, hydrogen. Finally, these secondary
energy sources are used in different end-use applications and devices in the society, e.g. farm
mechanisation, heating, lighting, transport, etc.
Fossil fuels are the basis of our current energy system. In 2018, 81% of the worlds primary
energy demand was supplied by fossil fuels (IEA, 2019c). From extraction to combustion, the
use of fossil fuels generates many environmental and societal hazards. In the last stage of this
chain, the burning of fossil fuels creates high quantities of CO2, the most significant greenhouse
gas (Everett et al., 2012). Based on scientific evidence and research (Pachauri et al., 2014), there
is a high correlation between the increase in the atmospheric temperature with the concentration
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the atmosphere is just one of the GHG
sinks. The oceans also capture large amounts of CO2. This addition of CO2 increases its acidity,
which threatens life in the oceans.
According to IEA (2019b), global greenhouse gas emissions have significantly increased in
1.1. Overview 4
the recent past. Nevertheless, despite a substantial deployment of renewable power plants, the
global emission trend has flattened during the last decade but remains high. The increase in
global greenhouse gas emissions during the last years is the product of two important and
interdependent factors: (i) the increase in electricity consumption per capita (i.e. from 2.1 MWh
per capita in 1990 to 3.2 MWh per capita in 2017), and (ii) the increase in emission from
economies under development (IEA, 2019b). Nevertheless, the high increase in the electricity
generation from renewable technologies from 2010 to 2017, i.e.: (i) solar PV, 1380%; (ii) solar
thermal, 660%; (iii) wind 330%; (iv) tide and wave 200%; (v) geothermal, 125%; and (vi)
hydro, 120%, compared with the growth of electricity generation from fossil fuels (natural gas,
oil, and coal), i.e. 115%, suggests that the transition to a clean energy system is encouraging
(IEA, 2019b).
Despite the dominance of renewable sources in the growth in the power generation capacity
(IEA, 2019a), more efforts still have to be pursued. A high deployment of intermittent renew-
able energy technologies led by solar PV, then wind and hydro has been seen in the last years.
Nevertheless, the imbalance between anthropogenic emissions and natural sinks is still high. In
this context, due to the extensive emissions from industrial revolution, the current level of CO2
in the atmosphere (over 400 ppm), compared with the amount estimated before the industrial
revolution (around 200 ppm) has had substantial effect in the atmosphere and the oceans that
have started jeopardising the life of some societies. Renewable energy technologies are key to
enhance the sustainable development, and larger and quicker deployment of clean technologies
is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reach a long-term balance between sources
and sinks to avoid a rise in global temperature higher than 2 C (IEA, 2019a; Gr, 2018).
Renewable power plants have low maintenance and operational costs (NREL, 2018), their car-
bon emissions and air pollution are substantially lower compared to fossil fuel power stations
(Pehl et al., 2017), and their development is key to energy independence. Nevertheless, renew-
able power plants can dispatch energy just when the natural resource is available. For instance,
solar and wind resources are intermittent. Consequently, power plants based on solar and wind
are not dispatchable. This means that the power supply from some renewable power plants
depends on the variability of the resource, and sometimes it is not possible to match supply
and demand profiles. Hence, the continuous growth in the penetration of renewable energy
technologies in the power sector and the natural variability of the resource (e.g. solar, wind)
adds large fluctuations in generation and significant mismatches with power demand (Denholm
and Hand, 2011). To reduce variability and increase dispatchability of renewable power plants,
the integration of energy storage allows having control in the power dispatch (Denholm et al.,
2015b). Therefore, renewable energy technologies are fundamental to decarbonise the power
sector, but the integration of energy storage is crucial to provide dispatchable energy (Denholm
et al., 2015b; Jenkins et al., 2018; Amy et al., 2019; Bui et al., 2018).
Solar photovoltaic (PV) is an excellent alternative to provide affordable but intermittent power
1.1. Overview 5
(Sampaio and Gonzlez, 2017). Electrical energy storage (e.g. batteries) integrated into PV
plants enhance its dispatchability. However, current costs of batteries (around 300 - 550 USD
kWh1) and the scarcity of the raw materials used (e.g. lithium) compromise their viability
for large scale applications (Fernndez et al., 2019b). On the other hand, thermal energy
storage (TES) can be up to two orders of magnitude cheaper than electrical energy storage
systems (Lund et al., 2016). Current power plants in operation suggest that Concentrated Solar
Power plants (CSP) combined with TES have the potential to provide dispatchable power at
competitive costs (Liu et al., 2016; SolarPACES, 2018; Maximov et al., 2019; Peng et al.,
2017). Due to its high potential, many studies have focused on the analysis of the integration of
TES into CSP plants (Zurita et al., 2018; Ortiz et al., 2019a). Consequently, the hybridisation
of CSP-TES with affordable solar PV is gaining attention (Peng et al., 2017; Strhle et al.,
2016).
The combination of these technologies exploits synergies between dispatchability of CSP with
energy storage and affordability of PV. However, this combination leads to complex inter-
actions between the different plants and requires sophisticated techniques to simultaneously
achieve low costs and high dispatchability. To design a dispatchable and also affordable energy
system, a design optimisation stage is necessary to select the right size of the main components.
On the one hand, if one component is undersized, there will be a bottleneck in the operation,
that results in a reduction in the efficiency of the whole process. On the other hand, the
oversizing of a component will result in an unnecessary high investment cost, increasing the
cost of energy. In addition, the operation of renewable power plants integrated with energy
storage leads to complex interactions between the different components of the power plant, the
intermittent resource, and the power supply required. Hence, this research aims to develop a
framework to optimise the design of a hybrid solar power plant with energy storage (i.e. the
size of the main components) while simultaneously optimising the operational strategy with the
aim of providing design guidelines for affordable and dispatchable sustainable energy systems
under different conditions and configurations.
Current optimal operational studies of hybrid power plants with energy storage have been
focused on the analysis of single objectives (Petrollese and Cocco, 2016), or the evaluation
of a limited temporal resolution representing the analysis of a whole year (Salas et al., 2018;
Alovisio et al., 2017). In this context, Ortiz et al. (2018a) conclude that hourly simulations
considering variable solar irradiation need to be investigated to improve the analysis in the
integration and design of CSP plants with thermal energy storage.
According to IEA (2014b), locations close to the Tropics (Capricorn and Cancer), with clear
skies and high solar irradiation have the best condition to the development of CSP technologies.
However, each location requires a bespoke design due to the complex interactions between the
different parts of the system and the differences in solar resource profile. Hence, to analyse
projects under development, and potential locations for further deployment of solar plants
1.1. Overview 6
with energy storage, the following locations which cover a range of different profiles will be
evaluated in this research: Seville, Spain; Tonopah, Nevada, United States; and the Atacama
Desert, Chile. While Northern Chile has one of the highest solar irradiations in the world,
Nevada and Southern Spain are among the sunniest region in the United States and Europe
respectively. Moreover, power tower CSP projects in operation or under construction can be
found in these areas, for instance, Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant (Seville), Crescent Dunes
Solar Energy Project (Tonopah), Atacama-1 (Chile) (NREL, 2017)
This research develops a multi-objective optimisation framework for the optimal design of
hybrid CSP-PV plants integrated with energy storage systems. Chapter 2 gives a background of
solar energy technologies and energy storage systems applied in solar power plants. In addition,
a review of modelling and optimisation techniques is presented. In Chapter 3, a two-stage
optimisation framework to optimise the design of a hybrid power plant by genetic algorithms,
and the operation by linear programming is presented. The results conclude that the analysis
of the trade-off between technical and economic performance is key to design an affordable
and dispatchable power plant. Moreover, the direct link between the objectives of the design
and operational optimisation routines is crucial to exploit the synergies of different technolo-
gies. In Chapters 4 to 7, this framework is applied to design and analyse the performance of
different configurations of hybrid solar power plants with energy storage, considering different
solar resource profiles covering the feasible conditions for solar power plants. The results are
then used to develop guidelines for the optimal design of dispatchable solar power plants for
locations with good solar resource.
1.2 Aims and objectives
This research will address the following question: Can solar power plants be affordable and
dispatchable, and help us in the transition to a clean and sustainable energy system and avoid
driving climate change on a dangerous path? In order to analyse different technologies and
strategies, the research background focuses on the integration of hybrid solar power plants with
thermal energy storage systems. Then, the hypothesis of this research can be defined as: The
integration of different existing technologies for energy generation, conversion, and storage can
provide affordable, sustainable, clean and reliable power.
Finally, to test the hypothesis, this research focuses on the development of mathematical and
programming tools to model and optimise the design and operation of hybrid solar power plants
with energy storage systems under multi-criteria analyses. The tools provide decision-makers
and policy developers a range of choices of affordable and dispatchable power plants that can
be used in initial phases to design the transition to a future sustainable energy system or to set
targets for widespread deployment of renewable power technologies under different conditions
and requirements.

1.5 Thesis structure
The thesis is divided in 8 chapters.
 Chapter 2 gives a background of solar energy technologies and energy storage systems
applied in solar power plants. In addition, a review of simulation and optimisation tech-
niques and tools is presented.
 Chapter 3 presents the optimisation method used in this thesis. A two-stage optimisation
framework to simultaneously find the optimal design of hybrid solar power plants with
energy storage while optimising its operation is developed. In this chapter, a complete
analysis of the operation of each energy conversion and storage technology is studied.
Moreover, the main equations used in the multi-objective optimisation, i.e. financial and
technical performance, are detailed.
 Chapter 4 exposes the application of the framework for the optimal design of a hybrid
solar power plant with two-tanks molten salt technology as a sensible thermal energy
storage system. Here the model focuses on the improvement of the design of a power
plant under development in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile. The results of the
1.5. Thesis structure 10
case study analysed in this chapter demonstrate the importance of balancing the trade-
off between financial and technical performance in order to enhance the affordability of
solar technologies.
 Chapter 5 illustrates different configurations to improve the performance of renewable
power plants. In this chapter, the integration of batteries as electrical energy storage for
the PV plant, as well as the integration of a fossil backup unit for the thermal energy
storage of the CSP plants are studied. In addition, the analysis of the heat supply (from
the heat rejection of the CSP plant) for low-temperature processes of a copper mine
is developed. Finally, the integration of a wind farm, in order to decrease the joint
variability of the renewable resource of a hybrid power plant is analysed and discussed.
 Chapter 6 focuses on the operational optimisation of a calcium-looping process as a
thermochemical energy storage system integrated into a hybrid solar power plant. In
this analysis, a one-year hourly time-step optimisation is performed in order to evaluate
the daily and seasonal variability of the solar resource. Besides, different configurations
are evaluated and a sensitivity analysis is carried out in order to evaluate the effects of
technical and financial parameters in the affordability and dispatchability of hybrid solar
power plants with thermochemical energy storage systems.
 Chapter 7 details the application of the two-stage multi-objective optimisation frame-
work for the optimal design of a thermochemical energy storage system integrated into
a hybrid solar power plant in three different locations, i.e. Seville, Tonopah, and the
Atacama Desert. In addition, the results of the multi-objective optimisation are used to
develop guidelines to use as an approximation to design affordable and dispatchable
sustainable power plants under different solar resource and requirements.
 Chapter 8 summarises the results and conclusions presented in this thesis and discusses
potential further research.
Chapter 2
Background
This chapter provides the background necessary to understand the main technologies stud-
ied in this research. Section 2.1 presents information of solar energy technologies. Here the
main technologies analysed are solar photovoltaic and solar thermal. Then, concentrating solar
power (CSP) plants are explained. Section 2.2 gives an overview of different energy storage
technologies employed in power systems. After that, this section introduces different energy
storage technologies suitable or under development for the integration into renewable power
plants. Section 2.3 describes a hybrid solar power plant and its integration with energy storage
systems. In this section, some synergies achieved with technology integration are illustrated.
Section 2.4 exposes three conceptual levels that apply to energy systems optimisation. Then, a
review of optimisation techniques is provided, and some examples found in the literature are
presented. Finally, Section 2.5 exposes key knowledge gaps that will be addressed in this thesis.
2.1 Solar energy technologies
The conversion of solar energy into electricity is achieved by two types of technologies, i.e.
solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants. Solar thermal uses solar irradiation to
heat a fluid that can be used as a heat addition in a gas or a vapour power cycle to generate
electricity by the use of a turbine and generator. Solar PV converts the sunlight directly into
electricity by the photovoltaic effect employing semiconductor materials.
2.1.1 Solar Photovoltaic
The most deployed photovoltaic modules currently used in PV plants are made of silicon.
Mono-crystalline silicon modules, with typical nominal efficiencies close to 20%, maximum
power and voltages in the order of 300 Wdc and 50 Vdc, respectively, are usually employed in
large scale solar power plants (NREL, 2018). In a typical array, solar panels are installed in se-
ries to produce the desired voltage. Exposed to sunlight, the characteristic of a semiconductive
silicon cell allows the flow of electrons, creating an electrical current and voltage, this effect is
known as the photovoltaic effect.
2.1. Solar energy technologies 12
PV modules convert sunlight into direct current (dc) electricity. Then in order to dispatch power
to the grid, an inverter is used to transform dc electricity into alternate current (ac) electricity.
Other main components of a PV power plant are support structures, wires and control system.
The characteristics of the photovoltaic modules are generally provided based on the peak output
(kWp), which represents the power output of the module under reference conditions, i.e. total
irradiance of 1000 Wm2, and cell temperature of 25 C (NREL, 2018).
Currently, according to NREL (2018), the total installed cost of a commercial PV plant, based
on peak output, is lower than 2 USDW1dc , and fixed annual operational and maintenance costs
are around 16 USDkW1. Some benefits like the flexibility of solar PV to be installed in
remote locations, the high drop in investment costs of modules, and the need to reduce carbon
emissions, have allowed a high penetration of PV in the last decade. In this context, the global
installed capacity of PV has increased from 22 GW in 2009 to 480 GW in 2018 (IRENA,
2018) where the leaders are China (175 GW), USA (50 GW) and Germany (46 GW). Figure
2.1 shows the potential of photovoltaic electricity in the world. Here kWh/kWp indicates the
electricity generated by a solar PV array on average over a period of a day and a year. The
figure highlights that Chile is one of the best places to develop PV projects. This country has
seen an increase in the installed capacity of PV power plants from 2 MW at the end of 2012
(IRENA, 2018) to 2.7 GW in March 2020 (Energa Abierta, 2019).
The large-scale and quick penetration of intermittent PV presents essential challenges in the
electrical grid (Sinsel et al., 2020). Different alternatives are suggested to spread the integration
of variable renewable resources in the power sector. For example, the combination of energy
storage and grid reinforcement (Sinsel et al., 2020), as well as a more extensive portfolio of
generation technologies to reduce the total variability of the renewable resource (Carnegie
Mellon University, 2013), are the most attractive options.
2.1.2 Solar thermal power
Solar thermal technologies capture the solar irradiation and convert it into heat. Then, de-
pending on the application, the heat can be used to provide process heat or electricity. High-
temperature heat is required to produce electricity. The most deployed technologies to generate
electricity from sunlight are based on the concentration of irradiation by mirrors, producing
superheated steam and running a turbine-generator in a conventional Rankine cycle. Concen-
trating solar power (CSP) plants use tracking mirrors to focus the sunlight on a small area
(collector), where the solar irradiation is converted into heat and used to heat a fluid (Kalogirou,
2009). Hence, CSP plants need direct solar irradiation to operate. Then, the heat is used in the
thermodynamic cycle to generate electricity, or, in the case that an energy storage system is in-
tegrated, stored to use when needed. Large scale commercial CSP plants have been operating in
California since the 1980s, and some of these power plants are still in operation (IEA, 2014b).
Four different CSP technologies have been under development and implemented from small
2.1. Solar energy technologies 13
Figure 2.1: World map of photovoltaic electricity potential (The World Bank, 2019)
scale to utility-scale projects around the world, i.e. parabolic trough, linear Fresnel reflectors,
dish or Stirling-engine systems, and heliostat field collectors or solar tower (SolarPACES,
2018). While parabolic trough and solar tower technologies are commercially available and
have been implemented as large-scale projects, linear Fresnel collectors have not achieved
commercial maturity, and parabolic dish configurations are generally applied in small-scale
off-grid systems.
Parabolic trough and linear Fresnel reflectors are composed of single-axis mirrors that focus
the solar irradiation onto a linear receiver tube. Dish and heliostats field technologies focus
the sunlight in a focal point. Focal point CSP technologies reach higher temperatures and
efficiencies. Nevertheless, focal point configurations require more advances 2-dimensional
tracking mechanisms compared with 1-dimensional tracking mechanisms required in parabolic
trough and linear Fresnel reflectors (Fernndez et al., 2019a).
Parabolic trough collectors track the sun in one direction focusing it along a focal line, as
shown in Figure 2.2. This mature technology is commonly used to reach temperatures close
to 400 C (Duffie and Beckman, 2013). An example of a large-scale solar power plant based
on this technology built during the last decade is the Mojave Solar Project, located in the
Mojave Desert, California. With 250 MW net electricity generation capacity and an investment
of approximately 1,600 MUSD, this power plant started its operation in 2014 (Abengoa Solar,
2016). Mojave Solar Project is composed of 2,200 parabolic trough collectors, with a total
reflective area of 1.5106 m2. During the last four years (2016-2019), this solar power plant
supplied an average of 584.6 GWhyear1 of electricity, achieving an average capacity factor
2.1. Solar energy technologies 14
Figure 2.2: Parabolic trough CSP (Solar Energy Technologies office, 2013)
Figure 2.3: Linear Fresnel CSP (Solar Energy Technologies office, 2013)
of 27% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020).
Linear Fresnel collectors are linear mirrors that concentrate the solar irradiation on a linear
receiver. This technology, illustrated in Figure 2.3, has not achieved commercial maturity
(Duffie and Beckman, 2013). Hence, only a limited number of projects have been developed.
One of the largest power plants in operation is Puerto Errado 2, located in Murcia, Spain. With a
30 MW net capacity, this power plant started its operation in 2012 (SolarPACES, 2018). Puerto
Errado 2 Thermosolar Power Plant is composed of 28 lines of 940 m linear Fresnel collectors,
with a total reflective area of 3105 m2. This solar power plant generates annually approximately
49 GWh of electricity, resulting in a capacity factor of 19% (SolarPACES, 2018).
Parabolic dish reflector, as shown in Figure 2.4, is a two-axis collector that focuses the sunlight
in the focal point of the dish. This system can reach temperatures larger than 1,500 C. Each
dish operates independently and has a capacity in the range of 5-25 kW (Duffie and Beckman,
2013). This technology is commonly used as a stand-alone off-grid system and used in small
2.1. Solar energy technologies 15
Figure 2.4: Dish/Engine CSP (Solar Energy Technologies office, 2013)
scale applications in the range 10-400 kW.
Finally, heliostat field collector (Figure 2.5), or solar tower technology, uses two-axis tracking
mirrors (heliostats) to focus the solar irradiation into a chamber located at the top of a tower.
More details on the solar tower technology are given in Section 3.3. This technology, also
known as central receiver system, is typically used in large-scale configurations, with optimal
capacities in the range of 50-400 MW (Duffie and Beckman, 2013). During recent years, solar
tower systems have shown an interesting development, and the largest solar power plants in
operation or under construction are based on this technology. For instance, the Crescent Dunes
power plant, located in Nevada started its operation in 2015. This power plant is one of the
first large-scale CSP plants to supply almost continuous electricity by using a single tower, a
110 MW power block, and energy storage system equivalent to 10 hours of full power (Solar
Reserve LLC, 2012). Current solar tower power plants integrate molten salts as a thermal
energy storage (TES) system, reaching capacity factors, based on the power block capacity,
closer to 65% (Duffie and Beckman, 2013). For instance, Atacama-1, located in Northern Chile,
is composed of a solar tower power plant that is expected to start its operation during this year
(2020). With a 110 MW net capacity, Atacama-1 is composed of 10,600 heliostats, with a total
solar field aperture area of 1.48106 m2. The integration of 17.5 hours of TES will allow a
continuous operation (Cerro Dominador, 2019).
In order to reach the desired performance, CSP technologies need high values of direct normal
irradiation. For instance, to produce more than 1 kWhe per m2 per day, the solar field of the CSP
plant needs a direct normal irradiation (DNI) greater than 7 kWhm2 day1 (IEA, 2014b).
As shown in Figure 2.6 and according to IEA (2014b), areas with clear skies close to the
Tropic of Capricorn and Cancer, between north or south latitudes of 15 and 40, present the best
conditions for its operation. Currently, large power plants that are under study, development
and construction are located in these zones, for example, the south-western United States
2.1. Solar energy technologies 16
Figure 2.5: Solar tower CSP (Solar Energy Technologies office, 2013)
(California, Arizona), Southern Spain, Northern Chile, among others (Balghouthi et al., 2016;
SolarPACES, 2018; Parrado et al., 2016b). In this context, the Atacama Desert is one of the
most attractive places to develop CSP plants due to high levels of direct normal irradiation
(Cceres et al., 2013; Starke et al., 2016; Parrado et al., 2016a). Other studies demonstrate the
suitability of CSP with TES to work as baseload power plant (Grageda et al., 2016; Starke
et al., 2018). Some of these projects integrate TES, while other designs consider hybridisation.
For instance, Atacama-1 or Cerro Dominador Solar Power Plant, located in Northern Chile,
will supply firm electricity by combining CSP with TES, capable of delivering energy at full
working capacity for 17.5 hours during hours without solar irradiation. Besides, hybridisation
was considered by integrating a PV plant (Abengoa Solar, 2016). While energy storage systems
allow full dispatchability, hybridisation offers performance benefits and synergies. It improves
both technical and financial performance by integrating a cheaper technology, e.g. solar PV,
with more expensive but dispatchable technology, e.g. CSP with TES (Petrollese and Cocco,
2016; Pan and Dinter, 2017). In the long term, due to the cost reduction of batteries, the
integration of electrical batteries as energy storage systems with solar PV could be key to
develop dispatchable power plants with improved financial performance.

2.2 Energy storage systems
Energy storage systems can store energy to change its temporal or even its geographical con-
sumption (IEA, 2014a). Energy storage technologies can be deployed at a large or small scale at
different locations in the energy system. According to the application, energy storage systems
are commonly divided into electricity and thermal. Nowadays, the energy storage research
community aims to improve the efficiency of the energy storage systems and its integration
into intermittent renewable resources to increase the stability of the grid.
In power systems, energy can be stored in different forms: Mechanical, Electrochemical, Elec-
trical, Chemical or Thermal (IEC, 2011). Currently, the most used technologies in the electrical
grid, due to its technical and financial performance in large scale integration, are different kinds
of mechanical energy storage (pumped hydro, compressed air energy storage) and chemical
energy storage (hydrogen, synthetic natural gas) (Abbas et al., 2013; IEC, 2011).
Moreover, depending on the required application, energy storage systems can be integrated into
different areas of the electrical grid: generation, transmission, distribution, or the customer side
(Abbas et al., 2013). In renewable energy power plants, energy storage systems can be applied
to the system under two objectives: injection profiling (time-shifting) or injection smoothing
(capacity firming) (Zini, 2016). While injection profiling focus on storing energy to be used
later, injection smoothing aims to provide a firm power supply over a period of time.
Energy storage technologies that are suitable or under development for the integration into
renewable energy plants focusing on both time-shifting and injection smoothing are batteries
2.2. Energy storage systems 18
(Abbas et al., 2013) and TES (Denholm et al., 2015b). One of the prominent technologies
that are plausible to be included in large scale power plants are batteries based on lithium-
ion (Li-ion), sodium sulphur and lead-acid technologies (IEA, 2017). Large scale batteries are
used in intermittent renewable power plants, such as wind farms or PV plants, to decrease the
curtailment and increase the dispatchability (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019).
According to IRENA, around 90% of the battery system projects developed during 2017 were
based on Li-ion technology.
However, a large scale battery infrastructure is at least one or two orders of magnitude more
expensive than TES (NREL, 2018). TES is a key alternative that has been implemented in
CSP plants to store heat and deliver energy in the form of heat or electricity, increasing the
dispatchability of solar power plants and promoting the integration of renewable energy power
plants (Dinter and Mller, 2016; Powell et al., 2017). TES systems can be divided into three
categories: sensible, latent, and thermochemical energy storage (TCES).
Sensible energy storage is currently developed in commercial CSP plants (Mohan et al., 2019).
In this context, molten-salt technologies are the most deployed technology (Fernndez et al.,
2019a). More details on the two-tanks molten salts technology are given in Section 3.4.1. This
system uses differences in the temperature of a substance to store energy (sensible heat). For
instance, a typical molten-salt used in CSP plants is composed of NaNO3/KNO3 (i.e. sodium
nitrate and potassium nitrate), with a heat capacity of 1.52 kJkg1C1 (at 390 C) (Fernndez
et al., 2019a). In addition, costs reported for molten-salt thermal energy storage systems are
around 25 USDkWh1t (Zurita et al., 2018; NREL, 2018).
Latent heat storage systems use the enthalpy of phase change of a suitable material to store
and release energy (Prieto and Cabeza, 2019). Usually, this process is based on the solid-
liquid phase change (melting-solidification) (Cabeza et al., 2015). Hence, this process occurs
at a constant temperature (latent heat). Due to the complexity in the design and operation of
these systems, currently, the integration of latent heat thermal energy storage systems into a
CSP plant has not reached commercial maturity. Nevertheless, several studies have proposed
different configurations and materials to demonstrate their technical feasibility (Prieto and
Cabeza, 2019). Examples of components that have been proposed for the integration into CSP
are NaNO3 (specific heat 1.82 kJkg1C1, cost 25.2 USDkWh1t ), NaCl-KCl-LiCl (1.34
kJkg1C1, cost 36 USDkWh1t ), among others (Prieto and Cabeza, 2019).
Finally, TCES uses the enthalpy of a reversible chemical reaction. Materials based on chemical
reactions with high energy storage density and reversibility are required. TCES is generally
used in high-temperature processes, and usually, the enthalpy of reaction (Hr ) of the chemical
process is between 80-180 kJmol1 (Cabeza et al., 2015). TCES is a promising technology
with the potential for high energy storage densities and no storage losses beside the initial loss
of the sensible heat (Ortiz et al., 2018a). A reversible process that has received significant
attention for the implementation into CSP plants is the calcination/carbonation of calcite,
2.2. Energy storage systems 19
Figure 2.7: Hybrid solar power plant (CSP-PV) integrated with a thermochemical energy
storage system
with a working temperature in the range of 700 - 1000 C. This process, knows as calcium-
looping (CaL) has important advantages that make it an attractive technology as a TCES
system (Pardo et al., 2014; Ortiz et al., 2019a; Criado et al., 2017; Bui et al., 2018). For
instance, the abundance and low price of the precursor materials (i.e. limestone or dolomite),
the properties of the products (non-corrosive, non-toxic) (Mller et al., 2011; Bui et al., 2018),
and its theoretical high energy density (4.4 GJ m3) (Gil et al., 2010). More details on the
calcium-looping technology are given in Section 6.2.
Due to its high potential, many studies have focused on the analysis of the integration of two-
tank molten salt as TES or calcium-looping as a TCES process into CSP plants (Zurita et al.,
2018; Ortiz et al., 2019a). For instance, Figure 2.7 shows a calcium-looping process integrated
into a CSP plant and hybridised with solar PV. This configuration will be studied in depth in
Chapters 6 and 7.
2.3 Hybrid solar power plants with energy storage systems
Some research demonstrates that hybrid systems integrating high-cost CSP with TES and low-
cost PV power plants are one of the most suitable sustainable technologies to provide economi-
cal, reliable, and dispatchable power (Denholm et al., 2015b), and that the hybridisation of such
systems allows even greater performance (Petrollese and Cocco, 2016; Pan and Dinter, 2017;
Srilakshmi et al., 2017; Starke et al., 2018). Moreover, the operational optimisation of a solar
2.3. Hybrid solar power plants with energy storage systems 20
tower system integrated with TES and hybridised with a PV plant allows reaching high capacity
factors (Green et al., 2015; Starke et al., 2016). Hence, the hybridisation of firm generation
from CSP plants with TES and lower cost generation from PV power plants enables excellent
features like dispatchability, decreases the intermittent generation from renewables, it is able to
match supply and demand, and reduce the levelised cost of electricity from solar power plants.
Besides, as a pathway to cost-competitive decarbonisation for electricity generation, a co-firing
option can be included into a CSP plant to get a firm power supply, working even with no solar
irradiation, hence, increasing its dispatchability but at the cost of emissions.
In order to evaluate the dispatchability of renewable power plants integrated with energy stor-
age, several studies focus on the simulation of a typical period to estimate the operation of a
whole year (Ortiz et al., 2018a; Fernndez et al., 2019b), for instance, one or two representative
days with hourly time steps. Nevertheless, studies suggest that a one year with hourly time
step simulation is crucial to evaluate the operation of a renewable power plant under variable
energy sources, to consider daily and seasonal variability of the renewable resource (Ortiz et al.,
2018a). According to Renaldi and Friedrich (2017), to define the best operational strategy for
a renewable energy system integrated with energy storage, an optimisation study is required;
however, the storage system increase the complexity of the problem. Several studies exploit
synergies between expensive and dispatchable power plants, such as CSP with TES, integrated
with affordable and intermittent renewable technologies (Petrollese and Cocco, 2016). These
studies, based on the application of optimisation techniques, focus on the development of
operational strategies that minimise or maximise different performance metrics as objective
functions.
Nevertheless, to design a dispatchable and also affordable energy system, the optimal design
of its components is required. On the one hand, if one component is undersized, there will be
a bottleneck in the operation, that results in a reduction in the efficiency of the whole process.
On the other hand, the oversizing of a component will result in an unnecessary high investment
cost, increasing the investment costs as well as the levelised cost of each energy unit produced
during the lifetime of the power plant.
2.4 Optimisation of energy systems
The use of optimisation techniques has become an essential tool to find the best possible
decision or a range of solutions for an engineering problem. The formulation of an optimisation
problem requires an appropriate definition of system boundaries, decision variables, system
constraints and objective functions (Dincer et al., 2017). Modelling and simulation techniques
are usually studied and applied in engineering to get relevant information about the behaviour
of real problems and applications. Models are developed by mathematical formulation, identi-
fying physical laws and principles, and considering assumptions and approximations (Dincer
2.4. Optimisation of energy systems 21
et al., 2017).
According to Frangopoulos et al. (2002), three conceptual levels apply to energy systems
optimisation:
 Synthesis optimisation, focusing on the optimal selection of components, processes or
equipment and their interconnections, which define the superstructure of the energy
system.
 Design optimisation, that focuses on the optimal design and specifications of the com-
ponents, i.e. sizes, capacities.
 Operational optimisation, which finds the best strategy to operate as well as process
parameters under specific requirements.
The optimisation problems analysed in this research consider that the superstructure is given in
each case. Here, the superstructure is defined according to current projects under development,
construction or operation. In some cases, the superstructure also considers the integration of
other technologies that have been proposed in the literature to exploit synergies, or to improve
the performance of existing renewable power plants. Hence, the two-stage multi-objective
optimisation framework developed and explained in Chapter 3, focuses on the simultaneous
optimisation of the design and operation of a given superstructure. Different configurations are
studied in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7. These superstructures are based on the integration of different
energy conversion and storage technologies into hybrid solar power plants composed of a solar
tower and a PV plant. The energy conversion and storage technologies integrated and studied
in this thesis are sensible heat TES, TCES, electrical batteries, fossil backup, heat integration,
and wind power plants.
Optimisation problems can be defined as single objective or multi-objective. In decision-making
processes, the analysis of multiple targets is essential to consider different approaches as well as
trade-offs between various criteria. According to Dincer et al. (2017), optimisation techniques
can be defined based on:
 the characteristics of the variables and objective functions, e.g. linear, integer, quadratic,
non-linear, stochastic programming;
 the nature of the variables, e.g. deterministic, probabilistic; and
 the algorithm used to solve the optimisation problem, i.e. exact approaches (e.g. Branch
and Bound), approximation strategies (e.g. sequential algorithms, local algorithms, ran-
dom algorithms), and heuristic/metaheuristic approaches (e.g. evolutionary algorithms)
(Festa, 2014).
In an energy system optimisation, the problem can be solved sequentially or simultaneously.
While the sequential approach handles each level independently, simultaneous strategies opti-
mise all levels together, increasing the complexity by generating a large size non-linear prob-
lem. Different energy systems optimisation studies applied a simultaneous approach to solving
2.4. Optimisation of energy systems 22
a two-level optimisation problem using different techniques in each stage (Fazlollahi et al.,
2012).
In pursuance of reaching high dispatchability as well as low cost of energy generation, sev-
eral studies focusing on the implementation of CSP with TES in different areas have been
published in recent years. Some of them are focused on the optimisation of the design and its
operation through various approaches, e.g. linear programming, neural networks, evolutionary
algorithms, non-linear modelling. For instance, to optimise the design of a solar power plant by
sizing its elements, Kalogirou (2004) employs artificial neural networks and a genetic algorithm
approach to maximise the financial performance of the project.
In other study, Amusat et al. (2016) evaluated the capacity to supply electricity and heat in an
off-grid scheme for a large scale copper mine, Collahuasi, one of the largest copper mines
located in Chile (Mining Council Chile, 2015). This research was focused in the optimal
selection of the best technology of a hybrid solar power plant (CSP and PV) with energy
storage (pumped hydro energy storage, advanced adiabatic compressed air storage, and TES),
minimising the investment cost of the complete system to ensure the supply of energy.
A multi-objective approach for the optimal size of a hybrid CSP-PV power plant integrated
with TES has been implemented by Starke et al. (2018). In this study, the design optimisation
focusing on the analysis of the trade-off between costs and capacity factor is developed by
a genetic algorithm coupled with a surrogate model for each objective function. To built the
surrogate model, an annual simulation of the operation estimates the thermal and economic
performance of each power plant by a transient model.
2.5 Knowledge gaps
Previous studies do not exploit the synergies of large scale hybrid renewable power plant
systems by simultaneously optimising financial and technical performance in both the design
and the operational optimisation stages. While a small number of design variables enables the
use of multi-objective non-linear optimisation techniques, the operational optimisation requires
the use of linear programming methods. A large number of operational optimisation variables
for a yearly operation profile with an hourly resolution, makes the problem intractable with
optimisation methods for non-linear problems. However, the standard linear programming
methods are only capable of single-objective optimisation, and thus previous studies typically
consider a single objective. This research aims to fill this gap, by optimising at the same time
the design and operation of hybrid solar power plants composed of a CSP and a PV plant, and
the integration of other conversion and storage technologies, concerning multiple objectives.
In this thesis, a two-stage optimisation framework is developed to simultaneously optimise both
stages (i.e. the design and operation). The structure is defined as a multi-objective operational

optimisation by linear programming nested in the fitness evaluation of the multi-objective
design optimisation stage by an evolutionary algorithm. The results of both optimisation stages
are Pareto frontiers (multi-dimensional, depending on the number of objectives) which show
the trade-offs of different operation strategies and designs concerning technical, financial, and
environmental performance metrics of solar power plants.
A scalarisation method to find the best operational strategy considering hourly time steps and
one-year operation is designed to develop the multi-objective linear operation routine. The
operational optimisation by linear programming allows analysing a considerable time frame,
which is necessary to evaluate the long-term and seasonal behaviour of the system under
variable solar resource. For instance, one of the goals when finding the best operational strategy
of a renewable power plant is by maximising both the energy supplied and the dispatchability
under a specific commitment, two goals that during some periods of the year are conflicting
objectives. Consequently, a multi-objective optimisation technique to model a one-year hourly
operation strategy of a hybrid solar power plant with energy storage is one of the aims of the
present study. Here the capacity of linear programming to optimise the annual performance of
the power plant, taking into account the daily and seasonal variability of the solar resource is
exploited.
The parametric model developed in this study considers a typical meteorological year (TMY)
with an hourly resolution to represent the long term solar resource performance of the location
under consideration. According to Sengupta et al. (2015), designers and developers, to evaluate
the feasibility of a solar power plant project in a particular location, usually use the TMY, which
represents the condition of the site under analysis through an annual data set.
As indicated in Denholm et al. (2015a), the typical meteorological year (TMY) is used to esti-
mate the probable annual performance of a proposed solar power plant for a specific location.
The TMY data set provides 8760 hourly values detailing the meteorological conditions at a
particular place and is based on several years of meteorological data. TMY data sets represent
natural diurnal and seasonal variations of a year of typical climatic conditions. Hence, these
are not created to provide meteorological extremes. A TMY data set is essentially the 50th
percentile of the full distribution of probabilities, then, it is the best estimate and most probable
value. Other data set with more conservative estimations can also be created, such as P90.
This means that the real values can exceed the data set with 90% probability, giving more
confidence to investors that sufficient energy will be generated, allowing reduce financial risks
of the project.

The design and operational optimisation of a renewable power plant integrated with energy
storage, suggests that a multi-objective optimisation routine is crucial to estimate and analyse
the trade-off between technical and financial performance to design an affordable and dispatch-
able power plant. Moreover, the direct link between the objectives of the design and operational
optimisation routines is required to exploit the synergies of technology integration.
Throughout the thesis, the framework will be applied to different superstructures and used
to design hybrid solar power plants for locations which have different solar resource profiles
covering the feasible conditions for solar power plants. Hence, to analyse projects under de-
velopment, and potential sites for further deployment of solar plants with energy storage, the
following locations will be evaluated: Seville, Spain; Nevada, United States; and the Atacama
Desert, Chile, where each location under study requires a bespoke design due to the complex
interactions between the different parts of the system and the differences in solar resource
profile. Finally, the results are used to develop guidelines for the optimal design of dispatchable
solar power plants for locations with an excellent solar resource.
Chapter 3
Two-stage Design and Operational
Optimisation Framework
The operation of renewable power plants integrated with energy storage leads to complex inter-
actions between the different components and the intermittent resource, requiring sophisticated
techniques to achieve high dispatchability and low cost simultaneously. Besides, the optimal
design of these power plants requires the use of multi-objective optimisation tools to handle the
trade-off between technical and financial performance (Tezer et al., 2017). On the one hand,
due to the variability of the renewable resource, these optimisation problems have to consider
a more significant number of parameters compared with conventional power plants. On the
other hand, the integration of energy storage, that allows to change the temporal consumption
of energy, requires that the operation of every design has to be optimised in order to find the
best operational strategy to accomplish different requirements. Hence, the optimal design of a
hybrid renewable power plant with energy storage has to focus on both the optimisation of the
size of the power plant (design) and the best strategy to operate (operation). In this chapter, a
two-stage multi-objective optimisation problem is proposed and developed to simultaneously
solve these problems. Here, the first stage of the framework corresponds to the operational
optimisation, while the second stage to the design optimisation.
3.1 Overview
In this study, a hybrid solar power plant composed of two different solar technologies: a
concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, and a photovoltaic power (PV) plant will be anal-
ysed. Currently, PV is the most cost-competitive technology to provide intermittent renewable
energy, while CSP integrated with thermal energy storage can provide dispatchable energy
but at higher costs (Liu et al., 2016; SolarPACES, 2018; Maximov et al., 2019; Peng et al.,
2017). Furthermore, the integration of a fossil backup unit into a CSP plant allows continuous
operation even during long periods with no solar irradiation. However, this depends on the sizes
of the fossil backup unit and the energy storage system.
3.1. Overview 26
The purpose of integrating different technologies is to exploit synergies by the combination
of them, in this case, the affordability of PV and the dispatchability of CSP with energy
storage. Moreover, it is possible to evaluate the value of flexibility by giving some degrees
of freedom to the operation of renewable power plants. In this research, we study different
flexibility options. One option is that the system does not need to fulfil all its commitment in
every single time step; in other words, a mismatch between supply and demand is allowed.
Another option analysed in this study, when looking for an optimal transition to a sustainable
energy system, is the integration of a small fossil backup unit. In that case, the power plant
can emit greenhouse gases, that makes the system not entirely renewable and sustainable, but
this flexibility improves both technical and financial performance. Each option will be studied
in this research under a proper definition of the variables, constraints and objectives of the
optimisation.
The optimal design of an affordable and dispatchable renewable power plant has to examine
and analyse its financial and technical performance carefully. For instance, to absorb some
level of fluctuations, some power plants are oversized. This method is an excellent way to
improve the ability to supply energy when it is needed (dispatchability), but in those cases,
financial performance is negatively affected. On the contrary, if one of the main components is
undersized, it produces a bottleneck that decreases the technical performance of the operation.
Hence, the right selection of the size of the components is vital for an optimal design.
The analysis of the financial performance of a power plant is based on investment costs, as well
as operational and maintenance costs. When comparing with other technologies, the Levelised
Cost of Energy (LCOE) is a crucial indicator. The LCOE represents the present value of the
total life cycle costs involved in the generation of each unit of energy during the lifetime of
the power plant, according to equation 3.1 (Short et al., 1995). Here Ct is the cost in year t
(i.e. initial capital investment, annual operational and maintenance costs), and Et is the energy
dispatched in year t. Typical values for the annual interest rate and lifetime of r=7% and T=25
years, respectively, are used to be able to compare with other technologies and reports (IEA
et al., 2015).
LCOE =
(1+r)t
(1+r)t
(3.1)
In this study, the technical performance is measured by the dispatchability and greenhouse gas
emissions (in the case that the power plant is integrated with a fossil backup unit). In order
to measure the dispatchability of a renewable power plant with energy storage, its operation
has to be strategically defined according to the supply commitment. Renewable resources are
intermittent as well as could be the demand. Nevertheless, supply and demand should match
in each time step. Hence, the best operational strategy has to handle the complex interactions
between a renewable supply, energy storage, and commitment that change every time-step.
3.1. Overview 27
In the next sections, the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework is described. First,
a fundamental background of energy system analysis is given in Section 3.2. Then, Section
3.3 exposes the simulation of the hybrid solar power plant based on the analysis previously
detailed. Section 3.4 exposes the integration of thermal energy storage in the model. After that,
the operational modelling and optimisation is explained, and an efficient method is exposed to
deal with multi-objective linear programming in Section 3.5. Finally, Section 3.6 will focus on
the multi-objective optimisation of the design of the power plant by genetic algorithms.
3.2 Fundamentals of energy system analysis
The operational modelling is performed by the simulation of energy conversion processes and
energy and mass transfers for each process. Then, the operational optimisation will focus on
objectives that enhance its performance from a holistic point of view.
The operation of the power plant is based on the fundamental study of thermodynamics. This
section is a general analysis of the complete process based on the study of thermodynamics
as presented in Cengel and Boles (2015) and lecture notes from the course Analysing Energy
Systems of the Master in Energy Systems at the University of Melbourne (Webley, 2014). The
study of thermodynamics allows us to analyse each process behind the conversion and energy
transfers between different systems and technologies.
In the analysis of energy systems, the following statements for the conservation of matter (m)
and energy (E), represent the balances of energy and mass entering and leaving a system:
minmout = msystem (3.2)
EinEout = Esystem (3.3)
Steady-flow conditions (i.e. the properties of the fluid at any fixed point do not change over
time) are a very close approximation to model continuous operation devices like turbines,
pumps, heat exchangers, power plants (Cengel and Boles, 2015). In the case of cyclic devices
(e.g. compressors), steady-flow conditions can be applied using time-averaged values for the
thermodynamic properties of the flow (Cengel and Boles, 2015). In modelling the operation of
process units, i.e. systems defined by a control volume, in which mass can cross its boundaries
(Dincer et al., 2017), the present study considers hourly time-steps. Nevertheless, according
the requirements of the problem under study, the code and algorithm developed in this research
allow the analysis of different time-steps. Hence, each time-step (1 hour) will be simulated as
a steady-flow process.
For a flowing fluid entering or leaving a control volume, the total energy ( ) on a unit-mass
basis is defined by the sum of the flow energy (P ), the internal energy (u), the kinetic energy
3.2. Fundamentals of energy system analysis 28
(ke) and the potential energy (g  z), according to:
 = P  +u+ ke+ pe = P  +u+
+g  z (3.4)
where P is the pressure,  is the specific volume, V is the velocity, g is the acceleration of
gravity, and z correspond to the elevation relative to a reference point. The terms: (i) work
associated with a flowing fluid (P  ) and (ii) internal energy, are combined in a property
defined as enthalpy (h):
h = P  +u (3.5)
In order to measure the enthalpy of a flowing fluid, the difference in enthalpy between the
actual state and a reference state is used, this because it is not possible to calculate or measure
absolute values for enthalpy. Hence, the enthalpy is defined as a function of the pressure and
the temperature of the component. Besides, the specific heat at constant pressure, cp is defined
as the change in enthalpy of a substance per unit change in temperature at constant pressure.
Then, the change in the enthalpy can be determined by:
h = h2h1 =
cp dT (3.6)
As mentioned in Chapter 2, three different alternatives exist when working with thermal energy
storage systems: latent heat, sensible heat, and thermochemical reaction. While latent heat
is associated with a phase change (e.g. from gas to liquid), sensible heat is related with a
temperature change of the material. When evaluating the difference in enthalpy between two
stages, the analysis has to consider that cp changes with temperature, and it is discontinuous at
a phase change. Hence, the enthalpy of phase change has to be considered. Finally, to analyse
a thermochemical reaction, the enthalpy of reaction is employed.
Now, the energy balance in a control volume involving a fluid stream, and the interaction with
heat and work can be defined by:
Accumulation = InputOutput+GenerationConsumption (3.7)
In this equation, accumulation is associated with the change in the energy within the boundaries
of the system (e.g. energy storage tanks). Input and output energy are associated with: (i) energy
accompanying a mass flow (internal, kinetic and potential energy); (ii) work associated with the
mass flow (P); (iii) work exchange (Ws) between the system and its surroundings (e.g. shaft
work by a compressor); and (iv) heat transfer (Q) produced by a difference in temperature.
Finally, the generation and consumption of energy are different from zero when a chemical or
3.2. Fundamentals of energy system analysis 29
nuclear reaction occurs. Therefore, the general energy balance equation can be defined by:
E2E1 =
+ zi g
+mi  (P V )i
+Q+Ws
(3.8)
+ zi g
+mi  (P V )i
+Q+Ws
(3.9)
In most of the cases when working with a fluid stream, the kinetic and potential energies are
negligible (compared with the enthalpy), and when considering net quantities for Q and Ws (i.e.
Q = QinQout , and Ws =Ws,inWs,out , the last equation can be simplified to:
E = 
input
(m h)i 
output
(m h)i +Q+Ws (3.10)
For steady-flow systems (e.g. turbines, compressors, heat exchangers, coolers, reactors), the
accumulation of mass and energy in the control volume per unit of time (i.e. m and E) must be
equal zero, hence the mass and energy balances are given by:
 min =  mout (3.11)[
mi hi
+ Q+Ws
mi hi
+ Q+Ws
(3.12)
In this research, two of the main components of the thermochemical energy storage system
are chemical reactors, detailed in Sections 3.4.2. These process units (calciner and carbonator),
allow us to absorb/release heat by driving an endothermic/exothermic reaction, respectively.
When modelling chemical reactors, in order to include the enthalpy of reaction, the energy
balance equation can be written as:
E = [{mi hi}+hr]+Q+Ws (3.13)
where hr is the enthalpy of reaction, defined as the difference between the enthalpy of the
products and reactants (both at the same state, i.e. pressure and temperature) for a complete
reaction. The enthalpy of reaction is evaluated at standard conditions. According to equation
3.13, hr is negative for exothermic reactions (release of energy) and positive for endothermic
reactions (absorption of energy). Moreover, the standard heat of reaction (hr ) is specified
considering that all reactants and products are at 298 K (25 C) and 101.3 kPa (1 atm).
The following section describes the mass and energy balances used in the model for the opera-
tion of the main processes of the CSP plant with energy storage. The main components of the
CSP plant are the solar field (heliostats), solar tower, and receiver. In the case of the sensible
heat thermal energy storage system (i.e. molten salt), the principal components are the storage
tanks, heat exchangers and power block. Finally, the thermochemical energy storage system
3.2. Fundamentals of energy system analysis 30
(i.e. calcium-looping) is composed of reactors (carbonator and calciner), heat exchangers,
coolers, compressors, turbines, solids storage tanks, and gas storage vessels.
3.3 Hybrid solar power plant
The present research focuses on the design of power plants that provide dispatchable and
affordable clean power. This is achieved by integrating a dispatchable but expensive technology
(i.e. CSP with energy storage), with a non-dispatchable but relatively low-cost technology
(solar PV). Hence, the optimisation handles technical and economic performance to design a
dispatchable and cost-competitive power plant, exploiting synergies of technology integration.
While the PV power plant does not directly interact with the energy storage system of the
CSP, the net power dispatched from the hybrid plant to the grid is the result of the power
generation from the CSP with energy storage plus the generation from the PV plant minus all
own consumption of the hybrid power plant, i.e.:
PNeti = P

3.3.1 Concentrating solar power plant
The concentrating solar power (CSP) plant studied here is a solar tower. The energy conversion
in a solar tower begins in the solar field, where a large number of strategically located heliostats
(tracking mirrors) concentrate the solar irradiation into a receiver chamber located on the top
of a tower. The heat flow transferred and used in the receiver at each time step (QReceiveri , kW)
can be calculated using the following equation:
QReceiveri = DNIi 
opt,s f
receiver ACSP QCSP,Curtailmenti (3.15)
where: (i) DNIi is the direct normal irradiation (kWm2); (ii) 
opt,s f
i is the optical efficiency
of the solar field that varies every time-step in the model and depends on the relative position
between the sun, the heliostats, and the tower, including losses related to blocking, soiling,
reflectance, attenuation, interception and cosine effect (NREL, 2018); (iii) receiver is the effi-
ciency of the receiver, which is assumed in this work as 0.85 (NREL, 2018); (iv) ACSP is the
effective area covered by the heliostats (m2); and (v) the curtailment (QCSP,Curtailmenti , kW) is
the thermal power that has to be curtailed when the power cycle is running at full capacity and
the storage system is fully charged. Table 3.1 shows the description, nomenclature and units of
the variables and parameters used in the model of a CSP plant.

3.3.2 Photovoltaic power plant
The photovoltaic (PV) power plant directly produces electricity during sunshine hours. Here the
use of mono-crystalline silicon modules is considered, as well as 61 kWac inverters (NREL,
2018). Table 3.2 shows the characteristics of the modules and inverters used in the analysis
(NREL, 2018).

The power generation from a photovoltaic solar field (PPVi , kW ) can be estimated by:

where: (i) GT Ii is the global tilted irradiation, i.e. the sum of the direct and diffuse irradiation
in an inclined plane (in this study the slope is approximated to the latitude of the place in
order to maximise the annual power supply); (ii) Subarray is the sub-array efficiency that varies
every time-step and depends on the characteristics of the modules and the solar irradiation;
(iii) DC considers the efficiency of the direct current circuits (DC = 95.5%), here the losses
are related with module mismatch, connections, and DC wiring (NREL, 2018); (iv) AC =
99% is associated with alternate current wiring losses; (v) APV is the total area covered by the
photovoltaic modules (m2); and (vi) PPV,Curtailmenti is the power that has to be curtailed when
there is a constraint in the power dispatched due to the capacity of the transmission network.

3.4 Hybrid solar power plant integrated with thermal energy stor-
age system
3.4.1 Hybrid solar power plant with sensible heat thermal energy storage
The basic structure of a CSP plant integrated with a two-tank molten salt process as a sensible
heat thermal energy storage system is shown in Figure 3.1. The intention here is to show a
general methodology, which can be modified and used to model different configurations and
to estimate the performances of a hybrid solar power plant integrated with an energy storage
system under different conditions. In this system, the material (molten salt) is in a liquid state
during the complete operation cycle. Hence, the thermal energy from the solar field is used
to increase its temperature (sensible heat). Then, the hot stream can be used directly as a
heat injection in a Rankine cycle trough heat exchangers to produce steam and then electrical
power by a turbine and generator. Alternatively, the hot stream can be stored in the hot tank
and used afterwards in the same thermodynamic cycle described before (Rankine cycle). The
thermodynamic properties of the molten salt (related to the heat transferred in the receiver)
can be calculated by using the specific heat of the storage material (cp), according to equation
3.6. The main properties of a typical molten salt used in CSP plants are shown in table 3.4
(Peir et al., 2017). According to Ushak and Grageda (2015), some features of molten salts
that make them useful for CSP plants are: a broad range of working temperature, thermal
stability, low viscosity, low corrosion rates, high heat capacity per unit of volume, and low
production costs. The mass and energy balances for each process can be estimated by applying
the thermodynamic analysis described previously.

heat thermal energy storage system
Previously, it was estimated that the thermal energy captured by the receiver is:
QReceiveri = DNIi 
opt,s f
receiver ACSP QCSP,Curtailmenti
Then, this heat is used to increase the temperature of the molten salt according to:
QReceiveri = mi 
cp dT (3.17)
In this case, there is a non-linear expression that combines the heat available in the receiver
with the energy absorbed by the molten salt as a function of the mass flow rate, the inlet
and outlet temperature of the material, and its heat capacity. A power flow model will be
employed to linearise the system. This simplified model is shown in Figure 3.2. Here the
system is divided into four main components: (i) CSP, the solar field area which represents
the effective area of heliostats ACSP, m2; (ii) TES, the thermal energy storage system, with a
capacity QT ES,Max, MWh; (iii) Power Block, involving the whole Rankine cycle to generate
power from heat, where the capacity of the steam turbine generator block is PPB,Max, MW; and
(iv) PV, the solar photovoltaic plant, including the total area covered by the PV modules, APV ,
m2 and the inverters. The input data required here correspond to efficiencies of each process,
thermal efficiencies of pipelines, and efficiencies of electrical circuits. To get an estimation
of the efficiencies between each component, the System Advisor Model (NREL, 2018) was
used to model different power plants under different conditions. The values calculated will be
exposed in each application that will be studied in detail in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7.
The linear equations that model the system are shown in Figure 3.2 where the sub-index i
denoted the time steps, in this case with hourly resolution. Besides, these equations are outlined
below:

energy transferred by the molten salts in the heat exchangers to produce superheated steam
and the conversion to electricity in the turbine-generator unit. Then, the net power dispatched
from the hybrid power plant will be supplied to satisfy the commitment, and any surplus will be
dispatched to the network (if possible according to the transmission constraint PTransmission,Max).
In order to evaluate the dispatchability of the power plant, the mismatch between the supply
and a given commitment will be calculated by using the loss of power supply (LPS). The LPS is
defined as 0 when generation exceeds demand, and by the difference between the commitment
that should be dispatched in period i (PCommitmenti ) and the power supplied in the same period
(PNeti ) when commitment exceeds generation. In other words, LPS measures the ability to
supply energy when it is needed (dispatchability), according to:

3.4.2 Hybrid solar power plant with thermochemical energy storage
Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) systems operate with a reversible chemical reaction,
allowing to control the absorption and release of energy. Different TCES systems integrated
with CSP plants are summarised by Pardo et al. (2014). While some TCES systems work at
high temperature, hence, high efficiency when integrated into CSP plants (e.g. calcite calcina-
tion/carbonation) (Mller et al., 2011), other processes work at lower temperature and are more
suitable for industrial waste heat applications (e.g. magnesium oxide, 350 to 400 C) (Knoll
et al., 2019). A reversible process that has received significant attention for the implementation
into CSP plants is the calcination/carbonation of calcite, with a working temperature in the
range of 700 - 1000 C (Pardo et al., 2014; Chacartegui et al., 2016).
This process, knows as calcium-looping (CaL), involves calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium
oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The CaL process has important advantages that make
it an attractive and promising technology as a TCES system (Pardo et al., 2014; Ortiz et al.,
2019a; Criado et al., 2017; Bui et al., 2018). For instance, the abundance and low price of the
precursor materials (i.e. limestone or dolomite), the properties of the products (non-corrosive,
non-toxic) (Mller et al., 2011; Bui et al., 2018), and its theoretical high energy density (4.4 GJ
m3) (Gil et al., 2010). Current studies focus on the development of improved materials and
process conditions to decrease the deactivation due to the multi-cyclic operation requirements
(Obermeier et al., 2017; Snchez Jimnez et al., 2019). Moreover, the high-temperature en-
ergy released in the CaL process allows the integration of high-efficiency power cycles (Ortiz
et al., 2017). Therefore, the CaL process integrated into CSP plants has the potential to supply
dispatchable and affordable power.
3.4. Hybrid solar power plant integrated with thermal energy storage system 36
Figure 3.3 shows the mass and energy flow diagram of hybrid CSP-PV plant integrated with
CaL. The figure illustrates with different colours three operational modes (day, night and 24 h);
with solid colour lines the solar irradiation, heat and electrical power; with dashed, solid, and
dash-dotted line styles the streams of CaCO3+CaO, CaO and CO2 respectively; and with a long
dashed line the steam of the Rankine cycle. During sunshine hours, illustrated by blue lines in
the diagram, the solar irradiation from the CSP is concentrated and used as a heat input at the
receiver to carry out the calcination of CaCO3 (solid) to CaO (solid) and CO2 (gas) (Ortiz et al.,
2018a). Short residence times and complete calcination are considered in this research when the
reaction takes place at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of around 900 C (Obermeier
et al., 2017; Hanak et al., 2015). CaO and CO2 streams at high temperature (900 C) leave the
calciner to be stored in different tanks at ground level. Conveyors, equipped with lock hoppers
to balance the pressure differences, are used to transport the CaO from the calciner to the CaO
storage tank. This insulated tank works at high temperature and atmospheric pressure. The
CO2 stream is stored in a high-pressure tank at atmospheric temperature (CO2 vessel) by using
compressors and heat exchangers. To increase the efficiency of the power plant, part of the
heat released by the CO2 before compression is used as a heat input in a small-size Rankine
cycle. When energy is needed, the carbonator drives the exothermic reaction, which releases
heat by mixing CaO and CO2, generating CaCO3. While the CaO comes from the CaO storage
tank, the CO2 fed to the carbonator has two possibilities: (i) from the calciner during sunshine
hours; (ii) from the CO2 vessel during night operation, as shown with green lines in the figure.
The carbonator works at 3 bar, and a CaO molar conversion of X = 0.15 is assumed (Ortiz
et al., 2019a). The heat released during the reaction is used to increase the temperature of the
CO2 stream (here well in excess), and then, this stream runs a gas turbine. After that, heat
exchangers are used as a regenerative system to increase the efficiency of the process. The
cyclic calcination-carbonation of calcium carbonate and calcium oxide is given by equation
3.31.

where Hr is the enthalpy of reaction, here in units kJmol1, defined previously as the differ-
ence between the enthalpy of the products and reactants (both at the same state, i.e. pressure
and temperature) for a complete reaction.

Calciner
The endothermic calcination reaction occurs within the calciner, which in this case coincides
with the receiver chamber located at the top of the tower, i.e. QReceiveri = Q
Calciner
i . In this
reactor, the inlet stream, which contains calcium carbonate and calcium oxide, is heated to
drive the calcination. Main properties for CaCO3, CaO and CO2 are summarised in table
3.5, based on Jaffe and Washington (2018) and Perry et al. (1997). As previously indicated,
complete calcination is assumed (Obermeier et al., 2017). As shown in Figure 3.4, there is no
accumulation of energy in the system, nor shaft work, then all the heat from the solar field is
used to heat the input stream and complete the reaction, according to:
QCalcineri = (mk,i  hk,i)+hr,i (3.32)
with,
(mk,i  hk,i) = mg1,i  hg1,i + mc1,i  hc1,i ms1,i  hs1,i (3.33)
hr,i = ms1,i Hr (3.34)
where m is the molar flow rate, h is the enthalpy, and the subscripts correspond to the streams of
CaCO3+CaO, CaO and CO2 (s1, c1, g1 respectively), as shown in Figure 3.3. In the calcination
process, the molar flow rate of CO2 (stream g1) is equal to the molar flow rate of CO2 produced
in the reaction, and the CaO molar flow rate (stream c1) is equal to the molar flow rate of CaO
in stream s1 plus the molar flow rate of CaO produced in the reaction.

Heat exchangers, and coolers:
In a heat exchanger (Figure 3.5), there is no energy accumulation (E = 0), no shaft work
(Ws = 0) and if considered as adiabatic (Q = 0), the mass and energy balance equations that
represent the amount of heat transferred from the hot fluid (h) to the cold fluid (c) for each time
step (i), are (Dincer et al., 2017):

(m h)i (3.37)

Coolers are modelled similarly to heat exchangers (no energy accumulation, no shaft work,
adiabatic), the difference here is that the working fluid cools (h) while a refrigerant (r) is heating
(air or water are typically used). The energy balance for coolers is described as:
mr,i  cpr Tr,i = mhin,i  (hhout ,ihhin,i) (3.39)
3.4. Hybrid solar power plant integrated with thermal energy storage system 40
where cpr is the specific heat capacity of the refrigerant, e.g. cp,air (23 C,41% rel. humidity) = 1.012
kJ kg1K1 (Jaffe and Washington, 2018)
Superheated steam Rankine cycle:
The turbine power output (ST) of the Rankine cycle is simulated as a linear relation with the
heat absorbed in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) according to:
PSTi = Q
SSRC (3.40)
where SSRC is the global efficiency from thermal to electrical power. Based on the model and
results published by Ortiz et al. (2018a), estimated by using the commercial software ASPEN
PLUS, an efficiency SSRC = 0.268 will be considered in this study.

3.4. Hybrid solar power plant integrated with thermal energy storage system 41
Carbonator:
In the carbonator, the reverse reaction of the calciner occurs. In this reactor, pure CaO from the
CaO storage tank is combined with CO2 from the CO2 storage cycle to produce CaCO3 and
heat (with a molar conversion of 15%). After the carbonator, while the resulting solid stream
(CaCO3+CaO) is stored in the solid storage tank, the CO2 stream (presented here in excess to
absorb the heat released in the reaction) is first conducted to a turbine to produce electricity,
after that to a heat exchanger to use part of the heat available in a regenerative system, and
finally to a cooler and compressor to close the cycle.
Figure 3.7: Mass and energy balances model of Carbonator (calcium-looping TCES system)
Storage tanks:
The three storage tanks, i.e. CaO storage tank, CaCO3+CaO storage tank, and CO2 storage
vessel, are modelled by mass balances. In the CaO and CaCO3+CaO tanks, the density under
storage conditions considers internal porosity and particle packing density of the material, as
described in Ortiz et al. (2018a). Here the state of charge (SoCi in m3) is defined as the volume
of material that is presented in the tank in period i, which is equal to the state of charge of
the previous period plus the input minus the output flows during the current period (in m3),
according to the following expressions:
SoCi(m
SoCi=0(%) STO
capacity(m3), if i = 0
SoCi1 +(min mout) t  1i , i 1
(3.43)
3.4. Hybrid solar power plant integrated with thermal energy storage system 42
In this model, the state of charge (in percentage) for each tank at the start of the operation (i=0)
is defined as:
SoCi=0 =

100% CaO tank
0% CaO+CaCO3 tank
100% CO2 vessel
(3.44)
This means that during the operation of the first hours, the storage tanks of the thermochemical
energy storage system are fully charged, which allows the power plant to dispatch energy even
without solar irradiation. This is just a criterion for the simulations, which has insignificant
influence in the yearly results. However, in the operational optimisation routine, to calculate
the actual net energy dispatched, it is necessary to estimate the difference between the available
energy in the initial and final periods of the annual operation. To estimate this value, an average
energy density factor ( ) is calculated as the rate between net power dispatched and the mass
flow rate of CaO that feeds the carbonator:
tonCaO
Pneti (MW )
mc2(
kgCaO
s ) 3600(

(3.45)
The results of the model were analysed for one year to estimate this rate and a specific power
production value of i  0.053 MWhton1CaO was calculated.
3.5 Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear program-
This section presents a multi-objective linear scalarisation method to optimise the operation
of the power plant considering hourly time steps and one-year operation. This technique al-
lows analysing a large time frame, which is necessary to evaluate the long-term and seasonal
behaviour of the system under variable solar resource.
In addition, multi-objective optimisation techniques allow to handle different objective simul-
taneously. For instance, as shown in Figure 3.8, the multi-objective optimisation allows to
maximise the energy dispatched while maximising the dispatchability, which is not possible
to perform by a single objective optimisation. Figure 3.8 shows an example of single and
multi-objective optimisation considering the maximisation of the energy dispatched and the
minimisation of the loss of power supply. In a single-objective optimisation the objective
reaches the best value while degrading other competing key performance indicators. By a
multi-objective optimisation a set of non-dominated solutions that simultaneously optimise
both objectives is achieved (Pareto optimal solutions).
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 43
Figure 3.8: Comparison between single and multi-objective optimisation
3.5.1 Linear programming modelling
The main objective of the operational optimisation is to find the best strategy to operate taking
into account the daily and seasonal variability of the solar resource. Hence, the model needs
to analyse one year of operation (8760 time steps), considering the hourly solar resource of
a typical meteorological year. The simplification of this complex problem by using linear
programming allows us to run the model with high speed and to analyse a power plant with
energy storage under a long term evaluation. There are two simplifications that will be devel-
oped throughout this research to simplify the system by a linear programming model. The first
approximation will be applied to the model of a hybrid solar power plant with molten salt as a
sensible heat thermal energy storage system. In this case, the system is modelled as power flows
between the main components, considering efficiencies of power plants in operation found in
the literature, e.g. SolarPACES (2018).
The second approximation by linear programming will be elaborated in the integration of a
thermochemical energy storage system. In this case, the model will be developed using the non-
linear equations presented previously. Then, the temperatures of the processes will be fixed,
according to the results presented in current non-linear models developed with commercial
software, e.g. the results presented by Ortiz et al. (2018a) in which the authors simulate the
operation of a CSP plant with calcium-looping under different solar irradiation levels. In a real
power plant, this may be achievable by the instrumentation engineering, through the definition
and control of the temperatures of each process. Hence, the operational optimisation stage
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 44
optimises the mass flow rate of some streams and calculate those that are dependent (because
there are direct relationships between some streams) in order to optimise the hourly operation.
3.5.2 Variables
Depending on the model used to approximate the problem by linear programming, in the
operational optimisation routine, the variables are defined as power flow or mass flow rates
between each subsystem. According to the equations previously detailed to analyse energy
conversion and storage systems, some of the variables defined are independent, and they will
be optimised. In contrast, other variables will be calculated by energy balances and the capacity
of the components as constraints.
3.5.3 Input parameters
According to the equations previously described, that are used to simulate each process, the
input parameters required are:
1. Direct normal irradiation (DNIi).
2. Global tilted irradiation (GT Ii).
3. Demand that the power plants should dispatch: PCommitmenti .
4. Efficiencies (process, pipelines, circuits, etc.).
5. Operational and network constraints (e.g., capacity of the transmission network).
6. Financial parameters (investment costs, operational and maintenance costs).
Here the DNI is the solar irradiation captured by the heliostats of the CSP that track the sun.
The GTI is the irradiation in a fixed plane, converted into electricity by the PV plant in which
each PV module is non-tracking. The demand that the power plant should dispatch is used in
the optimisation to estimate its dispatchability.
3.5.4 Objectives
The objectives defined in the model depend on the target pursued by the user. For instance,
the objectives can be focused just on a financial perspective by selling the maximum quantity
of energy, thus, reaching the lowest LCOE. Alternatively, in the case that the user is a large
consumer, its objectives might be focused on both financial and technical performance (relia-
bility). Nevertheless, these objectives should be different for grid connected or off-grid power
plants. Finally, the electricity market operator should be focused on both, a low price of the
electricity, as well as a firm electricity supply, which can be evaluated through the mismatch
between supply and demand.
Hence, depending on the user of the model, and the feature of the power plant, the objectives
can be related with financial, technical, environmental, or societal performance. The flexibility
of the model allows to include any objective or combination of them. The only requirement is
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 45
that the objectives have to be quantitative and related to the operation. The following are some
key performance indicators for technical and financial performance that can be analysed:
 Enet , is the total net electricity dispatched by the power plant in one year of operation.
ENet =
PNeti (3.46)
 PNet is the average power dispatched in one year, according to:
PNet =
8760 h
(3.47)
 PMax is the maximum power dispatched during at least one hour, over one year of
operation.
 ECommitment is the electricity dispatched to fulfil the commitment .
 EExcess is the electricity dispatched when the net energy exceeds the commitment.
 ECurtailed is the amount of thermal energy available in the heliostat solar field that has to
be curtailed when the power plant is running at full capacity and the storage system is
fully charged.
 E fi is the energy difference between the last hour and the first hour of operation. This
difference is used to calculate the net electricity dispatched during one year of operation.
 LPSC and LPSP (loss of power supply capacity and loss of power supply probability,
respectively), are used to estimate the total loss of power during one year of operation,
according to:
LPSC =
LPSi (3.48)
LPSP =
PCommitmenti 8760
(3.49)
 CFCSP is the capacity factor of the power cycle. For the CaL system, the CO2 Brayton
cycle is normally considered (Ortiz et al., 2019b).
Useful estimations of efficiencies are:
 CSP,Rec is the efficiency of the solar tower power plant considering the energy available
and used in the receiver:
CSP,Rec =
ENet,CSP
ETotal, receiver
(3.50)
 CSP,DNI is the overall efficiency of the solar power plant considering the solar energy
available in the solar field:
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 46
CSP,DNI =
ENet,CSP
ETotal, solar field
(3.51)
Finally, other indicators that can be useful depending on the case study are:
 Greenhouse gas emissions (total emissions), in the case that a fossil backup unit is used
as heat injection for the TES.
 Water consumption during the operation of the power plant (total consumption), that is
key in locations with restricted water availability.
Any of these key performance indicators, or the combination of them, can be defined as objec-
tives, for instance:
Max Enet (3.52)
Min LPSC (3.53)
Min GHG (3.54)
Min Qwater (3.55)
The operational optimisation developed in this model will focus on the first two objectives, i.e.
the maximisation of the energy supplied (to minimise the levelised cost of electricity) and the
minimisation of the loss of power supply (to maximise the dispatchability).
The use of linear programming ensures a proper approximation of the best operational strategy
for one year of operation, considering variable solar resource, in a reasonable computational
time. The operational optimisation routine analyses 8760 optimisation variables for each power
flow or mass flow rate in Figures 3.2 and 3.3. However, linear programming solvers can only
handle a single objective so that multiple objectives can only be added as a constraint or through
a weighting process.
3.5.5 Multi-objective linear optimisation
The multi-objective operation optimisation produces a range of Pareto optimal solutions, rep-
resenting the trade-off between objectives. Each point in the Pareto set is a non-dominated
solution or potential candidate. Hence, an a-posteriori analysis should be carried out to select
the best result under a trade-off between the objectives. Two techniques have been applied to
solve multi-objective optimisation problems in linear programming (Gebreslassie et al., 2009):
the weighted-sum or scalarisation method, and the -constraint method. These methods, which
are modelled and applied to the hybrid power plant, are described below.
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 47
Scalarisation method
In the scalarisation method, the multi-objective optimisation problem is transformed to a single
objective optimisation by combining and weighting both objectives (Nguyen et al., 2014). The
following function describes the new single objective optimisation problem:
maximise
{PNeti  LPSi} (3.56)
where the positive parameter  is the scaling factor applied to the second objective.
Epsilon constraint method
In the -constraint method, one objective is considered as a constraint in the formulation of the
optimisation problem (Fazlollahi et al., 2012), here the optimisation problem is formulated as:
maximise
PNeti (3.57)
subject to
LPSi  
An essential challenge of these methods is to define a suitable value of the scaling or constraint
parameters in order to get a proper solution. Figure 3.9 shows an example of the Pareto frontier
reached when working with both objectives. Points I1 and I2 are achieved when the optimisation
is done by single objectives, i.e. I1 corresponds to the Max Enet , and I2 when Min LPSC.
Then, the dashed line shows the Pareto frontier for both the linear scalarisation and the -
constraint methods, obtained by varying the scaling and constraint value, respectively. Because
the purpose of the model is focused on the design of an affordable and dispatchable power
plant, the objective of the operational optimisation will focus on the optimal combination of
both objectives. Thus, the target of the optimisation is to be in the top left of the figure. Both the
Max Enet and the Min LPSC methods do not reach this zone. On the contrary, the scalarisation
and the -constraint method, with a good definition of values of  and  , respectively, are
able to reach values close to this area (i.e. the zone highlighted with an ellipse). The main
difference between the scalarisation and the -constraint methods is that each iteration of the
scalarisation method takes a few seconds to calculate, compared with each iteration of the -
constraint method which takes almost 10 minutes to be processed. Hence, the scalarisation
method is analysed in detail, and is automated to ensure that an optimal value of  is chosen.
3.5. Multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming 48
Figure 3.9: Numerical example of single and multi-objective linear optimisation methods
applied in the operation of a hybrid solar power plant with thermal energy storage
Automated scalarisation method
In order to have an automated decision process to ensure that the solution of the operational
optimisation is in the desired zone, an automated scalarisation method was developed and
applied. This autonomous algorithm requires 7 iterations for the case with two objectives.
The first iteration is a single objective optimisation of Max Enet and it gives the point I1 =
(Emax,LPSCmax) in Figure 3.9. Then, the second iteration is a single objective optimisation
of Min LPSC which produces the point I2 = (Emin,LPSCmin). The purpose of these first two
iterations is to get an estimation of  and the line I1I2. Then, to standarise and give the same
relative weight to both objectives, an initial value of  is calculated by:
EmaxEmin
LPSCmaxLPSCmin
(3.58)
After that, 5 iterations are carried out to get an improved  ( =  0) which is used as input
to the automated selection. This last step, the automated selection can be modelled by different
methods depending on the purpose of the user. In this case, it is done by selecting the -value
for which the result (Ii = (Ei,LPSCi)) of the ith iteration is furthest from the line I1I2. This is
calculated by finding the maximum distance di which is the perpendicular line that connects Ii

3.6 Multi-objective design optimisation by genetic algorithms
As previously mentioned, in order to design an affordable and dispatchable solar power plant,
the trade-off between financial and technical performances has to be examined. While an
oversized CSP plant can give us full dispatchability at a high LCOE, a PV plant will be more
affordable, but not dispatchable. These conflicting objectives are handled by a multi-objective
optimisation method which produces a range of non-dominated or Pareto optimal solutions.
For optimal design of a hybrid power plant with energy storage, a two-stage optimisation
framework is proposed. This framework uses a genetic algorithm to optimise the design of
the power plant under techno-economic objectives. The use of genetic algorithms allows us
to handle non-convex objectives and several variables. Then, nested as a fitness function, the
operational optimisation stage is incorporated in the design optimisation routine.
This genetic algorithm process is shown in Figure 3.11, explaining a two-stage mathematical
optimisation model of the design by genetic algorithms and of the operation of the power plant
3.6. Multi-objective design optimisation by genetic algorithms 50
by linear programming. The optimisation starts generating a random population of a defined
number of individuals. This means that each individual is a solar power plant with a defined
size or capacities of components. After that, the algorithm finds the best operational strategy
during a one-year operation with hourly time-steps. The results of the operational optimisation
are all hourly power flows, and these are used to calculate crucial indicators that are employed
in the fitness evaluation. Then, the genetic algorithm defines the best offspring by crossing and
mutating the population in which power plants with better performance have higher chance to
evolve. Finally, the stopping criterion is defined by a given number of generations.

3.6.1 Variables
The design of the power plant is given by the size of the main components of each technology
considered, which are defined as variables in the design optimisation stage. Different configu-
rations integrating the technologies previously defined will be developed throughout the case

For instance, the design variables are shown in the red ovals in Figure 3.3. The combination of
these variables will result in a power plant with known capacities. Then, the initial investment
is calculated. Next, the operational optimisation by linear programming nested as a fitness
function in the genetic algorithm defines the best operational strategy, e.g. maximising the net
energy dispatched and minimising the mismatch between supply and commitment. Finally,
three indicators (detailed in section 3.6.3) are considered as objectives for the design optimisa-
tion stage and used by the genetic operators.
The integration of different technologies are analysed and presented as cases studies in the

3.6.2 Fitness evaluation
The multi-objective linear scalarisation model for the operational optimisation presented pre-
viously is nested here as a fitness evaluation, linking the objectives of both levels. The opera-
tional optimisation routine simultaneously optimises the objectives considered in the problem
(e.g. maximises the energy dispatched, minimises the mismatch between supply and demand,
minimises the greenhouse gas emissions). Hence, the operation of each design of the genetic
algorithm stage is optimised, considering one-year hourly solar irradiation.
3.6. Multi-objective design optimisation by genetic algorithms 53
3.6.3 Objectives
As stated previously, the design optimisation aims to select the optimal sizes of the components
to design an affordable and dispatchable power plant. In this study, the investment cost and
the LCOE are employed to measure the affordability. The LCOE is a crucial indicator that
represents the cost of each electricity unit generated over the lifetime of the power plant
considering the total life cycle costs, while the investment cost is essential when defining a
limiting initial budget for the feasibility of a project. In regard to the technical performance, the
loss of power supply capacity is used to measure the dispatchability, that is the quantification
of the mismatch between supply and the commitment. Besides, the emission of greenhouse
gases is considered as a technical objective in configurations that integrate a fossil backup unit
to increase the performance of the CSP plant. Hence, the objectives of the design optimisation
routine will be divided into financial and technical performance, according to:
 Financial performance:
 Total investment cost (MUSD)
 Levelised cost of electricity (USDMWh1)
 Technical performance:
 Loss of power supply probability (%)
 Greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2eq)
References and procedures to estimate total investment cost as well as operational and main-
tenance cost (used to calculate the LCOE), are summarised bellow. To convert estimated cost
from some references expressed in Euros, an average exchange rate of rexch = 1.18 (EUR to
USD, 2018) was considered here (Cherowbrier, 2019).
Investment costs: Concentrating solar power plant
The data required to estimate the investment cost of a concentrated solar power plant, i.e.
the heliostat field and the solar tower were obtained using the System Advisor Model (SAM)
(NREL, 2018). Here, the cost of the solar field (including the solar tower), in thousands of
USD, was estimated as a function of the heliostats field (ACSP, in m2).

Investment costs: Photovoltaic power plant
The investment and operational cost of the solar PV plant were obtained using the modelling
tools presented in SAM (NREL, 2018). The direct investment costs (direct costs) are calculated
by adding the direct cost of the PV modules, inverters, balance of system (BoS), installation
and contingency, according to:
ICdirect costs = ICPV modules + ICinverters + ICBoS + ICinstallation (3.65)
According SAM, these costs (in thousands of USD) can be approximated based on the capacity
of the PV plant (PV dc, in kWdc), according to:
ICPV modules = 0.35 PV dc (3.66)
ICinverters = 0.1 PV dc (3.67)
ICBoS = 0.3 PV dc (3.68)
ICinstallation = 0.84 PV dc (3.69)
In the case that the area of the PV plant is defined as a variable in the optimisation, the power
capacity of the PV plant (in kWdc) can be estimated using the data presented in Table 3.2 and
the following relations:
PV dc(kWdc) =
APV (m2) Pmax module(kWdc)
Amodule(m2)
(3.70)
If the power capacity of the PV plant (PV ac in kWac) is defined as a variable, the power capacity
in kWdc can be estimated by:
PV dc(kWdc) =
PV ac
PV DC to AC ratio
(3.71)
where the PV DC to AC ratio is defined in this study as 1.2 (NREL, 2018). Finally, the land use and
operational and maintenance cost are given by:

Investment costs: Molten salts sensible thermal energy storage system
 The investment cost, in thousands of USD, of the thermal energy storage system (two-
tanks molten salts), as a function of the capacity of storage (STOT ES, in MWht)) can be
estimated by (NREL, 2018):
ICT ES = 22 STOT ES (3.74)
 Then, the power block and balance of plant (BoP) costs (in thousands of USD), as a
function of the power block capacity (PST , in MW ) are defined by NREL (2018) as:
ICPB = 1040 PST (3.75)
ICBoP = 290 PST (3.76)
Investment costs: Calcium-looping thermochemical energy storage system
In the case of the CSP with TCES, the investment cost of the solar tower (in thousands of USD)
was incremented by 10% to consider the installation and connections of the calciner located
inside the receiver chamber.
ICheliostats field & tower = (0.175 ACSP +3460) 1.1 (3.77)
(3.78)
Other costs associated to the CSP plant are the same than described in the case of CSP with
TES (land use, water usage, and operational and maintenance costs). Then, the cost of the
thermochemical energy storage system is defined by the following components:
 Calciner, as a function of the thermal capacity of the reactor (Michalski et al., 2019):

 The investment cost of CO2 storage tank, is calculated by using the relations presented

the yield stress (Y). The material suggested by Bayon et al. (2018) is SSCrMo (chromium
molybdenum steel), with Y =962 MPa (Health and Safety Executive, 1992). Besides, E
is the joint efficiency defined as 0.9 by Bayon et al. (2018), and a safety factor of 1.5

2013).
 The solid-particle storage tank cost is estimated by using the relations presented by
Bayon et al. (2018). Here the total cost is the cost of the fire brick (brick), carbon steel

3.7. Implementation 58
3.7 Implementation
In summary, the number of variables of the design optimisation depends on the case study that
will be described in details in the next chapters. The genetic algorithm (GA) method will be
used to optimise the three objectives, producing several solutions in a three-dimensional space
which form a Pareto surface. As can be seen in Figure 3.11, GA starts with an initial population,
where each individual represents a power plant with given capacities. Then, each design in the
population is optimised by using the operational optimisation by linear programming to find
the best strategy to operate.
For the present research, a model written in Python was developed to optimise the design opti-
misation of the hybrid solar power plant with energy storage. DEAP (Distributed evolutionary
Algorithms in Python) was employed inside the code to carry out the genetic algorithm routine
(Fortin et al., 2012). Here, the fitness evaluation of each individual is performed by solving the
operational optimisation stage using Pyomo (Hart et al., 2017) with Gurobi as solver (Gurobi
Optimization, 2019). In addition, real solar irradiation data is used as input, and it can be easily
modified to evaluate any location. In summary, the hardware and software used to solve the
two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework presented in this chapter are reported below:
 PC: Intel Core i7-6700 CPU @ 3.4 GHz, 16 GB RAM.
 Operating system: 64-bits Windows 10 Education.
 Programming language: Python 3.5.3 (Python Software Foundation, 2017).
 Optimisation packages: Pyomo 5.6.1 (Hart et al., 2017, 2011), DEAP 1.3.0 (Fortin et al.,
2012)
 Solver: Gurobi 8.1.1 (Gurobi Optimization, 2019)
3.8 Uncertainties, model limitations and advantages
Simulations of the energy system presented in this research will unavoidably give forecasts
that deviate from a real operation. These differences result from the limitations of the model to
correctly simulate a real system. These uncertainties can be listed into three groups:
 Model uncertainty. When using mathematical approximations to simulate a system and
simplifications to make the problem flexible and tractable from a computational per-
spective. In this research, an example of a model error is the use of linear or bilinear
efficiencies in the power block, and not consider the turbine-generation operation under
full or part load.
 Numerical uncertainty. To solve the mathematical optimisations and simulations, the
equations were discretised and resolved in time steps. This approximation of a continu-
ous function using a discrete approximation can be improved by using higher resolutions
or time steps in the input data (e.g. 15 min instead of 60 min), which increase the
computational time.
3.8. Uncertainties, model limitations and advantages 59
 Data uncertainty. To evaluate the performance of the solar power plant integrated with
energy storage, different locations were considered. The mathematical model requires
input data such as solar irradiation, cost of components, technical parameters, etc. In
the present research, these parameters were collected using different sources such as
technical reports and scientific publications. Depending on the case study, difficulties
in the acquisition of such parameters can be found. For instance, information on the
technology readiness level in the location depends on the experience that a particu-
lar site has in developing such systems. In this context, Atacama-1 is the first large
scale concentrating solar power plant in South America; hence, the investment costs
and operational costs were difficult to estimate. The other essential input data that has
a considerable impact in the uncertainty of the results is the typical meteorological year
used to estimate the long-term operation of the solar plant. The typical meteorological
year (TMY) is highly accepted and used by the scientific community to assess a proposed
solar power plants probable annual performance for a specific location. TMY selects
individual historic months to represent climate conditions for a location. Nevertheless,
TMY usually exclude extreme conditions. In order to solve this problem, some re-
searchers suggest combining the use of the TMY to represent typical conditions with
an extreme meteorological year data set to capture a range of power plant performance.
A similar approach, by estimating the performance of a power plant during the 12 years
is shown in Figure 9. The details of this case study is included in section 5.3 in the thesis
document.
To evaluate these three types of uncertainty, sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the
power plants financial and technical performance indicators by changing the value of differ-
ent input parameters. In addition, long-time evaluations are performed to analyse worst-case
scenarios when analysing a small number of designs.
The main objective of this research is to optimise the annual performance of a hybrid solar
power plant with energy storage, taking into account the daily and seasonal variability of the
solar resource. Then, the model employed a typical meteorological year with hourly resolution
(8760 time steps). In the next sections, mass and energy balances are modelled by using
non-linear equations. Nevertheless, the computational cost by using non-linear formulation
is excessively high; then, the operational optimisation routine could become a computational
bottleneck when considering complex systems. Therefore, nonlinearities were reformulated as
linear constraints in the design of the mathematical programming problems. In the CSP-TCES
model, in order to linearize the non-linear equations that simulates the mass and energy bal-
ances of each process, the temperatures of the processes are fixed, according to the parameters
and results published, were non-linear models are used to simulate the operation of the CSP
plant with TCES. In a power plant, this may be possible by the instrumentation engineering,
through the definition and control of the temperatures of each process. Hence, the operational
optimisation routine optimises the mass flow rate of some streams and calculate those that are
3.8. Uncertainties, model limitations and advantages 60
dependent (because there are direct relationships between some streams) in order to optimise
the hourly operation. Consequently, this model exploits the capacity of linear programming to
optimise the annual performance of the power plant, taking into account the daily and seasonal
variability or the renewable resource, giving a sufficiently accurate solution with significantly
faster computational time compared with non-linear formulation.
In addition to decrease the computational time compared with non-linear models, crucial to op-
timise the annual performance with hourly time steps, other advantages of the model developed
in this research compared with available tools can be listed by:
 The model can integrate different energy conversion and energy storage technologies.
 The model can optimise the power operation of the power plant under different objectives
that can be easily defined.
 The model can consider any time step and data horizon. For instance, 10 min time steps,
25 years of input data, etc. Moreover, in the case that an in-depth analysis is required
to address the impact of climate change in the operation of solar power technologies,
different scenarios can be created and used as input data. Then, the model results can
give a set of opportunities for adaptation by designing a more resilient power network.
 The model can be easily modified to consider annual changes in input parameters that
depend on the technology readiness level and location. These parameters can be re-
lated with efficiencies, investment costs of different components (heliostat field, tower,
receiver, photovoltaic modules, inverters, thermal energy storage, chemical reactors,
turbines, compressors, and heat exchangers), contingencies, discount rates, taxes, price
of land, annual degradation rate, operational and maintenance costs, etc.
 The model, written in python, can be integrated with machine learning tools that would
give substantial advantages, like data clustering, emulators, big data analyses, neural
network and deep learning, etc.

Atacama-1: Improvement of a hybrid
solar power plant with thermal energy
storage
The work presented in this chapter is based on an article published in the Journal Solar Energy
(Bravo and Friedrich, 2018)
4.1 Introduction
In this chapter, the two-stage optimisation framework presented in Chapter 3 is applied for the
optimal design of a hybrid solar power plant with thermal energy storage. Here, the integration
of a two-tank molten salt technology as a sensible heat thermal energy storage system is
studied. The operational optimisation is performed by linear programming, and the automated
linear scalarisation method is analysed in order to develop guidelines for future applications.
The dispatchability and affordability of the system are studied, and the trade-off between
financial and technical performance is analysed. The optimisation framework is applied to
analyse and improve the design of a power plant under construction in Northern Chile, known
as Atacama-1 or Cerro Dominador solar power plant. Through the analysis of the results
presented, it is demonstrated that balancing the trade-off between financial and technical per-
formance is crucial to increase the affordability of solar technologies. Moreover, the direct link
between the objectives of the design and operational optimisation routines is crucial to exploit
the synergies of technology integration.

Figure 4.1: Power flow model of Atacama-1 hybrid solar power plant
4.2 Plant modelling
In order to simulate and optimise the operation of the hybrid solar power plant, the application
of the energy system analysis presented in Chapter 3 is carried out. The power flow model used
to analyse the operation of the power plant is shown in Figure 4.1. This figure illustrates the
power flows between subsystems with solid lines, which are the variables of the operational
optimisation. In addition, with red letters, the capacities of the mains components are shown,
that correspond to the variables of the design optimisation.
The power flow model exposes the processes involved in the operation of the hybrid power
plant in terms of power flows, energy balances, energy losses, and capacities of components.
In the power flow model, every block is one of the main subsystems of the power plant: solar
field of the CSP, thermal energy storage system, power block (PB), PV power plant, inverter,
and network. Every line that connects two subsystems represents heat or electricity transfer.
Constraints are related to the capacities of different subsystems or components. The following
heat flows QCSP 7PBi (heat flow from the receiver to the power block); Q
CSP 7T ES
i (heat flow from
the receiver to the thermal energy storage system); QT ES 7PBi (heat flow from the thermal energy
storage system to the power block), are optimisation variables which are optimised concerning
the objectives of the operational optimisation. Energy balances calculate other variables like
the amount of curtailed energy, thermal losses and the energy dispatched by the PV power
plant according to the results of the optimisation. The variables of the design optimisation are
the capacities of four subsystems: solar field area of the CSP (ACSP), the capacity of the storage
system (QT ES,max), capacity of the power block PPB,max, and solar PV area (APV ), which are

shown with red letters in the figure. The model focuses to supply energy to a given commitment;
moreover, the excess of generation has no penalty and can be delivered to the network. Finally,
parameters are given by blue letters, and these are associated with:
 DNI data of the location.
 GTI data of the location for a defined slope.
 The efficiencies of each component.
 Demand that the power plants should dispatch: Pdemandi (in order to calculate LPSi).
 Operational and local limits, e.g., capacity of the network.
The power flow model is used in the operation optimisation and nested in the design optimisa-
tion of the hybrid solar power plant. The optimal plant is reached by selecting the best sizes of
each subsystem, i.e. solar field area, thermal energy storage, power block, and a photovoltaic
array. Therefore, the two-stage optimisation model simultaneously optimises the operation and
the design of the hybrid solar power plant. A schematic of the framework is shown in Figure
3.11.
4.2.1 Operational optimisation
The operational optimisation aims to find the specific operation at each time step that enhances
the performance of a hybrid solar power plant for a given design. As shown in Figure 4.1,
the results of the operational optimisation are related to power flows. Then, different financial
and technical indicators can be calculated. In order to link financial performance in the design
optimisation, the operational optimisation aims to maximise the energy supplied (to minimise
the LCOE), and to minimise the loss of power supply. Hence, the objectives of the operational
optimisation are:
MaxE
i (4.1)
Min LPSi (4.2)
The one-year, hourly operational optimisation is performed by linear programming due to the
large number of optimisation variables, i.e. 8760 optimisation variables for each connection
shown in Figure 4.1. Moreover, in order to handle both objectives, the automated scalarisation
method presented in Chapter 3 is applied.
4.2. Plant modelling 64
4.2.2 Design plus operational optimisation
The aim of the design optimisation, defined as a two-stage optimisation problem, is to have the
best or a range of designs of hybrid solar power plants that optimise the pursued objectives.
The design optimisation needs to simultaneously optimise the operation of each candidate and
focus on the selection of the best designs. This process is done by the operational optimisation
described above, and its results are the input data to select the best range of designs. In other
words, the operation of each configuration of the design optimisation is optimised by the
operational optimisation.
Depending on the number of objectives, the design plus operational optimisation can be mod-
elled as single or multi-objective optimisation. While the single objective optimisation gives
the best design that optimises the objective; the multi-objective optimisation reaches a range of
non-dominated or Pareto optimal solutions, which represent the best design showing the trade-
off between objectives. Therefore, every point on the Pareto frontier is valuable and a potential
candidate and a-posteriori process to select the best design regarding the desired target has to
be done by the user of the model.
Objectives
The objectives of the design optimisation can be related to technical (described for the oper-
ational optimisation), financial, environmental or societal performance metrics. Because the
present model is a numerical approximation of the best design, each objective should be quan-
titative. This study is focused on minimising the financial costs and maximising the dispatcha-
bility of the power plant, according to:
 Minimisation of Investment cost.
 Minimisation of LCOE.
 Minimisation of LPSC, i.e. maximise dispatchability.
Decision Variables
The decision variables of the design optimisation are:
 Solar field area of CSP plant: ACSP , m2.
 Storage capacity: QSTO,max , MWh.
 Power block capacity: PPB,max , MW.
 Solar PV area: APV , m2.
Some of these variables are related to each other under the following indicators, which can be
crucial to understand and define guidelines for optimised plants:
 SM, Solar multiple. Defined as the relation between the design capacity of the solar field
and the power block (Denholm et al., 2015b).

 StH, hours of storage. Is the ratio between the total capacity of the storage system (MWh)
and the power block capacity (MW).
4.3 Case study
In order to set a case study, the Atacama Desert will be considered. This arid region which
covers around 300,000 km2 is located in Northern Chile. It is one of the sunniest places on
Earth (Cordero et al., 2016), wherein a typical year, the annual Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI)
is near or more than 3,500 kWhm2 (Ministry of Energy - University of Chile, 2016; Parrado
et al., 2016b). This zone contains 23 of the 30 largest copper mines of the Chilean copper
industry (Mining Council Chile, 2015), which produce approximately 73% of the copper in
Chile. This Chilean industry contributes more than 30% of the total copper production of
the world (Northey et al., 2013). The copper industry is a continuous and energy-intensive
process, in fact, during 2015, Chilean copper mines used around 23,600 GWh of electricity
and additionally around 2,700 GWh of fossil fuel was burned for low-temperature heating
operations mainly in copper refining and hydrometallurgical processes (Comisin Chilena del
Cobre, 2016). Because the mining industry leads the electricity consumption in Northern Chile,
the demand is quite flat, with no significant variations between day and night. Hence, the
Northern Chile electricity market needs to supply a steady energy demand 24 hours and seven
days per week. Regarding the Chilean Centre for Economic Load Dispatch (CDEC) of the
Northern Interconnected System (SING), 75.4% of the electricity generated during 2015 was
generated in coal-fueled power plants, 21% from other fossil-fuelled power plants (Natural
gas, Diesel, Fuel Oil), and just 3.6% from renewable resources (solar, wind, hydro) (CDEC-
SING, 2015). According to these numbers, the Chilean Ministry of Energy reported that the
carbon intensity of SING in 2015 was 0.764 tCO2eqMWh1 (Ministry of Energy - Chilean
Government, 2017). On the other hand, one of the biggest challenges of the Chilean mining
industry is to get economical, reliable, and sustainable energy resources, as well as the efficient
use of them (Mining Council Chile, 2015). To apply and prove the model, the Atacama-1
or Cerro Dominador Solar Power Plant, a hybrid solar power plant under construction in
the Atacama Desert in Chile has been studied. Regarding the published information by the
engineering and construction company (Abengoa Solar, 2016) and by the Chilean Ministry of
Environment (Servicio de Evaluacin Ambiental, 2014), some features of the project are:

4.3.1 Solar irradiation, data quality control and preparation
The DNI and the GTI (for a panel slope  latitude) data in the location of the project was
obtained from the Chilean Ministry of Energy and University of Chile solar resource data
centre (Ministry of Energy - University of Chile, 2016). This open-source information includes
weather and irradiation data of the Chilean territory.
Figure 4.2: Typical meteorological year, Direct normal irradiation, hourly time-steps at the
Atacama-1 location
Figure 4.2 shows the direct normal irradiation with hourly resolution, of the typical meteo-
rological year in the location under analysis. It is important to note that all simulations and
optimisations carried out in this research use the typical meteorological year with hourly time-
steps. To present the same data in a more comprehensible perspective, Figure 4.3 shows the
1-day and 2-day moving average, and the annual average for the DNI. In both cases, the 5th
percentile is around 330 Wm2, this means that 95% of the time the DNI is at least 330
Wm2, in other words, the daily DNI has no considerable variation during the year. The
present study considers the typical meteorological year, hence, the results represent the long
time performance of the project. Nevertheless, the irradiation variability in the Atacama Desert
is influenced by El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). While La Nia (occurring at irregular
intervals of around six years) has a high correlation with high precipitations during summer
(Dec-Jan-Feb-March) of the Southern Hemisphere in the Atacama Desert, high rainfalls during

winter are associated with El Nio (Houston, 2006). These phenomena will result in years with
solar irradiation significantly different from TMY. This effects should be analysed in further
research.
4.3.2 Solar power plant simulation conditions
As explained previously, technical and financial information of solar power plants in operation
and under construction is necessary as input to the model. The System Advisor Model (SAM)
(NREL, 2018) was used to get financial (unitary costs) and technical (efficiencies) data. The
investment cost is calculated by scaling the unitary cost detailed in Chapter 3 (section 3.6.3)
of the components of the CSP and the PV power plants, e.g. USDm2 for the solar field,
USDMWh1 for the thermal energy storage system, USDMW1 for the power block.
According to the solar irradiation, for around 70% of the total annual daytime hours the DNI
is higher than 800 Whm2. Moreover, the operational optimisation is focused on maximising
the use of the power plant. Hence the power block will work near full capacity most of the
time. For these reasons, and in order to simplify the model, the efficiencies used for each
subsystem are constant for every hour and every design and are shown in Table 4.1. These
efficiencies are used to estimate the sizes of the components and the operational performance
of the system. In order to validate the model, results of the model were compared with both,
the System Advisor Model and information published by the IEA in the report: Projected Cost
of Generating Electricity 2015 edition (IEA et al., 2015).

4.3.3 Validation of simulation results
In order to validate the model, the configuration of Atacama-1 was simulated using SAM,
and compared with the result of achieved by the python model. As can be seen in the table,
the results indicate that differences between the values obtained through the Python and SAM
models are in the order of 1% and lower.

The operational optimisation model was applied to Atacama-1 and run a series of times to
compare different operational strategies, as shown in Table 4.3. First, the CSP and PV plants
were optimised independently. Hence, the values shown in the columns "CSP" and "PV" rep-
resent the multi-objective optimisation by the application of the method to single technologies.
4.3. Case study 69
When analysing the CSP plant, the commitment was defined as constant and equal to 110 MW,
which corresponds to the maximum capacity of the power block. Hence, 110 MW is the power
that can be dispatched during hours with no solar irradiation. In the case of the PV plant of
Atacama-1, a constant supply of 100 MW, which is the maximum capacity of the plant, was
defined as a constant commitment. These results are shown in the columns CSP and PV in
Table 4.3. The results indicate that a CSP with TES has a higher LCOE but lower LPSC than
a PV plant (due to the ability of the CSP to store energy during the day and to dispatch power
during the night). The values show that the maximum energy dispatched is 864 GWhyear1
and the minimum LPSP is 10.3 %, both achieved by the use of an expensive CSP with energy
storage. On the contrary, the PV plant, with considerable lower investment, reaches an LCOE of
92.4 USDMWh1 compared to 132.06 USDMWh1 for the CSP plant. By the combination of
these two solar power plants, the synergy of technology integration could be exploited, meaning
an improvement on both financial and technical performances. Consequently, a decrease in both
LCOE and LPSC is expected by the hybridisation.
Then, the hybrid solar power plant was studied under single and multi-objective operational
optimisation. In this case, the model was run twice with two different objectives: Max{ENet}
and Min{LPSC}. Nevertheless, as previously explained, the objectives defined in the model
depend on the goal pursued by the user of the model and can be easily modified. The objectives
can be focused on a financial perspective by selling the maximum quantity of energy, thus,
reaching the lowest LCOE, and on a technical perspective, e.g. a firm electricity supply.
In order to estimate the dispatchability of the hybrid solar power plant, the commitment was
defined fixed and constant at every hour and equal to the maximum capacity of the CSP power
plant (110 MW), this because unlike PV, CSP with TES can deliver energy during the night.
Results summarised in table 4.3 shown that both methods: Max{ENet} and Min{LPSC} get
different results.
First, the Max{ENet}method achieves the highest total energy generated (1,125.7 GWhyear1),
consequently, the minimum LCOE, but the LPSP is high (10.12 %). Second, the Min{LPSC}
results in a very low value in both LPSP (1.016 %), and ENet (953.8 GWhyear1), hence, a
higher LCOE. Consequently, the hybridisation of the power plant can improve the performance
of solar technologies. However, the right operational strategy of the hybrid solar power plant
is essential in order to simultaneously maximise the energy delivered to the network (which
influences the LCOE) and minimise the LPSC. Therefore, the next step is to find the best
operational strategy under a multi-objective optimisation.
The two techniques described in Section 3.5.5 to solve multi-objective optimisation problems
in linear programming are analysed here. In the scalarisation method, the multi-objective op-
timisation problem is transformed into a single objective optimisation problem by combining
and weighting both objectives. While in the -constraint method, one objective is considered
as a constraint in the formulation of the optimisation problem. The challenge here is to define
4.3. Case study 70
a proper value of the scaling or constraint.
Scalarisation method
As described in Chapter 3, the following function represents the new single objective optimi-
sation problem:
maximise
{PNeti  LPSi} (4.3)
where the positive parameter  is the scaling factor applied to the second objective. Regarding
the results shown in Table 4.3, the scaling factor that balances the second objective (LPSi) with
respect to the first one (Pgeni ) can be approximated by

Then, in order to build the Pareto frontier, and compare the solutions of this method with the
previous results of the single objective optimisations,  was evaluated in the range   [0,100],
which is large enough to cover the range between the two single objective optimisations. The
Pareto frontier generated from this method is presented in Figure 4.4 and some solutions are
shown in Table 4.4.

In this method the optimisation problem is formulated as:

where  varies between the values of the LPSC given by both previous single objective optimi-
sations shown in Table 4.3:   [9.8,97.5]GWhyear1. The Pareto optimal values generated
from this method are also shown in Figure 4.4 and solution points are presented in Table 4.4.
The diagram and table show that a similar Pareto frontier is achieved in both methods.
From Figure 4.4 it is possible to appreciate the behaviour of each of the four different meth-
ods studied: First, the Max{ENet} method maximises the energy delivered, getting the lowest
LCOE (122.85 USDMWh1). Nevertheless, it presents the highest LPSP 10.12%, which is
not an attractive value for the reliability of the system. Second, the Min{LPSC} method is
4.3. Case study 72
outside of the Pareto frontier, and it presents a very low value of the total energy delivered to
the network. Consequently, the LCOE associated with this method is high and not attractive
for the financial optimisation of the system. Finally, both the scalarisation and the -constraint
methods show similar Pareto optimal solutions.
The purpose of the model is to design an affordable and dispatchable power plant. Thus, the
target of the optimisation should reach the zone highlighted with an ellipse in Figure 4.4. Both
the scalarisation and the -constraint methods, with a good definition of values of  and  ,
respectively, reach this area. Nevertheless, while the scalarisation method takes around 10
seconds to be processed, the -constraint takes almost 10 minutes. Hence, the next step is
to apply the automated scalarisation method proposed in Chapter 3.
Automated scalarisation method
The automated scalarisation method was applied to find the best operational profile for Atacama-
1. Figure 4.4 and Table 4.3 summarise the result of this technique. Figure 4.4 shows that the
maximum value of the segment d was found for  = 1. This value suggests that the relation
presented in Eq. 4.4, that weights both objectives, is a simple and suitable estimation for  .
The results of the automated scalarisation are shown in Table 4.3. These results, compared
with the method in which the objective is Max{ENet} means an increase in 1.4% in the LCOE.
Nevertheless, the LPSP is just 10% of the original (1.02% instead of 10.12%). As expected,
comparing the CSP plant with the hybrid plant, the LCOE decreases from 139.06 to 124.6
USDMWh1 and the LPSP decreased from 10.30% to 1.02%. The improvement on both
indicators confirms the synergies of technology integration for hybrid power plants.
Figure 4.5: Sankey diagram of the annual energy flows
The main results of the operational optimisation are the hourly power flows, as well as losses
or curtailments. For instance, Figure 4.5 shows the total flows from both technologies and the
supply to the commitment as well the excess energy dispatched to the network. Figure 4.6
illustrates the state of charge (SoC) of the thermal energy storage system over one year. The
4.3. Case study 73
storage system of Atacama-1 has an StH of 17.5 h. This value means that when the storage
is fully charged (100%), the power plant can work at full capacity for 17.5 h with no solar
irradiation. However, regarding Figure 4.6, the maximum state of charge of the TES system
is 83%, with a mean of 36.3%. This value suggests that the TES system of Atacama-1 may
be oversized. Hence, its capacity could be reduced in order to reduce investment costs in the
design stage. This idea opens the possibility to improve the design of Atacama-1.
According to the features of the thermal energy storage system (Section 3.4), there is a lower
limit of temperature below that molten salts solidified. Hence, as shown in Figure 4.6, special
attention has to be put on the operational control of the plant when the SoC is 0 to avoid possible
solidification.

parison
The design optimisation method was applied and run for the same location as Atacama-1. The
main purpose is to improve the design of the hybrid solar power plant. Table 4.5 summarises the
elements considered in the optimisation. First, the parameters are related with the solar resource
of the location, the efficiencies and unitary investment cost of the components given by data
from power plants under construction and in operation, as well as other financial parameters
like the lifetime and the discount rate, among others. Second, the constraints are associated with
energy balances and capacities of the systems. Third, the objectives are defined as financial and
technical performance metrics. Finally, the variables are the capacities of the main components
of the power plant.

The following sections outline different strategies to handle the design optimisation. These
approaches are related to the number of objectives and the number of variables. First, the
number of variables considered in the optimisation can be from one variable up to four vari-
ables. When one variable is studied in the optimisation, it can be analysed as an upgrade to the
existing power plant in order to improve its performance. On the other hand, four variables can
be considered in order to develop a brand new power plant defined by the given parameters.
Then, the number of objectives considered are crucial in the complexity of the problem. For
instance, a generator company might want to increase the revenues of the existing power plant
by reaching the lowest LCOE. Other users could be the market operator or a large consumer,
which could be interested not just in the financial performance but in the dispatchability as well.
The most complicated situation is a multi-objective optimisation, in which different conflicting
objectives are pursued.
The aim of considering different approaches is to demonstrate the importance of a multi-
objective optimisation method for the design of dispatchable power plants. This optimal design
is crucial to support an affordable transition to a sustainable energy system.

4.4.1 Single variable, single objective
As a first approximation, a single-variable single-objective design optimisation was developed
and applied to the CSP plant of Atacama-1, in order to analyse the dispatchability of the
hybrid power plant. In this case the affordability is improved by the PV plant that is fixed
in the following evaluations. In this model just one of the main components is considered as
a variable and the other three are considered parameters (fixed). This problem was developed
as a deterministic global optimisation problem, and an improved design was reached. Table
4.6 shows the results achieved by the design optimisation focusing on the minimisation of the
LCOE. Here the operation of each iteration (which correspond to a different CSP plant design)
was optimised by the automated scalarisation method described previously.
Variable: Solar field area
Keeping TES, PB, and PV capacities fixed, the deterministic global optimisation was run, and
an improved design was achieved. In this case, a solar field area of 161.4 104m2, is the optimal
value. This means 930 more heliostats than the original design (11,530 instead of 10,600),
hence, a larger SM. As a result, despite the investment increase, more energy can be delivered,
and more energy is available during the night. Thus, both LCOE and LPSC decrease.
Variable: Thermal energy storage capacity
Holding the solar field area, the PB and the PV capacities fixed, the best design of the plant
is given by a decrease of the TES capacity from 5243 MWh (StH of 17.5 h) to 3503 MWh
(StH 11.7 h), achieving an LCOE of 118.78 USDMWh1. This result agrees with the previous
analysis of the state of charge of the TES system. The reduction in TES capacity directly
reduces the investment costs and thus has a positive impact on the LCOE. Moreover, the lower
TES capacity produces two effects: (i) a decrease in the energy losses in the storage system
4.4. Optimisation techniques implementation, results and comparison 76
(because less energy is stored), as a result more energy can be delivered (which has a positive
effect on the LCOE), (ii) because less energy is available during night hours, less energy is
delivered during this time (which has a negative effect on the LPSC), therefore, LPSC increases.
The combination of all these interactions results in a small increase on the energy delivered
during the day, a decrease in the energy available during night, and a considerable decrease on
the investment, as a result, LCOE decreases and LPSC increases.
Variable: Power block capacity
It is necessary to point out that the focus of these sections is to analyse and to show the
importance of considering multiple optimisation variables and objectives. Hence, the study
considers the decision variable with continuous values. Then, by keeping the solar field area,
TES and PV capacities fixed, the best design of the plant is reached by a power block very
close to the nominal 110 MW. Hence, in the next sections the power block is fixed at 110 MW.
In summary, all the iterations of the optimisation for the three cases are shown in the sensitivity
analysis in Figure 4.7, which shows the convexity of the model for single-variable and single-
objective optimisation. This diagram illustrates the best options to improve the design of the
project to reduce LCOE. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 4.6, while the LCOE improves, the
dispatchability declines. Therefore, the development of a multi-objective optimisation tech-
nique allows us to handle this trade-off.

4.4.2 Multi-variable, multi-objective optimisation
The two-stage design and operational optimisation framework by genetic algorithms is applied
in this section. This heuristic optimisation method applies the NSGA-II algorithm, which has
been used in several multi-objective optimisation problems in energy systems (Starke et al.,
2018; Amusat et al., 2017). The algorithm starts with a random population. In order to have a
detailed first population, here 200 individuals are defined to cover a large range of combinations
of the variables under analysis. In this case, three design variables, i.e. ACSP, QSTO,max, and
APV,max, as shown in Table 4.5, are considered. Hence, every individual is composed of 3
variables, corresponding to a defined design. In the genetic algorithm, the total investment cost
of each design is calculated. Then its optimal operational performance is achieved by applying
the automated scalarisation method described previously. This technique links the LCOE and
LPSC in both stages. The genetic algorithm executes the selection of the best individuals under
two or three objectives: Min LCOE, Min Investment and Min LPSC. This loop repeats until
the criterion is reached. Here the stopping criteria was defined as 80 generations, in order to
exploit the capacity of the computer exposed in Section 3.7, during 2.5 days.
In order to calculate the dispatchability, and to get results comparable with Atacama-1, the
power commitment is defined as PCommitmenti = 110 MW for all time-steps. For this reason, and
because only the CSP plant can deliver energy during the night, the power block capacity was
fixed and equal to the commitment, PPB,max = 110 MW.
The optimisation produces a range of different points that represent different options of the
optimal design of the hybrid solar power plant and the respective performance during its
lifetime (based on the TMY). Each design on this Pareto frontier represents a potential solution,
and the final choice will depend on the aims of the developer.
Three variables, two objectives:
First, the design optimisation is extended with three variables (ACSP, ESTOmax , P
max) and two
objectives (LCOE and Investment cost). Figure 4.8 shows the results of the optimisation, the
Pareto frontier and the performance of Atacama-1 in order to make a quick comparison between
the results. For instance, Figure 4.8 highlights two points (A and B) belonging to the non-
dominated solutions. These solutions are detailed in Table 4.7, including the performance of
Atacama-1. These points are related to the best performance that can be reached with similar
investment or similar LCOE achieved by Atacama-1. The first point, A, shows a design with
a decrease of the LCOE and Investment; nevertheless, its LPSP is 22%. The second point, B,
displays that a similar LCOE can be reached with just 65% of the original investment, but the
LPSP is 37%, a very high value compared with Atacama-1.
Figure 4.9 shows every design on the Pareto frontier with LPSP< 30%. On the horizontal
axis are shown the 4 components of the design (PPBmax, ACSP, E
max , and the capacity of the PV

plant in MW PPVmax), the two objectives of the design optimisation (LCOE, investment cost), and
the LPSP which is calculated from the operational optimisation. The vertical axis shows the
normalised value of the variables, where the minimum and maximum values are shown. This
figure explains that the model can reach simultaneously better LCOE and Investment cost for
a design similar to Atacama-1. Nevertheless, because the technical performance (represented
by the LPSP) is not included in the design optimisation stage, the values of the LPSP are very
high. As a consequence of these results, in order to reach better financial (LCOE, Investment)
and technical (LPSP) performances, the LPSP has to be incorporated as a third objective.

Three variables, three objectives:
In this step, the complexity of the model is increased through a third objective. Here the aim
is to examine the benefits in the integration of the dispatchability as another objective. Figure
4.10 shows the Pareto surface and the performance of Atacama-1. Here, the 3D Pareto surface
is represented in a 2D diagram (LCOE, Investment), in which the third objective (LPSP)
is illustrated through different ranges and symbols. Near to the centre is Atacama-1, which
divides the plane into four quadrants. The crosses and the stars have a LPSP lower than
Atacama-1. Therefore, any of these points located in Quadrant I have both better financial and
technical performance than Atacama-1. Second, all points in Quadrant I have better financial
performance than Atacama-1, but their LPSP varies between 0.65% to 3%. Third, in order to
reach lower values of LPSP (shown by crosses and stars in the diagram), similar or higher
investments are needed. Nevertheless, lower values of LCOE can be reached simultaneously.
Fourth, while lower values of LCOE (Quadrants I and II) are possible with similar investments
than Atacama-1, their LPSP can even be near 0.285%. Five of these points are summarised in
Table 4.8 and shown in Figure 4.10 bounded in a circle and defined by the letters A, B, C, D and

with similar investment but a lower LCOE than Atacama-1. Designs D and E are examples of
more reliable power plants, which can be developed with low LCOE, however high investment
is necessary.
In addition, the 12 stars located in Quadrant I in Figure 4.10, with all three objectives improved
compared with Atacama-1, are detailed in Figure 4.11. This figure shows the design parameters,
the results of the three objectives and some key design indicators (SM, StH, and CFCSP) as well
as its comparison with Atacama-1. Moreover, for these 12 individuals, a correlation matrix
between each objective and the indicators mentioned (SM and StH) is shown below:

Figure 4.11: Key performance indicators of 12 designs with better performance than
Atacama-1 (three variables and three objectives)
These results provide us with an understanding of the design of the power plant. Moreover,
some of them are key to define some guidelines. For instance, because SM and StH are related
to the installed capacities of the solar field and the storage system, both have a positive corre-
lation with the LCOE. As expected, the LPSP has a negative correlation with both LCOE and
Investment. Consequently, to increase the dispatchability, a decrease in financial performance
is expected. This concept can also be explained by the negative correlation between LPSP
and both SM and StH, suggesting that lower LPSP is reached in oversized power plants. For
that reason, the trade-off between technical and financial performance is essential. Another
interesting point is the correlation between SM and StH, which suggest that there is a positive
correlation between the solar field capacity and the storage capacity observed in optimised
designs.
Finally, Figure 4.10, that represents all non-dominated solutions, and Table 4.8 can be com-
bined to make a better a-posteriori decision to select the best design under optimised objectives
and other key performance indicators. For instance, if the user is looking for a low LCOE,
quadrants I and II should be considered. Then, if high dispatchability is pursued, points D and
E should be analysed in more detail. Table 4.8 shows that the capacity factor of the CSP of
design E is better than the capacity factor of design D. Hence, if the budget allows, design E
could be selected. Finally, the solar multiple and storage hours presented in optimised designs
shown in Table 4.8 provide us with guidelines for the development of CSP plants with energy

4.5 Result analysis and Conclusions
In order to make renewable energy systems economical and reliable, the design and operation of
hybrid renewable energy systems have to consider the trade-off between financial and technical
performance of the system and the synergies of technology integration.
The design optimisation needs an internal routine which optimises the operational profile for
multiple and often conflicting objectives. However, the operational optimisation is usually
performed with single objective linear programming methods. The two-stage optimisation
framework applied here to improve the design of Atacama-1, simultaneously optimise the
design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant under multiple objectives. While the design
optimisation focuses on the selection of the best configuration for the hybrid solar power
plant, the operational optimisation finds the best strategy to operate. The latter can be used
to analyse the hourly power flows between each component as well as the estimated losses in
each subsystem.
Two methods for the operational optimisation were evaluated and it was found that the linear
scalarisation method achieves the same results but is much faster than the -constraint method.
Then, the automated linear scalarisation method was implemented by valuing the trade-off be-
tween the two objectives. This enabled the integration of the multi-objective linear optimisation
in the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework.
The optimisation framework was applied to analyse and improve the design of the hybrid solar
power plant Atacama-1. The results show that both the financial and technical performance
4.5. Result analysis and Conclusions 83
can be optimised. First, it was shown that the hybrid CSP-PV plant could improve both the
affordability and the dispatchability.
By varying a single design variable from Atacama-1 it was shown that the energy storage
system could be reduced by 33% (from 17.5 to 11.7 h), whereby the LCOE decreases by
almost 5% (from 124.6 to 118.78 USDMWh1). However, the LPSP increased from 1.02%
to 7.17%. Then, a two-objective optimisation showed that both the LCOE and investment cost
could be reduced simultaneously. However, its reliability was considerably degraded because
it was not considered as an objective in the design optimisation.
Finally, a three-objective optimisation (LCOE, investment cost and LPSP) was analysed. This
method shows that the technical and financial performances of Atacama-1 can be simulta-
neously improved. For example, with an investment of 1443 MUSD (lower than Atacama-
1) a decrease in the LCOE from 124.6 to 122.66 USDMWh1 and a decrease in the LPSP
from 1.02% to 0.9% can be reached. Moreover, the optimisation produces a Pareto frontier
of non-dominated solutions outlining the trade-off between different objectives. Consequently,
the specific design needs to be selected by the developer based on further criteria.
A large number of potential solutions enabled the development of correlations between the
different design parameters (e.g. SM, StH) and objectives (LCOE, investment cost, LPSP) of
optimised plants. These correlations can be used to propose guidelines for the optimal design
of hybrid solar power plants with energy storage. For instance, a SM of 2.6 and a StH of 15 h
can be used as guidelines to develop affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with
energy storage in the Atacama Desert. In addition, the negative correlation between LPSP with
LCOE and Investment indicates the trade-off between technical and financial performance.
Besides, the negative correlation between LPSP with SM and StH suggests that oversized
power plants improve the dispatchability.

5.1 Introduction
The present chapter investigates the synergies of technology integration. Different configu-
rations will be described and analysed through four case studies. The location that will be
considered, due to its high potential to develop solar power plants, is the Atacama Desert
in Northern Chile. Figure 5.1 shows the region of Antofagasta in the Atacama Desert. As
illustrated in the figure, the Antofagasta region is one of the sunniest places on Earth. In this
context, Figure 5.2 shows the daily average of the direct normal irradiation (DNI) and the
global tilted irradiation (GTI) of the location highlighted with a green circle in Figure 5.1. All
case studies analysed are shown in Table 5.1. Some configurations described here are based
on the design of an off-grid hybrid power plant to supply energy to an isolated copper mine.
An off-grid power plant is not connected to the grid; hence it is not possible to dispatch energy
when the supply exceeds the demand of the copper mine. Moreover, the operation of the copper
mine will be restricted to the power supply of the power plant. Consequently, dispatchability
becomes crucial.
First, due to the low cost of solar PV, and the expected reduction in the cost of batteries, Section
5.2 analyses the combination of a solar power plant with thermal and electrical energy storage,
and a long-term cost analysis is addressed. Second, some studies suggest that the integration
of a fossil backup unit is key to increase the dispatchability and affordability of solar power
technologies; hence, an essential aspect in an economical pathway to decarbonise the power
sector. This configuration is analysed in Section 5.3. Then, Section 5.4 evaluates the heat
supply for low-temperature mining processes from the heat rejection of the Rankine cycle
of the CSP plant. Despite that the technical feasibility of this project depends on the location
of the power plant and the mining processes that require heat, the high cost of diesel in the
Atacama Region could be a transcendental variable. Finally, due to CSP and PV plants work

with solar irradiation, the integration of a Windfarm, analysed in Section 5.5, decreases the
variability of the renewable resource used in the hybrid power plant. Hence, the deployment of
hybrid power plants considering three (or more) different renewable technologies enhance the
competitivity of distributed sustainable power plants.
The location of the hybrid solar power plant, the wind farm, and the two copper mines examined
in the case studies are shown in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.3 presents the daily average power
demand of the two copper mines analysed in the case studies: El Abra copper mine (Freeport-
McMoRan, Codelco), and Spence copper mine (BHP) (Chilean Center for Economic Load
Dispatch, 2016). In this study, the fluctuating hourly power demand of these copper mines is
used as a commitment for the operational optimisation of the power plant.
The base model applied in this chapter is exposed in Figure 5.4. The diagram represents the
mass and energy flows of the concentrating solar power plant and the photovoltaic power plant
that will be integrated and analysed in the case studies detailed in the following sections.

D. Integration of energy storage with hybrid solar power plants. 3rd Annual Conference in
Energy Storage and its Applications: Energy Procedia; 2018
5.2.1 Introduction
The integration of energy storage can reduce the large fluctuations of electricity supplied from
the intermittent resource in renewable power plants. While electrical energy storage is suitable
for the integration with PV plants, thermal energy storage is valuable for CSP plants.
PV systems are one of the more affordable technologies to provide electricity, and further
reductions are expected (Fraunhofer ISE, 2015). According to the results of Chapter 4, the
levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of a PV plant located in Northern Chile, without storage is
around 90 USDMWh1. On the contrary, the LCOE is close to 130 USDMWh1 for a CSP
plant with 17.5 h of two-tank molten salt energy storage and a solar multiple of 2.6 (i.e. the
design capacity of the solar field is 2.6 times the capacity of the power block). In terms of
the storage system, investment costs of TES are approximately 25 USDkWh1 (molten salts),
and electrical energy storage (EES) system costs are around 600 USDkWh1 (DC batteries)
(NREL, 2017). Then, if we include the efficiencies to transform both stored thermal energy
and energy stored in batteries to electrical AC, TES systems are around ten times cheaper than
EES. Thus, CSP systems integrated with TES are currently one of the most cost-competitive
5.2. Long-term analysis of electrical and thermal energy storage integration 88
technologies to provide reliable and baseload power, and it becomes more affordable when it
is hybridised with PV. However, in the medium-term, EES systems are expected to have an
extreme cost reduction, and then PV with EES could be the best alternative.
According to published projections, cost reductions depend on the learning rate of each tech-
nology. In the case of PV and battery systems, Fraunhofer ISE (2015) analyses the projections
of costs for the modules, inverter and balance of the system as well as the improvement in
efficiencies, and concluded that, considered 2015 as baseline, the total investment cost of a PV
system would decrease between 40% and 70% by 2050. In another study, Joint Research Centre
(2014) reported that the expected reduction in PV costs without tracking system could be in the
range of 50% to 60%. Besides, some publications estimate that costs of EES systems could be
closer to 100 USDkWh1 by 2050 (Schmidt et al., 2017; Worley Parsons, 2012). Otherwise,
the expected reduction for CSP and TES systems are in the range of 20% to 30% (Joint
Research Centre, 2014; IEA et al., 2015). Finally, based on the projections of Joint Research
Centre (2014), a reduction between 20% and 40% in the fixed and variable operational and
maintenance costs (O&M) for both technologies are considered in this study.
In this study, these estimations are used to define different scenarios of cost reduction, based
on 2016 costs, where each scenario represents a particular level of learning rate reached for
each technology by 2050. These levels will be interpreted as the investment and O&M costs
and used as parameters in the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework developed
in Chapter 3. Finally, the results of each scenario will be analysed to find the features of the
dominant technology in a hybrid solar power plant that provides dispatchable energy.
5.2.2 Optimisation Implementation
As a case study, the design of an off-grid power plant that delivers energy to Spence cop-
per mine (Figure 5.1) is examined. As reported before, hourly power demand was obtained
from Chilean Center for Economic Load Dispatch (2016) (Figure 5.3), and solar irradiation
information for the typical meteorological year from Ministry of Energy - University of Chile
(2016) (Figure 5.2). Technical and financial performance of CSP and PV power plants, i.e.
efficiencies, capacities, investment costs, operational and maintenance cost are estimated by
using SAM (NREL, 2017).
Figure 5.5 shows the hourly power demand for Spence, the direct normal irradiation (DNI) and
the global tilted irradiation (GTI) during one week in summer (January) and one week in winter
(July) for the year 2016. The diagram reflects, among others, the profile of the demand required
to be met, and the mismatch between power commitment and solar resource availability. The
maximum power demand of Spence during the year of analysis (2016) was 83 MW, and its
average power consumption was 58 MW. In addition, the reported solar irradiation for that
year was: DNI 3500 kWhm2, and GTI2630 kWhm2.

Figure 5.6 details the power flow model of the hybrid solar power plant with thermal energy
storage (molten salt) and electrical energy storage (batteries). Here the capacity of the battery
system is included as a variable in the design optimisation. Tables 5.2 and 5.3 enumerate all
variables and parameters used in the model. For instance, in the battery system, the charging
power (PPV 7EESi ), discharging power (P
EES 7Inv
i ), as well as the energy stored in the battery
system (EEESi ) are variables in the operational optimisation model. The energy stored in the
battery is calculated based on an energy balance analysis, according to:

EEESi = E
i1 
EES +(PPV 7EESi

Then, the net power dispatched by the hybrid power plant is the sum of the power supplied
from both solar power plants, and the commitment constrains the maximum power dispatched.
In this case, because the analysis is for an off-grid power plant, any extra power that could be
generated that exceeds commitment has to be curtailed in the solar fields.

5.2.3 Results analysis
Different scenarios are considered and compared. Each case combines a particular expected
level of investment cost (IC) reduction, by technology in the year 2050. Table 5.4 shows five
scenarios examined, based on 2016 costs and combining different reductions by 2050 between
CSP-TES and PV-EES technologies. As an example, Scenario 1 (S1: LrCSP & LrPV ) considers
a low reduction in CSP technology costs (LrCSP), i.e. 20% reduction in both investment and
O&M costs, and a low reduction in PV system costs (LrPV ), i.e. 40% reduction in investment
costs for the PV plant, 60% drop in investment costs for the EES system, and 20% reduction in
O&M costs of the photovoltaic power plant.
Then, the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework was applied for each scenario. For
each case, the results create a three-dimensional Pareto surface, illustrated in Figure 5.7. These
optimal set of solutions summarise the three objectives chosen in the design optimisation stage
(LCOE, LPSP, and Investment), highlighting current and future configurations of hybrid power
plants to provide affordable and reliable energy from solar technologies. From all solutions,
just those that meet the following criteria are displayed in Figure 5.7: LPSP  8 %; LCOE 
130 USDMWh1; Investment  700 MUSD. Each point represents an optimal design for a
hybrid solar power plant. Here, the line connecting the solutions is used to facilitate the reading,
showing the two-dimensional Pareto front between LCOE and LPSP.
Figure 5.7 exposes that for all scenarios, a substantial reduction in LCOE and investment costs

are expected. For instance, a high dispatchability, accounted for a hybrid solar plant with a
LPSP 1% (follow the vertical line in LPSP = 1%) is reached in 2016 with an LCOE close to
130 USDMWh1, and an investment cost close to 700 MUSD. Even in the most conservative
scenario (S1), the same level of dispatchability is achieved with an LCOE  100 USDMWh1
and an investment close to 500 MUSD. On the other hand, a power plant designed under the
most optimistic scenario (S5) attains the same level of dispatchability with an LCOE of around
65 USDMWh1 and an investment around 350 MUSD.
Figure 5.8 presents the optimal design of a power plant with a LPSP 1% for each scenario
(including 2016). This diagram displays the normalised value of the three objectives considered
in the design optimisation. Then three features of the design for optimised power plants are
expanded. These characteristics are defined by: (i) ASF , the fraction between the solar field area
(m2) of the CSP plant and the total solar field area (CSP+PV); (ii) ESTO: the capacity based on
5.2. Long-term analysis of electrical and thermal energy storage integration 92
Figure 5.7: Design optimisation results for all scenarios considered in the long-term analysis
of TES and EES integration
electrical energy (MWhe) of the thermal energy storage as a fraction of the total energy storage
capacity (TES+EES); and (iii) ESupply: the electricity supplied by the CSP plant divided by the
total energy supplied from the hybrid power plant.
Interestingly, in terms of the dominant technology, CSP with TES is currently the best option
and the dominant technology for an affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar power plant. This
trend will continue just in scenario 4 (i.e. HrCSP & LrPV ) that considers a high reduction in
CSP-TES and a low reduction in PV-EES system costs. In all other cases, a shift to PV with
EES as a dominant technology is expected.
Hence, the design of hybrid solar power plants for scenarios 2016 and S4 are dominated by
CSP-TES. For all other scenarios (S1, S2, S3 and S5) the optimal design of dispatchable power
plants is dominated by a great PV solar field area, a similar or larger capacity of the EES system
compared with the TES. Finally, in these last cases, the PV plant supplies more than 80% of
the total energy dispatched.
As anticipated, these values satisfactorily support the idea that in the medium term, the inte-
gration of solar photovoltaics and battery systems may be the most affordable technology to
provide dispatchable energy. The optimisation framework can be extended to incorporate other
strategies or technologies which could improve both technical and financial performance.
5.2.4 Discussion
This study outlines a valuable approach to design optimised hybrid solar power plants un-
der different assumptions. The findings confirm that currently, CSP with TES is the most
competitive technology to provide affordable and dispatchable power. However, due to the
extreme reduction expected in the cost of EES systems, a shift to PV with EES is anticipated.
Furthermore, in future scenarios, a considerable improvement in the financial performance
of solar hybrid power plants is expected. This method represents a valuable blueprint for

current and future researches in order to have a broader range of cost-competitive, reliable and
sustainable technologies. This procedure can be extended to investigate diverse configurations
in order to combine different energy conversion and energy storage technologies as a single
technology as well as hybrid power plants. Moreover, to design a practical and economic
pathway to decarbonise the power sector gradually, the model could analyse the construction
of PV plants in the short term, and the integration of batteries in the medium term. However,
some constraints that have a large influence in the design, like the availability of materials for
batteries, are not considered in this study. The analysis of objectives related not only to financial
and technical parameters but also societal or environmental indicators can be useful to improve
the strategies of decision and policy-making.
The following sections investigates heat demand analysis and fossil backup. In addition, the
flexibility of the model allows us to study other techniques that could be crucial to design an
economical pathway to a sustainable energy development, for instance, demand-side manage-
ment, the study of a variable demand, among others.

bility of CSP plants

5.3. Integration of a fossil backup unit to increase the dispatchability of CSP plants 94
5.3.1 Introduction
Hybrid renewable power plants that integrate renewable energy technologies with energy stor-
age have the potential to provide sustainable, cost-competitive and dispatchable electricity
supply. Moreover, solar thermal technologies, e.g. concentrating solar power plants, can be
integrated with a fossil backup unit in order to work continuously, as a baseload, even during
long periods with no solar irradiation available (IEA, 2014b). However, its ability depends on
the size of the fossil backup unit and the storage system. In these cases, despite the power
plant emitting some quantities of greenhouse gases, its operation can be improved, resulting
in enhanced technical and financial performances. As a result, the use of energy storage and
fossil-fuelled backup units increases the dispatchability and decreases the integration costs of
hybrid solar power plants.
Hence, in this study, two flexibility strategies are investigated. As in previous analysis, the first
flexibility is that a mismatch between supply and commitment is allowed. The second strategy
is that the system can emit greenhouse gases by the integration of a fossil backup unit which
makes the system not entirely renewable and sustainable. However, this flexibility improves
both technical and financial performances.
5.3.2 Optimisation Implementation
A hybrid power plant integrated with energy storage and a fossil backup unit that supplies
energy to Spence copper mine is analysed as a case study. Figure 5.4 shows the mass and
energy flow model considering a fossil backup unit (FBU), while Figure 5.9 illustrates the
power flow model in an off grid configuration, used in this study to simplify the analysis of
energy conversion and storage systems. Here the capacity of the FBU is considered a variable
of the design optimisation stage, and the heat power supplied as a heat injection process for the
thermal energy storage system (QFBU 7T ESi ) is a variable in the operational optimisation model.
To calculate the heat injection from the fossil backup unit, a heating value 10.63 MWhm3,
a diesel cost of 54 USDMWh1th in Northern Chile, and a heater efficiency of 78% were
considered (Quiones et al., 2020).
The following modified equations represent the energy balances of the thermal energy storage
system under the integration of the FBU:

5.3. Integration of a fossil backup unit to increase the dispatchability of CSP plants 95
Figure 5.9: Power flow model of a hybrid solar power plant with TES, fossil backup, and EES
In the model, the power commitment, i.e. the power that the power plant needs to dispatch,
corresponds to the power demand of Spence copper mine, as shown in Figure 5.3. For the
year considered in this study (2016), the total electricity demand of Spence was approximately
511.3 GWh.
In this case study, the operational optimisation focuses on two objectives. First, the maximisa-
tion of the energy supply:
MaxENet = Max
PNeti ti (5.10)
In the case of an off-grid configuration, the maximisation of the energy supplied, at the same
time minimises the mismatch between supply and demand.
As a second objective, here, the focus is to minimise the maximum value of the loss of power
over the entire evaluation period:
Min LPSMax (5.11)
This variable represents the maximum power shortage for a given configuration. This variable
depends on the design, the commitment, and the operational strategy for every time step. In
contrast with the LPSP, the LPSmax can be useful to know the maximum power that the power
plant is not able to supply in order to evaluate further steps to define a fully dispatchable system,
for instance, to evaluate the minimum capacity for an alternative electric generator system or
5.3. Integration of a fossil backup unit to increase the dispatchability of CSP plants 96
the integration of demand side management techniques.
Therefore, the multi-objective optimisation by linear programming will be developed by the
linear scalarisation method presented in Chapter 3, according to:
Max ENet  LPSMax (5.12)
Here, in order to automate the linear scalarisation method (i.e. automatically choose just one
result from the Pareto optimal solutions), the operation optimisation is performed three times.
The first two iterations ( j = 1,2) are developed as single objective linear optimisation routines,
considering the single objectives mentioned previously: j = 1, MaxENet ; j = 2, MinLPSMax.
In each iteration the energy supplied (ENetj ) and the maximum LPS (LPS
j ) is recorded.
Finally, the linear scalarisation technique is performed with the following :
1 , LPSMaxj=1 = LPS
ENetj=1E
LPSMaxj=1 LPS
, otherwise.
(5.13)
Then, the design optimisation stage is carried out by the two-stage optimisation framework
using genetic algorithms. Table 5.5 shows the variables of the design optimisation. In order to
link both stages, the genetic algorithm performs the optimisation of the design of the power
plant analysing three objectives: (i) levelised cost of energy; (ii) investment, and (iii) maximum
power shortage. Then, as a second stage (as the fitness function), the operational optimisation
is calculated by the automated linear scalarisation method. As a result, the model optimises
the operation simultaneously by maximising the energy delivered to the copper mine, and
minimising both the total and the maximum power shortage.

5.3.3 Results analysis
In order to set the limits of each variable of the design optimisation, the model was run with
a broad range for every component in a first approach, considering the power commitment
and the solar irradiation. Then, the best cost-competitive and dispatchable power plants were
selected, considering an LCOE  150 USDMWh1 and a LPSP  15%, and used to define
smaller ranges. Table 5.6 shows the initial range used to run the model and the improved range
by filtering the results.
After that, the improved ranges were used in the model, and the solutions were added to the
initial results. Figure 5.10 illustrates the Pareto optimal solutions for both cases. This plot
contains the LPSMax in the abscissa, the LCOE in the ordinate, and the Investment is represented
by a sequential colour-map. Pareto optimal or non-dominated solutions represent designs that
are optimised under the three objectives defined. Therefore, every point can be selected as
an optimised design for a suitable hybrid power plant in the decision-making process. The
diagram shows the trade-off between technical (LPSMax) and financial performances (LCOE,
Investment) which must be analysed to make a final decision.
In order to improve the decision-making process, a post-optimisation analysis should be carried
out to have more valuable information and reduce the number of solutions. For instance,
it is possible to analyse the behaviour of different non-dominated solution under other key
performance indicators, like the greenhouse gas emissions, the annual loss of power supply,
the total curtailment when generation exceeds demand, among others.
First, it was found that power plants that can reach a LPSP  10% have a LPSMax  29 MW.
Nevertheless, in order to have a range of solutions, considering dispatchable and also affordable
power plants, four designs are selected and represented in the diagram with the letters A, B, C
and D. Design A has a LPSMax = 0, but the highest LCOE and investment. B is the point with
the lowest LCOE, and LPSP 10% and C has the lowest investment in the Pareto surface, but
a high LCOE and LPSMax. Finally, D is the point with the minimum LCOE between all the
solutions.
5.3. Integration of a fossil backup unit to increase the dispatchability of CSP plants 98
Figure 5.10: Design optimisation results of a hybrid solar power plant with TES, FBU and
Table 5.7 shows key performance indicators of these four designs. The first three rows are
the objectives of the design optimisation. Then, the following four values (EDem, ESurplus,
LPSP, GHG) are shown. These variables are not considered as objectives (hence not optimised);
however, they are useful for the decision-making process. Finally, the size of each component
(variables of the design optimisation) is summarised for each solution. A post-optimisation
analysis could be done by analysing this table, and any indicator here described. For instance,
the decision could be made by considering the loss of power supply probability (LPS), or
the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). An important finding revealed in Table 5.7 is that the
design of highly dispatchable power plants (e.g. A or B) consider a small fossil backup unit
(10 kW and 110 kW, respectively). Hence, the integration of a fossil backup unit to improve
the technical and financial performance is not relevant in the design of a hybrid solar power
plant that dispatch energy to Spence copper mine, this is mainly due to the high levels of solar
irradiation, stable power demand, high costs of diesel in the Atacama Desert, among others.
In addition, Figure 5.11 details the annual operational optimisation of configuration B, consid-
ering the hourly solar irradiation from 2004 to 2015, as well as the typical meteorological year
(TMY), published for the years 2016 and 2018. This analysis is crucial to analyse different
configurations under the solar resource of different years and evaluate worst-case scenarios. In
terms of the LCOE, while the best-case scenario for configuration B was 2006, with an LCOE
 122.4 USDMWh1, the most unfavourable year was 2015, when the LCOE reached 124.7
USDMWh1. A similar analysis for the LPSMax shows that the highest value was reached in
2007 (43.7 MW), while the best scenario was achieved in 2010 (21.8 MW).

5.3.4 Discussion
The integration of different renewable technologies, energy storage, and flexibility are essential
for the design of cost-competitive and dispatchable sustainable power plants. The design of
renewable power plants has to handle a large number of parameters, and the integration of
energy storage requires an operational strategy for every design. Here the two-stage multi-
objective optimisation framework is used to optimise the design of an off-grid hybrid power
plant considering two different solar technologies (CSP and PV), thermal and electrical energy
storage, and incorporates two flexibility strategies (mismatch between supply and demand, and
greenhouse gas emissions).
The optimisation framework was applied to supply energy to Spence, a copper mine located in
Northern Chile. The results illustrate that an LCOE close to 100 USDMWh1 can be reached
but with a significant mismatch between supply and demand. Here, a fully dispatchable system
can be achieved with an LCOE close to 180 USDMWh1. A key finding in this study is that a
small fossil backup unit is selected in the optimal design of the hybrid solar power plant, mainly
due to the relationships between high solar resource available, the stable demand profile, and
the cost of diesel. Consequently, a post-optimisation analysis has to be done to select the most
suitable design according to the users requirements. In this last step, a set of optimal solutions
can be analysed with more details in order to examine other key performance indicators not
considered as objectives, but essential for the decision making.
5.4 Heat supply for low-temperature heating processes in copper
mines
5.4.1 Introduction
According to Comisin Chilena del Cobre (2016), approximately 10% of the total energy used
in a copper mine is to supply heat (typically by the combustion of fossil fuels in a heater) for
low-temperature heating processes. In addition, according to (Quiones et al., 2020), the annual
heat demand of Spence is around 80 GWh. These systems belong to copper refining and hydro-
metallurgical processes. Figure 5.12 shows the power flow model with processes that require
heat supply. Here, the primary heat consumer is the solvent extraction and electrowinning
process, where water heaters are used to maintain a process stream between 45 C and 60
C (Quiones et al., 2020).

5.4.2 Optimisation Implementation
In order to supply the required heat, the heat rejection process of the power block of the CSP
can be employed. The power block works with a Rankine cycle, as shown in Figure 5.13.
This thermodynamic cycle is composed of four main components: (i) a pump, used to increase
the pressure of the water; (ii) a heat exchanger, which uses the sensible heat of the molten
salts as a heat injection to the water to produce superheated steam; (iii) a turbine-generator,
that produces power from the pressure drop of the superheated steam to saturated vapour; and
finally (iv) a cooling system, that condenses the stream and closes the cycle. Figure 5.13 shows
the heat injection Qin, the power generation Wout , and the heat rejection Qout . Consequently,
the condensation process could be coupled with a heat exchanger in order to supply the heat
required to supply low-temperature heat for the hydro-metallurgical process.
5.4.3 Results analysis
The heat supply analysis from a CSP plant for the mining process that uses low-temperature
heat was carried out considering the operational costs. To secure the dispatchability of heat,
hot water storage tanks must be employed. Here the main difference is the primary source of
energy used to generate heat. The analysis focuses on comparing the excess heat that needs
to be released in the condensation process of the power block of the CSP plant, with the
use of imported crude oil or diesel from China, Canada, U.S.A, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil,
Peru or Argentina, with fluctuating prices, expensive cost, highly contaminant, and a complex
logistic chain, that is typically used for these applications in copper mines in Northern Chile.
Nevertheless, both systems use components that can be similar, like hot water storage tanks.
Then, a more detailed analysis is required to be carried out for each application. As a simple
exploration, the main components for both systems are:
 Heat from diesel heaters:
 Ships to transport crude oil or diesel from abroad to a refinery in Chile, and ships
and/or trucks to transport the diesel from refineries or ports to the copper mines in
Northern Chile.
 Diesel storage tanks.
 Heaters that burn diesel to heat water to around 90C.
 Hot water storage tanks and pipelines.
 Heat from excess heat from CSP plant:
 Large pipelines to pump hot water from the CSP plant to the mining operation (the
length will depend on the location of both plants).
 Hot water storage tanks and pipelines.
Figure 5.13 represent the thermodynamic cycle to generate power through the turbine of the
concentrating solar power plant. In this case, point 4 represent the thermodynamic state after
the turbine and before the condenser. This saturated stream (with a steam quality close to 95%)
5.4. Heat supply for low-temperature heating processes in copper mines 102
could be used in a heat exchanger as a heat injection for the electrowinning process. In addition,
the diagram shows the enthalpies of points 3 and 4, corresponding to the input and output of the
turbine. Then, the difference between points 4 and 3 represents the power that can be generated
by the turbine in kJ per kg, i.e. wout = h4h3 823 kJkg1. Next, if the power block produces
60 MW (1 MW = 103 kJs1), the mass flow rate required is m 73 kgs1. Here we consider
a heat supply to the electrowinning process of QEW = 15 MWth, then, point 5 in the diagram
can be calculated by QEW = m  (h4h5).
Finally, the levelised cost of the thermal energy supplied to the system can be estimated by
calculating the investment (ICHX ) of the heat exchanger unit required (as a function of the
total exchange area in m2 and the working pressure in bar) (Michalski et al., 2019), and the
operational and maintenance costs (O&MHX ).
ICHX = (2546.9 A0.67HE P

O&MHX = 10%  ICHX (5.15)
Then, the present value of the total life cycle costs involved in the generation of each unit of
thermal energy during the lifetime, considering an annual interest rate r=7%, and a lifetime
T=25 years, is:
LCOEth  1.1
(5.16)
5.4.4 Discussion
To compare with the current situation, where the heat is supplied by the combustion of diesel,
considering the following parameters reported by Quiones et al. (2020): lower heating value
10.63 MWhm3, diesel cost of 54 USDMWh1th in Northern Chile, heater efficiency of 78%,
then, the operational cost per MWh of heat produced from the combustion of diesel is close
to 70 USDMWh1. Hence, the heat supply for low-temperature heating processes from the
heat rejection of the CSP plant is highly recommended in order to reduce total operating costs.
In addition, the use of solar energy to supply the heat required for low-temperature processes
in Spence can avoid the emissions of approximately 40 kton CO2e per year (Quiones et al.,
2020). Finally, the correct design of the process needs to consider the location where the heat is
available in the CSP plant, and where the heat is needed in the copper mine. Then, the pipeline
and pumping systems have to be considered in a more detailed evaluation.

5.5.1 Introduction
In this study, the analysis of a grid connected hybrid power plant that supplies energy to El
Abra copper mine will be analysed. El Abra copper mine is a large scale copper mine located
in the Atacama Desert (Figure 5.1) with an annual average power consumption close to 70 MW
(Figure 5.3).
Here, the integration of a wind farm into a hybrid solar power plant is examined. The com-
bination of wind and solar technologies reduces the variability of the natural resources used
in the energy conversion process. Figure 5.14 shows the new configuration analysed in this
study. The diagram represents a grid-connected power plant that integrates a CSP plant with
TES, a solar PV and a wind farm. In addition, electrical batteries are employed as an electrical
energy storage system to increase the dispatchability. Hence, the new design variables in this
configuration are the number of turbines in the wind park (NTurb), and the capacity of the
battery system (EEES,max). In terms of the operational optimisation variables, these are related
to the power flows between each subsystem.
5.5. Integration of a wind farm into a hybrid solar power plant 105
5.5.2 Optimisation Implementation
The information used to model the wind farm in the Python code for the design and operational
optimisation stages was obtained from a wind park in operation located in the Atacama Desert.
This wind farm is known as Sierra Gorda wind farm, and its location is shown in Figure 5.1.
The following is a summary of the main data:
 Sierra Gorda Wind Farm
 Location: Antofagasta Region, Chile S22W69
 Wind Resource (Ministerio de Energia and Universidad de Chile, 2016)

 Average wind speed: 6.1 m s1
 Wind Farm (Servicio de Evaluacin Ambiental, 2014)
 56 wind turbines
 Gamesa G114-STD, 2 MW nominal power
 Total investment: 260 MUSD
Figure 5.15 displays the daily average wind speed in the location under consideration. The
figure illustrates a more abundant wind resource during winter months (July-September), com-
pared with the solar irradiation that is more abundant during summer. It is expected that this
difference is beneficial in the integration of wind with solar technologies. The Matrix 5.17
represents the correlation matrix between the solar resource (DNI and GTI) and the wind
resource. Here, a high correlation between DNI and GTI represents the availability of solar
resource during the day and the direct relationship between DNI and GTI. On the contrary,
the low correlation between solar and wind resources represents the independent relationship
between the energy conversion capacities of both technologies. In the case that a permanent
power supply is required, a low correlation between the natural resources means that the
synergies between the technologies could play an essential role in the optimal operation and
affordability of the power plant.

The power curve shown in Figure 5.16 was created by using the data available from the
manufacturer (Siemens, 2018), and integrated into the operational optimisation model. The
polynomial function presented in the figure relates the output power of the turbine to the wind
speed. Thus, this function is used in the model to estimate the power generated by each turbine
based on wind speed.

Table 5.8 shows the variables considered in the design optimisation stage. Here, the multi-
objective design optimisation stage optimises the following objectives: (i) levelised cost of
energy; (ii) greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) loss of power supply capacity. Finally, in order
to link both stages, the multi-objective operational optimisation by linear programming will be
developed by the linear scalarisation method, according to:
Max ENeti 1 LPSi2 GHG
i (5.18)
In this case, a third objective is added to the analysis. The incorporation of a third objective
increases the complexity of the selection of the best point in the Pareto optimal solutions.
In order to simplify this decision, a number of designs were evaluated, considering different
combinations of 1 and 2. The results concluded that 1 = 1 and 2 = 1 are suitable scaling
factors that simultaneously select an operational strategy that maximise the energy dispatched,
minimise the loss of power supply, and minimise the greenhouse gas emissions.
5.5.3 Results analysis and discussion
In order to calculate the benefits in the integration of wind with solar technologies, two different
case studies were evaluated. The first case study corresponds to a hybrid solar power plant with
TES, fossil backup and EES. Then, the second configuration considers the integration of a wind
farm. Figure 5.17 displays the three-dimensional Pareto non-dominated solutions. As can be
observed, the integration of a wind farm allows an improvement of both technical and financial
performance. This enhancement can be assessed by the displacement of the points and curve
towards the bottom left corner of the diagram, which is the desirable zone. To have a more
accurate comprehension and contrast, Figure 5.18 exposes the performance (using normalised
values) of 4 different designs. Two of them are hybrid solar technologies, and two integrate
also a wind farm with the solar power plant. These four designs are shown in Figure 5.17
highlighted with red circles, corresponding to designs with LPSP close to 0.5 and 1%. First,
for the same level of dispatchability, the integration of wind allows a decrease in the LCOE
of almost 10 USDMWh1. This reduction is achieved by the integration of 28 or 29 wind
turbines, and a decrease in most of the components of the hybrid solar power plant (the number

Figure 5.17: Design optimisation results of a hybrid solar power plant with a wind farm
of heliostats, the capacity of the power block, the capacity of the fossil backup unit, and the
number of PV modules). The results also show that a small battery system is suggested in
both configurations. For example, a 38 MWh battery system (as illustrated in the figure) can
supply power for about 32 minutes in case a power of 70 MW is required (equivalent to El
Abras average power consumption). Finally, despite that the investment is not considered as
an objective in the design optimisation stage, it is comparable for both alternatives.
It is worth to mention that each Pareto optimal set of solutions is achieved in around 40 h
(using the computer detailed in Section 3.7). Thus, in order to reduce the computational time
required to perform the design optimisation by genetic algorithms, a data clustering technique
is proposed and studied in Appendix A. Then, the data clustering framework developed will be
evaluated and compared with the results presented in this section.
5.6 Conclusions
This chapter investigates synergies of technology integration by the analysis of different case
studies. The configurations studied were located in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile.
Here, off-grid and grid connected power configurations that supply energy to two large-scale
mining operations were investigated.
First, due to the low cost of solar PV, and the expected reduction in the cost of batteries, Section
5.2 analysed the combination of a solar power plant with thermal and electrical energy storage,
5.6. Conclusions 109
Figure 5.18: Performance of selected optimal designs of a hybrid solar power plant with a

and a long-term cost analysis was addressed. The results confirm that currently, CSP with TES
is the most competitive technology to provide affordable and dispatchable power. However,
due to the extreme reduction expected in the cost of EES systems, a shift to PV with EES is
anticipated.
Second, some studies suggest that the integration of a fossil backup unit is key to increase
the dispatchability and affordability of solar power technologies. Section 5.3 analysed the
integration of a fossil backup unit to supply heat to the thermal energy storage system of the
CSP plant. In this study, an off-grid configuration was considered; hence, the dispatchability
becomes a crucial variable. An important finding revealed in this analysis is that the optimal
design of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants considers a small fossil backup unit. This
outcome can be related to the high levels of solar irradiation, the constant power demand, and
the high costs of diesel in the Atacama Desert.
Section 5.4 evaluated the heat supply for low-temperature mining processes from the heat
rejection of the Rankine cycle of the CSP plant. The technical feasibility of this project depends
on the location of the power plant and the mining processes that require heat. Nevertheless, the
high cost of diesel in the Atacama Region is a fundamental variable. The results suggest that
the heat supply for low-temperature heating processes from the heat rejection of the CSP plant
is highly recommended to reduce operational costs of mining processes.
Finally, due to CSP and PV plants work with solar irradiation, the integration of a Wind farm is
analysed in Section 5.5. The combination of these technologies decrease the variability of the

renewable resource used in the hybrid power plant. The results confirmed that the deployment
of hybrid power plants considering three (or more) different renewable technologies enhance
the competitivity of distributed sustainable power plants.
Chapter 6
Multi-objective operational
optimisation of a hybrid solar power
plant with thermochemical energy
storage
The work presented in this chapter is based on an article published in the Journal Energy
Conversion and Management (Bravo, Ortiz, Chacartegui, and Friedrich, 2019)
In this work, C.Ortiz provided details and results of Aspen simulations, and all authors co-
operated with the analysis.
6.1 Introduction
To increase the penetration of solar technologies in the power sector, the integration of en-
ergy storage is essential. Concentrated solar power technologies (CSP) integrated with energy
storage are key systems that could provide clean and dispatchable energy (Ortiz et al., 2017).
Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) integrated with concentrated solar and photovoltaic
power plants, has the potential to provide dispatchable and competitive energy. Hence, in this
chapter, the integration of TCES into CSP plants is analysed and optimised. Here the multi-
objective operational optimisation method is applied to find the best operational strategy of a
hybrid solar power plant with a TCES system. The model uses the typical meteorological year
to optimise one-year hourly operation.
The results demonstrate that the integration of a calcium-looping process as TCES in a con-
centrated solar power plant provides dispatchability and, when hybridised with PV, enhances
its competitiveness with current electricity prices. The low mismatch between supply and
demand, even when a fixed commitment is required throughout the year, together with high
overall efficiency, indicate that the integration of calcium-looping in hybrid solar power plants
6.1. Introduction 112
is an opportunity to increase the penetration of solar energy in the power sector. Through the
optimisation framework presented, a seasonal energy storage analysis could be developed.
TCES uses the heat of reaction of a reversible chemical reaction that absorbs and rejects energy
depending on the operation (Pardo et al., 2014). Calcium-Looping (CaL) is a promising TCES
technology that can be integrated into concentrated solar power plants. CaL is based on the
calcination/carbonation of calcite, and it works at high temperatures. Hence, it is an attractive
and efficient technology to integrate into CSP plants (Ortiz et al., 2019a). This process is based
on the following reaction that involves calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium oxide (CaO) and
carbon dioxide (CO2):
CaCO3(s) CaO(s)+CO2(g) H
r = 178 kJ mol
1 (6.1)
The integration of CaL as an energy storage system into CSP plants has several benefits.
For instance, because of its high energy density, a relatively small storage volume has the
potential to operate as long-term energy storage. Besides, the precursor materials used in
the process, such as limestone or dolomite, are an abundant, non-corrosive, non-toxic and
cheap (Chacartegui et al., 2016). In order to decrease the deactivation of the material due to a
multi-cyclic operation, modified materials can be used in the process (Obermeier et al., 2017).
In this context, Ortiz et al. (2019a) compares different materials and conditions to enhance
the multicycle CaO conversion. Hence, the integration of a CaL in CSP plants is a suitable
sustainable alternative to provide dispatchable power.
In order to evaluate the dispatchability of solar power plants integrated with CaL as a TCES,
current studies focus on the simulation of the operation using a typical period to estimate
the operation of a whole year (Ortiz et al., 2018a; Fernndez et al., 2019b), e.g. one or two
representative days with hourly time steps. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that, in order to
consider daily and seasonal variability of the solar resource, a one year with hourly time steps
simulation is crucial to evaluate the operation of the solar power plant under variable solar
irradiation (Ortiz et al., 2018a).
Consequently, the multi-objective operational optimisation of the hybrid power plant with CaL
considering one-year hourly time-steps is the main focus of the present chapter. Here the
operational optimisation aims to find the best operational strategy by maximising both the
energy supplied and the dispatchability, two goals that during some periods of the year are
conflicting objectives.
6.2. Methodology, plant modelling 113
6.2 Methodology, plant modelling
This study exploits the capacity of linear programming to optimise the annual performance of
the power plant, taking into account the daily and seasonal variability of the solar resource. The
CaL process is modelled as mass and energy balances as a function of the mass flow rate and
temperature, as explained in Chapter 3. Besides, the thermodynamic properties also depend
on the temperature. Then, the temperature of each process is fixed and defined according to
a non-linear study published by Ortiz et al. (2018a). The Pareto frontier resulting from the
multi-objective optimisation method represents the trade-off between the net energy dispatched
(GWhyear1) (that influences the levelised cost of the electricity), and the mismatch between
supply and demand, estimated here through the loss of power supply capacity (GWhyear1).
Finally, to handle both objectives, the linear scalarisation method is applied.
Figure 6.1 represents the process involved in the generation of electricity through the use of
a CaL process integrated with a CSP and hybridised with a PV plant. The CSP-CaL scheme
(and nomenclature) is taken from the base case proposed by Ortiz et al. (2018a). Each stream
is represented by a letter and a number, where the letter defines the type of substance (g: CO2;
c: CaO; s: solids CaO+CaCO3), and the number indicates the position of the stream in the
diagram. In addition, the diagram shows the temperature of each process according to the non-
linear analysis (Ortiz et al., 2018a). The Python model developed uses real solar irradiation as
input, and by linear programming, optimises the annual hourly operation of a defined power
plant (CSP with CaL plus PV). In this study, the algorithm optimises the operation, while
the optimal design or sizing of the components is performed in Chapter 7. Consequently, the
capacity of each component (shown in the black ovals in the figure) is an input to the model.
In the model, the CSP is a solar tower technology that provides heat to carry out the endother-
mic reaction that splits CaCO3 into CaO and CO2 at 900 C, according to equation 6.1. The
location where this reaction takes place is known as calciner and coincides with the solar
receiver. Full calcination is assumed in the model (Meier et al., 2005). CaO exiting the calciner
is stored at atmospheric pressure and high temperature in an insulated tank. The atmosphere
inside the CaO tank is regulated by injecting an inert gas such as N2 or He, in order to reduce
the presence of CO2 and avoid partial carbonation (Ortiz et al., 2019a). Moreover, it must be
highlighted that the CaO tank is maintained at 900 C and the kinetics of carbonation near
to the equilibrium is notably slow, which reduces the likelihood to have partial carbonation
inside the CaO tank (Ortiz et al., 2018c; Kyaw et al., 1998). The second stream that exits
the calciner, consisting of pure CO2 at 900 C, first exchanges heat in a Heat Recovery Steam
Generator (HRSG) to produce electricity. Next, the CO2 leaves the heat exchanger and it cooled
to approximately 40 C to improve the efficiency of the compression process that is occurring
afterwards. After the main compressor, this stream (now with a pressure of approximately
3 bar) has two possibilities: (i) it can be used in the carbonator to produce the reversible
exothermic reaction (carbonation) where it reacts with CaO from the CaO storage tank forming
6.2. Methodology, plant modelling 114
Figure 6.1: Mass and energy flows model of a hybrid solar power plant with calcium-looping
TCES system
CaCO3 and releasing heat according to the previous reaction; (ii) it can be stored at high
pressure in a 75 bar vessel, by using a multi-stage compressor. Then, when power needs to
be dispatched, this high-pressure stream first drives a turbine to generate electricity and then
mixes with the stream flowing from the power loop. This flow is heated in a regenerative
system, which reaches around 654 C and is then sent to the carbonator to drive the exothermic
reaction described above. The storage of solids is carried out under atmospheric pressure. A
mechanical conveyor system is considered here to transport the material. Hence, in order to
decouple the pressure between solids storage tanks (1 bar) and carbonator (3 bar), lock hoppers
are used in the conveyor system (Ortiz et al., 2018a).
The CaO conversion (X) in the carbonator is highly dependent on the reactor conditions (pres-
sure, temperature, CO2 volume fraction) and the CaO precursor used (Ortiz et al., 2019a). In
this work, a conservative value of X=0.15 is assumed. The heat released from the reaction
is taken by the CO2 that is present in excess in the carbonator. After that, this pure CO2
stream runs a gas turbine (main turbine) to produce electricity that is used to drive the main
compressor, and the surplus is dispatched to the network. The CO2 leaves the turbine at 1 bar
and approximately 700 C and then it exchanges heat in the regenerative system to increase the
temperature of the CO2 stream before entering the carbonator. Then, the CO2 flow described
above is cooled to 40 C to be compressed in the main compressor, closing the cycle (see Figure
6.1).
6.2. Methodology, plant modelling 115
6.2.1 Operational optimisation by linear programming
The mass and energy balances presented in Chapter 3 were used here to model the operation
of the main processes of the power plant. The main components are the solar field (heliostats
and receiver), reactors (carbonator and calciner), heat exchangers, coolers, compressors and
turbines.
The main objective of this research is to model the operation of one year (8760 time-steps),
considering the hourly solar resource of a typical meteorological year. To linearise the equa-
tions presented above, the temperatures of the processes are fixed, according to the parameters
and results presented in (Ortiz et al., 2018a), were non-linear models are used to simulate the
operation of the CSP plant with CaL. In a power plant, this may be possible by the instrumenta-
tion engineering, through the definition and control of the temperatures of each process. Hence,
the operational optimisation routine optimises the mass flow rate of some streams and calculate
those that are dependent (because there are direct relationships between some streams), in order
to optimise the hourly operation.
The optimisation objectives can be defined according to user preferences. In this study, for a
fixed power plant, the objectives of the operational optimisation are defined by:
 Maximisation of the net energy supplied during one year of operation (typical year),
where the hourly net power dispatched is defined by:
PNeti = P
Generated
Own consumption
i (6.2)
 Minimisation of the loss of power supply (LPS), which estimates the mismatch between
the energy supplied and the commitment, i.e. the net power to be dispatched by the power
plant, according to the following equation:
LPSi =
Commitment
Commitment
i > P
0 ,otherwise.
(6.3)
6.2.2 Scalarisation method
In order to handle both objectives, and according to the results presented in Chapter 4, here, a
linear scalarisation method is implemented. In Chapter 4, it was found that the linear scalari-
sation method works faster than the epsilon () constrain method, obtaining the same Pareto
frontier. The only precaution is to choose a suitable scaling factor () to scale the second
objective. Therefore, the function that describes the multi-objective optimisation problem in
the present study is:

6.3 Case Study
To compare the results from the evaluation of the model with Aspen simulations available and
published for Seville, in addition to that a prototype is currently being built in the University of
Seville, the power plant under analysis will be located in Seville, Spain ( N 37.4 , W 6.2 ,
elevation 72 m). Public data available in the "Photovoltaic Geographical information system"
(PVGIS project) of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (European Commission,
2017) is used in this study.
6.3.1 Input data, data quality and preparation
To run the model, the following hourly annual input data is required:
 Direct normal irradiation (DNI)
 Optical efficiency solar field (opt)
 Global tilted irradiation (GTI)
In the present study, the typical meteorological year (TMY) is used as a representative year.
Then, the direct normal irradiation is used to model a solar tower plant in SAM 2019 (NREL,
2018) to estimate the hourly optical efficiency of the heliostat field of the solar tower system.
While values of hourly optical efficiency during summer days are from 0.42 to 0.6, winter day
values are between 0.3 to 0.55, and the annual average value (opt) is around 0.53.
According to the previous equations and relations, the model also needs a series of technical
and financial parameters. Among the technical parameters necessary to run the model are:
efficiencies of each component from NREL (2018), thermodynamic properties of the elements
(as presented in Chapter 3), and operational temperatures and pressures of each process from
Ortiz et al. (2018b). In addition, the model considers thermal efficiencies and heat losses in the
carbonator and heat exchangers. Storage tanks are modelled by mass balances, and heat losses
are considered according to the design of the tanks. Here, the insulation of the storage tanks
is designed to achieve a heat transfer coefficient in the order of 150 Wm2, and its thermal
losses are included as electrical consumption of the power plant, in order to consider the energy
needed if heat injection is required.
Financial parameters used in the model are investment costs (IC) and operational and main-
tenance costs (O&MC) of the solar tower, the CaL system and the photovoltaic system. The
relations used to calculate the IC and O&M costs are summarised in Section 3.6.3.
Finally, the hourly power that the power plant has to dispatch (Pdemandi ) is required to evaluate
the dispatchability.

6.3.3 Linear scalarisation method, definition of 
In the present study, as shown in Table 6.3, different optimisation routines with different 
were evaluated (according to Section 6.2.2). According to equation 6.4,  =0 correspond to
the maximisation of the energy delivered as a single objective. On the other extreme, when
   the optimisation focuses on the minimisation of the loss of power supply. Table 6.3
shows that  = 1 is a suitable scaling factor, that gives the same weight to both objectives,
allowing a simultaneous optimisation of total energy supply and dispatchability. This result
can be explained because both objectives have the same units and the same order of magnitude
in each time step. In the model, there are no penalties or costs for energy not served. In other
cases, for instance, when the cost associated with unserved energy is greater than the cost of

energy generation, a large scaling factor may be more appropriate.
6.3.4 Simulation conditions
According to Figure 6.1, to optimise the annual operation of the power plant, the equipment
sizes have to be known. This section presents a process to estimate the capacities of each main
component using the equations and relationships described in Chapter 3. In Chapter 7, this
method will be improved by applying the two-stage optimisation framework.
To establish a case study it is necessary to define the capacities of the main components of
the solar power plant. The process starts with the definition of the expected average power
dispatched by the CSP+CaL system. In this case, a capacity of 15 MW is defined. Then,
according to the estimated global efficiency value reported in Ortiz et al. (2018a) (CSP,Rec =
0.321), it is possible to estimate the average power needed in the calciner: QCalciner  47 MWth.
Next, using equation 6.5 modified to take into account the average thermal power available in
the calciner (qCalciner) per square meter of the heliostat field, it is possible to have an estimated
value for the heliostat aperture area (ACSP), as shown in equation 6.6:
QCalcineri = DNIi 
opt,s f
receiver ACSPQCurtailmenti (6.5)
QCalciner = ACSP  qCalciner = 47,000 kW (6.6)
where
qCalciner =
opt,s f
receiver DNIi
 0.1089
(6.7)
By using SAM (NREL, 2018) for the simulation of a solar tower located in Seville, the average
thermal power in the receiver per square meter of heliostat reflective area is approximately
0.1032 kWm2. Hence,
ACSP  430,000 m2 (6.8)
Then, with this solar field aperture area, the design capacity of the calciner is calculated
considering the equation given above (with optical efficiency of the solar field: opt,s f  0.53,

receiver efficiency: receiver = 0.85, and direct normal irradiation design: DNIdesign =0.95):
QCalciner,design  180 MWth (6.9)
After that, in order to find the capacities of each component mentioned in section 6.3.4, this
thermal power is used as input in the Aspen model (QCalciner = 180 MWth). Then, the capacities
for each component were obtained and these are shown in table 6.4.
Then, a number of storage hours can be defined to combine with the specific power production
( ) defined in Chapter 3, to estimate the capacity of the CaO storage tank (with CaO  3370
kgm3 (Valverde et al., 2015), and values of porosity and packing density of solids equals to
0.5 and 0.6 respectively). For instance, with 20 hours of storage:

3 (porosity
= 0.5) (Valverde et al., 2015), CO2  762 kgm
3, and a CaO conversion X=0.15, an estimation
of the capacity in m3 of the two other tanks can be calculated as a ratio of STOCaO, where Vm,i
is the molar volume of substance i, defined as the volume occupied by one mole of component
i in the storage tank, by the following relationships:
Vm,i =

As detailed in Section 3.4.2, the storage tanks of the thermochemical energy storage system
6.3. Case Study 120
are initially fully charge. This means that during first hours of operation, the power plant
can dispatch energy even without solar irradiation. Then, to calculate the actual net energy
dispatched, the difference between the available energy in the initial and final periods of the
annual operation is calculated. Hence, the state of charge for each tank at the start of the
operation (i=0) is defined as:
SoCi=0 =

100% CaO tank
0% Solids (CaO+CaCO3) tank
100% CO2 vessel
(6.14)
To calculate this difference, an average energy density factor ( ) is used, defined as the rate
between net power dispatched and CaO mass flow rate that feeds the carbonator:

(6.15)
From the analysis of the results of different optimised designs, i  0.053 MWhton1CaO was
estimated.
Finally, as explained in section 6.2.2, the model was evaluated with  = 0 to maximise the
energy dispatched and the capacities of all components indicated above. By the operational
optimisation routine, it was calculated that the net energy delivered in one year is 118.4 GWh,
and the average power dispatched is 13.5 MW. Therefore, for the following calculations, the
power commitment will be defined as Pcommiti =13.5 MW for all hours of the year.
6.4 Optimisation results and analysis
Nine configurations were analysed to compare the results of different designs, which are sum-
marised in Table 6.5. All configurations are initially composed of a 430,000 m2 of heliostats
field area. The first estimated capacities calculated above are shown as "BC" (base case) con-
figuration. The columns of Table 6.5 show the name given to the configuration (Base Case, A to
H). Then, the power capacity of the steam turbine, the main compressor and turbine capacities,
next, the capacities of the high-pressure compressor and turbine, columns 8 to 10 show the
capacities of the storage tanks, and finally, the photovoltaic solar field area.
In each row, different designs are presented, which are related to the Base Case, and all the
configurations have the same aperture area of the heliostat field. For example, in configuration
A the capacity of each component was increased by 20%, while in configuration B by 50%.
Compressors and turbines of configuration C increase by 50%, and storage remains the same.
Capacities of the storage systems in configuration D were multiplied by 3. Configuration E, F,

G and H are similar to B (50% increase in the capacity of each component), but now integrated
with 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 m2 of a photovoltaic solar field area.
The results of the operational optimisation for all configurations described in Table 6.5 are
presented in Table 6.6. This table shows all configurations and key performance indicators
proposed in Section 3.5.4.
First, the Base Case: according to Table 6.6, for this configuration and considering the typical
meteorological year, the total net energy delivered to the network reaches 118 GWh (97 GWh
dispatched to the commitment and 20 GWh are sent to the grid), and 18% of the commitment
is not supplied. 52 GWhth have to be curtailed in the solar field, and the difference between
the initial and the final hour of operation was 220 MWh (equivalent to approximately 16
hours fulfilling the 13.5 MW commitment). The average net power was 13.4 MW, while the
maximum power dispatched by the system was 22 MW. The capacity factor is 65%, and it is
highly dependent on the capacity of the main components. As a comparison, a capacity factor
of 58% was estimated by Ortiz et al. (2019b) for a CSP with 16 hours of TCES. In Chapter 7,
the capacity factor of this hybrid solar power plant could be improved by the optimisation
of the size of the units. The efficiency based on the energy used in the receiver is 32.8%
(compared with 32.1 estimated by Ortiz et al. (2018a)), and the efficiency based on direct
normal irradiation falls to 12.2%. Finally, the estimated investment is 323 MUSD, and the
operational and maintenance costs are 1.9 MUSD per year, resulting in a levelised cost of
energy of 252 USDMWh1.
Comparing the Base Case with configuration A, the results indicate that by increasing the
capacities of all components by 20%, the net energy increases by 11% and the curtailment is re-
duced by 76%, improving the global efficiency based on the DNI. The LPSP still exceeds 15%,
and although the investment increases by 2%, the LCOE is reduced by 7%. Then, configuration
B (which increases all capacities by 50%), resulted in zero curtailments, which means that in
6.4. Optimisation results and analysis 122
6.4. Optimisation results and analysis 123
this configuration, the design of the CSP-CaL is oversized. These results show the importance
of selecting the right equipment size for the plant efficiency, which will be addressed in Chapter
When comparing configurations B, C and D, it is possible to note that, starting with the Base
Case, an increase in the capacity of compressors and turbines results in more energy dispatched
but a lower dispatchability and capacity factor compared with increasing the storage tank
capacities. Nevertheless, a better approximation to an optimal design would be by appropriate
and independent sizing of all units. Therefore, this enhances the importance of including a
second optimisation stage in order to find the best design based on technical and financial
performances.
Finally, configurations E, F, G and H show that the integration of a photovoltaic system is essen-
tial to reduce the levelised cost of energy, by including intermittent (non-dispatchable) but less
expensive power generation. In these cases, the LCOE becomes less than 200 USDMWh1.
However, the integration of PV without a reduction in the capacities of the CSP-CaL system
means a large energy generation and a large surplus that have to be dispatched to the network.
For instance, in configuration G, which includes 30 hectares of PV modules, the energy dis-
patched to fulfil the commitment is 111 GWh (47% of total). In contrast, the excess of energy
that has to be sent to the grid reaches 124 GWh (53% of total). In this case, it is possible that
the dispatch of the surplus has adverse effects on the local market, and that, depending on the
mechanisms of the market, the energy may not be sold at a competitive price. Nevertheless,
variable electricity prices could easily be added to the model to study the interactions with the
market.
In order to know the power flow profiles of a hybrid solar power plant with thermochemical
energy storage, Figure 6.2 illustrates the time series of power production. The diagram shows
the high amount of electricity generation during summer and the low power dispatch during
cloudy days in winter. As can be seen in the diagram, during some days, the total daily dispatch
is not able to cover the demand required. In addition, Figures 6.3 and 6.4 show two weeks of
operation of configuration G, one week in summer and another in winter along with the solar
resource. The green and orange bars of the diagrams represent the power dispatched by the
PV system and the CSP-CaL, respectively. The continuous purple line and the dashed black
line show the solar irradiation (direct normal and global tilted respectively), for the location
under study. These results highlight that the strategy suggested by the optimisation routine is
that the photovoltaic system delivers energy during the day, while the CSP-CaL stores energy
to be dispatched during the night unless there is large solar irradiation available that allows
the CSP-CaL to dispatch energy during day and night (in the case of summer). Besides, these
results demonstrate the importance of the multi-objective optimisation technique presented.
The diagram confirms that the optimised operational strategy simultaneously maximises the
energy delivered and fulfil the commitment. Another crucial finding, shown in the diagram as

a dashed red line, is the state of charge of the CaO storage tank. Because the state of charge
of the storage never reaches 0% during the week presented for the summer, and despite that,
there is no restriction in the maximum capacity that can be dispatched, it could be inferred
that the storage system is oversized compared with the capacities of compressor and turbines.
Besides, the operation profile during winter suggests that some capacities could be increased
in the CSP-CaL system in order to increase the dispatchability of the hybrid plant.
6.4.1 Sensitivity analysis
In this section, a sensitivity analysis will be carried out by varying different financial and
technical parameters, as well as the design of some of the components of configuration G
presented in Table 6.6. The parameters selected for the sensitivity analysis and its original
values are shown in table 6.7.

Figure 6.5: Sensitivity analysis for the LCOE by varying technical and financial parameters
In this case, because the analysis covers financial and technical parameters, appropriate key
performance indicators are the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and the loss of power supply
probability (LPSP). Figures 6.5 and 6.6 show the sensitivity analysis for the LCOE and LPSP
by varying the parameters described above by minus-plus 10% from the original value reported.
Figure 6.5 indicates that the parameters that have the most significant influence on the LCOE
are the efficiency of the calciner, the interest rate, and the investment cost of reactors. The
efficiency of the calciner increases the thermal energy available in the endothermic reaction,
and the total energy dispatched. For instance, if receiver is increased by 5% (receiver  0.89),
the LCOE decreases by 3%. Next, the interest rate also has a significant influence in the
estimation of the LCOE, for example, if the project can be financed with r  6.3% (instead
of 7%), the LCOE falls by 6%. Finally, a reduction in 10% in the capital cost of the reactors
(calciner and carbonator) decreases the LCOE by 4%. This reduction is very likely to be
achieved because this technology is at an early stage of maturity.
Furthermore, the LCOE is highly dependent on the location of the power plant. In Chapter 7,
different regions are analysed in order to compare key performance indicators under different
solar resource and market features. For instance, if configuration G (with modifications in the
solar field to keep the total energy available fixed) is analysed under the solar irradiation data
of Atacama-1, a hybrid solar power plant located in Northern Chile, the LCOE drops to 138
USDMWh1 and the LPSP reaches 0.1%.
For the LPSP, by increasing any of the parameters shown in Figure 6.6, the energy dispatched
to fulfil the commitment increases (and the LPSP decreases). Figure 6.6 shows that increasing
6.4. Optimisation results and analysis 127
Figure 6.6: Sensitivity analysis for the LPSP by varying technical parameters
the efficiency of the calciner or the capacity of the storage is indispensable to increase the dis-
patchability. Finally, the results and diagrams suggest that by increasing the storage capacities,
it is possible to dispatch a similar amount of energy. When large storage capacity is available,
it is possible to manage the time when energy is dispatched, increasing the dispatchability of
the power plant, allowing a long-term energy storage capacity.
6.5 Conclusions
In this chapter, the operation of a concentrated solar power plant integrated with a calcium-
looping (CaL) process as a thermochemical energy storage system is analysed and optimised.
Here, the linear programming model of the operation of the power plant is validated against the
software Aspen Plus. Different designs and the hybridisation with a photovoltaic system were
evaluated. This contribution provides relevant information to make renewable energy systems
affordable and reliable. Besides, this framework enables long-term studies for the optimisation
of the operation of solar power plants with thermochemical energy storage and their integration
into energy systems.
The results summarise key indicators obtained by optimising the operation of a power plant
located in Seville, Spain, using the solar irradiation data of the typical meteorological year as
an input. Besides, by changing the input data, it is possible to find the best strategy to operate
similar solar power plants in any location.
The findings of this study indicate that the use of a thermochemical energy storage system
6.5. Conclusions 128
in concentrated solar power plants increases the dispatchability, and by hybridising with a
photovoltaic system, it can become cost-competitive. However, the significant differences in
the solar irradiation in Seville between summer and winter could have a negative effect on the
power system during summer by dispatching a large amount of power during the day.
The research highlights the importance of the multi-objective optimisation of the operation of a
renewable power plant to reduce the fluctuations and maximise the energy delivered, which also
influences the levelised cost of energy. When the design of the main components of the CaL is
oversized (keeping the solar field fixed), less energy has to be curtailed, and more energy can
be dispatched. However, this requires larger investments and results in lower capacity factors.
Therefore a proper balance between capacities and curtailed energy should be pursued. Besides,
it was found that the integration of a large CaL system, which can store a more substantial
amount of energy, results in a significant increase in the dispatchability and the capacity factor.
This means that a large storage system can work as a medium-term or even long-term energy
storage system. Similar to the previous point, higher energy storage capacity requires more
considerable investment.
The hybridisation with a photovoltaic system has beneficial effects. Because a larger solar field
area is available, there is an improvement in both the energy dispatched and dispatchability.
Besides, the operational strategy allows that during the day the PV dispatches power while
the CSP stores energy, and during the night the CSP could dispatch, reducing the mismatch
between supply and demand when no solar irradiation is available. Because PV is cheaper
compared with CSP, the hybridisation results in a global reduction in the levelised cost of
energy.
This study is the first step to improve the modelling and optimisation of the integration of CaL
as a thermochemical energy storage system in hybrid solar power plants. In the next chapter, the
design optimisation is developed in order to define the best capacities of the main components
of the power plant. This second stage allows us to exploit synergies related to the dispatchability
of CSP-CaL and affordability of PV systems.
Chapter 7
Multi-objective optimisation for the
design of dispatchable hybrid solar
power plants with thermochemical
energy storage
The work presented in this chapter is based on an article published in the Journal Applied
Energy (Bravo, Ortiz, Chacartegui, and Friedrich, 2021).
In this work, all authors collaborated with the analysis.
7.1 Introduction
As concluded in Chapter 6, thermochemical energy storage (TCES) integrated into concentrat-
ing solar power (CSP) plants can enhance dispatchability and solar-to-electricity efficiency.
Combining these technologies with lower cost photovoltaic (PV) plants exploits synergies
between dispatchability of CSP with TCES and cost of PV. However, this combination leads to
complex interactions between the different plants and requires sophisticated design guidelines
to simultaneously achieve low costs and high dispatchability.
In this chapter, the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework is applied for the optimal
design of hybrid CSP-PV plants with Calcium-Looping (CaL) TCES with respect to competing
technical and financial performances. The first stage, design optimisation stage evaluates ten
design variables and three objectives. The second stage, applied and analysed in detail in
Chapter 6, finds the best one-year hourly operational strategy for each design defined in the
first stage.
The design and operational optimisations consider technical and economic performance to
design a dispatchable and cost-competitive power plant, exploiting synergies of CSP with
CaL (dispatchability) and PV (affordability). The proposed framework provides a systematic
7.1. Introduction 130
methodology and guidelines for the design of dispatchable power plants which takes the yearly
operation into account and goes beyond a manual design process.
To analyse potential locations for further deployment of solar plants with TCES, the following
locations which cover a range of different profiles will be evaluated: Seville, Spain; Tonopah,
Nevada, United States; and the Atacama Desert, Chile. According to Figure 7.1, that shows the
direct normal irradiation world map, Northern Chile has one of the highest solar irradiations
in the world. Besides, Nevada and Southern Spain are among the sunniest region in the United
States and Europe respectively.
Figure 7.1: World map of direct normal irradiation and three locations studied in Chapter 7
The best dispatchable hybrid solar power plant with an LCOE of 123 USDMWh1 and a
capacity factor of 73% is reached for the Atacama Desert, which has the best solar resource.
The optimisation results are used to develop guidelines for the optimal design of dispatchable
hybrid solar power plants with TCES based on the given solar resource and required dispatch-
ability. These guidelines provide an initial design for affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar
power plants and can enable their widespread deployment.
7.2. Methodology, plant modelling 131
7.2 Methodology, plant modelling
In order to design an affordable and dispatchable solar power plant, the trade-off between
financial and technical performances has to be examined. While an oversized CSP plant can
give us full dispatchability at a high LCOE, a PV plant will be more affordable, but not dis-
patchable. These conflicting objectives are handled by a multi-objective optimisation method
which produces a range of non-dominated or Pareto optimal solutions. To carry out the design
optimisation stage, the two-stage optimisation framework developed is extended for the hybrid
CSP-PV with TCES plant. Figure 7.2 shows the procedure adapted for the present research.
Figure 7.2: Schematic of the two-stage optimisation applied for the optimal design and
operation of a hybrid CSP-PV with TCES system
This framework uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise the design of the power plant
under techno-economic objectives. The use of genetic algorithms allows us to handle non-
convex objectives and several variables. As can be seen in Figure 7.2, GA starts with an
initial population, where each individual represents a power plant with given capacities. Then,
each individual design in the population is optimised by using the operational optimisation by
linear programming presented in Chapter 6. After the operational optimisation is performed,
the investment cost, LCOE, and LPSC are calculated and used by the GA to perform the fitness
evaluation. After that, the genetic operators work to define the best offspring and then a new
generation is produced. Finally, the stopping criteria used in our model is when the number
of generations reaches a defined value. For the present research, real solar irradiation data is
used as input, and it can be easily modified to evaluate any location. The multi-objective design
optimisation produces a range of Pareto optimal solutions, representing the trade-off between
objectives.

7.2.1 Simulation conditions
The design of the power plant is given by the size of the components shown in Table 7.1, which
are defined as variables in the design optimisation routine.
Figure 7.3: Mass and energy balances model of the hybrid solar power plant with CaL as
The design variables are shown in the red ovals in Figure 7.3. The combination of these
variables will result in a power plant with known capacities. Then, the initial investment is
calculated with the relations presented in Chapter 3. Next, the operational optimisation by linear
programming and nested as a fitness function in the genetic algorithm defines the best opera-
tional strategy, maximising the net energy dispatched and minimising the mismatch between
generation and commitment. Finally, three indicators (detailed in Section 7.2.2) are considered
as objectives of the design optimisation stage and used by the genetic operators.
7.2. Methodology, plant modelling 133
7.2.2 Construction of indicators to characterise financial and technical perfor-
mance
As stated previously, the design optimisation aims to select the optimal sizes of the components
to design an affordable and dispatchable power plant. In this study, the investment cost and
the LCOE are employed to measure the affordability while the loss of power supply capacity
(LPSC) is used to measure the dispatchability. The LCOE is a crucial indicator that represents
the cost of each electricity unit generated over the lifetime of the power plant considering the
total life cycle costs, while the investment cost is essential when defining a limiting initial
budget for the feasibility of a project. The LPSC measures the mismatch between the net
electricity supply and a constant demand (details on the demand are given below at the end
of this section).
The total investment cost is estimated using the references summarised in Section 3.6.3. The
LCOE is calculated by Equation 3.1, where values for the annual interest rate and a lifetime
of r=7% and T=25 years are used. To measure the ability to supply energy when it is needed
(dispatchability), the loss of power supply (LPS), that measures the mismatch between supply
and commitment as defined in Equation 3.30, is used.
To compare the results with the non-optimised hybrid solar power plants presented in Chapter
6, here, a permanent power commitment is defined. Moreover, to avoid an oversize PV plant,
and hence, a significant difference in the dispatch between day and night, the operational
optimisation model was constrained by defining a maximum power dispatch five times the
commitment.
Pcommitmenti = 13.5 MW, i (7.1)
Pneti  67.5MW, i (7.2)
Nevertheless, these capacities can be defined by the user according to the objectives pursued
and the transmission constraints of the power plant.
The LPS is summed to the loss of power supply capacity (LPSC) which is used in the optimi-
sation framework. To facilitate the final analysis, the LPSC value is reported as a percentage of
the annual commitment which is given by the loss of power supply probability (LPSP, Equation
7.4).
LPSC =
LPSi (7.3)
LPSP =
PCommitmenti 8760
(7.4)
According to Equation 3.1, the LCOE is directly related to the investment, and more significant
investment should result in a larger LCOE. Nevertheless, power plants with different designs
7.2. Methodology, plant modelling 134
but similar investments can dispatch different amounts of energy. Hence, a direct correlation
between investment and LCOE is not always guaranteed.
7.2.3 Fitness function for the design optimisation
The multi-objective linear scalarisation model for the operational optimisation exposed in
Chapter 6 is nested as a fitness function, linking the objectives of both levels. The operational
optimisation routine simultaneously maximises the energy dispatched and minimises the mis-
match between supply and demand. The use of linear programming ensures a good approx-
imation of the best operational strategy for one year of operation, considering variable solar
resource, in a reasonable computational time. Hence, the operation of each individual design
of the genetic algorithm stage is optimised, considering one-year hourly solar irradiation.
7.3 Case studies
To analyse and compare the performance of hybrid solar power plants with calcium-looping
thermochemical energy storage, and to evaluate the opportunities in the integration of clean
technologies to support the transition to a sustainable energy system under different conditions,
the model will be evaluated in three locations:
 Seville, Spain,  37.4N,6.3W
 Tonopah, Nevada, United States,  38N,117W
 Atacama Desert, Chile,  22N,69W
The evaluation in each location will result in a distinctive 3-D Pareto surface illustrating the
performance expected of an optimised set of different designs in each area. Each point in the
Pareto set is a non-dominated solution or potential candidate. Hence, an a-posteriori evaluation
of optimised designs for each location should be carried out by the user to select the best hybrid
power plant under a trade-off between the objectives or considering other key performance
indicators.
7.3.1 Data quality control and preparation
In the present study, the solar irradiation data was collected using three different open data
sources: (i) Seville, the "Photovoltaic Geographical information system" (PVGIS project) of
the European Commission Joint Research Centre (European Commission, 2017); (ii) Tonopah,
System Advisor Model software (SAM-NREL) (NREL, 2018); (iii) the Atacama Desert, Chilean
Ministry of Energy and University of Chile solar resource data centre (Ministerio de Energia
and Universidad de Chile, 2016).

To estimate the potential and to compare the solar resource in the three locations, Figure 7.4
highlights the direct normal irradiation (DNI) and the global tilted irradiation (GTI) in each
area.
The DNI is the solar irradiation captured by the heliostats of the CSP that track the sun. The
GTI is the irradiation converted into electricity by the PV plant in which each PV module is
non-tracking. Table 7.2 shows the accumulated annual DNI and GTI considering the typical
meteorological year.

Figure 7.4 presents the DNI daily and annual averages, revealing the difference between each
location. Moreover, it can be noted that the variability in the daily DNI of the Atacama Desert
is lower than for the other two locations. To support this statement, the standard deviation ( )
of the daily average calculated for Seville, Tonopah, and the Atacama Desert is 120, 130 and
78 Wm2 respectively. This variability should affect the dispatchability of a CSP plant with
TCES if a fixed commitment is required throughout the year.
The variability is also illustrated in Figure 7.5, that shows the total number of sunshine hours
7.3. Case studies 137
per day with a DNI > 0. While the average (h) is similar for the three locations (hSeville = 10.8
hday1, hTonopah = 10.8 hday1, hAtacama = 11.7 hday1), Figure 7.5 highlights the stable
solar resource of the Atacama Desert, i.e. h,Atacama  1 hday1. In the case of Seville, the
higher standard deviation (h,Seville 3 hday1) shows that there is significantly more variation
in the number of sunshine which is due to larger seasonal variations and more cloudy days in
winter. A similar trend can be identified for Tonopah, with h,Tonopah  2 hday1
All these characteristics for the DNI of each location are highlighted in Figure 7.6. This figure
shows a box plot and a violin plot for the DNI > 0 and GT I > 0 for the selected locations. The
central box in each set of data represents quartiles Q1 and Q3 (percentiles 25th and 75th), and the
variability of the data set can be estimated by the height of the central box, i.e. the interquartile
range or difference between Q3 and Q1. Then, the central orange line of each box represents
the median of the population, or second quartile (Q2, i.e. 50th percentile). Next, the whiskers
show the extreme values, and some outliers in the case of the DNI of the Atacama Desert can
be seen. Besides, the red point located close to the median represents the mean, and at the
bottom can be found the total number of samples greater than 0 (from a total of 8760 hours).
In addition, the violin plot represented by the light blue area shows the probability density of
the samples. For instances, in the case of the DNI of the Atacama Desert, the violin plot shows
that the population is concentrated in the top, corroborating the small variability of the direct
normal irradiation in the Atacama Desert. The same analysis can be done for the GTI, in this
case, the plots show that the means of the GTI follow the same trend than the means of the DNI
(GT IAtacama > GT ITonopah > GT ISeville), and the variability can be estimated by the size of the
box, or by the distribution of the sample by analysing the violin plots. It can be seen that the
variability of the GTI is larger, because, as contrary to the DNI, the GTI is the irradiation in a
fixed plane, and even in locations with high solar irradiation, the irradiation in a fixed plane has
a large variability throughout the day.
This detailed analysis gives us an idea of the difference in the design of a dispatchable hybrid
solar power plant with TCES in each location. For instance, it could be inferred that a smaller
CSP-TCES system is required in the Atacama Desert to supply the same energy during the
year. Hence, lower investment and lower LCOE is expected for optimised power plants with a
similar level of dispatchability in the Atacama Desert, then Tonopah, and finally, Seville should
be the most expensive. Moreover, as outlined before, the high variability in the irradiation in
Seville and Tonopah should have a negative effect on the performance of the hybrid solar power
plant.

and LPSP
7.4 Optimisation results and analysis
The two-stage optimisation framework was used to optimise a hybrid solar power plant with
TCES in the selected locations. Here 100 individuals for the initial population are defined
(100 combinations of independent design variables) and 100 generations are used as stopping
criteria. Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9 illustrate the 3-D non-dominated set of solutions at the end of
the process.
In each diagram, the x-axis represents the LPSP, the LCOE is shown in the y-axis, and the third
objective, the investment cost, is illustrated using different colours. The objective of the design
optimisation is to provide affordable and reliable power, so, the goal is to be located in the
bottom left corner in the diagram with low investments. Hence, the diagrams reveal the trade-
off between technical (LPSP) and financial (LCOE and Investment) performances. It should be
noted that 1% in the LPSP is equivalent to 1,182.6 MWh of energy not supplied, or 87.6 hours
where the power plant was not able to dispatch electricity.

7.4.1 Comparison between optimised designs
Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9, illustrate the result of the design optimisation in Seville, Tonopah, and
the Atacama Desert, respectively. Besides, these figures are merged in Figure 7.10 to facilitate
the comparison of the techno-economic performances of optimised power plants. Moreover,
Table 7.3 and Figure 7.11 summarise the economic performance and cost breakdown of highly
dispatchable designs, i.e. LPSP 0 (points Seva, Tona, and Ataa in Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9
respectively).
The breakdown analysis of the LCOE illustrated in Figure 7.11 shown the weights of the CSP-
CaL and the PV plant in the total LCOE. For instance, the LCOE of a highly dispatchable hy-
brid solar power plant in Seville (Seva) can be divided in approximately 100 USDMWh1 cor-
responding to the CSP-CaL plus 42 USDMWh1 for the PV. Additionally, 32 USDMWh1
correspond to indirect costs (e.g. land cost, taxes) and finally, around 10 USDMWh1 of the
LCOE is related to operational and maintenance costs. Then, by focusing on the CSP-CaL, the
most significant expenses correspond to the solar field and tower (25 USDMWh1), and the
power plant (60 USDMWh1). Here the power plant is composed of compressors, turbines,
heat exchanger, and other elements of the CaL process. The breakdown analysis is essential in
the development of initiatives to enable cost reductions of solar power plants by focusing on
the most relevant elements.
As explained previously, all non-dominated solutions (Pareto optimal) represent optimised
designs. To compare a highly dispatchable power plant with a more affordable power plant

in Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9. Then, the characteristics of these 6 points (2 points per location
and three locations) are illustrated in Figure 7.12. The first section of the diagram corresponds
to the objectives and the second section to the variables. Here, the data is scaled regarding
minimum and maximum values of each data set shown. For instance, the LCOE of Tonb can
be estimated as: LCOETonb  (188.1 120.6)  0.5+ 120.6  154 USDMWh
1. The figure
shows the large difference in the economic performance of both designs in the Atacama Desert
compared with Tonopah and Seville.
Then, it is possible to check the capacity and the range in size between both designs in each
location. For instance, the high value in the area of the PV plant for all designs (39.5 ha to
41 ha), which is linked to the commitment and maximum dispatch (transmission constraints),
demonstrates the benefits of hybridising dispatchable CSP with affordable PV. The ranges in the
7.4. Optimisation results and analysis 142

Atacama Desert
area of heliostats and the capacities of each turbine and compressor reveal the requirements to
design dispatchable power plants. Moreover, the diagram shows a positive correlation between
the capacity of each turbine and compressor in the TCES system with the size of the CSP
plant. Finally, the three points with the lowest LCOE in each location show a similar capacity
of storage. The analysis suggests that there is a relationship between the optimised level of
storage for these plants and the net capacity of the Brayton cycle. These interdependences are
studied in Section 7.4.3.
Table 7.4 shows key performance indicators (KPI) of each power plant. These values are cal-
culated by optimising the annual operation of each design under its respective solar irradiation
data. The following KPI were exposed in Chapter 3 to evaluate and compare each design: (i)
Enet : net energy dispatched; (ii) Ecommitment : net energy to cover the commitment; (iii) Eexcess:
electricity dispatched when exceeding the commitment (in this model, the maximum power
that can be dispatched is 5 times the commitment); (iv) Ecurtailed : thermal energy available in
the CSP that has to be curtailed; (v) Pnet : average power dispatched; (vi) PmaxCSP : maximum power
dispatched by the CSP-TCES plant; (vii) CFCSP: capacity factor of the CSP plant referred to
the Brayton cycle (Figure 7.3); (viii) CaL: efficiency related to the thermal energy available in
the calciner ; (ix) CSP,PB: efficiency considering the solar irradiation in the solar field of the
CSP plant to electricity; (x) Pmaxhybrid maximum power dispatched by the hybrid power plant; (xi)
O&M costs: operational and maintenance costs.
These results show that a hybrid solar power plant integrated with CaL has the potential to
provide dispatchable power at a cost competitive with current commercial systems. Besides,

the values obtained are aligned with those reported in Chapter 3 for Atacama. That study
concluded that high dispatchability (LPSP  1%) is achieved with an LCOE closer to 122
USDMWh1. However, the excellent results obtained with the integration of calcium-looping
as TCES process are reached by using natural, widely available and environmentally friendly
raw materials (limestone) instead of the use of molten salts or batteries. The results explore the
integration level of each technology under different conditions, supporting the development of
renewable and dispatchable power plants.
To complete the analysis, time-series results to show the power production for the three power
plants with lowest LPSP are shown in Figures 7.13, 7.14, and 7.15. These diagrams clarify the
potential of the linear programming models developed to achieve the best operational strategy
of the combined hybrid solar power plants and thermochemical energy storage system. As can
be seen in the figures, the results illustrate the power production from the hybrid power plant,
i.e. photovoltaic + concentrating solar power plant with energy storage system, for the three
configurations in each location. The diagrams show the high amount of electricity dispatched
during summer, where high level of solar irradiation is available, and where the dispatch is
constrained by the transmission capacity. On the other hand, a low power is dispatched during
cloudy days in winter.

7.4.2 Correlations and design ranges
Correlations between the objectives and main variables are shown in Figures 7.16, 7.17, and
7.18 for the three locations, to understand the features of optimised power plants in different
areas. Furthermore, the minimum and maximum values of each variable reached in optimised
power plants shown in Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9 are summarised in Table 7.5.

First, according to Figures 7.16 and 7.17, there are significant negative correlations between
LPSP and investment, and between LPSP and LCOE. These numbers suggest that, in Seville
7.4. Optimisation results and analysis 146
Figure 7.16: Correlation matrix for optimal designs in Seville, Spain
Figure 7.17: Correlation matrix for optimal designs in Tonopah, Nevada, USA
and Tonopah, high dispatchability can be reached in power plants with large CSP plants inte-
grated with a large TCES system (see Table 7.5). Moreover, from the low correlation between
investment and APV , significant positive correlation between investment and ACSP, and negative
correlation between LPSP and ACSP, together with the ranges shown in Table 7.5 it can be
inferred that, in Seville and Tonopah, a large PV is always required to keep a low LCOE, and
extra capacity in CSP is required to give dispatchability.
On the contrary, in the Atacama Desert there is a high negative correlation between LCOE and
investment, and between LCOE and APV , as well as a significant positive correlation between
investment and APV , and low correlation between investment and ACSP. These numbers suggest
that a smaller CSP-TCES plant is required to accomplish the commitment (see Table 7.5), and
additional investment in PV results in a considerable reduction in LCOE.
As expected, in the three locations exists a significant negative correlation between LPSP and
the capacity of the TCES system (STOCaO), highlighting the importance of the energy storage
in increasing the dispatchability of the power plant.

7.4.3 Design guidelines based on resource and dispatchability
In this section the results are analysed to develop guidelines to use as a starting point for the
optimal design of a hybrid solar plant with TCES. These guidelines are based on the solar
irradiation of the three locations under study, that covers a range of different solar resources.
First, a large PV will decrease the LCOE in every situation; hence, the optimal design starts by
selecting the largest PV area considering the available land and the maximum power that can
be dispatched as constraints. Then, it is possible to estimate the area of the CSP by evaluating
the following equation:
ACSP 
Pcommitment  (24hs)  (1LPSP)
hs DNIaverage CSP,DNI
(7.5)
where hs correspond to the number of sunshine hours, and the LPSP is the flexibility allowed.
After that, as can be seen in Figure 7.12, there are clear relations between the capacities of
compressors and turbines with the heliostat field area. In this context, the capacity of the steam
turbine of the Rankine cycle, that is directly connected to the CSP plant can be estimated with
the thermal power of the CSP plant, through the following equation:
PST  ACSP DNIaverage CSP,th SSRC (7.6)
where CSP,th  0.36 and SSRC  0.268. Then, the following relations can be inferred from the
optimised designs presented in Figure 7.12:
PMC  3 PST (7.7)
PMT  1.8 PMC (7.8)
PHPSC  0.4 PMC (7.9)
PHPST  0.15 PHPSC (7.10)
7.4. Optimisation results and analysis 148
Finally, the capacity of the energy storage system depends on the relationship between the
storage hours and the capacity of the components. Using a specific power generation previously
reported i.e. i 0.053 MWhton1CaO, the capacity of the CaO storage tank (STO
CaO, in tonCaO)
for each location (points Sevb, Tonb, Atab in Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9 respectively) can be
estimated by the maximum power dispatched from the Brayton cycle (i.e. PBrayton cycle =PMT
PMC), according to the following equation:
STOCaO(tonCaO)
(24hs) PBrayton cycle
(7.11)
Then, considering a CaO  3370kgm3, and values of porosity and packing density of solids
equals to 0.5 and 0.6 respectively (Valverde et al., 2015), allows to evaluate the capacity of the
storage of CaO in units of volume (m3). Finally, the capacity of the storage tank of solids and
CO2 can be estimated by:
STOSolids(m3) 1.02 STOCaO(m3) (7.12)
STOCO2(m3) 0.155 STOCaO(m3) (7.13)
7.4.4 Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed for power plants defined as Seva, Tona, and Ataa in
Figures 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9, to determine the influence of key input parameters on the LCOE
of dispatchable hybrid power plants. The following parameters, and its original values, were
selected for the analysis:
Receiver = 0.85 (7.14)
Reactors = 1 (7.15)
r = 7% (7.16)
where  Reactors is a multiplier used to vary the investment cost of the reactors, i.e. calciner and
carbonator; Receiver is the efficiency of the receiver in the solar tower, where the calciner is
located; and r is the annual interest rate. A summary of the sensitivity analysis results is shown
in Figure 7.19.
First, the effect of a higher receiver efficiency does not produce a large decrease in the LCOE,
because this technical parameter influences both, the LPSP and the LCOE, and these power
plants are optimised considering the base value (Receiver = 0.85). For instance, in the case that
the efficiency is 0.94, the solar field could be reduced, keeping a similar LPSP but reducing the
7.4. Optimisation results and analysis 149
Figure 7.19: Sensitivity analysis for the LCOE by varying technical and financial parameters
LCOE. Hence, for an optimal design of the power plant, a new optimisation will be required
when a key technical input parameters is modified. For instance, for a high receiver efficiency
(Receiver = 0.94) and a 30% decrease in heliostats area in Atacama, the LCOE reduces to 115
USDMWh1 (< 121 USDMWh1), while maintaining the same LPSP. Hence, a further re-
duction can be achieved by increasing the efficiency of the receiver and modifying the capacity
of some components.
In addition, it can be observed that changes in the investment cost of the reactors and the interest
rate have a significant impact on the LCOE. Remarkably, all simulated cases in Atacama (Ata),
even in the worst scenarios proposed in the sensitivity analysis, show promising results in terms
of LCOE and dispatchability.
7.5 Conclusions
Hybrid CSP-PV plants integrated with thermochemical energy storage are promising candi-
dates to provide dispatchable and affordable clean energy but require sophisticated design tools
to achieve this. This chapter presents the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework to
simultaneously optimise the design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant (CSP and PV)
integrated with calcium-looping (CaL) as thermochemical energy storage (TCES) system. The
optimisation results were used to develop general design guidelines for hybrid solar power
plants with TCES systems.
This framework provides key information in the decision-making process for the design of
reliable and affordable power plants, going beyond the often used manual design process. In
addition, the one-year hourly operational optimisation stage which takes the seasonal varia-
tions in solar resource into account provides more suitable designs compared to studies which
7.5. Conclusions 150
use only a short time horizon or typical periods. The optimisation provides key performance
indicators such as affordability, dispatchability, average power supplied, capacity factor, and
efficiencies, to compare the performance of different designs and different locations.
The optimisation framework was applied to three locations with different levels of solar irradi-
ation, i.e. Seville, Spain; Tonopah, Nevada, USA; and the Atacama Desert, Chile, to illustrate
the opportunities in the integration of clean technologies under different conditions. The de-
sign and techno-economic performance of the optimised plants for each location are clearly
defined by the average values and variability of the solar irradiation. Of the three locations,
the Atacama Desert has the highest potential, achieving an LCOE of 123 USDMWh1 for
a highly dispatchable power plant. This shows the impact of the stability and level of solar
irradiation on the design of dispatchable power plants. It also highlights the significant potential
of hybrid solar power plants with efficient energy storage systems to provide cost-competitive,
dispatchable and clean energy.
The results show that the integration of CaL as TCES system increases the dispatchability of
CSP plants with capacity factors as high as 73%, and that the hybridisation with PV plants
is essential to achieve competitive energy costs. The results emphasize the potential of the
integration of different technologies in the design of affordable and dispatchable renewable
power plants to support the transition to a sustainable energy system. While it is clearly shown
that multi-objective optimisation is required to achieve an optimal design, this contribution
provides general information to understand the interactions and synergies between different
technologies, and the opportunities in the development of solar power plants to support the
transition to a sustainable energy system.
The optimal designs for the three locations were used to develop guidelines for the optimal
design of affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with CaL as TCES for any
location. The guidelines provide an affordable hybrid solar power plant with TCES design
based on the solar resource and the required level of dispatchability. While it is only an approx-
imation to the most optimal design, it is an ideal starting point for manual design optimisation
in a process simulator such as Ansys. Thus, it can support the design of more affordable and
dispatchable hybrid solar power plants which are required for the transition to a low carbon
energy system.

Conclusions
This research developed modelling and optimisation tools to optimise the design and operation
of hybrid solar power plants with energy storage and to provide guidelines for the optimal
development of sustainable energy systems under different conditions and requirements.
A review of previous studies on the modelling and optimisation of energy systems with energy
storage was performed to investigate knowledge gaps. The following objectives were identified
and pursued throughout the thesis:
1. To develop a multi-objective optimisation model for the operation of hybrid solar power
plants with energy storage, taking into account the daily and seasonal variability of the
solar resource.
2. To develop a two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework to simultaneously op-
timise the design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant integrated with energy
storage.
3. To investigate the importance of multi-objective optimisation in exploiting synergies by
the integration of dispatchable concentrating solar power systems with energy storage
and low-cost photovoltaic technology.
4. To explore the role of the integration of different technologies in improving the per-
formance of hybrid solar power plants, e.g. sensible heat thermal energy storage (two-
tanks molten salts), thermochemical energy storage (calcium-looping), electrical energy
storage (batteries)
5. To explore characteristics of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants under different solar
conditions and operational requirements.
6. To examine flexibility approaches in increasing the performance of sustainable technolo-
gies to support the transition to an affordable and clean energy system
7. To develop guidelines for the optimal design of hybrid solar power plants based on the
solar resource and required dispatchability.
These objectives have been analysed, developed and achieved in the studies reported in Chap-
ters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this thesis. Summaries of these achievements are given in the following
paragraphs.
8.1. Two-stage design and operational optimisation framework 152
8.1 Two-stage design and operational optimisation framework
The first two objectives were achieved by the framework developed in Chapter 3. Here the
simulation of the operation of a hybrid solar power plant with energy storage was developed
by mass and energy balances, considering each component as well as the interactions between
different subsystems. The operational optimisation model, written in Python and using Pyomo,
considers variables, constraints, and objectives. Here, financial and technical parameters as
well as time-steps are defined as input parameters. Hence, the model can handle different
configuration and requirements. Multi-objective linear programming methods were developed
to evaluate the daily and seasonal behaviour of the system under variable resource. These meth-
ods, -constraint and linear scalarisation were evaluated. Then, due to the faster performance of
the linear scalarisation compared to the -constraint method, an automated linear scalarisation
method was developed.
The design optimisation routine was developed using genetic algorithms. Here, to simultane-
ously optimise the design and operation of the hybrid solar power plant with energy storage,
the multi-objective operational optimisation is nested in the fitness evaluation routine of the
genetic algorithm, and the objectives of both stages are linked in order to exploit synergies
of technology integration. The rest of the objectives were accomplished in all different case
studies analysed in Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7, described below.
8.2 Improvement of a hybrid solar power plant with thermal en-
ergy storage
The first case study, developed in Chapter 4, focused on the application of the two-stage opti-
misation framework for the optimal design of a hybrid solar power plant (CSP-PV) integrated
with a two-tank molten salt technology (sensible heat thermal energy storage system). Here the
automated linear scalarisation method was analysed and used to develop guidelines to future
applications. The framework was applied to analyse and improve the design of a power plant
under construction in Northern Chile. The results showed the importance of energy storage
to improve the dispatchability of solar technologies. Nevertheless, its appropriate design is
essential to provide affordability. Besides, the benefit of the trade-off between technical and
financial performance, achieved by the multi-objective optimisation was demonstrated. The
analysis showed the importance to define direct links between the design and operational
optimisation objectives to exploit synergies of technology integration.
8.3. Technology integration analysis and optimal design of dispatchable power plants153
8.3 Technology integration analysis and optimal design of dis-
patchable power plants
Different technologies were integrated and evaluated in Chapter 5. These case studies, located
in Northern Chile, were analysed by configurations covering off-grid and grid-connected power
plants, which have different requirements and constraints in the operation. Throughout this
evaluation, a long-term cost analysis was addressed, concluding that due to the extreme reduc-
tion expected in the cost of batteries, in the long term, solar PV integrated with electrical energy
storage could be the most competitive technology to provide affordable and dispatchable energy
storage. Then, in order to increase the dispatchability of CSP, the integration of a fossil backup
unit was studied. The results showed that, due to the high level of irradiation in the Atacama
Desert (during summer and winter), the stable demand profile required, and the high costs of
diesel in Northern Chile, small fossil backup units are enough to increase the performance
of hybrid solar power plants. After that, an economic feasibility analysis was carried out to
study the heat supply for low-temperature mining processes from the heat rejection from the
Rankine cycle of the CSP plant. In this case, the results showed that the use of waste heat from
CSP is highly recommended. Nevertheless, the technical feasibility of the project needs to be
addressed considering the location of both, the solar power plant and the mining process where
the heat is required. Finally, in order to reduce the variability of the natural resource, a wind
power station was integrated into the CSP-PV plant, showing that the integration of different
renewable technologies improves the performance of sustainable technologies.
8.4 Operational optimisation of a hybrid solar power plant with
In Chapter 6, the operation of a concentrated solar power plant integrated with a calcium-
looping process as a thermochemical energy storage system was analysed and optimised. Dif-
ferent designs and the hybridisation with a photovoltaic system were evaluated. Besides, the
framework enables long-term studies for the optimisation of the operation of solar power plants
with thermochemical energy storage and their integration into energy systems. The results sum-
marise key indicators obtained by optimising the operation of a power plant located in Seville,
Spain. The findings of this study indicate that the use of a thermochemical energy storage
system in concentrated solar power plants increases the dispatchability, and by hybridising with
a photovoltaic system, it can become cost-competitive. However, the significant differences in
the solar irradiation in Seville between summer and winter could have a negative effect on the
power system during summer by dispatching a large amount of power during the day.
8.5. Design optimisation of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with TCES 154
8.5 Design optimisation of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants
with TCES
In Chapter 7, the two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework was applied for the opti-
mal design of hybrid CSP-PV plants with calcium-looping TCES with respect to competing
technical and financial performances. While the design optimisation stage evaluates ten design
variables and three objectives, the second stage, finds the best one-year hourly operational
strategy for each design. The application of the framework provided a systematic methodology
and guidelines for the design of dispatchable power plants which takes the yearly operation
into account and goes beyond a manual design process. To analyse potential locations for
further deployment of solar plants with TCES, the following locations which cover a range
of different profiles were evaluated: Seville, Spain; Tonopah, Nevada, United States; and the
Atacama Desert, Chile. The optimisation results were used to develop guidelines for the op-
timal design of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with TCES based on the given solar
resource and required dispatchability. These guidelines provide an initial design for affordable
and dispatchable hybrid solar power plants and can enable their widespread development.
8.6 Final discussion
Hybrid CSP-PV plants integrated with energy storage are promising candidates to provide
dispatchable and affordable clean energy but require sophisticated design tools to achieve
this. In this research, a two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework to simultaneously
optimise the design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant (CSP and PV) integrated
with energy storage systems was developed. Different energy storage systems were integrated
into a hybrid solar power plant. Molten-salt sensible thermal energy storage, calcium-looping
thermochemical energy storage, and electrical batteries were implemented into solar power
plants to study the improved performance of solar technologies. In addition, grid-connected
and off-grid power plants were analysed. The optimisation results were used to develop general
design guidelines for hybrid solar power plants with energy systems.
The framework developed provides essential information in the decision-making process for
the design of reliable and affordable power plants, going beyond the often used manual design
process. Besides, the one-year hourly operational optimisation stage which takes the seasonal
variations in solar resource into account provides more suitable designs compared to studies
which use only a short time horizon or typical periods. The optimisation provides key perfor-
mance indicators such as affordability, dispatchability, average power supplied, capacity factor,
and efficiencies, to compare the performance of different designs and different locations.
The optimisation framework was applied to different locations with different levels of solar
irradiation, i.e. Seville, Spain; Tonopah, Nevada, USA; and the Atacama Desert, Chile, to

illustrate the opportunities in the integration of clean technologies under different conditions.
The design and techno-economic performance of the optimised plants for each location are
clearly defined by the average values and variability of the solar irradiation. Of the three
locations, the Atacama Desert has the highest potential, achieving an LCOE close to 120
USDMWh1 for a highly dispatchable power plant integrated with thermal energy storage
(two-tanks molten salts or calcium-looping). The results showed the impact of the stability
and level of solar irradiation on the design of dispatchable power plants. It also highlights
the significant potential of hybrid solar power plants with efficient energy storage systems to
provide cost-competitive, dispatchable and clean energy.
The results confirm that the integration of an energy storage system increases the dispatcha-
bility of CSP plants with capacity factors higher than 70%, and that the hybridisation with PV
plants is essential to achieve competitive energy costs. The results emphasise the potential of
the integration of different technologies in the design of affordable and dispatchable renewable
power plants to support the transition to a sustainable energy system. While it is clearly shown
that multi-objective optimisation is required to achieve an optimal design, this contribution pro-
vides general information to understand the interactions and synergies between the integration
of different technologies, and the opportunities in the development of solar power plants to
support the transition to a sustainable energy system.
The optimal designs analysed in each case study were used to develop guidelines for the
optimal design of affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with energy storage
for any location. The guidelines provide an affordable hybrid solar power plant with energy
storage design based on the solar resource and the required level of dispatchability. While it is
only an approximation to the most optimal design, it is an ideal starting point for manual design
optimisation. Thus, it can support the design of more affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar
power plants which are required for the transition to a low carbon energy system.
Additionally, the model developed can be applied to other locations under different input
parameters and demand profiles. For example, the cost competitiveness of the power plant
would be increased if the demand is higher in summer and lower in winter, which would be
the case for locations with high cooling demand in summer. In contrast, other places like the
Atacama Desert whose demand is driven by the intensive mining industry need an almost
constant supply of electricity throughout the year. Finally, the model can easily be extended
to evaluate different energy conversion and storage technologies to design hybrid power plants
with energy storage. Thus, the optimisation framework can provide valuable information for
the integration of different technologies to support the affordable and sustainable transition to
a clean energy system.
8.7. Recommendations for further work 156
8.7 Recommendations for further work
The work presented in this research can be extended in several ways. Different options with
high potential impacts are discussed in the following sections.
8.7.1 Multiple years and resolution
The case studies presented in this thesis consider a typical meteorological year (TMY) for the
operational optimisation stage. As previously explained, the TMY represents the long term
solar resource of the location under consideration. Hence, the operational optimisation of a
power plant under the TMY does not show the performance of a particular year. Then, in order
to be able to evaluate worst-case scenarios of the performance of hybrid solar power plants, the
operational optimisation considering multiple years is suggested.
Besides, the TMY considered in this research has hourly resolution. However, by analysing a
TMY with shorter resolution (e.g. 30 or 15 minutes), a more detailed operational strategy can
be examined. In this case, the integration of other variables like ramp rates could be useful to
give more applied results. Despite that the current model handles any time frame and resolution,
the evaluation of a more extensive data set will require a more extended evaluation time.
In addition, other facts such as different weather datasets or weather forecasts considering
different conditions in the Atacama Desert can be evaluated. The purpose to evaluate different
designs under similar weather characteristics was done in order to make a comparison between
designs under similar conditions. Nevertheless, it is possible to evaluate extreme conditions,
such us the estimation of failure probabilities using Monte-Carlo methods to construct a prob-
abilistic view of the performance of the system; consider ramp rates and power transients
according to control schemes; analyse the technical performance of the power plant under
climate change scenarios, among others.
8.7.2 Analysis of variable demand
In order to estimate the dispatchability of the power plants analysed in the case studies, this
research considered two options: (i) a fixed commitment; (ii) a commitment equal to the power
demand of a copper mine. In both cases, the commitment is not related with the profile of the
solar resource. Future work will explore the analysis of a variable demand. For example, the
cost competitiveness of a hybrid solar power plant would be increased if the demand is higher in
summer and lower in winter, which would be the case for locations with high cooling demand
in summer (e.g. Seville). In contrast, other places like the Atacama Desert whose demand is
driven by the intensive mining industry need an almost constant supply of electricity throughout
the year.
8.7. Recommendations for further work 157
8.7.3 Demand side management
In order to increase the overall efficiency of a renewable power plant with energy storage,
several studies recommend the integration of demand side management (DSM) strategies. In
this case, demand respond mechanisms focus on changing the profile of the consumer power
requirement by reducing or shifting it to maximise the use of the renewable energy resource.
Here, the configuration is essential to define the problem appropriately. For instance, if DSM
techniques are applied in an off-grid power plant that supplies energy to a copper mine, the
analysis of the power consumption of each process is essential to define the power supply to
operations that can be reduced or delayed, as well as the time that the delay could be performed.
8.7.4 Multi-mode operation
The case studies presented in this research consider the levelised cost of electricity as a metric
to evaluate the financial performance of the power plant. Nevertheless, the ability of CSP with
TES to adapt the power output could be analysed to increase the financial performance of
the power plant. Hence, the participation in electricity markets, considering electricity prices
and other income schemes in the optimisation in order to exploit this feature will need to
be undertaken. For instance, the model can consider variable electricity price as well as other
incomes by providing reserve services to optimise the financial performance of the power plant.
8.7.5 Data clustering
As mentioned in Chapter 5, the computation time taken by the two-stage optimisation was
around 40 hours. Then, the implementation of a data cluster technique, in order to evaluate a
shorter number of time-steps in the operational optimisation stage, become interesting. Here, a
decrease in the number of evaluations required in the operational optimisation routine allows
a drop in the computational time needed to achieve the desired results. Research into solving
this problem is already in progress. The data clustering framework developed is detailed in
Appendix A. Besides, the information displayed in Appendix A presents the results of the
application of the data clustering process in the configuration studied in Section 5.4, i.e. the
integration of a hybrid solar power plant with a wind farm.
8.7.6 Seasonal energy storage
The integration of thermochemical energy storage into hybrid solar power plants present at-
tractive characteristicts and possibilities to be analysed in future studies. Figure 8.1 illustrates
further independent studies intended to be undertaken. These topics are investigated in this and
the following sections.
Thermochemical energy storage has the potential for high energy storage density and no storage
losses, besides the initial loss of the sensible heat. Hence, further investigation of calcium-
8.7. Recommendations for further work 158
looping as seasonal energy storage system is proposed. In this case, heaters will be required
in order to recover the sensible heat lost and to allow the carbonation process to take place.
Here, the volume of the storage system will be crucial to evaluate the economic feasibility of
the configuration.
8.7.7 Use of power curtailment from renewable power plants
The reduction of curtailments from wind and solar PV plants is key to improve the revenue of
renewable power plants (Bird et al., 2014). Curtailment occurs typically due to constrains in
the power transmission sector or excess generation. The fluctuation of the renewable resource
in some areas results in high variability of the power supply to the network. Then, renewable
energy curtailment is an essential mechanism to protect the electrical grid. Future work will
explore the technical and economic feasibility to use the power curtailment from wind or solar
power plants by converting electricity into heat and use it as a heat injection in the calciner of
the calcium-looping system.
8.7.8 Operational parameters of the calcium-looping
In this research, to linearise the variables of the calcium-looping operation, the temperatures
were fixed according to published investigations. Nevertheless, in order to get a broad opera-
tional strategy and general guidelines for the design of thermochemical energy storage systems,
further work considering non-linear models or the evaluation of other operational conditions
need to be done. In this context, temperatures and pressures in each process can be defined as
optimisation variables (instead of input parameters).
8.7.9 Other reversible chemical reactions
In addition, further studies will need to be performed to analyse other reversible chemical reac-
tions suitable to be used as thermochemical energy storage systems. For instance, the reversible
hydration/dehydration reaction of calcium oxide: Ca(OH)2  CaO+H2O, with Hr = 104
kJmol1 (Salas et al., 2018; Pardo et al., 2014).
8.7.10 Calcium-looping as a CO2 capture system
The current model can be modified to perform the analysis of a CO2 capture system based
on calcium-looping. In this case, the flue gas from a fossil-fuelled combustion process is
compressed and conducted to the carbonator, where the CO2 presented reacts with the CaO
from the storage tank, forming CaCO3. Then, while the flue gas (without CO2) is driven to
a turbine and then sent to the atmosphere, the CaCO3 is stored in the storage tank. After
that, the calcination process splits the CaCO3 into CO2 and CaO. Finally, the CO2 can be
compressed and stored for future transport, utilisation or permanent storage. In this work,
8.7. Recommendations for further work 159
8.7. Recommendations for further work 160
further investigation needs to be undertaken to evaluate and define the reaction properties and
kinetics of the carbonation of the CO2-rich flue gas and CaO.
Appendix A
Data clustering
A.1 Introduction
This section focuses on the implementation of a data cluster technique in order to evaluate a
shorter number of time-steps in the operational optimisation stage. This reduction of the total
number of evaluations allows a drop in the computational time required to achieve the desired
results of the design optimisation routine.
The purpose of data clustering is to find groups in data (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 2005). Here,
a cluster is defined as a group of data points that have similar features. Hence, a basic process
for data clustering applied for the problems studied in this thesis, is to find a suitable number
of clusters, and the data points that belong to each clusters.
The silhouette analysis, introduced by Rousseeuw (1987), is a process that helps in the defi-
nition of an optimal number of clusters for a given sample. The silhouette analysis measures
the distance between each data point with the neighbouring clusters, and calculate a numerical
value in the range [-1, 1]. A value close to 1 denotes that the point is distant from the neigh-
bouring clusters; therefore, the observations are very well clustered. Then, a value close to 0
indicates that the point lies on the boundary between two clusters. Finally, a negative value
shows that the data point was probably assigned in the wrong cluster.
Then, to optimise the location of the centroids in each cluster, the k-means algorithm will
be employed. The k-means algorithm, proposed by Macqueen (1967), starts by selecting a
random position of one centroid for each cluster. Then it assigns every data point to the closest
cluster by minimising the sum of the squared distance between each point and a centroid.
Then, the algorithm iterates by re-locating the centroids in the centre of mass, i.e. the location
where the weighted relative position of all points in the cluster sums zero. Then, all data points
are assigned to the new centroids, and a new re-location of the centroids is performed. This
algorithm iterates until the location of the centroids do not change.
Hence, while the k-means algorithm optimises the location of the centroids for a given number
of clusters, the silhouette analysis helps in the definition of an optimal number of clusters for
a given sample. Furthermore, the simultaneous combination of both techniques are applied in
A.1. Introduction 162
Figure A.1: Data clustering. Framework
this study, that gives us a powerful tool to optimise both, the number of clusters and the position
of the centroids that represent the complete data set.
A.2 Implementation
Figure A.1 shows the framework developed for this study. First, the solar resource and the
demand are used as input in the analysis. For a fixed design, the solar resource will determine
the maximum power supplied by the power plant, and then the LCOE. On the other hand, the
power commitment will provide the necessary information to select the best strategy to operate,
considering the opportunity to store energy when there is a benefit in the future. Then, the data
clustering analysis is performed by employing the k-means algorithm and Silhouette analysis.
In order to apply these tools, the variables need to be grouped and normalised. For instance,
equation A.1 shows the grouping process of the solar resource for one day. This equation
considers the estimation of the fraction between the CSP and the PV solar field, here a factor of
2.5 was considered (obtained from the analysis of the previous results presented in Chapter 5).
Then, all variables that vary in each time step are considered: direct normal irradiation, global
tilted irradiation, and the solar-to-electrical efficiency of the CSP and PV plants.

Demandd =
Demandi (A.2)
Here, the data clustering analysis was applied for the optimal design of a power plant that
supplies energy to El Abra copper mine, as studied in Section 5.5. The silhouette analysis
was conducted, and an optimal number of 3 or 8 clusters was suggested, as shown in Figure
A.2. Then, in order to be able to cover more details and interactions between the different
technologies in the operational optimisation routine, a number of 8 clusters was selected. After
that, the optimal location of each centroid is achieved by the k-means algorithm and shown
in Figure A.3. This figure displays the normalised total demand per day in the x-axis, the
normalised solar resource in the y-axis, and each point in the diagram correspond to a single
day defined by both variables. Then, the big red dots correspond to the optimised location of
the centroids obtained by the k-means algorithm. Next, the number that is shown bellow each
centroid corresponds to the total number of samples (n) that belongs to that cluster. Finally, the
closest day to the centroid is identified in the diagram and used as a representative day as a
centroid in the clustering process.
When this process is finished, i.e. the number of clusters, the number of samples in each
cluster, and the representative day of each centroid are known, the two-stage multi-objective
optimisation framework is evaluated with this clustering data as input. For instance, instead
of optimising for 8760 hours, this data clustering process allows optimising for eight days
(192 hours) and multiplying each day for the number of samples (n), in order to have an
approximation of the Pareto optimal solutions.
Then, a final stage is performed by optimising the annual operation of all non-dominated set
of solutions obtained from the two-stage optimisation with data clustering. This step allows us
A.2. Implementation 164

to improve the expected performance of the optimal designs achieved with the data clustering
process. Besides, by optimising its one-year hourly operation, it is possible to compare these
designs with the optimal designs resulted in the two-stage optimisation framework presented
in the main chapters of this thesis.
A.3 Results and discussion
In order to be able to have an accurate comparison in the application of data clustering in
the optimal design of sustainable power plants, the process was evaluated with different time
scales. Here, days, weeks and fortnights were considered and grouped as defined in equations
A.1 and A.2, with a proper definition of the summation process. By the silhouette analysis, it
was determined that eight days, four weeks, and three fortnights are an appropriated number of
clusters for each case.
Figure A.4 shows the three clustering process explained previously (8 hours, 4 weeks, and 3
fortnights) and the optimal designs achieved by the one-year annual optimisation. First, with a
continuous black line, the results of the two-stage optimisation considering one-year hourly op-
eration (8760 time-steps) are presented. This process required 42 hours to be computed. Then,
with different colours and lines, the figure illustrates the results of the two-stage optimisation
framework with data clustering. These processes are computed in 1 h, 3 h, and 4 h, respectively.
These results demonstrate that the use of data clustering considerably decreased the compu-
tational time. Nevertheless, despite that the optimal solutions are not the same, the diagram
A.3. Results and discussion 165
Figure A.4: Data clustering. Design optimisation results of a hybrid solar power plant with a
wind power station
shows that the three time scales considered in the data clustering process reach solutions that
are relatively close to the best approximation by considering one year in the operational opti-
misation stage. Consequently, these results highlight the potential of data clustering techniques
as an excellent tool to reduce the computational requirements to achieve comparable results
in the optimal design of dispatchable and affordable renewable power plants. In this context,
the use of a data clustering technique could give a first approximation for optimal designs of a
hybrid power plant with energy storage when the computational time could be a constraint.
