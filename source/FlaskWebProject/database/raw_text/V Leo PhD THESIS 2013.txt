Abstract 
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide, of which cardiomyopathies account for a proportion. One of the 
hallmarks of progressive heart disease is diminished energy metabolism 
associated with cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence directly 
implicates malfunctioning mitochondria and altered mitochondrial dynamics in 
the development of heart disease. Yet, little is known about mitochondrial 
remodelling changes that might contribute to the development of heart failure. 
A recently identified mouse mutant in the Dnm1l gene, Python, leads to 
the development of dilated cardiomyopathy at specific ages. The work reported 
herein focussed on understanding the mechanisms responsible for the 
development of cardiomyopathy in this model. Evidence was obtained of 
alteration in mitochondria, peroxisome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
morphology in various cell types. There was a suggestion of altered physical 
interaction between the mitochondria and the ER. Increased cytosolic calcium 
levels and reduced mitochondrial uptake of calcium were also observed in 
Python fibroblasts. Mitochondrial membranes were also depolarised. These 
changes resulted in reduced oxidative phosphorylation activity in the hearts of 
Python mice, which showed a progressive reduction with age. Ultimately a 
decrease in ATP levels occurred, which was unsustainable with normal heart 
function. DNM1L expression was found to increase with age in hearts of wild 
type mice, but not other tissues. This may be suggestive of an increase in the 
importance for the DNM1L protein in the ageing heart, though the exact 
reasons for this remain elusive. 
Fragmented mitochondria have been postulated to contribute to the 
development of Huntingtons disease. However, a reduction in fragmentation 
through introduction of the Python mutation did not alleviate the progressive 
development of symptoms in these animals. 
We hypothesize that the Python mutation impairs the ability of 
mitochondrial-ER tethering. Subsequent dysfunctional mitochondrial calcium 
uptake and altered mitochondrial membrane potential, leads to a progressive 
decline in oxidative phosphorylation activity and ATP production.

Chapter 1 : Introduction  
1.1 Mitochondrial Dynamics 
Mitochondria are found in most eukayotic cell types (Henze and Martin, 2003) 
and produce the majority of ATP within the cell. Aside from a source of energy 
production, mitochondria are also involved in other cellular processes such as 
apoptosis, autophagy, cell signalling and control of the cell cycle and growth. 
Compartments within the mitochondria include the outer mitochondrial 
membrane (OMM), intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane 
(IMM), cristae and matrix (Fig. 1.1). They also contain their own genome, with 
each mitochondrion containing multiple copies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is 
implicated in a number of diseases including neuropathies and cardiac 
dysfunction. Mitochondrial morphology differs between cell types, but a 
balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission is common to most cells 
containing mitochondria (Nunnari et al., 1997). Their dynamic nature is thought 
to be essential for function, and disease may be a consequence of alterations 
in their morphology.

following compartments: outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), 
intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), cristae and 
matrix.

1.1.1 The role of mitochondrial fusion and fission 
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, constantly undergoing fusion and fission 
in most cell types (Nunnari et al., 1997). This dynamic nature of mitochondria is 
thought to serve multiple purposes, though the exact role of fusion and fission 
remains unclear. Fusion is required for mitochondrial growth and fission for cell 
division (Hoffmann and Avers, 1973), but the latter also contributes to other 
processes such as removing damaged mitochondrial regions for subsequent 
degradation (De Meyer et al., 2010, Gomes et al., 2011, Westermann, 2010). 
A number of cellular functions have been associated with mitochondrial fission. 
Morphometric analysis of mitochondria during the cell cycle provides evidence 
that mitochondrial fission is required for the distribution of mitochondria into 
daughter cells (Taguchi et al., 2007). A reduction in fission was shown to 
decrease cell proliferation (Lee et al., 2007), as was a hyperfused state in 
vascular smooth muscle cells (Guo et al., 2007b, Zhang and Chan, 2007).  
Fusion may also help maintain mitochondrial function. Imaging studies 
of mutant fibroblasts in which fusion proteins had been knocked down revealed 
most cells contain dysfunctional mitochondria as indicated by a decrease in 
membrane potential within small regions of a single mitochondrial tubule (Chen 
et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2005, Olichon et al., 2003). It has since been 
postulated that fusion protects mitochondria by ensuring that membrane 
potential  critical to ion exchange across the mitochondrial membrane  is 
only ever transiently compromised. Fusion facilitates intermitochondrial 
cooperation, allowing the mitochondrial contents to mix, and thus, may rectify 
mitochondrial function (Nakada et al., 2001). 
Mitochondria contain their own genome of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), 
which encodes twelve out of the eighty subunits that make up the complexes 
of the electron transport chain (ETC) essential for mitochondrial function 
(Andersson and Kurland, 1999). It was through analysis of the deleterious 
effect of accumulating mtDNA mutations that the first evidence of a protective 
effect of mitochondrial fusion was observed (Guan et al., 1993, Hermann et al., 
1998, Jones and Fangman, 1992, Rapaport et al., 1998, Shepard and Yaffe, 
1999). Measuring enzyme activity across the ETC in human skin fibroblasts 
revealed that cells only contain defective mitochondria when more than 60% of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /5*
mtDNA is mutated, supporting the protective role for mitochondrial fusion 
(Miyabayashi et al., 1992). 
 Fragmented mitochondria have also been detected in cellular 
processes such as apoptosis (Martinou et al., 1999) and autophagy (Mouli et 
al., 2009), which will be explained in more detail below (Section 1.2). The 
mitochondria of senescing human umbilical vein endothelial cells have also 
been shown to display an elongated phenotype. It has been hypothesised that 
mitochondria in ageing cells conserve energy by reducing the dynamic 
processes of fusion and fission, yet maintain sufficient energy production for 
cell survival (Mai et al., 2010). 
1.1.2 Mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins 
The fusion and fission processes are controlled by different sets of proteins. 
Three large GTPases in the dynamin family are known to participate in 
mitochondrial fusion: mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) (Chen et al., 
2003, Rojo et al., 2002, Santel and Fuller, 2001) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) 
(Olichon et al., 2003).  Recently, mitochondrial elongation factor 1 (MIEF1) 
(also known as Mid51, (Palmer et al., 2011)) has also been shown to 
participate in the fusion process (Zhao et al., 2011). The GTPase dynamin-like 
protein 1 (DNM1L, previously called DRP1) mediates mitochondrial fission 
(Chen and Chan, 2005, Frank et al., 2001), with the assistance of the docking 
proteins, mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) (Chen and Chan, 2005) and 
mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) (Otera et al., 2010). The basic domain 
structures of fusion and fission proteins are shown in Figure 1.2. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 76*
Figure 1.2. Structures of the mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins. 
The protein structures are shown from the N-terminus (left) to the C-terminus. 
DNM1L (736 amino acids) is composed of a GTPase domain, a middle domain 
(M), a variable domain (VD) and a GTPase effector domain (GED). FIS1 (152 
amino acids), a non-dynamin protein, comprises an N-arm of six #-helices, 
where the first is required for oligomerisation and the other five make up two 
tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), thought to be essential for DNM1L recruitment. 
A transmembrane (TM) domain is also necessary for anchorage to the OMM. 
MFF (342 amino acids) is anchored to the OMM via its C-terminal TM domain, 
located downstream of a coiled coil domain. MFF also contains two N-terminus 
amino acid repeats (R1 and R2). MIEF1 (463 amino acids) contains an N-
terminus TM domain. MFN1 (741 amino acids) and MFN2 (757 amino acids) 
both contain a GTPase domain, heptad repeat 1 (HR1), two TM domains and 
heptad repeat 2 (HR2). OPA1 (997 amino acids) is made up of two TM 
domains, a GTPase domain, an M domain and a GED. Sizes indicated are of 
the human proteins. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 7/*
The mitofusin proteins MFN1 and MFN2 are members of the dynamin family, 
depicted in Figure 1.2. MFN1 and MFN2 are capable of forming homo- and 
heterotypic dimers (Koshiba et al., 2004, Rojo et al., 2002). The proteins are 
anchored in the OMM via the transmembrane (TM) domains, with the C-
terminus, containing the HR2 domain exposed to the cytosol (Koshiba et al., 
2004, Santel and Fuller, 2001). Interactions between the HR2 domains of 
mitofusins on adjacent mitochondria mediate mitochondrial docking (Fig. 1.3A). 
While the mitochondria are tethered, mitochondrial fusion of the inner 
membranes is then mediated by the dynamin-like protein OPA1, anchored to 
the cristae on the IMM via its TM domains. The exact mechanism by which 
OPA1 induces IMM fusion is unknown. It has been postulated that it may 
mediate tubulation of the IMM, forming protrusions and bringing into contact 
membranes of adjacent mitochondria (Olichon et al., 2003).  
A recent discovery suggests MIEF1 is also involved in fusion. Its 
overexpression in 293T cells resulted in hyperfused mitochondria, while its 
knockdown by RNAi leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. Interestingly MIEF1 
was found to be colocalised with DNM1L on the mitochondria (Zhao et al., 
2011). Paradoxically, MIEF1 is implicated in the recruitment of DNM1L to the 
OMM, independent of interactions with FIS1 or MFF. Yet it is apparent that 
MIEF1 decreases the GTP-binding capability of DNM1L, hence, decreases 
GTPase activity, rendering the fission protein inactive, thereby promoting 
fusion. Evidence also suggests that MIEF1 may directly facilitate the fusion 
process, bringing mitochondrial membranes into close apposition (Zhao et al., 
2011). The role of this protein was also confirmed in an independent study by 
Palmer et al (2011), by overexpression in HeLa cells. 
FIS1 is a small protein comprised of a TM domain, which allows 
anchorage to the OMM, and six #-helices located at the N-terminus 
(designated N-arm) (Fig.1.2) (Suzuki et al., 2003). The helices form an 
arrangement that bears some similarity to a tandem arrangement of 
tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), a structural motif known to be involved in 
protein-protein interactions (Blatch and Lassle, 1999). The docking protein, 
MFF, anchored to the OMM via its TM domain, assists the recruitment of

Figure 1.3. A schematic diagram illustrating the proteins involved in 
mitochondrial fusion and fission. (A) While DNM1L is maintained inactive 
through interactions with MIEF1, mitochondrial fusion begins with the homo- or 
heterodimerisation of the mitofusin proteins MFN1 and MFN2 joining the 
OMMs of two adjacent mitochondria via their HR2 domains. The IMMs then 
fuse with the help of OPA1. (B) In mitochondrial fission, DNM1L translocates to 
the OMM surface, where docking is mediated by interactions with FIS1 and 
MFF. The DNM1L oligomer rearranges, constricting the membranes, resulting 
in two separate mitochondria. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 78*
DNM1L to the OMM to facilitate the process of mitochondrial fission (Fig. 
1.3B). MFF directly interacts with DNM1L, independent of FIS1. Knockdown of 
MFF in CKO human colon tumour cells results in DNM1L remaining in the 
cytosol and unable to form higher order structures (Otera et al., 2010). 
The yeast homologue of DNM1L, Dnm1, utilizes two further docking 
proteins, for which there appear to be no mammalian homologues, 
mitochondrial division 1 (Mdv1p) and Caffeine-resistant 4 (Caf4p). These 
proteins mediate the interaction between Dnm1 and Fis1p (the yeast 
orthologue of FIS1). The docking proteins possess similar domain 
architectures with an NH2-terminal extension (NTE), which mediates 
oligomerisation and association with Fis1p, and a WD40 domain at the C-
terminus, which facilitates interactions with Dnm1 (Griffin et al., 2005, Tieu and 
Nunnari, 2000). Crystallographic analysis of complexes containing Fis1p reveal 
the two adapter proteins bind to Fis1p via the TPR domains (Zhang and Chan, 
2007). 
1.1.3 DNM1L structure 
DNM1L is a member of the dynamin family of proteins. Much of what has been 
intimated about the structure of DNM1L comes from analysis of other members 
of the dynamin family. Dynamins are involved in a variety of cellular processes 
such as vesicle budding (Henley et al., 1998, Gold et al., 1999), organelle 
fission (Fukushima et al., 2001, Labrousse et al., 1999, Pitts et al., 1999, 
Smirnova et al., 1998), cytokinesis (Feng et al., 2002, Thompson et al., 2002, 
Lukowitz et al., 1996) and pathogen resistance (Kochs and Haller, 1999a, 
Kochs and Haller, 1999b). The main members of the classical dynamin family 
(dynamin 1, dynamin 2 and dynamin 3) contain GTPase, middle (M), pleckstrin 
homology (PHD), GTPase effector (GED) and proline-rich (PRD) domains (Fig. 
1.4A).  The PRD enables the dynamins to interact with proteins that contain a 
SRC homology domain 3 (SH3) in order to perform vesicle scission functions, 
including clathrin coated vesicle (CCV) scission, caveolae budding and 
phagocytosis (Gold et al., 1999, Henley et al., 1998, Oh et al., 1998). DNM1L 
was first identified as a homologue of the yeast golgi dynamin-like protein, 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 70*
Vps1p (Imoto et al., 1998). DNM1L was soon after shown to associate with 
mitochondria and to be involved in mitochondrial fission (Otsuga et al., 1998, 
Smirnova et al., 1998).  
A defining feature of dynamins is their ability to constrict membranes 
(Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998). By way of oligomerisation, dynamins are able 
to form a helical polymer, made of many dynamin assembly units, around a 
lipid bilayer, which is essential to induce membrane destabilisation (Praefcke 
and McMahon, 2004). Due to regions of high flexibility and the tendency to self 
assemble, the dynamin proteins have proven difficult to crystallise (Low et al., 
2009) and, therefore, there is a relative paucity of structural detail available. 
Most information has come from using electron cryomicroscopy 
reconstructions. A three-dimensional map of a mutant dynamin missing the 
PRD ("PRD) was obtained using electron cryomicroscopy and revealed a T-
shaped sub-unit consisting of three distinct regions designated the leg, stalk 
and head (Fig. 1.4B), with heads being shared by neighbouring dimers. It is 
evident that interactions also exist within each monomeric subunit; the GED 
domain folds back to interact with the M domain, which within the dimer, 
together comprise the stalk region.  The strongest interactions between repeat 
units lie within this stalk region on which oligomerisation is dependent upon 
(Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001).

Upon GTP hydrolysis, the dynamin ("PRD) polymer exerts a force, leading to 
lipid rearrangement and membrane constriction, in which the diameter of the 
spiral polymer narrows from 50nm to 40nm and the distance between 
assembly units also shortens from 132 amino acids to 94 amino acids (Fig. 
1.5) (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001).  
Figure 1.5. Membrane curvature induced by dynamin structural 
rearrangements. (A) Oligomerisation of the dynamin subunits at the lipid 
membrane surface induces membrane constriction. The high curvature of the 
membrane results in fission to regain membrane stability. (B) A possible 
mechanism by which the dynamin oligomer induces membrane constriction. A 
twisting motion of each subunit allows tighter packing of the molecules inflicting 
stress upon the membrane and subsequent curvature.

Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) of bacterial dynamin-like 
protein (BDLP) provided further structural data, proposing that the dimer is 
folded and compact until GTP-binding and lipid association triggers the 
conformational change to the extended T-shaped repeat (Fig. 1.6A) (Low and 
Lowe, 2006, Low et al., 2009). It is unclear whether BDLP participates in 
membrane fission, fusion or both. It has been hypothesised that GTPase 
activity depolymerises the spiral, leaving the lipid membrane in an 
energetically unfavourable state, which may result in the formation of two 
separate membranes or if two separate membranes in such state are within 
close proximity, may lead to their fusion (Fig. 1.6B). Either situation may also 
result in the membrane returning to its original state (Low and Lowe, 2006, 
Low et al., 2009).

dimer undergoes a conformational change upon GTP-binding and lipid 
association into the extended form required for oligomerisation. Different 
colours have been used to show individual monomers of the dimer. (B) 
Polymerisation of the BDLP units creates a coat around the lipid bilayer. 
GTPase activity leads to membrane rearrangement and depolymerisation of 
BDLP, resulting in an energetically unfavourable state. This state can cause a 
single membrane to divide into two or two membranes in close proximity to 
fuse into one. Modified from Low et al (2009).

The mechanism of BDLP polymerisation is likely to be conserved throughout 
the dynamin family. In agreement with this, the yeast homologue of DNM1L, 
Dnm1 was also shown to form a filament around the membrane and a change 
in conformation that accompanies GTP hydrolysis leads to membrane 
constriction and separation of mitochondria (Ingerman et al., 2005).  A 
structural model of mouse DNM1L has also been generated by comparative 
sequence homology to BDLP, showing similarities in structure to that of the 
Dynamin ("PRD) dimer and the BDLP dimer (Fig. 1.7) (Ashrafian et al., 2010).

BDLP dimer (Low et al., 2009) displaying the conserved GTPase domain and

Dnm1l shown in the homology model by (Ashrafian et al., 2010). The paddle 
domain of BDLP is thought to mediate lipid binding, as is the VD or PHD in 
eukaryotes. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 75*
In contrast to reports that suggest the DNM1L basic unit in vivo is a dimer, 
other evidence suggests that a tetramer DNM1L unit exists. Cross-linking 
analysis revealed a molecular mass of  ~320KDa for the eluted protein; equal 
to four DNM1L monomers of ~80KDa (Shin et al., 1999). The same method of 
analysis with dynamin also showed its existence as a tetramer, displaying a 
molecular mass of ~400KDa (four times the ~100KDa dynamin monomer) 
(Muhlberg et al., 1997). Following size exclusion chromatography, eluted 
protein from the mouse DNM1L pool was shown to consist of three different 
molecular masses: ~180KDa, representing the dimer; ~360KDa, indicative of 
the tetramer; and a mass of over 16MDa, which is likely to represent the higher 
order structure (Chang et al., 2010). Therefore it is likely that DNM1L exists as 
both dimers and tetramers before forming higher order structures.  
1.1.4 Regulation of DNM1L activity 
DNM1L exists largely as a cytoplasmic protein, with only 3% bound to the 
mitochondrial membrane at any one time (Smirnova et al., 1998). DNM1L 
activity is known to be regulated, at least in part, by a number of post-
translational modifications. Ubiquitination involved in processes such as 
protein degradation, DNA repair (Nakamura et al., 2006) and membrane 
protein trafficking (Staub and Rotin, 2006) is one such example. The 
mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, MARCHV, was co-immunoprecipitated with 
the ubiquitinated form of DNM1L (Nakamura et al., 2006), suggesting a 
physical interaction between the proteins. Expressing mutant MARCHV in 
HeLa cells led to mitochondrial elongation and perinuclear localisation of 
DNM1L, implying MARCHV may facilitate the translocation of DNM1L to the 
mitochondria, possibly by mediating self-assembly at sites of mitochondrial 
fission (Karbowski et al., 2007). Through a yeast-two-hybrid screen, SUMO-1 
and the sumo-conjugating enzyme (UBC9) were revealed as strong interacting 
partners of DNM1L, which was also confirmed by pull-down experiments in 
mammalian cell lines co-expressing both proteins (Harder et al., 2004). 
Fluorescence microscopy also revealed co-localisation of SUMO-1 with 
DNM1L at sites of fission in many mitochondria indicating DNM1L activity may 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 86*
also be regulated by sumoylation. In support of this, overexpression of SUMO-
1 in Cos7 cells increases mitochondrial fission. It has been postulated that 
sumoylation may protect against degradation by inhibiting ubiquitin-like 
proteases (ULPs) (Harder et al., 2004). Excess nitric oxide (NO) was reported 
to induce dimerisation and increase GTPase activity of DNM1L through S-
nitrosylation of a cysteine residue at position 644 (Cys644) in the GED (Cho et 
al., 2009). This report is, however, directly contradicted by subsequent work by 
another research group (Bossy et al., 2010) and so its significance remains 
unknown. Three serine residues within the GED have been identified as 
regulation sites by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser616 in human 
DNM1L cells by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 bound to cyclinB induces 
mitochondrial fission during mitosis (Taguchi et al., 2007). Ser637 is a target for 
a number of regulatory proteins. Phosphorylation of this residue by protein 
kinase A inhibits fission (Chang and Blackstone, 2007), while phosphorylation 
by calmodulin dependent kinase 1a or dephosphorylation by calcineurin induce 
mitochondrial fission (Cereghetti et al., 2008, Han et al., 2008). Similarly, Ser656 
dephosphorylation by calcineurin results in fission (Cereghetti et al., 2008), as 
does phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Cribbs and 
Strack, 2007). The effect of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation therefore 
appear to have contradicting effects on the activity of DNM1L, depending on 
the residue modified and the protein, which brings about the modification. It 
may be that post-translational modifications influence the different steps in the 
fission process, from DNM1L translocation to the mitochondria, assembly of 
DNM1L into higher-order structures, GTP hydrolysis, membrane disruption, 
and finally resulting in the detachment and separation of the DNM1L molecules 
(Chang and Blackstone, 2010).

1.2 The role of mitochondria in physiological processes 
Mitochondria are key organelles, playing a part in a number of cellular 
processes. The maintenance of mitochondrial morphology through the action 
of fusion and fission proteins has been shown to be crucial for some 
processes. The roles of fusion/fission proteins in the impact of mitochondrial 
biology and physiology are described below.  
1.2.1 Cell metabolism 
A major role of mitochondria is ATP production, achieved through oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which takes place in the IMM. The process of 
OXPHOS can be initiated by glucose, which upon glycolysis, produces 
pyruvate and subsequently acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl coA) via pyruvate 
dehydrogenase (PDH). Alternatively fatty acids are also used as substrate to 
produce acetyl coA. Acetyl coA is transported into the mitochondrial matrix 
where it provides the carbon atoms necessary for a series of oxidation 
reactions in the citric acid cycle (CAC). The transfer of electrons from 
nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and succinate, produced in the 
CAC, are used by the enzymes of the respiratory chain to pump protons into 
the intermembrane space creating a proton gradient, also known as the 
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These protons then re-enter the 
matrix via ATP synthase with the resulting energy being used to drive ATP 
synthesis (Fig. 1.8). Enzymes involved in the CAC (pyruvate dehydrogenase, 
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) and the 
F0F1 ATP synthase are regulated by the mitochondrial uptake of calcium ions 
) (Balaban, 2009, McCormack and Denton, 1980). 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 87*
Figure 1.8. ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. Glucose or fatty 
acids are used to provide acetyl coA to the CAC in the  mitochondrial matrix. 
NADH and succinate are 2 key substrates produced in the CAC. Complex I 
(NADH dehydrogenase) removes electrons from the NADH molecules passed 
from the CAC. These electrons are transferred to a lipid soluble carrier, 
ubiquinone (Q) while protons translocate across the membrane into the 
intermembrane space, producing a proton gradient. Complex II (succinate 
dehydrogenase) delivers more electrons into the quinone pool from succinate. 
These electrons are important to reduce cytochrome C molecules by complex 
III (cytochrome BC1 complex). Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) then 
oxidizes Cytochrome C, pumping more protons across the membrane. This 
proton gradient proves to be very important in ATP synthesis, as it is required 
for the F0F1 ATP synthase complex to produce ATP. The F0 component of ATP 
synthase acts as an ion channel that provides a proton flux back into the 
mitochondrial matrix, which releases free energy produced during the 
generation of oxidized forms of electron carriers NAD
 and Q. The free energy 
from this proton flux is used to drive ATP synthesis, catalysed by the F1 
component. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 88*
1.2.2 Mitochondria-ER cooperation 
A proportion of mitochondrial membrane is directly tethered to the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER). This is believed to be of central importance as it allows for very 
rapid uptake of Ca
 released from the ER at these sites into mitochondria 
(Rizzuto et al., 2004). MFN2 has been shown to be important in this tethering 
process (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008). The presence of MFN2 on the ER 
surface forms homo- or heterotypic complexes with MFN1 or MFN2 present on 
the mitochondria, tethering the two organelles. This close positioning between 
the organelles facilitates efficient mitochondrial Ca
 uptake required for the 
subsequent activation of key enzymes of the CAC in order to supply succinate 
and NADH to the respiratory complexes (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008).  
 Aside from this important role in mitochondrial Ca
 uptake, ER-
mitochondrial tethering may be important in mitochondrial fission. 
Independently of DNM1L and MFF, the ER is able to interact with 
mitochondria. These sites later become occupied by DNM1L, and hence, 
become sites of fission. It has since been postulated that the ER interacts with 
the mitochondria in order to initiate the constriction of the OMM, allowing the 
DNM1L oligomer to spiral around and further constrict the mitochondria until 
fully divided (Friedman et al., 2011). Defective ER morphology has also been 
reported in association with DNM1L mutants, demonstrating up to an 80% 
decrease in total ER volume (Pitts et al., 1999).  
1.2.3 Maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential 
Maintenance of the MMP is essential for ATP production via OXPHOS. MMP 
not only drives ATP synthesis, but also stimulates mitochondrial Ca
 uptake 
via the mitochondrial Ca
 uniporter (MCU) (Hansford and Zorov, 1998). This is 
achieved through an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial 
membrane, provided by the MMP. Evidence has shown that a reduction in 
MMP significantly reduces mitochondrial Ca
 uptake (Szanda et al., 2010). 
Therefore MMP maintenance is fundamental for survival of cells.  
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 80*
          The fusion factors MFN1 and MFN2 have been shown to be important in 
the maintenance of MMP. Disruption of mitochondrial morphology by 
knockdown of MFN1 or MFN2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts was shown to 
result in the complete dissipation of membrane potential, increased mtDNA 
instability and decreased ATP production (Chen et al., 2010). This might be a 
direct result of a reduction in fusion, for example, the lack of a repair 
mechanism for mitochondria, in which fusion facilitates mitochondrial content 
sharing (Nakada et al., 2001). Alternatively, it might be a related function of 
MFN1 or MFN2, for example, given MFN2s involvement in ER-mitochondrial 
tethering, knockdown of MFN2 will reduce the efficiency of ER-mitochondrial 
contact, leading to defective uptake of Ca
 into the mitochondria, and 
associated decrease in the number of protons pumped across the inner 
membrane, thereby significantly reducing the MMP. It has been postulated that 
fission might also be important for maintaining the MMP, for instance, fission 
can segregate depolarized mitochondria, allowing them to be removed by 
autophagy (Mouli et al., 2009, Twig et al., 2008). 
1.2.4 Autophagy and Mitophagy 
Autophagy is the process by which damaged or excess organelles are 
removed by lysosomal degradation. This occurs under normal conditions to 
maintain cell function, and may be upregulated as a result of nutrient 
deprivation. During the process of autophagy, mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) activity is often suppressed. The process is then initiated by 
autophagy-related proteins, which mediate the formation of a double-
membrane (also known as an isolation membrane) that surrounds the 
organelle to be degraded forming the so-called autophagosome. The 
autophagosome marker MAP1 light chain 3 isoform I (LC3-I) is localised to the 
cytosol. Upon C-terminal cleavage and lipidation LC3-I is converted into the 
LC3-II isoform. LC3-II becomes localised to the autophagosome membrane to 
complete the formation of the lipid bilayer of the isolation membrane (Xie and 
Klionsky, 2007) It is unknown whether the modification of LC3-I occurs before 
translocation to the autophagic membrane or after (Kabeya et al., 2000). 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 81*
Fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes allows degradation of the 
components engulfed by the autophagosome (Nakatogawa et al., 2009, Yang 
and Klionsky, 2010). 
Cardenas et al (2010) report that autophagy can be a cellular response 
to defective inositol-1,2,4-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca
 release from the 
ER and subsequent signalling between the ER and mitochondria. When IP3 
binds to the IP3R on the ER, Ca
 is released from the ER allowing uptake by 
mitochondria. As stated previously (Section 1.2.1), Ca
 is required for the 
activity of specific enzymes involved in ATP production. ATP maintains the 
inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of energy 
insufficiency (Hardie, 2007). Reduced mitochondrial Ca
 uptake leads to a 
reduction in ATP production via OXPHOS. Upon ATP depletion, AMPK is 
activated through phosphorylation (P-AMPK). This response to a reduction in 
ATP enables the cell to recycle metabolites by the synthesis of new raw 
materials for the production of acetyl coA, which kick-starts the CAC, and so 
increasing the production of ATP. Autophagy in the case of defective IP3R Ca
release from the ER was, however, shown to occur via a pathway independent 
of mTOR, as nutrition within cells was still sufficient (Fig. 1.9) (Cardenas et al., 
2010). It has also been proposed that this IP3R-mediated autophagic response 
is targeted specifically for defective ER removal (Green and Wang, 2010).  
Mitophagy is the term given to the removal of mitochondria by 
autophagy. This is a cellular maintenance mechanism in which damaged 
mitochondria are removed (Mouli et al., 2009). The inability to remove 
damaged organelles such as mitochondria may result in the accumulation of 
non-functional organelles, eventually leading to oxidative stress and decreased 
ATP production (De Meyer et al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that 
dissipation of the inner membrane potential prevents mitochondrial fusion 
(Twig et al., 2008, Legros et al., 2002) and mitochondria exhibiting this defect 
are targeted by autophagosomes for digestion and elimination (Elmore et al., 
2001). The mechanism by which membrane potential facilitates fusion is 
thought to involve the proteolytic cleavage of OPA1. During fusion, OPA1 
exists in the large (L)-isoform. It has been postulated that membrane potential 
is required to maintain the mechanical coupling of the fusion machinery on the 
outer and inner membranes. Upon dissipation of the membrane potential, 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 82*
fusion is inhibited due to the translocation of the OPA1 L-isoform across the 
IMM into the matrix, where it is processed to produce the short (S)-isoform, 
observed in fragmented mitochondria (Ishihara et al., 2006). Depolarised 
membranes have also been shown to cause mitophagy through the 
recruitment of PARKIN (Yang et al., 2006, Park et al., 2006, Greene et al., 
2003). When PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is imported into mitochondria, 
the protein is usually cleaved by voltage-sensitive proteolysis. When the 
membrane potential dissipates, PINK1 cleavage is inhibited, leading to the 
recruitment of PARKIN. Increasing the expression of PARKIN leads to 
ubiquitination of proteins on the OMM and thought to initiate mitohphagy 
through the recruitment of factors that activate autophagy such as LC3 and 
cortactin (Narenda et al,, 2010, Jin & Youle, 2012). 
It has been postulated that mitochondrial fission precedes mitophagy in 
order to create smaller fragments to enable engulfment and selective removal 
by the autophagosome (Westermann, 2010). In support of this, it has been 
observed that during starvation, elongated mitochondria are spared from 
mitophagy (Gomes et al., 2011). It is hypothesized the combination between 
fusion and fission segregates dysfunctional mitochondria and identifies them 
for removal by autophagy (Twig et al., 2008, Mouli et al., 2009).

Figure 1.9. Pathway of Autophagy regulation by Ca
 transfer. Upon 
binding of IP3 to the IP3R, Ca
 is released from the ER, which then enters the 
mitochondria, activating PDH and dehydrogenases of the CAC. The production 
of ATP via the ETC blocks the phosphorylation of AMPK. When 
phosphorylated, in the absence of ATP, it is able to stimulate autophagosomal 
growth, leading to autophagy (Green and Wang, 2010).

1.2.5 Apoptosis 
Apoptosis is the term given to programmed cell death, a critical function in the 
development and maintenance of tissues and organs (Meier et al., 2000). 
Apoptosis also ensures the accurate elimination of damaged and potentially 
harmful cells. The process can be induced by various stimuli that all converge 
to induce activation of the caspase complex and subsequent cell death (Kerr et 
al., 1972). The BCL-2 protein family mediates the regulation of apoptosis. 
Some members, known as anti-apoptotic proteins e.g. BCL-2 and BCL-X, 
inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX 
and BAK. (Yang et al., 1997, Rosse et al., 1998, Kluck et al., 1997, Eskes et 
al., 1998). The family known as BH3-only proteins also contributes to the 
pathway by blocking the activity of the anti-apoptotic proteins, allowing the 
activation of BAX and BAK (Shimizu and Tsujimoto, 2000). In response to 
apoptotic stimuli, BAX translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria, while 
BAK is already present at the mitochondrial membrane. Oligomerisation of 
these proteins contributes to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability 
(MOMP). This mitochondrial destruction leading to leakage of toxic 
components (primarily cytochrome c) from the OMM is a crucial aspect of the 
process. 
In addition to its role in fission, DNM1L is required for apoptosis, 
mediating mitochondrial cristae remodelling and cytochrome c release leading 
to cell death. It has been postulated that DNM1L associates with the fusion 
protein MFN2, initiates tethering of the OMM and promotes oligomerisation of 
the pro-apoptotic factor BAX (Karbowski et al., 2002, Montessuit et al., 2010). 
Inhibition of DNM1L GTPase activity (by expression of a dominant negative 
mutant) impairs both fission and apoptosis (Frank et al., 2001) supporting a 
role for DNM1L in both processes.  
The translocation of BAX to the mitochondria in response to apoptotic 
stimuli also mediates an increase in DNM1L translocation to the mitochondria 
(Frank et al., 2001). However the precise role of DNM1L and mitochondrial 
fission in apoptosis remains elusive. It has been postulated that DNM1L and 
MFN2 colocalise with BAX at scission foci, inducing MOMP (Karbowski et al., 
2002). In a recent report, DNM1L was shown to be capable of stimulating BAX 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /0*
oligomerisation by promoting membrane remodelling. In response to apoptotic 
stimuli, BAX undergoes a conformational change and translocates to the 
OMM, recruited by tBID, a receptor protein for BAX to integrate into the OMM. 
At the same site, membrane remodelling, facilitated by DNM1L, induces BAX 
oligomerisation, causing MOMP and subsequent apoptosis. Remodelling may 
provide the appropriate membrane curvature and lipid composition, explaining 
the preference of BAX localisation to the mitochondrial fission sites in apoptotic 
cells (Fig. 1.10) (Montessuit et al., 2010). 
In marked contrast, DNM1L-mediated mitochondrial fission has also 
been reported to have a protective role against apoptosis by protecting 
mitochondria from elevated Ca
 uptake (Ong et al., 2010, Szabadkai et al., 
2004). During the process of OXPHOS, electrons passed through the ETC can 
leak out and react with molecular oxygen, which triggers a sequence of 
reduction reactions eventually leading to the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) (Brookes et al., 2004, Takimoto and Kass, 2007). Normally, 
ROS are chemically reduced, however at elevated levels they can become 
detrimental to the cell. While mitochondrial Ca
 uptake is a crucial element in 
ATP production, an overload of mitochondrial Ca
 increases respiratory 
output, therefore increasing ROS generation. The switch of Ca
 from being a 
physiological stimulus to a pathological stimulus is known as the two-hit 
hypothesis (Brookes et al., 2004). Increased leakage of mitochondrial contents 
including ROS and cytochrome c have been reported in association with 
mitochondrial Ca
 overload, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (Szalai et al., 
1999). This is also supported by the formation of the mitochondrial permeability 
transition pore (mPTP), which opens in response to a high mitochondrial Ca
concentration. The mPTP permeabilises the inner membrane usually leading 
to mitochondrial swelling and subsequent necrosis (Choi et al., 1999). 
However it has also been shown that the resulting dissipation of the membrane 
potential activates Calpain, a protein that cleaves BID into its truncated form, 
tBID, enabling the recruitment and oligomerisation of BAX, leading to MOMP 
formation and apoptosis (Chen et al., 2002). 
Over expression of DNM1L in HeLa cells leads a highly fragmented 
mitochondrial network as a result of increased fission. It is thought that a 
greater degree of fragmentation will result in a greater distance between 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 06*
mitochondria and sites of ER Ca
 release, reducing the efficiency of 
mitochondrial Ca
 uptake. Therefore DNM1L-mediated fission protects against 
mitochondrial Ca
 overload during apoptosis, while ensuring sufficient Ca
present in mitochondria to perform physiological functions (Szabadkai et al., 
2004). Overexpression of the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 initiates 
apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells independently of its ability to 
mediate fusion (Guo et al., 2007a, Suen et al., 2008), which may indicate 
alternative roles for the fusion protein. The roles of mitochondrial fusion and 
fission proteins in apoptosis thus appear to be dissociable, at least in some 
contexts. 
Figure 1.10. DNM1L-induced membrane remodelling in apoptosis. 
Apoptotic stimuli cause a conformational change in BAX, resulting in the 
translocation from the cytoplasm to the OMM with the help of tBID. DNM1l-
induced membrane remodelling is required for BAX oligomerisation. This is, in

1.3 Association of altered mitochondrial morphology with 
disease processes 
Alterations in mitochondrial morphology have been associated with a number 
of neurodegenerative diseases. The fusion/fission balance has proven very 
important in all cell types, however alterations in morphology in highly 
polarised cells such as neurons can result in restricted mitochondrial motility 
within the cell. Defective fission, resulting in larger mitochondrial networks 
prevents their translocation into small structures such as axons of neurons 
(Chen and Chan, 2009). How reduced fusion reduces mitochondrial motility is 
less clear, but may be due to increased swelling and aggregation (Chen et al., 
2003). A gradual neurodegeneration may be a consequence of mitochondrial 
dysfunction. 
1.3.1 Parkinsons disease  
Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of 
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Symptoms include a resting 
tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and an unsteady gait. Two proteins have been 
identified as key players in the development of PD: PINK1 and PARKIN. 
PINK1 is a serine/threonine kinase containing an N-terminal mitochondrial 
targeting sequence localised to cytosolic mitochondria. PINK1 interacts with 
PARKIN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets specific proteins for degradation 
by ubiquitination. Loss of PARKIN can lead to the accumulation of a number of 
targeted proteins such as the far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein 1 
(FBP1) and p38, as found in the brain of Park2-knockout mice (Ko et al., 2006, 
Ko et al., 2005). In knockout mouse models of Park2 (Palacino et al., 2004) 
and Pink1 (Gispert et al., 2009), the mitochondria were shown to exhibit 
defective respiration, oxidative stress and hyperfragmentation. PARKIN has 
been shown to interact with and regulate DNM1L turnover (Wang et al., 2011). 
Failure of this function will lead to increased DNM1L activity and excessive 
mitochondrial fragmentation. Similarly, stable knockdown of PINK in SH-SY5 
cells also resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation. This is however in contrast 
to the Drosophila Park knockout model (Wang et al., 2011), and the loss-of-
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 07*
function Pink1 model (Poole et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2008), which claim 
mitochondrial elongation is increased. This variance may be in part due to the 
difference in system used for the experiments.   
 PARKIN has also been shown to mediate mitophagy, which requires 
mitochondrial fission (Dagda et al., 2009). PARKIN may function to keep 
DNM1L levels under control, but if recruited to depolarised mitochondria, may 
help to remove the damaged mitochondria. A mutated PARKIN protein might 
lead to dysregulated DNM1L maintenance and mitophagy. The resulting 
phenotype is that of mitochondrial fragmentation and accumulation of 
damaged mitochondria, a possible cause for neuronal cell death and 
progression of neurodegenerative disease. 
1.3.2 Alzheimers disease  
The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimers disease (AD), is 
the result of the loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex causing cognitive 
dysfunction and memory loss. It is thought the accumulation of -amyloid 
plaques (A) leads to cell death (Dodart and May, 2005). Alterations in 
mitochondrial morphology have been identified in the brains of AD patients 
(Baloyannis, 2006). The ability of As to localise to mitochondria may play a 
part in cellular toxicity (Manczak et al., 2006, Lustbader et al., 2004). It has 
been hypothesised that generation of NO from the excessive As increases 
the activity of DNM1L via S-nitrosylation, leading to increased mitochondrial 
fission. This is supported by the increased levels of SNO-DNM1L found in the 
brains of AD patients (Cho et al., 2009) though the data are not entirely 
consistent as AD patient fibroblasts express decreased DNM1L levels and 
mitochondria exhibit the formation of a perinuclear network (Wang et al., 2008, 
Wang et al., 2009). However, this could be explained by differences between 
DNM1L functions in specific cell types.

1.3.3 Huntingtons disease  
Huntingtons disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in exon 1 
of the huntingtin protein (HTT). The polyglutamine length determines severity 
and age of onset, with longer repeats causing increased severity. The resulting 
striatal neuron degeneration causes symptoms such as cognitive decline and 
uncontrolled movement that progressively worsen with age (Perry et al., 1973). 
Mitochondria have long been regarded as central to the pathogenicity of HD, 
based on observations of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in 
cells from HD patients. The striatum, in particular, is sensitive to alterations in 
energy metabolism, often resulting in degeneration (Beal, 1992). OXPHOS 
activity has been reported to be severely impaired in the striatum of HD 
patients, with reduced activity of complexes II, III and IV of the ETC (Brennan 
et al., 1985, Browne et al., 1997, Tabrizi et al., 1999). MMP (Sawa et al., 1999) 
and increased cytosolic Ca
 due to defective signalling between the 
mitochondria and ER (Bezprozvanny and Hayden, 2004) also display 
alterations in the striata of HD patients. However, the underlying mechanisms 
in which mutant HTT triggers these pathological responses leading to striatal 
degeneration remains elusive (Damiano et al., 2010).  
 The mitochondrial fission protein, DNM1L, has been implicated by 
findings of increased translocation to the mitochondrial membrane and 
GTPase activity in neurons of HD patients (Song et al., 2011), which could 
potentially result in increased mitochondrial fission and subsequent leakage of 
apoptotic-inducing factors. An increase in the direct interaction between mutant 
HTT and DNM1L, which appears to increase GTPase activity of DNM1L, has 
been observed (Song et al., 2011, Giacomello et al., 2011). Mutant HTT also 
enhances mitochondrial fission through its stimulation of Ca
 release from the 
ER by binding to the IP3R. The increased Ca
 release activates calcineurin, 
which in turn dephosphorylates DNM1L, stimulating its translocation to the 
mitochondrial membrane where it can effect fission (Costa et al., 2010, 
Giacomello et al., 2011). The fragmented mitochondrial network reduces the 
motility of mitochondria to the axons in neurons (Shirendeb et al., 2012). As a 
result of these findings it has been postulated that correcting mitochondrial 
morphological abnormalities in striatal neurons may ameliorate the symptoms 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 00*
of HD (Shirendeb et al., 2012). The increased levels of mitochondrial 
fragmentation and neuronal apoptosis along with reduced mitochondrial 
motility and velocity displayed in cells from HD patients have all been reversed 
in cell lines by expression of a dominant-negative form of DNM1L (Costa et al., 
2010, Song et al., 2011), though this has not yet been translated in vivo in 
animal models of HD. 
1.4 Alterations in expression of fusion / fission factors 
lead to disease 
Mutations in fusion/fission proteins have been shown to result in a number of 
severe disorders. Alterations in mitochondrial morphology also accompany 
such phenotypes; however, it is unknown whether disease is a result of altered 
morphology or is due to pleiotropic roles, and the resultant fusion/fission 
balance is therefore a secondary effect. 
1.4.1 Charcott-Marie-Tooth Type 2A  
Charcott-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A) is a neurodegenerative autosomal 
dominant disorder, characterised by the loss of sensation, predominantly in the 
lower limbs, although hands and arms eventually become affected as the 
disease progresses. Missense mutations have been identified in MFN2, an 
OMM fusion protein, responsible for the disease in the affected members of a 
single family (Zuchner et al., 2004). Immunofluorescence studies using 
cultured CMT2A motor neuron cells reveal the presence of mitochondrial 
clusters that are unable to translocate down the axon towards the synapses, 
preventing the synaptic function that is critical for nervous system 
communication (Detmer et al., 2008). Mouse knockout models of Mfn1 or Mfn2 
result in embryonic lethality and mitochondrial dysfunction (Chen et al., 2003), 
implying an essential role in embryonic development. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 01*
1.4.2 Optic Atrophy 
Mutations in OPA1, the inner membrane fusion protein, results in the 
neuropathy, dominant optic atrophy (DOA), characterised by the progressive 
loss of vision, with many cases leading to complete blindness due to damage 
to the optic nerve. As in CMT2A, mitochondria become highly fragmented as a 
result of decreased fusion along with abnormal mitochondrial distribution in 
cells harbouring putative Opa1 gene mutations, clumping in discrete areas of 
the cytoplasm. It has been postulated that the mitochondrial defect is followed 
by decreased respiration and a loss of retinal ganglian cells (RGCs) (Delettre 
et al., 2000). The difference in tissues affected by MFN2 and OPA1 mutations 
regardless of the similar mitochondrial phenotypes, may be due to inner versus 
outer membrane fusion defects or due to unknown pleiotropic roles for each 
protein. The specificity of OPA1 defects in RGCs may be explained by its 
predominant expression in the high-energy demanding retina (Pesch et al., 
2004) 
Lack of OPA1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality (Alavi et al., 2009, 
Davies et al., 2007). Heterozygotes for the null mutation (Opa1
) live normal 
lives up until the onset of optic atrophy (Alavi et al., 2009). Studies in the 
 mice have revealed that the effects spread further than the optic nerve; 
abnormal clutching of the hind limbs suggests defects in the brain, spinal cord 
and dorsal root ganglia. A third of mice also had a resting tremor of the upper 
limbs suggesting defects in the brain stem or cerebellum and performed worse 
in a Roterod test for motor skills suggesting neuromuscular coordination 
difficulties (Alavi et al., 2009). Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, 
an Opa1
Q825STOP
 exon 8 mutation was identified. The mutation truncates the 
protein immediately prior to the GTPase domain. These mice show reduced 
visual activity and muscle power and disrupted mitochondrial fusion upon 
onset of DOA symptoms, reminiscent of the Opa1
 null mutant mouse (Davies 
et al., 2007). Dendritic pruning in RGCs from heterozygous animals is evident 
from ten months, preceding the onset of the optic atrophy symptoms (White et 
al., 2009). OPA1 may therefore be critical for communication between 
neurons. Given that mitochondrial fusion is impaired, mitochondrial 
morphology may also be a requirement for neuronal communication. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 02*
Over seventy mutations (missense, nonsense, insertions and deletions) have 
been reported in the OPA1 gene in patients with a predisposition to DOA (Alavi 
et al., 2007, Baris et al., 2003, Delettre et al., 2000, Pesch et al., 2001, 
Thiselton et al., 2001, Thiselton et al., 2002). Two thirds of these mutations 
occur in the GTPase domain, which is highly conserved across species and 
orthologues, and this might reflect a crucial role for this particular domain in the 
function of OPA1.  
1.4.3 The DNM1L
A401D
 mutation 
An infant that died 37 days after birth exhibited severe neurological and 
metabolic abnormalities including microcephaly, optic atrophy, abnormal brain 
development, hyperplasia and elevated lactic acid concentrations in the blood 
and cerebral spinal fluid (Waterham et al., 2007). The metabolic features were 
suggestive of a defect in energetics and, thus, mitochondria were examined in 
cell lines from the patient. Both mitochondria and peroxisomes exhibited 
abnormal morphology and sequencing of DNM1L in this patient identified a 
single nucleotide substitution resulting in an alanine-aspartate substitution in 
domain M. The infant was heterozygous for the mutation and it was not carried 
by either parent (Waterham et al., 2007). The mutation results in defective 
DNM1L that shows a lower GTPase activity and an inability to form higher 
order oligomers (Chang et al., 2010). 
1.4.4 The Dnm1l Python mutation 
Large scale ENU mutagenesis in mice is a forward genetics approach to 
identify mutations that contribute to disease phenotypes (Cordes, 2005). In a 
dysmorphology screen at MRC Harwell for mutations with dominant effects, a 
male offspring from an ENU-mutagenised BALB/cCrlAnN male x C3H/HeH 
female exhibited rapid weight gain over several days (Fig. 1.11A), piloerection 
and shallow, rapid breathing. It became clear the underlying cause of these 
symptoms was cardiovascular in nature as the heart was grossly dilated (Fig. 
1.11B). The heart also exhibited myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis (Fig. 1.11C). 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 03*
The rapid increase in the weight of the mouse was a result of substantial 
ascites and subcutaneous oedema (Fig. 1.11D). These phenotypes were 
consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) resulting in congestive heart 
failure (CHF). 
Figure 1.11. The Python phenotype. (A) A 13-week-old Python mouse and 
wild type control of the C3H/HeN strain, showing the grossly enlarged body 
size. (B) The hearts excised from the 13-week-old Python and wild type control 
mice, displaying bi-ventricular and bi-atrial dilation (C) MSB staining of heart 
sections from Python and wild type mice. Note the enlarged cardiomyocytes 
(indicated by the red bracket) and increased collagen deposition (indicated by 
the black bracket) (D) H&E stained dermal connective tissue of Python and 
wild type control mice; the Python mouse displays subcutaneous oedema 
(Ashrafian et al., 2010). 
The phenotype was inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and was fully 
penetrant in both males and females, though the onset of overt CHF symptoms 
occurs earlier in males (Ashrafian et al., 2010). Homozygosity for the mutation 
results in lethality midway through embryogenesis (Ashrafian et al., 2010). The 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 04*
onset of overt CHF appears to be influenced by genetic background as CHF 
symptoms develop more rapidly when the Python mutation is on the C3H/HeN 
background compared to C57BL/6J (Ashrafian et al., 2010). 
Genetic mapping defined a small region of 787kb on chromosome 16 
from 16q15.9 to 16q16.7 in which the mutation resided. Sequencing of all 
exons and intron/exon junctions in the three genes in this region (Pkp2, Fdge4 
and Dnm1l) identified a single nucleotide substitution (T  G) that resulted in 
the substitution of a cysteine to a phenylalanine at amino acid position 452 
(C452F) of the DNM1L protein (Fig. 1.12A). The mutation is located within the M 
domain. The cysteine residue is highly conserved in DNM1L across species 
(Fig. 1.12B) suggesting that change in this residue is not well tolerated. The 
cysteine is not reported to participate in disulphide bonding (Faelber et al., 
2011, Ford et al., 2011). Its location suggests that it is more likely to disrupt 
intramolecular interactions within the DNM1L monomer rather than affect 
interactions between monomers (Fig. 1.13A). This is supported by a helix-
wheel projection of the region around the Python mutation that predicts the 
mutation is located within one face of the helix containing principally 
hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1.13B). The mutated site is therefore likely to be 
buried within the protein and unable to come into contact with another protein. 
This face may however be involved in an intramolecular interactions within the 
DNM1L monomer (Ashrafian et al., 2010). 
As Dnm1l is ubiquitously expressed (Kamimoto et al., 1998) the mutant 
phenotype might manifest itself in all cells. Mitochondrial morphology is altered 
in fibroblasts isolated from neonatal Python mice. Yet, energy metabolism is 
severely affected in the heart, but not in other tissue type examined such as 
liver and brain (Ashrafian et al., 2010).

1.5 Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is 
responsible for almost 200,000 deaths each year in the UK, accounting for 
more than 20% of all hospital admissions in individuals over sixty-five years of 
age (Allender et al., 2008). 
  Cardiomyopathies are a subset of heart conditions, which specifically 
affect the heart muscle. From birth cardiomyocytes rely on hypertrophy for 
growth as hyperplasia becomes very limited. The closure of the ductus 
arteriosus blood vessel, which allows blood flow from the right ventricle to 
bypass the fluid filled lungs of the foetus, leads to a sudden increase in preload 
for the left side of the heart. This sudden increased demand is met with a 
hypertrophic response, activated about 3 days after birth.  
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs when cardiomyocytes 
exhibit a massive hypertrophic response, causing thickening of the ventricle 
walls. Despite this thickening, ventricle size often remains the same, and so 
may block blood flow out of the heart. This is known as obstructive HCM. 
Symptoms include chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath and fainting as a 
result of increased workload put on the ventricles. If blood flow is not blocked, 
this is termed non-obstructive HCM. In both types of HCM the ventricles are 
able to hold less blood due to the increased thickness of walls and so less 
space inside the ventricles. The heart may also experience hypercontractility, 
in which the heart is unable to relax and fill with blood, leading to high blood 
pressure in the ventricles and vessels of the lung. Cardiomyocytes may 
become damaged and electrical signals may become disrupted causing 
arrhythmias. HCM is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest during physical 
activity; on the other hand, some people with HCM may have no symptoms 
(Cohen et al., 1964).  
 Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) mainly affects older adults. In RCM, 
normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This leads to ventricle rigidity and so 
the heart is unable to relax and fill with blood, as in HCM. This reduction in 
blood flow can lead to problems such as heart failure and arrhythmias. The 
atria also become enlarged (Hayashi et al., 1998). 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 1/*
Like RCM, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) occurs when 
muscle tissue is replaced with scar tissue. In ARVD, however, this is specific to 
the right ventricle. This can disrupt electrical signals, causing arrhythmias and 
may cause symptoms such as palpitations and fainting after physical activity. 
ARVD is also a cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young athletes (Dalla Volta, 
1989, Thiene et al., 1988). 
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type of 
cardiomyopathy. The age in which people are likely to have DCM ranges from 
20 to 60 years, males being more affected than females. DCM is characterised 
by systolic dysfunction and left ventricular dilation, often spreading to all four 
chambers as the disease progresses. As a result, force transduction is 
impaired often leading to arrhythmia and congestive heart failure (CHF) 
(Richardson et al., 1996). The molecular mechanisms underlying DCM remain 
to be elucidated. It is estimated that between 20-50% of cases are familial in 
nature. DCM-causing mutations have been identified in genes encoding 
sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, nuclear envelope, intermediary filament, 
sarcoplasmic reticulum and desmosomal proteins (Table 1.1).  
The proteins listed in Table. 1.1 are common to a single pathway that 
links Ca
 signalling, ATP production, contraction and transduction of the 
contractile force within a cardiomyocyte. Upon Ca
 entry into the cell, the 
ryanodine receptor (RYR2) releases Ca
 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 
into the cytosol, a process known as Ca
-induced Ca
 release (CICR). Ca
enters the sarcomere where it binds to and shifts the tropomyosin complex 
away from the myosin head. While some Ca
 is taken back up into the SR via 
the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca
 ATPase (SERCA), the 
mitochondria also take up Ca
, necessary for activating enzymes within the 
mitochondrial matrix required for ATP production. ATP is then transported out 
of the mitochondria via the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and binds to 
the vacant myosin head in the sarcomere. The energy generated upon ATP 
hydrolysis leads to the movement of the actin filament to the centre of the 
sarcomere causing contraction. Desmin connects the contractile apparatus to 
other structural elements of the cell such as the nucleus and dystro-glycan 
complex, transducing the contractile force across the cell and between cells 
(Fig. 1.14). It therefore becomes plausible that an alteration in any of the 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 17*
proteins involved in this pathway from ER Ca
 release, mitochondrial Ca
uptake, ATP production, sarcomeric contraction to the transduction of the 
contractile force may lead to a similar phenotype (Knollmann and Roden, 
2008).

Energy dysregulation is at the centre of many forms of heart disease (Tian and 
Barger, 2006). Mitochondria become highly organised in the adult 
cardiomyocyte, the reason for which remains unknown. Mitochondria are 
central to energy production within the cell (Chidsey et al., 1966), and 
constitute a significant proportion of a typical cardiomyocyte, so might be 
expected to be important in maintaining proper cardiomyocyte function. This is 
supported by recent evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the 
development of disease (Ashrafian et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2009, Ong et al., 
2010). 
At birth, the myocardium switches from the glycolytic pathway to fatty 
acid OXPHOS as the major source of ATP production. This provides the 
myocardium with the source of high-energy production, vital for the beating 
cardiomyocytes. As a comparison, fatty acids can provide up to 131 ATP 
molecules per fatty acid molecule, whereas glucose yields 38 and glycolysis 
yields just 2 (Tian and Barger, 2006).   
Initially, a hypothesis to account for the development of HCM 
postulated that mutant sarcomeric proteins depressed contractility. In response 
to this stress, expression of stress-responsive factors are increased, such as 
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) and 
angiotensin II leading to compensatory hypertrophy (Fig. 1.15A) (Marian, 
2000). The problem, however, is that this hypothesis cannot explain those 
cases of HCM in which contractility is increased, nor can it explain the 
progressive decline in cardiac function, as the mutation is present from birth, 
but is not apparent until at least puberty. 
 An alternative theory was proposed based on energy dysregulation as 
the principle cause of HCM. With inefficient ATP utilisation, cardiomyocyte 
energy levels would become compromised, affecting SR Ca
 uptake, leading 
to an increased prolonged cytosolic Ca
 concentration, activating downstream 
pathways that resulted in HCM (Fig. 1.15B) (Ashrafian et al., 2003).  During 
puberty the heart increases in size significantly and concomitantly increases in 
its demand for energy, while ATP levels decline with ageing due to 
mitochondrial dysfunction (Wallace, 1999). This would help to explain the 
progressive decline seen in HCM, as any energy dysregulation would be 
exacerbated in effect with time. In support of this theory, sudden cardiac death

(SCD) during competitive sports could be explained by energy compromise 
being most noticeable during strenuous exercise. Further support is provided 
when considering the range of gene mutations reported in HCM. A MYH7 
mutation leads to a greater proportion of detachment of the myosin head from 
actin before the power stroke is completed, thereby consuming ATP, but with a 
lower stroke volume.  Similarly, mutant troponin-T increases contractile 
velocity, but shortens the power stroke, decreasing power output for each ATP 
hydrolysed (Ashrafian et al., 2003). It may be that mutations in genes involved 
in ATP utilisation, ATP production or calcium handling can result in HCM and 
similar cardiac conditions.

Figure 1.15. Hypotheses to explain the development of HCM. A) The 
hypothesis of compensatory hypertrophy whereby contractility is decreased 
due to mutant contractile proteins, leading to diastolic and systolic dysfunction. 
Subsequent activation of stress-responsive factors results in compensatory 
hypertrophy. B) The energy depletion model where inefficient utilization of ATP 
decreases the ATP:ADP ratio. This in turn increases cytosolic Ca
, leading to 
the increased activation of calcineurin via the activated Ca
-bound calmodulin. 
Calcineurin dephosphorylates nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT), 
increasing its translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of 
prohypertrophic gene expression. The altered adenosine nucleotide ratio also 
increases demands on mitochondria and ROS production increases damaging 
the mitochondria. Mitochondrial failure can then lead to apoptosis or further 
reduce the ATP:ADP ratio progressively increasing cytosolic Ca
. Hypertrophy 
is the end result (Ashrafian et al., 2003, Heineke and Molkentin, 2006, Marian, 
2000).

1.6 Mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy 
Several genes have been implicated in the development of heart failure 
through generation of mouse models. 
The first model of DCM established in a genetically modified organism was that 
of the muscle LIM protein (MLP)  deficient mouse (Arber et al., 1997). Initially 
generated to assess the role of MLP in muscle differentiation, this mouse 
model then provided a means to test theories of the effect of the disruption of 
cytoarchitecture on development of disease. MLP is a positive regulator of 
myogenic differentiation, associating with the actin-based cytoskeleton and 
proposed to function in muscle stretch sensing (Arber et al., 1994, Arber and 
Caroni, 1996). While the protein is highly expressed in all striated muscle in 
neonates, its expression declines in adult skeletal muscle, but remains high in 
adult cardiomyocytes (Arber et al., 1994). MLP has been shown to interact with 
telethonin (T-cap) and titin at the z-discs, which define the boundaries of the 
sarcomere (Knoll et al., 2002). The interaction between T-cap and titin is 
essential to sarcomeric function in coordinating contraction and force 
generation.  MLP has been shown to mediate this interaction and is, thus, an 
important requirement for z-disc architecture (Knoll et al., 2002). 
 mice develop DCM within the first month of life, with dilation of all 
four chambers and notable hypertrophy. After the onset of overt symptoms, the 
mice died 20-30 hours later and possessed a 24 fold increase in the size of 
the heart. However only 50% of Mlp
 mice developed DCM and explanations 
as to why remain obscure (Arber et al., 1997). As in Mlp
 mouse cardiac 
muscle, skeletal muscle also display swollen muscle fibres, however the 
phenotype in the heart appears more extreme. This may be due to increased 
workload of the heart and the higher number of membrane attachment sites 
per sarcomere (Arber et al., 1997). 
Screening of over 1200 DCM patients revealed a mutation within the 
MLP gene, W4R, converting a tryptophan residue to an arginine residue. The 
mutation was found in nine individuals from different families, all of which 
displayed DCM symptoms similar to those of the Mlp
 mouse (Knoll et al., 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 15*
2002). Mutations in the proteins T-cap (R87Q) and titin (V54M & A743V) (Itoh-
Satoh et al., 2002) identified in DCM patients also showed impaired 
interactions between MLP, T-cap, titin and #-actinin, emphasising alterations in 
z-line architecture may be important in the development of DCM. 
  As the contractile machinery is dependent on ATP for energy, a defect 
in OXPHOS or in genes on which the process relies will lead to a decrease in 
fatty acid oxidation and shift ATP production back to anaerobic glycolysis. 
Although this will be a general effect on the whole organism, a much more 
severe impact in cardiomyocytes is predicted because of the increased energy 
demand of the heart (Schiff et al., 2011). This would explain why the later 
stages of heart failure often appear to be so tissue specific (Tian and Barger, 
2006). This switch to glycolysis is accompanied with increased lactic acid 
production, which itself can result in damage to the heart and may trigger DCM 
(Huttemann et al., 2012). Similarly, increased ROS production as a result of 
mitochondrial Ca
 overload may cause oxidative damage to components of 
the ETC or mtDNA, which encodes components of the ETC (Ide et al., 1999). 
Cox7a1 
A mouse knockout of the cardiac-specific subunit 7a mouse cytochrome c 
oxidase (COX7A1) was generated in order to provide insight into the role of the 
cardiac specific isoform. It was noticed that both Cox7a1
 and Cox7a1
develop DCM at 6 weeks of age, despite the fact that ATP levels in the heart 
were notably higher in the mutants. It was postulated that a decrease in energy 
production per mitochondrion leads to increased mitochondrial proliferation, 
thereby increasing the net energy production in the heart tissue with dilation 
being an adaptive response to accommodate the increased number of 
mitochondria. This is, however, in contrast to the theory in which dilation is the 
result from failing cells. 
Astonishingly, these mice recover from DCM from 6 months of age. The 
liver isoform, COX7A2 was found to be increased, approximately 5-fold in the 
hearts of the COC7A1-deficient mice, when compared to wild type controls. 
This increase may possibly compensate for the loss of the cardiac isoform and 
may explain how these mice recover from DCM (Huttemann et al., 2012).  
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 26*
The enzymes of the ETC require a number of subunits encoded by the 
mitochondrial genome. Transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM)-deficient 
mice (Tfam
) provide evidence for the importance of the mitochondrial 
genome. Tfam activates mitochondrial transcription and has a role in 
mitochondrial genome replication. Tfam
 mice do not survive past E10.5. The 
mitochondria of the hearts of these mice are grossly enlarged and display 
abnormal cristae formation and complex IV deficiency (Larsson et al., 1998). 
 mice are also affected. They are able to survive up to 20 days 
postnatally before developing DCM. As well as a 50% decrease in TFAM 
protein expression, they also exhibit a 34% reduction in mtDNA copy number 
and a 22% reduction in mitochondrial transcripts. Similarly, complex IV was 
shown to be reduced, with some cardiomyocytes being complex IV-deficient 
and complex II-hyperactive (Wang et al., 1999). Mitochondrial copy number 
and transcript level therefore prove to be very important in OXPHOS, in which 
a reduction is likely to lead to reduced ATP production and energy deficiency, 
critical for the high energy-demanding cardiomyoctes. 
Export of ATP out of the mitochondria relies on the transmembrane protein, 
ANT, which also transports ADP into the mitochondrial matrix at the same rate 
(Souverijn et al., 1973). ANT-1 is an isoform expressed in high energy-
demanding cells such as heart, skeletal muscle and brain. ANT-1 recessive 
mutations were discovered in human patients exhibiting mitochondrial 
myopathy and cardiomyopathy, with exercise intolerance and hypertrophy 
(Palmieri et al., 2005). Before ANT-1 mutations were found in humans, a 
mouse model of Ant-1
 was created and reported to display mitochondrial 
myopathy, lactic acidemia and increased ROS production (Esposito et al., 
1999). The hearts of these mice demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy, 
ventricular dilation and a decrease in cardiac output at an earlier age to that of 
wild type control mice (Narula et al., 2011).  
Inhibition of the ADP/ATP exchange will deprive ATP synthase of 
substrate, blocking proton transport into the matrix via ATP synthase, thereby 
leading to a hyperpolarised MMP and a decrease in electron transfer. These 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 2/*
electrons then become redirected to O2 molecules increasing the production of 
ROS, which has previously been shown to damage the mitochondrial genome. 
In accordance, mtDNA in the heart of 16-20-month-old Ant1
 mice was shown 
to exhibit as much rearrangement of a 32-month-old wild type. This increased 
mtDNA rearrangement will further inhibit the ETC and so decrease ATP 
production as well as ATP transport, ultimately leading to DCM (Narula et al., 
2011). 
The impact of increased ROS generation on OXPHOS has been further 
evidenced by mouse models lacking manganese superoxide dismutase 
(MnSOD2). MnSOD2 is known to be the first line of defence against ROS 
produced as a by-product of OXPHOS. In one mouse model, in which Sod2 
had been inactivated by the deletion of exon 3, mice die by 5 days of age from 
DCM. As a result of increased ROS levels, a reduction in complex II and 
aconitase (a CAC enzyme) was detected, most dramatically in the heart. This 
is probably due to the increased OXPHOS activity in cardiomyocytes (Benard 
et al., 2006), which requires an increased activity of antioxidant defences in 
order to prevent ROS build up. A reduction in fatty acid -oxidation and 
glycolysis will therefore lead to energy starvation in the heart eventually 
leading to DCM and CHF (Li et al., 1995). A second mouse model, a knockout 
of Sod2, was also created and showed an increased survival period. Unlike the 
previous model, these mice display a number a pathologic phenotypes 
including neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia and brainstem and rapid 
fatigue, with only 10% developing DCM (Lebovitz et al., 1996).   
Fkbp12 
 cycling deficiencies leading to heart failure have been reported in a 
number of mouse models. The FK506 binding protein (FKBP12) modulates the 
activity of the ryanodine receptors, which release Ca
 from the ER, and 
hence, are involved in Ca
 signalling during contraction. An Fkbp12-deficient 
mouse model was developed in order to deduce the functions of the protein. 
The majority of these mice died between E14.5 and birth. It was noted that the 
hearts in these mice displayed diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and were 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 27*
shown to exhibit 4-chamber dilation with thinner walls and ventricular septal 
defects. These defects are typical of DCM. The heart weight was also 
increased and some developed liver hepatopathy as a secondary effect to 
cardiac congestion of the liver (Shou et al., 1998).  
 FKBP12 controls the opening of the ryanodine receptor in skeletal 
muscle (RYR1) and in cardiac muscle (RYR2). In Fkbp12-deficient mice, RYR1 
and RYR2 mostly existed in a sub conductance state, however the effect of 
abnormal gating properties was only seen in the heart, which displayed 
increased Ca
 leak from the SR. This difference may be explained by the 
difference in control mechanisms of Ca
 release between the tissues; CICR 
mainly controls that of the heart, whereas voltage-sensors are also used as 
well as CICR in skeletal muscle (Shou et al., 1998). This increase in cytosolic 
 has been reproduced in other mouse models of heart failure and 
therefore may prove to be a principle cause of heart dysfunction. 
Prkca 
Protein kinase C alpha (PKCa) is activated by intracellular Ca
, which leads to 
the dephosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN). This in turn inactivates the 
SERCA, reducing SR Ca
 uptake and consequently reduced contractile 
output. Hearts of Prkca-deficient mice exhibit increased contractility as a result 
of the increased SR Ca
uptake. Double knockout
Prkca- and Mlp- deficient 
mice are protected from heart failure. The lack of PKCa enhances the 
contractility of the heart that is otherwise diminished in mlp
 mice, restoring 
sufficient cardiac function (Braz et al., 2004).  
Camk2a 
-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a downstream target 
of the -adrenergic receptor (AR) signalling cascade, activated by cytosolic 
 during contraction. Excessive AR activation has been shown to increase 
cytosolic Ca
 levels, leading to cardiac remodelling, myocardial dysfunction, 
hypertrophy and dilation (Zhang et al., 2005). Evidence suggests upregulation 
of CaMKII increases cytosolic Ca
 causing an influx via the L-type Ca
channel (LTCC) and increase SR Ca
 release via the RYR2. A genetic mouse 
model of cardiac CaMKII inhibition was created by encoding an inhibitory 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 28*
peptide, autocamtide-3 derived inhibitory peptide (AC3-I) fused to the cardiac-
specific Myh6 promoter. CaMKII inactivation was shown to prevent cardiac 
dysfunction that can result from excessive AR stimulation supporting the 
hypothesis that reducing cytosolic Ca
 prevents heart failure (Zhang et al., 
2005).  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disorder of progressive muscle 
weakness, eventually affecting the heart, with a decline in cardiac output and 
ventricular dilation as a result of DCM (Muntoni et al., 1993, Towbin et al., 
1993). In the mdx mouse model of DMD, which exhibit skeletal muscle 
degeneration and later, DCM, increased Ca
 levels were found in the cytosol 
of cardiomyocytes, which may be the underlying cause of DCM in mdx mice 
(Bridges, 1986, Dunn and Radda, 1991).  
Phosphorylation of RYR2 at serine 2808 (S2808) by PKA has been 
shown to be a significant event in heart failure development (Marx et al., 2000, 
Chen-Izu et al., 2007) and found to be increased in the mdx mouse. A knock-in 
mouse model preventing the activation of S2808 by substituting the serine for 
an alanine (S2808A) resulted in improved signs of cardiac output following 
myocardial infarction (Jiang et al., 2002). When mdx mice were crossed with 
S2808A
 mice to obtain double mutants, the cytosolic Ca
 levels and SR 
 leak were reduced. Subsequently, the development of age-related 
cardiomyopathy was almost completely prevented, with heart contractility 
greatly improved. (Sarma et al., 2010). 
Casq2 
A decrease in cytosolic Ca
 has also been shown to cause heart failure. 
Calsequestrin binds to and sequesters Ca
 in the SR lumen. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing calsequestrin in cardiomyocytes exhibit reduced Ca
 release 
from the SR, down-regulation of RYR2, up-regulation of SERCA and cardiac 
hypertrophy (Jones et al., 1998). This may be due to less Ca
 being available 
for mitochondrial uptake leading to a decrease in ATP production, and 
resultant energy deficiency within the heart (Limas et al., 1987).

1.7 Overview of project 
The Python mouse develops CHF as a result of a point mutation in the gene 
Dnm1l. Overt symptoms become apparent at different ages on different 
congenic backgrounds and although Dnm1l is ubiquitously expressed, the 
mutation results in a heart-specific defect. Using Python as a mouse model for 
DCM and DNM1L biology, this project focuses on identifying the underlying 
mechanisms by which a defect in a mitochondrial fission protein leads to a 
decrease in energy production, and characterising the extent to which the 
mutant phenotype is manifest in different cell types. Experiments will aim to 
identify the affect of Python on DNM1L protein folding, intermolecular 
interactions, cellular localisation, mitochondrial morphology and Ca
signalling.

1.8 Hypotheses and aims 
1.8.1 Hypotheses 
1. The Dnm1l
 mutation alters the intrinsic nature of the encoded protein, leading 
to one or more of: 
a. Failure of oligomerisation of DNM1L into higher order structures. 
b. Failure of stable assembly of, or dissociation from, a functional fission 
complex. 
c. Failure of cycling between the cytosol and the OMM. 
2. The Dnm1l
mutation results in cardiac ATP deficiency via dysregulation of 
one or more of:   
a. Ca
 regulation. Given the key role of Ca
 in mitochondrial OXPHOS 
and known defects in Ca
 cycling observed in cells with mutations in the 
mitochondrial fusion factor MFN2, Dnm1l
 might alter ER-mitochondrial 
interactions and thus abrogate efficient Ca
 signalling in mitochondria. 
b. Mitophagy: defective removal of senescent mitochondria with    
subnormal function may result in an abnormal accumulation of poorly 
functioning mitochondria. 
3. The Python mutation is manifest in other tissue types and there are, as yet, 
unidentified phenotypic abnormalities in Python mice that affect other body 
systems.

 protein by: 
a. Investigating self-interactions of DNM1L and interactions with other 
proteins.

c. Assessing GTPase and mitochondrial fission activity of the mutant 
protein. 
2. Examining the effect of Dnm1l
 on cellular processes. Specifically:

Chapter 2 : Methods 
2.1 List of mouse strains: 
All mice were housed in numbers no greater than 8, with ad libitum access to 
food and water. Colonies were maintained as described below. 
Python- B61 
The colony was maintained by breeding Dnm1l
 (hereafter referred to as 
+/Py) males with Dnm1l
 (hereafter referred to as +/+) females on the 
background strain C57BL/6J. All animals were sacrificed by way of cervical 
dislocation. 
Python-C3H 
The colony was maintained by breeding +/Py males with +/+ females on the 
background strain C3H/HeN. All animals were sacrificed by way of cervical 
dislocation. 
Python x R6/2 
R6/2 mice were provided from Professor Gillian Bates of Kings College 
London. R6/2 males were mated with Python females on the C57BL/6J 
background, with offspring of the following four genotypes: R6/2
 Dnm1l
designates wild type; R6/2
 Dnm1l
, indicates positive for the Python 
mutation; while R6/2
 Dnm1l
means positive for the R6/2 transgene only, 
and R6/2
 Dnm1l
(hereafter referred to as R6/2 x Python) is positive for 
both the R6/2 transgene and the Python mutations, respectively.

2.3 Genotyping  
2.3.1 DNA extraction 
DNA was extracted from mice ear biopsies by incubation at 55C in a total 
volume of 150l tail lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.5, 10mM EDTA and 
0.5% Tween 20) containing 300g/ml proteinase K. Following the incubation, 
the DNA was diluted by the addition of 600l Millipore water. 
 2.3.2 PCR amplification  
To identify Python mice, the DNA was subsequently amplified using primers 
designed to create a restriction site in the presence of the mutation, but not in 
wild type (Appendix II). R6/2 transgenic mice were identified by amplifying 
extracted DNA using primers, which produce a 170bp fragment in transgenic 
mice only (Appendix XII). The PCR reaction carried out for both mutations is 
shown in Table 2.1.

2.3.3 Restriction assay with XapI for Dnm1l
5l of the PCR reaction mix was incubated at 37C for two hours, in a 20l 
reaction containing 4U of XapI enzyme and 1x buffer tango (33mM Tris-
acetate (pH7.9), 10mM magnesium acetate, 66mM potassium acetate, 
0.1mg/ml BSA). The digested product was analysed by electrophoresis on a 
4% agarose, TBE gel, containing 1g/ml Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) at 10V/cm. 
The presence of bands of specific sizes indicates the genotype (See appendix 
III). 
2.4 Western blot analyses 
Brain and heart tissue samples were excised from mice and immediately snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was then minced and homogenised in 
RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% 
SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1x protease inhibitor cocktail 
(PIC) (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Protein concentration was 
determined by means of a Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were 
loaded onto a sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gel. The stacking gel composed 
of 4% acrylamide, 14mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.06% ammonium 
persulfate (APS) and 0.11% N,N,N,N-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). 
Resolving gels contained 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide were used for 
analysing DNM1L, OPA1, MFN2, calnexin, AMPK, P-AMPK and #-tubulin and 
15% acrylamide/bisacrylamide for TIM23, LC3 and HTT analysis. Other 
resolving gel constituents common to both acrylamide concentrations were: 
0.375M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% APS and 0.05% TEMED. The gel 
was placed in a tank with enough SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(PAGE) running buffer (2.5M Tris, 0.5M glycine and 0.1% SDS) to cover the 
whole of the gel. Samples were boiled at 100C for 5 mins in loading buffer 
(12.5% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.625% bromophenol 
blue and 20% -Mercaptoethanol) to separate into single protein molecules 
and subsequently electrophoresed at 12.5V/cm.

Proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare, Little 
Chalfont, UK), by means of Western blot in transfer buffer (25mM Tris, 192mM 
glycine and 20% methanol, pH 8.3) for 1 hour at 100V. 
 Antibodies against Drp1, Tim23, #-tubulin, calnexin, AMPK, P-AMPK, 
LC3, Opa1 and Mfn2 were used to detect proteins. A secondary anti-mouse 
HRP-conjugated antibody was used for Drp1, Tim23, Opa1, Mfn2, HTT and #-
tubulin, while a secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody was used for 
calnexin, AMPK, P-AMPK and LC3; in connection with ECL Western Blotting 
Detection Reagents (RPN2106, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) to detect 
the individual proteins, which were developed using an SRX 1-1A developer 
(Photon Imaging, Swindon, UK) after an exposure of between 2 mins and 20 
mins.

2.5 His-tag protein purification 
His-tag fusion constructs of Dnm1l were created containing either wild type 
Dnm1l or Dnm1l
 using the vector pET101 (Appendix IV). These constructs 
were transformed into DH10 E.coli bacterial cells by resuspending cells in 
transformation buffer (LB medium containing 10% polyethylene glycol 
(PEG)3350, 10mM MgCl2 and 10mM MgSO4) and mixing with 50ng DNA diluted 
in KCM (100M KCl, 30M CaCl2 and 50M MgCl2). The DNA/cell mixture was 
incubated on ice for 20 mins then at room temperature for 10 mins, before 
being placed in a shaking incubator for 1 hour at 37C with 1ml LB. The cells 
were plated onto to LB-agar plates containing 100g/ml Ampicillin. Positive 
clones were confirmed by sequencing of the fusion construct then selected for 
induction of fusion protein expression. 
Growing a clone containing the pET101 vector in a 50ml culture at 37C 
for 5 hours containing 1mM IPTG induced fusion protein expression. The cells 
were then harvested and resuspended in 5ml lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 
pH8.0, 0.1M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 100U/ml DNase, 0.2mg/ml lysozyme, 15mM 
2-Mercaptoethanol, 0.1% NP-40, 1x PIC) and incubated on ice for 20 mins. 
Two passes through a TS 1.1 cell disrupter at 4C completed cell lysis. The 
resulting lysate was then mixed with equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose beads 
(Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK), which binds to the his-tag, for 2 hours at 4C, 
followed by 2 washes in washing buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.3M NaCl, 
0.02% NaN3). The fusion proteins were then eluted in 2 x 500l elution buffer 1 
(50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.3M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 100mM Imidazol) and a 
further 2 x 500l elution buffer 2 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.3M NaCl, 0.02% 
NaN3, 300mM Imidazol). The eluted protein was verified by SDS PAGE and 
Western blot analysis using anti-Drp1 antibody as described in section 2.4. 
2.6 Protein extraction & renaturation 
Full-length protein was extracted from an SDS gel and soaked in 1mM DTT for 
15 mins then homogenised using a Teflon homogeniser. 2.5 volumes of elution 
buffer (5mM DTT, 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS, 0.15M NaCl, 0.1mM 
EDTA) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 30C. The eluted protein was 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 37*
collected by a 30s centrifugation at 5000rpm. 5 volumes of -20C 
methanol:acetone (1:1) were added to the eluted protein, gently vortexed and 
incubated overnight at -20C. The protein was then pelleted by centrifugation 
at 10,000rpm for 15 mins at -5C and washed in -20C methanol:acetone (1:1). 
In order to renature the proteins, the samples were gently resuspended in 
buffer A (100mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 12.5mM MgCl2, 6M Guanidine, 10% 
Glycerol, 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA). The concentrations of 
proteins were determined by means of a Bradford assay. 60ng of wild type 
DNM1L and 60ng of Python DNM1L were renatured individually. 60ng of both 
samples were also renatured together in a third sample. 2 volumes of buffer B 
(1mM DTT, 0.1mM KCl, 0.01% IGEPAL, 12.5mM MgCl2, 10% Glycerol, 25 mM 
HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) was then added to each sample and 
dialyzed at room temperature against 250ml buffer B. After 3 hours the protein 
samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C. 
2.7 GTPase activity 
GTPase activity was measured by means of the PiColourLock
 system (303-
0030, Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, UK). 60ng purified protein samples 
were prepared in a total volume of 400l. Proteins were also extracted from the 
brains of 3 wild type and 3 Python C57BL/6J mice aged 5-weeks-old by 
homogenisation in NP-40 lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 
2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4).  
 400l of the substrate / buffer mix (100mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 5mM 
MgCl2 and 1mM GTP) were then added to each sample. 200l of Gold mix 
(99% PiColourLock
 Gold + 1% accelerator) was added to each sample and 
incubated at room temperature for 2 mins. A negative control was also 
prepared substituting the protein samples with water. 80l of stabiliser (part of 
the Pi ColourLock Gold kit) was then added and further incubated for 30 mins 
at room temperature. The absorptions at wavelength 635nm were taken, using 
the negative control to calibrate the JENWAY 6305 spectrophotometer. The 
absorption readings were then converted to inorganic phosphate (Pi) 
concentration using a standard curve of absorption readings against known 
concentrations of Pi.

2.8 RNA isolation 
RNA was isolated from heart and brain tissues and also ES cells and 
cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells. The tissues extracted from wild type and 
Python mice were homogenised in 1ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Ltd., 
Paisley, UK) using a polytron. The homogenate was then incubated at room 
temperature for 5 mins. In order to isolate RNA from cells, they were first 
trypsinized and resuspended in 1ml TRIzol for 5 mins at room temperature. 
The following protocol applies to both tissues and cells. The tissue / cell lysate 
was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000rpm for 1 min. 0.2ml chloroform was 
then added to the supernatant and vortexed vigorously for 15s. Following a 3-
minute incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 
13,000rpm for 15 mins, separating the solution into different phases. The 
colourless upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and combined 
with 0.5ml isopropanol. Following a 10-minute incubation the RNA was 
pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000rpm for 10 mins at 4C. After 2 washes in 
70% ethanol, the pellet was air dried and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. 
RNA quantification was achieved using the NanoDrop ND-1000 3.3 system. 
2.9 Reverse transcription  
RNA isolated from cells / tissues was converted into cDNA using the 
QuaniTect Reverse Transcription kit (205310, Qiagen, Crawley, UK). 1g of 
RNA was incubated in 1 x gDNA wipeout buffer for 2 mins at 42C to remove 
any contaminated genomic DNA. The RNA sample was then incubated for 15 
mins at 42C with 1l quantiscript reverse transcriptase, 1 x reverse 
transcriptase buffer and 1l reverse transcriptase random primers in a total 
volume of 14l. The quantiscript reverse transcriptase was then inactivated 
with a 3-minute incubation at 95C. The cDNA product was stored at -20C for 
use in further experiments.

2.10 Pyrosequencing 
Pyrosequencing analysis was carried out in collaboration with Dr. Phil 
Chambers, University of Leeds. PCR was performed on the cDNA samples of 
heart and brain of 2 wild type and 2 Python mice aged 5-6 weeks on the 
C57BL/6J background. Initially, a 286bp product within exon 11 of Dnm1l, 
surrounding the position of the mutation (Appendix V), was amplified. Primers 
for PCR amplification and Pyrosequencing analysis (Appendix V) were 
designed using proprietary Pyrosequencing assay design software version 
2.0.1.15 (Qiagen, Crawley, UK).  PCR reactions contained 12.5l of Qiagen 
HotStarTaq Master Mix (Qiagen, Crawley, UK), MgCl2 to a final concentration 
of 2mM, 200nM each of forward and reverse primers and 10ng of DNA in a 
final volume of 25l.  Thermal cycling conditions were 94C for 12 minutes 
followed by 40 cycles of 94C for 10 seconds, 55C for 20 seconds and 72C 
for 20 seconds.  PCR products were sequenced by Pyrosequencing on a 
PyroMark ID system (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) following the manufacturers 
protocols.  Pyrosequencing data were analysed using PyroMark ID software in 
the SNP mode in order to quantify allelic expression. 
 During the process of pyrosequencing, as in PCR, deoxynucleotide 
triphosphates (dNTPs) are added sequentially to the complementary template, 
however dNTPs are labelled with pyrophosphate (PPi) in this reaction. As a 
dNTP is added, PPi is released in a quantity equimolar to the amount of 
nucleotide added. ATP sulfurase then converts PPi into ATP in the presence of 
adenosine 5 phosphate (APS). The ATP is then used in a reaction where 
luciferase catalyses the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, generating light 
in proportion to the amount of ATP present. The detection of this light creates 
signal intensity in proportion to the amount of nucleotide incorporated, creating 
a visible peak as shown in Figure 2.1. Apyrase degrades any unicorporated 
dNTPs and ATP.

Figure 2.1. Sequence of events during pyrosequencing analysis. dNTPs 
are incorporated according to their complementary template. PPi is released 
during dNTP incorporation and is subsequently converted into ATP by 
sulfurase in the presence of APS. ATP is then converted into light by luciferase 
as luciferin is also converted into oxyluciferin. The resulting light intensity is in 
proportion to the amount of dNTP incorporated at that position providing a 
quantitative means for allelic expression. Any unicorporated dNTP or ATP is 
degraded by Apyrase. Image from QIAGEN.

2.11 PCR cDNA amplification of cardiomyocyte markers 
After cardiomyocyte-induction of ES cells, PCR was used to determine the 
expression of a number of cardiomyocyte markers. Sequences within the 
coding regions of the following genes were tested for using RNA isolated from 
ES cells and induced-cardiomyocytes after reverse transcription: Actb, Gapdh, 
Pou5f1, Gata4, Myl7 and Myh7. See Appendix VI for primer sequences. The 
PCR conditions were:

Mutagenesis was achieved using the GeneTailor
 Mutagenesis System 
(12397-014, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The primers above were designed based 
on the Dnm1l cDNA sequence surrounding mutation site. Primers pairs were 
designed to contain a 5 overlapping region of 15-20 nucleotides plus an 
extended region of over 10 nucleotides with 1 of the pair containing the 
mutation immediately after the overlapping region. The plasmid DNA to be 
mutated was first methylated in the following reaction: 50ng plasmid DNA, 
0.8l 10X Methylation buffer, 0.8l 10X S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) and 2U 
DNA methylase in a total volume of 8l. The mixture was then incubated for 1 
hour at 37C.  
2l of the methylation reaction (12.5ng plasmid DNA) was then 
amplified using the primer pairs displayed in Table 2.4 under the following 
conditions: 25l reaction containing 12.5ng methylated DNA, 1U of 
AccuPrime
 Taq DNA polymerase High Fidlity (12346-086, Invitrogen, 
Paisley, UK), 1x AccuPrime
 PCR buffer 1 and 2M of each primer.  Thermal 
cycling conditions were 94C for 15 seconds followed by 35 cycles of 94C for 
30 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds and 68C for between 6 and 8 minutes (1min 
/ kb). A final step of 68C for 10 minutes was performed before completion of 
cycling. 
The PCR product was then transformed into DH10 E. Coli bacterial 
cells as previously described in section 2.5. Upon transformation into E.Coli, 
the methylated DNA (which doesnt contain the mutation) is degraded by the 
McrBC enzyme activity within the bacteria, leaving the unmethylated, mutated 
DNA only.

2.13 DNA isolation from bacterial cells 
Bacteria were cultured in LB containing the necessary antibiotic and 37C 
overnight. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 13000g for 1 min 
and resuspended in ice-cold solution 1 (25mM Tris-HCl, 10mM EDTA). 2 
volumes of solution 2 (0.2N NaOH, 1% SDS) is then added and mixed by 
inversion. Following a 5 minute incubation on ice 0.5 volumes of ice-cold 
solution 3 (3M Potassium acetate, 11.5% Glacial acetic acid) was added and 
centrifuged at 13000g for 5 mins. The supernatant was then transferred to a 
fresh tube and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol was added to precipitate the 
DNA out of solution. The DNA was then pelleted by centrifugation at 13000g 
for 5 mins and washed in 70% ethanol. Following a 10-min incubation at 
13000g, all of the supernatant was removed and the DNA pellet was air-dried 
before dissolving in TE Buffer (pH 8) (1mM EDTA, 10mM Tris-HCl) containing 
50g/ml RNase A.

2.14.1 Mouse skin fibroblasts 
Mouse skin fibroblasts were cultured from C57BL/6J or C3H/HeN neonates. A 
skin sample was removed from the mouse, washed in ethanol and cut into 
small pieces, which were then placed in a 10cm cell culture dish and incubated 
at 37C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-glutaMAX, 
containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) and 100U/ml:100g/ml penicillin : 
streptomycin. After 5 days in culture, a substantial number of fibroblasts grew 
from the tissue clumps. The cells were then trypsinized and passed through a 
cell strainer to remove the clumps of tissue for subsequent use. 
2.14.2 Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
MEFs were isolated from E9.5 (performed by Professor Neil Dear) or E14.5 
embryos. At E14.5 the embryos were removed from the uterus and placed in 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by decapitation and evisceration. 
The remaining tissue was cut up into small pieces and placed into a sterile 
conical flask containing 5mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK, 18406). 
At E9.5, the whole embryo was cut up into small pieces and placed into a 
conical flask containing 5mm glass beads. 10ml of trypsin was then added to 
the flask and incubated for 10 mins at 37C, 5% C02 with gentle stirring to aid 
in breaking up the tissue. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh 
tube and more trypsin was added to the tissue and beads to replace the trypsin 
removed. The incubation was repeated twice. The three supernatants were 
pooled and cells counted using a haemocytometer. The cells were then 
seeded at 10
 cells per T175 flask in DMEM-glutaMAX medium containing 
10% FCS and 100U/ml:100g/ml penicillin : streptomycin in order to expand by 
incubation at 37C, 5% CO2. When cells reached a confluency of 80  90% 
they were passaged by incubation in 3ml Trypsin / T175 flask for 5 mins at 
37C, 5% CO2, diluted by 50% in culture medium and centrifuged at 1500rpm 
for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The supernatant was then removed and cells 
resuspended in culture medium before seeding into flasks / dishes for 
subsequent use. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 46*
Immortalized MEF cell lines: DR_MEF_wt and DR_MEF_Py were generated 
using viral transfection with Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) 
performed by Dr. Houman Ashrafian and Dr. Tom Cahill of The Univeristy of 
Oxford. 
2.14.3 Embryonic stem (ES) cells 
ES cells were isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts (E3.5) from 
C57BL/6J mouse embryos, performed by Professor Neil Dear. ES cells are 
cultured on a feeder layer of MEFs. MEFs were prepared for feeder layer by 
incubation in DMEM, containing 10% FCS and 10g/ml Mitomycin C at 37C 
and 5% CO2 for 4 hours when the flasks reached 90% confluency. This leads 
to the arrest of the cell cycle of the MEFs therefore will not continue to divide 
when used as a feeder layer. Mitomycin C-treated MEFs are plated out at a 
density of 3 x 10
 cells per 10cm dish and incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 at least 
4 hours prior to seeding ES cells to allow them to attach to the dish, in DMEM 
+ glutaMAX containing 10% FCS and 100U/ml:100g/ml penicillin : 
streptomycin. Before seeding ES cells, the medium was changed to DMEM 
containing 20% FCS, L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.1mM 2-
Mercaptoethanol and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (1:500 dilution). ES cells 
were seeded onto the feeder layer at a density of 3 x 10
 cells per 10cm dish. 
Medium was changed daily when culturing ES cells and passaged after a 
maximum of 3 days in culture to prevent differentiation. ES cells were 
harvested by removing the medium on the cells, washing in PBS and 
trypsinizing for 5 mins at 37C, 5% CO2.  
2.14.4 Embryoid body formation 
ES cells were plated out at a density of 3 x 10
 cells in a 10cm non-adherent 
cell culture dish in 10ml DMEM containing 20% FCS, L-glutamine, 1% non-
essential amino acids and 0.1mM 2-Mercaptoethanol and cultured at 37C and 
5% CO2 for up to 5 days. 5ml extra medium was added every 48 hours. The 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 4/*
embryoid bodies were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000rpm for 5 mins. 
The supernatant was removed and cells resuspended in the same medium 
then plated out at 2 x 10
 cells onto 0.1% gelatinized 10cm dishes. The 
medium was changed every 3-4 days. 
2.14.5 Cardiomyocyte-induced differentiation of ES cells 
Embryoid bodies were formed and seeded onto gelatinized plates as described 
above (section 2.14.4). After 7 days at 37C, 5% CO2, medium was replaced 
with DMEM containing 4mg/ml polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 400M thioglycerol, 
10g/ml insulin, 25ng/ml bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), 5ng/ml 
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and 1x chemically defined lipids. The cells 
were incubated under hypoxic conditions at 37C, 5% CO2, 5% O2 for 72 
hours. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 20% serum 
replacement, 400M thioglycerol, 1x chemically defined lipids, 5mg/ml bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) and 280M ascorbic acid and cultured at 37C, 5% CO2 
for 72 hours. The final phase consisted of replacing the medium with DMEM 
containing 400M thioglycerol, 10g/ml insulin and 1x chemically defined lipids 
and culturing at 37C, 5% CO2 for up to 9 days, replacing the medium every 72 
hours.

Figure 2.2. ES cell differentiation. ES cells are seeded onto non-adherent 
cell culture dishes allowing them to aggregate and form embryoid bodies, 
where they begin to differentiate. After being exposed to specific conditions, 
the cells differentiate into beating clumps of cardiomyocytes. Scale bars 
represent 100m. Experimental protocols are detailed in sections 2.14.3, 
2.14.4 and 2.14.5. 
2.14.6 Adult mouse cardiomyocyte culture 
Cardiomyocyte isolation was performed in collaboration with Professor Ed 
White and culture with Professor Michelle Peckham. Hearts were excised from 
adult mice at the age of 12 weeks. The hearts were cut at the aortic arch, to 
allow them to quickly be attached onto a needle via the aorta in preparation for 
perfusion. The hearts were flushed with isolation solution (130mM NaCl, 
5.4mM KCl, 1.4mM MgCl2, 0.4mM NaH2PO4, 5mM HEPES, 10mM glucose, 
20mM taurine, 10mM creatine, 10mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM)), 
supplemented with 750M Ca
 and 1% heparin to prevent coagulation. The 
hearts were then attached to the perfusion pump with the needle attached to 
the aorta and perfused for 3 mins with isolation solution supplemented with 
1M EGTA. The perfusion fluid was then changed to isolation solution 
containing 1mg/ml collagenase and 0.1mg/ml protease (enzyme solution) and 
40ml of the enzyme solution was allowed to pass through the hearts, prior to 
dissection of the ventricles, which were then cut into pieces. The small 
ventricle fragments were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37C in enzyme 
solution. Dissociated cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 500rpm for 
40s; the supernatant was removed and the cells were washed in isolation 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 48*
buffer. The centrifugation step was repeated and the cells were resuspended 
in m199 medium, containing 10% FCS, 100U/ml:100g/ml penicillin / 
streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine, then seeded onto lamin-coated coverslips 
for 2 hours at 37C, 5% CO2. Mitochondria were labelled and imaged as 
described in section 2.15.  
2.14.7 Neuron culture 
The brains of 2-day-old Python and wild type C57BL/6J mice were dissected 
and placed in ice cold PBS containing 3mg/ml BSA. The tissue was then cut 
up and digested in PBS containing 3mg/ml BSA and 0.08% trypsin at 37C for 
20 mins. Non-dissociated tissue was removed by passing the digested tissue 
through a cell strainer. The supernatant was subsequently removed after 
centrifugation at 1000rpm for 7 mins and resuspended in 10ml plating medium 
(70% DMEM/Hams F12 medium, 30% Neurobasal medium, 1% glucose, 2mM 
L-glutamine, 2% B27, 100U/ml:100g/ml penicillin / streptomycin). The cells 
were then seeded onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips at various densities and 
cultured overnight at 37C, 5% CO2. Mitochondria were labelled as described 
in section 2.15. 
2.14.8 HeLa cell transfection 
HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips to a confluency of approximately 50%, 
in DMEM-glutaMAX containing 10% FCS. 2g of pLD11 DNA (Appendix VII), 
containing the relevant Dnm1l version (wild type, Python or K38A) was diluted 
in DMEM-glutaMAX to a final volume of 100l and incubated with diluted 
lipofectamine (10l lipofectamine + 90l DMEM-glutaMAX) for 30 minutes at 
room temperature. Another 200l DMEM-glutamMAX was then added to the 
DNA-lipofectamine mixture. The medium from the cells was then aspirated and 
replaced with 400l DMEM-glutaMAX before adding the DNA-lipofectamine 
mixture. The cells were then incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 for 5 hours before 
adding 1.2ml DMEM-glutamax containing 17% FCS (final concentration of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 40*
10%) and incubated again at 37C, 5% CO2 overnight. Mitochondria were 
stained as described in section 2.15. 
2.15 Mitochondria labelling 
Mitochondria were labelled in mouse skin fibroblasts, mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) ES cells, cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells, HeLa cells, 
cardiomyocytes and neurons for visualization by fluorescence microscopy. 
Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and treated with 200nM MitoTracker
Orange CMTMRos (M7510, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) in culture medium for 
45 mins at 37C, 5% CO2. After washing in PBS, cells were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The coverslips 
were then mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen 
Ltd., Paisley, UK) containing 10g/ml Hoechst 33258. Mitochondria were then 
visualised using the Texas red filter and nuclei, using the Dapi filter of the 
Zeiss ApoTome AXIO Imager and the AxioVision Re. 4.7 software. 
2.16 ER labelling 
Mouse skin fibroblasts were cultured on glass coverslips in organelle lights ER-
GFP transduction solution (O36212 component A, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) 
diluted to 40% in PBS and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature, 
protected from light. The transduction solution was then replaced with the 
enhancer solution (O36212 component B, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) and 
incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 for 2 hours. The cells were then incubated for over 
16 hours in DMEM glutaMAX containing 10% FCS at 37C, 5% CO2. The cells 
were then washed in PBS and subsequently fixed in 4% PFA. The coverslips 
were mounted onto slides in ProLong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen Ltd., 
Paisley, UK) containing 10g/ml Hoechst 33258. The ER was then visualised 
using the FITC filter and nuclei, using the Dapi filter of the Zeiss ApoTome 
AXIO Imager and the AxioVision Re. 4.7 software.

Brain, heart and rectus femoris tissues were excised from mice and placed 
immediately in ice-cold isolation buffer (225nM mannitol, 75mM sucrose, 0.5% 
BSA, 0.5mM EGTA and 30mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). The tissue was subsequently 
minced and homogenised on ice in 10ml isolation buffer. Differential 
centrifugation at 4C was used to obtain a mitochondrial pellet. An initial 
centrifugation at 740g was used to pellet nuclei and cell debris. The 
supernatant containing mitochondria was then transferred to a fresh tube and 
centrifuged at 9000g three times to pellet the mitochondria. After each 
centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and mitochondria were 
resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer. After the final centrifugation, the 
supernatant was removed and the mitochondrial pellet was air-dried before 
mitochondrial proteins or mtDNA was extracted. 
2.18.1 Mitochondrial protein extraction. 
The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 
150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium 
deoxycholate) containing 1x PIC, incubated for 5 minutes on ice, then 
centrifuged at 10000g for 10 minutes at 4C. The supernatant containing 
extracted proteins was transferred to a fresh pre-chilled tube and stored at -
80C. 
2.18.2 Mitochondrial DNA extraction 
Mitochondrial DNA was then isolated as described in section 2.13 starting by 
resuspension in cold solution 1 (25mM Tris-HCl & 10mM EDTA).

2.20 Yeast-2-hybrid 
2.20.1 Yeast-2-Hybrid Analysis of Dnm1l self interactions 
Regions of Dnm1l were cloned into the vectors pDEST32 (bait) and pDEST22 
(prey) (Appendix IX) (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) by Professor Neil Dear. The 
domain interactions were performed in the yeast strain MaV203, which 
contains HIS3 and GAL1 promoters driving the expression of HIS3 and LacZ 
reporter genes respectively. The yeast cells were co-transformed with the bait 
and prey vectors by combining 100ng of each vector plus 100g of Herring 
testes carrier DNA and adding to 100l of yeast cells that have been cultured 
in 50ml liquid yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) at 30C overnight and 
resuspended in 1.5ml TE / lithium acetate (LiAc). This mixture was then added 
to 600l PEG/LiAc and vortexed briefly at high speed. The cells were then 
heat-shocked in a water bath at 42C for 15 minutes followed by a 2 minute 
incubation on ice. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 secs at 13000rpm, 
resuspended in 500l TE and plated on agar. Interactions were identified on 
the ability of transformants (in serial 10-fold dilutions) to grow on yeast drop-
out medium agar lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine supplemented with 
100mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Interactions were semi-quantified by performing 
a -galactosidase overlay assay: cells within the yeast colonies were first lysed 
with chloroform (CHCl3) to expose the -galactosidase that is expressed only 
in interactants. The plate was allowed to dry and then covered with a 0.1% low 
gelling temperature agarose gel made up in Z buffer (60mM Na2HPO4.7H2O, 
20mM NaH2PO4.H2O, 10mM KCl, 1mM MgSO4) containing 0.5mg/ml X-gal and 
8mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Once the gel had set, the plate was incubated at 
30C and monitored over 3  5 days for a blue colour to develop, indicating a 
positive interaction; the X-gal is colourless, turning blue when cleaved by -
galactosidase. 
A more sensitive quantification method was used for mutated strains: 
the -galactosidase liquid culture assay, based on the ability of -galactosidase 
to cleave ortho-Nitrophenyl--D-galtactopyranoside (ONPG). Following an 
overnight growth of the yeast liquid culture at 30C, the cells were pelleted and 
resuspended in Z buffer (60mM Na2HPO4.7H2O, 20mM NaH2PO4.H2O, 10mM 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 45*
KCl, 1mM MgSO4), containing 38mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed immediately, and this freeze / thaw was 
repeated twice more to lyse the cells. The cell lysate was then incubated 
overnight at 37C with 1mg/ml ONPG in Z buffer. Cleavage of ONPG is 
accompanied by the emission of light at 420nm, which was measured by a 
JENWAY 6305 spectrophotometer to quantify the level of -galactosidase 
activity and hence, the strength of protein interaction. 
2.20.2 Yeast-2-Hybrid Library screen for Dnm1l interactions 
Dnm1l cDNA was cloned into the vector pAS2-1 (bait), using the following 
primer sequences:  
Forward sequence 5-d(ATAGAATTCGAGGCGCTGATCCCGGTCATC)3 
Reverse sequence 5-d(TAGGGATCCTCACCAAAGATGAGTCTCTG)3 
Dnm1l cDNA was amplified by PCR under the following conditions: 50l 
reaction containing 10ng DNA, 1U of AccuPrime
 Taq DNA polymerase High 
Fidlity (12346-086, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 1x AccuPrime
 PCR buffer 1 and 
2M of each primer.  Thermal cycling conditions were 94C for 15 seconds 
followed by 35 cycles of 94C for 30 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds and 68C 
for 2 minute. A final step of 68C for 10 minutes was performed before 
completion of cycling. The PCR product was then double-digested with EcoRI 
and BamHI (NEB, Ipswich, UK) for 2 hours at 37C. pAS2-1 was also double 
digested using the same conditions. The restricted Dnm1l and pAS2-1 were 
then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (M0202, NEB, Ipswich, UK). 100ng of pAS2-
1 plasmid and 75ng Dnm1l were ligated in a 10l reaction containing 1x T4 
DNA ligase reaction buffer and 1l T4 DNA ligase and incubated overnight at 
16C. The ligation product was subsequently transformed into DH10 E. Coli 
bacterial cells as previously described in section 2.5, plated out onto LB-agar 
plates containing 100g/ml Ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37C. 
Colonies that grew were screened by colony PCR amplification using the 
primer sequences above and confirmed by sequencing using AS2-1 primers, 
which amplify the insert and flanking regions within the pAS2-1 plasmid:

A human placental cDNA library was previously cloned into pACT2 (prey) by 
Professor Neil Dear (Appendix X). The vectors were sequentially transformed 
into MaV203 yeast cells. Yeast cells were prepared by culture overnight at 
30C in 50ml of YPD. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500rpm for 
1 min and reuspended in 40ml TE. The centrifugation step was repeated and 
cells resuspended in 0.1M LiAc / 0.5x TE and incubated at room temperature 
for 10 minutes. 100ng of pAS2-1 containing Dnm1l was mixed with 100g 
denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA and added to 100l of yeast cells. 
700l 0.1M LiAc / 40% PEG-3350 / TE was added to the cells and incubated 
for 30 minutes at 30C. 88l DMSO was added before heat shocking at 42C 
for 7 minutes. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in TE, which was 
repeated twice to wash the cells. After the final wash, the cells were 
resuspended in 100l TE and plated on yeast drop-out medium agar lacking 
tryptophan. Following incubation at 30C for 3-4 days, colonies that grew 
(hence contain the pAS2-1 plasmid) were cultured in 50ml synthetic complete 
(SC) medium lacking tryptophan. The same process of transformation was 
then repeated as above, replacing the 100ng pAS2-1 plasmid with 30g 
pACT2 containing the human placental cDNA library and plated on yeast drop-
out medium agar lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine supplemented with 
10mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. After a 3-4 day incubation at 30C, any colonies 
that grew were picked and resuspended in SC medium lacking tryptophan and 
leucine, before being replated in serial 10-fold dilutions, on plates lacking 
leucine, tryptophan and histidine, but supplemented with 100mM 3-amino-
1,2,4-triazole and semi-quantified by means of a -galactosidase overlay assay 
(described in section 2.20.1).

conditions were 94C for 15 seconds followed by 35 cycles of 94C for 30 
seconds, 55C for 30 seconds and 68C for 1 minute. A final step of 68C for 
10 minutes was performed before completion of cycling. The PCR products 
were double-digested at 37C for 2 hours using the enzymes listed above 
(NEB, Ipswich, UK). The pACT2 plasmid was also double digested using the 4 
different pairs of enzymes listed above and ligated with the corresponding DNA 
restriction product using T4 DNA ligase (M0202, NEB, Ipswich, UK). 100ng of 
pACT2 plasmid and 75ng insert DNA were ligated in a 10l reaction containing 
1x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer and 1l T4 DNA ligase and incubated 
overnight at 16C. The ligation product was subsequently transformed into 
DH10 E. Coli bacterial cells as previously described in section 2.5, plated out 
onto LB-agar plates containing 100g/ml Ampicillin and incubated overnight at 
37C. Colonies that grew were screened by colony PCR amplification using the 
primer sequences above and confirmed by sequencing using AD LD primers, 
which amplify the insert and flanking regions within the pACT2 plasmid:

The pAS2-1 vector containing mutant or wild type Dnm1l co-transformed with 
each version of pACT2 into MaV203 cells (as described in section 2.20.1) in 
which interactions were tested on yeast drop-out medium agar lacking leucine, 
tryptophan and histidine supplemented with 50mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and 
by the -galactosidase overlay assay. Yeast clones containing pACT2_UBC9 
identified from the human placental library screen in section 2.20.2 was also 
transformed with pAS2-1 containing mutant or wild type Dnm1l. After a 3-4 day 
incubation period at 30C, any colonies that grew were picked and 
resuspended in SC medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, before being 
replated in serial 10-fold dilutions, on the same drop-out agar plates and semi-
quantified by means of a -galactosidase overlay assay (described in section 
2.20.1).

2.21 Calcium concentration 
2.21.1 Cytoplasmic calcium concentration measurement 
ES cells were cultured as described in section 2.14.3 in 10cm dishes. Once a 
confluency of 60-70% was reached, the cells were trypsinized and washed in 
Hanks balanced saline solution (HBSS) (Thermo Scientific, Utah, USA) and 
resuspend in HBSS at 10
 cells/ml. 100l aliquots of cells (10
 cells) were 
added to 900l of labelling solution (5M Fura-2 (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) 
and 2.5mM Probenecid (Alfa Aezar, Heysha, UK), made up in HBSS 
containing 1mg/ml Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem., Darmstadt, 
Germany) and incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 for 45 minutes, protected from light. 
After washing twice in 1ml HBSS, the cells were resuspended in 90l HBSS 
and transferred to a white 96-well plate.  
 Fura-2 concentration was measured using the Berthold Mithras LB940 
with Mikrowin 2000 software. Excitation was measured at 380nm (which 
measures Fura-2 bound to Ca
) and 340nm (which measures unbound Fura-
2). Measurements were taken every 0.5s. After 30 seconds 10l 1mM ATP 
(100M ATP final concentration) was injected into the cells solution in each 
well to trigger the release of Ca
 from the internal Ca
 store, the ER. 
Measurements were taken for a further 13 minutes.  
 The ratio between unbound and bound Fura-2 (340nm/380nm) was 
calculated to normalise for cell number and then converted to Ca
concentration by means of a calibration curve in which known Ca
concentrations are plotted against Fura-2 concentrations. 
2.21.2 Mitochondrial calcium concentration measurement 
using aequorin 
Immortalized wild type and Python MEFs were cultured to 90% confluency in 
T75 flasks and subsequently transfected with a mitochondria-targeted aequorin 
vector (appendix XI) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK). 
The mitochondrial aequorin DNA was incubated with lipofectamine 2000 for 20 
minutes at room temperature then added to the growth medium on the MEFs. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 50*
The cells were then incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. 3 x 10
 cells were 
then trypsinized and washed twice in Krebs-Ringer modified buffer (KRB) 
(125mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1mM Na3PO4, 1mM MgSO4, 5.5mM glucose, 20mM 
Hepes, pH7.4), containing 1mM CaCl2, then incubated in KRB containing 1mM 
CaCl2 and 5M coelenterazine (Promega, Madison, USA) for 30 minutes on 
ice to reconstitute the aequorin protein. A final centrifugation was required to 
remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 90l KRB containing 1mM 
CaCl2 and 5M coelenterazine. The cells were then transferred to a white 96-
well plate. The luminescence was measured every 0.5s using the Berthold 
Mithras LB940 with Mikrowin 2000 software. After 30s, tertButylHydroquinone 
(tBuBHq) was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10mM. Subsequent 
conversion to Ca
 concentration was achieved using a standard curve of 
known Ca
 concentrations against luminescence. 
2.22 Oxidative phosphorylation measurement 
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was measured in vitro (MEFs and ES 
cells) and in vivo (heart and brain tissue) using the OROBOROS, high-
resolution respirometry Oxygraph-2K, in collaboration with Professor Chris 
Peers and Dr. John Boyle.  
2.22.1 Oxidative phosphorylation in cells 
Cells were cultured as described in section 2.14, and then placed in the 
chamber of the OROBOROS Oxygraph-2K. Respiration was monitored from 
when the chamber is sealed. The initial measurement taken was that of 
routine, representing the total respiration of the cells. Oligomycin was then 
added to a final concentration of 4mg/ml to inhibit the activity of ATP synthase 
providing a measure of proton leak. The electron transport chain (ETC) was 
then completely uncoupled by a series of additions of Carbonyl cyanide-4-
(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) from 0.5M to 1.25M until there 
was no further increase in O2 consumption, therefore representing the 
maximum capacity of the electron transport system (E.T.S). Residual O2 
consumption (ROX) is a measure of non-mitochondrial respiration and was the 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 51*
final measurement after shutting down OXPHOS with 4mg/ml oligomycin (F1/F0 
ATPsynthase inhibitor), 0.5M rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and 2.5M 
antimycin A (complex III inhibitor). 
2.22.2 Oxidative phosphorylation in tissues 
Tissues were excised from the animal and placed directly in Mir05 solution 
(0.5mM EGTA, 3mM MgCl2.6H2O, 60mM K-lactibionate, 20mM taurine, 10mM 
KH2PO4, 20mM HEPES, 110mM sucrose and 1mg/ml BSA) on ice to preserve 
mitochondrial function. The tissues were then teased apart under the 
microscope into very fine segments and placed in 50g/ml saponin on ice for 
30 minutes to lyse cells and expose the mitochondria. The saponin was then 
removed by 3 subsequent washes in Mir05 and placed into the chamber of the 
OROBOROS Oxygraph-2K. While O2 flux was constantly measured, 
appropriate substrates or inhibitors were added to deduce the efficiency of 
mitochondrial function. To the tissues, 10mM pyruvate, 2mM malate and 
10mM glutamate were added to show total respiration. This was not necessary 
in intact cells as respiration was already taking place. 2.5mM ADP and 
subsequently 10mM succinate were added to measure the increase in O2 
consumption. FCCP was added gradually from 0.5  1.25M to completely 
uncouple O2 consumption and ATP production, emphasizing the maximum 
capacity of OXPHOS. The complex I inhibitor, rotenone was added at 0.5M 
reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial function. Finally, the addition of 2.5M 
antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor completely ceases the process of OXPHOS 
and any remaining O2 consumption at this stage is as a result of non-
mitochondrial respiration.

2.23 ATP determination  
2.23.1 Cell lines 
ATP was measured in MEFs, ES cells, embryoid bodies and cardiomocytes, 
which were cultured in 10cm plates as described in section 2.14. When cells 
reached an appropriate density, they were harvested by trypsinization and 
washed twice in 1ml incubation medium (140mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, 
1.2mM CaCl2, 6mM glucose, 20mM Na-HEPES (pH7.4), 0.04% phenol red). 
After the final wash, the cell were resuspended in 70l permeabilising solution 
(30M digitonin, 140mM potassium glutamate, 1mM EGTA, 1mM MgCl2, 6mM 
glucose, and 20mM K-PIPES (pH7.0) 0.04% phenol red) and subsequently 
incubated for 10 minutes at 30C. Volumes of 20l were aliquoted into 3 wells 
of a white 96-well plate, therefore analysing each cell line in triplicate. 180l of 
the standard reaction solution (1M DTT, 0.5mM D-luciferin and 12.5M firefly 
luciferase (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK)) was added to the cells in suspension. 
Luciferase activity was measured using the Berthold Mithras LB940 with 
Mikrowin 2000 software. A standard curve of known ATP concentrations 
against luminescence was used to deduce ATP concentrations. 
2.23.2 Tissues 
Whole brain or striatal tissue was lysed by homogenisation in NP-40 lysis 
buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were 
subsequently deduced by means of a Bradford assay. Volumes of 20l 
containing equal amounts of protein across samples were aliquoted into wells 
of a white 96-well plate. 180l of the standard reaction solution (1M DTT, 
0.5mM D-luciferin and 12.5M firefly luciferase (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK)) 
was added to the tissue lysate. Luciferase activity was measured using the 
Berthold Mithras LB940 with Mikrowin 2000 software. A standard curve of 
known ATP concentrations against luminescence was used to deduce ATP 
concentrations.

2.24 Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) 
measurement 
Immortalized MEFs were cultured on coverslips in growth medium until 80% 
confluent. The cells were then incubated in a final concentration of 2M JC-1 
(Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) for 30 minutes at 37C, 5% CO2. Images were 
captured using the Zeiss LSM 5.10 confocal microscope. Fluorescence was 
quantified using the ImageJ 1.42q software. This experiment was performed by 
Dr. John Boyle. 
2.25 Behavioural analyses  
In a cohort of 71 Python x R6/2 mice (males: 10 wt, 11 Py, 10 R6/2, 4 R6/2 x 
Py; females: 11 wt, 8 Py, 7 R6/2, 10 R6/2 x Py), males and females were 
housed in single sex, mixed genotypes up to the onset of Huntingtons disease 
at approximately 15 weeks. They were weighed twice a week from the age of 
3-weeks-old until disease onset. Grip strength (grams) was recorded from 7-
weeks-old using a force metre containing a grid providing a means of forelimb 
grasping. Clasping was also monitored based upon how quickly a mouse 
clasps after being handled by the tail tip and how severe the clasping is in 
terms of hind limb, forelimb or all 4 limb clasping.  
2.26 Statistical Anaylses  
Statistical analyses were carried out to evaluate significance of experiments 
using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Comparisons between two sets of data 
were performed using a paired Students t-test. Multiple comparisons were 
analysed by a One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test correction. 
Significance between compared data is denoted by an asterisk and given 
where P<0.05, unless stated otherwise. Error bars represent standard error of 
the mean in all analyses.

Chapter 3 : The effect of the Python mutation on 
DNM1L function 
3.1 Results 
The replacement of cysteine with phenylalanine in DNM1L
 has in some way 
altered DNM1L function. Consequently, a series of experiments were 
performed to investigate whether DNM1L structure or activity might be altered 
by the Python mutation. Initial investigations on the effect of the Python 
mutation focused on determining whether the mutation altered basic aspects of 
DNM1L biology such as cellular protein levels, subcellular localisation, GTPase 
activity and ability of the DNM1L protein to self-interact and interact with other 
proteins. 
3.1.1 The Python mutation impairs DNM1L intramolecular 
interactions 
There is no evidence to suggest that the cysteine residue mutated in Python is 
involved in the formation of disulphide bonds, as determined by X-ray 
crystallography of dynamin, and so likely to be replicated in DNM1L (Faelber et 
al., 2011, Ford et al., 2011). Regardless it might influence folding of the 
monomer or interaction between monomers. Indeed, other mutations in the 
middle (M) domain have been shown to affect higher order structures (Chang 
et al., 2010, Ramachandran et al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2004). As discussed in 
Section 1.4.4, a structural homology model of DNM1L indicates that the Python 
mutation is located in a region that might affect intramolecular interactions 
(Ashrafian et al., 2010). 
To investigate if interactions were compromised by the C452F mutation, 
a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) experiment was performed using the Pro-Quest 
system. This system allows measurement of interactions by expressing a 
GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein expressed in the pDEST32 vector 
and a GAL4 activation domain fusion protein expressed in the pDEST22 
(Appendix IX). Initially, a test was done to confirm what regions of the DNM1L 
protein are able to interact. The DNM1L domains used were based on previous 
studies that had demonstrated an interaction between the N-terminal (amino 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( 55*
acids 1-459) and C-terminal (506-742) parts of the protein (Smirnova et al., 
1998), as well as reports of an association between the M and GTPase 
effector (GED) domains (Smirnova et al., 1998, Zhu et al., 2004). The plasmid 
vectors containing cloned cDNA fragments to express the above domains were 
supplied by Professor N Dear. They were then transfected into yeast cells in 
appropriate combinations. The DNM1L domains in the fusion proteins tested 
are indicated in Figure 3.1A. All domains were tested for interactions with one 
another in the yeast strain MaV203. If two fusion proteins expressed from the 
pDEST22 and pDEST32 expression vectors interact, this will be reflected in 
activation of reporter cassettes in the MaV203 yeast strain leading to histidine 
auxotrophy and -galactosidase activity. Plasmids were co-transfected into 
yeast, cultured on -leu -trp plates to select for colonies containing both 
plasmids, then plated on -trp -leu -his + 100 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) 
plates to detect interactions. Only a few positive interactions were detected: (i) 
the full-length (1-742) protein with itself, (ii) the reported N-terminal (1-495) and 
C-terminal (506-742) domains, and (iii) the N-terminal (1-495) and GED (641-
742) (Fig. 3.1B). However M domain self-interactions have also been reported, 
which were not reproduced in this system. Interestingly, some of the 
interactions worked much better in one plasmid combination e.g. the 1-
495:506-742 and 1-495:641-742 interactions worked far more efficiently when 
1-495 was in the pDEST32 plasmid. 
  A  -galactosidase plate assay was also carried out to confirm these 
interactions. It is evident, however, that this method is less sensitive than 
assessing for histidine auxotrophy, identifying the stronger interactions only. 
For example, the strong interaction control Krev1:RalGDS shows up strongly 
positive in the  -galactosidase assay, whereas the control for the weak 
interactor, Krev1:RalGDSm1 is barely detectable. This is despite both the 
strong and the weak interactor growing well on trp leu his + 100 mM 3-AT 
plates (Fig.3.1B).

The Python mutation was introduced into these plasmids by site-directed 
mutagenesis. The mutated plasmids were transfected into yeast and assessed 
in a similar fashion to above. Only the combinations above that gave a 
detectable interaction were assessed as combinations i.e. 1-742:1-742, 1-
495:506-742 and 1-495:641-742. The Python mutation abrogated the N-
terminus with C-terminus/GED interactions, but had little affect on interaction 
between full-length monomers (Fig.3.2A). A liquid -galactosidase assay, 
which is more sensitive than the plate -galactosidase assay, was used to 
quantify the difference in the strength of interactions. The results indicated that 
the introduction of the Python mutation completely abrogated the N-
terminus:C-terminus and N-terminus:GED interactions with only a minor effect 
on heterotypic full length monomer interactions (Fig. 3.2B).

3.1.2 DNM1L protein levels are reduced in Python  
Compromising the assembly and activity of DNM1L may also alter protein 
levels within the cell. For example, the mutant version might be targeted for 
degradation due to misfolding (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002). This was 
examined in Western blots of heart and brain protein extracts from Python 
heterozygotes and wild type littermate control mice. The amount of protein 
loaded was normalised by determining the levels of T23, an inner 
mitochondrial membrane protein and #-tubulin, a structural protein present in 
the cytosol, neither of which should change between the samples as overall 
mitochondrial volumes per cell are not significantly altered in Python mice 
(Ashrafian et al., 2010).  
 A reduction of total DNM1L protein levels of approximately 65% was 
observed in Python heart samples (Fig. 3.3A). A reduction was also seen in 
the brain though somewhat less in magnitude (ca. 50% relative to wild type) 
(Fig 3.3B). The antibody used did not preferentially bind to wild type DNM1L so 
the DNM1L protein detected would likely include both wild type and Python 
DNM1L.

loading levels. Densitometry analyses indicate a reduction in DNM1L levels of 
65% in the heart (Students t test, P<0.0001) and 50% in the brain (Students t 
test, P=0.0022) of Python mice.

3.1.3 The Python and wild type alleles are equally expressed 
The reduction in DNM1L protein levels in Python heterozygotes seen above 
could reflect lack of production of the Python protein from the mutated allele 
though given the reports that Dnm1l
 mice, which contain approximately half 
the normal levels of DNM1L, appear to thrive similarly to wild type mice 
(Ishihara et al., 2009, Wakabayashi et al., 2009), a reduction in DNM1L levels 
alone of the magnitude seen in Python heterozygotes should not lead to a 
cardiovascular abnormality. Alternatively, it was possible that the Python 
protein was leading to some protein degradation (e.g. Python dimers) but that 
the remaining DNM1L, Python:wild type dimers and wild type only dimers are 
expressed and Python may be acting in a dominant-negative manner, 
somehow reducing the activity of Python:wild type heterotypic dimers. 
 To investigate this further, mRNA from heart and brain was examined 
for levels of the Dnm1l
 mRNA to ascertain if the Python allele was 
expressed. Quantitative analysis by pyrosequencing is based on the 
production of light intensity in proportion to the amount of nucleotide detected 
(Fig. 3.4A). The substitution in Python is a G to a T base (as shown in red in 
Fig. 3.4A). The following nucleotide in the sequence after the mutated base is 
also a T. For this reason, in the wild type sample it would be expected that the 
signal intensity for the G and the following T would be very similar, denoting 
homozygous G followed by homozygous T. If the Python and wild type alleles 
were equally expressed in Python heterozygotes, it would be expected that the 
signal intensity for T would be 150% to that of the wild type signal (GT followed 
by TT in Python vs. GG followed by TT in wild type). This is because the signal 
for T represents the heterozygous T as a result of the Python mutation and the 
adjacent T in the cDNA, which is homozygous. The signal for G will therefore 
decrease by 50% to that of wild type as half the particular base in that position 
is present (GT in Python vs. GG in wild type). Total cellular mRNA was isolated 
from four hearts and six brains of 5-week-old Python and wild type C57BL/6J 
mice, transcribed into cDNA and subsequently used to determine allelic 
expression levels by means of pyrosequencing. The result shows that the 
Python mRNA allele is expressed in equal amounts to the wild type allele in 
both hearts and brains of Python heterozygotes (Fig 3.4B). Thus it is likely to 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /62*
be expressed at the protein level in Python heterozygotes and in equal 
proportions to the wild type protein. This would result in a cellular composition 
of 25% Python homotypic dimers, 25% wild type homotypic dimers and 50% 
Python:wild type heterotypic dimers. One possibility is that Python DNM1L 
dimers might lack any functional activity and are rapidly degraded in the cell 
while the heterotypic dimers are retained yet have reduced functionality and 
thus reduce the levels of active DNM1L higher order structures in the cell to a 
level that enables survival but compromises organ function in certain 
conditions (such as observed in the heart). The next experiments further 
investigated this possibility.

 allele is expressed in heterozygotes. A) The DNA 
sequence of Dnm1l surrounding the mutation site of Python, which is 
highlighted in red. G is the wild type allele with T being the Python allele. 
During pyrosequencing analysis, the addition of dNTPs is accompanied with 
the release of pyrophosphate (PPi), which is then converted to ATP by ATP 
sulfurase. The ATP is then used to produce light via luciferase activity. B) 
Pyrosequencing analysis of cDNA transcribed from mRNA of 4 hearts and 6 
brains of 5-week-old Python and wild type C57BL/6J male mice reveals the 
Python and wild type alleles in the Python heterozygotes are equally 
expressed at the mRNA level. Results shown are typical results that were 
independently confirmed in 3 different mRNA samples for each genotype.

3.1.4 The DNM1L
 protein has reduced GTPase activity 
GTPase activity is an inherent feature of dynamin family proteins and required 
for dynamin function (Ingerman et al., 2005, Ramachandran et al., 2007). 
Alterations to DNM1L that reduce GTPase activity (e.g. the K38A mutation (Pitts 
et al., 1999)) result in mutant proteins that can act in a dominant negative 
function to affect mitochondrial morphology (Frank et al., 2001, Smirnova et al., 
2001). To test whether GTPase activity was reduced in DNM1L
, it was 
produced in bacteria as a his-tag fusion protein (by cloning into the pET101 
plasmid (Appendix IV)) (Figure 3.5A), purified and then assayed for GTPase 
activity. To assess GTPase activity, the PiColourLock Gold
 system was 
used. This is a colorimetric assay based on the production of Pi hydrolysed 
from GTP via the GTPase action of the purified protein. Inorganic phosphate 
(Pi) is then converted into a Pi-dye complex that is detectable at 635nm. The 
higher the concentration of Pi detected, the greater the GTPase activity of the 
protein. The purified Python protein exhibited a 75% reduction in GTPase 
activity compared to that of the wild type protein (Fig. 3.5B). Therefore, 
GTPase activity and, as a result, DNM1L function, are reduced in the DNM1L
protein.

expression of pET101_Dnm1l fusion proteins for wild type and Python DNM1L. 
Negative controls included fusion constructs that had not been induced for 
expression with IPTG and non-transfected BL21 bacterial cells. B) The 
GTPase activity was measured by the concentration of Pi produced as a result 
of GTP hydrolysis. Wild type DNM1L displays far greater activity than an 
equivalent amount of Python DNM1L (Students t test, P>0.0001), n=3.  
3.1.5 Python can act in a dominant-negative fashion 
If the Python mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion, then it might be 
expected that the presence of the mutant protein would have an adverse effect 
on the activity of wild type protein. One way to ascertain if this is the case is to 
measure the level of GTPase activity in a sample of purified wild type DNM1L 
and compare to the same amount of wild type DNM1L renatured with an equal 
amount of DNM1L
 protein. If the Python mutation is dominant negative, the 
GTPase activity of purified wild type protein renatured with the same amount of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( //6*
purified Python protein will reduce the GTPase activity of the dimer when 
compared with the GTPase activity for the same amount of wild type protein 
alone. Equal amounts of purified wild type and Python DNM1L were renatured 
together and assayed for GTPase activity. GTPase activity in wild type:mutant 
mix is reduced to 75% to that of wild type protein alone (Fig 3.6). This provides 
molecular evidence that the Python protein can act as a dominant negative, 
heterodimers having reduced activity compared to wild type homodimers. 
Figure 3.6. Python reduces the GTPase activity of wild type DNM1L. The 
GTPase activity was measured by the concentration of Pi produced as a result 
of GTP hydrolysis. 60ng of wild type DNM1L displays far greater activity than 
60ng of Python DNM1L. When renaturing 60ng of wild type protein with 60ng 
of Python protein, the GTPase activity is reduced when compared to wild type 
alone (one-way ANOVA, P<0.0001), suggesting dominant-negative activity of 
the mutant protein. n=3. 
Manczak et al (2012) reported no significant changes in the GTPase activity in 
the cortex of Dnm1l
 mice when compared to Dnm1l
 mice. A query of 
Ensembl indicates there are 2468 transcripts related to GTPase activity in the 
mouse genome. Thus it is not surprising there was no change detected as 
DNM1L probably only contributes to a very small proportion of overall GTP 
hydrolysis in any cell. To formally exclude that expression of Python DNM1L 
does not lower overall GTPase activity in the brain, GTPase activity was 
measured in whole brain lysates of wild type and Python 5-week-old C57BL/6J 
mice. Two samples for each genotype were used for analysis. As shown in 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( ///*
Figure 3.7, no significant alteration occurs within the brain lysates of the 
Python mice compared to the wild type controls. This result, does not, 
however, exclude the likelihood that DNM1L GTPase activity is reduced in the 
brain, which still seems likely given the in vitro protein expression results 
above 
Figure 3.7. Overall GTPase activity within Python brains is not altered. 
GTPase activity was measured in the brain of samples from 5-week-old male 
Python and wild type littermate controls. Results shown are duplicate tests of 
two separate samples for each genotype. n=3.  
3.1.6 The Dnm1l
 and Dnm1l
A401D
 mutations impair DNM1L 
interactions with UBC9 and MFF. 
A number of intermolecular interactions have been reported to influence 
activity of DNM1L. It is plausible that the Python mutation may impair 
interactions with such other proteins and therefore subsequent function of 
DNM1L. Reported interactions important for DNM1L docking on the OMM 
include ubiquitination through interactions with MARCHV (Karbowski et al., 
2007), sumoylation, which involves forming a complex with sumo-conjugating 
enzyme (UBC9) and SUMO1 (Harder et al., 2004). FIS1 (Yoon et al., 2003) 
and MFF (Otera et al., 2010) have been shown to be important interactions for 
DNM1L docking on the OMM. An interaction with glycogen synthase kinase-3 
beta (GSK3) was detected using a Y2H system, however the exact function of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( //7*
this interaction remains unknown (Hong et al., 1998). An interaction with 
Pex19p, which resides on the peroxisomal membrane, may be required for the 
recruitment of Dnm1 to the peroxisomes in yeast (Vizeacoumar et al., 2006), 
though no mammalian equivalent interaction has been reported. 
 The full complement of DNM1L-interacting protein is unknown. 
Although a Y2H screen for DNM1L-interacting proteins has been reported 
(Harder et al., 2004), the published work only refers to 2 proteins  UBC9 and 
SUMO1  and not to any other proteins identified in the work. Therefore, to 
ascertain if there were other unreported interacting proteins, a Y2H screen was 
performed. Dnm1l cDNA was cloned into pAS2-1 (Appendix X) as bait. The 
resultant fusion protein consists of DNM1L linked to a GAL4 DNA binding 
domain. As prey, a commercial placental cDNA library cloned into pACT2 
(Appendix X) (complexity > 10
 independent cDNA clones) was used. This 
expresses cDNAs as fusion proteins with the GAL4 activation domain. The bait 
and prey vectors were co-expressed in the yeast strain MaV203 and plated on 
agar -trp -leu -his +10 mM 3AT to select for yeast colonies auxotrophic for 
histidine. 25 clones were identified and were replica plated onto -trp -leu, -trp -
leu his + 10 mM 3AT and -trp -leu -his + 100 mM 3AT agar plates to confirm if 
an interaction was present. A -galactosidase overlay assay of the trp leu 
plates was also used to show the strength of interactions (Fig. 3.8). 4 colonies 
appeared to be the result of a true interaction. Subsequent DNA isolation and 
sequencing revealed the only protein interacting with DNM1L identified in this 
screen was UBC9. Thus, no new interacting proteins were identified. This 
probably suggests that the screen was sub-optimal as Harder et al (2004) 
reported that UBC9 was only 68% of cDNA interactions identified. Perhaps the 
Y2H assay used was not sensitive enough and only revealed very strong 
interactions.

Figure 3.8. Y2H library screen showing positive clones. Clones were 
picked from a Y2H library screen and replica plated onto the different drop out 
media plates in 5 10-fold dilutions to identify potential interactions with DNM1L. 
All 4 positive interactions were identified as UBC9. 
The interaction between DNM1L and UBC9 may be important for sumoylation 
and subsequent translocation to the OMM. M domain mutations such as 
Python and the A401D (Waterham et al., 2007) may impair this interaction, 
thereby decreasing the amount of DNM1L on the OMM. Impaired interaction 
with other proteins might also result and reduce DNM1L activity in mutant cells.

 and Dnm1l
A401D
 cDNAs in pAS2-1 were generated 
by site-directed mutagenesis. For the known interacting proteins, cDNA was 
made from mouse heart mRNA for each and cloned into pACT2. The list of 
proteins analysed for interaction with DNM1L are shown in Table 3.1.

The DNAs were co-transformed into the yeast strain MaV203 and plated on -
trp -leu agar plates. Individual colonies were subsequently replica plated in 10-
fold dilutions on to plates of dropout medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and 
histidine supplemented with 50 mM 3AT.   
 The Dnm1l interactions with UBC9 (Fig. 3.9A) and Mff (Fig. 3.9B) were 
confirmed in this assay, both of which were abrogated by the introduction of 
the Python or the A401D mutation. It is possible that DNM1L
and DNM1L
A401D
exhibit reduced translocation to the OMM as a consequence of impaired 
interactions with UBC9. Further to this, should the mutated versions of DNM1l 
reach the OMM, it is likely they will display reduced stability on the membrane 
as a result of defective interactions with the docking protein, MFF. The other 
interactions reported were not identified in this assay (Fig. 3.9C-F), preventing 
any further examination of the effect of mutations.

in this system (C-F). Controls for interactions were provided by the known 
strong interaction between Krev1 and RalGDS, the weak interaction between 
Krev1 and RalGDSm1, and no interaction between Krev1 and RalGDSm2.

3.1.7 Decreased DNM1L
 stability on the OMM 
The translocation of DNM1L from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane is 
a required step in the process of mitochondrial fission (Smirnova et al., 1998). 
Overall cellular levels of DNM1L were reduced when DNM1L
 is present, and 
an impaired interaction with UBC9 necessary for sumoylation and subsequent 
translocation to the OMM, had been detected. An interaction with the docking 
protein, MFF, was also impaired and so the ability of mutant DNM1L to 
translocate and remain on the OMM may be compromised.  
Initially immunocytochemical visualisation of DNM1l in cultured mouse 
skin fibroblasts from Python and wild type littermates revealed no obvious 
differences (Fig. 3.10). However, this method would only detect large 
alterations in subcellular localisation as DNM1L is primarily localised diffuse in 
the cytoplasm with only a small amount (ca. 3%) associated with the 
mitochondrial membrane (Smirnova et al., 1998).  
Figure 3.10. DNM1L localisation within the cell. Immunocytochemical 
staining of DNM1L in mouse skin fibroblasts using an anti-Drp1 antibody was 
performed to investigate DNM1L localisation as a result of the Python 
mutation. The resulting diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of DNM1L in +/Py and 
+/+ cultured mouse skin fibroblasts was not a sensitive method to investigate 
such small changes in DNM1L localisation. Nuclei are stained blue with 
Hoechst 33258 while antibody bound to DNM1L fluoresces red. Scale bars 
represent 20m.  
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( //4*
In order to detect a more subtle change in localisation, mitochondria were 
prepared from 3-month-old Python and wild type hearts and brains, and the 
DNM1L levels examined by Western blotting of the mitochondrial protein 
extracts. If there was a change in the amount of DNM1L associated with the 
mitochondrial membranes, this might be reflected in a change in the amount of 
protein detected. TIM23 was used to normalise for the general levels of 
mitochondrial proteins as it had previously been shown mitochondrial volume 
per cell is not altered (Ashrafian et al., 2010). A reduction of over 50% of 
DNM1L protein is detected on the mitochondria of Python mouse hearts (Fig. 
3.11A) and brains (Fig. 3.11B) with respect to wild type controls. This may 
signify the amount of DNM1L
 reaching the OMM is significantly reduced.

heart (A) and brain (B) by Western blot analysis, which revealed severely 
reduced levels in Python tissues. Densitometry analyses indicate a reduction 
of over 50% of mitochondrial protein levels in the heart (Students t test, 
P=0.002), though a smaller reduction in the brain (Students t test, P=0.0436).

3.2 Discussion 
The Python mutation may impair DNM1L activity through one or more of the 
following mechanisms: altering the physical structure of the monomer; its ability 
to form dimers, tetramers and high-order structures; its cellular localisation and 
ability to translocate to the mitochondrial membrane; and GTPase activity. 
Other mechanisms are also possible. 
M domain mutations have been reported to impair intramolecular 
interactions between the M and the GED domains (Chang et al., 2010), an 
essential interaction in the process of higher-order oligomerisation (Zhu et al., 
2004). It was therefore plausible that DNM1L
 dysfunction lies in the inability 
of DNM1L
 to form higher order structures as a result of defective 
intramolecular interactions. Y2H studies revealed that the Python mutation 
disrupts interactions between the N-terminus and the C-terminus, as observed 
in other M domain mutations that have physiological effects (Chang et al., 
2010). Full-length DNM1L interactions were, in comparison, hardly affected. M 
domain self-interactions have also been reported, and these interactions are 
abrogated by certain M domain mutations (Chang et al., 2010). Contrary to 
this, no self-interaction of the M domain was detected in this study. A possible 
explanation for this is the difference in sensitivity between the Y2H systems 
used. Chang et al. (2010) used the LexA system, compared to the GAL4 
system used in this study.  
Dr. Narcis Fernandez-Fuentes generated a potential structure for the 
DNM1L dimer based on homology modelling (Fig. 3.12 and 9Ashrafian et al., 
2010)). This model is supportive of the Y2H findings in that an interaction 
between the N-terminus and C-terminus/GED domains is not unexpected 
given the close proximity of #-helices over a significant length of the protein 
(Fig. 3.12). Also, the location of the Python C452F mutation is within a region 
that is adjacent to an #-helix from the C-terminus/GED region, so this cysteine 
could conceivably be involved in stabilizing an interaction between the helices. 
Thus, the proposed structure and Y2H data support a postulate that the 
structure of the monomer is altered by the C452F mutation.

Another DNM1L mutation identified in a human patient (A395D in the human 
protein; the equivalent mouse mutation would be A401D) displays a more 
severe clinical phenotype including the following symptoms: microcephaly, 
optic atrophy, abnormal brain development, hyperplasia and elevated lactic 
acid concentrations in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (Waterham et al., 
2007). This phenotype is in accordance with a global defect in mitochondria, 
compared to the Python mutation where the heart appears to be the major 
organ affected. A possible explanation for the differences in severity of the 
C452F and A401D mutations may lie in the specific location of each mutation 
within the protein and/or the difference in chemical nature between amino acid 
substitutions. When amino acid properties are compared, the AD mutation 
appears a more divergent substitution than that of CF. Hydrophobicity, 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /77*
polarity, charge and bulk are slightly altered in CF whereas AD exhibits a 
more drastic change (Table 3.2).  
The A401D mutation has been reported, like Python, to interfere with 
intramolecular interactions between the M domain and the GED and also 
showed a clear reduction in the levels of the mitochondrial membrane-bound 
form (Chang et al., 2010). In the homology model, the alanine lies within a 
region close to an #-helix with which it might interact, and may be involved in 
stabilizing lipid-binding interactions e.g. when binding to the OMM  (Fig. 3.12). 
Thus, intermolecular and membrane interactions might both be altered to a 
greater severity by this human DNM1L mutation.

The A401D mutation was idenitified in a human patient whereas the Python 
mutation was identified in a mouse mutant. It cannot be excluded that the 
different phenotypes also reflect a potentially different role for the two proteins 
in human and mouse, though the very high conservation of the protein across 
species (98% conservation between human and mouse) (Ashrafian et al., 
2010) suggests this is unlikely. However, it will be necessary in the future to 
recapitulate the A401D mutation in mice through gene targeting in ES cells to 
observe whether or not the phenotype mimics the human condition.  
DNM1L protein levels in the hearts and brains of Python mice were 
reduced. It is possible that the reduced protein levels reflect that the Python 
DNM1L protein is not produced at all. However this is unlikely given that 
Dnm1l
 mice show no defects, despite only 50% of the Dnm1l protein being 
present (Ishihara et al., 2009, Wakabayashi et al., 2009). It raises the 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /78*
possibility that the Python protein is acting in a dominant negative fashion 
impairing the function of the wild type protein. As the antibody used for 
detection does not distinguish between wild type and Python DNM1L proteins, 
the surrogate marker of the mRNA levels was determined to ascertain if the 
DNM1L
 protein was likely to be expressed. Pyrosequencing analysis was 
carried out in collaboration with Dr. Phil Chambers, University of Leeds. In both 
Python hearts and brains, the Python allele and wild type allele were 
expressed equally at the mRNA level. It is therefore likely that wild type and 
Python proteins would be equally expressed in Python heterozygotes. 
Assuming the dimer is the basic structural unit for higher order oligomerisation 
(Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001) only 1 in 4 dimers in a cell heterozygous for the 
Python mutation would be normal as from the data, it is reasonable to 
conclude that DNM1L
 is able to dimerise with both mutant and wild type 
DNM1L. Python homodimers may be targeted for degradation as a result of 
protein misfolding (accounting for the reduced protein levels seen in Python 
tissues), while wild type:Python heterodimers would be structurally altered and 
this could alter any combination of GTPase activity, translocation to the OMM, 
or oligomerisation into higher-order structures. GTPase activity was 
subsequently shown to be severely reduced in the Python homodimer, 
exhibiting just 25% activity relative to the wild type homodimer. The wild 
type:Python heterodimer displayed a GTPase activity less than that of the 
same amount of the wild type protein alone suggesting that the Python 
monomer is acting in a dominant negative fashion, and impairing the ability of 
the dimer to hydrolyse GTP. 
 DNM1L post-translational modifications have been shown to induce 
translocation of DNM1L to the OMM. One such modification is that of 
sumoylation; a process in which an interaction with the E2 ubiquitin ligase 
(UBC9) is crucial (Okuma et al., 1999). Through Y2H assays, Python and the 
A401D mutant proteins were shown to completely abrogate this interaction. This 
could compromise translocation of the mutant proteins from the cytosol to the 
OMM. Interactions with MFF, a docking protein for DNM1L on the OMM (Otera 
et al., 2010) were also found to be severely affected implying that even if 
Python and A401D mutants could translocate to the OMM, the protein may not 
have the ability to remain stable on the mitochondrial membrane, a necessity 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /70*
of mitochondrial fission (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001). Other DNM1L:protein 
interactions reported in the literature that were assessed in this study did not 
reveal an interaction. This could be due to the differences in techniques or 
systems used. For example, an interaction with FIS1 was identified by co-
immunoprecipitation (Yoon et al., 2003), a method that allows proteins in 
interaction complexes to be identified. DNM1L interacts with MFF, which may 
form a complex with FIS1. Therefore DNM1L would be immunoprecipitated 
with FIS1, but no direct interaction would necessarily take place, nor be 
detectable by Y2H, between the two proteins.  
The A401D mutation has been reported to decrease the level of DNM1L 
associated with the OMM (Chang et al., 2010). Immunocytochemistry of 
DNM1L distribution did not reveal any obvious difference in DNM1L 
localisation between Python and wild type cells. However, given that at any 
one time only a fraction (3%) of DNM1L is localised to the mitochondria 
(Smirnova et al., 2001), a more sensitive method was required to detect a 
more subtle change. Examination of DNM1L levels in purified mitochondria 
suggested a possible reduction in mitochondrial membrane-bound DNM1L in 
Python cells. The decreased levels associated with the membrane might 
reflect a failure in ability to translocate from the cytosol, or an instability of the 
DNM1L complex once on the mitochondrial membrane. This in turn could alter 
the cellular functions that rely on this.

Chapter 4 : DNM1L
 and organelle morphology 
4.1 Results 
4.1.1 The Python mutation alters mitochondrial, peroxisomal 
and ER morphology  
The main function known for DNM1L is a role in mitochondrial (Chen and 
Chan, 2005, Frank et al., 2001) and peroxisomal fission (Koch et al., 2003), 
while a single report suggests a role in maintenance of ER morphology (Pitts et 
al., 1999). To identify if the Python mutation impairs DNM1L function in relation 
to these roles, mitochondria, peroxisomes and ER were examined in Python 
and wild type cell lines. An impairment of fission would be reflected in 
elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes. 
Initially, mitochondrial morphology was investigated by means of 
fluorescent imaging in mouse skin fibroblasts (Fig. 4.1A), embryonic stem (ES) 
cells (Fig. 4.1B) and cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells (Fig. 4.1C). Mitochondrial 
elongation was evident in all 3 Python cell lines examined, reflecting an 
impaired function for DNM1L
. The pathogenic effect of Python appeared to 
be evident in the heart more than in other tissues given the congestive heart 
failure (CHF) phenotype so it was necessary to investigate the impact of 
Python on mitochondrial morphology in intact cardiomyocytes. Due to the 
nature of mitochondrial rearrangement in adult cardiomyoyctes into a highly 
organised linear network packed tightly in the cell between the sarcomeres, 
detecting alterations in morphology would be difficult. Nonetheless, it was still 
an important question that required answering. Adult cardiomyocytes were 
cultured from 12-week-old Python and wild type control male mice on the 
C57BL/6J background. The linear, highly organised arrangement of 
mitochondria appeared similar in Python and wild type mitochondria (Fig. 4.2).  
Peroxisomes in cultured mouse skin fibroblasts were visualised using 
fluorescent immunocytochemistry and Python fibroblasts had an elongated 
morphology (Fig. 4.3A), further demonstrating a functional effect of the Python 
mutation on DNM1L function. ER morphology may also be abnormal in the 
Python cells. In wild type cells, the ER had a regular web-like pattern. In 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /72*
contrast, Python cells showed a slightly broken and collapsed ER network (Fig. 
4.3B).

To ascertain if the mitochondrial elongation was due to a dominant effect of the 
Python mutation, HeLa cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild 
type or mutant forms of DNM1L and, additionally, GFP (internally via an IRES) 
from a CMV promoter (Appendix VII). Three expression constructs were 
transfected into HeLa cells, encoding wild type DNM1L, DNM1L
 and as a 
positive control, the dominant negative mutant DNM1L
. The latter 
abrogates GTPase activity and consequently mitochondrial fission (Frank et 
al., 2001). An untransfected control was also included (Fig. 4.4A). The 
expression of GFP acted as a marker for cells that had taken up DNA. 
Expression of wild type DNM1L revealed no alteration in mitochondrial 
morphology (Fig. 4.4B), while DNM1L
 expression resulted in elongated 
mitochondria, similar to the morphology observed in Python fibroblasts (Fig. 
4.4C). Expression of DNM1L
 resulted in an even greater severity of 
elongated mitochondria (Fig. 4.4D). The result confirms the elongated 
mitochondrial phenotype observed is due to the Python mutation acting in a 
dominant fashion, and most likely alters the mitochondrial fission capacity of 
the cells.

4.1.2 Highly abnormal mitochondria in fibroblasts 
homozygous for the Python mutation 
Homozygosity for the Python mutation is embryonic lethal at approximately 
E9.5 (Ashrafian et al., 2010). Fibroblasts were cultured from E9.5 embryos, 
with yolk sacs being used to ascertain the genotype of the embryos. Few 
homozygous fibroblasts survived from the Python homozygous embryos 
suggesting there is a cell viability issue associated with homozygosity for the 
Python mutation. In the few homozygous cells obtained, the nuclei were highly 
pyknotic and mitochondria were aggregated around the nucleus, whereas wild 
type and heterozygous fibroblasts displayed an even distribution of 
mitochondria within the cell (Fig. 4.5). This mitochondrial phenotype may 
primarily reflect the fact that the cells are dying in culture rather than a change 
in mitochondrial phenotype per se.

4.2 Discussion 
As mitochondrial fission is the principle known function of DNM1L (Frank et al., 
2001), a defect in this protein is likely to alter the proteins capacity to perform 
this function. The mitochondria were therefore visualised in all cell models 
available: fibroblasts, ES cells, induced cardiomyocytes and isolated adult 
cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial elongation was evident in Python cell lines, 
implying reduced DNM1L activity. Due to the highly organised arrangement of 
mitochondria in adult cardiomyocytes, no difference in mitochondrial 
morphology was detectable, however it cannot be ruled out the likely possibility 
that mitochondrial morphology is also altered in cardiomyocytes of Python 
heterozygotes. Transfecting expression vectors containing wild type and 
Python DNM1L cDNA into HeLa cells confirmed that an elongated 
mitochondrial phenotype could be caused by the Python mutation. The 
dominant-negative mutant, Dnm1l
 was also expressed in HeLa cells as a 
positive control, as this had previously been reported to disrupt GTPase 
activity and, consequently, mitochondrial fission (Frank et al., 2001). In 
agreement with the literature, this mutant also led to an extended mitochondrial 
phenotype, more so than those in Python cells. This may be due to the position 
of the K38A mutation in the GTPase domain, possibly leading to a more severe 
reduction in GTPase activity and hence, fission. A second function of DNM1L 
is that of peroxisomal fission (Koch et al., 2003) and in accordance with this 
Python also impairs the ability of DNM1L to divide peroxisomes. DNM1L is 
also required for mouse embryonic development as demonstrated by the 
inability of Dnm1l
 embryos to survive to term (Ishihara et al., 2009, 
Wakabayashi et al., 2009). Homozygosity for the Python mutation also results 
in embryonic lethality and mitochondria of the few surviving isolated MEFs 
from Py/Py embryos display a high degree of aggregation around the nucleus. 
The nuclei themselves were highly pyknotic, possibly representative of dying 
cells (Ashrafian et al., 2010). 
The compromised ATP levels in the Python heart are perhaps related 
to an unknown function of DNM1L, and altered mitochondrial and peroxisomal 
morphology is an independent readout of the mutation, but not the one 
relevant to the observed phenotype. One way to investigate the importance of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /88*
mitochondrial dynamics in DCM could involve inhibiting fission in another way 
such as mutating FIS1 and observing the effects in vivo. One other aspect to 
consider is the degree of mitochondrial fission brought about by the Python 
mutation. Although currently there is no technique to quantify mitochondrial 
fission, it would be helpful to be able to measure the degree of inhibition of 
mitochondrial fission in order to deduce whether the degree of altered 
mitochondrial morphology reflects phenotype severity.

Chapter 5 : The effects of the Python mutation on 
other aspects of cellular physiology 
5.1 Results 
Mitochondria are involved in a number of cellular processes key to cell 
survival. Disruption to mitochondrial morphology may have serious 
complications if it contributes to such functions. A number of investigations 
were carried out in order to deduce the molecular pathway from which a 
disruption in DNM1L protein activity may lead to the compromised energetics 
that has been observed on the heart (Ashrafian et al., 2010). Experiments 
were performed to investigate the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
mutations, mitophagy, mitochondrial-ER tethering, Ca
 signalling between the 
ER and mitochondria and efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 
5.1.1 Mitophagy is not altered by DNM1L
A possible purpose for mitochondria to continually undergo fusion and fission 
is that of restoring mitochondrial function. Defective mitochondria may fuse 
with functional mitochondria and share contents in order to rectify function. 
Fission may provide a means of segregating abnormal parts of the 
mitochondria, which are beyond repair, exposing them for mitophagy and the 
recycling of components (Twig et al., 2008, Mouli et al., 2009). A reduced 
ability of mitochondria in Python cells to divide may result in decreased 
mitophagy, possibly leading to an accumulation of mtDNA mutations. The 
mitochondrial genome codes for 12 of the 80 subunits that make up the 
electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and healthy mtDNA, which is critical 
for efficient OXPHOS. An accumulation of mtDNA mutations would be 
expected to reduce the efficiency of OXPHOS due to accumulating mutations 
in proteins that contribute to the function of the ETC, ultimately reducing ATP 
production.
It has been reported that mutations in the mitochondrial fusion proteins 
MFN1 and MFN2 result in an accumulation of mtDNA mutations (Chen et al., 
2010) possibly as a result of the inability of the cell to fuse functional with 
abnormal mitochondria and repair the DNA. As an initial investigation into 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /81*
whether DNM1L
 may have a similar effect, primers flanking regions of the 
mitochondrial genome were used to amplify mtDNA from Python and wild type 
tissues. The primers chosen were known to flank regions of the genome in 
which deletions have been detected (Zhang et al., 2002). Two primers amplify 
a 4.6kb region of mtDNA, while two allow amplification of the entire C3H/HeN 
mtDNA genome (16.5kb) (Appendix VIII). These primers were tested in PCRs 
using mtDNA isolated from heart, brain and rectus femoris of 5-week-old and 
10-week-old Python and littermate control mice on the C3H/HeN background. 
Deletions of between 0.5kb and 2kb in size were observed in these tissues for 
both primer sets (Fig. 5.1), though no specific deletions are evident or 
increased in Python samples. This particular methodology was relatively crude. 
It can only detect deletions from approximately 100bp up to 2kb in size and 
only those that are relatively abundant. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that 
single nucleotide mutations, larger deletions, or rare mutations of any size in 
mtDNA do accumulate in Python tissues. 
As an accumulation of mtDNA mutations could result from decreased 
mitophagy unable to remove sufficient dysfunctional mitochondria, another way 
to assess if this is the case is to visualise the degree of colocalisation between 
the autophagosome marker LC3 and mitochondria. During autophagic 
activation, the cytosolic protein, LC3-I is converted through cleavage into LC3-
II, which becomes localised to the autophagosome. LC3 was visualised using 
an anti-LC3 antibody and FITC-labelled secondary antibody. LC3 was broadly 
diffused across the cytoplasm in both wild type and Python cells (Fig. 5.2). 
However the punctate foci observed in the wild type cells, that may represent 
the formation of the autophagosome (Wojtkowiak et al., 2012) were not visible 
in Python cells, possibly suggesting decreased autophagy as a result of the 
Python mutation. However as the level of colocalisation varied between cells 
within a genotype it was difficult to ascertain any difference between Python 
and wild type cells. As a way to overcome such variability, cells were scored 
for their percentage of colocalisation. This allowed a direct comparison 
between genotypes. The result in Figure 5.3 represents data taken from 12 
Python and 12 wild type cells and shows no difference between the genotypes. 
Thus, there is no evidence that mitophagy is altered in Python cells.

C3H/HeN mtDNA genome of 5-week-old and 10-week-old heart, brain and 
rectus femoris tissues from +/Py and +/+ C3H/HeN mice. A number of mtDNA 
deletions resulting in PCR fragments from 0.5kb to 2kb occur. However none 
appear more prevalent or specific to either genotype.

level of colocalisation, 1 = medium level of colocalisation and 2 = high level of

genotypes each and showed no significant difference between them. 
Although no difference was found in mtDNA deletions between Python and 
littermate controls, nor do levels of mitophagy appear to be reduced, it could 
still be a possibility that autophagy may be increased as a result of ATP 
depletion in Python hearts. Recent reports claim AMP activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) is activated by decreased ATP or increased AMP levels. This in turn 
triggers the formation of the autophagosome through activation of autophagy 
proteins and finally the cleavage of cytosolic LC3-I into the lipidated form, LC3-
II on the autophagosome (Xie and Klionsky, 2007). Activation of AMPK by 
phosphorylation (P-AMPK) and the subsequent formation of the LC3-II isoform 
were tested by means of Western blotting proteins isolated from 5- and 13-
week-old mouse hearts and brains of the C57BL/6J background. Figure 5.4 
shows no evidence of altered levels of LC3-II.

isoforms. Protein loading was normalised with #-Tubulin detection.

5.1.2 Reduced ER-Mitochondrial Tethering 
Mitochondrial volume is not altered in Python cardiomyocytes and 
mitochondrial respiratory complex enzymes retain full activity in vitro. Yet, ATP 
depletion is drastic and evident as early as 5 weeks of age (Ashrafian et al., 
2010). One possibility is that enzyme regulation is altered. Calcium (Ca
) is a 
crucial second messenger in cardiomyocytes, key to regulating cardiomyocyte 
excitation-contraction coupling and OXPHOS (Matsuoka et al., 2004). A 
number of components of the OXPHOS system are Ca
 sensitive, for example 
dehydrogenases of the citric acid cycle (CAC) and the F1/F0 ATP synthase 
(Balaban, 2009, McCormack and Denton, 1980). The mitochondrial Ca
concentration is reduced in cardiomyocytes in heart failure (Jones et al., 1998, 
Knollmann et al., 2000) and abnormal DNM1L activity has been shown to 
affect mitochondrial Ca
. DNM1L overexpression, resulting in fragmentation of 
mitochondria, leads to reduced mitochondrial Ca
 uptake after histamine-
induced ER Ca
 release and a reduction in the propagation of Ca
 waves 
along the mitochondria while mitochondrial Ca
 overload itself induces 
mitochondrial fission (Szabadkai et al., 2004). Given that the mitochondrial 
fusion protein MFN2 influences mitochondrial Ca
 uptake via physical 
tethering of ER, and that DNM1L is localised at sites of mitochondrial-ER 
tethering (Friedman et al., 2011) DNM1L might also perform a tethering 
function.  
 Therefore, mitochondrial-ER tethering was investigated. Mitochondrial 
protein extracts from Python and control hearts and brains were Western 
blotted and probed with an antibody against the ER integral membrane protein 
calnexin. If tethering was reduced in Python cells, it might be expected that 
less ER proteins would be co-purified with the mitochondria. A major reduction 
(~50%) in the amount of calnexin in Python heart (Fig. 5.5A) and brain (Fig. 
5.5B) samples was evident, suggesting a possible decrease in the interaction 
between the two organelles. TIM23 was detected to normalise for 
mitochondrial number.

Python tissues. Mitochondrial proteins were extracted from the hearts and 
brains of seven 3-month-old +/Py and seven +/+ female mice on the C57BL/6J 
background. Calnexin protein levels were detected in the heart (A) and brain 
(B) by Western blot analysis. As determined by densitometry analyses, over a 
50% reduction in the amount of calnexin was present in the mitochondrial 
preparations from Python mouse hearts (Students t-test, P=0.0176) and brain 
(Students t-test, P=0.0211) indicating a possible reduction in the interaction 
between the ER and mitochondria. TIM23 level was used to normalise for 
mitochondrial protein loading.

Fluorescent imaging was then used to further investigate the effect of Python 
on tethering. By fluorescently labelling ER and mitochondria in green and red 
respectively, colocalisation can be visualised by the degree of overlap between 
the two colours, reflected by yellow labelling. In mouse skin fibroblasts, the ER 
was labelled using the Organelle Lights
 ER-GFP assay kit and mitochondria 
using MitoTracker
 Orange. As shown in Figure 5.6, the degree of yellow 
present in the Python cell is far less than that of wild type supporting the 
previous data of a decrease in tethering between the two organelles. When 
examining the image in more detail using the magnified regions, the ER 
structure appears to be collapsing in Python cells. Whether this is a possible 
reason for, or a result of, decreased tethering is unknown.

5.1.3 Calcium signalling is perturbed in Python cells 
Mitochondrial-ER tethering allows the mitochondria to remain in close 
apposition to sites of Ca
 release, facilitating efficient Ca
 uptake by 
mitochondria. As a reduction in ER-mitochondrial tethering is possible in 
Python mice, subsequent mitochondrial Ca
 uptake may be less efficient in 
the Python cells given the lack of juxtaposed sites between the two organelles. 
 is a crucial messenger in OXPHOS and if the ability of mitochondria to 
take up Ca
 is compromised, a drop in ATP production could result, which 
might be detrimental to the cell. In an initial experiment, the cytosolic Ca
levels were measured in ES cells using ratiometric measurement of Fura-2 
fluorescence. Fura-2 fluoresces at 340nm. Upon Ca
 binding, the 
fluorescence emission changes to a peak at 380nm. Thus the ratio of 
fluorescence at 380nm compared to 340nm reflects the amount of Ca
, which 
is bound to Fura-2, which is in turn a reflection of the amount of Ca
 in the 
cytosol. The 340/380 ratio was used to determine the relative level of Ca
the cell. ATP was used as an agonist to stimulate Ca
-release from the ER. 
As expected, the cytosolic Ca
 concentration rapidly increased in both wild 
type and Python cells upon stimulation of Ca
-release from the ER. In wild 
type cells, the Ca
 concentration quickly returned to the basal level, whereas 
the cytosolic Ca
 in Python cells remained substantially higher (Fig. 5.7A). A 
similar result was seen when repeating the experiment in ES cells induced to 
differentiate to cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5.7B). Note a major difference between 
the result from ES cells and the induced cardiomyocytes regarding the peak 
cytosolic Ca
 concentration after ER Ca
 release. The Python induced 
cardiomyocytes exhibit a far higher peak than wild type cells while in ES cells, 
the peak cytosolic Ca
 concentrations are similar between wild type and 
Python. The process of cardiomyocyte differentiation however, appears to be 
somewhat problematic for the Python ES cells and so data acquired from 
cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells cannot be interpreted as reliable (see Fig. 
5.14). It also became clear that Python cells exhibited a higher baseline 
cytosolic Ca
 concentration than wild type (Fig. 5.8A) in keeping with the 
inability of mitochondria to take up Ca
 as efficiently. When intracellular stores 
are depleted of Ca
, capacitative Ca
 entry (CCE) is activated triggering Ca
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /00*
influx from the extracellular space. The activity of the CCE was therefore 
scrutinized by Dr. John Boyle to examine if increased Ca
 in the cytosol is a 
consequence of increased CCE, but no alteration in CCE activity was evident 
in Python cells (Fig. 5.8B).  
 Carbonyl cyanide p-(rifluoromethoxyl)-phenyl-hydrozon (FCCP) 
is a chemical uncoupler of the ETC and completely dissipates the proton 
gradient. Oligomycin inhibits OXPHOS by binding to ATP synthase, blocking 
the proton channel. It would be expected that upon exposure to mitochondrial-
deactivating conditions of FCCP + oligomycin, the cytosolic Ca
 concentration 
would increase as a result of decreased mitochondrial Ca
 uptake. However, if 
 uptake was already compromised, the cytosolic Ca
 level may not be 
expected to increase as much after the mitochondria are inactivated. When the 
cells were exposed to FCCP and oligomycin to shut down the activity of 
mitochondria, the Python cells demonstrated a much smaller increase in 
cytosolic Ca
 concentration compared to wild type cells (Fig. 5.8C). This 
further supports there being defective mitochondrial Ca
 uptake in Python 
cells. Compromised mitochondrial Ca
 uptake as a result of the Python 
mutation would be supported by a lower basal mitochondrial Ca
concentration, as the mitochondria would be unable to uptake sufficient Ca
maintain normal levels. Upon Ca
 release from the ER, the mitochondria in 
Python cells would be expected to uptake less Ca
 than that of mitochondria 
in wild type cells, reflected by a smaller increase in the concentration of 
mitochondrial Ca
.  Measurement of mitochondrial Ca
 concentration was 
investigated in immortalized embryonic fibroblasts using a mitochondria-
targeted aequorin (Appendix XI). Upon Ca
-binding the prosthetic group of 
aequorin, coelenterazine  added to the external medium - is converted into 
light emitting coelenteramide. The amount of light emitted is in proportion to 
the Ca
 concentration. After agonist-induced ER Ca
-release, wild type 
mitochondria are able to take up approximately double the amount of Ca
compared to mitochondria of Python cells (Fig. 5.7C). This provides further 
evidence to support the hypothesis of a reduced efficiency of mitochondrial 
 uptake as a result of the Python mutation.

an increase in cytosolic Ca
, whereas Python cells show a much lower 
response (Students t test, P=0.0177), n=10. Experiments were performed by 
Dr. John Boyle. 
Mitochondrial Ca
 is taken up in order to drive OXPHOS during respiration. 
During this process, protons are pumped across the ETC into the 
intermembrane space, producing the mitochondrial membrane potential 
(MMP). Given that Python mitochondria take up Ca
 less efficiently than wild 
type mitochondria, the MMP in Python cells may be compromised. To test this 
theory, the JC-1 dye was loaded into immortalized MEFs and imaged by Dr. 
John Boyle. JC-1 accumulates in mitochondria in an MMP-dependent manner, 
accompanied by a shift in fluorescence emission from ~529nm (green), 
indicating low MMP, to ~590nm (red), signifying a higher MMP. The wild type 
JC-1 fluorescence ratio is shifted predominantly to the red signal, while the 
Python cells display predominant green fluorescence (Fig. 5.9A), indicating 
that mitochondria in Python cells are mostly depolarized. The fluorescence 
ratio for each genotype was quantified using the ImageJ software. Whole field 
intensity was measured for red and green fluorescence and subsequent ratios 
were calculated using the two values (Fig. 5.9B).

5.1.4 Age-related decrease in oxidative phosphorylation in 
Python heart tissue. 
OXPHOS is a major process to provide the cell with ATP. Cardiomyocytes  rely 
on this process to generate sufficient energy for contraction. If there was a 
defect in Ca
 uptake by mitochondria, a number of enzymes involved in 
OXPHOS may exhibit reduced activity. Gradually, as the MMP is also 
compromised in Python cells, Ca
 taken up by the mitochondria will also 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /04*
decline, further reducing the activity of the ETC complexes and subsequently, 
the MMP, leading to a cascade effect. In order to investigate the activity of 
OXPHOS, mitochondria were scrutinized in ES cells and immortalized 
fibroblasts. The cells were placed into a respirometer and exposed to a variety 
of reagents that inhibit particular enzyme complexes of the ETC and allow 
analysis of four parameters of OXPHOS: (i) Routine represents the total 
respiration in cells once the chamber of the respirometer has been sealed and 
the values are normalised to remove the contribution of non-mitochondrial 
respiration (such as glycolysis); (ii) Leak is a measure of how tightly coupled 
OXPHOS is to electron transport and is measured after inhibiting the F1/F0 ATP 
synthase with oligomycin. A higher leak would signify greater uncoupling, 
hence a greater number of protons passing from the intermembrane space into 
the matrix via uncoupling proteins rather than ATP synthase. This would 
therefore produce less ATP from a given proton gradient; (iii) the Electron 
Transport System (ETS) is the maximum capacity of the OXPHOS system 
estimated after uncoupling ATP production from proton pumping with proton 
ionophore FCCP. FCCP permeabilizes the IMM to protons, thus diminishing 
the proton gradient and thereby uncoupling the ETS from the OXPHOS 
system; and (iv) Residual O2 consumption (ROX) shows the O2 consumption 
as a result of non-mitochondrial respiration; measured after inhibition of F1/F0 
ATP synthase with oligomycin, Complex I with rotenone and Complex III with 
antimycin A. Any continued consumption of O2 should be the result of non-
mitochondrial respiration.  
 When measuring OXPHOS activity across the ETC in ES cells, no 
significant difference was observed between wild type and Python cells (Fig. 
5.10), (Table 5.1). These are in keeping with a cardiacspecific defect. 
Comparing the results for ES cells and fibroblasts, there is an increased ROX 
value in ES cells (Fig. 5.10). This is likely to be because ES cells rely on 
glycolysis as a primary source of ATP production rather than OXPHOS, 
therefore the higher ROX value denotes a higher level of non-mitochondrial 
respiration. Like many cell types, fibroblasts use OXPHOS as the main source 
of ATP production, and hence demonstrate a lower output for non-
mitochondrial respiration.

Figure 5.10. OXPHOS efficiency is not compromised in Python ES cells 
and fibroblasts. Python and wild type ES cells (n=4) and immortalized mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (n=6) were exposed to conditions that increase 
or decrease particular complexes of the ETC. Routine is O2 consumption due 
to the general respiration of the cells. Leak is measured after inhibiting ATP 
F1/F0 ATP synthase with oligomycin. ETS represents the maximum capacity of 
the ETC after the addition of FCCP. ROX is a measure of non-mitochondrial 
respiration.

Students t tests were used to compare wild type and Python values of O2 flux 
for each parameter. 
To measure OXPHOS in tissues, the mitochondria must be exposed to 
different conditions inside the respirometer. The first requirement is to initiate 
OXPHOS by providing key substrates to the mitochondria for activation of the 
CAC. These substrates are pyruvate, malate and glutamate. ADP is then 
added, which is a substrate for ATP synthase. It would be expected that O2 
consumption would increase if ATP synthase were functioning properly. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /16*
Succinate is then added to observe the activity of complex II. As this is a 
complex II substrate, O2 consumption should, again, increase. FCCP is a 
chemical uncoupler of OXPHOS from electron transport and is added to the 
tissue until the OXPHOS system is completely uncoupled to give a measure of 
the maximum capacity of the OXPHOS system. A complex I inhibitor, rotenone 
is then added. Complex I activity will then be confirmed if the addition of 
rotenone decreases respiration. Should no change occur at this point, the 
general O2 consumption is therefore a result of OXPHOS without complex I 
activity. Antimycin A is then added to inhibit complex III activity. Again, a 
reduction in respiration should accompany this addition if complex III is 
functioning properly. 
When OXPHOS was measured in the hearts of mice on the C57BL/6J 
background at ages 1, 3, 4 and 5 months, and terminally ill mice that displayed 
CHF symptoms (~6 months), it became clear that an age-dependent decrease 
in the efficiency of enzyme activity across the ETC was occurring in hearts of 
Python mice. Initial signs that the ETC system may be experiencing reduced 
efficiency becomes evident at 4 months of age (Fig. 5.11), (Table 5.2). By 5 
months, a major reduction in the efficiency across all parameters measured 
(complexes I, II, III and ATP synthase as well as the maximum capacity of the 
ETC system) is apparent and remains so until the onset of CHF. The addition 
of rotenone and subsequently antimycin A has a much lower impact on the 
Python samples from 3 months of age, whereas the wild type samples 
experience a much greater decrease. This indicates that activities of 
complexes I and III are reduced in Python mice from 3 months of age. 
Complex II in Python hearts, however, is able to function comparable to that of 
the wild type until 5 months of age. At this point the addition of succinate has a 
majorly reduced effect on O2 consumption suggesting compromised complex II 
activity. This is then accompanied by the collapse of activity across all 
parameters in Python hearts when compared to wild type controls and remains 
so until the onset of CHF.

for each substrate at each time point. Values highlighted in yellow denote

mice, respectively. 
In Figure 5.12, the data from Figure 5.11 have been displayed differently in 
order to show the clear age-dependant degeneration of mitochondrial function 
in the Python heart. Between the ages of 3 and 4 months, a decrease in the 
general level of respiration is evident in the Python mice, which becomes 
further reduced by 5 months (Fig. 5.12A). ATP synthase displays a very similar 
trend with a gradual decrease in activity from 3 months old to the onset of CHF 
(Fig. 5.12B). Complex II, however, shows no alteration in activity up to 4 
months of age, which is then followed by a dramatic reduction at 5 months 
(Fig. 5.12C). The maximum capacity of the ETC also dramatically reduces at 5 
months (Fig. 5.12D), which coincides with the compromised complex II activity. 
Complex I also exhibits a dramatic reduction at the age of 5 months (Fig. 
5.12E). Complex III, gradually declines until the onset of CHF (Fig. 5.12F). In 
stark contrast, none of the parameters measured show any significant 
reduction in their activity with age in wild type hearts (Fig. 5.13). Of 42 Python 
mice in which onset of CHF was measured, a sole Python mouse was able to 
live far beyond expectation without displaying CHF symptoms. At 239 days of 
age (approx. 2 months greater than the average age of onset), the Python 
mouse finally showed signs of CHF. OXPHOS activity was subsequently 
analysed. Virtually no alteration in O2 consumption accompanied rotenone 
addition, implying complex I is severely affected in this animal. However, in

contrast to the CHF data from all other animals, complexes II and III both gave 
reasonable respiration, contradicting the age-related decrease in general 
OXPHOS across all complexes. This is however data provided from one 
mouse at this time point and therefore its significance cannot be identified at 
this point.

Taken together the data show that the Python hearts exhibit a severe reduction 
in OXPHOS at 5 months of age and appear to be able to withstand such an 
effect before developing CHF symptoms at around 6 months old. This severe 
reduction in OXPHOS is likely to be initiated by the decreased activity of ATP 
synthase at 4 months of age, followed by a dramatic reduction in complex I 
and II activity at 5 months of age, then complex III activity at 6 months. The 
unique Python mouse that was able to live to 8 months old may have been due 
to sufficient activity of complexes II and III compared to other Python mice, 
before complex I activity eventually diminished beyond levels of survival. Such 
a mouse is rare  only one such animal was observed over 9 years of 
maintaining the colony where more than 1,000 Python mice had been left to 
age until they develop CHF symptoms. 
5.1.5 Python ES cells fail to differentiate into cardiomyocytes 
The ES cells were generated to enable a cardiomyocyte cell culture model to 
be developed, using established assays to differentiate ES cells along the 
cardiomyocyte lineage (Burridge et al., 2011). Images were taken every 2 days 
after the onset of stimulation to differentiate until d9 (presence of beating cells) 
in order to monitor cell confluency and morphology. The wild type cells 
remained at high confluency throughout the differentiation process, whereas 
Python cells became more sparse (Fig. 5.14A). Cells were also counted. It 
became evident that by day 3 of differentiation the amount of cell loss in the 
Python cell line was double to that of wild type cells, with both cell lines 
maintaining stable cell numbers from this point onwards (Fig. 5.14B).  
 In addition to increased cell loss in Python lines, the differentiation 
process itself appeared to be effected, as no beating cells were present after 
cardiomyocyte induction (Fig. 5.14C). For the wild type cell line, 11 beating 
clumps were observed per 10
 cells. Expression of mRNA for a number of 
cardiomyocyte markers were also examined to test for extent of cardiomyocyte 
differentiation (Fig. 5.14D). -actin (Actb) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (Gapdh) are ubiquitously expressed and their equal 
expression across all samples were used to confirm equal cDNA input levels. 
POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (Pou5f1) is a pluripotent marker 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /13*
and as expected, expressed at high levels in both ES cell lines. The Python ES 
cell-differentiated cardiomyocytes also expressed the pluripotent marker, 
suggesting a problem in differentiating Python ES cells. The three 
cardiomyocyte markers: GATA binding protein 4 (Gata4), myosin light chain 2 
(Myl2) and -myosin heavy chain (Myh7) were highly expressed in the wild 
type ES cell-differentiated cardiomyocytes indicating efficient differentiation 
into cardiomyocytes. In contrast, the Python cardiomyocytes expressed very 
low levels of these markers. This raises the possibility that Python ES cells 
undergo problems in cell reprogramming. Based on this inability of Python ES 
cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, the data obtained from experiments 
in which cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells were used e.g. cytoplasmic Ca
 (Fig. 
5.7B) cannot be relaiably interpreted as the control wild type cells are not 
equivalent to the Python cells.

Figure 5.14. Python ES cells fail to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. (A) 
Images were taken from d1 (the day in which cardiomyocyte-induction started) 
to d9 at 2 day intervals using Olympus CKX41 microscope and CAMEDIA C-
7070 camera. Scale bars represent 100M. The wild type cells remained 
confluent throughout the 9 days whereas Python cells became far sparser 
when driven down the cardiomyocyte lineage. (B) Cell counts of wild type and 
Python cells as they were being driven down the cardiomyocyte lineage 
showed an initial decrease in cell number from d1 to d3, however the decrease 
in the Python cell line was far greater than that of wild type. (C) By d9 beating 
cell clumps were evident in the wild type cells, 11 clusters on average per 10
cells. However no beating clumps were evident in the Python cells. (D) 
Cardiomyocyte-specific cDNA markers were used to assess the quality of 
differentiation. Gata4, Myl2 and Myh7 were shown to be expressed at high 
levels in wild type induced-cardiomyocytes, but much weaker in the Python 
cells. Pou5f1, a measure of pluripotency indicated the Python cells still 
retained some of the pluripotent marker, albeit, far less than the ES cells for 
both wild type and Python lines. Actb and Gapdh are ubiquitously expressed 
and were detected across all samples equally, demonstrating equal loading 
amounts.

5.1.6 ATP levels are reduced in differentiated Python cell lines 
Several Python cell lines had been developed for studies  cultured skin 
fibroblasts, immortalised MEFs and ES cells.  ATP levels (measured using a 
luciferase/luciferin-based assay) were not altered in ES cells (Fig. 5.15A). This 
is consistent with data showing no alteration in OXPHOS activity for ES cells 
as ES cells use primarily glycolysis to generate ATP (Cho et al., 2006, Prigione 
et al., 2010, Kondoh et al., 2007). The Python ES cells begin to show reduced 
ATP levels as they are differentiated down the cardiomyocyte lineage, first as 
they form embryoid bodies (Fig. 5.15B) and is maintained in more fully 
differentiated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5.15C) though as mentioned above, these 
differentiated cells are not the equivalent to their wild type counterparts. 
Surprisingly, Python MEFs also show a reduction in ATP levels (Fig. 5.15D) 
despite the fact they have normal OXPHOS activity. 
Figure 5.15. ATP levels in cell lines. ATP was measured using a luciferase-
based assay. No significant alteration in ATP concentration was evident in ES 
cells (A) (Students t test, P=0.3572), n=3. However upon ES cell 
differentiation, a reduction in ATP concentration in Python embryoid bodies 
became clear (B) (Students t test, P<0.001), n=13 and remained low across 
cardiomyocyte-induction (C) (Students t test, P=0.012), n=5. Python MEFs 
were also shown to display a reduced ATP concentration (D) (Students t test, 
P=0.0025), n=3.

5.1.7 DNM1L protein levels in the heart increase with age 
One aspect of the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that occurs in Python mice is 
that overt symptoms develop at a particular age; an average of 82 days of age 
on the C3H/HeN background and 168 days on the C57BL/6J background 
(Appendix XIII). Furthermore, fusion and fission of mitochondria is, apparently, 
very low in adult cardiomyocytes (Hom and Sheu, 2009), so we wished to 
examine whether fusion and fission proteins were, indeed, expressed in adult 
hearts, and whether there was any change over time. Proteins were extracted 
from the brains and hearts of female and male C57BL/6J mice at the ages of 1 
week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 13 months (males only for 
the last timepoint).  The concentrations of extracted proteins were determined 
and then equal amounts of the three samples at each time point and sex were 
pooled and used for Western blot analysis. #-Tubulin was used to normalise 
the protein levels. Strikingly, an increase in DNM1L expression in the heart 
with age was observed (Fig. 5.16A), particularly that of the 73KDa heart-
specific isoform. In contrast there was little, if any, change in brain DNM1L 
levels (Fig. 5.16B). Other mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins also showed a 
similar trend. OPA1 is present in 5 isoforms between 80 and 100KDa in size 
(Akepati et al., 2008) and all isoforms are shown to increase with age in the 
heart, but not in the brain. MFN2 exists in 2 distinct molecular weights. The 
isoform of approx. 80KDa showed no difference in protein level between 
tissues or ages while the 50KDa isoform showed a substantial increase with 
age in the heart, but appears to be barely present in the brain at any age. 
TIM23, the protein used to reflect mitochondrial abundance in each sample 
also showed a 2
 isoform that increased in abundance with age. This isoform 
is seen in the heart and to a lesser extent in the brain from 3 months of age.

5.2 Discussion 
Mitochondrial OXPHOS produces ATP, the major source of cellular energy. 
Cardiomyocytes have high energy demands to cope with the demands of 
cardiac contraction. For this reason, fatty acid oxidation is the main substrate 
utilized in OXPHOS in cardiomyocytes and can provide up to 131 ATP 
molecules per fatty acid, whereas 1 glucose molecule produces only 38 ATP 
molecules. Python hearts exhibit a severe decline in ATP production that is 
apparent as early as 5 weeks of age (Ashrafian et al., 2010). The questions 
remain as to (i) why the Dnm1l
 mutation mainly affects cardiomyocytes; (ii) 
why ATP reduction results; (iii) why the onset of DCM takes time to develop 
postnatally; and (iv) why the onset of DCM develops at different ages in 
different strain backgrounds. The first may be explained in terms of the severity 
of the mutation on DNM1L function. If it is proposed that the Python mutation 
leads to a reduction, but not a complete abrogation, of DNM1L function, then 
tissues that have high energy demands for ATP and use OXPHOS as the 
primary ATP generation pathway, such as the heart, are more likely to be 
affected. Also, the heart may not be the only organ affected but possibly a 
reduction in the functional capacity of other organs does not have as 
deleterious effect on the organism as a reduction in cardiac output or is 
perhaps more difficult to detect phenotypically.  
Regarding the age at which overt DCM symptoms first appear, this 
might reflect a changing role of DNM1L over time in the heart that does not 
occur in other tissues. In the C3H/HeN background, the change is more 
precipitate than in the C57BL/6J background. As an initial investigation of this 
possibility, the expression of DNM1L was examined in mice of various ages. 
Surprisingly, DNM1L expression levels were shown to increase in the heart 
with age, whereas little change was observed in the brain. In particular, a 
73KDa isoform present in the heart increases more drastically than the 79KDa 
isoform. The significance of this change is unknown, as indeed, is the nature of 
the difference between the two heart isoforms. OPA1 isoforms and the 50KDa 
isoform of MFN2 also showed a similar trend. The general increase in fusion 
and fission proteins specific to the heart may go some way in providing the 
answer as to why Python mice develop an age-related defect in OXPHOS in 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /28*
the heart, when the mutation is present in all tissues. For instance as the 
mouse ages, cardiomyocyte size increases, requiring an increase in the 
production of ATP to maintain sufficient contraction. By 6 months of age, ATP 
production cannot match energy demands. This cell size/ATP requirement 
increase also requires an increase in mitochondrial volume and, ipso facto, all 
the proteins that participate in mitochondrial dynamics. However, this cannot 
explain all of the increase in DNM1L levels as even when normalised to the 
mitochondrial protein TIM23, there was still a massive increase with age in 
levels of DNM1L and other fusion/fission proteins. 
Interestingly the OXPHOS system has also been shown to exhibit an 
age-related decrease in efficiency in the Python heart. By 5 months of age on 
the C57BL/6J background, all complexes of the ETC display reduced activity, 
the most notable being that of complexes I and II. The mouse is still viable at 
this point. By 6 months of age, mice on this background radically develop CHF 
and die within 48 hours. The reduced efficiency of OXPHOS at this point is 
reflected in an ATP output below a threshold required for the survival of 
cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes are high-energy demanding cells; other cells 
at this time point may remain healthy as they may be able to tolerate lower 
levels of ATP production due to lower energy demands. One Python mouse 
was able to live far longer than expected, to 239 days. Analysis of the ETC 
revealed that complex I activity was very diminished, although other aspects of 
the ETC remained functional. This may explain why that particular mouse was 
able to live so long. If all complexes, but complex I are functioning sufficiently, 
then ATP production may remain above the threshold required for 
cardiomyocyte function for longer. Progressive decline in complex I activity 
eventually hindered ATP production leading to CHF and the same symptoms 
as other Python mice. 
 One possibility how OXPHOS efficiency gradually declines over age in 
Python mice may lie in a capability of DNM1L to function in tethering between 
the ER and mitochondria. Ca
 is a key regulator of enzyme complexes that 
participate in the CAC and ETC. Therefore mitochondrial Ca
 uptake is a vital 
process in cell survival. Physical tethering between the ER and mitochondria 
allows the mitochondria to be within close proximity to Ca
 when released 
from the ER. The highly organised linear arrangement of mitochondria in 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /20*
cardiomyocytes may allow for a shorter distance between the two organelles, 
facilitating more efficient Ca
 uptake by the mitochondria and a more regular 
rate of ATP production for these constantly contracting cells. Upon ER-Ca
release, cytoplasmic Ca
 concentration increases but rapidly returns to basal 
levels in wild type cells, though remains high in Python cells. Cytoplasmic Ca
levels were measured in ES cells and cardiomyocyte-induced ES cells. A 
notable difference between the two cell types was the peak cytoplasmic Ca
concentration after release from the ER. In ES cells, this peak was equal 
between wild type and Python cells whereas Python cardiomyocyte-induced 
ES cells exhibited a far higher peak compared to their wild type counterparts. 
As ES cells dont rely primarily on OXPHOS, but use the glycolytic pathway to 
generate ATP, there is less need for large Ca
 stores and regular ER-
mediated Ca
 release. Cardiomyocytes, however, rely heavily on OXPHOS. 
When Ca
 is released from the ER, if mitochondria are unable to take it up 
efficiently, it is possible that the ER will take back more Ca
 through the 
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca
-ATPase (SERCA). This would 
gradually increase the concentration of Ca
 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 
lumen, thereby resulting in a larger Ca
 release upon stimulation. After the 
initial increase in cytoplasmic Ca
 as a result of release from the ER, 
cytoplasmic Ca
 will normally drop due to mitochondrial Ca
 uptake via the 
mitochondrial Ca
 uniporter (MCU) and ER Ca
 uptake via the SERCA. A 
reduction in mitochondrial Ca
 uptake along with lower ATP levels to activate 
the SERCA may contribute to a prolonged cytosolic Ca
 concentration. 
Dysfunction in mitochondrial Ca
 uptake in Python cells was confirmed when 
measuring mitochondrial Ca
 levels upon agonistinduced ER Ca
 release. 
This is likely to be a result of decreased tethering and hence, the increased 
distance between the two organelles (Friedman et al., 2011). 
 is taken up via the MCU, a transmembrane protein located in the 
IMM. Activity of the MCU is maintained by the MMP (Hansford and Zorov, 
1998). The MMP is also responsible for the activity of ATP synthase. The 
protons in the intermembrane space pass through the ATP synthase, providing 
energy to catalyse the conversion of ADP + Pi into ATP. Upon MMP 
dissipation, ATP production is impaired, as is mitochondrial Ca
 uptake. The 
MCU was recently shown to modulate contraction in neonatal cardiomyocytes 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /21*
(Drago et al., 2012). Inhibition of MCU activity is likely to affect the efficiency of 
the ETC as a result of inefficient Ca
 uptake. As a consequence, protons will 
not be pumped into the intermembrane space, therefore leading to a reduced 
MMP. This will initially reduce ATP production, but mitochondrial Ca
 uptake 
will also be further impeded by reduced MCU activity. This will lead to a 
progressive decline in ETC activity and ATP production along with continued 
dissipation of the MMP. 
 mtDNA deletions and membrane dissipation have been linked to a 
reduced respiratory output (Parone et al., 2006, Legros et al., 2002, Twig et al., 
2008). It is possible that fusion and fission are important processes in the 
maintenance and restoration of functional mitochondria, allowing the cell to 
cope with mutations in mtDNA (Mouli et al., 2009). For example, fusion would 
allow mixing of contents and thus, functional mtDNA and membrane potential 
to be shared with functionally challenged mitochondria. Fission may allow 
segregation of defective mitochondrial units e.g. one which is depolarized and 
beyond restoration; this is then targeted for mitophagy to recycle metabolites 
and synthesize new macromolecules (Mouli et al., 2009, Twig et al., 2008). 
Reduced mitochondrial fission or fusion may therefore lead to the 
accumulation of either damaged mtDNA and or dysfunctional mitochondria in 
the cell. However, no obvious increase in mutant mtDNA forms was detected in 
Python heart, brain and rectus femoris samples suggesting this is not the 
reason for the respiratory dysfunction. The method used in this study would 
only detect mtDNA deletions upto 2kb in size and was relatively crude in 
nature. In comparison, a better way to detect mtDNA mutations would be that 
of a random-mutation capture assay, as used by Chen et al (2010). In this 
method deep sequencing methodology was used to detect base pair mutations 
and small deletions. 
Further experiments were carried out to detect alterations in the level of 
autophagy. ATP levels are monitored by the energy sensor AMPK (Cardenas 
et al., 2010, Green and Wang, 2010). Sufficient ATP levels maintain the 
inactivation of AMPK, while insufficient ATP results in the phosphorylation of 
this sensor protein, forming P-AMPK. P-AMPK then activates the autophagic 
pathway by stimulating fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, 
breaking down metabolites engulfed by the autophagosome and providing 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /22*
nutrients such as acetyl coA for the CAC and subsequent mitochondrial 
OXPHOS to re-establish sufficient ATP levels. Because ATP depletion is 
present in the Python heart, an increase in autophagy was predicted. However, 
protein detections of P-AMPK showed no alteration between Python and wild 
type hearts and brains at 5 weeks and 13 weeks of age. Upon completion of 
the autophagosome, LC3-I is converted to LC3-II by cleavage and lipidation 
and becomes localised to the autophagosome membrane (Kabeya et al., 
2000). The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was also investigated by means of 
Western blotting, but again, no alteration was evident in Python mice. 
However, distinct punctate structures visualised by immunocytochemical 
staining of LC3 were present in wild type cells, but not Python cells and may 
suggest a decrease in autophagy in Python cells. Further experiments may be 
required to detect more subtle changes in autophagy and deduce the impact of 
Python on autophagy. As ATP depletion coincides with CHF onset in Python 
mice, it may be necessary to examine levels of autophagy in terminally ill mice. 
Inhibition of DNM1L activity has recently been shown to disrupt cell 
reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
(Vazquez-Martin et al., 2012). A crucial difference between somatic cells and 
iPSCs is their mechanism of energy metabolism. While somatic cells rely 
mainly on mitochondrial OXPHOS, pluripotent stem cells use glycolysis. In the 
study of Vazques-Martin et al (2012), the mitochondrial division inhibitor mdivi-
1 (Cassidy-Stone et al., 2008) was used to inhibit DNM1L activity in human 
fibroblasts. Mitochondrial elongation was a notable effect due to decreased 
fission. Another consequence of inhibiting DNM1L was decreased mitophagy. 
This is possibly due to the inability of mitochondria to divide and so unable to 
expose small fragments of damaged mitochondria for elimination (Cassidy-
Stone et al., 2008). Reprogramming was shown to be less efficient when 
DNM1L was inhibited. It was postulated that DNM1L-mediated mitophagy 
promotes the degradation of mitochondria during reprogramming of somatic 
cells, possibly leading to a reduction in mitochondrial number, and size, driving 
a more efficient conversion of ATP production back to glycolysis (Vazquez-
Martin et al., 2012). Furthermore, DNM1L inhibition of successfully 
reprogrammed iPSCs induced differentiation, implying a role for DNM1L in 
maintaining pluripotency. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /23*
In the current study, ES cells were one of the models used to investigate the 
effect of Python. Although DNM1L activity in ES cells derived from Python 
heterozygotes was clearly reduced as seen by an enlarged mitochondrial 
network, the cells appeared morphologically similar to wild type ES cells 
(Appendix XIV) and exhibited similar growth rates (Appendix XV). Nor were 
ATP levels compromised. The phenotype of the Python heterozygote appears 
to be primarily manifested in the heart and so ES cells were differentiated 
down a cardiomyocyte-specific lineage. It became clear that the Python ES 
cells did not differentiate properly and retained some pluripotency as indicated 
by the presence of Pou5f1 mRNA (a marker of pluripotency). Contrary to the 
findings of Vasquez-Martin et al (2012) reduced DNM1L activity in Python cells 
appears to prevent proper differentiation, whereas DNM1L inhibition with 
mdivi-1 appears to promote differentiation. Differences between species, 
differences between ES cells and iPSCs, or differences between the level of 
DNM1L activity inhibition may account for this variability. Alternatively the 
effect of the Python mutation and mdivi-1 action may produce alterations in two 
distinctly different processes. However it seems that energy metabolism might 
play a central role in reprogramming in general, whether back to a pluripotent 
state or to drive differentiation down a specific lineage. Similarly ATP levels 
were shown to be reduced when differentiating ES cells down the 
cardiomyocyte lineage. It may be this reduction in energy metabolism due to 
DNM1L
 that becomes problematic for reprogramming of any cell. An 
irreconcilable difference is that Python ES cells did not differentiate in vitro 
normally, yet in vivo mice are viable and appear relatively normal at birth, 
implying differentiation is not adversely affected to any significant degree.

Chapter 6 : Introduction of the Python mutation 
into R6/2 mice does not ameliorate progressive 
development of Huntingtons disease. 
6.1 Introduction 
Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The 
mutation responsible for this disease is a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat 
expansion in the HTT gene. Unaffected individuals possess 6  35 polyQ 
repeats while 36  39 repeats demonstrates HD with incomplete penetrance, 
and over 40 repeats results in HD with complete penetrance (Rubinsztein et 
al., 1996). These polyQ HTT proteins aggregate in the nuclei and cytosol in the 
cortex and striatum (DiFiglia et al., 1997, Gutekunst et al., 1999, Maat-
Schieman et al., 1999) accompanied with striatal neurodegeneration and 
general atrophy of the brain (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998). Age of onset for 
HD symptoms range from childhood to old age with increased severity being 
linked to a larger number of repeats. Symptoms for adult onset HD include 
psychiatric disturbances, impairment of motor coordination, cognitive decline 
and weight loss. Juvenile HD (onset before 21 years of age) is the result of 
more than 65 polyQ repeats. Patients with juvenile HD exhibit additional 
symptoms such as rigidity, tremors and seizures.  
 The most extensively characterised mouse model of HD is the 
transgenic R6/2 line (Mangiarini et al., 1996). The transgene consists of ~1kb 
of 5 untralnslated region sequences, exon 1 of the HTT gene carrying 144 
polyQ repeats, plus the first 262bp of intron 1. By 6 weeks of age, R6/2 mice 
display symptoms of HD, including impaired motor coordination and balance 
as revealed through a rotarod test (Bett et al., 2006, Hockly et al., 2006). Grip 
strength is also weaker then that of wild type controls by 12 weeks of age (Bett 
et al., 2006, Hockly et al., 2006). Weight gain rate also slows from a similar 
time point, with the reduction in males being more prominent (Bett et al., 2006, 
Hockly et al., 2006, Hockly et al., 2003). Symptoms progressively worsen with 
age and by 15 weeks are so severe that animals rarely survive past this point 
(Woodman et al., 2007). The R6/2 model of HD resembles that of human HD 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /25*
in many aspects though there are some difference (e.g. earlier age of onset) 
(Lione et al., 1999).  
Deducing the molecular mechanisms involved in HD pathogenesis will 
help to develop therapeutic targets. Recent reports demonstrate increased 
DNM1L activity in HD. DNM1L is stimulated to translocate to the OMM via an 
increase in the direct interaction between HTT and DNM1L  (Song et al., 
2011). Also, as a result of increased ER Ca
 efflux, DNM1L-dephophorylation 
by calcineurin is also increased leading to increased translocation to the OMM. 
The result is increased mitochondrial fragmentation (Costa et al., 2010, Song 
et al., 2011). Expression of the dominant-negative mutation, DNM1L
restore normal mitochondrial morphology in lymphocytes (Costa et al., 2010). 
If altered mitochondrial morphology is pathogenic, correcting 
mitochondrial morphology might ameliorate HD (Costa et al., 2010, Song et al., 
2011). Since Python alters DNM1L activity and mitochondrial morphology, a 
correction in DNM1L activity and mitochondrial morphology would be restored 
by combining the R6/2 transgene (increased DNM1L activity and increased 
fission) and the Python mutation (decreased DNM1L activity and decreased 
fission). This theory can be tested in mice. 
Transgenic R6/2
 male mice (provided by Professor Gillian Bates) 
were mated with Dnm1l
 female mice on the C57BL/6J background. 
Offspring were of 4 genotypes: (i) R6/2
 Dnm1l
, which are wild type mice; 
(ii) R6/2
 Dnm1l
, which represent positive for the Python mutation; (iii) 
 Dnm1l
, which are positive for the R6/2 transgene; and (iv) R6/2
Dnm1l
(hereafter referred to as R6/2 x Python mice), which contain both the 
Python mutation and the R6/2 transgene. If animals containing both mutations 
were to improve or ameliorate the symptoms of the disease, this would be 
noticed via observations and analyses such as weight gain, grip strength, limb 
clasping, and brain weights. Mitochondrial morphology was also investigated to 
see if this corrected and correlated with any improvement in symptoms.

6.2 Results 
6.2.1 Introduction of the Python mutation into R6/2 mice 
corrects the mitochondrial morphology defect. 
It has previously been shown that the altered mitochondrial morphology 
phenotype can be observed in non-neuronal cells in HD patients such as 
fibroblasts and lymphoblasts (Costa et al., 2010, Song et al., 2011). Fibroblasts 
were cultured from mouse tails for each genotype at two age points: 5 weeks 
and 15 weeks. Figures 6.1A and 6.2A clearly show a reduction in mitochondrial 
fragmentation in R6/2 x Python mice compared to R6/2 mice. To quantify this, 
the length of 50 mitochondria were measured for each genotype using ImageJ 
and this revealed that not only is fragmentation reduced, but also their 
phenotypic length is restored to one very similar to that of wild type 
mitochondria (Figs. 6.1B, 6.2B).  
 Neurodegeneration is a hallmark of HD. Therefore it was also 
necessary to investigate mitochondrial morphology in neurons. As only 50% of 
R6/2 males successfully produce offspring (Mangiarini et al., 1996), 
maintenance of the colony proved difficult. For this reason mitochondrial 
morphology was initially investigated in neurons of Python and wild type mice 
only, while R6/2 and R6/2 x Python mice were being bred. A striking difference 
is observed. Wild type neurons possess mainly circular mitochondria, equally 
distributed along the axons. The purpose of such circular formations is 
unknown. In contrast, the mitochondria in Python neurons are far more 
elongated and dont form circular structures at all (Fig. 6.3). Mitochondria have 
been shown to be able to translocate along axons (Banks et al., 1969), and in 
Python neurons many mitochondria are aggregated around the nucleus, 
possibly because these are too large to travel along axons (Fig. 6.3). Due to 
time constraints, it was not possible to analyse mitochondrial morphology in 
the striatal neurons of R6/2 and R6/2 x Python mice. Therefore, the extent to 
which the mitochondrial morphology phenotype is corrected in R6/2 neurons 
by introduction of Python is not known, though the observed correction in 
fibroblasts is suggestive that a similar correction could be seen in neurons.

6.2.2 Introduction of the Python mutation does not alter 
HD symptoms. 
Severe declines in body weight and grip strength are initial signs of HD onset, 
accompanied with atrophy, in particular, of the brain. Body weights and grip 
strength were monitored until the onset of severe HD symptoms at 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /30*
approximately 15 weeks. If the Python mutation was to improve the health of 
R6/2 mice, then HD symptoms would appear later on, or be less severe.  In a 
cohort of over 70 mice of both sexes, R6/2 x Python mice were observed to 
exhibit the same severity and progression of symptoms to those of R6/2 mice. 
 Body weights of R6/2 and R6/2 x Python mice showed a progressive 
decline from the age of 11 weeks, whereas wild type and Python mice 
continued to gain weight. This was evident in both males and females (Fig. 
6.4). At the age of 15 weeks the weight decline in both R6/2 and R6/2 x Python 
mice resulted in a weight reminiscent of 5-week-old mice. Python mice actually 
show lower weight gain from the age of 8-9 weeks onwards, in comparison to 
wild type mice, revealing another phenotype in Python mice. 
Forelimb grip strength measurements revealed a natural decline of grip 
strength with age for all mice. However from the age of 12-weeks-old, R6/2 
and R6/2 x Python mice displayed significantly greater declines in grip strength 
in comparison to wild type controls but there was no difference between R6/2 
and R6/2 x Python mice  (Fig. 6.5). 
Brain weights were measured at 15 weeks of age for all mice. Atrophy 
of the brain in R6/2 mice was evident as reflected in decreased weight (Fig. 
6.6), consistent with previous reports (Cepeda-Prado et al., 2012). No 
improvement is observed in mice possessing the R6/2 transgene and the 
Python mutation (Fig. 6.6). Interestingly in male mice, combining the 2 
mutations reduces the brain weight even further (Fig. 6.6B), (Table 6.2). 
However this is not replicated in female mice (Fig. 6.6A), (Table 6.2). If the 
Python mutation alone reduced brain weight, this might explain that in 
combination with the R6/2 transgene, the severity of brain atrophy would 
increase, but the reduction seen between wild type and Python mice is not 
significant in females (Fig. 6.6A) nor males (Fig. 6.6B)  (Table 6.2). 
It was also noted that during the experiment, upon handling of mice by 
the tip of the tail, hind limb clasping was evident in the R6/2 and R6/2 x Python 
mice from 7 weeks of age. Clasping progressively worsened for both 
genotypes with a more rapid clasping response to handling and progression to 
4-limb clasping.

rescued by the presence of Python. Mice were weighed twice a week from 
3-weeks-old until the onset of HD symptoms. From 11 weeks, body weight

mice.

6.2.3 HTT aggregation remains in R6/2 x Python cortex 
Mutant HTT (mHTT) protein is expressed throughout the brain of HD patients 
(Aronin et al., 1995), but neuronal degeneration is localised to the striatal and 
cortical regions. Aggregation of mHTT was shown to develop selectively in the 
cortex and striata of HD symptomatic patients and proposed as a possible 
reason for neuronal cell death (DiFiglia et al., 1997). Nuclear aggregates have 
also been reported in R6/2 transgenic mice (Davies et al., 1997). These 
aggregates are insoluble and therefore detectable by Western blot in the 
insoluble fraction of an SDS polyacrylamide gel. Examination of the level of 
mHTT protein aggregation was detected by Western blot of cortical protein 
extracts (Fig. 6.7). The antibody used, mEM48, preferentially binds to mHTT. 
Aggregation of the mutant protein was shown to remain in R6/2 x Python mice 
as much as in R6/2 mice. This may help to explain why an improvement in HD 
symptoms was not seen when combining the Python mutation with the R6/2 
transgene.

mitochondrial dysfunction may also be responsible for the disease phenotype 
(Beal, 2005). Impaired mitochondrial ATP production has been detected in 
striatal neurons from HD patients (Tabrizi et al., 1999), and brain tissue of the 
transgenic R6/2 mouse (Smith et al., 2006). However it is unknown whether a 
reduction in ATP production is a cause of, or a consequence of, neuronal cell 
death. Preserved mitochondrial OXPHOS activity early in HD when neuronal 
cell loss is already present provides an argument for the latter (Powers et al., 
2007, Guidetti et al., 2001). 
We therefore wished to examine ATP levels in the R6/2 x Python 
mouse to see if the Python mutation was able to restore ATP production. 
Whole brain and striatal lysate was measured for ATP levels by a luciferase 
assay. No difference was observed in whole brain lysate between all 4 strains 
of mice (Fig. 6.8A), however when selectively measuring ATP levels in striatal 
lysate, there is a clear reduction exhibited by R6/2 mice compared to wild type 
or Python mice. The reduction of R6/2 striatal ATP concentration is not 
improved by the presence of the Python mutation (Fig. 6.8B).

6.2.5 The R6/2 transgene does not increase DNM1L levels in 
Python mice. 
It may be that Python does not alter the presumptive increased DNM1L activity 
caused by the R6/2 transgene. There was no direct readout possible for 
DNM1L activity in mice. However, cellular DNM1L levels could be measured by 
Western blot analysis.  Proteins were extracted from the heart, brain and 
rectus femoris and Western blotted to detect levels of DNM1L protein 
expression. Mice that contain the Python mutation (Py and R6/2 x Py) exhibit 
lower total DNM1L protein levels when compared to wild type or R6/2 mice 
(Fig. 6.7) suggesting that introduction of the Python mutation was resulting in 
lower DNM1L levels in double mutant mice compared to R6/2 mice. By 
extension, DNM1L activity might be reduced in the R6/2 x Python mice 
compared to R6/2 alone given the reduced DNM1L levels. Regardless, 
introduction of Dnm1l
 was not able to correct for the adverse effects of the 
R6/2 transgene.

6.3 Discussion 
HD is characterized by striatal neuron degeneration (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 
1998). The mutation responsible for this disorder is a polyQ repeat expansion 
of exon 1 of the HTT gene. The greater the number of repeats, the more 
severe the phenotype (Duyao et al., 1993). The R6/2 mouse model of HD, 
which expresses exon 1 containing 144 polyQ repeats of the human HTT 
gene, has been a useful model due to the rapid onset of HD symptoms 
(Mangiarini et al., 1996).   
Recently, abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology and DNM1L 
activity have been implicated in HD. An increased interaction between mutant 
HTT and DNM1L induces translocation to the OMM and GTPase activation, 
leading to increased fragmentation of the mitochondria (Song et al., 2011). 
Dephosphorylation of DNM1L by the increased activity of calcineurin also 
increases the translocation and activity of DNM1L (Costa et al., 2010). By 
restoring mitochondrial morphology, through expression of the dominant-
negative version DNM1L
 has been reported to reverse defects within the 
cell such as mitochondrial anterograde and retrograde movement and 
neuronal apoptosis (Song et al., 2011). It is therefore possible that 
overexpression of a mutant DNM1L displaying decreased GTPase activity may 
ameliorate HD symptoms be correcting the defect of hyperactive DNM1L 
activity. 
 To test this hypothesis, R6/2 mice were crossed with Python mice to 
produce offspring containing both mutations. Mitochondrial morphology was 
shown to be restored to that of wild type length in fibroblasts, though the extent 
to which the Python mutation corrects mitochondrial morphology in neuron 
remains unknown. Progressive HD symptoms such as decreased body weight, 
decreased grip strength, clasping and decreased brain weight revealed the 
presence of HD symptoms were unchanged. Data provided in the literature for 
R6/2 body weights is somewhat variable. Although weight gain has been 
observed to be reduced in R6/2 mice from 8 weeks of age, the animals did not 
always lose weight (Bett et al., 2006, Hockly et al., 2006). In another study, 
weight loss becomes apparent by 10 weeks old in the R6/2 males, but not until 
12 weeks in females, with the loss in males being far more dramatic (Hockly et 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /40*
al., 2003). The current study presents data displaying a drop in body weight 
from 12 weeks in males and 13 weeks in females in accordance with a more 
prominent loss in males. 
 Grip strength studies also display some variation. In one study, grip 
strength increases with age for both wild type and R6/2 animals, but with a 
significantly lower increase in R6/2 mice after 10 weeks of age (Bett et al., 
2006). In a separate study, grip strength shows a progressive decline with age 
for all mice, with R6/2 mice displaying significantly greater decline from 9 
weeks of age (Hockly et al., 2006). In agreement with the latter, grip strength 
was shown to decline with age for all mice, wild type included, in the current 
study. Those possessing the R6/2 transgene exhibited a greater decrease by 
13 weeks of age. 
 PolyQ aggregates have been reported to accumulate in the nuclei of 
the cortex and striatum of HD individuals (DiFiglia et al., 1997, Gutekunst et al., 
1999, Maat-Schieman et al., 1999) and in R6/2 mice as early as 4 weeks of 
age (Davies et al., 1997, Li et al., 1999b). HTT aggregation was confirmed in 
the R6/2 mouse cortex, which showed no improvement when the Python 
mutation was also present. However mHTT aggregation was not detectable in 
the striata of R6/2 or R6/2 x Python mice during this study. It has been 
suggested that aggregation of the mutant protein occurs initially in the cortex. 
As striatal aggregates are detected more rarely, their formation may lead to 
sudden neuronal death in the striata, making detection more difficult 
(Gutekunst et al., 1999). It would also be necessary to investigate the 
distribution of this aggregation by immunohistochemistry of brain sections in 
mice containing the R6/2 transgene and the Python mutation to see if it was 
altered at all.  
 Impaired ATP production has been shown to be present in the striatal 
neurons of HD patients (Tabrizi et al., 1999) and has also been replicated in 
the brain of the R6/2 mouse (Smith et al., 2006), though this impairment is 
likely to be a result of neuronal cell death given that striatal demise is detected 
earlier than mitochondrial dysfunction (Powers et al., 2007, Guidetti et al., 
2001). Contrary to the study of Smith et al (2006), in the current study, ATP 
levels showed no alteration between whole brains of wild type and R6/2 mice. 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /41*
However measuring ATP levels of the striatal regions revealed a significant 
reduction, which was not improved by the introduction of the Python mutation. 
Its clear that reducing mitochondrial fission in the R6/2 mouse has not 
improved behavioural symptoms or the molecular biological consequences of 
progressive HD. Despite these results, ameliorating HD symptoms by 
expression of a mutant form of DNM1L should not be excluded as a potential 
useful amelioration factor; it may require a fine balance in the expression levels 
of DNM1L
 to have a positive effect on the improvement of HD symptoms.

Chapter 7 : General discussion 
A mutation named Python was generated in mice by means of a large-scale 
ENU mutagenesis screen. The mutation is located in exon 11 of the Dnm1l 
gene. Although the protein is ubiquitously expressed, an apparent heart-
specific energy-deficient phenotype is the result in mice heterozygous for the 
mutation. The phenotype manifests itself in an age-dependent manner from 
around 5 weeks of age, eventually triggering the onset of congestive heart 
failure (CHF). Homozygous Python mice, however, die during embryogenesis. 
Investigations of the Dnm1l
 mutation were intended to ascertain (i) how the 
mutation leads to an alteration in the normal activity of the DNM1L protein; (ii) 
how this altered activity affects the normal cellular function(s) of this protein 
and, ultimately (iii) how the altered cellular functions lead to heart failure. 
7.1 How the Python mutation alters DNM1L activity 
DNM1L is involved in the process of mitochondrial fission. Reduced DNM1L 
protein levels were observed in the hearts and brains of Python heterozygotes, 
however the Python allele was shown to be expressed in equal amounts to the 
wild type allele at the mRNA level in both tissues and therefore likely to be 
expressed in equal amounts at the protein level. The mutation completely 
abrogates the interaction between the M and GED domains within the DNM1L 
monomer. Due to misfolding of the protein, DNM1L may be targeted for 
degradation, leading to a decrease in DNM1L levels in the cell. Defective 
intramolecular interactions are also likely to effect interactions with other 
proteins, one of which - UBC9 - is an important substrate for sumoylation and 
subsequent translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). These 
findings, together with decreased DNM1L protein levels, suggest that 
translocation to the OMM could be impaired. Interactions with the docking 
protein, MFF were also shown to be completely abrogated, and so if the 
Python protein is able to translocate via other post-translational modifications, 
the ability of the fission protein to remain stable on the OMM is likely to be 
reduced.  
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /43*
DNM1L self-assembly relies on contact between DNM1L assembly units on 
the OMM to form a polymer around the membrane. As a result of decreased 
stability on the OMM, the Python mutation is likely to impair the ability of Dnm1l 
to form higher-order structures. This in turn can lead to various defects. 
Assembly into higher order structures is required for maximal GTPase activity 
(Muhlberg et al., 1997, Smirnova et al., 1998). Consequently GTPase activity 
exhibited by the Python protein would be further reduced.  
The Python mutation probably acts in a dominant negative fashion. It 
was shown that the mutant protein could still interact with the wild type protein, 
thereby forming dimers. However, the GTPase activity of wild type DNM1L was 
reduced by the presence of DNM1L
. This dominant negative activity explains 
why the heterozygous phenotype is less severe than the homozygous 
phenotype, and why the homozygous phenotype is generally similar to the 
homozygous DNM1L-null phenotype (Ishihara et al., 2009, Wakabayashi et al., 
2009). One difference between homozygous phenotypes of Dnm1l
Py/Py
Dnm1l
 mutations was noticeable though; failure of Dnm1l
Py/Py
 embryo 
fibroblasts to proliferate compared to normal proliferation of Dnm1l
 fibroblasts 
(Ishihara et al., 2009, Wakabayashi et al., 2009). This difference may be the 
consequence of novel molecular functions of the protein encoded by Dnm1l
Reduced stability on the OMM and reduced GTPase activity naturally 
leads to a reduction in mitochondrial fission, thereby resulting in mitochondrial 
elongation. This was confirmed in mutant fibroblasts and ES cells, and also in 
HeLa cells transfected with a construct containing the mutated version of 
Dnm1l cDNA. Peroxisomal and ER morphology also appear to be abnormal as 
a result of the Python mutation.  
7.2. How the Python mutation might result in energy 
dysregulation. 
The ability of DNM1L to remain stable on the OMM might be critical for the 
process of tethering between mitochondria and the ER, given that DNM1L has 
been shown to interact with the ER at sites of mitochondrial fission (Friedman 
et al, 2010). The reduced amount of DNM1L on mitochondria in Python 
fibroblasts suggests a possible reduction in the tethering capability of 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /44*
mitochondria and the ER though further work would be necessary to confirm 
this e.g. detailed imaging of mitochondrial-ER contact points in cells. If 
tethering were reduced, mitochondria might be unable to remain in close 
proximity to the ER. When Ca
 is then released from the ER, the increased 
distance between the mitochondria and the ER is likely to cause reduced 
mitochondrial Ca
 uptake. A reduced mitochondrial Ca
 uptake was shown to 
be the case in ES cells. Independently, collaborators confirmed a similar 
phenotype in immortalized Python fibroblasts (Dr. Houman Ashrafian and Dr. 
Tom Cahill, University of Oxford; Dr. John Boyle, University of Leeds, 
unpublished data). As a result, key enzymes of mitochondrial respiration, 
which are regulated by Ca
, display a progressive decline in activity over time. 
Fewer protons would be pumped into the intermembrane space, reducing the 
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The MMP is directly used in ATP 
production and also mitochondrial Ca
 uptake.  
ATP was shown to be reduced in the heart, but not brain or liver in the 
heterozygous Python mouse. In the C57BL/6J strain, there was an age-related 
reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity in Python mice. This 
corresponded to an age-related increased protein expression of Dnm1l in the 
heart, which wasnt observed in the brain. This may signify a function for 
Dnm1l that is either specific to the heart or greatly increases in importance in 
the heart with age. Eventually, the effect of the Python mutation leads to a 
reduction in ATP production beyond survival capabilities, while other cells are 
able to maintain viability. In addition, because the MMP becomes 
compromised as a result of defective mitochondrial Ca
 uptake, this not only 
directly reduces ATP production, but also reduces further mitochondrial Ca
uptake via the mitochondrial Ca
 uniporter (MCU), which is dependent on 
MMP (Hansford and Zorov, 1998). This will lead to a gradual reduction in 
mitochondrial Ca
 uptake and a subsequent progressive reduction in the 
efficiency of enzyme activity across the electron transport chain (ETC), leading 
to a progressive decline in ATP production. It may be that during this gradual 
decline, as long as ATP production stays above a threshold, heart function is 
sufficient for survival. However, when ATP production drops below a threshold, 
which may be higher in cardiomyocytes given their high energy requirements, 
ATP production begins to fail and the mouse develops CHF.

Mitophagy was investigated as alterations in mitochondrial morphology can 
alter mitophagy and subsequently lead to energy dysregulation (Chen et al., 
2009, Gomes et al., 2011). One purpose of mitochondrial fission might be to 
segregate parts of the mitochondria that are beyond repair, exposing them for 
mitophagy and recycling of the components. If this process is hindered then 
mitochondria containing mutated mtDNA and depolarized membranes may 
accumulate within a cell, causing mitochondrial dysfunction. No evidence was 
found in this study to suggest that mitophagy is altered nor were specific 
mtDNA deletions identified in Python tissues, though for the latter the method 
used was relatively insensitive. Further investigations may be required to 
clarify the effect of Python on mitophagy, such as experiments to identify single 
base pair mutations or small deletions in the mtDNA genome, and analysis of 
autophagic markers in terminal mice.  
7.3 How dilation might result from energy dysregulation 
Cardiac hypertrophy is a normal physiological process that enables the heart 
to increase in size after birth. Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) is an 
important protein in this process (Lin et al., 1997, Kolodziejczyk et al., 1999), 
while transcription factor GATA-4 is important in myocardial differentiation. 
Pathological consequences occur when hypertrophy increases beyond control 
and as a result cardiac function is diminished. Dilation of the heart results from 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy where cardiomyocyte length increases far more 
than cardiomyocyte width (Fig. 7.1). This is in contrast to hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, where the increase in cardiomyocyte width is greater than 
cardiomyocyte length (Fig. 7.1). It has been proposed that hypertrophic stimuli 
result from energy dysregulation and subsequent higher cytosolic Ca
concentrations.  
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /56*
Figure 7.1. The effect of myocyte hypertrophy. In dilated cardiomyopathy, 
myocytes exhibit hypertrophy with the increase in length being much larger 
than the increase in myocyte width, resulting in thinner walls. In contrast 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results from myocyte hypertrophy when the 
increase in width is larger than the increase in length, leading to much thicker 
walls. LV: left ventricle, RV: right ventricle. 
Python cells were shown to exhibit higher cytoplasmic Ca
 concentrations. 
This is a likely result from two main defects: (i) reduced mitochondrial Ca
uptake as a result of possible decreased tethering between the ER and 
mitochondria and (ii) reduced sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 
(SERCA) activity. Normally, during diastole, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in 
cardiomyoyctes will take up Ca
 from the cytosol via the SERCA. This process 
requires ATP and given that ATP production is impaired as a result of the 
Python mutation, Ca
 re-uptake by the SR will also be reduced, again leading 
to an increased cytosolic Ca
 concentration. As both of these defects will 
progressively become more severe, the cytosolic Ca
 concentration is likely to 
continue to increase.  
 Calcineurin becomes activated by cytosolic Ca
 when bound to the 
adapter protein, calmodulin. Upon activation, calcineurin 
dephosphorylates Nuclear Factor of activated T cells (NFAT), leading to 
translocation to the nucleus (Clipstone and Crabtree, 1992, Okamura et al., 
2000). NFAT is only capable of weak binding to DNA directly, and is, therefore, 
prone to binding to other nuclear transcription factors such as MEF2 and 
"#$%&'()*+,*%#-'+&*+,*-$"*"#$%&'().-%-'+&( /5/*
GATA4 in order to strengthen DNA binding capability (Hogan et al., 2003) 
Activated calcineurin also mediates MEF2 activation. Calcineurin activation is 
therefore regarded as a hypertrophic regulator. The increased cytosolic Ca
concentration in Python cells may increase calcineurin activity and lead to the 
overexpression of prohypertrophic proteins such as NFAT, MEF2 and GATA4, 
leading to uncontrolled hypertrophy of the heart. In Python this hypertrophy 
increases myocyte length far more than width leading to dilation. As the 
cytosolic Ca
 concentration increases with age, expression of prohypertrophic 
proteins might also increase. In the Python mouse, this pathway might lead to 
myocardial dilation, the severity of which increases over time until the heart 
exhibits severe dysfunction and is no longer capable of sufficient contractile 
function. Summary of the possible pathway from Python to dilated 
cardiomyopathy is displayed in Figure 7.2. 
Further investigations are required to deduce what downstream signals 
are altered by increased cytosolic Ca
 concentration in Python cells, but a 
starting point would be to examine the activity of calcineurin,

Figure 7.2. Summary of a possible pathway in which the Python mutation 
leads to DCM.  The Python mutation impairs intramolecular interactions 
possibly leading to increased DNM1L degradation and abrogation of 
interactions with UBC9 and MFF. This leads to reduced translocation/stability 
on the OMM, decreasing oligomerisation, GTPase activity and mitochondrial 
fission. ER-mitochondrial tethering is also impaired leading to defective 
mitochondrial Ca
 uptake and reduced OXPHOS enzyme efficiency, hence 
reduced ATP production. The MMP will also be reduced as a consequence of 
decreased proton pumping by OXPHOS enzymes, which progressively 
reduces the mitochondrial Ca
 uptake leading to a gradual decline in the 
efficiency of OXPHOS. This may lead to a gradual increase in cytosolic Ca
triggering prohypertrophic protein expression via calcineurin-NFAT activation, 
ultimately resulting in DCM.

7.4 DNM1L
 does not appear to ameliorate the symptoms 
of Huntingtons disease in R6/2 mice 
A sideline of the studies on the Python mice was that it might be a model by 
which to investigate a recent theory for the basis of Huntingtons disease (HD). 
Mitochondrial morphology in fibroblasts and lymphocytes of HD patients has 
been shown to exhibit excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. Increased 
DNM1L activity was also found. Mutant HTT is able to bind directly to DNM1L 
and stimulate its translocation to the OMM and subsequent GTPase activity 
(Song et al., 2011). In addition, calcineurin activation was also increased, 
which further triggers DNM1L for translocation via dephosphorylation (Costa et 
al., 2010). In vitro, neuronal cell death can be prevented by the correction of 
the mitochondrial morphology (Song et al., 2011). As a result of these studies, 
it has been postulated that reducing activity of DNM1L in HD patients might 
improve symptoms.  
To test this theory in vivo, the R6/2 mouse model was used. This is an 
extensively characterized model of HD that expresses exon 1 of the human 
HTT gene containing 144 polyQ repeats (Mangiarini et al., 1996). R6/2 male 
mice were mated with Python female mice to create offspring harboring both 
the R6/2 transgene and the Python mutation. DNM1L activity was reduced and 
mitochondrial morphology restored in fibroblasts, however symptoms of HD 
remained as severe in the R6/2 x Python mice as in the R6/2 mice. This may 
imply that mitochondrial morphology is not a cause of HD or that the 
fusion/fission balance was not restored to the appropriate degree. 
Furthermore, fibroblasts were used to examine mitochondrial morphology 
defects and it will be necessary to examine mitochondrial morphology in 
striatal neurons of R6/2 x Python mice as striatal degeneration is a hallmark of

7.5 Future studies on the Python model of DCM 
The work reported in this thesis has provided insight into DNM1L
 protein 
biology and how this leads to energy dysregulation in the heart. Future 
experiments regarding Python as a model of DCM will endeavor to unravel the 
molecular mechanisms by which energy dysregulation leads to dilation of the 
myocardium. Deducing the molecular pathway by which DNM1L participates in 
 regulation might identify novel targets for therapy of DCM and similar 
cardiac disorders.  
It has also been demonstrated that the age of onset of CHF is 
dependent on strain background (Ashrafian et al., 2010). This indicates that 
there are other genetic factors that influence the age of onset of CHF in the 
Python model. Identifying such factors (by QTL analysis) would provide further 
insights into the development of CHF.

Appendix II. Primers for Python genotyping. 
Primers were designed to mutate the cytosine (C) base indicated in yellow to 
an adenine (A) base (also shown in yellow of the primer sequence), thereby 
creating a restriction site for XapI (G^AATTG), but only when the guanine (G) 
highlighted in red is mutated to a thymidine (T), as in Python. The resulting 
fragments after cleavage will be 129bp and 16bp. The wild type Dnm1l 
however will not cleave and remain a single band at 145bp. Therefore Python 
heterozygotes will show all possible fragments. 
Primers: 
PLF 5-d(GCAGAGGATCATTCAGAATT) 3 
PLR 5-d(TGGCATTTCAAATCAGTGTCA) 3 
XapI restriction site: 
5 R^AATTY 3, where R represents an A or a G and Y represents a C or a T.  
Dnm1l exon 11 and intron 12. Primer regions are underlined:

Appendix III. Python genotyping result. 
The restriction product was loaded onto a 4% gel to separate the DNA bands. 
Samples 1-5 are of unknown genotype. These are digested with the XapI 
restriction enzyme along with 3 controls in parallel, analysed on the same gel. 
The first control is the DNA from a known Python heterozygote (+/Py), 
producing DNA fragments at 145bp and 129bp. The second control is the DNA 
of a known wild type (+/+) mouse, which produces one fragment at 145bp. The 
third control is a no template control (NTC), therefore should not contain any 
DNA fragments. The example below can assign samples 3 and 5 as +/Py and 
1,2 and 4 as +/+.  The 16bp band expected in Python samples is too small to 
be visualized on agarose gels.

Appendix IV. pET101 
Wild type Dnm1l and Dnm1l
 were cloned into the pET101 vector creating 2 
separate constructs. The vector contains a his-tag at the C-terminus of Dnm1l, 
allowing purification of the expressed fusion proteins. Purified wild type and 
Python Dnm1l were used to measure GTPase activity and investigate the 
dominant-negative effect of the Python monomer. The Python mutation, 
present at amino acid position 452 is shown indicated on the vector below. The 
vector contains ampicillin (-lactamase) and tetracycline (Taylor et al.) 
resistance genes for selection in bacteria and a pBR322 origin to initiate DNA 
replication.

Appendix V. primers for pyrosequencing 
A 286bp fragment containing Dnm1l exon 11 was amplified by PCR using the 
primers: Dnm1l_11F and Dnm1l_11R Biotin. The reverse primer contains a 
biotin tag to allow for purification of the fragment. The PSQ_Py primer is 
designed in complement to the Dnm1l sequence prior to the site of the Python 
mutation. Pyrosequencing analysis then begins by quantification of allelic 
expression at the mutation site. Red indicates exon 11 of Dnm1l, blue indicates 
the primer sequences and green represents the mutation site. Sequences 
flanking exon 11 are intron boundaries.*

3 pLd11 constructs containing wild type Dnm1l, Dnm1l
 and Dnm1l
separately were used in the HeLa cell transfection. The construct also 
expresses GFP via an IRES from a CMV promoter, in order to identify 
transfected cells through visualization under the green excitation fluorescence 
filter of the microscope. The vector contains neomycin phophotransferase II, 
which allows for selection in bacteria against neomycin and also G418 in

Appendix IX. pDEST32 & pDEST22 vectors 
The ProQuest
 Gateway destination vectors used in a Yeast-2-Hybrid 
experiment were pDEST32, containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and 
pDEST22, containing the GAL4 activation domain. Sequences encoding 
desired proteins or protein regions were cloned into the region between attR1 
and attR2, replacing the fragment in the vectors. Within this fragment ccdB 
gene, which becomes lethal to the cell if expressed. Therefore cells will not 
survive if this part of the plasmid is not replaced with the desired gene. The 
pDEST32 contains the LEU2 gene, which allows for yeast selection in medium 
lacking leucine and the aminoglycosidase N(3)-acetyl transferase I for 
gentamycin resistance (Gm
) in bacteria. Whereas pDEST22 contains the 
TRP1 gene, allowing for yeast selection in medium lacking tryptophan and 
bacterial selection the ampicillin resistance gene (Ap
), -lactamase. 
Transcription is under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter 
(pADH) and termination sequence (TerADH). Both plasmids contain 3 origins 
of replication: ARS4/Cen6 for replication in yeast, pUC origin (ori) for bacterial 
replication and the F1 intergenic region for replication in bacteriophage. 
pDEST32 also possesses the CYH2 gene, conferring sensitivity to 
cycloheximide. pDEST 22 contains a nuclear localization sequence in order to 
tag the fusion protein for import into the nucleus and subsequent transcription.

Appendix X. pAS2-1 and pACT2 vectors  
Matchmaker Gal4 Yeast-Two-Hybrid vectors were used to detect a number of 
reported interactions with DNM1L. pAS2-1 contains the GAL4 DNA binding 
domai, while pACT2 contains the GAL4 activation domain. Selection in yeast is 
achieved by the TRP1 gene in pAS2-1 and LEU2 in pACT2. Both vectors 
contain the -lactamase gene conferring resistance to ampicillin in bacteria. 
Transcription is under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter 
(PADH1) and termination sequence (TADH1). pAS2-1 contains 3 origins of 
replication: 2 micron (2) ori for replication in yeast, Col E1 ori for bacterial 
replication and the F1 intergenic region (f1 ori) for replication in bacteriophage. 
pACT2 lacks that of f1 ori. pAS2-1 also contains the CYH2 gene conferring 
sensitivity to cycloheximide.

been fused to a human Cox VIII sequence to produce a mitochondria-targeted 
vector. The vector also contains an HA tag and is Ampicillin resistant (-
lactamase gene) and neomycin / kanamycin resistant (neomycin

Primers were designed by the Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) in order 
to genotype the presence of the R6/2 transgene. The PCR identifies animals, 
which are positive for the transgene with a 170bp fragment. The wild type 
animals will not possess this size fragment. Analysis of DNA bands was carried 
out on a 3% agarose gel. DNA from a known R6/2 mouse and a known wild

Appendix XIII. Strain specific onset of CHF. 
The onset of  overt CHF symptoms in the Python C3H mice occurs on average 
at 82 days in males and 85 days in females. On the C57BL/6J background, 
mice develop CHF after 168 days on average for males and 166 on average 
for females. The F1 generation represents the offspring from the initial 
backcross of C3H mice to C57BL/6J mice, therefore would be expected to 
develop CHF symptoms at an age between the 2 genetic background. On 
average females of the F1 generation develop CHF at 119 days, while males 
develop it at 108 days.

Abstract
Mutations in a number of genes have been linked to inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, such mutations
account for only a small proportion of the clinical cases emphasising the need for alternative discovery approaches to
uncovering novel pathogenic mutations in hitherto unidentified pathways. Accordingly, as part of a large-scale N-ethyl-N-
nitrosourea mutagenesis screen, we identified a mouse mutant, Python, which develops DCM. We demonstrate that the
Python phenotype is attributable to a dominant fully penetrant mutation in the dynamin-1-like (Dnm1l ) gene, which has
been shown to be critical for mitochondrial fission. The C452F mutation is in a highly conserved region of the M domain of
Dnm1l that alters protein interactions in a yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that the mutation might alter intramolecular
interactions within the Dnm1l monomer. Heterozygous Python fibroblasts exhibit abnormal mitochondria and peroxisomes.
Homozygosity for the mutation results in the death of embryos midway though gestation. Heterozygous Python hearts
show reduced levels of mitochondria enzyme complexes and suffer from cardiac ATP depletion. The resulting energy
deficiency may contribute to cardiomyopathy. This is the first demonstration that a defect in a gene involved in
mitochondrial remodelling can result in cardiomyopathy, showing that the function of this gene is needed for the
maintenance of normal cellular function in a relatively tissue-specific manner. This disease model attests to the importance
of mitochondrial remodelling in the heart; similar defects might underlie human heart muscle disease.

Introduction
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterised by
unexplained left ventricular (LV) cavity enlargement with LV
systolic impairment [1]. DCM is an important cause of congestive
heart failure (CHF) with a prevalence of 36 cases per 100,000 in
the United States [2]. Although the molecular pathways
responsible for DCM remain largely unknown, it is estimated
that between 2050% of DCM cases are familial in nature, the
large majority being inherited as an autosomal dominant trait [3].
Accordingly, the study of single gene disorders that remodel the
heart to cause DCM may provide a valuable opportunity to
identify critical molecules involved in disease pathways [4].
Over the past decade, DCM-causing mutations have been
identified in genes encoding sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, nuclear
envelope, intermediary filament, sarcoplasmic reticulum and
desmosomal proteins. These findings have implicated pathogenic
mechanisms whereby structural integrity, contractile force dy-
namics, and calcium regulation within the cardiomyocyte are
perturbed. Yet such mutations only account for a minority of
DCM cases [5] and many of the genes underlying DCM remain to
be elucidated. A number of gene knockouts in the mouse produce
features of DCM, but these phenotypes are usually recessive and
so do not model the human disease. One approach that has been
applied successfully to the characterisation of new disease alleles is
the use of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis [6]. Treat-
ment of mice with ENU results in a high frequency of
predominantly single point mutations in the mouse germline that
recapitulate the spectrum of mutations observed in many human
genetic diseases. Screening of offspring reveals phenotypic
variants, and the identification of the mutations underlying the
abnormal phenotype can reveal new genetic regulators and novel
pathways associated with disease pathogenesis. Such an approach
is hypothesis neutral, making no prior assumptions about the

nature of the genes or pathways involved. Using this approach we
describe a novel mouse model of DCM in which a mutation in the
Dynamin-1-like gene (Dnm1l) leads to autosomal dominant DCM
and congestive heart failure.
Results
Python mice develop biventricular DCM
The Python mouse was identified on the basis of rapid size
increase, piloerection, and shallow rapid breathing in a visual
screen of adult G1 offspring of ENU-mutagenized BALB/
cAnNCrl males crossed with C3H/HeH females (Figure 1A).
The phenotype was inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion
with complete penetrance in both sexes. The median age of onset
of overt symptoms of CHF on a C3H/HeN genetic background
was 91 days for females and 83 days for males. A similar
phenotype with much later onset occurred on a C57BL/6J
background (median age of onset = 164 days for females, 171 days
for males; Figure 1B) suggesting that strain-specific genetic
modifiers influence disease onset.
The hearts of Python mice were grossly dilated by the time of
overt CHF (Figure 1C). The Python hearts exhibited both biatrial
and biventricular thinning and dilatation consistent with DCM
(Figure 1D). The visible increase in size of Python mice was the
result of substantial ascites and subcutaneous oedema (Figure 1E)
accompanied on occasion by pleural effusion. In the heart,
myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis (Figure 1F) was
evident. Morphometric analysis of MSB-stained sections revealed
that collagenous tissue increased by almost 7-fold in hearts of
terminal Python mice (Figure 1G). Prominent cardiac calcification
was also evident (Figure 1H). Python mice developed CHF under
specified pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, where infectious agents
capable of causing myocarditis were absent. There was no
microscopic evidence of myocarditis, coronary artery disease or
amyloidosis, nor was there hypertrophy of pulmonary blood
vessels that would indicate pulmonary hypertension. MRI analysis
of embryonic hearts did not reveal any obvious anatomical
abnormalities (data not shown). TUNEL staining did not reveal
accelerated apoptosis in late-stage Python hearts (data not shown).
We did observe hepatic congestion at the time of overt CHF,
preceded by increases in the plasma levels of liver enzymes
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (data not
shown), possibly reflecting congestive cardiac hepatopathy sec-
ondary to heart failure.
Cardiac function was analysed in male Python mice on the
C3H/HeN background aged 7178 days, i.e. approximately 2
weeks before overt clinical signs of CHF become evident. The
results are summarised in Table 1. Heart rates in these conscious
mice did not significantly differ between Python mice and controls,
and there were no differences in any measurement of ECG
interval duration (data not shown). However, LV catheterisation
revealed that pressure generation was severely impaired in Python
mice, with LV end-systolic pressure 22 mmHg lower than in
littermate controls, and contractility 40% lower, as measured by
dP/dtmax. This reduction was not due to differences in loading
conditions since dP/dtmax remained impaired after normalisation
to instantaneous pressure. Furthermore, the Python mice had
significantly elevated end-diastolic pressure commensurate with
impaired contractile function. Under conditions of maximal
b-adrenergic stimulation with dobutamine, Python mice had a
reduced contractile reserve and a severely impaired maximum
contractility. Consistent with these findings, aortic blood pressures
were significantly reduced. Relaxation was also impaired in
Python mice with dP/dtmin 46% lower than controls, and
significant prolongation of the isovolumetric constant of relaxation
(Tau), which is less sensitive to loading conditions. These changes
occurred in the absence of LV hypertrophy or dilatation at this
time point and were confirmed at post-mortem by no differences
in LV or RV weights. Although at this stage lung weights were
normal, indicating the absence of significant pulmonary conges-
tion, later, at the time of appearance of overt CHF (approximately
2 weeks later) gross ascites and pulmonary congestion become
rapidly manifest, consistent with the precipitous deterioration in
LV function. No thrombi were observed in the atria, nor, indeed,
in any heart chamber (data not shown). Finally, haematocrits were
normal in all mice (data not shown), ruling out a low red blood cell
count as a mechanism for LV dysfunction.
Positional cloning of the Python mutation
The Python mutation was generated on a BALB/cAnN genetic
background, and the original mouse exhibiting the CHF
phenotype was a BALB/cAnNCrl x C3H/HeH F1 hybrid male.
This individual was backcrossed to C3H/HeH and offspring
exhibiting the CHF phenotype were examined with a panel of 53
polymorphic SNP markers spanning the entire genome at regular
intervals. A strong linkage signal was observed on chromosome 16
at marker D8Mit213 (LOD score of 3.3 for a recombination
fraction= 0.1). Subsequent fine mapping by backcrossing to C3H/
HeH, C3H/HeN and, finally, to C57BL/6J mice narrowed the
critical region containing the mutation to 787 Kb (Figure 2A).
Three genes are located within this region - Pkp2, Fdg4 and Dnm1l.
Sequencing of all exons and exon-intron boundaries identified
only a single mutation in Python mice; a G/C to T/A transversion
in exon 11 of the Dnm1l gene (the official gene name as specified by
the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomen-
clature for Mice but often referred to in the literature as Drp1 or
Dlp1) (Figure 2B). Based on the known ENU-induced mutation
rate for this strain and ENU dose (1 mutation per 1.8 Mb) [7], the
probability of there being an additional intronic or intergenic
mutation anywhere in this region is extremely low (P=0.00001)
[8]. There was complete concordance between animals suffering
from CHF and the Python mutation. We retrospectively
regenotyped 145 DNA samples isolated from C3H and C57BL/
6J Python mice that had suffered from CHF and all contained the
mutation while it was absent in 189 samples from non-affected
littermate control mice. None of the wild types strain examined
(BALB/cAnNCrl, C3H/HeN, C3H/HeH, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J,
CBA/J, 101/H, 129/S5) contained the mutation. Although PKP2
dominant mutations have been associated with arrhythmogenic
right ventricular cardiomyopathy in humans [9] an intronic or
intergenic mutation is unlikely to account for the Python
Author Summary
Heart disease is very common. Some cases of heart disease
are strongly influenced by lifestyle and diet, whereas
others have a strong genetic component. A certain form of
heart failure, known as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
quite often runs in families suggesting that a defective
gene or genes underlie this disease. We describe a new
mouse mutant called Python which suffers from a heart
disease similar to DCM. We were able to pinpoint the
defective gene responsible for the disease. This gene is
normally involved in the division of mitochondria, the
power plants of the cell that generate one of the main
energy supplies for the cell. This is a unique model that
implicates a new gene and mechanism of disease for
further investigation.

phenotype as all human PKP2 mutations found to date occur in
the coding region or splice sites which are not mutated in Python
mice, the homozygous phenotype for the null Pkp2 mutation is
very different from the Python homozygote [10] and Pkp2 mRNA
level is not altered in Python hearts as judged by microarray
analysis (data not shown) suggesting no disease-causing non-coding
regulatory changes. These facts, coupled with the observation that
ENU-induced mutations resulting in detectable phenotypes occur
almost exclusively in the coding exons or exon-intron boundaries
of genes [11], strongly suggested that this base change was the
Python mutation.
The Python mutation results in the replacement of the cysteine
by a phenylalanine at position 452 in the predicted Dnm1l protein
(amino acid numbering according to EBI reference protein
Accession No. Q8K1M6) (Figure 2C). This cysteine is located
within the middle (M) domain of the protein and is fully conserved
in all Dnm1l orthologues, and even the yeast dynamin homologue
DNM1 (Figure 2D). The degree of evolutionary conservation of
the Dnm1l protein is very high. For example, overall homology
between human and mouse Dnm1l is 98%, and between zebrafish
and mouse is 89%. The M domain conservation is even higher
with 96% sequence conservation between mouse and zebrafish
over the 291 amino acids of this domain. The cysteine residue is
also conserved in the M domain of the mouse homologues of
Dnm1, Dnm2 and Dnm3 (Figure 2E) despite overall homology
with these domains being less than 40% (Table S1) suggesting that
this cysteine plays an important role in M domain function.
The Python mutation impairs intramolecular interaction
of Dnm1l
There is no available crystal structure of any mammalian
dynamin proteins but a crystal structure has been described for a
bacterial dynamin-like protein. In this structure the M domain
forms an elongated alpha-helical domain where the tip of the M
domain helices interact with a similar region of the mate in the
dynamin homodimer [12]. Accordingly, a model of mouse Dnm1l
was constructed on the basis of comparative sequence homology to
the bacterial dynamin-like protein BDLP for which there is a
crystal structure [12] and an electron cryomicroscopy reconstruc-
tion of BDLP assembled around a lipid tube [13]. A predicted
structure could be created for most of the protein, apart from one
region where there is no homology in BDLP (indicated by an a in
Figure 3A). The predicted structure of the dimeric asymmetric
repeating unit in the extended confirmation (i.e. after lipid
binding) is shown in Figure 3A.
There are six mutations, all dominant or semi-dominant, that
have been reported in the M of domain of DNM1L or its yeast
homologue DNM1three in yeast [14], and one each in a human

patient [15], a CHO cell line [16], and Python (Figure S1). These
were mapped on to the predicted structure (Figure 3A). The
Python mutation is located in an alpha-helix that is not predicted
to affect interaction between Dnm1l monomers. However, it is
located close to several other helical regions of the domain M.
Furthermore, a helix-wheel projection of the region around the
Python mutation-containing region predicts that one face of the
predicted helix contains principally hydrophobic residues
(Figure 3B). Taken together, these findings are suggestive of this
face being involved in an intramolecular interaction within the
Dnm1l monomer.
To test this further, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay based on
GAL4 DNA binding and activation domain interactions to
examine whether interactions between regions of Dnm1l could
be altered by the Python mutation. We used regions of the protein
that have been used by others in similar assays [1722] and
examined all possible reciprocal interactions of bait (in pDEST32)
and prey (in pDEST22) proteins for regions of Dnm1l: full-length,
N-terminal region, C-terminal region, M domain and GED
(GTPase Effector Domain) (Figure 3C). On the basis of ability to
grow on medium lacking histidine and b-galactosidase activity, the
only strong interactions we identified were interactions between
the full-length proteins, the N terminal and C-terminal regions of
the proteins as reported by Zhu et al. [20], and the N-terminal
region and the GED (Figure 3D). We found that while the Python
mutation had negligible influence on the ability of the full-length
proteins to interact (Figure 3D and 3E), it abrogated the ability of
the N-terminal region to interact with both the C-terminal region
and the GED alone (Figure 3D). Quantitative assays for b-
galactosidase activity confirmed the substantial effect the Python
mutation had on these interactions (Figure 3E).
The Dnm1lPy mutation results in the impairment of
mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics
Given that the Python mutation occurs in a highly conserved
domain of the Dnm1l protein and alters protein interaction in vitro,
its effect on in vivo functions associated with Dnm1l were
examined. Protein levels of Dnm1l were not altered in either
heart or brain (Figure 4A) suggesting that there is no haploinsuffi-
ciency (i.e. the Python protein is assumed to be present). Dnm1l
was distributed diffusely within the cell in both Python and wild
type cultured skin fibroblasts (Figure 4B) suggesting that
introduction of the Python protein did not drastically alter
trafficking of Dnm1l. As Dnm1l function is involved in
mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics, cultured neonatal skin
fibroblasts were examined for morphology of both these
organelles. Mitochondrial morphology was altered. Python
mitochondria were highly elongated compared to wild type
controls (Figure 4C), as were peroxisomes (Figure 4D). To
determine if mitochondrial volume was altered, we utilized a
novel assay where cells were loaded with a fluorescent mitochon-
drial marker and analyzed by flow cytometry. Intensity of
fluorescence should reflect mitochondrial volume in the cell. As
shown in Figure 4E, there was no difference in overall
mitochondrial volume between Python and wild type fibroblasts,
despite the significant changes in mitochondrial shape. This
indicates that the Python mutation affects the in vivo functional
activity of Dnm1l, thereby impairing mitochondrial fission.
Homozygosity for the Python mutation is embryonic
lethal; heterozygosity for Python modifies mitochondrial
structure
To discern the functional effects of the Python mutation, we
intercrossed heterozygotes to obtain homozygous animals. Geno-
typing of embryos demonstrated that no homozygous Python
embryos could be recovered from E12.5 onwards (Figure 5A).
Homozygous embryos appear to be normal up to approximately
E9.5. At E11.5, Py/Py embryos were severely retarded in growth
and exhibited a posterior truncation (Figure 5B). The homozygous
embryonic phenotype is very similar to that recently reported for
the Dnm1l-null mutation [2324]. Embryos die at a similar stage
and their morphology is similar. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts
(MEFs) cultured from homozygous E9.5 embryos survived poorly
in culture. Few cells attached and there was no proliferation
(Figure 5C). Mitochondria of Py/+ MEFs were abnormal with
numerous long tubular mitochondria (Figure 5C), similar to Py/+
skin fibroblasts. In contrast, homozygous Python MEFs had
grossly abnormal mitochondria. Whereas a tubular mitochondrial
network evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm character-
ized mitochondria in +/+ and Py/+ MEFs, some mitochondria of
Py/Py MEFs appeared to be spherical and aggregated (Figure 5C).
This could reflect Dnm1l dysfunction alone though it may reflect a
general dysfunction of these cells. As mentioned earlier, these cells
fail to proliferate. Over several weeks in culture they slowly die.
The nuclei staining with Hoechst 33342 demonstrated evidence of
chromatin condensation in homozygous Python cells (Figure 5C),
suggesting the cells could be dying by necrosis.
The Dnm1lPy mutation results in the impairment of
energy metabolism in the heart
The observation that Python fibroblasts exhibit abnormal
mitochondria coupled with the well-recognized role of DNM1L
in mitochondrial fission [25] and the critical role of mitochondria
in both the normal function and the death of cardiomyocytes [26],
led us to examine the mitochondrial and energetic phenotype of
Python heterozygous mice in greater detail. Aside from the
development of CHF, the Python mice did not exhibit any features
prominently recognized in mitochondrial cytopathies, such as
metabolic, neurological and skeletal muscle defects. They
exhibited a normal general behavioral and functional profile as
defined by the SHIRPA series of tests (Table S2) [27], which
would reveal any major neurological abnormalities. Grip strength
(a reflection of muscle strength) was normal, as was muscle
histology as assessed from H&E-stained sections (data not shown).
Plasma lactate levels, an indicator of general metabolic dysfunc-
tion, were not elevated in Python mice aged 59 weeks compared
to wild type littermate controls (Figure 6A).
Given that the Python phenotype at a gross pathological level
appeared to be restricted to the heart, we examined the
mitochondrial phenotype of Python cardiomyocytes. There was

little evidence of morphological change in Python cardiomyocyte
mitochondria. For example, we examined the nuclear:mitochon-
drial DNA ratio in Python hearts as mtDNA is lost when DNM1L
is down-regulated and mitochondrial fission impaired [28],
However, there was no alteration in the nuclear:mitochondrial
DNA ratio in Python hearts at any stage before the development of
overt CHF and even at this stage only some Python hearts showed
an increased ratio (Figure 6B). This suggests that a major
derangement of nuclear:mitochondrial DNA ratios was not a
generalized effect of the Python mutation.
There was evidence of mitochondrial function changes in hearts
of Python mice suffering from overt CHF. Examination by
enzyme immunohistochemistry for succinate dehydrogenase
(SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) activities revealed
a reduction for both enzymes in Python hearts (Figure 6C). In the
case of SDH there is evidence of diminished myocellular enzyme
activity as indicated by less-intense staining. However for Complex
IV, the enzyme immunohistochemistry suggests that in the failing
heart, the change in Complex IV enzyme levels may be due to the
substantial fibrosis that occurs late in the disease process rather
than a change in enzyme activity. In vitromeasurement of Complex
IV activity and quantity showed that both were proportionately
reduced by similar amounts in ailing Python hearts (Figure 6D),
indicating that the enzyme remains fully active but is less abundant
at 12 weeks of age. This reduction in overall levels at this age most
likely reflects the considerable fibrosis and loss of cells that occurs
in late-stage Python hearts.
Defects in mitochondrial enzyme activity are recognized as a
general phenomenon in CHF [29] and, therefore, the differences
observed in failing Python hearts might be secondary to the
primary cause of heart failure. To determine if the Python
mutation was affecting mitochondrial function prior to major
changes in heart structure, we examined heart samples from
Python and wild type littermates at 10 weeks of age. This is before
there are any overt signs of CHF though the cardiovascular data
above (Table 1) indicates that heart function is abnormal at this
stage. Electron micrographs of heart samples were examined.
Morphometric analysis of the proportional area occupied by
mitochondria (a reflection of overall volume per cell) revealed no
difference between Python hearts and controls (Figure 6E). This in
agreement with the flow cytometry findings in Python skin
fibroblasts (Figure 4E). Nor were myofibre widths significantly
different between Python hearts and controls (data not shown).
There was no evidence of the membrane pinching reported in the
Dnm1l-null mouse fibroblasts [Ishihara2009], nor was there
evidence of large aggregates as has been reported for in vitro
cultured DNM1L mutants [30]. However, the average size of a
mitochondrion was slightly smaller in Python hearts than wild type
hearts (Figure 6E). Smaller cardiomyocyte mitochondria have
been previously reported in some cases of heart failure [3133]. In
the case of Python, if mitochondrial volume is not altered but
mitochondrial tubules are extended in length, then a smaller cross-
sectional transverse area of mitochondria would be consistent with
this.
If Dnm1l affects mitochondrial dynamics, we predicted that the
end point of this would be impairment of respiratory chain
function. Examination of mitochondrial enzyme complex activities
normalized to citrate synthase activity in heart samples from 10-
week-old mice revealed no differences (Figure 6F and 6G). There
was a slight reduction in the overall level of mitochondrial citrate
synthase activity in Python hearts at this age but it was not
statistically significant (Students t test, P=0.11) (Figure 6G) also
suggesting that the total mitochondrial volume in Python hearts
was not reduced. As the end-point of respiratory chain function is
ATP synthesis, and given that down-regulation of DNM1L results
in a reduced rate of ATP synthesis [28,34], myocardial ATP and
total adenine nucleotide (TAN) levels were measured using HPLC.
Python hearts exhibited a dramatic, approximately 50%, reduc-
tion in ATP and TAN levels (Figure 6H and 6I) compared to
hearts from littermate controls. In liver and brain at the same age,
ATP and TAN levels were similar in Python mice and controls
(Figure 6H and 6I), indicating that the defect in ATP generation
was not a general one. These results were confirmed by using
complementary quantitative bioluminescence assays (Figure S2).
A range of metabolites in the heart was examined using high-
resolution
H NMR spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic approaches [35] on
Python and control mice. The metabolite changes identified are
summarized in Table 2. Significant reductions in Python hearts
were noted in mitochondrial metabolic intermediates or accessory
molecules e.g. succinate, malate, fumarate, pyruvate (all associated
with the citric acid cycle), creatine, glucose, AMP and adenosine.
Two notable increases were in the amino acids glycine and
proline. These account for approximately 50% of the amino acids
in collagen, possibly reflecting the fibrosis in Python hearts.
Discussion
We report the identification, through ENU mutagenesis, of a
novel genetic cause of cardiomyopathy. Our principal finding is
that a missense mutation in the middle domain of Dnm1l, whose
product is critically involved in mitochondrial fission, results in
DCM. The resulting defect in mitochondrial remodelling renders
the Python hearts progressively energy deficient potentially
contributing to the phenotype [36].
The fundamental importance of mitochondrial remodelling in
mammalian pathophysiology has been underlined by in utero
lethality and cerebellar degeneration in mice with homozygous

mutations in Dnm1l itself, as well as Mfn1, Mfn2, or Opa1
[23,37,38]. Given the hearts manifest dependency on mitochon-
dria [39] as evidenced by its frequent involvement in mitochon-
drial disorders [40], mitochondrial remodelling defects might be
expected to occur in some forms of myocardial disease. Recently it
has been reported that mitochondria are smaller in failing hearts
and DNM1L protein levels were increased in DCM heart samples
[33] but until now, there has been no direct evidence that genes
involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics might be involved
in heart failure. Python is the first such example.
DNM1L is a member of the dynamin superfamily. In the higher
order spirals formed by dynamin, the basic repeating unit appears
to be a dimer [41]. The association between the GED and M
domains forms a stalk conformation through which strong inter-
molecular interactions of the dimers occur [41]. Mutations in the
M domain have accordingly been shown to adversely affect self-
assembly into a higher order oligomeric structures that are critical
to Dnm1l function [22] and conformational changes within this
region are associated with the constriction of dynamin tubes that
facilitates fission [42]. It is not difficult to envisage how the
substitution of a bulky hydrophobic phenylalanine residue into a
helix-rich region of the M domain (Figure 3A) has the potential to
modify interactions necessary for Dnm1ls effective function. As a
corollary, our yeast two hybrid analysis showed Pythons capacity
to abrogate Dnm1ls N-terminal region interacting with the C-
terminal region (and GED), while leaving the interaction between
Dnm1l monomers unaffected. A similar effect was reported when
the S637D mutation was introduced into Dnm1l [43]. This effect
of the mutation on Dnm1l higher order structure is consistent with
a dominant-negative mode of action. Since there appears to be no
change in overall Dnm1l protein levels, we propose that the
Python monomer is readily incorporated into dimers with the wild
type protein but fails to function effectively within that dimer due
to defective intramolecular interactions. If this model is accurate,
only 1 in 4 Dnm1l dimers might be expected to be fully functional.
This study cannot exclude a systemic (i.e. non-cardiac) impact of
the C452F mutation, though from a clinical perspective, most
tissues and organ functions appeared to be grossly spared. The
liver was the one organ that did show evidence of extra-cardiac
involvement but this might reflect congestive cardiac hepatopathy
caused by heart disease. The predominant cardiac phenotype in
the Python heterozygotes contrasts with the marked skeletal
muscle and metabolic abnormalities in the infant with a dominant
mutation in DNM1L [15]. It is unclear why the Python mutation
manifests an overt phenotype only in heart. The reported human
mutation in domain M, a dominantly acting alanine to aspartic
acid mutation, appears to be much more severe than the Python
mutation appeared to have a widespread metabolic defect. This
may be related to the location of the amino acid within the
structure and/or the chemical nature of the amino acid
substitutions involved. An inter-species difference in DNM1l
functionality is possible but unlikely given the extremely high
degree of inter-species conservation. All 7 mutations identified in
the M domain that affect mitochondrial dynamics are conserved
not only in the M domain of DNM1L orthologues across multiple
species (Figure S1), but are also conserved across the M domain of
DNM1, DNM2, DNM3 and DNM1L (Figure 2E). The human
alanine to aspartate mutation occurs in a region of the protein that
might interact with the membrane (Figure 3A). When overall
compatibility of the amino acid replacements are compared the
Python amino acid replacement scores significantly higher in
compatibility with its original amino acid in terms of hydropho-
bicity, size and charge compatibility (15.8, 9.4, 18.17 for the
Python mutation compared to 12.8, 8.6 and 12.82 for the A400D
human DNM1L mutation) [44]. Given that there is no evidence
that this cysteine is involved in disulphide bonding in DNM1L,
and its effect in the yeast two-hybrid system on intramolecular but
not intermolecular Dnm1l interactions, its effect on Dnm1l
function may be relative mild, still enabling the formation of
dimers but with reduced functionality.
Although the gross impact of the heterozygous C452F Dnm1l
mutation on cardiac morphology was relatively subtle at ,70
days, the corresponding functional and, even more so, the
biochemical phenotypes were apparent. This was reflected in
uniform lethality shortly thereafter. The degree of ATP deficiency
in the Python hearts at this age is, to the best of our knowledge,
unprecedented. The apparent fall of ATP levels to 44% of wild
type levels in hearts from 10-week-old mice (15.1 vs. 6.6 nmol
ATP/mg/protein in +/+ and Py/+ hearts at 10 weeks of age
confirmed by two independent means) may have been exaggerated
by increased fibrosis, yet still seems beyond the range by which it is
thought that cardiac [ATP] is allowed to diminish (,25% to 30%)
even in CHF [39]. We used an exacting method involving HPLC
to measure these levels to ensure they were as accurate as possible.
However a major caveat to these observations, is that the degree of
difference in ATP levels observed herein will inevitably be
exaggerated by the technical limitations associated with measuring
ATP levels in tissue samples after excision from the body. The
resulting rapid depletion of ATP pools may have precluded
accurate measurements. However, a difference in ATP levels
between Python and control hearts (that is not found in liver and
brains) may indicate that the Python mutation does espouse an
aberrant and progressive impact on myocardial energetics.
One possible explanation for the Dnm1l-mediated cardiomy-
opathy is cardiac energy deficiency. It is recognized that CHF is
associated with, and in many cases exacerbated by, cardiac energy
deficiency [36,39,45,46]. Indeed, the commonality of CHF to
numerous primary mitochondrial diseases represents an excellent
source of evidence that primary energy deficiency can and does
cause CHF [36,47]. As reduction of Dnm1l function is known to
impair cellular energetics [28,34] and as this pattern of cellular
energetic impairment is profoundly and progressively manifested
in Python hearts even in advance of gross cardiac dysfunction,
cardiac energy deficiency may contribute to the phenotype of
Python hearts and may be the proximate cause.
Detailed questions remain regarding the impact of the C452F
substitution. Further biochemical and cellular studies are needed
to investigate the hypothesis that such M domain mutations alter
the intra/inter-molecular interactions and alter the homo-
oligomerisation properties of Dnm1l [48]. Such studies will have
to explain why in the context of the subtle reticular mitochondrial
changes in Python, there is a discrepancy between the lack of an

overall decrease in mitochondrial volume or function and the
degree of ATP depletion. There are a number of other metabolic
and cellular processes that could be altered by the Python
mutation. Calcium cycling, for example, is altered in cells lacking
the mitochondrial fission protein Mitofusin 2, reflecting its role in
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tethering [49]. Inhibi-
tion of Dnm1l alters ER structure [50], though we could find no
alteration in the morphological appearance of the ER in Python
fibroblasts (data not shown). Nevertheless, further investigation of
uptake into mitochondria and release from ER is warranted.
An energy defect not reflected in altered respiratory complex
enzyme activity might also result from other disturbances such as
uncoupling of electron transport and ATP production, perturba-
tion of supercomplexes [51], cell cycling [52] organelle quality
control through autophagy, or generation of reactive oxygen
species [28]. It is possible that Python has effects on Dnm1l
function, unrelated to mitochondrial dynamics.
The tissue specificity of the Python defect warrants further
investigation. This may reflect unique properties of cardiomyo-
cytes, their mitochondria, or a unique role for Dnm1l in
cardiomyocytes. For example, a role for DNM1L in the heart
has been inferred by Ong et al. who observed that mitochondrial
fission protects the heart against ischemia/reperfusion [53]. One
strategy to address this question would be to effect conditional
inactivation of Dnm1l in cardiomyocytes, in a similar manner to
mitochondrial fusion factor elimination in skeletal muscle [54]. In
conclusion, we report the first model of mitochondrial remodeling
to be associated with cardiomyopathy. It is likely that the C452F
substitution in the M domain of Dnm1l alters the balance of
mitochondrial fission and fusion. The impairments in mitochon-
drial remodeling and function result in a relatively tissue specific
disease as manifested by rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy. It is
plausible that mutations in Dnm1l that are similarly subtle and
hence do not represent a barrier to viability, will be identified and
prove to be of importance in human disease.
Materials And Methods
Mice were maintained in high health status facilities with access
to food and water ad libidum. All work was approved by the Animal
Ethical Review Committees of MRC Harwell, University of
Sheffield and University of Leeds, and the UK Home Office, and
conducted with the highest quality of animal care and in
accordance with the 3Rs.
ENU mutagenesis
Adult BALB/cAnNCrl mice aged 10 weeks were mutagenized
by intraperitoneal injection of two weekly doses of 100 mg/kg
ENU, mated with C3H/HeH and F1 offspring screened for
abnormalities. Python mice were further backcrossed to C3H/
HeN and C57BL/6J. All tissue samples used for metabolic and
cellular analysis were derived from a line generated by inbreeding
of an N1l backcross to C3H/HeN.
Genetic mapping
Genome-wide low-resolution mapping was performed using
DNA samples from 15 N2 C3H/HeH backcross animals that were
identified as carriers based on the development of congestive heart
failure. Genomic DNA samples isolated from tail biopsies of these
animals were screened by PCR amplification and gel electropho-
resis with 53 microsatellite markers spaced at regular intervals
across the genome. Samples were genotyped as either homozygous
C3H or heterozygous BALB/c-C3H for each marker. For finer
mapping, crosses of Python mice with both C3H and C57BL/6J
were used, and further microsatellite markers polymorphic
between either BALB/c and C3H or BALB/c and C57BL/6J
were used to identify Python mice that were recombinant in the
critical region. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
genotyped by sequencing of PCR products amplified with primers
flanking the SNP site. Sequencing of candidate genes involved
designing primer pairs to amplify individual exons as well as
flanking splice donor/acceptor sequences. All exons and splice
sites in the critical region were sequenced using homozygous as
well as heterozygous Python DNA, ensuring that no base changes
were missed.
Measurement of blood lactate
A small drop of blood was obtained from the lateral tail vein
and processed using a Lactate Pro analyzer (HabDirect, Southam,
Histology and TEM
Tissues for light microscopy were emersion fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and wax-embedded 3 mm sections were stained
with haematoxylin and eosin or Mauritius Scarlet Blue (MSB).
Mice were perfusion fixed for TEM. In situ staining for succinate
dehydrogenase and Complex IV activities were a previously
described [47,55,56].
In vivo cardiac phenotyping
Conscious ECG measurements were obtained in unrestrained
male Python mice and littermate controls (n = 6 of each) at 10
weeks of age using the non-invasive AnonyMOUSE ECG
screening tool (Mouse Specifics Inc). One week after, at 7562
days of age, the same mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane and
placed on a homeothermic blanket. Parasternal short- and long-
axis views were obtained under 1.25% isoflurane anaesthesia
using an Agilent Sonos 5500 with 15 MHz transducer. The LV
was cannulated via the right carotid artery with a 1.4F Mikro-tip
conductance cannula (SPR-839, Millar Instruments). The
superior vena cava was cannulated with a second 1.4F Millar
cannula (SPR-671) to measure central venous pressure. Mice
were allowed at least 15 minutes equilibration before baseline
aortic and ventricular pressure measurements were obtained.
Dobutamine was given by intraperitoneal injection (1.5 mg/g
body weight) and pressure measurements obtained under
maximal b-adrenergic stimulation. Mice were then killed by
cervical dislocation and organs washed in heparinised saline,
blotted and weighed. Two experiments were performed daily,
alternating between genotypes for morning and afternoon
experiments.
Enzymatic assays
All activities were determined at 30uC. Prior to analysis cells
were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing to lyse

Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments Ltd,
Watford, UK). Complex I activity was measured according to
the method of Ragan et al. [57]. Complex II-III activity was
measured according to the method of King [58]. Complex IV
activity was measured according to the method of Wharton and
Tzagoloff [59]. Citrate synthase (CS; EC 1.1.1.27) activity was
determined by the method of Shepherd and Garland [60].
Enzyme activities were expressed as a ratio to citrate synthase to
compensate for mitochondrial enrichment in cell samples [61].
Measurement of Complex IV activity and quantity in terminal
heart samples used a Complex IV Mouse Duplexing (Activity +

NMR and mass spectroscopy
Tissues were extracted using a methanol: chloroform: water
extraction procedure to separate aqueous soluble metabolites from
lipids as previously described [62]. Briefly, ,100 mg tissue were
pulverised with dry ice. 600 ml methanol: chloroform (2:1) was
added and the samples were sonicated for 15 min. Water and
chloroform were added (200 ml of each). The resulting aqueous
and organic layers were separated from the protein pellet. The
organic layer was dried overnight in a fume hood whilst the
aqueous extracts were evaporated to dryness using an evacuated
centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
NMR spectroscopy. The aqueous extracts were rehydrated
in 600 ml D2O, buffered in 0.24 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)
containing 1 mM (sodium-3-(tri-methylsilyl)-2, 2, 3, 3-
tetradeuteriopropionate (TSP) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories
Inc., Andover, MA, USA). The samples were analysed using an
AVANCE II+ NMR spectrometer operating at 500.3 MHz for the
H frequency (Bruker Gmbh, Germany) using a 5 mm ATMA
TXI probe. Spectra were collected using a solvent suppression
pulse sequence to saturate the residual
H water proton signal
(noesypr1d pulse sequence; relaxation delay = 2 s, t1 = 3 ms,
mixing time= 150 ms, solvent presaturation applied during the
relaxation time and the mixing time). 128 transients were collected
into 16 K data points over a spectral width of 12 ppm at 27uC.
GC-MS. Aqueous samples were derivatised using the
procedure reported [63]. 150 ml of the D2O sample used for
NMR spectroscopy was evaporated to dryness in an evacuated
centrifuge and 30 ml methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg ml21 in
pyridine) was added. The samples were vortex mixed for 1 minute,
and derivatised at room temperature for 17 hours. Samples were
then silylated with 30 ml of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltri-
fluoroacetamide (MSTFA) for 1 hour at room temperature. The
derivatised samples were diluted (1:10) with hexane prior to GC-
MS analysis. Organic phase metabolites were derivatised by acid
catalyzed esterification [64]. Lipids were dissolved in 0.25 ml of
chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v). 0.10 ml BF3/methanol (Sigma-
Aldrich) was added and the vials were incubated at 80uC for 90
minutes. Once cool 0.3 ml H2O (mQ) and 0.6 ml hexane was
added and each vial vortex mixed for one minute. The aqueous
layer was discarded and the remaining organic layer was
evaporated to dryness before reconstitution in 200 ml hexane for
analysis. The derivatised aqueous samples were injected into a
Thermo Electron Trace GC Ultra equipped with a
30 m60.25 mm ID 5% phenyl polysilphenylene- siloxane
column with a chemically bonded 25 mm TR-5MS stationary
phase (Thermo Electron Corporation; Injector temper-
ature = 220uC, helium carrier gas flow rate = 1.2 ml min21). The
initial column temperature was 70uC; this was held for 2 min then
increased by 5uC min21 to 310uC and was held for 20 min. The
derivatised organic metabolites were injected onto a ZB-WAX
column (30 m60.25 mm ID60.25 mm df; 100% polyethylene
glycol). The initial column temperature was 60uC; this was held for
2 min then increased by 10uC min21 to 150uC and then by 4uC
up to a temperature of 230uC where it was held for 7 min.
The column eluent was introduced into a DSQ quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation) (transfer line
temperature = 310uC for aqueous metabolites and 240uC for
lipid metabolites, ion source temperature = 250uC, electron
beam=70 eV). The detector was turned on after a solvent delay
of 240 s and data was collected in full scan mode using 3 scans s
across a mass range of 50650 m/z.
Data Analysis. NMR spectra were processed using ACD
SpecManager 1D NMR processor (version 8, ACD, Toronto,
Canada). Spectra were Fourier transformed following
multiplication by a line broadening of 1 Hz, and referenced to
TSP at 0.0 ppm. Spectra were phased and baseline corrected
manually. Each spectrum was integrated using 0.04 ppm. integral
regions between 0.54.5, and 5.110.0 ppm. To account for any
difference in concentration between samples each spectral region
was normalised to a total integral value of 10000. GC-MS
chromatograms were analysed using Xcalibur, (v. 2.0, Thermo
Fisher Corp), integrating each peak individually. Peaks were
normalised so that the total sum of peaks was set to 10000.

A Mutation in Dnm1l Leads to Heart Failure

Deconvolution of overlapping peaks was achieved by generating
traces of selected ions. A 0.1 minute threshold window was used
for the deviation of peaks away from the predicted retention time
across the data set. Structures were assigned using both the NIST
database of mass spectra and analysis of standard compounds.
Datasets were imported into SIMCA-P 10.0 (Umetrics, Umea,
Sweden) for processing using PCA, PLS (Partial least squares, a
regression extension of PCA used to separate out a trend from
other variation in the data set) and PLS-DA (a regression extension
of PCA used for classification). Identification of major metabolic
perturbations within the pattern recognition models was achieved
by analysis of corresponding loadings plots. Additionally, R
were used as measures for the robustness of a pattern
recognition model. R
is the fraction of variance explained by a
component, and cross validation of R
gives Q
which reveals the
fraction of the total variation predicted by a component. Both
values are indicative of how good the overall model is. Typically a
robust model has R
2.0.50 and Q2.0.40. Coefficient scores rank
the observations according to their contribution to the model. In
order to confirm which metabolites contributed significantly to
each model, each variable was assessed by a jack-knifing routine to
assess its contribution to a given component. Only variables
deemed to have a coefficient significantly different from zero were
included.
Quantification of mtDNA and 18S rRNA by Q-PCR
100,000 cells were resuspended in 100 ml extraction solution
(0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.2% SDS and 5 mM EDTA in PBS)
and incubated at 50uC for 3 h. Total DNA was then precipitated
by addition of 10 ml of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 110 ml
isopropanol and incubation for 20 minutes on ice before
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4uC. The DNA-pellet was
washed once with cold 70% ethanol, air dried for 15 min and
resuspended in 100 ml TE buffer at 4uC overnight. Realtime
PCR amplification was performed on 10 ng of total DNA using a
iCycler (Bio Rad) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad)
following the manufacturers instructions. A 211 bp fragment of
the mtDNA 12S RNA gene was amplified between nucleotide
1095 and nucleotide 1305 (Forward primer: 59 GCTCGCCA-
GAACACTACGAG 39, reverse primer: 59 CAGGGTTTGCT-
GAAGATGGCG 39). Elongation translation factor 1 gene
(EEF1A1) was used as an endogenous reference across all
experimental conditions (Forward primer: 59 GGATTGCCA-
CACGGCTCACATT 39, reverse primer: 59 GGTGGA-
TAGTCTGAGAAGCTCTC 39).
Yeast two-hybrid analysis
Regions of Dnm1l were amplified from a mouse IMAGE cDNA
clone plasmid and cloned into the vectors pDEST22 (prey) and
pDEST32 (bait) (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) according to the
manufacturers instructions. The two hybrid tests were performed
in the yeast strain MaV203, which contains a HIS3 promoter
driving expression of HIS3 and a GAL1 promoter to drive
expression of LACZ as chromosomally integrated reporter genes.
Interactions were initially tested by plating on yeast dropout
medium agar without leucine, tryptophan and histidine and with
increasing amounts of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (10, 25, 50 and
100 mM). Interactions were then further tested using a semi-
quantitative b-glactosidase filter lift assay followed by a quantita-
tive b-galactosidase liquid culture assay according to the Pro-Quest
instruction manual (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK).
Isolation of embryonic fibroblasts
For skin fibroblasts, 24-day-old pups were humanely culled,
and a portion of the skin removed, washed in PBS and finely
minced using a razor blade. A small piece of tissue was retained for
genotyping purposes. Numerous small segments of tissue approx-
imately 1 mm
were placed well spaced on 10 cm Petri dishes and
allowed to air dry for 10 minutes, DMEM containing Glutamax
and 10% FCS (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) was then carefully
added to the dish so as to avoid dislodging the tissue pieces. Plates
were cultured for 7 days at 37uC, 5% CO2, then outgrowing cells
were harvested with trypsin and passaged in the same medium.
For embryonic fibroblasts, embryos were dissected from the uterus
and the yolk sacs were removed for use in genotyping the embryos.
The embryos were placed in 50 ml 0.05% trypsin and macerated
using a 20 ml disposable pipette tip. After incubation for 15
minutes at 37uC, the cells were counted and plated in one well of a
6-well plate in DMEM containing Glutamax and 10% FCS and
cultured at 37uC, 5% CO2.

Labeling of mitochondria in fibroblasts
For microscopy, fibroblasts were cultured on glass coverslips in
50200 nM Mitotracker Orange CM-H2TMRos in DMEM
containing Glutamax and 10% FCS for 45 minutes at 37uC.
Cells were washed in PBS, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 minutes at room temperature. Cover slips were mounted on
glass slides in a drop of ProLong Gold mounting medium
(Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) containing 10 mg/mL Hoechst
33258. For FACS analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization,
washed with PBS, then fixed for 20 minutes at 4uC in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Cells were subsequently centrifuged and
resuspended in PBS.
Western blot analysis
Brain and heart samples from 5-week-old mice were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen then homogenized in RIPA (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS) containing 16 protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340;
Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK). Equal amounts of protein were
separated by Laemmli stacking/separating SDS PAGE and
blotted to Hybond-P (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), then
individual proteins were detected using antibodies to Drp1 (Clone
8; BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), Tim23 (Clone 32; BD
Biosciences, Oxford, UK), and a-tubulin (T6074; Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK). An anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (7076;
Cell Signaling, NEB, Hitchin, UK), was used for detection in
combination with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).
Immunocytochemistry
For peroxisome labeling, a primary rabbit anti-catalase IgG
(ab16731, Abcam) was used with a goat anti-rabbit FITC-
conjugated IgG (ab6717, Abcam). For examining Dnm1l
distribution in fibroblasts, an anti-Drp1 primary antibody (Clone
8; BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) with a Daylight549-conjugated
anti-mouse Ig was used.
Fluorescent imaging
All images were taken on a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 microscope
using Axiovision Release 4.7.2 software. For imaging mitochon-
dria with Mitotracker Orange and Dnm1l using a Daylight549-
labelled secondary antibody, a filter with excitation 530585 nm,
emission 600660 nm was used. For Imaging peroxisomes with a
FITC-labeled secondary antibody, a filter with an excitation of
450490 nm, emission 510560 nm was used. For FACS
analysis, cells were incubated in 200 nM Mitotracker Orange
CM-H2TMRos in DMEM containing Glutamax and 10% FCS
for 45 minutes at 37uC, harvested using trypsin, washed with PBS
and fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes
at 4oC. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS
containing 1% FCS and analyzed for fluorescence on a
CyAnADP O2 flow cytometer (Dako). The gate for Mitotracker
Orange-positive cells was set using control cells that were not
labelled.
ATP and total adenine nucleotide pool measurements
Hearts were excised, washed in heparinised normal saline,
blotted and weighed, before being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at 280uC. Total adenine nucleotide (TAN) content
and myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured by
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) as previously
described [65]. For the purpose of calculating activity per mg of
protein, the Lowry method was used.
Homology modelling
The structure of the human DNMlL protein (Uniprot [66]
accession number O00429) was predicted by homology modelling
as follows. The structure of the bacterial dynamin-like protein
BDLP [13] (PDB [67] identification code 2w6d) was used as
template. Given the low sequence identity (around 12%), the
alignment between target sequence and template was performed
using a profile-to-profile alignment method implemented in the
FFAS03 server [68] (http://ffas.ljcrf.edu). Profile-to-profile align-
ments are superior in terms of sensitivity and alignment quality
compared to traditional pair wise alignments (and in particular at
low sequence identity). The FFAS03 score for the alignment was
233.5 implying significant similarity (FFAS03 scores below 29.5
reported less than 3% false positive under benchmarking
conditions [68]). The alignment was manually inspected and the
structural model was derived using MODELLER [69] as
previously described [70]. Structure representations were prepared
using the molecular visualization program PyMOL (http://www.
pymol.org).
Software and databases
DNA sequence alignments for detecting mutations were
performed using DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI).
Protein alignments were performed using CLUSTALW2 and
ALIGN software available online from the European Bioinfor-
matics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk). Prism software (GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used throughout for statistical
analysis. Morphometric analysis used ImageJ [71]. For measure-
ment of mitochondrial area and size, contrast of micrographs was
enhanced by 0.5%. After setting the scale, the threshold was
altered such that only mitochondria were marked. The thre-
sholded image was then analyzed for area, and area fraction for
particles greater than 50 pixels. For measurement of area stained
in MSB sections, the image type was set to RGB stack and the
threshold set to detect areas positive for collagen. The thresholded
image was then analyzed for area above threshold.
