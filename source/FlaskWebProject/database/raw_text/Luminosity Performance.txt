Thesis title: Luminosity Performance Limitations Due To The Beam-
Beam Interaction In The Large Hadron Collider
In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physics events are created by col-
liding high energy proton beams at a number of interaction points around the
ring. One of the main performance indicating parameters of the LHC is the lu-
minosity. The luminosity is limited by, amongst other things, the strength of the
beam-beam interaction. In this thesis, the effect of the beam-beam interaction
on the luminosity performance of the LHC and the proposed High Luminosity
Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is investigated. Results from a number of ded-
icated, long-range beam-beam machine studies are presented and analysed. In
these studies, the minimum beam-beam separation for two different  optics
are identified. This separation defines the minimum operational crossing angle
in the LHC. The data from these studies are then compared to simulation of the
dynamic aperture and the results are discussed. In addition to studies of the
LHC, an analytical approach is derived in order to describe the hourglass effect,
which may become a contributing factor in limiting the luminosity performance
of the HL-LHC.

Introduction
1.1 Outline and Motivation
In a colliding storage ring like the LHC, luminosity is a key measure of the overall
machine performance. To ensure the maximum efficiency during collisions, losses
due to various beam dynamics processes should be minimised, such that particles
are only lost due to collisions with counter rotating bunches. One effect that is
unavoidable in the LHC and is known to cause additional losses is the beam-
beam interaction. At each collision point the bunches will experience the electric
field of the counter rotating bunch. The interaction between two counter rotating
beams can be strong and hence dictate the choice of operation parameters for the
machine. Understanding the beam-beam interaction and its effects are vital to
maximise the luminosity performance in the LHC and push the luminosity reach
for future machines. The impact of the beam-beam interaction on the luminosity
performance in the LHC is the topic of this thesis. A brief summary of the thesis
is given in the following section.
Chapter 1: Introduction 21
1.2 Thesis Summary
This thesis contains research conducted throughout a 4 year period with 9 months
of that spent on long-term attachment at CERN. It consists of three introduc-
tory chapters and three main research chapters, followed by a brief summary. The
aim of this thesis was to identify and quantify the impact of beam-beam effects
on the luminosity performance of the LHC. The luminosity is a key parameter
which defines the performance of the machine. It is therefore important to un-
derstand these effects, and the impact they have on the luminosity. Chapters 2
and 3 introduce the general concepts of accelerator physics which are related to
this thesis. Within these chapters, elements of beam dynamics, the beam-beam
interaction and the CERN accelerator complex are introduced. The chapters
following these introductions, contain research undertaken during this PhD and
provides the main topic of this thesis, which is the performance limitations of the
luminosity due to beam-beam effects. The work in this thesis can be summarised
as follows;
 Chapter 4 contains work detailing an alternative method of obtaining ana-
lytical expressions for the electric field in the rest frame of the bunch, whilst
including a non-Gaussian charge density distribution. In the HL-LHC, the
particular choice of operational parameters such as , will result in a cou-
pling between the transverse bunch size to the longitudinal position. This
is known as the hourglass effect. The hourglass effect can limit luminosity
performance because the particles may not collide at the minimum . In
order to study the luminosity performance, accurate models of the hour-
glass effect are required. Currently no analytical formula exists to describe
this effect. As a result, computationally expensive multi-particle simula-
tions are required. This chapter provides a method of obtaining analytical
solutions to describe the hourglass effect. The theory is used to re-derive
Chapter 1: Introduction 22
electric field for a fixed Gaussian distribution and is then applied to the
case the hourglass effect is present. The derived expressions are discussed
and compared to the known round bunch expression.
 Chapter 5 presents experimental work that was collected during the 2015
and 2016 LHC runs. This chapter details two long-range beam-beam ma-
chine studies. These studies were performed to determine the maximum
luminosity reach as defined by the long-range beam-beam interactions in
the LHC for two optic set ups. From these studies, the minimum crossing
angle was identified for a  = 0.8 m and  = 0.4 m. The minimum opera-
tional crossing angle was identified at  = 260 rad during the 2016 study.
For crossing angles smaller than this value, the long-range beam-beam in-
teraction reduces the beam and luminosity lifetimes. Identifying the limit
before additional beam losses occurred allowed the operational crossing an-
gle to be reduced during luminosity production runs. The crossing angle
was reduced to  = 280 rad. Operating at this reduced crossing angle will
improve the luminosity performance of the LHC by approximately 1015%.
 In chapter 6, the results from the 2016 long-range beam-beam machine
study were compared to dynamic aperture simulations performed in Sixtrack.
This chapter introduces and discusses the topic of dynamic aperture in ac-
celerator physics and its relationship to the beam lifetimes. A method
of calculating the dynamic aperture from measured intensity loss is dis-
cussed, before the measured data is compared to tracking simulations. The
dynamic aperture is simulated for every crossing angle step during the long-
range beam-beam machine study, as discussed in chapter 5. The impact
of magnetic errors, linear coupling and the beam-beam interaction the dy-
namic aperture is evaluated. These studies show that the magnetic errors
play a important role in defining the dynamic aperture and hence the choice
of operational parameters for the LHC and future machines.

Finally, a summary chapter is provided overviewing the main findings of this
thesis.

Beam Dynamics
2.1 Single Particle Dynamics
Beam dynamics concerns the behaviour of charged particles in an accelerator.
Providing an accurate description of the beam dynamics is a vital requirement
of any machine to ensure that design, operation, machine performance, and pro-
tection goals are all achieved. Before collective effects can be considered a brief
overview of single particle dynamics are introduced in this chapter. The trans-
verse beam dynamics are primarily a concern in the LHC as the bunches are
relativistic. These are discussed and reviewed in the following chapter.
2.1.1 Maxwells Equations
The dynamics of charged particles moving within an electromagnetic field is de-
scribed by Maxwells equations [1, 2]. Maxwells equations in differential form
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 25
are given by the following set of coupled partial differential equations;
  E =
, (2.1)
  E = tB, (2.2)
  B = 0, (2.3)
  B = 0j + 00tE, (2.4)
where 0 and 0 are the magnetic and electric permeability in free space, E and
B are the electric and magnetic fields respectively, j is the current density and 
is the charge density distribution.
Since Maxwells equations are a system of coupled partial differential equations,
analytic solutions can often be difficult to find and depend on the boundary
conditions of the system. Maxwells equations can be used to describe both the
single particle behaviour as well as the collective behaviour of many particles. The
behaviour of many particles in a bunch are difficult to model and would require
extensive computational simulation in order to calculate the electric fields of all
of the particles. The problem can be simplified by considering the bunch as an
ensemble and transforming to the rest frame of the bunch. This reduces the
number of equations that need to be solved, since the magnetic field can be set
to zero under fixed time, t = 0. In this case, Maxwells equations reduce to
  E =
, (2.5)
  E = 0. (2.6)
Written in terms of the scalar potential , where the charge density distribution
 describes the distribution of the particles in the bunch results in Poissons
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 26
equation,
2 =
. (2.7)
From the scalar potential or the electric field of the bunch, the dynamics of the
interaction with other particles can be calculated.
The understanding of a number of the key concepts of single particle dynamics in
a colliding beam storage ring like the LHC will allow more complicated collective
effects like the beam-beam interaction to be described.
2.1.2 Transverse Dynamics
In a colliding beam storage ring like the LHC, the beam dynamics are dominated
by the transverse motion of particles, since the beam energy is sufficiently large,
the bunches travel close to the speed of light. The transverse motion of a particle
inside a bunch is complicated and can be non-linear in nature [3].
2.1.2.1 Linear Dynamics and Hills Equations
An accelerator like the LHC contains different types of magnets which are ar-
ranged in such a way, as to ensure that a beam of charge particles will pass
through, and survive for many turns. The particular layout of these magnets
around the whole ring is known as a lattice. For periodic particle motion around
an accelerator lattice, the transverse linearised equation of motion can be de-
scribed in terms of the spatial components x, y and x, y, which represent the
angle from the transverse spatial plane. The coordinate space (x, x, y, y) is
known as trace space. Later in the chapter the concept of phase space will be
introduced which is a coordinate space in (x, px, y, py). In phase space the co-
ordinates px,y are used and these are the momentum components in the x or y
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 27
plane. The coordinates x, y and px, py are related through.
px = m0crx
, (2.8)
with a similar expression in y. Here r =
, where v is the particle speed,  is
the relativistic factor, and m0 is the rest mass of the particle. In the absence of
any coupled motion Hills equations [4] are given by
x + x(s)x = 0, (2.9)
y + y(s)y = 0. (2.10)
Where x,y is a an arbitrary function that depends on the longitudinal position
s. These equations can be solved using the ansatz that includes an s-dependent
amplitude and phase as given by [4, 5],
x(s) =
(s) cos((s) + 0), (2.11)
where the phase advance through the lattice is (s),  is the -function, and 
and 0 are constants of integration. A similar equation will be given in terms of
y. If the machine has a circumference of length L, the -function in the x or y
plane will have the periodic condition
(s) = (s+ L).
Differentiating the ansatz given by equation 2.11 and requiring that the trigono-
metric terms vanish result in two conditions that must be satisfied. These con-
ditions are
 
 2
2 + 2 = 0, (2.12)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 28
= 0. (2.13)
Integrating the second condition since
= (
shows that 
must be constant. Hence the relationship between the phase
advance (s) and the -function is given by
(s) =
ds. (2.14)
In addition to the phase advance, the -function can be related to the machine
tune. The tune is defined as the total number of transverse particle oscillations
around the reference trajectory per revolution. The tune is related to the -
function by
Qx,y =
ds. (2.15)
Using the condition that the derivative of the -function and the phase advance
) is constant and substituting back into equation 2.12, yields a new differen-
tial equation in  only. The equation is
2 + 2 = 1. (2.16)
Introducing  = 1
and  =
(1+2)
gives
+ 2  2 = 0, (2.17)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 29
which can be simplified to
 + 2 = 0. (2.18)
These parameters ,  and  and their relationship to the coordinate s yields
the Courant-Snyder invariant [4, 5]. In the horizontal plane, the Courant-Synder
invariant is
2 + 2xx  x + xx
2 = x. (2.19)
The parameters x, x and x have an important physical interpretation for ac-
celerator physics; they correspond to particle motion and introduce the topic of
betatron motion and the single particle emittance. The single particle emittance
is related to the single particle action by
2Jx,y = x,y. (2.20)
The invariant given by equation 2.19 describes how a single particle moving
through trace space will travel along the contour of an ellipse [4]. The ellipse
itself will rotate in the x  x plane but the area of the ellipse will remain con-
stant. Liouvilles theorem states that for a particle beam undergoing conservative
forces, the particle density in phase space will remain conserved [4]. A schematic
of the particle phase space ellipse is shown in figure 2.1. The Courant-Snyder
parameters ,  and  are dependent on the longitudinal position s. This depen-
dence can be removed by transforming to the Floquet coordinates, Transforming
the particle trajectories along the (x, x) plane from ellipses to circles [6]. The

tween the Courant-Snyder parameters , , .
transform to the Floquet coordinates {x, y} and {x, y} is given by
 {x, y}
{x, y}
x,y(s) 0
 x,y(s)
x,y(s)
x,y(s)
 {x, y}
{x, y}
 , (2.21)
where  represents matrix multiplication. From the Floquet coordinates labelled
F , a one turn matrix can be derived that describes the particle phase space ellipse
around a circular accelerator. A one turn matrix is defined as a mapping of one
of the accelerator coordinates from one position in the ring to the same position
after a complete turn. The normal form transformation can be written as
Mturn = FR()F1, (2.22)
where R() is the rotation matrix,
R() =
 cos sin
 sin cos
 , (2.23)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 31
and  is the angle of rotation.
To further develop the understanding and properties of the Courant-Snyder in-
variant, the evolution of the Courant-Synder ellipse during acceleration is con-
sidered.
As the particles in the machine are accelerated the Courant-Synder invariant x
will decrease. This is sometimes called Adiabatic Damping. The shrinking of x
can be understood by considering the particle momentum p(x, z). The particle
momentum before and after the acceleration in shown in figure 2.2. As the particle

after the particle has been accelerated (right).
is accelerated its momentum pz along the longitudinal will increase by pz + pz,
however the transverse component px will not change. Since the longitudinal
momentum component pz has increased and the transverse component of the
momentum px has not changed, x
 must change. The angle between pz and px
must decrease and hence the length of the hypotenuse will increase by x + x.
This new value of the hypotenuse is given by
x = x
. (2.24)
This will reduce the Courant-Synder invariant x. However if a beam of particles
with the same x but random phases  are introduced as described in ref [7],
then the emittance of the beam can be written in terms of an invariant, nor-
malised emittance which decreases as a function of momentum. This normalised
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 32
emittance is written as
n = r, (2.25)
where r =
is the particle speed v, over the speed of light c,  is the relativistic
boost factor, and  is the physical emittance. This normalised emittance does not
change during acceleration and hence does not violate Liouvilles theorem. In the
LHC the bunches can be considered to be Gaussian. For a Gaussian distribution
the bunch size can be written in terms of  as,
x,y =
x,yx,y. (2.26)
The discussion above is derived considering that the particles all move along the
design momentum which is labelled p0. In reality however, this will not be the
case and particles will have a spread in momenta, this is typically denoted as ,
where
. (2.27)
Deviation from the reference momentum can introduce chromatic effects which
will impact the particle dynamics [3, 4, 8, 9]. One chromatic effect that arises
in dipoles due to momentum deviation is called dispersion. Particles in a bunch
will have a momentum spread and this momentum spread will result in particles
following a different trajectory through the magnetic elements. This in turn will
lead to particles following different orbits around the accelerator lattice. The
impact on the particle momentum due to dispersion is given in terms of the
dispersion function [8, 9] as
{x, y} = Dx,y. (2.28)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 33
Dispersion effects are just one result of a monochromatic beam in an accelerator.
In the next section other chromatic effects and coupled betatron motion are
considered along with the Hamiltonian formalism of a particle moving in an
accelerator. The Hamiltonian formalisation is often more suitable to describe
these effects than Hills equations.
2.1.3 The Accelerator Hamiltonian
The Hamiltonian H, of a physical system corresponds to the total energy within
that system in terms of a set of canonical variables. Similarly the Lagrangian, L,
corresponds to the dynamics of a particular system and is the difference between
the kinetic energy, Ek and the potential energy, Ep. The Lagrangian of a system
is given by equation 2.29
L = Ek  Ep. (2.29)
The Hamiltonian of a system is written in terms of the position and momentum
of that particle as given by equation 2.30,
H = Ek + Ep. (2.30)
These two formalisations have many important uses in physics [10]. The Hamil-
tonian and Lagrangian of a system are related to one another by a Legendre
transformation [11], namely
H(qk, pk; t) =
qipi  L(qk, qk; t), (2.31)
where the position and momentum are denoted by q and p respectively, q corre-
sponds to the time differential of the position (i.e the velocity), with t representing
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 34
the time. The time component is often considered as the independent variable, so
that the total energy of the system is considered to be conserved. If the Hamil-
tonian of a system is known, the time evolution of that system will be defined by
Hamiltons equations [12],
dtp = qH, (2.32)
dtq = pH. (2.33)
If the Hamiltonian of a system does not contain any coupling terms, then Hamil-
tons equations can be applied easily. If, however, the components p and q can
not be separated, then Hamiltons equations will become non-trivial and may
be difficult to solve. A simple application of the accelerator Hamiltonian is to
consider a magnetic field within the thin lens approximation [4], where this ap-
proximation treats the magnetic element as having a small length compared to
the focal length. The magnetic field for a multipole of any order is given by
By(x, y, s) + iBx(x, y, s) = (Bn(s) + iAn) (x+ iy)
n1, (2.34)
where the normal and skew coefficients are An and Bn respectively. The variable
n is the multipole of interest, i.e n = 1 corresponds to a dipole, n = 2 is a
quadruple etc. Thus the linear Hamiltonian H0 for a quadrupole can be written
in terms of some focussing function x,y as,
p2x + p
y + (s)x
2  (s)y2
, (2.35)
where px,y are the momentum components and x, y are the position components.
The contribution from the real magnetic field to nth order can hence be written
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 35
n1 (Bn(s) + iAn) (x+ iy)
n1] . (2.36)
From equation 2.36, the momentum change with s can then be calculated from
Hamiltons equation as
dsp{x,y} = d{x,y}H. (2.37)
For some higher-order multipoles, such as sextupoles (n = 2) and octupoles
n = 3, this will introduce an amplitude dependent detuning along with other
non-linear effects. These higher-order magnets are all found in the LHC and can
affect the particle dynamics [3, 13]. Some of the non-linear effects that arise from
sextupoles and octupoles will be reviewed in the following section.
2.1.4 Non-Linear Dynamics
As discussed previously, the tune Qx,y of a machine is the number of betatron
oscillations of a particle around the reference trajectory. Much like a harmonic
oscillator, resonances exist that can cause the betatron oscillations to become
driven [14]. This can lead to particle motion becoming unstable, with unstable
motion leading to particle loss from the machine if the oscillation is not damped
by a correcting magnet or some other physical process. Resonance behaviour
in an accelerator arises due to non-linearities in the lattice. For example mag-
netic errors can excite resonance as well as higher-order multipoles or beam-beam
interactions. The resonance condition is given by [3, 4] as
aQx + bQy = c, a, b, c  Z (2.38)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 36
where the order of the resonance (n), is given by
|a|+ |b| = n. (2.39)
The resonance diagram for c values up to 5 is shown in figure 2.3. In figure 2.3
Figure 2.3: Non-integer resonance diagram up to 5th order between 0 and 1 in
the horizontal (Qx) and vertical planes (Qy) with the LHC fractional working
point identified at Qx = 0.31 and Qy = 0.32 at collision [15].
it can be seen that the resonance lines are not all the same thickness. Resonant
behaviour does not just occur at the non-integer resonance but at some finite
region around that resonance. This is known as the stop band width and is
discussed in detail in reference [4]. For hadron machines like the LHC, the higher-
order resonances could have a significant impact on beam stability which may lead
to particle losses.

2.1.4.1 Chromaticity
Energy dependent effects such as dispersion arise from difference between the
particle momentum and the reference particle momentum p0. Additionally, off-
reference momentum particles will experience a variation of tune which is depen-
dent on the deviation from the reference momentum; this is called chromaticity.
For example, particles travelling through a quadrupole with momenta that lies
off-reference will experience a different quadrupole field to that of the ideal parti-
cle. As a result each particle will have a different focal point after the quadrupole.
A schematic of chromaticity is shown in figure 2.4. Considering the tune variation
Figure 2.4: Schematic showing chromatic effects due to a quadrupole for
different off-reference momentum particles [4].
with momentum deviation
p1  p0
then the linear and non-linear chromatic terms can be written from the Taylor
expansion of the tune as,
Qx,y (p) = Qx0,y0 + pQx,y  p+
2pQx,y
 p2 + ...+
npQx,y
 pn. (2.40)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 38
The differential npQx,y is often denoted in the literature as Q
, where Q is called
the chromaticity and higher-order primed terms are often referred to as the non-
linear chromaticity [4]. Higher-order magnets such as quadrupoles and sextupoles
introduce chromaticity which can impact a particles trajectory through the field.
In the LHC, these higher-order terms can all have an impact on the beam dy-
namics [13].
In addition to chromaticity, non-linear and collective effects such as the beam-
beam interaction can also introduce a detuning with amplitude. The detuning
with amplitude is defined as the tune variation as a function of the particle action.
Similarly to the chromaticity the detuning with amplitude can be derived using a
Taylor expansion about the unperturbed tune as a function of particle emittance
x,y. Expanding the tune around the particle emittance in the horizontal and
vertical planes gives
Qx,y(x, y) = Qx0,y0 + xQx,yx + yQx,yy+
2xQx,y
x + 
Qx,y
y + 2xyQx,yxy
+ ... . (2.41)
The amplitude detuning arising due to non-linearities in the magnetic and elec-
tric fields can cause particles to diffuse to large amplitudes, or be pushed onto
resonances. It should however be noted that amplitude detuning is not the only
mechanism capable of causing particles to move onto resonant tunes. Additional
mechanisms include the effect of changing chromaticity for particles with non-
zero p/p, power ripple in the magnets, and linear coupling. The concept of
linear coupling will be introduced in the following section. Amplitude dependent
detuning can however be beneficial and can minimise coherent motion of the
bunch. In the LHC, a common source of amplitude detuning arises due Landau
damping produced by the octupole magnets and the beam-beam interaction [16].
The beam-beam interaction and Landau damping will also be discussed in more
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 39
detail later in section 2.2 and 2.1.6.
In addition, another mechanism which is often confused with Landau damping is
called beam decoherence. Decoherence occurs when a beam is excited by a single
kick. This kick excites betatron oscillations and these oscillations combined with
amplitude detuning and chromaticity cause the particles in the bunch to oscillate
out of phase with one another and the beam is said to have decohered. Unlike
Landau damping, decoherence will lead to an emittance growth.
2.1.5 Linear Coupling
In the previous sections only uncoupled motion has been considered, however
in a real machine coupled motion between the x and y plane can arise due to
some magnetic components in the lattice. Linear coupling can have a significant
impact on the particle dynamics and can lead to resonant motion and dynamic
aperture reduction. The topic of dynamic aperture will be introduced in more
detail in chapter 6 but the impact of linear coupling on the particle motion is
described briefly. Linear betatron coupling can arise from a number of magnetic
elements in a machine. Solenoid and skew-quadrupole fields are such examples
of magnetic elements which can lead to coupled motion [8]. To include coupled
motion due to a skew quadrupole, a simple derivation from Hills equations 2.9
can be considered. Hills equations when coupled are no longer a function of
one coordinate and instead will lead to two coupled differential equations in the
transverse planes. These equations are
x + kxx+ xy = 0, (2.42)
y  kyy + yx = 0, (2.43)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 40
where the function x,y is the focussing strength of the skew quadrupole and is
given by
. (2.44)
Following the approach by Wiedermann [4] the ansatz is chosen of the form
x = a1 cos+
sin+ c1 cosh+
sinh, (2.45)
y = a2 cos+
sin+ c2 cosh+
sinh, (2.46)
where  varies from 0 to length L of the quadrupole and the constants a1,2, b1,2, c1,2
and d1,2 account for the focussing and defocussing components of the skew quadrupole
in both planes. These constants must be related to each other and hence at the
beginning of the quadrupole when z = 0 the constants relate to one another
through
x0 = a1 + c1, y0 = a2 + c2, (2.47)
x0 = b1 + d1, y
0 = b2 + d2. (2.48)
Since the motion is coupled, the position dependent coefficients must be related to
one another. Similarly the momentum dependent coefficients will also be related.
This leads to
a1 = a2, b1 = b2, c1 = c2, d1 = d2. (2.49)
Now the coefficients have been constrained, the transformation matrix can be
derived for a skew quadrupole and is given as in ref [4]. The matrix Mskew will
transform the original coordinates x0, x
0, y0, y
0 to the new coordinates x, x
, y, y,
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 41
as a particle travels through the skew quadrupole. This matrix is given by
Mskew =

C+ 1
S+ C 1
S C+ 
S+ C
C 1
S C+ 1
S+ C 
S C+

, (2.50)
where C = cos  cosh and S = sin  sinh. The terms |C+| and |C|
can generally be considered as the direction of the tune shift due to the linear
coupling. In the LHC, due to the choice of working point, the |C| coupling is
generally more of a concern as this tune shift can cause particles to move closer
to the third order resonance.
2.1.6 Landau Damping
As a bunch travels through the elements of an accelerator lattice, wake fields can
excite coherent waves which can displace the bunch centroid from its equilibrium
position [14, 17]. The wake fields will act on all of the particles in the bunch,
importantly however, there is a frequency spread meaning that all particles will
have slightly different frequencies. As a result each individual particle will have a
different response to the coherent wave. This frequency spread means that some
particles will gain energy from other particles whilst others will loose energy
from surrounding particles. This exchange of energy between the particles in
the bunch will damp the coherent motion of the bunch centroid and act in a
way to stabilise the coherent oscillation. An in-depth discussion along with a
mathematical description can be found in ref [14, 17, 18].
This concludes the single particle dynamic part of the introduction. In the next
section, the dynamics of the beam-beam interaction will be discussed.
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 42
2.2 The Beam-Beam Interaction
For a colliding beam storage ring like the LHC, the main objective is to generate
luminosity by colliding two proton beams at dedicated interaction points (IPs)
around the machine. The resulting interaction between beams produce particle
collisions that are of interest to the high-energy physics community. The collisions
between the bunches result in the interaction of the electromagnetic fields of the
two beams. This interaction is known as the beam-beam interaction and cannot
be avoided in the LHC. These effects can be strong and non-linear and can impede
machine performance. In the following section, luminosity and the beam-beam
interaction are introduced. The concept of luminosity is discussed along with a
number of simple calculations corresponding to operational scenarios which may
impact luminosity performance. Then the beam-beam force is derived and the
effects that arise from this force are reviewed.
2.2.1 Luminosity
The luminosity is a key machine performance indicator for the LHC. Luminos-
ity is generated through head-on collisions between bunches in counter rotating
beams. In a standard operational physics fill in the LHC, the bunches will collide
at 4 IPs around the ring. IP1 and IP5 house the two low  experiments, AT-
LAS and CMS. These detectors were responsible for detecting the Higgs boson
and require tightly squeezed beams with small . This generates high luminos-
ity in order to study rare physics events. The experiment ALICE is located at
IP2. This experiment investigates heavy ion collisions between lead ions. Finally
LHCb, located at IP8 investigates physics involving the bottom quark. There are
a total of seven experiments located around the LHC ring all requiring different
operational requirements from the machine in order to study different particle
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 43
physics processes. This provides a number of operational challenges for the ma-
chine that must be addressed. Firstly the concept of luminosity in a colliding
beam storage ring like the LHC will be discussed.
The luminosity is defined as the ratio of the number of events detected over a
specified time period to the interaction cross section. The luminosity can hence
be written as
dtR = L  cross, (2.51)
where R is the number of collisions, L is the luminosity, and cross is the cross
section for a given interaction rate. Luminosity in the LHC is generated by
colliding bunches and is dependent on the colliding bunch distributions. The
instantaneous luminosity can be calculated following the procedure in [16] from
L  
1(x, y, z; z0)  2(x, y, z; z0)dr4, (2.52)
where r = (x, y, z, z0) and z0 is the time-like component, i is the charge density
distribution with the subscripts 1, 2 denoting which beam, and  is the kinematic
relativistic factor,
(v1  v2)2 
(v1  v2)2
Since the bunches in the LHC can be considered to have a Gaussian charge density
distribution with equal bunch sizes in the transverse planes, then the integral 2.52
is re-written as
L = N1N2frevNb
dxdydzdz0,
(2.53)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 44
where  = 2, since v1 = v2 and the collisions are in the absence of any crossing
angle ( = 0). The parameters N1,2 correspond to the bunch population, frev
is the frequency of revolution around the machine, and Nb is the number of
bunches in the beam assuming all of the bunches have the same population. The
transverse bunch size at the IP is
x,y =
x,yx,y, (2.54)
where x,y is the -function at the IP. Excluding any coupling between the planes
and using the identity
, (2.55)
and integrating equation 2.53, leaves
N1N2frevNb
4xy
. (2.56)
Equation 2.56 gives the instantaneous luminosity for a round bunch. Extending
the equation to include elliptical bunches can be performed by considering equal
bunch lengths 1,z = 2,z but unequal bunch sizes 1,x = 2,x and 1,y = 2,y.
This will give the luminosity formula for an elliptical bunch as
N1N2frevNb
21,x + 
21,y + 
. (2.57)
The approach detailed in [16] is easily extendable to include more realistic col-
lision scenarios such as in the presence of a crossing angle and transverse offset.
Including these effects will be discussed in the next section.
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 45
2.2.1.1 Luminosity with Crossing Angle and Transverse Offsets
The result obtained in equation 2.56 is an ideal case in which there is no transverse
offset between the two beams and no crossing angle. To provide a more realistic
interpretation of luminosity in a colliding beam storage ring, the additional effects
from crossing angle and offset are included. Following the method in [19], an
adjusted coordinate system is introduced and the schematic of these coordinates
is shown in figure 2.5. The adjusted coordinates include the crossing angle 
and the transverse offset 1,2 with respect to the reference orbit. The subscripts
1, 2 denote which beam. The transformation between Cartesian and the modified
z1	 z2	
x1	 x2

an offset and a crossing angle .
Cartesian coordinates is given by
x1 = 1 + x cos z sin, z1 = z cos+ x sin,
x2 = 2 + x cos+ z sin, z2 = z cos x sin.
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 46
Starting from equation 2.52 and transforming to the modified coordinate system
gives
L = N1N2frevNb
1,x(x1)1,y(y1)1,z(z1  z0)  2,x(x2)2,y(y2)2,z(z2 + z0)dr4,
(2.58)
where  is the kinematic factor and r = (x1,2, y1,2, z1,2, z0). To initially treat
this problem, the offset in the horizontal and vertical plane will be set to zero
( 1,2 = 0) and the crossing angle will be assumed to be in the horizontal plane
only. Then for a 3-dimensional Gaussian charge density distribution, the y and
z0 integrals can be be evaluated using the identity
e(at
2+bt+c)dt =
b2ac
This gives the luminosity with only the x and z integrals to be performed. With
the offset set to zero, substituting the coordinate transform, x1,2 and z1,2 into the
x and z Gaussian charge density distribution gives,
N1N2frevNb
82z2xy
2 cos2 +z2 sin2 
2x e
2 sin2 +z2 cos2 
2z dxdz. (2.59)
For small values of x and  the paraxial approximation can be used. The paraxial
approximation gives sin  tan  . The resulting equation is comparable
to the expression 2.56 , but includes an additional reduction factor. Hence, the
luminosity varies with crossing angle  as,
N1N2frevNb

 Fred(), (2.60)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 47
where the approximation z  x,y can be used since in the LHC at IP1, x 
16 m and z = 7.5 cm, then the reduction factor Fred() is expressed as,
Fred() =
)2 . (2.61)
For LHC-like bunches, the function Fred() will improve as the crossing angle
is reduced. The dependence with crossing angle for bunch lengths of z = 7.5
cm and various operational s are shown in figure 2.6. The reduction factor

Figure 2.6: Variation of Fred() with full crossing angle  for various different
 options in the LHC and HL-LHC
calculated above only includes a crossing angle; in reality the bunches may also
collide with an offset. Following the same method but for a non-zero x, and
assuming the crossing angle and offset is in the horizontal plane yields, after the
y and z integration,

This can be written in terms of equation 2.56, again with additional reduction
terms cast in terms of W, exp B
and F. The luminosity including these reduc-
tion factors is written in equation 2.65,
N1N2frevNbunch

Equation 2.65 enables the instantaneous luminosity to be calculated whilst also
including crossing angle and an offset. Figure 2.7 shows the luminosity as a func-
tion of different offsets and crossing angles. The luminosity can be considered as

The reduction factors are sometimes collectively labeled as the luminosity reduc-
tion factor Floss. In a machine like the LHC, the luminosity reduction factor is
approximately of the order of Floss  0.8, with the largest luminosity reduction
factor arising due to the crossing angle .
2.2.1.2 Integrated Luminosity
In addition to the instantaneous luminosity, the integrated luminosity is another
useful parameter for determining the luminosity performance of a machine over an
extended period of time. The instantaneous luminosity will define the luminosity
at a given moment in time, i.e between two colliding bunches or two colliding
beams. The integrated luminosity on the other hand, defines the luminosity over
a given period of time and will include operational aspects such as turn-around
time between fills [16]. The integrated luminosity is expressed as
Lint =
L()d. (2.66)
Figure 2.8 shows the integrated luminosity and the luminosity performance of
the LHC from the 2011 to 2016 runs. Throughout the operational runs, the lu-
minosity performance has increased, exceeding expectations significantly. One
contributing factor to the high luminosity performance is due to tight controls on
the long-range beam-beam interaction, the suppression of instabilities and oper-
ational experience from previous runs of the LHC [20]. The interaction between
the two colliding beams will also impact the particle dynamics over the duration
of a fill. In the next section, the beam-beam force is introduced.
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 50

2.2.2 The Beam-Beam Force
The beam-beam force can be computed by considering the charge density dis-
tribution of a bunch and calculating the electric field that a counter rotating
test particle will experience, as it traverses the bunch. From this, the change
in momentum imparted to that test particle can be obtained. There are a
number of possible approaches that allow the electric field of a charge distri-
bution to be calculated. Traditionally, as in the literature, Poissons equation is
solved [16, 22, 23], although an alternative approach from Maxwells equations
is proposed and outlined in Chapter 4. Poissons equation is a second order,
inhomogeneous partial differential equation given by
2 =
, (2.67)
where the Laplace operator is given by 2 = 2xi + 
+ ... + 2xn ,  is the
electric scalar potential, 0 is the permittivity of free space. and  is the charge
density distribution. This equation can be solved by applying the superposition
principle through a convolution of a Greens function with the charge density
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 51
distribution [24]. The electric potential is calculated using
(x, y, z) =
G(x, y, z, x, y, z)(x, y, z)dxdydz, (2.68)
where G is the Greens function [1, 24] and the primed coordinates represent the
integral over the charge density distribution, and the unprimed coordinates are
the integral over the potential. Following the method in [16, 25], this can be
expressed using the -function in the 3-dimensions as,
G(x, y, z, x, y, z) =
43/2
 |xx
|2|yy|2|zz|2
q dq. (2.69)
Taking the Greens function and substituting a Gaussian charge density distri-
bution into equation 2.68 gives the integral to be evaluated as
(x, y, z) =
43/2
 |xx
|2|yy|2|zz|2
22z dxdydzdq.
(2.70)
For a simple Gaussian charge density distribution, the integrals can be written
separately in terms of x, y or z, and can be solved individually. The x integra-
tion can be solved using the identity 2.71,
22x
 |xx
q dx =
22x+q
22x + q
. (2.71)
Applying this integral identity to the remaining variables, the 3-dimensional po-
tential can be expressed with just the integral over q to be performed. The
integral is often left in the form given by [16, 22, 25],
(x, y, z) =
qxqyqz
dq, (2.72)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 52
where n is the number of particles in the bunch and the qx,y,z terms are,
qx = 2
x + q, qy = 2
y + q, qz = 2
z + q.
For simplicity and brevity, the 2-dimensional round bunch case is considered here,
with the elliptical beam case shown in [22]. The round bunch potential can be
calculated by setting z = 0 and transforming to cylindrical coordinates through
x = r cos, y = r sin. This gives the round bunch potential as
(r) =
dq, (2.73)
where qr = 2
r + q. This potential is related to the electric field of the bunch by
the gradient of the scalar potential. Hence using
E = , (2.74)
the electric field in the rest frame of the bunch is
E(r) = 
. (2.75)
To calculate the force experienced by a counter rotating test particle traversing
the Gaussian bunch, the force generated by the electric fields must be computed.
To achieve this, the electric field is boosted into the collision frame. A schematic
of the electric field before and after the boost in the two reference frames is shown
in figure 2.9. In the rest frame of the bunch the electric field lines propagate out
in all directions. After the boost, the field lines are confined almost entirely to
the transverse planes, orthogonal to the direction of the boost. A longitudinal
component of the electric field will however be introduced for non-zero crossing
angles. The Lorentz boost of the electromagnetic field tensor to the collision

frame is given by
 = L
FL
 , (2.76)
where Fp is the electromagnetic field tensor and L
 is the boost matrix [26]. Re-
quiring that the boost acts in the z direction yields the following transformation
of the electric fields,

(Ex + vrBy)
(Ey  vrBx)
 , (2.77)

(Bx  vr
(By + vr
 , (2.78)
where vr is the velocity and barred terms (E, B) represent the electric and mag-
netic fields in the rest frame. Hence the Lorentz force in the collision frame of
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 54
the bunch acting on a counter rotating test particle with charge q is given by

 = q

rEx (1 uzvr/c2)
rEy (1 uzvr/c2)
Ez + rvr(Exux + Eyuy)/c
 . (2.79)
Now these expressions have been obtained, the round bunch electric field obtained
in equation 2.75 can be used to calculate the force. If the particles in the bunch are
at rest with respect to one another, the problem can be considered electrostatic
and hence the magnetic field can be set to B=0 in the rest frame. Using the
expressions for the electric and magnetic field, 2.77 and 2.78 respectively, and
boosting along the z axis gives the electric and magnetic fields in the collision
frame as
Er = 
, B = 
nqrc0
with the beam-beam force given by
Fbb = 
nq2(1 + 2r )
. (2.80)
Equation 2.80 gives the beam-beam force that a counter rotating test particle
will experience. The beam-beam force is shown in figure 2.10 and can be seen
to be non-linear towards larger test particle amplitudes. Hence, due to the non-
linearity of the beam-beam force, the distance of a test particle from a Gaussian
bunch will have an important impact on the bunch dynamics. Particles with
small radial amplitude experience a linear beam-beam force and this applies to
short range interactions and is known as the head-on beam-beam interaction. The
maximum and minimum of the force is located at 1.59  and this numerical result
is a consequence of the Gaussian distribution. Large amplitude particles observe
a non-linear force acting over large distances, this is known as the long-range
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 55
beam-beam force. The details of the two types of interactions will be discussed
in detail in the next section. In order to consider the impact of the long-range

bunch versus the radial coordinate R in units of bunch sigma. The maximum

and head-on beam-beam force on the particle dynamics, the momentum kick
to the particle should be derived. The momentum kick imparted by the bunch
onto the counter rotating test particle can be calculated easily by integrating the
beam-beam force over the time taken for the test particle to move through the
length of the bunch. Introducing the time-like variable z = s ct, then the kick
is calculated from the integral
r =
Fbb(r, t)dt, (2.81)
which when evaluated, yields in Cartesian coordinates,
x = 
, (2.82)
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 56
where the classical particle radius r0 is introduced and given by
. (2.83)
From the momentum change or kick due to the beam-beam force described above,
the impact of the head-on and long-range beam-beam interaction on particle
dynamics is discussed in the next section.
2.2.3 Head-On Beam-Beam Effects
The head-on (HO) beam-beam interaction occurs when two counter rotating
bunches collide at the IP and generate luminosity. A schematic of the head-on
beam-beam interaction is shown in figure 2.11. The head-on beam-beam interac-
tion is characterised by the linear part of the beam-beam force, since this applies
to small amplitude particles as shown in figure 2.10. To determine the behaviour
of particles at small amplitude the impact on the tune will be considered.

Particle tracking simulations can allow the tune footprint to be calculated. The
tune footprint can be calculated by tracking particles of various amplitudes in
phase space through the elements of a machine over several turns. Details of
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 57
particle tracking will be discussed later in chapter 6. From the resulting tracking
simulations, a Fourier transformation can be performed over the particle oscil-
lation as a function of turn number to obtain the frequency data. Using the
frequency data, the tune shift (non-linear detuning) due to the beam-beam force
can be calculated. The non-linear detuning with the particle amplitude RJ can
be obtained using the derivation given in ref [16], and is given as
Q(RJ) =
1 I0
, (2.84)
where I0 is the modified Bessel function, bb is the beam-beam parameter which
will be introduced later, and RJ =
, where  in this case represents the single
particle emittance. Restricting ourselves to the 2-dimensional case, to a particle
with tune shifts Qx,y and amplitudes x, y, the detuning can be calculated and
mapped from amplitudes x, y to tune space Qx,y. An example of the tune foot-
print for a head-on colliding bunch is shown in figure 2.12. In this figure 2.12,
Figure 2.12: The tune footprint for a single head-on beam-beam interaction
at injection tunes Qx = 0.28 and Qy = 0.31 from ref [16].
each intersection point of the lines represents a pair of amplitudes denoted by
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 58
the coordinates (x, y). These amplitudes are mapped to the tune space Qx, Qy
and show the detuning due to the head-on beam-beam interaction. The head-
on beam-beam interaction is stronger than the long-range interaction and hence
provides the largest tune shift to a counter rotating particle. This is because
the maximum change in momentum of the the beam-beam force, which can be
calculated by differentiating the beam-beam force, is located at r = 0 [16]. Parti-
cles that have the smallest radial amplitudes will have the largest tune shift and
hence will be shifted further away from the unperturbed tune. The unperturbed
fractional tune in figure 2.12 corresponds to the LHC tunes at injection with
Qx,y = 0.31/0.32. For particles at large amplitudes and no long-range beam-
beam interaction, the tune shift will tend towards the unperturbed tune. The
value of this tune shift given within the asymptotic limit is
QHO = 
4xy
, (2.85)
where the sign of the tune shift depends on the relative beams charges. When far
from resonances and dynamic beta effects [16], this tune shift is approximately
equal to the beam-beam parameter bb  np, where np is the number of inter-
action points. This is a useful parameter for characterising the strength of the
beam-beam interaction in colliding beam storage rings. The linear beam-beam
parameter can be calculated by taking asymptotic limit of equation 2.82. For
a round bunch in polar coordinates, the linear beam-beam parameter for small
amplitudes r is
bb = 
42
. (2.86)
Table 2.1 shows the beam-beam parameter for various colliding beam storage
rings for comparison. From table 2.1 it can be seen that for the various machines
the beam-beam parameters are the same order of magnitude with the exception

of at LEP. The beam-beam parameter in LEP is larger than the LHC. This arises
due to the smaller vertical beam emittances which are achievable from radiation
damping and almost no problems with resonances [27]. For LEP the damping
time was approximately 20 turns together with strong detuning.
Now that the head-on beam-beam interaction has been characterised, the long-
range beam-beam interaction can be discussed in the next section.
2.2.4 Long-Range Beam-Beam Effects
The long-range beam-beam interaction occurs when bunches in the two beams
experience the electromagnetic field from a counter rotating bunch at a distance.
A schematic of the long-range beam-beam interaction is shown in figure 2.13.

an amplitude dependent tune shift to the particles [16]. Unlike the head-on
beam-beam force, the beam-beam distance will vary from the inner triplet to the
collision point, the inner triplet will be introduced in chapter 3. Normally the
beam-beam separation is calculated as the distance between the bunches at the
first long-range beam-beam encounter.
The tune shift due to the long-range beam-beam interaction at large separations
can be determined by considering the beam-beam force as seen in equation 2.80.
For large separations the exponential term will become small, e
22r  1 and
hence the tune shift from the long-range interaction to first order, will vary with
the inverse square of the beam-beam separation distance dsep as
QLR = 
2(dsep)2
. (2.87)
For small separations however, the exponential term will no longer be small and
will provide an amplitude dependent tune shift. The amplitude dependent tune
shift will affect the tune footprint in a different way to that of the head-on in-
teraction. Figure 2.15 shows the long-range beam-beam tune footprint. The
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 61
long-range tune shift causes the tails of the footprint to extend and potentially
cross resonances, which may lead to emittance growth and particle losses. The
tails of the bunch in this case refer to particles found at amplitudes larger than
 3 . This extension of the tails is further exacerbated with the number of
long-range collisions. In addition, the long-range beam-beam tune shift can have
a different sign compared to the head-on tune shift as seen in equation 2.87. The
change in sign compared to head-on interactions arises due to the opposite gra-
dient of the beam-beam kick found at larger amplitudes (r > 2 ). The strength

interactions for a vertical separation and amplitude between 0 and 20  [16].
of the long-range beam-beam interaction depends on the collision configuration
for the machine and is closely related to the -function () at the IP and the
emittance (n) of the beam. For a colliding beam storage ring like the LHC, the
beam-beam separation is one of the factors that define the luminosity perfor-
mance of the machine. The impact of the long-range beam-beam interaction on
the LHC luminosity performance is discussed in detail in chapter 5.
2.2.5 Coherent Beam-Beam Effects
Two colliding beams will not only exert a single particle kick but also a coherent
kick to the bunch itself. If the colliding bunches have a slight offset with respect
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 62
to the other, or there is an asymmetry between the particle distributions of the
two bunches, coherent oscillations can be introduced which may lead to unstable
motion and closed orbit effects [8, 16]. The strength and effect of the coherent
oscillations depend on a number of factors. One factor which affects the nature
of the oscillations is the phase advance between the colliding bunches. Coherent
beam-beam effects can drive different types of motion and these are normally
described as coherent modes. The dipolar and quadrupolar are two examples
of coherent modes that are described schematically in figure 2.16. The dipole
modes arise when the bunches meet every turn either in or out of phase with one
another. If the bunches arrive in phase with one another the distance between
the bunches does not change from turn to turn, hence there is no net force that
drives the oscillation. Since there is no coherent kick in this case, the mode is
called the -mode and is found at the unperturbed tune. In the LHC at collision,
this is located at a fractional tune of Qx0,y0 = 0.31/0.32. The unperturbed tune is
denoted using Q0. The second dipole mode is known as the -mode. This mode
arises when the bunches meet out of phase with one another each turn and there
is a force difference between the two bunches. This leads to a driven oscillation
that can cause significant beam stability issues, if not controlled and damped.
The coherent tune shift is denoted by Q and the direction of the tune shift
depends on whether there is a focussing or defocussing effect between the colliding
bunches. In the LHC, the -mode is defocussing as the colliding bunches both
have positive charges. The coherent tune shift calculation is non-trivial and can
be difficult to calculate. An exact derivation will be strongly dependent on the
charge density distribution of the colliding bunches. For a simple calculation the
LHC bunches can be considered to have a Gaussian transverse bunch distribution,
in this case the tune shift characterised by the -mode can be calculated when
bunches arrive out of phase with one another. The tune shift for the -mode is

where x0, y0 are the coordinates of the closed orbit,

IP, and xx
coherent is the derivative of the beam-beam kick. The derivative of
the kick xx
coherent is given by the expression 2.89 and is calculated as
coherent(x, y) = 
2r22
. (2.89)
The tune change for the rigid bunch model is hence just the quadrupolar com-
ponent of the beam-beam kick. However this does not take into account the
additional non-linear terms of the beam-beam kick. To account for the non-
linear terms the -mode tune shift is often quoted in terms of a factor Y . If the
bunches collide head-on then the -mode including the factor Y is
Q = Q0 + Y bb. (2.90)
This factor Y is called the Yokoya factor and has a values between Y = 1.211.33
for round x = y and flat (x  y) beams [8, 29]. For a simple calculation
shown in equation 2.89, the rigid bunch model underestimates the Yokoya factor.
This occurs due to the assumption that the bunch distribution does not change
throughout the interaction with a counter rotating beam. In fact, the beam
distribution will change and hence in order to obtain a more realistic, but still
analytical calculation, higher-order moments of the bunch distribution should be
considered. The impact of the higher order moments can be calculated through
an expansion as described by Yokoya [30] or through numerical particle in cell
methods [31].
Taking a Fourier transform of the bunch oscillation enables the  and -modes

The  and  modes can be seen clearly and are separated by the incoherent
spectrum. The size of the incoherent spectrum is given by bb and defines the
spectrum of frequencies in which particles will be Landau damped. The peak on
the left hand side of the figure shows the -mode at approximately Q = 0.286
whilst the peak on the right corresponds to the -mode at Q = 0.31 at the
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 65
unperturbed tune. The incoherent spectrum is found between these two modes
and arises due to the tune spread created by detuning. Particles with frequencies
that lie within the incoherent spectrum will no longer oscillate coherently with one
another and are stabilised by Landau damping [16]. The frequency width in which
the particles are Landau damped is approximately equal to the linear beam-beam
parameter bb. The collision configuration shown in figure 2.17 corresponds to two
collisions at IP1 and IP5 with an asymmetric phase advance between collision
points. The beam-beam parameter for a HL-LHC-like bunch is bb = 0.0125 per
IP, which is approximately a factor of 3 larger than the LHC.
2.3 Discussion
This chapter has provided a brief overview of the key topics of collider physics.
The simple linear and non-linear dynamics that a charged particle experiences as
it travels around a machine lattice has been reviewed and the general equations
of motion were introduced. This included the concept of the invariant emittance,
phase advance and betatron motion. Following this, the Hamiltonian formalism
was discussed. This formalisation was used to describe dispersive effects that
arise due to off-momentum particles in a bunch as well as the dynamics of a
particle moving through an nth order magnetic multipole. Non-linear effects such
as linear coupling and higher order chromaticity are also briefly introduced and
discussed.
Following this, the topic of this thesis, the beam-beam interaction was introduced.
The beam-beam interaction is first described by introducing the concept of lumi-
nosity, which is a key parameter that can be used to determine the performance
of a colliding beam storage ring like the LHC. Firstly, the luminosity is derived
for the simplest possible collision configuration, that is, the collision between two
Chapter 2. Beam Dynamics 66
round, Gaussian bunches colliding head-on and without offset. Following this,
additional effects which arise in a real in the LHC are also introduced. The impact
of crossing angle and transverse offset on the luminosity are quantified. These
effects are usually categorised into reduction factors, which reduce the instanta-
neous luminosity between two head-on colliding bunches and can limit luminosity
performance. In addition to the luminosity, the beam-beam interaction exerts a
force on the counter rotating beam. This kick is calculated, firstly by considering
the electric field of a Gaussian bunch. The electric field is calculated by finding
the scalar potential in the rest frame of the bunch and then performing a Lorentz
boost along the z-direction. From this the kick can be derived. The kick will
result in a tune shift and this is shown for both the long-range and the head-on
beam-beam interactions. The concept of a tune footprint is also introduced here
and analysed with regard to both the long-range and head-on interactions. Fi-
nally this chapter concludes by considering coherent motion between two colliding
bunches.
The effects and beam dynamic processes in this chapter are found in many differ-
ent types of accelerators that generate luminosity through collisions with counter
propagating beams. In the next chapter, specifics of the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN will be presented.
Chapter 3
The Large Hadron Collider
3.1 Outline
This chapter briefly discusses the LHC injection chain and introduces LHC in
more detail. The LHC injection chain consists of one linear accelerator and three
circular machines that accelerate protons and inject them into the LHC. The
accelerators in the injector chain are discussed along with the relevant energies
from injection to extraction. In the following section, the LHC is introduced.
Firstly the machine layout and typical procedures during standard operation
are presented along with some of the nominal beam parameters. The relevant
beam instrumentation that is used throughout this thesis is introduced. The
methods and equipment used to analyse the intensity, emittance and luminosity
data are presented. A closer review of the interaction point is also discussed; at
these locations beam-beam interactions occur. Additionally, beam-beam effects
that are observed in the LHC are discussed. Finally, one of the proposed future
machines at the LHC are introduced. The HL-LHC is discussed along with the
luminosity performance. In particular a number of luminosity levelling scenarios
are reviewed.

3.2 The CERN accelerator complex
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest of the particle accelerators based
at the CERN laboratory. The CERN laboratory contains multiple particle ac-
celerators, with many providing protons for the LHC. In addition to the current
working machines, CERN and others also research and develop new state of the
art particle accelerators [33]. A schematic of the complex is shown in figure 3.1.
The protons start in LINAC2 and are accelerated to a kinetic energy of 50 MeV
before being injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). Here they are
accelerated up to 1.4 GeV, before being injected into the Proton Synchrotron
(PS). The PS accelerates the protons to 25 GeV and injects them into the Super
Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Finally the protons are injected into the LHC at an
injection energy of 450 GeV.
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 69
3.3 The LHC
The LHC is a 26.6 km twin ring colliding beam storage synchrotron that produces
luminosity to study the physics of the Standard Model, as well as potential physics
beyond the Standard Model [34]. The LHC first became operational in 2008 and,
as of 2017, is currently the largest particle accelerator in the world. The LHC is
the successor to the Large Electron-Positron Collider [35] that ceased operation
in 2000.
3.3.1 Machine Layout
The LHC is split into 8 octants with 8 Insertion Regions (IRs). Each IR performs
some principle function, whether it be beam cleaning or collisions. The particle
physics experiments are located in IR 1, IR 2, IR 5, and IR 8. ATLAS and
CMS are located in IR 1 and IR 5; these experiments require high luminosity to
study rare physics by colliding tightly squeezed beams with a low -function at
the IP [36, 37]. The ALICE experiment is located at IR 2 and does not operate
with tightly squeezed beams during proton physics runs ( = 3m) [38]. The
-function at the IP is however, reduced during ion (Pb-Pb) and proton-ion runs
(p-Pb). The LHCb experiment is located at IR 8 and similarly to the Alice
experiment does not require tightly squeezed beams with  = 8 m [39].
To obtain the small  at IP1/5 the beams must be focussed. This is achieved
by using a triplet configuration of quadrupoles in the IR that increases the -
function in the surrounding elements before focussing to the required  at the
IP. The particular magnet configuration and arrangement is discussed later in
section 3.4.1. The -function variation for beam 1 and beam 2 as a function of
longitudinal position along the beam pipe is shown in figure 3.2. The remaining
IRs contain LHC diagnostic, beam quality, injection and extraction systems. IR

3 and IR 7 are reserved for momentum cleaning and betatron cleaning respec-
tively. The momentum cleaning section cleans off-momentum particles from the
bunches, whereas the betatron cleaning section cleans high amplitude particles.
The machine Radio-Frequency (RF) instrumentation is located at IR 4 and the
LHC beam dump is located at IR 6. The systems are all designed to monitor
and control the bunches as the beams circulate round the machine. This helps to
ensure that the machine is not damaged by the high energy beams and that per-
formance is optimised. The design parameters for the LHC are given in table 3.1.
3.3.2 Operational Configuration
Whilst operating during the proton physics run (p-p), the bunch intensities are
of the order of np  1011 compared to the np  107 during the ion physics run.
The smaller bunch intensities during the ion runs lead to significantly weaker
beam-beam effects (since the beam-beam parameter is proportional to intensity,

Table 3.1: Typical operational parameters for the LHC during the 2015-2016
see chapter 2). Hence the proton physics collisions are of particular interest to
this thesis. Each beam in the LHC, during a nominal luminosity production fill
consists of 2808 bunches separated by 25 ns. The beams are further split into sets
(or trains) of bunches that need to be spaced appropriately, such that bunches
collide at the correct IPs around the ring. In addition to this, the size of the
spacing between the trains are required to ensure that there is a large enough
abort gap to dump the beam in the event of equipment failure. To avoid any
damage to the machine due to the high energy beam, an abort gap spacing of
3 s is required. This spacing allows for the rise time of the extraction kicker
magnets. There are two types of beam extraction methods in the LHC. The first
type of dump is called the synchronous beam dump and occurs during normal
operation. In this type of extraction, the kicker magnets will execute at the same
time and will be fired in synchronisation with the 3 s abort gap [40]. Secondly,
there is an asynchronous beam dump. This occurs with all kicker magnets firing
out of synchronisation with the LHC abort gap [40]. This can lead to a large
number of bunches hitting the collimators and potentially causing damage to the
collimators themselves.
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 72
3.3.3 LHC Operational Cycle
During a standard luminosity production fill, the beam undergoes the standard
operation cycle. This standard operational cycle is described by five different
beam flags; Injection, Ramp, Squeeze, Adjust and Stable beams. These processes
are highlighted in figure 3.3 along with the corresponding main dipole and oc-
tupole powering. In addition to dipoles and octupoles, many different multipoles
exist in the LHC [41]. Quadrupoles are used around the ring to focus or defocus
the beam in the arcs or at the IP. Sextupoles and other higher order magnets are
used in the lattice to correct chromaticity and errors from the dipoles and other
non-linearities of the machine. During the injection and ramp operational stages,
the optics are set to maximise the aperture and hence, as a result, the -function
at the IP is large and will remain so throughout the ramp [42]. Once the beams
have been ramped up to a flat top energy of 6.5 TeV, the -function at the IP is
reduced with the crossing angle remaining fixed in IP1 and IP5, in preparation
for luminosity production. This reduces the beam size down, however the beams
are still not in collision. The next stage is the adjust operational procedure. Dur-
ing this stage, the parallel separation orbit bumps are collapsed at IP1 and IP5.
This brings the bunches into collision and begins to produce luminosity. Once
the beams have been adjusted and the bunches are colliding, the operational flag
will be set to stable beams. Throughout the stable beams flags, the luminosity
will be optimised to ensure that the bunches are colliding without an offset until
finally, the beams are dumped at the end of the fill.
3.3.4 Beam Instrumentation
There are a number of different systems and instruments in the LHC that enable
the beam quality and losses to be observed. These are vital to determine the
efficiency of the machine by analysing the the beam data obtained from dedicated
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 73

luminosity production fill in 2012 [13]. The  at the IP is shown in black

machine studies and during luminosity production runs. The individual bunch
intensity can be measured using the Fast Beam Current Transformer (FBCT).
This instrument measures the intensity of every bunch in the beam every second,
to a high degree of accuracy and has an error smaller than < 1% [42]. The
FBCT measures the bunch intensity by detecting the change in magnetic field
as a bunch moves close to a magnetic torus. This in turn generates a current in
the secondary coil of a transformer, which has a known number of turns. This
measured current in the coil can hence be used to calculate the bunch intensity.
A schematic of the FBCT is shown in figure 3.4.
In addition to the bunch intensity it is also possible to measure the single bunch
emittance. The emittance can be calculated using the Beam Synchrotron Radi-
ation Telescope (BSRT). This device does not have the accuracy of the FBCT
but is capable of making measurements with an accuracy of  10% [44]. The
BSRT is useful mostly for relative measurements with the bunch size obtained
on a bunch by bunch basis. A schematic of how the synchrotron light from a
bunch in the LHC is used to calculate the emittance is shown in figure 3.5. Each
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 74

are used to analyse the beam and bunch current [43].
Figure 3.5: Schematic of how the synchrotron light from a proton bunch is

beam of the LHC will travel through a small, superconducting undulator close
to the edge of a dipole magnet. This will cause synchrotron light to be emitted
by the bunch and to be extracted through a viewport to the BSRT. The BSRT
will observe the synchrotron light and calculate the transverse bunch profiles over
some integration time. From the transverse bunch profiles the emittance of the
bunch can be calculated.
As discussed in chapter 2, the tune Qx,y is another useful parameter that can be
measured. The machine tune can be measured using the base band tune (BBQ)
system. This piece of equipment allows the passive monitoring and measurement
of the beam tune as well as linear coupling [46, 47]. The BBQ system calculates
and measures the beam tune using two specific beam position monitors (BPMs).
These BPMs are located with other beam instrumentation at IR4. The difference
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 75
signal between the two BPMs is measured and used to calculate the betatron
modulation of the beam position.
3.4 The Interaction Points
There are 8 interaction regions around the LHC and 4 IPs where the beams
collide. At these points, a number of high energy physics experiments exist to
study various particle physics processes [3639].
3.4.1 The Inner Triplet and Surrounding Region
The low  experiments are located at IP1 and IP5. Here the beams are squeezed
down to approximately r  16m. To achieve such a small beam size, a system
of very strong quadrupoles are used to blow the -functions of the beams up
so that they can be squeezed down at the IP. Since the beam size is inversely
proportional to the luminosity, reducing the beam  to a size as small as possible
will maximise the luminosity production rate. Figure 3.6 shows a schematic and
arrangement of the inner triplet. The separation dipoles are labelled as D1 and
Figure 3.6: Schematic and arrangement of magnets to the right of IP1 where
the ATLAS experiment is located [48].
D2 and these dipoles enable the two beams to be moved in and out of collision
at the IR. The inner triplet quadrupoles are responsible for blowing up the -
function and focussing the beam sizes at the IP. These quadrupoles are labelled
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 76
Q1,2,3. Finally the additional Q4,5,6,7 labels indicate matching quadrupoles, which
ensure that beam parameters at each end of the IR match the connecting arcs.
3.4.2 Collimation in the LHC
The LHC was designed to collide two beams at 7 TeV. This corresponds to a
beam energy of 360 MJ making the beams capable of significantly damaging the
LHC, if not controlled properly. In addition to the destructive capabilities of
the beams, the superconducting magnets that control the beam are sensitive to
beam losses and will quench if a relatively small number of protons collide with the
superconducting magnetic cores [49, 50]. To prevent magnetic quenching, beam
cleaning using a collimation system is used. The collimation system is split into
three parts, with the primary, secondary and tertiary collimation components
shown schematically in figure 3.7. The collimation system is designed with a

halo	 Secondary

number of aims in mind. Firstly, the collimation system must protect the super-
conducting magnets and sensitive equipment. This is achieved by cleaning the
beam halo (particles at large amplitudes) during LHC operation. The beam
halo will continually be filled by various beam dynamic processes throughout the
duration of a fill. Many different beam dynamic processes can cause particles
to diffuse to higher amplitudes; beam-beam effects and magnetic errors are two
examples. Removing the beam halo will also improve the particle physics data by
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 77
minimising any halo induced background at the experiments [49]. Secondly, the
collimator system must protect the machine aperture itself from any additional,
unexpected, abnormal particle losses. If a significant number of losses are detected
by the beam loss monitors located at the collimators, a beam abort trigger will be
executed to protect the machine. Additionally the collimation system is required
to perform abort gap cleaning.
Beam cleaning by the collimators occurs in a number of stages as seen in the
schematic shown in figure 3.7. The beam cleaning process is executed by three
different types of collimators, each with different principle design goals. The
primary collimators are required to remove the high energy protons from the
beam and generate a secondary proton halo [49]. This secondary proton halo
will be removed by the secondary collimators and any leakage from these are
absorbed by the tertiary collimators. Tertiary collimators are usually located at
specific points around the ring in order to remove halo that arises due to aperture
bottlenecks at the triplets [49].
In addition to the requirements mentioned above, separate cleaning systems are
located at IR3 and IR7 to provide optimised beam cleaning. In IR3, the collima-
tion system is optimised to perform beam cleaning for off-momentum protons. In
IR7, the collimation system is designed to clean protons that have large betatron
amplitudes [49].
3.5 Beam-Beam interactions in the Large Hadron
Collider
The beams collide at 4 IPs around the ring and at these points the bunches will
experience the electromagnetic field of bunches in the counter rotating beam.
The number of interactions and strength of these interactions will depend on a
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 78
number of different factors. Factors that affect the strength and number of the
beam-beam interactions include: the bunch spacing, the number of bunches in
the train, intensity, emittance, and the crossing angle. An example of a typical
filling scheme during a normal luminosity production fill is shown in figure 3.8.
In the 2015-2016 machine configuration, a train of 48 bunches with 25 ns bunch

spacing will experience a varying number of long-range and head-on beam-beam
interactions. During luminosity operation, the bunches in the centre of the train,
called the nominal bunches, will experience a maximum of 34 long-range interac-
tions per IP and up to 4 head-on interactions. Bunches at the front of the train
will experience less long-range interactions with a minimum of 17 interactions.
Bunches which do not experience the maximum number of long-range beam-beam
interactions are known as Pacman bunches. The number of head-on and long-
range interactions for a typical luminosity production fill is shown in figure 3.9.
The variation of the number of long-range interactions depending on the position
in the train is shown in figure 3.10. This section summarises some aspects of
the LHC as in current operation. However, the accelerator physics community
always seeks to push machine performance and build more powerful machines. A

number of upgraded machines have been proposed to push the energy range and
the luminosity performance. In the next section, one of those machines is briefly
discussed.

3.6 Future machines at CERN
After the LHC, a number of machines have been proposed to push the luminosity
reach and the energy performance. The next planned update for the LHC is the
HL-LHC [52].
3.6.1 HL-LHC
The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is a proposed upgrade
for the LHC to increase the luminosity performance [52]. A comparison between
the beam parameters in the LHC and HL-LHC are shown in 3.2. Aside from the

increase of the bunch population and reduction in emittance, a number of meth-
ods of increasing the peak and integrated luminosity have been suggested [53].
One method of increasing the luminosity is to include crab cavities [54]. These
cavities provide a kick to the head and the tail of the bunch, changing the an-
gle between the bunches and maximising the head-on beam-beam collision. The
crab cavities and an increase in the emittance and bunch intensity will increase
the strength of the beam-beam interaction. This could lead to emittance growth
and an increase in particle losses. These effects could have a negative impact
on the luminosity and bunch lifetimes, causing a large decay at the beginning of
the fill. Instead, luminosity levelling has been proposed to counteract the effects
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 81
of a quickly decaying luminosity [52, 53]. The luminosity will instead be held
constant throughout the duration of a fill by using luminosity levelling. Some of
the luminosity levelling options are discussed in the next section.
Luminosity levelling is likely to play an important role in the machine perfor-
mance. In order for the luminosity levelling to be effective it should not impact
beam stability and performance. Several luminosity levelling scenarios are dis-
cussed along with the performance implications.
3.6.1.1 Luminosity Levelling in the HL-LHC
As discussed in Chapter 2, the maximum luminosity can be achieved by minimis-
ing the reduction factor Floss. Luminosity levelling proposes to provide constant
luminosity production throughout the duration of a fill, whilst making small cor-
rections to the parameters in equation 2.65. Some options for luminosity levelling
are presented next.
One possible luminosity levelling option is to use crab cavities [55]. RF crab
cavities are due to be installed in the HL-LHC and these could be used to level
the luminosity. Crab cavities could be used to adjust the crossing angle over the
duration of a fill [56]. A schematic of crab cavity crossing is shown in figure 3.11.
The crab cavities provide a kick to the head and tail of the bunch and tilt the
bunches towards the IP, hence reducing the geometric loss factor and providing a
head-on collision. Crab cavities can be used to level the luminosity by changing
the tilt of the bunches and hence the geometric loss factor. Increasing the tilt
will reduce the overlap between the two bunches and reduce the luminosity. Crab
cavity levelling would be used to reduce the tilt throughout operation as the bunch
intensity decays and hence keep the luminosity fixed throughout a luminosity
production fill.

Crab cavities have been used successfully at the KEKB electron collider [57],
however they are yet to be tested in a hadron collider. Introducing and using
crab cavities in the LHC will change the beam-beam effects and could potentially
induce a number of issues. One of the main advantages of using the crab cavities
is that the cavities will be located at each IP. With a crab cavity located at each
IP, bunches can be crabbed at all IPs independently of one another by simply
varying the voltage across each cavity [56]. At present however, there are several
significant limiting factors which can cause issues for the detectors and from the
perspective of the beam dynamics. Firstly, the longitudinal vertex density will
vary with the crossing angle as shown in figure 3.12. The longitudinal vertex
density is defined by the number of collisions along the length of the bunch.
Varying the longitudinal density distribution during a luminosity production fill
Figure 3.12: Schematic of the longitudinal vertex density variation with
crossing angle. Here the arrows indicate the direction of the bunches. Reduc-
ing the crossing angle increases the longitudinal vertex density meaning that
collisions occur along the entire length of the bunch, instead of a large number
of collisions occurring in a very small area.
can introduce calibration issues for the detectors. If the crossing angle is large,
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 83
then the longitudinal vertex density will be small. This can make it difficult for
the detector to discern the number of collision events. The changing crossing
angle over the duration of the fill will also result in the tunes changing at each
levelling step. This could provide issues operationally as the constantly changing
tune would have to be corrected during operation. Additionally, the crab cavities
themselves could impart noise to the bunches as well as introducing phase jitter,
which is caused by a transverse offset mismatch [56, 58]. These effects could all
provide issues with stability and may reduce the maximum achievable beam-beam
tune spread bb and affect the luminosity production.
An alternative option for levelling in the HL-LHC is called -levelling. A
schematic of -levelling is shown in figure 3.13 with the different  at each
step. This levelling scenario is performed by reducing the -function at the IP
over the duration of the fill and squeezing the beam as the bunch intensity de-
cays. One of the benefits of this process is that it is adiabatic and hence does not
change the bunch emittance. This means that as the particle spatial component
x decreases, the momentum component x increases, meaning that the emittance
remains constant through each change in . Luminosity levelling through 
variation is currently the most likely method of levelling for the low  experi-
ments [55]. During -levelling, the longitudinal vertex density will remain fixed
as desired by the experiments. Additionally reducing the  keeps the tune fixed
at each levelling step and the head-on beam-beam tune spread remains constant,
as this is not dependent on  for the round bunch optic (x = y). For the
flat bunch optic (x = y) however, changing the  at each levelling step will
change the coherent tunes. This could cause operational issues and needs to be
controlled during operation to ensure that the -mode is damped. One of the
drawbacks of -levelling is the variation of the closed orbit at each levelling step.
This will need to be tightly controlled operationally to ensure that the beams do
not drift substantially, in order to avoid driving coherent oscillations and creating
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 84
a transverse offset between the two colliding bunches. The coherent modes for
two different levelling steps are shown in figure 3.14 for a round and flat bunch
optic. In the round bunch option shown in figures 3.14(a) and 3.14(b), the coher-

ent tunes in the horizontal and vertical planes do not change with the levelling
step. For the flat bunch option this is not the case. In the horizontal plane the
beam-beam tune shift bb,x increases, whereas in the plane in which the 
 is held
constant the beam-beam parameter bb,y will decrease. The coherent tune shifts
for the flat and round optics are shown in figure 3.14 using the method described
in [59]. The different bb in each plane could impact particle stability. There has
also been some experience operationally using -levelling during normal opera-
tion in IP2 and IP8. This makes -levelling an appealing method of obtaining
constant luminosity throughout the duration of a fill.
Levelling with offset is the simplest option proposed for the HL-LHC [56]. Due
to the nature and goal of the experiments located at the IPs, different luminosity
performance targets are required. The experiments located at IP2 and IP8 have
much lower luminosity tolerances than at IP1 and IP5 and hence luminosity
levelling by offset is already implemented at these points [60]. Similarly to crab
cavities, offset levelling can be applied independently at all IPs through a local
orbit bump. The individual orbit bump can also be implemented easily, providing
a simple method of changing between offsets. Crucially, levelling with offset keeps
the longitudinal vertex density fixed throughout the levelling steps. The main
issues with this levelling option concern the beam-beam interaction and stability.

levelling. The coherent modes for the round bunch are shown in 3.14(a)
and 3.14(b) and the flat bunch coherent modes are shown in 3.14(c) and
3.14(d).
Levelling with offset changes the strength of the beam-beam interaction with
every step. Different beam-beam separations can have a significant impact on
beam dynamic processes in the beam and can induce losses and emittance growth.
The tune spread during the levelling will also vary appreciably as the radial offset
changes. This can once again impact stability and lead to losses as was observed
in the 2012 operation [60]. The stability issue was cured by ensuring bunches
underwent a head-on collision at IP1 and IP5. This provided the required Landau
damping to stabilise the bunches as discussed in section 2.1.6. This suggests that
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 86
offset levelling would not be a viable option for levelling at the low  experiments.

3.7 Summary
In this chapter, the LHC layout and the injectors that provide protons to the
LHC have been introduced. Firstly, the purpose of the main IRs are discussed,
along with the basic operational cycle and the various beam flags which are used
during normal luminosity production runs. Following the section concerning the
layout of the LHC, key beam instrumentation such as the FBCTs, the BBQ and
the BSRTs are introduced along with a basic explanation of how the equipment
works. In the section following the LHC and the CERN accelerator complex, the
performance parameters of the proposed upgrade of the LHC to the HL-LHC and
the impact on the beam-beam effects and luminosity is considered. The HL-LHC
will aim to provide an even larger luminosity performance reach. To achieve the
increase in luminosity, the bunch emittance is reduced to n = 2.5 m compared
to 3.75 m in the nominal LHC, whilst the bunch population is increased to np =
2.2 1011 ppb. These bunch parameters have a direct impact on the strength of
the head-on interaction, leading to a much larger beam-beam parameter. Strong
beam-beam interactions can decreases the bunch lifetime and limit the integrated
luminosity, if the luminosity decay is large. To prevent a fast decay in luminosity
Chapter 3: The Large Hadron Collider 87
and to provide constant luminosity production throughout the duration of a fill,
luminosity levelling was proposed. The concept of luminosity levelling along with
three methods in which levelling can be implemented are discussed and reviewed
briefly. The advantages and disadvantages of the the three proposed methods
are evaluated. The impact on the coherent modes is also assessed for -levelling
with a simple collision scenario.

Analytical Expressions for the
Beam-Beam Interaction
4.1 Introduction
The luminosity performance in a colliding storage ring like the LHC is depen-
dent on a number of factors such as bunch population, emittance and geometric
loss factors arising from transverse offset and crossing angle [61]. The impact of
typical bunch parameters and operational scenarios are discussed in chapter 2.
In addition to the transverse bunch parameters, bunch length effects can also
further limit the luminosity performance [62]. One example of an effect that can
limit the luminosity performance is the hourglass effect; the impact of this effect
will be discussed in detail later in the chapter. In the first section of this chap-
ter, the preliminary mathematics required to understand the later sections are
developed. These preliminaries are then applied to derive a new method of ob-
taining analytical solutions to Poissons equation. This method derived is based
on using the general complex solutions to the Laplace equation. An ansatz is
chosen with a number of unknown functions to be constrained and found. Some
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 89
of these functions are holomorphic and analytic, and are shown to satisfy the
Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace equations. These functions are then used to con-
strain Maxwells equations including a source charge term. This yields a system
of equations which can be solved in the most general, n dimensional case. These
equations are then projected down to 2 and 3 dimensions, where the method is
applied to a number of different charge density distributions. This allows analyt-
ical expressions to be obtained for the electric field. These expressions are then
compared to literature where possible.
In order to obtain the luminosity requirements for future machines like the HL-
LHC, beam parameters such as the , emittance must be reduced and the beam
intensity increased. The reduced  can impact the luminosity performance if
this parameter becomes comparable to the length of the bunch. Within this
regime, the hourglass effect can prevent particles colliding at the minimum .
One proposed option for the HL-LHC is the flat bunch option [52]. This used in
combination with -levelling could result in a bunch length comparable to the
-function at the IP. The hourglass effect will introduce a coupling between the
transverse bunch size and the longitudinal position, causing a parabolic variation
towards the IP. Until now, no analytic method is available to describe this effect.
The method presented in this chapter is used to describe the hourglass effect
and an analytic expression for the electric field is obtained and compared to the
standard Gaussian distribution.
4.2 Outline
The beam-beam force is traditionally derived by solving Poissons equation where
the source charge  is given by a fixed Gaussian charge density distribution. Ana-
lytically it is possible to obtain solutions to Poissons equation for a 2 dimensional
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 90
Gaussian bunch. This approximation is usually suitable for most high energy col-
liders as the longitudinal electric field will be confined to the transverse planes,
since the bunches travel close to the speed of light within the ultra-relativistic
limit [16, 63, 64]. However in a real collider, coupling between the bunch planes
is possible and the non-zero crossing angle can introduce longitudinal effects that
may no longer be negligible [62]. Some symplectic methods have been derived so
far but are only approximate and do not calculate the exact electric fields [65].
To obtain an exact electric field calculation the full 3 dimensional case should be
considered.
The chapter is laid out in the following way; firstly the general derivation in n
dimensions is described. Here all the preliminaries are outlined, along with the
mathematical framework that will allow analytical solutions involving the beam-
beam interaction to be obtained. A brief introduction to the Cauchy-Riemann
equations and the Laplace equation are provided, initially from the well known
2 dimensional and then later extended to the general n dimensional case based
on hypercomplex coordinates. The hypercomplex coordinates are shown to solve
the n dimensional Cauchy-Riemann equations and the Laplace equation by in-
troducing two separate arbitrary functions, g and h, that depend only on one of
the hypercomplex coordinates. From this, a general complex coordinate trans-
form is described that can then be applied when one of the Cauchy-Riemann
equations are no longer homogenous and instead depends on some term . A
general ansatz is introduced with functions that need to be constrained. One
of the functions can be shown to correspond to the particular solution, when
 = 0. A system of equations are obtained from substituting the ansatz into the
modified Cauchy-Riemann equations and these equations are solved. A relation-
ship between the particular solution and the Cauchy-Riemann equations is found
through the method of characteristics. This is used to solve one final equation
relating the homogenous general solution to the particular solution.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 91
In the section following the general outline, the method of unconstrained functions
is applied to the two dimensional transverse Maxwells equations in the presence
of various source charge terms. Firstly, setting the source charge  to take the
form of a Gaussian charge density distribution allows the well known round bunch
derivation for the electric field to be obtained. This provides proof of principle
for the method. Following this, alternative, non-linear but simple distributions
are used to find the electric fields and are once again compared to results from
literature.
Using the mathematical framework of the method of unconstrained functions, the
electric field for a 3 dimensional Gaussian charge density distribution is obtained
without requiring the complex coordinate transformation. Finally, a preliminary
approach to obtaining analytical expressions including the hourglass is discussed.
The charge density distribution including the coupling is included into the frame-
work of the method of unconstrained functions and an expression is obtained and
discussed.
Finally the chapter is summarised and discussed with regard to further work.
4.3 General Complex Formalism
Here, the general mathematical framework is outlined for the method of uncon-
strained functions. This framework is an extension of the method by B. Muratori
et. al, which was used to find analytical expression for fringe field magnets [66].
Unlike the fringe field case however, Maxwells equations must be considered in
the presence of a source charge term . This requires Poissons equation to be
solved, as opposed to the Laplace equation. Poissons equation is an inhomo-
geneous linear second order partial differential equation and analytical solutions
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 92
are often difficult to obtain. Instead, an approach solving a system of equations
from Maxwells equations is proposed in a similar method to [66].
The Cauchy-Riemann equations form the cornerstone of complex analysis and
determine whether a function is analytic and holomorphic [67]. An analytic func-
tion is defined as a function that is infinitely differentiable [68]. Additionally, a
function that is also analytic in the complex plane is said to be holomorphic and
these have found a multitude of applications in physics and applied mathemat-
ics [69]. The Cauchy-Riemann equations in 2 dimensions are written as
xfp  yfq = 0, (4.1)
xfp + yfq = 0. (4.2)
Cross differentiating these equations allows the Laplace equation to be obtained
2f = 0, (4.3)
where the Laplace operator is defined as 2 = 2x + 2y . The Laplace equation
occurs throughout the theory of electromagnetism, heat theory and gravitational
theory [70]. A general solution to the Laplace equation in 2 dimensions can be
found by introducing the complex variables u and v, which are written as
u = x+ iy, v = x iy. (4.4)
Transforming equations 4.1 and 4.2 to the complex coordinates yields a general
solution in terms of holomorphic functions that satisfy the Laplace equation 4.3.
The coordinate transformation of the Laplace equation yields
2uvf = 0,
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 93
and the general solution to equation 4.3 is given by
f = g(u) + h(v), (4.5)
where g and h are arbitrary functions of u and v only. This approach can be
further extended to n dimensions by introducing hypercomplex coordinates [71
73]. These hypercomplex coordinates in n dimensions are written as
jxj, w =
jxj, (4.6)
where j and j may be complex constants, n is the number of dimensions and xj
is the real coordinate. Considering the n dimensional Laplace equation, namely
2nf = 0,
and for simplicity considering that f is a function of one hypercomplex coordinate
w only, transforming to the new coordinate using the chain rule gives
xjf = xjwf
2xjf = 
wf  + (xjw)
2f ,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument. Substitut-
ing these results into the n dimensional Laplace equation gives,
2f =
2xjwf
This yields the same result as ref [7173]. Furthermore this gives two conditions
that need to be satisfied to ensure that f satisfies the Laplace equation. These
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 94
conditions are,
2xjw = 0,
(xjw)
2 = 0. (4.7)
The first condition states that w must be a particular solution of the Laplace
equation. The second condition states that the square of the sum of the coeffi-
cients j must be equal to zero. This method of solving the Laplace equation
using the hypercomplex coordinates can also be applied to solve the homogeneous
wave equation. The wave equation is similar to the Laplace equation in terms
of structure, but has positive spatial dimensions and a negative time-like dimen-
sion giving a Lorentzian signature (+,+,+,), whereas the Laplace equation
including time has both positive space and time components giving a Euclidean
signature (+,+,+,+) [74]. These two equations can be related to one another
through the Wick rotation [75] by introducing an imaginary transformation of
the time component t = i . If the 4 dimensional wave equation is considered
 = 0,
where  is the DAlembertian operator  = 2x+2y+2z 1c2
t , then this equation
can be solved using the hypercomplex coordinate
w = t+ ix+ iy + iz. (4.8)
Then from equation 4.7, the constants must satisfy
2  2  2  2 = 0. (4.9)
The solutions to either the Laplace or wave equation can hence be transformed to
one another by a Wick rotation of the hypercomplex coordinates, w and w [75].
This changes the signature from Lorentzian to Euclidean.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 95
The higher-dimensional approach to obtaining holomorphic functions to the Laplace
and homogenous wave equations have long been known and have been studied in
depth over the years [76]. Whittaker and others developed a real n dimensional
general integral solution to the Laplace equation [7779], of which Penrose later
re-derived a more mathematically sophisticated complex contour integral [80].
The contour integral derived by Penrose has a geometrical interpretation. This
geometrical interpretation was used to found twistor theory. This theory was
originally developed in order to provide a framework for quantum gravity [81
83], but was later extended to describe twistor string theory [84]. Unfortunately
twistor theory has been unable to provide a framework to describe quantum
gravity, but the theory has had a significant impact on the field of mathematics,
especially in the areas of differential equations and integrable systems, as well
as in some areas of physics such as fluid dynamics [85, 86]. The real Whittaker
integral in 3 dimensions is written
F (z + ix cos+ iy sin, ) d, (4.10)
where , ,  and  are arbitrary constants [87]. The Penrose integral takes the
form shown in ref [8183] and is given by
g(w, )d,
where the function  = ei is the spinor coordinate and is closely related to
the  constant in the Whittaker integral. The Laplace equation is often found
in the theory of electromagnetism. In the next section, the general complex
contour integral solution to the Laplace equation and its relationship to Maxwells
equations are investigated.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 96
4.4 Application to Maxwells Equations
Maxwells equations containing only the electric field components can be written
in 2 dimensions, without any source term as
xEy  yEx = 0,
xEx + yEy = 0,
where Ex,y is the electric field. These equations are comparable to the Cauchy-
Riemann equations shown in equation 4.1 and 4.2. It is possible to use the general
solutions of the Laplace equation to seek solutions of Maxwells equations. A gen-
eral n dimensional approach is derived in the following section. This framework
will then be applied to describe the beam-beam interaction with an arbitrary
charge density distribution. Consider the following modified Cauchy-Riemann
equations in n dimensions as from ref [88],
ab,...,pqpEq = 0, (4.11)
pEp = , (4.12)
where ab,...,pq is the Levi-Civita symbol [89] written as
ab,...,pq =


+1 if (a, b, ..., p, q) is an even permutation of (1, 2, 3, ..., n)
1 if (a, b, ..., p, q) is an odd permutation of (1, 2, 3, ..., n)
0 otherwise.
(4.13)
If the inhomogeneous term  is set to zero, these equations reduce to the Cauchy-
Riemann equations in n dimensions and can be solved using traditional methods.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 97
If however  = 0, then in 2 or 3 dimensions these equations are comparable to
Maxwells equations with a non-zero source charge term. The regime in which
this source charge term is non-zero is of particular interest to problems involving
the beam-beam interaction, in which the counter rotating beam needs to be
considered. Solutions of E are sought by making an n dimensional ansatz with
a number of unconstrained functions. The ansatz takes the form
E(xj, ..., xn) = fj(xj, ..., xn) [1H(xj, ..., xn)] , (4.14)
where  = {x1, x2, ..., xj}, fj are unconstrained functions that need to be found
and H is a function that relates to the particular solution for a non-zero charge
density distribution  = 0. The function H is set to H = eH for the initial
derivation, since the beam-beam interaction is considered here. Introducing the
functional form of the particular solution that is comparable to a Gaussian dis-
tribution may further reduce the degrees of freedom and help to constrain the
system of equations. Non-Gaussian distributions are also considered later in the
chapter. Substituting the ansatz in equation 4.14 into equations 4.11 and 4.12
and collecting terms containing the function H gives two sets of equations to be
solved. These equations are
ab,...,pqpfq = 0, (4.15)
pfp = 0, (4.16)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 98
ab,...,pqfpqH = 0, (4.17)
pH = eH , (4.18)
where, once again, ab,...,pq is the Levi-Civita symbol [89], a, b, ..., p, q take values
between 0, 1, 2, ..., n, and n represents the number of dimensions. Tensor notation
is used here to express the curl operator such that when p and q take values from
1 to 2, equations 4.15 and 4.16 will reduce to the 2 dimensional Cauchy-Riemann
equations,
xfp  yfq = 0,
xfp + yfq = 0.
Hence, it can be seen that the first set of equations with the e0 terms are the
Cauchy-Riemann equations in n dimensions and upon cross differentiation and
substitution can be shown to give the n dimensional Laplace equation. The n
dimensional Laplace equation is given as
2nfj = 0. (4.19)
The functions f1, ..., fn will satisfy the Laplace equation and can be solved by
introducing the hypercomplex coordinate
w =  + i, w =   i, (4.20)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 99
where  and  take the form  = nxn and  =
j jxj. Thus the general
solution for each of the functions fj can be written as,
fj = gj(w) + hj(w), (4.21)
under the condition that,
a2n +
i22j = 0. (4.22)
Substituting these functions back into the homogenous Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions allows transformations between all the functions fj to be found. All the
functions fj, can be expressed in terms of just one function, labelled f1. The
transformation between the functions are given by a linear combination of the
complex constants j and j. The general solution to f1 is hence written as,
f1 = c1g(w) + c1h(w), (4.23)
with the remaining functions fj given by,
fj = cjg(w) + cjh(w), (4.24)
where c1,2,..,j are linear functions of j obtained from the hypercomplex coordi-
nates 4.20. The first set of e0 equations have been solved and yield solutions
to the Laplace equation that in turn can be used to further constrain the equa-
tions in the eH set. The homogenous equation in the eH set of equations can be
solved through the method of characteristics [90], if the Jacobian of the system
is defined. The Jacobian can be written as

w w
w w
 = {0,} . (4.25)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 100
This can be seen to be true in general by using the hypercomplex coordinate 4.20.
Substituting the hypercomplex coordinates 4.20, gives the Jacobian as
J  2i. (4.26)
Transforming equation 4.17 to the complex coordinates (w, w), substituting all
the functions fj in terms of just one function f1, and applying the method of char-
acteristics allows the relationship betweenH and the functions fj to be found. For
a full description and discussion of the method of characteristics see appendix A.
Applying the method of characteristics yields a system of ordinary differential
equations to be solved, namely
fpdp + fqdq = 0, (4.27)
when p = q. This gives the functional form of H in terms of the general solutions
to the Laplace equation
H = H
gdw +
. (4.28)
The method of characteristics used here also introduces a geometric relation be-
tween the functions H, g and h. This states that functions fj must lie orthogonal
to the characteristic surface H.
Equation 4.28 gives the relationship between the general solutions to the Laplace
equation, denoted by the functions f and g, and the particular solution H. How-
ever, in order to find the particular solution, equation 4.18 must be solved. Trans-
forming equation 4.12 to hypercomplex coordinates and substituting all the func-
tions fj in terms of f1, yields after simplification,
gk(w)hk(w)
, (4.29)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 101
where  is a combination of the constants i and  is the source charge term.
This can be further split into integrals using the functional form of H,
wH = gH
wH = hH
This gives the two separate integral equations as
H = 
h(w)
dw, (4.30)
wHe
H = 
dw. (4.31)
This is as far as the system of equations can be reduced without introducing the
source charge term  and the functions g and h. The functions g and h can be
expressed in a general form as contour integral solutions that satisfy the Laplace
equation [7779, 8183], namely,
g(w, )d, h =
h(w, )d. (4.32)
Equations 4.30 and 4.31 can be solved independently of one another. Importantly,
these equations establish a relationship between the solutions to the Laplace
equation and the inhomogeneous term , in terms of a complex contour integral.
In 3 or more dimensions this contour integral gives the particular solution over a
complex surface.
In summary, the set of equations 4.15 to 4.18 have been solved with the aim of
keeping the expressions and conditions as general as possible before introducing
a specific form of . The first set of equations are the Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions and therefore Laplace equations can be derived from these. The Laplace
equations can be solved by introducing the functions g and h, which are contour
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 102
integral functions of the hypercomplex coordinates w and w, respectively. Since
these functions also satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations they are analytic and
holomorphic. The second set of equations relate the general Laplace equations
to the particular solution H. The homogenous equation in this set of equations
was re-written in terms of the hypercomplex coordinates and solved using the
method of characteristics. This allows the functional form of H to be obtained.
Finally the inhomogeneous equation is expressed in terms of the hypercomplex
coordinates and the functions g and h are related to the function H and the
source charge term . The full system of equations have been left with just the
inhomogeneous equation to be solved in terms of the , g and h.
In the next section, the method described above is applied to the 2 dimensional
transverse Gaussian bunch and the well known round bunch electric field is re-
derived based on the new method. The framework is then applied to alternative,
non-exponential, non-linear charge density distributions and the electric fields are
compared to the literature.
4.5 2 Dimensional Gaussian Bunch
To ensure that the method derived in section 4.3 is valid, the mathematical
method was used to derive the standard round Gaussian bunch electric field [16].
Initially considering the hypercomplex coordinate given by expression 4.20 and
setting n = 2 gives
w = 1x+ i2y, w = 1x i2y,
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 103
where the constants must satisfy condition 4.22, hence
21  
2 = 0. (4.33)
From inspection it can be seen that 1 = 1 and 2 = 1. The hypercomplex
coordinates become the standard complex coordinates,
w = x+ iy, , w = x iy. (4.34)
Working in the rest frame of the bunch to negate any magnetic fields yields an
electrostatic problem. Within this limit, equations 4.15 and 4.16 in 2 dimensions
reduce to
xf2  yf1 = 0, (4.35)
xf1 + yf2 = 0. (4.36)
f1yH  f2xH = 0, (4.37)
f1xH + f2yH = eH . (4.38)
The e0 set of equations are the Cauchy-Riemann conditions and show that f1
and f2 must be holomorphic and analytic. Cross differentiating equations 4.35
and 4.36 yields two Laplace equations in terms of f1 and f2.
2f1 = 0, 2f2 = 0.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 104
Equations 4.5 can be satisfied using the general solution to the Laplace equation,
which can be written in terms of two separable functions g1,2 and h1,2. The
functions g1,2 contain the complex coordinate w only and h1,2 contains w only.
The Laplace equations for f1,2 are solved in the form
f1 = g1(w) + h1(w), (4.39)
f2 = g2(w) + h2(w). (4.40)
Substituting 4.39 and 4.40 into equations 4.35 and 4.36, results in a complex
linear transformation relating the functions f1 and f2. The function f1 is related
to f2 through
f1 = g + h, (4.41)
f2 = ig  ih, (4.42)
where the subscript is now dropped such that g1 = g and h1 = h. This solves the
Cauchy-Riemann equations in f1,2. Considering next, the homogenous equation
in the eH set. Equation 4.37 can be solved via the method of characteristics.
This gives
, (4.43)
which yields the ordinary differential equation
f1dx+ f2dy = 0. (4.44)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 105
Transforming to the new coordinates and substituting the expressions for f1 and
f2 in terms of g and h, gives the functional form for H as
H = H
gdw +
. (4.45)
This leaves the inhomogeneous equation to be solved. Transforming to complex
coordinates and substituting f1,2 into equation 4.38 gives
gwH + hwH = 
. (4.46)
Using the functional form of H and differentiating, allows the expressions for
wH and wH to be used. These expressions are
wH = H
g, wH = H
which results in the final inhomogeneous equation, which can be simplified to,
g(w)h(w)
. (4.47)
This equation can be separated into two integrals that can be solved indepen-
dently of one another. These equations are
eH = 
h(w)
eH = 
dw.
The equations can be simplified no further without the functions g and h. These
functions are general solutions to the Laplace equation and can hence be obtained
through either the Penrose or Whittaker integral. The integral over the complex
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 106
coordinate can be solved to give
, f2 =
, (4.48)
where r =
x2 + y2. Substituting complex coordinates for x and y, and simpli-
fying yields
. (4.49)
Thus from inspection, the functions g and h are
, h =
. (4.50)
Now that both g and h have been obtained, the inhomogeneous equation can
be solved. The inhomogeneous equation given by equation 4.47 relates these
functions g and h to the particular solution of Poissons equation, H. The integral
to evaluate is
eH = 
e4wwdw.
This integral can be evaluated trivially and gives H as
H = 
r2, (4.51)
where r =
x2 + y2. The complete system of equations has now been solved and
the functions f1, f2 and H have been constrained in terms of the charge density
distribution . Substituting the functions f1,2 and H back into the original ansatz
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 107
for the electric field gives the well known function form, as shown in [16] as
1 e
, (4.52)
1 e
. (4.53)
This method has provided an alternative approach to deriving the electric fields
in the rest frame of the bunch. Using analytic expressions from the Laplace
equation and the relationship of these functions to the source charge term allows
the complete system of equations to be constrained allowing the electric field to
be derived in a compact and concise manner. To obtain the beam-beam kick
a Lorentz boost is applied in the direction of movement and the force applied
to a counter rotating test particle is calculated. Since the method was derived
for an arbitrary charge density distribution and the hypercomplex coordinates
can be written in n dimensions, the method can easily be extended to include
higher dimensions and can include complicated coupling in the charge density
distribution. These aspects will be discussed in the following sections.
4.5.1 Non-Linear Distributions
The method of unconstrained functions described above is not necessarily limited
to studying beam-beam effects and can also be applied to space charge. Space
charge occurs when particles within a bunch exhibit an electric field on them-
selves [91]. This electric field can be calculated in the same way as the beam-beam
interaction, by solving Poissons equation. Beam-beam effects in the LHC occur
at a flat top energy of 6.5 TeV and the electric fields are almost entirely confined
to the transverse planes, since the bunches are within the ultra-relativistic limit.
Space charge effects at flat top energy in the LHC can be considered to be negli-
gible. However, in machines operating at lower energies, space charge effects will
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 108
impact performance. Space charge effects, much like the beam-beam interaction
can lead to emittance growth, which can limit machine performance and bunch
lifetimes [17]. Much like the LHC, understanding and accurately modelling such
effects is vital to assess machine performance and identify possible issues during
operation. In this section, the electric fields generated by non-linear distribu-
tions prevalent in the space charge literature are re-derived using the method of
unconstrained functions.
The Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (KV), waterbag, and parabolic distributions are
distributions that have been studied with regard to space charge [92]. The
dynamics of non-linear bunches with space charge has been considered exten-
sively [91, 93]. The method of unconstrained functions will be used to derive the
electric field for non-linear distributions of the form
xy
, (4.54)
where depending on the value of m, this distribution yields a number of non-
linear distributions [92]. When m = 1, expression 4.54 takes the form of the KV
distribution, for m = 2, this distribution is called the Waterbag distribution, and
finally, when m = 3, the distribution is parabolic.
As an example, the parabolic distribution is considered. For a 2 dimensional
round bunch of the form 4.54, with m = 3, gives the charge density distribution
pb(x, y) =
1 x2  y2
, (4.55)
where the term outside the bracket represents the line density and x and y are in
number of sigma. Normalising to the line density, transforming to the complex
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 109
coordinates,
x = w + w, y = i(w  w),
gives
pb(w, w) = (1 4ww)2. (4.56)
The inhomogeneous equation in 2 dimensions is given by equation 4.47 and re-
placing the exponent eH with the general function H yields the two separable
modified equations,
H = 
wdw, (4.57)
H = 
wdw. (4.58)
As a 2 dimensional bunch is being considered, then the result from section 4.5
can be exploited and the functional form of H relating the Laplace solutions
to the particular solution can be used. Using expression 4.45 and choosing the
integration over w (although the choice of integration does not vary the resulting
form) and substituting the charge density distribution gives
H = 
(1 4ww)2dw. (4.59)
Performing the integration over w gives H in the form of equation 4.60,
H = 
(1 4ww)3
. (4.60)
Transforming back to real Cartesian coordinates, substituting f1,2 from the 2
dimensional solution to the Laplace equation, and H into the adjusted ansatz,
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 110
written as,
E(x, y) = f(x, y) [1H] ,
yields the electric field in the x and y plane as,
(1 r2)3
, (4.61)
(1 r2)3
. (4.62)
This gives the same functional form as seen in ref [92], when x2 + y2  2 and
is within some constant scaling factor. Note, that the choice of the constants 1
and 2 is arbitrary, however these must satisfy condition 4.22. The method of
unconstrained functions can also be applied to higher dimensional cases. In the
next section, the method of unconstrained functions will be applied to find the
electric field of a 3 dimensional Gaussian charge density distribution. The results
will be compared to the literature.
4.6 3 Dimensional Gaussian Bunch
One of the benefits of the method of unconstrained functions is that the frame-
work is based on the hypercomplex coordinates and can be extended to any
number of dimensions. The method of unconstrained functions can be applied
to higher dimensional problems, in which solutions to the Laplace equation via
the Greens function method may become challenging. Extending to an n dimen-
sional space does however present difficulties when considering odd dimensional
complex surfaces, such as the case for 3 dimensions [94]. To effectively describe a
3 dimensional complex surface an additional geometrical interpretation must be
considered [81, 82, 94]. This geometrical interpretation, although interesting, can
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 111
be avoided by not relying on the hypercomplex coordinates to solve the system
of equations given by 4.15 to 4.18. Instead, if a solution to the Laplace equation
can be generated through the Whittaker solution or the Penrose integral, this can
be used to constrain the entire system of equations and still find solutions in the
presence of a charge density distribution, without requiring that the functions
g and h are completely separable. For a 3 dimensional electric field in the rest
frame of the bunch Maxwells equations take the form,
yEz  zEy = 0, (4.63)
xEz  zEx = 0, (4.64)
xEy  yEx = 0, (4.65)
xEx + yEy + zEz = (x, y, z). (4.66)
The ansatz given by expression 4.14 can be written as
E(x, y, z; t) = fj(x, y, z; t)
1 eH(x,y,z;t)
, (4.67)
for j = 1, 2, 3 and  = {x, y, z}. Using the 3 dimensional ansatz will result in the
system of equations given by 4.15 to 4.18 for n = 3 becoming
yf3  zf2 = 0, (4.68)
xf3  zf1 = 0, (4.69)
xf2  yf1 = 0, (4.70)
xf1 + yf2 + zf3 = 0. (4.71)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 112
f2zH  f3yH = 0, (4.72)
f1zH  f3xH = 0, (4.73)
f1yH  f2xH = 0, (4.74)
f1xH + f2yH + f3zH = eH . (4.75)
The first set of equations in e0 are the Cauchy-Riemann equations in 3 dimensions
and hence Laplace equations. The 3 dimensional solution to the Laplace equation
can be obtained using [95] and is given as
, f2 =
, f3 =
, (4.76)
where r =
x2 + y2 + z2. This provides solutions to the first e0 set of equa-
tions without requiring a transformation to the hypercomplex coordinates and
a separation of the coordinates. Substituting the solutions given in 4.76 into
equations 4.72, 4.73 and 4.74 gives equations 4.77 to 4.79,
yzH  zyH = 0, (4.77)
xzH  zxH = 0, (4.78)
yxH  xyH = 0. (4.79)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 113
Since the r term has cancelled, these equations can be solved using the method
of characteristics allowing the functional form of H in terms of f1,2,3 to be deter-
mined. This gives H as
H = H
ydy +
H = H
. (4.80)
The Laplace solutions given by 4.76 have fixed the relationship to the characteris-
tic surfaceH. Finally, to obtain the exact form ofH, the inhomogeneous equation
in terms of the charge density distribution  must be solved. Substituting f13
into equation 4.75 gives
= eH ; (4.81)
collecting terms and simplifying yields
= re
This leaves one integration over r to be evaluated. Integrating equation 4.6 over
r, yields a direct relationship between r and H, which is given by,
eH = e
r2 . (4.82)
This gives the form for eH which can be substituted into the ansatz. Hence, the
electric field written in component form is
1 e
, (4.83)
1 e

1 e

Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 114
These expressions derived here can be compared directly to the alternative deriva-
tion through Poissons equation detailed in Ref [25]; this is shown in figure 4.1.
The functional form of the electric field is equivalent to [25] for a particle with no
transverse offset and restricted to Ez(0, 0, z). The solutions are equivalent in the
absence of any coupling between the planes. The method of unconstrained func-

tions as detailed earlier in the chapter has been applied to a 3 dimensional charge
density distribution without requiring a complex coordinate transformation. In-
stead the system of equations were constrained by obtaining the 3 dimensional
solutions to the Laplace equation through the general solution provided by Whit-
taker/Penrose integral. The solution to the Laplace equation has allowed the
system to be constrained in a similar way to the 2 dimensional derivation. The
Laplace solutions constrain the relationship to the particular solution of Poissons
equation, allowing the functional form of the particular solution to be obtained
through the method of characteristics. Finally, the functional form of H and the
Laplace solutions were used to solve the inhomogeneous equation containing the
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 115
charge density distribution , allowing the electric field in the rest frame of the
bunch to be obtained. This method has so far been applied to simple distribu-
tions without any coupling. In the final section of this chapter, a first attempt
approach of describing the hourglass effect using the method of unconstrained
functions is discussed along with analysis and discussion.
4.7 The Hourglass Effect: A First Approach
The beam-beam interaction is a strong dynamic effect in which the electric
and magnetic fields produced by the proton bunch will cause the charge density
distribution of the counter rotating bunch to vary throughout the interaction. For
most cases in the LHC, the standard fixed Gaussian charge density distribution
provides an accurate description of the beam-beam interaction, as the bunches
can be considered to be ultra-relativistic and with negligible coupling between
the planes. However as the high energy community demands for more luminosity
increases, the machine performance must be pushed. To obtain more luminosity,
the strength of the beam-beam interaction and its impact on performance is likely
to increase. To produce more luminosity the bunches must be squeezed more at
the IP or the bunch population must be increased. Squeezing the bunch more
can lead to bunch length and coupling effects which can no longer be ignored [62].
These effects can cause a drop in luminosity at the IP since the bunches may not
collide at the minimum -function. The luminosity for a head-on colliding bunch
including offset and crossing angle is discussed in detail in chapter 2. From the
discussion presented there, the luminosity can be written as
N1N2frevNbunch
4xy
F (, z),
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 116
where the function F (, z) is the geometric loss factor. The loss factor in the
LHC during normal operation is about F (, z) = 0.80 [61]. The components
required to calculate this factor are usually obtained during machine operations
and dedicated experiments, or through numerical computation. The luminosity
reduction due to the hourglass effect can be included in this loss factor. The
hourglass effect is not well understood analytically and often requires computa-
tionally expensive calculations. An analytical expression describing the hourglass
effect could significantly improve computation speed of the beam-beam effect in
simulation. An analytical expression including the hourglass effect could greatly
benefit computational speed for both tracking codes such as Sixtrack and multi-
bunch and particle strong-strong simulation codes such as combi. Particle in cell
methods for strong-strong simulations can be time consuming, especially when
trying to simulate many bunches [32].
The method of unconstrained functions can be applied to the problem of the
hourglass effect to find analytical expressions for the electric fields, in the pres-
ence of a complicated charge density distribution. The hourglass effect causes a
parabolic behaviour in the transverse bunch size. This parabolic effect arises due
to the change of -function with the distance from the collision point and couples
the transverse bunch size to the longitudinal position [16]. The hourglass effect
arises when the transverse bunch size becomes comparable to the length of the
bunch r  z. The -function will vary over the interaction length and depend
on the longitudinal position. The  variation about the IP can be written as
(z) = 
. (4.86)
This will cause the transverse bunch size to vary though the IP as
. (4.87)
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 117
Figure 4.2 shows the variation of the transverse bunch size (r) as a function
of the longitudinal position towards the collision point at z = 0. The bunch
size varies parabolically away from the IP. For smaller values of , the larger
the variation of the bunch size with longitudinal position. One possible optics
option for the HL-LHC is to use a flat bunch. If this choice of optics is chosen
and luminosity levelling is performed by reducing  in steps, the final step of the
luminosity levelling will have x,y = 0.150/0.075m. The final step leaves the 
the vertical plane comparable to the length of the bunch, resulting in the vertical
plane varying following equation 4.87. In this scenario, the bunch length effects
will no longer be negligible and could impede luminosity performance. In order
to understand the impact from the perspective of the beam dynamics, this effect
needs to be understood. The variation around the IP will result in a different
electric field, since the bunch will not remain a fixed Gaussian throughout the
interaction. The charge density distribution including the parabolic variation

observe an approximately Gaussian charge density distribution and hence the
electric fields these particles experience will be largely unchanged. For particles
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 118
at larger amplitudes, the charge density distribution deviates significantly from
the standard Gaussian distribution and behaves comparatively like a bi-Gaussian
distribution. The electric fields that these particles experience may no longer be
well described by the fixed Gaussian distribution from the literature [16]. The

charge density distribution including the transverse bunch size coupling to the
longitudinal position in Cartesian coordinates can be written as
(x, y, z) = n exp
22x(1 +
22y(1 +
. (4.88)
For an axially symmetric round bunch, polar coordinates can be introduced and
will transform the charge density distribution to,
(r, z) = n exp
22r(1 +
. (4.89)
Following this, the hypercomplex coordinates w and w can also be recast in terms
of the polar coordinates. The Cartesian coordinates in terms of the hypercomplex
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 119
coordinates are
x = 1(w + w), y = 2(w + w), z = 3(w  w),
where the complex constants are 1 =
, 2 =
and 3 = i. The polar
coordinate transformation to complex coordinates will be given by,
(w + w)2, z = i(w  w). (4.90)
The charge density distribution including the hourglass effect is given by equa-
tion 4.89 and hence the method of unconstrained functions can be used to ob-
tain an analytical expression of the electric field in the rest frame of the bunch.
Whether the charge density distribution can be obtained in closed form depends
on the integration of the source charge term. Since the derivation is in 2 dimen-
sions, the initial steps detailed in section 4.5 can be applied. Starting from the 2
dimensional inhomogeneous equation,
g(w)h(w)
, (4.91)
then the integrals can be separated using
H  =
H  =
wH.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 120
Substituting the equation 4.89 into the inhomogeneous equation 4.91, gives the
following two integrals
eH = 
 (w + w)2
1 (ww)
) + (w  w)2
dw, (4.92)
eH = 
 (w + w)2
1 (ww)
) + (w  w)2
dw. (4.93)
Note that the choice of integral is arbitrary and both will yield the same functional
form of eH . The two integrals in fact correspond to different hemispheres of the
Riemann sphere; however this is beyond the scope of this thesis. More details can
be found in [81, 82, 94]. Either one of these integrals will provide the function eH .
The charge density distribution including the hourglass effect can be re-written
in the form
hg = n exp
(w2 + w2)
(w, w)
 2ww
(w, w)
, (4.94)
where  =
1 (ww)
and the complex coordinates are in units of the bunch
sigma. If (w, w) = 1, then there is no coupling between the bunch planes
and the Gaussian bunch expression in complex coordinates is re-obtained as in
section 4.5. Unfortunately, this integral is not trivial and it is unlikely that a
closed form expression can be found. There are two possible options to proceed;
initially an expansion to a required order can be made around small values of the
complex coordinates w and w. This will provide a good approximation for small
values of w and w. Realistically, only small order terms can be evaluated as each
higher order term will require multiple integration by parts. Small order terms
will however likely contain the most dominant terms from the charge density
distribution. This will allow the model to be evaluated to some degree. The
second option is to evaluate the integral numerically providing an exact solution
to the integral. Both approaches will be attempted and the two results compared.
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 121
Firstly, the expansion of the exponential function is discussed. Selecting equa-
tion 4.92 and expanding around the complex coordinates w provides an area in
complex space in which the analyticity of the function will be preserved. However,
H will not be analytic throughout all of w and w and will be limited to when the
complex coordinates are small. The Taylor expansion of the exponential function
can be written as
e =
()n
e  1  +
4 +O(5),
where  is the argument of the exponential shown in equation 4.94 and  is a
constant coefficient of . Substituting the expansion into equation 4.92 yields
eH = 
1  +
4 +O(5)
dw. (4.95)
These integrals can then be treated by splitting into separate integrals labelled
I0, I1, I2 respectively, with the subscripts denoting the polynomial order of the
function. Considering integrals up to second order gives the following integrals
to evaluate,
I0 = 
1dw, I1 =
dw, I2 = 
()2dw.
The first integral, I0 is trivial is
I0 = 
. (4.96)
This is the same result as when there is no coupling present, or when  = 1. The
effect of the coupling will be retained in the higher order moments of the distri-
bution. The remaining integrals I1 and I2 are not trivial and require integration
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 122
by parts. Consider the integral I1 first leaving the w22 outside and integrating
gives
+ w2w
+ w2w
dw...
w2w
w2w  w(1)dw. (4.97)
From the integration by parts it can be seen that the integral cannot be evaluated
in closed form. Upon each iteration of the integration, additional integrals arise,
which in turn need to be evaluated by parts. Evaluating the most dominant terms
up to second order allows the electric field including the coupling in the charge
density distribution to be analysed. Taking the expression for H and substituting
into the ansatz in equation 4.14 gives
r2 + z2
[1 (I0(r, z) + I1(r, z) ...)] , (4.98)
r2 + z2
[1 (I0(r, z) + I1(r, z) ...)] . (4.99)
The radial electric field in the rest frame of the bunch including the additional
coupling in the charge density distribution is shown in figure 4.4. In figure 4.4,
the radial electric field is shown for particles along various longitudinal positions
in the bunch. Particles with a large value of z have a smaller radial electric field
profile compared to particles with a small longitudinal displacement which have
a short, sharp radial electric field profile.
From figure 4.4, the radial electric field profile for a particle at z1 corresponding
to a small z undergoes a large electric field around r = 0. However the radial
electric field tends to zero quickly towards larger amplitudes. For a particle
located at z4 , which corresponds to a large value of z, the electric field is much
more sustained between 1  r  1, although the total magnitude of the field
is much smaller than the z1 case. Similarly to the previously mentioned case,
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 123
the electric field falls to zero quickly towards larger radial amplitudes. For radial

amplitudes that are considerably larger, the electric field will diverge as the Taylor
expansion of the hourglass function diverges. Qualitatively, the electric field
behaves in a similar way as the standard fixed Gaussian distribution. There is
however an imaginary component to the field. On closer inspection the magnitude
of the imaginary part of the field is of the order of 1021 and can hence be
negated. Initial investigation of the distribution does not appear to show any
significant deviation of the functional form from the fixed Gaussian model. The
comparison between the Gaussian distribution and the hourglass distribution
will be considered later. To determine the impact of the higher order terms on
the distribution, the integral is also evaluated numerically and compared to the
expansion. This will signify how well the expansion represents the integral.
4.7.0.1 Numerical Integration of the Hourglass Exponential
As previously shown, the integral cannot be evaluated in closed form. Instead the
integral was evaluated numerically using global adaptive quadrature to determine
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 124
an approximate value of the integration [96, 97]. The integral has a defined
range in the complex planes w, w between 0  1 as shown in figure 4.5. Values
outside of this range 0  {w, w}  1, diverge and tend to infinity. Using this

numerical integration and substitution in place of eH allows the accuracy of the
Taylor expansion used in the previous section to be evaluated. A comparison
between the numerical integration and the expansion is shown in figure 4.6. The
difference between the two curves is approximately 4% with the higher order
terms reducing the electric field profile with respect to the expansion towards
larger radial amplitudes. The difference accounts for the higher order terms that
are neglected from the expansion. The higher order terms reduce the value the
electric field as r  . At small values of r however the agreement is very good
as these terms are well accounted for during the expansion. To determine the
impact of the hourglass effect on the electric field, a direct comparison between
the fixed Gaussian distribution and the distribution including the hourglass effect
is discussed in the next section.

4.7.0.2 Comparison to the Fixed Gaussian Model
In order to determine the impact of the coupled charge density distribution on
the electric field profile, the analytical expansion of the electric field including
the hourglass coupling in the charge density distribution is directly compared to
the fixed Gaussian expression. The radial and longitudinal electric field profiles
for the two charge density distributions are shown in figure 4.7 and figure 4.8.
The radial electric fields shown in figure 4.7 compares well towards larger radial
amplitudes as the field tends to zero at . At smaller radial amplitudes however,
there is some difference between the two field profiles. The coupling between the
planes in the charge density distribution appears to have an effect on the small
amplitude particles. For these particles, the linear part of the field is stronger
in comparison to the electric field caused by the fixed Gaussian charge density
distribution. The linear part of the electric field also acts over a smaller region
of r. This implies that more particles in the bunch at a particular longitudinal
position will experience a non-linear electric field. For particles at radial ampli-
tudes r > 3, the long-range effect of both electric fields are almost identical and

4.8 Discussion
The purpose of this chapter was to address the difficulties in deriving analytical
solutions when the charge density distribution is coupled. As the LHC and HL-
LHC strives to push luminosity performance, effects such as the hourglass effect
will become more significant. Therefore in order to evaluate the impact on the
dynamics, numerical evaluation is often required. This will require large compu-
tational resources in order to evaluate the effect, since an analytical expression is
not available. Throughout this chapter, a mathematical framework for obtaining
analytical expressions based on complex coordinate transforms and contour in-
tegrals has been derived. The first section introduces the required fundamentals
of complex analysis in order to derive the mathematical framework. Initially the
2 dimensional Cauchy-Riemann equations are stated and from these the Laplace
equation is derived. The Laplace equation is shown to be solved analytically
through a complex coordinate transformation, with the general solution to the
Laplace equation shown in 2 dimensions, expressed as two arbitrary functions g
and h. The solution to the Laplace equation is further generalised to n dimensions
by introducing the hypercomplex coordinates given by equation 4.20, along with
the corresponding conditions 4.22. Not only this, but a connection between the
hypercomplex coordinates satisfying the Laplace equation and the wave equation
can be made through a Wick rotation. The Wick transformation is not used
for the work in this thesis as the derivations of the electric field are performed
in the rest frame of the bunch, however, this connection maybe useful for other
problems. These generalised hypercomplex coordinates are then applied to the
scenario when one of the Cauchy-Riemann equations is no longer homogeneous.
A solution to the modified Cauchy-Riemann equations with an inhomogeneous
term  can be found by introducing the ansatz given by expression 4.14. This
ansatz contains a number of unknown functions labelled f1,...,n and a function H
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 128
that corresponds to the particular solution of Poissons equation. Substituting
the ansatz into the n dimensional modified Cauchy-Riemann equations allows
a system of equations to be obtained. The first set of equations contain only
fj and are the standard Cauchy-Riemann equations. From these expressions
the n dimensional Laplace equation can be derived. The functions f1,...,n are
transformed to new hypercomplex coordinates and are shown to be holomorphic
functions that satisfy the Laplace equation. This provides solutions for the first
set of equations. In the second set of equations the homogeneous equation is
approached first. This can be solved through the method of characteristics and
relates the general solution of the Laplace equation to the particular solution
of Poissons equation. From the method of characteristics, the functional form
of H is calculated and contains the holomorphic functions f1,...,n. Finally, only
the equation that contains the inhomogeneous term  remains. Transforming
this final equation to the new hypercomplex coordinates and substituting the
functions f1,...,n, allows two independent equations to be obtained which need
to be solved. Simplifying this equation yields a direct relationship between the
general solution to the Laplace equation and the particular solution to Poissons
equation.
This provides the general mathematical framework that can allow analytical so-
lutions for a general charge density distribution to be obtained. The method is
then applied for a few different charge density distributions and the electric fields
were calculated. The electric fields recovered using this method agree with results
in the literature.
Finally the method was applied to a charge density distribution that included
the hourglass effect, which is characterised by a coupling of the transverse bunch
size to the longitudinal position. The electric field was obtained and evaluated
both numerically and through an expansion and the results compared. The new
Chapter 4. Analytical Expressions for the Beam-Beam Interaction 129
electric field expression was then compared to the standard fixed Gaussian case
and discussed.
This chapter concludes the theoretical investigation of the luminosity perfor-
mance in the LHC and its future upgrade the HL-LHC. In the following section,
experimental and simulation research is conducted with regard to the long-range
beam-beam interaction.
Chapter 5
The Long Range Beam-Beam
Limit in the LHC
5.1 Introduction
The long-range beam-beam interaction is one effect that will dictate luminosity
performance and the choice of operational parameters for the LHC [98]. This
chapter will discuss some of the relevant findings from two dedicated machine
studies that took place during the 2015 and 2016 proton physics run. In the first
section, a review of the long-range beam-beam effects and the impact of these
effects during luminosity production runs in the LHC is provided. Then in the
following section, luminosity observations during the 2012 LHC run are discussed,
which provides the motivation for the study. Since this chapter discusses the
luminosity decay, a number of the different luminosity decay models are discussed.
Then the results from two dedicated machine studies, which took place in 2015
and 2016, are introduced. The machine study procedures will be discussed in
chronological order with the 2015 study results presented first. The intensity,
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 131
luminosity, and emittance during the study is analysed and the long-range beam-
beam limit is determined. The impact of the long-range beam-beam interaction
as a function of crossing angle and collision pattern is discussed and analysed.
In the 2015 machine study, the impact of chromaticity and Landau octupole
strength on the lifetimes are also reviewed.
The procedure and analysis from the 2016 machine study is then discussed in
the following section. The difference in optics and collision schemes between the
2015 and 2016 machine studies is highlighted. Again, the bunch by bunch in-
tensity and luminosity data is reviewed, as well as the emittances. The analysis
is summarised and the long-range beam-beam limit is identified. This provided
evidence and justification that the crossing angle in the LHC could be reduced
during normal operation without interference from the long-range beam-beam
interaction. Initial results from early fills at the reduced crossing angle are dis-
cussed and reviewed.
5.2 The Long Range Beam-Beam Limit in the
Summarising the discussion of beam-beam effects in chapter 2 and 3, the strength
of the long-range beam-beam interaction will be dependent on the normalised
beam separation in the drift space at the IP. The normalised beam separation
depends on the -function at the IP (denoted by ) the normalised emittance
n, the crossing angle  and the relativistic factor . The beam-beam separation
for small crossing angles within the paraxial limit (tan  ) can be written as
dsep 
. (5.1)
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 132
The strength of the long-range beam-beam interactions can be varied using the
parameters in equation 5.1. During long-range beam-beam machine studies, the
strength of the long-range beam-beam interaction is increased by reducing the
crossing angle . This reduces the beam-beam separation, dsep, which is mea-
sured in units of the RMS beam size and calculated using equation 5.1 [99]. To
provide a comparison to different configurations and for consistency, a normalised
separation in the drift space is used throughout this chapter.
Bunches in the LHC form trains that undergo combinations of head-on and
long-range beam-beam interactions, as discussed earlier in chapter 1 and 3. A
schematic of the collision configuration is shown in figure 5.1. All bunches in
the train will undergo head-on collisions, however bunches do experience differ-
ing numbers of long-range interactions depending on their position in the train.
The number of long-range interactions will depend on the filling scheme during
that particular time of operation. During the 2016 luminosity production run,
bunches in the train had 17 to 34 long-range beam-beam interactions per IP. This
means that the beam-beam effects will vary depending on the bunch position in
the train. The bunches not in the centre of the train, that have less than 34
long-range beam-beam interactions, are often called Pacman bunches. Pacman
bunches will exhibit different lifetime behaviour to those bunches in the centre
of the train. Pacman bunches at the front and end of the train had the smallest
number of collisions with 17 interactions. The number of long-range beam-beam
interactions increases for bunches towards the centre of the train up to 33 in-
teractions per IP. The bunches in the centre of the train with the most number
of head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions are called nominal bunches,
and these bunches experience 34 interactions per IP. The number of head-on and
long-range interactions for a bunch during a typical luminosity production fill is
shown in figure 5.2, with the long-range pattern for a single train isolated and
shown in figure 5.3. In figure 5.3, the long-range pattern can be observed clearly,

beam effects depend on the beam separation, dsep, which will allow the necessary
margins to be defined in terms of separation and parameter choices for the LHC.
The motivation for this chapter is reviewed in the next section.

5.2.1 Motivation
During the 2012 LHC run, the optics, operational parameters and relatively small
beam-beam separations of 9.5  to 12.5  lead to strong beam-beam interactions.
This was characterised by a large beam-beam parameter of approximately bb =
0.007 per IP. This coupled with high Landau octupole and chromaticity settings,
resulted in beam-beam effects that had a significant impact on the beam and
luminosity lifetimes. This dependence was most strongly observed in the first
hour of luminosity production fills during 2012 operations. This can be seen
clearly in figure 5.4, which shows the luminosity decay rate,  = 1
as a function
of the bunch position along the train, where there is a sensitivity to the tune
spread at IP2 and IP8 during the first hour of the fill. In order to retain long fill
lengths and reduce losses, the beam-beam separations were increased at IP2 and
IP8 [100].
Figure 5.4: Luminosity decay rate () dependence on the long-range beam-beam interaction during the 2012 LHC run [100]. The
lifetimes of the bunches depend strongly on the bunch position (or slot number) in the train and the luminosity decay rates are the
largest in the first two hours of the fill.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 136
A number of machine experiments were proposed with the aim of identifying the
minimum crossing angle achievable in the LHC for a defined optics [101103].
Reducing the crossing angle in steps increases the strength of the long-range
beam-beam interaction. With the beam-beam separation reduced, the impact
on the intensity and luminosity lifetimes can be observed and the operational
tolerances can be defined. Unlike the previous long-range beam-beam studies
undertaken at the LHC to determine luminosity reach, the lifetimes were observed
for 10-15 minutes at each crossing angle step during the 2015 and 2016 machine
studies. This allows the intensity losses to stabilise, resulting in the decay rates
over a period of time to recover to some converged value at each crossing angle
step. The long-range beam-beam interaction would eventually limit the recovery
of the decay rates measured at the previous crossing angle step. This could be
explained by the non-linearity of the long-range beam-beam interaction reducing
the dynamic aperture. This can cause particles to undergo chaotic and irregular
motion. It can also result in particles in the core of the bunch diffusing to the
tails where the particles can then be scraped off by the collimators. The non-
linearities of the long-range beam-beam interaction can cause these tails to be
replenished with particles from the core. Operationally it is beneficial from the
perspective of luminosity production to operate at the smallest possible crossing
angle. This will increase the geometric loss factor from crossing angle given by
)2 . (5.2)
The geometric factor increases with crossing angle as shown in figure 5.5. Op-
erating the machine at a smaller crossing angle does impact the strength of the
beam-beam interaction. As shown previously from equation 5.1, a smaller cross-
ing angle results in stronger long-range beam-beam effects, which in turn can
induce particle losses. To maximise luminosity production, the machine should
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 137
be operated at the smallest possible crossing angle before additional losses are ob-
served due to the long-range beam-beam interaction. This defines the long-range
beam-beam limit and the minimum beam-beam separation.

Discussed in the next section is a review of some of the luminosity decay models
that have been used for previous studies and at other accelerators.
5.2.2 Decay Models
A number of different models are available to describe luminosity and intensity
decay rates, some of these are described and summarised in [104] and references
therein. Here a few of the key models are reviewed and discussed to provide an
overview of the literature and previous attempts to model luminosity evolution
in colliding storage rings.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 138
5.2.2.1 Simple Exponential Decay
An effective method of fitting the decay of some function with time, i.e intensity or
luminosity, is the simple exponential model. The model provides a lot of freedom
in the fitting parameters with more complicated models often just variations of
this model. The simple exponential decay model is written as
N = N0e
t + c(t), (5.3)
where N is the parameter being studied i.e, intensity or luminosity,  is the decay
rate, which corresponds to the inverse of the lifetime  , t is the time, and c is
a non-zero constant that accounts for the fact that the bunch intensity does not
decay completely to zero. The constant in this case will tend to zero as the decay
time tends to infinity. An example of the fitting using the simple exponential
decay model applied to a single bunch is shown in Figure 5.6. The fitting describes
the decay well and is calculated using a least squares method [105, 106].

step. The right hand plot fig 5.27(b) shows the decay rate variation over
crossing angle when calculated at the beginning of the crossing angle step
compared to the end of the crossing angle step.
The simple c variable exponential decay model used in this chapter was found to
describe the intensity and luminosity decays well, during the long-range machine
studies and throughout luminosity production fills.
For the 2016 machine study, the fitting method was further refined to account
for the variation in calculated lifetime throughout each crossing angle step. The
decay rates were calculated using a similar method as in the previous machine
study by fitting equation 5.3 to the intensity or luminosity data; however unlike
the previous analysis, each crossing angle step was further divided into smaller
steps called segments. The decay model was fitted over each segment and the
value of  could be obtained as it varied throughout the crossing angle step. The
additional fitting would allow possible decay regimes to be identified throughout
each crossing angle. The variation of the decay rate  as a function of segment
is shown in figure 5.7. The first segment corresponds to the first initial min-
utes of the crossing angle step, whilst the last segment corresponds to the last
few minutes of the crossing angle step, with each crossing angle step lasting ap-
proximately 10  15 minutes. The decay rate can be seen to converge to some
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 140
final value. The decay rates quoted for the 2016 machine study and the 2016
luminosity production fills are the final converged values of .
5.2.2.2 Tevatron Model
One particular luminosity model that has had success is the Tevatron model [107].
This model was developed with the aim of characterising the luminosity decay
over long fill lengths, specifically with the aim of determining how the antiproton
intensity reduction impacted the luminosity burn-off . Three models were
derived and include a time dependency in the decay rate . The first two models
are essentially extensions to the simple exponential decay model, including a
time dependancy of various forms in . The second model allows a polynomial
dependence on the time dependence. The third and final variation of the model
is different to the simple exponential decay and includes a linear function of time.
The three models are given by
L(t) = L0e
 , (5.4)
L(t) = L0e
 tT (t) , (5.5)
L(t) = L0 
)x(t)
. (5.6)
In the second variation of the model T (t) = T0 + C1  tc2 and the four fitting
parameters L(0), T0, C1 and C2 are free variables. In the final model of the
luminosity, the function x(t) is written
x(t) = C3 + C4t, (5.7)
where once again, C3 and C4 are free variables. These models provide a number
of different options that could potentially describe the luminosity evolution in
the Tevatron. Out of the three models given by equations 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, the
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 141
luminosity stores in the Tevatron were best described by equation 5.5. Further
details of these models can be found in [104, 107] and the references therein.
5.2.2.3 Brightness Model
Similarly to the Tevatron model, the brightness model developed by X. Buffat also
includes a variation of the decay rate with time [104]. The decay rate variation
with time in this model is dependent on the brightness, which is closely related
to the luminosity of the bunch. The brightness of the bunches can be written as
82ij
, (5.8)
where ni,j is the number of particles in the bunch, i, j corresponds to beam 1
and beam 2 respectively and i,j is the emittance of bunch. The decay model can
then be separated into two distinct regimes given by
B(t) =
1+2
1 1
1+2
(tct)
1+2
, t < tc,
 ttc
1 , t > tc,
(5.9)
where 1,2 correspond to the two lifetimes of the processes, tc is the critical time
at which the decay rate changes from one regime to another, and Bc corresponds
to the brightness at the point of the regime change, B = B(tc). At t = tc the
transition from one decay regime to another is assumed to be instantaneous and
continuous such that there is no impact on the brightness from the transition
alone. The brightness of the bunch can be affected by a number of different
processes that act over different time scales. For example, a slow process such as
intra-beam scattering will act over a lifetime 1, whereas a fast process, such as
emittance growth due to close proximity of a resonance will have a significantly
smaller lifetime, 2. The brightness is also closely related to the luminosity,
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 142
allowing luminosity lifetimes to be obtained. The bunch luminosity is related to
the bunch brightness following L  B2.
The simple exponential model is used throughout the analysis here for simplicity
and speed of calculation. This model provides an accurate fit and calculation of
the decay rate, as shown in figure 5.6. Including the additional sub-fitting as used
in the 2016 machine study further refined the calculation, allowing the decay rate
variation over the duration of crossing angle step to be quantified, avoiding the
complexities involved with using the Tevatron or brightness models.
In the next section, the decay rates calculated by the simple exponential model
is applied to measured data from two dedicated long-range beam-beam machine
studies.
5.3 Results
In this section, the analysis from two dedicated long-range beam-beam machine
studies are presented and discussed. The impact with regard to luminosity pro-
duction and performance in the LHC is highlighted.
5.3.1 LHC 2012 Run: Long-Range Beam-Beam Effects In
Stable Beams
Throughout luminosity production fills during the 2012 LHC run, the lifetimes
depended strongly on the number of long-range beam-beam interactions. An
example fill from the 2012 LHC run was selected and analysed in ref [104], with
the worst lifetimes observed during the first hour of stable beams. This is shown
in figure 5.4. In order to observe which bunches had the worst lifetimes, the bunch
by bunch luminosity decay rate as a function of bunch number was investigated,
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 143
as seen in figure 5.8. Figure 5.9 shows the luminosity lifetime dependency of two

different bunch trains, with collisions at different IPs. Figure 5.9(a), shows a
bunch train with only collisions at IP1 and IP5. Here the lifetimes do not vary
strongly with the number of long-range beam-beam interactions. Figure 5.9(b)
shows the lifetimes for a train with additional collisions at IP2 and IP8. Here
there is a strong dependency on the long-range beam-beam interaction which
causes the lifetimes to reduce below 10 hours. The beam-beam contribution from
IP2 and IP8 are causing additional losses and effecting the luminosity lifetime.
The beam-beam separation during this fill at IP2 and IP8 was 10  and 12 
respectively. In order to make IP2 and IP8 transparent from the perspective of
the beam-beam interaction, the beam-beam separation was increased to > 26  at
IP2 and IP8, by increasing the crossing angle [100]. This crossing angle increase
and an emittance reduction from n = 3.75 m to n = 2.5 m, mitigated the
lifetime dependency on the long-range beam-beam interaction.

a train with no collisions at IP2 and IP8 and figure 5.9(b) shows a train with
collisions at IP2 and IP8.
During the 2015/6 run of the LHC, the lifetimes were well controlled and insta-
bilities were suppressed. A dedicated long-range beam-beam study was proposed
towards the end of the 2016 run, in order to identify the minimum beam-beam
separation at IP1 and IP5 and push the luminosity performance. This is discussed
in the next section.
5.3.2 Machine Study 1: LHC 2015
To identify the long-range beam-beam limit and the luminosity reach with the 80
cm  optics, a dedicated machine study was performed with a train of 48 bunches
per beam (fill 4368). These trains were injected and ramped up through the
standard physics operational cycle and collided at 6.5 TeV at IP1 and IP5 only.
The single train of 48 bunches was used to reflect nominal operation for luminosity
production in 2015. The first two bunches in the train were reference bunches,
with the first bunch only undergoing head on collisions and the second bunch
a non-colliding witness bunch. The rest of the bunches in the train experience
a combination of head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions depending on
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 145
the position along the bunch train. The nominal bunches in the centre of the
train underwent 34 long-range collisions per IP as seen in figure 5.10.

The crossing angle at IP1 and IP5 was then reduced simultaneously in steps.
Unlike previous machine studies machine studies of the luminosity reach through
crossing angle scan, during these machine studies the crossing angle steps were
fixed for 1015 minutes. This enabled extended and more accurate measurements
of the bunch lifetimes to be made. The crossing angle steps were:
290  260  234  224  212  192  174  158  144  118 [rad].
(5.10)
This corresponded to a reduction in the normalised beam-beam separation of
13.2   5.5 ,
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 146
for an emittance  = 2.5 m and  = 0.8 m. At each crossing angle step, the
decay rates of the luminosity and intensity were monitored and observed. In
addition to the crossing angle scan, at the end of this machine study and at the
smallest crossing angle, the impact of chromaticity and Landau octupoles on the
decay rates was also investigated. At the minimum crossing angle of 118 rad,
the chromaticity was reduced from 15 units to 2 units in one step and the impact
on the decay rates were observed. At this value of chromaticity and crossing
angle, the Landau octupole strength was koct = 16.27 Tm
3 and the current was
reduced from 476 A down to 0 A, and once again the impact on the beam intensity
and luminosity decay rates were observed. A full description of the procedure is
found in references [108, 109].
5.3.2.1 Bunch by Bunch Intensity
The bunch by bunch intensity data allows the impact of the crossing angle scan
on individual bunches to be observed, as well as characterising how the bunch
position can affect particle losses. The bunch by bunch intensity data was fitted
with equation 5.3 and the decay rate was calculated and plotted for each bunch
as a function of crossing angle. This is shown in Figure 5.11.
Figure 5.11(a) shows that as the crossing angle is reduced, no significant increase
in decay rate is observed between the angles of  = 280 rad to   190 rad. At
crossing angles smaller than  = 190 rad, the impact on the decay rates varies
depending on the bunch, with some bunches suffering more than others. The
smallest crossing angle of  = 118 rad, corresponds to lifetimes below  < 10
hours for some bunches. Bunches in beam 2, shown in Figure 5.11(b) exhibit a
similar trend as beam 1, however the impact on the decay rate for crossing angles
smaller than  = 190 rad is much larger, with the majority of bunches reducing
to lifetimes of approximately  = 6 hours and some bunches experiencing lifetimes

as small as   4 hours. From these figures it can be seen that not all bunches
are affected by the reduction in crossing angle equally and the position of the
bunch in the train may play a significant role.
The bunch decay rate as a function of position in the train and the number of long-
range beam-beam interactions, is shown in Figures 5.12 and 5.13. Figure 5.12
shows clearly a strong dependence of the decay rates on the number of long-range
beam-beam interactions and the size of the crossing angle. Nominal bunches in
the centre of the train suffer more than the bunches at the head or tail of the train.
The dependence of the decay rates on the long-range beam-beam pattern arises
more clearly with reducing crossing angle. For nominal bunches in the centre of
the train, lifetimes drop below  = 10 hours at a crossing angle of  = 118 rad.
This crossing angle corresponds to a small beam-beam separation of dsep = 5.5 .
Figure 5.13 shows a similar trend as seen in beam 1, with nominal bunches
experiencing the largest decay rate. The intensity data retrieved for beam 2 did
however suffer from measurement issues, providing spurious calculations of the
intensity. This resulted in some of the bunch intensity data being excluded.
In beam 1 (fig 5.12), it can also been seen that there is some asymmetry between
the head and tail of the train. There are a number of possible explanations

for this. Electron cloud effects act along the bunch train and could cause the
asymmetry. The cumulative effect of electron cloud could be impacting bunches
towards the end of the train, causing these bunches to experience larger losses. An
alternative explanation is the closed orbit drift caused by the increased strength
of the long-range beam-beam interaction. The long-range beam-beam interaction
provides a kick to each bunch that will change its orbit around the LHC. This
may also introduce a transverse offset between the bunches which will further
affect the lifetimes.
Figure 5.14 highlights the strong dependency of the decay rate with increasing
number of long-range beam-beam interactions. The bunch at the front of the
train has 17 long-range beam-beam interactions per IP and the impact from
the crossing angle reduction is small to negligible. For this bunch, the decay
rates remain approximately fixed throughout the crossing angle variation. The
value of the decay rates correspond to lifetimes around 50 hours. Alternatively,
the nominal bunches in the centre of the train, undergo a significant increase in
decay rate resulting in lifetimes reducing to below 10 hours.

A similarly important figure indicating the decay rate as a function of the number
of long-range beam-beam interactions at various crossing angles, is figure 5.15.
The points corresponding to bunches with less than 20 long-range beam-beam
interactions per IP remain approximately fixed as the crossing angle is reduced,
with almost negligible variations. For long-range beam-beam interactions larger
than 20 the crossing angle reduction begins to have an impact on decay rates.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 150
At the smallest crossing angle  = 118 rad, a non-linear dependence of the
decay rates on the number of long-range interactions can be observed as seen
in figure 5.15. In order to confirm that the behaviour is indeed non-linear, the
polynomial best fit of the measured intensity decay rates is calculated and shown
in figure 5.16. The difference between the measured decay rates and the decay
rates calculated by a polynomial line of best fit and a linear line of best fit is
shown in figure 5.17. The polynomial fit agrees well with the measured decay

rates and the difference between the polynomial line of best fit and the data
is smaller than 0.5% and gives 2 = 6.65  105. The linear fit is accurate to
within approximately 3% of the measured decay rates, giving 2 = 1.4  103.
This confirms that the behaviour of the decay rates with the number of long-
range beam-beam interactions is indeed linear for small crossing angles, when
the beam-beam separation is small.
There is a clear correspondence between the strength of the long-range beam-
beam interaction and the intensity decay rates and losses that the bunches expe-
rience. The nominal bunches in the centre of the train clearly suffer more than
the Pacman bunches as the crossing angle is reduced. However all bunches retain

good lifetimes and undergo no significant effect from the crossing angle reduc-
tion, until a crossing angle of  = 190 rad is reached. Above crossing angles
of  = 190 rad, the lifetimes remain above 10 hours. From the intensity data
alone, this suggests that the crossing angle and hence the beam-beam separation
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 152
can be reduced without introducing any significant impact on the intensity decay
rates. The analysis of the bunch by bunch intensities suggest that the beam-beam
limit is at approximately  = 190 rad, which corresponds to a beam-beam sep-
aration of 7.5 . Before the luminosity lifetimes are investigated, it is important
to investigate the emittance and cause an emittance growth. Since the long-range
beam-beam interaction can affect both particle losses and emittance growth, the
principle reason for any drop in luminosity lifetimes should be considered. In the
next section, the emittance data will be considered.
5.3.2.2 Emittances
The bunch emittances were calculated using data obtained from the BSRT. The
nominal and head-on only colliding bunches are shown in Figures 5.18(a), 5.18(b), 5.18(c)
and 5.18(d). From figure 5.18(a), 5.18(b), 5.18(c) and 5.18(d), a noticeable asym-
metry in the bunch planes can be observed, most apparently in the beam 2 data.
In the beam 2 data, the horizontal plane emittance is x = 3.5  4.0 m during
the crossing angle scan. In the vertical plane, the emittance remains approxi-
mately fixed throughout the crossing angle scan just below y = 3 m. In beam
1, the asymmetry between the bunch planes is not as pronounced, with emit-
tances between x,y = 2.4 3 m. The asymmetry between the emittance planes
could have an impact on the long-range beam-beam interaction and affect the
loss mechanism. If the bunch emittance is large in one plane, then long-range
beam-beam interactions in this plane could have a smaller beam-beam separation
and hence experience a stronger long-range beam-beam interaction.
The emittances do not remain constant throughout this long-range beam-beam
machine study, with the most significant changes observed in the larger plane. In
the horizontal plane, the bunch remains approximately constant until a crossing
angle of  = 190 rad is reached. This crossing angle corresponds to the location

of the long-range beam-beam limit, with a separation of 7.5 . Below this beam-
beam separation, the nominal bunches emittance in beam 1 and beam 2 undergo
an apparent emittance reduction. A similar observation was obtained in the
high brightness head-on beam-beam limit machine study [110]. The emittance
reduction implies that the long-range beam-beam interaction behaves in a similar
way to a collimator, cutting into the core of the bunch. The long-range beam-
beam interaction at small crossing angles provides a strong non-linear beam-beam
kick to the particles. This causes particles in the core (r < 2 ) to diffuse to larger
amplitudes where they will then be lost. In the horizontal beam planes, the head-
on bunch undergoes an emittance increase of approximately x  16% in beam
1 and x  14% in beam 2. The vertical emittance for this bunch remains
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 154
approximately constant throughout the machine study. Much like the head-on
bunch, the emittances in the vertical plane for the nominal bunches remain stable
throughout the machine study and do not change significantly.
Next, the luminosity lifetimes are considered in order to determine whether it
is the geometrical emittance change or the intensity loss which determines the
luminosity performance..
5.3.2.3 Bunch By Bunch Luminosity
The bunch by bunch luminosity data was obtained from ATLAS at IP1 and the
decay rates for the nominal bunches was plotted against the crossing angle as
shown in Figure 5.19. The nominal bunches show the same trend as found in the
bunch by bunch intensity data, with decay rates and lifetimes corresponding well
to what was previously observed in the intensity data. The luminosity through-
out the machine study suffered from significant orbit drifts, which will impact
the quality of the luminosity data [108, 109]. The luminosity is dependent on
intensity, emittance, and the geometrical overlap between the two beams. Many
different mechanisms in the LHC exist which can impact any one of these pa-
rameters and deteriorate the luminosity. This introduces an uncertainty in the
luminosity data which hence impacts the decay rate calculation. One example
of such an effect is a transverse offset caused by an orbit drift at the IP between
the two beams. A transverse offset will lead to a reduction in luminosity. When
the data was fitted to calculate the decay rate, any sudden reduction in luminos-
ity was removed to prevent spurious decay rate calculations. The sudden drops
in luminosity data often arise due to the re-optimisation of the luminosity. To
re-optimise the luminosity, the bunches are brought in and out of collision un-
til the maximum luminosity is found. It is also difficult to actually determine
whether the bunches do or do not collide with an offset without performing these
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 155
luminosity scans. The luminosity is optimised regularly to ensure that the trans-
verse offset between the bunches is minimised. Even with the possible transverse
offsets, the same trend is observed in the luminosity data as in the intensity
data. There is no significant variation in the decay rate above a crossing angle of
 = 190 rad, for beam-beam separations > 7.5 . However, below this beam-
beam separation, the decay rates begin to increase and correspond to a reduction
in lifetime. The lifetimes calculated from the decay rate are similar to those ob-
tained in the intensity data, with the minimum lifetime observed calculated to be
approximately of the order of 4 hours, which corresponds to lifetimes measured
in the beam 2 data. Hence the luminosity lifetimes appear to be dominated by
the intensity losses and not by the changes in emittances.

5.3.2.4 Impact of Chromaticity and Landau Octupoles on Decay Rates
At the final and minimum crossing angle of  = 118 rad, corresponding to a
beam-beam separation of approximately 5.5 , the impact of chromaticity and
Landau octupoles on the decay rate was characterised in two experimental steps.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 156
In the first step, the chromaticity was reduced from Q = 15 units to Q = 2
units and the decay rates were once again observed. The chromaticity is quoted
in terms of units as in ref [111]. In the subsequent experimental step and after
a small tune trim to beam 2, the strength of the Landau octupole were reduced.
The chromaticity remained at Q = 2 units as the Landau octupole strength was
reduced from koct = 16.27 Tm
3 to koct = 0 Tm
3. Again, the decay rates were
monitored for a period of time. The length of this experimental step was limited
as the non-colliding bunch became unstable, as expected since the octupoles are
the source of Landau damping for this bunch.
Figures 5.20 and 5.21 shows the decay rates including the final experimental steps
in which the Landau octupole and chromaticity were varied. The reduction of
the chromaticity and strengths of the Landau octupoles results in a significant
lifetime recovery for the nominal bunches in both beam 1 and beam 2. At reduced
chromaticity and Landau octupole strength, the decay rates completely recover to
lifetimes that were previously observed at the initial crossing angle  = 290 rad.
The lifetimes improve from below 10 hours back to above 30 hours. The colliding
bunches remain stable even with Landau octupole strength and chromaticity
reduced, with only the non-colliding bunch becoming unstable.
Figure 5.22 shows the improvement of the decay rates as a function bunch position
in the train. When the chromaticity is reduced to Q = 2 units, the decay rates
improve for the nominal bunches in the centre of the train by approximately
 50%. In the following experimental step, when the strength of the Landau
octupole is reduced, the decay rates fully recovered to the values found at the
largest crossing angle  = 290 rad. From the analysis of this machine study,
the colliding bunches remain stable, even with chromaticity and Landau octupole
strength significantly reduced and at a small crossing angle. This suggests that
the LHC could be operated at a smaller crossing angle if the chromaticity and
strength of the Landau octupoles were decreased. However the reduction of the

5.3.3 Head-On Only and Non-Colliding Bunches
In this machine study, a non-colliding and a head-on only colliding bunch were
also included by leaving a suitable number of bunch slots free between the col-
liding trains. These bunches can be used as reference bunches to analyse the
effect of crossing angle reduction on the decay rates when there is no long-range
beam-beam interaction present and also when there is no beam-beam interac-
tion at all. Figure 5.23 shows the measured intensity decay rate as a function
of crossing angle for both the non-colliding and head-on only colliding bunch.
The non-colliding bunch has consistently small decay rates throughout the ma-
chine study and undergoes a negligible amount of particle losses. As expected
the decay rate does not have any dependence on the reducing crossing angle. The
head-on only colliding bunch does have some dependence on the crossing angle
with decay rates improving towards smaller crossing angles. The lifetimes for
the head-on only colliding bunch improves from  > 30 hours to  = 100 hours.
As the crossing angle is reduced, the tune spread from the head-on beam-beam
interaction increases. This provides a larger area for Landau damping and hence
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 159
improves the lifetimes. In addition to this, any longitudinal effects arising from
synchro-betatron modes may be suppressed [112].

Figure 5.24 shows the RMS emittance for both the head-on and non-colliding
bunch in beam 1 throughout the crossing angle scan. The non-colliding bunch,
much like the decay rates, show no significant variation with crossing angle.
The head-on only bunch undergoes a small emittance growth for crossing an-
gles smaller than  = 240 rad. The emittance increase for the head-on bunch
from a crossing angle of  = 290 rad to the final crossing angle of  = 190 rad
is of the order of about rms = 14%.
As the chromaticity and Landau octupole current is reduced the colliding bunches
remain stable and see an improvement in lifetime after a small tune trim to beam
2. The only bunch that experiences a reduction in lifetime is the non-colliding
bunch as seen in Figure 5.25. The chromaticity reduction does not appear to
have a significant impact on the decay rate for the non-colliding bunch with only
a small increase in decay rate with lifetimes remaining above 10 hours. As the
Landau octupole current is reduced the decay rate increases significantly for the

tupoles provide a source of Landau damping for the non-colliding bunch which
keeps the bunch table. When the octupole current is reduced there is no mecha-
nism like the beam-beam interaction to provide the required damping, hence the
bunch becomes unstable. The high chromaticity and Landau octupole operation

clearly limits the crossing angle at which the LHC can operate. However, high
chromaticity and octupole operation is required to prevent instabilities [113].
The analysis from the 2015 long-range beam-beam machine study has identified
the minimum operational beam-beam separation for a  of 0.8 m. The mini-
mum beam-beam separation is found at approximately 7.5 . This beam-beam
separation corresponds to a crossing angle  = 190 rad. For crossing angles
and separations smaller than this, the long-range beam-beam interaction begins
to dictate particle losses and reduce the lifetimes. The chromaticity and strength
of the Landau octupole current also has a significant impact on the lifetimes and
prevents the beam-beam separation being reduced further. However, this high
chromaticity and octupole settings are required in order to prevent instabilities
during the squeeze.
5.3.4 Machine Study 2: LHC 2016
In the 2016 run of the LHC, the long-range beam-beam machine study was re-
peated, with the aim to once again determine the long-range beam-beam limit for
the LHC whilst operating at a  of 0.4 m. This experiment was categorised into
two separate fills (5136 and 5137), the first fill was a repeat of the 2015 machine
study, with a single train of 48 bunches, with one head-on only colliding bunch
and one non-colliding bunch with collisions at IP1 and IP5 only. The second
fill investigated the additional impact on the intensity and luminosity lifetimes,
with additional collisions at IP2 and IP8, as is typical for nominal operational
fills. The second fill consisted of three trains of 48 bunches, with the first train
colliding at IP1/2 and 5, the second train colliding at IP1/5 and 8, and finally the
last train colliding at all 4 IPs. The additional IPs are not expected to contribute
to the reduction in lifetimes as the beams are separated by > 10 , with the
-function at these IP2 and IP8, 3m and 11m, respectively.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 162
Unfortunately, the first fill did not reach the long-range beam-beam limit, as
discussed in ref [114], so only the second fill of the experiment is discussed here.
The crossing angle was reduced simultaneously in both IP1 and IP5, in the same
way as the 2015 machine study. The crossing angle steps during the second fill
are given by
310  280  270  260  250  240  230  210  190 [rad]. (5.11)
These crossing angles correspond to a beam-beam separation for a fixed emittance
 = 2.5 m and  = 0.4m at flat top energy of
10.65  9.32  8.99  8.65  8.32  7.99  7.65  6.99  6.32 []. (5.12)
Once again, the lifetimes were observed for 10-15 minutes at each crossing angle
step. At a crossing angle of  = 210 rad, the Landau octupole current was
reduced from operational settings of Joct = 476 A down to Joct = 188 A, cor-
responding to koct = 16.26 Tm
3  koct = 6.43 Tm3, and the impact on the
lifetimes was observed. At the same chromaticity and Landau octupole powering,
the crossing angle was reduced again, down to  = 190 rad.
The tune footprint calculated for a nominal bunch as the crossing angle is reduced
is shown in figure 5.26. As the crossing angle is reduced, the size of the tune
footprint becomes larger as the strength of the beam-beam interaction increases.
As the crossing angle is reduced, the impact from the long-range beam-beam
interaction increases, causing the footprint tails to spread out. This can cause
the particles to cross many resonance lines. This can impact particle stability
and lead to losses [16].
Figure 5.27 shows the total beam intensity as a function of time as well as the
orbit corrector magnet current over the duration of the fill. The corrector magnet

operators. The corrector magnet strengths were then used as a guide to determine
over what time interval the fitting windows need to be applied.
In the following sections, the bunch by bunch intensity, luminosity and emittance
data obtained from the long-range beam-beam machine study are discussed and
the long-range beam-beam limit is identified.
5.3.4.1 Bunch By Bunch Intensity
The bunch by bunch intensity decay rate for all bunches in beam 1 and beam 2
at different crossing angles is shown in figure 5.28. In beam 1, there is no real
effect of the reduction in crossing angle until approximately  = 260 rad. For
angles below  = 260 rad the decay rates decrease non-linearly and depends
strongly on the crossing angle, with some bunches undergoing significant losses
at the smallest crossing angle of  = 190 rad, even with the reduced Landau
octupole strength at the smallest crossing angle. Alternatively beam 2 does not

appear to have such a strong dependence on the crossing angle. During this long-
range beam-beam machine study, beam 2 appears to be unaffected until the final
crossing angle of  = 190 rad. At the final crossing angle the lifetimes finally
drop below 10 hours for a large proportion of the bunches.
An isolation of some of the Pacman and the nominal bunches is depicted in fig-
ure 5.29, showing the same trend as previously observed during the 2015 machine
study. The decay rates observed during the 2016 machine study were considerably

the decay rates on the crossing angle for the different bunch trains in the fill.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 166
Each train underwent a different collision pattern, in order to determine the im-
pact of the additional collisions at IP2 and IP8. In beam 1, no real effect on
the decay rates was observed until a crossing angle of  = 260 rad is reached.
This corresponds to a beam-beam separation of 8.5 . Below this crossing angle,
the decay rates in beam 1 deteriorate significantly with each crossing angle step.
As expected bunches with a large number of long-range beam-beam interactions
suffered the worst decay rates, shown in figure 5.29. Pacman bunches in beam
1 with less than 20 long-range interactions do not really experience a significant
increase in decay rates and the lifetimes  remain above 10 hours. This is con-
sistent with what was previously observed in the 2015 machine study. Beam 2,
does not show any significant effect from the crossing angle reduction with decay
rates remaining acceptable throughout. This is until the final crossing angle of
 = 190 rad is reached. At the final crossing angle, bunches in beam 2 with
more than 20 long-range interactions also experience lifetimes  < 10 hours; how-
ever these bunches do not suffer the same small lifetimes as bunches in beam 1.
The decay rate for the Pacman bunches as a function of crossing angle and
the number of long-range interactions is shown in figure 5.30. The relationship
between the number of long-range and the decay rate is non-linear in beam 1,
with the decay rates suffering considerably for a crossing angle of  = 210 rad
or less. Beam 2 shows some dependence of the decay rates with the number of
long-range but it clearly does not follow the same non-linear trend observed in
beam 1. However even at the smallest crossing angle of  = 190 rad, bunches
with more than 24 long-range interactions suffer decay rates that correspond to
less than  = 10hours. Comparing the decay rate as a function of bunch slot,
crossing angle, and the number of long-range beam-beam interactions as seen
in figure 5.31, shows a strong long-range pattern in beam 1. In this case, the
nominal bunch decay rates reduce significantly below  = 10 hours in all trains.

5.3.4.2 Emittances
The RMS mean emittance for the bunches in trains 1,2, and 3, were plotted as a
function of crossing angle in figure 5.32, where the RMS emittance is defined by
n,rms =
2n,x + 
n,y. (5.13)
A number of interesting observations can be seen in the emittance data. Firstly
the RMS emittance appears to show a reduction in emittance for all colliding
bunches during the crossing angle scan. This similarly was observed in the 2015
machine study, as well as in the head-on beam-beam limit study [110]. This
is most strongly observed in beam 1, with the RMS emittance reducing by ap-
proximately 18% in train1, 22% in train 2 and 18% in train 3. Some emittance
reduction is also observed in beam 2, corresponding to 7%, 10% and 10% in
train 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The head-on bunch remains approximately fixed
throughout the crossing angle scan. In addition to the reduction in emittance
observed throughout beam 1 and beam 2, there is some emittance split between
the bunches in the train. With bunches grouping into families of slightly smaller
or larger emittances depending on the injection pattern of machines earlier on
in the injection chain. The bunches are normalised with respect to their initial
emittance to remove the dependency.
Figures 5.33 and 5.34 show the normalised change in emittance in the horizontal
and vertical, with the injection pattern from the PS removed. The change in
emittance is plotted as a function of bunch slot at each crossing angle. Figure 5.33
shows a reduction in emittance for bunches in beam 1 which appears to follow
the long-range beam-beam pattern. Bunches in the centre of the train, which are
most sensitive to the strength of the long-range beam-beam interaction, undergo
the largest change in emittance, with emittance loss increasing with reducing
crossing angle. The horizontal plane suffers larger variations of emittance than

5.3.4.3 Bunch by Bunch Luminosity
Unlike the 2015 machine study, the 2016 machine study also obtained bunch by
bunch luminosity data from the CMS detector to record. The CMS detector
tends to publish luminosity data with a better time resolution than the ATLAS
detector, which in turn will lead to a more accurate fitting of the decay model.
Much like the intensity data, a long-range beam-beam pattern is observed in the
bunch by bunch luminosity data, as shown in figure 5.35. However the impact
is only really observed at the last crossing angle. The decay rates calculated
here will depend on the intensities of the colliding bunches in both beams as well
as the emittance and transverse offset. Since beam 2 did not really observe a
significant impact from the crossing angle reduction, it is likely that this impacts
the calculation of decay rate. In addition to this the luminosity data will also be
affected by transverse offset and emittance effects. These effects can all impact
the calculated value of luminosity decay rate. In the next section, the impact of

the additional collisions at IP2 and IP8 are discussed.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 175
5.3.4.4 Impact of Additional Collisions at IP2 and IP8.
The strength of the long-range beam-beam interaction is dependent on the beam-
beam separation as defined by equation 5.1 and is dependent on the crossing
angle, the emittance, and the -function at the IP. In the 2012 LHC run, the
additional long-range beam-beam effects from IP2 and IP8 had a significant effect
on the lifetimes [104]. To mitigate the long-range effect from IP2 and IP8, the
beam-beam separation was increased. The beam-beam separation during the
2012 LHC run in IP2 and IP8 was approximately 12 and 10 respectively,
however in the 2015 and 2016 run this separation was increased to approximately
The impact from additional collisions at IP2 and IP8 are expected to be minimal
during the machine experiment. This is partly due to the small bunch emittances,
 = 2.5 m and larger  values at IP2 ( = 10m) and at IP8 ( = 3m).
Since the  value at IP8 is smaller, collisions at this IP are expected to have
a marginally larger effect on the lifetimes than that at IP2. The comparison
between the Pacman bunches at the front of all three of the different trains
is shown in Figure 5.36 at the smallest crossing angle. As it can be seen in
Figure 5.36, the effect on the decay rates from the additional collisions at IP2 and
IP8 are small. Collisions at IP8 do as expected have a slightly larger contribution
to the decay rates, however it is not large and there is approximately a 20%
difference between the decay rates for nominal bunches that collide at IP1,2 and
5 compared to bunches that collide at IP1,2,5 and 8.
5.3.4.5 Head-On and Non-Colliding Bunches
As in the 2015 machine study, the head-on and non-colliding bunches were anal-
ysed separately to determine their dependence on the crossing angle. Figure 5.37

shows the decay rate as a function of crossing angle for both the head-on only and
non-colliding bunch in beam 1. A comparable trend is observed for the head-on
colliding bunch as seen in the 2015 machine study at a  = 0.8 m. The decay
rate for the head-on only bunch improves as the crossing angle is reduced.There
is no apparent effect on the non-colliding bunch from the crossing angle reduction
as expected and agrees with the 2015 machine study.
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 177
5.3.5 LHC 2015/2016: Stable Beams
In the 2015/2016 LHC nominal luminosity fills, the long-range beam-beam effects
were mitigated during stable beams by increasing the crossing angle at IP2 and
IP8 and increasing the beam-beam separation at these IPs. Figure 5.38 shows
the reduced impact of the long-range beam-beam effects on the decay rates with
a reduced crossing angle at IP1 and IP5, with the beam-beam separations at IP2
and IP8 kept sufficiently large at dsep > 26 . Due to the success of the 2015/6
machine run and the two dedicated long-range beam-beam machine studies, it
was decided to push the luminosity reach for the LHC towards the end of the 2016
proton-proton run. Pushing the luminosity reach by reducing the crossing angle
will improve luminosity performance as well as providing a better understanding
of the machine for the 2017 run.
Analysis of the dedicated machine studies show that the LHC can operate at a
smaller beam-beam separation of 8.5  at IP1 and IP5, without lifetimes deterio-
rating due to long-range beam-beam interactions. Figure 5.38 shows an example
nominal fill after a crossing angle reduction from  = 370 rad to  = 280 rad.
The first hour from a luminosity production fill from the 2016 run is selected and
analysed as shown in figure 5.38. The first hour was selected as it is this time in
the fill that the long-range beam-beam interaction is the most prevalent. From
figure 5.38 some apparent long-range beam-beam pattern can be observed for the
different bunch trains. The decay rates do however remain within acceptable val-
ues above 10 hours. The worst lifetimes obtained correspond to bunch intensity
lifetime of  = 16.6 hours. Similarly to the 2016 long-range beam-beam machine
study, beam 1 is more sensitive to the crossing angle reduction, whereas beam 2
remains almost unaffected.

5.4 Discussion
In this chapter, the long-range beam-beam limit in the LHC has been identified
by characterising the decay rates for two different operational configurations,
during two dedicated machine experiments. The analysis from the 2016 machine
determined that the crossing angle could be reduced during normal operational
fills. The lifetimes for a recent 2016 luminosity production fill, whilst operating
at the new crossing angle is briefly discussed, along with the impact of the long-
range beam-beam interaction on the fill.
In the 2015 machine study, collisions occurred at IP1 and IP5 only with a
 = 0.80 m. The crossing angle was reduced in steps and the lifetimes were
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 179
measured. As the crossing angle is reduced, the beam-beam separation is reduced
and the lifetimes correspond closely to the number of long-range beam-beam in-
teractions each bunch experiences. The strength and number of the long-range
beam-beam interaction is shown to have a significant impact on the lifetimes. For
beam-beam separations smaller than 7.5 , the long-range beam-beam interac-
tion began to dominate and cause particle losses. This separation corresponds to
a crossing angle of  = 190 rad. At a minimum crossing angle of  = 118 rad,
the lifetimes in the bunch by bunch intensity and luminosity data falls below 10
hours with beam 2 suffering more. A minimum bunch lifetime in beam 2 mea-
sured at approximately 4 hours. A crossing angle of  = 118 rad corresponds
to a beam-beam separation of 5.5 . These lifetimes were observed whilst us-
ing the standard luminosity production operational settings of high chromaticity
and Landau octupole current. In this study, it was found that reducing the chro-
maticity from Q = 15 units to Q = 2 units and the Landau octupole strength
from koct = 16.27 Tm
3 to koct = 0 Tm
3, resulted in an improvement in life-
times, without compromising beam stability for the colliding bunches. Lifetimes
improved for the nominal bunches, increasing from  < 10 hours, to values ob-
served at the initial crossing angle of   30 hours. The high chromaticity
and Landau octupole operation prevents the crossing angle being reduced below
 = 190 rad. Operating at a smaller crossing angle would be beneficial from
the perspective of luminosity production, however these settings are required in
order to suppress instabilities during the squeeze.
The second machine study took place in 2016 and was split into two fills. The
first fill was a repeat of the first machine study, colliding two trains of bunches but
at a smaller  of 0.4 m. During this fill the long-range beam-beam limit was not
reached due to an unexpected beam dump and time restraints prevented a repeat.
The second fill of the machine study contained three trains of bunches which were
collided at IP1 and IP5. Additionally each train had combinations of collisions
Chapter 5: The Long-Range Beam-Beam Limit in the LHC 180
at IP2 and IP8. The long-range beam-beam limit was reached during this fill
for a beam-beam separation of 8.5 . This corresponds to a crossing angle of
approximately  = 260 rad in beam 1. The long-range beam-beam limit was not
reached for the second beam until the smallest crossing angle  = 190 rad. For
crossing angles above 260 rad there was no noticeable impact from reducing the
crossing angle on either beams and the decay rates and bunch lifetimes remained
acceptable, above 10 hours. For beam-beam separations smaller than 8.5 , the
decay rates begin to deteriorate. This resulted in lifetimes much less than  = 10
hours being obtained. Once again there was no obvious impact on beam 2, except
for the smallest crossing angle  = 190 rad. The reason for the beam asymmetry
is as of yet still unknown. In beam 2, only bunches with 24 long-range collisions or
more experienced lifetimes smaller than  = 10 hours. From this machine study,
the analysis suggests that it is possible to reduce the crossing angle operationally
in the LHC without inducing additional losses. The crossing angle can be reduced
from  = 370 rad to  = 280 rad with the current operational configuration,
without encountering the long-range beam-beam limit and inducing unnecessary
losses.
The crossing angle was reduced for nominal luminosity production runs at the
beginning of October 2016. The crossing angle was reduced from 370 rad to
 = 280 rad, outside of the long-range beam-beam dominated region. The
beam-beam separation was sufficiently large at  9.3 , that good lifetimes were
retained, enabling long fill lengths. In addition to the crossing angle reduction,
the emittance was also reduced from n = 3.75 m to n = 2.5 m. The emittance
reduction in combination with the crossing angle reduction, results in an increase
in luminosity of approximately 15  17%, for a bunch intensity of nb = 1.25e11
protons per bunch.

In this chapter, the experiment results obtained during the two long-range ma-
chine studies have been discussed and analysed. In order to understand the dif-
fusive processes that particles in the bunches experience, the experimental data

Interaction
6.1 Introduction
The analysis of the long-range beam-beam machine studies presented in chapter 5
show small beam and luminosity lifetimes for small crossing angles and beam-
beam separations [108, 109, 115, 116]. The results from those studies enabled the
minimum operational crossing angle in the LHC to be defined for that particu-
lar optics configuration and provided an understanding of the relation between
intensity losses and the long-range beam-beam effect. The particle losses due to
the long-range beam-beam effect arise due to a reduction of the dynamic aper-
ture with crossing angle. It is important to quantify the impact of the long-range
beam-beam interaction and the non-linearities of the machine on the dynamic
aperture. This allows comparisons to be made between the expectations from
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 183
models and data obtained during the 2016 machine study. Providing this com-
parison allows the processes which limit dynamic aperture and affect luminosity
performance in the machine to be understood.
6.2 Overview
In this chapter, results and analysis of dynamic aperture studies of the 2016
long-range beam-beam machine experiment are presented with the aim of char-
acterising the dynamic aperture as a function of crossing angle. The measured
dynamic aperture is calculated from intensity loss and compared to weak-strong
long-term tracking simulations.
6.3 Dynamic Aperture
Dynamic aperture in a machine like the LHC is closely related to the onset of
chaotic particle motion [13]. The dynamic aperture after an infinite number of
turns is defined as the boundary in phase space for which particle motion in-
side that boundary is stable and outside that boundary is chaotic [117, 118].
This parameter is often denoted as D as given in ref [119]. Particles that lie
outside this boundary and have chaotic motion can have amplitudes that grow
significantly, resulting in particles being lost from the accelerator. For particles
confined inside the dynamic aperture boundary in phase space, the particle tra-
jectories should remain stable [120]. In reality however, even particles inside the
dynamic aperture can be lost due to the phenomenon of Arnold diffusion [121].
Arnold diffusion can cause particle amplitudes to increase arbitrarily, which may
result in the particle hitting the physical aperture of the machine, however the
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 184
time scale of Arnold diffusion may be so long that it is not relevant for physical
applications.
For accelerator physics however, the concept of survivability or dynamic aperture
after a finite number of turns is more practical. The dynamic aperture as a
function of turn number is given by the inverse of the logarithm and is observed
to have the form,
D(N) = D
(logN)
, (6.1)
as given by ref [122, 123], and is based on the analysis of data from numerical
simulations. In equation 6.1, D(N) is the dynamic aperture as a function of
turn number N and D is the asymptotic value of the amplitude of the stability
domain. The fitting variables b and  are additional free fitting parameters as
in [119]. The fitting parameters (D, b, ) can take positive or negative values,
with the sign of these values dependent on the system being studied. In order to
understand the proposed model [119] and the sign of the fitting parameters, the
KAM and Nekhoroshev theories are introduced briefly.
6.3.1 Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser Theorem
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory describes the behaviour of a system
under the influence of a small non-linear perturbation. Under such a perturbation,
solutions to the nearly integrable Hamiltonian system can still be found with the
phase space motion remaining quasi-periodic i.e, stable, and confined to a KAM
surface [124]. The KAM surface is hence defined as an invariant torus (doughnut-
shaped surface) in which the particles trajectory in phase space is confined [125].
If a particles phase space amplitude trajectory lies on the KAM surface then
the trajectory of that particle is likely to be confined within the bunch and will
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 185
remain stable, in the absence of Arnold diffusion. For the parameters given
in equation 6.1, this interpretation of the model corresponds to the case when
the fitting parameters b,  and D are all positive R>0 = {x  R |x  0}. If
the fitting parameters are all positive, then the KAM surface corresponds to the
phase space region of the bunch in which the particle amplitude r < D.
6.3.2 Arnold Diffusion
Arnold diffusion is closely related to KAM theory and determines the nature of
some solutions that lie close to the unperturbed solutions of the Hamiltonian. In
KAM theory, some solutions of the perturbed Hamiltonian will remain close to
the unperturbed system, however this is not the case for all perturbed solutions.
This means that perturbed solutions to the system can still exhibit an arbitrary
amplitude growth [121]. As a result a given particle Hamiltonian that lies close
to the unperturbed Hamiltonian may still experience diffusion to a higher ampli-
tude and be lost. Hence even particles within the stable region of the bunch
as described by figure 6.1 may still experience an arbitrary amplitude growth.
Formally for a non-linear Hamiltonian there is no stable dynamic aperture and
diffusion can occur from arbitrary small amplitudes [125].
6.3.3 Nekhoroshev Theorem
Particles outside of the dynamic aperture boundary in phase space will be gov-
erned by a Nekhoroshev-like escape to infinity. Particles will escape to infinity
following
N(r) = N0 exp
)1]
, (6.2)
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 186
where N(r) is the number of stable turns that have an initial particle amplitude
that is smaller than r [119, 126128]. Particles which have trajectories in phase
space outside the stable core of the bunch r > D, will undergo chaotic motion
and diffuse to infinity following the Nekhoroshev-like escape. Eventually these
particles will reach an amplitude where they are intercepted by the collimation
system.
These fitting parameters under some conditions have a physical representation
based on the above mentioned theories. In a 4-dimensional model, the fitting
parameters; D, b0 and  will all be positive and correspond to a partitioning
of the phase space into stable and unstable regions. A schematic of this parti-
tioning is shown figure 6.1, along with the dynamic aperture variation with the
fitting parameters as shown in figure 6.2. Under this regime, the parameter b0

corresponds to the size of the amplitude interval at which the diffusive mecha-
nism occurs, and  determines the rate of diffusion. The dynamic aperture varies
significantly with more negative values of b0 causing a larger reduction in dy-
namic aperture after 10  106 turns. The  function on the other hand varies
the slope of the inverse logarithmic function, with more negative values resulting
in a steeper gradient. However the final dynamic aperture at 10  106 turns is
within 0.25% for the different values of .The dynamics in a real machine will

however be a 6-dimensional system and hence non-positive values of the fitting
parameters should be considered. This regime allows for negative values of the
fitting parameters; D, b0 and  [123]. If the fitting parameters are permitted to
be negative, this will give two further possibilities,
D > 0,  < 0, b0 < 0, (6.3)
D  0,  > 0, b0 > 0. (6.4)
Case 6.3 is indicative of a scenario with global chaoticity. In a system with
global chaoticity, no stable KAM region is present and hence all particles will
eventually after some finite time, escape to infinity. However the escape rate
to infinity in a real machine could be considerably larger than the length of a
fill [129]. The second case (6.4) goes beyond the physics of the model. Within
this regime, the asymptotic value of the dynamic aperture is negative. If the
parameter D < 0 then this does not correspond to any physical scenario. Hence
in this case, the KAM area reduces to zero and the escape time to infinity will
follow the Nekhorohev-like estimate. These theories all provide the basis of the
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 188
method discussed by ref [119] and references therein, that allow the dynamic
aperture from intensity loss to be calculated. The relationship between dynamic
aperture and intensity loss is discussed in the following section.
6.3.4 Dynamic Aperture from Intensity Loss
A relationship between the dynamic aperture and the intensity loss as a function
of turn number can be established following the method by M. Giovannozzi [119].
The particle intensity as a function of turn can be obtained directly from the
FBCT data, in which the lost particles lie outside the boundary of stability at
some turn N . The relationship between intensity loss and dynamic aperture is
given by the integral
(x)dx, (6.5)
where I is the intensity at some turn number N , I0 is the initial intensity, and
x corresponds to the particle position. If the losses are assumed to only occur in
the transverse planes, then x corresponds to the transverse coordinates. Hence,
for a round bunch with a Gaussian distribution, the integral becomes,
2 rdr.
This yields the exponential relationship between the measured intensity and the
dynamic aperture as
= 1 e
D2(N)
2 , (6.6)
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 189
where D(N) is in units of the bunch sigma. Equation 6.6 is comparable to the
simple exponential model used in chapter 5, equation 5.3. Rearranging equa-
tion 6.6 and introducing the fractional intensity loss (I = 1  I
) gives the
dynamic aperture as a function of turn number as,
D(N) =
2 log(I). (6.7)
Using expression 6.7, the dynamic aperture as a function of turn number can be
calculated directly from the intensity loss. The behaviour of equation 6.7 follows
an inverse logarithmic reduction of dynamic aperture with turn and is shown in
figure 6.3. The behaviour close to N = 0 becomes numerically unstable, due to

the nature of the logarithmic function. Ideally N after a large number of turns
(N  1 106) is preferred, however for tracking simulations the number of turns
can significantly impact the computational time. Hence, for these simulations
and for measured intensity data, the dynamic aperture calculated at 1  106
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 190
turns was used. In the next section, the computational method of calculating the
dynamic aperture is introduced by using Sixtrack.
6.4 Sixtrack
Tracking codes such as Sixtrack are often used for dynamic aperture stud-
ies [130132]. Sixtrack uses pairs of particles and tracks the pairs over various
amplitudes in the xy plane. The particles are tracked in pairs in order to deter-
mine at which point in phase space chaotic motion occurs. Sixtrack uses lattice
files generated by MadX [133]. The elements in the accelerator lattice are trans-
formed from thick to thin lens, with the lattice used for these simulations given
by LHC V6.503. The thin lens model used here enables the symplectic tracking
of particles through the lattice and provides a good approximation for the LHC,
since the particles remain close to the nominal design orbit and the deviation
from the closed orbit is small around the ring. In addition to this the symplec-
tic tracking is less computationally expensive than tracking through a thick lens
lattice. This lattice was set up to have the same operational configuration as
the real machine during the long-range beam-beam machine study. This lattice
included beam-beam interactions with a  = 0.4 m at IP1 and IP5. During the
machine studies discussed in chapter 5, additional collisions took place at IP2 and
IP8 with a  of 10 m and 3 m, respectively. In that chapter, the collisions at
IP2 and IP8 were shown to have a negligible impact on the beam lifetimes, since
the beam-beam separation was significantly large, above 26 . Hence in order
to reduce computational time, beam-beam interactions at IP2 and IP8 were not
included in the tracking simulations.
The dynamic aperture itself is calculated in Sixtrack using a number of different
methods. The chaoticity of a system is often calculated using the Lyapunov
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 191
exponent [134]. The Lyapunov exponent determines the onset of chaotic particle
motion for two particles located close to one another in phase space [117, 118].
For two particle trajectories in phase space initially separated by z0, then the
particles will diverge following
|z(t)|  et|z0|, (6.8)
where  is the Lyapunov exponent [135]. If the Lyapunov exponent is positive
( > 0), this indicates chaotic motion since the phase space separation between
the two particles will continue to increase. When  < 0, the particle trajectory is
phase space will remain contained in a stable motion, since the particle separation
in phase space will remain small. The Lyapunov exponent or computational al-
ternatives are calculated in Sixtrack using the distance and slope methods. The
distance and slope methods are two viable and efficient alternatives to calculate
the Lyapunov exponent. The distance method determines the certain chaotic
boundary by analysing the final separation of two initially close particles. One
of the draw backs of this method is that the dynamic aperture may be overesti-
mated [136]. Particles that undergo weak, irregular and chaotic behaviour may
not be sufficiently separated after some period of time. An alternative, more
pessimistic computational method is the slope method. This method examines
the evolution of the distance in phase space and calculates the strict chaotic
boundary. Once again, this can also lead to a misleading calculation of the dy-
namic aperture by underestimating the true value. If a pair of particles have a
large, but regular motion, they may be falsely identified as chaotic particles. The
preferred method here used for LHC type studies is the phase space averaged
dynamic aperture and this is calculated using the post-processing tools available
in the sixdb library [137, 138]. The dynamic aperture from the post-processing
is used in the following section to analyse the results from the 2016 long-range
beam-beam tracking study.
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 192
6.4.1 Magnetic errors
Particle motion in an accelerator is sensitive to a number of factors. Small man-
ufacturing errors in the magnets or even the ground motion itself can impact
the stability of a particle moving around the lattice [139]. In a real machine, the
magnets will not be perfect and will sometimes be misaligned or have design man-
ufacturing errors. The errors from the magnets can be categorised as systematic
and random. The systematic errors can be corrected during operation. The ran-
dom errors are more difficult to account for and arise due to imperfections in the
magnets or due to magnetic misalignments, which can introduce additional un-
wanted multipoles. These can all affect the beam dynamics and lead to unwanted
particle losses [140, 141]. To account for this, the errors in a number of the mag-
nets were measured to provide realistic calculations in tracking simulations [142].
To determine the impact and severity of the magnet design errors, a number of
measurements were made for the real LHC magnets. The magnet components
were measured at hot and cold temperatures, as well as at high and low voltage.
From this a linear model was constructed between the two regimes [140]. Due to
the large number of magnets in the LHC, the rest of the magnets were measured
at warm temperatures, with the cold magnet errors calculated using the linear
model. Since not all of the magnets could be measured, 60 realisations of the
lattice, sometimes known as seeds, are used in order to gain a 95% certainty in
the dynamic aperture calculation [143].
Simulating 60 realisations of the lattice allow the range of dynamic aperture to
be defined. The minimum dynamic aperture as a function of angle compared over
two individual seeds versus the 60 seed case is shown in figure 6.4. A single seed
used during tracking simulations, in the presence of magnetic errors can result in
the minimum dynamic aperture being missed. Using 60 realisations of the lattice
results in a dynamic aperture difference of about 1 2  for some angles in the
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 193

blue points) compared to the minimum dynamic aperture obtained from 60

xy plane compared to the single seed case for the bare machine lattice without
beam-beam.
6.4.2 The Symplectic Beam-Beam Map
In addition to the magnetic errors of the lattice, how the beam-beam effect is
modelled in Sixtrack should be considered. Sixtrack uses the thin lens ap-
proximation to study particles travelling around a lattice. In order to study the
beam-beam interaction using Sixtrack, the beam-beam interaction must be de-
scribed as a symplectic map within the thin lens approximation. To derive the
beam-beam map in Sixtrack, it must be expressed in terms of the weak-strong
approximation. The weak-strong approximation states that a moving test par-
ticle receives a kick from a counter rotating bunch, but the bunch distribution
will remain unaffected by the test particle. In the ultra-relativistic limit, for a
head-on collision without crossing angle, the electric field is almost entirely con-
tained to the transverse planes, with the magnetic field component arising due
to the Lorentz boost as detailed in [145]. In this limit, the bunch can be di-
vided into slices, with the intensity of each slice following a Gaussian distribution
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 194
along the longitudinal direction. However in the LHC, the bunches collide with
a crossing angle and coupling between the planes may be present. The impact
of these operational scenarios need to be considered in the tracking simulations.
The 6-dimensional scalar potential for each slice is given by

from [65], where q is the integration variable and ij corresponds to the 6  6
phase space envelope matrix of the strong bunch, given by

Here i, j are integer values from 1, ..., 6, with the transverse 6-dimensional coor-
dinates of the strong bunch denoted R. The coordinates of the strong bunch can
be expressed as


. (6.11)
Hirata developed a symplectic map based on this sliced potential. This symplectic
map allowed bunch length effects to be approximated [65]. The impact of bunch
length effects were shown to be no longer negligible under certain conditions,
such as when bunch sizes vary significantly around the IP [62]. This symplectic
mapping was implemented into Sixtrack and is known as the Synchro-Betatron
Mapping (SBM). The mapping of the coordinates throughout the interaction is

F  = (x
, y; 11(),33(), ), (6.12)
where  = {x, y, z}. In order to calculate the electric field of each slice,
F  must be calculated for every slice. This can be computationally expensive,
especially in the strong-strong regime for multiple collision points. However, as far
as the author is aware, there is no analytical alternative that can be implemented
in Sixtrack. This provides some of the motivation for the theoretical approach
detailed in chapter 4. The SBM includes coupling and was implemented into
Sixtrack using a Lorentz boost , including a longitudinal tilt. The Lorentz
boost as shown in figure 6.5 between the weak and strong bunch is given by
Leunissen, et. al [145], and takes the form,

The SBM provides the basis for the beam-beam lens implemented in Sixtrack.
Throughout these dynamic aperture studies, a number of the machine and bunch
properties were varied such as crossing angle, emittance, intensity and coupling.
To obtain the most realistic possible simulations bunch length effects were also
included in the simulations using the SBM described above.
6.5 Results from Simulations
In this section, the results of tracking simulations using Sixtrack are presented
and compared to measured dynamic aperture. Firstly, a crossing angle scan is
performed in order to identify the impact of the beam-beam interaction on the
dynamic aperture at different crossing angles. The dynamic aperture obtained
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 197
from these tracking simulations are then compared to measured dynamic aperture
using the formula proposed by M. Giovannozzi [119], described in equation 6.7.
In the following sections, the simulation setup is described along with some of
the systematic and measured errors which could impact the results.
6.5.1 Simulation Setup
The pairs of particles in Sixtrack are tracked over a number of angles in the
x  y plane defined by the variable kmax. The kmax can be converted to degrees
following ref [144]:
kmax + 1
. (6.14)
To ensure that an accurate value of the minimum dynamic aperture was obtained
from the tracking simulations, a reasonable number for kmax must be chosen to
ensure that the computation time is small and the error on the dynamic aperture
is minimised. The minimum dynamic aperture obtained as a function of kmax is
shown in figure 6.6. The dependency on kmax is significant when determining the
minimum dynamic aperture. When only 5 angles are scanned there is a large
probability that the minimum dynamic aperture will be missed. The difference
between kmax=5 and kmax = 59 is approximately 0.7 . For the following simula-
tions, kmax = 59 was used throughout, as large sample of angles in the xy plane
is required in order to compare directly to measured data. This corresponds to
a pair of particles tracked every 1.5 degrees in the x  y plane. Although the
difference between kmax = 30 and kmax = 59 is of the order of 0.02  for this simu-
lation scenario shown in figure 6.6, including magnetic errors into the simulation
model introduces significant non-linearities. Selecting a kmax value of 59 ensures
that the minimum dynamic aperture is not missed, whilst retaining acceptable
computational times [144].

Figure 6.6: Minimum dynamic aperture as a function of kmax. For kmax < 29
the difference in the minimum dynamic aperture calculated is approximately
0.7 .
Similarly, in order to reduce the uncertainty in the minimum dynamic aperture
calculation, particles were tracked over a large number of turns with the aim
of minimising both the systematic errors from the simulations and the compu-
tational time required to perform the simulations. Therefore the particles were
tracked over 1 106 turns.
In order to compare the results from simulation to measurement, the effect of
proton burn-off on the bunches must also be considered. The dynamic aperture
calculated in Sixtrack does not include particle losses due to head-on collisions
with the counter rotating bunches, however these losses were present during the
long-range beam-beam machine study. The losses due to proton-burn off can be
calculated from the luminosity data and the effect of burn-off can be removed
from the dynamic aperture calculation. An example calculation of the proton
burn off is shown in figure 6.7 and is calculated using the simple formula
B(t) = L(t) in, (6.15)
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 199
where in is the inelastic cross section for proton-proton collision and L is the
bunch luminosity. In the LHC, the inelastic cross section is approximately in 
110 mb [146] and the luminosity during the long-range machine study was L  6
Hz per b. Here the unit of barn is introduced, with 1 barn equal to 1024 cm2.
From this, a burn-off rate of about 58 protons per turn per IP is obtained. The
effect of burn off is removed by then adding the particles lost back to the fractional
intensity in equation 6.7 such that,
D(N) =
2 log(I + Iburnoff ). (6.16)
The particles lost from burn off after 110(6) turns will be approximately 1108
protons. Including these lost protons back into the dynamic aperture calculation
will increase the measured dynamic aperture marginally by approximately 4 
104 . Proton burn-off is not the only source of difference between the measured

6.5.1.1 Errors on Measured Data
In order to calculate the dynamic aperture using equation 6.7 and obtain a re-
alistic calculation, the fractional intensity loss and emittance of the bunches are
required. Details of the relevant LHC beam instrumentation can be found in
chapter 3. In order to calculate the bunch intensity, FBCT data is used and is
accurate to within approximately 1%. The error from the measured intensity will
hence also impact the dynamic aperture calculation. An error of 1% on the bunch
intensity corresponds to approximately 0.01  error in the dynamic aperture. In
addition to the measured intensity, the emittance of the bunch is required to nor-
malise the dynamic aperture to the emittance used in the simulations. The error
from the BSRT is more substantial than the FBCT and corresponds to approx-
imately 10%  20% error [146]. As well as an error in the bunch emittance, an
emittance asymmetry between the bunch planes was also present during the 2016
machine study. The error bars used throughout this analysis took into account
this emittance asymmetry as well as the error from the BSRTs. The error from
the measured bunch parameters were considered, however additional sources of
error which are more difficult to measure should also be discussed briefly. Ef-
fects such as closed orbit drifts, transverse offsets between the colliding bunches
and crossing angle error will all impact the dynamic aperture and the physical
processes that the particles in the bunches experience. Closed orbit drifts will
change the beam trajectory through the IP and may result in a smaller long-
range beam-beam separation and hence a smaller dynamic aperture. Similarly, if
the bunches collide with a transverse offset at the IP, the particles in the bunch
may experience more of the non-linear force of the beam-beam interaction. These
additional sources of non-linearities will all impact the dynamic aperture. These
additional sources and the interplay with the beam-beam interaction is discussed
in the next section.

6.5.2 Comparison to Tracking Simulations
In order to provide an accurate comparison between the measured dynamic aper-
ture and simulated dynamic aperture, baseline simulations were performed at the
same crossing angle steps as the 2016 machine study. The baseline simulations
initially only included beam-beam interactions. Additional effects were then in-
cluded in the simulation model to better model the accelerator dynamics. The
measured dynamic aperture and dynamic aperture from tracking simulations is
shown in figure 6.8, for the nominal colliding bunch. The measured dynamic
aperture was computed at N = 1 106 turns, in order to directly compare to the
results from Sixtrack. In figure 6.8, the red, blue and green points correspond
to the measured dynamic aperture normalised to the RMS value, the horizontal,
and vertical bunch emittances. At small crossing angles below  = 260 rad,

where the beam-beam separation is smaller than 8.5 , the dynamic aperture
compares well for both measured and simulated results. The agreement between
measurement and simulation occurs within the region in which the long-range
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 202
beam-beam interaction is strongest. At small beam-beam separations, the long-
range beam-beam interaction dominates the particle losses and the dynamic aper-
ture, corresponding to losses observed during the 2016 machine study. The small
dynamic aperture causes particles to diffuse to larger amplitudes. These particles
are then lost on the collimators . At crossing angles below  = 220 rad, the dy-
namic aperture is smaller than 3 . This corresponds to a beam-beam separation
of  7 . Here the dynamic aperture is significantly small enough as to cut into
the core of the bunch. This provides a possible explanation as to the apparent
loss of emittance measured by the BSRTs as observed in chapter 5. For dynamic
aperture smaller than 3 , the long-range beam-beam interaction behaves like
a collimator cutting into the core of the bunch. At crossing angles larger than
 = 260 rad, when the beam-beam separation is larger than 8.5 , there is a
clear discrepancy between the simulated and measured dynamic aperture that
cannot be explained by the beam-beam interaction alone. The simulated dy-
namic aperture continues to increase towards larger crossing angles whereas the
measured dynamic aperture appears to saturate at approximately 3.75 .
Previous studies [115, 116, 147] show that the Landau octupoles and chromatic-
ity are known to limit the dynamic aperture towards large crossing angles. The
impact of the parameters on the dynamic aperture whilst including long-range
and head-on beam-beam effects is shown in figure 6.9 for various operational
scenarios. The simulations presented in this chapter use the same operational
settings as the long-range beam-beam machine study with chromaticity and Lan-
dau octupole currents set to Q
= 16 units and Joct = 476 A. This octupole
current gives the octupole strength as koct = 16.27 Tm
3. These sources alone
cannot account for the dynamic aperture difference between measurement and
simulation shown in figure 6.8. Therefore additional physical effects, other than
the beam-beam interaction, which limit the dynamic aperture will be considered,
in order to better explain measured results.
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 203
Figure 6.9: Dynamic aperture simulations for the 2015 LHC operational
configuration, with  = 0.8 m, np = 1.3  1011 ppb, and n = 3.75 m. For
these operational settings, the chromaticity was varied from Q = 15 units to
Q = 2 units and the impact of Landau octupoles on the dynamic aperture
was also investigated [147].
Figure 6.10 shows the measured dynamic aperture for the head-on and nominal
colliding bunches. For beam-beam separations larger than 8.5 , outside the
long-range beam-beam dominated region, the head-on and nominal bunches have
similar dynamic aperture and show no significant differences. The saturation of
the dynamic aperture for these crossing angles is impacting bunches in the beam
irrespective of whether the bunches collide head-on only or experience long-range
interactions. In order to understand the effect limiting the dynamic aperture,
the simplest beam-beam configuration of the head-on only colliding bunch is
considered first.
A comparison between the measured dynamic aperture and the simulated dy-
namic aperture for the head-on only colliding bunch is shown in figure 6.11. In
figure 6.11, the top boundary of the shaded area describes the average dynamic
aperture obtained from tracking simulations. The averaged dynamic aperture is
calculated by taking the mean dynamic aperture over all of the x  y angles.

The lower boundary of the shaded area corresponds to the minimum dynamic
aperture. The minimum dynamic aperture is given by the smallest value of the
dynamic aperture in the x  y plane. The black line describes the collimator
aperture at 6.5. The error bars are calculated by normalising the measured dy-
namic aperture at N = 1 106 turns, to the horizontal and vertical emittances,
whilst including a 20% error on the measured emittance.
The comparison shows a clear discrepancy between the dynamic aperture calcu-
lated from tracking simulations and measured data. The dynamic aperture from
tracking simulations is within the range of 79 , whereas the measured dynamic
aperture lies between 3.5  and 4 . In a real machine like the LHC, collimators
are located around the ring in order to protect cold magnets and sensitive equip-
ment from particle losses [148]. The physical aperture is set by the collimator
openings and defines the maximum amplitude a particle can reach before being
lost. For an emittance of  = 2.5 m, the collimator aperture is set at 6.5 .
Particles at amplitudes larger than this will be lost onto the collimators. As seen

from figure 6.11, the dynamic aperture from simulations suggest that in the real-
istic machine the performance would be limited by the collimator aperture not by
the head-on beam-beam interaction. This suggests that another beam dynamics
process was limiting the measured dynamic aperture during the machine study.
The dynamic aperture as a function of xy plane is shown in figure 6.12 with the
black line representing the collimator aperture. From figure 6.12 an asymmetry
between the beam planes can be observed with the larger dynamic aperture found
in the vertical plane. The reason for the asymmetry observed in figure 6.12 is
unknown and warrants further investigation. Since the dynamic aperture can not
be explained by the beam-beam interaction alone, additional effects which limit
dynamic aperture are included in the simulation to better explain the discrepancy.
Linear coupling is one such effect that is known to impact the dynamic aper-
ture [149]. In the LHC, the linear coupling is approximately |C| = 4  103
during normal luminosity production [150]. Including this value into tracking

simulation reduces the dynamic aperture as seen in figure 6.13. The linear cou-
pling introduces an interplay between the horizontal and vertical planes resulting
in an additional degree of freedom. The additional degree of freedom introduced
by linear coupling may reduce the stable region in phase space to zero and hence
impact particle survivability, as described in ref [122]. The dynamic aperture
obtained from tracking simulations show that the linear coupling reduces the dy-
namic aperture by  1  over all crossing angle steps. The average dynamic
aperture from simulation model still remains larger than the physical aperture
defined by the collimators. The minimum dynamic aperture from the tracking
simulations is within the collimator aperture but still differs from the measured
dynamic aperture by  2 . This suggests that linear coupling and the interplay
with the head-on beam-beam is not solely responsible for the limited measured
dynamic aperture that was observed during the long-range beam-beam machine
study. The dynamic aperture as a function of the x  y plane is shown in fig-
ure 6.14. The asymmetry between the planes is still present and does not change
significantly when including the linear coupling. The linear coupling appears to
reduce the dynamic aperture uniformly in the x  y plane by about 1 . The

aperture, multipole errors in addition to linear coupling and the beam-beam in-
teraction were included into the simulation model. Tracking simulations were
performed using 60 realisations of the LHC lattice for each of crossing angle step.
These simulations were computationally expensive, with each crossing angle pro-
ducing approximately 50, 000 jobs. In order to compute such a large number of
jobs the Boinc infrastructure was used for tracking simulations including mag-
netic errors [151].
The tracking simulations including magnetic errors and linear coupling are shown
in figure 6.15. Including the magnetic errors in the simulation model further re-
duces the dynamic aperture by approximately 11.5  and provides a reasonable
comparison between simulation and measurement. There is still some discrepancy
of approximately 0.5  between the two models. There are a number of possibil-
ities which could explain this. One explanation is the working point chosen for
the simulations may not be quite the same as the measured data. During the
long-range beam-beam machine study a tune drift was observed [152]. The tune

throughout the experiment drifted towards the third order resonance. If parti-
cles moved close to this resonance then they may be excited to larger amplitudes
and then lost. An alternative scenario that causes a reduction in the dynamic
aperture, arises due to a small transverse offset at the IP between the colliding
bunches. In this case, the bunches are exposed to more of the beam-beam non-
linearities, giving particles an amplitude dependent tune shift, which as a result
could lead to particle losses. The transverse offset between the bunches is difficult
to measure and can only be mitigated through luminosity optimisation.
The dynamic aperture in the x  y plane from tracking simulations including
magnetic errors and linear coupling is shown in Figure 6.16. Initial comparison
between the measured and simulated dynamic aperture suggests that there is
some interplay between the head-on beam-beam interaction, the non-linearities
of the interaction region, and linear coupling that causes the dynamic aperture to
saturate towards larger crossing angles. However this is not conclusive and some
discrepancy between the model and the experimental data still exists, and this
needs to be understood. In order to investigate further this interplay, additional
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 210
effects such as the transverse offset, tune drift, and closed orbit drift will be
studied outside of this thesis.
The dynamic aperture for the nominal colliding bunch was also investigated as
shown in figure 6.17. Here the error bars are calculated by normalising the
measured dynamic aperture at N = 1  106 turns, to the measured emittances
in the x and y plane, plus a 10% error on the measured emittance. A similar
saturation of the dynamic aperture was observed for crossing angles larger than
 = 260 rad, corresponding to a beam-beam separation of 8.5 . Figure 6.17
shows the impact of both the head-on and long-range beam-beam interactions on
the dynamic aperture of the nominal colliding bunch at the same crossing angle
steps as the 2016 machine study. Below  = 260 rad, the dynamic aperture is
well described by the tracking simulations. At these crossing angles the beam-
beam separation is smaller than 8.5  and the losses are dominated by the long-
range beam-beam interaction. As a result, the the dynamic aperture reduces
following the crossing angle steps. Above  = 260 rad, outside of the long-range
dominated region, the dynamic aperture from simulation continues to improve
whereas the measured dynamic aperture becomes limited at approximately 3.75 .
Although not conclusive, results from the head-on only case suggest that there
may be an interplay between the beam-beam effects, the non-linearities of the
machine, and the linear coupling, causing a saturation of the dynamic aperture
towards larger crossing angles outside of the long-range beam-beam dominated
region. These effects are then applied to the nominal colliding bunch in order to
investigate the difference between the model and experimental data.
The dynamic aperture from simulation as a function of the x y plane is shown
in figure 6.18, for a nominal colliding bunch. The dynamic aperture for the
nominal colliding bunch in the x  y plane appears to be uniformly distributed
over the different angles and does not show the asymmetry observed for the
head-on only bunch. The dynamic aperture over the different angles is almost

the beam-beam interaction alone cannot account for the dynamic aperture for

Figure 6.19: Dynamic aperture from tracking simulations for the nominal

Previous investigations including linear coupling for the head-on only colliding
bunch shows that this effect reduces the dynamic aperture for  > 260 rad. In
figure 6.19, linear coupling with a value of |C = 4  103| is included in the
tracking simulations. Including linear coupling as shown in figure 6.19 limits the
minimum and average dynamic aperture towards larger crossing angles by ap-
proximately 1 . This is comparable to the observations of the dynamic aperture
reduction for the head-on colliding bunch. The dynamic aperture as a function
of the x  y plane including linear coupling is shown in figure 6.20. The linear
coupling does not impact the smaller crossing angles, below  = 260 rad, with
the losses continuing to be dominated by the long-range beam-beam interaction.
For the larger crossing angle steps above  = 260 rad, the dynamic aperture is
reduced and the difference between each crossing angle step is also reduced.
Finally magnetic errors were included in the simulations and were expected to
impact the dynamic aperture outside of the long-range beam-beam dominated
region. The tracking simulations including magnetic errors and linear coupling,
compared to the measured dynamic aperture are shown in figure 6.21 and 6.22.

Including 60 realisations of the lattice provides a realistic estimate of the non-
linearities of the machine [144]. The magnetic errors, in combinations with the
beam-beam interaction and linear coupling, impact dynamic aperture for crossing
angles above  = 260 rad. The magnetic errors act to further reduce the
dynamic aperture for these angles. The dynamic aperture including these errors,
well describes the measured dynamic aperture over all of the crossing angle steps.
The possible interplay between the magnetic errors, linear coupling and the beam-
beam interaction appears to saturate the dynamic aperture outside of the long-
range beam-beam dominated region and may provide an explanation for the
limited dynamic aperture observed during the 2016 machine study.
The magnetic errors and non-linearities in the IRs may be one source of the lim-
ited dynamic aperture for  > 260 rad and arises due to the crossing angle and
the path of the beams through the triplet. For large crossing angles, the beams
will travel off centre through the inner triplet quadrupoles. The field quality for
these magnets is best towards the centre and hence, if the beams are offset, the
bunches experience stronger non-linearities. These non-linearities can result in
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 214
chaotic particle motion or move particles onto resonant tunes which may cause
particle losses and hence reduce the dynamic aperture. For large crossing angles
and beam-beam separations above 8.5 , the dynamic aperture will saturate and
may possibly become limited by the non-linearities of the triplets. For a cross-
ing angle of  < 260 rad, the beams are no longer offset as much through the
magnet centre, therefore the magnetic non-linearities of the triplet become have
a smaller impact on the dynamic aperture. However, the beam-beam separation
is smaller and the long-range beam-beam interaction will begin to dominate the
losses instead.
The non-linearities will also further affect the dynamic aperture when  is small.
In order to obtain tightly squeezed beams and a -function at IP1 and IP5 of
0.4 m, the bunches have to be blown up through the triplet. The -function
through the IP is shown in figure 3.2 in chapter 3. As a result, the bunches again
travel off centre through the triplet magnets causing a feed down effect of the
non-linear magnet errors which scale approximately with ()
2 , where n is the
magnetic multipole order [4, 153]. However in order to conclusively determine
whether it is the interplay between the beam-beam effects, linear coupling, and
magnetic non-linearities, additional studies are required. Other effects should be
considered that may impact the dynamic aperture at larger crossing angles such
as a traverse offset between the colliding beams, closed orbit drift, larger values of
linear coupling, and tune drift. These effects will be investigated further outside
of this thesis and in addition the dynamic aperture model will then be compared
to experimental data from the 2015 long-range beam-beam machine study.

6.6 Conclusion
The aim of this chapter was to investigate and benchmark existing models in
Sixtrack, to measured data obtained during the 2016 long-range beam-beam
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 216
machine study. In order to achieve this, the dynamic aperture from intensity
loss was calculated. To provide a more accurate comparison to the simulation
model, the effect of proton burn-off was removed and the dynamic aperture from
measurement was normalised to the emittance of n = 2.5 m. For the head-on
only and nominal colliding bunches, a clear discrepancy was observed between
measured dynamic aperture and the simulation model including only beam-beam
effects. The simulation model predicted a continuous improvement of dynamic
aperture for crossing angles larger than  = 260 rad. Instead however, the
measured dynamic aperture saturates at approximately  = 260 rad and re-
mains around 3.75 . In order to investigate a possible explanation, the simplest
beam-beam configuration of the head-on only colliding bunch was considered
first. Including only the head-on beam-beam interaction in the model predicts a
dynamic aperture of 7.5 9.5 , which lies outside of the collimator aperture at
6.5 . However the measured dynamic aperture remains at approximately 3.75 .
This suggests that the head-on beam-beam interaction alone cannot account for
the observations during the 2016 machine study. To improve the model, addi-
tional sources that impact the dynamic aperture were introduced. Firstly linear
coupling, with typical values obtained during normal operation were included.
Linear coupling was shown to reduce the dynamic aperture by approximately
1 . As a result, the minimum dynamic aperture from the model dropped be-
low the collimator aperture, and remained around  5.8  6 . The average
dynamic aperture still remained above the collimator aperture however. This
indicates that both linear coupling and the beam-beam interaction alone cannot
account for the observed dynamic aperture. The LHC machine is complicated
and contains multiple sources of magnetic errors and misalignments. In the pre-
vious simulation models, the non-linearities of the machine, such as magnetic
errors and magnetic misalignments were not included. Finally the non-linearities
of the machine were included into the simulation model and this was shown to
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 217
further reduce the dynamic aperture. Including these errors in the model reduces
minimum and average dynamic aperture almost entirely below the collimator
aperture. There is still approximately a 0.5  difference between the measured
dynamic aperture and the dynamic aperture from models. This difference may be
accountable due to a number of issues such as transverse offset or tune working
point that is still to be investigated outside of this thesis. It appears as if the in-
terplay between linear coupling, magnetic errors and the beam-beam interaction
all impact and limit the dynamic aperture at  3.75 .
For the nominal colliding bunch, the model and measured dynamic aperture
compares well below  = 260 rad. Within this region, the long-range beam-
beam interaction is strong and is the main contribution to the particle losses.
Outside of this region however, for  > 260 rad and beam-beam separations
> 8.5 , the model shows a continuous improvement in dynamic aperture, whereas
the measured dynamic aperture saturates, in a similar way to the head-on bunch,
at 3.75 . Linear coupling was then added to the simulation model. This reduced
the dynamic aperture for crossing angles steps larger than  = 260 rad by
approximately 1. In the same way as for the head-on bunch, this suggests
that linear coupling in combination with the beam-beam interaction is not the
sole source responsible for limiting the dynamic aperture. To further improve
the model and hence compare to a more realistic scenario observed during the
machine study, the non-linear errors of the machine were included. These again
impacted the dynamic aperture for beam-beam separations larger than 8.5 ,
but did not impact separations smaller than this. Outside of the long-range
beam-beam dominated region, the minimum dynamic aperture further reduced
by approximately 0.51 . Including magnetic errors, linear coupling and beam-
beam effects into the model appears to provides a sufficient explanation for the
observed dynamic aperture obtained during the 2016 machine study, however this
needs to be studied in more detail. The interplay between these effects appear
Chapter 6: Dynamic Aperture and The Long-Range Beam-Beam Interaction 218
to saturate and limit the dynamic aperture for the nominal colliding bunch at
 > 260 rad. This saturation likely arises due to the trajectory of the bunches
through the inner triplet quadrupoles. At larger crossing angles, the bunches are
off-centred through the inner triplet quadrupoles, resulting in a larger sampling of
the magnetic field errors. This in combination with a small , possibly causes the
non-linearities of the magnets to induce chaotic motion or cause particles to cross
resonant tunes. These mechanisms can result in particle losses and hence limit the
dynamic aperture to 3.75 . However further work and additional mechanisms
which limit the dynamic aperture need to be investigated further. Effects such as
transverse offset between the colliding bunches, orbit drift, tune drift, and larger
values of linear coupling can all impact the dynamic aperture. Further work
is due to be conducted outside of this thesis and compared to other long-range
beam-beam machine studies with different  and optics configurations. This
will allow the dynamic aperture model to be improved and benchmarked against
experimental data.
In the context of the LHC luminosity performance, these studies have shown
that the combination of beam-beam effects and the non-linearities of the inner
triplet can saturate the dynamic aperture for a particular machine configuration.
Although the dynamic aperture may not necessarily correspond to particle losses,
it implies that the particle motion may be chaotic for a signifiant proportion of
the bunch. With regard to future performance, the non-linearities of the machine
may further restrict the choice of operational parameters for  and crossing angle
 and impact with luminosity reach.

Summary and Conclusions
7.1 Summary
The LHC is an intricate and complicated machine that presents a number of chal-
lenges for accelerator physicists working within the field. In order to improve the
machine performance and learn for future machines, a detailed understanding of
the physical processes that the beams undergo is required. The aim of this thesis
was to present some of the challenges from the perspective of the beam-beam
interaction, overcome these challenges, and improve the machine performance.
In this thesis, the luminosity performance limitations due to beam-beam interac-
tion have been investigated. The beam-beam interaction can significantly impact
the machine performance. Understanding the beam-beam interaction and the
limiting factors from this effect, allow the LHC luminosity performance to be
improved, whilst simultaneously gaining experience for the operation of future
machines like the HL-LHC. This understanding of beam-beam effects and other
limiting factors in the LHC has allowed the luminosity reach to be increased
each year, by pushing the optics to smaller  values whilst retaining luminosity
lifetimes larger than 10 hours, ensuring long fill lengths.
Chapter 7: Summary and Conclusions 220
Challenges in future machines will be different to that of the LHC, but gaining
vital operational experience now will be invaluable for future colliders. The HL-
LHC will push the luminosity reach even further by increasing the bunch intensity,
reducing the bunch emittance and operating at a smaller . One aspect that
arises when operating at a small  is the hourglass effect. The hourglass effect
will reduce the luminosity and hence impact the machine performance. In order
to describe this effect, a new method was derived in chapter 4, which allowed
analytic expressions to be obtained whilst the charge density distribution did
not remain fixed throughout the interaction. This was applied to a number of
non-Gaussian charge density distributions and where possible, the result was
compared to literature. The standard 2-dimensional Gaussian electric field was
re-derived to validate the theory. The method was then applied to describe
the hourglass effect. An analytical expression in the rest frame of the bunch
was obtained and compared to the standard fixed Gaussian bunch distribution.
Although the method has been successful in allowing an analytical expression for
the hourglass effect to be obtained, further work outside of this thesis is required
to test and refine the calculation using a tracking code. To include the expression
into a tracking code, the electric field should be boosted into the collision frame
and the kick should be derived. This work is on-going outside of this thesis.
In addition to the theoretical work, experimental and simulation work was carried
out, whilst based at CERN. The experimental and simulation work involved inves-
tigating the impact of the long-range beam-beam interactions on the luminosity
performance and the  reach, during the 2015 and 2016 proton-proton run. The
machine studies took place in order to identify the beam lifetime dependancy
on the long-range beam-beam separation and to compare the measurements to
predictions from models. In addition to this, these studies allowed the luminosity
reach to be determined in the LHC, by reducing the crossing angle to the smallest

value, before additional losses occurred due to the long-range beam-beam interac-
tion. The minimum crossing angle and beam-beam separation was identified for
two different collision optics with  = 0.8 m and  = 0.4 m. During the 2016
proton-proton run, with bunch intensities and emittances of np = 1.3 1011 ppb
and n = 2.5 m, the minimum crossing angle was identified at  = 260 rad,
which corresponds to a beam-beam separation of 7.5 . This allowed the crossing
angle to be reduced from  = 370 rad to  = 280 rad during normal lumi-
nosity production fills. This lead to an increase in luminosity of approximately
10 15%, improving machine performance of 2016.
In order to understand the physics processes impacting the beam and luminosity
lifetimes, a computational study was performed comparing measured data, dis-
cussed in chapter 5, to tracking simulations of the long-range beam-beam machine
study. These studies are discussed in depth in chapter 6 and allowed measured
data to be compared directly to predictions from models. Comparing the head-
on colliding bunches to the simulation model showed that there was a significant
disagreement between measurement and model, which could not be explained by
the head-on beam-beam interaction alone. In order to better understand the dis-
crepancy, additional processes that impact the dynamic aperture were included
in the model. Firstly, linear coupling was included. This was shown to reduce the
dynamic aperture by approximately 1 . However, this alone could not account
for the dynamic aperture at crossing angles larger than  = 260 rad. Magnetic
errors were also included in the simulation model and brings the dynamic aper-
ture to within approximately 0.5  of the measured data. A number of possible
explanations for the differences between the model and the measured data are
discussed. The dynamic aperture for the nominal colliding bunch was also com-
pared to the simulation model. For crossing angles and beam-beam separations
smaller than  = 260 rad and 8.5 , the dynamic aperture is well described
by the beam-beam interaction. Within this region, the long-range beam-beam
Chapter 7: Summary and Conclusions 222
interaction is strong and dominates the particle losses. For crossing angles larger
than  = 260 rad, the dynamic aperture predicted by the model continues
to improve, whereas the measured dynamic aperture saturates to approximately
3.75 . Including both magnetic errors and linear coupling, provides a good
comparison between the model and measured dynamic aperture for the nominal
colliding bunch. This study suggests that the interplay between the beam-beam
interaction, linear coupling, and the non-linearities of the machine have a signifi-
cant impact on the dynamic aperture for crossing angles larger than  = 260 rad
and beam-beam separations greater than 8.5 . The impact of magnetic errors
on the dynamic aperture is not negligible, especially as the demand for smaller
 increases. For a smaller  the bunches are blown up more in the triplet. As a
result the beams experience more of the non-linearities of the triplet. These non-
linearities can be strong and when combined with beam-beam effects and linear
coupling, limit the dynamic aperture. These studies show that there is a compli-
cated interplay between the non-linearities of the machine and the beam-beam
interaction which significantly impact the dynamic aperture. The measured data
does however, compare well to predictions from models. This allows accurate
predications to be made for future machine configurations.
The research performed in this thesis has provided an improved understanding of
beam-beam effects in the LHC and the impact of these effects on the luminosity
performance for the LHC and the future HL-LHC. This research, collectively, will
enable future machine performance to be pushed, allowing larger luminosity to
be reached.
Appendix A
The Method of Characteristics
The subject of partial differential equations are of great interest to a number
of different fields outside of mathematics, such as physics, financial economics,
computational biology and chemistry among others. This appendix will provide
a brief review of one particular method of solving partial differential equations.
A.1 Method of Characteristics
The method of characteristics is an approach that may allow solutions of partial
differential equations to be obtained. Solutions can be found by reducing the
equation to a family of ordinary differential equations using characteristic curves.
The so called characteristic curves can then be integrated to find solutions to
the original hyperbolic partial differential equation. This method is general for
n-dimensions and can even be extended, under some circumstances to non-linear
equation. Consider the 2-dimensional vector functions f1 and f3 related to one
another through the homogenous partial differential equation,
f3xf2 + f1yf2 = 0, (A.1)
Appendix A. The Method of Characteristics 224
where f2 is some hyper-surface. The term hyper-surface in this instance cor-
responds to a plane or surface that can take any number of dimensions. To
find the characteristic curves, the functions f1 and f3 must be orthogonal to the
hyper-surface f2. Hence, the functions f1, f3 and f2 are related to one another
through
(f1  f3)f2 = 0. (A.2)
Equation A.2 can be expressed as equations,
f1yf2  f3xf2 = 0, (A.3)
Considering equation A.3 and rearranging for f1/f3 gives
. (A.4)
Treating the ordinary differential of the hyper-surface df2 = 0 as constant, then
the ordinary differentials are related to the partial differentials through
df2 = xf2dx+ yf2dy,
xf2dx = yf2dy,
Substituting back into equation A.4 gives
f1dx+ f3dy = 0. (A.5)
Appendix A. The Method of Characteristics 225
Integrating this gives the equation gives the condition that characteristic curves
must satisfy. Hence,
f2 = f2
f1dx+
is true under the condition that f1 and f3 are functions of only x and y respec-
tively. Briefly, some examples of the method of characteristics will be provided
in the following sections.
A.1.1 Example 1:
Considering the homogenous partial differential equation
x2yg(x, y) yxg(x, y) = 0, (A.6)
where g(x, y) is some arbitrary function. Applying the method of characteristics
gives the ordinary differential equation as,
. (A.7)
Collecting functions that contain x and y only gives the ordinary differential
equation under the condition that dg = 0, then the integral to evaluate is
x2dx+
ydy = 0 (A.8)
Hence the function g
g = g
. (A.9)
This gives the functional form of g, that solves equation A.6.
