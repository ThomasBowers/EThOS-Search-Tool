DEATH METAL: Characterising the effects of 
environmental lead pollution on mobility and 
childhood health within the Roman Empire.

ABSTRACT 
The use of lead was ubiquitous throughout the Roman Empire, including as material for 
water pipes, eating vessels and as a sweetener for wine. Children are particularly 
susceptible to the effects of lead and it is likely that the widespread use of this deadly 
metal amongst Roman populations led to a range of adverse health effects. Indeed, lead 
poisoning has even been implicated in the downfall of the Roman Empire. This research 
examines the direct effect of lead poisoning on the inhabitants of the Empire, and for 
the first time introduces a bioarchaeological perspective to how lead exposure affected 
health during the Roman period. The results provide strong evidence that Roman lead 
pollution contributed to the high prevalence of metabolic diseases during childhood and 
implicates elevated lead burdens in the high prevalence of infant remains in Roman 
skeletal assemblages. 
This study has also shown the effectiveness of lead isotope analysis as a tool in 
archaeological migration studies. The successful establishment of baseline lead isotope 
ranges in previously unstudied regions of the Roman Empire has greatly enhanced our 
ability to identify the potential origins of isotopic outliers. Although this study has 
shown that anthropogenic lead isotope ratios are not country specific, the results have 
demonstrated that lead isotope ratios can differentiate between populations based on the 
orogenic age of the region in which an individual spent their childhood. This has 
improved our understanding of how anthropogenic lead isotope ratios in Roman 
individuals varies across a continent, and has demonstrated that lead isotope ratios are 
capable of discriminating between geographical regions of origin when other isotope 
system are not.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
Firstly I would like to thank my extraordinary supervisory team, Prof. Janet 
Montgomery, Prof. Rebecca Gowland and Prof. Jane Evans. All of who allowed me the 
space to plod along in my own quiet way and were always there to offer advice, support 
and encouragement when I needed it. All three women were a constant source of 
inspiration and motivation and I am extremely grateful for having had the opportunity to 
work with such trailblazers. 
I would also like to thank Dr. Vanessa Pashley and Elliott Hamilton at NIGL for their 
help and guidance prepping samples for and using ICP-MS, as well as for their infinite 
patience when I had endless questions about the intricacies of mass spectrometry.  
This project truly was a collaborative effort and would not have been possible without 
the generosity and support of Dr. Ccile Chapelain de Serveille-Niel (Universit de 
Caen), Dr. Mihai Gligor (Universitea 1 Decenbrie 1918 Alba Iulia), Dr. Josep Anton 
Remol (Museu Nacional Arqueolgia de Tarragona, MNAT), Dr. Emili Revilla 
Cubero (Museu dHistria de Barcelona, MUHBA), the Lebanese Directorate General 
of Antiquities and the Lebanese Ministry of Culture. I would like to thank each of them 
for allowing not only unrestricted access to their Roman skeletal remains and related 
contextual data, but also for allowing the necessary destructive sampling of such 
precious material.  
My friends and colleagues, Laura Castells-Navarro and Vana Kalenderian also deserve 
special recognition for facilitating access to Spanish and Lebanese skeletal material 
respectively. The osteological and contectual data from Lebanon are derived from V. 
Kalenderians PhD at the University of Groningen titled Resurrecting Berytus: 
Osteoarchaeological analysis and evaluation of mortuary practices and cultural 
exchange (1st c. BC  4th c. AD).  Permission to study this material was given to V. 
Kalenderian by the Lebanese Directorate General of Antiquities (with special 
acknowledgements to Mr. S. El Khoury, Dr. A. Seif and Dr. G. A. Diwan). 
I would like to thank all of my family for their unwavering support and encouragement, 
even if being constantly asked are you nearly finished yet? was slightly grating by the 
fourth year. Sara deserves special acknowledgment for reading everything I threw at her 
with minimal complaint, I am eternally grateful for having a twin with such relentless 
faith in me. 
Finally, I would like to thank my dear friend Michelle Williams-Ward for her 
unwavering support, advice and understanding not only over the past four years but 
throughout our decade long academic endeavour. Having someone that didnt mind my 
rambling phone calls to discuss what must have been mind-numbingly dull Roman 
related dilemmas or to just listen to me moan was absolutely invaluable.

CHAPTER ONE 
Introduction 
1.1 Research context 
1.1.1 Using lead isotopes to explore migration. 
Lead is ubiquitous within the environment, found within most rocks, soils, and water 
systems. It has both common (204Pb) and radiogenic (206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb) sources that 
combine to create specific isotope characteristics, the variability of which reflects the 
underlying geology of the local area (Faure, 1986). Humans incorporate lead into their 
body through dietary consumption and inhalation, where it is predominantly stored 
within the mineral matrices of teeth and bones (Gulson et al., 1997a; Waldron, 1983). 
The interpretation of lead isotope ratios in archaeological skeletal remains for the 
purpose of investigating mobility and migration has been developed predominantly 
from research carried out on British populations (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et 
al., 2014, 2010, 2005; Shaw et al., 2016). Although the use of lead isotope ratios to 
answer questions surrounding geographic origins is beginning to gain momentum in 
European and North American studies (Keller et al., 2016; Price et al., 2017a, 2017b, 
2017c; Sharpe et al., 2016).  
One of the first applications of lead isotope ratios in archaeological human remains was 
carried out using four bone samples from the Roman site of Poundbury Camp, Dorset 
(Molleson et al., 1986). However, it was not until the work of Montgomery (2002) that 
real strides in the advancement of lead isotope analysis of archaeological human 
remains were made. Montgomery (2002) developed a methodology that minimised the 
risk of contamination from the burial environment, providing a means of confidently 
assessing in vivo lead characteristics. Through diachronic analysis of tooth enamel 
samples spanning from the Neolithic to the Medieval period, Montgomery (2002) 
established the baseline for human lead isotope ratios in England and Wales. This 
research also demonstrated for the first time how local lead isotope ratios altered 
depending upon the type of exposure (geogenic or anthropogenic) dominating an 
individuals environment. In prehistoric societies lead incorporated into bodily tissues 
tends to reflect natural, geogenic lead concentrations, allowing for regionally specific 
signatures to be used as tracers in archaeological migration studies (Montgomery, 2002; 
Montgomery et al., 2000). However, with the advent of metallurgical technologies 
(mining, smelting etc.) and the subsequent increases in environmental pollution and use 
of lead compounds, human lead isotope ratios alter to reflect exploited lead ore sources 
(Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010).  
It has been shown that lead ore isotope ratios vary throughout the world because they 
are formed at different times (McCrady, 1952; Sangster et al., 2000). As Roman human 
lead isotope ratios are dominated by lead ore isotope ratios it is probable that human 
lead isotope ratios also differ by geographic region. Montgomery et al., (2002, 2010) 
deomonstrated that archaeological British populations have lead isotope ratios 
consistent with British lead ore, and collated data from archaeological populations from 
across the world deomonstrate that human lead isotope ratios differ on a continental 
scale (berg et al., 1998; Montgomery, 2005; Turner, 2009; Bower et al., 2007; 
Valentine, 2008). However, little has been done to assess how, or if lead isotope ratios 
differ significantly within a single continent. 
Research focusing on the Roman period has demonstrated that these anthropogenic lead 
isotope ratios can be used to successfully identify migrants in culturally mixed 
populations (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). However, 
despite being a population well-known for the extensive movement of people and a 
popular target for migration studies, there is a notable lack of comparable human lead 
isotope data from regions of the Empire outside of Britain. As a result, studies have had 
to use lead ore datasets as proxies for human isotope ratios when attempting to establish 
local ranges and identify migrants in Roman populations (Montgomery, 2002; 
Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). This research aims to address this issue by 
establishing the lead isotope ratios in skeletal material excavated from sites across 
Europe to ascertain how they differ with socio-cultural and geographic variation and 
provide an initial baseline in human lead isotope ratios for different regions of the 
Roman Empire.  
1.1.2 Investigating lead poisoning within the Roman Empire 
Few theories evoke more fervent debate than what might have brought about the fall of 
the Roman Empire. For centuries scholars have put forth arguments for a plethora of 
singular causes for its decline, positing everything from the conversion to Christianity 
to overexpansion (Gilfillan, 1990). It is, however, the notion that lead poisoning was a 
key contributing factor behind its decline that has captured the interest of scholars and 
general enthusiasts alike. The urban myth-like quality that this theory has taken on has 
ensured its endurance. Historical texts describe a range of maladies associated with lead 
poisoning, affirming that Roman populations did indeed suffer the deleterious effects of 
lead toxicity (Lessler, 1988; Needleman, 2009; Retief and Cilliers, 2006; Waldron, 
1973). It was Nriagus (1983a) use of this historical literature to demonstrate the 
endemic nature of lead poisoning and its consequences that gave support to the role that 
lead played in the downfall of the Empire. Despite how mainstream the theory of 
endemic lead poisoning became, many scholars refuted the claims. Some openly 
questioned the validity of the translations of the ancient texts and suggested that lead 
pollution during the Roman period was not significant enough to have resulted in the 
Empires decline (Cilliers and Retief, 2014; Drasch, 1982; Gaebel, 1983; Needleman 
and Needleman, 1985; Scarborough, 1984). Although it may never be possible to truly 
ascertain the role, if any, that lead poisoning played in the fall of Rome, the effect it had 
on childhood health and mortality throughout the Empire can be explored directly via 
skeletal analysis.  
Studies that have analysed lead concentrations in Roman skeletal material reveal lead 
burdens up to three times higher than what is today considered severely toxic 
(Montgomery et al., 2010). Therefore, it could be surmised that lead was deleterious to 
Roman health, especially in children, who are more susceptible to lead poisoning than 
adults (Needleman, 2004). The demographic profiles of Romano-British skeletal 
populations attest to the fragility of childhood health during this period, especially 
within the first year of life (Carroll, 2014). It is therefore surprising that so little 
research exists on childhood lead burdens and their effects on Roman non-adult health 
and mortality. This research will explore whether the extensive use of lead in the 
Roman Empire contributed to the high infant mortalitiy rates evident in Roman skeletal 
populations. Offering new insights into the impact of anthropogenic lead exploitation on 
child health within the Roman Empire and how this may have differed according to 
geographic and socio-cultural variations.  
1.2 Research aims 
The overarching aim of this project is to explore how exposure to anthropogenic lead 
pollution during the Roman period impacted upon childhood health, and what this 
exposure can tell us about geographic mobility within the Empire. It focuses upon the 
use of lead isotopes as a discriminant in migration studies and attempts to determine the 
extent of variation in lead isotope ratios between modern countries via a highly polluted 
archaeological population. This study also aims to determine how lead pollution 
impacted upon the health and mortality of children within the Roman Empire, and 
examine which, if any, skeletal markers of disease can be used to help identify 
individuals suffering from lead poisoning. 
1.2.1 Objectives 
 Investigate the impact lead burdens had upon the health of Roman children 
throughout the Empire via paired analysis of tooth enamel lead concentrations 
and osteological data from non-adult skeletal remains. 
 Determine whether variations in socio-cultural and geographic origins influence 
childhood lead burdens by interpreting contextual information alongside lead 
concentration data.  
 Ascertain whether anthropogenic lead pollution could have contributed to the 
high infant mortality rates observed in Roman skeletal populations through the 
comparison of lead concentrations and age-at-death.  
 Establish how skeletal lead isotope ratios vary between different regions of the 
Roman Empire by analysing tooth enamel lead isotope ratios in Roman skeletal 
populations from different regions of the empire.  
 Explore the usefulness of lead isotope ratios in human tooth enamel in 
identifying migrants in culturally mixed Roman skeletal populations by 
combining lead isotope data with contextual information. 
1.3 Period of study 
In order to determine how anthropogenic lead isotope ratios can be used to establish 
geographic origins from archaeological skeletal material, a population known for its use 
of lead and lead products is essential. In this respect the Romans provide a perfect study 
population. The use of lead was ubiquitous throughout the Roman Empire. This 
versatile metal was included in everything from water pipes, building materials and 
eating vessels, to medicine, make-up and food sweeteners (Gilfillan, 1990). The 
significant increase in the bioavailability of lead throughout this period resulted in 
widespread exposure to unprecedented levels of the toxic metal (Needleman, 1991; 
Nriagu, 1983). The in vivo anthropogenic lead isotope ratios this type of exposure 
creates, makes Roman skeletal assemblages ideal study populations. Not only for 
determining the efficacy of anthropogenic lead isotope ratios in archaeological 
migration studies but also for assessing how leads exposure impacted upon health.   
The Roman Empire (27 BC  476 AD) was amongst the most powerful economic, 
cultural, political and military forces in the world at this time. At the peak of its power it 
covered 5 million square kilometres, ruling over an estimated 60 - 70 million people 
across parts of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia (Taagepera, 1979; Turchin et al., 
2006). Approximately 21% of the world's population during this period, lived within the 
Empires borders, ensuring its place as one of the largest empires in world history 
(Potter, 2004, p. 17). An integral part of the development, expansion and maintenance 
of this vast territory was the movement of people to and from all regions of the Roman 
Empire (Hin, 2013; Killgrove, 2013; Scheidel, 2001). Migration was not limited to 
those of a low socioeconomic status looking to improve their livelihoods elsewhere. But 
included people from all levels of society hoping to better their life station or take on 
administrative or entrepreneurial roles in newly acquired lands (Sweetman, 2011; 
Tacoma, 2016; Woolf, 2013). Whatever the reason for migration within the empire, it is 
clear that levels of migration were both high and multidirectional (Killgrove, 2014). 
With their inclination for migration and unprecedented levels of lead exposure, Roman 
skeletal populations offer the chance to assess whether variations in human lead isotope 
ratios are sensitive enough to identify outliers in what are assumed to be culturally 
mixed skeletal populations.  
1.4 Sample population 
The analysis of lead isotope ratios from different regions of the Roman Empire provides 
a means of assessing how well lead isotope ratios can discriminate between 
contemporaneous individuals from different countries. An approach that is, to date, 
unique in bioarchaeological studies. This study incorporates eight Roman populations 
(1st to 4th centuries AD), from seven different regions of the Roman Empire (see Fig. 
1.1). Sites were chosen based on their location within the Empire. Different regions that 
encompassed a large proportion of the Roman Empire were needed to allow 
visualisation of how lead isotopes within a highly polluted and mobile population varied 
according to geographic region. To that end, skeletal assemblages from Scotland, 
England, Spain, France, Slovenia, Romania and Lebanon were included in this study. In 
doing so, an expanse of the Roman Empire spanning from its most north-westerly 
outpost to its most easterly province was covered.   
The dispersed locations of sites provided the opportunity to assess the discriminant 
resolution offered by human lead isotope ratios in contemporaneous populations across 
a continent, plus Lebanon. The widespread geographical locations of samples 
incorporated into this study also facilitated a means of acquiring and establishing human 
lead isotope ranges from regions of the Roman Empire where there is currently no 
comparative data. Although the anthropogenic lead isotope range for humans exposed 
to English and Welsh lead ore has been well established (Budd et al., 2004; 
Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010), eight Roman individuals from Britain 
were also analysed in this current study. This small group of individuals were included 
due to their unusual burial rites. Six of these individuals were excavated in Musselburgh, 
Scotland near a fort on the Antonine wall, all six individuals exhibited skeletal evidence 
for decapitation and trauma. The remaining two individuals were from lead coffin 
burials excavated in York and Ilchester, England. Both are uncommon burial rites in 
Roman Britain, and have previously been shown to be associated with migrants 
(Montgomery et al., 2010; Mldner et al., 2011). These two case studies (Musselburgh 
and Lead coffin burials) also provide a means of testing the usefulness of lead isotope 
ratios in discerning an individuals geographic origins using the data obtained in this 
study.

1.5 Structure of the thesis 
The following four chapters discuss the relevant background literature that forms the 
basis for the current study. Chapter Two introduces lead and the premise behind using 
lead isotope analysis to investigate the geographical origins of people from 
archaeological populations. Chapter Three discusses current isotope systems used to 
identify migrants in archaeological populations and focuses on the type of populations 
suited to anthropogenic lead isotope studies. This chapter also summarises how the 
Romans, a population well-known for their extensive exploitation of lead and 
propensity for migration, make an ideal study population. Chapter Four explores the 
biochemical interactions of lead poisoning within the human body to inform our 
understanding of the way in which lead poisoning may manifest in skeletal remains, 
how lead burdens can be quantified, and how this can be used to inform our 
interpretations of lead poisoning in archaeological populations. Chapter Five reviews 
literature relating to health and mortality during the Roman period, outlining current 
reasoning for the poor health and high infant mortality rates during this time and 
positing the role that lead poisoning may have contributed to this.  
Chapter Six focuses on the methodology employed in this study. It presents the 
archaeological sites and the sample population included in this study, and details the 
sampling strategy, sample preparation method and analytical techniques used to obtain 
and interpret the data collected. The results are presented and discussed in Chapters 
Seven and Eight. Chapter Seven draws together the results of the trace element analysis 
and palaeopathological data obtained from osteological analysis to offer a 
comprehensive overview of how lead burdens impacted upon health and mortality in the 
past. While Chapter Eight presents the results of the lead isotope analysis, with 
discussions focusing on determining the resolution at which geographical origins can be 
determined within the Roman Empire. The efficacy of lead isotope ratios in identifying 
migrants from culturally mixed, polluted populations is also discussed here. The 
concluding chapter provides a brief synopsis of the thesis followed by the overarching 
findings of the research and suggestions for further work. All of the isotope and trace 
element data is tabulated in the appendices.  
CHAPTER TWO 
Lead Analysis in Bioarchaeology 
2.1 Introduction 
One of the fundamental questions often posed in bioarchaeology pertains to human 
migration and mobility. Do the individuals within a given skeletal population represent 
individuals from the same or varied biological and socio-cultural groups? Traditionally, 
anthroposcopic and anthropometric analysis techniques were the predominant 
methodological approaches used to investigate migration within a skeletal population. 
However, with advancements in chemical analyses, isotopic studies are coming to the 
forefront in addressing questions pertaining to cultural affiliation (Bentley, 2006; 
Katzenberg, 2008; Nehlich, 2015; Montgomery et al., 2010). It has been well 
documented that various isotope systems (e.g. C, N, O, Sr, S, H, Pb), have the potential 
to be powerful discriminants in origin studies, and are therefore increasingly used to 
investigate the mobility of archaeological populations (berg et al., 1998; Beard and 
Johnson, 2000; Bentley, 2006; Chenery et al., 2012; Sealy et al., 1995). However, lead 
(Pb) despite its potential, has received comparatively less attention than other isotope 
systems such as strontium (Sr) and oxygen (O).  
Lead is widely dispersed within the environment from both common and radiogenic 
sources, which combine to create geologically specific isotope characteristics. When 
viewed as isotope ratios these characteristics can be used as isotopic signatures or 
fingerprints for identifying geogenic and anthropogenic lead sources in provenance 
studies, whether they be human, artefact or otherwise (Wilson et al., 2006). A wealth of 
provenance studies, especially those focusing on archaeological artefacts, has proven 
lead to be an effective discriminatory tool. However, from a bioarchaeological 
perspective lead, despite its potential to discriminate between exposures to different ore 
sources, has been under utilised when compared to the use of other isotope systems in 
mobility studies. This is somewhat surprising as lead offers several advantages over 
lighter isotopes, and those with only one radiogenic parent, such as strontium (Gulson, 
1986). Due to its high atomic weight, lead does not fractionate in the low temperature 
processes that alter the composition of lighter elements, and its relative rarity compared 
to elements such as carbon, nitrogen or hydrogen mean that there is less scope for 
mixing from innumerable source (Gulson, 1986). 
The interpretation of lead isotopes in archaeological skeletal remains for the purpose of 
investigating mobility and migration has been developed predominantly from research 
carried out on British populations (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010, 2014, 
2005; Shaw et al., 2016). There appears to be an increasing use of lead isotope ratios in 
Roman migration studies. Focus on this period derives mainly from the extensive 
exploitation of lead throughout this time, and the resultant environmental pollution that 
created elevated human lead burdens, coupled with homogenised lead isotope ratios. 
These isotope ratios are thought to represent the dominant anthropogenic ore source 
utilised by a particular population. As such, migrant individuals who spent their 
childhood in a different country or region to that in which they were interred would 
have been exposed to different anthropogenic ore sources to those considered local to 
their interment area. Therefore, they would exhibit lead isotope ratios that are distinct 
from those of the local population, making the identification of migrants in a culturally 
mixed skeletal population relatively easy. A number of bioarchaeological studies have 
shown that the lead isotope ratios in the majority of Romano-British skeletal remains 
are congruent with the isotopic range expected from exposure to British lead ore sources, 
and that those with isotope ratios inconsistent with this British range are easily 
identified (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). However, 
there is a notable lack of comparative data for human skeletal material excavated from 
Roman period sites throughout the rest of Europe. This limits any possible 
interpretation of non-British human lead isotope ratios identified in British populations, 
as there is little to no reference data available for direct comparison. Instead lead isotope 
ratios obtained from artefacts of known provenance have to be used as a proxy. This 
research will address this by determining the lead isotope ratios in Roman individuals 
from several countries from within what was the Roman Empire, establishing if and 
how human lead isotope ratios vary in Roman individuals from different geographical 
regions across Europe and to what extent they can be used to investigate mobility within 
the Roman Empire. This chapter introduces lead and the premise behind the use of lead 
isotope analysis to investigate the geographical origins of people from archaeological 
skeletal populations. 
2.2 Geochemistry 
2.2.1 Lead 
Lead is a dense, yet soft, ductile metal with a low melting point (327C) and high 
resistance to corrosion. Because of these properties it has been utilised in the 
manufacture of a wide range of products for millennia (Settle and Patterson, 1980; 
Sherwood Lollar, 2005, p. 71). It is classified as a post-transitional heavy metal with 
chalcophile tendencies, meaning that it has a higher affinity for sulphur than oxygen and 
therefore forms dense sulphides that remain predominantly within the upper levels of 
the Earths crust. Naturally occurring sources of lead are most commonly found in 
minerals such as galena (PbS), anglesite (PbSO4), Cerussite (PbCO3) and minium 
(Pb3O4). However, trace amounts also occur in numerous other minerals such as K-
feldspar, zircon, micas and magnetite. Due to the intermediate size of Pb2+ ions (1.19 ) 
it can readily replace Ca2+ (1.14 ) and K+ (1.52 ) ions in several minerals, which is 
why lead is enriched in felsic rocks such as granite (Mielke, 1979). The distribution of 
lead within sedimentary rocks is governed by the lead content of the detrital minerals 
and organic matter present at the time of its formation (Heinrichs et al., 1980). Due to 
leads affinity for organic material, sedimentary rocks such as shale and greywackes 
contain the highest concentrations of the metal. As soils are a major contributor to 
human lead burdens details such as these are important because soil lead composition 
and concentrations are largely dependent upon the lead within the underlying rocks that 
formed it.  
Lead ions within soils are relatively immobile as they readily form secondary minerals 
with low solubility or ion complexes with manganese or iron. However, soils with low 
calcium concentrations or high pH values exhibit increased lead solubility that 
facilitates the aqueous movement of lead in the environment (Hem, 1976; Martnez and 
Motto, 2000; Zimdahl and Skogerboe, 1977). Natural levels of lead within soil have 
been estimated to be no more than 25 mg/kg-1 unless anthropogenic contributions have 
polluted it (Kabata-Pendias, 2010, pp. 338349). As mentioned above, anthropogenic 
activities such as metalliferous mining and the manufacture and use of lead or lead 
containing products (e.g. pipes, paints, glazes, petrol etc.) causes a significant increase 
in environmental lead concentrations (Patterson, 1965). These increased lead 
concentrations are deleterious to health as lead is highly toxic to all living organisms.  
2.2.2 Lead isotopes 
There are four naturally occurring lead isotopes, three of which are radiogenic daughters 
of thorium and uranium decay (206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb), and one primeval non-radiogenic 
isotope (204Pb). 204Pb is considered a stable reference isotope, the abundance (1.4%) of 
which has remained constant since the formation of Earth. 
238U     8      206Pb   (t1/2 = 4.467x10
9) [abundance 24.1%] 
235U      7      207Pb   (t1/2 = 0.704x10
9) [abundance 22.1%] 
232Th      6      208Pb   (t1/2 = 14.010x10
9) [abundance 52.4%] 
(Baskaran, 2011; McSween et al., 2003) 
There is extensive natural variation in the isotopic composition of lead in geological 
bodies, ranging from highly radiogenic lead in old uranium/thorium rich minerals such 
as granite, to minerals low in uranium/thorium lead but high in common lead such as K-
feldspar. These differences in isotopic composition reflect the different chemical 
environments in which the lead originated (e.g. crustal rock, mantle rock, ore bodies 
etc.). Additionally, the mixing of one or more lead sources with disparate compositions 
may further modify the isotopic composition of any given sample. This complex 
aggregation of multiple lead sources results in divergent isotope compositions that are 
specific to their geological environment, making them useful provenance tools (Evans 
et al., 2015; Faure, 1986). As different geological regions across the world are 
composed of varying types of rocks of different ages, each geographical region 
produces lead isotope ratios uniquely characteristic of its underlying geology.  
Lead isotopes are determined as ratios of one isotope to another rather than a direct 
measurement of abundance (e.g. 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb etc.). Conventional plots used 
to present lead data include 207Pb or 208Pb as ratios with the invariant 204Pb plotted 
against 206Pb/204Pb.  A bivariate plot using 207Pb/204Pb against 206Pb/204Pb allows 
visualisation of any changes in the uranium-lead systematics of the samples as it only 
compares the isotope ratios of uranium derived lead (uranogenic lead). When 
208Pb/204Pb is plotted against 206Pb/204Pb, any changes in both thorium-lead (thorogenic) 
and uranogenic lead processes can be visualised. However, due to its naturally low 
abundance (~1.4%) accurate measurement of 204Pb has, until recently, been problematic 
(Baskaran, 2011). To avoid the higher uncertainties surrounding 204Pb measurements 
208Pb/206Pb against 207Pb/208Pb plots are often used. These plots benefit from higher 
precision, but compress the data fields. Therefore, the subtler variations that frequently 
differentiate one lead field from another may, unlike in conventional bivariate plots 
using 204Pb, be lost. 
2.3 Lead in the environment 
2.3.1 Geographical variation of lead isotopes 
Geogenic lead isotope ratios within soils tend to be a homogenous representation of the 
isotopic composition of the underlying local geology. Therefore, any geographical 
variations within geogenic lead isotope ratios stem from the mixing of lead sources with 
disparate isotope compositions. These can either be from inter-ore spatial variations or 
preferential weathering and mechanical degradation of heterogeneous rocks (Erel et al., 
1994, p. 5565; Giacalone et al., 2005). Lead within soils is largely immobile, staying 
predominantly within the organic fraction due to its affinity for forming complex 
sulphide species (Adriano, 1986; Giacalone et al., 2005; Sheppard and Thibault, 1992). 
As such, anthropogenic lead contributions to soil composition also stay within the 
organic fraction, altering the isotopic composition of the upper soil fractions to reflect 
that of the dominant pollutant source rather than local geology. Lead isotope ratios do, 
however, gradually conform to those exhibited by the underlying geology as they 
approach the bedrock (Bacon et al., 1996, p. 2516).  
As with most geochemical processes, the mobility of lead within the organic fraction 
can be increased when subject to decreases in soil pH or environments rich in soluble 
organic matter (Giacalone et al., 2005; MacKenzie et al., 1998; Stewart and Fergusson, 
1994). Although metallurgical activities such as mining increases the lead concentration 
of soil, its low solubility ensures that it is not a major contributor to human lead burdens 
(Cotter-Howells and Thornton, 1991). It is the use of lead artefacts and lead compounds 
rather than lead in soils that dominates human lead burdens in metallurgical societies, as 
the direct ingestion of lead and its products circumvents normal biopurification of the 
toxic metal (Elias et al., 1982; Katzenberg and Grauer, 2018, p. 508). Therefore, it is the 
isotope ratios of potential sources of anthropogenic lead pollution (e.g. lead ores) that 
will provide the most useful comparisons for human migration studies involving 
societies with metallurgical capabilities, such as the Romans (McBride et al., 2014; 
Weiss et al., 1999; Wuana and Okieimen, 2011). 
It has been shown that lead ore isotope ratios vary throughout the world as they were 
formed at different geological times (McCrady, 1952; Sangster et al., 2000). Data such 
as that published by Sangster et al., (2000), demonstrate how the worlds most 
important lead ore deposits exhibit varying 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios, ranging from 0.98 
to 1.41. For example, one of the worlds major producers of lead is the Broken Hill ore 
deposit in Australia which has characteristically low 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio of 1.04, 
starkly contrasts with the worlds largest lead ore deposit, the Mississippi Valley Type 
deposit in North America which is younger than the Broken Hill deposit and has a 
higher 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratio of 1.40. Yet, despite the multidisciplinary applications 
of lead isotope analysis for source tracing in both modern and archaeological contexts, 
large-scale isoscapes representing the distribution of lead and lead isotope ratios are 
scarce.  
2.3.2 Lead isoscapes 
A European study conducted by Reimann et al. (2012), was one of the first to address 
the need for lead isoscapes on a continental scale. Their analysis of European lead 
concentrations in agricultural soils revealed a distinct boundary in concentration levels 
between North East and South West Europe; with Northern Europe exhibiting lower 
lead concentrations than Southern Europe (see Fig. 2.1). This boundary coincides with 
one of Europes major tectonic borders (the Trans-European Suture Zone) and extends 
from the agricultural (A-horizon) soils down into the deep C-horizon soils. These 
regions of high lead concentrations, especially in Britain, appear to correlate with major 
lead mining zones and industrial areas. This North/South divide in lead concentrations 
is also echoed in the 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios presented in Reimann et al.s (2012) 
study.

The spatial distribution of 206Pb/207Pb and 207Pb/208Pb isotope ratios can be seen in 
Figures 2.2a and 2.2b respectively. Generally, Northern and Eastern European soils 
(Sweden, Finland Ukraine etc.), predominantly developed on Precambrian igneous 
rocks have low 207Pb/208Pb and high 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios, while the inverse is seen 
in South Western Europe. There are, however a few localised exceptions with high 
207Pb/208Pb values that correlate with significant lead deposits in the area (Reimann et 
al., 2012). A common geological feature, the Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ), 
dominates all three maps. This region represents the geological border between the old 
Precambrian craton in the North-East of Europe and the younger Palaeozoic platform in 
Western Europe (McCann, 2008, p. 358). The fact that geological and isotope systems 
share a common border of change stands to further highlight the intrinsic relationship 
between a regions lead concentrations and geogenic lead isotope ratios with the 
underlying geology and prevailing soils. However, these isoscapes are modelled using 
modern agricultural soil samples. While this type of data is clearly a valid and useful 
tool for the tracing of modern human origins in continental-wide, forensic contexts 
(Boyd, Jr. and Boyd, 2017; Kamenov et al., 2014; Kamenov and Curtis, 2017; Keller et 
al., 2016), both modern and historical anthropogenic lead pollution has resulted in their 
efficacy for tracing mobility in archaeological populations being questioned.  
Studies have shown that environmental lead isotope ratios are significantly altered by 
anthropogenic contributions to the atmospheric deposition of lead (Farmer et al., 2002, 
1999, 1997). Through the analysis of historical peat bogs, lake sediments and archival 
herbage, spatiotemporal changes in 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios have been identified, and 
these changes have been linked to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels 
and the introduction of leaded petrol (Boutron et al., 1994; Mil-Homens et al., 2013; 
Renberg et al., 2000; Shotyk et al., 1996). Therefore, if lead isotope ratios in organic 
materials are to be used as indicators of geographical location there is a real need to 
ensure that the samples are contemporaneous with those of the skeletal population being 
analysed. Keller et al., (2016) is one of the first studies to explore this with their 
production and application of spatiotemporal lead isoscapes using 19th and 20th century 
North American samples. This study found that lead isotope ratios from a combination 
of dated sediment, peat bog, coral, tree ring and lichen samples provided isotope ratios 
sufficiently similar to those in contemporaneous human remains for the purpose of 
origin identification. Keller et al., (2016) conclude that spatiotemporal isoscapes 
correlate more closely to human tooth enamel values than isoscapes produced using 
non-contemporaneous soil samples. Despite the apparent success of this study, very few 
others have attempted to make spatiotemporally specific lead isoscapes. Instead, it has 
remained more common practice to use lead isotope datasets produced from the analysis 
of artefacts of known provenance as proxies for the palaeo-pollution that would have 
contributed to anthropogenic archaeological human lead isotope ratios.  
2.3.3 Anthropogenic environmental lead pollution  
Human activities have always had an impact upon the environment, and the mining and 
smelting of lead is no exception. Before the advent of metallurgical activities 
atmospheric lead levels remained consistently low (Bindler et al., 2008). However, 
palaeo-pollution studies have shown how human activities have caused significant 
fluctuations in these natural background concentrations (Brnvall et al., 2001). 
Numerous studies have used Icelandic salt marshes, Greenland ice cores, Scandinavian 
lake sediments, European peat bogs and historical herbage to characterise palaeo-
pollution over time (Brnnvall et al., 1997; Hong et al., 1994; Komrek et al., 2008; 
Marshall et al., 2009; Rosman et al., 1997). These studies show a low natural baseline 
level of atmospheric lead concentration in pre-history that steadily rises during the onset 
of metallurgical technologies around 500 BC. During the Roman period these levels 
dramatically rise, yet after the decline of the Roman Empire, during the 5th  11th 
centuries AD, palaeo-pollution records demonstrate a drop in atmospheric lead levels. 
However, a second surge in lead production during the industrial revolution in the 18th 
century induced a second increase in atmospheric lead concentrations, bringing about 
unprecedentedly high lead levels within the environmental record.  Interestingly, the 
same temporal fluctuations in atmospheric lead pollution can be seen in the lead 
burdens of archaeological human remains.  
This is best visualised by comparing the archaeological human data presented by 
Montgomery et al., (2010) with the atmospheric pollution data published by Settle and 
Patterson (1980) (see Fig. 2.3 and 2.4 respectively). Montgomery et al.s (2010) data 
demonstrates how the median lead concentrations in human tooth enamel from British 
skeletal populations spanning from the Neolithic to the Late Medieval period have 
concentration fluctuations congruent with the fluctuations seen in historic lead 
production. As metallurgical activities increased, so did the lead concentrations in 
human tooth enamel. From as early as the Iron Age, tooth enamel has shown elevated 
lead concentrations (0.02  30.1 mg kg-1) compared to those seen in pre-historic 
samples (0.003  0.68 mg kg-1). This correlation between anthropogenic lead production 
and human lead burden illustrates how anthropogenic lead pollution is linked to human 
lead burdens, thus, providing a unique tool for assessing how technological 
advancements affected the health and environments of past populations.

2.4 Uses in bioarchaeology 
The use of lead isotope analysis in archaeology has primarily been developed as a 
discriminatory tool in artefact provenance studies, addressing questions about trade, 
movement of goods and the geological and geographical origins of manufacturing 
materials (Boni et al., 2000; Durali-Mueller et al., 2007; Henderson et al., 2005; Renson 
et al., 2013; Stos-Gale et al., 1997). Its development was founded on the premise that 
different lead ore sources have isotopic compositions sufficiently different from one 
another to allow differentiation between ores mined in different countries (Brill and 
Wampler, 1967). Comparison of lead isotope ratios from archaeological artefacts with 
the isotopic signature from ore deposits has been shown to successfully facilitate the 
identification of possible geographic origins of the metals used to make the artefacts 
(Albarde et al., 2012; Balliana et al., 2013; Delile et al., 2014; Desaulty et al., 2011; 
Niederschlag et al., 2003).  The use of lead isotope analysis in bioarchaeology is based 
upon a similar assumption, mainly that the lead sequestered in skeletal material reflects 
the lead source a person was exposed to at the time of tissue mineralisation. Although 
this technique is not as widely used as other isotope systems in bioarchaeology, mostly 
due to cost and complexity of interpretation, a growing number of studies are 
demonstrating the efficacy of the technique in identifying migrants, especially in British 
and North American populations (Duds et al., 2016; Keller et al., 2016; Millard et al., 
2014; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016).  
2.4.1 Lead in skeletal tissues 
The weathering and dissolution of rocks facilitates the movement of lead into the 
surrounding soils. From here it can enter the food chain via incorporation into local 
water systems, plants and animals. With regards to humans, this means that the lead 
sequestered within skeletal material represents an average of the isotopic composition of 
the food and water ingested during life (see Chapter 4 for more details). Due to their 
high mass, lead isotopes do not fractionate during the low temperature reactions 
associated with geological and biological processes, therefore lead isotope ratios in 
skeletal tissues tend to reflect those of the local geology or at least an integrated 
homogenous representation of the underlying geology (Erel et al., 1994; Komrek et al., 
2008). This is particularly true for people from pre-metallurgical societies where lead 
burdens are consistently low (<1 ppm), and acquired almost entirely from naturally 
occurring, geogenic lead in the environment (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 
2010; Shaw et al., 2016). Subsequent societies exhibit increased lead burdens as a result 
of widespread environmental lead pollution created through the use of mining and 
metallurgical technologies. This anthropogenic lead pollution swamps the natural 
geogenic lead in an individuals local environment, resulting in lead isotope ratios 
reflecting those of the lead ore sources utilised by that particular society (Montgomery, 
2002; Montgomery et al., 2010, 2014). Of course, in reality a society is likely to be 
exposed to more than one ore source, in which case human lead isotope ratios would 
reflect an average of the isotope ratios from all sources, essentially a mixed or 
homogenised isotope ratio. These homogenised isotope ratios are likely to show slight 
variations between individuals within a single population, but the variation will 
inevitably be smaller than the variation between the different ore sources (end 
members) contributing to the exposure (Wilson and Pollard, 2001). No matter what type 
of exposure (natural or polluted) the strong environmental links for both geogenic and 
anthropogenic lead burdens enables the interpretation of lead isotope ratios in 
conjunction with lead concentration data to be a powerful tool in human mobility 
studies. 
2.4.2 Variations in human lead isotope ratios 
Human teeth and bones accumulate trace amounts of lead from the local environment as 
they grow and remodel. As lead isotopes do not fractionate as they move through the 
biogeosphere, the incorporation of these potentially geologically unique lead isotope 
compositions into mineral matrices provide isotopic compositions that are indicative of 
the geographical region resided in at the time of incorporation. Numerous studies have 
found that well preserved skeletal remains, especially teeth, are excellent archives for 
biogenic lead and have proven that lead isotope analysis of skeletal remains can be a 
useful tracer for sources of lead to which a population was exposed (Budd et al., 2004; 
Gulson et al., 1997; Kowal et al., 1991; Molleson et al., 1986; Montgomery et al., 2010, 
2005). 
The potential for using lead isotope ratios to discriminate between different cultural 
groups is demonstrated in Figure 2.5. Here, previously published lead isotope ratios 
from archaeological human samples are grouped by continent. It is evident that although 
each continent contains values that overlap with each other, the data points cluster in 
four distinct groups based on geographic location. The European samples show the 
tightest grouping, which is most likely due to the cultural focusing induced by the 
extensive mining, diverse use and reuse of lead throughout the Roman Empire and to 
some extent the Medieval period. These European values cluster around 206Pb/204Pb = 
18.44, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.61 and 208Pb/204Pb = 38.40 which are congruent with the lead 
isotope ratios found in British lead ores. The samples from North America and South 
America plot much higher than the European samples, especially those from North 
America which exhibit the highest lead isotope ratios with averages of 206Pb/204Pb = 
19.3, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.70 and 208Pb/204Pb = 39.20, thereby making them easily 
distinguishable from the European, South American and Asian samples.  
Although some of the South American samples overlap with the European field, the 
majority of the South American isotope ratios are higher than those from Europe and 
plot above 206Pb/204Pb = 18.60. The samples from Asia show the greatest degree of 
overlap with the other continents. However, when all of the lead isotope ratios are 
considered, the Asian samples can be distinguished on the basis of their 208Pb/204Pb 
isotope ratios. The average 208Pb/204Pb isotope ratio for the Asian sample was 38.48, 
which is higher than the average for the European and South American samples (38.40 
and 38.38 respectively) but considerably lower than the North American average of 
39.20. This highlights the importance of analysing all four lead isotopes when using 
lead as a source-tracer in mobility studies, as it is not always a single value that proves 
to be sufficiently discriminant but rather a combination of the isotope ratio possibilities. 
From this it is evident that the lead isotope ratios incorporated into archaeological 
human teeth and to a lesser extent bones (see section 2.4.4), can reflect the local 
environment of the individual and can be a useful discriminant in mobility studies. 
While it is clear that archaeological individuals from different regions of the world are 
relatively easily distinguishable from one-another, especially North Americans from 
Europeans, there is still a lack of comparable data for countries within the same 
continent. Therefore, the resolution at which mobility can be identified via lead isotope 
analysis has yet to be determined. 
Figure 2.5  Continental variation in lead isotope ratios from archaeological 
human remains (Source: Author). Data published by Europe:(berg et al., 1998; 
Budd et al., 2004, 2000; Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2005; Montgomery et 
al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). South America: ( Turner et al., 2009). North America: 
(Bower et al., 2007). Asia: (Valentine et al., 2008). 
It is also important to consider lead concentrations in conjunction with lead isotope 
ratios as they can often inform the interpretation of results. Low lead concentrations are 
usually accompanied by variable lead isotope ratios, which represent the natural lead 
acquired through diet and therefore reflects geographical origins. This trend is typical of 
prehistoric populations before the advent of metallurgical technologies (Montgomery et 
al., 2010). Therefore, source-tracing applications of prehistoric human remains can 
utilise lead isotope ratios in the same way as strontium isotopes to ascertain geological 
origins. However, anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting have resulted in 
widespread lead pollution that has altered the natural lead isotope background of the 
environment, and this change in both isotope ratio and concentration is reflected in 
historical teeth (Kamenov and Gulson, 2014). Thus, samples with high lead 
concentrations consistently exhibit narrow lead isotope ranges centred round the isotope 
ratios of the dominant lead ore source utilised by the population. High lead 
concentrations are predominantly found in societies with the technology to exploit 
mineral ore sources (Carlson, 1996; Montgomery et al., 2005). As a result, lead isotope 
ratios in metallurgical societies become less affiliated with natural baseline levels 
characteristic of geological origin and more indicative of exposure to pollutants (i.e. 
access to lead and its products). This clustering of lead isotope ratios as a result of 
anthropogenic lead exposure has been termed cultural focusing (Montgomery, 2002). 
2.4.3 Cultural focusing 
The term cultural focusing refers to the homogenisation of lead isotope ratios within 
an archaeological population, and usually occurs in conjunction with elevated lead 
concentrations (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2005). As 
these homogenised isotope ratios tend to have ranges congruent with those from local 
lead ore bodies, elevated lead concentrations and their resultant homogenised isotope 
ratios are thought to be induced by anthropogenic environmental lead pollution. This 
cultural focusing alters the type of information that can be obtained from lead isotope 
analysis of skeletal remains. Shifting the lead isotope ratios in skeletal remains away 
from isotope ratios congruent with geographical provenance, towards isotope ratios 
much more indicative of a socio-cultural provenance (Carlson, 1996; Montgomery et al., 
2005). This means that the metallurgically induced influx of anthropogenic lead into the 
environment effectively severs the link between skeletal lead isotope ratios and 
geographic origin and replaces it with isotope ratios converging around the predominant 
ore sources utilised in a particular cultural sphere.  
Despite the fact that cultural focusing potentially reduces the resolution of geographic 
variability of lead isotopes, these homogenised anthropogenic skeletal lead isotope 
ratios can still be effective in differentiating between cultural groups within skeletal 
populations. They are still capable of discriminating between individuals exposed to 
different sources of lead. Therefore, while the identification of movement within a 
specific country may not be possible, individuals exposed to foreign lead sources should 
stand out from those exposed to local lead, making migrants from other countries 
relatively easily identifiable in culturally mixed skeletal populations. The data published 
by Montgomery et al., (2010), and presented in Figure 2.6 best demonstrates this. As 
can be seen, when lead concentrations remain below 0.5 mg kg-1 a divergent spread of 
lead isotope ratios is exhibited. However, when lead concentrations rise above this 
divergent threshold (dotted line on the graph) isotope ratio begin to cluster around a 
narrow range, in this case 207Pb/206Pb isotope ratios of 0.845 to 0.849, which is in line 
with British lead ore isotope signatures. The outlier in this dataset (Spitalfields 4th 
century AD) exhibits a high lead concentration with isotope ratios inconsistent with 
British lead ore, suggesting that this individual had access to foreign sources of 
anthropogenic lead during childhood and therefore originates from somewhere outside 
of Britain. In fact, after comparison with the lead and strontium isotope ratios of three 
individuals from Rome, Montgomery et al. (2010) conclude that the Spitalfields outlier 
has isotope ratios consistent with a childhood origins in the Mediterranean.  
Figure 2.6  Data from archaeological human remains demonstrating cultural 
focusing of isotope ratios wit increased lead concentrations (Source: Montgomery 
et al., 2010) 
A more recent study by Millard et al., (2014) also found that increased lead 
concentrations resulted in a decreased spread of lead isotope ratios. Examining British 
post-medieval populations from London, Millard et al., (2014) found that the majority 
of individuals with high lead concentrations clustered within the expected lead isotope 
fields for British lead ores. However, this study determined the point at which human 
lead isotope ratios become dominated by anthropogenic contributions (culturally 
focused) to be 0.87 ppm, slightly higher than that suggested in the initial study by 
Montgomery et al., (2010). As yet, the current literature offers no explanations as to 
why different populations have different thresholds for the onset of cultural focused 
lead isotope ratios. Although, as environmental lead concentrations have shown to vary 
geographically (Reimann et al., 2012), it may simply be that the threshold for cultural 
focusing is also population/geographically specific.

2.4.4 Contamination from the burial environment 
As with all chemical analyses involving archaeological remains, the question of 
contamination from the burial environment is a major concern, especially in migration 
studies. The success of isotope analysis as a means of reconstructing residency and 
migration hinges upon the assumption that the analytically targeted elements represent 
those incorporated during life, not those acquired after death (Montgomery et al., 2000). 
The majority of archaeological remains are buried and therefore contact with possible 
contaminants is largely unavoidable. However, the extent to which diagenetic 
alterations impact upon chemical analyses can be controlled for by careful consideration 
of the sample material.  
Certain intrinsic features of bone, such as porosity, density and surface area render bone 
highly reactive with its surroundings, readily exchanging mineral and organic elements 
with its burial environment (Hedges et al., 1995; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges, 2000). 
Tooth enamel on the other hand is almost completely composed of mineral, effectively 
fossilised before burial. Therefore, enamel is far more kinetically stable than bone or 
dentine. Its dense structure and low porosity leaves limited opportunities for mineral 
infiltration and ion exchange between the enamel and its burial environment 
(Montgomery et al., 2000; Neuman and Neuman, 1953). Therefore, enamel is 
considered relatively stable and resistant to the diagenetic structural and chemical 
changes common in other skeletal tissues (Budd et al., 2000; Hoppe et al., 2003; 
Montgomery et al., 2007). As such, tooth enamel offers the best sample medium for 
chemical analyses as it greatly reduces the risk of post-mortem contamination, giving 
the highest likelihood of obtaining in vivo isotope ratios incorporated into the tissues 
(Ericson, 1993; Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). 
2.4.5 Lead concentrations 
Lead concentrations in tooth enamel provide a measure of childhood exposure to 
environmental lead pollution, and can offer information beyond simply the extent of an 
individuals lead burden. As briefly discussed in section 2.4.3, when combined with 
lead isotope ratios, lead concentration analysis can facilitate differentiation between 
geogenic and anthropogenic lead exposure. Being able to distinguish between geogenic 
and anthropogenic lead exposure in this way offers insights into the technological 
capabilities and/or technologies actively utilised by a particular population. It is likely 
that populations exhibiting predominantly geogenic lead isotope ratios do not use lead 
or lead products to the extent necessary for the acquisition of high, anthropogenic lead 
concentrations. This is touched upon in the works by Montgomery et al. (2010), who 
demonstrated that prehistoric populations with limited metallurgical technologies have 
the lowest mean lead concentrations while retaining their divergent geogenic lead 
isotope ratios. Yet with the introduction of large-scale lead use, human lead 
concentrations increase, producing anthropogenic lead isotope ratios in technologically 
advanced societies. While little work has been done to thoroughly explore the extent to 
which this rule of thumb holds true, to date studies utilising lead isotopes have shown 
that human lead burdens below 1 ppm in conjunction with non-ore lead isotope ratios 
appear to represent geogenic lead exposure and values over this are considered 
anthropogenic (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016).  
Within polluted populations lead concentrations can also offer a means of 
differentiating between broad settlement types, such as rural or urban environments. 
The premise behind this is that rural environments are generally less polluted than urban 
environments, therefore individuals from rural settlements are likely to have had lower 
lead exposure and as a result, lower lead burdens than their urban counterparts (Lepow 
et al., 1975). Bioarchaeological investigations exploring how lead exposure differed 
between rural and urban environments are scarce. However, studies that have assessed 
lead concentrations between different environments have found that people from urban 
environments tended to have higher lead conceetrations than people who lived in rural 
environments (Drasch, 1982; Millard et al., 2014). The same trend has been seen in 
Roman and pre-Roman societies, with individuals from Roman societies having higer 
lead concentrations than individuals from pre-Roman societies (Montgomery, 2002; 
Montgomey et al., 2010; Beherec et al., 2015). 
The toxic nature of lead also means that lead concentration analysis can be used to 
explore the effects of lead exposure on the health of people from past populations. 
However, because tooth enamel is the only skeletal material to provide reliable in vivo 
lead concentrations, research focused on lead poisoning is limited to studies on 
childhood health. As teeth mineralise during childhood, the lead concentrations 
obtained from tooth enamel pertain to that period in life. Therefore, to accurately assess 
how these concentrations impacted upon health they can only be used in conjunction 
with palaeopathological alterations on non-adult skeletal material as both datasets are 
most likely to overlap with the time of lead exposure.  
2.5 Summary 
Natural geographic variations in lead isotope ratios make them an ideal tool for 
investigating the geographic origins of people in the past. The availability of three 
isotope ratios rather than the single isotope ratio available in other commonly used 
isotope systems (e.g. strontium), allows greater scope for differentiation in migration 
studies. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for lead isotope ratios in 
bioarchaeological research and highlighted the need for contemporary comparative data 
for source identification. The paltry amount of published lead isotope data from 
archaeological human remains not only from the Roman period but from all time 
periods is a major limiting factor in the use of lead isotopes in human migration studies. 
Without datasets from archaeological populations from different countries there is no 
way to directly compare isotope ratios with human baselines in other countries. This 
forces the use of proxies such as artefacts or lead ores in their stead. While these have 
shown to be useful in the identification of approximate geographical origins of 
individuals with isotope ratios that do not conform to the expected isotope ratios of their 
interment region, their accuracy should be questioned, as the method does not account 
for the mixing of numerous lead sources. This is an inevitable component of human lead 
isotope ratios, especially in populations that exploited the use of the metal in all aspects 
of daily life. Therefore, human lead isotope ratios are not likely to reflect the isotope 
ratios of a single source such as local lead ore or artefacts of known provenance.  Thus, 
the first steps in advancing the efficacy of lead isotope ratios in Roman migration 
studies would be the compilation of human lead isotope ratio datasets for various 
regions of the Roman Empire. This is an objective that this study will contribute to by 
analysing the lead isotope ratios in Roman skeletal remains from four countries from 
different regions of the Roman Empire. 
CHAPTER THREE 
Isotope Analysis of Roman Populations 
3.1 Introduction  
In order to explore how environmental lead pollution impacted upon the health of past 
populations, as well as how anthropogenically induced changes to environmental 
isotopic ratios influence how these ratios can be used in mobility research the study 
population is required to fulfil two criteria. Firstly, the population must have engaged in 
metallurgical activities to elicit such a change in their environment, or have inhabited a 
previously polluted environment. Secondly, the population would ideally have been 
prone to migratory events as to allow for any potential differences between the isotopic 
composition of an individuals tooth enamel, which would reflect their former place of 
residence and the isotopic composition of the region in which they died. 
This chapter discusses migration in the Roman Empire, highlighting the extent of 
movement underway during this time, and touching upon the motivations for such 
large-scale mobility. The ubiquitous use of lead during the Roman period will also be 
explored, with focus on how lead was used and how this may have impacted upon 
health. In doing so this chapter sets out to demonstrate how the Romans, who were 
somewhat characterised by their proclivity for widespread migration and large-scale 
lead mining throughout the Empire, provide the perfect target population for this study. 
3.2 People on the move 
The Roman Empire was a vast suzerainty with large territorial holdings in Europe, 
Western-Asia and Northern-Africa, a contiguous expanse encompassing the entire 
Mediterranean Sea (Garnsey and Saller, 2014). It was one of the largest empires in 
history, spanning approximately 5 million km2 (Taagepera, 1979), the limits of which 
are summarised rather poetically by historian Christopher Kelly: 
The Empire stretched from Hadrians Wall in drizzle-soaked northern 
England to the sun-baked banks of the Euphrates in Syria; from the 
great Rhine-Danube river system, which snaked across the fertile, flat 
lands of Europe from the low country to the Black Sea, to the rich 
plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the Nile 
Valley in Egypt. The Empire completely circled the Mediterranean. 
(Kelly, 2006, p. 1)  
The Roman Empire was renowned for the widespread movement of people both within 
and between the varied geographic and cultural spheres it controlled (Killgrove, 2010). 
The movement of people both voluntary and forced via migration, military invasions, 
slavery or trade was a defining characteristic of the Roman Empire (Braudel, 1995; 
Horden and Purcell, 2000; Scheidel, 2004) and integral to its development and 
expansion (Birley, 1979; Hin, 2013; Scheidel, 2001a).  
The relatively peaceful period during the period of the Roman Empire known as the Pax 
Romana, facilitated the movement of people across large expanses of the Empire with 
comparative ease (Moatti, 2006). People with the financial means to move could do so 
freely as a result of the contiguous geopolitical expanse and the well-established road 
and seafaring infrastructures the Empire provided (Killgrove, 2010, p. 27). 
Documentary evidence demonstrates that slaves, soldiers and civilians were migrating 
from all regions of the Empire, with examples of migrants from France, Germany, 
Hungary, Spain, Syria and Egypt among others, commemorated on funerary 
monuments within Rome (Noy, 2000; Stark, 2017).  It was not only those with the 
financial means to travel who moved freely throughout the Empire, migration is known 
to have been a part of all social strata with people of lower social status also migrating 
in search of better lives, (Sweetman, 2011; Tacoma, 2016, 2014; Woolf, 2013). The 
movement of people within this culturally, ethnically and geographically diverse 
population has been broadly separated into two categories, voluntary migration (e.g. 
free citizens) and compulsory/forced migration (e.g. military service or slavery).  
3.2.1 Voluntary migration 
Voluntary migration refers to people who have made a conscious decision to move, 
either short distances within their home province or long distances to a different region 
of the Empire. Although most likely biased towards wealthy, literate individuals from 
higher social classes, epigraphical evidence suggests that motivations for voluntary 
migration were overwhelmingly driven by either push or pull factors (Noy, 2000). Push 
factors relate to the region of origin and usually compel people to leave their homes in 
search of a better life in a different region of the Empire, a problem pushing them to 
move. Pull factors on the other hand are factors connected to the destination, something 
that entices an individual to make it their new home; a benefit pulling them to move 
(Killgrove, 2010; Noy, 2000; Stark, 2017). The motivations behind voluntary migration 
during the Roman period are poorly recorded, but it is unlikely that the decision to 
move was made on account of a singular reason. Undoubtedly a multitude of reasons 
played a part in compelling a person or family to uproot their lives and start afresh in a 
new region of the Empire of their own volition (Noy, 2000). 
3.2.2 Compulsory migration 
Compulsory migration refers to people who were forced to move, with no choice as to 
when or where they were sent. It is widely accepted that compulsory migration 
accounted for a large proportion of the movement of people within the Roman Empire, 
with members of the Roman army, slaves and their families relocated involuntarily 
through expulsion from their conquered homeland, enslavement or military deployment 
(Jongman, 2003; Scheidel, 2005; Tacoma, 2014). Slaves were integral to both the social 
and economic structure of the Empire, performing a diverse range of jobs encompassing 
everything from domestic services to highly skilled professions such as accountant or 
physician (Bradley, 1994, p. 2; Scheidel, 2010a). It has been estimated that from 50 BC 
to AD 150 the Roman Empire required over 500,000 new slaves every year (Bradley, 
1994, p. 32). The sheer volume of slaves existing within its provinces has led to the 
Empire being termed a slave society or slave economy (Scheidel, 2010a). As Roman 
slaves were often captives of war they represent a population with vastly diverse origins. 
Historical evidence at Rome for example documents that the Parthian war supplied 
approximately 100,000 slaves to Rome from Iran, while the Punic wars provided the 
Empires capital with upwards of 75,000 slaves from North Africa (Bradley, 1994, pp. 
3340). Not all slaves were captive prisoners of war, slaves were also acquired through 
piracy in the Mediterranean or traded or bought from other slave societies such as Sub-
Saharan Africa or Egypt (Bradley, 1994, pp. 3339). Infants were also often enslaved, 
either by being born to a slave mother (verna) in which case the infant belonged to the 
mothers master, or infants turned out through exposure could be taken and raised in a 
life of slavery. However, the number of slaves acquired through exposure diminished 
during the 4th century AD after the sale of infants was authorised by Constantine (Harris, 
1994).  
Soldiers and their families also make up a large proportion of people considered as 
compulsory migrants. Recruitment of Roman military forces occasionally occurred en 
masse from a particular region of the Empire where soldiers would find themselves 
serving with people of a similar cultural background (Haynes, 1999). However, a 
multitude of conscripts and volunteers were often taken from the nearest convenient 
source, both within and beyond the Empires frontiers (James, 1999). As such, the ranks 
of the Roman army were rarely culturally homogenous. Evidence for the cosmopolitan 
nature of the Roman army is demonstrated on various military monuments such as the 
Tropaeum Traiani in Civitas Tropaensium, Dacia (Adamclisi, Romania) and the Birrens 
altars in Scotland, which attest to the diverse ethnic groups within individual regiments 
(Haynes, 1999; RIB Online, 2014). The Roman army created large groups of highly 
mobile, multicultural people, and although military forces were largely concentrated at 
frontiers or regions of the Empire within which peace was not always guaranteed, they 
could be sent anywhere within the Empire at anytime (Noy, 2000). 
3.3 Finding the foreigners 
In the 1990s David Anthony (1990) pointed out the value of mobility studies in fully 
understanding the movement of people in the past and urged archaeologists to utilise all 
available sources of evidence (material culture, historical records, skeletal remains etc.) 
to reconstruct patterns of human mobility. In the decades that followed, much of the 
work on migration had been predominantly theoretical, focusing on the large-scale 
movements of people from either prehistoric or post-Roman periods (Anthony, 1990; 
Burmeister et al., 2000; Champion, 1990; Hrke, 1998). Advancements in 
bioarchaeological and biogeoarchaeological methods have facilitated a robust scientific 
approach that has rejuvenated interest in mobility studies (Bentley, 2006; Eckardt, 
2010). Through the analysis of the physical, chemical and molecular features of skeletal 
remains, archaeologists can now provide empirical evidence for migration rather than 
simply offering theoretical arguments for the movements of people in the past (van 
Dommelen, 2014).  
The analysis of the funerary practices (material culture, monuments, epitaphs, grave 
type, skeletal remains etc.) of archaeological civilisations is the most accessible way of 
assessing migration and mobility within past populations. Historical documents have 
recorded many migratory events in tomes such as Bedes Ecclesiastical History of the 
English People and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles (Colgrave and Mynors, 1993; Points, 
2013). These types of sources are often written decades if not centuries after the initial 
event and are therefore not always entirely accurate. As a result of this, current 
archaeological studies tend to focus more on where and how individuals were buried, 
piecing together biographical information gleaned from the evidence of funerary 
practices surviving in the archaeological record (Pearce, 2000). 
3.3.1 Burial rites 
Many archaeological studies on migration within the Roman world have attempted to 
differentiate between migrant new comers and the native population from a given site 
by interpreting changes in local burial practices as manifestations of Romanisation. 
However, such deductions from these so-called intrusive burial practices have been 
criticised for assuming a direct link between burial practice and individual ethnicity 
(Halsall, 2011, 2010; Willems, 1978). Burial rituals throughout the Roman Empire have 
been shown to vary spatially and temporally at both local and provincial levels (Pearce, 
2010, 2000). For example, during the early Roman period furnished cremations were 
the predominant rite in western provinces, while inhumation dominated in the east and 
as the Empire transitioned into the late Roman period the frequency in the deposition of 
grave goods decreased significantly (Pearce, 2010, 2000). While there is clearly value in 
considering this type of evidence when assessing human mobility in order to 
successfully characterise a burial as indicative of a migrant a secure understanding of 
the predominant preceding burial rite is crucial, and as the evidence for late Iron Age 
funerary practices is sporadic (e.g. plentiful in Moselle, yet scarce in Bavaria) current 
knowledge of the indigenous burial rites for much of the Empire is limited (Fasold, 
2000; Fitzpatrick, 2000).  
Additionally, recent diaspora studies have highlighted that an individuals culture is not 
static, rather it has an intrinsic fluidity, and can be altered by interactions with other 
cultures. This creolisation results in a blending of cultures creating societies with a 
new culture distinct from both the host population and their original homeland, where 
identities are formed around commonalities such as profession or status rather than 
ethnicity (Eckardt, 2010). Essentially, the diasporic nature of the Roman Empire has 
blurred the lines between what has traditionally been seen in the archaeological record 
as indicative of foreign in origin and what is actually an expression of a complex 
integrated identity. Therefore, areas of study that exploit more direct links between what 
survives in the archaeological record and an individuals geographic origin are coming 
to the forefront in mobility studies (Fitzhugh, et al., 2019).  
3.3.2 Isotope analyses 
For decades non-destructive methods of osteological analysis have been the standard 
way of identifying groups of affiliated individuals, working on the premise that 
populations displaying the most similarity are the most closely related (White and 
Folkens, 2005). However, with advancements in analytical techniques a new wave of 
bioarchaeological studies of migration are harnessing the discriminatory powers of 
stable and radiogenic isotope systems extracted from archaeological teeth and bones to 
answer questions about geographic origins at an individual and population level.  It has 
been well established that the isotopic composition of archaeological teeth and bone 
reflects the isotopic composition of the food and drink consumed at the time of new 
bone formation, which in turn reflect the region in which they were sourced 
(Katzenberg, 2008; Kohn, 1999; Richards et al., 2006; Van der Merwe and Vogel, 
1978). Therefore the isotopic characteristics of an individual represent a weighted 
average of the isotope compositions they have ingested from their local environment. 
Advancements in stable and radiogenic isotope analysis methods have exploited this 
concept and taken it beyond the reconstruction of palaeo-diets, significantly 
transforming the way in which mobility studies can establish patterns of migration in 
the past.  
To date, the isotopic systems of several elements, most notably carbon, nitrogen, 
oxygen, sulphur, strontium and lead, have been developed as possible indicators of 
movement in past populations (Lightfoot and OConnell, 2016; Montgomery et al., 
2010; Nehlich, 2015; Slovak and Paytan, 2012). Mobility studies using these isotope 
systems are reliant upon regionally distinct isotopic compositions that allow 
differentiations to be made between childhoods spent in local or foreign locations 
(Katzenberg, 2008). One of the major constraints of using isotope systems in mobility 
studies is no one region produces a unique signature. Often a number of geographical 
areas with similar geology and climate overlap in their isotopic characteristics, 
rendering the inference of geographical origins difficult. As such, isotope characteristics 
can be more suited to excluding regions of origin, rather than definitively assigning a 
specific geographical origin (Bruun, 2010; Knudson and Price, 2007; Prowse et al., 
2007). 
3.3.2.1 Stable light isotope systems 
Stable light isotope analysis of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) is a well-established 
technique for the reconstruction of palaeo-diets using archaeological teeth and bones. 
Within these two tissue types, collagen is the predominant protein present and provides 
a rich source of averaged 13C and 15N values. The composition of these 13C and 15N 
values reflect the isotopic composition of the foods consumed during the tissues 
formation (Kohn, 1999; Richards et al., 2006; Schoeninger et al., 1983; Van der Merwe 
and Vogel, 1978). This is due to the metabolism and reuse of dietary proteins acquired 
from the plant and animal products consumed during life in collagen synthesis. 
Therefore, once metabolic fractionation has been accounted for, these carbon and 
nitrogen isotope ratios can be used to garner insights into not only the types and 
quantities of food resources utilised by a population, but also the socioeconomic and 
cultural influences surrounding the dietary practices of groups as well as individuals 
(Dietler, 2007). 
The variations that arise in 13C values result from differences in ecosystems (marine vs. 
terrestrial) and the photosynthetic pathways (C3 and C4) used by plants in their 
manufacture of carbohydrates. As such, variations in carbon values allows 
differentiation between the relative contribution of C3 or C4 plants and the animal 
products based on these plants, to diet (Ambrose et al., 1997; Beaumont et al., 2013; 
Camin et al., 2008). In temperate regions, such as Britain, plants tend to use the C3 
pathway. Therefore, isotopic evidence of dietary proteins based on C4 plants (e.g. maize 
or millet) not native to Britain, would suggest a foreign influence on diet within a 
British population. Variability in nitrogen isotope values reflects the balance between 
biological nitrogen fixation, biosphere recycling and nitrogen release (Robinson, 2001). 
This variability facilitates the visualisation of terrestrial and marine food source input 
into diet as marine-based food sources tend to be more enriched in 15N than land based 
food sources (Liu and Kaplan, 1989). In addition to this, nitrogen levels also vary with 
trophic level, as a result of metabolic fractionation, creating a 26  enrichment with 
every trophic level shift (Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984). This shift is most noticeable 
in marine food consumers as aquatic food sources have high 15N values owing to the 
relatively long food chains compared to those observed in terrestrial food sources 
(Tykot, 2004). As such, combining the analysis of 13C and 15N values can facilitate 
the interpretation of plant, animal and marine protein contributions to palaeo-diets, 
allowing for distinctions to be made between broad categories of food groups, such as 
herbivore vs. carnivore or marine vs. terrestrial input and any potentially non-local 
influence on diet (Ambrose and Katzenberg, 2006), and published studies of Roman 
populations have demonstrated this (Chenery et al., 2011; Mldner et al., 2011; Pollard 
et al., 2011a) 
Oxygen incorporated into hydroxyapatite is predominantly derived from ingested fluids, 
the isotopic composition of which fluctuates due to climatic and environmental 
variables such as temperature, rainfall, altitude and latitude (Darling and Talbot, 2003). 
Therefore, oxygen isotopes (18O) measured in human tissues are an indirect reflection 
of the local meteoric water composition (Kohn, 1996). As with carbon and nitrogen, 
oxygen also undergoes metabolic fractionation once ingested. Therefore, regression 
formulae must be applied to allow comparison with modern drinking water values. 
These calculated 18Odw values reflect the composition of the local meteoric water 
(Kohn, 1996). Thus, analysis of 18O from tooth enamel can provide information 
pertaining to childhood origin and palaeo-climate ( Chenery et al., 2012; Fricke et al., 
1995). However, 18O values can be influenced by culturally mediated behaviour. If a 
significant proportion of the individuals drinking water was processed before ingestion 
(boiled, brewed etc.) a higher 18O value than expected for the geographical region in 
question would be obtained (Brettell et al., 2012).  One of the first studies to apply 
oxygen isotopes in human mobility studies was carried out on archaeological 
populations in Mexico (White et al., 1998). Following this, the use of oxygen isotope 
analysis became popular means of assessing geographic origins. It has been widely used 
in archaeological populations from all periods and diverse geographical locations (Budd 
et al., 2003; Buzon and Bowen, 2010; Dupras and Schwarcz, 2001a; Emery et al., 2017; 
Hoogewerff et al., 2001; Keenleyside et al., 2011; Mitchell and Millard, 2009; Pearson 
et al., 2016; Prowse et al., 2007; Schroeder et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2009).  
3.3.2.2 Radiogenic isotope systems  
A more direct link between migrant and geographic origin can be obtained through the 
analysis of strontium (Bentley, 2006; Montgomery, 2010; Montgomery et al., 2007; 
Price et al., 2002, 1994) and lead (Carlson, 1996; Gulson et al., 1997; Montgomery, 
2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). Strontium has four stable isotopes, 88Sr, 87Sr, 86Sr and 
84Sr, all of which occur naturally in a large variety of rocks and mineral deposits 
(Dickin, 2005; Faure, 1986; Nakano, 2016). The amount of 88Sr, 86Sr and 84Sr within a 
geological deposit remains constant from the time of its formation. However, as 87Sr is 
the daughter isotope of rubidium (87Rb) the abundance of 87Sr increases over time 
(Bentley, 2006; Capo et al., 1998; Faure, 1986). Therefore, the strontium isotope ratio 
obtained from any given geological deposit will vary depending on the age of the 
deposit and the relative abundance of Rb/Sr it contained at the time of its formation 
(Bentley, 2006). For example old, silica-rich granites provide higher 87Sr/86Sr isotope 
ratios than younger, low Rb/Sr basalts (Faure and Powell, 2012; Rogers and 
Hawkesworth, 1989). As different geographical regions are composed of varying types 
of rocks of differing ages, each geographical region produces elemental isotope ratios 
characteristic of its underlying geology. This in effect creates an isotopic fingerprint that 
allows strontium to be used as source tracer in mobility studies.  
Erosion of rocks and minerals facilitates the movement of strontium into the 
surrounding soils where they can be incorporated into local water systems, food chains 
and ultimately human skeletal tissues. Assuming that the majority of a populations food 
and drink is sourced locally, the strontium isotope composition in human skeletal 
material should then reflect the bioavailable strontium isotopes in their region of origin 
(Ericson, 1985; Price et al., 1994b; Sealy et al., 1991; Sealy et al., 1995). The first 
applications of strontium isotope analysis to assess human childhood origins was 
carried out by Ericson (1985, 1989) and subsequently by Sealy (1989) on prehistoric 
Californian and South African populations respectively to identify individuals with 
coastal versus inland childhood origins respectively. This work was subsequently built 
upon with a number of studies investigating migration within prehistoric populations in 
both North and South America (Ezzo et al., 1997; Price et al., 1994b, 2000), Britain 
(Montgomery et al. 2000) and Germany (Grupe et al., 1997; Price et al., 1998, 1994a; 
Schweissing and Grupe, 2000). This extensive body of work has affirmed that strontium 
isotope analysis is an effective tool for investigating human migration within 
archaeological populations, especially when used in conjunction with contextual 
information. The advancements made in strontium isotope analysis by Price et al., 
(2002) and Montgomery (2002) has led to its continued use in a large number of 
mobility studies ranging from pre-Hispanic populations in the Andes (Knudson et 
al. 2005, 2004), and Norse settlements in Scotland (Montgomery et al. 2003) to 
Viking Iceland (Price and Gestsdttir, 2006) and various Mediterranean settlements 
(Nafplioti 2008, 2012; Haverkort et al. 2008; L 2006). The efficacy of strontium 
isotope analysis alongside contextual information has led to its use as one of the 
primary methods to explore human mobility in archaeological studies (Knudson and 
Price, 2007b, p. 25).  
As with strontium, lead isotope ratios also vary with respect to regional geology, and 
are incorporated into human tissues via diet in preindustrial societies. However, 
populations that exploited lead, such as the Romans, tend to have anthropogenic lead 
isotope ratios that reflect the ore sources being utilised in their cultural sphere 
(Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al., 2005). As discussed in chapter 2, 
anthropogenic lead exposure tends to be accompanied by a homogenisation of a given 
societies lead isotope ratios. Therefore, any discordant isotope ratios standout from what 
would be considered the norm for the population, allowing for relatively easy 
identification of migrants in polluted populations. As such, lead isotope ratios in metal-
using societies are well suited for exploring questions of long-distance migration, 
whereas the efficicy of strontium isotope ratios entirely depends upon local geology, but 
can be especially useful when assessing short-distance migration in geologically 
heterogeneous area. Despite their usefulness in identifying migrants in culturally mixed 
skeletal populations (Montgomery et al., 2005, 2010; Montgomery, 2002; Shaw 2016), 
lead isotopes have not been widely used in archaeological mobility studies. 
3.3.2.3 Multi-isotope approach 
The progression of isotope analyses in migration studies has led to an emphasis on 
employing multiple isotope systems in attempts to obtain a higher resolution in the 
possible geographical origins of the individuals analysed. Over the past decade the 
growing number of studies applying a multi-isotope approach has demonstrated its 
improved ability for identify non-locals in archaeological populations (Jay et al., 2013; 
Laffoon et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2012; Mldner et al., 2011, 2009; Oelze et al., 2012; 
Sehrawat and Kaur, 2017). Typically these studies have used various combinations of 
13C, 15N, 18O and 87Sr/86Sr analyses. However, the incorporation of lead isotope 
analysis in mobility studies is becoming increasingly popular (Montgomery, 2002; 
Montgomery et al., 2010, 2005, 2000; Shaw et al., 2016). What all of these studies have 
demonstrated is that where one isotope system tends to identify multiple geographic 
areas of possible origin, the utilisation of additional isotopes systems can greatly narrow 
down the possibilities. This is because each isotope system reflects a particular variable, 
whether that be dietary, climatic or geological, and the combined geographical 
differences in these variables can facilitate greater regional discrimination (Knudson 
and Price, 2007). While there are many examples of where a multi-isotope approach has 
been advantageous in refining the geographic origins of archaeological populations 
(White et al., 2007), it does not provide a perfect means of alleviating the difficulties in 
isolating geographic origins. Some studies have shown that despite employing a 
multitude of isotope systems the geographic origins of some individuals can still remain 
ambiguous, especially where migration was taking place between regions with similar 
environments and cultural practices (Knudson and Price, 2007). 
3.3.3 Isotopic evidence for Roman migration 
Isotope studies have provided strong evidence for high levels of migration within the 
Roman Empire (Millett et al., 2016, p. 209; Prowse et al., 2007; Schweissing and Grupe, 
2003). The introduction of isotopic analyses to this area of research has broadened the 
scope of mobility studies, and facilitated the answering of more nuanced questions. No 
longer limited by the innate biases associated with historical texts and epigraphical 
evidence, which favour societys elite, a more inclusive understanding of migration 
during this period can be obtained. A good example of this is the age-related migration 
study by Prowse et al (2007), demonstrating through the use of oxygen isotopes that 
entire families were on the move rather than the assumed theory that migration was 
predominantly undertaken by adult males.  
A large proportion of multi-isotope studies exploring migration during the Roman 
period have been carried out on Romano-British populations (Chenery et al., 2010, 
2011; Eckardt et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2014; Leach et al., 2010, 
2009; Montgomery et al., 2011; Mldner et al., 2011; Pollard et al., 2011). The majority 
of these studies have been carried out at major urban or military settlements, such as 
York and London, and many of them have identified migrants with diverse and far-
reaching origins, demonstrating the diverse nature of the Roman Empire. Leach et al., 
(2009) used FORDISC alongside strontium and oxygen isotope analysis to verify the 
previous craniometric identification of North African and Middle Eastern individuals at 
Trentholme Drive and The Railway, York (Warwick, 1968). This multi-analytical 
technique was unable to identify any Middle Eastern origins but did find craniometric 
evidence for individuals consistent with North African origins. From their isotope data 
Leach et al., (2009) also identified four outliers with isotope characteristics indicative of 
origins in North Africa, Western Europe or the Mediterranean, but could not narrow 
down the geographic origins any further. A more recent study, building on earlier work 
at Driffield Terrace (Montgomery et al., 2011, 2010; Mldner et al., 2011), combining 
genome and multi-isotope data provided compelling evidence for an individual buried at 
Driffield Terrace, York (3DRIF-26) with childhood origins in the Middle East 
(Martiniano et al., 2016). A multi-isotope study into population diversity of a Roman 
Gloucester population usitilising 13C, 15N, 18O and 87Sr/86Sr was carried out by 
Chenery et al. (2010). The authors found the carbon, nitrogen and strontium results to 
be inconclusive with regards to identifying possible migrants. However, the oxygen 
values obtained from the population indicated that at least six individuals were non-
locals with possible origins in regions of the empire with a warmer climate than Britain 
(Chenery et al., 2010). Redfern et al., (2016) conducted a study on 22 individuals from 
Lant Street, London to investigate the geographic origins of the group using 
macromorphoscopics, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes. From this small population 
skeletal morphometrics identified four individuals with possible African ancestry and 
two with possible origins in Asia, while the isotope results suggest a further five 
individuals with origins within the circum-Mediterranean (Redfern et al., 2016). The 
authors conclude that their study adds to the growing wealth of isotopic evidence for 
Roman migration but that the addition of strontium and lead isotopes would help refine 
the identification of places of origin and strengthen their conclusions. Of course, Britain 
was not the only region of the Empire home to a diverse, multi-cultural population. 
Multi-isotope studies have also identified non-locals within Roman populations in Italy 
(Killgrove, 2013; Killgrove and Montgomery, 2016; Montgomery et al., 2010; Prowse 
et al., 2007, 2004), Egypt (Dupras and Schwarcz, 2001) and Bavaria (Schweissing and 
Grupe, 2003).  
What is clear from these examples of Roman migration studies is that the majority of 
them use the conventional combination of oxygen and strontium analyses to identify 
possible migrants. Very few studies use lead as a discriminant despite its potential for 
refining regions of geographic origin. Those that have included lead in their 
interpretations have found it useful in further constraining possible places of origin 
(Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). The first application of lead isotopes to 
answer question of Roman migration was carried out by Molleson et al., (1986) on bone 
samples from individuals from Poundbury Camp, Dorset. From the four individuals 
analysed a child was identified as a possible non-local with lead isotope ratios 
inconsistent with British lead ore, from which it was concluded that the child was a 
migrant to England from the Laurion region of Greece (Molleson et al., 1986). However, 
Montgomery (2002), in the first lead isotope study on enamel from Roman-period 
individuals, points out that this Greek isotope ratio actually sits on a mixing line 
between the local Cretaceous chalk in Dorset and English lead ore. As such it is likely 
that the highly porous nature of the non-adult bones facilitated diagenetic ion 
incorporation directly from the burial environment that resulted in a natural geological 
isotope ratio rather than one deriving from anthropogenic exposure to English ore lead 
(Montgomery, 2002). 
Tooth enamel has shown to be largely resistant to diagenetic alteration and has therefore 
been the target sample material for more recent lead isotope studies. One such study by 
Shaw et al., (2016), analysed strontium and lead isotope ratios to assess geographic 
origins in a Roman London population. This study identified three non-locals, one child 
with possible origins in the Rhine Valley and two adults with isotope characteristics 
consistent with Mediterranean origins. Shaw et al., (2016) conclude that lead isotopes 
were valuable in terms of refining potential areas of childhood residency and 
significantly aided in the interpretation of geographic origins where homogenous 
strontium isotope ratios was inconclusive. Another example of the efficacy of lead 
isotopes is the study of an elaborate lead coffin burial from Spitalfields, London 
(Montgomery et al., 2010). Again, the strontium isotope result was relatively 
undiagnostic due to the widespread occurrence of the Mesozoic terrains with which the 
isotope ratio is associated. However, the lead isotopes obtained from the individual fell 
within the field of silver dienarii from Roman mints as well as contemporaneous 
individuals from Rome and suggests that the female originated from Italy, possibly even 
Rome (Montgomery et al., 2010).  
3.4 Lead as a commodity 
Despite there being evidence for the use of lead in the form of lead glazed pottery and 
lead figurines from as early as 4000 BC (Rich, 2014, p. 4), it is the Romans over 3000 
years later that come to the forefront of any discussions pertaining to the ancient 
exploitation of the metal. This is likely due to the magnitude of lead mining underway 
during this period. Unlike during earlier periods, the Romans engaged in large-scale 
lead mining for the extraction of the metal in its own right, rather than acquiring it as a 
by-product from the mining of more precious metals such as silver (Bayley, 1992; 
Tylecote, 1992).  
Lead was used heavily in the municipal water systems throughout the Roman Empire. 
Water storage and distribution systems such as cisterns and aqueducts were lined with 
vast numbers of lead sheets. For example, it is reported that 12 tonnes of lead was used 
in the construction of just one of the pumps at an aqueduct in Lyons (Waldron et al., 
1979). Lead pipes and lead seals were also extensively used in plumbing systems 
distributing water to a range of buildings, including public baths, fountains, stadiums, 
theatres, temples, and private housing (Ortloff and Crouch, 2001). Drinking water was 
not the only potential source of lead contamination for Romans, tableware and 
cookware also contained a high proportion of lead (Hornborg et al., 2007, p. 37). Pewter, 
a lead and tin alloy, was often used to make dining and kitchen utensils (Needleman and 
Needleman, 1985; Waldron, 1973). It was also popular to line pots and pans made of 
bronze or copper with lead to prevent food taking on an undesirable metallic taste from 
the cookware (Retief and Cilliers, 2006). 
Besides its use in Roman water systems, the lead content of wine is possibly one of the 
most well documented ways in which the Romans utilised lead. Wine was often 
sweetened with sapa, defrutum or caroenum, which were preservative syrups made by 
boiling down grape must in lead-lined kettles (Eisinger, 1982). Wine was not the only 
consumable regularly tainted with the toxic metal, sugar of lead (lead acetate) was a 
popular additive in many recipes to add sweetness to the dishes. Translations of the only 
surviving recipe book from the period demonstrate how commonplace sweetening 
foodstuffs with lead was, with one fifth of Apicius 450 recipes calling for the inclusion 
of sugar of lead (Vehling, 2012).  
The Romans also made use of lead in cosmetics and medicines. Lead compounds such 
as white lead (lead carbonate) and red lead (lead tetraoxide) were commonly used in 
face powders to lighten the skin and as rouge respectively. Kohl, made from finely 
ground galena (lead sulphide), was also a popular eye makeup during the period 
(Bergman, 2017; Needleman and Needleman, 1985; Retief and Cilliers, 2006). With 
regards to medicines, there is documentary evidence describing the use of white lead in 
salves and eye ointments (Needleman and Needleman, 1985; Westhrop, 2011) and the 
inclusion of yellow lead (lead oxide) as an ingredient in many topical treatments for 
dermatological diseases and antiwrinkle creams (Bergman, 2017; Gilfillan, 1965; 
Retief and Cilliers, 2006). White, yellow and red lead were also used to make pigments 
and paints (Gooch, 2014, p. 15). Finally, childrens toys such as dolls, figurines and 
crepundia (necklaces incorporating rattles or trinkets designed to keep children quiet, 
especially during teething) were often made from pewter or lead (Gilfillan, 1965, p. 58; 
Roberts, 2009, p. 49). Hand to mouth activity is a common route of lead acquisition, 
especially in children (Baghurst et al., 1992; Bellinger et al., 1986; Bornschein et al., 
1985; Freeman et al., 2001; Lanphear et al., 1996; Muller et al., 2018). Therefore, the 
use of lead in toys, especially those made purposefully for teething infants who are the 
most susceptible to lead poisoning was a particularly hazardous use of the metal. While 
lead was by no means limited to these uses, the above examples demonstrate the 
multifarious ways in which Roman individuals of all ages could come into contact with 
lead in a manner that would have resulted in bioaccumulation of the toxic metal. 
3.5 Unwittingly poisoned 
As outlined above (section 3.4), the Romans used lead for a multitude of social and 
industrial practices. Consequently, the Romans were the first to significantly contribute 
to widespread environmental lead pollution and as a result also unintentionally 
increased human lead burdens (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Settle and 
Patterson, 1980). It is this previously unprecedented accessibility to the metal in all 
social strata that makes the idea of widespread lead poisoning throughout the Empire a 
popular topic of debate. Scholars have argued both for and against lead playing a 
significant role in the fall of the Roman Empire (Cilliers and Retief, 2014; Gilfillan, 
1965; Nriagu, 1983b; Retief and Cilliers, 2006; Scarborough, 1984). A more recent 
approach to this issue does not set out to prove or disprove the role of lead in the 
downfall of Rome, but rather attempts to quantify the extent of lead exposure in Roman 
provinces and assess the impact it may have had on health within these regions (Delile 
et al., 2014; Le Roux et al., 2005; Mackie et al., 1975; Molleson et al., 1986; Vron et 
al., 2006; Waldron et al., 1976; Whittaker and Stack, 1984).  
The preference for making wine in lead vessels is well documented, with Roman writers 
such as Pliny the Elder, Columella and Cato all advocating for its use (Columella, 1989; 
Eisinger, 1982; Mould, 1996; Waldron, 1973). Putting these ancient methods into 
practice, a study by Hofmann (1883) found that boiling grape must in lead lined kettles 
produced a sapa with a lead concentration of 237 g/L. A further study in which 
Hofmann (1918, p. 638) followed the preparation instructions for two types of wine and 
grape must by the Roman writer Columella, produced liquids that contained between 
390  788 g/L of lead (Mould, 1996, p. 67). From these results it is clear that the 
Roman methods for fermenting, sweetening and preserving wines created products 
containing harmful concentrations of lead. Boeckx (1986) has estimated that drinking 
wine prepared in this way could have led to the average Roman ingesting between 35  
320 g/Pb per day, and members of the aristocracy ingesting as much as 160  1520 
g/Pb per day. This toxic preparation technique seems to have been the norm as Pliny 
the Elder wrote that wine contained lead more often than not (Westhrop, 2011). Adults 
were not the only people effected by the lead in wine, there is documentary evidence 
that children were also consuming the beverage (Laes, 2011, p. 81). The physician 
Soranus advocated for the use of breadcrumbs soaked in wine as a weaning food 
(Soranus: Translated by Temkin, 1956), and the wirings of Galen, Aristotle and 
Hippocrates suggest that allowing children to drink wine was commonplace (Garnsey, 
1999, p. 107; Laes, 2011, p. 81). As it was commonly consumed daily and accessible to 
everyone, wine is likely to have been a major route of lead exposure throughout the 
Empire, especially if the concentrations above are to be believed. This provides 
compelling evidence for the possibility that varying degrees of lead poisoning were 
being suffered throughout the Empire, especially when considering that wine was not 
the only route of exposure. 
The extensive use of lead pipes in the Roman Empire is often suggested as a significant 
source of lead exposure throughout the period (Gilfillan, 1990; Hodge, 1981; Nriagu, 
1983b; Retief and Cilliers, 2006). It appears that the Romans were also aware of the 
hazards of its use in water systems. Vitruvius, a prominent Roman architect and 
engineer was critical of the use of lead in water systems, and explicitly warned against 
its use (Eisinger, 1982; Hodge, 1981). Instead he advocated for the use of clay or 
terracotta pipes to distribute water (Eisinger, 1982; Hodge, 1981).  
Water is much more wholesome from earthenware than from lead 
pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead because ceruse is 
produced by it; and this is said to be harmful to the human body  
Therefore, it seems that water should not be brought in lead pipes if we 
desire to have it wholesome. 
(Vitruvius in Hodge, 1981) 
Despite these warnings lead piping was used to distribute water over long distances, 
from aqueducts and castellum aquae into peoples homes and other municipal buildings 
(Waldron, 1973). Kobert (1909) reasoned that evidence of poisoning from 18th-century 
lead pipes, which ran from inside the home to the main cast iron pipes in the street was 
proof enough that Romans using lead piping over much longer distances would have 
also suffered its ill effects. Aside from Koberts (1909) bold declaration, there is little 
other research that explicitly states that lead pipes caused widespread lead poisoning. 
Rather it appears that until recently it was simply accepted that lead poisoning was 
widespread and that drinking water could be attributable to the cause (Gilfillan, 1990; 
Waldron, 1973).   
A more recent study employing lead isotope analysis attempts to quantify the level of 
lead exposure from Roman water systems. A study of sediment core samples from the 
Tiber River and Trajanic Harbour by Delile et al., (2014) suggests that drinking water 
distributed using Roman leaded water systems would have contained up to 100 times 
more lead than water sourced from local springs. Even lead seals on clay and terracotta 
pipes have been shown to release between 210  390 g/L of lead into the water passing 
through them (Cosgrove et al., 1989). Modern guidelines for water quality recommend 
that lead concentrations do not exceed 5 g/L in drinking water (WHO, 2011). 
Therefore these studies certainly suggest that Roman populations were exposed to 
harmful levels of lead in their drinking water. Arguments against Roman leaded water 
systems posing a significant risk to health propose that the build-up of sinter (calcium 
carbonate) deposits inside water pipes, cisterns and aqueducts, especially in areas of 
hard water, would have created a protective lining separating drinking water from the 
toxic metal (DWI, 2013). In fact, historical documents show that sinter build-up was so 
prevalent that its removal was a fulltime occupation, carried out predominantly by 
slaves (Hughes, 2011), with build-up rates estimated to be up to six inches per year if 
left to accumulate naturally (Hodge, 2013, p. 290, 2002, p. 8). Together with the 
biologically antagonistic nature that exists between lead and calcium, sinter would have 
presumably provided a buffer against the bioaccumulation of lead from drinking water 
(Rosborg, 2016, p. 126). However, studies by the World Health Organisation have 
shown that the flaking of sinter into a water supply can contaminate the water, 
significantly increasing its lead concentration even when the water is no longer 
plumbosolvent (WHO, 2011).  
It is evident that lead, whether ingested intentionally (e.g. wine) or unwittingly (e.g. 
water), was highly accessible to everyone within the Roman Empire, and exceeded lead 
concentrations that are considered safe today. However, it is uncertain to what extent 
these sources of lead impacted upon health. There is no doubt that the Romans knew of 
leads toxicity, with many of the authors of the time writing of its poisonous nature. 
Pliny the Elder noted that both red lead and lead acetate were deadly poisons and should 
not be used medicinally, while Celsus, a 2nd century philosopher, wrote of an antidote 
for white lead poisoning (Celsus, 1989, p. 125; Hodge, 1981). However, there appears 
to have been a cognitive dissonance between the acknowledgment of leads toxic nature 
and its use in food and drink. The most compelling evidence for lead poisoning in the 
Roman Empire comes from Paulus gineta, a Greek physician who is credited as 
describing the first account of a lead poisoning pandemic (gineta, 1847; Waldron, 
1973).  
 the colic affliction which now prevails is occasioned by such 
humours; having taken its rise in the country of Italy, but raging also in 
many other regions of the Roman Empire, like a pestilential contagion, 
which in many cases terminates in epilepsy, but in others in paralysis of 
the extremities. 
(gineta, 1847, p. 534) 
Roman texts often mention the symptoms of lead poisoning, especially colic and 
constipation, both of which are concomitant with the affliction, but do not attribute their 
causes to lead (Lessler, 1988; Needleman, 2009; Waldron, 1973). Therefore, it is 
modern interpretations of Roman texts that form the basis of any speculations on the 
clinical effects of lead poisoning experienced by Roman populations. For example, the 
madness of Emperors Caligula and Nero may be attributable to the central nervous 
system effects of lead poisoning (Gilfillan, 1965; Nriagu, 1983b); gout among the 
aristocracy could have been caused by lead-induced kidney damage (Gaebel, 1983; 
Nriagu, 1983b) and lead poisoning could even be implicated in the supposed decrease in 
the aristocratic class due to its infertility effects (Gilfillan, 1990). As specific accounts 
of lead poisoning are scare in Roman texts it is becoming increasingly popular to search 
for more direct evidence of lead poisoning through lead concentration analysis of 
human remains from the period.  
Some of the first studies to analyse lead concentrations in Roman skeletal material were 
carried out on Romano-British populations using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The 
Romano-British sites at Poundbury Camp, Dorset, Henley Wood, Somerset and 
Trentholme Drive, York recorded unprecedentedly high bone lead concentrations in the 
skeletal material recovered there (Mackie et al., 1975; Molleson et al., 1986; Waldron et 
al., 1976; Whittaker and Stack, 1984). While little attempt was made to link these high 
concentrations with lead poisoning, the exceptionally high lead concentrations in the 
foetal remains were suggested as possible cause of death for the infants as high lead 
levels can induce spontaneous abortion and stillbirth (Waldron et al., 1979).  In these 
studies all lead concentrations were obtained from bone samples, and while there were 
no correlations in lead concentrations between the bone and soil samples collected at the 
sites, the authors acknowledged that the porous nature of the samples used may have 
facilitated some degree of ion exchange in the burial environment (Molleson et al., 
1986; Waldron et al., 1976; Waldron et al., 1979).  
It was not until the work of Montgomery (2002) that real strides in the advancement of 
lead isotope analysis of archaeological human remains were made. Montgomery (2002) 
developed a methodology that minimised the risk of contamination from the burial 
environment, providing a means of confidently assessing in vivo lead characteristics 
(see Chapter 2). This method utilised tooth enamel instead of bone, and although this 
limited investigations to childhood lead burdens, Montgomery et al. (2002, 2010) found 
that Roman childhood lead burdens were up to three times higher than what is 
considered severely toxic today (Montgomery et al., 2010). Despite Montgomerys 
ground-breaking research, until recently there have been very few bioarchaeological 
studies assessing the impact of environmental lead pollution on Roman populations. A 
joint study by McMaster University and the University of Sheffield, entitled Deadly 
Lead: How lead poisoning affected the Roman Empire (Prowse and Carroll, 2017), is 
one of the first studies since the work of Montgomery et al. (2010) to explore lead 
concentrations and health in a Roman population. In a similar vein to this current study, 
Prowse and Carroll (2017) hope to garner new insights into the physiological effects of 
lead pollution on a Roman population. 
3.6 Summary 
It is widely accepted that there was extensive movement of people throughout the 
Roman Empire (Braudel, 1995; Horden and Purcell, 2000; Scheidel, 2004). In fact the 
term cosmopolitan has become quite a popular adjective when describing Roman 
populations (Chenery et al., 2011; Gray, 1958; Leach et al., 2010; Martiniano et al., 
2016; Montgomery et al., 2011; Turner, 2002; Wright, 2002, p. 98), which is testament 
to the cultural diversity thought to characterise Roman societies. This propensity for 
migration together with the substantial environmental lead pollution of the period makes 
the Romans an ideal study population for the further development of lead isotope ratios 
as a discriminatory tool in mobility studies. 
It has been shown that difficulties often arise when attempting to identify non-locals 
using traditional methods such as epigraphy, grave goods or burial rites, which are 
largely dependent upon what has been consciously chosen to be recorded or included 
(Pearce, 2000). The relatively new application of multi-isotope techniques to assess 
geographic origins overcomes some of these issues by facilitating a more inclusive 
analysis of all individuals irrespective of their funerary rite. The majority of mobility 
studies have used various combinations of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium 
isotope analyses in attempts to identify migrants. However, over the last 20 years there 
has been an increase in the number of studies employing lead isotope ratios to address 
archaeological questions of geographic origins (Budd et al., 2004; Montgomery, 2002; 
Montgomery et al., 2014, 2010, 2005; Shaw et al., 2016). The majority of Roman lead 
isotope studies have been done using British populations, and while they are beginning 
to further our understanding of how lead isotope systems can benefit mobility studies, 
they are limited in their geographical scope. The lack of human lead isotope ratio 
baselines for different regions of the Roman Empire means that when individuals 
inconsistent with the local population are identified it is difficult to place their actual 
childhood origins. Therefore it is clear that more human reference datasets are needed 
from all areas of the Roman Empire to establish the normal variation expected in 
Roman populations as well as to assess temporal-spatial isotope variation throughout 
the Empire. 
As previously discussed, there is a correlation between increased environmental lead 
concentrations and increased human lead concentrations during the Roman period (see 
Chapter 2). Studies have also shown that during this period there was an increased 
prevalence of metabolic diseases that can be associated with lead poisoning; this is 
especially well documented within Romano-British populations (Roberts and Cox, 
2003). Historical literature also describes maladies consistent with lead poisoning, and 
acknowledges the toxic nature of the metal (Lessler, 1988; Needleman, 2009; Waldron, 
1973). This will be discussed further in Chapters Four and Five, but what is important 
to note here is that there are both literary and bioarchaeological evidence to support the 
notion that people experienced both environmental and physical consequences of lead 
pollution during this period (Jonasson and Afshari, 2017). These increased lead burdens 
make the Romans an ideal population for investigating how anthropogenically induced 
environmental changes impacted upon heath and mortality. 
CHAPTER FOUR 
The Impact of Lead on Human Health 
4.1 Introduction 
Human exploitation of the versatile physical and chemical properties of lead has an 
enduring history that stretches into antiquity, a history that is intimately intertwined 
with the insidious nature of the prized metal. For as long as people have utilised lead 
they have suffered the deleterious effects of lead poisoning (plumbism) on their health. 
These effects are usually systemic and manifest as metabolic diseases, neurological 
deficits and a failure to thrive in infants (Needleman 2004). Due to the widespread 
accessibility of lead to Roman populations it is likely that they too suffered the ill 
effects of lead toxicity. Historical literature describes maladies that, under modern 
interpretation, strongly suggest that lead poisoning was a cause for concern. However, 
despite bioarchaeological evidence for high lead concentrations in technologically 
advanced past populations, and historical documentation describing the negative impact 
lead had on health, very little research has been done to assess this impact 
archaeologically. This chapter explores the biochemical interactions of lead poisoning 
within the human body to inform our understanding of how lead poisoning may 
manifest in skeletal remains, how lead burdens can be quantified and how this can be 
used to inform our interpretations of lead poisoning in past populations.  
4.2 Metabolism and toxicokinetics of lead 
4.2.1 Exposure, absorption and storage 
Lead is a non-essential trace element that is ubiquitous within the environment. It acts 
as a cumulative poison when incorporated into biological systems, causing a myriad of 
biological, physiological and behavioural dysfunctions (Casas and Sordo, 2011). The 
predominant route for human acquisition of lead is usually via inhalation or ingestion of 
inorganic lead salts, which then slowly accumulate in soft tissues and bone. Organic 
lead compounds are generally more toxic than their inorganic counterparts due to their 
lipid solubility, facilitating a greater adsorption rate especially through direct contact 
with skin. Therefore a more rapid bioaccumulation of lead is seen in soft tissues with 
organic lead exposure than inorganic lead exposure (Hathcock, 2012; Mahaffey, 1978).  
Airborne lead can either be in the form of aerosols (dust, smoke, fog etc.) or vapours 
(free molecules/gas). Inhaled lead vapours can quickly infiltrate the entire pulmonary 
system and have an exceedingly high absorption rate of approximately 99% with only 
1% being exhaled during normal respiratory function (Booker et al., 1969). However, 
lead vapours have an extremely short lifespan as they are rapidly condensed into smoke, 
incorporated onto the surface of dust particles or readily react with oxygen to form 
clusters of lead oxide particles (Castellino and Castellino, 1995). The extent to which 
aerosolised lead is absorbed into the bloodstream is dependent upon the size of the 
particulates inhaled, airborne concentrations and the individuals ventilation rate 
(Chamberlain, 1983). Approximately 40  50% of inhaled lead with a particulate 
diameter of <1 m can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and be absorbed through 
the alveoli into the bloodstream. The remaining fraction of inhaled lead is confined 
within the upper respiratory tract where it is removed by mucociliary mechanisms, 
enabling it to be either swallowed or exhaled (Needleman, 1991). The absorption 
percentage of ingested lead differs considerably to that of inhaled lead. Adults tend to 
absorb approximately 5  15% of ingested lead into the bloodstream (Alexander et al., 
1974; Ziegler et al., 1978), while in children, absorption rates can be as high as 50% 
(Hursh and Suomela, 1968; Rabinowitz et al., 1976). Although the reasons behind this 
age related decrease in absorption are still unclear, studies have shown that dietary 
deficiencies and excesses can significantly alter the efficiency of lead absorption 
(Mahaffey, 1981). A low dietary intake of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and calcium (Ca), for 
example, have all been associated with an increased absorption of lead. Conversely 
diets high in fibre and phytate tend to reduce the amount of lead absorbed through the 
gastrointestinal tract (Ahamed and Siddiqui, 2007; Needleman, 1991). 
Once absorbed, lead circulates around the body in the bloodstream. Up to 99% of 
absorbed lead is bound to erythrocytes (red blood cells), with the remaining 1% 
associated with the plasma fraction of blood. As lead circulates it is either deposited in 
soft tissues and bone or excreted with other waste products. The lead stored in the body 
is known as the lead body burden and levels depend on the level and duration of 
exposure, bone metabolism rates and rate of excretion. Approximately 90-95% of the 
bodys lead burden is stored in the skeletal tissues (Berman, 1966; Raj, 2010), with the 
remaining 5% distributed in the soft tissues (predominantly the liver, kidney and brain). 
The preferential storage in skeletal tissues, alongside the supposed substitution of Ca2+ 
for Pb2+ in bone mineral matrices has prompted lead to be termed a bone-seeking 
element. However, there is little evidence to indicate that the mechanism behind the 
incorporation of lead into bone is a simple substitution of Ca2+ for Pb2+ (Lockitch, 1993; 
Neuman and Neuman, 1953). Lead stored in the body is not homogenously distributed 
throughout the skeleton; there are considerable variations in the concentration of lead 
between different skeletal elements (rib, femur etc.) as well as between different types 
of bone (cortical, cancellous) (Aufderheide, 1989; Barry, 1978; Drasch, 1982; Erkkil et 
al., 1992).  
4.2.2 Mechanisms of toxicity 
The basic principle behind lead toxicity is its ability to impair the normal function of 
metabolic pathways. Due to their electropositive state, lead ions have an affinity for 
sulfhydryl and amide groups, which are ubiquitous in biological molecules. When 
bound to these groups, lead weakens the structural and functional integrity of 
innumerable biologically important molecules (Flora et al., 2012). The various cellular, 
intracellular and molecular interactions that underpin the toxicological effects of lead to 
biological systems are complex, but are predominantly the result of ionic and oxidative 
stress mechanisms.  
Lead toxicity induces oxidative stress in cells by stimulating the generation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2
). ROS are 
reactive molecules and free radicals that derive from molecular oxygen. Despite their 
ability to cause numerous deleterious events, when closely regulated these molecules 
act as inter- and intracellular messengers that stimulate metabolic pathways that regulate 
gene expression, cell signalling cascades and apoptosis (Hancock et al., 2001). The 
disruption to ROS regulation by lead toxicity is twofold, as in addition to catalysing the 
increased production of ROS it also diminishes the availability and activity of important 
antioxidant molecules responsible for neutralising damaging ROS molecules (Flora et 
al., 2012; Flora, 2002).  
Lead also disrupts normal cellular processes by substituting for biologically important 
cations, such as Na+, Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+ (Lidsky and Schneider, 2003). The 
substitution of Pb2+ for these cations interferes with numerous cellular processes 
including apoptosis, protein folding, ionic transportation and the regulation of 
neurotransmitters and enzyme activity (Garza et al., 2006). The consequences of these 
ionic substitution are primarily responsible for the neurotoxicity associated with lead 
poisoning, especially its substitution for Ca2+ and Na+ cations (Bressler et al., 1999). 
4.3 Clinical manifestations of lead poisoning   
4.3.1 Acute poisoning 
Acute lead poisoning is usually related to occupational exposure, during which an 
individual absorbs a high concentration of lead within a short period of time, and is an 
uncommon occurrence in modern societies. The effects of acute lead toxicity are found 
at blood lead (B-Pb) levels above 80 g/dL, and the most likely route of intoxication is 
accidental ingestion of a large quantity of lead salts or inhalation of lead vapours 
(Tsuchiya, 1986). The most common clinical symptoms that accompany acute expose 
include intestinal colic, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, hypertension, bradycardia and 
constipation. If the concentration of absorbed lead is high enough, peripheral 
paraesthesia, muscle pain and weakness, severe anaemia, renal failure and 
encephalopathy may ensue, with death following within days (Cilliers and Retief, 2014). 
4.3.2 Chronic poisoning 
Chronic lead poisoning is much more insidious than its acute counterpart. Long-term 
exposure to small amounts of lead facilitates the gradual accumulation of the toxin in 
bodily tissues. Due to the systemic nature of lead toxicity the clinical manifestations of 
chronic poisoning are varied and complex. With its propensity to disrupt metabolic 
pathways, it is unsurprising that chronic lead poisoning has been associated with a 
number of metabolic diseases (Landrigan, 1989). Of these, anaemia is one of the most 
common presentations, resulting from leads ability to inhibit haem synthesis and 
induce haemolysis of red blood cells (Gossel and Bricker, 2001, p. 192; Papanikolaou et 
al., 2005; Piomelli, 2002). Rickets is another metabolic disorder often seen in 
conjunction with chronic lead poisoning and is likely due to the metals inhibition of 
25-hydroxyvitimin-D-1-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting vitamin D 
into its active form (Alasia, 2010; Logham-Adham, 1997). Renal failure is a common 
complication of lead poisoning and the resultant hyperuricemia is the main cause of 
gout (Alasia, 2010; Lin et al., 2002, 1999). Saturnine gout is a secondary rheumatic 
arthropathy and this excruciatingly painful condition has been associated with lead 
poisoning since antiquity (Bennett, 1985). While hyperuricemia is the same cause of 
primary gout, saturnine gout is somewhat distinct in its predilection for manifesting in 
the knee rather than the toe (Dalvi and Pillinger, 2013; Taylor and Grainger, 2011, pp. 
105120).  
The neurological symptoms associated with lead toxicity are particularly devastating, 
especially in children (Bellinger, 2004), causing disruptions to neuromuscular and 
neurobehavioural functions, inducing encephalopathies. The manifestations of these 
encephalopathies are diverse in their severity, ranging from headaches and delirium, to 
seizures and cerebral oedema (Holtzman et al., 1984). The neuromuscular dysfunctions 
associated with lead poisoning are characterised by paralysis, particularly intestinal 
smooth muscle causing intestinal colic and peripheral paralysis in the extremities. The 
radial nerve is most commonly affected, resulting in the classic wrist drop manifestation 
of chronic poisoning (Geraldine and Venkatesh, 2007; Needleman, 2004; Pearce, 2007). 
The neurobehavioural effects of lead poisoning are also numerous and well documented. 
Correlations between lead levels and reduced IQ are particularly well established, with 
an estimated half an IQ point lost with every 1 g/dL increase in blood lead levels 
(Lanphear et al., 2005; Pocock et al., 1994; Schwartz, 1994). Other neurobehavioural 
impairments include memory loss, attention deficit disorder (ADD), reduced impulse 
control and delinquent behaviour, of which increased aggression is particularly common 
(Dietrich et al., 2001; Pabello and Bolivar, 2005; Wright et al., 2008).   
4.4 Skeletal manifestations of lead poisoning 
With the exception of metaphyseal lead lines visible on radiographs (Gandhi et al., 
2003; Needleman, 2004), no specific skeletal lesions have been associated with lead 
poisoning. This is most likely due to the toxicodynamics of absorbed lead culminating 
in clinical manifestations common to many other disease processes. However, using 
modern clinical literature and the known biochemical pathogenesis of lead toxicity it is 
possible to postulate the types of skeletal pathological alterations that may be common 
among individuals exhibiting high lead concentrations. 
4.4.1 Carious lesions 
Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a disease characterised by the localised 
demineralisation of tooth enamel (see Fig. 4.1). It is a chronic disease that can be seen 
in the crown (coronal caries) and root (root caries) portions of both the deciduous and 
permanent teeth (Irish and Scott, 2015). It is a multifactorial disease catalysed by a 
microbiological shift within the complex biofilm on the tooth surface, and can be 
affected by salivary flow and composition, diet and exposure to heavy metals (Selwitz 
et al., 2007). There was an increase in prevalence rates of carious lesions in European 
populations during the Roman period, likely as a result of changes to diet and increased 
exposure to environmental heavy metal pollution (Touger-Decker and Van Loveren, 
2003). Although Touger-Decker and Van Loveren (2003) suggest that increased heavy 
metal burdens may have contributed to the increase in carious lesions during the Roman 
period, it is likely that multiple factors contributed to this observed increase in 
prevalence rates. 
The negative effects of lead poisoning on dental health has been studied since the mid-
19th century (Des Planches, 1839), and corroborated by modern epidemiological studies 
(Bartsiokas and Day, 1993; Brudevold et al., 1977; Gil et al., 1996; Moss et al., 1999; 
Nriagu et al., 2006). However, some studies have found that there is only a weak 
association between elevated lead burdens and the presence of carious lesions and that 
the development of these lesions is probably population specific (Campbell et al., 2000; 
Gemmel et al., 2002). In all studies, children of a lower socioeconomic status and those 
living in urban environments have been identified as being the most at risk of 
developing carious lesions and acquiring high lead burdens. To date the biochemical 
mechanisms behind the cariogenic effects of lead are unknown (Nriagu et al., 2006). 
However, theories include lead damage to acinar cells in the parotid gland, which alters 
the secretion of proteins, lysosomal enzymes and calcium  (Abdollahi et al., 1997). 
Impaired salivary secretion causing dry mouth (xerostomia), a common symptom of 
lead poisoning (Watson et al., 1997), and an overall reduced quality of saliva impeding 
its natural disease preventative functions (Mandel, 1993) have also been suggested as 
causes. As previous studies have shown, the relationship between lead levels and 
carious lesions is clearly a complex one and likely multifactorial. However, despite the 
uncertainties there is clearly a correlation between increased lead levels and prevalence 
of carious lesions.

(Source Klingner, 2013) 
4.4.2 Enamel hypoplasia 
Enamel hypoplasia results from a break in the continuity of enamel synthesis, which 
reduces the number of layers of enamel, creating grooves or depressions on the surface 
of the tooth crown (see Fig. 4.2) (Umapathy et al., 2013). The most common causes of 
disruption to the genetic and environmental factors that tightly regulate the synthesis of 
enamel are vitamin deficiency, systemic illness, and environmental pollution (Fagrell et 
al., 2011). While no studies have actively sought to verify a link between lead burdens 
and the presence of enamel hypoplasia, the general stress induced by the systemic 
disruption to metabolic pathways caused by lead poisoning may be sufficiently 
deleterious to health as to result in hypoplastic change.

4.4.3 Anaemia 
Anaemia results from the inability of erythrocytes to transport sufficient amounts of 
oxygen around the body, and can either be congenital (e.g. sickle cell anaemia) or 
acquired (e.g. deficiencies in iron or vitamin B12) in its aetiology (Ortner, 2003). 
Elevated lead burdens can result in an acquired anaemia. At very low levels (5 g/dL) 
lead has been shown to inhibit the activity of key enzymes in the haemopoietic pathway 
(-aminolevulinic acid dehyratase (ALA-D) and ferrochelatase), which decreases the 
formation of haem in erythrocyte precursor cells (normoblasts) (Gossel and Bricker, 
2001, p. 192; Papanikolaou et al., 2005; Piomelli, 2002). Lead also weakens the cell 
membrane of erythrocytes, making them prone to haemolysis and thereby shortening 
their normal lifespan.  The overall effect of lead poisoning on the haem synthesis 
pathway is microcytic hypochromic anaemia, which is characterised by immature 
erythrocytes with low levels of haemoglobin and basophilic stippling (Bain, 2014).

REASONS 
The most common skeletal lesions associated with anaemia are porotic hyperostosis and 
cribra orbitalia (see Fig. 4.3). Both are descriptive terms used to describe abnormal 
pitting and porosity on the external surface of the cranial vault and orbital roofs 
respectively (Stuart-Macadam, 1987, 1989, 1992; Walker et al., 2009). Anaemia is so 
pervasive in clinical literature associated with lead poisoning that the skeletal 
manifestations of the disorder are a popular target in bioarchaeological studies exploring 
lead exposure in past populations. A review of recent literature shows that cribra 
orbitalia is the most commonly used pathological alteration in bioarchaeological studies 
attempting to correlate high lead burdens with skeletal evidence of lead poisoning 
(Facchini et al., 2004; Gle-Haduch et al., 1997; Millard et al., 2014; Zaria et al., 2016).  
However, while cribra orbitalia is undoubtedly an indication of stress and has strong 
clinical links to haemopoietic stress, not all types of anaemia are thought to cause this 
particular osseous response. Until relatively recently, iron-deficiency anaemia was 
thought to be the predominant cause of cribra orbitalia (Ponka, 1997; Stodder, 2006), 
and so popular was the theory that the presence of the lesion became synonymous with 
the presence of the disorder. However, recent research suggests that iron-deficiency 
anaemia does not elicit the marrow hypertrophy necessary to induce the bony changes 
of cribra orbitalia (Wapler et al., 2004). The recent works of Walker et al. (2009)  puts 
forward a strong argument for megaloblastic and haemolytic anaemias being a more 
likely cause for the lesion.  However, Oxenham and Cavill (2010) contest Walker et 
als., (2009) claims that iron-deficient anaemia cannot cause cribra orbitalia, stating that 
although there is a reduction in the production of fully matured erythrocytes there is a 
large increase in intramedullary erythropoiesis, which would cause marrow hyperplasia 
(Oxenham and Cavill, 2010). Although like iron-deficiency anaemia, lead poisoning 
causes microcytic hypochromic anaemia, lead inhibits rather than stimulates 
erythropoiesis (Kwong et al., 2004), and as such is unlikely to induce the physiological 
responses necessary to produce cribrous changes (Lewis, 2017, p. 200). This study will 
compare the presence of cribra orbitalia and lead concentrations to test the hypothesis 
that cribra orbitalia cannot be used as a skeletal marker suggestive of lead poisoning.

4.4.4 Rickets 
Rickets is caused by a deficiency in the pro-hormone vitamin D (1,25-
dihydroxyvitimin-D), which plays an important role in the regulation of calcium and 
phosphorous levels in the body. It is synthesised in the kidneys and is involved in the 
stimulation of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and osteopontin synthesis, all of which 
are important for the normal mineralisation of newly formed bone osteoid (Brickley and 
Ives 2009; Favis 1999; Pitt 1988; Heaney 1997; Holick and Adams 1998). A deficiency 
in vitamin D results in a shortage of these essential ions and proteins, preventing osteoid 
mineralisation and ultimately weakening bone mineral matrices (Arnaud and Glorieux 
1997; Holick 2003). Chronic exposure to lead often leads to nephropathy (renal 
damage), and if allowed to persist, renal failure ensues (Alasia, 2010; Lin et al., 2002,

REASONS 
1999). Prolonged lead toxicity can inhibit the activity of 25-hydroxyvitimin-D-1-
hydroxylase, which is the enzyme responsible for converting 25-hydroxyvitimin-D into 
its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitimin-D (Rosen et al., 1980). The inhibition of this 
enzyme has been recorded with blood lead levels as low as 10 g/dL, and results in 
increased demineralisation of osseous tissues that can manifest as rickets or 
osteomalacia in children and adults respectively (Alasia, 2010; Chisholm Jr. et al., 
1955; Logham-Adham, 1997). 
The most characteristic skeletal manifestations of rickets are pathological bowing of 
long bones (see Fig. 4.4). Porosity, fraying and flaring of metaphyses, especially of the 
long bones and sternal rib-ends are common pathological alterations associated with 
rickets (Lewis, 2017, p. 210; Waldron, 2009, p. 129). Abnormal porosity on the cranium 
(cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis) and mandibular ramus deformities are also 
commonly seen in rachitic skeletons (Brickley et al., 2005, 2018; Mays et al., 2006; 
Ortner and Mays, 1998; Swinson et al., 2010; Watts and Valme, 2018) Although the 
skeletal manifestations of rickets are varied and can have numerous causes, the co-
occurrence of multiple pathological alterations provides strong support for a diagnosis 
of rickets.

4.4.5 Scurvy 
Scurvy is a nutritional deficiency disease resulting from a lack of dietary vitamin C 
(ascorbic acid). This deficiency impedes the activity of proline hydroxylase (a vitamin 
C dependent enzyme), an enzyme important to the hydroxylation process involved in 
collagen synthesis. This results in the production of weakened collagen structures that 
culminates in defective, reduced or arrested osteoid formation and fragile blood vessels 
prone to haemorrhage (Ortner et al., 2001). Like proline hydroxylase, lysyl oxidase (a 
copper dependent enzyme) is responsible for creating stabilising cross-links between 
lysine and hydroxyproline amino acids in collagen fibrils (Dollwet and Sorenson, 1988). 
Reduced activity of this enzyme results in the synthesis of weakened collagen. The 
manifestations of copper deficiency has been termed pseudo scurvy due to its 
similarities with the scorbutic disease (Hoyle et al., 1999; Hurwitz et al., 2004; Nguyen 
IMAGE

REASONS 
and Kerner, Jr., 2007). Lead is a copper antagonist, and therefore inhibits the activity of 
copper dependent enzymes, mimicking a copper deficiency in individuals suffering 
from lead poisoning. Cases of lead-induced scurvy or pseudo scurvy are documented in 
the clinical literature (Ramel and Schenk, 1942).  
The pathological skeletal alterations associated with a copper deficiency are the same as 
those associated with scurvy, as both disorders result in weakened collagen prone to 
tearing (Allen et al., 1982). The skeletal manifestations of scurvy are subtle and 
common to many other disease processes, added to this the often fragmentary nature of 
archaeological remains makes assigning a definitive diagnosis of the disease difficult 
(Armelagos et al., 2014; Geber and Murphy, 2012). Thus, it is distinctive lesions 
described in works such as the Ortner Criteria that prove vital to the successful 
identification of scorbutic skeletal remains (Crandall and Klaus, 2014; Zuckerman et al., 
2014). These lesions primarily consist of porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia and 
abnormal porosity (often with periosteal new bone formation) on the scapulae, long 
bone metaphyses, and mandible (see Fig. 4.5) (Brickley and Ives, 2006; Klaus, 2017; 
Moore and Koon, 2017; Ortner, 2003; Resnick and Niwayama, 1988; Stark, 2014). 
These lesions also tend to manifest bilaterally and are thought to be caused by chronic, 
low-grade haemorrhage of weakened blood vessels, predominantly at muscle 
attachment sites, which stimulates an inflammatory response (Ortner et al., 2001, 1999; 
Ortner and Ericksen, 1997).

4.4.6 Gout 
Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterised by the deposition of monosodium 
urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. Although any joint can be affected, the first 
metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe) is usually the primary site of inflammation (Dalbeth 
et al., 2016).  Lead toxicity can cause secondary gout known as saturnine gout, due to 
lead-induced hyperuricemia, which is the primary cause of gout (Akin et al., 2015; 
Baki et al., 2016; Brewster and Perazella, 2004; Dalvi and Pillinger, 2013). The Romans 
were notorious for their consumption of wine sweetened with defrutum and sapa (lead 
acetate), which likely led to the development of gout amongst those who drank 
considerable amounts of wine. It has been estimated that members of the Roman 
aristocracy drank upwards of 2 litres of wine a day, containing lead concentrations in 
the region of 90 g/L (Nriagu, 1983b). However, there was a preference to drink the 
wine diluted (Guy, 1981), which would have likely reduced the amount of lead ingested

REASONS 
via wine consumption. In their bioarchaeological review of health in prehistoric and 
historic Britain, Roberts and Cox, (2003, p. 389) note that gout first appeared in Britain 
during the Roman period. Although the change in diet that came with the Roman 
occupation of Britain likely influenced the prevalence of the disease, the consumption 
of lead-sweetened wine may have also been a contributing factor to the emergence of 
gout during this time. 
Lead poisoning was first linked to gout in the 18th century with the import of Portuguese 
Port and Madeira wine sweetened with lead acetate (Green, 1985). Chemical analysis of 
these wines revealed their high lead content, with concentrations ranging between 320  
1900 g/L (Halla and Ball, 1982). By the 19th century a firm link had been established 
between lead poisoning and gout, with fortified wines implicated as the primary source 
of intoxication (Healey, 1975; Porter and Rousseau, 2000; Storey, 2001). 
 no truth in medicine is better established than the fact that the use of 
fermented  liquors is the most powerful of all the predisposing causes 
of gout.   
 Alfred Baring Garrod, (1859)  
The skeletal manifestations of gout are primarily those of an erosive arthropathy, and 
tend to involve the head of the first metatarsal (see Fig. 4.6). Features that support a 
diagnosis of gout is a punched out and undercut appearance to the lesion, manifestation 
in a para-articular position and extension onto the bone diaphysis (Resnick and 
Niwayama, 1988). Unfortunately, the reliance upon the presence of para-articular lesions 
to diagnose gout means that only cases severe enough to cause erosive tophaceous 
deposits can be identified palaeopathologocally (Swinson et al., 2010).

para-articular surface of the first metatarsal, indicative of gout (Source: BARC) 
4.4.7 Lead lines 
Lead lines are the only skeletal lesion specifically associated with lead poisoning. They 
are visible on radiographs and present as dense transverse bands in the metaphyses of 
long bones and along the margins of flat bones, such as the iliac crest (see Fig. 4.7). A 
common misconception is that these lead lines represent areas of lead deposition in the 
cancellous bone (Papanikolaou et al., 2005). However, studies have demonstrated that 
there are no significant increases in lead concentrations in these areas (Papanikolaou et 
al., 2005; Patrick, 2006). The increased density is actually attributable to an increase in 
calcium deposition in these areas. Lead inhibits osteoclastic activity in zones of 
provisional calcification, causing increased calcium deposition in the areas which 
present as dense bands in radiographs (Chew, 2012). These dense bands of bone are 
best visualised in bone where areas of rapid growth occur, such as the proximal tibia or 
distal radius (Chew, 2012, p. 293; Woolf et al., 1990).

4.5 Lead body burden   
The term lead burden refers to the total amount or concentration of lead contained 
within the human body, and represents the difference between absolute lifetime 
cumulative absorption and aggregated excretion (Landrigan and Todd, 1994). However, 
as lead is heterogeneously distributed in various bodily tissues that differ in both their 
capacity and accessibility for lead accumulation, the assessment of total lead burden is 
not straightforward. 
4.5.1 Estimating lead body burden 
Clinical studies dominate the literature on lead burdens and health. Studies into the 
effectiveness of different tissues for estimating lead body burdens focus on living 
patients. Therefore methods tend to use minimally invasive and easily collectable 
sample types such as blood, urine, saliva, hair, and nails (Barbosa Jr et al., 2005).

Although occasionally hair and nails can survive in the burial environment, especially if 
the remains are mummified, in archaeological contexts the majority of surviving 
material is the mineralized tissues. Therefore, this section will focus on the use of bones 
and teeth in the estimation of lead body burdens.  
4.5.1.1 Bones 
One of the most striking aspects of lead in the human body is its predilection for 
bioaccumulation in osseous tissues, with approximately 90-95% of the bodies lead 
burden stored in the skeleton (Berman, 1966; Raj, 2010). Within the skeleton, lead is 
not homogenously distributed. There are considerable variations in the concentration of 
lead between different skeletal elements and even between different types of bone 
(Aufderheide, 1989; Barry, 1978; Drasch, 1982; Erkkil et al., 1992). Cortical bone has 
a slower turnover rate than cancellous bone. Therefore, skeletal elements comprised 
predominantly of cancellous bone (e.g. patellae and calcanei) contain a higher amount 
of biologically available lead than skeletal elements comprised predominantly of 
cortical bone (e.g. tibiae and phalanges) (Ambrose et al., 2000; Fleming et al., 1999; 
OFlaherty, 1995; Roy et al., 1997; Tsaih et al., 1999). This non-uniform distribution of 
lead within bones appears to be governed by the volume of blood delivered to the bone. 
A study by Todd et al., (2001) reported that regions of lower lead concentration 
contained a lower percentage of cancellous bone and a higher percentage of cortical 
bone than regions exhibiting high lead concentrations. It is suggested that the larger 
surface area, higher volume of blood flow to Haversian canals and a higher 
concentration of active osteons in cancellous bone facilitates a higher rate of lead 
incorporation into the bone matrix than cortical bone (Todd et al., 2001). Although the 
residency time of lead in bone is estimated to be between 15-30 years (Rabinowitz et al., 
1991), the dynamic nature of bone results in the release of previously incorporated lead 
and the incorporation of new lead. This results in lead isotope ratios and lead 
concentrations that gradually alter over time as bone turnover proceeds (Priest and Van 
de Vyver, 1990).  
4.5.1.2 Teeth 
The proclivity lead exhibits for mineralised tissues means that in addition to bone, lead 
also accumulates in the dentition. However, the way in which lead is acquired and 
retained in different tooth portions (e.g. enamel, dentine etc.) means that teeth provide a 
means of reconstructing an individuals exposure history (Budd et al., 1998). Lead is 
incorporated into enamel matrices during the mineralisation of the tissue. As enamel 
does not remodel or have an active blood supply, its lead composition is considered a 
reliable indicator of lead exposure at the time of enamel mineralisation (Brudevold et al., 
1977; Gulson, 1996; Gulson and Wilson, 1994; Veis, 1989; Wieser et al., 1996). 
Conversely, lead in dentine is known to be more dynamic, continuously accumulating 
lead from its blood supply (Gulson, 2008; Shapiro et al., 1975). This is corroborated by 
a study carried out by Gulson et al. (1997a) in which lead concentrations and lead 
isotope ratios in paired dentine and enamel samples from European immigrants to 
Australia were analysed. The results showed that there was no change to the lead in 
enamel, while lead in the dentine samples taken from the apical section of permanent 
tooth roots slowly altered to reflect the isotopic composition of the new environment, 
with an exchange rate of approximately 1  0.3 % per year (Gulson et al., 1997a; 
Gulson, 2008). As such, the lead contained within dentine can be considered an 
averaged representation of lifetime accumulation (Budd et al., 1998). This temporal 
difference in lead acquisition between enamel and dentine potentially facilitates the 
comparison of lifetime changes in lead exposure (e.g. childhood vs. adulthood). 
4.5.2 Dynamic lead burdens 
Lead burdens are far from static; they are influenced by both exogenous and 
endogenous factors and thus are prone to fluctuation. Living and working in less 
polluted, usually rural environments with little industrial activity will result in lower 
lead burdens. Conversely, living in more heavily polluted environment such as urban, 
industrial areas poses a much greater exposure risk. As expected, exposure to higher 
concentrations of lead in an individuals home or occupational environment will 
increase lead burdens. Exogenous factors such as these are the most obvious variables 
that directly influence individuals lead burdens. However, even remaining in the same 
environment with a consistent level of pollution does not ensure a stable lead burden, as 
endogenous factors also play a significant role in lead burden fluctuations.  
Factors that influence an individuals physiological equilibrium, such as disease, 
pregnancy, lactation and menopause, have all been shown to alter lead burdens (Cory-
Slechta, 1996; Gulson et al., 2003a; Silbergeld, 1991; Silbergeld et al., 1988; Symanski 
and Hertz-Picciotto, 1995). This is, in the most part, due to the remobilisation of lead 
that has been sequestered in mineralised tissues. While it was thought that this lead was 
stored indefinitely within mineral matrices, subsequent studies have shown that 
physiological stress, which can influence bone turnover rates, results in the release or 
remobilisation of this stored lead (Gulson et al., 2004, 2003, 1999, 1997; Spivey, 2007). 
The repercussions of this remobilisation of endogenous lead is particularly significant 
for pregnant and breastfeeding women as the toxic effects of lead are most potent in 
developing foetuses and young children.  
Some types of physiological stress can create a higher demand for calcium (Clarke, 
2008; Kovacs, 2015; Ross et al., 2011), and this increased demand has been shown to 
have a significant effect on blood lead levels. It has been suggested that this is because 
the resorption rate of skeletal tissues increases to release the needed calcium in 
individuals with an inadequate dietary intake (Gulson et al., 1997; 2004, 2003). Bone 
turnover of this nature has been shown to be most prolific in pregnant and breastfeeding 
women (Gulson et al., 2016), and is likely due to calcium requirements increasing from 
1000 mg to 1300 mg/day during gestation and lactation (Prentice, 2000). A study by 
Gulson et al., (2004) demonstrated that the isotopic composition of maternal blood lead 
was identical to foetal cord blood, thereby confirming that there is placental transfer of 
lead during pregnancy. Numerous studies have also shown a strong correlation between 
maternal and foetal blood lead concentrations (Furman and Laleli, 2001; Klein et al., 
1994; Moura and Valente, 2002; Navarrete-Espinosa et al., 2000; Wan et al., 1996), 
with an estimated 79% of maternal blood lead transferred to the foetus (Gulson et al., 
2003). Other studies have also demonstrated that lead is transferred through breast milk 
(Rabinowitz et al., 1985; Ettinges et al., 2004), with this sourcecontributing to between 
36  80% of an infants blood lead level (Gulson et al., 1998). 
Using the same mixing relationship as applied in isotopic geochemistry, Gulson et al., 
(2003) showed that this increase in blood lead concentration is derived predominantly 
from bone lead stores. By determining the isotopic composition of blood lead before, 
during and after pregnancy in migrants to Australia, Gulson et al. demonstrated that 
between 41%  73% (mean 31%) of the lead responsible for this increase was 
remobilised bone lead (Gulson et al., 1997b; Gulson et al., 1998, 1995). Supporting 
evidence for the remobilisation of lead from bone during pregnancy has also been 
demonstrated in studies examining pregnant women from different populations across 
the world (Gulson et al., 1997b, 1999; Klein et al., 1994; Lagerkvist et al., 1996; 
Rothenberg et al., 1994, 2000). These studies all reported that blood lead concentrations 
increased on average by ~20% during pregnancy. Gulson et al., (1998) also showed that 
these concentrations were even higher in postnatal mothers. Lactation has been posited 
as the cause for this post pregnancy increase, as it increases the bodies calcium 
requirements. As such, if the mothers calcium intake and absorption rates fall short of 
the physiological need, bone resorption and the subsequent release of calcium is the 
likely mechanism responsible, in an attempt to correct the deficit (Gulson et al., 1998). 
The breastfeeding and dietary intake histories collected during Gulson et als., (1998) 
study seems to corroborate this hypothesis. Their findings showed that women that 
breastfed for longer, and therefore experienced prolonged physiological stress relative 
to the other participants, had the highest blood lead concentrations. While women 
taking calcium supplements, and therefore ensured the recommended daily requirement 
intake, exhibited the lowest blood lead concentrations. This has been corroborated in 
other studies that have also reported the protective qualities of calcium against increased 
lead levels during pregnancy (Farias et al., 1996; Hernandez-Avila et al., 1996; Johnson, 
2001; Moura and Valente, 2002). 
This predisposition of pregnant women and new mothers to higher than normal lead 
burdens, may offer insights into the high infant mortality rates or failure to thrive seen 
in past populations. Especially those that have been shown to have high levels of 
environmental pollution, as lead levels as low as 5 g/dL have been shown to increase 
the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, low birth weight and stillbirths  
(Borja-Aburto et al., 1999; Edwards, 2013; Flora et al., 2012; Gilfillan, 1965; Hamilton 
and Hardy, 1974; Troesken, 2008; Zhu et al., 2010). Further implications of these 
dynamic lead burdens, in an archaeological context, are the uncertainties it creates 
surrounding the type (chronic vs. acute) and duration of exposure. Especially when 
attempting to infer the impact of lead on health from a single bone or dentine 
measurement. Enamel lead concentrations may provide a way forward in this respect, as 
enamel lead concentrations do not alter once mineralisation of the tissue is complete and 
therefore reflect an averaged exposure for a fixed period of time.  
4.5.3 Estimating blood to mineral lead ratios  
The nature of archaeological remains limits the assessment of lead burdens to the 
measurement of lead concentrations in mineralised (skeletal and dental) tissues. Lead 
sequestered within these mineralised tissues can be considered inert because of its 
inability to interfere with biochemical processes in soft tissues. As such, lead within 
mineralised tissues does not directly reflect the lead burden responsible for causing the 
disease processes associated with lead toxicity. It is therefore important to understand 
how the lead levels observed in mineralised tissues reflect the amount of lead that 
would have been circulating within blood and soft tissues. 
Clinical literature pertaining to lead poisoning is centred on measurements of blood lead 
concentrations, with few studies exploring how blood lead concentrations relate to lead 
concentrations within teeth or bones. Thus, archaeological inferences about lead 
poisoning are difficult, as the accuracy of the extrapolated effects of blood lead 
concentrations to those in mineralised tissues is poorly understood. Studies that have 
explored this relationship have done so using different portions of exfoliated deciduous 
teeth, and blood collected at different periods in the individuals life, making results 
difficult to interpret as the samples used (blood, dentine, enamel etc.) relate to different 
periods of life. As lead stored in tooth enamel represents the lead sequestered during a 
definable period of time (during mineralisation), only studies that include blood samples 
collected during this period of mineralisation offer any insight into the blood lead to 
enamel lead relationship. Determining this in bone samples is much harder as lead in 
bone does not simply accumulate over time, becoming stored within the mineral matrix 
indefinitely. Instead bone lead concentrations fluctuate; sequestering and releasing lead 
at different rates depending on an individuals age and physiological status (see section 
4.5). As lead from enamel samples is used in this study only the relationship between 
blood lead concentrations and teeth will be considered further. 
Few studies have examined how childhood tooth lead concentrations correlate with the 
lead concentrations in blood, and those that have, reveal a complex and poorly 
understood relationship (Rabinowitz et al., 1993).  Despite this, a small number of 
studies on modern populations have reported a correlation between enamel lead 
concentrations (taken using acid etch biopsies) and blood lead concentrations that were 
collected during the period of tooth mineralisation (Brudevold et al., 1977; Cleymaet et 
al., 1991; Robbins et al., 2010). However, the lead concentrations within tooth enamel 
are not homogenously distributed. Polido Kaneshiro Olympoi et al., (2010) 
demonstrated that lead concentration in two samples taken from the same tooth, but at 
depths that differed by 0.5 m, showed a 50% decrease in lead concentration in the 
deeper layer of enamel. Several studies have demonstrated that lead concentrations 
decrease sharply as sampling moves away from surface enamel towards core enamel 
samples (Budd et al., 1998; Fergusson and Purchase, 1987; Purchase and Fergusson, 
1986; Robbins et al., 2010). This is important to consider when interpreting lead 
burdens in archaeological remains as it is unclear whether this concentration gradient 
within tooth enamel is derived from endogenous processes (during mineralisation), 
exogenous interactions with surface enamel, or indeed a mixture of both. As such, core 
enamel is the preferential sample type when assessing lead concentrations in 
archaeological human remains, as it not only ensures contamination from the burial 
environment is minimal but also removes the surface enamel variable and ensures all 
measurements represent lead burdens derived from blood lead.  
One of the few studies that goes further than simply reporting a correlation between 
blood lead and enamel lead levels was conducted by Grobler et al., (2000). In this study 
lead concentrations in enamel, dentine, circumpulpal dentine and blood samples from 
48 South African children were determined. Median concentrations were then expressed 
as ratios to blood lead. The results show that mineralised tissues all contained higher 
lead concentrations than blood, with an enamel to blood lead ratio of 10:1. If this is an 
accurate representation of the concentration difference between tooth enamel and 
contemporary blood samples then reducing the lead concentrations recorded in 
archaeological enamel samples by a factor of 10 should provide approximate blood lead 
levels and allow comparison with clinical literature pertaining to lead poisoning. 
4.6 Evidence of lead poisoning in the Roman Empire  
4.6.1 Lead poisoning in antiquity 
The earliest known documentation alluding to the toxicity of lead is found in ancient 
Egyptian papyrus scrolls, in which the potential use of lead as a murderous toxin is 
referenced (Hernberg, 2000; Lessler, 1988). It is therefore apparent that humans have 
been aware of lead and its diverse applications, as well as its inherent toxicity for 
millennia.  With the large quantities of lead mined and utilised throughout the Roman 
Empire it is unsurprising that there is historical evidence for lead poisoning in Roman 
populations and bioarchaeological evidence of toxically high lead body burdens. 
Although the Romans were generally unaware of the exact aetiology that underpinned 
many of the afflictions they described, today we recognise the symptoms outlined in 
these ancient texts as indicative of lead poisoning. 
The Greek physician Hippocrates may well have been the first to describe the effects of 
lead poisoning in his 3rd century BC account of intestinal colic and recognition of the 
relationship between gout and wine consumption. However, it is the 2nd century BC 
poet and physician Nicander of Colophon who is widely credited as being the first 
scholar to describe lead poisoning through his description of lead-induced palsy and 
anaemia (Lessler, 1988; Needleman, 2009; Waldron, 1973). Indeed, even authors such 
as Dioscordes (De Materia Metica), Vitruvius (De Architectura viii.6.10 and 11) and 
Pliny the Elder (Historia Naturalis xxxiv.50.167) recognised the risks associated with 
ingesting lead (F. P. Retief and Cilliers, 2006). The following translation from Pliny the 
Elders work Historia Naturalis demonstrates the known dangers of drinking wine 
adulterated with lead sweeteners and the commonality with which it was done. The 
description, dangling, paralytic wrists is clearly a reference to what is today known as 
wrist drop or radial nerve palsy, in which paralysis of the extensor muscles in the 
upper limbs inhibits the extension of the arm and wrist.  
 genuine, unadulterated wine is not to be had now, not even by 
nobility  From the excessive use of such wines arise dangling, paralytic 
hands. 
  Pliny the Elder 
It is evident that lead, whether ingested intentionally (e.g. sapa) or unwittingly (e.g. 
contamination from water pipes), was highly accessible to everyone within the Roman 
Empire. Scholars have therefore claimed that lead poisoning must have been a common, 
even endemic affliction throughout the Empire. Despite this, lead poisoning is poorly 
documented in Roman texts (Hernberg, 2000). However, this has not deterred some 
scholars from suggesting that lead poisoning was responsible for the preponderance of 
stillbirths, deformities and cases of brain damage in Roman infants (Gilfillan, 1965; 
Nriagu, 1983; Woolley, 1984); some even go as far as to hypothesise that lead 
poisoning played an important role in the eventual downfall of the Roman Empire 
(Gilfillan, 1990; Nriagu, 1983). This viewpoint has been vehemently opposed by a 
number of authors, who see the impact of anthropogenic lead pollution during the 
Roman period as much less significant (Drasch, 1982; Gaebel, 1983; Needleman and 
Needleman, 1985; Scarborough, 1984).  
4.6.2 Assessing lead poisoning in archaeological remains 
With a shortage of surviving literary evidence to support or indeed refute the degree to 
which lead impacted upon the morbidity and mortality of Roman populations, attention 
must be directed to the skeletal remains from the period. Human skeletal remains offer a 
direct link to the past, providing a rich source of information pertaining to the lives and 
living conditions of past populations (Scott, 2013). However, a shortage of literature 
exists here too. Despite the known toxic effects of lead, and the unprecedentedly high 
lead concentrations seen in Roman skeletal material, little bioarchaeological research 
has been conducted to investigate how lead burdens may have impacted upon health 
throughout the empire. This makes it difficult to establish how the Romans profuse use 
of lead impacted upon the lives of people within the Roman Empire, and how this may 
have differed according to geographic and socio-cultural variations. In fact, there are 
very few examples of bioarchaeological investigations that explore lead poisoning in 
skeletal populations from any time period. Those that have, simply compared skeletal 
lead concentrations with the lead concentrations reported in clinical literature (Griffin, 
2015; Facchini et al., 2004; Waldron et al., 1982). This is problematic as the majority of 
clinical studies use blood to calculate lead burdens, forcing comparisons between 
different sample types. Therefore, while identifying exposure to high lead 
concentrations is relatively simple within bioarchaeological contexts, determining how 
these high concentrations relate to morbidity and mortality has proven to be much more 
challenging. 
Some of the first bioarchaeological investigations into the lead burdens of past 
populations were conducted in the late 1970s. The Romano-British sites at Poundbury 
Camp, Dorset and Trentholme Drive, York recorded, unprecedentedly high bone lead 
concentrations in the skeletal material recovered there (Mackie et al., 1975; Waldron et 
al., 1976; Whittaker and Stack, 1984). While little attempt was made to link these high 
concentrations with lead poisoning, the exceptionally high lead concentrations in the 
foetal remains were suggested as possible cause of death for the infants as high lead 
levels can induce spontaneous abortion and stillbirth (Waldron et al., 1979b).  In these 
studies all lead concentrations were obtained from bone samples, and while there were 
no correlations in lead concentrations between the bone soil samples collected at the 
sites, the authors acknowledged that the porous nature of the samples (particularly the 
higher porosity of the foetal remains) used may have facilitated some degree of ion 
exchange in the burial environment (Molleson et al., 1986; Waldron et al., 1976; 
Waldron et al., 1979b).  
The Franklin expedition is probably one of the most recognised examples of 
bioarchaeological investigations into lead poisoning to date. Bioarchaeological analysis 
of the frozen remains of known crew members, William Braine, John Hartnell and John 
Torrington, discovered on Bleechey Island (Amy et al., 1986; Beattie and Geiger, 2017; 
Notman et al., 1987) and the disarticulated remains of at least 20 individuals on King 
William Island (Beattie, 1983; Beattie and Savelle, 1983; Keenleyside et al., 1997) were 
conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Using bone and hair samples these studies found 
lead concentrations ranging from 49 ppm to 204 ppm (mean 103 ppm). These results 
were interpreted as evidence for lead poisoning among the crew as they were equal to or 
greater than those recorded in modern clinical literature documenting lead poisoning 
(Keenleyside et al., 1996; Kowal et al., 1991). From the analysis of these remains it was 
posited that lead poisoning was a major contributing factor to the 19th-century disaster, 
with improperly soldered canned goods suggested as a significant contributor to the 
toxic lead burdens observed (Beattie, 1985; Kowal et al., 1991, 1989). Several scholars 
have challenged this hypothesis, suggesting that contamination of food from solder 
occurs at such low concentrations that it would not be significantly detrimental to health 
(Farrer, 1993, 1989; Trafton, 1989). These studies conclude that while the observed lead 
concentrations were undoubtedly high, the long residency time of lead in bone together 
with the high 19th-century baseline lead burdens, instil significant uncertainty 
surrounding how long the lead had been in the bone and how much of it was acquired 
during the expedition (Farrer, 1993, 1989; Trafton, 1989). 
A more recent study by Millard et al. (2014) analysed the lead concentrations in 18th  
19th century London populations in an attempt to correlate the high lead burdens 
associated with post-medieval populations with evidence of disease and infertility. This 
study found tooth enamel lead concentrations ranging from 0.47 ppm to 99.2 ppm 
(mean 22.22 ppm). These results demonstrate high levels of pollutant exposure, with 
lead concentrations peaking at values three times higher than those recorded in Roman 
skeletal material (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2010). Using the Stuart-
Macadam (1991) scoring system, the presence and severity of cribra orbitalia was used 
as an indicator of anaemia. Surprisingly, despite the plethora of clinical literature 
discussing the almost diagnostic quality of anaemia in relation to lead poisoning, 
Millard et al. (2014) found no significant correlation between cribra orbitalia score and 
lead concentrations. However, this may be related more to the uncertainty surrounding 
the exact aetiology of cribra orbitalia than the possibility of successfully correlating 
skeletal lesions with elevated lead concentrations. In addition to this, Millard et al., 
(2014) also compared childhood lead concentrations accumulated between the ages of 
2.5 to 6.5 years, with pathological lesions on adult skeletal remains. This may have 
contributed to the difficulty in establishing how lead impacted upon health as, while a 
specific period of accumulation can be assigned to the lead concentrations used, the 
same cannot be done for the pathological lesions, which could have developed during 
any time prior to death. 
What these studies demonstrate is the difficultly with single lead concentration 
measurements for determining the presence of lead poisoning. Thus, other evidence 
should be sought in conjunction with lead concentrations. A logical starting point here 
would be the inclusion of skeletal evidence of disease, specifically those known to be 
associated with lead poisoning, (see section 4.4). As such, this research will combine 
trace element analysis with palaeopathological data from Roman skeletal remains to 
contribute to our understanding of the impact anthropogenic lead pollution on the health 
of populations throughout the Roman Empire. This process is not without its own 
obstacles, the majority of which stem from the dynamic nature of living bone and the 
elements stored within it. As a living tissue, bone undergoes modelling (new bone 
formation) and remodelling (replacement of weakened bone) throughout life, and this 
continuous turnover alters the lead profile of skeletal tissues. Consequently, a single 
bone lead measurement does not provide an accurate representation of the lead burden 
experienced by an individual. Due to this dynamic relationship, the analysis of bone 
lead cannot currently differentiate between a period of acute high-level lead exposure 
that would have resulted in lead-induced pathologies or an extended period of low-level 
exposure resulting in a high, cumulative lead burden that is likely to have remained 
asymptomatic (Montgomery et al., 2010). This makes the assessment of lead poisoning 
in archaeological populations problematic, as discerning the type of exposure bone lead 
concentrations represent, and how they relate to observable palaeopathological lesions 
is problematic.  
An alternative indicator of lead burdens, that would eliminate a number of variables that 
make bone lead concentrations so dynamic, is tooth enamel. However, this would limit 
bioarchaeological investigations to non-adult exposure. As previously discussed in 
section 4.5, lead is incorporated into core tooth enamel as the tissue mineralises during 
childhood and it does not accumulate lead thereafter. This effectively provides a 
snapshot of an individuals lead exposure within a definable period of time during an 
individuals life, and allows the comparison of lead exposure at specific ages between 
individuals that died at different ages. Additionally tooth enamel lead concentrations are 
generally unaffected by many of the age and health related factors that influence the 
incorporation of lead into bone mineral. Therefore, the paired analysis of tooth enamel 
lead concentrations with the palaeopathological lesions on non-adult skeletal remains 
facilitates the comparison of childhood lead burdens with disease processes that 
occurred at a similar time to lead acquisition. This gives the best chronological 
correlation between lead concentrations and their contribution to the manifestation of 
certain pathological lesions. 
4.7 Summary   
The World Health Organisation recently reported that there is no known safe blood 
lead concentration (WHO, 2011), stating that lead is toxic even at sub-clinical levels 
under 5 g/L and it would appear that for as long as people have been utilising lead, 
they have been aware of its pernicious qualities. The Romans were no exception, with 
historical documents clearly detailing maladies associated with lead poisoning and 
references to the dangers of its ubiquitous use. The bone seeking quality of lead lends 
itself to archaeological studies into how environmental pollution impacted upon health. 
However, the small numbers of bioarchaeological studies that have attempted to 
identify lead poisoning in archaeological remains have had some difficulty in 
determining what constitutes in vivo lead concentrations and what has been acquired 
from the burial environment. The limitations identified by these early studies can help 
shape the way future works approach the problem. It is clear that the use of bone, an 
innately porous material, is unlikely to yield accurate results as it readily exchanges ions 
with its burial environment. Therefore tooth enamel, which is a much more 
diagenetically stable tissue, would provide a better sample medium.  
While all of the mechanisms behind leads biochemical interactions are not fully 
understood it is clear that lead poisoning can result in the manifestation of numerous 
metabolic disorders. As some metabolic diseases are identifiable on skeletal remains 
there is a real potential for the identification of individuals suffering from lead 
poisoning in archaeological populations. The paired analysis of palaeopathological and 
tooth enamel lead concentration data provides the most robust strategy when attempting 
to identify individuals that suffered from lead poisoning. This does however, restrict 
bioarchaeological studies of lead poisoning to childhood as this is when both datasets 
are most likely to overlap with the time of lead exposure.  
CHAPTER FIVE 
Roman Health and Mortality 
5.1 Introduction  
Due to the continuous movement of people and conquest of new lands, living in the 
Roman Empire meant living in a world of change and diversity, and this included 
changes to the health and mortality of the population (Redfern et al., 2018). Numerous 
studies have shown how changes to living environments (urbanisation), diet and 
population diversity can negatively impact upon health (Larsen and Milner, 1994). The 
high infant mortality rates and increased prevalence of infectious and metabolic diseases 
evident in skeletal material demonstrates how the Roman Empire was no exception. 
This chapter provides a brief overview of health and childhood mortality within 
the Roman world. Important parallels are drawn between the emergence of 
diseases known to be associated with lead poisoning and the dramatic increase in 
lead pollution seen during this period, and the concept that lead poisoning may 
have contributed to the high infant mortality rates evident throughout the Roman 
Empire is also introduced. 
5.2 Roman health 
Historical evidence for health and disease within the Roman Empire is relatively scarce, 
and is largely anecdotal, focusing predominantly on Mediterranean provinces such as 
Italy (Pitts and Griffin, 2012). However, there appears to be a general consensus that 
urbanisation, ethnicity and inequalities in wealth and social status were important 
factors influencing the health of populations throughout the Empire (LaVeist and Isaac, 
2012). Although some studies have shown that living in rural environments came with 
its own negative effects on health (Lewis, 2010; Rohnbogner, 2017; Rohnbogner and 
Lewis, 2017), it was urban living that proved more deleterious to health (Redfern et al., 
2015). The development of road networks and overcrowding that came with Roman 
urbanisation likely facilitated the easy transmission of disease within and between 
communities (Roberts and Cox, 2003, p. 389). Urban centres had close living quarters, 
inadequate waste disposal infrastructures, increased exposure to migrants and higher 
levels of smoke and lead pollution (Morley, 2004; Roberts and Cox, 2003, p. 389; 
Scobie, 1986). These characteristics of urban living likely influenced the high 
prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis in towns and cities 
compared with life in the Empires rural settlements (Griffin et al., 2011; Morley, 2002; 
Redfern and Roberts, 2005; Redfern et al., 2015; Sallares, 2002; Scheidel, 2003). Even 
Roman culture often promoted the benefits of rural living, suggesting that people at the 
time were aware of the disparity in health associated with urban versus rural living 
(Baker, 2018; Eaton, 2014, p. 89). However, the impact of these variables on health 
cannot be fully understood solely from documentary evidence, which tends to be biased 
towards those of high status and social influence. Here osteological evidence of disease 
provides useful insights into the wellbeing of wider Roman populations (Gowland, 
2017).  
A number of studies have explored the health of Roman populations through the 
analysis of skeletal remains. The majority of these studies have been conducted on 
British and Italian populations (Bonfiglioli et al., 2003; Bonsall, 2013; Cucina et al., 
2006; FitzGerald et al., 2006; Gowland and Redfern, 2010; Minozzi et al., 2012; 
Redfern, 2008; Redfern et al., 2015; Rohnbogner, 2017; Rohnbogner and Lewis, 2017), 
and very few of these have directly compared urban and rural populations with 
contemporaneous sites from other regions of the Empire. Although relatively few in 
number, these bioarchaeological studies concur with textual sources, demonstrating that 
there are higher levels of disease and childhood mortality at urban locations (Jongman 
et al., 2019; Redfern and Roberts, 2005). Despite the increasing wealth of evidence 
supporting the notion of poorer health in urban environments not all studies have 
observed the same pattern. In their analysis of four 4th century AD sites in Croatia, 
laus et al. (2004) found no difference in health between settlement types, indicating 
that there is local variability in the impact that socioeconomic factors have upon health 
throughout the Roman Empire. In Romano-British contexts, a comparison of the urban 
site of Poundbury Camp, Dorset with contemporaneous rural sites also found that rural 
poverty affected the health of those growing up in the countryside to a similar extent as 
living in urban environments affected city dwellers (Rohnbogner and Lewis, 2017). 
From their analysis of British and Italian populations, Gowland and Redfern (2010) 
point out that Roman health patterns are complex, not simply a function of toxic 
environments, and that local variability in weaning practices, migration levels and living 
environments play an important role in the health of a population.  
Using the presence or absence of grave goods to infer the socioeconomic status of 
individuals a number of studies have also attempted to correlate poor health with 
socioeconomic status. Jenny (2011) found more non-adults buried with grave goods had 
skeletal markers of stress than non-adults buried in unfurnished graves, Griffin et al 
(2011) found the same correlation at Baldock, Hertfordshire. Conversely, Redfern and 
DeWitte (2011) found that higher status individuals had lower mortality risks than 
lower status groups. However, as Gowland (2016) states, the interpretation of an 
individuals or populations health status is not straightforward and it is important not to 
over simplify any correlations made between osteological evidence of poor health and 
perceived indicators of status from the burial environment.   
It is clear that the factors affecting Roman health across the Empire were multifarious, 
and the extent of local variations in health and their relationship with socioeconomic 
inequality in this period requires further investigation. However, an avenue of research 
that has been relatively overlooked in Roman health studies is the impact that 
environmental lead pollution had upon populations adapting to Roman rule. From 
studies examining differences in health during the late Iron Age and Roman period in 
Britain it is apparent that the changes that came with Roman occupation had a generally 
negative impact upon health (Redfern, 2008; Roberts and Cox, 2003). The majority of 
these changes have interesting parallels with pathological alterations consistent with 
lead poisoning (see Chapter 4). As environmental lead pollution increased during the 
Roman period compared with the Iron Age, there was a concurrent increase in 
prevalence rates of dental disease and osteoporosis (Roberts and Cox, 2003; Touger-
Decker and Van Loveren, 2003b), it was also the first time that metabolic diseases such 
as gout, rickets, osteomalacia and scurvy were seen in British populations (Roberts and 
Cox, 2003). Skeletal evidence from Britain, Italy and Gaul also reveals that there was a 
reduction in average adult stature compared to Iron Age populations (Giannecchini and 
MoggiCecchi, 2008; Gowland, 2017; Gowland and Walther, 2018; Redfern and 
DeWitte, 2011; Roberts and Cox, 2003; Scheidel, 2010b). Significantly, during the 
Anglo-Saxon period, a time when environmental lead pollution and human lead burdens 
decreased (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Settle and Patterson, 1980), 
the average stature of British populations increases alongside a reduction in skeletal 
evidence of these diseases (Gowland, 2017; Roberts and Cox, 2003).  
With regards to childhood health much of attention has been paid to the Romano-British 
site Poundbury Camp, Dorset (Farwell and Molleson, 1993; Lewis, 2010; Molleson, 
1992, 1989; Molleson and Cox, 1988; Redfern, 2007; Redfern et al., 2012; Rohnbogner 
and Lewis, 2017). This site offers a unique opportunity to explore childhood health as 
the site contained an unusually large proportion of non-adult individuals (n = 364, <18 
years of age), 75 of which have been categorised as perinatal infants (Molleson, 1989), 
the age group most susceptible to the deleterious effects of lead. In the initial evaluation 
of the skeletal remains from this site, Molleson (1989) noted that a high proportion of 
the infants exhibited evidence of metabolic disease. A re-evaluation of the site two 
decades later by Lewiss (2010) corroborates these findings, with results indicating that 
over 30% of infants exhibited pathological alterations consistent with rickets (vitamin D 
deficiency) and scurvy (vitamin C deficiency). Although both Molleson (1989) and 
Lewis (2010) suggest that the high prevalence of metabolic disease is a result of early 
weaning, Molleson also goes on to posit that lead contamination of weaning foods and 
water may have contributed to the poor health of this vulnerable group of individuals. 
High rates of infant mortality and metabolic disease is not unique to Poundbury Camp, 
analyses of other Romano-British sites such as Butt Road, Colchester (Crummy and 
Crossan, 1993), Cannington, Somerset (Rahtz et al., 2000), Winchester (Ottaway et al., 
2012) and Mays et als (2018) study of 15 Mediterranean Roman 1st to 6th century sites 
have revealed high numbers of non-adults with evidence of poor health. 
The overarching observation that can be made here is that Roman health was generally 
poor across the Empire, with individuals from all site types affected by metabolic 
diseases and infections (Rohnbogner and Lewis, 2017). Of course no singular cause can 
be ascribed to the decline of Roman health compared with that of previous populations, 
as socioeconomic inequalities, population growth and the implementation of Roman 
hierarchical systems will have all impacted upon a populations health (Gowland, 2017). 
However, there appears to be compelling evidence for the inclusion of environmental 
lead pollution as a contributing factor in the contextualisation of a populations health 
within their sociocultural sphere. 
5.3 Childhood mortality 
Life expectancy during the Roman period has long been an area of interest within 
Roman research, and the basis of much of this interest stems from the wealth of age-at-
death data surviving in the form of inscriptions, census records and skeletal evidence 
(Hope, 2009, p. 42). However, this data is not always reliable or representative of the 
population as a whole. For example, ages inscribed on funerary monuments were not 
always precise and appear to have been either rounded up or down (Hope, 2009, p. 42). 
Additionally infants, children and women tend to be underrepresented epigraphically, 
with a distinct bias towards the commemoration of males in funerary monuments 
(Carroll, 2011). To compensate for the uncertainty surrounding this method, estimating 
life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rates has also been attempted via the 
comparison of Roman populations with modern life tables. These calculations suggest 
that the average life expectancy was 40  50 years of age if adulthood was reached, but 
that the chances of surviving past childhood were low (Hope, 2009, p. 43). However, 
critics of this method argue that life tables overlook important spatial and temporal 
variances in climatic and epidemiological conditions and likely provide an inaccurate 
proxy of Roman demographics (Pilkington, 2013; Scheidel, 2001b).  
Whichever way the demography of Roman populations is assessed, it is clear that child 
mortality was high, with a large proportion of children failing to survive into adulthood 
(Carroll, 2006, p. 176; Garnsey, 1991, p. 51). As mortality is influenced by the living 
environment (urban versus rural) and the socioeconomic status into which a child is 
born, child mortality rates are likely to have varied considerably throughout the Empire 
(Gowland et al., 2014). However, there tends to be a general consensus that up to 50% 
of children died before the age of 10 years, with 20  40% of these dying in their first 
year of life (Carroll, 2014; Harlow and Laurence, 2002, p. 8; Parkin, 1992, p. 92; 
Rawson, 2003, p. 104; Saller, 1997, p. 12). Childbirth was extremely risky for both the 
mother and the infant, resulting in the frequent deaths of both (Jackson, 1988, p. 86), 
and although it will never be possible to determine exactly what percentage Roman 
children died in infancy or early childhood, there is a significant amount of textual 
evidence indicating that a large number died within the first few days of life (Bradley, 
2005, p. 92; Dasen and Spth, 2010; Garnsey, 1991, p. 57; Shaw, 2001, p. 97). For 
example, it is reported that Cornelia, the mother of politicians Tiberius and Gaius 
Gracchus, gave birth to a total of 12 children, of which only three survived into 
adulthood (Hope, 2007, p. 10). Furthermore, texts by Hippocrates and Celsus both note 
that the first and seventh months were the times when an infant was most at risk of 
dying (Adams, 1849), while Plutarch identified the first week as the time in which 
infants were most vulnerable (Rose, 1974). Plutarchs identification of the seventh day 
as the most dangerous for newborns coincides with the deadline for fathers to decide 
whether they were going to rear their child, before the naming day on either the eighth 
(for girls) or ninth day (for boys) after birth (Harlow and Laurence, 2002, p. 39; Rawson, 
2003, p. 105). 
There is no doubt that childhood was a perilous stage of life during the Roman period, 
with higher risk of mortality evidenced by high numbers of infant remains (Gilfillan, 
1965). Some of the reasons put forward for the high infant mortality rates seen 
throughout the Roman Empire include malnutrition, disease, poor medical knowledge 
and infanticide (Gowland et al., 2014; Mays, 1993; Pilkington, 2013). However, it is 
unlikely that there is a singular underlying reason for the high number of infant deaths, 
and rather it is a combination of sociocultural and epidemiological factors (Molleson, 
1989). Nonetheless the high levels of environmental lead pollution seen throughout the 
Empire may have exacerbated the problem (Aneni, 2007). Infants and young children 
are more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults as their developing bodies are prone 
to absorbing higher quantities of ingested lead (see Chapter 4). It has also long been 
known that a mothers lead burden can cross the placental barrier as well as collate in 
breast milk, therefore not only is the developing foetus at risk to succumbing to the 
toxic effects of lead poisoning but so too are breastfeeding infants (Gulson et al., 2003). 
Despite this, and modern documentary evidence of lead poisoning being responsible for 
stillbirths, spontaneous abortion, congenital deformities and metabolic disease in infants 
(HertzPicciotto, 2000; Nriagu, 1983; Wibberley et al., 1977; Woolley, 1984), little 
has been done to explore any link between childhood lead exposure and high infant 
mortality rates within the Roman world.  
5.4 Infanticide and exposure 
Infanticide is defined as the intentional killing of children under the age of 12 months 
(Garner, 2001, p. 442), and historical and ethnographical evidence demonstrates that 
past and present populations have had a long history of this practice (Bonsall, 2013; 
Langer, 1974; Scrimshaw, 1984). In past societies, the practice of infanticide appears to 
have been relatively common, with a multitude of societies on every continent and from 
all levels of cultural complexity openly accepting it with little to no moral stigma (Mays, 
2000; Montague, 1989; Warren, 1985; Williamson, 1978). Although there are a 
multitude of socioeconomic, cultural and religious pressures that can result in increased 
levels of infanticide (Kelly, 1992; Kilday and Watson, 2008; Leboutte, 1991), a 
detachment towards the killing of new-borns is predominantly prevalent in societies that 
do not consider children as fully-fledged social beings (Harlow and Laurence, 2002). 
This view was held by Roman societies who considered childhood to constitute a 
separate stage of a persons life course before transitioning into adulthood (Harlow and 
Laurence, 2002; Hrdy, 1992).  
In part due to the abundance of textual evidence documenting its practice during this 
period, infanticide has received a lot of scholarly attention (Bennett, 1923; Engels, 
1980; Harris, 1994). Infanticide was thought to have been permitted by Roman law, 
however, the interpretation of this textual evidence has been questioned, with some 
scholars highlighting that these texts refer to exposure or abandonment of infants, 
particularly those that appear to have a physical disability, not the direct killing of new-
borns (Gowland et al., 2014).  There is no certainty surrounding the understanding of 
the motives behind abandonment or exposure (Grubbs, 2013; Harris, 1994), however, it 
is thought that a father could dispose of a child on the basis of disability, illegitimacy, 
poverty and sex (Scott, 2001). This abandonment of infants was carried out with the 
assumption that the child would be recovered and cared for by another, even if as a 
slave (Amundsen, 1987, p. 6; Hope, 2007, p. 13; Patterson, 1985, p. 105). Therefore, 
the legality of abandonment cannot be equated with infanticide, as there was no direct 
intent to kill the child (Krause, 2011, p. 636). Infanticide was only condoned in cases of 
severe physical deformity (Laes, 2008, p. 95; Southwell-Wright, 2013, p. 80; Stahl, 
2011, p. 721). 
Archaeologically, infanticide was initially inferred from the widespread exclusion of 
infants from formal cemeteries and their high occurrence in excavated villa and 
settlement sites (Gowland et al., 2014). This burial practice has been interpreted as an 
indication of unequivocal emotional detachment to infant mortality, resulting in 
unceremonious deposition of infant remains (Cocks, 1921, p. 150; Frere, 1987; 
Molleson, 1999). However, this interpretation is conjectural, as ethnographic evidence 
has shown that many societies afforded infants different burial rites to their adult 
counterparts (Craig-Atkins, 2012; Millett and Gowland, 2015). As such, the 
preponderance of Roman infant burials in domestic sites may simply be an indication of 
different burial rites for infants, not necessarily infanticide (Harris, 1982; Moore, 2009; 
Pearce, 2000; Scott, 2001; Ucko, 1969).  
More recently, archaeological infanticide studies have focused on the age-at-death 
distribution of perinatal deaths, particularly within Romano-British populations. The 
pronounced peak observed around the age of 38 - 41 gestational weeks has often being 
interpreted as evidence of widespread infanticide (Mays, 2000, 1993; Mays and Eyers, 
2011; Mays and Faerman, 2001). This view has generated considerable debate from a 
number of authors who question both the validity of the scientific methods employed 
and the interpretation of the textual evidence used (Gowland, 2001; Gowland et al., 
2014; Gowland and Chamberlain, 2002; Millett and Gowland, 2015). Rather it is 
suggested that the age distribution of infants is consistent with natural mortality rates, 
and that the unusual burial locations within domestic environments is a specific 
funerary rite associated with this age group, a careful choice with links to ritual and 
beliefs, not a random disposal of unwanted children (Moore, 2009). Therefore, although 
the archaeological record leaves no doubt that Roman populations endured high infant 
mortality rates, there appears to be little evidence that infanticide significantly 
contributed to them. 
5.5 Summary 
Life was fragile in the Roman world and death, especially of the very young, was a 
frequent occurrence. In an ever-expanding Empire it was a time of socioeconomic and 
sociocultural change, and this change appears to have brought about an increase in 
disease prevalence and high infant mortality rates. Although it has been established that 
poor health often has multifaceted aetiologies, the correlation between the emergence of 
metabolic diseases and shortened stature, both of which can be caused by lead 
poisoning, in a time when lead pollution peaked opens up intriguing questions as to the 
role lead played in the health and mortality of Roman children.  
The high lead burdens that have been observed in Roman populations indicates that 
foetuses and new-borns would have been at risk of acquiring lead from both placental 
transfer and breast milk, the effects of which could result in full-term still births, 
spontaneous abortion and infant death. Thus, there is compelling evidence that lead 
poisoning may have been a contributing factor to the high infant mortality rates seen in 
Roman skeletal populations. As such, it is surprising that so little bioarchaeological 
research has been done to establish whether lead could have contributed to the high 
mortality rates seen in so many Roman populations. However, this research aims to help 
fill this void by exploring whether lead exposure contributed to the high infant mortality 
rates evident in Roman populations. 
CHAPTER SIX 
Materials and Methods 
6.1 Introduction 
This chapter provides synopses of the sites and skeletal samples used in this study. It 
also describes the skeletal analyses and data collection methods employed, alongside 
the sampling strategy, processing and analysis methods used. The statistical analyses 
applied to the data are also presented at the end of the chapter. 
6.2 Methodology outline 
The methodological process followed during this study is briefly outlined below: 
1. Secure access to Roman skeletal material in a number of European countries. 
2. Create a sampling strategy, skeletal recording forms and database to record the 
osteological and contextual information from each site. 
3. Carry out osteological analysis of skeletal material to determine age, sex (where 
possible) and presence of disease. 
4. Collect tooth samples from 12 adults (six females and six males) and 20 non-
adults (10 with skeletal evidence of metabolic disease and 10 without) from each 
site.  
5. Where information is available, collect, translate and record contextual data 
(grave goods, grave type etc.).  
6. Remove and clean tooth enamel samples from all collected teeth at Durham 
University Isotope Laboratory. 
7. Process and analyse enamel samples using MC-ICP-MS and ICP-MS for lead 
isotope and trace element analysis respectively at NERC Isotope Geoscience 
Laboratory (NIGL), Keyworth.  
8. Combine isotope data with osteological and contextual information. 
9. Compare results with previously published lead isotope data.  
10. Run statistical analyses to determine the significance of the results. 
6.3 Sites 
As this study aimed to go some way to bridging the gap in human lead isotope data 
from Roman provinces outside of Britain, the majority of sites were spread across 
mainland Europe (see Fig. 6.1). Samples from Lebanon were included as it represents 
the most easterly border of the Empire. Additionally, although human lead isotope 
ratios are well established in Britain, a small number of individuals excavated in 
Scotland and England were included due to their unusual burial rites. This section 
introduces the sites included in this study, using both published articles and unpublished 
reports provided by the curating institutions. Any documents not written in English 
were translated using Google Translate. All Spanish and Arabic translations were 
provided by Laura Castells-Navarro (University of Bradford) and Vana Kalendrian 
(University of Groningen) respectively.

6.3.1 Dealul Furcilor - Alba Iulia, Romania 
Dealul Furcilor (Pitchfork Hill) is a large Roman hill necropolis located next to the 
urban centre Apulum in Alba Iulia, and was excavated by D. Protase in 1956-58, 1970-
71 and again in 2006 by G. Bounegru and R. Ota. From artefactual (most notably 
bronze coins) and stratigraphic evidence, the site is thought to have been in use during 
the 2nd to 4th centuries AD. The necropolis was a mixed rite cemetery with cremations 
and inhumations present, which was a normal practice for Dacia and other Northern 
provinces of the Roman Empire at the time. A total of 227 burials were excavated, and 
although variation in burial orientation was displayed the majority of inhumations were 
aligned east-west or west-east. Both simple oval boat pits and more elaborate stone 
sarcophagi were used for inhumation burials and coins, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and 
animal bone were recovered from both types of inhumation (Gligor et al., 2010; Ota, 
2009).

6.3.2 Beirut, Lebanon 
ASH 002  A team led by Dr. Assaad Seif (DGA) excavated this site in 2007, and 
dating based on stratigraphy, grave goods, and pottery sherds suggest the site was in use 
during the 1st to 4th centuries AD. Inhumation was the only burial rite practised at ASH 
002 and the 122 individuals recovered were buried in north-south and east-west 
orientations. Grave types consisted of simple pits, wooden coffins, terracotta sarcophagi, 
stone sarcophagi, stone cists, and one masonry tomb with multiple cells. Grave goods 
found at the site include jewellery, glass vessels, coins, metal objects, gold leaves and 
shells. 
ASH 163  Recent rescue excavations led by Dr. Georges Abou Diwan (Lebanese 
University) in 2015 at the ASH 163 site revealed 20 graves, all of which contained 
inhumation burials. Dating based on stratigraphy; grave goods and pottery sherds 
determined that the site was in use between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. 
The type of graves included simple pits, pits with stone capping, wooden coffins, and 
terracotta sarcophagi. The majority of individuals were interred in an east-west 
orientation, with only two individuals placed on the north-south axis. Grave goods were 
plentiful at the site, with many graves containing items such as ceramic unguentaria, 
glass vessels, coins, jewellery, bone objects, metal objects. 
BCH 740  Site BCH 740 is currently being excavated by Dr. Georges Abou Diwan 
(Lebanese University). To date approximately 200 individuals have been recovered and 
while inhumation is the dominant burial rite practised at the site cremation rites are also 
represented. Types of graves included masonry tombs, simple pits, terracotta sarcophagi 
and wooden coffins, and preliminary dating using grave goods suggest that the site was 
in use during the 1st  4th centuries AD. 
MDWR 466 and MDWR 468  Assaid Seif undertook excavations of sites MDWR 466 
and MDWR 268 in 2009 and 2011 and using stratigraphic evidence and artefacts 
determined that the site was in use during the 1st  4th century AD. The sites were 
located adjacent to one another and are thought to constitute part of the same cemetery. 
A total of 41 individuals were recovered from the excavations and at both sites 
inhumation was the only burial rite present. Single burials representing the majority of 
inhumations, however five graves did containe multiple burials. The inhumation rite 
showed some variation across both sites with a combination of simple pit burials, 
simple pits with stone cappings, stone cists, wooden coffins, terracotta and stone 
sarcophagi being used. The MDWR sites were rich in grave goods with items such as 
glass vessels, spindles and spindle whorls, jewellery, coins, gold leaves, hobnails and 
shells included in many of the burials. 
MDWR 02  The recent rescue excavation at MDWR 02 in 2011 by Assaad Seif 
resulted in the recovery of 89 individuals, all but one of which were inhumations 
interred in northsouth and eastwest orientations. The only cremation was interred in a 
lead urn. Grave types at the site varied considerably, and included simple pits, wooden 
coffins, terracotta sarcophagi, burial jars, a masonry tomb and a masonry tomb with 
multiple cells. Grave goods such coins, pottery vessels, glass vessels, jewellery, spindle 
whorls and metal objects were included in many of the burials. From these artefacts, 
pottery sherds and stratigraphy, the site was thought to be in use during the 1st century 
RML 2385  Dr. Assaad Seif (DGA) excavated Site RML 2385 in 2009. Dating of the 
site based on stratigraphic evidence, grave goods and pottery sherds suggest the site was 
in use from early 1st century BC to the 1st century AD. The human remains at RML 
2385 consisted of 25 inhumations interred in an east-west orientation, one cremation 
and 8 disarticulated contexts, truncated by later activity at the site. The majority of 
burials consist of simple pits, but there were also a small number of wooden coffins, a 
single lead urn, one hypogeum and four masonry tombs. Grave goods from the site 
include pottery and glass vessels, jewellery, coins, gold leaves and bone objects 
6.3.3 Michelet - Caen, France 
Michelet was a necropolis in Northern France and was excavated in 1990-93 as a result 
of building works commissioned by the municipality of Lisieux. Stratigraphic, 
artefactual and documentary evidence indicate that the cemetery was in use from the 
late 3rd to 9th centuries AD. Inhumation was the predominant burial rite and 970 
individuals were recovered, of these 575 were in wooden coffins while eight, 3rd to 4th 
century AD individuals were interred in lead coffins, an uncommon occurrence for the 
region. Wooden underground burial chambers were also found during the excavations 
as well as a singular limestone sarcophagus used in an infant burial. Grave goods such 
as jewellery, hobnails, belt buckles, ceramics, glassware, wooden chests and leather 
bags were plentiful in the necropolis despite evidence for looting in some of the Roman 
graves (Paillard and Alduc-Le Bagousse, 2012). 
Figure 6.3  Plan of the Michelet excavation site (Source: Paillard and Alduc-Le 
Bagousse, 2012). 
6.3.4 Santa Caterina - Barcelona, Spain 
The Santa Caterina necropolis was located just outside the city walls of the urban centre 
Barcino (Barcelona). Mir, Oliver and Grandos carried out initial rescue excavations in 
1984 and 1986, but it was in 1999  2002 that full excavation of the site was undertaken 
by Bordas and Torres to understand the evolution of the sites continuous occupation 
from the Bronze Age through to the mid 13th century AD. From stratigraphic evidence 
the Roman necropolis is thought to have been in use during the 4th to 6th centuries AD, 
and was delineated by walls made with stone, mortar and ceramics. A total of 130 
individuals were recovered during the excavations, all of which were inhumation burials 
interred in southwest northeast or northwestsoutheast orientations. Despite the varied 
types of burials present (simple pits, coffins, amphorae, mausolea and tile burials), there 
was conformity in the position of the body. All adults were interred in extended and 
supine positions with their arms crossed over the pelvis or waist, and all of the infants 
were placed in a flexed position within amphorae (Aguelo et al., 2001; Arroyo et al., 
2005). 
Figure 6.4  Plan of the Santa Caterina excavation site (Source: Arroyo et al., 
2005). 
6.3.5 PERI 2 - Tarragona, Spain 
The PERI 2 Roman necropolis was located just outside the city walls of Tarraco 
(Tarragona), a major port city on the northeast coast of Spain, and was excavated in 
1979, 1994-96, and 2001 by the Museu Nacional Arqueolgia de Tarragona (MNAT). 
Through the use of artefacts (pottery, coins etc.) and stratigraphic evidence the site is 
thought to have been in use during the 3rd to 4th centuries AD. A small number of 
cremations were recovered at the site, though inhumation was the predominant burial 
rite practiced at the PERI 2 necropolis, with a total of 431 individuals recovered during 
the excavations. The inhumation rite showed some variation across the site with a 
combination of amphora, wooden coffin, sarcophagi, double sloped tile and flat roof tile 
burials present. Despite this variability the majority of individuals were interred in a 
supine position with an east-west orientation. The PERI 2 necropolis was rich in grave 
goods, with items such as jewellery, ceramics, hobnails, buckles, coins and small 
mirrors included in many of the inhumation burials (i Prast, 2011). 
Figure 6.5  Plan of the PERI 2 excavation site (Source: i Prast, 2011) 
6.3.6 Western Emonske Necropolis - Ljubljana, Slovenia  
The Western Emonske Necropolis was uncovered during excavations by B. Hofman at 
the site of a 19th century tobacco factory in 2009. The 1st  4th century necropolis was 
located outside the city walls of Emona (Ljubljana), alongside the Trieste road leading 
from the western side of the city. The necropolis was a mixed rite cemetery with 
cremations and inhumations present. The majority of cremation burials were in amphora 
or glass urns, with only a small number deposited directly into the ground. All 
inhumation burials were in rectangular tile graves and bone preservation was poor. 
Grave goods at the site included ceramic oil lamps and table vessels (Hofman, 2011; 
Hvalec et al., 2011). 
6.3.7 Primary Health Care Centre - Musselburgh, Scotland  
Excavations carried out by CFA Archaeology Ltd at Musselburgh in 2010 revealed 
archaeological features indicative of multi-phase activity. Four burial pits were 
identified as Iron Age, one of which was a stone-lined cist. All of the Iron Age pits 
contained fragmentary human remains, amounting to a minimum of six individuals (two 
pits contained double inhumations). A small number of grave goods were also 
recovered, including a brooch from one of the single burials. A further six inhumation 
burials, all without grave goods, were identified and radiocarbon dates suggest that they 
date from the Roman Period. Two skeletons displayed sharp force trauma to their 
cervical vertebrae and their skulls were displaced. Although the vertebrae of two other 
individuals were too fragmentary to observe any evidence of trauma, their skulls were 
also displaced indicating that these four individuals had been decapitated. The custom 
of decapitated burials is known from a number of Roman sites in England, most notably 
York (Tucker et al., 2014), but this site would appear to be the first time that this 
custom has been identified in Scotland (Kirby, 2016, 2011).

6.3.8 Lead coffin burials - York and Ilchester, England  
After accidental discovery by a local farmer while ploughing his land, a single Roman 
lead coffin burial was unearthed in York, England (Wilson, pers. comm.). The burial 
was subsequently excavated by Yorkshire Archaeological Trust in 2008, and analysed 
at the University of York. Osteological analysis suggests that the individual was an 
adult male over 45 years old (Wilson, pers. comm.). More recently a Roman 3rd  4th 
century lead coffin burial was unearthed by a metal detectorist in Ilchester, England and 
excavated by South West Heritage in 2013 (Hopkinson, 2013). Analyses of the remains 
were carried out at the Biological Anthropology Research Centre (BARC), University 
of Bradford. Osteological analysis indicated that the human remains were those of a 
young adult female, approximately 1.55m tall, with a well-healed rib fracture. Carbon 
and nitrogen isotope analysis revealed the individual to have had a terrestrial C3 based 
diet typical of Roman Britain (Hopkinson, 2013).  
Lead coffin burials are an uncommon burial rite in Roman-Britain and have previously 
been shown to be associated with migrants (Montgomery et al., 2010; Mldner et al., 
2011). These two burials provide a rare opportunity to explore the geographic origins of 
individuals with intrusive burial rites. Naturally, with any lead coffin burial there is 
always a concern regarding contamination of the human remains from the burial 
environment. However, a study using a Roman lead coffin burial from Spitalfields, 
London has shown that human tooth enamel samples can be successfully analysed from 
these types of burials without contamination masking in vivo isotope ratios 
(Montgomery et al., 2010). However, to ensure the validity of the results a small sample 
from both lead coffins were also analysed for comparison.  
6.4 Osteological analyses  
Biological identity typically refers to the age and sex of an individual. To establish the 
biological identity of the individuals used in this study, standard osteological methods 
of assessment were used (Brickley and McKinley, 2004; Buikstra and Ubelaker, 
1994). The level of preservation and completeness of the skeletal remains often dictates 
which methods can be applied during analysis. The burial environment (soil type, pH, 
moisture levels etc.) and subsequent post depositional activity (animal activity, land 
reuse etc.) can significantly influence the level of taphonomic damage to the bones 
(Walker, 1995, pp. 3536), affecting which osteological methods can be applied to the 
skeletal remains. Therefore, not every osteological method was applied to every 
individual studied, instead the analysis was adapted to incorporate the methods most 
appropriate for the individual being analysed. The methods used in this study are 
separated according to their purpose (i.e. assessing sex or estimating age-at-death) and 
are discussed below.  
6.4.1 Sex assessment 
Observations of the morphological differences in the ossa coxae offer the highest 
accuracy levels for sex assessment, with reported confidence levels of 9095% (Ican 
and Derrick, 1984; Phenice, 1969). Morphological observations of the skull have also 
demonstrated high levels of accuracy for sex assessment; Walkers (1995) method 
provides accuracy of 90% (Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994; Loth and Henneberg, 1996). 
Other studies do not corroborate these results, reporting accuracy levels via skull 
morphology of 62-68% (Donnelly et al., 1998; Haun, 2000; Hill, 2000). However, 
removing subjectivity with metric analysis proved to be less reliable than the objective 
methods, yielding accuracy levels of 80-88% (Bongiovanni and Spradley, 2012; Giles 
and Elliot, 1963; Kocak et al., 2003; Meindl et al., 1985). Therefore, morphological 
differences were used for the purpose of this study. However, it is important to note that 
these morphological changes are most accurate once the individual reaches puberty, 
when skeletal material differentiates sufficiently for reliable sex assessment (White and 
Folkens, 2005). 
6.4.1.1 Adult sex assessment 
6.4.1.1.1 Sexually dimorphic pelvic traits 
The pelvis exhibits the highest level of sexual dimorphism in the human skeleton, due 
to the tight genetic controls surrounding its development. This makes it the most 
accurate and reliable indicator of adult skeletal sex. Generally, the male pelvis is larger 
and more robust than the female pelvis. However, the female pelvis tends to be wider, 
with larger superior and inferior apertures to facilitate childbirth. As the morphological 
features of the pelvis used to assess sex are exhibited on a sliding scale between males 
and females, methods that provide a scale to assess sex allow for the natural variations 
seen between individuals of both sexes. One such method is Walker's (2005) five-point 
scale for assessing the sexual dimorphism of the greater sciatic notch (1 = female, 5 = 
male), which tends to be wider in females than males. The most reliable features of the 
pelvis for sex assessment are thought to be the Phenice traits on the pubic bone, which 
assesses the morphology of the ischio-pubic ramus, presence or absence of the ventral 
arc and the level of sub-pubic concavity (Phenice, 1969). As sexually dimorphic traits 
of the pelvis are thought to be more accurate than those of the skull, where possible 
pelvic traits (see Table 6.1) were used to assess the sex of each skeleton.  
Table 6.1 - Sexually dimorphic pelvic traits used for sex assessment 
Pelvic traits Male Female 
Acetabulum Large Small 
Auricular surface Large / Flat Small / Elevated 
Greater sciatic notch Narrow Wide 
Ilium Z shaped crest / High S shaped crest / Low 
Ischial tuberosity Large Small 
Obiturator foramen Large / Ovoid Small / Triangular 
Pelvic inlet Heart shaped Eliptical  
Pelvic outlet Narrow Wide  
Pre-auricular sulcus Absent Present  
Pubic bone length Short Long  
Sacrum Long / Narrow / Curved Short / Broad 
Ventral arc Absent Present  
(after Ferembach et al., 1979; Phenice, 1969; Walker, 2005) 
6.4.1.1.2 Sexually dimorphic cranial traits 
Although not as accurate as the pelvis due to the higher variability between individuals 
and populations (Mays and Cox, 2000; Meindl and Lovejoy, 1985), skull morphology 
can be useful in assessing the sex of an individual. As with the pelvis, differences in 
the morphological features of the skull are exhibited on a sliding scale between males 
and females, although male skulls tend to be larger and more robust than female skulls. 
Again, Walker (2005) took into account this natural variation in male and female sexual 
dimorphism and developed a five-point scale for sex assessment using select features of 
the cranium and mandible. Other cranial traits such as the size of the orbits and mastoid 
processes or the prominence of muscle attachment sites have been suggested as sexually 
dimorphic (Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994; Mays and Cox, 2000; Meindl and Lovejoy, 
1985; Rogers, 2005).  Where possible all sexually dimorphic traits of the skull (see 
Table 6.2) were used to assess sex.

(after Walker, 2005) 
6.4.1.1.3 Metric sex assessment 
Metric analysis removes the innate subjectivity associated with macroscopic methods, 
and therefore has lower inter- and intra-observer errors than the macroscopic sex 
assessment methods described above (Adams and Byrd, 2002; Moore et al., 2016; 
Spradley and Jantz, 2011). Despite this, sex assessment using the morphology of the 
pelvis or skull is more accurate than metrical analysis. However, it does rely upon the 
skeletal elements being relatively well preserved. Therefore, postcranial metrics can 
offer a useful additional method for the sex assessment of incomplete of fragmentary 
remains (Acsdi and Nemeskri, 1970; Rogers, 1999). The measurements used for sex 
assessment are summarised in Table 6.3. 
Table 6.3 - Skeletal elements used for metric sex assessment 
Skeletal element Measurement Male (mm) Female (mm) 
Clavicle Maximum length >150  < 138  
Scapula Glenoid cavity width > 29  < 26  
Humerus Epicondylar breadth > 60.1  < 60.1  
 Vertical head diameter > 47  < 44.9  
Femur Maximum head diameter > 48  < 43  
 Epicondylar breadth > 76  < 74  
(after Bass, 2005) 
6.4.1.2 Non-adult sex assessment 
Many studies have attempted to develop techniques for juvenile sex assessment, 
yielding promising accuracy levels that ranged between 70-92% (Fazekas and Ksa, 
1978; Loth and Henneberg, 2001; Schutkowski, 1993; Weaver, 1980).  Tests of these 
methods have not been able to reproduce these results, achieving accuracy levels below 
70% (Loth and Henneberg, 1996; Scheuer, 2002; Schutkowski, 1987). It is evident that 
population variation is a major limiting factor for non-adult sex assessment. Until 
geographically diverse studies are conducted to provide population specific standards, 
that are accurate and reliable (>90% confidence level), non-adult sex assessment is not 
possible (Veroni et al., 2010). While differences obviously exist they are as yet, not 
measurable; therefore non-adult sex assessment was not carried out during this study.  
6.4.1.3 Application of sex assessment methods 
Sex assessment was only carried out on adult (18+ years) individuals, using the methods 
outlined above (section 6.3.1). As certain skeletal elements provide higher accuracy 
when assessing sex those with stronger morphological associations with sexual 
dimorphism were considered most indicative of sex. The results of the assessments were 
combined and used to place each individual into one of five categories (see Table 6.4), 
allowing for a degree of uncertainty that is often encountered when assessing 
fragmentary and incomplete remains. All non-adult individuals were categorised as 
indeterminate. 
Table 6.4 - Sex categories used 
Sex categories 
Female 
Probable male 
Probable female 
Indeterminate 
6.4.2 Age-at-death estimation 
An individual has two ages, a chronological age that refers to the time an individual has 
been alive, and a biological age, which refers to how old an individual looks 
physically. Although it is always desirable that biological age is consistent with 
chronological age, the biological age of an individual is often influenced by factors such 
as environment, genetics, disease and activity. Age estimations within adult skeletal 
remains (>18 years) are based upon age related degenerative changes observable in the 
joint surfaces and dentition; however some epiphyses do fuse during early adulthood (c. 
18-29 years). Within adult remains, various skeletal elements exhibit age related 
changes at differing rates in different individuals. Adding observer error to this creates 
substantial differences in estimates from actual chronological age. Therefore, current 
methods used to obtain age-at-death estimations tend to produce large age 
ranges (Buckberry, 2015; Buikstra and Konigsberg, 1985; Meindl et al., 1985). A 
multifactorial approach to age-at-death estimation allows the comparison of average 
ages, providing estimates that correlate more accurately with chronological age than any 
singular ageing method (Mays, 2010). 
With regards to non-adults, skeletal maturation can significantly vary between 
individuals in response to environment, genetics, disease and secular changes. However, 
dental development is thought to continue in its regimented developmental patterns 
regardless of most external stressors (Lewis, 2007). As the remains of non-adults in 
archaeological contexts are usually, by definition, not healthy individuals it is 
reasonable to suggest that age-at-death estimation via skeletal maturation is likely to be 
inaccurate. Therefore, dental age-at-death estimation methods, which provide well-
documented and consistent stages of development, should be the primary method for 
non-adult age-at-death estimation (AlQahtani et al., 2010; Hillson, 1996). Long bone 
length and epiphyseal fusion can also provide accurate non-adult age-at-death estimates 
(Krogman and Ican, 1986; Stewart, 1976; Ubelaker, 1987) and as with adults, a 
multifactorial approach is preferred, therefore they are also described below. 
6.4.2.1 Adult age-at-death estimation 
6.4.2.1.1 Dental attrition 
Dental attrition refers to wear patterns on teeth and can be used to estimate age-at-death 
by assessing the degree of attrition on the occlusal surface of the permanent molars 
(Brothwell, 1981; Brothwell and Powers, 1967; Mays, 2002). Studies have shown 
dental attrition to offer accurate age-at-death estimates that correlate well with ages 
obtained using the pubic symphysis (Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994; Hillson, 1996; 
Lovejoy, 1985; Miles, 1962). As dentition is frequently recovered from the burial 
environment and resilient to diagenetic alteration it is a useful age-at-death estimation 
method, although it is population specific. In this study Brothwells (1981) attrition 
method was used to estimate age-at-death of adult individuals.  
6.4.2.1.2 Pubic symphysis 
Todd (1920) pioneered the use of the pubic symphysis for age estimation, recording 
changes to the symphyseal surface (the anterior joint between the pubic bones of the 
pelvis). Tests of this method found it to significantly overestimate age after 40 years 
(Brooks, 1955), yet attempts to improve the method were unsuccessful (Gilbert and 
McKern, 1973; Katz and Suchey, 1986; McKern and Stewart, 1957; Meindl et al., 
1985). However, Brooks and Suchey (1990) devised the Suchey-Brooks 6 phase 
method, which built upon Todds (1920) work, improving the accuracy to a 95% 
confidence level. Although this method is sex specific, the phases can be combined to 
produce wide age ranges for those of indeterminate sex (Brooks and Suchey, 1990). The 
pubic bones are often absent or poorly preserved in archaeological remains, however 
due to the perceived high level of accuracy provided by the method it was applied when 
preservation and completeness allowed. 
6.4.2.1.3 Auricular surface 
The auricular surface is the joint between the ilia and sacrum, and is a popular target for 
age-at-death estimation methods because its robusticity results in high levels of 
preservation in the burial environment. Lovejoy et al. (1985) originally developed the 
use of the auricular surface (the joint between the ilia and sacrum) for age estimation. 
However, tests of this method have demonstrated inconsistent ageing accuracies and 
high levels of intra-observer error (Murray and Murray, 1991; Saunders et al., 1992). 
Buckberry and Chamberlain (2002) revised this method, proposing a technique that 
used a more objective scoring system, reduced inter- and intra-observer errors, was 
independent of sex and had a better correlation with age than the Suchey-Brooks pubic 
symphysis method. Due to these improvements and the relative ease of its application, 
the Buckberry and Chamberlain (2002) method was used. 
6.4.2.1.4 Cranial suture closure 
At birth the bones of the skull are unfused and as individuals age the sutures (joints) 
between these bones gradually begin to fuse together, becoming less defined with 
increasing age. Cranial suture closure had been considered unreliable and inaccurate for 
decades (Brooks, 1955; McKern and Stewart, 1957), until Meindl and Lovejoy (1985) 
proposed a new method for observing the progression of suture closure at designated 
points on each of the cranial sutures. This new method reduced standard deviations and 
improved accuracy. Although they are not as reliable as other skeletal elements for 
ageing, they can contribute valuable information when used in conjunction with other 
methods (White and Folkens, 2005). 
6.4.2.1.5 Late fusing epiphyses 
Epiphyses are the articular ends of bones, at birth these are separated from the main 
body of the bone by cartilage and through gradual ossification with increasing age they 
eventually unite (fuse) with the rest of the bone. Observing the level of ossification at 
the epiphyses is generally used to estimate non-adult age-at-death. However, a small 
number of epiphyses, such as the sternal end of the clavicle, vertebral annular rings, S1 
to S2 in the sacrum, the iliac crest and the rib heads (Black and Scheuer, 1996; Scheuer 
and Black, 2000; Webb and Suchey, 1985) do not fully fuse until early adulthood. 
These provide an additional method of age-at-death estimation that is particularly useful 
in the assessment of incomplete or poorly preserved skeletons.  
6.4.2.2 Non-adult age-at-death estimation 
6.4.2.2.1 Dental development and eruption 
It has been well established that endogenous and exogenous stress can have significant 
effects on skeletal maturation, with the exception of dental development, which remains 
consistent in its regimented development. To take advantage of this age related constant, 
multiple methods have been developed in an attempt to accurately assess tooth 
formation, root resorption and eruption patterns in non-adults as a method of age 
estimation (AlQahtani et al., 2010; Demirjain et al., 1973; Moorrees et al., 1963; Schour 
and Massler, 1941). However, Ubelaker (1987) highlights that different methods can 
often produce varying results from the same material due to population specific 
standards. As AlQahtani et al.s (2010) dental atlas is not sex specific and visually easy 
to use, it was the method used to estimate non-adult age-at-death. 
6.4.2.2.2 Long bone length 
Long bone length as an indicator of age-at-death becomes less accurate with increasing 
age due to individual and population variation and sex differences (Ubelaker, 2005). 
Therefore, this method is most accurate in foetal and infant (under 1 year) remains 
(Ubelaker, 1987; Ubelaker, 1988). Both foetal long bone length (Scheuer et al., 1980) 
and non-adult diaphyseal length (Scheuer and Black, 2000) were used to estimate age-
at-death were preservation allowed. 
6.4.2.2.3 Epiphyseal fusion 
The gradual fusion of skeletal epiphyses predominantly occurs during early childhood 
and puberty. The first to ossify are the bones of the skull and vertebrae, usually fusing 
during early childhood, while long bone epiphyses and those of the pelvis tend to 
continue fusing throughout adolescence (Scheuer and Black, 2000). Although the age 
ranges associated with epiphyseal fusion is sex specific, they can be combined to 
produce wider age ranges that can be applied to individuals of indeterminate sex. As sex 
assessment of non-adults is currently difficult to conduct with an acceptable level of 
accuracy, a combined age range is the most appropriate range to be applied. As with late 
fusing epiphyses in young adults, observing the level of fusion in non-adults is a useful 
method for age-at-death estimates in incomplete or poorly reserved immature skeletons. 
6.4.2.3 Application of age-at-death estimation methods 
A multifactorial approach to estimating age-at-death was carried out using the methods 
outlined above. Using multiple methods on each individual produced a number of age 
ranges, which were combined to provide a single, overall age range for each 
individual. To facilitate the collation and comparison of age related data, ordinal age 
groups were used to create broad age categories (see Table 6.5). The ranges at which the 
age-at-death estimation methods overlapped were used to determine which age category 
an individual was placed into. Obtaining an age range for any given individual is 
dependent upon the level of preservation and completeness of the skeleton. In instances 
where only a minimum age could be estimated the individual was categorised as either 
adult or non-adult, and in those where estimating age-at-death was not possible an 
indeterminate category was included.

6.4.3 Palaeopathological analysis 
In skeletal populations, disease is identified through the observation of pathological 
alterations on the skeleton (Siek, 2013). However, those that die shortly after 
contracting an illness will show no skeletal indicators of disease, while those that 
survive longer with an illness will develop observable pathological lesions (Siek, 2013). 
This osteological paradox is well documented (DeWitte and Stojanowski, 2015; Wood 
et al., 1992), and although non-adult individuals in skeletal populations are not healthy 
irrespective of the presence or absence of skleletal lesions, for the purpose of this study 
the category without disease has been used where no visible skeletal alterations are 
present. However, it is acknowledged that these individuals do not represent healthy 
children.  
Due to the clinical manifestations of lead poisoning (see Chapter 4), palaeopathological 
analysis of the non-adult individuals focused on the identification of metabolic diseases. 
Although all pathological alterations present were recorded (i.e. non-specific infection, 
congenital abnormalities) their inclusion was outside the scope of this thesis. Therefore, 
the following section only outlines the palaeopathological features of the metabolic 
diseases often associated with lead poisoning and the parameters used to diagnose these 
diseases within the skeletal assemblages. No radiographs were available for any of the 
study sites; therefore diagnoses were made solely from macroscopic examination of the 
skeletal material.  
6.4.3.1 Carious lesions 
Carious lesions were macroscopically identified as the localised destruction of dental 
tissues (Hillson, 1996; Waldron, 2009, pp. 2378), and were recorded as present or 
absent and by tooth position.  Lesion size was estimated as small, medium, large, or 
total destruction (complete loss of the crown).  The position on the tooth (crown, 
cemento-enamel junction, mesial, buccal etc) was also recorded.  
6.4.3.2 Enamel hypoplasia 
Enamel hypoplasia was identified as linear furrows, pitting, or grooves in the enamel 
surface of teeth (Ortner, 2003; Waldron, 2009, p. 244). The presence and tooth position 
of the defect was recorded and categorised in accordance with the guidelines outlined 
by Ogden et al., (2007) (see Fig. 6.7).

6.4.3.3 Cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis 
Cribra orbitalia was identified as abnormal pitting or porosity of the orbital roofs and 
recorded for each orbit using the Stuart-Macadam (1991) grading system (see Table 6.6). 
Distinctions were made between headed/inactive and active cribra orbitalia based on the 
appearance of the lesions. Inactive cribra orbitalia was identified from the presence of 
smooth-edged lesions, while active lesions were identified from the presence of sharp 
edges (Mensforth et al., 1978, p. 23).  Porotic hyperostosis was identified as pitting 
and/or porosity on the ectocranial surfaces of the skull and recorded as either present or 
absent (Mann and Hunt, 2013, p. 28; Waldron, 2009, p. 137). The presence or absence 
of marrow hyperplasia (thickening) of the cranial vault bones was also recorded.

6.4.3.4 Rickets 
A multitude of developmental and pathological processes can cause osseous changes 
similar to those seen in vitamin D deficient non-adults. However, rickets is generally 
identified by the presence of the bowing of the long bones and/or the presence of 
widened, cupped and porous/frayed (brush end) epiphyses, sternal rib-end flaring 
(rachitic rosary) and cranial vault thinning (Waldron, 2009, p. 129). Additional 
manifestations of the disease in non-adults can also include orbital roof porosity, 
deformation of the mandibular ramus, porosity of the sternal rib-ends and deformation 
of the ribs (Brickley et al., 2005; Brickley and Ives, 2010; Mays et al., 2006; Ortner, 
2003; Ortner and Mays, 1998). Using the published diagnostic criteria outlined in Table 
6.7, macroscopic lesions were recorded as either present or absent. A diagnosis of 
rickets was only recorded if three or more probable rachitic features were present, or if 
there were bending deformities of the long bones plus one other feature. Individuals 
exhibiting no probable features but three or more possible features alongside any non-
diagnostic features were considered as possibly rachitic. Using Ortner and Mays (1998) 
definition, a distinction was also made between healed and active rickets.

6.4.3.5 Scurvy 
Pathological alterations indicative of scurvy primarily consist of porotic hyperostosis, 
cribra orbitalia and abnormal porosity (often with periosteal new bone formation) in the 
scapulae, long bone metaphyses, and mandible (Waldron, 2009, p. 132). These lesions 
tend to manifest bilaterally and are thought to be caused by chronic, low-grade 
haemorrhage of weakened blood vessels, predominantly at muscle attachment sites, 
which stimulates an inflammatory response (Ortner et al., 2001, 1999; Ortner and 
Ericksen, 1997). Although abnormal porosity is the primary lesion associated with 
scurvy, it is also common to many other disease processes such as specific and non-
specific infection, haemoglobinopathies, anaemias, and other metabolic disorders 
(Brown and Ortner, 2011; Lagia et al., 2007). It is therefore important to analyse the 
porosity in relation to its distribution across the entire skeleton. Using the published 
diagnostic criteria outlined in Table 6.8, macroscopic lesions were recorded as either 
present or absent. If three or more probable scorbutic features were present, the 
individual was recorded as scorbutic, while individuals exhibiting no probable features 
but three or more possible features alongside any non-diagnostic features were 
considered as possibly scorbutic.

6.5 Data recording 
Osteological and palaeopathological data were recorded on recording forms adapted 
from Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994) and Brickley and McKinley (2004). A Microsoft 
Excel database was created to collate osteological, contextual and isotope data. 
Dropdown options were inserted into the database where applicable to standardise and 
reduce errors in data entry. 
(after Brickley and Ives, 2010, 2006; Geber and Murphy, 2012; Moore and Koon, 2017; Ortner, 
2003; Ortner et al., 2001, 1999; Ortner and Ericksen, 1997) 
6.6 Sampling strategy 
Due to its high resistance to diagenetic alteration and retention of in vivo elemental 
concentrations, dental enamel was targeted for trace element and isotope ratio analyses. 
All of the teeth selected for analysis were, where possible, free from pathological 
alterations (e.g. enamel hypoplasia etc.) and dental modifications, and where 
preservation allowed the selected tooths antimere was present. Depending on 
availability, samples from 12 adults (six females and six males) and 20 non-adults (10 
with skeletal evidence of metabolic disease and 10 without) were to be collected from 
each site. 
6.7 Tooth selection 
As different teeth form and mineralise at different times during childhood, the lead 
contained within different teeth reflects the lead acquired at different times of life. To 
ensure the tooth enamel analysed for lead isotope ratios did not contain any lead from 
the mother (acquired in utero and during breastfeeding), who may have had a different 
geographical origin to her child, the 2nd molar or 2nd premolar were selected from adult 
individuals. Both of these teeth begin forming at around three years of age and should 
provide isotope ratios congruent with the geographical region in which the individual 
spent their childhood. Trace element and isotope ratio analyses of the adult individuals 
was also carried out on permanent 2nd molars or 2nd premolars, the mineralisation times 
of these teeth overlap with those of deciduous teeth allowing comparisons of childhood 
lead exposure. In non-adult individuals, deciduous incisors were preferentially selected 
for sampling as they are the earliest forming teeth and therefore facilitate the analysis of 
children as young as 30 weeks in utero. If these preferred teeth were unavailable, either 
due to insufficient skeletal preservation or incompleteness, the earliest forming tooth 
available was selected in non-adults while the 3rd molar was used as a substitute in adult 
individuals. Tables 6.9 and 6.10 summarise the samples collected during the course of 
this study.

6.8 Isotope analysis 
Two of the main aims of this study are to explore how exposure to anthropogenic lead 
affected childhood health and investigate the variability of lead isotope ratios within the 
Roman Empire. In order to assess how lead burdens affected childhood health in Roman 
populations trace element analysis was carried out on all permanent and deciduous teeth 
collected during this study to determine their lead concentrations (ppm).  To explore the 
variability of lead isotopes within the Roman Empire lead isotope analysis was carried 
out, and although not a main focus of this research, strontium was also analysed. 
Strontium isotope ratios are a well-established method for exploring mobility in 
bioarchaeological studies (see Chapter 3). However, as similar terrains are found across 
large expanses of northern Europe and Britain, strontium isotope ratios are often 
insufficiently unique enough to differentiate between people from different regions that 
have similar geology. As lead in Roman individuals is thought to derive mostly from 
anthropogenic ore exposure not solely local geology, it is possible that lead may show 
more cultural variability across Europe than strontium. To explore the variability of lead 
in comparison to strontium within the Roman Empire and to assess whether the 
combination of lead and strontium can improve not only our ability to identify migrants 
within skeletal populations but also narrow down possible regions of origin, both 
strontium and lead isotope ratios were analysed in all permanent teeth collected from 
adult individuals.  
6.8.1 Sample preparation 
Initial sample preparation was carried out at Durham University Isotope Laboratory, 
following procedures outlined by Montgomery (2002). The enamel surface was abraded 
using a tungsten carbide dental bur to remove surface contamination. Following this, a 
chip of core enamel approximately 2030 mg in weight was removed using a flexible 
diamond edged rotary saw, all exposed surfaces of the chip were abraded to remove any 
adhering dentine and potential sources of contamination. All dental tools were cleaned 
between samples via ultrasonication in Decon for 5 minutes and rinsed three times with 
ultra-pure deionised water. Clean core enamel chips were sealed in microcentrifuge 
tubes and transferred to the Class 100, HEPA filtered laboratory facilities at the Natural 
Environment Research Council Isotope and Geoscience Laboratory (NIGL) in 
Keyworth, Nottingham.  
At NIGL all enamel samples were rinsed three times with high purity water (Millipore 
Alpha Q), and then soaked at 60 C for one hour. The samples were then rinsed again 
before being leached with 0.2M HCl for five minutes. After a final rinse, the samples 
were dried and transferred into pre-cleaned Teflon beakers and dissolved in 8M HNO3. 
Samples were converted to chloride using 6M HCl, taken up in titrated 2.5M HCl and 
pipetted onto ion-exchange chromatography columns. The strontium was separated 
using a Dowex resin. The washes from the chloride samples were collected, dried 
down and converted to a bromide form using HBr to facilitate the separation of lead 
using conventional anion exchange methods. In preparation for lead concentration 
analysis, which was carried out separately to lead isotope ratio determination, all 
samples were diluted with 1% v/v HNO3. 0.5% v/v HCl before ICP-MS analysis was 
carried out. 
6.8.2 Mass spectrometry 
6.8.2.1 Strontium isotope analysis 
Strontium isotope ratios were determined by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry 
(TIMS) using a ThermoTriton automated multi-collector mass spectrometer. Using a 
method adapted from Birck (1986), samples were loaded onto single Rhenium (Re) 
filaments with TaF activator to enhance stability and sensitivity. The reproducibility of 
the international standard reference material (NBS987) was 0.710255  0.000010 (n=54, 
2 sd), and all data was normalised to the NBS987 accepted value 0.710250.  
6.8.2.2 Lead isotope analysis 
Lead isotope ratios were determined by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) using a Nu Plasma HR with an average 
reproducibility (2 sd) of 206Pb/204Pb = 0.009%; 207Pb/204Pb = 0.008%; 208Pb/204Pb 
= 0.01%; 207Pb/206Pb = 0.003%; 208Pb/206Pb = 0.005%. Before analysis all samples were 
spiked with a thallium (Tl) solution and normalised to NBS981. When lead 
concentration yields were low, MC-ICP-MS using a Thermo Fisher Scientific 
NEPTUNE Plus with an X-Skimmer cone was used with average reproducibility (2 sd) 
of 206Pb/204Pb = 0.010%; 207Pb/204Pb = 0.014%; 208Pb/204Pb = 0.019% 207Pb/206Pb = 
0.006%; 208Pb/206Pb = 0.012%.  
6.8.2.3 Trace element analysis 
Trace element analysis to determine lead concentration results was conducted using 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using an Agilent 7500cx ICP-
MS fitted with a CETAC ASX-520 autosampler with an average reproducibility (2 sd) 
of 0.01%. The transfer of samples to the ICP-MS from the autosampler was controlled 
by a CETAC ASXpress + vacuum pump. Multi-element quality control check standards 
were analysed at the start and end of each run and after no more than every 20 samples. 
To overcome polyatomic interferences the ICP-MS collision cell was operated in He 
mode at a flow rate of 5.5 ml min-1 for all analytes except Se, for which H2 gas was used 
at 4.5ml min-1. Quantitative data analysis was carried out using MassHunter 
Workstation software (Agilent). 
6.9 Data comparisons 
When comparing lead concentrations between non-adults with evidence of disease and 
those without it was imperative to be certain that those in the category without disease 
showed no evidence of metabolic stress. Therefore, only non-adult individuals that 
could be identified with certainty as not having any skeletal manifestations of metabolic 
disease were included in the comparison of palaeopathological data and lead 
concentrations. Any non-adult individual with low preservation and/or completeness 
levels that inhibited the assessment of pathological alterations to the entire skeleton 
were excluded from this phase of the analysis. Although this reduced sample sizes it did 
ensure that individuals were not assigned to incorrect categories. 
Open access databases such as the Oxford Archaeological Lead Isotope Database 
(OXALID) were used to gather comparative lead isotope datasets to determine whether 
the data from the human samples reflected local lead isotope characteristics. Isotope 
ratios from contemporaneous human samples were also included in comparisons where 
published data was available. 
6.10 Statistical analyses 
Due to the non-parametric nature of the data, box and whisker plots were produced to 
graphically display the range and skewness of the data. To better visualise the 
differences between certain groups some y-axis ranges were reduced to enlarge the plots. 
Where this resulted in the exclusion of some extreme outliers from the plots, the 
outlying data points were described in the figure captions. For the statistical analysis of 
two independent groups the Mann-Whitney U test was applied, and when comparing 
more than two independent groups the Kruskal-Wallace test was used. Both statistical 
tests were run using the IBM SPSS programme version 0.2 for Microsoft Windows and 
a p-value of 0.05 was set as the level of significance to best correct for type one and 
type two errors (Madrigal, 2012, p. 94).  
CHAPTER SEVEN 
Lead Concentrations and Health 
7.1 Introduction  
By their very nature human skeletal remains offer a direct link to people in the past, 
providing a rich source of information pertaining to the lives and living conditions of 
past populations (Scott, 2013). Paired osteological evidence of disease and tooth enamel 
lead concentration (ppm) analyses allows exploitation of this link, facilitating a better 
understanding of how lead exposure affected the health and mortality of children within 
the Roman Empire. This chapter will discuss the results of the lead concentration 
analysis and how it relates to Roman childhood health and mortality from different 
regions of the empire. The results are separated into two sections. The first section 
assesses inter-dental variations and population differences in lead concentrations, while 
the second section focuses on how lead exposure impacted upon childhood health and 
mortality. The results are then discussed together (section 7.6) to present a 
comprehensive review of how trace element analysis of polluted populations can inform 
our understanding of the lives of people in the past. 
The study population includes 176 individuals (66 adults and 110 non-adults) from five, 
1st to 4th century AD sites located in different regions of the Roman Empire. Skeletal 
material was assessed to determine age-at-death, sex (of adults only) and the presence 
of disease (see Table 7.1). A detailed summary of the results from the lead and 
osteological analyses of each individual included in this study is tabulated in Appendix

7.2 Inter-dental variations  
Within archaeological contexts teeth tend to have the highest level of preservation of 
any surviving skeletal material, and are highly resistant to diagenetic alteration. Thus, 
making them prime sampling material for trace element analysis. Understanding how 
heavy metals such as lead are incorporated into and distributed between different tooth 
types is important not only for the interpretation of such data, but also in how data 
between studies can be compared (Rabinowitz et al., 1991). The majority of published 
research on dental lead concentrations has been conducted on modern populations as a 
means of assessing the usefulness of teeth as an indicator of environmental lead 
exposure (Amr et al., 2010; Arora et al., 2006; Bayo et al., 2001; Kamberi et al., 2011; 
Karahalil et al., 2007; Negrea et al., 2008; Olympio et al., 2010). Due to their natural 
exfoliation, and therefore easy collection, deciduous teeth are often used as an indicator 
of childhood lead exposure and consequently, body lead burdens (Barbosa et al., 2005; 
Fergusson et al., 1988; Malara et al., 2006; Needleman et al., 1972).  
Comparison of tooth enamel lead concentrations from the permanent (n = 92) and 
deciduous (n = 84) teeth analysed in this study showed that deciduous teeth had higher 
lead concentrations (median = 5.8 ppm) than permanent teeth (median = 2.4 ppm) (see 
Fig. 7.1). This is consistent with previous studies that found that deciduous teeth had 
statistically significantly higher lead concentrations than permanent teeth (Shapiro et al., 
1972). It is thought that this difference in lead concentrations is due to age related 
differences in lead absorption rates from the gastrointestinal tract. Although enamel lead 
concentrations in both deciduous and permanent teeth represent childhood lead 
exposure, different teeth form at different ages. As absorption rates from ingested lead 
decrease with increasing age, the disparity between permanent and deciduous tooth 
enamel lead concentrations could represent higher lead absorption rates during the 
development of earlier forming teeth (Paterson et al., 1988; Purchase and Fergusson, 
1986; Rabinowitz et al., 1991; Selypes et al., 1997). Diet could also be linked to this. 
Studies have demonstrated that diet and nutrition can have significant effects on the 
absorption rates of lead from the gastrointestinal tract (Barltrop and Khoo, 1975). For 
example, diets low in iron or high in vitamin D and fats tend to increase the amount of 
lead absorbed, while diets high in fibre decrease lead absorption (Baernstein and Grand, 
1942; Barltrop and Khoo, 1975; Sobel et al., 1940). Additionally, liquid diets such as 
the predominantly milk-based diet fed to infants and young children, also increase the 
amount of lead absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract (Kello and Kostial, 1973). 
Although a diet high in mineral content has proven to reduce lead absorption, the high 
calcium content of milk does not appear to be able to completely counteract the 
increased absorption rates associated with a liquid diet (Barltrop and Khoo, 1975). This 
may be due to the high fat and protein content of milk, both of which have been shown 
to increase the uptake of dietary lead. As such, the different types of diets given to 
children during different stages of childhood, and therefore while different teeth are 
mineralising, may also influence the amount of lead incorporated into deciduous and 
permanent teeth. 
Figure 7.1  Comparison of lead concentrations by tooth type. 
Permanent: median = 2.4 ppm (n = 92), Deciduous: median = 5.8 ppm (n = 84). An 
outlier in the deciduous group with a lead concentration of 187 ppm is not shown on the 
plot due to reduced y-axis scale. 
A number of studies have demonstrated that factors such as tooth type, tooth location 
(mandibular or maxillary), and dental material analysed (dentine, enamel etc.), may 
significantly influence the lead concentrations obtained from teeth (Kamberi et al., 
2012). If, as suggested above, higher lead concentrations in deciduous teeth were a 
result of higher absorption rates in young children, a negative correlation between lead 
concentration and age of tooth formation would be expected. However, this is not the 
case. Some studies have shown that deciduous incisors have higher lead concentrations 
than deciduous molars (Mackie et al., 1977; Pinchin et al., 1978), while others have 
reported contrasting patterns in lead concentrations between deciduous incisors and 
deciduous canines (Paterson et al., 1988; Shapiro et al., 1975).  
When lead concentrations between tooth types were compared in this study, no 
significant differences were observed between the permanent tooth types (see Fig. 7.2). 
Comparison of the deciduous teeth showed that canines had higher lead concentrations 
(median = 12.2 ppm) than the deciduous incisors (median = 5.8 ppm), first molars 
(median = 5.2 ppm) and second molars (median = 3.3 ppm) (see Fig. 7.3). Although the 
canines had more than double the lead concentrations seen in the other deciduous tooth 
types, only the second molars showed a significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis X2 = 
3.841, p = 0.0256). Canines begin development approximately one month after incisors 
(Gustafson and Koch, 1974). Therefore, if lead levels were simply a function of age, 
incisors (the earliest forming tooth) would be expected to have the highest lead 
concentrations. An important consideration here is also the length of time it takes for 
each tooth type to reach complete mineralisation of the crown enamel. It is reasonable 
to suggest that the longer tooth enamel takes to mineralise the more opportunity there is 
for the accumulation of lead within the mineral matrices. If this were a limiting factor to 
lead acquisition in tooth enamel the teeth that take the longest to mineralise, such as the 
deciduous canines and second molars (approximately 13 months), would have 
consistently higher lead concentrations than deciduous incisors and first molars which 
take approximately 9  10 months to complete mineralisation (Gustafson and Koch, 
1974). While the median lead concentration obtained for the deciduous incisors, canines 
and first molars in this study do fit with this hypothesis, the second molars do not. As 
such, these results support the presupposition that physiological factors such as age and 
enamel mineralisation time are unlikely to be the dominant mechanism behind lead 
accumulation in teeth. However, other physiological facors such as periods of rapid 
growth (growth spurts) and changes to diet must be considered. It is well documented 
that children have growth spurts during the first year of life, again between the ages of 
six to eight years (mid-growth spurt), and then finally during adolescence between the 
ages of 13 to 18 years (pubertal growth spurt) (Tanner, 1988). If these growth spurts and 
changes in diet such as weaning, which tends to occur around the age of two to three 
years (Dupras, 2001) affected natural accumulation of lead in tooth enamel then 
increases in lead concentrations would be expected to be seen in teeth mineralising 
during these times. Again, this is not the case, and studies have shown that after the 
removal of the very outer surface of enamel to eliminate environmental contamination, 
lead concentrations do not significantly vary spatially within deciduous teeth, 
suggesting that tooth enamel matures homogenously before eruption (Tacail et al., 
2017). Therefore, although the mechanisms behind the incorporation of lead in to tooth 
enamel is highly complex and poorly understood, changes in levels of exposure during 
the formation of different tooth types is the most likely cause for these disparate 
concentrations.

Molars: median = 2.8 ppm (n = 39) and 3rd Molars: median = 2.23 ppm (n = 7). An 
outlier in the incisor group with a lead concentration of 59.62 ppm is not shown on the 
plot due to reduced y-axis scale.

outlier in the incisor group with a lead concentration of 187 ppm is not shown on the 
plot due to reduced y-axis scale. 
 As with tooth type, comparisons of lead concentrations in mandibular and maxillary 
teeth have demonstrated great variability between studies. Some indicating maxillary 
teeth have higher lead concentrations than mandibular teeth (Pinchin et al., 1978), and 
others demonstrating the opposite (Smith et al., 1983). Although mandibular teeth begin 
developing slightly earlier (approximately 1 month) than maxillary teeth (Gustafson and 
Koch, 1974) a comparison of the two in this study showed that maxillary teeth had 
higher lead concentrations than mandibular teeth in both the permanent and deciduous 
dentition (see Fig. 7.4). However, these differences were not statistically significant 
(Kruskal-Wallis, X2 = 3.841, p = 0.0903). When the median lead concentrations for the 
samples were compared by country, the same trend was seen across all four sites (see 
Fig. 7.5). However, the mandibular teeth from Lebanon and Romania showed greater 
range in lead concentrations than their maxillary counterparts. This consistency in 
elevated maxillary teeth lead concentrations across countries is surprising considering 
the divergent results seen between mandibular and maxillary teeth in other studies 
(Pinchin et al., 1978; Smith et al., 1983).

dentition. Deciduous maxillary: median = 6.8 ppm (n = 57), Deciduous mandibular: 
median = 5.2 ppm (n = 27), Permanent maxillary: median = 3.8 ppm (n = 53) and

maxillary group with a lead concentration of 187 ppm is not shown on the plot due to 
reduced y-axis scale.

dentition by country. Romania maxillary: median = 2.9 ppm (n = 22), Romania

(n = 19), Lebanon mandibular: median = 5.0 ppm (n = 21), Spain maxillary: median =

Spain maxillary group (187 ppm) and Spain mandibular group (59.63 ppm) are not 
shown on the plot due to reduced y-axis scale. 
The results of this study, alongside previously published research (Pinchin et al., 1978; 
Smith et al., 1983) demonstrate the non-uniform distribution of lead within teeth. There 
is no consensus on which dental arcade (maxillary or mandibular) provides the highest 
concentrations, or whether there are any patterns to which type of tooth will yield the 
highest amount of lead. The significant discrepancies between studies suggest that these 
variations in lead concentrations are probably not due to physiological factors (blood 
supply, time of formation etc.), but rather a product of fluctuations in environmental 
exposure. It is doubtful that anyone experiences a continuous and consistent level of 
lead exposure for any prolonged period of time. In fact, modern studies have shown that 
childrens levels of lead exposure have a tendency to fluctuate seasonally (Kemp et al., 
2007; Laidlaw et al., 2005; Yiin et al., 2000; Zahran et al., 2013). As different tooth 
types develop at different times throughout an individuals childhood (Schour and 
Massler, 1941), it is likely that inter-dental variations in lead concentration are 
population specific and reflect an individuals level of lead exposure at the time of tooth 
formation.  
Modern studies do not have the same contamination risks to consider as archaeological 
studies, and as a result often obtain data from the analysis of the whole tooth or dentine 
samples. Such variations in sampling techniques, as well as analytical methodology 
make comparison between studies problematic (Rabinowitz et al., 1991), especially if 
attempting to relate archaeological lead concentrations to those obtained from modern 
studies when assessing how the data reflects exposure. Irrespective of the type of 
sample used there are undoubtedly significant inconsistencies in inter-dental lead 
concentrations. Therefore, it would be optimal to compare lead concentrations from 
teeth of the same type and tooth position (Bercovitz and Laufer, 1990). However, this 
has the potential to be extremely limiting, especially in archaeological studies where 
skeletal preservation and completeness dictates which teeth can be sampled. If 
standardisation of tooth type were to be implemented, sample sizes would be greatly 
reduced (Tvinnereim et al., 2000). 
7.3 Geographical variations  
From the limited number of studies that have published lead concentration data from 
Romano-British skeletal material, it is clear that there is great variability in the range of 
lead concentrations (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). 
The results of this study were no different (see Fig 7.6), with statistically significant 
variations in median lead concentrations between all four countries (Kruskal-Wallis, X2 
(3) = 7.815, p = 0.0002). The Romanian population had the lowest lead concentrations 
with values ranging from 0.03 ppm to 10.67 ppm (median = 2.4 ppm), while the 
Spanish individuals had the highest concentrations that ranged from 0.7 ppm to 187 
ppm (median = 7.3 ppm). 
Figure 7.6  Comparison of lead concentrations by country.  
Romania: median = 2.4 ppm (n = 37), France: median = 3.6 ppm (n = 37), Lebanon: 
median = 6.3 ppm (n = 40) and Spain: median = 7.3 ppm (n = 63). An outlier in the 
Spain group with a lead concentration of 187 ppm is not shown on the plot due to 
reduced y-axis scale. 
Differences in average lead concentrations are not only seen between countries, but also 
between sites within the same country. Although geographically only approximately 96 
kilometres apart, the Spanish sites at Tarragona and Barcelona exhibited statistically 
significant differences in median lead concentrations (see Fig 7.7). As geogenic 
environmental lead concentrations have been shown to vary geographically (Reimann et 
al., 2012), it stands to reason that human lead concentrations could also vary 
geographically. Added to this, is the variability in anthropogenic lead exposure between 
Roman populations both within and between countries. Therefore, it is likely that 
Roman human lead concentrations are population specific and reflect local levels of 
anthropogenic lead exposure.  The geology of the local areas surrounding populations is 
also an important factor to consider when exploring what may influence the absorption 
of lead between different populations. Studies have shown that the mineral content of 
drinking water can affect the absorption of lead, with hard water (high mineral content) 
acting as a natural buffer against the absorption of the heavy metal (Levander, 1979). 
Therefore if a populations drinking water was running off calcium carbonate rich 
terrains they might absorb lower concentrations of lead than a population whose 
drinking water originated from granitic terrains, for example. To this end it is interesting 
to note that the geologies surrounding Barcelona and Tarragona and the river that 
supply their respective drinking water differ quite substantially despite their close 
proximity to each other. The Ro Francol which supplies water to Tarragona traverses 
calcium carbonate rich terrains such as limestone, sandstone and marls, while 
Barcelonas water supply from the Ro Bess flows through a terrain composed of 
granites and gravel (Llamas, 1969). Despite the likelihood that Tarragonas water had 
higher calcium content than Barcelona, the Tarragona population still accumulated 
higher levels of lead. Thus it may be that the significant difference seen between the 
two Spanish populations has a more anthropological than geological cause, such as 
mining pollution. Unlike Barcelona which was predominantly mined for the green 
minerals calaite and variscite for jewellery, Tarragona was a major source of lead rich 
galena and extensively mined throughout the Roman period (UNESCO, 2007). The 
increased pollution in the local area that would have been created during the processes 
involved in lead mining and metalworking may account for the variability seen between 
these two Spanish sites. 
Figure 7.7  Comparison of lead concentrations from the Tarragona and 
Barcelona individuals. Tarragona, Spain: median = 11.2 ppm (n = 27), Barcelona, 
Spain: median = 3.3 ppm (n = 35). An outlier in the Tarragona group (187 ppm) and 
Barcelona group (59.62 ppm) are not shown on the plot due to reduced y-axis scale. 
7.4 Comparing males and females   
Lead exposure can fluctuate depending on a number of variables, including occupation, 
status, availability of certain foodstuffs and lead containing products. Assessing the 
difference in lead concentrations between certain groups (males and females, rural and 
urban inhabitants etc.) can provide a wealth of information pertaining to a populations 
socioeconomic status. To further understand how exposure patterns may have varied 
within the Roman Empire, differences between male and female lead concentrations 
were assessed. Archaeological studies investigating childhood lead burdens are scarce 
and modern studies have reported conflicting results. Some studies stating that there is 
no significant difference between male and female lead concentrations (Baghurst et al., 
1992; Strmberg et al., 2008, 2003), while others show evidence for higher lead 
concentrations in male children (Claymaet et al., 1991; Costa de Almeida et al., 2010; 
Meyer et al., 1998; Paoliello et al., 2002; Roels et al., 1980; Trepka et al., 1997). 
Analysis of the tooth enamel lead concentrations from the 64 sexed adult individuals in 
this study allowed exploration of any differences in Roman childhood lead 
concentrations between males and females. Collectively, males (median = 3.8 ppm) had 
higher lead concentrations than females (median = 2.4 ppm) (see Fig. 7.8). When 
compared by country, again males tended to have higher lead concentrations than 
females (see Fig. 7.9). The only exceptions to this were the Spanish samples, where 
females (median = 4.2 ppm) exhibited higher lead concentrations than males (median = 
3.8 ppm). Although these differences were not statistically significant, they raise 
interesting questions about why Spanish individuals go against the trend seen in the 
majority of both archaeological and modern lead concentration studies. 
Figure 7.8  Comparison of male and female lead concentrations. 
Male: median = 3.8 ppm (n = 30) and Female: median = 2.4 ppm (n = 34). 
Figure 7.9  Comparison of male and female lead concentrations by country. 
Romania male: median = 2.9 ppm (n = 5), Romania female: median = 1.5 ppm (n = 5), 
France male: median = 1.9 ppm (n = 7), France female: median = 1.8 ppm (n = 7), 
Lebanon male: median = 4.7 ppm (n = 6), Lebanon female: median = 2.5 ppm (n = 10), 
Spain male: median = 3.8 ppm (n = 12) and Spain female: median = 4.2 ppm (n = 12). 
Recent studies into sex differences in body lead burdens have mainly focused on 
differences in adults. These studies found that males tend to have higher lead 
concentrations than females (Barry, 1975; Brown and Margolis, 2012; Theppeang et al., 
2008). It is thought that the increased haematocrit levels and higher exposure patterns 
seen in males are the main reasons for the difference between the sexes (Becker et al., 
2002; Pirkle et al., 1998). However, other studies have proposed that sex dependent 
differences in metabolism and genetic regulation are responsible for higher lead 
concentrations in males (Bjrkman et al., 2000; Vahter et al., 2007). The majority of 
lead within the body is stored within the skeletal tissues (Gulson et al., 1997, 1995), and 
premenopausal females have been shown to release this stored lead at slower rates than 
males (Popovic et al., 2005; Roberts and Cox, 2003).  This is in part due to oestrogen 
levels. The hormone reduces osteoclast activity, decreasing the rate of bone resorption 
and therefore the subsequent release of lead stored within the skeleton (Goldberg et al., 
2016; Kameda et al., 1997; Oursler et al., 1991; Parikka et al., 2001).  
Hereditary factors are also thought to contribute to the elevated lead concentrations seen 
in males. Genetic studies have proposed that up to 40% of female lead burdens are 
influenced by genetic factors, while almost 95% of male lead burdens result from 
environmental exposure (Bjrkman et al., 2000). Hormonal regulation of the three 
polymorphic genes known to influence the toxicodynamics of lead (ALAD, Vitamin D 
Receptor and HFE protein) are thought to account for this genetic variation in sex 
specific absorption, retention and excretion of lead (Onalaja and Claudio, 2000; Vahter 
et al., 2007). Unfortunately, these explanations for the higher lead concentrations in 
males are not applicable to archaeological lead concentration data obtained from tooth 
enamel. The data obtained from tooth enamel represents the lead acquired during the 
time of tooth enamel mineralisation. In deciduous dentition, permanent 2nd molars and 
premolars, as used in this study, enamel mineralisation is complete before adolescence. 
During this prepubescent phase girls and boys have very similar hormone levels 
(Bidlingmaier et al., 1975, 1973). However, modern studies have shown that there tend 
to be small surges in sex hormones during the early development of infants. In boys 
testosterone levels have been shown to increase during four to six weeks gestation and 
again between one to six months after birth (Forest et al., 1976; Raivio et al., 2003; 
Alexander, 2014), and in girls oestrogen levels have been shown to increase during the 
first six months of life (Bidlingmaier et al., 1987; Kuiri-Hanninen et al., 2013). After 
these postnatal endocrine surges sex hormone levels fall and remains stable until 
puberty (Ostanikova et al., 2002). Although both boys and girls experience short 
periods of increased sex hormones early in life, multiple studies have demonstrated that 
there is no difference in prenatal or postnatal lead concentrations between males and 
females (Vahter et al., 2007; Baghurst et al., 1992; Stromberg et al., 2003; Dietrich et al., 
2001; Yabe et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2017). Therefore, it is likely that hormonal 
regulation of gene expression or endocrine function would not be a major influential 
factor in early childhood lead acquisition.  
It is therefore likely that the differences between Roman male and female lead 
concentrations seen in this study are due to differences in levels of exposure. During 
childhood, the predominant method of lead ingestion is through hand to mouth activity 
(Raymond, 2017; Sahmel et al., 2015; Sayre et al., 1974; Schnur and John, 2014; Watt 
et al., 1993). Boys may have been engaging in a wider range of activities that facilitated 
this type of exposure. The higher lead concentrations seen in the Spanish female 
populations also suggests that environmental exposure has a more significant effect on 
childhood lead burdens than genetic influences. If metabolic and genetic mechanism 
were influencing childhood lead concentrations, males would be expected to have the 
highest lead concentrations irrespective of the population they came from. However, at 
both the Tarragona and Barcelona sites, females had marginally higher lead 
concentrations than males (see Fig. 7.10).  
Figure 7.10  Comparison of the male and female lead concentrations from the 
Tarragona and Barcelona sites in Spain. Tarragona males: median 8.9 ppm (n = 7), 
Tarragona females: median = 10.2 ppm (n = 5), Barcelona males: median = 1.7 ppm (n 
= 5) and Barcelona females: median = 2.6 (n = 7). 
 Comparative archaeological studies that have explored sex differences in lead 
concentrations are few. Millard et al., (2014) found no significant difference in the lead 
concentrations of males and females from a 19th century London population. However, 
Japanese studies of 17th  19th century AD samurai, merchant and farmer populations 
found significantly higher lead concentrations in the females from the samurai class, but 
no difference between the sexes in the merchant and farmer classes (Nakashima et al., 
2007, 1998). Explanations for this centre on status and its accompanying exposure 
levels. The samurai class were considered a high-status population, while the merchants 
and farmers were considered low status. It is therefore posited that the higher status 
females would have had greater exposure to lead containing products (e.g. cosmetics) 
and foodstuffs (e.g. wine) than lower status females (Nakashima et al., 2007, 1998). 
Therefore, a difference in status may also account for the high lead concentrations seen 
in the Spanish individuals analysed here.  
The type and quantity of grave goods included in burials have been shown to vary by 
age, ethnicity and status and are often used to determine the status of an individual 
(Philpott, 1991). Data pertaining to grave goods and burial type were not available for 
the Tarragona individuals, therefore the effect that status may have had upon these lead 
concentrations could not be determined. However, at the Barcelona site, records show 
that two of the sampled females were buried in mausolea, while the remaining 
individuals were buried in tile-capped graves (tegula). These a cappuccina burials are 
common in Roman Spain and thought to be representative of lower status individuals 
(Bruun and Edmondson, 2015). Burials in mausolea, however, are thought to represent 
high status individuals. Although any conclusions drawn from the comparison of these 
twelve Barcelona individuals is limited due to the small sample size, results show that 
the individuals buried in mausolea had markedly higher lead concentrations than the 
individuals buried in tegula graves (see Fig. 7.11). These results show that higher status 
in these Barcelona individuals is accompanied by elevated lead concentrations, 
suggesting that status may have influenced female lead exposure in Spain during the 
Roman period. Although this pilot study has generated promising results, it is limited by 
the small sample size and therefore the differences in lead concentration in relation to 
status cannot be generalised to encompass the entire Roman Empire. 
Figure 7.11  Comparison of the lead concentrations from Barcelona individuals 
buried in tegula (low status) and mausolea (high status) graves. 
Tegula graves: median = 2.0 ppm (n = 10) and Mausolea: median = 8.4 ppm (n = 2). 
7.5 Health and mortality  
7.5.1 Lead and mortality 
Lead is a cumulative poison, and one to which children are particularly susceptible 
(Hursh and Suomela, 1968; Rabinowitz et al., 1976). The increased bioavailability of 
lead during the Roman period, due to high environmental lead pollution and the use of 
lead compounds rendered the empires children at greater risk than ever before (Mackie 
et al., 1975; Montgomery et al., 2010). There is no doubt that childhood was a perilous 
time throughout the Roman period, with failure to thrive being an all too common 
occurrence, to which the high prevalence of infant and juvenile remains in Roman 
skeletal populations stands testament (Carroll, 2014). Despite this, and the documentary 
evidence of lead poisoning being responsible for stillbirths, spontaneous abortion, and 
deformities in Roman infants (Gilfillan, 1965; Nriagu, 1983; Waldron et al., 1979; 
Woolley, 1984), little has been done to explore any link between childhood lead 
exposure and high infant mortality rates. With this shortage of evidence to support or 
indeed refute the degree to which lead impacted upon the health and mortality of 
Roman populations, attention must be directed to the skeletal remains from the period. 
To address this, lead concentrations in tooth enamel from deciduous teeth and 
permanent teeth were compared to explore any differences in childhood lead 
concentrations between individuals that died during childhood and those that survived 
into adulthood. However, when comparing deciduous and permanent tooth enamel 
samples it is important to consider total enamel thickness. As discussed above (section 
4.5.3), enamel lead concentrations have been shown to be higher on the outer surface of 
the crown as well as next to the enamel dentine junction  (Budd et al., 1998; Robbins et 
al., 2010). Therefore, core enamel samples are commonly used to avoid these areas of 
variability (Montgomery, 2002; Budd et al., 2004). Although deciduous tooth enamel is 
thin, making core enamel samples more difficult to obtain, recent studies have 
demonstrated that deciduous tooth enamel composition remains virtually unchanged 
throughout the tooth (Mller et al., 2019). Therefore, once surface enamel has been 
removed deciduous enamel samples should be comparable with core enamel samples 
from permanent teeth. 
A comparison of the lead concentration data from the adult and non-adult individuals 
shows that those who survived into adulthood had lower childhood lead burdens 
(median = 2.6 ppm) than those that died during childhood (median = 7.2 ppm) (see Fig. 
7.12). The results of a Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the median lead concentrations 
in these two groups were statistically significantly different (X2 = 12.181, p = 0.0005). 
Children have more than double the lead concentrations observed in adults, suggesting 
that higher lead burdens are accompanied by lower life expectancies. Although 
unsurprising given the toxic nature of lead, these results suggest that lead poisoning was 
an issue for citizens of the Roman Empire, and offer the first bioarchaeological 
evidence for such a claim.  
Figure 7.12  Comparison of adult and non-adult lead concentrations. 
Adults: median = 2.6 ppm (n = 66) and Non-adults: median = 7.2 ppm (n = 110). 
It is evident from the archaeological record that there is a real failure to thrive in 
children throughout the Roman period. It is estimated that up to 50% of children died 
before the age of 10 years old, with 2040% of these not reaching one year of age 
(Carroll, 2018, 2014). It is also widely accepted that children are more susceptible to 
lead poisoning than adults as their developing bodies are prone to absorbing higher 
quantities of ingested lead (Alexander et al., 1974; Hursh and Suomela, 1968; 
Rabinowitz et al., 1976; Ziegler et al., 1978). To explore whether the high lead burdens 
characteristic of Roman individuals contributed to the high childhood mortality rates in 
the Roman Empire, lead concentrations were further compared to age-at-death (see Fig. 
7.13). A negative correlation between lead concentration and age is clearly evident, 
again indicating that individuals with lower lead burdens lived longer than those with 
higher lead burdens.  
This is particularly notable with regards to children under the age of one year. Known to 
be a prevalent demographic within Roman cemetery populations, explanations for their 
high mortality rates have ranged from malnutrition and disease to infanticide and 
exposure (Gowland et al., 2014; Mays, 1993; Pilkington, 2013). As infants under one 
year of age are the most at risk group in terms of the lethality of lead poisoning these 
results offer new insights into the previously overlooked role lead may have had in 
these high infant mortality rates. Unfortunately, little research has been done to 
understand how lead concentrations in tooth enamel reflect in vivo lead burdens, or how 
they correlate to manifestations of lead poisoning during life (Grobler et al., 2000; 
Rabinowitz et al., 1993). As such, identifying high lead concentrations in archaeological 
remains alone is unlikely to be sufficient to determine those who may have succumbed 
to lead poisoning. However, using modern clinical literature and the known biochemical 
pathogenesis of lead toxicity it may be possible to further elucidate the effect of lead 
poisoning on the health of archaeological populations.

median = 3.2 ppm (n = 12) and Adults: median = 2.6 ppm (n = 66). 
7.5.2 Lead and disease 
 Lead is an insidious poison and the gradual accumulation of the metal in bodily tissues 
becomes increasingly toxic. Due to the systemic nature of lead poisoning, the clinical 
manifestations of toxicity are varied and complex. With the exception of growth plate 
lead lines visible on radiographs, no specific skeletal lesions have been associated with 
lead poisoning (Smith et al., 2015). This is most likely due to the toxicodynamics of 
absorbed lead culminating in clinical manifestations that are common to many other 
disease processes. However, with its propensity to disrupt metabolic pathways, it is 
unsurprising that both modern and historical clinical literature associate lead poisoning 
with a number of metabolic diseases, such as rickets, scurvy and anaemia (Caffey, 
1938; Waldron, 1966). Therefore, it is probable that individuals who died suffering the 
ill effects of chronic lead poisoning would exhibit pathological skeletal alterations 
consistent with these metabolic diseases. 
The presence of metabolic disease in the non-adult population was diagnosed according 
to published criteria (see Chapter 6), and examples of the pathological alterations 
consistent with metabolic disease observed in the sample population are presented in 
Figure 7.14. When compared with lead concentration data, the non-adult individuals 
exhibiting pathological alterations consistent with metabolic disease had significantly 
higher lead concentrations (median = 8.1 ppm) than those without (median = 4.9 ppm) 
(see Fig. 7.15). When compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test the difference in median 
lead concentrations between these two groups were shown to be statistically significant 
(X2 = 4.007, p = 0.0453). This supports the presupposition that skeletal markers of 
metabolic disease will manifest in conjunction with high lead concentrations, and that 
lead poisoning can be tentatively identified in archaeological human remains through 
the combination of palaeopathological and trace element analyses.

evidence of metabolic disease (excluding individuals with cribra orbitalia) and 
non-adults without pathological alterations. Non-adults with lesions: median = 8.1 
ppm (n = 25) and Non-adults without lesions: median = 4.9 ppm (n = 35) 
To investigate any patterns regarding the types of metabolic diseases likely to be 
concurrent with high lead burdens, lead concentrations were further compared by type 
of disease (see Fig. 7.16). Both rickets (median = 10.7 ppm) and scurvy (median = 8.1 
ppm) are accompanied by higher median lead concentrations than individuals with no 
evidence of disease (median = 4.9 ppm). However, when compared using a Kruskal-
Wallis test only the rachitic group have statistically significantly different lead 
concentrations to individuals without disease (X2 = 3.841, p = 0.0209). These results 
indicate that the elevated levels of environmental lead pollution characteristic of the 
Roman period did have a negative impact upon childhood health. Lending support to 
the hypothesis that anthropogenically induced increases in lead exposure throughout the 
Roman Empire was deleterious to health, especially in those exhibiting high lead 
burdens coupled with palaeopathological evidence of metabolic disease. As such, it is 
likely that lead exposure was a contributing factor to the ill health and failure to thrive 
seen in many non-adult Roman skeletal populations.

disease. Rickets: median = 10.7 ppm (n = 6), Scurvy: median = 8.1 ppm (n = 11), 
Rickets and scurvy: median = 5.7 ppm (n = 8), Cribra orbitalia: median = 3.0 ppm (n = 
19) and No disease: median = 4.9 ppm (n = 35) 
7.5.3 Cribra orbitalia 
Cribra orbitalia is a descriptive term used to describe abnormal pitting and porosity on 
the external surface of the orbital roofs. Presence of this rather distinctive pathological 
lesion has been observed in skeletal remains from multiple time periods across the 
world, and is typically used as a marker of general health and nutritional status (Steyn et 
al., 2002, 2016; Walker et al., 2009). Since the early 1960s bioarchaeologists have 
theorised that the pathological alteration was a result of hypertrophy of the red bone 
marrow, and therefore provided unequivocal proof that an individual suffered from 
anaemia (Carlson et al., 1974; Stuart-Macadam, 1987). Active cribra orbitalia is only 
seen in non-adult individuals due to a shift in the bodys centres for haemopoiesis away 
from the cranial vault and long bone medullary cavities to vertebral bodies and sterno-
costal regions after adolescence. As a result, adult individuals usually only ever exhibit 
an inactive form of the lesion in various stages of healing (Lewis, 2007; Stuart-
Macadam, 1992; Walker, 1986).   
The sensitivity of the haem system to extremely low lead concentrations (see Chapter 4) 
makes lead-induced anaemia a common symptom in those afflicted by lead poisoning. It 
is the omnipresence of anaemia in the clinical literature associated with lead poisoning 
that makes the skeletal manifestations of the disorder a popular target in 
bioarchaeological studies exploring lead exposure in past populations. Indeed, for 
decades studies have tried to identify lead poisoning in archaeological human remains 
by attempting to correlate lead concentrations with the presence of cribra orbitalia 
(Facchini et al., 2004; Gle-Haduch et al., 1997; Millard et al., 2014; Zaria et al., 2016). 
Despite the commonality of anaemia in those suffering from lead poisoning, the 
majority of bioarchaeological studies have found no correlation between the presence of 
cribra orbitalia and high lead concentrations. The results of this study were no different. 
In fact, individuals with cribra orbitalia exhibited lower median lead concentrations 
(median = 3.0 ppm) than individuals without the lesion (median = 4.9 ppm) (see Fig. 
7.17). Statistical comparison using the Mann-Whitney U test confirmed that there was 
no significant difference in lead concentrations between individuals with cribra orbitalia 
and those without (U = 241, p = 0.09894). This is likely due to the aetiology of the 
lesion itself. Therefore, it can be concluded that cribra orbitalia should not be included 
as an indicator of lead toxicity in bioarchaeological studies attempting to identify 
individuals that suffered from lead poisoning. Furthermore, these results highlight the 
importance of understanding not only the biochemical pathogenesis of lead poisoning, 
but also the often-complex aetiologies of the pathological skeletal alterations used to 
assess the impact of lead exposure on the health of past populations.

orbitalia and non-adults without pathological alterations. Cribra orbitalia: median = 
3.0 ppm (n = 19) and No lesions: median = 4.9 ppm (n = 35). 
7.5.4 Poison or paucity? 
Rickets and osteomalacia is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D (Brickley et al., 2018; 
Mays and Brickley, 2018; Pilz et al., 2019). Vitamin D is important for the 
gastrointestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, both of which are integral to 
the development of healthy bone mineral (Ortner, 2003; Resnick, 2002). A deficiency in 
this vitamin disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of these minerals, resulting poorly 
mineralised bones. The skeletal manifestations of which include diffuse pitting, flaring 
of metaphyses and softened bones prone to pathological bowing if weight bearing 
(Mays et al., 2006; Ortner and Mays, 1998; Resnick, 2002). Although vitamin D can be 
acquired through diet (mainly oily fish and some animal fats), the majority of the pro-
hormone is synthesised during exposure of the skin to sunlight (Pearce and Cheetham, 
2010). More often than not, poor nutrition or socio-cultural practices such as swaddling 
or restricted outdoor activities are proposed as explanations for the presence of rickets 
in non-adult individuals from past populations throughout Europe (Brickley et al., 2014; 
Giuffra et al., 2015). While the cause of rickets may well be limited to these socio-
cultural and nutritional aetiologies, it appears that environmental pollution may have 
been overlooked. It seems unlikely that a lack of UVB exposure or access to sufficiently 
nutritious foods could be the sole cause of high prevalence rates throughout the Roman 
Empire, especially in Mediterranean regions where sunlight and vitamin D-rich 
foodstuffs such as fish were plentiful (Marzano, 2013). Despite this, environmental 
factors such as pollution are rarely considered, and when they are it is usually only in 
reference to the smog that frequently plagued 19th-century urban populations (Hardy, 
2003; ORiordan and Bijvoet, 2014; Wallach, 2014). However, it is notable that the 
historical literature and bioarchaeological evidence from the Roman period and 19th 
century demonstrate high prevalence rates for rickets, and are also the two periods that 
created significant peaks in environmental lead pollution (Patterson, 1965; Roberts and 
Cox, 2003). 
Roberts and Cox's (2003) diachronic study of disease prevalence in Britain 
demonstrates how the developments in industry, agriculture, trade and cultural practices 
that came with the Roman occupation of Britain also brought about the first instances of 
scurvy, rickets and osteomalacia. Like most archaeological studies of metabolic disease 
the authors go on to describe how these maladies were most likely a result of increased 
urbanisation and reduced crop quality (Roberts and Cox, 2003). However, they do 
briefly mention evidence for lead pollution but do not elaborate on any consequence this 
might have had upon health (Roberts and Cox, 2003, p. 389). That work goes on to 
demonstrate a decrease in the prevalence of metabolic diseases in the early medieval 
period, as societies moved away from the socio-economic practices characteristic of 
Roman populations and back towards a simpler, rural way of life (Higham, 2004; 
Roberts and Cox, 2003). During the 19th century, which brought about a second surge 
in industrial development and widespread urbanisation as the industrial revolution took 
a hold of Britain, prevalence rates of metabolic diseases, especially in children, 
significantly increase from those seen in previous periods (Newman and Gowland, 
2017; Ortner, 2003, p. 393; Pettifor, 2003, p. 543; Pinhasi and Mays, 2008, p. 220). The 
parallels that can be drawn between the prevalence rates of rickets and levels of 
environmental lead pollution during both the Roman period and the 19th century are 
striking. Bringing about the question, could anthropogenic lead pollution have been a 
contributing factor to these disease prevalence rates? Whilst it must be acknowledged 
that disease prevalence is often multi-factorial and correlation does not mean causation, 
lead poisoning should be included in the differentials when the aetiology of rickets is 
being considered during these periods. 
The clinical literature is filled with case studies detailing individuals that presented with 
rickets induced by lead poisoning (Caffey, 1938; Chisolm et al., 1955; Holt, 1923; 
Hunter, 1977), and so it is unsurprising to find that rachitic children had the highest 
median lead concentrations (median = 10.7 ppm) of any subgroup in this study. 
However, what was unexpected were the low lead concentrations observed in the adult 
individuals exhibiting skeletal evidence of healed rickets (median = 1.2 ppm). This 
group of individuals had the lowest lead concentrations observed in this study; with 
median concentrations half that of those observed in adults with no evidence of disease 
and almost six times lower than the median lead concentrations of those with active 
rickets (see Fig. 7.18). Comparing these medians using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed 
that there was a statistically significant difference in lead concentrations of those with 
rickets and those with healed rickets, as well as individuals showing no skeletal 
evidence of metabolic disease (X2 (2) = 5.991, p = 0.0052). 
Figure 7.18  Comparison of lead concentrations from rachitic individuals and 
individuals with no pathological alterations. Rickets: median = 10.7 ppm (n = 6), 
Healed rickets: median = 1.2 ppm (n = 5) and No lesions: median = 4.9 ppm (n = 35). 
While there is no doubt that living conditions, status and the quality of foodstuffs play a 
significant role in the prevalence of these diseases; the results of this study clearly show 
a correlation between increased lead burdens and the presence of rickets in Roman 
period children. This indicates that the exploitation of lead and its products during this 
period contributed to the high prevalence rates of the disease throughout the Empire. 
These results, alongside the analogous fluctuations in rickets prevalence rates and levels 
of environmental lead pollution through time strengthen the argument for the inclusion 
of lead exposure when considering the cause of rickets in populations with known high 
levels of exposure. It is interesting that adult individuals with skeletal alterations 
consistent with healed rickets have the lowest childhood lead concentrations of any 
subgroup included in this study. As vitamin D promotes the absorption of lead in the 
gastrointestinal tract, these individuals may represent those with a nutritional deficiency, 
which acted as a buffer against the acquisition of lead. Conversely, the rachitic 
individuals with high lead concentrations may have exceeded the blood lead threshold 
at which the enzymatic conversion of vitamin D into is active form is disrupted, thereby 
initiating a lead-induced deficiency in the vitamin. If this could be verified through 
further research it would provide the potential to differentiate between rickets induced 
by lead poisoning and rickets caused by nutritional paucity. This would allow 
archaeologists to more precisely assess how peoples' interactions with their environment 
impacted upon their health, as well as gain a more accurate representation of 
populations nutritional statuses. Of course, there will inevitably be overlaps in rachitic 
children with low lead concentrations or adults with high childhood lead concentrations 
as the toxicodynamics of lead poisoning and how it relates to lead concentrations in 
archaeological remains is complex and poorly understood. So while these results in no 
way suggest that all rachitic children in Roman cemetery populations are exhibiting 
lead-induced manifestations of the disease and all those with healed rickets were 
protected against lead poisoning, it does indicate that lead exposure is likely 
contributing to the high number of individuals with the disease during this period. 
7.6 Summary 
It is clear from the results discussed above that the pairing of osteological and lead 
concentration analyses provide a wealth of information pertaining to the socioeconomic 
status and general wellbeing of archaeological populations. This study offers the first 
international comparisons of childhood lead concentrations from Roman period 
individuals. The results show that lead concentrations vary both between and within 
countries. The wide ranges in concentration values exhibited in these populations 
highlights the unpredictability of lead burdens even in environments shown to be highly 
polluted with the toxic metal.  The factors influencing lead exposure levels and 
absorption rates are clearly multifarious and complex, lead burdens are not just simply 
linked to how polluted an individuals environment is. This fact is highlighted by the 
results of this study, which demonstrates how variable lead burdens were within an 
empire notorious for high levels of lead pollution.  The only consistency across all sites 
was that individuals who died during childhood had higher lead concentrations than 
individuals that survived into adulthood. 
With regards to health and mortality, these results provide the first bioarchaeological 
evidence that lead poisoning may have been deleterious to childhood health. There is 
strong evidence to suggest that anthropogenic lead pollution contributed to the high 
prevalence rates of metabolic diseases, especially rickets, seen during the Roman period. 
Analysis of lead concentrations in rachitic individuals also revealed that nuances in the 
aetiology of the disease (caused by nutritional paucity or pollution) could be elucidated. 
Comparisons with age-at-death also implicate elevated lead concentrations in the high 
infant mortality rates seen in Roman skeletal populations. The introduction of a 
bioarchaeological perspective to the decades-old debate surrounding how lead affected 
health during the Roman period offers new insights into the impact of environmental 
lead pollution on the fragility of childhood health throughout the empire.  
The proposed increased availability of lead-containing products (e.g. wine, cosmetics, 
and medicines) to wealthier, higher status individuals has led to the suggestion that 
status is an influential factor in the bioaccumulation of lead. The results of this study 
support this presupposition, with higher lead concentrations seen in Spanish individuals 
interred in mausolea as opposed to tegula graves. Making inferences about certain 
aspects of identity, such as status, are often difficult in archaeological contexts. The 
addition of an objective method such as lead concentration analysis to the current means 
of assessing status, which are often biased by our expectations (wealthier individuals are 
likely to have more elaborate burials than those of a lower socioeconomic standing), can 
only serve to enhance our interpretive capabilities.  
CHAPTER EIGHT 
Lead Isotope Ratios and Migration 
8.1 Introduction 
A main focus of this study is the use of lead isotope ratios as an additional 
discriminatory tool to further discern places of origin in archaeological migration 
studies. When using any isotope system as a tracer in human mobility studies it is 
imperative that there is a high level of confidence that the measured isotopes represent 
entirely in vivo acquisition. Unlike bone, tooth enamel has shown to be extremely 
diagenetically stable due to its dense structure and low porosity, leaving limited 
opportunities for mineral infiltration and ion exchange between the enamel and its 
burial environment.  Therefore, to ensure the integrity of the isotopic data collected only 
tooth enamel samples are analysed in this study. As isotopes are incorporated into tooth 
enamel as the tissue mineralises, this sampling strategy has restricted assessment to 
childhood movements within the Roman Empire. 
Until recently lead isotopes have received little attention in bioarchaeological studies 
(Harris et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2014; Millard et al., 2014; 
Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2005, 2010, 2014, Price et al., 2017a, 2017b, 
2017c; Shaw et al., 2016). The majority of these studies were not conducted on Roman 
populations and, with the exception of Montgomery et al., (2010), none of the studies 
included more than one skeletal population from the same time period. The analysis of 
lead isotope ratios from six Roman populations from different regions of the Roman 
Empire in this current study provides a means of assessing how well lead isotope ratios 
can discriminate between contemporaneous individuals from different countries. This 
approach is, to date, unique in bioarchaeological studies.  
This chapter presents and discusses the results of the lead isotope analysis, and has been 
separated into two sections. The first section assesses the differences in human lead 
isotope ratios between countries, working towards developing an understanding of what 
constitutes a local isotope range in different regions of the Roman Empire. The second 
section focuses on combining lead isotope data with other isotope systems and 
contextual information to determine if there is enough intercontinental variation in lead 
isotope ratios to facilitate the identification of migrants within the Roman Empire. The 
results are then discussed together (section 8.7) to present a comprehensive review of 
how lead isotope analysis of polluted populations can inform our understanding of 
migration in a population known for its movement of peoples. A detailed summary of 
the results from the isotope and osteological analyses of each individual included in this 
study is tabulated in Appendix A2.  
8.2 Cultural focusing  
The cultural focusing of lead isotope ratios in humans is a phenomenon associated with 
anthropogenic lead pollution (see Chapter 2). Bioarchaeological studies have 
demonstrated how prehistoric populations and those with limited technological 
advancements have low lead burdens accompanied by divergent isotope ratios (Budd et 
al., 2004; Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). However, later populations 
with metallurgical technologies tend to have higher lead burdens accompanied by 
homogenous isotope ratios. The Romans are one such population, with studies showing 
that individuals from the same site tend to exhibit high lead concentrations and similar 
lead isotope compositions (Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016).  
Figures 8.1a and 8.1b present 208Pb/204Pb verses 206Pb/204Pb isotope ratios grouped by 
lead concentration for each country included in this study. These plots allow 
visualisation of how patterns in thorogenic and uranogenic lead isotope ratios in human 
tooth enamel alter with increasing lead concentrations. The ovals highlighting trends in 
the data on all plots have no statistical significance and are merely to guide the reader. 
As expected for populations in anthropogenically-polluted regions, the majority of data 
points from all five countries produce linear arrays characteristic of lead ore field 
isotope ranges. Within these constrained fields (delineated by red ovals on each plot), 
lead concentration groups cluster with increasing closeness as lead concentrations 
increase. With the exception of Spain, all data points that plot outside the ovals are 
individuals with lead concentrations under 1 ppm. The individual in the Barcelona 
dataset (UF748) that plots below the rest of the Spain assemblage had a lead 
concentration of 2.37 ppm, indicating anthropogenic exposure. As individual UF748s 
207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb isotope ratios are lower than those seen in the rest of the 
Spanish assemblage it is likely that this individual was exposed to a different lead ore 
source during their childhood (discussed further in section 8.6).  
It is clear that with increasing lead concentration there is a reduction in isotope 
variability. As seen in previous studies, low lead concentrations, particularly those 
under 1 ppm are thought to represent geogenic exposure and have been shown to exhibit 
a higher degree of variability in their isotopic ranges than lead acquired through 
anthropogenic exposure (Budd et al., 2004; Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 
2010). This is best visualised in Figure 8.2, which shows 207Pb/206Pb against lead 
concentration (ppm). The lead isotope ratios that are accompanied by low lead 
concentrations spread out across the bottom of the plot. Those plotting below the 
geogenic threshold of 1 ppm (dashed line) (Montgomery et al., 2010), show the highest 
variability, and likely represent individuals who were not exposed to significant 
amounts of anthropogenic lead during their childhood. As lead concentrations increase 
the 207Pb/206Pb isotope ratios shift to the left of the plot and cluster with increasing 
closeness. The coloured lines in Figure 8.2 have no statistical significance but are 
included to enable the reader to easily visualise this trend, which appear to show the 
transition from geogenic exposure to anthropogenic exposure within a population. 
Although all individuals in this study are from 1st to 6th century AD populations within 
the Roman Empire, each location contains at least one individual with lead 
concentrations below 1 ppm. This indicates that simply living within the Roman Empire 
did not guarantee high levels of exposure despite the vast quantities of lead being mined, 
utilised and traded within its borders. Previously, lead concentrations above 1 ppm have 
been used to demonstrate that an individual is from a metallurgical population, with 
those exhibiting concentrations less than 1 ppm thought to be predominantly prehistoric 
(Budd et al., 2004; Montgomery et al., 2010). The majority of the individuals in this 
study come from multi-period cemeteries; therefore, radiocarbon dating would be useful 
here because the low-concentration individuals may actually be pre-Roman in date, or 
may reflect a temporal change in lead use throughout the Roman period. It is also 
possible that these low lead concentrations indicate a childhood spent in a rural location 
where exposure to pollution was minimal. More work on rural cemeteries is needed to 
establish an expected range of lead concentrations from low exposure regions of the 
Roman Empire. Without these clarifications the fact that 19.8% (19 of 96 samples) of 
the individuals in this study have lead concentrations below 1 ppm suggests that lead 
concentration cannot be used in isolation to separate Roman from pre-Roman 
populations.

horizontal line indicates maximum level of lead (1 ppm) that can be acquired in unpolluted individuals and the grey box

8.3 Establishing local ranges 
To facilitate the identification of migrants (outliers) within a population it is necessary 
to establish what constitutes the local isotopic range. Usually, environmental samples 
(plants, soils, water etc.) are used to define local ranges for isotope systems such as 
strontium and oxygen (Slovak and Paytan, 2012). These can either be site specific, 
taken from samples in and around the excavated area, or regional/country specific 
topographic maps (isoscapes) created by systematic sampling of large geographic areas. 
However, anthropogenic pollution makes this method difficult when creating lead 
isoscapes intended for archaeological comparisons. Lead isoscapes must not only be 
spatially specific but also temporally specific. Neither the modern isoscapes of lead in 
European agricultural soils by Reimann et al., (2012) nor the 19th century European 
isoscape by Keller et al., (2016) would reflect the human lead isotope ratios measured in 
Roman individuals. A viable alternative to this would be to use published lead isotope 
datasets from contemporary human tooth enamel of geographically constrained origins. 
This would provide the most accurate comparative dataset, as it would most closely 
reflect the combination of bioavailable sources that a population was exposed to. 
However, there is a notable lack of comparable human lead isotope data from regions of 
the Empire outside of Britain. It is therefore common practice to use published datasets 
from lead ore and lead artefacts of known provenance (coins etc.) to define the local 
ranges expected for any given country (Millard et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2010; 
Shaw et al., 2016).  
The human lead isotope data generated in this study has been plotted alongside lead ore 
isotope ratios from OXALID, an open access lead ore database, and, where available, 
data from Roman coins (Butcher and Ponting, 2014). These datasets give broad ranges 
of mineralisation (ore deposit) values for a region and have been used as proxies for the 
expected local anthropogenic lead isotope ranges in each country. The current study 
uses lead isotope ratio data for lead ores defined within specific modern national 
borders. While it is acknowledged that these borders differ from those of Roman 
provinces, and that a comprehensive review of contiguous national datasets may 
identity a fuller isotope baseline, the approach adopted here is in line with previous 
bioarchaeological studies exploring mobility using lead isotope ratios, and has proved 
effective in establishing the local anthropogenic lead isotope ratio ranges for the region 
(Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Millard et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2016). 
The graphical representation of lead data is best plotted in a way that highlights the 
spread and separation of the data points. Therefore, all data is presented in the 
conventional bivariate plots using the 204Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 
208Pb/204Pb), with the inclusion of the Stacey and Kramer (1975) growth curve for 
reference. To avoid the higher uncertainties surrounding 204Pb measurements, 
208Pb/206Pb against 207Pb/208Pb plots have often been used in archaeological literature. 
These plots benefit from higher precision, but compress the data fields. Therefore, the 
subtle variations that frequently differentiate one lead field from another may be lost. 
As these plots are commonly used in archaeological literature they have also been 
included here. Any outliers within the datasets have been described but will be further 
discussed in section 8.5.  
8.3.1 Romania 
A comparison of the Romania individuals with data from Romanian lead ore (Baron et 
al., 2011; Marcoux et al., 2002) shows how the human data forms a linear array that 
spreads to the left of the ore field (Fig. 8.3). When the data is presented using a 
207Pb/206Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb bivariate plot the Romania individuals appear to split into 
two groups (Group A and Group B), and the shift away from the Romanian lead ore 
field becomes clearer (Fig 8.4). This plot inverts the lead isotope ratios; therefore the 
Romania individuals now plot above and to the right of the Romanian ore field.  
Group A plots closely with the upper end of the Romania lead ore field indicating that 
the individuals in this cluster provide a good baseline for expected human lead isotope 
ratios in individuals with childhood origins in Romania. The individuals in Group B 
cluster loosely together, away from the Romania ore field. As all of Group A plot at the 
very edge of the Romanian ore field and Group B remains in-line with the linear array 
produced by Group A and the Romania ore field, the difference in Group Bs isotope 
ratios may be due to exposure to an additional, older Romanian lead source more 
depleted in 206Pb/204Pb than the comparative ore data plotted here. As it is currently 
unclear whether the four individuals in Group B represent migrants to Romania or 
Romanians exposed to an additional ore source, their isotope ratios should be used with 
caution when defining the local lead isotope range expected in ancient Romanian 
individuals. There is one individual that plots away from the rest of the Romanian 
assemblage; individual M160b sits in the upper right of the plot (Fig. 8.4), away from 
Group A and B. The lead isotope ratios exhibited by M160b are sufficiently different 
from the rest of the Romania individuals and Romanian lead ore as to suggest that they 
spent their childhood in a different geographic location that has older lead sources, for 
example, somewhere with Precambrian orogeny.

8.3.2 France 
A comparison of the individuals from the France assemblage with data from French 
lead ore (OXALID, 2018) and Roman coins from Gaul (Butcher and Ponting, 2014) 
demonstrates how the individuals group within the isotope field created by the French 
lead ore and coin data (Fig. 8.5). It is interesting that the lead isotope ratios from the 
France individuals plot more closely with the Roman coin data than the French lead ore 
data, both of which cluster in the centre of the French lead ore field. As outlined in 
Chapter 2, human anthropogenic lead isotope ratios are culturally focussed, clustering 
together in a narrow range reflecting the lead ore sources used by the population 
(Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). To some extent metals used in artefacts 
(in this case coins), are also culturally focussed due to the reworking of ores and metals 
(Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016), this is particularly true of Roman coins, 
which were recycled every few years (Harl, 1996). Therefore, data from artefacts of 
known provenances are likely to provide more realistic representations of the expected 
human isotope composition in anthropogenically-polluted regions. 
As with the Romania individuals, the France individuals also split into two groups. 
Group A all have lead concentrations above 1 ppm and cluster tightly together in the 
centre of the French lead ore and Gaul coin data. However, three individuals have lead 
concentrations below 1 ppm (Group B). These individuals plot close together on the 
upper edge of the French ore field (see Fig. 8.6). Their low lead burdens suggest natural, 
geogenic exposure rather than anthropogenic exposure and this probably accounts for 
lower 206Pb/204Pb isotope ratios than those observed in Group A. The Michelet cemetery 
is also a multi-phase cemetery; therefore it is possible that the difference in isotope 
ratios between Group A and B represent a temporal shift in the lead source used by the 
population. The congruency of Group As tooth enamel isotope ratios with the French 
lead ore field suggests that these human samples provide a good baseline for the 
expected lead isotope ratios in Roman individuals with childhood origins in Northern 
France. The remaining two individuals that plot away from the majority of the 
population (S394 and S854) also have lead concentrations below 1 ppm and plot outside 
the French lead ore field but within the spread of isotope ratios provided by the coins 
from Gaul. This suggests that individuals S394 and S854 were exposed to low levels of 
anthropogenic lead pollution during their childhoods, and that this was likely from an 
ore source in the Gaul region of the Roman Empire.

8.3.3 Lebanon 
There is currently no lead ore data available from Lebanon; therefore, comparative data 
from Israeli and Syrian lead ores have been used (OXALID, 2018). As these two 
countries border Lebanon to the north, south and east they are likely to have similar 
anthropogenic lead isotope characteristics. When the human samples from Lebanon 
were compared to these datasets, the majority of individuals from Lebanon plot within 
the isotope field created by the Israeli lead ore (Fig. 8.7). However, on the uranium-
derived plot, all of the Lebanese individuals plot above the Syrian lead ore (Fig. 8.7b), 
indicating that the Lebanese individuals were exposed to lead sources that had higher 
207Pb/204Pb isotope ratios relative to Syrian lead ore. This suggests that lead ore from 
Israel can be used as a proxy for the local lead isotope range for Lebanon but Syrian 
lead ore cannot.  
The majority of the Lebanon individuals plot close together within the Israeli lead ore 
field. However, two individuals (SK431 and SK1004) plot below and to the left of the 
main cluster (Fig. 8.7). How different these two individuals are compared to the rest of 
the Lebanon assemblage is best visualised using the 207Pb/206Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb bivariate 
plot (Fig. 8.8). It is clear in Figure 8.8 that SK431 and SK1004 are sufficiently different 
from the Lebanon assemblage and the Israeli lead ore as to suggest that they originate 
from a different population. With the exception of these two outliers the lead isotope 
ratios from the Lebanon individuals appears to provide a good baseline for the expected 
lead isotope characteristics of Roman individuals with childhood origins in Lebanon or 
Israel.

8.3.4 Spain 
A comparison of the Tarragona and Barcelona individuals with data from Spanish lead 
ore (OXALID, 2018) and Roman coins (Butcher and Ponting, 2014) of known 
provenance shows how the Spain individuals group within the isotope field created by 
the Spanish lead ore and coin data (Fig. 8.9). The Tarragona individuals show tighter 
clustering than the Barcelona individuals, which might be due to the significantly higher 
lead concentrations exhibited by the assemblage (see Chapter 7).  As seen with the 
individuals from France, the Spain individuals also plot more closely with the Roman 
coin data than the Spanish lead ore data, again indicating that Roman artefacts of known 
provenance provide the most accurate source of proxy data for Roman population origin 
studies.  
When the Spain data is presented using a 207Pb/206Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb bivariate plot it 
becomes apparent that there are five outliers within the assemblage (Fig 8.10). 
Individuals UF217 and UF748 from the Barcelona site plot below and to the left of the 
main Spain cluster, while Barcelona individual T3 and Tarragona individuals UF2 and 
UF14 plot above and to the right of the main group. The close correlation of the Spain 
individuals with the Spanish coin data, both of which plot in the centre of the Spanish 
lead ore field, suggests that the range of lead isotope ratios exhibited by the Barcelona 
and Tarragona individuals provides a good baseline for the expected lead isotope 
characteristics of Roman individuals with childhood origins in Spain.

8.3.5 Slovenia 
The Slovenia individuals do not have lead isotope ratios consistent with Slovenian lead 
ore (Henjes-Kunst et al., 2017). Instead the Slovenia individuals have higher 206Pb/204Pb 
and 208Pb/204Pb isotope ratios relative to Slovenian ore and therefore plot above and to 
the right of the Slovenian ore field (see Fig. 8.11 and 8.12). Although small in number 
these Slovenia individuals are an interesting assemblage. From the five individuals 
analysed, three have very low lead concentrations ranging from 0.22 ppm to 0.40 ppm, 
indicating predominantly geogenic exposure. It is possible that living in rural locations 
could account for the low lead concentrations due to the reduced exposure to pollutants. 
However, if this did account for their low lead burdens it would suggest that these three 
individuals were not local to the area as Emona (now Ljubljana) was a prosperous 
Roman city with strong links to Italy (Zupanek and Mlekuz, 2001) and therefore lead 
burdens reflecting urban living would be expected. 
With regards to the two remaining individuals labelled in Figure 8.12, JM03 had a high 
lead concentration of 509 ppm. This exceedingly high concentration is unlikely to 
represent in vivo acquisition as it would equate to a blood lead level of 509 g/dL 
(Grobler et al., 2000), and as death occurs with blood lead levels of 150 g/dL this 
value is incompatible with life (Bellinger and Bellinger, 2006). It was noted during 
sample processing that the enamel from JM03 was soft and slightly discoloured, 
therefore, individual JM03s lead composition is most likely contaminated from the 
burial environment and must be excluded from further analysis. The final Slovenia 
individual (JM04) had an anthropogenic lead burden of 6.43 ppm and plots between 
contaminated individual JM03 and the other three individuals (see Fig. 8.12). The lead 
isotope ratios observed in this individual indicate that they were exposed to a younger 
lead source than the comparative Slovenian lead ore data plotted in figures 8.11 and 
8.12. However, as JM04 plots closely with JM03, who has diagenetic lead isotope ratios 
that reflect the local lead in the soils, it is also possible that JM04 is local.

8.4 Geographic variation 
This study has already demonstrated that Roman tooth enamel contains in vivo lead 
isotope ratios consistent with the lead ore field of the country in which the individuals 
were recovered (see section 8.3). This overlap between the isotopic composition of a 
countrys lead ore and the corresponding human data suggests that these enamel isotope 
ratios provide accurate baselines for the lead isotope ratios expected in Roman 
populations from these regions. However, it is the variations in lead isotope ratios 
between countries that will determine how useful they are in identifying the origins of 
Roman migrants. To assess the usefulness of lead isotopes in this regard, the 
relationship between tooth enamel compositions from each country is illustrated in 
Figure 8.13a and 8.13b. In both plots the data spread creates a linear array, with the 
individuals from countries with younger geology (e.g. Lebanon and Romania) plotting 
to the top right of the plot and those from countries with older geology plotting further 
down towards the left (e.g. France). Although there is some degree of overlap between 
the countries, there are also subtle separations between populations. The plot displaying 
only uranium-derived lead (Fig. 8.13b) provides the clearest visualisation of these 
differences.

Analytical error shown to 2 sd. 
Statistical methods to identify outliers have not been applied to the lead isotope ratio 
datasets generated in this study. Sayre et al., (1992) state that any data plot that shows 
significant separation between data points or groups of data points provides sufficient 
evidence that there is a difference between them. This is supported by other authors who 
propose that if lead isotope ratio data point separations are graphically obvious there is 
no need to resort to statistical methods (Baxter, 1999, p.123; Scaife et al., 1996, p.306). 
Furthermore, Pernicka (1993, p.259) goes on to suggest that applying any statistical 
methods would likely lead to an overinterpretation of the data. As such, statistical 
methods to identify outliers within bioarchaeological lead isotope ratio datasets are not 
used. Instead individuals that fall outside known country sources (e.g. ore data, artefacts 
of known provenance), or plot visually far away from the majority of the group have 
been identified as outliers (Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 
2016). The same method has been applied in this study, and once the visually different 
outliers (see section 8.3) from each population have been removed it becomes clear that 
the data separates into three distinct groups (see Fig. 8.14). The lead isotope ratios from 
the Slovenia, Romania and Lebanon individuals make up the first group, plotting 
closely together in the top right of the plot (red oval, Fig. 8.14). These individuals 
exhibit higher 206Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb isotope ratios than the Spain and France 
individuals. The Tarragona and Barcelona individuals exhibit lower 206Pb/204Pb isotope 
ratios than the Slovenia, Romania and Lebanon individuals, plotting closely together to 
the left of group one (blue oval, Fig. 8.14). The third group contains the France 
individuals (orange oval, Fig. 8.14); these individuals have similar 206Pb/204Pb isotope 
ratios to the Spain individuals but lower 207Pb/204Pb isotope ratios than the other 
populations. The four France and three Romania individuals that do not conform to this 
trend are the Group B, low lead burden individuals described above in section 8.3 and 
are not expected to plot closely with lead ore isotope ratios. 
By grouping the data in this way it becomes apparent that there are two major trends in 
the dataset, and these trends also extend to previously published data from Roman 
populations (see Fig. 8.15). Two lines have been added to Figure 8.15 to visually help 
the reader see these trends. These lines have been placed where the majority of the data 
from Atlantic European and Mediterranean regions (red line) or Eastern and Western 
regions seperate (blue line). Firstly, the data produces two parallel linear arrays, 
separated by the red line (y = 1.6296x + 0.7053) on the plot. All of the data points 
below this red line are individuals buried in Atlantic European regions such as Britain, 
Northern France and Germany, while all of the data points above the red line are 
individuals from central European and circum-Mediterranean regions. This trend 
appears to relate to major European orogenic events (see Fig. 8.16), during which lead 
ores are often formed (BlichertToft et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2018). The human data 
from European regions formed during the Hercynian (c. 280  380 Ma) and Caledonian 
(c. 390  490 Ma) events plot below the red line, while the data from regions formed 
during the Alpine event (c. 60  2.5 Ma) plot above the red line. This demonstrates that 
Roman tooth enamel lead isotope composition relates to the geological age of the ore 
bodies being exploited in their cultural sphere, and can be useful in determining the 
provenance of outliers within a skeletal population.  
The blue line (y = -7.25x + 8.216) in Figure 8.15 highlights the second trend in the data. 
Here the data separates into two groups, with the individuals from eastern European 
countries (Lebanon, Romania and Slovenia) plotting to the left of the blue line and the 
western European countries (Britain, France, Spain and Italy) plotting to the right. Both 
of these trends are also reflected in the lead ore data from the corresponding countries. 
The tendency of lead ore fields to spread over a wide range of values means that there is 
often overlap between lead ore fields from different countries. Due to this overlap, 
which is evident in both tooth enamel and lead ore data, it is clear that lead isotope 
ratios are not country specific. Nevertheless, this data does demonstrate that lead 
isotope ratios can be useful in distinguishing between broad regions of Europe, such as 
Eastern vs. Western Europe or Atlantic vs. circum-Mediterranean Europe. However, it 
is important to note that neither of the lines annotating Figure 8.15 represents an 
absolute separation between regions, but rather provide an indication of an individuals 
likely origin. These four suggested lead provinces illustrated in Figure 8.15 provide a 
preliminary classification system for Roman lead isotope data and will need to be 
further tested and refined as more data becomes available in the future.

8.5 Comparing lead and strontium  
Strontium isotope analysis is a well-established method for investigating mobility and 
has been extensively used to identify non-locals in archaeological studies (Budd et al., 
2001; Chenery et al., 2010; Evans et al., 2006; Montgomery et al., 2011, 2010; 
Valentine et al., 2015). However, similar terrains are found throughout Europe, which 
often renders strontium isotope ratios insufficiently unique enough to differentiate 
between countries (Evans et al., 2012). In Roman populations, however, lead exposure 
is dominated by anthropogenic not geogenic sources, therefore lead isotope ratios in 
tooth enamel may show different patterns of variability across Europe than strontium 
isotope ratios. A difference is likely to be seen as strontium isotope ratios have been 
proven to be a useful discriminant in short-distance migration studies, especially in 
regions with heterogeneous geology, while lead isotope ratios are much more adept at 
identifying outliers in long-distance migration studies. Although no strontium isotope 
ratio data for the Slovenia individuals was obtained, strontium isotope ratios from the 
remaining four sites has been analysed to assess its variability across the Roman Empire 
and compare its effectiveness at identifying migrants with that of lead isotope ratios. 
To explore the variability of lead isotope ratios between countries and in comparison to 
strontium isotope ratios, box and whisker plots have been used to illustrate the 
differences between sites. These plots provide an easy way to visualise the variation in 
ranges and central tendencies of the lead and strontium isotope measurements taken 
from each site. As can be seen in Figure 8.17, each country exhibits a smaller range in 
strontium isotope ratios than lead isotope ratios. The central tendencies of strontium 
(Fig. 17a) also exhibit less variability between countries (range = 0.00114) than the lead 
isotope ratios. The smaller variability in strontium isotope ratios between countries is 
likely to be due to the similar geology found across large expanses of Europe, and 
influenced by the bias in the dataset as a large proportion of the individuals analysed 
were from regions with carbonate geology (limestone, chalk etc.). Of the lead isotope 
ratios measured, the central tendencies of 208Pb/204Pb (Fig. 17b) show the most 
variability between countries with a range of 0.3703, while 207Pb/204Pb (Fig. 17c) show 
the least variability (range = 0.04102). This pattern of variability suggests that lead 
isotopes may provide a better means of differentiating between countries than strontium. 
Figure 8.17  Box and whisker plots showing the variances and central tendencies of the strontium and lead isotope ratios from 
each site.  
Analysis of the strontium isotope ratios revealed that the Romania, France and 
Barcelona individuals have 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios that cover a broad range (see Fig. 
8.18). The relatively wide spread of strontium isotope ratios in all three of these sites 
reflects the complex geology in these regions.  With the exception of Barcelona, which 
also has areas of Cretaceous limestone, each of these regions have predominantly 
Palaeozoic (Cambrian and Devonian) and pre-Cambrian sediments with granitic 
intrusions (see Figs. 8.19 - 21), these types of terrains typically produce high 87Sr/86Sr 
isotope ratios between 0.71101  0.78000 (Voerkelius et al., 2010). Conversely, the 
Tarragona and Lebanon individuals exhibit a narrower range of lower 87Sr/86Sr isotope 
ratios (see Figs. 8.18) consistent with the Quaternary and Mesozoic limestone terrains 
that dominate these regions (see Figs. 21 and 8.22). This split in the types of terrain at 
each site is clearly evident in Figure 8.18 with the inclusion of the seawater value 
(dashed black line), here there is a clear separation of the individuals from regions with 
a predominantly limestone geology and those from predominately silicate regions. 
The majority of individuals have strontium concentrations (ppm) below 160 ppm 
(median value = 111 ppm), however, 16 individuals have higher concentrations of up to 
261 ppm (see Fig. 8.18). A notable feature of those with strontium concentrations above 
160 ppm is that they are all from coastal cities. The high strontium concentrations found 
in seawater may have contributed to these high enamel concentrations as the close 
proximity of Tarragona, Barcelona and Beirut to the coast will have resulted in the 
regions being subject to sea-spray, marine-derived rainwater and even the use of 
marine-derived fertilisers (kelp, seaweed etc.) to grow crops, all of which would 
increase the concentration of bioavailable strontium (Montgomery et al., 2003).

concentration (ppm) from the tooth enamel. Analytical error is within the

To explore mobility within this sample group the data from each site has been plotted 
separately, on conventional 87Sr/86Sr vs. Sr ppm plots (see Figs. 8.23  8.26). In the 
absence of regionally specific bioavailable strontium ranges for each site, the estimated 
local ranges have been defined by 2 sd from the mean of the combined enamel 
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios (Bentley et al., 2004; Price et al., 2002). The majority of 
individuals plot within the estimated local ranges for their respective assemblage, 
however there are three outliers, one from each of the Barcelona, France and Lebanon 
populations.  
Both the Barcelona outlier (individual T8, see Fig. 8.26) and the France outlier 
(individual S745, see Fig. 8.24) have higher 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios (0.71157 and

0.71294 respectively) than the rest of their respective populations. Although T8s 
strontium isotope ratio remains within the bioavailable range suggested by Voekelius et 
al., (2010) for north-eastern Spain, T8 is sufficiently different from the rest of the 
assemblage as to suggest that they had childhood origins in a different region with 
upper Palaeozoic sediments and Mesozoic metamorphic rocks. Areas such as this could 
include Andorra or the border between France and Spain. The high strontium isotope 
ratio exhibited by the France outlier is within the bioavailable range for France 
identified by Goude et al., (2012), aand is indicative of older Palaeozoic terrains and can 
be produced in very few locations in France (Voerkelius et al., 2010), most of which are 
located along the borders with Spain and Italy in the Pyrenees and Alpine mountain 
ranges. The outlier in the Lebanon assemblage (individual SK1004, see Fig. 8.25) has a 
lower strontium isotope ratio (0.70764) than the rest of the group. Although this 
strontium isotope ratio is still consistent with the bioavailable range for Israel identified 
by Hartman and Richards, (2016), as well as the Mesozoic limestone of the region, this 
geology is also common across large expanses of Europe. Therefore, although SK1004 
has a strontium isotope ratio consistent with the geology found in Beirut it is 
sufficiently different from the rest of the Lebanon population to suggest that they 
originate from a different population.  
It is notable to note that the strontium isotope ratios from this dataset identified fewer 
outliers than the lead isotope ratios, and that two of the three strontium outliers were not 
identified as outliers within the lead isotope dataset (see Table 8.1). This suggests that 
applying the combination of lead and strontium analyses can improve our ability to 
assess mobility within Roman populations.

8.6 Identifying migrants across a continent 
Of the 96 individuals in this study, 11 exhibit strontium or lead isotope ratios that 
suggest that they did not originate from the same geographical region as the other 
individuals in their respective populations. These 11 individuals are discussed below. 
8.6.1 Romania  
There was only one outlier within the Romania population, a middle adult male 
(M160b) with a low lead burden of 0.23 ppm. This low lead concentration suggests 
exposure to geogenic sources of lead and therefore should not be expected to conform 
to the isotopic signature of the Romanian ore field. Geogenic lead isotope ratios do not 
relate to anthropogenic lead isotope ratios as they derive from the local underlying 
geology, whereas anthropogenic lead isotope ratios reflect the geological age and 
composition of the lead ore body that has been exploited (Faure, 1986). Therefore, 
interpreting these geogenic lead isotope ratios in archaeological populations is difficult 
due to widespread environmental lead pollution (Evans et al., 2015). The extensive lead 
mining and metalworking throughout history has caused contamination of soils, 
swamping any local geogenic lead isotope ratios and replacing them with lead isotope 
ratios consistent with exploited lead ore bodies (Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al., 
2010; Gulson, 1986). Although some studies have shown that burial soil leaches can 
provide a guide to the expected geogenic lead isotope ratios for the local area (Budd et 
al., 2000; Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010), soil samples from each of the 
sites within this study were not available, therefore soil leaches could not be carried out 
to assess the local geogenic lead isotope composition for the local region. 
As can be seen in Figure 8.28, M160b has lead isotope ratios much lower than the rest 
of the Romania population, and plots away from almost all of the comparative human 
lead isotope data from Roman populations across the Empire. The only other individual 
to plot close to M160b is France outlier S394, who also has a lead burden less than 1 
ppm. There is currently no method for comparing the isotopic composition of 
archaeological human remains with a countrys geogenic lead signature due to 
anthropogenic environmental pollution not only during the Roman period, but also the 
19th century industrial revolution and again in the 20th century with the introduction of 
leaded petrol (Brnnvall et al., 1997; Lee and Tallis, 1973; Renberg et al., 2002, 2001). 
As this individual has a strontium isotope ratio consistent with the rest of the Romania 
population (see Fig. 8.27), it is difficult to ascertain whether the lead composition of 
this individual represents a migrant to Romania or the expected isotope ratios for 
Romanian locals with predominantly natural lead exposure. 
8.6.2 France 
There are three isotopic outliers within the France population. Two of these individuals 
(S394 and S854) stood out due to their low lead isotope ratios, which were not 
obviously consistent with the rest of the France population and the French ore field. 
Individual S394 was an old adult female with a lead burden of 0.78 ppm and individual 
S854 was a middle adult probable female with a lead burden of 0.70 ppm. As with the 
Romania outlier, these low lead concentrations suggest exposure to predominantly 
geogenic lead sources and are unlikely to conform to the isotopic signature of the 
French ore field. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether these individuals are 
migrants to France or French individuals from rural areas of France with minimal 
exposure to anthropogenic lead sources. The strontium isotope ratio for individual S394 
could not be obtained, however S854s strontium isotope ratio (0.70935) is consistent 
with the majority of the France population and the expected values for the region. 
Although the lead isotope ratios of these two individuals appeared to suggest migrants 
to France, their low lead burdens indicate minimal exposure to anthropogenic lead 
sources and therefore may in fact be locals from a rural location where exposure to lead 
would be limited 
The third outlier, individual S745 was an old adult probable male with an elevated 
strontium isotope ratio relative to the rest of the France population. The high strontium 
isotope ratio of 0.71294 constrains possible origins to older Cambrian and Precambrian 
terrains found in predominantly mountainous regions of Europe. Lead analysis 
demonstrated that S745 had an anthropogenic lead burden of 1.78 ppm and plotted with 
Group A of the France population, within the centre of the French ore field. Although 
S745 has lead isotope ratios consistent with French ore, when compared to 
contemporaneous individuals from other regions of the Roman Empire, S745 also plots 
with Romano-British individuals at the upper end of the Mendips ore field (see Fig. 
8.28). There is overlap between the upper end of the British ore field and the lower end 
of the French ore field, making it difficult to determine a region of origin solely on 
S745s lead isotope ratios. However, the isotopic composition of this individual does 
suggest childhood origins in areas of Western Europe with older Hercynian or 
Cambrian ores, such as Britain, France or northwest Spain. Adding S745s strontium 
isotope ratio to this interpretation narrows down possible childhood origins to the 
Pyrenees and Alpine regions in France or areas of Palaeozoic sediments in north and 
western Britain (Derry, 1980). 
8.6.3 Lebanon 
Individual SK1004 was a young adult male, dated to the early 1st century AD (pers. 
comms. V. Kalendrian). This individual has a low lead burden of 0.50 ppm, which 
suggests geogenic lead exposure rather than anthropogenic exposure. Lebanon did not 
become part of the Roman Empire until Pompey the Greats conquest in BC 64 (Doyle, 
2012, p. 12). It is plausible that the early date of SK1004 could account for his low lead 
burden as Lebanon was still a relatively new region of the Empire and may not yet have 
developed the high environmental lead pollution seen in other countries under Roman 
rule. Previous research examining an Iron Age population from Lebanon has 
demonstrated that pre-Roman mining and metallurgy did not result in people from this 
region acquiring high anthropogenic lead burdens (Beherec et al., 2015). Therefore, the 
early data could explain the low lead concentrations seen in SK1004, which as seen in 
British populations, are more consistent with pre-Roman populations exposed to 
predominantly natural lead as well as the lower lead isotope ratios exhibited by this 
individual in comparison to the rest of the Lebanon population.  
The second outlier within the Lebanon population is SK431, an old adult female dating 
from the 2nd  3rd century AD (pers. comms. V. Kalendrian). SK431 has a higher lead 
burden of 2.62 ppm, which is indicative of anthropogenic exposure. This individuals 
lead isotope ratios are lower than the rest of the Lebanon population and plot outside the 
Israeli lead ore field used as a proxy for the expected Lebanese lead isotope range. 
When compared with contemporaneous human isotope ratios from other regions of the 
Roman Empire, SK431 plots closer to the lead isotope ratios obtained from 
Mediterranean individuals from Spain and Italy (see Fig. 8.28). Although SK431s 
strontium isotope ratio (0.70839) is consistent with the Lebanon population, it is also 
similar to the strontium isotope ratios obtained from regions such as Spain, Greece and 
Italy. 
8.6.4 Spain 
Lead isotope analysis of the Spain population highlights five possible migrants 
(Barcelona individuals UF217, UF748, T3 and Tarragona individuals UF2, UF14). 
These five individuals have anthropogenic lead burdens ranging between 2.37 ppm and 
20.3 ppm, and plot away from the main group of Spanish individuals (see Fig. 8.28). 
Barcelona individual UF748, a middle adult of indeterminate sex, plots below the other 
Spain individuals, with lead isotope ratios more consistent with regions of older 
Hercynian, Cambrian or Precambrian geology rather than the Alpine orogeny found in 
eastern Spain. Comparisons with human data from other regions of the Roman Empire 
show how individual UF748 plots with contemporaneous humans from England and 
France. The second possible migrant, Barcelona individual UF217, was a middle adult 
female interred within a mausoleum. Like the majority of the Spain individuals, UF217 
had lead isotope ratios consistent with contemporaneous individuals from regions of the 
Empire with Alpine orogeny. However, UF217 had higher lead isotope ratios than the 
Spain assemblage and therefore plots to the left of the Spanish field, and with the 
individuals from Eastern Europe (see Fig. 8.28). Although UF217 has a strontium 
isotope ratio (0.70806) consistent with the Spain assemblage it is also characteristic of 
large areas of northern Europe. The isotopic composition of this individual suggests that 
they are a migrant to Spain and likely spent their childhood in Eastern Europe. 
The three other possible migrants, Tarragona UF2, UF14 and Barcelona T3, all exhibit 
low lead isotope ratios that plot close together, above and to the right of the Spain 
assemblage, close to France outlier S854 (see Fig 8.28). As these individuals plot a 
considerable way from the rest of the Spain assemblage they appear to be migrants to 
Spain. However, their lead compositions are consistent with Alpine orogeny, which is 
found in eastern Spain, and have lead isotope ratios that plot within the upper end of the 
Spanish ore field. The strontium isotope ratios for these three individuals are also 
consistent with other Spanish individuals and Spains geology. The dates through which 
the Barcelona and Tarragona necropolises were in use (3rd  6th centuries AD) affords 
the possibility that these individuals may highlight a temporal shift in the predominant 
source of lead used by these Spanish populations. Therefore, it is possible that these 
three individuals although different to the majority of the Spain population may not be 
migrants to Spain from another region of the Roman Empire but rather migrants to the 
Catalonia region of Spain from another area within the country. Radiocarbon dating 
these three individuals could potentially provide additional information about how 
Roman lead use changed within a country and inform our understanding of how 
temporally specific local baselines of lead isotopes may be. Finally, individual T8, a 
middle adult female from the Barcelona assemblage had lead isotope ratios consistent 
with the anthropogenic Spanish range; however she has a higher strontium isotope ratio 
than the rest of the Spanish assemblage (see Fig 8.27). Although this individual still 
plots within the suggested bioavailable strontium range for Barcelona by Voerkelius et 
al., (2010), T8s isotope ratio is sufficiently different from the rest of the Spanish 
population as to suggest that they come from a different population. Taking into account 
this individuals lead isotope ratios, it is likely that individual T8 had childhood origins 
in another region of Spain with Middle Upper Palaeozoic sediments and Mesozoic 
metamorphic rocks. This could include mountainous regions such as northern Spain 
near the border with France or possibly Andorra.

8.7 Isotopic investigations of intrusive burial rites 
Variations in burial practices have informed archaeological interpretations of past 
societies for centuries, and have been used to reconstruct almost every aspect of life 
from ethnicity and status to religion and gender (Ekengren, 2013). While any direct 
relationship between burial practices and geographic origins have long been disputed 
(Pearce, 2000), the unusual nature of such Roman burials raises questions about their 
identities and whether they share any commonalities with each other. This section 
presents the results of the multi-isotopic analysis of six Roman skeletons recovered in 
Musselburgh, Scotland, and two lead coffin burials excavated in Ilchester and York, 
England. It aims to ascertain the geographical origins of these individuals, which have 
been afforded unusual burial rites within an Empire known for the widespread 
movements of people, and to test the four suggested lead provinces identified in this 
study (see Fig 8.15). 
8.7.1 Lead coffin burials 
Social status has often been interpreted using archaeological evidence such as funerary 
and epigraphic data (Buzon and Judd, 2008), and it has been shown that burial type can 
often be a good indicator of social status  (Hope, 2009). It is thought that cheaper 
burials, those that simply place the body in the ground or use plain wooden coffins, 
represent people with limited economic resources and are therefore, by extension, low 
status, while more elaborate burials using coffins made of lead or stone represent higher 
status individuals with the means to pay for more elaborate burials (Hope, 2009; 
Redfern and DeWitte, 2011; Toynbee, 1996). Lead coffin burials from Romano-British 
contexts have predominantly been found in urban locations, which follows the 
distribution of wealth within the province at the time and therefore lends support to the 
assumption that individuals afforded a lead coffin burial are of higher status (Toller, 
1977). However, the rarity of lead coffin burials from Romano-British contexts raises 
questions about the identity of the individuals afforded such an elaborate and 
presumably expensive burial rite.   
Here the isotopic compositions of four Roman coffin burials from different locations in 
England (see Fig. 8.29) have been compared. Two of the individuals, a 4th century 
female from Ilchester and a 4th century male from York were analysed during this study, 
while previously published (Montgomery 2002; Montgomery et al. 2010) strontium 
and lead isotope ratio data from a 4th century female from Spitalfields, London, and a 
4th century male from Eagle Hotel, Winchester, have been included for comparison. In 
the case of the York individual, oxygen isotope data was also available (provided by N. 
Wilson, pers. comm.) and has been included to help constrain possible regions of origin. 
Although published work using the same techniques employed in this study have 
demonstrated that disparate lead isotope ratios can be obtained from a lead coffin and 
the individual interred within it (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010), 
contamination from the burial environment is always a concern. Therefore, lead 
samples from the Ilchester and York lead coffins were also analysed to assuage any 
doubt about the origins of the lead measured in the tooth enamel. The isotope ratios 
obtained from the two lead coffin individuals and their corresponding coffin samples 
are presented in Table 8.2. No isotope data is available for the lead coffin from 
Winchester, therefore the lead isotope ratios obtained from a dentine sample from this 
individual has been used as a proxy for the coffin composition. Previous analysis of 
this sample demonstrated a lead concentration of 1540 ppm, which has been interpreted 
as contamination from the burial environment and likely representative of the isotopic 
composition of the lead coffin within which the individual was interred (Montgomery, 
2002).

8.7.1.1 The lead coffins 
With the exception of the Winchester dentine sample, all of the lead coffin samples 
plot within a tight cluster of points located within the expected ranges for British lead 
ore, at the upper end of the Mendips ore field data. The Winchester dentine sample 
plots further down, but still within the Mendips ore field (see Fig. 8.30). All four coffin 
samples plot within the bottom right lead province (see Fig. 8.30) indicating lead 
isotope ratios consistent with a region of Atlantic Europe with 
Hercynian/Cambrian/Precambrain orogeny. This is congruent with British lead ore. 
Thus, indicating that the lead used to construct all four coffins was sourced from 
southern Britain. Previous studies that have analysed Romano-British lead coffin 
burials at Poundbury Camp, Dorset (Molleson et al., 1986) and Spitalfields, London 
(Montgomery 2002) have also demonstrated that the lead used to construct the coffins 
originated from English ore sources. Importing lead would have been an expensive and 
unnecessary endeavour considering the vast quantities of lead mined in Britain during 
this period (Toller, 1977). Therefore, it is unsurprising that people were utilising the 
readily available resources in southern Britain.  
Comparisons of the tooth enamel lead isotope ratios with those from the lead coffin 
samples confirms that the lead measured in the tooth enamel represents in vivo lead 
acquisition (see Fig. 8.30). Although the Ilchester female has lead isotope ratios similar 
to those of her lead coffin, the fact that the other three individuals exhibit in vivo 
isotope ratios markedly different from their respective coffins leaves little reason to 
suspect that the Ilchester individuals does not do the same. All four individuals 
underwent identical sampling and processing procedures therefore it is likely that the 
isotope ratios obtained from the Ilchester female represent a childhood spend in Britain 
rather than post-mortem contamination from the burial environment.

characteristics. Mendips ore field data taken from Haggerty et al. (1996) and circum-Mediterranean data from Butcher and 
Ponting (2014) 
8.7.1.2 Investigating origins 
The individual from York had a high 18OVSMOW(p) value (20.0), which falls  outside 
the expected range for Britain (see Fig. 8.31) and thus indicates origins in a region with 
a warmer climate or lower altitude than Britain. There have been very few Romano-
British individuals reported with values as high as this, with only three individuals from 
London exhibiting higher values (Redfern et al., 2016). Three individuals from York, 
Driffield Terrace (6Drif- 21: 19.8 and 3Drif-26: 22.9) and Trentholme Drive 
(TDC710: 19.7), have similarly high 18OVSMOW(p) values and have been interpreted 
as migrants to Britain from either a southern Mediterranean region of Europe or North 
Africa (Leach et al., 2009; Mldner et al., 2011). The isotopic and aDNA results from 
individual 3Drif-26 offer compelling evidence for origins in the Middle East 
(Martiniano et al., 2016). The corresponding drinking water value (18O(dw)) for this 
York lead coffin individual is calculated as -3.0 +/- 1.0, which also suggests a 
childhood spent in a southern Mediterranean or North African region of the Empire 
(Longinelli and Selmo, 2003; Lykoudis and Argiriou, 2007). While the high value 
obtained for this York individual does suggest origins in a warm, arid environment, 
previous migration studies in the Nile Valley and Nubia have demonstrated 18OSMOW(p) 
values significantly higher than that seen in this Roman individual (Dupras and 
Schwarcz, 2001; Iacumin et al., 1996; White et al., 2004). This does appear to rule out 
areas of North Africa such as Egypt and Sudan, however with large expanses of the 
continent without available comparative data, other provinces of the Roman Empire in 
Northern Africa may still be viable locations.  
Figure 8.31  Bivariate plot showing 87Sr/86Sr against 18OVSMOW(p). The black box 
represents the UK range for 18OVSMOW(p) ( 2 sd) and the shaded area represents 
the UK range for 87Sr/86Sr (Evans et al., 2012). Comparative Roman York data 
from: Driffield Terrace (Mldner et al., 2011); Trentholme Drive and The Railway 
(Leach et al., 2009); Catterick (Chenery et al., 2011).  
The strontium isotope ratio (0.71094) obtained from this York individual is common in 
many areas of the Roman Empire but does exclude limestone and basalt terrains found 
in large regions of North Africa and the Middle East. Although the strontium isotope 
ratio obtained from the York male sits within the expected range for Britain (see Fig. 
8.31) it is slightly more radiogenic than the smaller strontium isotope range suggested 
for the Vale of York (between 0.7084 and 0.7102) (Chenery et al., 2011; Leach et al., 
2009). However, this value is also associated with a range of Cenozoic terrains found 
extensively throughout Europe (Chenery et al., 2010; Evans et al., 2010). Therefore, 
despite being consistent with the British range, in combination with the high 18O value 
obtained for this individual, a childhood spent outside of Britain is most likely.  
The use of lead isotopes to investigate the origins of this individual does help constrain 
possible areas of origin further. In Figure 8.32 the York individual has been plotted 
alongside lead ore data from broad regions of the Roman Empire, previously published 
Romano-British human tooth enamel results and the human data generated in this study. 
As with the oxygen isotope values, the lead isotope ratios appear to rule out a childhood 
spent in Britain, with isotope ratios plotting away from the main cluster of 
contemporaneous British individuals in the lower end of the circum-Mediterranean lead 
ore range established by Butcher and Ponting (2014) and within the Israeli and 
Romanian lead ore fields. This York individual has higher 207Pb/206Pb lead isotope 
ratios than those seen in North African lead ores, which plot lower than the York 
individual (see Fig. 8.32), indicating exposure lead sources older than those observed in 
North African lead ores. The lead isotope ratios obtained from this York individual plot 
within the upper left lead province (see Fig. 8.30), indicating exposure to 
anthropogenic lead ore in a region of central or circum-Mediterranean Europe with 
Alpine orogeny. 
The York individuals isotope characteristics are inconsistent with origins in North 
Africa and the Levant as archaeological individuals from these areas are reported to 
have much higher oxygen and lead isotope values than those seen here (Dupras and 
Schwarcz, 2001; Iacumin et al., 1996; Martiniano et al., 2016; White et al., 2004).  The 
female lead coffin burial recovered from Spitalfields, London, has a similar strontium 
isotope ratio to this York individual, and, after comparison with isotope data from three 
individuals from Rome, has been interpreted as having possible origins in Italy 
(Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). However, the isotope characteristics of 
the York individual seem inconsistent with origins in Italy. The oxygen value obtained 
from this individual is higher than those expected for mainland Italy (IAEA/WMO, 
2006 in Evans et al., 2012; Longinelli and Selmo, 2003), and although both the 
Spitalfields female and the York male have lead isotope ratios indicative of origins in a 
region with Alpine orogeny, the lead isotope ratios exhibited by the York individual are 
higher than those seen in individuals from Rome. The isotope characteristics obtained 
from the York lead coffin burial indicate that this male is a migrant to Roman Britain, 
likely from a region of the Empire with a warmer, drier climate. Although the strontium 
isotope ratio obtain from the tooth enamel is relatively common across Europe, the 
addition of lead and oxygen isotope results suggest that a childhood spent in areas of 
Eastern Europe (Crowder et al., (in press). 
The isotopic composition of the Ilchester individual is much less varied. This individual 
has a similar strontium isotope ratio (0.7089) to the Winchester lead coffin individual 
(0.7092), both of which are consistent with the Mesozoic terrains found in England and 
large expanses of Europe. The lead isotope ratios for both of these individuals are also 
consistent with childhood origins in Britain, as both individuals plot within the expected 
ranges for British lead ore (Fig. 8.32). 
8.7.1.3 Conclusions 
It is evident from the disparate isotopic characteristics obtained from the tooth enamel 
of these intriguing burials that they spent their childhoods in very different locations. 
The Ilchester female and the Winchester male appear to have British origins, however, 
the possibility that they are second-generation migrants cannot be ruled out. Conversely, 
the Spitalfields female and York male are likely migrants to Britain with isotopic 
compositions indicative of a childhood spent in warmer regions of the Roman Empire. 
These results suggest that lead coffin burials in Britain were not a rite reserved 
exclusively for migrants. A few individuals from dispersed regions of the Empire as 
well as locals appear to have been interred in this way. What these results do reinforce 
are the multicultural nature of societies within the Roman Empire and the tenuous link 
between burial rites and birthplace origin.

8.7.2 Decapitation burials 
Musselburgh is home to one of the largest known Roman settlements outside of a fort in 
Scotland (Jones, 2012), consisting of both military and civilian settlement types 
(Thomas, 1988). Given its coastal location and prominent position on Dere Street 
(Hanson and Breeze, 1991; Shotter, 1996), Musselburgh was likely a key part of the 
supply network providing provisions to the military sites built along the Forth-Clyde 
isthmus (Breeze, 2006; Jones, 2012; Whittaker, 2002). In an area thought to be a prime 
location for the convergence of people from diverse locations, intrusive burial rites here 
raise questions about the geographic origins of the unusual individuals. This is 
especially true, considering the sites close proximity to the Antonine Wall, a large 
military presence in a location with no history of previous occupation on such a scale 
(Tipping and Tisdale, 2005). 
Several of the Roman skeletons excavated from Musselburgh display evidence of 
trauma, with at least four of the skeletons exhibiting trauma patterns consistent with 
decapitation (Anderson, 2011). Although not a common burial rite in Scotland, 
decapitation burials have been identified in other Roman period contexts (Philpott, 
1991; Tucker et al., 2014). Decapitation burial is a common minority rite in Roman-
Britain (Tucker et al., 2014, p.213), and at sites where it has been identified, the crude 
prevalence rate is approximately 510% (Mldner et al., 2011; Philpott, 1991; Roberts 
and Cox, 2003) with the majority of examples dating to the 4th century AD (Philpott, 
1991). However, at the late Roman (2nd  4th century AD) cemetery at Driffield Terrace, 
York, close to 80% of the predominantly male skeletons exhibited evidence for 
decapitation. However, there is currently no consensus as to why this is the case 
(Martiniano et al., 2016; Montgomery et al., 2011; Mldner et al., 2011). It has been 
theorised that decapitation was a form of post-mortem burial ritual (Mattingly 2006, 
p.478; Timberlake, 2007, p.57; McKinley and Egging-Dinwiddy, 2009, p.58; Taylor 
2008; Jones, 2003). However, a review of the osteological evidence has demonstrated 
that a large number of individuals was decapitated as a mechanism of death either as a 
live sacrifice or judicial execution (Tucker et al., 2014, p230). 
The isotope ratios obtained from these six Roman Musselburgh individuals are 
presented in Table 8.3; one Iron Age individual from the same site is also included to 
establish the local human isotope range. Figure 8.33 shows the Musselburgh individuals 
plotted against datasets from Roman coins of known provenance (Butcher and Ponting, 
2014) and the Mendips ore field data (Haggerty et al., 1996), which provide 
comparative ranges for Mediterranean and English lead isotope ratios respectively. 
Additional Roman migration studies (Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016) and 
data collected in this study offer further comparative human data and are also included 
here.

al., in prep). This individual also had a very low lead burden which is inconsistent with 
exposure to the anthropogenic lead pollution of the Roman Empire and in line with 
prehistoric lead levels (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010). The lead isotope 
ratios from this Iron Age individual are also comparable with other prehistoric 
individuals from Scotland, indicating exposure to low level geogenic lead sources 
(Montgomery et al., 2005, 2010). Therefore, this individual provides a good baseline 
against which to compare the intrusive Roman burials at Musselburgh.

Considering the local isotope ratios provided by the Iron Age individual, it is clear that 
the Roman individuals at Musselburgh exhibit extremely variable tooth enamel isotope 
characteristics and do not appear to have originated from the Lothian area. When 
compared to other Romano-British sites, few Roman Period individuals have strontium 
isotope ratios as high as those found at Musselburgh. In fact, British values above 0.714 
are rare in all periods (Evans et al., 2012). The only individual that displays higher 
strontium isotope ratios was recorded at Driffield Terrace, York, and when considered

in conjunction with a high 18O value, it was concluded that this individual was likely to 
have originated from an area with more radiogenic geology, such as Sardinia, Corsica, 
northern Italy or northern Africa (Montgomery et al., 2011). Four of the Musselburgh 
individuals have low 18Odw values (c. 9.1) and high 
87Sr/86Sr values above 0.7120, 
which are not common within British burials. Decapitated individual PCM316 had a 
low 18Odw value consistent with origins in eastern Britain or northern Europe together 
with the high 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio indicative of a childhood spent in a region with a 
granitic terrain. However, PPCM316s lead burden was low and accompanied by lead 
isotope ratios inconsistent with Scottish ore sources (Rohl, 1996). This data suggests 
exposure to natural lead sources from younger rocks such as those found in England 
(Rohl, 1996).  Very similar lead isotope ratios have been obtained from a male burial at 
Driffield Terrace whose 18Odw value and aDNA indicate that origins in the Levant are 
extremely likely (Martiniano et al., 2016). However the high 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio and 
low 18Odw value make such origins for PPCM316 unlikely.  
The remaining three individuals (PPCM235, PPCM420 and PPCM451) with high 
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios are also linked through their lead isotope characteristics. Their 
low lead burdens indicate low level childhood exposure to anthropogenic lead pollution 
from ore sources inconsistent with those found in England. The lead isotope ratios that 
accompany these low lead burdens are more indicative of older lead ores such as those 
found in Scotland (Rohl, 1996). High 207Pb/206Pb isotope ratios, similar to those of 
PPCM235, have been observed in a small number of individuals from the Scottish Isles 
(Montgomery et al., 2010). However, PPCM235 has a higher 208Pb/206Pb isotope ratio 
than these Scottish individuals, indicating childhood origins in a geographical region 
with Alpine orogeny rather than the Cambrian orogeny found in Scotland.  
Skeletal preservation is often poor in northern Scotland and there are very few 
comparative sites with which to compare the Musselburgh individuals. Nonetheless, a 
small Beaker Period assemblage from northern Scotland exhibits the same high 
strontium and low oxygen isotope characteristics seen in PPCM235, PPCM316 and 
PPCM420 (Pearson et al., 2016).  Similar lead and strontium isotope characteristics 
have been obtained from a child excavated in Roman London. This individual is 
thought to originate from Germany (Shaw et al., 2016), and while origins in western 
Europe are certainly possible for these individuals origins within the Scottish Highlands 
cannot be ruled out.  
In contrast to the rest of the Musselburgh assemblage, individuals PPCM323 and 
PPCM630 exhibit low strontium isotope ratios more typical of Mesozoic and Cenozoic 
sediments (Evans et al., 2010). This limits the efficacy of their strontium isotope ratios 
in constraining their area of geographical origin, as these sediment types are prevalent 
throughout Europe and most of Britain. It is clear that decapitated male PPCM630 does 
not originate from the local area. Despite the rather common and therefore undiagnostic 
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio, PPCM630s 18Odw value is too high for origins in the Lothian 
area and most of eastern Britain, with a value more consistent with areas of western or 
southern Britain. PPCM630 also has the highest lead burden amongst the Musselburgh 
group, with an enamel concentration of 6.57 ppm. When interpreted in conjunction with 
the lead isotope ratios, PPCM630 plots tightly with contemporary burials from England 
(see Fig. 8.33) and within the English ore field (Haggerty et al., 1996). These results 
indicate anthropogenic exposure to English lead ore (Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery 
et al., 2010) and suggests that this individual spent his childhood within the Roman 
Empire, with likely origins in southern Britain. Conversely the low 18Odw value seen in 
PPCM323 is not common in Romano-British individuals and when considered in 
conjunction with the individuals low lead isotope ratios, it is likely that PPCM323 
originated from overseas. Indeed, PPCM323 has low 18Odw values common in central 
and Eastern Europe (Crowder et al., in press; Hakenbeck et al., 2017; IAEA/WMO, 
2006 in Evans et al., 2012), and while the low lead isotope ratios for this individual 
appear to exclude the Mediterranean as a region of origin, it is possible that PPCM323 
originates from another region of the Roman Empire. 
Using a multi-isotope approach, this study has explored the link between intrusive 
burial rites and geographic origins at the Antonine Wall frontier, and like the majority 
of human provenance studies, the results have affirmed the current understanding that a 
multifarious relationship exists between the two. The isotopic data does suggest that the 
decapitation burials at Musselburgh do not represent the continuation of a native Iron 
Age population. Furthermore, while their commonality as possible migrants to southern 
Scotland links the burials, the individuals do not appear to share a common 
geographical origin, suggesting that something more complex than a shared ethnicity 
unites the individuals. However, it is apparent that a more comprehensive understanding 
of the isotopic variation amongst archaeological populations with childhoods spent in 
Scotland is needed before non-British origins for these Musselburgh individuals can be 
confidently established. Finally it should be noted that the Musselburgh decapitation 
burials represent the earliest known examples of Roman inhumation and decapitation in 
Britain (Kirby, 2016), and their apparent ethnic diversity coupled with a shared burial 
rite reflects the cosmopolitan nature of the Roman army.  
8.8 Summary 
One of the main aims of this study was to establish what constitutes the local lead 
isotope range for Roman populations from five regions within the Roman Empire. This 
was achieved for four of the five regions included in the study, with the results 
demonstrating that Roman tooth enamel exhibits lead isotope ratios consistent with lead 
ore from their corresponding country. This has resulted in successfully establishing 
expected local lead isotope ranges for Roman individuals with childhood origins in 
Spain, France, Romania and Lebanon. These ranges provide a good baseline against 
which other isotope studies can compare their data, and should aid in the identification 
of possible geographic origins of any outliers in future Roman mobility studies.  
In each of these four countries, individuals with lead burdens above 1 ppm exhibit the 
characteristic cultural focusing and linear spread associated with in vivo isotope ratios 
dominated by lead ore signatures. This indicates that the cultural shift from 
predominantly geogenic lead to predominantly anthropogenic lead is not limited to the 
British populations in which this trend has initially been reported. Although there is an 
overlap in these anthropogenic isotope ratios between countries, the results of this study 
have shown that lead isotope ratios appear to differentiate the population on the basis of 
two features.  Firstly, lead isotope ratios can distinguish between individuals from either 
Eastern or Western European countries as individuals and lead ores provide higher 
206Pb/204Pb isotope ratios relative to samples from western European countries. The 
second feature is differentiation based on the orogenic age of the region in which an 
individual spent their childhood. Individuals from older Hercynian or Cambrian regions 
such as Britain, France and Germany have lower 208Pb/206Pb ratios than younger Alpine 
regions such as Romania, Spain or Italy. 
With regards to the Slovenian human samples which were not consistent with Slovenian 
ore isotope ratios, the small sample size of both human samples and lead ore make it 
difficult to determine whether the disparity in isotopic composition between the two is 
due to an as yet unknown end member in the lead ore field or whether the one 
individual with an anthropogenic lead burden is a migrant to Slovenia. However, as 
more enamel lead isotope data is obtained from Roman burials throughout Europe, the 
geographic origins of individuals with different lead isotope ratios will become 
identifiable with increasing confidence. 
A second aim of this study was to assess whether combining lead and strontium 
analyses could improve not only our ability to identify migrants within skeletal 
populations but also narrow down possible regions of origin. Lead and strontium 
isotopes provide different information regarding an individuals residential history. 
Strontium represents the geology of the land on which an individuals food and water 
sources originated, while lead represents the dominant ore sources exploited by a 
particular population. Therefore, both isotopic systems have the potential to identify 
different outliers within the same assemblage and when combined, increase the 
resolution at which possible origins can be suggested. The results of this study support 
this as, although the majority of outliers were identified due to their different lead 
isotopes ratios, two individuals were highlighted as outliers due to their disparate 
strontium isotope ratios. This study has found that lead isotope analysis is an asset to 
migration studies on Roman populations and that not only are more outliers found if 
more than one isotope system is analysed together, but a better resolution on possible 
childhood origins can be obtained. Therefore where possible, it is best to apply a multi 
isotopic approach when assessing migration within skeletal populations. 
CHAPTER NINE 
Conclusion and Future Directions 
9.1 Introduction 
The overarching aim of this study was to explore how exposure to anthropogenic lead 
pollution impacted upon childhood health and mortality during the Roman period, and 
what this type of exposure could tell us about geographic mobility within the Empire. It 
focused upon the use of lead isotopes as a discriminant in migration studies in an 
attempt to determine the extent of variation in lead isotope ratios between countries in a 
highly polluted archaeological population, as well as the paired analysis of lead 
concentration and palaeopathological data to explore the impact of lead exposure on 
childhood health and mortality. In this final chapter the findings of this study are 
summarised and suggestions for future work, which could be undertaken to further our 
understanding of lead concentrations and lead isotope ratios in relation to Roman health 
and mobility are given. 
9.2 Lead concentration analysis 
9.2.1 Sample variation 
An understanding of how lead is incorporated into and distributed between different 
tooth types is important not only for the interpretation of trace elemental data from tooth 
enamel, but also in how data between studies can be compared. To address this, this 
study explored the differences in lead concentrations between tooth types and tooth 
positions. The results produced here mirror those of previously published work 
(Kamberi et al., 2012; Mackie et al., 1977; Pinchin et al., 1978), demonstrating that the 
distribution of lead within teeth is non-uniform. There are undoubtedly significant 
inconsistencies in inter-dental lead concentrations with no consensus on which dental 
arcade provides the highest concentrations, or if there are any patterns to which type of 
tooth will yield the highest amount of lead. It is likely that these inter-dental variations 
in lead concentrations are population specific and reflect not only the innate 
physiological factors related to lead absorption but also an individuals level of lead 
exposure at the time of tooth formation. As an individuals exposure cannot be 
controlled for, standardising the type and position of the tooth sampled would be the 
first step towards reducing any variability driven by physiological factors and would 
therefore improve comparability between studies. However, this has the potential to be 
extremely limiting, especially in archaeological studies where skeletal preservation and 
completeness dictates which teeth can be sampled. If standardisation of tooth type were 
to be implemented, sample sizes would likely be greatly reduced. 
9.2.2 Comparing males and females   
To further understand how exposure patterns may have varied within the Roman 
Empire, differences between male and female lead concentrations were assessed. In this 
study the majority of males had higher lead concentrations than females, which was 
consistent with modern studies examining sex differences in lead burdens (Claymaet et 
al., 1991; Costa de Almeida et al., 2010; Paoliello et al., 2002). Although intrinsic 
factors such as gene expression and hormone levels have been suggested as the cause of 
these differences (Bjrkman et al., 2000; Vahter et al., 2007), studies have shown that 
the short periods of postnatal endocrine surges do not result in any differences in lead 
concentrations between the sexes. As the values obtained in this study represent 
prepubescent childhood, a time of life when the biochemistry of boys and girls is very 
similar (Bidlingmaier et al., 1975, 1973), any sex differences observed in archaeological 
lead burdens are most likely the result of differences in levels of environmental 
exposure. Thus, these results suggest that during the Roman period boys were engaging 
in a wider range of activities that facilitated higher levels of lead exposure than girls.  
A notable finding in this study was that higher lead concentrations were observed in the 
female individuals from Barcelona and Tarragona than the male individuals from the 
same sites. Although these differences were not statistically significant, they raise 
interesting questions about why Spanish individuals go against the trend seen in the 
majority of research into human lead concentrations. Archaeological studies that have 
identified this trend have attributed it to the status of the individuals (Nakashima et al., 
2007, 1998), with wealthier, higher status females thought to have increased access to 
lead containing products than lower status females. A comparison of burial rites in the 
Barcelona population (mausolea verses tegula graves) supports the presupposition that 
wealthier females have higher lead burdens than lower status females. Inferences about 
certain aspects of identity, such as status, are often difficult in archaeological contexts 
as assessments are often biased by our own expectations (i.e. grave goods). The use of 
lead concentration analysis to address questions surrounding status may provide an 
additional, objective method to the current means of assessment.  
9.2.3 Health and mortality  
This study has provided the first bioarchaeological evidence that lead poisoning may 
have been an influential factor in the poor childhood health observed throughout the 
Roman Empire. The elevated lead concentrations seen in non-adults with metabolic 
disease in comparison to non-adults without skeletal markers for disease offers strong 
evidence to suggest that anthropogenic lead pollution contributed to the high prevalence 
rates of metabolic diseases, especially rickets, in Roman populations. Analysis of lead 
concentrations in rachitic individuals also revealed that nuances in the aetiology of the 
disease (caused by nutritional paucity or pollution) could also be tentatively established. 
The negative correlation observed between lead concentrations and age-at-death also 
implicates elevated lead burdens in the preponderance of Roman infant remains present 
in skeletal assemblages, suggesting that lead exposure contributed to the high infant 
mortality rates seen in Roman populations. The introduction of a bioarchaeological 
perspective to the decades-old debate surrounding how lead affected health during the 
Roman period has provided new insights into the impact of environmental lead 
pollution on the fragility of childhood health throughout the Empire. 
9.3 Lead isotope analysis 
9.3.1 Cultural focusing 
As demonstrated in previous studies, lead concentrations under 1 ppm are thought to 
represent geogenic exposure and have been shown to exhibit a higher degree of 
variability in their isotopic ranges than lead acquired through anthropogenic exposure 
(Montgomery, 2002; Montgomery et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2016). While individuals 
with lead burdens above 1 ppm exhibit the characteristic cultural focusing and linear 
spread associated with in vivo isotope ratios dominated by lead ore signatures. As 
expected for populations in anthropogenically-polluted regions, the majority of data 
points from all five countries in this study produced linear arrays characteristic of lead 
ore field isotope ranges. Within these isotope fields there was a reduction in isotope 
variability with increasing lead concentration. This indicates that the cultural shift from 
predominantly geogenic lead to predominantly anthropogenic lead is not limited to the 
British populations in which this trend has initially been reported, and that cultural 
focusing is universal phenomenon associated with anthropogenic lead use. 
9.3.2 Establishing local ranges 
One of the main aims of this study was to establish what constitutes the local lead 
isotope range for Roman populations from five countries within the Roman Empire. 
This was achieved for four of the five countries included in the study, with the results 
demonstrating that Roman tooth enamel exhibits lead isotope ratios consistent with lead 
ore from their corresponding country. This has resulted in successfully establishing 
expected local lead isotope ranges for Roman individuals with childhood origins in 
Spain, France, Romania and Lebanon. However, it must be noted that the tendency of 
lead ore fields to spread over a wide range of values means that there is often overlap 
between lead ore fields from different countries. Due to this overlap, which is evident in 
both tooth enamel and lead ore data, it is clear that lead isotope ratios are not country 
specific. Nevertheless, this data does demonstrate that lead isotope ratios can be useful 
in distinguishing between broad regions of Europe, such as Eastern vs. Western Europe. 
Thus, the data produced in this study provides a good baseline to which other isotope 
studies can compare their data, and should aid in the identification of possible 
geographic origins of any outliers in future Roman mobility studies.  
9.3.3 Geographic variation 
Although there is an overlap in the anthropogenic lead isotope ratios between countries, 
the results of this study have demonstrated that lead isotope ratios can differentiate 
between populations on the basis of two broad features.  Firstly, lead isotope ratios can 
distinguish between individuals from either Eastern or Western European countries. The 
results of this study have demonstrated that individuals and lead ores from eastern 
European countries exhibit lead isotope ratios enriched in 206Pb/204Pb relative to samples 
from western European countries. The second feature is differentiation based on the 
orogenic age of the region in which an individual spent their childhood. Individuals 
from older Hercynian or Cambrian regions such as Britain, France and Germany have 
lower 208Pb/206Pb isotope ratios than younger Alpine regions such as Romania, Spain or 
Italy. Although lead isotope ratios are not country specific this study has demonstrated 
that they are capable of discriminating between geographical regions when other isotope 
system are not.   
9.3.4 Identifying migrants 
Different isotope systems provide information pertaining to specific environmental 
features be that geological (Sr and Pb), climate (O) or food source (C and N). With the 
overlapping of environmental parameters across significant expanses of land the 
analysis of a singular isotope system is unlikely to ever be sufficient to identify all 
migrants within a population. In this study the combined use of strontium and lead 
isotope analysis has demonstrated that not only are more outliers found if more than one 
isotope system is analysed together, but a better resolution on possible childhood 
origins can also be obtained. Therefore where possible, applying a multi-isotopic 
approach is the most effective means of assessing migration within skeletal populations. 
9.4 Limitations 
Although this research has greatly contributed to our understanding of lead isotope 
analysis in Roman populations this section discusses some of the limitations identified 
during the study, the majority of which can be addressed with future research. The 
necessarily small samples sizes due to cost, are the major limiting factor for this study. 
Firstly, the patterns observed in the lead isotope ratio data from previously studies 
regions of the Roman Empire has highlighted four lead provinces that can be used to 
constrain possible regions of origin in mobility studies. However, the sample sizes 
analysed from each region were small (n = 12), and therefore the data should be used as 
a guide for the expected lead isotope ratios for a particular region. As more data 
becomes available in the future the expected lead isotope ratio ranges for regions within 
the Roman Empire will become increasingly accurate and the four lead provinces 
suggested in this study will need to be refined. Secondly, the sample sizes available for 
comparisons between lead concetrations and status are also extremely small (n = 12). 
Althought the correlation seen in this study between lead concetrations and status are 
interesting, the small sample size is limiting. Therefore, the results cannot be used to 
infer that there are general differences in lead concetrations according to status 
throughout the Roman Empire.  
Finally, the physiological factors that underpin the acquisition of lead in deciduous and 
permanent tooth enamel need to be better understood.  This study has demonstrated that 
the inconsistencies in tooth enamel lead concentrations suggest that physiological 
factors are only partially responsible for the acquisition of lead in tooth enamel during 
life, and that cultural factors can significantly influence lead concentrations. However, 
the extent to which physiological factors influence lead concentrations in people of 
different ages and between males and females is important for the interpretation of any 
lead concentration data. Currently these processes are poorly understood and therefore 
current interpretations are limited.  
9.5 Future research 
This study has greatly enhanced our understanding of how anthropogenic lead isotope 
ratios vary geographically and how lead exposure impacted upon health. However, it is 
evident that there is much more that can be done to further our understanding of 
geographic variation in lead isotope ratios and concentrations in Roman populations. In 
the following section future directions are suggested. 
Firstly, comparison of lead concentration from rural and urban sites would be useful. In 
this study only urban sites were utilised and within these there was a wide range of lead 
concentrations. This demonstrates that not all inhabitants of the Roman Empire acquired 
lead burdens above the currently accepted anthropogenic threshold (1 ppm). By 
comparing individuals from rural environments with those from urban locations it may 
be possible to establish what the normal range of lead burdens is to be expected in 
individuals living in locations with low exposure risks. This would improve our 
interpretation of lead concentrations in Roman populations and potentially allow the 
identification of individuals who have moved from highly polluted, urban environments 
to low pollution areas such as rural settlements. From the small sample size, this study 
has provided promising results that suggest higher status is accompanied by higher lead 
concentrations. Targeted sampling of individuals of perceived high status (burials rich 
in grave goods) alongside contemporaneous individuals from supposedly lower status 
burials would help to further our understanding of how lead exposure varied with 
socioeconomic status, which would in turn provide information pertaining to any 
differences in health and wellbeing between social classes. 
Secondly, although this study has successfully established baseline human lead isotope 
ranges for four countries within the Roman Empire, more could be done to further our 
understanding of geographic variations in human lead isotope ratios. Expanding this 
work to include more countries within the Roman Empire as well as multiple sites 
within the same country would help refine the expected lead isotope range for 
individual countries and improve our understanding of regional variation across Europe. 
As more enamel lead isotope data is obtained from Roman burials throughout Europe, 
the geographic origins of individuals with non-local lead isotope ratios will become 
identifiable with increasing confidence.  
Finally, the methodology employed in this study limited the investigations into mobility 
to childhood movements. By applying lead isotope analysis to cremated remains 
investigations could be expanded to include movements during adulthood. This is 
currently untested using lead isotopes but has been successfully applied using strontium 
isotope analysis (Snoeck et al., 2016, 2015). Due to the high atomic weight of strontium, 
it does not fractionate during the cremation process and become resistant to post-
mortem alteration when the bone becomes fully calcined (Snoeck et al., 2016, 2015). As 
lead isotopes are heavier than strontium is it plausible that in vivo lead isotope ratios 
would also be preserved in fully calcined bone.  
9.6 Final conclusions 
This study has shown the effectiveness of lead isotope analysis as a tool in 
archaeological migration studies. The successful establishment of baseline ranges in 
previously unstudied regions of the Roman Empire has greatly enhanced our ability to 
identify the potential origins of isotopic outliers and has improved our understanding of 
how anthropogenic lead isotope ratios in Roman individuals varies across a continent. 
For the first time this study has also introduced a bioarchaeological perspective to how 
lead exposure affected health during the Roman period. In addition to providing strong 
evidence that Roman lead pollution contributed to the high prevalence of metabolic 
diseases during childhood, especially rickets. These results also provide the first 
bioarchaeological evidence implicating elevated lead burdens in the high prevalence of 
infant remains in Roman skeletal assemblages. Thus, offering a new narrative to 
existing debates over the cause of high infant mortality rates seen in Roman populations.
