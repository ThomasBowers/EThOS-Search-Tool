Abstract
Envenoming by the African saw scaled viper, Echis ocellatus causes 23,000 deaths each 
year in West Africa. Envenoming results in massive haemorrhagic and necrotic morbidity 
in the short term and often in permanent disfigurement and renal dysfunction in the long 
term. The only effective treatment is the administration o f  antivenom prepared from horses 
and sheep immunised with whole venom. Although life-saving, antivenoms contain 
numerous redundant antibodies that dilute the effectiveness o f  the toxin-specific antibodies. 
To address this deficiency, our group have initiated a project to develop a DNA  
immunisation strategy to generate a panel o f  toxin-specific antibodies to neutralise 
haemostasis-disruptive toxins in the venom o f  the most medically important vipers in 
Africa.
The objective o f  my research project was therefore to generate, using DNA immunisation, 
antibodies specific to the major haemostasis-disruptive toxins in venom o f  E. ocellatus. 
Because cDNAs encoding these haemostasis-disruptive toxins were not present in the 
genetic databases, it was necessary for me to create an E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA  
library to isolate cDNA sequences encoding these toxins, including snake venom  
metalloproteases [SVMPs], C-type lectins [CTLs], serine proteases and phospholipase A 2 
[PLA2S]. Utilising a PCR approach to isolate cDNAs encoding such toxins was highly 
successful and resulted in a significant contribution to the literature and genetic databases 
concerning SVMPs, PLA2 CTL and serine proteases. The deduced amino acid sequences 
o f  the E. ocellatus cDNAs encoded proteins with high overall sequence similarity to the 
viper group II PLA2 protein family, the a  and p CTL subunits in venoms o f  related Asian 
and American vipers, kinin-releasing and fibrinogen-clotting serine proteases from venom  
o f  B. jararaca  and a prothrombin-activating metalloproteinase from the venom o f  the East 
African viper, respectively. Moreover, the data obtained in this study showed that the E. 
ocellatus genome contains several, nearly identical, copies o f  these genes that differ only 
by a small number o f  amino acid residues.
The high degree o f  sequence conservation o f  these E. ocellatus toxins with analogous 
molecules from related vipers extended to the conservation o f  structural domains, 
predicted to have high immunogenic potential. Thus, my next task was to prepare DNA  
immunisation constructs from the cDNAs that encoded E. ocellatus SVMP, CTL and 
serine protease toxins. To achieve this, one o f  the cDNA sequences encoding the carboxyl- 
disintegrin cystine-rich domain [EoDC] o f  the prothrombin activator, was incorporated 
within the mammalian expression plasmid pSecTag-B. Mice immunised with the EoDC 
DNA construct responded with high titres o f  IgG. The results showed that the epidermal 
route o f  DNA delivery by Gene Gun was superior in inducing high IgG titres over 
intradermal or intramuscular injection. The cellular responses o f  the DNA immunised mice 
was not examined in this study because the ultimate intent was to generate antibodies for 
passive serotherapy and not for vaccine purposes. Furthermore, the results showed that the 
EoDC-specific antibody reacted with analogous molecules in venoms o f  a variety o f  Echis 
species. This result was predicted from analysis o f  the antigenic index profile. Thus, results 
suggest that the structural conservation o f  venom toxins from phylogenetically-distinct 
vipers can be exploited by this toxin-specific antivenom production approach to generate 
antivenoms with remarkable potential.

1.1 Introduction
The objective o f this thesis was to generate toxin-specific antibodies by immunisation 
with novel cDNA sequences encoding pathologically important toxic molecules isolated 
from a cDNA library constructed from venom gland RNA o f West African saw-scaled 
viper Echis ocellatus (E.o). The cDNA sequences involved in the DNA immunisation 
encoded C-type lectins (CTLs), a disintegrin-like (DC) domain o f the snake venom 
metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and serine proteases. These molecules have been shown to 
be responsible for the most prominent effects o f envenoming. The study also describes the 
isolation and characterisation o f other cDNA sequences encoding E. ocellatus 
phospholipases A2 (PLA2) enzymes that may contribute to the haemostatic-disruption 
which results from systemic E. ocellatus envenoming.
The African saw-scaled viper E. ocellatus, was identified a long time ago by Warrell and 
Arnett, (1976) and Pugh et al., (1979) as one o f the most dangerous snakes to mankind. It 
was found to be the most abundant (Trape et al., 2001) and medically important viper 
species in many rural areas o f West Africa (Wster et al., 1997; Habib et al., 2001; 
Molesworth et al., 2003). This species is responsible for 95% o f severe cases o f 
envenoming and very high mortality rates in the rural savannah region o f West Africa 
(Warrell et al., 1977; Meyer et al., 1997; Edgar et al., 1980).
The clinical manifestations o f envenoming by E. ocellatus show many parallels with 
venoms from related African vipers as well as from those o f the Asian and American pit 
vipers (Warrell, 1996). Bites by Echis species result in clinical symptoms which can be 
divided into two different categories; (1) localised and (2) systemic effects (Bjamason and
Chapter I: General introduction 3
Fox, 1994). The local effects at the bite site, which may appear within minutes after the 
bite are pain, swelling, echymosis, local haemorrhage and local necrosis (Hite et al., 1992; 
Warrell et al., 1977). These local effects, while being seriously debilitating, are not usually 
life-threatening. Systemic viper venom effects are life-threatening and are due to 
spontaneous bleeding and coagulopathic complications which are mainly due to 
degradation o f vascular epithelium by metalloproteinases, a decrease in coagulation 
factors (e.g., factor II, V, VIII and XIII) and an increase in the fibrin/fibrinogen 
degradation products and incoagulable blood (Edgar et al., 1980; Pugh and Theakston,. 
1987; Bjamason and Tu, 1978). The vast majority o f deaths due to snake bite in West 
Africa are due to the systemic envenoming by the saw-scaled viper, E. ocellatus, as 
opposed to any other snake.
Apart o f the small peptide disintegrin the venom toxins responsible for these 
pharmacological affects following E. ocellatus envenoming have not previously been 
identified at the molecular level. Despite their medical importance, there has been 
surprisingly little research performed on the toxin composition and constituent 
functionality o f venom from E. ocellatus (Bahrati et al., 2003; Hasson et al., 2003; Howes 
et al., 2003). A more comprehensive description o f the venom proteases and toxin proteins 
is required to fully understand their systemic and local affects and to guide improved 
therapy. The extensive literature on the related American and Asian vipers indicates that 
o f the one hundred or more constituents o f viper venoms, only a relatively small number 
o f venom toxins are responsible for the life-threatening pathological effects of 
envenoming (Markland, 1998). Confirmation o f the presence o f  this group o f toxins (i.e.,
Chapter 1: General introduction 4
SVMPs, CTLs, PLA2, Serine proteases) in the venom o f E. ocellatus was therefore my 
first priority.
Antivenom is the only effective treatment for systemic snake envenoming (Lalloo and 
Theakston, 2003). However, conventional antivenoms have many drawbacks which 
reduce their potential effectiveness to fully neutralise all the toxin molecules in snake 
venom (Theakston and Smith, 1995).
The research described in this thesis was performed to identify and isolate cDNAs 
encoding the most important E. ocellatus venom toxins for use as immunizing reagents to 
generate specific antibodies. The following sections o f this chapter review the literature on 
the medical importance o f E. ocellatus. Because so little is known about the venom 
composition o f this species, this review also describes the well characterized haemostasis- 
disruptive venom toxins o f the American and Asian vipers that are thought to be 
responsible for the systemic effects o f E. ocellatus envenoming. The chapter concludes 
with a section describing the rational and strategies o f  using immunisation with DNA  
encoding these toxins to generate a panel o f toxin-specific antibodies.
1 .2 . T he V enom ous Snakes
There are approximately 3200 species o f snakes, o f which 41% are venomous (Emmett 
and Shaw, 1995). The broad classification o f  the latter is based on fang morphology 
(Okuda et al., 2001). Although there are over 400 different species o f front-fanged snakes
Chapter I: General introduction 5
native to Africa, only a few (23%) are considered to be o f  medical importance (Warrell, 
1983; Spawls and Branch, 1995).
Glands o f all venomous snakes are situated laterally at the back o f  their head. The ducts 
from the glands connect directly to the canal or groove in the fangs. The contraction o f the 
muscles surrounding the venom glands during the process o f  striking causes venom to be 
ejected through the duct down the fangs and into the wound. Some venomous snakes such 
as the spitting cobras are capable o f projecting their venom several feet (Swaroop and 
Grab, 1954). Vipers on the other hand have two hinged mobile fangs, which become erect 
during biting, but which otherwise remain folded back against the upper jaw (Tan et al.,
1992). However, not all bites in humans result in venom being injected (McNamee, 2001).
Taxonomically, snakes belong to the Class Reptilia, Order Squamata and Suborder 
Serpentes. Venomous snakes are distributed in five families within the sub-order 
serpentes; I) Family Viperidae, which include the Old World vipers and New World pit 
vipers, II) Family Elapidae to which cobras, kraits and coral snakes belong, III) Family
Hydrophiidae which is entirely represented by sea snakes, IV) Family Atractaspididae and 
V) Family Colubridae, to which nearly two-thirds o f the known species o f  snakes belong 
and which are mainly non-venomous.
The Viperidae comprise two sub-families, the Viperinae and the Crotalinae. Viperinae are 
sometimes called true vipers and are distributed in Africa, Europe, and Asia. This sub
family is further divided into genera: Echis, Vipera, Bids, Adenorphinus, Athens, Causus, 
Cerastes, Eristicophis and Pseudocerastes Daboia, Macrovipera (Warrell, 1983; Tan et 
al., 1992).

The Echis genus o f carpet vipers is one of the most medically-important groups o f snakes 
and is responsible for the majority o f snakebite deaths and morbidity across Africa and is 
very important on the Indian subcontinent (Warrell and Arnett, 1976). Although the 
systemic taxonomy o f the Echis complex remains in despite (lenk et al., 2001), the 
classification by Drewes and Sacherer, (1974) is largely accepted in the filed. E. ocellatus 
is the subject o f this project.
1 .3  Echis ocellatus
E. ocellatus is a small, rather unimpressive snake, usually measuring between 35-40 cm 
(Fig. 1.1) but rarely exceeding a length o f 85 cm (Warrell and Arnett, 1976). Pugh et al., 
(1979) described E. ocellatus as an irritable snake which when aroused starts rubbing its 
rough, heavily keeled scales against each other by making undulating movements with its 
body which produces a rasping sound that can mistakenly be described as a hissing sound.
The fangs are long (~5mm based on observation) and mobile and it is often in a defensive 
position and quick to attack. The usual habitat ranges from savanha and semi-arid rocky 
terrain as found in Kaltungo, Nigeria to frank desert (Warrell and Arnett, 1976). Warrell 
and Arnett (1976) described residents o f the Benue valley border region o f Nigeria 
(Fig. 1.2a) as being particularly at risk to E. ocellatus envenoming. Trape and colleagues,
(2001) reported that E. ocellatus was the most abundant o f the 1280 different snake 
species collected in south-eastern Senegal. E. ocellatus is also spread widely through large
Chapter I; eneral introduction 7
areas o f the West African savannah south of the Sahara, from Senegal in the West to Chad 
in the east and possibly further east to the Central African Republic and possibly Sudan 
(Fig. 1.2b), (Wster et al., 1997).

1.4. Incidence rate o f  envenom ing
Snakebite continues to be a significant cause o f morbidity and mortality in many parts o f  
the world (Warrell, 1996), especially in tropical countries and particularly among rural 
communities o f the West and Central Africa (Laing et al., 1995; Theakston et al., 1995; 
Chippaux et al., 1998). In 1998, the worldwide mortality rate caused by snakebite was 
estimated at 125,000 deaths per year (Lalloo and Theakston, 2002). However, these 
figures are likely to be an under-estimate because snakebites tend to be neglected in 
many parts o f the world (Lalloo and Theakston, 2002). This is mainly due to the lack o f  
reliable epidemiological data, but also because ministry o f health in the developing 
countries have other more important diseases to deal with such as malaria and HIV AIDS.
E. ocellatus is an important health problem in Nigeria, Ghana and through large areas 
surrounding the rural tropics o f West Africa and is responsible for significant rates o f the 
morbidity and mortality (Molesworth et al., 2003; Edgar et al., 1980; Laing et al., 1995; 
Rugman et al., 1990). The medical importance o f this African viper has been extensively 
documented (Warrell et al., 1976; Pugh 1979; 1980; Theakston, 1976; Chippaux et al., 
1997; 1998; Trape, 2001; Enwere et al., 2000). It accounts for 85 to 95% o f the average 
annual incidence o f all envenomings by snakes in Nigeria and Ghana respectively causing 
several hundred o f deaths annually (Meyer et al., 1997; Chippaux et al., 2002). In some 
rural areas, such as in Ouagadougou in Niger, hospital records indicate that most o f the E. 
ocellatus victims were young males that occupied 74% o f the hospital bed capacity at the 
times o f greatest snake-bite incidence (Revault, 1996).
Chapter 1: General introduction 10
Epidemiological studies carried out in Nigeria and elsewhere within the region clearly 
established that the groups at greatest risk o f being bitten by this viper include subsistence 
farmers, children, hunters, herdsmen and others who have a high level o f contact with the 
snake (Pugh et al., 1980; Warrell et al., 1976; Lalloo et al., 2002; Laing et al., 1995; 
Molesworth et al., 2003). The view that snakebite is an occupational hazard is further 
strengthened by observations that the frequency o f  bites shows seasonal fluctuations 
(Pugh, 1979; Chippaux et al., 2002; Laing et al., 1995; Molesworth et al., 2003); more 
than 40% of envenomings by E. ocellatus took place when human activity is highest on 
the farms, particularly during the planting and harvesting seasons (Fig. 1.3) (Warrell and 
Arnett, 1976; Chippaux et al., 2002). Most victims are bitten on the ankle or foot whilst 
walking through their farms during daylight hours, or during hoeing, weeding, collecting 
grass, firewood, or when they walking along a path with bare feet at night (Theakston and 
Reid, 1979; Revault, 1996; Pugh et al., 1979).
An epidemiological survey o f snakebite was carried out between 1971 and 1973 at 
Kaltungo hospital which demonstrated that 76% o f the 256 annual incidents were due to 
E. ocellatus (Warrell and Arnett, 1976). The annual incidence rate o f  snakebite among the 
farming communities o f the Benue and Niger valleys (Fig. 1.2) was estimated to be 602 
per 100,000 populations with a mortality rate o f 12.3% (Pugh et al., 1979; Pugh and 
Theakston, 1987). Recent studies carried out in Bauchi State hospital in Nigeria 
demonstrated that 400 cases o f snakebites are admitted each year with 4% mortality 
(Meyer et al., 1997). In general without serotherapy or an efficient treatment, the mortality 
rate among hospitalised victims o f Echis bites can exceed 10% (Kabore and
Chapter 1: General introduction 11
Fig.1.3. Farmers during the planting season. Photograph courtesy ofWarrell and Arnett 1976
Revault, 1996; Warrell and Arnett, 1976). Although the snakebite incidence varies from 
one region to another (Enwere et al., 2000) these figures are likely to be an under
estimation and may increase over time in some countries due to improved reporting of the 
epidemiological data (Warrell, 1992; Molesworth et ah, 2003). Thus in many cases, the 
available information relates only to cases treated in hospitals and dispensaries; it is 
therefore usually not possible to judge accurately the extent of the snakebite problem.
A major problem in many rural areas is that approximately 50% of snakebite victims seek 
traditional remedies (Pugh et ah, 1979; Newman et ah, 1997) because of cultural practices, 
difficulties in obtaining transport to hospital or medical centre (Theakston and Reid, 
1979), lack of health personnel or the non-availability of antivenoms. For instance 
Newman and colleagues (1997) reported that 90% of the 147 patients bitten by snakes had 
used some form of traditional remedy prior to hospital admission. An early report by Pugh 
et ah, (1979) also illustrated that 40% of snake bite victims drink an elixir of
crushed aloe leaves (a local herbal mixture) to induce vomiting. Sixteen percent applied a 
mixture o f herbs and carried out scarification around the site o f the bite and 12% received 
local incisions (Pugh et al., 1979; Newman et al., 1997). Furthermore, some patients were 
found to drink urine (mostly their own) as a traditional remedy (Newman et al., 1997). 
Godwin et al., (2000) reported on cases where envenomed patients had used black stone 
(Fig. 1.4) [a common remedy in rural areas] as a source of traditional remedy prior to 
hospital admission. The therapeutic value of these practices is at best questionable and 
often results in the delayed arrived of the patient in a health center which greatly 
complicates conventional treatment.

1.5 Clinical features of E. ocellatus envenoming
Snake venoms in general can be characterised into two categories based on their diverse 
pharmacological effects. Neurotoxicity is the most pronounced effect of venomous o f the 
Elapidae (Leonardi et al., 2002) while envenoming by the Viperidae is normally 
characterised by local and systemic haemostasis-disruptive effects (Warrell, 1983; Laing 
et al., 1995; Leonardi et al., 2002).
Chapter 1: General introduction 13
Envenoming by E. ocellatus causes a series o f clinical complications characterised by 
local and spontaneous systemic haemorrhage which is attributed to the prominent 
destruction o f tissues and blood vessels, from sites such as fang puncture wounds (Fig. 
1.4), the gingival sulci (Fig.l.5C) and old wounds (Pugh et al., 1979; Warrell, 1983; 
Chippaux et al., 1997). Pain and swelling at the site o f the bite appear to be the most 
immediate indications o f venom absorption and activity; this may appear as early as 15 
minutes after the bite but sometimes later (Warrell, 1983); swelling may spread rapidly 
and may involve the whole limb or even extend beyond it (Fig.l.5B). A  recent study 
performed by Chippaux et ah, (1998) reported that the main clinical and prominent 
disorder observed in 223 patients who been bitten predominantly by E ocellatus were 
oedema (93.7%) and haemorrhage (48.9%). In severe cases, local necrosis can lead to 
(Fig.l.5E) (Laing et ah, 1995) permanent disfigurement and even amputation o f the 
affected limb (Ownby, 1982; Warrell, 1995; Gutierrez, 1995; 2000). Other features 
commonly observed included shock, blistering, spontaneous bleeding, renal failure, 
cardiotoxicity (Habib et ah, 2001), hypotension, echymosis and intercranial haemorrhage 
(Fig.l.5D) (Weiss et ah, 1973; Warrell, 1983). Warrell et ah, (1977) reported that results 
of coagulation assays revealed that 65% o f 136 patients showed a prolonged clotting time 
of over 30 minutes, indicating that blood incoagulability is the most sensitive and reliable 
diagnostic indicator o f E. ocellatus envenoming. Hypovolaemic shock has also been 
reported as a result o f E. ocellatus envenoming; this is caused by extravasation o f fluid 
into the bitten limb (Warrell, 1983). Shock (Fig.l.5A), vomiting, regional 
lymphadenopathy and headache have also been associated with such envenoming 
(Warrell, 1977; 1983).

bleeding, (d) haemorrhage, (e) severe haemorrhage and (f) local necrosis. Photographs curtsey o f  D.A. Warrell
Chapter I: General introduction 15
Early treatment and first aid remedies include codeine phosphate tablets to treat pain. If 
the patient develops necrosis, anti-tetanus serum (ATS) may be given in parallel with 
appropriate antibiotics to prevent secondary infection (Theakston et al., 1990; Habib et al., 
2003) depending on both the patients sensitivity to antibiotic and/or the degree o f the 
affected area (Warrell et ah, 1977; 1983; Habib et ah, 2003). Patients with haemorrhagic 
shock may require transfusion o f blood and/or fresh frozen plasma; depending on the 
availability o f antivenom and health deterioration o f the patient (Warrell, 1983). 
Appropriate antivenom should be given when available and as soon as possible.
Deaths, when they occur, are directly related to the systemic effects and/or hypovolaemic 
shock (Fig.l.5F) caused by loss o f blood into the tissues or bleeding from the brain, and 
may occur one to twelve days after the bite (Warrell and Arnett, 1976). The cytolytic 
enzymes in the venom and/or to the secondary bacterial infections, such as tetanus are 
complicating factors which may result in death if  left untreated (Warrell and Arnett, 1976; 
Warrell, 1983).
1.6 Immunotherapy and its limitations
The administration o f conventional antivenoms is the most effective and only available 
treatment for systemic envenoming. The first antivenoms were developed over a century 
ago by Henry Sewall who immunised pigeons with pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrirus species) 
venom and demonstrated that they were more resistant to subsequent venom injections 
(Sewall, 1887; Chippaux and Goyffon, 1998; Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). Calmette in
Chapter 1: General introduction 16
1887 was the first to prepare commercial antivenom for medical use against envenoming 
by the Indian cobra (Chippaux and Goyffon, 1998).
Antivenoms are currently prepared by purifying the sera o f large animals, usually horses 
or sheep, hyperimmunised with venoms from individual snake species {monospecific 
antivenom) or from a range o f different species venom of medical importance 
(polyspecific antivenom). Animals should be immunized with pools o f venom from a large 
number o f  snakes to avoid intraspecific variation. The earliest preparations o f antivenom 
consisted o f whole serum and these were later followed by whole molecule IgG 
precipitated from serum using ammonium sulphate (Pope, 1939). These antivenoms often 
led to a series o f clinical complications, including anaphylactoid reactions such as 
bronchospasm and late serum sickness reactions (Malasit et ah, 1986; Chippaux and 
Goyffon, 1998; Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). To overcome these problems, current 
antivenoms are prepared by IgG digestion with pepsin or papain to cleave the IgG 
molecule to produce refined F(ab)2 and Fab fractions, respectively (Lalloo and 
Theakston, 2003; Miller et ah, 2002). Although the use o f Fab and F(ab)2 fragment 
antivenoms were found to produce fewer adverse reactions, both o f these antivenom types 
have advantages and disadvantages.
The Fab fragment has a relatively low MW (50kDa) compared with F(ab)2 (lOOkDa). 
Therefore, Fab has a theoretical advantage over F(ab)2 because o f its rapid tissue 
penetration and larger apparent volume o f distribution (Meyer et ah, 1997). However, it is 
rapidly eliminated from the patients circulation via the kidney with a half life o f about 4 
hours (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). In contrast, F(ab)2 fragments are eliminated via 
cellular immunity such as macrophage interaction with a half-life o f 18 hours, thus
(.JupU 'r J: (>t mr<j :utroJiu. non 17
avoiding renal complications (Chippaux and Goyffon, 1998; Len et al., 2001) and being 
available for longer periods in the systemic circulation. Theoretically therefore, the longer 
the half life o f the F(ab)2 fragment, the smaller the volume o f antivenom required for 
administration (Meyer et al., 1997; Chippaux, 1998).
Apart from the poor availability o f F(ab)2 or Fab antivenoms for treating the local effects 
o f envenoming, antivenom also often suffers from deficiencies encountered during 
production. Venoms consist o f numerous molecules, many o f which are non-toxic or only 
marginally toxic. Because there is no correlation between the toxicity o f a venom 
component molecule and its ability to stimulate antibody, the most potent antibodies in 
antivenom are not necessarily targeted to the most toxic molecules (Mandelbaum and 
Assakura, 1998; Schottler, 1951). Consequently, antivenoms contain numerous redundant 
antibodies that dilute the toxin-specific antibodies (Theakston and Reid, 1983). As a result 
o f these problems it is often necessary to administrate a large volume o f antivenom to the 
patient.
In some parts o f the world (e.g., Africa) antivenom production has decreased to critically 
low levels since 1980s due to several factors. The unit cost o f the available commercial 
antivenom is often high making it expensive for the health services o f developing 
countries and individual patients. For instance an antivenom ampoule in South Africa 
costs US $35. This is expensive for Africa. The problem is exacerbated by the need to 
produce individual antivenoms for different snake species for several geographical areas. 
Overall, antivenoms are relatively expensive drugs which are needed for treating poor 
people; there is therefore very little profit in antivenoms. As a result over the past 15 years
(  ii-jpivf  / '  Ot-nerol tnirodncrivn 18
major pharmaceutical companies have decreased or cessed production (Theakston and 
Warrell, 2000; Lalloo and Theakston, 2003).
Because o f these problems production of Aventis Pasteur and SAIMR antivenoms for 
Africa has declined. Behringwerkwe stopped production in the early 1990s. As a result of 
this critical shortage o f available antivenom in West Africa patients were often given 
relatively ineffective antivenoms prepared in Iran or India; these resulted in frequent 
treatment failures in patient in rural communities, leading in a fall in hospital attendance 
and a concomitant increase in snakebite morbidity and mortality (Pugh et al., 1979; Laing 
et al., 2003). In 2000, Theakston and Warrell reported that fake antivenoms had been 
imported into Nigeria. The current state in Africa is the choice to import either non
specific and/or ineffective antivenoms manufactured in Asia and unproven and frequently 
dangerous traditional treatments (Laing et al., 2003). To overcome this problem, a 
monospecific ovine Echis Fab fragment antivenom called (EchiTab) was developed 
(Laing et al., 1995). This was found to be four times more potent than the Echis SAIMR - 
F(ab)2 fragment antivenom (Meyer et al., 1997). However, as stated earlier such Fab 
fragment have the major disadvantage o f being rapidly eliminated through the patients 
renal system (Theakston, 1997; Lalloo and Theakston, 2003).
In conclusion the lack o f adequate and regular supplies and the high cost of antivenom 
play a pivotal role in the provision effective treatment. Such problems affect attitude of 
communities to hospital treatment, and therefore influence them to seeking traditional 
remedies (Pugh et al., 1979; Lalloo et al., 2002; Laing et al., 1995; Lalloo and Theakston,
Chapter 1: General introduction 19
2003). Consequently such factors lead to a concomitant increase in snakebite morbidity 
and mortality (Laing et al., 2003).
1.7. Disruption of haemostasis by venom toxins
1.7.1 Normal haemostasis in mammalian systems.
Haemostasis is the mechanism by which both blood clotting and clot dissolution is kept in 
equilibrium by ensuring that blood fluidity in the circulation is sustained (Braud et al., 
2000) (Fig. 1.6). The normal haemostatic response to vascular damage depends on closely 
linked interactions between the blood vessel wall, circulating platelets and blood 
coagulation factors. Injuries to the endothelial lining induce changes in the vascular 
endothelial surface causing collagen exposure and thrombin production at the site o f the 
reduced blood flow as well as adherence and activation o f platelets in the presence of von 
Willebrand factor (vWf) and the local release o f procoagulant factors. Exposed collagen 
and thrombin activate prostaglandin synthesis by platelets leading to the formation of 
thromboxane A2 that triggers a series o f events leading to aggregation and adhesion of 
platelets and a change in platelet morphology from discs to spheres. These changes 
stimulate platelets to release their granular contents including, ADP, serotonin, fibrinogen, 
lysosomal enzymes and heparin-neutralizing factor (McNicol and Israels, 1999; Kini and 
Evans, 1990). Activation o f platelets and their secretions also have powerful 
vasoconstrictive ability. Release o f ADP causes platelets to swell and aggregate. This 
attracts and binds other circulatory platelets to the area o f injury. The aggregation of 
platelets also triggers a series o f cellular interactions that promote specific binding of

adhesive proteins to cell surface integrins (Scarborough et ah, 1993). The change in shape 
o f the platelets is the first step which enables fibrinogen and vW f to bind to fibrinogen- 
glycoprotein(GP) Ilb/IIIa complex receptors on the platelets membrane (Yeh et ah, 1998). 
The secretion o f ADP promotes further platelet aggregation by the binding o f GPIIb/IIIa 
[anp3] complex receptor on the activated platelets to the fibrinogen as well as to the vWF; 
these are known as RGD-binding ligands (Suehiro et ah, 1996; Kamiguti et ah, 1996a). 
This continued aggregation o f platelets results in the formation o f a haemostatic plug, 
which soon covers the exposed connective tissue (Kawasak et ah, 1996a). This unstable 
primary haemostatic plug is usually sufficient to stop or provides temporary control of 
bleeding (Kini and Evans, 1990). In the normal situation, thrombis or blood clots are 
subsequently solubilised and removed to allow tissue healing, as a negative feed back, by 
a mechanism called fibrinolysis (Kawasaki et ah, 1996; Kamiguti et ah, 1996a; Braud et 
ah, 2000).
1.7.2. Haemostasis and local haemorrhage
Bleeding resulting from Echis envenoming is caused by zinc metalloproteinases which 
enzymaticaly degrade the vascular subendothelium. Other factors which prevent the blood 
from clotting include disintegrins, prothrombin activators and factor IX/X activators 
(Kamiguti et ah, 1998).
Several studies have demonstrated that purified Crotalinae and Viperinae venom 
metalloproteinases (SVMPs) cause local haemorrhage (Kamiguti et ah, 1996b) by 
degradation o f the major components o f the extracellular matrix ECM (Matsui et ah,
Chapter 1: General introduction 22
2000) and walls o f small blood vessels. It is believed that this is caused by proteolysis of 
the components o f the basal lamina o f the microvasculature such as type IV collagen, 
fibronectin, and laminin (Rucavado et al., 1995) o f small blood vessels (Kamiguti et ah, 
1996b; Maruyama et ah, 1992; Matsui et ah, 2000; Shannon et ah, 1989). Moreover, when 
the toxins are distributed through the systemic circulation those effects spread to sites 
distant from the point o f venom injection (Marsh et ah, 1995). SVMPs specifically cleave 
the key peptide bonds o f the basement membrane and endothelial cells (Takeya et ah, 
1992; Gutirrez et ah, 2000) leading to a series o f morphological and functional alterations 
o f the endothelial cells in-vivo. In more advanced degenerative stages such as in the early 
stages o f necrosis, lysis o f the vessel wall lead to gaps in the endothelial cells through 
which blood escapes into the extravascular space (Marsh et ah, 1995; Kamiguti et ah, 
1996a: 1996b). Although the mechanism of action o f these haemorrhagic toxins is not 
entirely clear, Ownby et ah, (1993) suggested that haemorrhagic toxins can exert their 
effects by (i) lysis o f vessel wall, creating large breaches between capillary and 
endothelial cells leading to large intracellular gaps (per rhexis) and/or (ii) by slow oozing 
of blood through small gaps in capillaries (per diapedesis) leading to blood escaping into 
the connective tissue space. In addition, SVMPs have been demonstrated to inhibit platelet 
aggregation by blocking collagen binding to the (X2P1 integrin on the platelet surface 
(Kamaguti et ah, 2001; Zigrino et ah, 2002), thereby preventing platelet-assisted repair to 
injured blood vessel walls.
Chapter 1: Generai introduction 23
1.7.3. Haemostasis and systemic haemorrhage
The most characteristic effects o f envenoming by Echis species are systemic haemorrhage 
and uncontrolled bleeding brought about by interference with the thrombotic and 
haemeostatic mechanisms o f the victims (Kini et al., 2000). The entry o f SVMPs into the 
systemic circulation is thought to be responsible for the spontaneous bleeding that occurs 
in many areas o f the vasculature o f the envenomed victim. Apart from the effect of 
SVMP; uncontrolled bleeding is also thought to be influenced by other venom toxins that 
interfere with the normal functioning o f blood platelets and coagulation factors. Some 
venom toxins act as agonists and behave in a similar way to a natural ligand or activator of 
a specific step, whereas others act as antagonists and interfere in the function o f a natural 
ligand or activator (Kamiguti et al., 1996a; Kawasaki et al., 1996).
Venom molecules that interfere with blood coagulation include disintegrins, serine 
proteinases and C-type lectins (Markland et al., 1998; Kamiguti et al., 1996b). Small 
molecular weight bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) also cause hypotension, a 
common symptom in some victims o f E. ocellatus envenoming (Weiss et al., 1973; 
Warrell, 1983). These peptides inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme and enhance 
bradykinin action. SVMPs also contribute significantly to the systemic effects by their 
ability to hydrolyse the a  chain o f fibrinogen (a-fibrinogenases) which is a key factor in 
platelet aggregation (Huang et al. 2000).
In addition to the haemostatic mechanism described above the adhesion o f platelets to the 
exposed subendothelium at the site o f vascular injury involves the binding of plasma vWF 
to subendothelial tissue, followed by its binding to platelet GPIb (Sakariassen et al.,
Chapter 1: General introduction 24
1987). To date several GPIb binding proteins have been purified and characterized from 
snake venom including: alboaggregin-B from Trimeresurus a lbo labris  venom (Peng et al., 
1991J, echicetin from Echis carinatus venom (Peng et al., 1993) and agkicetin from 
Agkistrodon acutus venom (Chen et ah, 1995). Because these toxins competitively inhibit 
the binding o f vWF to GPIb, they prevent the binding o f platelets to the collagen receptor 
integrin (X2P1 (Moura-da-Silva et ah, 2001; Yeh et ah, 1996; Huang, 2000). Moreover, the 
small peptide disintegrins and the disintegrin-like domain o f the P-III SVMPs inhibit 
collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Zhou et ah, 1996; Gan et ah, 1988; Hong et ah, 
2002) and, also inhibit fibrinogen binding to anbP3 receptor o f  activated platelets (Moura- 
da-Silva et ah, 2001).
As stated above, fibrinolysis is a negative feedback system essential to dissolve thrombin 
and allow tissue healing. Some snake venoms, not Echis, contain thrombin-like enzymes 
that interrupt this system (Jin et ah, 2002). In vivo, fibrin produced by the venom proteases 
may be quickly hydrolyzed by the natural fibrinolytic system, resulting in a state of 
defibrinogenation (Markland and Pirkle, 1977). Venoms from many vipers also contain 
anticoagulant proteases with fibrinogenolytic or fibrinolytic activities capable o f directly 
rendering fibrinogen incoagulable. These include the venom o f C rotalus atrox  (Bajwa et 
ah, 1980; Pandya & Budzynski, 1984; Komori et ah, 1985; Nikai et ah, 1984), A. contortix  
m okasen (Moran & Geren, 1981), A .contortrix contortrix  (Bajwa et ah, 1982) and C. 
horridus horridus (Civello et ah, 1983).
Chapter 1: General introduction 25
1.8. Composition of snake venom
In general, the main target o f the snake venom proteins is either the normal haemostatic 
mechanism and/or the neuromuscular system o f the prey (Vishwanath et al, 1987).
Snake venoms are complex mixtures o f protein and non-protein components, secreted by 
specialised glands (Al-Saleh, 2002; Leonardi et ah, 2001; Alape-Giron et ah, 1999). 
Venom is at least 90% protein by dry weight, and most o f these proteins are enzymes 
(Warrell, 1983), toxins or nerve growth factors (Al-Saleh, 2002). The non-protein 
fractions o f the venom are mainly represented by sodium, potassium, phosphorus, 
chloride, calcium, zinc, magnesium, copper, manganese, riboflavin, nucleosides, peptides, 
lipids and carbohydrates (Al-Saleh, 2002).
1.8.1. M etalloproteinases
Generally, venoms from Viperinae and Crotalinae species exert similar local and systemic 
effects. Analysis o f their venoms indicates that the snake venom zinc-metalloproteinases 
(SVMPs) are arguably the most clinically significant group o f viper toxins (Bjamason and 
Fox, 1994; 1995; Gutierrez and Rucavado, 2000), causing major microvascular damage 
and blood loss (Borkow et ah, 1993). The presence o f metalloproteinases in venom of 
Echis species has been confirmed (Nishida et ah, 1995; Paine et ah, 1994: 1992; Howes et 
ah, 2003) and it would be expected that E. ocellatus would also posses hemorrhagic 
SVMPs.
The SVMPs are members o f the reprolysin family (Ml 3) o f Zinc-metalloproteinases 
(Zigrino et ah, 2002) and form, together with the ADAM (A Disintegrin And
Chapter I: General introduction 26
Metalloprotease), the subfamily o f metzincins because they share a common overall 
molecular organisation (Gutierrez and Rucavado, 2000; Omari-Satoh et al., 1995; Zigrino 
et al., 2002). The SVMPs range from 20 to 100 kDa proteins with strong and weak 
haemorrhagic effects (Gutierrez and Rucavado 2000; Toshiaki et al., 2000; Ito et al., 
2001). All SVMPs, irrespective o f their size contain a conserved zinc-binding motif 
[HEXXHXXGXXHD] in the catalytic domain, (Moura-de Silva et al., 1996; Selistre de 
Arujo and Ownby, 1995). The SVMPs have been classified into four classes (PI-PIV) 
(Fig. 1.7).
Class P-I SVMPs consist o f only the zymogen and MP domain without a carboxy- 
terminal disintegrin domain, and are usually about 22-30 kDa express varying degrees of 
haemorrhagic activities (Gutierrez and Rucavado 2000). The P-II class SVMPs have either 
a disintegrin (Dis) or disintegrin-like domain carboxyl to the catalytic domain (Jia et al., 
1997). The P-III SVMPs contain a cysteine-rich domain extending from the MP and Dis 
domain. Class III SVMPs include some o f the most potent haemorrhagic and haemostasis- 
disruptive snake venom toxins with pathological activities exerted by each o f the MP, Dis 
and Cys-rich domains, as discussed in the next sections (1.8.1.3-1.8.1.6). The class P-IV 
SVMPs possess all these domains and have an additional lectin-like polypeptide [e.g., 
epidermal growth factor-like (Primakoff et al., 1987), transmembrane, or cytoplasmic 
domains (Wolfsberg et al., 1993)] linked by a disulphide bridge to the metalloproteinase- 
containing polypeptide chain (Jia et al., 1996; Rodrigues et al., 2000; Gutirrez and 
Rucavado, 2000). SVMPs are structurally related to the mammalian matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP) family (Fox and Long, 1998). MMPs differ from the reprolysins 
or ADAMs in that some o f them do not possess proteolytic activity (Jia et al., 1996).

Since the amino acid sequence data of SVMPs in related New and Old World vipers show 
a high degree o f sequence conservation, particularly o f residues encoding functional 
domains and the propeptide domain (Paine et al., 1994, Bjamason and Fox, 1995), it is 
useful to describe briefly the structure-function relationship o f SVMPs.
1.8.1.1. The p rep ep tid e  dom ain
This domain is referred to as a signal peptide, which is highly conserved among SVMPs 
and comprises 18 amino acid residues with the putative cleavage site between Gly-18 and 
Ser-19 (Jia et al., 1996; Bjarnason and Fox, 1995).
Chapter J: General introduction 28
1.8.1.2. The propeptide domain
The cDNA sequence structure o f all SVMPs indicates that they are synthesised as pre- 
pro- zymogens (Gutirrez and Rucavado, 2000; Jia et ah, 1996). The nascent zymogen is 
proteolytically processed prior to secretion into the lumen o f the venom gland via a 
cysteine switch mechanism to yield the active venom enzymes (Grams et al., 1993; Jia et 
ah, 1996). The sequence o f the propeptide domain is highly conserved and comprises 
approximately 190 amino acid residues and contains the consensus sequence cysteine- 
switch motif PKMCGVTQ 23 residues upstream o f the MP domain (Matsui et ah, 2000; 
Grams et ah, 1993; Jia et ah, 1996). It has been hypothesised that the cysteine switch motif 
may serve an analogous function to that seen in MMPs which prevents zymogen 
processing (Bjamason and Fox, 1994; Grams et ah, 1993; Springman et ah, 1990; Jia et 
ah, 1996).
1.8.1.3. The metalloproteinase domain
The MP domain o f SVMPs ranges from 202 to 206 residues in length (Jia et ah, 1996; 
Hasson et ah, 2003) and differ from other member o f the reprolysin family such as the 
astacin family (Nishida et ah, 1995), by the retention o f the consensus sequence X-His-Glu- 
X-X-Hs-X-X-Qu-X-X-His involved in zinc binding (Bode et ah, 1992; Gomis-Rtith et ah,
1993). The consensus Met-tum (CI/VM) region 258-260 in the MP domain (Hasson et ah, 
2003) is thought to ensure hydrophobic interactions within protein structure and may be 
involve in the zinc-binding site (Selistre de Arujo and Ownby, 1995).
Chapter 1: General introduction 29
1.8.1.4. The spacer Region
The spacer region is represented by a short residue stretch o f  18 to 21 amino acids 
between the MP and Dis/Cys domains. It was Jia et al., (1996), suggested that the function 
of this motif may act as a linker to connect the proteinase and the disintegrin-like domains. 
Several studies based on the functional characterisation showed that this peptide region 
does not contribute significantly to the toxicity o f the SVMP (Kini et ah, 1997a).
1.8.1.5. The disintegrin-like domain
The disintegrin domain o f SVMPs is identified by an RGD sequence that is characteristic 
o f the group III SVMPs. The disintegrin domain o f the SVMPs differs from that of the 
nascent disintegrin proteins by the possession o f two additional cysteinyl residues in the 
structure (Jia et ah, 1996). The group III SVMPs, such as jararhagin (Paine et al, 1992a), 
ecarin (Nishida et ah, 1995), HRla (Kishimoto, and Takahashi, 2002), Ca: Cat (Zhou et al, 
1995), ECH-I and ECH-II (Paine et ah, 1995) contain disintegrin-like domains where the 
RGD sequences are substituted by either ECD or DCD at the same position (Moura-da- 
Silva 1996). The functional role o f this non-RGD disintegrin domain appears to be 
homologous with the small peptide disintegrin in several aspects; for instance this 
structure has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation (Kamiguti et ah, 1997; Jia et ah, 
2000; 1996). Evidence for this is strengthened by the discovery o f a non-RGD motif in the 
disintegrin domain o f mammalian sperm proteinases, including PH30-a and PH30-P, 
which binds to the integrins located on the egg surface during fertilization (Kratzschmar et 
ah, 1996, Blobel et ah, 1992).
Chapter I: General introduction 30
1.8.1.6. The cysteine-rich domain
The C-terminal cysteine-rich domain o f the SvMPs has a high percentage o f cysteine 
residues (Jia et al., 1996). Kamiguti et al., (2003) reported that the cysteine-rich domain o f  
SVMPs inhibits both platelet aggregation by binding to c^Pi integrin and adhesion o f a2- 
expressing K562 cells to this protein. Early studies by Kini and Evans (1990) and Calvete 
et al., (1992) suggested that this domain may be responsible for their protein structural and 
biological characterisation as well as the cleavage o f the putative domains.
1.8.1.7. Metalloproteinases and E. ocellatus
Despite the medical importance o f (i) E. ocellatus and (ii) metalloproteinases, it was only 
very recently that a haemorrhagic PHI metalloproteinase was purified from E. ocellatus 
venom (Howes et al., 2003). This report also described a non-haemorrhagic PIISVMP in 
E. ocellatus venom. This study did not however, describe the complete amino acid 
sequence o f either proteins. Prior to my work the genetic databases contained no DNA 
sequences encoding E. ocellatus SVMPs
1.8.2. C-type lectins
Snake venom C-type lectins (CTLs) are a group o f proteins which show structural 
similarities to the classic C-type lectins such as mannose-binding protein and the selectins 
(Navdaev et al., 2001a) and contain consensus cysteine and other amino acid residues that 
define the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) o f the animal C-type lectins
Chapter 1: General introduction 31
(Drickamer, 1999; Braud et al., 2000; Castro et al., 2003; Wang, 2001a; Sarray et al., 
2003). Snake venom CTLs consist only o f a C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain 
(CRD) in comparison to these o f the animal membrane lectins which contain additional 
domains (Giga et al., 1987).
Most o f the 30 kDa snake venom CTL proteins exist as a]3-heterodimers linked by a single 
interchain disulphide bond and possess striking sequence similarity (Harrison et al., 
2003a; Wang et al., 2001a). Despite this high degree o f sequence similarity, venom CTLs 
have distinct effects on factors in the coagulation cascade or platelet components. For 
example, some snake venom CTLs exhibit anticoagulation activities and bind to y- 
craboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing domains o f the coagulation factors IX and X in the 
presence o f calcium ions (Wang, 2001a; Atoda et al., 2002). Other venom CTLs inhibit or 
activate platelets by modulating their binding interactions to the platelet receptors such as 
glycoprotein (GP) lb, a2Pi, GPVI and vWF (Navdaev et al., 2001b; Polgar 1997; Shin and 
Morita, 1998; Wang, 2001a). An example o f such an agonist affect is represented by the 
heterodimeric protein echicetin from E. carinatus venom (Peng et al., 1993). Echicetin 
binds specifically to platelet GPIb to inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking its 
interactions with vWF or with thrombin (Peng et al., 1993; Polgar et al., 1997). In vivo 
experiments showed that echicetin induces thrombocytopenia when injected into small 
animals (Navdaev et al., 2001a). In contrast alboaggregrin-B isolated from Trimeresurus 
albolabris venom, binds to GPIb and induces platelet agglutination in the absence o f vWF 
(Peng et al., 1991).
Chapter 1: General introduction 32
C-type lectins such as bothrojaracin from Bothrops jararaca venom demonstrate another 
variant o f snake venom CTLs; these are based on its ability to interact with both thrombin 
anion-binding exosites I and II. Bothrojaracin also induces allosteric changes in the 
thrombin active site to inhibit (i) the activity o f thrombin toward fibrinogen clotting, (ii) 
aggregation o f platelets and (iii) protein C (Matsuzaki et al., 1996; Tani et al., 2002).
1.8.2.1. C-type lectins and E. ocellatus venom
Despite the medical importance o f E. ocellatus, comparatively nothing is known about the 
contribution o f CTL activity to the pathology o f E. ocellatus envenoming.
1.8.3. Serine proteases
Venom serine proteases also exhibit homologous structures with different biological 
activities such as fibrinogen-clotting (Itoh et al., 1987), kinin-releasing, (Serrano et al., 
1998), plasminogen-activating (Zhang et al., 1998), increasing o f blood capillary 
permeability (Hahn et al., 1998) and P-fibrinogenolytic (Hung et al., 1994). The 
multifunctional ability o f this enzyme family strongly suggests that serine proteases cleave 
their substrates or plasma proteins in a protein-specific manner resulting in activational or 
inhibitory effects on a variety o f mammalian physiological systems (Hutton et al., 1993; 
Matsui et al., 2000; Felicori et al., 2003).
Although no native serine proteases have been purified from E. ocellatus venom, or from 
other Echis species in general, proteolytic serine proteinases have been identified and
33Chapter 1: General introduction
characterised in venoms o f  other viperid species such as that o f Bothrops ja ra ra ca  
(Serrano et al., 1998), Trimeresaurus je rd o n ii (Samel et ah, 2002), Vipera lebetina  (Siigur 
et ah, 2001) and D einagkistrodon acutus (Wang et ah, 2001b). Serine proteases isolated 
from the B. ja ra ra c a  for example has been shown to induce diverse effects such as their 
ability to release bradykinin from kininogen-like mammalian kallikrein [kallikrein-like 
proteases] (Matsui et ah, 2000), specific activities depending on specific substrates and 
induce blood clotting (Serrano et ah, 1998).
1.8.4. Phospholipase A 2S
Phospholipases are Ca2+-dependent esterolytic enzymes, which are separated into various 
classes, namely Ai, A2, B, C, and D, based on the site o f hydrolysis (Kini, 1997). 
Phospholipases A2 are a superfamily o f enzymes which occur ubiquitously in nature and 
are usually divided into either intracellular or secreted enzymes (Kini, 1997). Secreted 
PLA2S (SPLA2S) are small, soluble proteins that have been isolated from a large number of 
biological sources, especially from the mammalian pancreatic juice, snake, scorpions and 
bee venoms (Lambeau et ah, 1994; Kini et ah, 1986; Nicolas et ah, 1995). The (13-18 
kDa) group I and II secreted venom PLA2S are the most extensively studied PLA2 
enzymes and share high sequence similarity and similar kinetic behaviour (Hendrickson 
and Dennis, 1984). Group I PLA2S are represented in the mammalian exocrine pancreas, in 
venoms of Elapidae and Hydrophidae snakes and in human spermatozoa (Langlais et ah, 
1992). Group II PLA2S are abundant in Viperidae venoms (Scott, 1997). Group II PLA2S are
Chapter 1: General introduction
subdivided further into six subgroups based on the number and location of disulphide bridges 
and the sequence of the C-terminus (Kini, 1997).
In contrast to the toxicity o f snake venom PLA2S, mammalian PLA2S mediate many 
physiological processes but appear to posses relatively weak pharmacological effects.
The general function o f PLA2 enzymes is the hydrolysis o f acyl ester bond at the sn-2 
position o f the glycerophospholipid vesicles to liberate free non-esterified fatty acids and 
lysophospholipids (Hanasaki and Arita, 1992). The term phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is used 
to denote the 2-acyl specificity o f the enzyme (Uthe and Magee, 1971). However, this 
function is not necessary applicable to all PLA2S because some snake venom PLA2S 
exhibit pharmacological effects independent o f the hydrolysis o f phospholipid (Petan et 
al., 2002; Nicolas et al., 1995; Machado et al, 1993). To date no native PLA2S have been 
purified from the venom o f the saw-scaled viper, E. ocellatus. However, several toxic 
PLA2 have been identified in venoms o f related Viperinae species [including Echis] and 
have been shown to possess oedema-inducing, neurotoxic, lipolytic and platelet 
aggregating activities (Kemparaju et al., 1994; 1999a; Polgar et al., 1996). It is well 
established that snake venom PLA2S o f related vipers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and 
the Americas contribute to venom-induced pathology through a broad spectrum of toxic 
activities as illustrated Table 1.1 (Kini, 1997).

1.8.5. Other venom components
There are other toxins which also play a pivotal role in the localized and systemic effects 
as a result o f snake envenoming. These include, hyaluronidase which is present in most 
snake venoms (Khoo, 2002); it cleaves hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan), a high molecular 
weight glycosaminoglycan and a major connective tissue constituent in animals (Cema et 
al., 2002). This results in a decrease in the viscosity o f connective tissues (Russell, 1980; 
Pukrittayakamee et al., 1988). Hyaluronidases are therefore known as spreading factors 
(Pessini et al., 2001) because they facilitate toxin diffusion into the tissues o f envenomed 
prey (Khoo, 2002), thus contributing to local and systemic envenoming (Pessini et al., 
2001). L-amino acid oxidases (LAOs) are widely found in most snake venoms (Sakurai et
Chapter 1: General introduction 36
al., 2001; Tempone et al., 2001), particularly in venoms o f Echis species (Nathan et al., 
1982) and are thought to contribute to toxicity upon envenoming by producing a- 
ketoacids, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ammonia from L-amino acids (Du and 
Clemetson, 2002; Ali et al., 2000) resulting in prolonged bleeding from blood vessel walls 
at the bite site (Takatsuka et al., 2001; Du and Clemeston, 2002). Other enzymes include 
acidic and basic phosphatases, ribonucleases, lactate dehydrogenases, deoxyribonucleases, 
nucleotidases which are thought to initiate cell apoptosis (Warrell, 1997; Russell, 1980).
1.9. DNA immunisation
DNA vaccination or genetic immunisation, a rapidly developing technology which has 
been described as a third generation o f vaccines (Dixon, 1995), offers new approaches for 
the prevention and therapy o f several diseases o f both bacterial and viral origin 
(Gurunathan et al., 2000; Koide et al., 2000). DNA immunisation has also emerged more 
recently as a strikingly novel approach to immunoprophylaxis (Ramsay et al., 1997) and 
has been widely used in laboratory animals and non-human primates over the last decade 
to induce antibody and cellular immune responses (Donnelly et al., 2003).
Successful in-vivo transfection of mammalian cells following injection o f purified DNA 
was first reported over 30 years ago (Atanasiu, 1962). However, its potential went largely 
unrealised until 1990 when Wolff and colleagues demonstrated that a reporter gene 
encoding an enzyme protein could be expressed in murine skeletal muscle in-vivo and the 
tissue retained its transgenic biological activity for up to 60 days after inoculation. These
Chapter 1: General introduction 37
observations were extended by several studies such as those o f Tang et al., (1992) who 
demonstrated that mice injected with plasmid DNA encoding human growth hormone 
(hGH) elicit antigen-specific antibody responses. Based on these findings, it is concluded 
that this technology is promising as it can enhance both cellular and humoral immunity.
1,9.2. Advantages o f  DNA vaccines
The ability o f plasmid DNA to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses after 
inoculation has been demonstrated in several animal models and hopes have been raised 
that its applications will led to new therapies for a range o f human diseases. Studies to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenecity o f  DNA vaccination in humans began within 2 
years o f the first published reports o f protective immune responses against infectious 
diseases in animals and many studies are still ongoing.
DNA-based immunisation exhibits several important advantages over conventional 
immunisation strategies that involved live-attenuated or killed pathogens, proteins, or 
synthetic peptides; it appears to incorporate many o f the most attractive features o f each 
approach. One o f the important advantages o f the DNA immunisation (Babiuk et al., 
2000a), is that the immune response to immunisation can be directed to elicit either 
humoral or cellular immune responses or both without the need for live vectors or 
complex biochemical production techniques.
Other advantages o f DNA vaccines are that they are highly specific and that the expressed 
immunizing antigen is subjected to the same glycosylation and post-translational
Chapter 1: General introduction 38
modifications as natural viral infection. Logistic advantages o f DNA vaccines include the 
relative ease and low cost o f production and transportation making them more suited to 
production in the developing world than other systems. A summary o f these perceived 
advantages o f DNA vaccines is described in Table 1.2.
1.9.2. Disadvantages o f  DNA vaccines.
The disadvantages o f DNA vaccines are based mainly on health and safety issues. Most of 
the safety issues concerning the system are based on the activation o f oncogenes as a

result o f genomic incorporation o f immunising DNA (Robertson, 1994) as well as 
eliciting anti-DNA antibodies; however, this has rarely been detected in experimental 
studies (Ramsay et al., 1997). While these issues are o f concern and require careful 
monitoring, it would not apply to DNA immunisation o f  captive animals to produce 
antibodies, particularly if  gene gun is used. This is because the likelihood o f eliciting anti- 
DNA antibodies when using the gene gun is minimised because it requires 100-fold less 
DNA than intramuscular injection to achieve equivalent seroconversion efficiencies 
(Harrison and Bianco, 2000).
1.9.3. Principles o f  DNA immunisation.
DNA vaccination involves the introduction o f nucleic acid into host cells where it directs 
the synthesis o f its encoded polypeptide(s) and stimulates an immune response (Shedlock 
and Weiner, 2000). Unlike gene therapy, genetic integration is not intended. Indeed, the 
construction o f a DNA vaccine is designed to permit localized, short-term expression of 
the target antigen.
Although several attempts have been made to study the cellular pathways for the 
processing of antigens and their presentation to T lymphocytes, the precise mechanism 
involved in the induction o f an immune response following DNA immunisation is not yet 
fully understood (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al., 2001). However, it is well 
documented that the magnitude and type o f immune response induced after DNA 
immunisation is influenced by a number o f different parameters, some o f which are 
represented by the type and components of the expression plasmid.
Chapter 1: General introduction 40
1.9.3.1 Essential components o f  a DNA Plasmid
A typical first generation DNA vaccine plasmid requires (i) the incorporation of a strong 
viral promoter to achieve optimal expression in mammalian cells (Liu, 2003), such as 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) or simian virus 40 [which provide the greatest gene expression]; 
(ii) an origin of replication (ori) allowing plasmid propagation in E.colr, (iii) a bacterial 
antibiotic resistance gene [this allows plasmid selection during bacterial culture]; and (iv) 
a transcription-stop sequence such as bovine growth hormone 3-untranslated region 
(BGH 3-UTR) (Fig. 1.8).
1.9.3.2. The influence o f  mode and site o f  gene delivery
Several studies have shown that the type of immune responses induced by plasmid 
immunisation is significantly affected by (i) the mode and site of gene delivery, (ii) the

from McDonnel and Askari (1996)
Chapter 1: General introduction 41
dose o f plasmid and (iii) the administration o f  booster injections and the interval between 
immunisations (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al., 2000). In general, immunisation 
with DNA can be accomplished in two fundamentally different ways. One approach is the 
use o f needle injection into different tissues, the most effective route being intramuscular 
injection (i.m) into the hind leg quadriceps or tibialis anterior (Seddegah et al., 1994; 
Wang et al., 1993) followed by intrademal (i.d) routes (Raz et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1996). 
These routes usually provoke strong, antigen-specific Thl-biased, humoral and cellular 
immune responses (Feltquate et al., 1997; Babiuk et al., 2000b). An improvement in 
efficacy o f plasmid transfection was achieved by injection o f DNA into regenerating 
skeletal muscle, achieved by prior injection o f  either cardiotoxin or local anaesthetic such 
as bupicaine (Donnelly et al., 2003). Several methods have been investigated to improve 
delivery o f DNA vaccines including (1) mechanical delivery consisting o f microinjection 
by various types o f needles including pressure injection, (2) electrical [electroporation, 
ionophoresis] and (3) chemical [liposomes and various polymers] (Feigner et al., 1987; 
Ramshaw et al., 1997; Ando et al., 1999; Aggarwal et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1996) and 
mucosal delivery. Each one o f these methods o f delivery introduces plasmid DNA into 
distinct areas o f immune surveillance and therefore primes the immune system in distinct 
ways.
Gene gun delivery o f DNA which propels the DNA-coated gold particles into the 
epidermis (Tang et al., 1992; Ulmer et al., 1993) resulted in a more Th2 biased antibody 
isotype response and efficient humoral and cellular responses (Feltquate et al., 1997; 
Babiuk et al., 2000b). The distinct Thl- or Th2-biased immune responses elicited by i.m 
or gene gun delivery, respectively, is not fully understood. Bacterial DNA contains CpG
Chapter I: General introduction 42
motifs that induce non-specific Thl-dominant responses. Gene gun delivery requires 100- 
1000 fold less DNA to stimulate immune responses to that achieved by i.m injection. The 
reduced number o f Thl-promoting CpG motifs involved in gene gun immunisation may 
therefore explain the Th2-bias response to gene gun DNA vaccination.
1.9.3.3. Antigen presentation fo llow ing DNA immunisation.
An important step in the design o f DNA immunisation constructs is to understand the 
immune correlates o f protection. Antigen peptides expressed after DNA immunisation are 
usually presented by antigen-presenting cells [APCs] in the context o f either MHC class II 
or class I molecules to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. There are at least three 
means by which MHC class I-restricted CTL might be elicited following administration 
o f plasmid DNA: (i) transfection o f professional APCs, (ii) antigen presentation mediated 
directly by transfected myocytes or, (iii) cross priming, (Shedlock et al., 2000) as 
illustrated in Fig. 1.9.
(i) Transfection o f  professional APCs
The immune response following DNA immunisation was found to be dependent upon 
professional APCs, specifically bone marrow-derived dendritic cells [DC] (Iwasaki et al.,
1997). In 1993, Fu and colleagues demonstrated that when parental bone marrow chimeras 
were immunised with plasmid DNA encoding influenza nucleoprotein [NP] by i.m. 
injection and gene gun, CTL responses were specific to the peptide presented by the MHC 
class I molecules found on the donor bone marrow (Condon et al., 1996) (Fig. 1.9b).
Chapter 1: Generai introduction 43
Furthermore, the same authors reported that, although only a small proportion o f the DCs 
were transfected with plasmid DNA, it was noticeable that there was general activation 
(maturation) and migration o f large number o f  DCs that had not been transfected. 
However, whether this generalised maturation o f untransfected DCs could also present 
antigen via additional mechanisms remains uncertain.
(ii) Antigen presentation m ediated directly by transfected myocytes
Ulmer et al., (1993), by demonstrating that direct intramuscular inoculation o f plasmid 
DNA induced a strong CD8+ CTL to influenza nucleoprotein, provided the first evidence 
that cellular responses could be induced in vivo by DNA immunisation and that the 
induced immune responses had a potentially important protective role. Subsequent 
experiments were then undertaken to directly test whether DNA-transcribed muscle cells 
alone are sufficient to prime immune response (Fig. 1.9a). However, Iwasaki et ah, (1997), 
reported that muscle cells failed to prime CTLs responses when injected with DNA 
plasmid encoding CD86 or GM-CSF only (i.e., without antigen). To examine the 
contribution o f both bone marrow- and non-bone marrow-derived cells to CTL priming, 
Agadjanyan et ah, (1999) found that antigen-specific CTL responses could be induced by 
non-bone marrow-derived (muscle) cells only when mice were immunised with DNA 
encoding either the antigen and CD86.
Surgical ablation experiments have been used to identify the contribution o f antigen 
expression in tissues subjected by DNA immunisation by distinct routes. Torres et ah, 
(1997) demonstrated that removing the DNA-injected muscle bundle within 10 minutes of
Chapter I : General introduction 44
DNA injection had no affect on the longevity and magnitude of humoral and CTL 
responses, suggesting a rapid migration o f transfected cells or plasmid DNA from the site 
o f injection. These authors also found that excision of the epidermal site 24 hours after 
gene gun bombardment abrogated the induction of CTL responses, suggesting that the 
immune response was dependent on the transfected epidermal cells. This finding indicates 
that i.m injected plasmid DNA is likely to gain rapid access to the lymphatic or circulatory 
system, thus obviating the need for transfection of muscle cells at the site o f injection. In 
conclusion, these data indicate that DC cells such as Langerhans and myocytes play a 
crucial role in the primary response triggered by DNA vaccines.

Chapter 1: General introduction 45
(iii) Cross-Priming
Cross priming has been suggested as a mechanism to explain antigenic transfer from 
DNA-transfected somatic cells to professional APCs (Fig. 1.9c). The concept o f cross
priming, in which triggering o f CD8+ T-cells responses can occur without de novo antigen 
synthesis within the APCs, was first described by Ulmer (1996) and Fu (1997) and 
provides an additional mechanism by which DNA immunisation can enhance immune 
responses (Shedlock and Weiner, 2000; Donnelly et al., 1997). During cross priming, 
antigens or peptides expressed by DNA-transfected myocytes or DCs presented 
in context o f  either MHC I or II can be taken up by professional APCs to prime T-cell 
responses. Thus, DNA-transfected myocytes or DCs may serve as antigen-producing 
factories which magnify and maintain the immune response via cross priming (Donnelly 
et ah, 1997; Shedlock and Weiner, 2000).
1.10. Strategy of DNA immunisation in the development of toxin-specific 
antivenoms
The remarkable advance and diverse applications o f DNA immunisation attracted the 
attention o f many researchers as an alternative procedure for analysing the structure and 
expression o f genes in general (Chattergoon et ah, 1997) and studies for improving the 
treatment o f systemic envenoming by snakes in particular (Harrison et ah, 2000b; 2002a; 
2003b; 2004).
Chapter 1: Of.mrai uurojM.uon 46
This section o f my thesis describes the rational o f using DNA immunisation as an 
alternative means o f developing toxin-specific antibodies for improving the treatment of  
systemic envenoming by the saw-scaled viper, E. ocellatus.
Conventional venom immunisation protocols have remained unchanged over the past 
century with no attempts being made to direct the immune response to specific, clinically 
important toxins. Currently, antivenoms are generated by conventional immunisation 
protocols. Although very good at inducing immune responses to highly immunogenic 
proteins or epitopes, however, these protocols do not result in the induction o f clones 
secreting antibodies to weakly reactive or to minor proteins present in snake venom as 
stated previously. This means that antivenoms contain redundant antibodies to many non 
toxic venom components which dilute the toxin specific antibodies (Theakston and Reid, 
1983). In addition, the most toxic venom components are not necessarily the most 
immunogenic; for example toxins o f low molecular weight may be toxic but poorly 
immunogenic (Mandelbaum and Assakura, 1998; Theakston, 1983b). Furthermore, the 
efficacy o f antivenom is to an extent controlled by the intraspecific variation in the venom 
batches used for immunisation. Therefore, an immunising protocol that generates toxin- 
specific antibodies is essential for increasing the dose-efficiency o f antivenoms thereby 
reducing the risk o f early anaphylactoid and late serum sickness reactions to equine and 
ovine antivenoms that have to be administered in large volumes.
Using an expression library encoding these toxic proteins combined with DNA 
immunisation protocols such as that developed by Harrison et al., (2000b) should (i) 
permit the expression o f E. ocellatus-derived cDNAs in a eukaryotic environment so that
Chapter 1: General introduction 47
the protein presented to the immune system should faithfully represent the glycosalated 
tertiary structure o f the native toxins, (ii) permit the production o f antibodies to the weakly 
immunogenic, but highly toxic, low molecular weight venom proteins. The later are often 
poorly represented in conventional antivenoms, (iii) induce a potent antibody response to 
be rapidly generated, minimal amounts o f protein expressed by DNA-transfected cells,
(iv) allow construction o f a series o f plasmids that contain epitopes from a variety o f  
medically- important toxins in the venom o f E. ocellatus, thereby inducing the broadest 
range o f responses, (v) result in a higher level o f safety because snake maintenance, costs 
and the hazards o f venom extraction to obtain immunising material are avoided, (vi) be 
better suited than protein-based systems to antivenom production in countries with poorly 
developed technical resources, because plasmid DNA is readily renewable and batch- 
batch standardised (vii) induce high titres o f venom toxin-specific IgG (Harrison et al., 
2000b; 2002a; 2003b; 2004).
1.11. Aim and objectives
My research project is part o f a research effort to generate, using DNA immunisation, 
antibodies specific to the major haemostasis-disruptive toxins in venoms o f the most 
medically important vipers in Africa (Harrison et al., 2002; 2003a; 2003b; Bahrati et al., 
2003; Hasson et al., 2003). The focus o f my research is the E. ocellatus. Before my work 
remarkably little research had been performed to characterise the venom components of 
this dangerous viper. It was therefore necessary to construct a cDNA library from venom 
gland mRNA and to isolate cDNA sequences encoding the major haemostasis-disruptive
Chapter 1: General introduction 48
molecules, including SVMPs, CTLs, serine proteases and PLA2S. The sequences of these 
E. ocellatus toxins were compared with the literature and their deduced structure 
examined to predict the potential o f antibodies generated by DNA immunisation. The 
extent to which these objectives were achieved is described in the following chapters.
Chapter 2
Materials and Methods
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 50
This chapter outlines the materials and methods used throughout the work described in 
this thesis and is divided into two major parts. The first part (2.1) describes the various 
techniques involved in the construction o f the venom gland cDNA library o f the saw- 
scaled viper E. ocellatus and the second (2.2) describes techniques frequently used in 
different stages o f the project. Where techniques were modified to suit the stage o f the 
work, those modifications are described in the individual chapter. All solutions and their 
source o f purchase, including equipment are described in appendix A.
2.1: Construction of cDNA library
2.1.1 Extraction o f E. ocellatus venom glands
Two adult carpet vipers E. ocellatus (source: Kaltungo, Nigeria) used in this study were 
maintained in the herpetarium, Liverpool School o f Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, U.K.
Venom glands dissected from E. ocellatus [sacrificed three days after venom extraction 
when toxin gene transcription rates are at a peak, Paine et al., (1994)] were placed into 
liquid-nitrogen and homogenized using a pestle and mortar until they were a fine powder.
2.1.2. Isolation o f  total KNA
Total RNA was then extracted using guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform 
(Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987) using a commercial kit (Trizol, Life Technologies). 
Trizol (1ml) was added to the homogenized gland powder in sterile glass homogenizer and 
homogenization continued for 5 minutes on ice. The homogenized sample was transferred 
into a 50 ml Falcon tube and kept for 5 minutes at room temperature (RT). Chloroform 
(400pl) per 2ml Trizol reagent was added, the tube mixed vigorously for 15 seconds,
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 51
incubated at RT for 3 minutes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 16 minutes at 4C. The 
RNA-containing aqueous phase was recovered, taking care not to disturb the interface, 
and transferred into a sterile Eppendorf tube. RNA from the aqueous phase was 
precipitated by thorough mixing with 1ml isopropyl alcohol [0.5ml/lml Trizol] and 
incubated at RT for 10 minutes. Precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at
12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C. The RNA pellet was washed with 1ml 75% ethanol 
(lml for every 1ml Trizol) and either stored at -80C for future application or centrifuged 
at 7,500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4C. The ethanol was discarded and the RNA pellet allows 
to air dry for 10 minutes. The remaining trace o f the ethanol was removed by using 
nitrogen gas and the RNA pellet was then resuspended in 25pl RNase-free deionised 
water. The size and quality o f the RNA extracted was estimated by agarose 
electrophoresis (Fig.2.1). The size of RNAs ranged from > 0.2 to over 1.0. The presence 
of large RNA fragments, ribosomal bands and the absence of low molecular weight 
degraded products indicated that the RNA was intact or not significantly degraded. The 
total RNAs extracted from the snake venom glands of E. ocellatus have the 28s and the 
18s (Fig.2.1).
Fig. 2.1. Analysis o f  total RNA from E. ocellatus venom gland
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 52
Analysis of E. ocellatus venom gland total RNA was subjected to 1% agarose gel 
electrophoresis with 10(4.1 [ 1 kb ladder, Lane 1], lpl [total RNA, E. ocellatus] + 4pl (RNA 
free water) + lpl (6x SLOB), Lane 2]. The position of the DNA markers and the identities 
of the 28s and 18s bands of rRNA of E. ocellatus venom gland are indicated.
2.1.3. Isolation o f mRNA
Messenger RNA was isolated from all other nucleic acid contaminants using Oligo dT 
magnetic beads isolation system (PolyATract mRNA, Promega) as outlined in Fig. 2.2.
The volume of the RNA sample (24pl) was made up to 500pl using RNase-free water and 
incubated at 65C for 10 minutes. Biotinylated-Oligo (dT) (3pl) and 13pl

o f 20xSodium Chloride Sodium citrate (SSc) (supplied) were added, mixed gently and 
incubated at RT for 10 minutes. In the meantime the Streptvidin-Paramagnatic Particles 
(SA-PMPs) were prepared and added to the entire content o f the annealing reaction and 
the mixture incubated at RT for 10 minutes. The SA-PMPs were captured using the 
magnetic stand and the supernatant was carefully removed. The SA-PMPs were then 
washed four times with O.lx SSC (0.3ml). The mRNA was concentrated by precipitation 
in 25pl o f  3M sodium acetate and 250pl o f iso-propanol and incubated at -20C overnight. 
The precipitated RNA was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000rpm at 4C, washed, 
resuspended in 75% ethanol treated with DEPC and stored at -80C or used immediately 
for the next step.
2.1.4. mRNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
This section describes the first step in the procedure for constructing a cDNA library. I 
have used SMART (Switching Mechanism At 5  end o f RNA Transcript, CLONTECH, 
CA U.S.A) cDNA Library Construction Kit which provides a method for producing high- 
quality, full-length cDNA libraries from nanograms o f total or poly A+ RNA. The 
SMART protocol has an advantage over the conventional cDNA cloning procedures in 
that it is designed to preferentially enrich for full-length cDNAs, while eliminating the use 
o f T4 DNA polymerase and adapter ligation. There are two main steps involved in the 
synthesis o f double stranded (ss) cDNA (Fig.2.3). The first step is based on using a 
modified oligo (dT) primer (CDS III/3 PCR Primer, appendix A) to prime the first-strand 
[mRNA  ss cDNA] synthesis reaction (Fig.2.3). When the reverse transcriptase reaches 
the 5  end, the enzymes terminal transferase activity adds a few additional nucleotides,
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 54
primarily deoxycytidine, to the 3 end o f  the cDNA, resulting in a full-length ss cDNA 
containing the complete 5 end o f the mRNA, as well as the sequence complementary to 
the SMART IV Oligo. This then serves as a universal priming site (SMART anchor) for
the subsequent amplification by LD-PCR (Long-distance PCR) as described in the next 
section.

Isolated mRNA prepared as described above was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 
rpm, the pellet was air dried and resuspended in 6pi RNase free water. Only 3 pi was used 
in the following procedure and the remaining 3pl was resuspended in
200pl o f 75% ethanol treated with DEPC and stored at -80C. The following master mix 
was prepared; - 3 pi mRNA
- lpl SMART IV oligonucleotide
- lpl CDS III/3  PCR primer
- 5 pi Total volume
The mixture was centrifuged briefly and incubated at 72C on a heating block for 2 
minutes. The tube was cooled on ice for 2 minutes and then spun briefly to collect the 
contents at the bottom o f the tube and added to the reverse transcription mixture as 
follows: - 5 pi the above mixture
- 2pl 5x first strand buffer 
- lp l  DDT (20mM)
- lp l  dNTP mix (lOmM)
-1  pi PowerScript Reverse Transcriptase
- lOpl Total volume
The contents were then mixed by gentle pipetting, centrifuged at 1300rpm for 5-10 
seconds and overlaid with drop o f mineral oil. The tube was then incubated at 42C for 
one hour in a sterile water bath. The tube was then incubated on ice to terminate first- 
strand synthesis. The sample was then stored at -20C until used.
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 56
2.1.5. cDNA Amplification by LD PCR
LD-PCR is the next step where only those ss cDNAs having a SMART anchor sequence 
at the 5 end can serve as a template and can be exponentially amplified. Incomplete 
cDNAs and cDNA transcribed from poly A' RNA will lack the SMART anchor and will 
not be amplified. Thus, contamination by genomic DNA and Poly A' RNA is eliminated. 
The following components were combined as follows;
- 2pl First strand cDNA (from section 2.1.4)
- 80pl Deionized water.
- 2pi 5OX dNTP Mix.
-2p l 5 PCR Primer
- 2pl CDCIII/3 PCR Primer
- 2pl 5 OX Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix.
- lOOpil Total volume
The contents were mixed by gently flicking the tube and followed by brief centrifugation 
(5-10 seconds at 13000rpm) to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube. This was then 
over-laid with two drops o f mineral oil. Thermal cycling was performed using the 
following program;
GeneAmp 2400/9600 
95C 20 seconds 
95C 5 seconds 
68C 6 minutes.
 22 cycles
Five microlitre o f the dscDNA was analysed using 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis
(Fig.2.4).
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 57
Fig. 2.4. Analysis o f E. ocellatus dscDNA construction.
It can thus be seen that LD-PCR generates two distinctive bands [A: >3.0 and B:>2.0], 
This may corresponded to an abundant transcript. However, both bands are weaker than 
the 1 -kb DNA size marker; this may be due to a higher complexity o f the Poly A+ starting 
material. Moreover, LD-PCR generates some low-molecular-weight material (< 0.4 kb) 
which could consist o f some degraded RNA fragments.
2.1.6. Proteinase K Digestion
To isolate the dscDNA from the mixture it was subjected to proteinase K digestion 
followed by phenol/chloroform/isopropanol purification according to the manufacturers 
instructions.
Two pi proteinase K was added to the tube containing 45pl PCR product incubated at 
45C for 20 minutes and then spun briefly. RNase free water (45gl) and lOOpl phenol: 
chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (pH 8, Sigma) was added, respectively. The solution was 
mixed thoroughly by gentle inversion for 2 minutes and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 
5 minutes. The dscDNA was precipitated from the final aqueous phase by addition of lOpl
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 58
sodium acetate (3M), 1.3pl glycogen (20|jg/ml supplied-CLONTECH) and 260pl ethanol 
(100%-sterile) at RT and immediately centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The 
supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with lOOpl (80%) ethanol and 
stored at -20C overnight. The sample was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 13,000 rpm, 
the supernatant discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry to evaporate off any residual 
ethanol. The pellet was resuspended with 79|d RNase-ffee deionised water.
2.1.7. Sfi I digestion
Another feature o f the SMART Kit is the incorporation o f asymmetrical Sfil restriction 
enzyme sites at the 5  and 3  cDNA ends, respectively. After digestion with Sfil and size 
fractionation using CHROMA SPIN-400 Column, the SMART cDNA is ready for ligation 
into the 5/iI-digested ATriplEX2 vector. X, TriplEX2, which contains the asymmetrical Sfil 
sites in the MAC, eliminates adaptor ligation and facilitates directional cloning. 
Furthermore, Sfil sites are extremely rare in mammalian DNA; therefore, all SMART 
cDNA remains intact after Sfil digestion methylation steps are eliminated and valuable 
internal restriction sites are preserved.
The following components were combined in a fresh 0.5ml tube:
- 79|il cDNA (from previous section)
- lOpl 1 Ox Sfil buffer
- lOpl Sfi enzyme
- lpl lOOxBSA

Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 59
The solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 50C for 2 hours. Xylene (2pl, 1%) 
cyanol dye was added to the tube and mixed well.
2.1.8. cDNA size fractionation
The size fractionation o f the E. ocellatus dscDNA was performed to remove low- 
molecular-weight cDNA fragments, small DNA contaminants, and unincorporated 
nucleotides from the cDNA. Failure to remove low-molecular weight contaminants results 
in a library having a preponderance o f very small inserts and/or apparently non
recombinant clones.
CHROMA SPIN-400 Column (supplied with the kit) was prepared before used by 
resuspending the matrix with its preserved solution and allowing to drain naturally. Once 
the preserved solution had drained from the column, 700pl o f  column buffer was gently 
added without disturbing the matrix. The 1 0 2 jll1 mixture o f  the //-digested cDNA and 
xylene cyano dye was added carefully and evenly to the top-centre surface o f the matrix 
and allowed to be absorbed fully into the surface o f the matrix. Another lOOpl o f the 
column buffer was used to wash the tube that had contained the cDNA and this was then 
added to the CHROMA SPIN-400 column. The buffer was allowed to drain out o f the 
column until no liquid was left above the resin. Column buffer (600pl) was added and 
immediately collection o f single drop fractions (approximately 40pl per tube) into 16 
tubes was started. The profile o f each fraction was checked using 3pl o f each fraction 
loaded onto a 1.1% agarose electrophoresis gel (Fig.2.5). This was run at 150v for 5 
minutes. Only four [5-8] fractions were found to contain the ds cDNA above 500bp.
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 60
Fig.2.5. Analysis o f size fractionation of E. ocellatus ds cDNA.
Fractions 5-8 were pooled and precipitated using the following components
- 1/10 vol. sodium acetate (3M; pH 4.8)
- 1.3 pi glycogen (20mg/lm)
- 2.5 vol. 95% ethanol (-20C)
The sample was then incubated overnight at -20C for better recovery and centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 30 minutes at RT. The pellet was then air dried and resuspended gently 
with 7pl deionised water.
2.1.9. Ligation o f cDNA with dephosphorylated /.TriplEx2 vector (Stratagem, 
California, U.S.A)
Because the ratio of cDNA to vector in the ligation reaction is a critical factor for 
determining the transformation efficiency, three different concentrations of E. ocellatus 
cDNA were used (Table 2.1) and incubated at 16C overnight. A control ligation was 
performed in parallel (lpl of vector, lpl of insert [Human placenta, supplied with kit], 
1,5pl of deionised water and other reagents).

2.1.10. Packing reaction
A commercial kit (Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract, Stratagene) was used to package 
the ligation reaction into lambda phage with high efficiency. Four packing extract vials 
[three for those illustrated in Table 2.1 and the fourth as a control] were thawed on ice. 
Once the extract had begun to thaw, lpl o f the each ligation reaction was added into tube 
containing the packing extract; this was then mixed gently with a sterile pipette tip, briefly 
centrifuged and incubated at RT for two hours. Subsequently, 500pl o f SM buffer 
[Appendix A] was added to each reaction tube followed by 20pl chloroform. It was then 
mixed gently without generating bubbles and incubated at 4C.
2.1.11. Bacterial culture plating
An early preparation o f Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL 1-Blue cells streaked on an agar plate 
containing tetracycline (15mg/ml), was performed as described in section 2.2.4. A single 
colony was selected and used to inoculate 30ml LB (Luria-BertaniyMgSCVmaltose with 
tetracycline (15 mg/ml) and incubated at 37C overnight while shaking at 200 ipm. Cells
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 62
were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4C, the supernatant was discarded 
and the pellet was resuspended in 15 ml MgSC>4 and kept on ice.
2.1.12. Infection o f  E. coli with recombinant X phage
These were 1:5 [lp l sample + 4pi SM buffer], 1:20 [lp l sample + 19pl SM buffer] and 
1:100 [lp l sample + 99pl SM buffer]. One pi o f  each X phage sample was added to 200pl 
o f the XLl-Blue [section 2.1.11] E. coli suspension and incubated at 37C for 15 minutes. 
This allows the phage to infect the X Ll-Blue cells. Subsequently, 2ml o f  melted 
LB/MgS04 top-agar was added to the E. coli /  X phage and the mixture was immediately 
poured evenly onto 90-mm LB/MgS04 plates pre-warmed to 37C. The plates were 
allowed to cool to RT for 20 minutes to allow the top agar to harden. They were then 
incubated at 37C overnight. The number o f  plaques on each plate was counted (Table 
2.2) and the phage titre [pfu/ml] calculated using the following formula:
pfu/ml = [No. of plaques x dilution factor x 103pl/ml]/ pi of diluted phage Plated

2.1.13. Determination o f  the percentage o f recombinant clones
A blue/white [IPTG/X-gal] procedure was used to determine the ratio o f recombinant 
against non-recombinant E. coli. The results demonstrated that the dilution factor 1:5 of 
the 3rd ligation reaction (2.1.12) induced a 100% transformation efficiency. The remaining 
dscDNA was packaged into X phage and transformed E. coli, using the optimal ligation 
and dilution factors identified above to produce the library.
2.1.14. Amplification o f  the E. ocellatus cDNA library.
In order to optimise the amplification process, a test titration o f the amplified library and 
E. coli was performed to determine the concentration o f X phage required to produce 
confluent E. coli lysis on a large plate. As a result o f this assessment, 100pl o f X cDNA 
was added to 600pl XL 1-Blue cells and the mixture incubated at 37C for 15 minutes. 
This was performed for 20 agar plates until all the unamplified library had been utilized. 
The infected cells were then mixed with 12 ml soft-top agar MgSCU and immediately 
poured onto a pre-warmed large LB M gS04 agar [containing tetracycline, 15mg/ml] plate 
and incubated overnight at 37C.
The next procedure was to harvest the amplified X phage. This was performed as follows: 
12 ml of IX lambda dilution (SM) buffer was added to each o f the twenty plates and 
incubated with gentle shaking at RT for one hour. The plates were subsequently incubated 
at 4C on a rocking platform overnight. The amplified packed cDNA (12ml) was 
harvested next day from each plate and pooled into a sterile glass bottle. 30ml chloroform 
was added to the total volume (186ml) o f the E. ocellatus cDNA library to lyse any E.
coli.
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 64
2.1.15. Titering the amplified library
Several dilutions o f the amplified X phage library were used to infect E. coli and the 
number o f lysed E. coli (plaques) used to estimate the pfu o f the amplified library. An 
XL 1-Blue overnight cell culture was prepared as previously described [without added 
antibiotic], except that the cell pellet was resuspended in pre-chilled 7.5ml (lOmM) 
MgSCL. Dilution o f phage lysate was prepared as follows: the library lysate (lOpl) was 
pipetted into 1ml SM buffer, [dilution 1 = 1:100]. Ten microlitres this dilution was 
transferred into a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube containing 1ml fresh SM buffer [dilution 2 = 
1:10,000]. Four 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes were prepared as shown in Table 2.3a;

Tubes were incubated at 37C for 15 minutes. 3ml of melted (45C) LB/MgSCL soft-top 
agar was added to each o f the four tubes, mixed quickly and poured onto four x 90 mm 
LB/MgSCL-agar plates without antibiotic. Plates were quickly swirled for even 
distribution o f the soft-top agar.
Plaques were subsequentlycounted for each dilution and phage titration was obtained 
using the same formula that was used in section 2.1.12 (Table. 3.3b).

2.2.: Miscellaneous techniques
2.2.1. Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Poly Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
A  15% gel (unless otherwise stated) was prepared (Appendix A). A  Bio-RAD mini
protein II dual slab cell was assembled according to the manufacturers instructions. The 
two glass plates (long and short) between which the gel was to be caste were cleaned with 
detergent, washed thoroughly with distilled water and then with methanol for in order to 
further clean and remove any additional grease or debris etc.
The separating (resolving) gel solution was prepared (Appendix A) and then poured 
between the glass plates and immediately over-laid with water saturated-iso-butanol. The 
gel was then allowed to polymerise for about 30-40 minutes. The stacking gel was then 
prepared (appendix A), the water saturated-iso-butanol drained out, the stacking gel 
poured on top o f  the separating gel and the comb placed in the gel sandwich and tithed, so 
that the teeth were at slight angle to prevent air from being trapped under the comb teeth. 
The stacking gel was then allowed to polymerise for about 30-40 minutes. Running buffer 
(800ml) was prepared (Appendix A) and the electrophoresis tank filled. The samples were 
then loaded using multi flex 0.44 flat pipette tips (Bio-RAD). Samples were loaded with 
lOpl o f  low molecular weight markers 97-14 kDa (Bio-RAD). The lid was placed on top
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 66
of the electrophoresis tank and electrophoresis performed at 150 volts for 1 hour and 45 
minutes or until the dye front had just migrated from the gel. The protein bands were then 
visualised by Coomassie blue staining. SDS-PAGE gels were submerged for 15 minutes 
to 1 hour [depending on the freshness o f the staining solution] in 0.5% Coomassie blue 
(appendix A). The gels were then de-stained by covering them with de-staining solution 
(appendix A) to remove the background (usually 1 to 3 hours).
2.2.2. Western blot
2.2.2.1. Transfer o f  protein bands to nitrocellulose membrane
A Mini Trans-blot Electrophoresis Transfer cell (Bio-RAD Labotatories, USA) was used. 
The electrophoresis buffer salts and SDS were removed from the SDS-PAGE gel by 
equilibrating it in transfer buffer (appendix A) for 20 minutes prior to blotting. A 
nitrocellulose membrane was cut to the dimensions o f the gel and labeled with a soft 
pencil to identify the gel and the orientation of the membrane. The membrane was allowed 
to soak in transfer buffer for several minutes. Two pieces o f filter (3mm Whatman) paper 
and fibre pads were soaked in transfer buffer taking care not to trap air bubbles in the fibre 
pads or thick filter papers. The Mini-Trans-Buffer electrodes in the buffer chamber were 
installed. The buffer tank was half-filled with approximately 750ml o f transfer buffer and 
a one-inch stirrer magnetic-bar was placed at the bottom o f the tank. A frozen Bio-Ice 
cooling block was installed in the buffer chamber next to the electrodes, a few minutes 
before starting the transfer. With gloves on, the gel holder cassette was assembled. This 
consists o f red and black panels, which were opened by sliding the lifting latch. The 
opened gel holder was then placed in a shallow vessel so that the red panel was left in the
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 67
bottom of the vessel and the black panel was rested at an angle against the wall. The pre
soaked fibre pad was placed on the red panel o f the cassette making sure to center all 
components. The soaked filter paper was placed on top o f the fibre pad and the surface of 
the filter paper was saturated with transfer buffer. The equilibrated gel was placed on top 
o f the filter paper and aligned in the center o f the cassette making sure not to trap bubbles 
between the gel and the filter paper. The pre-soaked nitrocellulose membrane was then 
lowered on top o f the gel taking care not to trap bubbles in the area between the membrane 
and the gel. The surface o f the membrane was flooded with transfer buffer. A pre-soaked 
filter paper was placed on top o f the membrane and finally a soaked fibre pad was placed 
on top o f the filter paper. The cassette was closed and held firmly so that the components 
could not move. The holder cassette was fitted in the cathode electrode so that the red 
panel o f the cassette faced the red panel o f the cathode electrode and placed in the buffer 
tank. The transfer was carried out at constant voltage (lOOv) for one hour. Following this, 
the buffer and the nitrocellulose membrane were removed and to check the efficiency of 
protein transfer, the membrane was stained briefly with 0.5% Ponceau S (Appendix A) for 
2 minutes to visualize the bands at which from the migration o f the protein molecular 
weight marker were recorded in pencil on the membrane.
2.2.2.2. Probing with specific antibodies
The immunoblot was transferred into 5% blocking solution (appendix A) overnight with 
shaking at 4C to block non-specific sites. The membrane was then washed three times (10 
minutes each) with PBS-tween (Appendix A) and then incubated with the appropriate 
primary antibody diluted 1/1000 [unless specified otherwise] in blocking solution for 3
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 68
hours at RT (22C). The membrane was then washed three times (10 minutes each) with 
PBS-Tween to remove excess antibody. Subsequently the membrane was incubated for 
one hour with the appropriate secondary conjugated-antibody (e.g., Horseradish 
peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L), Nudic, poole, UK) usually diluted at 
1:2000. The membrane was then washed six times as above and submerged in the 
peroxidase substrate solution (Appendix A) until the band were visualized. The membrane 
was then washed in distilled water to prevent over-development o f the 
peroxidase/substrate reaction.
2.2.3. Preparation of glycerol stock culture.
Selected colonies from transformation plates were inoculated into 5ml LB medium broth 
containing the appropriate antibiotics (usually ampicillin 15mg/ml) in 50ml conical tubes 
and incubated at 37C with shaking at 200rpm overnight (16 hours). A 0.5ml aliquot of 
each culture was removed and added into fresh autoclaved Eppendorf tube containing 
0.5ml sterile glycerol. The stock cultures were then frozen at -80C until required.
2.2.4. Preparation of bacterial cultures from -80C stock cultures.
Glycerol stock cultures o f recombinant E. coli colonies were streaked onto LB agar plates 
containing the ampicillin [15mg/ml) antibiotic and incubated overnight at 37C. A well- 
separated colony was removed from the LB agar plate and used to inoculate LB broth 
containing the ampicillin antibiotic [15mg/ml] and incubated overnight at 37C with 
shaking at 200rpm.
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 69
2.2.5. Northern blot
The Northern blotting technique was used in this project to analyse venom toxin RNA 
transcripts. While working with RNA, all working surfaces, gloves, pipettes etc., were 
made sterile and sprayed with 75% ethanol at every step. Gloves were worn at all times 
while working with RNA, as hands are a major source o f RNase. Gloves must be changed 
frequently if  they come into contact with any external source o f  contamination. All 
glassware and solutions were treated with DEPC was removed from the solution by 
autoclaving.
2.2.5.1. Isolation o f  total RNA
Venom glands were dissected from two adult E. ocellatus [three days after venom 
extraction], pooled and weighed (144mg) and immediately transferred into labelled sterile 
cryopreservation tubes (Nunc) and stored in liquid nitrogen. To extract RNA the glands 
were ground under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle following standard protocols 
(Sambrook et al., 1989). According to the manufacturers instructions (Aqua Pure 
Genomic RNA kits, Bio-RAD) a volume o f 4.32ml (30pl/mg) RNA Lysis Solution was 
added to the autoclaved glass homogeniser containing the ground glands. The tissue was 
homogenized with the RNA lysis solution for a further 5 minutes.
2.2.5.2. Removal ofprotein and DNA and isolation o f total RNA precipitate. 
Protein-DNA Precipitation solution (1.44ml) was added to the cell lysate (lOpl/mg). The 
tube was gently inverted (10 times), incubated on ice for 5 minutes and centrifuged at
13,000 rpm at 4C in a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes. A tight white pellet was formed
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 70
consisting o f protein and DNA. The supernatant was transferred into two sterile 1.5ml 
Eppendorf tubes containing 2.11 ml (100%) Isopropanol (2 volumes isopropanol: 1 
volume RNA solution). The tubes were thoroughly mixed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm 
in a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes. The small, translucent RNA pellet was washed with 
3.0ml 70% ethanol and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 1 minute 
and the ethanol discarded carefully. Tubes were inverted and drained on clean paper and 
allowed to air dried for 10-15 minutes. 50(4.1 RNA hydration buffer was then added to each 
tube. RNA samples were allowed to rehydrate for at least 30 minutes on ice and then used 
immediately or stored under 100% ethanol at -80C.
2.2.5.3. Agarose-formaldehyde Gel Electrophoresis
A large 1.1% formaldehyde-agarose gel was prepared (500ml, Appendix A) as follows. 
When the melted agarose had cooled to 60C, 10ml o f lOx MOPS (Appendix A) running 
buffer and 18ml (12.3M) formaldehyde (2.2 M final concentration) were added. The gel 
was poured gently, making sure no bubbles are formed, and allowed to set. The gel was 
placed in the electrophoresis tank and lx  MOPS running buffer (Appendix A) was added 
to cover the gel. An equal volume o f RNA-SLB (Appendix A) was added to the RNA 
sample (84pl) and 16|j,l o f mixture sample was loaded into each well (10 wells in all, 
excluding the RNA ladder well). The gel was run at constant voltage (34v) until the 
orange dye reached the bottom o f the gel (18 hours). The gel was soaked twice in 1.01 
0.5M ammonium acetate solution for 20 minutes to remove the formaldehyde followed by 
0.5M amonium acetate containing ethidium bromide (lOmg/ml) for 45 minutes. The gel 
was then rinsed in 1.01 (0.5M) ammonium acetate [without ethidium bromide] for one
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 71
hour to remove excess ethidium bromide and an image o f the fractionated RNA taken 
under UV light with a ruler laid alongside the gel.
2.2.5.4. Transfer o f  fractionated RNA to nylon membrane
The gel was equilibrated in 10 gel volumes o f 20X SSC (Appendix A) for 45 minutes. 
The northern transfer stack was assembled with care as shown (Fig.2.6) to remove air 
bubbles and the 20xSSC allowed to transfer the RNA to the nylon membrane by capillary 
action for 24 hours.
Subsequently the stack was disassembled, the membrane recovered and the positions and 
orientation o f the wells on the membrane were marked by pencil. The membrane was 
rinsed with 2x SSC (Appendix A), allowed to air dry and the fractionated RNA cross 
linked to the membrane completed by exposure to UV radiation for two minutes each side 
o f the membrane in a dedicated instruments. The membrane was then cut into strips and 
carefully sandwiched between two clean sheets o f 3mm Whatman paper and stored at 4C 
until used.

2.2.5.5. Pre-hybridization o f Northern blot membrane
Membrane was incubated at 42C overnight in a hybridisation oven in 10ml formamide 
pre-hybridisation (FPH) solution (Appendix A) containing lOOpl (lOOOpg) o f denatured 
salmon sperm ssDNA to block non-specific sites.
2.2.5.6. Probe labelling
To detect which o f the many RNA molecules on the agarose gel hybridize to a particular 
probe, the probe DNA molecule usually labelled, strand-specifically, with radioactive 
isotope such as 32P. Strand-specific DNA probes usually carried out by using single- 
stranded DNA obtained after cloning in plasmid vector that has had part of one strand 
removed by denaturising or by a 3 -5 exonuclease. DNA polymerases can then be used to 
re-synthesise the missing strand by incorporating radioactive NTPs (in this study project a 
y-32P dATP was used) nucleotides. So that the antisense (non-labelled) strand will 
hybridise to cellular RNA while the sense probe will act as a control.
E. ocellatus venom toxin DNA (25ng) was used as a probe using a dATP 32P isotope 
(Promega, Bedford, UK). A master mix o f dNTPs except dATP was made [lOpil o f each 
o f dCTP, dGTP and dTTP]. Components o f the mixture reaction were set up as described 
in (Appendix A). The sample was then mixed gently and incubated for one hour at RT. 
The reaction was then terminated by heating at 100C for 5 minutes and immediately kept 
on ice followed by the addition o f 2pl o f (0.5M) EDTA to the reaction tube.
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 73
2.2.5.7. Removal o f  unincorporated label
Unincorporated radioactive label was removed by size exclusion chromatography (pre
prepared Sephadex G50 column, Pharmacia). The column storage buffer was drained and 
flushed three times with TE buffer (400jil) and the dATP-32P label mixture added and 
immediately followed by 700pl o f TE buffer. Fractions (400jil) were collected into 1.5ml 
Eppendorf tubes and those which showed the intermediate radiation levels [measured by 
Geiger-Muller counter] were pooled in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. The labelled DNA probe 
was then heated at 100C for 5 minutes to separate the DNA strands. It was then incubated 
immediately on ice for several minutes before adding it to the Northern blot membrane 
[that previously incubated with the FPH solution] and incubated at 42C overnight.
2.2.5.8. Stringency washes
Hybridisation solution was removed and the membrane washed as shown in Table.2.4.
Table 2.4. Stringency wash strategy
Stringency buffer Temperature (C) Number of repeat Period (minute)
2.0xSSC/0.1 % SDS RT 2 5

0.2xSSC/0.1 % SDS 68 2 15
0.1xSSC/0.1%SDS 68 2 15
During each stringency wash, the membrane was checked for residual radiation activity 
using Geiger-Muller counter. After the final stringency wash, the membrane was removed
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 74
and allowed to air dry. it was then placed on 3mm Whatman paper in parallel with a 
fluorescent ruler and exposed to X-ray film at -20C for two weeks.
2.2.6. Isolation o f cDNA from X phage
As a target o f PCR amplification, the cDNA was isolated from the X phage.
X phage lysate (20pi) was boiled for 5 minutes, centrifuged immediately and then 
incubated on ice. RNase-free water (80pl) was added with lOOpl phenol: chloroform: 
isoamyl alcohol [1:24:1], mixed vigorously and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 13000 rpm. 
The supernatant was transferred into a fresh 1.5ml Eppendorf and lOOpl chloroform 
added; this was mixed and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was 
transferred into a fresh 1.5ml Eppendorf containing 1/10 vol. o f 3M sodium acetate and 
2.5 vol. 100% ethanol; this was incubated for one hour at -80C to precipitate the cDNA. 
The tube was then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4C and the pellet washed 
in 70% ethanol, air dried for 10-15 minutes and then resuspended in RNase free water and 
stored at -20C until used.
2.2.7. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
PCR is a method which essentially isolates a specific segment o f DNA by 
amplification. PCR uses specific primers which allow Taq DNA polymerase to make 
copies o f only a specific segment. Taq DNA polymerase is used because it is able to 
withstand the high heat (95C) necessary for the many cycles o f PCR. A unique aspect of 
Taq DNA polymerase is that it adds a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3' ends o f PCR
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 75
products. The resulting products o f PCR are many copies o f a specific DNA sequence 
with 3' A overhangs.
A PCR strategy [Israel, 1993] was used to screen the cDNA library for DNA encoding the 
E. ocellatus toxin molecules. PCR was performed using a thermal cycler (Gene Cycler, 
BioRad Hercules CA, U.S.A.) programmed as shown in Table 2.5. The 50pi PCR reaction 
mixture on ice contained approximately lOng o f E. ocellatus cDNA [extracted from X- 
phage by boiling and phenol chloroform treatment], 50mM KC1, 1.5mM MgCk, 50 pM 
each dNTP, 2.5 pi (lOpM) each primer, 5 units o f Taq polymerase. RNase free water was 
then added to make a total volume o f 50 pi. Before starting the PCR cycles, samples were 
over-laid with two drops o f mineral oil to prevent evaporation during the PCR reaction. 
The PCR- amplified product was detected using 0.7% agarose unless specified otherwise, 
lpl 6x SLOB (Appendix A) and 5pl o f the PCR product were pipetted into 0.7% agarose 
gel, containing 0.5pg/ml ethidium bromide, along with 1Kb DNA ladder (Bio-RAD). This 
was electrophoresed for 1 hour at 70 volts. DNA bands were examined under ultraviolet 
trans-illumination. The size o f the amplicons was determined by comparison with the 
molecular-weight markers.

2.2.8. Isolation o f  DNA from agarose gel
The selected PCR band or restriction enzyme digestion product was excised from the 
agarose gel, cut into small pieces and transferred into a fresh sterile 5ml tube and purified 
using commercial kit (A Prep A-Gene DNA Purification System, Bio-RAD, USA).
The x volume [depending on the concentration o f DNA band] o f the binding buffer was 
added to the gel and incubated at 40C until the slice gel dissolved completely. A 
predetermined amount o f the Prep-A-Gene Matrix silica [the amount is based on the 
concentration o f the DNA shown on the agarose gel; generally 0.2pg DNA per lpl o f  
completely resuspended matrix] was added, mixed and incubated for 30 minutes (RT) 
using end-over-end rocking to bind the DNA to the silica matrix. The matrix was pelleted
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 77
by centrifugation for 30 seconds, the supernatant discarded and pellet was resuspended 
with DNA binding buffer equivalent to 25 times the amount o f added matrix. The later 
step was repeated twice but with ethanol containing wash buffer. After the second wash 
the pellet was centrifuged to remove residual wash buffer and bound DNA. The DNA was 
then eluted by adding at least 1 pellet volume of elution buffer and incubating at 40C for 
5 minutes. The tube was then centrifuged for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm and the supernatant 
containing the eluted DNA was transferred into a sterile 0.5ml Eppendorf tube.
2.2.9. Ligation of PCR product into TOPO-vector pCR2.1
TOPO cloning ligates the PCR product into the pCR 2.1-TOPO plasmid vector (vector) 
(Fig.2.7). This can be done quickly and efficiently because o f the unique aspects o f the 
vector. The vector has been engineered to be a linearized plasmid with 3' deoxythymidine 
(T) overhangs that is activated by being covalently bonded to topoisomerase I. The 3' A 
overhangs o f the PCR product (section 2.2.7) complement the 3' T overhangs o f the vector 
and allow for fast ligation with the topoisomerase I. The plasmid can then be transformed 
into competent bacterial cells as shown in Fig.2.7.
TOPO TA cloning provides a highly efficient, 5-minute, one-step cloning strategy (TOPO 
cloning) for the direct insertion o f Taq polymerase-amplified PCR products into a plasmid 
vector. The plasmid vector (pCR 2,1-TOPO) is supplied linearized with single 3 - 
thymidine (T) overhangs for TA cloning. Taq polymerase has a non template-dependent 
terminal transferase activity that adds a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3  ends o f PCR 
products. The linearized vector supplied in this kit has single, overhanging 3  
deoxythymidine (T) residues. This allows PCR inserts to ligate efficiently with the vector.

Ligation is the procedure where a desired DNA fragment is inserted into an appropriate 
vector. The chosen vector has been manufactured commercially and must carry markers 
that enable cells containing the vector to be identified and recombinant molecules to be 
distinguished from non-recombinant ones as described in section 2.2.11.

2.2.10. Transformation of ligation reaction into chemically competent E. coli cells
Transformation is the process where the vector plus venom toxin DNA is inserted into a 
suitable bacterial cell. In this study, a chemically competent E. coli cell was used. For each 
transformation reaction, 6pl o f the TOPO ligation reaction [section 2.2.9] was added to a 
vial o f chemically competent TOPOlOFcells One Shot (Invitrogen), mixed very gently 
without pipetting and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Cells were then heat-shocked for 30 
seconds in a 42C water-bath without shaking and immediately transferred onto ice and 
incubated for 2 minutes. Bacterial growth factor (250pl) (supplemented SOC medium, 
Appendix A) was added, incubated for two minutes on ice, transferred to an 
environmental shaker and then incubated at 37C for 1 hour with continuous shaking. 
Cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute, 150pl supernatant was discarded and 
cells resuspended in the remaining lOOpl medium. Resuspended cells were then plated 
onto pre-warmed ampicillin-plate(s) containing: 15g/l LB broth-agar, 50pl (50pg/ml- 
Calbiochem) X-gal and 50j_tl (lOOmM-Sigma Aldrich, UK) IPTG using a sterile glass 
spreader and incubated overnight at 37C.
2.2.11. Identification of positive clones
If all the competent cells present in a transformation reaction were allowed to grow on an 
agar plate, then many thousands or millions o f colonies would result. Therefore a method 
for the selection o f clones containing a plasmid is required. This is almost always provided 
by the presence o f (i) an antibiotic resistance gene(s) on the plasmid vector, for example 
the P-lactamase gene (amp1)  conferring resistance to ampicillin. Only those cells which are 
expressing P-lactamase due to the presence o f a transformed plasmid will survive and
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 80
grow, and (ii) histochemical markers that result in colonies taking a distinctive colour 
(blue-white screening). Basically blue-white screening is a method involves the insertonal 
inactivation o f a gene (lacZ), which encodes the enzyme P-galactosidae. Expression o f a 
lacZ gene on the vector can be induced by using isopropyl-P-D-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) and the expressed enzyme can utilize the synthetic substrate 5-bromo-4chloro- 
3indolyl-P-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to yield a blue product. Therefore insertional 
inactivation o f lacZ in the production o f a recombinant plasmid would prevent the 
development o f the blue color. The vector pCR 2.1-TOPO used in this study project 
consist both such factors as shown in (Fig.2.8).
As a result, only bacteria containing vector with PCR product will grow as white colonies. 
Therefore, only white colonies were selected, removed from the plate and inoculated into 
4ml LB broth containing ampicillin and shaken at 37C. The bacterial suspension was 
transferred into 1.5ml Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and the 
pellet resuspended in 250pl o f Qiagen cell re-suspension buffer (PI). According to 
manufacturers instruction (Mini plasmid spin kit, Qiagen, Kit) 250pl o f an alkali cell 
lysis buffer (P2) was added, the tube contents were mixed gently by inverting the tube 4 to 
6 times and 350/j.l o f neutralisation buffer (P3) was added. The tube was then centrifuged 
at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant pipetted into a spin column attached to a 
2 ml collection tube. The DNA solution was then passed through the column by 
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute. The spin column was subjected to three spin 
washes with 0.75 ml washing buffer (PE) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 seconds.

The spin column was then placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and 50pl of sterile distilled 
water was added and allowed to stand for 1 minute to elute the DNA plasmid. The eluted 
DNA solution was then collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute. The DNA
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 82
yield was determined by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and the DNA was stored at -  
20C until required.
An up-scaled edition o f the mini-plasmid DNA extraction kit (Maxi-prep, Qiagen) was 
used to isolate the larger quantities o f DNA required for the future sub-cloning. The 
technique was similar with exception that the chromatography used was a stationary, not 
centrifuged, column.
2.2.12. Identification of clones by restriction enzyme digestion
To confirm that the TOPO/toxin DNA was o f the expected size, the recombinant plasmid 
(lpg) was digested with restriction enzymes utilized in the primer design (usually BamHI 
and Xhol) with a buffer appropriate to both enzymes in a total volume o f 20jlx1, overnight 
at 37C. The size o f the digested product was visualised by agarose gel electrophoresis.
2.2.13. Automated DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy-nucleotide chain-termination method 
[Sanger et al., 1977] in a Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000 XL DNA Analysis System. Each 
sequencing reaction was carried out according to manufacturers instructions with at least 
200ng o f plasmid DNA and lOpM primers [Ml 3 forward and reverse primers].
The principle o f the automated DNA sequencing is based on the chemical method of DNA 
sequencing which has largely been superseded by the method o f Sanger et al., (1977) 
which uses four specific dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to terminate enzymatically 
synthesized copies o f a template. Basically a sequencing primer is annealed to a ssDNA 
template molecule and a DNA polymerase extends the primer using ddNTPs. The
Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 83
extension reaction is split into four and each quarter is terminated separately with one of 
the specific ddNTPs, and the four samples (labeled with different fluorescent dies) are 
analysed by PAGE. In the automated DNA sequencing the reaction products are mixed 
and run in the same lane in the gel. A fluorescent detector records the molecules as they 
pass a particular point in the gel and determines whether they are from A, G, C, or T 
reactions according to the fluorescence labeled nucleotides. The information is then fed 
directly into a computer.
2.2.14. BLAST search
Prior BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches the amino acid sequences o f  
each clone was predicted using the Clustal structure programme-McgAlign software 
(DNASTAR, USA). The predicted amino acid sequence was then compared to sequences 
in the GenBank, PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF databases using the BLAST program 
[Altschul et al., 1997] to determine clone identity. Basically, the BLAST search algorithm 
reports all significant regions of sequence identity between two sequences, using the 
highest scoring pair (HSP) o f identical length segment. The approach to similarity 
searching taken by the BLAST program is first to look for similar segments (HSPs) 
between the query sequence and data base sequence, then to evaluate the statistical 
significance o f any matches found and finally to report only those matches that satisfy a 
user-selectable threshold o f significance. Finally, novel cDNA isolated in this project were 
assigned accession number using the NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology 
Information) web site.

3.1. Introduction
Snake venom phospholipases are amongst the most toxic venom constituents with the sub
group A2 (SVPLA2) having the potential to disrupt haemostasis at several distinct levels. In 
contrast to SVPLA2S, mammalian PLA2 are non-toxic and act as mediators in various 
physiological processes without inducing potent pharmacological effects. The evolution of a 
toxic function for snake venom PLA2 underscores the biological importance of this group of 
enzymes to snakes.
Besides their possible role in the hydrolysis o f membrane phospholipids and/or plasma 
lipoproteins, viper PLA2 induce a broad spectrum of toxic activities, including haemolysis 
(Kihara et al., 1992), neurotoxicity (Bon, 1997; Gubensek et al., 1997; Fletcher and 
Rosenber, 1997; Petan et al., 2002), cardiotoxicity, myotoxicity (Fletcher et al., 1981; Fuly 
et al., 1997) anticoagulant activity (Rosenberg et al., 1983; Evens and Kini, 1997), edema- 
inducing activity (Vishwanath et al., 1987; Wang and Teng; 1990; Liu et al., 1991; Tan et 
al., 1991) and initiation or inhibition o f platelet aggregation (Kini and Evans, 1990; 1997). 
Several o f these effects can be generated by venom PLA2 o f a single species such as in 
venom o f T. flavoviridis (Kordis et al., 1998; Ohno et al., 2003). However, only some of 
these toxic activities are related to a direct hydrolytic activity on phospholipids (Machado 
etal, 1993).
Although SVPLA2S differ in their toxic effects (Rosenberg et al., 1983; Tsai et al., 2001), 
they exhibit a remarkable degree o f sequence homology (>50%). Since the isolation o f the 
first svPLA2 cDNA sequence (Guignery-Frelat et al., 1987), significant progress has been 
made to isolate and characterise numerous cDNA sequences encoding the sub-group I and
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A 2 86
II PLA2S [as described Chapter-1]. Valentin and Lambeau (2000), reported that a single 
snake species may contain up to 15 distinct PLA2S in its venom with sequence identities 
ranging from 40% to 99%, each of which may exert a different effect. Kemparaju et al. 
(1994) isolated a basic (Ip 12-1.6) PLA2 protein (EC-IV-PLA2) o f 14 kDa from the Indian 
saw-scaled viper {Echis carinatus) venom with neurotoxic and oedema-producing effects 
in mice but no direct haemolytic, myotoxic, cytotoxic or anticoagulant activities. In 1999 
Kemparajus group isolated a 16 kDa acidic (Ip 4.2-4.8) isoform of PLA2 (EC-I- PLA2) 
from the venom o f the same species which was also non-lethal to mice and devoid o f  
neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity but caused oedema. 
The existence of multiple molecular forms of PLA2 enzymes within the same venom may be 
to increase the efficiency of its action on prey (Schiavo et al., 2000). Several studies have 
been performed to investigate and explain how a multiple isoforms o f PLA2 within the 
same venom can exert such diverse effects. Petan et al., (2002) in a study based on chemical 
modification, showed that replacement of Phe24 residue with Trp24 in the N-terminal region of 
ATXA PLA.2 isolated from venom of the western sand viper (Vipera ammodytes ammodytes), 
induced a considerable decline (40-80%) in enzymatic activity. The outcome o f this study 
suggested that the PLA2 isomer-specific effects are apparently linked to the existence of a 
diversity of very high affinity receptors for svPLA.2 (Lambeau et al., 1996).
While several toxic PLA2 in venoms o f related Viperinae species have been identified and 
well charecterized [including Echis, as demonstrated above] (Kemparaju et al., 1994; 
1999; Polgr et al., 1996; Lizano et al., 1997), either is known about the contribution o f  
PLA2 activity to the pathology o f E. ocellatus envenoming.
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A  ? 87
The purpose o f this chapter therefore was to isolate and characterise cDNAs encoding E. 
ocellatus PLA2S. To achieve this, I have utilised the sequence similarity o f viper group II 
PLA2 enzymes to design PCR primers and amplify analogous cDNAs from a E. ocellatus 
venom gland cDNA library. The sequence characteristics o f the E. ocellatus PLA2 cDNAs 
isolated here were compared with analogous molecules in related vipers, particularly with 
those o f Echis species o f distinct residential boundaries in East Africa (E. p. leakeyi) and 
in the Indian subcontinent (E. sochureki). Many, but not all, o f the results reported here 
have been published by Bahrati et al., (2003)
3.2. Strategy
The experimental strategy to achieve these objectives is show in Fig.3.1.

3.3. Designing primers
Sequences complimentary to highly conserved regions encoding the amino (M-R-T-L-W- 
I) and carboxyl (E-S-E-K-C) ends of the open reading frame o f published group II 
SVPLA2 DNA sequences o f related viper species were used to design the PLA2 primers 
(Table 3.1). Where the nucleotide sequences were species-specific, the sequence of the 
most frequent codon was used. The following primers were used:
Sense primer PLA2-5 GGA-TCC-ATG-AGG-ACT-CTC-TGG-ATA-3[24 bp].
An antisense primer PLA2- 3-CTC-GAG-TCA-GCA-TTT-CTC-TGA-CTC- 
CTC-5[27bp].
Two stop codons (TCA) and restriction endonuclease sites for BamHl and Xhol were 
included in the 5 - and 3 - primers respectively to facilitate future subcloning into 
mammalian expression plasmids. The two primers were custom-synthesized by Sigma- 
Genosys Ltd., U.K.

3.4. Results
3.4.1. PCR with primers complimentary to consensus sequences in viper PLA2S 
A band o f about 450bp was obtained after the E. ocella tus cDNA was subjected to PCR 
with the PLA2-specific primers (Fig.3.2). The ligation and transformation o f the PCR 
product, using TOPO TA Cloning Kit with TOPO 10F One Shot Competent Cell, 
generally resulted in a good yield o f recombinant colonies. On average, the overall ratio 
between the blue and the white colonies was 2:1. Over 25 white transformant colonies 
were screened by (Bam  HI and X hol) restriction enzyme digestion prior to DNA 
sequencing.
3.4.2 Analysis o f  E0PLA2 sequences
Twenty colonies [E0 PLA2-01 to E 0 PLA2-20] contained restriction fragments o f the correct 
size (450bp) and were therefore submitted for DNA sequencing. I submitted such a large 
number o f cDNAs for sequencing in the expectation o f amplifying a number o f distinct 
isomers. All the E 0 PLA2 clones consisted o f 415 nucleotides predicted to encode a protein 
of 138 amino acids with a molecular weight o f 15.7 kDa (Fig.3.3), which were identified 
(BLAST) as belonging to the sub-group II o f the phospholipase enzymes superfamily [The 
nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences o f all E0 PLA2 clones are presented in 
Appendix B]. Clones were considered to be distinct if they contained nucleotide 
differences leading to amino acid substitutions. On this basis, six {E0 PLA2-04, .E0PLA2- 
05,  oPLA2-09, .E0PLA2-IO, oPLA2- l l  and oPLA2- 12) o f the twenty clones isolated 
represented distinct variants (Fig.3.3a and Fig.3.3b). The predicted amino acid sequences
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A2 91
of Eo PL A 2-04 and ZsoPLA2-05 show a single amino acid substitution of (Thr) to (Ala) at 
position 38, whereas the other variants revealed substitution of several amino acids 
restricted to the C-terminal region (Fig.3.3b).

bands of known molecular weight (Lane 1). Lane 3 and 4, represents a positive control, 
using a SOD DNA template (1 Ong) as described in chapter 2, and a negative control where 
H20 , instead of DNA template, was used respectively.

3.4.3. PL A 2 sequence similarities between E. ocellatus and related viper
Because E0PLA2-O5 showed the greatest sequence similarity (BLAST) to PLA2S o f related 
vipers, this variant was selected for comparison with the other viper PLA2 in the 
remaining sections o f this chapter. The predicted amino acid sequence o f E0PLA2-05 was 
aligned with PLA2 sequences o f related vipers that showed the highest degree o f similarity 
during the BLAST search (Fig.3.4). The nearly identical E0PLA2 variants showed a high 
percent sequence similarity with PLA2 sequences from Botrops jararacussu (72%, 
X76289), Crotalus (61%, AF269131), Vipera ammodytes (57%, AF253048), E. coloratus 
(59%, AF253049), Macroviper palaestinae (59%, U60017), [Echis pyramidum leakeyi 
(EplPLA2-5, 56%), Echis sochureki (EsPLA2-4, 56%), Bahrati et al., 2003], Trimeresurus 
flavoviridis (53%, D10720), Bothrops asper (51%, AF109911), and Calloselasma 
rhodostoma (53%, AF104067). The E0PLA2S  sequence showed (Fig.3.4) the requisite 14 
cysteine residues that form the 7-disulphide bridges that define the characteristic tertiary 
structure o f group IIPLA2 enzymes. The amino acid sequence numbering o f Fig.3.3b and

Fi.g.3.4 are different because o f the gaps inserted into Fig.3.4 to optimize sequence 
alignment. The first 16 residues o f the E0PLA2S  matched the consensus signal peptides 
from other secreted PLA2S (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975; Bahrati et al., 2003). The 
signal peptide domain was followed by the amino terminal lipophilic residues of the 
substrate recognition domain. Although this PLA2 domain has been reported by 
Jeyaseelan et al., (2000) to be highly conserved, containing: Leu18, Phe21 and lie25 
(Fig.3.4), in E0PLA2-05 Leu18 was substituted with Val18 with unknown functional 
implications.
With the exception o f residues 46 and 48, a high degree o f conservation within the 
overlapping Ca+2-binding loop containing the glycine-rich sequence (Tyr40-Gly41-Cys42 - 
Tyr43-Cys44-Gly45-X46-Gly47-Gly48-X49-Gly50) was observed between E0PLA2-O5 and 
analogous sequences in venoms o f related vipers molecules (Fig.3.4).
Consistent with observations by Jeyaseelan et ah, (2000), the catalytic-site o f E0PLA2-05 
was very similar to that o f related viper species (Fig.3.4). This homology included the 
presence o f the His63 and Asn64/Lys64 [often cited as His48 and Asn49 in the literature 
where the 16 amino acid signal peptide was excluded] which characterise PLA2S. This 
Asn64 residue as well as the other conserved residues o f His63, Tyr67 and Tyr80, were 
known to be important for the formation o f the catalytic network (Jeyaseelan et al., 2000). 
His63 is highly conserved in PLA2 enzymes and plays a significant role in phopholipid 
hydrolysis, participating in catalysis (Verheij et al., 1980; Scott et al., 1992). Moreover, 
alkylation o f this residue leads to complete loss o f enzymatic activity and reduction o f the 
toxic and pharmacological effects o f PLA2S (Yang and King, 1980; Diaz-Oreiro and
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A  ? 96
Guteierrez, 1997). However, modification o f His-48 did not disturb the metal ion-protein 
interaction (Soares and Giglio, 2003). Thus, His-modified PLA2 enzymes are suitable for 
both in vitro and in vivo systems for studying the role o f enzymatic activity.
Kini and Evans (1987) identified the location o f an anticoagulant motif (residues 68-83) 
(Fig.3.4). Based on crystallography o f a PLA2 from C. atrox venom, Brunie, et ah, (1985) 
reported that this segment was found to vary from one isomer to the next. Moreover, it has 
been suggested that this segment ultimately helps to fix the position and orientation of 
Tyr82 (Fig.3.4) which has a critical role linking the amino terminus with the catalytic 
region.
The locations o f the (1-wing and the a-helix regions were identified by Kini and Evans 
(1989) as illustrated in Fig.3.3. Although these regions are completely conserved in all 
E0PLA2 variants, they were less conserved among PLA2 sequences o f other viper species. 
Both motifs are known to play an important structure/function role in the PLA2 molecule. 
The [3-wing substructure can adopt a variety o f orientations with respect to the enzymes 
proper and it may confer ancillary pharmacological properties such as anticoagulation 
(Kini and Evans, 1987). Scott, (1997) reported that the a-helix motif ensures a fixed active 
site geometry o f the PLA2 structure by (i) creating a rigid backbone brace for the 
substrate-binding pocket, (ii) assisting in the coordination o f the primary Ca2+, (iii) 
forming the deeper contours o f the hydrophobic channel (Cys44, Ala108, Ala109, Phe112) and
(iv) creating the catalytic network.

3.4.4. Phylogenetic Analysis
To determine the sequence evolutionary relationship o f E0PLA2-O5 with PLA2 of related 
viper species, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the CLUSTAL W program with 
PAM250 residue weight matrix (Thompson et al., 1994) (Fig.3.5). The amino acid 
sequence o f E0PLA2-O5 cDNA was very similar (68%) to the sequence o f a native PLA2 
from E. sochureki, Ecarpholin S (Polgar et al., 1996). Such sequence similarity suggests a 
direct genomic relationship. In contrast, the predicted amino acid sequence o f E0PLA2-O5 
showed only 35% identity to the peptide sequence o f a native PLA2 from E. p.leakeyi.
In general, this phylogenatic tree suggests that all the aligned PLA2 sequences originated 
from a common ancestor, Ecarpholin S from E. sochureki (Polgar et al., 1996). It also 
shows that E0PLA2-O5 diverged before the aligned venom PLA2 species, particularly that 
of Bothrops jararaca and Bothrops asper, respectively.

3.4.5. Hydrophilicityprofile
To determine whether protein encoded by E0PLA2-05 shared structural similarities with 
PLA2S o f other viper species, a hydrophilicity profile (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) was 
constructed (Fig.3.6). The hydrophilicity profile generally outlines the linear surface 
profile o f the molecule.
The hydrophilicity profile o f all the PLA2 molecules aligned in Fig.3.4. were remarkably 
similar, irrespective o f their geographical distribution, Ip, taxonomic designation and 
toxicity (Bahrati et al., 2003) and suggests that these variants would have common 
functional properties.
The purpose o f this chapter was to isolate E. ocellatus PLA2 cDNAs as immunisaing 
material to generate specific antibody. Surface epitopes o f proteins are highly likely to 
generate antibody and be site o f antibody binding. The surface exposed epitopes o f  
E0PLA2-05 were identical with that o f the other E0PLA2 variants (data not shown) and 
very similar to that o f other viper PLA2S. Therefore, it is predicted that future generation 
of antibodies against E0PLA2-05 immunogenic surface protein(s) will cross-react and 
neutralise PLA2 o f other viper species.

3.4.6. Analysis o f  E0PLA2 transcript
The sequences o f E0PLA2 1-20 were derived from E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA 
amplified by PCR with primers complementary to consensus 5  and 3  regions o f the open 
reading frame o f viper venom group IIPLA.?.
In order to establish the true RNA transcript size, E0PLA2S  TOPO construct was digested 
with both Bam HI and Xho I restriction enzymes. The purified E0PLA2-05 insert was 
labeled with 32P-(dCTP) and used to probe an E. ocellatus venom gland northern blot 
(RNA that had been denatured and electrophoretically fractionated and blotted onto a 
nylon membrane; Boehringer Mannheim). The hybridized filter was exposed to X-ray film 
for two weeks at -20C. The result as shown in (Fig.3.7) revealed a broad band o f 0.9kb 
which strongly suggests that the gene encoding the 416bp open reading frame o f E0PLA2- 
05 contains extensive upstream and downstream flanking sequences.

3.5. Discussion
Snake venom PLA2S have been reported to exhibit such diverse toxic effects as 
haemolysis, myotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and edema 
(Ogawa et al., 1995; Ohno et al., 2003). Several o f these can be present in the venom o f a 
single viper species (Kordis et al., 1998; Ohno et al., 2003). The overall objective o f the 
research described in this thesis is to generate toxin-neutralizing antibodies by 
immunisation with DNA encoding the major haemostasis-disruptive E. ocellatus venom 
toxins. Despite the medical importance o f E. ocellatus, there is little information in the 
literature and no sequences in the genetic databases on E. ocellatus venom PLA2. The E 
ocellatus cDNA library was therefore screened with PCR primers complimentary to 
consensus 5  and 3  flanking regions o f the open reading frame o f viper group IIPLA2.
A PCR product o f about 450bp (Fig.3.2) was ligated into a TA cloning vector (chapter 2) 
and this construct used to transform E. coli. Twenty colonies (E0PLA2 1-20) contained an 
insert o f the correct size. The sequences from the twenty colonies (Appendix B) were 
identified (BLAST) as belonging to the sub-group II o f the PLA2 superfamily. The 415 
nucleotides (excluding the two restriction enzymes and the two stop codons) correspond to 
an open reading frame that predicts a polypeptide o f 138 amino acids and a molecular 
weight o f 15.7kDa. The observed sequence discrepancies o f the E0PLA2 cDNAs revealed 
six distinct variants (Fig.3.3a-b) out o f the twenty clones mentioned above. The northern 
blot analysis revealed a major transcript band o f 0.9kb. According to the extensive 
literature survey o f venom PLA2 by Kini (1997), RNA of this size is within the acceptable 
range for the PLA2 transcripts or genes isolated from the Viperidae family.
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A j 104
The breadth o f the EoPLA2-05-hybridizing band in the Northern blot probably reflects the 
presence o f several isoforms which is consistent with the numerous E0PLA2 variants 
obtained here by PCR.
Analysis o f the deduced amino acids o f the E0PLA2 isoforms indicate eight distinctive 
segments: (1) a well-characterised, highly conserved signal peptide (composed o f 16 
amino acid residues) (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975), (2) a substrate recognition domain 
(containing lipophilic glycine-rich residues) (Jeyaseelan et al., 2000), (3) an overlapping 
Ca -binding loop, (4) sequences encoding the catalytic domain (Jeyaseelan et ah, 2000), 
(5) a short domain o f 15-amino acids encoding the anticoagulant region (Kini and Evans 
1987), (6) a p-wing domain, (7) a Helix-3 domain that plays a pivotal role in the structure 
and pharmacological activity o f PLA2 (Kini et ah, 1987 and Scott, 1997) and (8) the C- 
terminal cysteine rich domain, which characterises the sub-group II PLA2 (Kini, 1997) 
and is important to maintain a defined conformation external to the main globular mass 
structure o f PLA2 molecule (Brunie et ah, 1985).
The greatest discrepancy observed within the E0PLA2 variants was the number o f C- 
terminal Cys residue substitutions. These residues are important to the tertiary structure of 
the PLA2 molecule (Moura da Silva et ah, 1995). E0PLA2-O9 to E0PLA2-I2 isoforms 
showed a Met for Cys 133 substitution (Fig.3.2b). The other three variants, E0PLA2-IO- to 
12, differed from E0PLA2-O9 by a Leu for Cys133 substitution. However, whether the Cys 
substitutions at the C-terminal region have any negative impact on the structural and/or 
functional properties o f the protein molecules remains to be elucidated. The other very 
minor, amino acid substitutions o f the E0PLA2 variants outside the C-terminal region are
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A-> 105
however, unlikely to affect the tertiary structure because the positions o f  the 14 cysteine 
scaffold were well conserved and likely reflect a common lineage to PLA2 enzymes in 
other vipers (Moura da Silva et al., 1995).
Generally the extensive sequence similarity between the E0PLA2 variants and PLA2S from 
related vipers is interesting because it highlights regions o f the protein sequence that are 
important to the structure or function o f PLA2. The multiple sequence alignment generated 
by MegAlign-[DNA STAR software] (Fig.3.4) showed that there are extensive regions of 
sequence similarity between E0PLA2-O5 and PLA2 from other vipers. Moreover, since 
these vipers are taxonomically and geographically distinct, the conservation o f these 
motifs suggests that they are related to the structure and/or function o f  this family o f  
toxic enzymes. The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig.3.5 demonstrated that PLA2 from E. 
sochureki may be the common ancestor o f this group o f enzymes. It also shows that the 
PLA2 molecules from the related viper species may have emerged after the divergence o f  
the E0PLA2-O5 molecule.
In order to assign potential functional attributes to a PLA2 molecule, its deduced amino 
acid sequence is usually analysed for the existence o f certain criteria including (a) the 
expression o f Lys or Asn residues at position 64 (including the signal peptide) which is 
known to confer calcium-mediated catalytic activity, (b) the number o f lysine residues 
within the anticoagulant domain and (c) pH. The latter criteria to predict PLA2 function is 
controversial. Thus, although the catalytic properties o f PLA2 molecules are not correlated 
with their pis (Fuly et al, 2002), Mounier et al., (2000) reported that the phospholipid- 
independent anticoagulant effect appears to be relevant for some basic venom SPLA2.
Chapter 3: Molecular cloning and characterization o f  novel cDNAs encoding Echis ocellatus phospholipase A 3 106
All the E0PLA2 variants examined here possessed the consensus catalytic domain, 
including the characteristic Asp64 residue (Fig.3.4). This indicates that all E0PLA2S 
possess catalytic potential. With regards the possible linkage between PLA2 function and 
pi; among the PLA2S isoforms aligned in Fig.3.4, only the B. asper, B. jararacussu 
(Moura-da-Silva et al., 1995) and Ecarpholin S from E. sochureki (Polgar et al., 1996) 
showed a basic pi (Fig.3.5) despite the known functionality o f PLA2S from many of these 
species. Therefore, the predicted acidic pi for EPLA2 may not be useful to assign a 
function to the encoded proteins. In the absence o f isolating and determining the 
functional activities o f E. ocellatus venom PLA2, these structure/function predictions 
illustrate the problems o f using cDNA-derived amino acid sequence data to predict 
functional characteristics o f proteins that exist as multiple isoforms, each with the 
potential to effect distinct functions (Bahrati et al., 2003).
Despite the geographical distribution, taxonomic designation and pi distinctions between 
E0PLA2-O5 and PLA2 from other viper the hydrophilic profile plot (Fig.3.6) and antigenic 
index (data not shown) showed that the predicted structure o f E0PLA2-O5 was remarkably 
similar to PLA2 o f other vipers. This may reflect common molecular properties as well as 
functional attributes o f these protein isoforms. In the context o f the overall 
immunotherapeutic objective o f this work, it is predicted that transfection o f mammalian 
cells with PLA2-encoding DNA is likely to present to the immune system molecules that 
faithfully represent native venom PLA2 (Bahrati et al., 2003) and that the generated 
antibody has the potential to cross react and neutralize all PLA2 variants in E. ocellatus 
and also those in venoms of related viper species.

cDNAs encoding C-type lectins
Chapter 4: Cloning and characterization o f  novel Echis ocellatus cDNAs encoding C-type lectins 108
4.1. Introduction
Venoms o f Viperidae contain a wide variety o f  proteins which affect haemostasis by 
activating or inhibiting the function o f platelets or coagulation factors as stated in Chapter 
1. These components have been classified into groups based on structure and mode of 
action. The snake venom C-type lectin (svCTL) group o f proteins was first identified in 
the venom o f Bothrops atrox (Gartner et al., 1980). The svCTL protein closely resembles 
the primary structure and disulphide bond arrangement o f the mammalian C-type lectins 
(Horii et al., 2003) such as mannose-binding protein (Weis et al., 1991) and the selectins 
(Chou, 1996). Snake venom CTLs typically have a molecular weight o f  approximately 30 
kDa and are commonly found as heterodimeric proteins consisting o f homologous a and P 
subunits linked by a single inter-chain disulphide bridge (Sarray et al., 2003). Higher 
molecular weight forms o f disulphide-linked multimers, ranging from ~50 to 150 kDa, 
have also been reported by several authors (Taniuchi et al., 1995; Polgar et al., 1997; 
Wang et al., 2001a).
A  striking feature o f venom CTLs is that they are structurally homologous but functionally 
distinct (Wei et al., 2002). Viper venom CTLs possess a range o f pharmacological 
functions including binding to coagulation factors DC and X and inhibiting the clotting 
cascade or having agonistic or antagonistic effects on platelet aggregation (Wisner et al., 
2002). Those exhibiting anticoagulant activities bind to y-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)- 
containing domains o f the coagulation factors IX and X in the presence o f calcium ions 
(Wang, 2001a; Atoda et al., 2002). Examples o f such svCTL proteins include IX/X 
binding protein (bp) from the venom of the Habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) (Atoda 
and Morita, 1989), acutus IX/X-bp from the venom o f Deinagkistrodon acutus (Cox,
Chapter 4: Cloning and characterization o f  novel Echis ocellatus cDNAs encoding C-type lectins 109
1993) , ECLV IX/X-bp from the venom of Echis carinatus leucogaster [now known as E. 
leucogaster] (Chen and Tsai, 1996) and jararaca IX/X-bp from the venom o f Bothrops 
jararaca (Sekiya et al., 1993). Other, venom CTLs activate the coagulation cascade 
through distinct routes such as that exerted by bothrojararacin, a thrombin inhibitor from 
venom o f B. jararaca, which binds the exosite o f a-thrombin (Zingali et al., 1993). Snake 
venom CTLs also inhibit or activate platelet aggregation by modulating their binding 
interactions to their specific receptors, including glycoprotein (GP) lb, a2pi, GPVI and 
von Willebrand factor (vWf) (Navdaev et al., 2001b; Polgar 1997; Shin and Morita 1998; 
Wang et al., 2001a). Most o f the platelet aggregation-inhibitory CTLs bind to GPIb, 
including Echicetin from the venom o f the saw-scaled viper, Echis carinatus (Peng et al.,
1994) , jararaca GPIb-binding protein from B. jararaca venom (Fujimura et al., 1996); 
alboaggregin-B from the venom of white-lipped tree viper Trimeresurus albolabris (Peng 
et al., 1994); Flavocetin-A from T. flavoviridis (Taniuchi et al., 1995); CHH-A and B from 
the venom of the timber rattle snake Crotalus horridus horridus (Andrews et al., 1996); 
Tokaracetin from T. tokarensis venom (Kawasaki et al., 1995). Other venom CTLs bind to 
distinct receptors including, (i) vWF (Botrocetin from B. jararca venom) (Andrews et al., 
1989; Fujimura et al., 1991); (ii) GPla [Aggretin from C. rhodostoma venom, (Huang et 
al., 1995)] and (iii) GPVI [Convulxin from C.d. terificin venom (Polgar et al., 1997)]. 
Some o f these CTLs exhibit additional affects such as that shown by Echicetin [see 
Chapter-1], that blocks platelet interaction with both vW f and thrombin (Navdaev et al., 
2001a).
The existence o f multiple forms o f snake venom CTLs within a single species, as shown 
for example a B. jararaca and E. carinatus snake venoms, is likely to contribute to the
Chapter 4: Cloning and characterization o f  novel Echis ocellatus cDNAs encoding C-type lectins 110
diverse biological effects exerted by venom o f Viperidae. Despite the medical importance 
of E. ocellatus, comparatively nothing is known about the contribution o f CTL activity to 
the pathology o f E. ocellatus envenoming. Therefore, the experimental objective o f this 
chapter was to isolate different isoforms o f CTLs from the E. ocellatus cDNA library.

A PCR strategy was used to isolate sequences encoding CTLs from the E. ocellatus 
venom gland cDNA library. Primers complementary to the highly conserved amino- 
terminal signal peptide and to the less conserved carboxy-terminal domains o f published 
CTL DNA sequences o f related viper species were designed (Table 4.1)

4.4. Results
4.4.1 Isolation o f cDNAs encoding E. ocellatus CTLs
The expected PCR product of approximately 450 bp was obtained by PCR of venom gland 
cDNA using the two CTL-specific primers (Fig.4.2). The amplified DNA was ligated into 
the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and used to transform competent E. coli [TOPO 10F 
One Shot (Invetrogen)]. A good yield of recombinant colonies was obtained [1:1 ratio of 
blue and white colonies]. Bam HI and Xho I restriction enzymes digestion was performed 
as a first step procedure to screen transformed white colonies, prior DNA sequencing.

4.4.2. Analysis o f  the isolated cDNA-encoding E. ocellatus CTLs
Of the thirty recombinant colonies containing DNA inserts o f 450 bp, twelve were found 
to encode full-length CTL genes (Fig.4.3a and Fig.4.3b). Nine o f the thirty EoCTL  
sequences were distinct at the nucleotide sequence level. Where two or more identical 
sequences were obtained, a single representative cDNA was used for subsequent analysis. 
The predicted amino acid sequences o f these cDNAs were subjected to BLAST (Altschul 
et al., 1997) searches o f the GenBank, PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF databases to confirm 
their CTL identity (Fig.4.4). All o f the E. ocellatus cDNA consisted o f 441 nucleotides 
(Fig.4.3a) that were predicted to encode an open reading frame o f 148 amino acids (17.2 
kDa) o f (Fig.4.3b). A phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig.4.3c) was used to categorise the nine 
EoCTL  sequences into six distinct groups, based entirely on sequence alignment. 
Alignment o f the predicted amino acid sequences o f the nine EoCTL revealed extensive 
sequence variation.
4.4.3. Sequence alignment ofE. ocellatus CTLs.
Group 1 contained EoCTL-01, EoCTL-05, EoCTL-09, EoCTL-22, EoCTL-23, EoCTL-25  
and EoCTL-30, which showed a 99.3 % sequence identity [differing by 2 residues as 
illustrated in Fig.4.3b]. The remaining CTL variants were represented by single EoCTL 
cDNAs: group 2 [EoCTL-2] differ from group 1 by 9 residues substitutions. In contrast to 
group 1 and 2, groups 3-6 show significant sequence variations which may represent 
distinct EoCTL isoforms. For instance, group 5 [EoCTL-27] did not contain the consensus 
methionine start codon and its amino terminal sequence differed markedly from the highly 
conserved signal peptide sequence (residues 1-23). Intriguingly, EoC TL-27  had a similar

amino terminal sequence to EsCTL-3 from Echis sochureki (Harrison et al., 2003) but the 
down-stream sequence o f EoCTL-27 was very different (Harrison et al., 2003). The 
distinct 5 sequence composition o f Eo CTL-27 was therefore not considered to be the 
result o f a cloning artefact.
The deduced amino acid sequences o f all EoCTLs possessed the cysteine scaffold that 
defines the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) o f mammalian CTLs (Drickamer, 
1988; Speiss, 1990) that bind sugars in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Disulphide bridges 
formed between C27 and C38, C55 and C144 and between C121 and C136 (as indicated by 
arrows in Fig.4.2b) are conserved in all the EoCTL sequences, except in those o f groups 3 
and 4 where the C121 and C136 were substituted with other residues as shown in Fig.4.3b. 
The CRD-invariant residues W31, W48, W90-X-G92, W105-X-X-G107 and W131 (Wisner et 
a., 2002) are represented in all the EoCTL groups, except groups 3. Group 3 showed I 
substitutions for the W residue at position 105 and 131, respectively. All the E. ocellatus 
venom CTL groups showed a G92 and L110 residue substitutions for W92 and P110, 
respectively that are conserved in mammalian CRD sequences. Furthermore, the EoCTLs 
cDNA sequences did not encode the E-P-N and Q-P-D triplets associated with CRD 
binding o f the mammalian mannose and galactose CTLs, respectively.

4.4.4. Analysis o f  the E. ocellatus clusters with analogous CTLs in venoms o f related

Viper venom CTL sequences from the Viperidae genetic databases that showed significant 
sequence similarity to EoCTLs were selected for comparison (Fig.4.4) on the basis of 
highest BLAST matches and their phylogenetic or geographic relatedness to E. ocellatus 
CTLs: ECLV IX/X bp p (AAB36402) from E. leucogaster venom (Chen and Tsai, 1996), 
Echicetin P (P81996) from E. carinatus venom (Peng et al., 1994), Convulxin P 
(CAA76182) from C. durissus terrificus venom (Leduc and Bon, 1998), Alboaggregin a  
subunit 4 (P81114) from T. albolabris venom (Kowalska et al., 1998), a  (D83331) and P 
(D83332) IX/X bp subunits from T. flavoviridis venom (Matsuzaki et ah, 1996), 
Flavocetin-A P subunit (AAN72437) also from T. flavoviridis venom (Shin et ah, 2000), 
Aggretin (JC7105) from C. rhodostoma venom (Chung et ah, 1999), a  (AF176420) and P 
(BAB20441) subunits from Deinagkistrodon acutus venom (direct submissions), a  
(AF190827) and P (AF197915) subunits from Gloydius halys venom (direct submissions), 
Es CTL-3 (AY254332) and Es CTL-8 (AY254334) from E. sochurecki venom, Epl CTL-4 
and Epl CTL-7 (AY254338 & AY254340), from E. p. leakeyi venom, and Ba CTL-6 
(AY254328) from B. arietans venom (Harrison et ah, 2003a).
Groups 1-3 represent novel, highly similar, CTL isomers with highest sequence similarity 
to CTLs isolated from E. p. leakeyi, E. sochureki and B. arietans (Harrison et ah, 2003a). 
Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that groups 1-4 were most closely associated with P- 
subunit CTLs (Fig.4.5). EoCTL-27 and EoCTL-26 were grouped in the same clade as the 
P-subunit o f Echicetin from E. carinatus venom and EoCTL-20 showed greatest sequence

4.4.5. Predicted antigenic profiles ofE. ocellatus CTL-01
The main objective o f this research project is to develop toxin-neutralising antibodies by 
immunisation with DNA encoding specific venom toxins (Harrison et al., 2000b, 2002). 
The high degree o f sequence similarity between EoCTL-1 and CTLs o f E.p. leakeyi, E. 
sochureki and B. arietans suggested that immunisation with EoCTL-1 could generate 
antibodies reactive with CTL analogous in venoms of these phylogentically related vipers. 
To investigate this possibility I compared the predicted immunogenicity o f these CTL 
sequences using an algorithm developed by Jameson-Wolf (Fig.4.6).
Line A  approximately corresponds to the residues C-Y-K (38-40, Fig.4.4) and is common 
to all EoCTL groups, except group 4. The highly conserved domain between residues 48- 
55 (W-A-D-A-E-K-F-C) is not predicted to be immunogenic (Harrison et al., 2003a). 
Line B corresponds to the residues around H-L-L/V-S (63-66) and is common to groups 1- 
6 and all analogous CTL molecules. Lines C [residues around C145] and (D) (V-C-K/E at 
positions 152-154) appear to represent immunogenic domains common to all EoCTLs and 
most published African viper venom CTL sequences, except group 4 EoCTL which 
encoded RLQ motif a unique carboxyl end.

4.5. Discussion
Viper venom CTLs possess a range o f pharmacological functions that disrupt haemostasis 
at several distinct levels. The overall objective o f my research project was to generate, by 
DNA immunisation, antibodies capable o f neutralizing the function o f the major E. 
ocellatus venom toxins. Prior to this study, there were no E. ocellatus CTL DNA or amino 
acid sequences described in the literature or genetic databases. The objective o f the 
research in this chapter was therefore to isolate and characterise cDNA-encoding CTL 
from the E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA library.
My utilisation o f a low-stringency PCR approach was successful in amplifying several 
sequence-distinct CTL isoforms. Most o f the isolated EoCTL sequences described here, 
except those o f groups 3 and 6, contained all the cysteine residues and most o f the 
associated amino acid motifs that define the CRD domain and overall architecture o f the 
mammalian and viper CTL sequences (Drickamer, 1988; Spiess, 1990).
The E. ocellatus CTL sequences o f groups 1 and 2 appear to be highly similar CTL 
subunits that are novel to the genetic database o f Serpentes as illustrated in Fig.4.4. In 
common with CTL P-subunits o f flavocetin-A and convulxin from venoms o f T. 
flavoviridis and C. d. terrificus, respectively (Shin et al., 2000; Leduc and Bon, 1998), 
CTLs o f groups 1-3 contained a double cysteine motif at positions 26 and 27, which have 
been invoked to differentiate between P- and from a-CTL subunits (Shin et al., 2000). 
The existence o f an additional cysteine residue at position 26 in the N-terminal o f P-CTL 
subunits is thought to form a disulphide bridge with the C-terminal cysteine residue o f a-
Chapter 4:  Cloning and characterization o f  novel Echis ocellatus cDNAs encoding C-type lectins 123
subunits, thereby permitting the polymerisation o f these peptides into heterodimeric 
molecules (Wisner et al., 2002). Although they lacked the additional C26 residue, the 
sequences in groups 4-6 were most closely associated with P-CTL subunits. It is 
concluded from the absence o f  an initiating methionine and non-signal peptide-like N- 
terminal sequence o f group 5 (EoCTL-27) that these sequences are derivatives from other 
genes, presumably the group IV metalloproteinases that bind CTL subunits at either the 
carboxyl (Bjamason and Fox, 1994) or amino terminal ends (Kini, 1996). I have attempted 
to use the percent sequence similarity between the EoCTL sequences and those published 
by Harrison et al., (2003a) as well as published CTLs o f known function to predict and 
classify the related function(s) for these new EoCTL isoforms. However, the sequence- 
function relationship o f snake venom CTLs, and probably many other venom toxins, is 
still insufficiently understood to confidently assign a function to a molecule based solely 
on sequence characteristics.
The extraordinarily high degree o f sequence conservation o f the CTL molecules 
[particularly group 1CTL] between the phylogenetically and geographically distinct E. 
ocellatus, E. p. leakeyi, E. sochureki and B. arietans (Fig.4.4 and Fig.4.5) indicate the 
evolutionary importance o f the multimeric nature o f EoCTLs. Here, and as frequently 
observed in the snake venom literature (Deshimaru et al., 1996; Nakashima et al., 1993), 
the DNA sequences encoding these EoCTLs [and those o f other Echis and Bit is species 
(Harrison et al., 2003a)] showed a higher level o f sequence conservation than the deduced 
amino acid sequences (Harrison et al., 2003a). Accelerated evolution o f snake venom 
toxins may reflect an evolutionary selection mechanism which provides the snake with a 
wider spectrum o f substrates for each enzyme family and thereby increases the scope of
Chapter 4: Cloning and characterization o f  novel Echis ocellatus cDNAs encoding C-type lectins 124
prey vulnerable to venom. The similarity o f the inter-specific and inter-generic sequences 
o f CTLs from the E. ocellatus, E.p. leakeyi, E. sockureki and B. arietans may indicate that 
accelerated venom toxin evolution is regulated by a sophisticated control mechanism, 
rather than by a system that simply accepts degenerative substitutions.
One o f the objectives o f this project was to evaluate the range o f CTL molecules that are 
likely to be represented in venom of the saw-scaled viper, E. ocellatus, in order to guide 
the design o f DNA-immunisation constructs required to generate toxin-specific antibodies 
as described in Chapter 7 o f this thesis. The predicted antigenic profiles o f the group 1 
(EoCTL-01) and other viper species illustrated in (Fig.4.6) indicate that neutralisation of 
this complex group o f toxins will require antibodies with several specificities. Thus, an 
antibody raised by immunisation with group 1 DNA is likely to be effective against the 
gene products o f only group 1 and 2 CTL. Therefore, to be confident o f neutralising the 
function o f this group o f venom toxins, Harrison et ah, (2003a) speculated the requirement 
of between six to eight CTL antibody specificities. However, because o f the conserved 
sequence characteristic o f the Echis and Bids CTL isoforms, it is possible that these 
isomer-specific antibodies will neutralise this important group o f functionally diverse 
toxins in venoms o f the most important African vipers across their geographic range.

5.1. Introduction
Snake venoms contain a great variety o f toxic proteases. Many o f these components are 
proteases (e.g., metalloproteases, serine proteases, phospholipases A2) and mediate their 
toxicity by either stimulating or inhibiting the haemostatic system of human victims or 
experimental animals, resulting in clinical complications o f blood clotting or uncontrolled 
haemorrhage (Hutton and Warrell, 1993; Markland, 1998; Stocker, 1990; Matsui et ah, 
2000; Markland, 1998a). Several o f these proteinases cleave plasma proteins o f the 
victims in a specific manner with varying degrees o f substrate specificity. Thus, while 
some serine proteases have both fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activities, others have 
only fibrinogenolytic activity and are called 'thrombin-like' proteases (Markland, 1991; 
1998; Pirkle et ah, 1986; 1990). The latter hydrolyze fibrinogen specifically and release 
either fibrinopeptide A  or B or both (Hutton and Warrell, 1993) resulting in the disruption 
o f the blood coagulation system by producing abnormal fibrin clots composed of short 
polymers that are rapidly dispersed and no longer cross-linked by activated factor XIII. 
Another group o f serine proteases such as Batroxobin, Crotalase and Ancrod cleave 
fibrinogen in manner distinct from that o f thrombin. Other venom serine proteases 
function like mammalian kallikrein (or kininogenase) releasing bradykinin from kininogen 
(Bjamason et ah, 1983; Komori et ah, 1998) and are called 'kallikrein-like' proteases 
(Bjamason et ah, 1983), an example o f this is halystase (Matsui et ah, 1998), a kallikrein- 
like serine protease isolated from A. halys blomhqffii venom, which cleaves the P chain at 
Arg42 and slowly degrades the a chain o f fibrinogen to generate a product that is no longer 
converted to normal fibrin clots by thrombin; this results in both reduction o f blood 
pressure as well as inhibiting fibrinogen clotting in the victims. Another kallikrein-like
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocellatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 127
serine protease with potent biological activity but with different physicochemical 
properties from those o f halystase has been isolated from the same venom; a number o f  
the other kallikrein-like serine proteases have also been isolated from the venoms of A. 
caliginosus, C. atrox and C. viridis (Iwanaga et al., 1976; Bjamason et al., 1983). In 
addition, there have been a few reports on venom serine proteases with a unique activity, 
such as ACC-C, a protein C activator isolated from the A. contortrix venom (Parry et al.,
1998), [which inhibits blood coagulation by inactivating the activated forms o f factor V 
and VIII], a plasminogen activator such as TSV-PA isolated from the T. stejnegeri venom 
(Zhang et al., 1995: Zhang et al., 1997), PA-BJ, a platelet aggregating enzyme isolated 
from the B. jararaca venom (Serrano et al., 1995) and RVV-V, a factor V-activating 
enzyme isolated from the V. russelli venom (Tokunaga et al., 1988).
These data indicate that snake venom serine proteases comprise an enzyme superfamily 
with multifunctional activities that may have diverged or have undergone gene duplication 
resulting in alteration o f their biological properties during the process o f evolution thus 
acquiring special functions (Perona and Craik, 1997). Although a considerable amount of 
data is now available, no standardised grouping o f these venom serine proteases has yet 
been documented. However, in 2001b Wang et al. compared sequences o f 40 serine 
proteinases isolated from different snake venoms, using a constructed phylogram in which 
such sequences were clustered into three groups designated as coagulating enzymes, 
kininogenases, and plasminogen activators.
No Serine proteinases have yet been purified from venom of the West African saw scaled 
viper Echis ocellatus, in particular or for members o f the Echis genus in general.
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocelfatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 128
However, the fact that the serine protease superfamily was important in the venom of the 
Viperidae suggested that such enzymes should be present in the venom offs, ocellatus and 
that serine protease-specific antibodies are likely to be an important factor in E. ocellatus 
envenoming. I therefore, screened the E. ocellatus cDNA library in order to isolate and 
characterise different isoforms or variants o f this enzyme superfamily.

5.2. D esigning prim ers
To isolate sequences encoding serine proteases from the E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA 
library a PCR strategy similar to that demonstrated in Chapter 3 was employed. Primers 
complimentary to the highly conserved amino-terminal signal peptide and to the highly 
conserved carboxy-terminal domains o f published serine protease DNA sequences o f  
related viper species were designed as shown Table 5.1.

5.3. Results
5.3.1. Isolation o f  eDISAs encoding E. ocellatus serine proteases 
A PCR product of the expected size, approximately 800 bp, was obtained (Fig.5.1) after 
amplification of the cDNA library using the two serine protease-specific primers. The 
amplified DNA was ligated into the TA cloning vector (Invetrogen) and used to transform 
chemically competent E. coli [TOPO 1 OF One Shot (Invitrogen)]. A good yield of 
recombinant colonies was obtained [1:1 ratio of blue and white colonies]. Bam HI and Xho 
1 restriction enzyme digestion was performed as a first step procedure to screen 
transformed white colonies prior to DNA sequencing.

5.3.2. Nucleotide sequence analysis o f  E. ocellatus serine protease cDNAs 
After PCR amplification and cloning, the nucleotide sequences o f 15 cDNA clones were 
determined by DNA sequencing [Beckman Coulter CEQ2000 XL DNA Analysis 
System] as illustrated in Fig.5.2a. The complete amino acid sequences were predicted 
from the cDNA nucleotide sequences and aligned as shown in Fig.5.2b using MegAlign- 
DNASTAR software. The 780-bp cDNA had an open-reading frame o f 260 amino acids 
with a calculated molecular weight o f 28.5 kDa. The sequence similarities between the 14 
serine proteases from E. ocellatus were analyzed further by constructing a phylogram 
(Fig.5.3) using the MegAlign-DNA STAR program on the basis o f their complete amino 
acid sequences. Unfortunately the result o f the phylogenetic tree was not significant in 
grouping the 14 EoSP clones. Therefore, I have characterized such sequences in terms o f 
their structural properties as an alternative means o f grouping.

An analysis o f surface probability using the amino acid sequences o f all EoSP clones 
were performed using Protean software (DNASTAR, USA). This was successful in 
grouping the 14 EoSP clones into four distinct groups (Fig.5.4). A single clone (EoSP-01, 
EoSP-03, EoSP-07 and EoSP-17) from each group was selected as a representative clone 
and used for the subsequent analyses.

The predicted amino acid sequences o f the EoSP-01, EoSP-03, EoSP-07 and EoSP-17 
were submitted to BLAST searches o f the genetic data bases and their similarity to 
published viper serine protease (table 5.2, Fig.5.5) confirmed that the EoSP cDNAs 
encoded serine proteases.
5.3.5. Comparison o f  E. ocellatus cDNAs with analogous serine proteases from other

The complete amino acid sequences o f the EoSP variants were aligned with those o f other 
venom serine proteases (Fig.5.5). All the FoSP-variants contained the serine protease- 
consensus 24 amino acid signal peptide sequence (Fig.5.5 arrows), including the six- 
amino acids activated motif. The signal peptide residues were followed by a protease 
domain o f 236 residues. The deduced primary structures o f all EoSP cDNA clones 
include the requisite, highly conserved, 12 cysteine residues that form the 6-disulphide 
bonds responsible for the characteristic tertiary structure o f venom serine proteases.

5.3.6. Antigenic profile analysis o f  E. ocellatus serine proteases with analogous 
molecules.
Since the future aim of this research project is to develop toxin-neutralising antibodies by 
immunisation with DNA encoding specific toxins in venom o f the E. ocellatus, I next 
compared the algorithm-predicted immunogenicity o f the E. ocellatus serine protease 
cDNA sequences with those o f (BLAST) analogous toxin molecules from other vipers. 
The predicted antigenic profiles (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) o f  the published and new E. 
ocellatus serine proteases were analysed as shown in Fig.5.6 using Protean software 
(DNASTAR, USA). The deduced signal peptide domains o f  the EoSP variants are 
separated by a vertical dotted line, as these would normally be cleaved from the native 
proteins during posttranslational. The thin vertical boxes depict the residues comprising 
the catalytic traid, H/R/N, D/G/N and S/P/N/T (67, 110 and 208), that show the greatest 
phylogenetic conservation as demonstrated in Fig.5.5.

5.5. Discussion
The existence o f multiple forms o f serine proteases in the venom of a single viper species 
is likely to contribute to the diverse biological effects exerted by the whole venom. 
Therefore screening the E. ocellatus cDNA library to isolate different isoforms or variants 
of serine proteases was the aim o f this research chapter.
The results obtained in this chapter provide the first molecular sequence data for E. 
ocellatus serine proteases they also reveal that the serine protease composition o f E. 
ocellatus is as complex as that o f the better characterised Viperidae species.
The utilization o f PCR amplification o f E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA with the new 
viper serine protease-specific primers was successful and produced fourteen cDNAs 
sequences that were identified (BLAST) as belonging to the serine protease enzyme 
family. All EoSP cDNAs were o f  similar total length (approximately 0.80 kb) and 
encoded 260 amino acids (Fig.5.2b) with a predicted molecular weight o f 28.5 kDa.
To differentiate between the isolated EoSP clones a surface probability algorithm was 
used to assign the 14 E. ocellatus serine protease cDNAs into four main groups (Fig.5.3). 
A single representative clone from each group was chosen for further analyses as 
described in section 5.3.3.
The sequence similarity between the EoSP variants proteins was less than 60% for the 
mature protein-coding region but over 90% for regions coding both the signal peptide and 
the carboxyl-terminal end. Thus the latter two regions are highly conserved, which
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocellatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 142
explains why the PCR experiment to amplify the cDNAs-encoding EoSP clones was 
successful.
The EoSP cDNA sequences were confirmed by BLAST searches as encoding serine 
proteases (Fig.5.5). The greatest sequence similarity was between EoSP-7 and B. 
gabonica and V. labetina (80% and 85%) with the remaining EoSP cDNAs showing 60- 
76% sequence similarity with other snake venom serine proteinases as illustrated in Table
5.2. From the proteins with known biological activity, sequence similarities o f the EoSP 
variants (i.e., EoSP-01, EoSP-03, EoSP-07 and EoSP-lT) were 62-69% with the kinin
releasing and fibrinogen-clotting serine protease (KN-BJ) from venom o f B. jararaca 
(Serrano et al., 1998) (Table 5.2).
The putative 18 amino acid signal-peptide o f the EoSP variants was as conserved (over 
90% sequence similarity) as that in the serine proteases o f other viper species (Fig.5.5) 
(arrows). Following the signal peptide all the EoSP variants contained the predicted six- 
amino acid cleavage (activation) site Q-K/T/M/E-S-S-E-L/P (Fig.5.5 in green) as 
proposed for batroxobin (Itoh et al., 1987); thus cleavage generates a hydrophilic 
zymogen peptide, based on the processing site o f pre-peptides o f mammalian serine 
proteinases (Swift et al., 1982; MacDonald et al., 1982; MacDonald et al., 1982).
Comparison o f the EoSP variants with analogous members o f the serine protease family 
revealed that all EoSP variants encoded the presumed catalytic triad, which is common to 
venom serine proteases H67, D 110 and S208 as shown in Fig.5.5. Such residues were highly 
conserved in groups 1-3, except proteins o f group 4 (Fig.5.2b, Fig.5.5) which contain R 
instead o f H at the same position (Fig.5.5). Furthermore, comparison o f the EoSP amino
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocellatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 143
acid sequence alignment with analogous venom serine proteases (Fig.5.5) revealed a 
conserved consensus active site o f L-T/S-A-A-H/R/N-C corresponding to position 63-68, 
as previously determined by Brenner (1988).
Using the primary structure o f EoSP variants (Fig.5.5) the putative N-linked 
glycosylation sites, Asn-X-Thr/Ser (Bell et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1985), were found and 
are located at two different positions. EoSP-01, EoSP-03 and EoSP-17 [N44-X45-S46 and 
N257-X258-T259] and EoSP-07 [N124-R,25-T126 and N257-T258-T258]. Although such motifs 
are thought to be needed for protein stabilization rather than for the catalytic function o f 
the venom enzymes (Komori and Nikai, 1998), confirmation o f  the roles o f such motifs in 
venom proteases remain to be investigated.
All serine proteases have a common pattern o f 6-disulphide bridges (Nikai et al., 1995). 
This was found in all EoSP clones (Fig. 5.2b) that encoded the common 12 cysteine 
residues in which are strongly conserved forming putative disulphide bridges which are 
located at Cys31 Cys52, C68, C100, C145, C165, C176, C204, C214, C229 and C260 (Fig.5.5). This 
suggests that the EoSP proteins possess a similar tertiary structure to that o f other serine 
proteases which are well characterized.
Despite such sequence and structural conservation, viper venom serine proteases show 
very divergent effects on haemostasis as previously stated in section 5.1. In some cases 
certain amino acid sequences have been shown to be responsible for such effects as 
demonstrated in Table 5.3. Although such table gives a preliminary prediction o f the 
functional characterization o f the EoSP cDNAs in comparison with well known 
characterized venom serine proteases, it can not be considered as a functional
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocellatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 144
confirmation or even a categorization strategy to differentiate between the four EoSP 
cDNAs. However, from Fig.5.5 and Table 5.3 it can be generally concluded that such 
comparison demonstrates that the enzymes encoded by the four EoSP cDNAs confer 
multiple haemostasis-disruptive activities to E. ocellatus venom. Furthermore, the 
sequence and predicted structural similarities o f these four EoSP groups suggest that an 
antibody generated to one group may be capable o f neutralizing the other group o f EoSPs. 
To examine this permeability the sequences o f EoSP groups were subjected to a more 
specific algorithm that predicted amino acid motifs o f high immunogenicity.
A protein structure-predicting algorithm [Jameson and Wolf, 1988] has been used (i) to 
identify domains o f strong antigenic potential in the toxin gene product and (ii) to 
determine whether these domains are conserved in analogous venom toxin gene products 
o f related vipers. The signal peptide was separated from the mature protein by dotted line 
as would be cleaved post-translationally.
The peaks shown by the EoSPs profile indicate the numerous domains predicted to have a 
surface location and potential for antibody induction. Although the antigenic peaks o f the 
catalytic traid o f the EoSPs showed less similarity with that o f the analogous venom SPs 
particularly those at residues 67 and 110, many antigenic residue similarities o f EoPs are 
shared with other SVSPs o f related vipers. Therefore, it is likely that antibodies raised by 
EoPS DNA immunisation are likely to possess considerable cross-reactivity and might 
competitively inhibit the function o f these domains in the similar venom toxins o f related 
vipers. However, binding o f antibodies specific to conserved antigenic domains without a 
known function are equally as likely to disrupt protein function by virtue of steric
Chapter 5: Serine protease variants encoded by Echis ocellatus venom gland cDNA: cloning and sequencing analysis 145
hindrance. The veracity o f these speculations need to be confirmed experimentally and 
thus is a focus o f our current research.
In conclusion the predicted Jameson-Wolf antigenic profiles (DNASTAR, USA) of the 
EoSP variants aligned with very low identity to their (BLAST) analogous serine 
proteases. This observation strongly suggests that an antibody raised by immunisation 
with group one EoSP DNA is likely to be less effective against the gene products of 
groups 2, 3 or 4. Therefore additional antibodies generated against antigenic index that 
showed less conservation will be required.

6.1. Introduction
Venoms from viperid and crotalid snakes exert broadly similar local and systemic effects. The 
literature indicates that the snake venom zinc-metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are arguably the 
most clinically significant group o f viper toxins (Bjamason and Fox, 1994; 1995; Gutierrez 
and Rucavado, 2000).
SVMPs have been shown to be a major cause o f  local pathology such as haemorrhage, 
oedema and ischaemia (Kamiguti et ah, 1996; Laing et ah, 2003). Haemorrhage represents an 
especially difficult problem because it develops quickly after venom injection causing 
extensive microvascular damage and blood loss (Borkow et ah, 1993). In addition to 
haemorrhage, some viperine SVMPs have been shown to induce skeletal muscle damage and 
myonecrosis, which seems to be secondary to the ischaemia that ensues in muscle tissue as a 
consequence o f bleeding and reduced perfusion (Gutierrez et ah, 2000). Furthermore, SVMPs 
are also capable o f initiating a cascade o f pro-inflammatory responses indirectly via the 
cleavage o f pro-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] to biologically active TNF (Van Dyk et ah, 
1997; Moura-da-Silva et ah, 1996). SVMPs are therefore considered one of the major 
causative agents o f permanent tissue loss following snakebite (Gutirrez et ah, 1995; 
Gutirrez and Rucavado, 2000).
SVMPs, as reviewed in Chapter 1, are members o f the reprolysin Zinc-metalloproteinases, a 
family o f zinc-containing endopeptidases (Bjamason and Fox, 1995) ranging from 20 to 100 
kDa and form, together with the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) group, the 
subfamily o f metzincins. They share a common overall structural organisation (Gutierrez and 
Rucavado, 2000; Omari-Satoh et ah, 1995) but differ in substrate specificity, cellular sources
Chapter 6 : Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 148
and inducibility (Moura-da-Silva et al., 1996). SVMPs are categorised into four groups 
dependent upon molecular mass and the presence o f catalytic, disintegrin and cysteine-rich 
domains (Bjaranson and Fox, 1994) that exert distinct effects.
While SVMP DNA and peptide sequences have been reported for other Echis species, it was 
only during the course o f this project that our group published the first report o f the 
purification and functional characterization o f E. ocellatus SVMPs (Howes et al., 2003); the 
main objective o f this chapter was to screen the E. ocellatus venom gland cDNAs library to 
isolate cDNA encoding SVMP from this viper species, the intention was to utilize the E. 
ocellatus SVMP cDNA sequences to generate toxin-specific antibodies by DNA 
immunization. To achieve this objective I exploited the highly conserved nature o f the 
nucleotide and amino acid sequences o f viper SVMP propeptide and carboxyl domains (Paine 
et al., 1992a; 1994; Selistre de Araujo and Ownby, 1995) to PCR-amplify analogous 
sequences from a cDNA library constructed from the venom glands o f adult E. ocellatus. 
Since (i) the propeptide domain is cleaved from the nascent zymogen (Kini and Evans 1992) 
and (ii) my objective is generate antibodies to neutralize protein function, the PCR 
experiments were designed to amplify cDNA sequences encoding the mature peptide and not 
the full length open reading frame.

6.2. Experimental design
The experimental strategy was the same as that described in Chapter 3.
6.3. Design of PCR primers
Screening o f the cDNA libraries was performed using PCR (Israel, 1993). I exploited the 
extensive sequence similarity o f the group III viper SVMPs (Bjamason and Fox, 1994; Paine 
et al., 1994; Selistre de Araujo and Ownby, 1995) to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
primers complimentary to highly conserved regions within the N-terminal propeptide 
(VEDHCY) and C-terminal (CVDVNTAY) domains. E. ocellatus (origin: Kaltango, Nigeria) 
venom gland cDNA was subjected to PCR [using program #4, chapter 2] with the 5  
[GGATCC-ATG-GTT-GAG-GAT-CAC-TGC-TAT; incorporating a restriction 
endonuclease (BamUT) site and a methionine start (ATG) codon, in bold, respectively] and 3  
[CTCGAG-TCA-GTA-ATC-ATC-CAG-GTC-ATC-ACC-CCT; incorporating a restriction 
endonuclease (Xhol) site and a stop codons (TGA), in bold, respectively to facilitate future 
subcloning] primers which were synthesized commercially by Sigma-Genosys Ltd., U.K.

6.4. Results
6.4.1, Isolation o f  cDNA encoding E. ocellatus SVMP (EoMP)
A PCR product o f the expected size about 1.5 Kb, was obtained using the SVMP- specific 
primers (Fig.6.1). The PCR amplicon was excised from the gel, purified from other 
components and sub-cloned into the TA cloning vector, pCR 2.1-TOPO, (Invitrogen) and the 
ligation mixture used to transform chemically competent E. coli (TOPI OF), under ampicillin 
selection, following the manufacturers instructions [as described in Chapter 2]. The ligation 
and transformation o f the PCR product resulted in a good yield o f recombinant colonies. On 
average, the overall ratio between the blue and the white colonies was 1:1. Plasmid DNA was 
extracted using a commercially available kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and restriction 
enzymes [Bam HI and Xho I] digestion was performed as a first step procedure to screen 
transformed white colonies prior to DNA sequencing. However, only eight o f the sixteen 
colonies screened were confirmed to be positive and sent for DNA sequencing.
6.4.2. DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy-nucleotide chain-termination method 
[Sanger et.al., 1977] in a Beckman Coulter CEQTM 2000 XL DNA Analysis System.
DNA sequencing resulted in four sequences that had an open reading frame o f 1543 base 
pairs (Fig.6.2a) predicting proteins o f 514 amino acid residues (Fig.6.2b). The molecular 
weight o f each protein was calculated from their amino acid sequences and found to be o f 57 
kDa. The DNA sequences o f all EoMP (termed EoMP-1, EoMP-2, EoMP-5, EoMP-6) clones

6.4.3. Blast Search
The deduced amino acid sequence o f EoMP-6 [GenBank accession number: AY261531] was 
subjected to BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) searches o f the genetic databases. These searches 
revealed the deduced amino acid sequence o f EoMP-6 to be 91% and 59% similar to the 
prothrombin-activating SVMPs o f E. pyramidum leakeyi [Ecarin, A55796 (Nishida et al.,
1995)] and Bothrops erythromelas [Berythractivase, AAL47169 (Silva et al., 2003)] 
respectively. EoMP-6 also showed high levels o f sequence similarity to haemorrhagic SVMPs 
from Bothrops jararaca [jararhagin, 59%, P30431 (Paine et al., 1992)], Agkistrodon 
contortrix laticinctus [Aclh, 58%, AAL47169 (Selistre de Araujo and Ownby, 1995)], 
Crotalus atrox [Catrocollastatin, 59%, S55270 (Zhou et al., 1995)], Protobothrops 
flavoviridis [Hrla, 58%, BAB92013 (Kishimoto and Takahashi, 2002)] and E. pyramidum 
leakeyi [Ech-I, 54%, S48160 and Ech-II, 56%, S48169, (Paine et al., 1994)]. The inferred 
amino acid sequence o f EoMP-6 was aligned to the above sequences using the CLUSTAL W 
program (Thompson et al., 1994) with PAM 250 residue weight matrix (Fig.6.3) and the 
perecent sequence similarity described in Table 5.1.

6.4.4. Sequence alignment o f  the EoMP-6 with Group IIISVM P from related viper 
species
As illustrated in (Fig.6.3), EoMP-6 has the same modular organization as the class III SVMPs 
(Kini and Evans 1992, Silva et al., 2003) with the expression o f pro-peptide, 
metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains.
The EoMP-6 contains a typically highly conserved pro-peptide domain with a cysteine switch 
motif (PKMOGVT) located at position 66-72 in the carboxyl-terminal portions o f the pro
peptide domain (Fig.6.3).
The EoMP-6 zinc chelating motif (236-248) was identical to that o f the E.p.leakeyi 
prothrombin-activator, Ecarin. Both sequences expressed substitution o f S for N241 and L for 
H245. The functional significant o f these substitution is not known.
In common with the other viper SVMPs shown here (Fig.6.3), the EoMP-6 sequence also 
encoded a DCD motif located at 368-371 instead o f the RGD sequence typical o f  the integrin- 
binding domain o f the true snake venom disintegrins. Some o f the viper SVMP encoded a 
ECD in this motif, the functional implication o f these E or D substitutions is not known.
As shown in Fig.6.3, a significant number o f conservative cysteine residues were observed. 
Eo-MP-6 encoded the 36 cysteine residues that form 18 disulphide bridges.

6.4.5. Antigenic profile  o f  E 0MPO6 with analogues M P  m olecule in rela ted  viper species 
The overall research objective is to develop a rational immunotherapy for snake bite by 
generating toxin-specific antibodies with potential to react and neutralize the activity o f  
analogous molecules in the venom o f other Echis species, using DNA immunization 
technology (Harrison et al., 2000; 2002),.
The antigenic index as illustrated in Fig.6.4, (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) was constructed to 
guide the design o f the DNA immunization constructs and to evaluate the potential inter
specific and inter-generic immunoreactivity o f  each toxin-specific antibody (thereby 
estimating the geographic limits o f  their potential clinical usefulness).
The peaks in the E0M P-6 profile (Fig.6.4) indicate the numerous domains predicted to have a 
surface location and potential for antibody induction. The thin vertical lines (A- M) illustrate 
that many o f  the antigenic residues o f  E0MP-6 are shared by SVMPs o f  related vipers and 
that antibodies raised by E0M P-6 DNA immunisation are likely to possess considerable cross
reactivity. As expected, the antigenic profile o f E0MP-6 was very similar to that o f Ecarin 
and, to a lesser extent, to Ech-I and Ech-II from E. p . leakeyi venom. The latter viper is a 
phylogenetically close relative o f E. ocellatus (Lenk et al., 2001) with an East African 
distribution. Line D corresponded to the catalytic site (position 234 -246 , Fig.6.4) and 
appeared to be highly immunogenic in all the SVMPs. Line H corresponded to the DCD 
motif in the disintegrin-like domain (position 368-370, Fig.6.3).

6.4.6. N orthern  blot analysis
Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the size and number of EoMP transcripts 
using total RNA extracted from the E. ocellatus venom gland. The EoMP-6 DNA was chosen 
as a representative clone to probe the venom gland total RNA on northern blots. The result as 
shown in (Fig.6.5) revealed a broad band from 0.6 kb to 3.5 kb.

6.5. Discussion
The utilisation o f PCR amplification o f E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA with SVMP-specific 
primers was successful in amplifying four E. ocellatus cDNA sequences encoding SVMP 
molecules o f about 1.5 Kb that showed over 98% nucleotide sequence similarity (Fig.6.2a).
All the isolated EoMP sequences described here have the same modular organization as the 
class P-III SVMPs from related vipers with a typically highly conserved pro-peptide domain 
with a cysteine switch motif (PKMCGVT) located at position 66-72 in the carboxyl-terminal 
portions o f the pro-peptide domain (Fig.6.3). The cysteine switch motif in this domain is 
thought to prevent proteolytic activity o f the zymogen (Silva et ah, 2003; Siigur et al., 1996). 
In the latent form o f the zymogen, a free thiol group in this sequence is thought to coordinate 
the catalytic zinc ion at the active site to prevent proteolytic cleavage o f the zymogen (Silva et 
al., 2003; Siigur et al., 1996).
The propeptide domain o f  EoMP-6 is shorter (94 residues) than that o f the other SVMPs (data 
not shown) as a result o f the design o f the PCR primers. Consequently, the amino acid 
sequence number [e.g., o f functionality important domains] discussed in this chapter are 
different from those used in the literature on full-length SVMPs.
The zinc-chelating consensus sequence X-His-Glu-X-X-His-X-X-Qu-X-X-Ifis in the 
metalloprotease domain (Bode et al., 1992; Gomis-Ruth et al., 1993) o f SVMPs and the 
Astacins (Nishida et al., 1995) is the active site responsible for the haemorrhagic activity of 
these proteases (Bjamason and Fox, 1994) toward different target substrates (Kini and Evans, 
1992; Moura-da-Silva et al., 1996; Sugita, 1999). The zinc chelating motif (236-248) o f 
EoMP-6 was very similar to that of the other SVMPs (Fig.6.3) and identical to that o f the E.
Chapter 6 : Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 162
p. leakeyi prothrombin activator, Ecarin. Both sequences showed a typical substitution o f S 
for N241 and L for H245.
EoMP-6 encoded the consereved (C-I/V-M) sequences at position 258-260 as illustrated in 
Fig.6.3. This motif is thought to promote hydrophobic interactions within the protein structure 
thereby ensuring the structural integrity o f the zinc-binding site (Selistre de Araujo and 
Ownby, 1995).
In common with the other viper prothrombin activator, Ecarin and Berythractivase, and in 
contrast to most o f the haemorrhagic SVMPs, the EoMP-6 sequence included three N-linked 
glycosylation sites N-X-S/T at position N 160, N 194 and N225, respectively (Fig.6.3). To my 
knowledge this is the first time that this observation has been made and suggests that while 
the functional significance o f the N-glycosylation sites (NXS/T) remains unclear, it suggests a 
sequence motif to distinguish between prothrombin activator as SVMPs from the other, 
highly sequence-analogous SVMPs o f distinct function.
The EoMP-6 sequence also encoded the carboxy-terminal disintegrin-like domain. In 
common with other SVMPs (Fig.6.3), EoMP-6 encoded a DCD motif at 368-371 instead of 
the RGD sequence typical o f the integrin-binding domain o f the true snake venom 
disintegrins. Furthermore, EoMP-6 shows a cysteine-rich carboxyl extension o f the 
disintegrin domain. Such an inter-link extension may reflect that both domains function as a 
single contiguous unit with an adhesive role. This domain is characterised by the presence of 
a high percentage o f cysteine residues displayed in a distinctive pattern (Jia et al., 1996). This 
group (Jia et al., 2000) expressed the cysteine-rich domain o f Atrolysin A (a haemorrhagic 
SVMP from the venom of C. atrox) and demonstrated its ability to inhibit collagen-induced
Chapter 6 : Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 163
platelet aggregation. It also inhibited the adhesion o f MG-63 cells to collagen type I. These 
findings suggest a synergistic effect o f platelet targeting and haemorrhagic effect by SVMPs 
(Jia et al., 2000). As shown in Fig.6.3, a significant number o f conservative cysteine residues 
were observed. Eo-MP-6 encoded the 36 cysteine residues that form 18 disulphide bonds 
which may be responsible for their protein structural and biological characterisation as well as 
the cleavage o f the putative domains (Calvete et al., 1992; Kini and Evans 1981).
Despite the conserved regions within the pro-peptide and the functional domains, there are 
two interesting points to outline. The first is the high variability found in the amino acid 
regions that encode the mature protein o f EoMP-6. The same pattern o f variability also seems 
to be operating in related venom molecules from other snake species as illustrated in Table
6.1. Such a high variability within this corresponding domain may reflect one o f the features 
of selection during the evolution of these snakes. Thus, the amino acid variability within the 
catalytic domain may provide the snake with a device o f new enzymatic activities with which 
the spectrum o f the venoms action will be increased by its variable interaction with different 
but related substrates. The second point is that despite this sequence variability, all viper 
SVMPs retain the consereved cystein scaffold that ensures the protein retain a similar tertiary 
structure.
In the disintegrin domain, it is unclear whether the D for E substitution in EoMP-6 has 
functional significance. The disintegrin-binding RGD motif is frequently substituted with 
E/DCD in many snake venom metalloproteinases such as jararhagin (Paine et al., 1992), 
ecarin (Nishida et al., 1995), HRla (Kishimoto, and Takahashi, 2002), Ca: Cat (Zhou et al., 
1995), ECH-I and ECH-II (Paine et al., 1995) as illustrated in (Fig.6.3). However, it may play
Chapter 6 : Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 164
a role in the adhesion o f venom metalloproteases to target molecules, possibly to integrins 
that are located on the cell surface membrane o f the vascular endothelium (Paine et al., 1994). 
Evidence for this was strengthened by the discovery o f non-RGD motif in the disintegrin 
domain o f mammalian sperm proteins including PH30-a and PH30-(3, which bind to the 
integrins located on the egg surface during fertilization (Kratzschmar et al., 1996, Biobel et 
al., 1992). Furthermore, on doser observation within the disintegrin domain a high degree o f  
amino acid sequence similarity was observed, as illustrated in (Table 6.1), in comparison with 
the high sequence variability found within the catalytic domain. However, the functional 
significance o f this sequence similarity is not clear, as the removal o f segments from the 
amino terminal portion o f this domain does not significantly affect integrin inhibitory activity 
(Kini and Evans, 1992). cDNA sequences indicate that some venom metalloproteinases such 
as that o f classes P-II and P-III are synthesised containing metalloproteinase and disintegrin- 
like domains and they are post-translationally processed to remove the latter domain (as in the 
case o f Atrolysin E from Western diamondback rattlesnake [C. atrox] venom and the 
haemorrhagic factor HR2a from Habu Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom (Fox and Bjamason, 
1998). Such processing may be autocatalytic or may be performed by other proteinases 
(Gutirrez et al., 2000).
It can be seen clearly that obtaining sequence similarities o f each structural domain [as 
illustrated in Table 6.1] promotes the prediction o f structure/function relationships between 
the EoMP-6 and its analogous molecules. It also provided a satisfactory differentiation 
between two related proteins based on functionally important domains. This is explained 
further in the following paragraph.
There are several types o f prothrombin activators in snake venom, which have been divided
Chapter 6 : Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 165
into four groups based on their structural properties and their mechanism o f prothrombin 
activation (Kini, 2001). Although the amino acid sequence similarity and the structural 
organization between EoMP-6 and its analogous proteins were significant, without functional 
assays it is difficult to predict the functional characteristic o f EoMP-6. For instance, the 
berythractivase showed a 70% sequence similarity to jararhagin, however, their biological 
actions were considerably different. Silva et al., (2003), demonstrated that although 
berythractivase was capable o f modulating the endothelial cell, it has a very low fibrinolytic- 
activity in degrading the a-chain o f fibrinogen, and it does not contribute to the synthesis of 
vWF (vonWillebamd factor).
To guide the design o f the DNA immunization constructs and to evaluate the potential inter
specific and inter-generic immunoreactivity o f each toxin-specific antibody (thereby 
estimating the geographic limits o f their potential clinical usefulness), I have used a protein 
structure-predicting algorithm (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) to (i) identify domains o f strong 
antigenic potential in the toxin gene product and (ii) determine whether these domains are 
conserved in analogous venom toxin gene products o f related vipers. Amino acid sequences 
differ only slightly does not however have a negative impact on the achievement o f the main 
objective-the development o f toxin-neutralizing antibodies by DNA immunisation. The 
deduced primary structures o f EoMPs include the requisite, highly conserved, 36 cysteine 
residues that form the 18 disulphide bonds responsible for the characteristic tertiary structure 
o f class III SVMP. It is therefore predicted that transfection o f mammalian cells with 
encoding-EoMP DNA is likely to present to the immune system molecules that faithfully 
represent native SVMP and strongly suggests that an antibody raised to any o f these domains 
may have the potential for neutralizing SVMPs from other viper species, which are
Chapter 6: Cloning and characterization o f  a novel cDNA encoding an Echis ocellatus prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase 166
responsible for the acute medical problems in many areas o f rural Africa.
It is tempting to predict that antibodies generated against clinically significant domains in 
EoMP-6 might competitively inhibit the function o f these domains in venom toxins o f related 
vipers. However, binding o f antibodies specific to conserved antigenic domains without a 
known function (Fig.6.4; Lines A-M, except D and H) are equally as likely to disrupt protein 
function by virtue o f steric hindrance. The veracity o f these speculations need to be confirmed 
experimentally; a focus o f my future activity. Furthermore, the truncated peptide sequence 
(KTLDSFGEWR) derived from a purified haemorrhagic fraction o f E. ocellatus venom 
(Howes et al., 2003) differed from that EoMP-6 (TLHSFGEWR, Fig.6.3). Together, these 
studies suggest a multimeric composition o f E. ocellatus SVMPs and indicate the need for a 
more global analysis o f the E. ocellatus venom gland transcriptome.
The northern blot analysis (Fig. 6.5) revealed a broad transcript band from 0.6 kb to 3.5 kb. 
This strongly suggests the existence o f numerous EoMP transcripts varying in size from 0.6 to 
3.5 Kb. Therefore the EoMP-6 could be transcribed from such numerous transcript containing 
flanking regions, which may be cleaved by a post-translational processing. Moreover, this 
also agrees with the literature o f group I-IV SVMPs and my own PCR result (Fig.6.1).

7.1. Introduction
Echis envenoming causes massive haemorrhagic and necrotic morbidity in the short term 
and often in the long term, also permanent disfigurement and renal dysfunction. The only 
effective treatment is the administration o f antivenom. Antivenom production for sub- 
Saharan Africa has declined to dangerous low levels, thus exacerbating the already severe 
medical problem that envenoming poses to rural, financially-disadvantaged communities 
of the tropics that have limited access to frequently inadequate health resources (Lalloo 
and Theakston, 2003).
Although life-saving, conventional antivenoms suffer from deficiencies imposed by the 
mode o f preparation. Currently, antivenoms are prepared by purifying the sera o f large 
animals, usually horses, immunised with either an individual venom or a range o f venoms. 
Since venoms contain numerous molecules, only some o f which are toxic, antivenoms 
raised against these consist o f numerous antibodies with no therapeutic function. 
Furthermore, because the toxicity o f a venom molecule is unrelated to its immunogenic 
potential, the most potent antibodies in antivenoms are not necessarily targeted to the most 
pathogenic molecules. The objective o f the work described in this chapter is to generate a 
bank o f murine polyclonal antibodies specific to the most haemostasis-disruptive 
molecules in the venom of E. ocellatus using the new cDNA sequences [as described in 
earlier chapters] as immunizing material.
Harrison et al., (2000b) demonstrated for the first time that DNA immunisation with JD9, 
the carboxyl-disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain o f single venom metalloprotease 
(jararhagin) gene, can be utilized to generate high titre murine IgG responses capable o f
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 169
inhibiting venom-induced haemorrhagic activity caused by the Brazilian pit viper, B. 
jararaca. Harrison et al., (2003) have since shown that antibody from the JD9 DNA- 
immunised mice reacted immunologically with molecules o f the same molecular weight in
(i) the homologous venom and (ii) the venoms o f snakes o f  diverse species and genera. 
The propose o f this research chapter was to use the above strategy to generate antibodies 
to neutralize envenoming by E. ocellatus.
The cDNAs encoding E. ocellatus toxins used for DNA immunisation
The major part o f the work described in this thesis was spent isolating and characterizing 
novel cDNAs encoding E. ocellatus PLA2, CTL, SVMP and serine protease molecules. 
The rest o f the time, was spent manipulating cDNAs encoding the latter three constructs to 
immunize mice. While mice immunised with SVMP DNA raised satisfactory antibodies, 
unfortunately the mice immunised with the CTL and serine protease DNA constructs 
failed to seroconvert. Consequently, this chapter describes the methodology and results of 
SVMP DNA immunisation. The techniques used for the latter were identical for those 
used in preparing the CTL and serine protease DNA immunisation constructs.
I utilized DNA encoding the carboxyl-disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain (EoDC-2) o f  
E0MP-6, a prothombin activator-like metalloproteinase in the venom o f E. ocellatus for 
DNA immunisation.
EoDC-2 o f the E0MP-6 possesses, like the JD9 DNA immunisation construct, a DCD 
collagen receptor binding motif in the disintegrin domain and the highly conserved 
cysteine scaffold present in the cysteine-rich domain. The rationale o f using the DC

domains as opposed to the whole molecule was that expression o f EoDC-2 in mammalian 
cells was considered to be less injurious to the host than expression o f the whole molecule 
containing the catalytic metalloprotease domain. Secondly it was thought that, antibody 
bound to the DC domain as in the case o f JD9 (Harrison et al., 2000), may prevent 
substrate binding (Kamiguti et al., 2004) and/or catalytic function (Jeon et al., 1999) o f the 
whole molecules, thus achieving the objective.
7.2. Experimental strategy
The experimental design strategies o f this research chapter was as follows:
(i) To prepare the EoDC-2 DNA immunisation construct (Fig. 7.1).
(ii) To determine the using ELISA seroconversion efficiency o f EoDC-2 delivered 
intradermally (ID) into mice or by Gene Gun (GG) delivery or intramuscularly 
(IM).
(iii) To assess the cross reactivity o f antibody raised by EoDC-2 immunisation to 
analogous molecules in venoms o f other Echis species by immunoblotting.
(iv) To analyse the venom neutralizing efficacy o f antibody raised by EoDc-2
immunisation.

7.3. Materials and methods
7.3.1. Isolation  an d  analysis o f  disintegrin an d  cysteine-rich  (DC) dom ains f r o m  E oM P- 
6 clone.
The DC domain o f  EoMP-6 encoding a novel E. ocellatus prothrombin activator (Hasson 
et al., 2003) was PCR amplified using primers complementary to nucleotides 890 -  912 
(5 primer) and nucleotides 1523 - 1545 (3primer) [Chapter 6] as demonstrated in 
(Fig.7.2). The amplicon was sub-cloned into the TA cloning vector (pCR2.1-TOPO; 
Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and used to transform chemically competent 
E.coli cells (TOPIOF, Invitrogen) under ampicillin selection. Plasmid DNA was extracted 
(Mini-spin prep kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and digested with BarriHl and Xho\ at 
37C to select plasmids containing inserts o f  the predicted size for DNA sequencing.
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy-nucleotide chain-termination method in a 
Beckman Coulter CEQ2000 XL DNA Analysis System. Only one clone showing an 
open reading frame (ORF) identical to the DC domain o f  EoMP-6 was selected. The 
EoDC2/TOPO clone was digested with BamW. and Xhoi and the EoDC-2 insert was 
electrophoretically isolated from TOPO [as described in Chapter 2] and ligated into the 
mammalian expression vector pSecTag-B [Invitrogen, Netherlands] as described in the 
following section.

7.3.2. P lasm id construction an d  clone isolation
7.3.2.1. Description o f  the pSecTag-B  DNA immunisation p lasm id
The mammalian expression vector pSecTag-B (Invitrogen, Netherlands) used in this 
study has all the required components for successful protein expression from DNA [see 
Chapter 1]. The map for pSecTag-B is demonstrated in Fig.7.3. The expressed protein is 
under the control o f the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early 
promoter/enhancer that provides efficient, high-level expression o f recombinant protein 
(Boshart et al., 1985); this has been utilised in numerous DNA vaccination studies 
(Donnelly et al., 1997). The up-stream murine immunoglobulin k-chain leader sequence 
favours secretion o f the fusion protein from the transfected cell (Invitogen, Netherlands). 
The down-stream bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal promotes efficient 
transcription termination and polyadenylation o f fusion protein mRNA, thereby 
increasing the stability o f the mRNA and reducing the chance o f premature mRNA 
degradation (Invitrogen, Netherlands).
7.3.2.2. Ligation reaction o f  EoDC-2 into pSecTag-B
The amplified (EoDC-2) product from section 7.3.1 was ligated as illustrated in Table 7.1. 
The required quantity o f the purified PCR product required for the ligation reaction was 
determined by the following equation which illustrates the conversion o f  molar ratio to 
mass ratios for both pSecTag-B=5.2kb plasmid and D-C= 700kb insert DNA fragment.

The reaction tube was incubated at 4C overnight. Different volumes o f the reaction 
mixture were then used to transform One TOPO Shot chemically competent E. coli cells. 
Transformation and plating o f  the bacterial cells was performed as previously described 
[chapter 2], except that no X-gal or IPTG were used because pSecTag-B does not support 
blue/white selection. Therefore, clones were selected randomly. Several clones were 
amplified in LB culture medium over night and the purified plasmid digested with 
BamWl and Xhol. Clones that showed appropriate insert sizes were submitted for DNA 
sequencing which was performed as previously described in section 7.3.2.1 using the T7 
and Bgh primers incorporated into pSecTag-B (Fig.7.3).
Plasmid DNAs for immunisations were purified from large-scale E. coli cultures using 
Qiagen Megaprep kits, according to manufacturers instructions [previously described in 
Chapter 2]. The purified DNA was stored at -20C until ready for use.

7.3.3. In vitro EoDC-2 protein expression
Before proceeding to DNA immunisation, the ability o f the pSecTag-B/EoDC-2 construct 
to express the EoDC-2 DNA fragment was confirmed in vitro. Two different assays were 
used as described below.
7.3.3.1. In vitro translation of mammalian COS-7 with pSecTag-B/EoDC-2
In vitro transfection is the process o f bringing foreign DNA into cells to permit analysis 
of protein expression. The main reagent used in this transfection /expression procedure is 
FUGENE 6 (Roche). FUGENE 6 is a multi-component lipid that complexes with and 
transports DNA into mammalian cells.
The transfection procedure was performed according to FUGENE 6 protocol (Roche).
7.3.3.1.1. Materials fo r COS-7 culture.
A. Immortalised cell line culture.
COS-7 cells are immortalised fibroblast endothelial cells isolated from monkeys they 
were kindly donated by Dr A. Craig, Liverpool School o f Tropical Medicine. The stock 
of COS-7 cells is kept at -80C.
B. Preparation o f  cell culture Medium
+ 500ml DMEM [Dulbeccos modified minimal essential medium]
+ 50ml FCS [foetal calf serum]
+ 5ml P/S [penicillin/streptomycin]
+ 5ml Glutamine
Chapter 7: im m unisation  with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E1 ocellatus venom toxins 179
All components were prewarmed at 37C and mixed before use. The remaining medium 
was stored at 4C.
C. Setting up a C O S-7 culture
A bottle o f  culture medium (DMEM + reagents see B above) was pre-warmed to 37C. 
One aliquot o f  COS-7 cells was thawed and added to a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 
10ml culture medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000rpm for 5 minutes. 
The supernatant was discarded and the cells re-suspended in 12 ml culture medium. The 
cells were then transferred into sterile 25ml flasks (4ml per flask). Cells were checked for 
their viability using light microscopy and incubated at 37C (CO2) overnight. The 
following day, the culture medium was changed and incubated for another 24 hours at 
37C (C 02).
D. Passaging C O S-7 culture
Once the culture achieved confluency, the cells were split into new culture flasks. The 
culture medium was discarded, and the cells washed with 5 ml sterile PBS. Two 
millilitres Trypsin (prewarmed) was added and swirled horizontally and gently. To ensure 
that the monolayer was evenly coated with trypsin, cells were incubated at 37C for 2 to 5 
minutes and the dissociation o f the monolayer checked by microscopically. Cells were 
then transferred into a sterile 15ml Falcon tube, followed by addition o f 5ml fresh culture 
DMEM to dilute the trypsin. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 
minutes the supernatant discarded and cells were then resuspended in 10ml fresh, 
prewarmed culture medium. Resuspended cells were distributed in 3ml aliquots into
Chapter 7: immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 180
sterile culture flasks. An additional 7ml fresh (prewarmed) DMEM was added to each 
flask. Cells were then incubated in the CO2 incubator overnight at 37C. After cells o f  the 
third passage achieved 80% confluency, they were ready for transfection.
E. Transfection o f  COS-7
The first step is to spread cells at a low density (40% per well) into each well o f  a 35mm 
six-well plate (Nunc). Cells were then incubated overnight in the CO2 incubator 
overnight at 37C. Culture medium was aspirated from each well and replaced by serum- 
free DMEM. The following reaction mixture was assembled for each well: lOOpl serum- 
free medium (RT) was pipetted into a 15ml Falcon tube, 4pl FUGEN6 was added to the 
centre o f the serum-free media, [avoiding contact the sides o f tube], gently mixed and 
incubated at RT for 5 minutes, lpg DNA was added as droplets the tube, with gentle but 
continuous mixing. The reaction was incubated at RT for 30 minutes. Twenty microlitres 
o f the reaction mixture was spread as droplets into two wells. Wells were gently swirled 
and incubated in the CO2 incubator overnight at 37C.
F. H arvesting o f  recom binant protein
The supernatant o f each well was harvested 72 hours after transfection and transferred 
into a sterile 5ml tube and stored immediately at -20C. Two millilitres o f 0.5mM EDTA 
was added to each well followed by incubation at RT for 10 minutes. This is to loss cells 
into suspension phase. Two millilitres 10% TCA (Appendix A) was added, followed by 
further incubation on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 15,500 
g at 4C, the supernatant discarded and 10 ml pre-chilled acetone added to wash the cells
Chapter 7s immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption K  ocellatus yenam toxins 181
which were then centrifuged as above. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet 
was air dried, resuspended in 2x Protein loading buffer (appendix A) and stored at -20C
7.3.3.2. Analysis o f EoDC-2 recombinant protein
Analysis o f protein expression o f EoDC-2 DNA fragment was performed using SDS- 
PAGE and Western blot assays. Both assays were performed as described in Chapter 2.
7.3.4. Gene Gun immunisation
7.3.4.I. Preparation ofD N A -coated  go ld  beads f o r  GeneGun im munisation  
Coating o f 1.6pm gold beads (Bio-Rad) with EoDC-2/pSecTag-B DNA construct and the 
control pSecTag-B plasmid was performed according to the manufacturers instruction. 
(BioRad, Hercules, CA). The quantity o f gold powder and DNA was adjusted to provide 
immunisation shots o f lp g  DNA/0.5 mg gold.
All the preparation steps were performed at RT. The gold beads were resuspended in a 
carrier protein solution o f 0.05M spermidine and sonicated for 6 seconds to separate the 
beads. The DNA was added and the suspension mixed vigorously. The DNA was 
precipitated onto the gold beads by addition o f  1 .OM CaCh for 2 minutes followed by 
vigorous mixing and the beads left settle for 15 minutes at RT. The sample was 
centrifuged for 1 minute and supernatant was removed without disturbing the pellet o f  
gold beads. Three 1 minute spin washes with 700 pi o f  100% ethanol were performed to 
remove the excess spermidine, CaCh and H2O. The final 1ml o f  gold beads [in 100%
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 182
ethanol] was added to the required amount o f 100% ethanol to provide a suspension o f  
0.5mg gold per cm Tefzel tubing according to manufacturers instructions.
7.3.4.2. Preparation o f  cartridges ( shots')
Tefzel tubing was cut to required length. A 10ml sterile syringe was joined to one end. 
The DNA-coated gold bead ethanol suspension was vortexed and sonicated for 6 seconds 
and mixed again vigorously by hand for 20 seconds. Beads were then aspirated into 
tubing using the syringe leaving an air gap at both ends [making sure no air bubbles were 
trapped in the tubing]. This step was performed in a single smooth motion. The tubing 
was inserted into the tube roller (Fig.7.4a) and the beads allowed to settle for 3 minutes. 
Very slowly (lsec/cm) the ethanol was aspirated from the tubing by the syringe and the 
latter removed. The tube was rotated to evenly distribute the beads in the inner surface o f 
the tubing for about 20-30 seconds. The remaining ethanol was evaporated by a stream o f  
nitrogen gas for 3 minutes. The tubing was rotated throughout the latter step. The coated 
tubing was examined to verify even distribution o f the gold beads and then cut into 1cm 
sections using the Bio-RAD Tubing Cutter. The shots were stored in a glass container 
containing desiccant capsules, wrapped with parafilm and stored at 4C until used.

7.3.4.3. Confirmation ofDNA coated o f  the gold bead shots
To verify DNA loading of the gold beads, single 1cm shots were selected at random 
from each preparation and placed in 1.5 Ependorf tube containing 100% ethanol and 
vortexed vigorously for 2 minutes and then incubated overnight at RT. Shots were 
vortexed vigorously and centrifuged for two minutes at 13000 rpm to pellet the gold 
beads. The tubing and ethanol were removed and the sample centrifuged again for 1 
minute to remove residual ethanol. The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then 
resuspended in lOpl ddl-bO and incubated at 55C for five minutes to resuspended the 
DNA. Two microlitre o f 6 SLOB (Appendix A) was added and samples loaded on to a 
0.7% agarose gel.
7.3.5. BALB/c mice
8-10 week-old male BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Olac (U.K) or Charles 
River Laboratories (U.K) or were produced from breeding colonies in the Biomedical 
Services Unit, University o f Liverpool. All mice were housed in designated areas o f the 
Biomedical Services Unit o f the University o f  Liverpool.
7.3.6. DNA immunisation o f  mice by Gene Gun
The Helios GeneGun (Fig.7.4b) was attached by metal tubing to a pressurised helium 
cylinder and the pressure set at 350 pounds per square inch (psi) according to Harrison et 
al. (1999). Previous studies had shown that this level o f pressure delivered the gold beads 
into the epidermal layer [required for delivery o f antigen to antigen-presenting cell (APC)] 
and that DNA-transfected cells were shown to be transcriptionally active by RT-PCR for
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 185
three days (Harrison et al., 1999). The 1cm shots were loaded into the cartridge 
supplied the manufacture (Fig7.4b) and inserted into the GG. The abdomens o f the mice 
were shaved using electric hair clippers and they were lightly anaesthetised using a 
mixture o f halothane and oxygen (5%). The barrel o f the GG was then placed on the 
shaved abdomen and discharged three times, delivering a total o f 3pg o f the pSecTag-B/ 
EoDC-2 DNA construct or the vector alone per mouse. Immunisations were given on 
three occasions, two weeks apart and the sera examined 8 weeks later as described by 
Harrison et al. (1999; 2000). Two further immunisations were performed at 4 week 
intervals.
7.3.7. Intradermal and intramuscular injections o f  DNA
pSecTag-B/EoDC-2 DNA construct and the control pSecTag-B were adjusted to lOOpg 
DNA/50 pi distilled water and 25pl was injected intrademally into two sites on the back 
of anaesthetised mice [ID] or into the rectus femoris muscle o f each hind leg [IM] o f  
mice with a 25G needle. Immunisations were given three times with two week intervals 
between immunisations with a further two immunisations given at four week intervals.
7.3.8. Collecting o f  sera from immunised mice
Blood was collected from each mouse after each immunisation by tail snip or, at the end 
of the experiment, by cardiac exsanguinations under terminal anaesthesia (Harlow and 
Lane, 1988). The blood was incubated overnight at 4C to allow formation and 
contraction o f the blood clot which was then removed. Serum samples were then
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 186
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Sera was transferred into sterile 1.5ml 
Eppendorf tube and stored at -20C.
7.3.9. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant Assay (ELISA)
ELISA was used to determine the titre o f antibodies to E. ocellatus whole venom from 
the immunised mice. Methods were based on those o f Theakston et al. (1977) and 
Harrison et al. (2000). The ELISA plates (Maxisorp, NUNC, Denmark) were coated with 
lmg/ml whole E. ocellatus venom in coating buffer (0.015M Na2CC>3, 0.035M NaHCC>3, 
3mM NaN3, pH 9.6) and left overnight at 4C. The plates were then washed three times 
with washing buffer (0.077M NaCl, ImM Tween 20 in distilled water). One hundred 
microlitre o f appropriately diluted test and control sera were added to the wells and 
incubated for 2 hours at 37C in an incubator (Sanyo Gallenkamp, Leicestershire, UK). 
The wells were then washed as above and lOOpl o f a 1:1000 dilution o f goat anti-mouse 
or goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (SIGMA, Poole, UK) was added. The 
plates were then incubated for two hours at RT before rewashing. Chromogenic substrate, 
2,2-azino-bis (2-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid tablets, Sigma, Poole, UK), was 
then added and the plates developed at RT for 30 minutes. The absorbances o f the wells 
were read at 405 nm using a model 450 microplate reader (BioRad, Hemel Hempstead, 
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 187
7.4. Results
7.4.1. PCR amplification o f DC domain o f the prothrombin activator EoMP-6
The isolated DNA EoMP-6, (Hasson et al., 2003) was used as the template for PCR 
amplification using the EoDC-specific forward and reverse primers (Fig.7.2). A PCR 
product o f approximately 700bp was obtained (Fig.7.5a) and cloned into the TOPO-TA 
vector (Invitrogen, Netherlands). The TOPO-EoDC plasmids were purified from bacterial 
cell and subjected to BamHI and Xhol digestion. The clones containing inserts (EoDC) 
o f the correct size (Fig.7.5b) were submitted for DNA sequencing. The clone that shows 
the right insert with a good ORF was selected for ligation reaction into the pSecTag-B 
expression vector. Clones o f pSecTag-B were examined first by endonuclease restriction 
digest (Fig.7.5c). The four clones (Fig.7.5c) were submitted for DNA sequencing for 
ORF confirmation. Clone EoDC-2 was selected for DNA immunisation as it gave a better 
ORF as shown by sequence alignment (Fig.7.6a and b).

7.4.2. Confirmation o f the transcriptional and translational validity o f  EoDC- 
2/pSecTag-B construct plasmid.
Transient transfections o f COS-7 [a mammalian fibroblast cell line donated by Dr. A. 
Craig] were carried out to demonstrate both the transcription and translational validity o f  
the EoDc-2/pSecTag-B immunisation construct.
In conventional assays o f  this sort, the transfected COS-7 cells are maintained in FCS. 
However, for the period of transfection, serum-free medium was used instead o f FCS. 
The proteins in the supernatant and the pelleted cells were precipitated by 10% TCA and 
examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.7.7a). To facilitate detection o f the EoDC-2 protein, 
duplicate SDS-PAGE gels were transfected to nitrocellulose membrane that were probed 
with rabbit anti-E. ocellatus venom (Fig.7.7b) and NMS (Fig.7.7c). The latter 
immunoblot was performed to discount background activity. The faint bands illustrated 
by the arrows in the SDS-PAGE (Fig.7.7a) and rabbit antivenom immunoblot (Fig.7.7b) 
confirmed that EoDC-2/pSecTag-B construct was capable o f EoDC-2 expression.

7.4.4. R esponses o f  B A L B /c m ice im m unised with E oD C -2/pSecT ag-B  D N A  
Mice received five immunisations of 3ug pSecTag-/EODC-2 DNA by GG and lOOpg by 
either ID or IM routes, respectively. The first three immunisations were performed at two 
week intervals, with serum samples taken tvyo weeks post immunisation. The fourth and 
fifth immunisations were performed at four week intervals. Sera collected at various 
intervals throughout the experiment from the DNA-immunised and non-immunised 
control animals were examined by ELISA to determine the titre of antibodies to E.
ocellatus venom.
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. oceilatus venom toxins 196
In the first instance the sera from each group was serially diluted with PBS and the titre 
determined (Fig.7.9).
Serial dilutions o f sera taken from mice 12 weeks after the final DNA immunisation were 
tested by ELISA to determine levels o f EoDC-2 specific IgG (Fig.7.9). The OD values 
displayed were calculated by subtracting the OD value (blank) from the OD value o f each 
well. Each line represents the mean OD o f each group. This figure demonstrates that GG 
is the most efficient DNA delivery method for generating antibody to EoDC-2. The ID 
method was less efficient than GG and IM route was inefficient.
The next assay was a time course ELISA to determine the relative contribution o f each o f  
the five immunisations (Fig.7.10). Time course assay was performed at 1:20 dilution as it 
showed highest antibody titre in Fig.7.9. Sera were taken from mice two weeks after each 
immunisation. The OD values displayed were calculated by subtracting the OD value 
(blank) from the OD value o f  each well. Each line represents the response o f each group 
of five mice for GG and four mice for IM and ID, respectively. Figure 7.10 (i) confirms 
that GG was the most efficient DNA-delivery route and (ii) also showed that satisfactory 
antivenom titres were only achieved after the final immunisation.

7.4.5. Cross-reactivity o f  the EoDC-2 antibody with venoms from Echis snakes o f  
different geographical areas.
Immunoblotting with antibody from the EoDC-2 DNA-immunised mice was performed (i) 
to assess the specificity o f the antibodies and (ii) to experimentally confirm the 
hypothesis that the resultant antibodies, although generated from an E. ocellatus DNA 
construct, were able to cross-react with analogous molecules in the venom o f related 
Echis species. Accordingly, the sera (diluted 1:100) from the DNA-immunised mice were 
used to screen immunoblots containing venoms from E. oce//ato-[Nigeria] (1), E. 
oce//atMs-[Ghana] (2), E. pyramidum-[Saudi Arabia] (3), E. pyramidum-[Oman] (4), E. 
pyramidum-[lrm] (5), E. pyramidum leakeyi-[K.Qnya] (6), E. /?yra/wi/wm-[Tunisia] (7), E. 
pyramidum-[Ma\i] (8), E. multisquamatus-[Russia] (9), E. carinatus sochureki-\?2k\staxi\ 
(10), E. coloratus-[Saudi Arabia] (11) and E. co/ara/ws-[Israel] (12) (Fig.7.11).
It can be seen that antibody generated by GG (Fig.7.1 la) was cross reactive with high 
molecular weight bands [52 kDa] in all venoms, particularly those in E. ocellatus venom. 
As expected sera from mice immunised with EoDC-2 by the ID route (Fig.7.1 lb) were 
fainter than those from GG-immunised mice. Sera from the IM-immunised mice (data not 
shown) were as non-reactive as the control mice. However, bands o f  venom proteins 
below 33kDa have been recognised by all blots except in that where normal mouse serum
was used.

text], were probed with sera from mice immunised with EoDC-2 by GG (a), ID (b) or IM 
(c). Immunoblots (c), (d) and (e) were probed with sera from mice immunised with 
pSecTag-B by GG and ID, respectively. Whereas immunoblot (e) was probed with sera 
from normal mice. Lane 13 is the low molecular weight marker (BiorRad, UK).

7.5. DNA immunisation using cDNAs encoding other toxins in venom of E. 
ocella tus.
I also attempted to generate antibodies to E. ocellatus C-type lectin and serine protease 
by immunisation with cDNAs encoding EoCTL-1 (Chapter 3) and EoSer-20 (Chapter 4). 
The strategy involved was only slightly different from that described for EoDC-2 because 
the whole ORF of the CTL and serine protease were used for immunisation. Because the 
pSecTag-B vector contains a mammalian signal peptide, the venom sequences prepared 
for DNA immunisation were PCR amplified without the native signal peptide (Fig.7.12 
and Fig.7.13).
Subsequent TOPO subcloning and pSecTag-B ligation experiments were performed as 
for EoDc-2/pSecTag-B. The EoCTL-1 i/pSecTag-B and EoSer20i/pSecTag-B constructs 
were used to immunize mice by the GG, ID and IM routes. Unfortunately, the results 
(data not shown) showed that no seroconversion was obtained by any o f  the three DNA 
delivery routes with either the EoCTL-1 i or the EoSer-20i. The results were unexpected 
after the successful seroconversion obtained by DNA immunisation with EoDC- 
2/pSecTag-B.
The sequence data indicated that the EoDC-li and EoSer-20i cDNAs were correctly [in 
frame] inserted into the pSecTag-B plasmid. The DNA gold beads were shown to contain 
as much DNA as that recovered from the EoDC-2 coated gold beads (data not shown).

7.6. D iscussion
The remarkable progress o f DNA vaccination from the initial observation in 1992 that 
plasmids could be used to express exogenous DNA in mammalian cells and stimulate 
immune responses (Tang et al., 1992) to the current clinical trials (Liu, 2003) has largely 
been concerned with inducing protective cellular immune responses against intracellular 
bacteria, viruses and parasites. Some experimental DNA vaccines are proving to be as, in 
some cases, more effective than clinical vaccine formulations (Donnelly et al., 1995; 
Tascon et al., 1996).
Harrison et al., (2000) demonstrated for the first time that DNA immunisation is a 
promising technique for antivenom production because it represents a system o f  
generating toxin-specific antibodies. The primary objective o f this study was therefore to 
(i) use DNA immunisation to generate specific antibodies to the major haemostsis- 
disruptive toxins in the venom of E. ocellatus and (ii) to define the route o f  
administration favouring maximal induction o f specific antibodies.
PCR amplification was successful in amplifying the carboxyl-disintegrin and cysteine- 
rich domain [approximately 700bp] o f the EoMP-6 prothrombin activator cDNA (Hasson 
et al., 2003). The PCR product was sub-cloned into TOPO vector and inserted in frame 
the mammalian vector pSecTag-B.
Prior to DNA immunisation, the EoDc-2/pSecTag-B construct was used to transfect 
mammalian fibroblast cells, COS-7. This assay confirmed that EoDC/pSecTag-B was 
transcriptionally and translationally valid as illustrated by the detection o f the 28kD 
EoDC-2 protein in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The EoDC-2/pSecTag-B-transfected
Chapter 7: Immunisation with cDNA encoding haemostasis-disruption E. ocellatus venom toxins 205
COS-7 cells also confirmed that the EoDC-2 protein was secreted into the culture 
supernatant confirming the correct operation o f the signal peptide sequence (Fig.7.5a and 
Fig.7.5b). The next validation step was the confirmation that EoDC-2/pSecTag-B was 
successfully recovered from the Tefzel tubing shots. These assays were performed to 
ensure that all possible errors that may interfere with DNA immunisation, particularly by 
the Gene Gun, were eliminated.
Different routes o f DNA immunisation were evaluated. BALB/c mice received five 
immunisations o f three shots (3pg) for Gene Gun DNA delivery, or lOOpg for either ID 
or IM DNA delivery at each immunisation. The first three DNA immunisations were 
performed at two week intervals and the final immunisations were given at monthly 
intervals thereafter. Sera were collected from the immunised mice [by tail bleed] two 
weeks post immunisation.
The results o f the EoDC-2/pSecTag-B DNA immunisation clearly demonstrated that 
Gene Gun immunisation was superior to ID immunisation in terms o f  efficiency o f  
seroconversion. The inability o f the mice immunised with EoDC-2/pSecTag-B by IM to 
raise anti-EoDC-2 antibodies was unexpected. The plasmid used was from the same stock 
used to unsuccessfully immunize mice by the GG and ID routes, indicating that the 
plasmid was not at fault. This suggests that the route o f delivery was the problem. 
Harrison et al. (2000) observed that mice immunised with JD9 DNA [the DC domain of 
an analogous SVMP from the venom o f B. jararaca by IM raised markedly weaker 
antibody titres than mice immunised by Gene Gun. Together, these results indicate that 
IM DNA immunisation is not appropriate for raising antibodies.

I have observed that EoDC-2/pSecTag-B immunisation elicited a highly heterogenous 
response in mice (data not shown) [i.e., some mice responded while others did not]. DNA 
immunisation studies have previously provided evidence for differential transfection 
efficiencies in individual mice as reflected by variable levels o f expression o f the 
encoded protein (Wolf et al., 1990; Acsadi et al., 1991). The variation in the antibody 
response o f  individual mice within each group may reflect different rates o f epidermal 
cell transfection following GG and ID immunisations.
Results o f the time course o f both GG and ID immunisation with EoDC-2/pSecTag-B 
DNA antibody titres after the second immunisation showed barely detectable deficiencies 
from the background. Thereafter, antibody titres doubled with each immunisation in both 
the GG- and ID-immunised mice. This suggests that time intervals between boosts and/or 
DNA dosage needs to be investigated further with a view to improving the antibody titre. 
If time had permitted, I would have performed the latter experiments as well as 
investigating the antibody isotypic responses generated by the various routes of 
immunisation.
SVMPs from venoms o f phylogenetically related vipers show extensive molecular 
sequence and structural similarities (Bjamson and Fox, 1995; Nishida et al., 1995; Paine 
1992; Bjamson and Fox, 1994; Harrison et al., 2003). One o f the main theoretical 
attractions o f the DNA immunisation approach to generating toxin-specific antivenoms is 
that the extensive sequence and structural conservation o f venom toxins can be exploited 
to generate antivenoms capable o f neutralizing the venoms o f a wide variety o f snakes 
(Harrison, 2004). Conventional antivenoms are effective if  used against the snake venom 
used for immunisation (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). The phylogenetic limits to the
C h a p ter  7: Im m u n isa tio n  w ith  cD N A  e n co d in g  h a em o sta sis-d isru p tio n  E. oce lla tu s  ven o m  to x in s 207
cross-reactivity o f the EoDC-2 antibodies raised by GG and ID were examined by 
probing immunoblots o f venoms o f a variety o f Echis vipers (Fig.7.11a and Fig.7.11b). 
The EoDC-2-specific antibodies reacted to the 50-60 kDa molecules in the homologous E. 
ocellatus venom with an intensity matched by its reactivity with analogous bands in 
venoms o f E chis vipers o f various African origins. The immunological reactivity o f  the 
anti-EoDC-2 sera to components in Echis vipers from Iran (E. pyram idum ) and Pakistan 
(E. sochureki) was considerably weaker than that o f the E. ocella tus and the other African 
viper.
In conclusion GG delivery o f EoDc-2 DNA induced titres o f total IgG greater than those 
achieved by the ID or IM delivery routes. It has been suggested that direct transfection o f  
epidermal dendritic cells results in their migration to draining lymph nodes where antigen 
presentation to the immune system occurs (Robinson and Torres, 1997). The lower IgG 
titres obtained by ID injection suggest that this delivery route is markedly less efficient 
than GG in activating dendritic cells.
Binding o f the EoDC-2 antibody to the EoDC-2 domain o f E. ocella tus would be 
expected to interfere with the interaction o f  this domain to the a2Pi-integrins on platelets 
and thereby contribute to neutralization o f venom-induced haemorrhage. Alternatively, 
reports that the disintegrin-cysteine rich domain modulates the substrate specificity of 
venom MDCs (Kamiguti et al., 2003), and possibly their catalytic function (Jeon et al.,
1999), suggest that EoDC-2- specific antibody has the potential to inhibit the enzymatic 
degradation o f sub-endothelium by the E. ocella tus MP domain. It is conceivable that 
EoDC-2 antibody may operate in both modalities to inhibit venom haemorrhagic activity.

Regrettably, there was not enough time to test the venom-neutralizing efficacy o f the 
EoDC-2-specific antibody. This antibody would have been subjected to an in vitro 
Minimum Haemorrhagic Dose (Theakston and Reid, 1983) assay that determines the 
ability o f an antibody to neutralize anti-haemorrhage efficacy o f the antibody raised by 
the B. jararaca JD9 DNA construct (Harrison et al., 2000). Also because the JD9 domain 
was very similar in terms o f sequence and structure to EoDC, this suggests that the EDC- 
2 antibody should possess equal therapeutic efficiency against the toxins responsible for 
the haemorrhagic effect o f E. ocellatus venom.
The main problem in this part o f this study has been the lack o f seroconversion achieved 
following immunisation with DNA encoding E. ocellatus CTL and serine proteases and 
the lack o f time available for investigating factor(s) responsible. It is unlikely that for the 
pSecTag-B plasmid was responsible because this was the plasmid used for the successful 
EoDC-2 immunisations. It is possible that the expressed proteins were either toxic to the 
transfected murine cells, thus preventing production o f sufficient protein to stimulate an 
immune response. Alternatively, the expressed proteins were simply poor immunogens, 
despite the numerous antigenic motifs predicted for these proteins [see Jameson-Wolf 
algorithm profiles o f these proteins in Chapters 4 and 5]. Given more time, I would have 
performed RT-PCR of tissues shot by GG to assess transcription rates for the 
immunisation constructs and also probed frozen sections o f the skin with E. ocellatus 
venom-specific antibody to determine the translational efficacy o f DNA immunisation 
with the CTL and serine protease constructs.
Finally this is the first time ant-EoDC2 to be generated against the E. ocellatus venom 
prothrombin activator-like metalloprotease. Further characterisation o f this antibody is

now required to gain insight into its neutralization efficacy in order to have significant 
contribution and potential to improve the treatment o f systemic effects that exerted by the 
saw scaled viper E. ocellatus envenoming.

8.1. Introduction
Before the development o f improved vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (Kohler and 
Milstein 1975), antiserum was the therapy o f choice for a number o f diseases including 
tetanus, rabies and diptheria.'Full realization o f the therapeutic potential o f monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) was recently achieved by molecular humanization o f mAbs and 
linkage o f mAbs to target-killing agents such as toxins, radioisotopes, cytokines and 
enzymes which has enabled commercialization o f many mAb-based therapeutics against 
infectious and non-infectious diseases (Brekke and Sandlie, 2003; Trikha et al, 2002). One 
o f the difficulties in the field has been, and will continue to be, the selection from a large 
population, o f the specific antibody with the required function.
As shown earlier I have isolated numerous DNA sequences encoding some o f the most 
medically-important E. ocellatus venom toxins (Bharati et al, 2003; Harrison et al, 2003b; 
Hasson et al, 2003) as immunizing reagents to generate specific antibodies. Chapter 7 
describes the generation o f toxin specific antibodies by DNA immunisation. However, 
assessing the toxin-neutralizing efficacy o f such toxin-specific antibodies is problematic. 
The venom-neutralizing efficacy o f conventional antivenoms is routinely determined 
using in vivo lethality (LD50), haemorrhagic (MHD) median effective dose (ED50) 
estimation and necrosis by the minimum necrotising dose (MND) assays in mice and the 
intravenous injection (i.v. LD50) also in mice (WHO, 1981; Theakston and Reid, 1983; 
Laing et al., 1992; 1995). The lethality assays, in general, determine the amount o f  
antivenom which, when injected intravenously together with a defined lethal venom (or 
pool venoms) challenge dose in mice, results in the survival o f half the animals within the 
group after 24 hours. However, these assays are inappropriate for testing the toxin

neutralizing function o f specific antibodies generated to many venom toxins which, on 
their own, do not typically result in death, haemorrhage or necrosis (e.g., PLA2, CTL, 
serine proteases, hyaluronidase, L-amino acid oxidases).
Moreover, the demand for lower development costs, which are essential if  the product is 
to be purchased by hospitals and Ministries o f Health for use in high snake bite risk areas 
in the rural tropics, together with stringent UK Home Office regulations for humane 
animal experimentation, have encouraged a new approach to the design o f antivenom 
testing (Sells et al., 1997; 1998).
The modified zymography technique described here, developed to assess the potential of 
antibodies to neutralize snake venom toxins, enables efficient identification o f antibodies 
that inhibit protease function. Previously Bee et al, (2001) demonstrated that gelatin 
zymography (SDS-PAGE incorporating gelatin) is an efficient means o f identifying 
proteolytic enzymes in venoms. Because gelatin is denatured collagen, measurement o f  
venom gelatinolytic activity appears to be a reasonable, if  not infallible, in vitro method 
for estimating venom haemorrhagic activity. In this study I and other members o f the 
Alistair Reid Venom Research Unit, have explored whether the gelatin-zymography 
technique could be adapted to assess the ability o f antibodies to neutralize these enzymes. 
We report, for the first time, that the addition o f antivenom into the matrix o f the 
zymogram neutralizes the function o f venom gelatinolytic proteases. A  manuscript 
describing the work is currently under review for publication in the journal of 
Immunological Methods.

8.2. Materials and methods
8.2.1. Snake venoms
Venoms were extracted and lyophilised from snakes maintained in the herpetarium, 
Liverpool School o f Tropical Medicine.
(i) Five venom samples from E.ocellatus occurring in distinct geographical areas 
[Fanshin, Langtang, Zamko, Saminako and Kaltungo] in Nigeria were used for 
SDS-PAGE.
(ii) Two different sets o f venoms were used for the antibody zymography assays. 
The first consisted o f ten viper species; Bothrops ja ra ra c a  [Bj] and B. atrox  [Ba] from 
Brazil, B itis arietans [Bita] from Ghana, Crotalus atrox  [Ca], C. virid is  helleri [Cvh] and 
Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus [Acl] from USA, P rotobothrops f la vo v ir id is  [Pf] from 
Japan, E chis ocellatus [Eo] from Nigeria, E. pyram idum  leakeyi [Epl] from Kenya, and 
C erastes cerastes cerastes [Ccc] from Egypt. The second set consisted o f  venoms from 
twelve Echis viper species; E. m ultisquam atus [Em] from Turkmenistan, E. pyram idum  
[Ep-SA] and E. coloratus [Ec-SA] from Saudia Arabia, E. pyram idum  [Ep-I] from Iran, E. 
pyram idum  [Ep-O] from Oman, E. pyram idum  leakeyi [Epl] from Kenya, E. ocellatus 
[Eo-N] from Nigeria, E. sochureki [Es] from Pakistan, E. leu cogaster [El] from Mali, E. 
pyram idum  [Ep-T] from Tunisia, E. ocellatus [Eo-G] from Ghana and E. coloratus [Ec-Is] 
from Israel.

SDS-PAGE was performed as described in Chapter two.
Chapter 8: Antibody zymography: a novel in vitro assay to determine the protease-neutralizing potential o f  specific antibodies and snake antivenoms. 214
8.2.3 Antivenom s
Two antivenoms were used in this analysis. EchiTAb (Micropharm Ltd, Wales) is an 
effective antivenom developed in sheep immunised with venom from E. ocellatus (Laing 
et al, 1995; Meyer et al., 1997) consisting o f ovine, papain-cleaved Fab fragments o f IgG. 
The SAIMR Echis antivenom, developed in horses immunised with E. ocellatus venom 
(South African Institute for Medical Research, SAIMR) consists o f equine, pepsin-cleaved 
F(at/)2 IgG fragments (Theakston, 1997). I have used Fab fragment antibody from non- 
immunised sheep (MicroPharm, Ltd) and immunoglobulin (Ig)-depleted foetal calf serum 
as controls. The starting concentration for the antivenoms and control sera was 120mg/ml 
and PBS was used to prepare dilutions.
8.2.4. Gelatin-zymography
The gelatin-zymograms were constructed using published protocols (Feitosa et ah, 1998). 
Fifteen percent SDS-PAGE (3.75 ml o f 40% polyacrylamide, 2.5 ml Tris-pH 6.8, 2.5 ml 
distilled water, 150 pi o f SDS, 50pl o f 10% ammonium persulphate and lOpl TEMED) 
gels were co-polymerized with 2.5 ml molten gelatin (Sigma) at a final concentration o f 
2.5mg/ml in a Mini Protean 3 apparatus (BioRAD). Venoms were reconstituted with cold 
PBS (4C) to a final concentration o f 5mg/ml and mixed with an equal volume o f protein 
loading buffer lacking P-mercaptoethanol (2%SDS, 62mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 % 
bromophenol blue and 10% glycerol without boiling). Ten microliter o f  each venom was 
added to the gelatin zymogram and separated by electrophoresis at 115 volts for 90 
minutes. To re-nature venom proteolytic enzymes, SDS was removed from the gel by 
three 10 minute washes in 2.5% Triton-X 100 (BDH) solution. The gels were then

incubated overnight at 37C in zymogram reactivating buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 
mM CaCh, 10 ng NaN3), stained with 5% Coomassie Blue R-250 (BDH) for 15 minutes 
and destained with a 30% methanol, 7% acetic acid and 63% water solution. Clear zones 
o f substrate lysis against a blue background indicated the presence o f gelatinolytic venom 
enzymes.
8.2.5. Antibody-zymography
To assess the protease-neutralizing efficacy o f antivenom, simply substituted water for 
antivenom or control antibody preparations in the preparation o f the zymograms, without 
further modification o f the gel constituents or protocol. The total volume o f the mini gel 
was 5.6 ml. Therefore to achieve the required dilution o f antibody preparations o f 1:10 (12 
mg/ml antivenom), 1:100 (1.2 mg/ml antivenom) and 1:1000 (0.12 mg/ml antivenom), I 
respectively substituted 560 pi, 56 pi and 5.6 pi o f water with antibody. The total volume 
o f water or water/antibody was 2.5 ml.
8.2.6. Antibody SDS-PA GE control gels
To investigate the extent to which antibody in gels inhibited the electrophoretic migration 
o f venom proteins, I constructed and performed antibody-zymograms as above, but 
without gelatin. The venom protein profiles were conventionally stained with Coomassie
blue.

This section demonstrates the proteome profile o f E. ocellatus venom from five different 
regions in Nigeria. Although samples were loaded with the same concentration (5mg/ml) 
and showed similarities in the number of protein bands, the intensity o f their protein 
composition varied somewhat. This was apparent in venoms particularly from Zamko and

composition (Fig.8.1) and protease-activity (Fig.8.2) o f E. ocellatus venom and thus, were 
selected for all future experiments performed in this chapter.

Comparison of the E. ocellatus venom protein profile with venoms from other Echis 
species demonstrated a generally dominant composition of 50-60 kDa, 25-30 kDa and 10- 
20 kDa molecules with minor variants between the species (Fig.8.3). Further investigation 
should determine whether these similarities and differences correlate with the functional 
effects of the venoms.

All the viper venoms contained gelatinolytic proteases as illustrated in the conventional

activity was evident across all the viper genera (Fig.8.4a) and even within species o f the 
same genus (Fig.8.5a). Several samples from both sets o f venoms had only a single 
proteolytic band, whereas others contained two or more gelatinolytic proteases o f distinct 
molecular weight. With some exceptions, the Echis venoms contained fewer high 
molecular weight gelatinolytic proteases than venoms from other species as shown in 
(Fig.8.4a). While the gelatinolytic activity o f  each batch o f venom was consistent within 
each experiment, there were batch-batch differences in venoms from some species (eg, E. 
p. leakeyi (Epl) in Fig.8.4a and Fig.8.4b). Venoms from snakes o f the same species can 
exhibit age-related functional changes (Theakston and Reid, 1978), which may account for 
the above batch-batch gelatinolytic profile differences.
8.3.4.2. Antibody gelatin zym ography.
The addition o f antibodies to the matrix o f the gelatin zymograms achieved the objective 
of illustrating the protease-neutralizing ability o f antibodies and identifying the molecular 
weight o f  the target protease. The gelatinolytic activities o f the first set o f viper venoms 
(Fig. 8.4a) were abolished by the presence o f the highest concentration o f antivenom (1:10) 
in the zymogram (Fig.8.4b) and inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by inclusion o f Fab 
EchiTAb at 1:100 and 1:1000 concentrations (Fig.8.4c and d). Zymograms 
incorporating 1:10 concentrations o f either control [normal] sheep Fab (Fig.8.4e) showed 
proteolytic profiles similar to that o f the conventional zymogram (Fig.8.4a), demonstrating 
that the protease-neutralizing ability o f EchiTAb was effected by specific Fab 
immunoglobulin molecules.

The ability o f the SAIMR Echis equine F(ab7)2 antivenom to neutralize the gelatinolytic 
proteases in venoms o f the various Echis vipers was similarly dose-dependent (Fig.8.5b, c 
and d). Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain F(ab;)2 from non-immunised horses to run 
this appropriate control. Some venom proteases in the SAIMR antivenom zymograms 
appeared to be more subjected to a delayed migration (smearing Figures 2c and d) than 
gels containing the EchiTAb antivenom and we attribute this observation to the larger 
fragment size o f the F(ab7)2 in the SAIMR antivenom.
8.3.4.S. Antibody SDS-PAGE
The possibility that inclusion o f antivenom in the gel matrix resulted in indiscriminate 
precipitation o f the venom proteins was a concern and difficult to assess because staining 
o f gelatin made visualization o f the venom proteins difficult. To address this, I have 
constructed and performed antibody-zymograms as above, but without gelatin (Fig.8.6).  
The venom proteins were very difficult to detect in the AZ gel (Fig.8.6b) incorporating 
EchiTAb at 1:10 concentration because o f the blanket staining o f the IgG Fab fragments 
but they were readily seen in AZ gels incorporating EchiTAb at 1:100 and 1:1000 
(Fig.8.6c and d, respectively). The migration profiles o f the venom proteins in the latter 
two gels were nearly identical to the AZ gels without antivenom (Fig.8.6a). These results 
indicate that, at antivenom concentrations which permitted detection o f the venom 
proteins, inclusion o f antivenom into the AZ gel did not significantly effect venom protein 
electrophoretic mobility.

8.4. D iscussion
In the first attempt to identify antibodies specific to gelatinolytic venom proteins, I have 
subjected venom/gelatin-zymograms to conventional immunoblotting procedures and 
incubated the nitrocellulose filters with antivenoms using protocols similar to those 
described by Poppelmann et al., (2002). This adaptation was however quickly 
discontinued because o f the poor visual quality o f the results and because it provided no 
useful data on the protease-neutralizing ability o f the antibodies.
I next adopted conventional methods to determine the preclinical efficacy o f antivenom. 
Thus, venom and equine antivenom were incubated together at 37C for 30 minutes and 
then the mixture was subjected to gelatin-zymography. Unfortunately this assay was not 
satisfactory because o f the extensive distortion in the higher molecular weight range o f the 
gel, which I presumed to be due to the intact IgG. I did not proceed further with this 
protocol because o f additional concerns over the possibility that IgG/protease complexes 
in the starting mixture would be separated during electrophoresis and thus restore the 
gelatinolytic activity o f the protease.
Since the first description o f gelatin-zymography (Heussen and Dowdle, 1980), there have 
been several modifications including incorporation o f substrates such as starch (Martinez 
et al, 2000), fibrin (Choi et al, 2001), fibrinogen (Komori et al 1994), casein (Raser, 1995) 
and milk powder (Poppelmann et al, 2002) to detect and isolate proteases from biological 
materials. Immunoblotting o f zymograms has also been used to detect proteases in 
complex culture supernatants (Poppelmann et al, 2002). Reverse zymography, which 
incorporates proteases and protease substrates in the gel matrix, has been used to identify
Chapter 8: Antibody zymography: a novel in vitro assay to determine the protease-neutralizing potential o f  specific antibodies and snake antivenoms. 225
endogenous inhibitors o f mammalian collagenase and stromelysin (Herron et al, 1986) and 
snake venom inhibitors o f venom gelatinolytic proteases (Bee et al, 2001). My present 
data demonstrating that the protease-neutralizing function o f specific antibodies is retained 
when antibody is incorporated into the zymogram gel matrix, further extends the 
versatility o f this technique. I have named this technique antibody zymography.
The incorporation o f viper antivenoms, comprising either Fab or F(ab/)2 fragments o f IgG 
from sheep (Fig.8.4b, c, and d) or horses (Fig.8.5e, b, c and d) immunised with viper 
venoms, into gelatin-zymograms demonstrated a concentration-dependent neutralization 
o f viper venom proteases. The contrasting ineffectiveness o f Fab from non-immunised 
sheep (Fig.8.4e) and Ig-depleted foetal calf serum (Fig.8.5e) in this assay demonstrated 
that antivenom-neutralization o f venom proteases was affected by specific 
immunoglobulin moieties. I had not anticipated that antivenoms generated against venom 
from a single Echis species would prove capable o f neutralizing venom proteases from 
such a wide spectrum o f phylogenetically diverse vipers. In mitigation o f this apparent 
lack o f specificity o f the technique, it is important to note that the amino acid sequence 
and structure o f venom proteases are highly conserved amongst the vipers (Bjamason and 
Fox, 1994; Moura da Silva et al., 1995; Kini and Evans, 1987; Oyama and Takahashi, 
2002) and that antivenoms (Komalik and Taborska, 1989) and specific antivenom toxin 
antibodies (Harrison et al., 2003; Tanjoni et al., 2003) exhibit equal ability to bind to 
venom proteins from diverse viper species.
A restriction o f the antibody zymogram technique is that it is preferable to incorporate 
purified IgG components rather than whole anti sera into the gel matrix. Thus, I obtained
Chapter 9: Antibody zymography: a novel in vbro assay to determine the protease^neutralizing potential o f  specific antibodies and snake antivenoms. 226
identical protease-inhibiting results (not shown) from venom gelatin-zymograms 
incorporating sera from venom toxin DNA-immunised mice and normal mice. This result 
is consistent with that o f Escalante et al. (2004) and strongly indicates that there are 
protease-inhibitory elements including a 2-macroglobulin in murine sera that mask the 
inhibitory activities o f protease-specific antibodies. The lack o f constitutive protease 
inhibitors in foetal calf serum (Fig.8.5e) indicate, however, that this is not likely to be 
universal amongst mammalian sera and is consistent with the observation that some 
mammals, such as opossum, hedgehog and mongoose, contain inhibitors o f venom 
proteases that confer significant resistance to the pathology o f viper envenoming (Rocha 
et al, 2002).
The size o f the immunoglobulin molecule incorporated into the zymogram is another 
restriction o f the antibody zymogram method. Results (data not shown) from zymograms 
incorporating equine antivenoms consisting o f intact IgG showed extensive inhibition o f  
the electrophoretic migration o f venom gelatinolytic proteases and distorted the upper 
region o f the zymogram. It is possible that this anomaly could be reduced by substitution 
o f glycine with tricine in the construction o f the SDS-PAGE (Martinez-Moya et al., 2002). 
Furthermore, the smaller the IgG fragments, the greater the likelihood that they will 
migrate under electrophoretic pressure because they are less tightly enmeshed within the 
zymogram matrix. I believe that this explains the reproducibile bichromic image o f the 
Fab EchiTAb antivenom (Fig.8.4b) as opposed to the monochromic image o f the F(ab;)2 
SAIMR antivenom (Fig.8.5b) at 1:10 concentrations. I have postulated that the bichromic 
image o f the Fab antivenom disappears at 1:100 and 1:1000 concentrations (Fig.8.4c and d
Chapter 8: Antibody zymography: a novel in vitro assay to determine the protease-neutralizing potential o f  specific antibodies and snake antivenoms. 227
respectively) because the diluted IgG fragments comprise less o f the Coomassie Blue- 
stained matrix than at the 1:10 concentration.
Despite these limitations, the antibody zymogram is likely to prove useful for assessing 
the ability o f specific antibodies to neutralize the in vitro functions o f venom zinc 
metalloproteases and serine proteases. Work needs to be done in future to determine 
whether the antibody zymogram can be further modified into an ELISA format, along the 
lines o f the gelatin degradation ELISA which has been utilised previously (Bee et al, 
2001). If successful this will increase the high throughput potential o f the technique. It is 
also possible that antibody zymography could reduce the numbers o f mice required for 
current preclinical efficacy assessment o f viper antivenoms.

General discussion
C hapter 9: G enerai discussion 229
9.1. G eneral discussion
The overall objective o f my PhD project was to generate antibodies by DNA 
immunisation against the most haemostasis-disruptive molecules in E. ocellatus venom. 
These were identified, as discussed in Chapter 1, as SVMPs, PLA2S, CTLs and serine 
proteases. Because cDNAs encoding these molecules from E. ocellatus venom were not 
present in the genetic databases, it was necessary for me to create an E. ocellatus venom 
gland cDNA library to isolate toxin-encoding cDNA.
An E. ocellatus venom gland cDNA library was therefore constructed and demonstrated 
[by random isolation o f cDNA] to contain sequences o f sizes ranging from 1.8 to 0.4 KB. 
DNA encoding the target toxins were expected to fall within this range. The absence o f  
specific antibody to the target E. ocellatus toxins discounted an antibody-screening 
approach to isolate toxin-encoding cDNAs. Therefore, a DNA screening approach was 
needed. A conventional DNA-hybridization screening o f the library was impossible 
because o f the lack o f specific toxin-encoding DNA. The only viable technique was 
therefore PCR amplification. The next scientific challenge was therefore to design PCR 
primers to enable the isolation o f cDNAs encoding the target molecules. I approached this 
by examining numerous DNA sequences encoding the target toxins from a wide variety o f  
vipers as possible. It was soon apparent that, despite extreme phylogenetic and 
geographical origin differences between the vipers, the toxin sequences contained domains 
that were highly conserved. Since these domains included the extreme 5 signal peptide 
sequences and, usually, the extreme 3 terminals, it was obvious that I could exploit this 
phylogenetic sequence conservation to achieve the project objectives. Accordingly, I 
designed consensus 5 and 3  PCR primers for PLA2, CTL and serine proteases. A slightly
C hapter 9: G eneral discussion 230
different approach was taken for PCR amplification o f SVMPs because (i) the large 
propeptide domain o f  SVMPs is cleaved to produce the nascent protein and (ii) the 
SVMP-specific DNA immunisation construct was always intended to express only the C- 
terminal DC domain.
This PCR approach to isolating E. ocellatus toxin encoding cDNA was highly successful 
and resulted in a significant contribution to the literature and genetic databases concerning 
SVMPs (Harrison et al., 2003), PLA2 (Bharati et al., 2003), CTL (Harrison et al., 2003) 
and serine proteases (unpublished). The main contributions o f  these studies, as described 
in detail in the previous chapters, are summarized bellow.
E. ocellatus PLA2-encoding cDNA. In Chapter 3 I described the isolation o f novel cDNAs 
encoding twenty colonies (E0PLA2 1-20) o f  416 nucleotides that corresponded to an open 
reading frame that predicts a polypeptide o f 138 amino acids and a molecular weight o f 
15.7kDa. The isolated clones were identified (BLAST) as belonging to the sub-group II o f  
the PLA2 superfamily. The observed sequence discrepancies o f the E0PLA2 cDNAs 
revealed six distinct variants out o f the twenty clones mentioned above. The deduced 
amino acid sequences o f these cDNAs encoded proteins with high overall sequence 
similarity to the viper group II PLA2 protein family. The work described in this chapter 
formed part o f  a publications by our group (Bahrati et al., 2003).
E. ocellatus CTL-encoding cDNA. In Chapter 4 I reported the cloning o f  novel cDNA 
sequences encoding seven groups o f the haemostasis-disruptive C-type lectin (CTL) 
proteins from the venom glands o f E. ocellatus. All these CTL sequences consisted o f 441 
nucleotides that were predicted to encode open reading frame proteins o f 148 amino acids
C hapter 9: G enerai discussion 231
(17.2 kDa). All EoCTL sequences showed a greater sequence similarity to the P than a  
CTL subunits in venoms o f related Asian and American vipers. The work in this chapter 
formed part o f  a publication by our group (Harrison et al., 2003)
E. ocellatus serine protease-encoding cDNA. The utilization o f PCR amplification o f E. 
ocellatus venom gland cDNA with the viper serine protease-specific primers was 
successful and produced 14 cDNAs sequences that were identified (BLAST) as belonging 
to the serine protease enzyme family. All EoSP cDNAs were o f  similar total length 
(approximately 0.80 kb) and encoded 260 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight 
o f 28.5 kDa. Using a surface probability algorithm, I was able to assign the 14 E. ocellatus 
serine protease cDNAs into four main variants [EoSP-01, EoSP-03, EoSP-07 and EoSP- 
17]. Sequence similarities o f the EoSP variants were 62-80% with the kinin-releasing and 
fibrinogen-clotting serine protease (KN-BJ) from venom o f B. jararaca (Serrano et al., 
1998).
E. ocellatus SVMP-encoding cDNA. I have described the isolation o f  E. ocellatus venom 
gland cDNAs encoding a protein o f 514 amino acids that showed 91% sequence similarity 
to Ecarin, a prothrombin-activating metalloproteinase from the venom o f the East African 
viper, E. pyramidum leakeyi, that induces severe consumption coagulopathy. The high 
degree o f sequence conservation o f EoMP-6 with other prothrombin-activating and 
haemorrhagic metalloproteinases o f related vipers extended to the conservation of 
structural domains predicted to have high immunogenic potential. The work in this chapter 
has been published (Hasson et al., 2003)
C hapter 9: G eneral tU seusslan 232
The platelet-aggregating disintegrin venom toxins were not included in the target list 
because I considered that the sequence similarity o f disintegrin to the DC domain o f the 
SVMP was so extensive that an antibody against the DC domain would be predicted to 
neutralize both disintegrin and SVMP function. There are a number o f  other important 
viper toxins [as described in Chapter 1] that were not included in the target list such as L 
amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase and bradykinin-like molecules. The shortage o f  
sequence data for these additional viper toxins, which may or may not be present in E. 
ocellatus venom, coupled with the lack o f  available time meant that I could not 
incorporate these molecules into my PhD objectives.
My next task was to prepare DNA immunisation constructs from the cDNAs I isolated 
that encoded E. ocellatus SVMP, CTL and serine protease toxins. There was insufficient 
time to process the E. ocellatus PLA2 cDNA into an immunisation construct. To achieve 
this, I manipulated the cDNAs to remove the native signal peptide from the EoCTL and 
Eoserine protease sequences because a murine signal peptide was incorporated within the 
pSecTag-B plasmid. For the reasons described above and in Chapter 7, I removed the 
partial propeptide and metalloprotease-catalytic domains from E0MP-6 to create an 
immunisation construct designed to express only the DC domain. For reasons that are not 
obvious, mice immunised with the EoCTL and Eoserine protease constructs failed to 
seroconvert. In contrast, mice immunised with the EoDC DNA construct responded with 
high titres o f  IgG. My results showed that the route o f DNA delivery was very important 
in terms o f  the efficiency o f  seroconversion. Intramuscular injection o f DNA failed to 
stimulate detectable antibody responses, intradermal injections o f EoDC DNA induced 
modest IgG responses suggesting that the skin is a more favoured tissue for DNA injection
C hapter 9: G eneral discussion 233
than muscle. However, Gene Gun immunisation was shown to induce far superior IgG 
titres. This result agrees with the literature (Harrison et al., 2000) as describe in extensive 
details in Chapter 1.
The cellular responses o f the DNA immunised mice was not examined in this study 
because the ultimate intent was to generate antibodies for passive serotherapy and not for 
vaccine purposes.
The results presented in Chapter 7 also showed that the EoDC-specific antibody reacted 
with analogous molecules in venoms o f  a variety o f  Echis species. This result was 
predicted from the antigenic index profile study performed in Chapter 6. If immunoblot 
reactivity is an accurate measure o f  toxin neutralization [which is yet to be empirically 
determined], then these results suggest that the structural conservation o f  venom toxins 
from phylogenetically-distinct vipers can be exploited by our toxin-specific antivenom 
approach to generate antivenoms ideally o f remarkable potential. The treatment o f snake 
bite by conventional antivenoms requires the administration o f  antivenoms raised from the 
same venom as that which envenomed the patient (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). Other 
potential advantages o f the toxin-specific DNA immunisation approach to antivenom 
include: cost -  the more polyspecific an antivenom the less the production cost. 
Production -  the production o f  DNA is cheaper than any other immunizing material- 
including snake venom. Safety -  does not involve extraction from highly dangerous 
snakes. However, attractive the potential o f this approach to antivenom production is, 
there are several major obstacles to overcome. These include (i) the limitation o f  the PCR 
approach, (ii) deciding upon the range o f toxins required for inclusion in the DNA
C hapter 9: G eneral d iscussien 234
immunisation to achieve maximal therapeutic effect (iii) how will the volumes o f the 
respective toxin-specific antibodies comprising the final antivenom be determined (iv) the 
seroconversion effectiveness o f  sheep or horses, animals more appropriate to antivenom 
production than mice, to DNA immunisation are likely to be lower than mice. Therefore, 
considerable work will need to be conducted to identify the optimal plasmid constructs 
and immunisation protocols for generating high titre toxin-specific antibodies in sheep and 
horses.  .
Another problem specific to the toxin-specific DNA immunisation approach to antivenom 
production is the assessment o f  the efficacy o f each antibody species. All o f  the current 
antivenom efficacy assays involve the assessment o f  the ability o f  an antivenom to 
neutralize highly complex physiological effects o f whole venom. These effects require 
synergistic activities o f  many venom toxins that are usually not exerted by a single toxin. 
Therefore, the above assays are not suited and not appropriate for adequate preclinical 
tests on toxin-specific DNA immunisation-derived antibodies. The exception is the 
SVMPs that are capable o f eliciting haemorrhage in the absence o f  other molecules. For 
this reason the MHD assay has been successfully used to determine the haemorrhagic 
effect o f  SVMPs (Howes et al., 2003) and the neutralizing efficacy o f  SVMP-specific 
antibody (Harrison et al., 2000). However, the MHD and other in vivo assays would not be 
appropriate for assessing the toxin-neutralizing-efficacy o f  antibodies generated to CTLs, 
serine proteases, disintegrins, PLA2 and so on. To investigate a solution to this problem, I 
adapted an existing technique [zymography] that identifies proteins with proteolytic 
activity, by adding procedures to allow the identification o f antibodies capable o f  
neutralizing that proteolytic activity. I reasoned that (i) many o f  the most potent viper
C hapter 9: G enerai discussion 235
toxins are enzymes; (ii) that zymogram substrates are available for most o f these venom 
toxins and (iii) that incorporating antibodies into the zymogram matrix would be likely to 
prevent enzyme function. The results presented in Chapter 8 largely ratify these 
predictions and indicate that while the new technique, called antibody zymography, has 
many useful applications, it also has limitations. The limitation with the greatest bearing 
on the present project is that antibody to be analysed must be a Fab or F(ab)2 derivative o f  
the intent IgG. This observation meant that I could not submit my EoDC-specific 
antibodies to the test, and is true for most antibodies our group generates in mice, because 
the volume o f antibody generated from DNA-immunised mice is insufficient for the assay 
after removal o f the Fc domain. It also means that our group will need to produce toxin- 
specific antibodies in rabbits [or other animals yielding larger volumes o f sera] if  we wish 
to utilize this new test. The test does however, have many applications outside o f the 
venom field, example testing the functional utility o f monoclonal antibodies. A manuscript 
describing this work is being reviewed for publication in the Journal o f Immunological 
Methods.
Finally the results obtained in this study were significant and may contribute in 
representing a valuable addition to the venom gland transcriptome o f the saw scaled viper 
E. ocellatus and revealed the toxins composition o f the E. ocellatus viper to be as complex 
as that o f the better characterised New World vipers. However, given the experience 
obtained in this project I would advocate preliminary experiments to determine whether 
the generated antibody against the carboxyl-disintegrin cysteine-rich domain, o f the 
metalloprotease-like prothrombin activator, would contribute in neutralizing the effects of 
haemorrhgins in venom o f E. ocellatus as well as other Echis species.

Cloning of a prothrombin activator-like metalloproteinase from

Abstract
Systemic envenoming by the saw-scaled viper, E chis ocellatus, is responsible for more deaths than any other snake in West 
Africa. Despite its medical importance, there have been few investigations into the toxin composition of the venom of this viper. 
Here we describe the isolation of E. ocella tus venom gland cDNAs encoding a protein of 514 amino acids that showed 91% 
sequence similarity to Ecarirt, a prothrombin-activating metalloproteinase from the venom of the East African viper, E. 
pyram idum  leakeyi, that induces severe consumption coagulopathy. Structural similarities between the E. ocellatus 
metalloproteinase and analogues in venoms of related vipers suggest that antibodies raised to phylogenetically conserved E. 
ocella tus metalloproteinase domains may have potential for cross-specific and cross-generic neutralisation of analogous venom 
toxins.

The saw-scaled viper E chis ocella tus is the most abundant 
(Trape et al., 2001) and medically important viper species in 
West Africa (WarreU and Arnett, 1976). In Nigeria, E. 
ocellatus is responsible for 95% of all envenoming by 
snakes (Meyer et al., 1997), causing several hundred deaths 
annually (Pugh and Theakston, 1980; Chippaux, 2002). In 
some areas, victims of E. ocella tus envenoming occupy 70% 
of hospital beds (Revault, 1996). Local effects of E chis viper 
envenoming include pain, swelling, blistering and haemor
rhage which, in severe cases, can lead to necrosis, 
permanent disfigurement and even amputation of the 
affected limb (Warrell etal., 1977). Systemic effects include 
potentially lethal consumption coagulopathy, haemoirhage 
and hypovolaemic shock (Warrell et al., 1977). Despite the 
medical importance of E. ocellatus, few studies have been

conducted to identify the venom toxins responsible for these 
effects. In a recent effort to more clearly define the venom 
gland transcriptome of E. ocella tus we have Isolated DNA 
sequences encoding phospholipase A2 (PLA^ and C-type 
lectin (CTL) isoforms from an E. ocella tus venom gland 
cDNA library (Bharati et al., 2003; Harrison et al., 2003a). 
Studies on the venoms of related vipers have shown (i) that 
group II PLA2s exert a variety of anti-coagulant, platelet 
aggregation-inhibitory, cytotoxic and, in some American pit 
vipers, neurotoxic effects (Kini and Evans, 1990; Markland, 
1998) and (ii) that CTLs contribute to blood incoagulability 
by their distinct effects on the coagulation cascade and 
platelet aggregation (Wisner et al., 2002). In conjunction 
with colleagues who chromatographically isolated a hae
morrhagic E. ocellatus venom metalloproteinase (Howes 
et al., 2003), we next sought to isolate DNA sequences 
encoding E. ocellatus venom metalloproteinases.
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are members 
of the reprolysin family of zinc-containing metalloprotei
nases (Bjamason and Fox, 1995) and are grouped into four 
classes ( I -IV )  based on their structural composition. The 
group I  SVMPs comprise a catalytic domain that is

sequentially and C-tenninally extended with a RGD- 
containing disintegrin domain (group II), a cysteine-rich 
domain (group III) and a C-type lectin domain (group IV ). 
The group III SVMPs typically possess greater haemor
rhagic activity than the other groups (Gutierrez and 
Rucavado, 2000); these were therefore the target of this 
study.
We exploited the extensive sequence similarity of the 
group in viper SVMPs (Bjamason and Fox, 1994; Paine 
et al., 1994; Selistre de Araujo and Ownby, 1995) to design 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers complimentary to 
highly conserved regions within the N-terminal propeptide 
domain (VEDHCY) and at the C-terminus (CVD VN TA Y). 
E. ocellatus (origin: Kaltango, Nigeria) venom gland cDNA 
was subjected to PCR with the S ' (G G A TCC -ATG -G TT- 
CA G -G A T-CA C -TG C -TA T; incorporating a methionine 
start codon and a Earn H I site) and 31 (CTCG AG -TCA- 
G TA -A TC -A TC -CA G -G TC -A TC -A C C -CC T; incorporat
ing a stop codon and a X ho  I  site) PCR primers using a 
thermal cycler (Gene Cycler, BioRad California, USA) 
programmed for an initial denaturing (95 C, 6 min) and 
annealing (70 C, 1 min) step, followed by 35 cycles of 
extension (74 C), denaturing (95 Q and annealing (63 C) 
steps of 1 min each and terminating with an extension step 
(74 Q of 7 min. Amplicons of the expected size (1.5 Kb) 
were purified from an agarose gel, ligated into a TA  cloning 
vector (pCR-2.1-TOPO; Invitrogen, Groning, Netherlands) 
and used to transform chemically competent E scherichia  
co li (TOP 10F; Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA from several 
colonies was sequenced using a Beckman Coulter CEQTM  
2000 X L  DNA analysis instrument The DNA sequences of 
four clones were virtually identical (98% sequence simi
larity) and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence 
(encoding a 57KDa protein) of a representative cDNA 
(termed EoM P-6, GenBank accession number AY261531) 
is described in Fig. 1.
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) searches of the genetic 
databases revealed the deduced amino acid sequence of 
E oM P-6  to be 91% and 59% similar to the prothrombin
activating SVMPs of E. pyram idum  leakyi (Ecarin, A55796 
(Nishida et al., 1995)) and B othrops erythrom elas (Bery- 
thractivase, AAL47169 (Silva et al., 2003)), respectively. 
E oM P -6  also showed high levels of sequence similarity to 
haemorrhagic SVMPs from Bolhrops ja ra ra ca  (Jararhagin, 
59%, P30431 (Paine et al., 1992)), Agkistrodon contortrix  
laticinctus (Aclh, 58%, AAL47169 (Selistre de Araujo and 
Ownby, 1995)), C rota lus atrox  (Catrocollastatin, 59%, 
S55270 (Zhou et al., 1995)), Prolobothrops flavovirid is  
(Hrla, 58%, BAB92013 (Kishimoto and Takahashi, 2002)) 
and E. pyram idum  leakeyi (Ech-L 54%, S48160 and Ech-II, 
56%, S48169, (Paine et al., 1994). The inferred amino acid 
sequence of E oM P -6  was aligned to the above sequences 
using the CLUSTAL W program (Thompson et al., 1994) 
with PAM 250 residue weight matrix (Fig. 2).
E oM P -6  has the same modular organization as SVMPs 
from related vipers with a highly conserved pro-peptide
domain containing the cysteine switch motif (PKM CGVT) 
thought to prevent proteolytic activity of the zymogen (Silva 
et al., 2003; Siigur et al., 1996). The E oM P -6  proteolytic 
domain (MP) is typically less conserved except for those 
residues of structural (CI/VM methionine turn and all 
cysteine residues) or catalytic (M XXEXXH XXG XXH  zinc
binding motif) significance. The met-tum is thought to 
promote hydrophobic interactions within the protein 
structure thereby ensuring the structural integrity of the 
zinc-binding site (Selistre de Araujo and Ownby, 1995). The 
zinc-binding site (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1993) is the active site 
responsible for the haemorrhagic activiy of these proteases 
(Bjamason and Fox, 1994). In common with Ecarin and 
Berythractivase, but in contrast to the other haemorrhagic 
SVMPs, E oM P-6  encoded a protein with three consensus N -  
giycosylation sites (NXS/T) at position 160, 194 and 225. 
While the functional significance of this observation 
remains unclear it suggests a closer structural, and perhaps 
functional, alignment of E oM P -6  to the prothrombin
activating SVMPs. The disintegrin domain of E oM P -6  
contains a DCD motif that aligns to the a2p, collagen 
receptor-binding ECD motif of Jararhagin (Kamiguti, 
1997). It is unclear whether the D for E  substitution in 
E o M P -6  has functional significance. The C-terminal 
cysteine-rich domain of E oM P -6  showed a high level of 
sequence similarity to this region in other SVMPs, including 
Atrolysin A in venom of C. a tro x  (Jia et al., 2000) and 
specific sequence motifs in Jararhagin (HQC-DAC{317- 
334} and VKC-PGQ{362-377}) which have been attrib
uted with platelet-inhibitory function by binding to a2Pi 
integrin (Kamiguti et al., 2003).
This study is part of a project to isolate DNA 
sequences encoding the most clinically significant E. 
ocella tus toxins prior to their use as DNA immunization 
constructs to develop a panel of toxin-specific antibodies 
with venom-neutralising potential (Bharati et al., 2003; 
Harrison et al., 2000, 2002, 2003a, 2003b). To guide the 
design of the DNA immunization constructs and to 
evaluate the potential inter-specific and inter-generic 
immunoreactivity of each toxin-specific antibody (thereby 
estimating the geographic limits of their potential clinical 
usefulness), we have used a protein structure-predicting 
algorithm (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) to (i) identify 
domains of strong antigenic potential in the toxin gene 
product and (ii) determine whether these domains are 
conserved in analogous venom toxin gene products of 
related vipers. Because the propeptide domain of SVMPs 
is post-translationally cleaved from the mature venom 
protein (Bjarnason and Fox, 1994), this domain was 
excluded from the analysis of the predicted E oM P -6  gene 
product (Fig. 3).
The peaks in the E oM P-6  antigenic index profile (Fig. 3) 
indicate the numerous domains predicted to have a surface 
location and potential for antibody induction. The thin 
vertical lines (A -M ) illustrate that many of the antigenic 
residues of E oM P-6  arc shared by SVMPs of related vipers

and that antibodies raised by E oM P -6  DNA immunisation 
are likely to possess considerable cross-reactivity. As 
expected the antigenic profile of E oM P -6  was very similar 
to that of Ecarin and, to a lesser extent, to Ecb-I and Ech-II 
from E. p. leakeyi venom. The latter viper is a phylogen- 
etically close relative of E. ocella tus (Lenk et al., 2001) with 
an East African distribution. Line D corresponded to the 
catalytic site (position 234-246, Fig. 2) and appeared to be 
highly immunogenic in all the SVMPs. Line H corre
sponded to the DCD motif in the cysteine rich domain 
(position 368-370, Fig. 2). Line K  (position 373-378) 
corresponded to the platelet-inhibitoiy VK C  domain of 
fararhagin (Kamiguti et al., 2003). It is tempting to predict 
toat antibodies generated against clinically significant 
domains in E o M P -6  might competitively inhibit the 
function of these domains in venom toxins of related vipers. 
The binding of antibodies to the other antigenically 
conserved domains without an ascribed function are 
also predicted to disrupt protein function by steric 
hindrance. The veracity of these speculations need to be
confirmed experimentally; a focus of our current activity. 
Furthermore, the truncated peptide sequence 
(KTLDSFGEWR) derived from a purified haemorrhagic 
fraction of E. ocella tus venom (Howes et al., 2003) differed 
from that E oM P -6  (DTLHSFGEWR, position 167-176, 
Fig. 2). Together, these studies suggest a multimeric 
composition of E. ocella tus SVMPs and indicate the need 
for a more global analysis of the E. ocella tus venom gland 
transcriptome.
In conclusion, we have isolated for the first time, cDNA 
encoding a prothrombin-activating metalloproteinase of 
clinical importance from venom glands of E. ocellatus. 
The high degree of sequence conservation of E oM P -6  with 
other prothrombin-activating and haemorrhagic metallopro
teinases of related vipers extended to the conservation of 
structural domains predicted to have high immunogenic 
potential. These observations lead us to speculate that 
antibodies generated to these domains may have clinical 
potential in the treatment of E. ocella tus envenoming. Also, 
since SVMPs show a high degree of sequence and structural

Abstract
Venom toxin-specific antibodies offer a more rational treatment of snake envenoming than conventional antivenom. Here, we 
describe novel cDNAs encoding phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) isoforms from venom gland RNA of Echis pyramidum leakeyi (Epl), 
Echis sochureki (Es) and Echis ocellatus (Eo). The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNAs encoded proteins with high 
overall sequence identity to the viper group 11 PLA2 protein family, including the 14 cysteine residues capable of forming seven 
disulphide bonds that characterize this group of PLA2 enzymes. Comparison of the PLA2 sequences from Echis with those from 
related vipers failed to make significant geographic, taxonomic or PLA2-function distinctions between these Echis PLA2 
isoforms. However, their deduced hydrophilicity profiles revealed a conserved tertiary structure that we w ill exploit, by 
epidermal DNA immunization, to generate PLA2-neutralizing antibodies with polyspecific potential.

1. Introduction
The Echis genus of carpet vipers constitutes one of the 
most medically important groups of snakes and is 
responsible for the majority of snakebite deaths and 
morbidity across Africa and the Indian subcontinent 
(Warrell and Arnett, 1976). The extreme haemorrhagic 
and coagulopathic manifestations of Echis envenoming are 
effected by zinc metalloproteinases that cause bleeding by 
degradation of the vascukir subendothelium and a variety of 
other toxins that operate in distinct ways to prevent blood 
from clotting (e.g. disinlegrins, prothrombin activators and 
factor IX/X activators; (Kamiguti ct al 1998)). It is well 
established that group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes 
in venoms of related vipers in Asia, Europe, the Middle l :e t 
and the Americas conti ute to venom-induced patholo1 > 
through a broad spectrum of toxic activities, including

neurotoxicity (Habermann and Breithaupt, 1978), oedema- 
inducing activity (Vishwanath et al., 1987), anticoagulant 
activity (Boffa ct a., 1976), haemorrhagic activity (Vish
wanath et al., 1985; Yamaguchi et al., 2001) and activities 
that cause initiation or inhibition of platelet aggregation 
(Kini and Evans, 1990).
Comparatively little is known about the contribution of 
PLA2 activity to the pathology of Echis viper envenoming. 
Kemparaju et al. (1994) isolated a 14 kDa basic (pi 7.2-7.6) 
PLA2 (EC-IV-PLA2 ) from Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis 
carinatus) venom that produced neurotoxicity and oedema 
in mice but had no direct haemolytic, myotoxic, cytotoxic or 
anticoagulant activities. Kemparaju et al. (1999) isolated a 
16 kDa acidic (pi 4.2-4.8) PLA2 (EC-I-PLA2) from 
E. carinatus venom that was non-lethal to mice and devoid 
of neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, anticoagulant activity and 
cytotoxicity, but induced mild oedema in the foot-pads of 
mice. The purified PLA2 inhibited ADP, collagen and 
adrenaline-induced aggregation of human platelets, that was 
both dose and time-dependent. Desmond el al. (1991)

16 kDa PLA2s (Eel and Ec2) from the venom of Kenyan 
Echis pyamidum leakeyi that exhibited sequence similarity 
with other toxic PLA2's, but their role in the toxicity of the 
venom was not established. Polgar et al. ( 1996) purified and 
characterized an enzymatically active Ser-49 basic (pi 7.9) 
PLA2, Ecarpholin S, from the venom of Echis sochureki. A 
PLA2 complexed with another venom protein has been 
purified and crystallized from Indian E. carinatus venom 
(Nagpal et al., 1999). Only two Echis PLA2 DNA sequences 
have been submitted to the genetic databases (E. coloratus 
AF253049/50; direct submission; Kordis, 2001).
A major research initiative of our laboratory is to 
generate venom toxin-specific antibodies by DNA immu
nization, as a means of developing rational immunother
apy (Harrison et al., 2000, 2002), particularly for vipers of 
greatest medical importance in Africa. We have included 
PLA2s in this strategy, despite the paucity of data on their 
clinical importance in Echis envenoming, because it 
seemed imprudent to ignore a group of bioactive 
molecules with potential to disrupt haemostasis at several 
distinct levels and that comprise between 6 and 13% of 
the total venom protein of . p. leakeyi (Desmond et al., 
1991). Here, we report the isolation of three novel PLA2- 
encoding cDNAs from E chis species with distinct 
residential boundaries in West Africa (Echis ocellatus), 
East Africa (E. p. leakeyi) and the Indian subcontinent (. 
sochureki). The conserved secondary structure of all the 
PLA2 isomers, across species and genus boundaries, 
augers well for the generation of neutralizing antibody 
with polyspecific cover.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals, vector and  cells
Adult carpet vipers, E. p. leakeyi (Kenya), E. sochureki 
(Pakistan) and E. ocellatus (Nigeria) used in this study were 
maintained in the herpetarium, Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine, Liverpool, UK. The TA  cloning vector (pCR 2.1- 
TOPO) and chemically competent E. coli cells (TOP 10F') 
were purchased from Invitrogen, Groningen, The Nether
lands.
2.2. Isolation o f  total RNA and construction o f  cDNA library
Venom glands were dissected from three sacrificed 
snakes of each species (three days after venom extraction), 
homogenized under liquid N2 and total RNA extracted using 
guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (Chomc- 
zynski and Sacchi, 1987) following standard protocols 
(Sambrook et al., 1989). Lambda phage cDNA libraries for 
the snakes were constructed by RT-PCR using the SMART 
cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH, CA, USA)
and Gigapack III Gold Packaging Extract (Stratagene, CA, 
USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.
2.3. Isolation and  analysis o f  PLA2 toxin cD N As
A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) strategy (Israel,
1993) was used to screen the cDNA libraries. A sense 
primer (5 '-G G A-TCC-ATG -AG G -ACT-CTC-TG G -ATA - 
3') and an antisense primer (5 '-CTC -G A G -TCA -TCA - 
G C A -riT -C TC -TG A -C TC -C TC -3 ') complimentary to 
highly conserved amino (M -R -T-L-W -I) and carboxyl 
(E-E-S-E-K -C) regions of published group II PLA2 DNA 
sequences of related viper species were designed and 
synthesized (Sigma-Genosys Ltd, UK). Two stop codons 
(TGA) and restriction endonuclease sites for Bam  H I and 
X ho  1 were included in the 5' and 3'-primers, 
respectively, to facilitate future subcloning into mamma
lian expression plasmids.
PCR was performed using a thermal cycler (Gene 
Cycler, BioRad Hercules, CA, USA) programmed for an 
initial denaturation (95 C X 6 min) and annealing 
(55 C X 1 min) step, followed by 35 cycles (1 min 
duration each) of extension (74 C), denaturation (94 C) 
and annealing (55 C). A final extension step (7 min) at 
72 C was also included in the program to ensure that all 
the products were double stranded. The PCR-amplified 
products were subcloned into the TA  cloning vector, pCR 
2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and used to transform chemically 
competent E. coli cells (TOP 10F') under ampicillin 
selection, following the manufacturers instructions. 
Plasmid DNA was extracted using a commercially 
available kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and digested 
with Bam  H I and Xho  1 at 37 C to select plasmid 
containing inserts of the predicted size for DNA 
sequencing. DNA sequencing was carried out by the 
dideoxy-nucleotide chain-termination method (Sanger 
et al., 1977) in a Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000 XL 
DNA Analysis System. The predicated amino acid 
sequences were compared to sequences in the GenBank, 
PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF databases. using the 
BLAST program (Altschul et al., 1997).
The amino acid sequences of the three E chis cDNAs 
were aligned to PLA2 isoform sequences from related 
Viperidae species: . coloratus (AF253049), Vipera ammo- 
dytes (AF253048), V. palaestinae (U60017), Trim eresurus 
fla v o v ir id is  (D10720), C alloselasm a  rhodostom a  
(AF104067), Bothrops asper (AF109911), B. jararacussu  
(X76289) and Crotalus atrox  (AF269131) using Lasergene 
software (DNASTAR, Madison, USA) and a phylogenetic 
tree constructed for the latter sequences and for peptide 
sequences of native PLA2 from E. p. leakeyi (EplPLA2-Ecl, 
(Desmond et al., 1991)) and E. sochureki (Ecarpholin S, 
P48650) using the CLUSTAL W program (Thompson et al.,
1994) with PAM 250 residue weight matrix. The predicted 
isoelectric point of each PLA2 isoform examined here was

determined using Lasergene software (Protean, DNAS- 
TAR).
3. Results and discussion
PCR amplification of E. p. leakeyi, E. sochureki and E. 
ocellatus venom gland libraries produced several cDNA 
sequences for each species (designated Epl, Es or Eo, 
respectively) that were identified (BLAST) as belonging to 
the PLA2 enzyme family. Here, we show that single cDNA 
sequences for each snake species EplPLA2-5, (Genbank 
submission-AF539920), EsPLA2-4, (Genbank submission- 
AF539919) and EoPLA2-5 (Genbank submission 
AF539921) were highly similar at the DNA and predicted 
amino acid levels (Fig. la and b). EplPLA2-5 and EsPLA2-4 
(417 nucleotides) encoded an open reading frame of 139 
amino acids (15.9 kDa) and EoPLA2-5 (414 nucleotides) 
encoded a protein of 138 amino acids (15.7 kDa). Consistent 
with the secretory nature of venom PLA2 proteins, the 
initiating 16 amino acid residues of all three Echis PLA2 
cDNAs encoded a conserved signal peptide domain
(hatched arrow). The location of the less-conserved antic
oagulant domain identified by Kini and Evans (1987) lies 
between residues 68-83 (solid arrow). Despite the geo
graphical separation of E. p. leakeyi and E. sochureki 
species, the predicted amino acid sequences of EplPLA2-5 
and EsPLA2-4 show only two amino acid substitutions, the 
first within the signal peptide domain at position 12 
(EplPLA2-5:Met; EsPLA2-4:Val) and the second at position 
62 (EplPLA2-5:Met; EsPLA2-4:Leu). These amino acid 
substitutions are, however, unlikely to affect the tertiary 
structure because the positions of the 14 cysteine residues 
are completely conserved in both molecules and likely 
reflect a common lineage (Moura-da-Silva et al., 1995).
The predicted amino acid sequences encoded by 
EplPLA2-5, EsPLA2-4 and EoPLA2-5 were aligned with 
the PLA2 sequences of vipers showing the highest similarity 
(Fig. 2a) during the BLAST search. The near-identical 
EplPLA2-5 and EsPLA2-4 showed a high percentage 
sequence identity with PLA2 sequences from E. coloralus 
(72%; 71%) V. palaeslinae (71%; 70%), V. ammodytes 
(69%; 69%), T. flavoviridis (60%; 61%), B. jararacussu  
(60%; 61%) and C. rhodostoma (58%; 59%). A phyloge

native PLA2 from E. p. leakeyi (EplPLA2-Ecl, (Desmond 
et al., 1991) and E. sochureki (Ecarpholin S, P48650) was 
constructed (Fig. 2b) using the CLUSTAL W program with 
PAM250 residue weight matrix. The amino acid sequence 
of EplPLA2-5 cDNA matched with near identity (Fig. 2b) to 
the sequence of a native PLA2 from E. p. leakeyi venom 
(EplPLA2-Ecl) suggesting a direct genomic relationship. In 
contrast, the predicted amino acid sequence of EsPLA2-4
showed only 42% identity (Fig. 2b) to the peptide sequence 
of a native PLA2, Ecarpholin S from E. sochureki (Polgar 
ct al., 1996). This clearly indicates that EsPLA2-4 encodes a 
distinct E. sochureki PLA2 isoform. The amino acid 
sequence encoded by EoPLA2-5 showed comparatively 
lower overall identity to viper PLA 2 isoforms than 
EplPLA2-5 and EsPLA2-4: B. jararacussu (65%), C. alrox

In an effort to assign potential functional attributes to 
EplPLA2-5, EsPLA2-4 and EoPLA2-5, their deduced amino 
acid sequences were examined (i) for the expression of 
lysine or aspartate residue at position 64 (49 in sequences 
lacking the signal peptide) known to confer calcium- 
mediated catalytic activity, (ii) for the number of lysine 
residues within the anticoagulant domain and (iii) to identify 
sequences with a basic isoelectric point (pi). The latter two 
attributes have been correlated with anticoagulant activity of 
native PLA2 enzymes (Kini and Evans, 1987). A ll the viper 
PLA2 isoforms examined here, including EplPLA2-5, 
EsPLA2-4, EoPLA2-5, expressed an aspartate residue at 
position 64 (with the exception of B. asper, lysine) 
indicating that they all possessed catalytic potential. Only 
B. asper PLA2 isoform contained more than one lysine 
residue in the anticoagulant domain (Fig. 2a). Only the 
PLA2 isoforms from B. asper, B. ja ra ra cu ssu , and 
Ecarpholin S from E. sochureki showed a basic pi 
(Fig. 2b). These indications suggest that EplPLA2-5, 
EsPLA2-4 and EoPLA2-5 encode PLA2 isoforms with little, 
if any, anticoagulant activity. These observations illustrate 
the problems of using cDNA-derived amino acid sequence 
data to predict functional characteristics of proteins that 
exist as multiple isoforms, each with the potential to effect 
distinct functions. Current research is focused on linking 
sequence data for the existing (and remaining) PLA2 cDNAs 
extracted from E. p. leakeyi, E. sochureki and E. ocellatus to 
isoforms recovered from two dimensional gel electrophor
esis of whole venom.
The diverse functional capabilities of PLA2 isoforms 
whose amino acid sequences differ only slightly does not, 
however, have a negative impact on the achievement of our 
objectives the development of toxin-neutralizing anti
bodies by DNA immunization. The deduced primary 
structures of EplPLA2-5, EsPLA2-4 and EoPLA2-5 include 
the requisite, highly conserved, 14 cysteine residues that 
form the seven disulphide bonds responsible for the 
characteristic tertiary structure of group II PLA2. It is 
therefore predicted that, transfection of mammalian cells 
with PLA2-encoding DNA is likely to present to the immune 
system molecules that faithfully represent native venom 
PLA2. The hydrophilic profile (Fig. 3) (Kyte and Doolittle, 
1982) of all the PLA2 molecules showed remarkable 
conservation, irrespective of their geographical distribution, 
pi, taxonomic designation and toxicity. The predicted 
Jameson-Wolf antigenic profiles (DNASTAR, USA) of 
these PLA2 isoforms aligned with near identity to the Kyte- 
Doolittle hydrophilic profile plots (data not shown). This 
observation strongly suggests that an antibody developed to 
an amino acid domain that (i) has a high antigenic index and 
(ii) is conserved across snake species has potential for viper 
polyspecific neutralization of viper venom PLA2 pathology.

Abstract
Envenoming by Echis saw scaled vipers and Bids arietans puff adders is die leading cause of death and morbidity in Africa due to snake 
bite. Despite their medical importance, die composition and constituent functionality of venoms from these vipers remains poorly understood. 
Here, we report the cloning of cDNA sequences encoding seven clusters or isoforms of the haemostasis-disruptive C-type lectin (CTL) 
proteins from the venom glands of Echis ocellatus, E. pyramidum leakeyl, E. carinatus sochurela and B. arietans. All these CTL sequences 
encoded the cysteine scaffold that defines die carbohydrate-recognition domain of mammalian CTLs. All but one of the Echis and Bitis CTL 
sequences showed greater sequence similarity to the 3 than a CTL subunits in venoms of related Asian and American vipers. Four of the new 
CTL clusters showed marked inter-cluster sequence conservation across all four viper species which were significantly different from that of 
previously published viper CTLs. The other three Echis and Bitis CTL clusters showed varying degrees of sequence similarity to published 
viper venom CTLs. Because viper venom CTLs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity and yet exert profoundly different effects on die 
mammalian haemostatic system, no attempt was made to assign functionality to the new Echis and Bitis CTLs on the basis of sequence alone. 
The extraordinary level of inter-specific and inter-generic sequence conservation exhibited by the Echis and Bitis CTLs leads us to speculate 
that antibodies to representative molecules should neutralise the biological function of this important group of venom toxins in vipers that are 
distributed throughout Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

1. Introduction
Snake bites cause over 20,000 deaths annually in Africa 
(Chippaux, 2002). The majority of these deaths result from 
systemic envenoming by Echis ocellatus (West Africa), E. 
pyram idum  leakeyi (East Africa) saw scaled vipers and Bitis 
arietans puff adders (pan-African distribution). Survivors of 
envenoming also suffer long-term disability, scarring and 
occasionally amputation as a consequence of local venom- 
induced damage to tissues extending from the bite site 
(Warrell, 1996). Despite their medical importance, there has

been surprisingly little research performed on the composi
tion and constituent functionality o f venoms from these 
snakes. The systemic and local pathological effects of ven
oms from the African Echis and Bitis vipers show many 
parallels with venoms from Asian and American pit vipers. 
The extensive literature on the latter vipers indicates that of 
the 100 or more constituents of viper venoms, a relatively 
small number of venom toxins are responsible for th 
pathological effects of envenoming. A group of zinc-con
taining metalloproteinases degrade the vascular subendothe
lium to cause haemorrhage and, by virtue of a carboxyl 
disintegrin-like domain, interfere with die aggregation of 
platelets that would normally serve to repair the damage 
and thereby arrest bleeding (Kamiguti et al., 1996; Bjamason 
and Fox, 1994). Similar metalloproteinases with prothrom
bin- and factor X-activating effects (Nishida et al., 1995) and 
thrombin-like serine proteases (Pirkle and Theodor, 1990) 
promote consumptive coagulation (Hutton and Warrell, 
1993). This venom arsenal is reinforced by other toxins,

including RGD-containing disintegrins, phospholipases A2 
(PLA2) and C-type lectin (CTL) proteins (Markland, 1998) 
that prevent blood clotting by interference with platelet 
aggregation and distinct elements of the coagulation cascade.
One of our main research objectives is to develop toxin- 
specific antivenom to treat envenoming by the African 
Echis and B id s  vipers. This requires a more complete 
definition of the venom proteome of these vipers. We and 
others have previously cloned sequences encoding venom 
haemorrhagic (Paine et al., 1994) and prothrombin-activat
ing (Nishida et al., 1995; Yamada et al., 1996) zinc metal- 
loproteinases of E.p. leakeyi. These cDNAs exhibited high 
sequence similarity to analogous molecules in related Asian 
and American vipers. More recently, we isolated cDNAs 
encoding PLA2 enzymes of E. ocellatus, E.p. leakeyi and 
E.c. sochureki and demonstrated that they also showed a 
high level of sequence conservation (Bharati et al., in press).
Here we report the cloning of E. ocellatus, E.p. leakeyi, 
E.c. sochureki and B. arietans cDNAs (termed Eo, Epl, Es 
and Ba, respectively) that encode several isoforms of the 
CTL proteins. In venoms of related vipers, these venom 
toxins exert a variety of haemostasis-disruptive functions 
including binding the IX and X coagulation factors to inhibit 
the clotting cascade and agonistic and antagonistic effects 
on platelet aggregation (Wisner et al., 2002). E.c. sochureki 
(Indian subcontinent) was included to evaluate whether the 
sequence conservation of viper venom toxins would extend 
to the phylogenetically close but geographically distant 
Asian viper. The Echis and B ids viper CTL cDNAs isolated 
here showed considerable sequence identity with each other 
and to analogues of related vipers, including retention of 
specific amino acid substitutions used to distinguish CTL 
isomers.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Adult E.p. leakeyi (Kenya), E.c. sochureki (Pakistan) and 
E. ocellatus (Nigeria) carpet vipers and B. arietans puff 
adders (Ghana and Saudi Arabia) used in this study were 
maintained in the herpetarium, Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine, Liverpool, UK.
2.2. Extraction o f  to ta l venom g lan d RNA and construction  
o f  cDNA libraries
Venom glands were dissected from three snakes of each 
Echis species and from two B. arietans snakes. The vipers 
were sacrificed 3 days after venom extraction when toxin 
gene transcription rates are at a peak. Glands were homog
enized under liquid N2 and total RNA extracted using 
guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform as described 
previously (Bharati et al., in press). Lambda phage cDNA 
libraries for E. sochureki, E. ocellatus and B. arietans were
constructed by RT-PCR using the SMART cDNA library 
construction kit (Clontech, California, USA). The lambda 
Zapll vector was used to construct the E.p. leakeyi cDNA 
library (Stratagene, California, USA). The lambda phage of 
the four snake species was packaged using Gigapack 111 Gold 
Packaging Extract (Stratagene) and boiled for 5 min prior to 
being used as targets of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
amplification.
2.3. Isolation an d analysts o f  cDNA sequences
A PCR strategy was used to isolate sequences encoding 
CTLs from the cDNA libraries. A sense primer (5'-GGA- 
TCC-ATG-GGG-CGA-TTC-ATC-TTC-3') and an anti- 
sense primer (5'-CTC-GAG-CTA-TGC-CGG-GCT-CTT- 
GCA-GAC-GAA-3') complimentary to highly conserved 
amino-terminal signal peptide (M-G-R-F-l-F) and to the 
less conserved carboxy-terminal (F-V-C-K-S-P-A) domains 
of published CTL DNA sequences of related viper species 
were synthesized commercially (Sigma-Genosys, UK). A 
TAG stop codon was inserted in die 3' primer and B am R l 
and X h o\ restriction endonuclease sites (bold) were includ
ed in the 5' and 3' primers, respectively, to facilitate future 
subcloning.
PCR was performed using an initial denaturation (95 
Cx6 min) and annealing (55 Cx 1 min) step, followed by 
35 cycles (1 min each) of extension (74 C), denaturation 
(94 C) and annealing (55 C) and a terminal extension step 
(7 min) at 72 C in a thermal cycler (Gene Cycler, BioRad, 
Hercules, CA, USA). The inclusion of water-only controls 
with each PCR reaction allowed us to monitor and prevent 
cross-over contamination. The amplicons were subcloned 
into the TA cloning vector, pCR 2.1-TOPO, (lnvitrogen, 
Groningen, The Netherlands) and used to transform chem
ically competent E. coli cells (TOP10F, lnvitrogen) under 
ampicillin selection. Plasmid DNA was extracted (Mini-spin 
prep kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and digested with 
B am H l and X h o \ at 37 C to select plasmids containing 
inserts of the predicted size for DNA sequencing.
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy-nucle- 
otide chain-termination method in a Beckman Coulter 
CEQ 2000 XL DNA Analysis System. To confirm that 
the cDNA sequences encoded CTLs, the predicted amino 
acid sequences were subjected to BLAST searches of the 
GenBank, PDB, SwissProt, P1R and PRF databases. All the 
cDNAs exhibited significant sequence homology to CTLs 
of related vipers. The CLUSTAL W program (Thompson et 
al., 1994) with PAM 250 residue weight matrix was used to 
align deduced amino acid sequences representing each 
Echis spp and B. arietans CTL isoform with analogues in 
venoms from related Viperidae species: ECLV 1X/X bp (J 
(AAB36402) from E. leucogaster (Chen and Tsai, 1996), 
Echicetin |i (P81996) from E. carinatus (Peng et al., 1994), 
Bitiscetin a  (JC5058) and (3 (JC5059) subunits from B. 
arietans (Matsui et al., 1997), CHH-B a  (P81508) and [i

(Andrews et. al., 1996), Convulxin (3 (CAA76182) from C. 
durissus terrificus (Leduc and Bon, 1998), Alboaggregin a  
subunit 4 (P81114) from Trimere.iurus albolabris (Kowalska 
et al., 1998), a  (D83331) and (i (D83332) 1X/X bp subunits 
from Protobothrops flavoviridis (Matsuzaki et al., 1996), 
Flavocetin-A f3 subunit (AAN 72437) also from P. flavovir- 
idis (Shin et al., 2000), Aggretin (JC7105) from Callose- 
lasma rhodostoma (Chung etal., 1999), a  (AF176420) and (> 
(BAB20441) subunits from Deinagki.itrodon acutus (direct 
submissions) and, finally, a  (AF190827) and (i (AF197915) 
subunits from Gloydius halys (direct submissions). The 
phylogenetic trees constructed from the above alignments 
were generated by a neighbour-joining (Saitou and Nei, 
1987) algorithm in Lasergene software (DNASTAR, USA). 
The predicted antigenic profile (Jameson and Wolf, 1988) of 
the published and new Echis and B. arietans CTL isoforms 
analysed here was determined using Protean software 
(DNASTAR).
3. Results
3.1. Isolation o f  cDNAs encoding E.p. leakeyi, E.c. 
sochureki, E. ocellatus and B. arietans CTLs
PCR screening of the Echis spp and B. arietans venom 
gland cDNA libraries resulted in a total of 11 E.p. leakeyi
(Epl), 14 E.c. sochureki (Es), 9 E. ocellatus (Eo) and 11 B. 
arietans (Ba) cDNAs whose sequences matched (BLAST 
searches) those of published CTLs. Where two or more 
identical sequences were obtained from any one of these 
libraries, a single representative cDNA was used for sub
sequent analysis. The cDNAs consisted o f 441-447 
nucleotides (data not shown) and were predicted to encode 
open reading frame proteins of 147-149 amino acids 
(16.9-17.5 kDa). Accession numbers assigned to the new 
Echis and B. arietans CTL sequences are as follows: Es 
CTL-l (AY254331), Es CTL-3 (AY254332), Es CTL- 
8 (AY254334), Es CTL-9 (AY254336), Epl CTL-l 
(AY254337), Epl CTL-4 (AY254338), Epl CTL-5 
(AY254339), Epl C TL-l (AY254340), Eo CTL-l 
(AY254330), Eo CTL-2 (AY254333), Eo CTL-21 
(AY254335), Ba CTL-l (AY254325), Ba CTL-2 
(AY254326), Ba CTL-5 (AY254327), Ba CTL-6 
(AY254328) and Ba CTL-S (AY254329).

rise the 16 CTL sequences into seven distinct clusters, based 
solely on sequence alignment Cluster 1 contained Es CTL- 
8 and E pl CTL-A which were 98.1% identical (differing by 
three residues) and, had they not contained a distinct carbox
yl-terminus, would have retained this level of sequence 
identity to sequences in cluster 3. Cluster 2 was represented 
by a single cDNA, Es CTL-3, which did not contain the 
methionine start codon and its amino terminal sequence 
differed markedly from the signal peptide sequence (residues 
1-23) conserved in most of the other cDNAs. Intriguingly, 
Eo CTL-21 had a similar amino terminal sequence to Es CTL- 
3 but the down stream sequence encoded a distinct mature 
protein. The distinct 5' sequence composition of Es CTL-3 
and Eo CTL-21 was not considered the result of cloning 
artefacts since four other Es CTL cDNAs were found with 
identical sequences.
Immediately downstream of the signal peptide domain, 
the sequences within each CTL cluster showed a remarkable 
degree of sequence conservation in most of die viper species 
examined. For instance, cluster 3 was represented in all four 
viper species by E pl C T L -l, Ba CTL-8, E s CTL-1 and Eo  
C T L -2 , which were completely identical. Cluster 4 
contained Eo C T L -l and B a CTL-6 that were 98.7% 
identical and contained identical substitutions of nine resi
dues evenly distributed along the length of the sequence. 
Cluster 5 contained representatives from three o f the four 
viper species, E pl C T L -l, Eo CTL-21 and Ba CTL-2, that 
showed a comparatively low sequence similarity of between 
75% and 84%. Cluster 6 also contained representatives from 
three of the four viper species: E s CTL-9, E p l CTL-5 (100% 
sequence identity) and Ba CTL-l (96.8%). The sequences in 
this group were less than 60% similar to those in the above 
groups. Cluster 7 contained a single representative se
quence, Ba CTL-5, that showed less than 50% sequence 
similarity to all the preceding cDNAs.
The deduced amino acid sequences of the Echis spp 
and B. arietans CTLs possessed the cysteine scaffold that 
defines the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 
mammalian CTLs (Drickamer, 1988) that bind sugars in 
a Ca2+-dependent manner. Disulphide bridges formed 
between C27 and C38, C55 and C144 and between 
C122 and C136 (arrows in Fig. 1) were conserved in all 
the Echis spp and B. arietans CTL sequences, except in 
those of cluster 1 where the carboxyl cysteine residues 
were both substituted with leucine residues. The CRD- 
invariant residues W31, W48, W90-X-G92, W104-X-X- 
G107 and W131 (Wisner et al., 2002) were all represented 
in the Echis and B. arietans CTL clusters, except cluster 1 
which showed an L for W substitution at position 131. In 
contrast to the conserved mammalian CRD sequences, all 
the above viper venom CTL clusters showed a G for W 
substitution at position 92 and an L for P substitution at 
position 110, except cluster 7 which had a V at position 
110. Also, the viper sequences did not contain the E-P-N 
and Q-P-D triplets associated with CRD binding by 
mammalian CTLs to mannose and galactose, respectively. 
The Echis and B itis CTL sequences appeared incapable of 
binding calcium, a feature common to venom CTLs that 
bind to coagulation factors IX and X (Atoda et al., 2002). 
Thus, unlike CTL subunits o f P. flavov irid is  (Shin et al., 
2000) and E. leucogaster (Atoda et al., 2002) that contain 
the requisite S-66, E-68, E-72 and E-146 for calcium 
binding (Mizuno et al., 1997), all the Echis and Bitis CTL 
clusters, except cluster 7, showed an H for E-68 and an S 
for E-146 substitution. Cluster 1 sequences, however, 
retained the E-146 residue.

Viper venom CTL sequences in the genetic databases were 
compared with the Echis spp and B. arietans CTL clusters 
(Fig. 3) by BLAST. Clusters 1-4 represent novel, highly 
similar, CTL isomers with less than 65% sequence similarity 
to analogues in related viper species. Phylogenetic tree 
analysis showed that clusters 1 -4  were most closely associ
ated with (i-subunit CTLs (Fig. 4). Cluster 5 was assigned to 
the same clade as the (i-subunit of echicetin from E. carinatus 
and generally was aligned with other CTL (i-subunits. Cluster 
6 showed the greatest sequence similarity (62%) to the CTL 
(i-subunit of the West African E. leucogaster viper. Of all the

highest sequence similarity (59%) to the a-subunit of the Xa- 
binding CTL of the Asian G. halys viper. None of the clusters 
showed more than 50% sequence similarity (data not shown) 
to the partial peptide sequences for the a- and [i-subunits of 
the EM 16, a CTL purified from the venom of the Asian E. 
multisquamatus viper (Marcinkiewicz et al., 2000). Similarly, 
the a- and (i-subunits of bitiscetin from B. arietans venom 
showed no greater than 42% sequence similarity to any of the 
Echis spp or B arietans CTL sequences.
3.4. Predicted antigenic profiles o f the E.p. leakeyi. E.c. 
sochureki, E. ocellatus and B. arietans CTL clusters
Since the main focus of our research is to develop toxin- 
neutralising antibodies by immunisation with DNA encoding 
specific toxins in venoms of the most medically important 
African vipers (Harrison et al., 2000, 2002), we next com
pared the algorithm-predicted immunogenicity of the Echis 
spp and B. arietans CTL cluster cDN A sequences with those 
of all the published CTLs from vipers of African origin (Fig. 
5). The deduced signal peptide domains of the Echis spp and 
B. arietans CTL were not represented here because they 
would be cleaved from the native proteins. The thin vertical 
lines are a subjective identification of the most immunogenic 
CTL domains that show the greatest phylogenetic conserva
tion. Line (a) approximately corresponded to the residues C- 
Y-K. (38-40; Fig. 3) and was common to clusters 1-5. The 
highly conserved domain between residues 48 and 55 (W-A- 
D-A-E-K.-F-C) was not predicted to be immunogenic. Line 
(b) corresponded to the residues around H-L-V-S (63-66) 
and was common to clusters 1 -6  and the E. leucogaster CTL 
that bind coagulation factors 1X/X. Lines (c) (residues around 
C l36) and (d) (V-C-K. at positions 144-146) appeared to 
represent immunogenic domains common to all the new and 
published African viper venom CTL sequences.
4. Discussion
The Echis and Bids CTL sequences described here 
contained all the cysteine residues and most of the associ
ated amino acid motifs that define the CRD domain and 
overall architecture of the mammalian and viper CTL 
sequences (Drickamer, 1988). These results represent a 
significant addition to the venom gland transcriptome of 
the Echis saw scaled vipers and Bids arietans and reveal the 
CTL composition of these vipers to be as complex as that of 
the better characterised New World vipers (Wisner et al., 
2002). The latter review illustrates that viper venom CTLs 
possess a range of pharmacological functions that disrupt 
haemostasis by inhibiting platelet aggregation through in
teraction with several platelet receptors, including von 
Willebrand factor domains (e.g., Botrocetin; Bitiscetin), 
the glycoprotein receptors GPla (e.g., Aggretin), GPlb
R.A. Harrison el al. / Gene 315 (2003) 95-102 101
(e.g., Echicetin, Flavocetin, CHH-A and B) and GPV1 (e.g., 
Convulxin). Venom CTLs also activate the coagulation 
cascade through cleavage of factor X (e.g., RVV-X), factor 
IX (e.g., IX activator) and factor 11 (e.g., Carinactivase). 
Conversely, other venom CTLs inhibit coagulation by 
binding to factors IX and X (e.g., 1X/X binding proteins 
from venoms o f P. Jlavoviridis and E. leucogaster).
The Echis and B ids sequences grouped in CTL clusters 1 -  
4 appear to be distinct but highly similar CTL subunits that 
are novel to the serpents genetic database. In common with 
CTL (i-subunits of flavocetin-A and convulxin from venoms 
ofP. flavovirid is and C. d. terrificus, respectively (Shin et al., 
2000; Leduc and Bon, 1998), CTL clusters 1-4  contained a 
double cysteine motif at positions 26 and 27 that have been 
invoked to differentiate (i- from a-subunits of CTLs (Shin et 
al., 2000). The N-terminal additional C26 of (-CTL subunits 
is thought to form a disulphide bridge with a C-terminal 
cysteine residue of a-subunits permitting the polymerisation 
of these peptides into heterodimeric molecules (Wisner et al., 
2002). Although they lacked the additional C26 residue, the 
sequences in clusters 5 and 6 were also most closely associ
ated with (i-CTL subunits. Only Ba CTL-S (cluster 7) showed 
a closer sequence similarity to the a-CTL subunits. Since it 
was the only sequence in this cluster, we presume it to be a 
low copy gene. We infer from the absence of an initiating 
methionine and non-signal peptide-like N-terminal sequence 
of Es CTL-3 (cluster 3) and Eo CTL-T1 (cluster 5) that these 
sequences are derivatives from other genes, presumably the 
group IV metalloproteinases at either the carboxyl (Bjamason 
and Fox, 1994) or amino terminal ends (Kini, 1996). We 
could not, however, find sequences similar to these domains 
in group IV metalloproteinases or in venom CTL sequences 
known to be associated with group IV metalloproteinases. It 
is tempting to use the sequence similarity between the Echis 
and B ids CTL sequences and published venom CTLs of 
known biological activity to predict the functionality for the 
new CTL clusters. However, the sequence-function rela
tionship of venom CTLs (and many other venom toxins) is 
still insufficiently understood to confidently assign a function 
to a molecule based solely on sequence characteristics.
The extraordinary degree of CTL sequence conservation 
between the geographically distant E. ocellatus, E.p. lea- 
keyi, E.c. sochureU  and B. arietans vipers indicates the 
biological importance of the multimeric nature of this group 
of venom toxins. Here, and as frequently observed in the 
snake venom literature (Deshimaru et al., 1996), the DNA 
sequences encoding these Echis and B ids CTLs showed a 
higher level of sequence conservation than the deduced 
amino acid sequences (data not shown). Accelerated evolu
tion of snake venom toxins has been mooted to confer an 
evolutionary advantage by increasing the range of prey 
susceptible to envenoming. The identical inter-specific and 
inter-generic sequences for cluster 3 CTLs and near identity 
of sequences in other clusters suggest that accelerated 
venom toxin evolution is regulated by a sophisticated 
control mechanism, rather than a system that simply accepts
degenerative substitutions. While this is likely to be a 
fruitful area of research, it was not the purpose of this study.
Our objective was to evaluate die range of CTL molecules 
likely to be represented in venoms of E. ocellatus, E.p. 
leakeyi, E. sochureki and B. arietans vipers in order to guide 
the design of DNA-immunisation constructs required to 
generate toxin-neutralising antibodies. We have shown that 
DNA immunisation is an efficient means of generating 
specific antibodies with potent venom toxin-neutralising 
activity (Harrison et al., 2000, 2002) and that the toxin- 
specific antibodies exhibit immunological reactivity to ven
oms from a wide range of viper species (Harrison et al., 
2003). Our utilisation of a low-stringency PCR approach was 
successful in amplifying several distinct CTL isoforms from 
the venom glands of these vipers. The predicted antigenic 
profiles of the Echis and B ids CTLs illustrated in Fig. 5 
indicate that neutralisation of this complex group of toxins 
will require antibodies with several specificities. Thus, while 
an antibody raised by immunisation with cluster 3 DNA is 
likely to be effective against the gene products of clusters 2,3 
and 4, additional antibodies will be required to neutralise the 
other clusters. Also, because of the medical importance of 
echicetin (Peng et al., 1994) and bitiscetin (Hamako et al., 
1996), we have initiated experiments to isolate cDNAs 
encoding these molecules from the respective libraries. 
Therefore, to be confident of neutralising the function of this 
group of venom toxins, we speculate the requirement of 
between six and eight CTL antibody specificities. While this 
may seem excessive, our results indicate that such a panel of 
antibodies would neutralise this important group of function
ally diverse toxins in venoms of the most important African 
vipers across their geographic range. Given (i) the basal status 
of the Echis genus in viperine lineages (Lenk et al., 2001) and 
(ii) the high degree of inter-specific and inter-generic CTL 
sequence conservation observed here, it is possible that the 
venom CTL-neutralising effectiveness of such a panel of 
antibodies may extend to other African vipers and also to 
phylogenetically related vipers in Asia.
