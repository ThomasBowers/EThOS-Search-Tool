Abstract
The STEFF spectrometer was used at the Neutron Time-of-Flight facility (n ToF) at
CERN in 2016 to perform a 30-day long experimental campaign of measurements of
fission fragments and gamma rays produced in 235U fission for a wide range of incident
neutron energies. A pipeline for reading, correlating and database deposition of the ex-
perimental data from this experimental campaign as well as for future STEFF campaigns
at n ToF has been constructed. The pipeline resulted in 70-fold data size reduction to
an experimental database that can be fully processed in 7 hours.
The collected gamma-ray data acquired using NaI and LaBr3 detectors have been an-
alyzed in the <1 eV neutron energy range and compared to prior STEFF 235U fission
gamma-ray measurements. A method for correcting NaI signal amplitudes for n ToF-
specific effects, such as rates and pulse types, based on fission gamma-ray spectrum shape
has been developed. The correcting factors were the greatest for the dedicated proton
pulses at neutron energies of 0.06 eV, increasing signal amplitude by approximately
a factor of 2. Corrections to LaBr3 signals have also been considered and performed
based on count rates, with the the largest correcting factors reducing signal amplitude
by 15%. The corrected and calibrated energy spectra and calculated fold distributions
have been prepared for extraction of gamma-ray multiplicity, average energy and total
energy in thermal and epithermal fission of 235U.
An experiment was conducted at the Lohengrin mass spectrometer at Institut Laue-
Langevin, France, using a FiFI spectrometer for measurement of masses and atomic
numbers of selected 235U fission fragments. The details of the experiment and the
data analysis are presented, and a method for calibrating Bragg detectors for atomic
number extraction is proposed. The method is based on amplitudes, derivatives and
risetimes of signals produced by fission fragments in isobutane fill gas. The extracted
signal properties were used in conjunction with known fragment masses and energies
to produce functional forms based on powers of fragment velocities and average atomic
numbers. Furthermore, a comparison with simulations produced in SRIM-2013 was
performed, assessing the accuracy of the simulations.

Introduction
The process of nuclear fission has been studied in great detail since its first observation
in 1938 [1] and identification as a new reaction type in 1939 [2]. Studies of fission have
rapidly extended past purely scientific interest to include practical applications. The
great energy yield of nuclear fission was recognized, and the first nuclear reactor was built
in 1942, called Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) [3]. In 1954, the first commercial nuclear reactor
in Obninsk, Russia, was connected to the grid and produced electricity [4]. Currently
there are 440 nuclear reactors operating around the world producing around 10% of
the worlds electricity [5]. Moreover, a new generation of reactors, Generation IV, is
an active area of current research [6] with the aim of increasing reactor efficiency and
reducing waste production. Various reactor designs rely on different neutron energies
to maintain fission and produce energy. Of the six proposed reactor designs comprising
Generation IV, only two reactors operate in the thermal (0.025 eV) neutron energy
range [7], which is typical for the earlier reactor generations. Inside thermal-reactor
cores, fission neutrons, which are produced at MeV energies (referred to as fast neutrons),
require moderation to reduce their energy to the thermal range [8]. Fast neutron reactors,
on the other hand, do not require moderators, and therefore can be made more compact.
Furthermore, fast neutrons can induce fission in a considerably larger number of actinides
than thermal neutrons (more details on this are presented in the next chapter of this
work), thus broadening the range of useful nuclear fuels and reducing the amount of
long-lived actinide waste products (or even eliminating the pre-existing actinide waste)
[9]. These advantages result in prominence of the fast reactor designs in the upcoming
reactor generation, and subsequently the need for new nuclear data for fission induced
by neutrons at a wide energy range for a broad range of fissioning nuclei.
Nuclear data are compilations of information concerning nuclear structure and decays.
Various databases store experimental, simulated or theoretically calculated information
on nuclear species, reactions, emitted radiations, and particle interaction properties.
22 Introduction
Such databases require information inputs in order to address the current needs of
the nuclear industry, medicine and science. As data are added to the databases, they
undergo a process called evaluation, whereby the candidate results are compared to the
pre-existing database information and their merits inform how much the prior data are
adjusted to reflect the new results. The evaluation process begins with publication of
the data, which are then assessed by evaluators, who examine the methodology used for
producing the data, devise correction factors which may be required to compare the new
data with the pre-existing ones, investigate the uncertainties and then adjust the current
standards to reflect the decided contribution by the final corrected new data. Many
databases exist focusing on different data sources and information types, but of particular
interest to this work are the ENDF/B library [10] maintained by the National Nuclear
Data Center (NNDC) Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) formatted in
the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) format developed by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion (JEFF) library [11],
maintained by the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). ENDF/B librarys latest release is
ENDF/B-VIII.0 and the latest release of JEFF is JEFF-3.3.
Approximately 10% of the energy in a typical reactor core is released through gamma
rays which propagate out of the core and contribute to total heating [12]. Of the 10%
gamma ray energy release in the core, 40% is accounted for by prompt fission gamma
rays (PFG) [12], i.e. gamma rays emitted by fission fragments before they undergo
beta decay. For this reason NEA has issued a high priority request for information on
neutron-induced prompt fission gamma ray energy and multiplicity with a precision of
7.5%, as well as information on the gamma-ray spectrum shape in the energy range
of 0-10 MeV [13]. The required precision addressed by the NEA request has already
been achieved for fission gamma ray energy, total energy and multiplicity in 235U [14]
and 241Pu [15]. 235U is a nucleus of particular interest, since it is a common fuel for
reactors. Gamma ray multiplicities and energies have been measured for this particular
nucleus several times before, predominantly for thermal-neutron-induced fission, and the
results of these studies are presented in Table 1.1. While the results in Ref. [14] fulfil
the requirements of the NEA request, these results are also in considerable disagreement
with the previous measurements.

The Peelle et al. and Pleasonton et al. measurements are believed to have suffered
from an incomplete separation of prompt fission neutrons from the gamma-rays [18].
The measurement by Verbinski et al. was affected by complications in the spectrum
unfolding procedure, resulting in higher uncertainties. Oberstedt et al. measurements
were conducted using two LaBr3(Ce), two CeBr3 and one LaCl3(Ce) crystals performing
individual measurements, compared to all the the previous results which used NaI(Tl)
crystals. The use of detectors with faster timing and better energy resolution, coupled
with the overall agreement between three crystal types, leads to greater confidence in this
set of measurements, as reflected by its greater influence in the ENDF/B-VIII.0 release,
as opposed to its predecessor, the ENDF/B-VII.0 release [23]. Detector for Advanced
Neutron Capture Experiments (DANCE) collaboration work is the first set of published
PFG properties obtained by multiple gamma-ray detectors performing measurements
in coincidence, since DANCE array is composed of 140 BaF2 crystals. Due to the
complexity of the set-up, the results could be affected by improper unfolding, which was
the reason for the average gamma-ray energy not being reported. The 4 fissioning nuclide
measurements (235U, 239,241Pu and 252Cf) reported in the PFG campaign by DANCE
[19], resulted in 20% underestimation of multiplicity and subsequent 20% overestimation
of energy compared to the established data. A recent set of measurements have been
performed by H. Makii et al. [22] investigating high-energy part of the 235U gamma-
ray spectrum in thermal fission, and the results of this work are listed alongside the
previous works in Table 1.1, however they only apply for a gamma-ray energy cut of 1
MeV E 6 MeV. Within the confines of the high-energy gamma-ray cut, the results
by Makii et al. and Oberstedt et al. agree with each other, but not with Peele et al. or
Verbinski et al. The results of previous STEFF measurements listed in Table 1.1 are
24 Introduction
discussed in greater detail in Chapters 5 and 6 of this work.
As suggested above, one of the aims of the ongoing work with the SpecTrometer for
Exotic Fission Fragments (STEFF) is to address the discrepancies of the prior results
for gamma-ray data. Moreover, the latest STEFF measurements span beyond ther-
mal fission, an energy range where the majority of the prior measurements have been
conducted. Since Generation IV proposes three fast-neutron reactor designs [7] (and
a further design that can be constructed to operate in either thermal or fast mode),
further measurements of PFG produced in fission at neutron energies beyond thermal
would be beneficial to the nuclear industry as well as to fundamental fission studies.
STEFF is a two-energy two-velocity (2E2v) fission fragment spectrometer. It performs
parallel measurements of each of the two fission fragments produced in binary fission.
Moreover, STEFF provides gamma-ray information from an array of 12 scintillators, the
types of which varied between STEFF experiments. Two campaigns of fission product
measurements in 235U have been conducted in 2015 and 2016 at the Neutron Time-of-
Flight (n ToF) facility at CERN for a wide range of incident neutron energies. A further
STEFF experiment took place in 2018, aimed at measuring 239Pu fission properties. Due
to its broad neutron energy spectrum, the n ToF facility is suitable for measurements
needed to address the data needs at neutron energies above thermal, as well as for ad-
dressing the existing discrepancies in the thermal measurements. Prior to deployment
at n ToF, STEFF has been used at Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble in 2014
to perform measurements of exclusively thermal neutron-induced fission of 235U, and
the results of this measurement as well as prior results from STEFF measurements at
n ToF are shown in Table 1.1. There is an evident disagreement between the extracted
gamma-ray data for the two facilities, indicating the need for an investigation of STEFF
behaviour in the n ToF environment to ensure that detector response is understood.
Treatment of data resulting from STEFF measurements at n ToF in 2016 and a subse-
quent investigation of gamma-ray spectra measured at n ToF with reference to the work
performed at ILL [20] are addressed in this thesis with the aim of validating STEFF mea-
surements for future studies of fission of various fissioning nuclei at a range of incident
neutron energies.
A significant benefit of STEFF compared to prior measurements of fission gamma-rays
is the availability of correlated fission fragment mass and kinetic energy measurements.
In order to aid the analysis of STEFF data on fission fragments, characterization of a
Fission Fragment Identification (FiFI) chamber has been performed in 2016 at the Lo-
hengrin mass spectrometer at ILL. The characterization process is needed to help refine
techniques for Bragg detector data analysis, specifically fission fragment charge extrac-
tion, and provide information on the Bragg detector response to varying fragment masses

and charges. Fission fragment atomic number has been a difficult quantity to measure
throughout the history of fission studies, and would constitute a valuable observable
for STEFF measurements, and a possible method of addressing charge measurements is
discussed in this work based on the data measured at Lohengrin.
This work summarizes developments in the handling of data and analysis from the 2016
STEFF experimental run, as well as the process and the results of FiFI characterization.
Firstly, an introduction of some important characteristics of nuclear fission is provided
in Chapter 2. The structure of all the detectors used on STEFF with a particular focus
on gas-filled detectors is then described in Chapter 3. Details of the FiFI experiment
at ILL and the subsequent analysis are summarized next in Chapter 4. STEFF 235U
campaign details and data processing are addressed in Chapter 5 and the analysis of
the results is presented in Chapter 6. Concluding remarks and further STEFF work are
presented in Chapter 7.

Nuclear Fission
Nuclear fission is a process observed in a variety of nuclei ranging from 17878Pt [24] up
to 284114Fl [25], with theoretical investigations ongoing into even heavier exotic nuclei
produced in supernovae, such as calculations over a large range of nuclides spanning from
90Pt to
100Fm [26]. During fission, a nucleus splits into two or more nuclei, called fission
fragments. This process was first observed by O. Hahn and F. Strassman in 1938 [1],
when they bombarded uranium (Z=92) with neutrons, hoping to synthesize neptunium
(Z=93) via beta-decay of the compound nucleus, and identified barium (Z=56) in a
sample of uranium. The following year, L. Meitner and O.R. Frisch correctly interpreted
this observation as separation of a nucleus into two fragments and provided a description
of the process based on an analogy to a charged incompressible liquid drop [2]. Further
work on the Liquid Drop Model (LDM) of the fission process was published the same
year by N. Bohr and J. Wheeler [27].
2.1 Liquid Drop Model
The LDM description of a nucleus is based on C.F. von Weizsackers Semi-Empirical
Mass Formula (SEMF) [28], given in Equation (2.1). The formula describes the binding
energy Eb of a nucleus of mass A with proton number Z and neutron number N as [8]
Eb = avA asA
2/3  ac
(A 2Z)2
 (A,Z), (2.1)
28 Nuclear Fission
3/4 if Z and N are even,
apA3/4 if Z and N are odd,
0 if A is odd.
(2.2)
The SEMF features five terms multiplied by parameters ai, which are fitted based on
the experimental data. The first term is the volume term, which represents binding
within the volume of a nucleus. However, nucleons on the surface of a nucleus have
fewer neighbours binding them, therefore the volume term is reduced by the surface
term. The attractive force between nucleons is opposed by the Coulomb repulsion of the
protons. For this reason, binding is further reduced by the Coulomb term. However, a
nucleus with any number of neutrons will be bound according to the terms introduced
in the formula so far. The next term, the asymmetry term, is added to the formula
to account for that. This term arises from modeling the nucleus as a volume of Fermi
gas, rather than a liquid drop [29]. A state in a Fermi gas can be occupied by two
protons and two neutrons by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Therefore, by this model,
if there is a difference in the number of protons and neutrons, the excess particles will
occupy higher energy states, increasing the total energy. The last term is the pairing
term, which describes an increase in the binding energy observed in nuclei with paired
nucleons.
As the nucleus stretches during the fission process, changes in surface and Coulomb
terms dominate the other three parts of Equation 2.1 [30]. For an elliptically-stretched
nucleus with eccentricity , the deformation energy Edef is defined as
Edef () = Ec() + Es() Ec(0)  Es(0), (2.3)
where Ec and Es are surface and Coulomb energies. By considering only quadrupole
deformations in a multipole expansion of nuclear shape, and using substitutions
Es()  Es(0)
(2.4)
Ec()  Es(0)
, (2.5)
Nuclear Fission 29
for quadrupole term coefficient a20, Bohr andWheeler have defined the fissility parameter
Ec(0)
2Es(0)
. (2.6)
The fissility parameter describes the stability of a nucleus against fission and is pro-
portional to Z
/A, with x = 1 for Z
/A  50 [30]. Nuclei with x > 1 are predicted
to be unbound to increasing deformation leading to fission. Such nuclei would have
Z  120 [31], but no such nuclei have been observed to date. Spontaneous fission occurs
instead due to tunneling of fragments through the fission barrier. 235U, which is the
focus of this work, has x  0.36 [31], and 252Cf, a nucleus that undergoes spontaneous
fission  3% of the time [32], has x  0.76 [33], which is considerably lower than the
x = 1 recipe for spontaneous fission prescribed by LDM.
The fissility parameter inconsistencies with the behaviour of fissile nuclei show that
the LDM picture of fission is incomplete. The inconsistencies extend beyond fissility.
LDM predicts that all stable nuclei have spherical ground states, which contradicts
observations [30]. Moreover, equilibrium shapes above x > 0.39 in LDM are stable
against reflection-asymmetric distortions. This is also not the case, since actinide nuclei
fission predominantly asymmetrically (although symmetric fission becomes pronounced
in actinides for high excitation energies, such as for 14-MeV incident neutrons on 235U
in Ref. [34], and is the dominant fission mode for many nuclei lighter or heavier than
actinides, such as 210Po [35] or 258Rf [36]). LDM predicts a simple fission barrier with
a single maximum, however observation of fission isomer states [37], i.e. isomers with
unusually short half-lives for spontaneous fission [8], contradicts this prediction. The
isomeric states suggest additional structure in the fission barrier, not accounted for
in the LDM. These inaccurate predictions of the LDM are attributed to the models
collective nature, which ignores single-particle effects.
2.2 The Shell Correction Method
The nuclear shell model considers individual nucleons moving in a common potential,
comprised of a central spherical potential and a spin-orbit term [8]. The nucleons inside
the potential can occupy quantized states, called shells. The shell model was extended
to include deformed potentials by Nilsson [38], and Strutinsky [39] combined the in-
dependent particle approach with collective description of the LDM to form the Shell
Correction Method (SCM). Binding energies in the SCM are defined as
30 Nuclear Fission
Eb = ELDM + U + P, (2.7)
where
U = U  U = 2
En  2
Eg(E)dE (2.8)
P = P  P . (2.9)
The corrections are applied to the LDM binding energy ELDM . The effect of the correc-
tions for a typical actinide nucleus is shown in Figure 2.1. The U term is a correction
that accounts for shell structure. It is defined as the difference between the total energy
associated with all the occupied shells of a nucleus and a distribution of energy averaged
over a major shell. The shell model term is the sum of shell energies E times the
corresponding shell occupancy n . The uniform nucleus term is the integral over energy
of the uniform distribution g(E) from  up to a chemical potential , i.e. the energy
needed to remove a nucleon from the nucleus. P is the pairing term, P is the pairing
energy for nucleons near the Fermi surface (i.e. the most energetic occupied shell), and
P is the average pairing energy contained in the pairing term of the LDM [40]. The two
correction terms are summed separately for neutrons and protons.
The SCM approach correctly reproduces the shape of the observed fission double-humped
barrier, however it overestimates the height of both the initial deformation hump and the
fission potential for the fission isomer produced through deformation [30]. Nonetheless,
SCM provides insight into the interplay of the single-particle and collective effects during
the nuclear fission process.

nucleus as predicted by the Liquid Drop Model with and without shell structure correc-
tions, adapted from [30]. A diagram of the shape of the fissioning nucleus corresponding
to different stages of fission is included.
Nuclear Fission 31
Calculations using the SCM and derived models are typically performed over a set of
nuclear deformation parameters, as discussed in work by P. Moller et al. [41]. Such cal-
culations result in potential energy surfaces (PES) showing all the potential paths fission
process of a particular nucleus can take, i.e. binary or ternary/quaternary, symmetric
or asymmetric etc. PES plots clearly show path of minimum potential with associated
barriers for various nuclear processes, making extraction of features of fission dynamics
possible through calculation of inertial parameters, described in more detail in Ref. [42].
An example of a PES plot is shown in Figure 2.2.

hexadecapole deformation parameters,  and 4 respectively. 24 indicates the static
path to fission, i.e. the deformations nucleus is the most likely to undergo during the
fission process. Adapted from [43].
2.3 Fission Cross-section
Fission can be spontaneous, as in the case of 252Cf discussed above, or particle-induced,
as was the case for the uranium samples used by Hahn and Strassman. While 235U
fission is typically neutron-induced inside reactors (as neutrons are not hindered by the
nuclear Coulomb barrier), experiments have been done using other methods of inducing
fission, such as photon-induced fission (or photofission) [44], electron-induced fission (or
electrofission) [45], proton-induced fission [46] or Coulomb excitation (Coulex) induced
fission [47]. Neutrino-induced fission has also been proposed as a mechanism behind
abundances of elements involved in the r-process for nuclei heated by the neutrino flux
in supernovae ejecta [48]. STEFF, however, has so far been used only for measurements
of neutron-induced fission following commissioning with 252Cf.
Figure 2.3 shows a plot of fission cross-section for neutron-induced fission of 235U as a
function of incident neutron energy. The cross-section is typically divided into several
sections based on the features it exhibits: smooth decay in the thermal and epithermal
neutron region (0.025 eV - 0.2 eV) [31], resolved resonance region (0.2 eV - 10 keV),
32 Nuclear Fission
unresolved resonance region (10 keV - 6 MeV) and multichance fission region ('6
MeV).
The cross-section roughly follows 1/v decay (evident at thermal and epithermal incident
neutron energies), a relationship that suggests that the probability of neutron absorption
and, consequently, fission largely depends on the amount of time the neutron spends
in the volume of a nucleus [49]. When the binding energy and kinetic energy of the
incident neutron are equal to the energy of some excited state in the compound nucleus,
a sharp increase in the cross-section associated with a resonance appears. As the incident
neutron energy grows, the spacing between resonances becomes comparable to the widths
of the states corresponding to the resonances, and the resonances become unresolved,
producing a relatively smooth cross-section as a function of energy. At excitation energies
about 6 MeV [50] the compound nucleus 236U excitation is greater than the binding
energy of a neutron, which may then be emitted, and the resulting 235U nucleus can
still undergo fission. Fission following single neutron emission is called first-chance
fission, an effect that causes a cross-section increase seen in 6 MeV energy range due
to contribution from fission of the excited post-evaporation nucleus. Similarly, fission
following two-neutron emission is called second-chance fission. In the case of the 235U
nucleus, it has been investigated as a fissioning nucleus in the 5th chance fission scenario
of 240U [51].
Nuclear Fission 33
  

Figure 2.3: Cross-section of 235U(n,f) reaction in barns as a function of incident
neutron energy, taken from JEFF3.3 release [11]. At neutron energies below 0.2
eV, in the thermal and epithermal regions, the fission cross-section decreases following
1/v dependence. At higher neutron energies, above 0.2 eV and below 10 keV, the
neutrons are in the 235U resolved resonance region, where cross-section features sharp
peaks due to neutron energies coinciding with the 236U energy levels. The energy
levels overlap at energies greater than 10 keV and form a continuum in the cross-
section, known as the unresolved resonance region. At energies greater than 6 MeV,
the compound nucleus is excited to energies above neutron separation. This region is
known as the multi-chance fission region, a name given to it due to compound nucleus
undergoing fission following emission of one or more neutrons.
2.4 Fission Products
The fission process is very diverse and results in a range of product particles. A typical
fission event produces two fission fragments (FF), accompanied by a number of neutrons
and gamma rays. Ternary fission, i.e. fission that produces three fragments, is also a
possibility and occurs at a rate of about 0.3% of all fission for 235U [52], producing an
alpha particle as a third fragment in 90% of such events [53]. The alpha particle is then
ejected at a 90angle to the paths of the two larger fragments. A proposed exotic case of
ternary fission called colinear ternary fission produces light nuclei through formation
of two fragments, where one of them forms in a highly-deformed configuration and
undergoes a secondary fission-like rupture [54], with the resulting fragment distribution
featuring two lighter fragments moving in one direction and another, heavier fragment
going in the opposite direction. Quaternary fission, division of a nucleus into 4 fragments,
has also been experimentally observed at a rate of 1:106 fissions [55]. Much like in ternary
fission, the additional fragments (as compared to binary fission) are typically light nuclei,
34 Nuclear Fission
predominantly alphas. This work, however, concentrates on the most common binary
fission, and the word fission refers to binary fission by default throughout the work.
2.4.1 Fission fragments
The two FFs produced in binary fission of actinides are predominantly asymmetric in
mass. Figure 2.4 shows the FF mass distribution for a number of parent nuclei. Heavy
fragment mass distributions are consistently peaked around the Z = 50, N = 82 double-
shell closure, indicating the importance of shell effects in the fission process.
Figure 2.4: Mass distributions of fission fragments produced in fission of 234,236U,
240Pu, 252Cf, [56] and 256Fm [57]. One noteworthy feature of the mass distributions
presented is the consistency of the heavy fragment masses, centering around the Z = 50,
N = 82 shell closure.
There are other shell closures involved in describing the mass distributions of fission
fragments. An observed increase in the A = 140 yield of heavy fragments, shown
in Fig. 2.4 above, is typically attributed to the N = 88 deformed shell closure [58].
The Z = 28 and N = 50 shell closures contribute to increased yield in A = 70 light
fragments in highly-asymmetric fission [59] and in colinear ternary fission [60], and Z = 2,
N = 2 closures explain the prevalence of alphas forming in the neck region during
ternary/quaternary fission.
A general description of scission configurations and the resulting fission fragment mass,
shape and kinetic energy distributions in binary fission was formulated by U. Brosa
et al [61] in terms of neck length between the two fragments. Scission configurations,
often called Brosa modes, are grouped into several types. The original publication
suggests four modes, Standard I, Standard II, super-short and super-long, however a
fifth mode, Standard III, has since been identified [62]. A schematic representation of
Nuclear Fission 35
the modes is shown in Fig. 2.5 with Standard modes combined into one. The standard
modes are all asymmetric and correspond to the scission configurations built on the
shell closures described above: the Standard I mode corresponds to the Z = 50, N = 82
heavy fragment configuration, Standard II to the N = 88 deformed shell, and Standard
III to the Z = 28, N = 50 closure. The super-short and super-long modes are both
symmetrical. The shape and kinetic energy properties of the fission fragments are inter-
related and arise naturally from the Brosa modes: if the modes neck is longer, the
fragments are further apart, which implies less Coulomb repulsion between them. In
such a situation, the fragments would separate with lower kinetic energies, leaving more
energy for their excitation, deformation and possible subsequent neutron and gamma
emission. As Fig. 2.5 shows, for super-short mode, fragments tend to be more oblate,
and, conversely, in super-long mode they tend to be more prolate.
Figure 2.5: A schematic representation of Brosa modes, adapted from [61]. Panel (a)
shows a252Cf nucleus as it stretches into a fission isomer. Fission isomer then tunnels
through the second barrier and undergoes scission process, which Brosa et al described
in terms of scission modes dependent on the length of the neck between the nascent
fragments: super-short (shown in panel (b), Standard I and II (grouped into a single
standard mode in panel (c)) and super-long (shown in panel (d)).
Fission fragments are typically produced in a neutron-rich configuration, since stable
nuclei around and below the Z = 50 shell closure have a lower neutron-to-proton ratio
than actinide nuclei [63]. Thus, when 235U (proton-to-neutron ratio 143:921.55) under-
goes fission, the resulting fragments have an excess of neutrons, explaining the neutron
emission taking place as described above. After the excitation energy has been expended,
the nuclei undergo  decay and the resulting nuclei are referred to as fission products
(as opposed to fission fragments), and their production time (order of seconds [8]) lies
outside the timescales of measurements performed using the detectors on STEFF (slow
heavy fission fragment time-of-flight in STEFF is 120 ns).

2.4.2 Neutrons
The kinetic energy of the two fragments in binary fission typically takes away 80%
of the binding energy available from fission. The other 20% takes the form of frag-
ment excitation energy and is subsequently distributed between neutron and gamma-ray
emission from the fragments [8]. Neutrons are typically emitted from moving fragments
1018 s after scission [64] and appear forward-focused in the laboratory frame of ref-
erence due to kinematic boost from the fragments. However, an earlier emission of
neutrons perpendicularly to the axis of fission from the neck of a scissioning nucleus has
been a long-standing subject of interest [64] [65] [66] [67] and estimated to account for
10% of prompt fission neutrons [64]. Such neutrons have not been experimentally con-
firmed, and a recent prompt fission neutron measurement by A. Gook et al [68] for 235U
fission induced by 0.26 eV - 45 keV neutrons appears to contradict prior experimental
suggestions for the existence of scission neutrons in that energy region.
Since it takes several MeV to separate a neutron from a nucleus, prompt fission neutron
(PFN) emission occurs while there is sufficient energy available for the process. The
number of prompt neutrons emitted is known as the neutron multiplicity, denoted .
Averaged multiplicity for light fragments has been measured to be LF  1.42, and
HF  1.00 for heavy fragments [68]. Further delayed neutrons may be emitted following
beta decay of the fragments [69]. Typical PFN energy distribution is shown in Fig. 2.6
and average PFN multiplicity as a function of FF mass is shown in Fig. 2.7.
Figure 2.6: Prompt fission neutron energy spectrum, showing the measured prompt
neutron energy  distribution in the centre-of-mass frame in 235U fission for light frag-
ments (in white) and heavy fragments (in black) [68]. Also shown are Maxwellian fits

fragments.

often referred to as sawtooth, whereby as light and heavy fragment sides of the spec-
trum increase in mass and the heavy fragment moves further from Z = 50, N = 82 shell
closures, more neutrons are available for evaporation.
2.4.3 Gamma rays
Once the available excitation energy approaches neutron separation energy, gamma emis-
sion competes with neutron emission depending on the spins and parities of the states
the nucleus occupies at this stage [72]. Once excitation energy is expended to levels
below the neutron separation threshold, fission fragments emit high-energy statistical
gamma rays until they decay to an yrast state. Subsequent decays take place through
gamma emission via series of states with the lowest spin for a given available excitation,
i.e. yrast line gamma ray emission, until the nucleus reaches the ground state [69]. Col-
lectively, these fission gamma rays are referred to as prompt fission gammas (PFG), as
opposed to delayed gamma rays originating from long-lived isomers or following beta
decay of the fragments. Figure 2.8 shows the stages described above for binary fission
of a 248Cm nucleus. Fig. 2.9 shows PFG spectra (PFGS) as measured by Oberstedt et
al. [14] and Verbinski et al. [18], along with the PFGS in the ENDF/B-VII.1 release [23].
PFGS show the energy distribution and relative yield of PFG. Measurements of PFGS
in correlation with fission fragments is the aim of the STEFF experiments conducted to
date.

gamma decay. Lastly, fission fragments undergo several beta-decays. The fragment de-
excitation process is describe in greater detail in the insert, which was adapted from [73].
The insert shows a schematic representation of the primary and secondary fragment ex-
citation energy E dissipation against fragment spin J . The fragments de-excite via
neutron emission until their excitation is re-educed to an energy limit Elim, which is
less than the neutron separation energy Sn. The fragments then de-excite from the
high-spin region via statistical decays until they reach the yrast line at energy E(Yrast)
and de-excite via discrete yrast decays.

STEFF
3.1 STEFF
STEFF was constructed at the University of Manchester in the late 2000s with the aim
of conducting PFG measurements to address the data needs of the nuclear industry and
fundamental nuclear science. The spectrometer was conceived based on a pre-existing
experimental set-up, where an HPGe array was used in conjunction with an ionization
chamber to perform nuclear structure measurements based on gamma-ray spectroscopy,
such as isomeric states identified in 94Rb fragments produced through 235U fission [74].
Gas-filled detectors were developed and tested on several occasions [75] [20] at Lohengrin
in a similar fashion to the experiment discussed in Chapter 4 of this work. Two ionization
chambers were coupled to a NaI scintillator array forming STEFF, which had its debut in
fission studies at the PF1B neutron guide at ILL in 2013 [76]. The experiment consisted
of measurements of PFG and both FF formed in binary thermal neutron-induced fission
of 235U. Since that experiment, STEFF underwent a number of modifications. The
upgrades include addition of two secondary 1E1v arms, changes to the time-of-flight
detectors, upgrades to NaI detectors and changing some NaI crystals to LaBr3. The
diagram of the current layout of the spectrometer is presented in Fig. 3.1.

[77]. Letter A indicates the neutron beam entry point. Letter B denotes the central
chamber, which contains the fissile material target (in orange), the START detector (in
purple) and an array of scintillators (in green). Letter C shows the positions of the two
MWPC STOP detectors on the main arms of STEFF (left arm is Bragg, right arm is
Hipps). D indicates the position of the MCP STOPs in the FiFI arms. Lastly, E shows
the positions of the four gas-filled detectors.
In the diagram, the main features of STEFF are indicated in false colour and with
letters. The beam line, indicated by letter A, enters STEFF from below and exits at the
top, allowing the neutrons that did not interact with the target to travel to the beam
dump. The target is positioned inside the central chamber, denoted with letter B, The
target mount can rotate at certain angular increments; there have been several such
target mounts used with different rotational capabilities. Next to the target sits the
START detector used for starting the timing of the FF ToF through the main two arms
of STEFF. The START detector sits on the Bragg arm of STEFF, which is on the left in
the diagram. Around the central chamber are 12 slots for scintillator detectors. Passive
tungsten shields surround the scintillator slots to reduce detector-to-detector scattering.
The scintillators are mainly 45 in. NaI(Tl) detectors with a geometric efficiency of 30%,
but individual or clustered LaBr3(Ce) scintillators have also been used. STEFF has four
arms attached to the central chamber; the two arms that are opposite each other around
the target are called Bragg and Hipps and form the 2E2v section of STEFF. The other
two arms are called FiFI Bragg and FiFI Hipps, these arms perform measurements of
only one of the two fission FFs in an event. Each of the arms has a STOP detector: the
two main arms STOPs are MWPC assemblies (marked with letter C) and the FiFI arm
STOPS are microchannel plate (MCP) assemblies (marked with letter D). All arms end
in gas-filled chambers, which are denoted with letter E.
STEFF 43
3.1.1 2-Energy 2-velocity Measurements
The main arms of STEFF rely on the 2E2v technique, whereby both FF from binary
fission have their velocities and kinetic energies measured in parallel. Since FF travel at
velocities of a few percent of the speed of light, their kinetic energy can be approximated
using the classical kinetic energy formula
, (3.1)
where A is the FF mass following neutron emission and v is velocity. Measurements
of kinetic energy and velocity, therefore, permit a calculation of FF mass. In principle,
given sufficient mass resolution, measuring the two FF masses allows one to calculate the
number of prompt neutrons emitted during fission, although the current mass resolution
of STEFF (4 amu) is insufficient for this purpose.
Other 2E2v devices have been previously constructed for fission experiments. The first
such device was Cosi Fan Tutte [78], which was constructed and operated at ILL in
Grenoble, France. This spectrometer attained a great time resolution of 100 ps for ve-
locity measurements and a very good energy resolution of 500 keV for light fragments,
which led to its capability of resolving individual FF masses. Cosi Fan Tutte, however,
had very low geometric efficiency, which has been estimated to be at most 0.1% [79],
which led to its disuse. Several other 2E2v spectrometers were built following the proof
of principle by Cosi Fan Tutte. Besides STEFF, there are three other spectrometers:
VERDI (VElocity foR Direct particle Identification) [80], SPIDER (SPectrometer for
Ion DEtermination in fission Research) [81], and FALSTAFF (Four Arm cLover for the
STudy of Actinide Fission Fragments) [82]. VERDI spectrometer has two silicon detec-
tor arms, which are currently being investigated for plasma delay time effects whereby
electron-ion plasma formed in Si delays signal registration by the anode [83]. SPIDER
spectrometer is ionization chamber-based and is being upgraded from two arms to six-
teen in order to form a new spectrometer called MegaSPIDER [84]. FALSTAFF is
planned to have two ionization chamber-based arms, only one of which is completed and
is currently being tested [85].
3.1.2 START
STEFF START detector is one of the two sets of timing detectors required for measuring
the FF ToF in the main arms of STEFF. START detector is positioned 15 cm from the
target center covering 0.37 sr [86], and comprises three main components that share a
44 STEFF
mount. The full assembly is shown in Fig. 3.2. The main mechanism of START timing
is the emission of electrons from a thin foil, called Secondary Electron Emission (SEE)
foil, which is made of aluminium evaporated onto a 0.2 m formvar film and is held at a
-1.75 kV potential. The aluminium layer has a thickness of 101 g cm2. The electron
emission may occur as the FF passes through the foil and interacts with the atomic
electrons in it. Alternatively, the emission can be spontaneous, producing a background
of false signals. When a fragment ejects electrons from a foil, a large number of them
will be forward-scattered, however some of them may be backscattered instead (for light
fragments, 95 forward-focused electrons have been measured in Ref. [87], compared to
38 backward-focused electrons). A measurement has been performed on foils identical to
the START foils [88] using  particles in order to estimate the number of the electrons
emitted at backwards angles per incident . The resulting value of 1.10.2 electrons is in
agreement with previously measurement by Pferdekamper and Clerc [87] performed for
carbon foils. The investigation in Ref. [88] did not make electron emission measurements
for FF, however Pferdekamper and Clerc observed backward emission of 38 electrons for
light fragments and 40 for heavy fragments, with the majority of the electrons having
the energy of less than 230 eV.
The backscattered electrons in the START detector enter the space between the foil and
the electrostatic mirror, which consists of two wire grids separated by 1 cm. The wires
have a diameter of 20 m thick and a pitch of 2 mm, resulting in a transparency of
90% [77]. A potential of -3.5 kV is applied across the gap between the grids in order to
deflect the electrons into the MCP assembly, which consists of two Hamamatsu F1942-04
MCPs [89] in a chevron configuration. The MCPs are 1 mm-thick lead-doped glass
plates with 25 m-wide tubular channels, which extend from one side of the plate to
the other at an angle to the surface. The channels are angled to ensure the interaction of
any electrons entering the MCP with the channel walls. A voltage is of -4.8 kV is applied
across the MCPs, accelerating the electrons which enter it in order to cause ejection of
secondary electrons in the collisions with the walls. The chevron arrangement of the
two MCP plates means that the channels in the first MCP are arranged at a different
angle to the channels in the second MCP, so that the electrons leaving the first MCP
will restart the collisions upon entering the second plate, while also reducing the slow
component of the signal caused by electrons ejected through scattering of resulting ions.
This process repeats until the electrons leave the second MCP and are registered by the
anode as a timing signal. The collisions in the MCPs multiply the number of electrons by
a factor of 106. The STOP detectors in the FiFI arms have an identical arrangement
to the START detector.

wire grid of the electrostatic mirror is in blue. In orange is the position of the MCP.
3.1.3 Scintillators
As mentioned previously, STEFF gamma-ray measurements are performed using some
combination of NaI(Tl) and LaBr3(Ce) inorganic scintillation detectors. The scintillators
are arranged in two rings surrounding the target and containing 6 scintillator slots each.
The scintillators are all angled at 45 relative to the horizontal plane, spaced at 60
relative to each other and are positioned 20 cm away from the center of the chamber.
Both of the scintillator types function in similar ways, which are thoroughly described in
Ref. [90]. The general principle behind these detectors lies in conversion of the incident
gamma-ray energy into visible scintillation light. This is done by means of a crystal
whose electrons are promoted to conduction band by an interaction with an incident
gamma ray via Compton scattering or photoelectric effect. If the electron was to be
re-absorbed by a resulting hole, the photon could be re-absorbed or its energy would
be too high for photomultiplier tubes to function efficiently, so an activator material
is added to the crystal at a fraction of 0.1%. The addition of the activator material
introduces levels into the forbidden gap of the crystal electronic band structure. The
sites with activator material then become very favorable for electron de-excitation, which
is done in smaller increments producing visible scintillation light (maximum wavelength
of NaI scintillation light is 415 nm [91] and 380 nm for LaBr3 [92]). Moreover, since
the resulting photons are not produced with energies that match the majority of the
electronic levels of the crystal, there is very little self-absorption of the scintillation light
by the crystal.
Scintillation light may travel to the photocathode attached to the photomultiplier tube
(PMT) or alternatively towards the sides of the crystal. Typical NaI crystals are sur-
rounded with MgO powder to reflect the visible photons to ensure maximum flux at the
46 STEFF
photocathode [90]. For a properly-chosen photocathode material, once the visible light
impinges on the photocathode, it will be absorbed and an electron will be emitted. The
geometry of the photocathode is such, that the electrons are focused towards a series
of dynodes. A potential across the multiplication region that the dynodes occupy will
accelerate the electrons, which will scatter off or inside the dynode and eject secondary
electrons. The multiplied current of secondary electrons will then be accelerated towards
further dynodes and the process will repeat. The final current for Scionix Ltd. PMTs
used on STEFF is typically multiplied by a factor of >105 over a series of 10 dynodes [93].
The current is finally collected at the anode and forms a signal of amplitude proportional
to the original gamma-ray energy for a properly configured scintillation setup.
For NaI(Tl) (sodium iodide) and LaBr3(Ce) (lanthanum bromide) scintillators, the prin-
cipal performance differences lie in the timing and the energy resolutions of the two
detectors and stem from the difference in electron structure and its decay time. Greater
Z of the constituent elements in a LaBr3 crystal means that there are more electrons
with various pathways through the band gap available for excitation and subsequent
scintillation (typical LaBr3 scintillation photon yield is 65 per keV of incident gamma
energy [92], while the same value is 38 for NaI [91]), which contributes to a considerable
improvement in the energy resolution (3% for 661-keV 137Cs gamma ray, compared
to 7% in NaI [91]). The primary reason for the improved resolution of the LaBr3
compared to NaI, however, lies in the light yield non-proportionality of the two scintil-
lator types [94]. Light yield non-proportionality is a factor that varies depending on the
incident gamma-ray energy and, as the name suggests, describes the linearity of the of
scintillation light yield for each gamma-ray energy. Non-proportionality arises in scintil-
lators from various complicated interactions of photons and electrons inside the crystal
that affect the detector response, such as formation of Auger electrons,  rays, excitons,
etc. [95]. The reduction of the contribution of these properties is discussed in Ref. [94],
and measurements with a 137Cs source in Ref. [95] show a factor of two reduction in
non-proportionality for LaBr3 compared to NaI crystals. LaBr3 timing resolution is also
improved compared to NaI crystals, and primary decay time is 20 ns in LaBr3 [96] [92]
and 250 ns in NaI [96] [91]. A spectrum comparing the response of the two detector
types to that of HPGe for a mix of standard calibration sources in shown below in Fig.
STEFF 47
Figure 3.3: Spectra collected by HPGe, LaBr3(Ce) and NaI(Tl) detectors for a mix
of standard calibration sources demonstrating differing energy resolutions [96].
Despite the advantages presented by the smaller crystal, the trade-off in replacing NaI
crystals with LaBr3 arises through reduced geometric efficiency, which combines poorly
with the efficiency problems associated with 2E2v technique. The NaI detectors on
STEFF have a diameter of 127 mm and a length of 102 mm, while the LaBr3 used in
measurements was a block with a 5555 mm face and a 110 mm length. Replacement
of one NaI crystal on STEFF with 1 LaBr3 crystal resulted in geometric efficiency
for gamma rays reducing from  30% to  28% [21]. Smaller size also implies lower
likelihood of re-absorption of a scattered gamma-ray. A comparison of Compton events
from 661-keV gamma rays from a calibration 137Cs source for the two crystal types is
show in Fig. 3.4. Furthermore, LaBr3 crystals produce a gamma-ray background due
to the internal activity of natural lanthanum. Natural lanthanum is 0.09% 138La, which
has a half-life of 1011 years against + decay to 138Ba with a branching ratio of 66% or
 decay to 138Ce with a branching ratio of 34%. The former results in a gamma-ray
of 1436 keV followed by a 138Ba X-ray of 32 keV, the latter results in a gamma ray
with an energy of 789 keV [97]. These two gamma rays form background in experiments
involving natural lanthanum scintillators, which has to be accounted for, although these
transitions also may be beneficial by serving as an additional calibration source.

Figure 3.4: A comparison of the responses of LaBr3(Ce) (in blue) and NaI(Tl) (in
red) scintillators to a standard calibration source of 137Cs normalized in area. The
photopeaks and Compton continuum features typical of the source are clearly visible,
and the relative amount of counts in the two features indicates the lower photopeak
efficiency of the LaBr3 compared to the NaI due to its smaller size. The superior energy
resolution of the LaBr3 is also evident.
The Scionix Ltd. PMTs used on STEFF were modified by the manufacturer to be
more resistant to high-rate saturation effects by switching the input voltage polarity,
extending the capacitor chain and reducing the resistor chain between the dynodes, and
removing the capacitor on the PMT output [21]. Examples of testing of the new PMT
performance at high rates are presented in Ref. [21]. The need for these modifications
arose due to the differences between ILL and n ToF, where the latest STEFF campaigns
took place. A further description of the fission rates and gamma-ray flux at n ToF are
presented in Chapter 5.
3.1.4 Gas-filled Detector Principles
STEFF features several gas-filled chambers: MWPC STOP detectors and Bragg detec-
tors (BD), i.e. ionization chambers with a coaxial anode orientation. Typical gas-filled
detectors rely on ionization caused by charged particles to produce electron ion pairs,
which may be used to form a signal. In the case of STEFF, FFs or electrons ejected
from timing foils undergo a series of collisions with gas molecules. The signal is produced
through collection of the resulting electrons and, in the case of STEFF BDs, is propor-
tional to FF energy, although there are several effects that need accounting for when
considering the signal. Such effects include non-ionizing excitations of the gas molecules
STEFF 49
during the collision, capture of ejected electrons by ions (called recombination), and
possible electron exchange between the gas and the FF.
The general process of stopping of charged particles in a medium is described by the
Bethe-Bloch formula given in Eq. (3.2) [98]. Note that the Bethe-Bloch formula does
not perform as well for stopping of ions in the FF velocity range compared to faster ions,
see Chapter 4 for detail.

In the Bethe-Bloch formula, dE/dx is the differential energy loss (often referred to as the
stopping power or, more accurately, stopping force),  is the medium density, Z is the
medium atomic number, A is the medium atomic mass,  is the fragment velocity (v/c),
me is the mass of an electron, e is the electron charge, and I is the mean excitation
potential. The C/Z term is used for lower energy collisions, when lower electron orbitals
are screened by higher orbitals. The /2 term is a relativistic correction.
The effects of recombination are reduced by increasing the electrode potential inside the
chamber. Five regions of operation of gas-filled chambers are defined in [90] based on
the electrode potential. These regions are shown in Figure 3.5.
50 STEFF
Figure 3.5: A diagram of regions of operation of gas-filled detectors based on the
applied voltage adapted from [90]. The diagram is divided into five regions by vertical
dashed lines. The five regions are: the recombination region, the ion saturation region,
the proportional region, the limited proportionality region, and the Geiger-Mueller
region. The two lines represent the effect of doubling the energy deposition inside the
gas. All gas-filled chambers discussed in this work are operated in the proportional
region.
In the first region, the potential is too low to prevent recombination. An increase in
the potential results in reduction of recombination, meaning that the electrodes collect
nearly all the charge released in ionization. Further increases in the potential accelerate
the released charges to a sufficient drift velocity to cause multiplication. Multiplication
is a process whereby primary electrons produced in ionization events are accelerated
towards electrodes and cause further ionization by colliding with medium atoms. In this
region, the height of the pulse collected on the electrodes is approximately proportional
to the initial (pre-multiplication) charge. Increase in potential past this region results
in loss of the linear relation of pulse and initial ionization. In the Geiger-Mueller region,
any proportionality is lost. This loss occurs due to multiplication processes becoming
dominant over the initial ionization events. In this voltage range, multiplication releases
charges until the amount of ions released offsets the electrode potential below the thresh-
old for further multiplication. All the signals collected by the electrodes then result in
same pulse height. Further increase in voltage causes breakdown arcs to spontaneously
occur in the detector volume [98].
The process of charge multiplication in a chamber takes the form of an avalanche, where
newly-released electrons are accelerated by the field, potentially causing further ioniza-
tion. This process is called a Townsend avalanche [99] [90]. Fractional increase in the
free electron number is given in the Townsend equation as
STEFF 51
= dx. (3.4)
The Townsend equation provides information on the increase in the number of free elec-
trons dn over a distance dx. The two quantities are related by the Townsend coefficient
, which is specific to a particular gas used in the chamber, and also depends on the
gas pressure. Below the multiplication threshold potential  = 0. If the electric field is
constant inside the detector, which is the case for the STEFF MWPCs, the Townsend
coefficient is a constant. magboltz [100] simulations calculate a value  = 407 in the
MWPCs for isobutane gas.
3.1.4.1 Fill Gases
Unsurprisingly, a critical choice in designing a gas-filled detector is the fill gas. There are
a number of fill gases frequently used, such as isobutane (iC4H10), P-10 (90% argon and
10% methane), CF4, and argon [98]. There are a variety of factors that are important
when considering the choice of a fill gas for a given gas-filled detectors purpose. A
parameter of particular importance is the average ionization energy W . The values of
this parameter for several gases are summarized in Table 3.1. The choice of parameters
for the work presented here has to be made so as to maximize the signal amplitude in
order to maximize the detector energy resolution and make any features in the signal
formation process more identifiable.
Table 3.1: List of the average ionization energies W for a variety of typical fill gases.
The values are taken from Ref. [98].
Gas W (eV)
isobutane 26
P-10 30
CF4 54
Ar 25
Average ionization energy determines the number of electrons produced in ionization
during FF stopping, which in turn determines the amplitude of the signal (although
electron re-absorption probability for a given gas will also affect this). Of the typical
gases listed in Table 3.1, isobutane and argon have the lowest average ionization po-
tentials, and stand out as the natural fill gas candidates. Fig. 3.6 shows a modeled
number of electrons produced by a charged particle ionizing various gases as a function
of the number of electrons in a molecule. It is evident from the figure, that isobutane
provides the greatest electron yield, far in excess of argon. This is reconciled with the
W considerations above by considering the screening of the lower electron orbitals by
the electrons in higher orbitals, reducing the likelihood of their ionization.

of the plot is a fitted ratio of the total number of electrons in a molecule Z divided
by a power of the average number of electrons per atom in the molecule Z. Ref. [101]
provides comparison of their model with experimental results, which are found to agree.
Following the above considerations, all the gas-filled detectors on STEFF are operated
with isobutane, although future experiments may consider other gases due to a health
and safety issue of isobutanes flammability.
3.1.5 Multiwire Proportional Counters
MWPCs were first proposed in 1968 by G. Charpak with his colleagues [102], an invention
that earned him a Nobel Prize [103]. MWPCs consist of a gas-filled chamber with an
anode represented by a plane of thin wires stretched in parallel. The multiplication
region, i.e. the region where the field is high enough to cause multiplication, is relatively
small, meaning it does not span the volume of the chamber. Instead, it is cylindrically
symmetric and centered around the wire [102]. A diagram of the field shape around a
wire is shown in Figure 3.7.

a multiwire proportional counter [102]. The centre of one of the wires is indicated by
field line number 20, which is effectively a point.
The primary electrons drift towards the wire closest to the location of ionization, and
upon entering the multiplication region accelerate sufficiently to start an avalanche. A
Monte Carlo simulation result for an avalanche around an anode wire is shown in Figure

3.1.5.1 STEFF MWPC STOPs
The STOP detectors in the main arms ToF sections are made of a 0.2 m indium-
coated formvar window resting on a wire grid at a potential of -9 kV, acting as a SEE
foil, an electrostatic mirror grid and a stack of two MWPC planes with a cathode plane.
The arrangement is shown in Fig. 3.9 with cathode plane removed for visibility. As a
secondary electron is emitted from the SEE foil, it travels through an electrostatic mirror,
which deflects the electrons towards the MWPC planes. Unlike the START electrostatic
mirror, the STOPmirrors have two acceleration regions both at a potential of -18 kV: one
formed by the diagonal wire grids and the second region formed by two wire planes at the
top of the electrostatic mirror. The additional acceleration is needed to ensure that the
electrons have enough energy to pass through a 0.9 m Mylar window that separates the
gas of the MWPCs from the vacuum of the ToF section. The 45 angle of the electrostatic
mirror relative to the emission foil reduces the path the electrons emitted at the bottom
of the foil traverse before being deflected, while increasing the now-deflected electrons
path towards the gas window. The effect is reversed for the electrons emitted at the top
of the foil, so they travel a longer distance towards the mirror, and then a shorter distance
towards the window. Thus, the mirrors angle serves to normalize the distances all the
backscattered electrons travel, improving the signal time characteristics. Furthermore,
STEFF 55
the initial acceleration of electrons towards the electrostatic mirror results in reduction
of the signal timing width caused by a distribution of initial electron velocities. As the
backscattered electrons velocities increase, the distribution of velocities is compressed,
resulting in a narrow pulse with better time characteristics.
The gas inside the MWPC stack is isobutane at a pressure of 9.0 mbar. The arrangement
of the wire grid stack is shown in Fig. 3.10 (note that the diagram is upside down
compared to how the MWPCs are placed inside STEFF). The wire grids are soldered
and glued onto 5015 cm PCB planes. The first wire grid that the electrons encounter
is the cathode held at a -600 V potential and is comprised of 50 m gold-coated tungsten
wires at 1 mm pitch and stretched length-wise. The next wire grid is an anode held at
ground potential and subdivided into 4 electrically-connected banks of wires for position
sensitivity. The anode wires are 20 m thick gold-coated tungsten wires at a pitch of 1
mm, stretched perpendicularly to the wires of the cathode grids. The cathode and the
anode grids are attached to a cathode plane made of copper, which also had a -600 V
potential applied to it. The separation of all the layers forming the stack is 3.2 mm and
all the layers are not electrically coupled to each other.

3.1.5.2 STEFF Bragg Chambers
There are four Bragg chambers that terminate each of the four STEFF arms and result
in a total geometric efficiency of 134 mSr (the main arms cover 30 mSr and FiFIs cover
37 mSr each). While FiFI Bragg and FiFI Hipps BDs are identical, the construction of
Bragg BD, Hipps BD and the FiFIs is different. The schematic diagrams of each type
of BD is shown in Figs. 3.11. The Bragg BD operates at 70 mbar isobutane pressure
and a 1200 V potential, while the Hipps and FiFI BDs operate at 100 mbar pressure
with 900 V potential. The Bragg BD is 20 cm deep, and the Hipps and FiFI BDs are
15 cm deep. The depth of the chamber here is measured from the entrance window (0.9
m of aluminized Mylar) to the Frisch grid. The diagrams of the Bragg and Hipps arms
including the BDs are shown in Figs. 3.12 and 3.13 respectively.
Figure 3.11: A schematic diagram of the structure of a FiFI BD. Letter A indicates
the location of the entrance window foil, B shows the guiding rings and C shows the
position of the Frisch grid and the anode.
The Frisch grids are used in the Bragg chambers in order to shield the anode from
the electromagnetic fields of electrons and ions as they form while the FF is stopping.
Positive ions are swept by the electrostatic field towards the window, which acts as a
STEFF 57
cathode. The electrons that are formed at the start of the FF track exist in the volume
of the BD for longer than the electrons formed at the end of the FF track. Therefore
an unshielded anode, beside accumulating varying amounts of ion signal, would collect
the signal from the early electrons for longer than from the later electrons, leading to
non-linearity of the final BD signal depending on the track length. A Frisch grid acts as
shield, preventing the induced electron signal from reaching the anode until the electrons
drift past the grid, and blocking the signal from the ions. The electrons are accelerated
to their full velocity almost immediately upon forming, which means that they travel
with the same drift velocity as they pass by the grid, taking the same time to traverse
the grid-anode space, leading to a linear signal. STEFF Frisch grids are made of 20 m
wires stretched at a pitch of 2 mm, 1 cm above the anodes.

STOP. Letter A denotes the position of the MWPC STOP volume, letter B marks the
position of the BD and letter C shows the location of the window (shown as a grey
mesh) separating the two. Inside the BD there is a series of repeating grey planes that
represent the guiding rings, followed by a yellow plane that holds the Frisch grid. The
red plane behind it is the anode.

Letter markers are the same as for Bragg in Fig. 3.12. The grey mesh at point C shows
the position of the Mylar window between the BD and STOP. The orange planes inside
the BD represent the guiding rings, and the positions of the Frisch grid and the anode
are shown as light blue planes.
The anodes in the two main arms of STEFF are segmented into 15 parts, arranged
in a 35 grid of pads. Each pad has the dimensions of 9848 mm with 2 mm space
between the pads. The anodes in the FiFI arms are not segmented and are circular with
a diameter of 8 cm. Furthermore, each BD contains guiding rings space at intervals of
1 cm that increase in potential in even steps up to the Frisch grid potential (800 kV
in the Hipps arm and 1100 kV in the Bragg arm). These rings are used to ensure the
field that draws electrons towards the anode is uniform across the chamber length, and
preventing the electrons from hitting the sides of the volume and getting grounded.

FiFI Characterization at
Lohengrin
The fission process is driven by the electromagnetic repulsion of the protons, and there-
fore knowledge of the atomic numbers of the FF is critical for modeling the dynamics of
fission. Moreover, beta decay models and subsequent fission product chemical properties
are dependent on the proton number, and therefore good understanding of this aspect
of fission is very important to reactor operation and nuclear waste management. Given
the broad applicability of the data on charge yields in fission, it is not surprising that a
multitude of experiments have been conducted with the aim of extracting these data.
A common type of atomic number measurement of fission fragments is through gamma-
or X-ray spectroscopy [105] [106] [107] [108]. Measurements of such decays allow un-
ambiguous identification of the nuclear species, provided the level scheme of the ob-
served fission fragment is known, a condition that precludes identification of some of
the more exotic fission fragments. Another common type of Z-measurements is E-E
spectroscopy, whereby a fragment interacts with a pair of detectors, such as silicon [109],
losing some of its kinetic energy (E) in one detector and the remainder (E) in another.
A plot of these two measured quantities then produces lines corresponding to the Z of
the incident FF, although the FF are separable by charge only up to an upper limit
of Z 42 using this method [110]. An improvement on this limitation has been made
at Lohengrin by using calorimetric low-temperature detectors for energy measurements
and varying thicknesses of silicon-nitride foils to obtain energy loss [111]. The upper
limit was moved up to Z 52 using such a detection setup, which still precludes mea-
surements of many atomic numbers found in fission, which in the case of 235U(n,f) go
up to 60 and beyond [112].
60 FiFI Characterization at ILL
Gas-filled detectors may be used for incident ion atomic number identification as well
by means of a method called Bragg Curve Spectroscopy (BCS) [113]. An ion entering
a volume of gas with energies greater than a few MeV/amu loses energy in accordance
with the Bethe-Bloch formula shown in Eqn. 3.2. The majority of the energy is lost at
the very end of the ion range, producing a characteristic peak, known as the Bragg peak,
the position of which allows for unambiguous identification of the incident ions atomic
number. This method of ion identification has been broadly used [114] [115], particularly
for studies of fission in inverse kinematics [116], whereby a heavy nucleus (such as an
actinide) is accelerated at a light target and undergoes fission following particle exchange
with the target, as opposed to direct kinematics, where a neutron (or some other particle)
impinges on a stationary heavy nuclear target. An example of charge yield spectrum
from an inverse-kinematics measurement of 236U (235U+n compound system) is shown
in Fig. 4.1, although the comparability of measurements in inverse kinematics and in
neutron-induced fission has been a topic of debate, due to questions of which nuclear
states are populated in the two reactions [117]. The reason for the use of BCS in ion
beam identification and fission in inverse kinematics is the aforementioned applicability
condition of the measured ion having energies of a few MeV/amu or greater. For example,
inverse kinematics measurements discussed in Ref. [118] employed ionization chambers
for identifying FF with energies of 1 GeV, i.e. 10 MeV/amu. If the ion velocity is
lower, as is the case for the FF in fission in direct kinematics (1 MeV/amu), a Bragg
peak does not form, and the majority of the FF energy is lost in the beginning of its path
in the detector volume, rather than the end. A plot of energy loss profiles simulated
in SRIM-2013 [119] for a 90Kr nucleus (a common fission fragment) at 1.5 GeV (17
MeV/amu) and at a typical light fission fragment energy of 90 MeV is shown in Fig. 4.2.

which is related to ion Z. The 90-MeV fragment energy loss profile is typical for FF
and shows no peaks, making charge extraction difficult.
Since many fission experiments in direct kinematics rely on gas-filled detectors (2E2v
spectrometers STEFF, SPIDER and FALSTAFF mentioned previously are just a few
examples), a method of using the energy loss of FF to provide indications of the FF
atomic number within the relevant energy range would be highly beneficial for fission
studies in general and subsequently help address fission theory and nuclear industry
needs for charge yields. The results of an experimental effort at extracting energy loss-
related parameters from FF ionization traces to examine the response of a Bragg detector
to varying atomic numbers is presented here and have also been published in [121].
4.1 Fission Fragment Stopping in Gas
The change in the energy loss profile at sub-Bragg peak energies occurs as a consequence
of the so-called effective charge problem, which was identified shortly after the discov-
ery of fission. As a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, some of its electrons are taken
up by the fragments and others are stripped, resulting in fragments that are partially
ionized, with a typical ionic charge of 20 [122]. As the partially-ionized fission frag-
ment enters the gas volume of a Bragg detector, it interacts with the medium molecules
in a series of complicated interactions, which involve electron exchange, polarization
and screening. All these effects contribute to distortion of the atomic number seen by
electrons into the so-called effective charge Zeff , which changes their binding energy.
Calculating ranges and stopping powers that depend on the effective charge has been a
long-standing problem in physics due to the dependence of multiple effects on both the
medium and the projectile, requiring considerable amount of measurements. An early
method of calculating Zeff was proposed by Niels Bohr in 1948 [123], by considering
62 FiFI Characterization at ILL
relative electron and ion velocities. Bohr suggested that as the ionized projectiles slow
down, the electrons with orbital velocities slower than the FF velocity v are stripped
and the resulting effective charge can be written as
Zeff =
3 , (4.1)
where v0 is the Bohr velocity (2108) cm/s. Typical FF velocities are 4-6 times greater
than v0 [124]. Furthermore, Bohr proposed dividing the stopping power of the medium
for the ions into two contributions: electronic and nuclear stopping. The somewhat-
misleadingly named nuclear stopping accounts for all the ions energy loss caused by
interactions of the ion with the atoms of the medium as a whole, such as non-ionizing
elastic scattering, whereas electronic stopping accounts for interactions of the ion with
individual electrons in the medium, such as ionization and electron exchange.
Further work on extracting effective charges was primarily focused on accumulating
sufficient experimental data [125] and producing empirical approximations to Zeff [126].
A considerable breakthrough has been made in stopping theories by J. Lindhard, M.
Scharff and H.E. Schitt [127], who over the course of ten years formulated the LSS
theory, named after them. LSS theory inherits Bohrs division of stopping into nuclear
and electronic contributions to calculate stopping powers and ranges of any particles
in any medium [127] within an accuracy of a factor of three [128]. The theory was
formulated relying primarily on fission fragment stopping data, and takes a statistical
approach to produce several integral equations for ion energy loss [127] and range [129],
but does not address the effective charge problem [130]. A method of calculating the
effective charge Zeff for an ion in an ionization state q has been proposed by W. Brandt
and M. Kitagawa [131], whereby Bohrs consideration of electron velocity relative to that
of the fragment was modified to compare electron velocities to the Fermi velocity of the
medium. Thus calculations based on the Zeff estimates such as Brandt-Kitagawa can
be used in conjunction with the LSS theory to perform stopping calculations.
As the fragments slow down, they exchange electrons with the atoms in the medium. A
1972 review of experimental evidence available at the time by H.-D. Betz [124] suggests
that heavy ions in the fission fragment velocity range during a single collision with the
atoms in the medium are likely to either pick up single electrons or lose several electrons
at once. Exchange of electrons proceeds until the ion reaches an equilibrium charge, and
further interactions with the medium by the ion proceed at or around the equilibrium
charge. Gas separators rely on charge equilibration to produce beams of known isotopic
composition. An empirical method of calculating such equilibrium charges was proposed
by Betz in 1966 [132] using the formula
FiFI Characterization at ILL 63
= 1 Cexp(/), (4.2)
where
 = Z . (4.3)
C and  are coefficients fitted to the data for particular projectile and target gas com-
bination, Z is the atomic number of the projectile,  is the fine structure constant and
 is the ion velocity divided by the speed of light. If C = 1 and  = 2/3, multiplication
of Eqn. 4.2 by Z yields the effective charge proposed by Bohr.
The velocity dependence of stopping power can be divided into different regions as shown
in Fig. 4.3. The figure shows qualitative plots of stopping power dE/dx for low- and
high-Z ion energy-to-mass ratio E/A adapted from [133]. The stopping power variation
is roughly divided into 4 regions, which will be described in reverse order to reflect
gradual energy loss of an ion in a medium. Region IV ions are relativistic and obey
Bethe-Bloch equation in their stopping. In region III, charge is exchanged by the ion
and the medium and ionization of target atoms occurs. When ions slow down into region
II, their charge is equilibrated. In region I, ions slow down through nuclear stopping, a
process that does not produce ionization electrons.
Figure 4.3: A qualitative plot of low- and high-Z ions stopping power dE/dx as a
function of E/A [133]. The plot is subdivided into 4 regions. Region I is dominated
by nuclear stopping and produces little ionization. Region II represents electronic
scattering of an ion at an equilibrated charge state. Region III is dominated by charge
exchange and ionization effects. Ions in region IV are relativistic and the scattering in
this region can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula.

4.2 Lohengrin
The Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble is a common facility for measuring fission mass
[59] [134] and charge yields [109] [111] due to its high neutron flux research reactor. As
the reactor name suggests, it is optimized to produce high fluxes of neutrons reaching up
to 1.5  1015 neutrons s1 cm2 in the center [135]. The facility features more than 40
instruments, which use neutrons from the reactor to perform experiments for a variety
of scientific fields of research. Of particular interest to this work is PN1 Lohengrin.
Lohengrin is a mass separator, which functions as a FF velocity selector using two
magnets. Only one other separator like Lohengrin, called HIAWATHA [136], has been
built in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, but was decomissioned
along with its reactor in 2004 after ceasing operations in 1999.
Fig. 4.4 shows an overview of the Lohengrin structure. Lohengrins fission fragment
source is a target foil of fissile material placed inside the reactor at the entrance of the
PN1 beamline, which is 0.5 m from the reactor core [137]. The flux at that position is
 51014 neutrons s1 cm2. The targets at Lohengrin are typically deposited onto 0.2
mm thick titanium backing [137] with a thickness of fissile material of a few tens to a
few hundred g/cm2, further covered with a tantalum foil with a thickness of 40 g/cm2
[138]. As the fragments leave the target they pass through a dipole selector magnet,
which selects fragments by their A/q (mass to ionic charge) ratio, and then through an
electrostatic deflector, which selects fragments based on their E/q ratio, i.e. the ratio
of their kinetic energy to ionic charge. The FF mass resolution typically achieved at
Lohengrin is A/A  950 and a typical energy resolution is E/E  350 [137]. The
total flight time of FF through Lohengrin ranges between one and two microseconds [138],
a time that is shorter than the typical beta decay timescale (a few microseconds or
greater [30]), meaning that the focal plane at the end of the beamline provides secondary
fragments. Since the selection of the secondary fragments comprising the beam is based
on their masses and kinetic energies, the resulting beam consists of fragments traveling
at the same velocity, but with different masses. Furthermore, the selection is performed
based on ionic charge, resulting in mass selections typically containing several isobars. A
typical spectrum of FF energies is shown in Fig. 4.5 with several clearly-separated peaks
corresponding to fragments with a A/q = E/q = 4 Lohengrin setting and demonstrating
the remarkable ease of identifying fragments at Lohengrin.

A = 80 amu, q = 20, E = 80 MeV setting, with the peak mass and energy identification

4.3 FiFI at Lohengrin
A campaign of measurements at Lohengrin was performed in 2016 over the course of 12
days (and two more days for assembly/disassembly) using a Bragg detector identical to
the FiFI BDs on STEFF. A schematic diagram of the set-up is shown in Fig. 4.6 and a
photo of FiFI mounted at the focal plane of Lohengrin is shown in Fig. 4.7. For simplicity,
this Bragg detector will be also referred to as FiFI throughout this chapter. The principal
difference between FiFI used at Lohengrin and the ones on STEFF is the addition of two
timing detectors similar to the MCP STOP assemblies on STEFF. These detectors were
separated by a 1 metre-long time-of-flight section to provide velocity measurements. The
aim of the experiment was twofold: the primary aim was to investigate the response of
66 FiFI Characterization at ILL
the BD to varying FF atomic numbers, and the secondary aim was to investigate charge-
changing collisions inside Lohengrin. Lohengrin is a perfect facility for atomic number
investigation, since as described earlier in this chapter the effective charge depends on
velocity and atomic number, and the velocities at Lohengrin are known very precisely,
and can therefore be effectively fixed. The isobaric composition is also quite well
known based on existing yields measurements, so for any known mass the dominant
Z contributions can be identified. Lohengrin is held at a  106 mbar vacuum, and
therefore there remains a low possibility ( 104) that some FF may collide with residual
gas atoms, resulting in charge state alteration, and thus contributing contaminants to
the beam. This low possibility of contamination if not significant for the majority of the
Lohengrin beams, however it may have a measurable impact on yields measurements
in the symmetry region of the fission mass distribution [139]. Such contaminants have
a velocity that is expected to be 2% different from the rest of the beam, and the
time-of-flight section of FiFI was added to investigate this effect.

each of the two volumes there is a vacuum pump, and the two volumes are separated by

is the Bragg detector.
FiFI Characterization at ILL 67
Figure 4.7: A photo of FiFI being mounted at the focal plane of Lohengrin.
During the campaign FiFI was operated at 106 mbar vacuum in the ToF section and
at 100 mbar isobutane pressure in the BD. The MCPs were operated at 2000 V and
the electrostatic mirrors at 4000 V. The timing foils manufactured for the experiment
were made of 300 nm thick formvar, which was aluminized to a thickness of 370
A. The aluminization of the foil was performed using an evaporator and verified using
a precision scale, which provided a sub-1% uncertainty on the average thickness. The
window separating the BD from the ToF section was made of Mylar with a thickness
of 0.5 m, and deposited onto a steel colimator, which matched the dimensions of the
Lohengrin beam at the focal plane, i.e. a 40.8 cm rectangular slit. The BD anode
was set to 1400 V and the Frisch grid to 1200 V. The gas inside the chamber was
circulated at a rate of 14 mbar L s1. The signals from the BD were processed using
Cooknell EC572 charge-sensitive preamplifiers and the waveforms were recorded using
CAEN V1724 ADCs.
As the campaign started, it was quickly noted using the online monitoring system that
the FF energy resolution inside the BD was of the order of a few MeV, considerably
below the expected <1 MeV. The energy distortion was determined to be caused by
68 FiFI Characterization at ILL
the timing foils. An uneven coating of aluminium resulted in straggling of the FF, and
causing a spread in the energy loss in the foils, and therefore in the final deposited
energy in the gas volume. An example of an energy spectrum for identical Lohengrin
settings to Fig. 4.5 before the foil removal is shown in Fig. 4.8, clearly demonstrating
the degraded energy resolution.
Figure 4.8: A spectrum of FF energies measured at the Lohengrin focal plane for a
A = 80 amu, q = 20, E = 80 MeV setting, with the peak mass and energy identification
shown. The spectrum was taken before the removal of the timing foils, showing degraded
energy resolution compared to Fig. 4.5.
The identification and investigation of the resolution degrading, removal of the foils and
the subsequent return of the system to a working vacuum have taken up a considerable
amount of time, resulting in the final analysis focusing on the data collected over a span
of only two days. Consequently, there was a lack of measurements used in the analysis
for the heavy mass region, and the removal of the foils naturally prevented the use of
the ToF section, thus precluding any investigation of charge-changing inside Lohengrin.
4.4 Data Processing
Over the course of the measurement campaign 250 GB of data were accumulated and 200
combinations of Lohengrin settings were used, however only 60 of those were performed
following the foil removal. From these 60 settings, 40 were selected for the final analysis,
while the remaining 20 were either in the symmetry region and had insufficient statis-
tics, or the Lohengrin magnets had not finished re-configuring after settings changes,
subsequently compromising reliability of the beam composition.
The data were read into and analyzed using Manchester in-house fission event analysis
software called gavSort [140], which is written in C with a TK/TCL frontend and
FiFI Characterization at ILL 69
capability for creating and managing databases written in MariaDB [141]. The soft-
ware allows users to create custom files called user sortfiles for reading and processing
data. The sortfile that was written for the campaign discussed in this chapter, read in
Frisch grid and anode traces recorded during the experiment and applied a sequence of
digital filters to the anode signal with the aim of extracting various signal properties.
Typically when ion stopping is investigated, e.g. using Bragg peak spectroscopy, the
two immediately apparent observables of interest are range in the medium and energy
loss. Following the same reasoning, the goal in processing Lohengrin data was extrac-
tion of signal parameters related to these two quantities. Data processing aimed to
identify the energy deposited by the fragment in the BD through ionization Qmax, and
the maximal slope of the anode signal, proportional to the maximum energy loss by
a fragment, dQ/dt|max. Furthermore, another parameter of interest extracted alongside
the energy-related parameters is t1090, or the risetime of the signal from 10% to 90%
of its maximal amplitude, which can be related to FF range if the electron signal drift
velocity is known. A diagram of the parameters of interest demonstrated with an anode
trace is shown in Fig. 4.9. The filter sequence is shown in Fig. 4.10 along with the final
observables extracted from them. Each filters operation and effect are described below.

4.4.1 Differentiator
The first filter applied to an anode trace is the differentiator, which is used to filter out
low-frequency noise (such as ground loops) below some cut-off frequency f , and to set
the signal baseline to zero. The filter is recursive, and a point along the differentiated
trace dQ/dt at index i can be described in terms of two points along the raw trace Q and
the previous differentiated point dQ/dt[i 1] using the following expression [142]:

Figure 4.11: An unfiltered anode trace is shown in black alongside a differentiator

The functioning of a differentiating filter depends strongly on the frequency parameter,
which, if set too wide, can remove the signal entirely, and conversely a very narrow
setting would merely reproduce the input signal frequencies, resulting in no filtering.
The differentiated pulse shapes for a variety of frequency settings are shown in Fig. 4.12
alongside an anode pulse that has already been filtered for noise for comparison. It is
evident from the plot that the smaller f is (i.e. the wider the time window for filtering is),
the more similar the differentiated pulse is to the anode pulse, and no filtering is being
done. Conversely, for larger f less signal is preserved. Since the differentiated amplitude
dQ/dt|max is the value of particular interest taken from the differentiator, a plot similar to
Fig. 4.12 is shown for reference in Fig. 4.13, showing the trend of reduction in dQ/dt|max
with increasing f .

An intermediate range of f values was chosen for further investigation by considering the
width of the anode signal risetime (150 channels). The differentiating window should
be appreciably smaller that the anode risetime, so as not to distort the detail of energy
loss during stopping. A plot of several f values in the chosen range is shown in Fig. 4.14
for several fragments with a similar velocity. It is evident from the plot that within the
chosen range, the separation of fragments is fairly insensitive to f , and subsequently a
value of 0.01 (16-channel window) was chosen.

4.4.2 Integrator
The integrating filter is considerably simpler than the differentiator, as it simply does a
running sum of dQ/dt[i] values over the length of the differentiated pulse. The recursive
formula for the filters functionality can be written as
Q[i] =
[i] +
[j]. (4.6)
The resulting pulse is an amplified version of the raw anode pulse without the noise that
has been removed at the differentiator stage. An example of the resulting pulse along
with the initial raw anode pulse from Fig. 4.11 is shown in Fig. 4.15.

has also been amplified by a factor of 16.
4.4.3 Chebyshev Filter
Following the application of the high-pass filtering, a Chebyshev low-pass filter was used.
Low-pass filters are used to remove high-frequency contributions to the pulse, such as
radio-frequency noise. The settings of the filter has been adapted from Ref. [142]. Low-
pass Chebyshev filter settings include three parameters: cut-off frequency, ripple and
pole. Cut-off frequency represents a frequency threshold beyond which the contributions
to the pulse are suppressed by the filter. A plot of frequency response of a typical
Chebyshev filter is shown in Fig. 4.16 [142]. The plot shows a sharp reduction (called
roll-off) in amplitude contributions (shown as a percentage on the y-axis) beyond the
cut-off frequency of 0.2. The functionality of the Chebyshev filter is a trade-off between
the sharpness of the roll-off and ripple. Ripple can be seen as wave-like structures
before the roll-off, and each ripple structure represents exaggerated contribution of a
given frequency, which is undesirable. Ripples can be present in either the passband
or the stopband (i.e. frequency range where contributions are retained or filtered out),
corresponding to either Type 1 (used in this work) or Type 2 Chebyshev filters. Ref. [142]
recommends a ripple of 0.5% (a very small contribution to noise compared to a typical
Bragg detector signal, where noise levels of a few percent of Qmax are typical). Since
ionization signals are very slow (typically a few microseconds), a low cut-off frequency
of 0.1 was set.
The Chebyshev filter pole is a more complicated parameter, which is described in detail
in Ref. [142]. In simple terms, a filter has a transfer function, which defines for a

settings and a cut-off frequency of 0.2. Figure adapted from Ref. [142].
given input frequency what its contribution in the output will be. The function is
typially expressed as a ratio of two complex polynomials, and therefore the transfer
functions zeroes correspond to numerators being equal to zero, and poles occur when
the denominator is zero. By defining the poles and zeroes of a filter, one can define
the transfer function. i.e. the action of the filter. An increase in the number of poles
allows for a more complicated transfer function with a faster roll-off, so a maximum
6-pole setting suggested by Ref. [142] was chosen. A trace that has been processed with
a Type 1 6-pole Chebyshev filter with the aforementioned ripple and cut-off frequency
settings is shown in Fig. 4.17, and a comparison of the trace in the vicinity of the
maximal amplitude following integration with and without Chebyshev filtering is shown
in Fig. 4.18. The latter plot shows clearly the reduction in high-frequency components
of the pulse, with only slowly-varying components remaining.

4.4.4 Ballistic Deficit Correction
STEFF and FiFI BD signals are processed using charge-sensitive preamplifiers, which
integrate signal from the electrons present in the space between the anode and the
grid as they drift towards the anode. The preamplifier has a time decay constant, which
determines the rate at which the exponential decay of a collected signal is discharged from
FiFI Characterization at ILL 77
the preamplifier (for Cooknell EC572 preamplifiers used on FiFI, time decay constant
is 50 s). Signal decay occurs throughout the collection of the signal, resulting in a
cumulative pulse height deficit across the trace. If the signal collection time for various
signals is similar, this pulse height loss is not significant, since it will be an approximately
constant fraction for all the collected signals [90]. FF, however, arrive at a variety
of masses, velocities and charge states, resulting in a large variation in stopping time
inside the gas, and subsequently considerable variation in electron drift time (the signals
collected during the Lohengrin campaign showed drift time of 1.8 s with a variation
of 20% for various FF).
The variation in drift time necessitated a correction, which was applied using the bal-
listic deficit filter, which restore the maximum amplitude of a pulse and removes the
preamplifier decay tail. The filter function in calculating an element Qbd[i] of a ballistic
deficit corrected trace can be written as
Qbd[i] = Qbd[i 1] +Q[i]Q[i 1] + fBDQ[i]. (4.7)
Here, fbd is a ballistic deficit filter frequency setting based on the preamplifier decay
constant. The frequency setting used throughout this work for the ballistic deficit filter
is 0.0004, which approximately corresponds to 1/ , where  is the mean preamplifier
decay time, which is 2275 ns in the case of this work. A comparison of a trace before
and after the filter is shown in Fig. 4.19.

4.4.5 Moving Window Deconvolution
The ballistic deficit filter corrects the entire pulse for the preamplifier decay, making it
useful for extracting dQ/dt|max, which originates from the pulse rising edge. However, it
is less reliable for extracting Qmax, which is the peak of the pulse, a value which can
fluctuate depending on noise remaining after the filtering. The ballistic deficit correction
does not filter out the remaining noise, and an alternative method of addressing the
pulse height deficit caused by the preamplifier decay is used in the form of the Moving
Window Deconvolution (MWD) filter [143]. The MWD filter, as the name suggest, uses
an averaging window, making it less sensitive to any noise, and the peak of the MWD
pulse corresponds to Qmax corrected for pre-amplifier decay. MWD filter can be written
Qmwd[i] = Q[i]Q[im] +
  Q
, (4.8)
where m is the width of the averaging window in channels (250 in the case of this work),
and Q is a running sum of averaged windows expressed as
Q = Q+
Q[i]Q[im]
. (4.9)
An example of a trace produced by MWD along with the output trace of a ballistic
deficit filter are shown in Fig. 4.20.

4.4.6 Frisch Grid Inefficiency Correction
Another effect that may alter extracted Qmax of a trace is the Frisch grid inefficiency.
Section 3.1.5.2 discusses the shielding of a BD anode by the grid, a task with an associ-
ated efficiency which depends on the grid geometry [144]. Since Frisch grids in the case
of all the BDs in this work are grids of wires (mesh configurations are also frequently
used [145]), the spacing between the wires determines how much signal from the electron
cloud following FF stopping is leaked through, resulting in excess in the signal amplitude
and subsequently overestimation of deposited energy. A method has been prescribed by
Gook et al. [144] for correcting the leakage during pulse-shape analysis stage using the
expression
Qcorr[i] =
Q[i] + Qc[i]
, (4.10)
where Qcorr[i] is an element of the corrected anode trace,  is the inefficiency parameter,
and Qc is an element of the cathode signal, which is dominated by the ion signal and
gets subtracted to compensate for the ion signal leaking onto the anode. The BD on
FiFI is not configured for collection of the cathode signal, as the ions are grounded using
the gas window, so the cathode signal was reconstructed using the method prescribed
in Ref. [146], which consists of summing the Frisch grid and anode signals and then
multiplying the result by 1 to represent the opposite polarity of the cathode signal to
the grid and the anode. The calculation of  was complicated by insufficient baseline
collection time set in the ILL DAQ for the anode signals during the Lohengrin campaign,
so the parameter was determined in Manchester after the Lohengrin campaign to be 8.8%
based on FiFI measurements using a 252Cf source [147]. No changes to the BD have
been implemented between the two campaign and the grid investigation.

4.5 Data Analysis
Filtered traces have been written into a MariaDB database using gavSort, and the
database allowed compilation of the data into matrices. The matrices were produced
on a run-by-run basis and contained traces for anode and grid as rows and maximal
filtered anode amplitude (i.e. detected energy) as columns. That allowed the use of
clean energy spectra, where the FF masses are easily identified as shown in the example
in Fig. 4.5, to cut mass/energy gates to retrieve anode and grid traces averaged over
all the FF that were included in the gate. This process could perhaps be more easily
understood graphically, as shown in Fig. 4.22. The intensity of Lohengrin beams allowed
for substantial averaging, with a typical gated trace being averaged over 8000 FF in a
narrow energy gate of 300 keV.
FiFI Characterization at ILL 81

averaged anode and Frisch grid traces.
4.5.1 Defining Parameters
Once the averaged traces were retrieved, the parameters of interest (Qmax, dQ/dt|max and
t1090) described earlier in Fig. 4.9 were extracted from them. Due to the averaging
over a large number of signals, it was deemed acceptable to interpolate linearly between
the data points in order to increase precision of the timing related variables dQ/dt|max
and t1090.
The Mylar gas window used during the Lohengrin campaign was not aluminized and
subsequently was not grounded, which led to charge accumulation during the campaign
and introduced gain drift into the signal. The drift of the energy peaks was monitored
using dedicated gavSort functions during data processing and was found to be not
significant over the course of a single Lohengrin run (runs were typically brief, lasting
82 FiFI Characterization at ILL
20 mins), however the position of the various mass/energy peaks between runs with the
same settings changed considerably. The effect is demonstrated in Fig. 4.23, showing
that the effect is less significant over shorter time intervals, but becomes considerable
over the course of days.

Detector gain has a defining effect on energy measurements, so if FF energy loss, rep-
resented by dQ/dt|max, was to be considered for investigating the influence of atomic
number on BD signals, a gain drift correction would be necessary. Such a correction was
accomplished by considering the other energy-dependent parameter that would suffer
from gain drifts similarly, i.e. Qmax, and combining it with energy loss into a single
parameter defined as
dQ/dt|max
. (4.11)
Since Qmax is a measure of FF energy deposited in the BD, the division by this param-
eter introduces dependence on FF mass and velocity into . Furthermore, the energy
deposited in the ionization chamber will not be the same as the kinetic energy of FF in
Lohengrin, since the FFs will lose energy in the gas window. These considerations led
to modification of  by the FF kinetic energy to shape the final parameter for energy
loss consideration, defined as
A(vcorr)
, (4.12)
FiFI Characterization at ILL 83
where vcorr is FF velocity corrected by FF energy loss in the window. The form of the
parameter raises two considerations: the method for correcting velocity, and the impli-
cations of dividing Qmax by kinetic energy. The velocity correction was implemented
using SRIM-2013 [128] simulations of energy loss. SRIM is known to provide only
approximate values of stopping for FF due to its reliance on LSS formalism [128], and
a further discussion of SRIM is provided later in this chapter. SRIM accuracy was
deemed acceptable for calculating a correction factor, however, since no velocity was
corrected by more than 13% (the case for the slowest, heaviest FF), and most of them
were corrected by less than 5%. SRIM is considered accurate to within 20-30%, result-
ing in an uncertainty of a few percent on the final energy loss parameter, which is still
acceptable compared to typical energy loss models.
The division of Qmax by kinetic energy may seem redundant at a glance, however con-
sidering the origins of the two provides insight into the effect of the division. Qmax is
linearly proportional to the energy deposited in the BD through ionization, while the
kinetic energy it is divided by is calculated on the bases of Lohengrin settings and SRIM,
thus representing the energy one expects. The ratio of the two will therefore represent
any BD energy loss effects that are not ionization of isobutane. These effects, such as
charge exchange and polarization, are all dependent on the effective charge of the FF,
and therefore contain information of interest to the investigation.
Since the range is proportional to inertial mass, a modification has also been applied to
the risetime parameter, however since it is insensitive to gain, the risetimes were simply
normalized in mass to form a new parameter  defined as
t1090
. (4.13)
4.5.2 Fitting the Data
The two parameters chosen for investigation,  and  , were calculated for all the FF
in the light and heavy fragment data. Since both of the parameters are expected to be
dependent on FF velocity and Z, plots of the results were made against the Lohengrin
velocity setting v, considered henceforth as a fraction of the speed of light in vacuum c for
simplicity. For each mass an average atomic number Z was assigned based on the JEFF-
3.1 database [112] by considering 7 isobars with the highest yield and taking a yield-
weighted average of them. All the mass settings used in the analysis were predominantly
composed of one FF Z with small contributions by near-Z isobars (standard deviation
in charge assignment was Z 0.2). A plot of the results is shown in Fig. 4.24.
84 FiFI Characterization at ILL
The uncertainties on  and  were calculated based on uncertainties in the total de-
posited energy E and uncertainty in energy loss dE , while the <1% uncertainties in
the FF velocities and masses selected by Lohengrin were considered negligible. E was
calculated as the standard deviation of the Gaussian fit to mass peaks divided by
where N is the number of counts in the energy gate, from which average waveforms
were extracted. dE is uncertainty in identifying the maximum derivative of the rising
edge of the anode trace, which depends on energy resolution, maximum derivative was
calculated and was taken as E divided by the maximum derivative, i.e.
dE =
. (4.14)
Since  is the ratio of energy loss to total energy, its uncertainty was calculated in
quadrature based on E and dE as follows:
 =
dQ/dt|max E
t2max
. (4.15)
Here, tmax is the time of anode trace derivative maximum.
The uncertainty in  is similar to the uncertainty in maximum derivative, as it relies on
identification of points along the trace, i.e. the positions the 10% and 90% of maximum
amplitude. The identification relies on energy resolution in identifying the position of
the maximum, and therefore the uncertainty in  is written as
 = E
dQ/dt|10%
dQ/dt|90%
. (4.16)

86 FiFI Characterization at ILL
The data were fitted with a function in order to examine the behaviour of  and  with
Z. The functional form was taken to be some power dependence of the parameters on v
and Z, since both energy loss and range were expected to go to zero if the initial velocity
is zero, a condition that power dependence satisfies. The simplest functional form then
is of the form
f1(v, Z) = aZ
v , (4.17)
where a,  and  are fitted parameters. The fit converged with a reduced chi-squared
of 2 for  and 9 for . In an effort to improve the poor agreement of the fit with ,
two following modified forms of the function f1 were considered:
f2(v, Z) = aZ
v+Z , (4.18)
f3(v, Z) = aZ
+vv . (4.19)
In both of these new fitting functions, fitting parameter  is added with one of the two
fitted variables in order to represent the variation in charge with velocity, since the two
are not independent. Fitting form f2 resulted in worse reduced chi-squared of 4 for 
and 11 for  and therefore any further inquiry with it was discontinued. Fitting form
f3 improved the 
 fit, which converged with 2red. 4, but it made virtually no difference
to the fit to  , and therefore the simpler form f1 was retained for that parameter. The
dashed lines in Fig. 4.24 show the final fits to the data: form f1 for  and form f3 for
. The final values of the fitting parameters are shown in Table 4.1.

4.5.3 Comparison with SRIM-2013
All the various Z and v combinations shown in Fig. 4.24 have been simulated in SRIM
to compare the toolkit used commonly in research and industry to the experimental
results. Extracted values of  and  for SRIM results are shown in Fig. 4.25 along with
the experimental values.

shown in coloured dashed lines. Colours for the SRIM simulations and the correspond-
ing fragments in the data are indicated with the same colour.
FiFI Characterization at ILL 89
The SRIM results show some agreement in trends and values for the heavy fragment
results and approximately correct values for the light fragments for the  parameter,
however there is no agreement between SRIM and data in either trends or values of  .
The exact cause of discrepancies between SRIM and data is hard to pinpoint, however
SRIM simulated the starting FF as stripped, and equilibrating the charge inside the
gas, whereas Lohengrin FF arrive with a certain ionic charge q, which is altered by the
window.
An investigation of FF ranges and energy losses predicted by SRIM and data available
at the time had been conducted by Filliatre et al. [148] in 2013. Simulated ranges were
found to be overestimated by 10-20% and energy loss was underestimated by up to 23%
compared to the results for range measured by M. Pickering and J.M. Alexander [149]
and energy loss measurements by M. Forte et al [150]. The current data show the oppo-
site effect to the previous results, whereby energy loss-like parameter is overestimated,
while the range-like parameter is also overestimated. This warrants further investigation,
since the two values are related. A numerical integration of the form
Range =
dE/dx(Z, v)
dE  vdA 
vdAQmax
(Z, v)
dv, (4.20)
was attempted, where  and Qmax have been calibrated from charge to energy, E0 is
the Lohengrin energy setting corrected for the energy loss in the window, and vd is the
electron drift velocity in BD. The drift velocity was determined for a BD with identical
field and gas configuration to FiFI, and was found to be 3.1190.068 cm/s [151]. The
result of the integral was found to vary greatly depending on the choice of the final
velocity of the FF, which suggests that the fit cannot be safely extrapolated far beyond
the range of values over which it has converged. For this reason, a non-zero final velocity
was chosen as 10% of the initial velocity, resulting in an agreement between A and the
integral of 20%.
A direct comparison of the energy loss parameter with the results of Forte et al. is
difficult, since the experiment in the earlier work averages energy loss over FF range,
whereas the work here extracts only the maximal energy loss. A comparison with the
data of Pickering and Alexander is also complicated by differing definitions of range,
since in their work FF from a 252Cf source entered a volume of gas and were swept
perpendicularly onto a foil, and the position of various FF along the strips of foil was
identified using gamma-ray spectroscopy. The present work does not consider the total
range, since for pulse-shape analysis routines the resulting range values would be very
sensitive to the definition of the beginning and end of the electron signal deposition onto
the anode, a parameter which is difficult to quantify. This difference in range definition

however does not prevent a general comparison of the data, and a plot of reduced ranges
(range divided by gas density, 0.2330.001 g/cm3) from Pickering and Alexanders

A full comparison of the results could be potentially achieved by considering a scaling
parameter to compensate for the difference in range definition. Nonetheless, the overall
arrangement of the various fill gases considered in Ref. [149] and this work is confirmed
by SRIM (with the exception of argon and neon), although the values between the two
experimental results and SRIM still disagree. The current data also shows much less
variation in range with mass than the previous data. Several possible factors affecting
the measurement of range in this work have been identified: incorrect estimate of the
drift velocity, diffusion of charge in the volume of the detector, and risetime distortion
due to filters.
The drift velocity measurement has been made for a different ionization chamber filled
with isobutane and with the same reduced field as FiFI during the Lohengrin campaign.
The drift velocity was determined using the time between the leading edge of the Frisch
grid signal and its minimum, i.e. the time the charge is sensed in the chamber and the
FiFI Characterization at ILL 91
time all of it crosses the grid, having traversed the entire depth of the chambers active
volume. The determined velocity has been found to be consistent with the literature
values and magboltz simulations for the reduced field settings and the details of the
work can be found in Ref. [151].
Charge diffusion has also been previously addressed using magboltz [77] for STEFF
Bragg arm ionization chamber, which has the same reduced field as the experiment
presented in this chapter. Charge was calculated to spread by 0.3 cm for a typical
fragment. Ranges of fragments in this work have been measured as 5 cm, meaning that
the ionization electrons traverse 9 cm to reach the anode. Resulting charge diffusion
then contributes 3% spread in risetimes. Assuming that electrons spread isotropically,
this effect will average out, contributing to the measured uncertainties, but not to the
risetime measured from an averaged pulse.
4.5.3.1 Filter Correction
Noise-correcting filters (differentiator, integrator and Chebyshev filters) were tested us-
ing a pre-filtered pulse. Such a pulse was chosen, since it would be smoother than a raw
data pulse, and therefore allow for easier measurement of pulse height, and therefore
10%-90% risetime. The pulse was compressed by factors of 0.5-1.5 in steps of 0.1 to
produce artificial pulses with different risetimes. Each of the compressed pulses had its
t1090 measured, and then was processed with the noise-correcting filters to extract post-
filter t1090. A plot of the resulting filtered 10%-90% risetimes against their pre-filter
counterparts for each degree of compression is shown in Fig 4.27 along with the linear fit.
The linear fit was then used as a correcting formula which decreased the range values
by 5%.

4.6 Conclusion
An experiment was performed at Lohengrin, whereby various FF with various average
atomic numbers Z have been identified, and the ionization traces extracted from FiFI
BD were processed with digital filters to extract three parameters from averaged mass-
gated pulses: maximal energy, maximum energy loss and risetime. These were fitted in
powers of Z and v for future BD calibration. The results have also been compared to
SRIM, which was found to be in considerable disagreement and also to previous results,
which showed agreement in trends. Possible contributions to the differences between
the measured results and the literature values have been considered and accounted for.
The results presented in this chapter have been published in Nuclear Instruments and
Methods A [121] and a follow-up proposal for examining the response of the BD for more
heavy and symmetry-region FF for different fill gases, as well as a further investigation of
charge-changing collisions in Lohengrin, has also been accepted by ILL for the summer
2020 reactor cycle. Additional data from the follow-up experiment will provide further
values for range and energy loss measurements for the FF stopping studies, and offer a
new set of calibration parameters for common BD fill gases.

As mentioned previously, STEFF has been used at n ToF to perform two experiments
on 235U fission products. The n ToF Facility is a neutron spallation source located at
CERN, built following a proposal by Rubbia et al. [152] and operating since 2001 [153].
The facility provides beams of neutrons covering a wide energy range from thermal to
1 GeV [154]. For its operations, the facility relies on proton beams from the CERN
Proton Synchrotron (PS), which is part of the LHC acceleration chain. The 20 GeV/c
proton pulses from the PS are sent out every 1.2 s to a number of experimental facilities
around CERN. Some of the proton pulses are sent to the East Area Experimental Hall
of CERN, which have different beam requirements from n ToF. The beams redirected
back from the East Area are referred to as parasitic, and are less intense than the
beams sent directly to n ToF, which are called dedicated. Dedicated pulses have a
higher number of protons, 71012 protons per pulse (ppp) compared to 31012 in
the parasitic pulses, as well as a more consistent time distribution: both have an r.m.s.
pulse length of 7 ns, although the parasitic pulses may show small variations depending
on the proton use in the East Area [155]. PS proton pulses are frequently referred to as
bunches, which is the term that will be used throughout this work.
The neutrons are produced by spallation when the proton beam impinges on a 1.3
tonne lead target encased in aluminium [156] [157], yielding 300 neutrons per incident
proton [158]. Spallation involving a 20 GeV proton is a complicated process involving
product nuclei populated at very high energies and relatively low angular momenta
(due to parton interactions) compared to reactions using beams of heavier projectiles
96 235U Campaign at n ToF
[159]. The spallation process is shown schematically in Fig. 5.1. The dynamics of
spallation can be modeled in two steps by first considering the projectile interactions
within the volume of the target nucleus and then by examining the de-excitation of the
residual nucleus [160] [159]. In the high-energy regime of up to a few GeV [161], the
first step can be modeled using the Intranuclear Cascade Model (ICM), which treats
the projectile interaction as a series of quasi-independent nucleon-nucleon and pion-
nucleon interactions within the nuclear medium [161]. Note, that in the case of the
very high-energy PS 20 GeV/c beam further extension has to be applied to the ICM
to account for the parton interactions [162]. The cascade of interactions can produce
particles, such as pions and kaons [158], and also leads to knock-out reactions, where
protons and neutrons are removed from the nucleus [161]. Within ICM, the cascade is
typically propagated until the total energy of the particles that compose the cascade falls
below some threshold or the cascade timespan has exceeded the time it would take for
a nucleus to thermalize [159]. Once the cascade has stopped, the residual nucleus may
de-excite by emitting photons, neutrons, protons or even clusters of nucleons (which can
be treated as highly-asymmetric fission [159]). The nucleus can also fission, although
this process is hindered by particle emission in a manner similar to multichance fission
[159]. Furthermore, multi-fragmentation can occur, whereby the residue dissociates into
a number of light- and medium-mass nuclei [161].
Figure 5.1: A diagram of the main stages in the process of spallation. The diagram
shows a proton incident onto a heavy nucleus, causing an intranuclear cascade leading
to a production of several different particle types, including neutrons. The remaining
excited nucleus then de-excites by cluster, particle or photon emission, leading to a
residue, which can undergo fission or break up further by emitting particles, fragments
or photons [163].
The lead target discussed in this work is a cylinder, that is 40 cm long and 60 cm in
diameter [158]. The target is cooled by 1 cm of water and has a 4 cm thick exchangeable
235U Campaign at n ToF 97
additional layer of moderator [157], which can be de-mineralized water or a water solu-
tion with a 1.28% admixture of H3BO3 [158]. The boron in the solution is 10B, and it
is useful due to its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section, 3860 barn for (n,)
reaction with a thermal neutron in JEFF-3.3 [11], which serves to reduce the thermal
neutron contribution to the flux and moreover through dilution reduces the probability
of neutron capture in hydrogen in water, a reaction that may produce a 2.223 MeV
gamma ray with a cross-section of 16.7 barn [11], which contributes to gamma back-
ground [158]. Borated water is only applied to the forward face of the target, precluding
its use for background reduction for STEFF (the position of STEFF relative to the
target is described below). The orientation of the target and the moderator layers are
shown in Fig. 5.2 along with the directions of the two neutron beamlines introduced
below.

relative to the proton beam. Two layers of moderator as well as the two neutron
beamline directions are indicated. Adapted from [164].
The additional layers of moderator can only by added to the side of the circular face of
the target that is opposite of the beam entry point, but not to the target sides. When
the current spallation target, the second one to be used at n ToF, was installed in 2008,
the facility only had one beamline, Experimental ARea 1 (EAR1), and the moderator is
positioned to face it. Since then, in 2014 a new beamline has been constructed, named
EAR2. The orientation of the two beamlines relative to the proton beam and the target
is shown in Fig. 5.3. Since STEFF to date has only been used in EAR2, the details of
EAR1 are omitted in this thesis.

beamlines, EAR1 and EAR2, along with their main components. The inset at the top
of the diagram shows the orientation of the spallation target relative to the proton
beam and also the direction of flight of the neutrons in the two neutron beamlines
(while overall spallation neutron emission occurs in all directions, and is forward-peaked
relative to the proton beam). The inset in the bottom shows the scale of the two
beamlines. Adapted from [158].
EAR2 beamline points vertically upwards from the target and has a length of 20 m [156].
This beamline has a sweeping magnet and two collimators. The magnet is located 10.4 m
above the target and is composed of 168 radiation-resistant Sm2Co17 blocks arranged to
produce a 0.287 Tm dipole magnetic field around a 1.134-meter section of the beamline.
Immediately after the magnet lies the filter station, where filters for attenuating gamma-
rays or filtering specific neutron energy ranges can be inserted into the beam. The first
collimator is located 7.4 m above the lead target and is a meter-long iron cylinder with a
20 cm inner diameter. The second collimator is 15.04 m above the target and is 3 m long.
It is a vacuum vessel with an outer diameter of 680 mm and its volume is subdivided
into 4 sections, each of which is chicane-shaped. The first 2 m of the second collimator
is made of iron, followed by 60 cm of borated polyethylene (B-PE) and concluded by
40 cm of boron carbide (B4C). The second collimator can be set to either a wide or
a narrow setting, depending on the experimental flux requirements. The wide setting
produces an opening of 70 mm, and the narrow settings reduces it to 20 mm. Following
the second collimator, the beamline enters a room where experiments can be mounted
on the beamline coming out of the floor and connected to the further beamline coming
down from the ceiling, which leads to the beam dump. The beam dump is housed on the
roof of the EAR2 building. The 400400400 mm3 core of the beam dump is made of
B-PE, which slows and absorbs beam neutrons as well as neutrons that backscattered in
the beam dump. The core contains a hole with a diameter of 340 mm and depth of 250
235U Campaign at n ToF 99
mm, into which the final section of the beamline is inserted. The core is surrounded by
160016001600 mm3 volume of iron for absorbing fast neutrons and gamma rays. The
final layer of shielding is made of concrete and has the dimensions of 320032002400
mm3 [156].
Due to its proximity to the spallation target, EAR2 has superior neutron flux compared
to EAR1. Fig. 5.4 shows neutron flux as a function of neutron energy for the two areas.
The higher thermal flux at EAR2 is the result of the lack of borated water moderator
available for that area. As for the neutrons, the shorter flightpath of EAR2 means that
background radiation in that experimental area is also greater. Of particular importance
to STEFF is the gamma-ray background. The gamma background time distributions
for EAR2 are shown in Fig. 5.5 along with the neutron time-of-flight.
Figure 5.4: Comparison of neutron flux at EAR1 (blue) and EAR2 (red) at the n ToF
Facility [158]. Note the considerable increase in flux in EAR2, in particular at near-
thermal energies. Also shown are absorption dips at neutron energies above 103 eV
from elastic scattering reactions with trace 55Mn in the target shielding, and above
104 eV from (n,) reactions with 27Al, which is a major component of the material
surrounding the target.

The contributions from prompt spallation gamma rays and delayed gammas originating
from post-spallation de-excitation are indicated. Also shown is the neutron time-of-
flight distribution with arrows indicating some neutron energies for reference.
100 235U Campaign at n ToF
The proximity of EAR2 to the spallation target has several downsides. Firstly, the
shorter flightpath means that the neutron energy resolution is lower at EAR2, since
neutrons traveling at different velocities have less time to separate from one another
within the pulse. Secondly, fast neutrons are also less spatially separated from the
fast spallation products, in particular gamma-rays. When spallation occurs at n ToF,
a large burst of spallation photons travels down the beamlines accompanied by further
photons emitted from the surrounding materials by charged particles and neutrons. This
radiation burst is called a -flash, and it has the effect of saturating most detectors
that are in its way, and the fast neutrons accompanying the photons may also eject
charged particles from detector materials via (n,p) and (n,) reaction channels, further
contributing to detector suppression. Depending on detector type, this results in a
period of paralysis of varying duration, where saturated detectors cannot accept any
new signals. A typical pulse shape of a -flash signal in a NaI detector is shown in Fig.
5.6 along with a zoomed-in trace of a signal from the same crystal immediately after
the -flash, showing a featureless spectrum in Fig 5.7. A recovered response of a NaI
crystal in the thermal region (10 ms after spallation) showing a number of gamma-ray
signals with a typical pulse shape is shown in Fig. 5.8.

The x-axis is time in nanoseconds and y-axis is signal amplitude in arbitrary units.

bunches.

5.1.1 n ToF Data Processing
Data writing in the n ToF data acquisition (DAQ) system is triggered from the pick-up
(typically referred to as PKUP) signal, a wall current monitor detector which uses the
current induced by the proton beam in the beamline walls to measure the intensity of the
proton pulse and signal the arrival of the proton bunch at the lead target. Once the data
acquisition has been triggered by the PKUP, it begins recording data streams from any
detectors set in the DAQ for the next 32 ms. Detectors at n ToF can be configured with
a zero-suppression setting, which when set represents the amount of time data streams
should be opened for if the detector signal passes a certain threshold. Alternatively, it
can be set to 0, so that DAQ writes raw data for the entire 32 ms window. The digitizing
of detector output at n ToF can be done using several different ADC cards, and the work
presented here involves the use of four ADCs: one SP-device model ADQ412 and three
SP-device model ADQ14 (the cards are 12- and 14-bit respectively). The digitizers are
specified for each detector in the DAQ control along with the dynamic ranges, pre- and
post-samples, rates etc. Once the digitizers convert the analog input into a digital trace,
the data are timestamped and transferred to the CERN Advanced Storage (CASTOR)
facility, where all the streams are written to magnetic tape for secure storage.
Stored data are subdivided into runs, with a single run representing the DAQ being set
to start and then, typically after 4 hours of data collection, stopped. The duration of a
run varies depending on whether the experiment is running as planned, availability of
proton beams, DAQ performance etc. Each run is further subdivided into segments. A
segment represents 20 proton bunches, meaning that every 20 bunches DAQ sends the
data to CASTOR, which prevents significant data loss if an error occurs late into a run.
After storage on CASTOR, the data can then be retrieved using a Linux-based interface
called LXPLUS. The interface provides utilities for staging data, i.e. re-converting it
from tape storage to digital traces, and then downloading it in .raw.finished format.
The staging process can be slow (up to several days of waiting time), depending on the
volume of data requested and on current demand from other users. n ToF data can
be converted from raw format (binary stream) into a format accepted by ROOT [165],
102 235U Campaign at n ToF
CERN C++-based histogramming and data management software. The conversion is
done using a C++ code called raw2root, which relies on n ToF libraries ntoflib to
interpret the binary stream and the headers. The code provides an interface, which
reads the raw data and accepts a customizable text file called UserInput as input.
This text file provides various settings for processing of different detector streams. The
raw2root code contains a class called detector, which can be set to accept various
derived class implementation files using UserInput by specifying the derived classs
name after the name of a detector, the output of which should be processed. For example,
a large number of n ToF experiments including STEFF rely on the Pulse-Shape Analysis
(PSA) derived class of detector, which is used for extracting signal parameters, such
as amplitudes and times. When UserInput is set to PSA, raw2root sets detector
classs definitions to be implemented from the PSA C++ routine. More details about
the functioning of the PSA routine can be found in [166]. The interaction of the C++
files comprising raw2root is shown in Fig. 5.9. The final output of rawr2root is a
ROOT file, which contains a list of all the fit results for all the detectors processed with
235U Campaign at n ToF 103

The blue dashed box shows the data writing part, which occurs during the experiment,
while the pink dashed box shows the data sorting component, which converts stored
experimental data into a format fit for analysis. The detector signals are written by
DAQ to CASTOR and can be staged onto LXPLUS for access in .raw.finished
format. The resulting raw data files can be read using ntoflib libraries, which pass
the data to raw2root codes. These codes use a text file called UserInput to inform
them which derived class of detector class to use, which guides how the signals are
processed. The final result is a ROOT file containing processed signals.

5.2 2016 Campaign Data Processing
The 2016 campaign of 235U measurements with STEFF was allocated 30 days of beam-
time and received 1.531018 protons on target. The 235U target used during the cam-
paign was 81 mm in diameter with a thickness of 100 g/cm2, composed of 93% en-
riched 235UO2. Uranium was electroplated onto a supporting backing of 0.7 m-thick
aluminium. A photograph of the target is shown in Fig. 5.11. The target was aligned
inside STEFF as shown in Fig. 5.10, i.e. at 45 relative to the neutron beam facing
FiFI Bragg arm entrance. This meant that the FF would have to pass through some
additional material due to the target angle to get into the main arms, but would have
the clearest path into the FiFI Bragg arm. This alignment also precluded the use of
FiFI Hipps arm, since the target holder faced in that direction, so FiFI Hipps STOP,
Frisch grid and anode were excluded from data analysis.

Figure 5.11: A photograph of the uranium target used in STEFF during the 2016
campaign at n ToF. The yellow deposit is uranium oxide deposited onto aluminium foil,
which is mounted onto the target holder. The uneven surface of the foil occurred due
to the unusually large diameter of the target for the thin target support clamps. The
foil developed wrinkles when the clamp was tightened.
The analysis of the first n ToF campaign using STEFF in 2015 was complicated by
the large data volumes collected (500 TB). The details of the processing of the data
are presented in [21]. The target for the 2016 campaign was considerably larger (the
target in 2015 was 33 mm in diameter), and a large second collimator in EAR2 (70 mm
opening) was used, so a considerable increase in data volumes was expected. However,
the campaign in 2015 relied only on zero-suppression in the DAQ to perform data cuts,
but otherwise it ran in an essentially triggerless fashion (except for the PKUP trigger to
DAQ), so in order to reduce the amount of data that was stored, a second-level trigger
(Master trigger) was implemented, that would suppress DAQ writing unless a signal
from any of the four Frisch grids on STEFF is registered. The grids are used to create
a Master trigger signal which indicates that there has been a fission event and opens
the DAQ channels for recording over an interval of 30 s with pre- and postsample
durations relative to the Master depending on the detector type. If a second Master
trigger was set off during the 30 s window, the window would be extended to 60 s.
The second-level trigger method prevented the DAQ from acquiring data over the entire
32 ms window typical to n ToF, or recording signals from background gamma rays or
spontaneous emission in the timing detectors, when there has been no fission within a
few microseconds, thus reducing the final data volume. The configuration of electronics
for producing Master triggers is discussed in [77]. The windows set for recording various
detector signals were broad (e.g. 2.2 s window was set for NaI compared to few hundred
nanosecond typical signal width). The window size was chosen to be large due to poor
timing resolution of the Frisch grids caused by the requirement for electron current to
drift across a large fraction of the depth of the BD and by varying ranges of the FF in
106 235U Campaign at n ToF
gas. Ultimately, the campaign accumulated a total dataset of 68 TB on CASTOR, which
is a considerable data volume compared to many n ToF experiments, but nonetheless
significantly smaller than the 2015 campaign.
raw2root code is well-suited for experimental set-ups with fewer detectors and smaller
data size than in a STEFF experiment, due to its approach to data segment processing.
When a segment file is passed to it, each detectors stream is read and processed, and
no reading of any other detector stream is implemented during this time. This feature
disallows correlation of various detectors into a single event during the reading, which
has to be done subsequently in ROOT. For a spectrometer such as STEFF featuring
many detectors, this is a major complication. This single-stream property of raw2root
led to a further complication, since STEFF BD signals required different filters to the
ones offered in PSA. For that reason, existing derived classes of detector class were
unsuitable for the BD signals, which had to be written out as a raw pulse for future
processing in Manchester using filters discussed in the previous chapter. An entire
30 ms trace recorded for each BD, however, would constitute a very large amount of
data, most of which would consist of baseline and/or pre-amplifier decay. Due to all
the complications listed above, a two-step approach was adopted for processing STEFF
data on the servers at CERN using raw2root.
In the first step, following a calibration of the PSA fitting parameters inside UserInput,
PSA analysis was performed on all the detectors that were not inside the BDs including
Master signal traces. For the second step, a list of all the Master trigger times was ex-
tracted for every bunch from PSA processing in step 1 and fed into a custom detector
implementation written specifically for STEFF processing, called STEFFdetector,
which would extract traces containing BD signals from the full 30 s traces. The result-
ing cut trace will henceforth be referred to as a waveform and the STEFFdetector
derived class will be referred to as waveform routine. The process is outlined below in
Fig. 5.12, and a list of all the STEFF detector types, the routines used and the sampling
settings for the DAQ is given in Table 5.1.

Once the waveforms and the PSA-processed signals have been collected, they were trans-
ferred to Manchester and re-correlated into individual fission events, which were then
stored and processed using gavSort for storage in a MariaDB database for final analy-
sis. The full outline of all the milestones involved in the processing of the 2016 STEFF
Campaign at n ToF are shown in Fig. 5.13.
Figure 5.13: An outline of the steps involved in extracting raw data traces from
n ToF. The steps are as follows: processing the non-BD signals with the PSA routine,
feeding the Master trigger time output of the PSA routine to the waveform routine,
extracting the BD signal waveforms, re-correlating waveforms with the PSA-processed
signals, reading them into gavSort, and storing all the data in a MariaDB database.
5.2.1 PSA Routine Results
The PSA routine relies on signal derivative threshold crossings to identify the presence
of a pulse, and then it may be set to either attempt a fit or to directly extract signal
amplitude and area. The fitting for the STEFF campaign was done using default PSA
quadratic fitting (only the peak of the signal is fitted with a parabola) for all the detectors
except for the scintillators, which were fitted using a set of averaged pulse shapes, which
were produced for each detector type i.e. LaBr3 or NaI, during the campaign in 2016.
Once the pulse is fitted, a number of variables is extracted from the fit and from the
DAQ that help identify signal origin and time the signal within the campaign. The
extracted variables are then written to a ROOT file. The variables and their meaning
are shown in Table 5.2.

5.2.2 Waveform Routine
The waveform routines purpose is to use Master trigger times and proton bunch numbers
to identify and cut signal traces from the STEFF BDs in such a way, that some baseline,
signal risetime and some preamp decay is preserved in the final cut waveform. A pictorial
diagram of the process is shown in Fig. 5.14.
Figure 5.14: An outline of a typical raw anode pulse showing its position in time
relative to a Master trigger, and indicating all the variables involved in cutting of a
waveform out of a full trace. The times and signal widths and amplitudes are not
shown to scale. The diagram shows the Master time as a 20% CFD of a Master trigger.
A timestamp is asigned by the DAQ when the full trace is written, and lies a short time
before or after the Master trigger time depending on the ADC card used. The trace
begins a certain number of presamples before the timestamp time. read start and
read end variables are calculated using a user-defined offset for timing the position
of the signal within the trace.
Master signals are compared to signal timestamp, which corresponds to the time when
the DAQ channel for the detector in question has been triggered for writing. The time of
the first bin in the trace is offset from the timestamp by a certain number of presamples,
that were set in the DAQ individually for various detectors before the campaign. A list
of presample lengths and ADC channel widths in time are given below in Table 5.3.

widths for the 2016 campaign.

There are several effects that are considered during the waveform cutting. BDs in
different arms of STEFF were processed on different ADCs, which meant that there
112 235U Campaign at n ToF
will be small constant offsets due to Master triggers originating from four Frisch grids
on STEFF. These offsets were extracted from PSA processing of Master signals coming
from the four Frisch grids and taking the time difference of each Master channel relative
to Master channel 1, which corresponded to the ADC associated with the Bragg arms
Frisch grid. The results of this are shown in Table 5.4.
Table 5.4: A list of offsets of time offsets in the arrival of Master triggers used in the
campaign. The times are listed relative to one of the Bragg arm Master signal time,
referred to as MSTR1.
Master channel Time offset relative to MSTR1 (ns)
MSTR2 (Hipps arm) -200
MSTR3 (FiFI Bragg arm) -48
MSTR4 (FiFI Hipps arm) 182
Furthermore, every time a new bunch arrives, the n ToF DAQ is configured to set the
timestamp to zero and start taking data 10 s earlier for the first Master trigger, than for
the rest. This setting is a DAQ property, that is in place to ensure that n ToF detector
output streams always capture -flash. This feature is not of essential importance to
the BDs, since faster detectors rely on -flash for timing, but the BD time resolution is
too low to rely on it. Nonetheless, a 10,000 ns offset was added for every event where
timestamp variable is set to zero.
The offsets are combined with the number of presamples and the timestamp to calculate
read start, i.e. the expected position of the signal within the full trace. Prior to
calculating read end, the final channel of the cut trace, all the BD channels in the full
trace were averaged over a detector-dependent window to compress the length of the
waveform. The averaging window widths in channels are listed for all the detector types
in Table 5.5.

waveform, rather than fit information.

5.2.3 Fission Event Builder
The first stages of STEFF data analysis, i.e. staging, PSA and waveform cutting, focused
on bringing the data to Manchester and resulted in 6 TB of data, reducing the total
volume by 90%. The data were still split over various detectors in an uncorrelated
fashion, and therefore a dedicated package, called Fission Event Builder (FEB), was
developed for the purpose of re-packaging the data into fission events.
FEB is centered around a C++ code called Data Proc, which assembles fission events
within a single run. A flowchart of its functionality is shown in Fig. 5.15. The code
functions by storing all the PSA-processed data in memory and correlating them based
on signal amplitude cuts and time windows set for each detector relative to the Master
channel 1. An example of a time window setting for START and Master channel 1 is
shown in Fig. 5.16, and a full list of amplitude and time cuts for all the detectors is
given in Table. 5.6. The waveform data are too large to store in memory, and therefore
the code checks which BD detectors are missing (since some anode pads were not active
for all the runs) and creates a look-up table within the waveform ROOT file for quick
access to the data. Once all the PSA events are correlated into fission events and stored
in memory, they are written out to a correlated data ROOT file, and the waveforms are
added to the output during the writing stage.

Figure 5.15: A flowchart of PSA and waveform correlation into packaged fission
events by the Data Proc code. The code reads and correlates all the PSA-processed
signals around Master triggers based on time and amplitude cuts. Then it creates a
look-up table of all the waveform entries with their times and while writing out the
PSA-processed events adds the waveforms into the final ROOT file after the PSA,
relating them to each other with a fission event index (Fission 1 in this diagram).

flight to each of the two main arms BDs. There is a START signal amplitude cut of
3000 channels used for this spectrum. Red dashed lines represent the position of the
final time cut used for fission event building: between -5.2 and -2.3 s before Master

by other wire banks, which can be used for positioning of the electron cloud inside the

negative amplitude cuts.

The final output ROOT file contains a list of all the fission events. Each fission event
occupies several entries, the first of which contains the PSA-processed data, followed by
two entries for each waveform: one entry contains the waveform and the other all the
timing information for the waveform. All the entries can be identified as belonging to
the same fission event based on an index assigned by the code.
235U Campaign at n ToF 117
The final data volume followingData Proc did not get reduced, but increased to 8 TB
from the initial 6 TB, due to unfolding of the waveforms from a large single array of all
the waveforms to individual arrays for each fission event. This data structures storage
inefficiency was deemed acceptable, due to its more intuitive file structure and easier
handling when interfacing with gavSort in the next step of STEFF data processing.
5.2.4 Database
Once gavSort was set up for compatibility with ROOT, a database of experimental
results was written out from the FEB output. The processing took two weeks and
resulted in a 1 TB database, meaning that the STEFF data processing pipeline yielded
a 70-fold reduction in data volume. Reduction in volume following the FEB output
processing came from rejection of waveforms containing noise, more compact packaging
of waveforms as binary data, and a tighter cut being placed on PSA events relative
to fast-timing detectors, which was not possible during the fission event building stage,
since at that point all the PSA signals only shared slow Master signals.
During the processing, the data were divided into 6 trigger types. Each trigger type
identifies fission events with particular fast-timing signal combination, that allow quick
selection of events based on the quality of the timing signal the user can expect. The
triggers are tabulated below in Table 5.7. For all the trigger types, a 250 ns cut was
applied to all the PSA events relative to the fast-timing signal. Furthermore, a 64 PSA-
signal cut was placed on any fission event, since MariaDB does not allow dynamic
lengths for database rows. Unused slots for fission events with fewer PSA-processed
signals were filled with dash (-) characters. This cut has proven to be generous, as
shown in Fig. 5.17, since none of the events in either dedicated or parasitic pulses had
more events than 64 (typically there was 20 PSA events).

quick selection of fission events with particular timing resolution possibility.

(red) pulses. 64-event cut is shown in purple and demonstrates that none of the fission
events would have been affected by the cut-off. The plot features only the PSA events
that were accepted based on fast-timing detector cuts in gavSort, since following Master
time cuts in FEB the events in the 104 ns timing range featured up to 400 PSA events.
The database rows represent individual fission events, and 431 columns contain several
fission event properties, PSA signal properties for up to 64 PSA signals, several proper-
ties for each waveform, and the unfiltered waveforms themselves stored as binary large
objects (BLOBs). Furthermore, a sum signal comprising the gainmatched anode pads
in each of the two main arms was constructed and stored. The addition was done by
identifying the anode pad with the largest signal, and adding only the neighboring anode
pads (not including diagonal neighbors). Addition of all the non-neighbor anode pads
was rejected, due to amplification of noise levels in the sum signal caused by anode pads
which have no FF signal. A summary of all the main column types of the database are
listed in Table 5.8.

5.3 Conclusion and Future Improvements
A STEFF experiment with a wide collimator and a large 235U target has been conducted
at n ToF in 2016 with the aim of collecting large number of data on fission fragments and
prompt fission gamma rays. A data pipeline has been constructed for the experiment as
part of the work presented in this thesis, featuring a sequence of codes for transferring
STEFF experimental data from the n ToF DAQ to Manchester and storing the trans-
ferred data in a convenient MariaDB database, which now contains 5.8 million fission
events. The pipeline has reduced the data volume by a factor of 70. Data processing
took a total of 1.5 years across all the stages, a time that included considerable amount
of code testing and troubleshooting, and therefore will be significantly faster with a pre-
existing codebase. A considerable improvement in processing time can also be reached
by excluding reliance on USB disks for transferring data to Manchester, and processing
the data on the clusters at CERN to reduce disk I/O. Furthermore, a cluster with 100+
120 235U Campaign at n ToF
GB of RAM could potentially be used for the fission event building stage. Waveforms
were read in and written out for each fission event individually for the project presented
here, which resulted in a large amount of I/O between the code and the disks. Test with
reading all the waveforms for each run into memory before fission event building has
been conducted, and resulted in 3 faster processing. If a cluster with large RAM ca-
pacity is not available, making runs shorter in time during the conduct of future STEFF
experiments could result in run files with smaller waveform quantities, that could fit
into more conventional memory sizes. Once a database is built, experimental data can
be processed relatively quickly (the campaign presented in this work can be read and
analyzed in full from the database in the span of 7 hours). A graphical reference of
approximate processing times and data volume changes at various stages of the pipeline
are presented below in Fig. 5.18.

235U Gamma-ray Measurement
Results with STEFF
6.1 Prior STEFF Gamma-ray Measurements
Following the ILL and the 2015 n ToF campaigns of 235U PFG measurements using
STEFF, there has been an unresolved question of loss of gamma-ray efficiency between
the two experiments. PFG multiplicity measurements are performed by counting the
number of gamma rays, called event fold, for each fission event, which then can be
converted to multiplicity by accounting for the detector effects in a process called decon-
volution. The details of deconvolution of the ILL data can be found in Ref. [20]. During
the analysis of the 2015 n ToF campaign, an excess of fold-0 events, i.e. fission events
with no measured gamma rays, has been identified relative to the ILL campaign. The
fold distributions of the two campaigns are shown in Fig. 6.1. The n ToF data exhibit
considerably fewer events with fold of 2 or more, and the ratio of fold-1 to fold-0 is
1.3 for ILL data, and around 1 for the n ToF measurement. Since ILL PF1B beamline
offered a considerably lower gamma-ray background and did not expose detectors to
stresses such as the -flash characteristic to n ToF, the difference in the fold distribu-
tions suggests that there may be effects contributing to the loss of gamma ray detection
efficiency in the measurements at n ToF. The details of the effort to identify the causes
of the discrepancy are discussed in this chapter based on the data from the 2016 STEFF
campaign at n ToF, which had better statistics than the 2015 campaign due to larger
target and collimator, as well as the benefit of a LaBr3 crystal for reference.

6.2 Gamma-ray Data Time Cuts and Calibration
STEFF data from the 2016 n ToF campaign are based on detector events cut using a
wide Frisch grid-based time windows, and hence in order to extract fission gamma-ray
measurement results, it is necessary to identify when the fission happened within the
time window. The time of fission, tfission, may then be used to set narrow time gates
on various STEFF detectors. Fast-timing detectors were designed to be used for precise
measurements of tfission, and time distributions of START signals relative to MWPC
STOP signals can be used to extrapolate FF time-of-flight backwards from the START
signal to identify tfission. Examples of such time distributions for the Bragg and Hipps
arms are shown in Fig. 6.2. The signals from the various wire banks of the Bragg and
Hipps MWPCs were aligned relative to Bragg anode bank 2 and Hipps anode bank 1
respectively by fitting the distributions with double or triple Gaussians (depending on
the contributions from ringing) and taking time offsets based on the centroids of the
light fragment peak. Table 6.1 lists the extracted time differences.

with LF and HF respectively. Longer time-scale signals caused by electronic ringing
following the main signal in some of the MWPC wire banks are also indicated. Dashed
lines indicate time cuts used for gating on fission events; the time cut for the Hipps arm
was only used for extracting second fragment velocity, but was not used for gamma-ray
correlation.

Bragg MWPC5 -3.8
Hipps MWPC2 3.8
Hipps MWPC3 4.3
Hipps MWPC4 1.2
Hipps MWPC5 -18.7
Time cuts were chosen for the Bragg arm around the double-hump structure originating
from the light and heavy fission fragments (since Hipps arm ToF calculation requires a
cut on the Bragg arm in order to extract tfission, no cuts were imposed based on the Hipps
arm ToF distribution for the gamma-ray data analysis). For the Bragg arm the window
was between 50 and 120 ns for the difference in START and STOP signals. Using known
distance from the START foil center to the Bragg MWPC emission foil (732 mm), the
velocity of the fragment was calculated. A plot of FF velocities in the two main arms is
given in Fig. 6.3 (Hipps arm velocity was calculated based on Hipps STOP foil distance
relative to the target center, 878 mm). The calculation of the velocity distribution
was performed prior to Schmitt calibration [167], which is used to calibrate energy and
timing for FF measurements. The calibration requires FF energy information, and
since STEFF BD anode gainmatching has not been completed , preliminary offsets were
added to FF ToF (-10 ns for the Bragg arm and -15 ns for Hipps) in order to account for
124 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
START-STOP timing differences originating from differing methods of signal formation
and experimental electronics. The preliminary offsets were determined calculated based
on comparison with existing 235U FF velocity measurements [168]. In order to improve
timing resolution of the Bragg STOP signals, all the anode pad signals within 1 ns of
each other were averaged. The identified velocities were then used to calculate the time
it would take the FF to travel from the center of the target to the START detector based
on target center to START emission foil center distance of 152 mm, and the calculated
time was then subtracted from the START signal time to obtain tfission.

STOP SEE foil and START foil by the fragment ToF. Bragg arm distribution is shown

Scintillator signal times can be compared to tfission to obtain time cuts on their signals
in order to separate fission gamma-rays from the majority of the background introduced
into the database by the wide Frisch grid time gates. Plots of scintillator signal times
relative to tfission show flat background with a peak originating from fission gamma-
rays. The position of the fission peak in scintillator timing spectra can be used to
find time offsets between individual scintillators relative to each other, which have all
been normalized to NaI crystal 1. The offsets were verified using a 60Co calibration
source, which produces two gamma rays with 1173- and 1332-keV energies separated in
time by 0.7 ps [169], by correlating one of the two gamma rays in all the scintillators
relative to the second gamma ray in NaI 1. Time offsets were applied to the scintillator
signal timing and a spectrum of tfission distribution summed for all the NaI crystals was
produced alongside a similar spectrum for the LaBr3 crystal. The two distributions are
shown in Fig. 6.4, and all the individual time offsets are listed in Table 6.2.

dashed lines: 58-70 ns for NaI and 62-71 ns for LaBr3, chosen to be symmetric around
the peak while avoiding the prompt neutron contribution (seen as an asymmetric bump
at longer time scales due to neutron speeds being lower than c). The centroid of the
NaI distribution is 63.4 ns with a FWHM of 8.4 ns, and the centroid of the LaBr3
distribution is 65.6 ns with a FWHM of 5.9 ns. Red dashed lines show background
time cuts: 150-270 ns in NaI and 150-240 ns in LaBr3. Background time cuts are ten
times wider than the fission gate to allow for increased background statistics to produce
average background spectra and fold distributions.

Table 6.2 also shows coefficients for the energy calibration of each scintillator crystal. The
calibrations were performed using 60Co, 137Cs, 88Y and 241Am9Be sources. Since the
calibration sources cover a large energy range (661 to 4438 keV), a quadratic calibration
fit was used, although it can be seen from Table 6.2, that the quadratic coefficients were
always small. A typical calibration plot exemplified by NaI crystal 1 is shown in Fig.

against photopeak centroids. Red line shows quadratic fit used to relate channels in
the scintillator spectra to the incident gamma-ray energies.
A further time cut was imposed on the data during the analysis based on the Master
trigger times. Time differences between consecutive Master signals in the thermal energy
region were calculated to ensure there was only one signal per fission event to avoid
introducing gamma-ray events from the same fission more than once into the analysis.
Since fission events are independent of one another, i.e. a nucleus undergoing fission
does not influence the probability of other nuclei in the target undergoing fission, fission
probability should follow Poisson statistics, which means that the probability of a fission
event occurring in a certain interval after the previous event should follow exponential
decay. The Poisson distribution expectation is approximate when applied to fission
distribution at n ToF, since fission rate is not constant due to change in flux and energy
of neutrons, however the approximation can be made over short time scales. Fig. 6.6
shows a plot of the calculated time differences, which indeed do follow exponential decay
as shown in the inset. However, structures at short time scales are evident and imply
128 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
that there is some correlation between the events written into the database. The double-
peak structure at 4 s was attributed to double-triggering from the two main arms of
STEFF. While the time-of-flight differences of the FF in the two arms should be on the
order of 10 ns, the signal formation time differences in the Frisch grids (the source of
Master triggers) will be of the order of a microsecond, due to different ranges of the two
fragments and the slow electron cloud drift, resulting in considerable difference in signal
CFD crossing times in the two arms. A third peak-like structure is also visible in Fig. 6.6
at 5 s, attributed to discriminator double-triggering in the Master trigger electronics.
Since Frisch grid signals are bipolar (due to electron cloud first inducing signal on one
side of the grid, then drifting past the wires and inducing signal on the other side of
the grid), the discriminator may be triggered by the rising edge of the Frisch grid signal
as expected, and then get triggered again by the rising edge of the preamplifier decay
following the change in polarity of the incoming signal. The contribution to the fission
events considered during the analysis by such fictitious triggers was avoided by imposing
a 14 s dead time in Master triggers and resulting in rejection of 17% of the Master
triggers.

panded view of the shorter timescales of <100s. Several structures are evident at time
differences shorter than 14 s and their centroids are indicated. The events associated
with these structures were removed from the analysis by imposing a dead time of 14 s,
shown as a dashed red line.

6.3 Scintillator Gain Effects
Verifying scintillator stability and quantifying any gain fluctuations is crucial in analysing
gamma-ray data spanning the whole STEFF campaign. The background gamma rate
at the n ToF Facility is high, in particular in the region of the -flash as well as around
thermal neutron energies, and many scintillator PMTs are known to saturate in such
environment, resulting in extended periods of dead time. A series of measurements
have been performed using one of the STEFF NaI detectors prior to the 2015 campaign
on samples of 197Au in order to characterize the behaviour of the detectors in EAR2.
197Au has a known resonance at 4.9 eV with (n,) cross-section of 27,000 barn [11].
Therefore, when neutrons at that energy are absorbed, a large increase in gamma-ray
flux is expected in the scintillators around the target. By using two samples, a thin
and a thick one (with diameters of 20 and 10 mm, and thicknesses of 0.1 and 1 mm
respectively), changes in NaI response could be observed at the resonance for an increase
in count rate produced by the thick target compared to the thin one. The top panel of
Fig. 6.7 shows the resulting counts as a function of incident neutron energy. At lower
count rates associated with the thin sample, the plot clearly shows a sharp resonance
peak, however detector suppression is evident in the thick sample results, where instead
of a resonance peak, the detector measured counts show a trough. The bottom panel of
the plot shows count rate in that neutron energy region for the thick sample, and the
drastic reduction in counting efficiency after count rates of >1 MHz is evident.
130 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
Figure 6.7: Top panel: comparison of gamma-ray counts as a function of incident
neutron energy for the thin (black) and thick (red) 197Au samples. The detector sat-
uration effects are evident at the 4.9 eV resonance in the thick sample data. Bottom
panel: count rate as a function of incident neutron energy for the thick sample. This
panel also shows reduced counting efficiency at the 4.9 eV resonance.
A full description of count rate effect characterization during the 2015 campaign can
be found in Ref. [21]. An important result of the gold test was the identification of
saturation effects at 1 MHz rates and subsequent modification of the PMTs in the
NaI scintillators used on STEFF (also detailed in Ref. [21]). The modifications were
performed by the manufacturer and resulted in restoration of the sharp resonance peak
for the thick gold sample. Note, that LaBr3 scintillators have also been modified prior
to being loaned to the STEFF team. In the case of LaBr3, the modifications constituted
the outer glass container of the PMT being given an HA treatment, whereby the glass
235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 131
cover around the photocathode is covered in insulating black paint preventing leakage
signal from forming between the cathode and the grounded glass [170].
A further investigation into the count rate effects was conducted after the PMT modifica-
tions using a 22Na source by varying the distance between the source and the scintillators
and observing the drift of the photopeak position [21]. The results of the investigation
are shown in Fig. 6.8, demonstrating increase in gain with increase in count rate. During
the testing of the NaI crystal, it was also determined similarly to the results obtained
from gold, that the crystal becomes saturated at around 1 MHz rates, and the gain re-
duces sharply, causing the photopeaks to become indistinguishable. The LaBr3 crystal,
on the other hand, shows steady increase in gain at rates up to 1.4 MHz.
Figure 6.8: Change in 22Na 1275-keV gamma-ray photopeak position at varying count
rates based on the source proximity to a) NaI and b) LaBr3 scintillator.
Indeed, the effect of increasing count rate resulting in the PMT gain increase followed
by a decrease is known although not fully understood [171]. Fig. 6.9 shows the effect in
132 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
qualitative terms. The reductive effect can be explained by space charge accumulation
[90], whereby incident light deposited into the photomultiplier at a high rate produces
electrons, while the electron cloud associated with the previous light pulse is still inside
the volume of the PMT. This results in the anode seeing less of the new pulses charge,
as it is obscured by the previous pulse. Rosen and Chromey [171] discuss in detail
the effects of PMT fatigue, which may also result in similar gain variations, although
fatigue is typically a cumulative effect over long periods of PMT operation. Fatigue is
not very well understood [171], however a number of explanations have been proposed,
including ejection of material from the dynodes by incident electrons [172], charging up
of the insulators between the dynodes [173], oxidation-induced Malter effect (formation
of positive charge on the dynode surface following electron ejection, and resulting in
electrons being pulled to the surface from the interior of the dynode) [174], or oxidation
of dynodes resulting trapping of ejected electrons [175].
  
 


Figure 6.9: A qualitative demonstration of decrease in counting efficiency of a PMT
for large quantities of incident light due to reduction in gain at particularly high count
rates. Figure adapted from [170].
A further consideration concerning STEFF scintillator gain lies with the detector history
effect associated with the -flash. PMTs are known to exhibit light hysteresis [170], an
effect whereby the incident light is changed in a drastic manner, resulting in a rapid
change of anode current, producing a non-linear gain change of the PMT to incident
radiation. Fig. 6.10 shows a qualitative representation of the effect. For the detectors
operating at n ToF, the -flash constitutes a large step-like increase in gamma rays

in Fig. 5.6. The subsequent saturation of the detectors and light hysteresis require
235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 133
long signal recovery times, which may extend into the neutron time-of-flight regions of
low background gamma count rate. For this reason, it is important to consider post-
gamma flash time when investigating scintillator performance at n ToF, and not simply
instantaneous count rate.

shows constant voltage applied to the PMT set to some value V . In the second panel,
light input into the PMT is shown, varying in a step-like way every minute, which
results in step pulses in the anode output in the bottom panel. Note the shape of the
anode output current, which may show under- or overshoots, called light hysteresis.
The effect is shown here on the scale of minutes, and it is unclear whether it will be
present and to what extent on the millisecond scales of the neutron pulses. Figure

6.4 Quantifying the NaI Gain Variations
Fig. 6.11 shows NaI signal PSA fitting quality reduction for shorter neutron time-of-
flight regions for a dedicated proton bunch by comparing fits in regions of increasing
count rate (the count rate is approximately 200 kHz for the top panel and approximately
1 MHz for the bottom panel). Fig. 6.12 shows measured count rate as a function of
neutron ToF in both NaI and LaBr3 scintillators for dedicated and parasitic bunches.
The details on how to convert between the neutron time-of-flight and energy for n ToF
experiments in EAR2 can be found in Ref. [157] (note that the flightpath length for the
calculation used for this work is 19.85 m found by observing the resonances in the START
detector rates and matching them to the known neutron resonance energies, specifically
1.14, 11.7 and 19.3 eV, as well as matching the position of the EAR2 flux maximum
at 40 meV). It is evident from the two figures, that as count rates get higher, the
PSA fits struggle to reproduce the spectrum due to pile-up, which results in uncertainty
in baseline estimation. In the bottom panel one can clearly see signal pile-up (e.g. at
7346103 ns), where pulses become hard to resolve even by eye.

Figure 6.12: Estimated count rates in NaI crystal 1 (top two panels) and LaBr3 (bot-
tom two panels) for dedicated (blue error bars) and parasitic (red error bars) bunches.
Note the two regions where count rates exceed 1 MHz: -flash region and at near-
thermal energies (0.04-0.06 eV depending on pulse type). In these regions stated count
rates are approximate due to signal saturation resulting in difficulty of estimating real
count rates. All the count rates except for the LaBr3 dedicated pulse one were cal-
culated for STEFF runs without the uranium target and with no Master triggering.
The LaBr3 dedicated count rate was calculated by multiplying the parasitic count rates
for each neutron energy bin by the ratio of dedicated-to-parasitic count rates in NaI
scintillator 1.
136 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
Due to the fitting quality deterioration, the -ray data analysis was restricted to regions
of 107 ns in neutron time-of-flight or greater for sodium iodides. No complications in
fitting were observed for LaBr3 signals around the thermal and epithermal regions, and
therefore the cut-off for analysis of LaBr3 signals was set at 1 eV neutron energy (1.5
ms neutron time-of-flight), just before the 235U resonance at 1.14 eV [11]. Fission in
the resonance region is likely to originate from different nuclear states populated by the
neutron compared to thermal/epithermal energies, which may result in different -ray
spectra, and therefore data corresponding to the neutron resonances were not mixed
with the analysis of the thermal/epithermal fission data.
In order to investigate gain variation further, matrices were produced for each bunch
type and each of the 12 scintillators. The matrices contained rows corresponding to
neutron time-of-flight binned in 12 s bins and columns containing gamma-ray energy
spectra (separate matrices were produced for fission-gated spectra and for background-
gated spectra). These matrices could be used to perform background-subtraction gated
on gamma-ray spectra at specific neutron energies and thus examine the evolution of
fission spectrum as a function of neutron energy and pulse type (thus making it effectively
a function of count rate) for both scintillator types. A visualization of one such matrix
is shown in Fig. 6.13 for NaI crystal 1 background-subtracted gamma-ray spectra in
the neutron time-of-flight region of 10-28 ms. Examples of spectral shape differences at
different neutron times-of-flight are given in Fig. 6.14, comparing gamma-ray spectra
for NaI at 10 and 28 ms and for LaBr3 at 10 and 20.8 ms (higher ToF regions were not
used for LaBr3 due to low statistics).

235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 139
Fission gamma-ray spectra feature gamma-rays originating from a large range of nuclei in
different populated states and contain a large contribution from statistical E1 transitions.
For these reasons along with the relatively poor NaI energy resolution, NaI PFG spectra
discussed in this work do not feature any distinct peaks (as can be seen in Fig. 6.14),
the change in the position of which would facilitate gain change investigation. Instead,
fission gamma-ray spectra are effectively continuous, and the lack of any peaks masks
gain effects. The shape of the spectrum, however, is expected to be the same across the
thermal and epithermal range, based on the assumption that sub-electronvolt changes in
energy will not have a substantial effect on the populated fission states. Thus the shape
of the spectrum itself can be used as a monitor of gain, and can be analyzed as a function
of neutron ToF. LaBr3 spectra appear to be very similar for the two ToF cuts presented
above, but the NaI spectra show major difference in shape, whereby the energies appear
compressed at lower ToF values, suggesting gain drift. As part of STEFF scintillator
gain investigation, two useful spectral shape parameters were identified and investigated
based on the gamma-ray data. These parameters are root-mean-squared value of gamma-
ray energy above the peak (henceforth RMS) and half-width half-maximum of the
distribution (henceforth HWHM). A typical spectrum demonstrating the method of
extraction of these parameters is shown in Fig. 6.15.

neutron times-of-flight between 12.4 and 13.6 s for dedicated bunches. The red line
shows a parabolic fit for extracting the energy at which the maximum of the distribution
occurs, and the yellow line shows the linear fit around the position of the half-maximum.
Half-maximum position is estimated based on parabolic fit to the maximum and the
final HWHM value is extracted from fitting. These two fits are used to extract spectral
features used to characterize the distribution.
140 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
The peak of the distribution is fitted with a parabola (in red) to identify the maximum
spectral amplitude and the energy at which the maximum occurs Emax, which is then
used for the calculation of the two aforementioned parameters. RMS can be calculated
RMS =
E>Emax
NE(E  Emax)2
, (6.1)
where E is the gamma-ray energy of a given energy bin, NE is the number of events in
bin E, and N is the total number of gamma-rays with energy greater than Emax in the
spectrum.
HWHM is a simpler parameter to express, as it is simply the difference between the
energy corresponding to the half-maximum of the distribution (on the high-energy side
of the peak) found from the linear fit and Emax found from the parabolic fit. The two
parameters are useful in different ways: RMS is more sensitive to high energy tail of
the distribution, and therefore describes how high in energy the spectrum goes, while
HWHM is the width of the distribution, describing how quickly the energy of the
measured gamma rays drops off.
All the collected spectra for all the neutron time-of-flight regions of interest were fitted,
and the two parameters were calculated. The spectra were summed for all the sodium
iodides to improve statistics. The average value of each of the two fitted parameters
for each pulse and crystal type was found for neutron times-of-flight greater than 20
ms, and the ratios of the parameter values for each neutron energy bin to the average
were plotted. The resulting distribution of RMS and HWHM values is shown in Fig.
6.16, where they are grouped by bunch and crystal type, and Fig. 6.17, where they are
grouped by fitted parameter and crystal type.

235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 143
The uncertainties on the RMS results were calculated using Eqn. 6.2 and the uncer-
tainties on the HWHM values were calculated using Eqn. 6.5. The RMS uncertainty
is the more complicated one and can be expressed as
, (6.2)
where num is the numerator (num) uncertainty and den is the denominator (den)
uncertainty, and the numerator and denominator refer to the contents of the square root
in Eqn. 6.1. The denominator uncertainty is simply the uncertainty in N , and can be
expressed as Emax/N . The uncertainty in the numerator is composed of two parts: the
uncertainty due to NE and the uncertainty in the fitting of Emax. The two components
can be written as
NE =
E>Emax
(E  Emax)2
(6.3)
Emax =
E>Emax
(2NE(Emax  E)). (6.4)
The components of the final RMS uncertainty are covariant. For example, if due to the
uncertainty in the fit the peak position was identified lower by one energy bin than the
true position, the iterative procedure that sums all the bins above the maximum will
be missing a bin. Such covariances have not been accounted for in the formulae given
above.
The uncertainty on HWHM can be calculated as
HWHM
Ehalf
Ehalf
Emax
, (6.5)
where Ehalf is the energy at the half-maximum position in the spectrum and Ehalf is
the uncertainty in identifying the energy. Emax uncertainty is calculated the same way
as in the equation 6.4, while Ehalf , can be calculated as
Ehalf = Ehalf
, (6.6)
144 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
where m is the slope of the linear fit and m is the fit uncertainty for the slope calculated
by ROOT.
Similarly to RMS, the uncertainty in HWHM contains covariant quantities. Namely,
change in the estimate of Emax will result in shifting of the fitting window for the linear
fit used to identify Ehalf , which will change the fit and subsequently m.
6.5 NaI Gain Correction Results
The scaling of the extracted HWHM and RMS by the average value of each respective
parameter for neutron times-of-flight greater than 20 ms, where the parameters exhibit
little variation, was done in order to produce a fractional correction parameter for the
spectral shape as a function of neutron time-of-flight. Each of the two parameters was
fitted with a function of the form
f(ToF ) = 1 eABToF , (6.7)
where A and B are fitted parameters. In the case of the parasitic HWHM parameter,
the first constant (1) also had to be set as a fitted coefficient for the ROOT fitting
routine to converge. The results of the fits are shown in Fig. 6.18 and the resulting
coefficients and reduced chi-squared values are tabulated in Table 6.3. Since at higher
neutron energies gamma-ray spectra show compression, the extracted functions from the
fits are used to correct signal amplitude based on ToF, resulting in a greater amplitude
at lower ToF, where the count rates are higher. The energy of a gamma ray that could be
distinguished from background by PSA routine settings used for STEFF analysis is 150
keV. This threshold value is then increased by the correction, and the resulting minimal
energies for different corrections are also tabulated alongside the fit parameters. The
increase in gamma-ray energy threshold means that the final NaI spectra do not feature
the maximum of the PFG energy distribution, which has previously been measured in
the 100-200 keV range [14].

A comparison of the corrected background-subtracted NaI gamma spectra along with
the uncorrected spectra are shown in Fig. 6.19 and Fig. 6.20 for the parasitic and
dedicated pulses respectively. Both correction parameters have produced visibly more
consistent spectral shapes that are considerably less dependent on the incident neutron
energy. Unsurprisingly, HWHM parameter performed better at restoring the spectral
width, although the spectra show different maximal amplitudes, whileRMS did better at
restoring the maximal amplitude of the distribution at the expense of width consistency.

at different points, and also disagree above 5 MeV. The n ToF measurements for both

rays above 5 MeV.

6.6 PSA Fit Quality Investigation
An investigation of the fits to the raw data using the PSA routines was conducted
with particular focus on the fitting of the low-amplitude signals. A miscalibration of
the time limit parameter, used as duration over which PSA performs dedicated -flash
baseline estimation instead of operating with the user-defined baseline settings, was
identified for the NaI PSA configuration (the parameter was set to 109 ns, whereas a
considerably more well suited value of 3106 ns was found during the re-investigation).
This excessively large time limit size resulted in the baseline estimation failing for signals
that are far removed from the -flash (most importantly in the 10 ms region used in the
present analysis). The chosen baseline setting works well in the high count-rate regions
of the data, and when the PSA settings were optimized at the beginning of the data
processing campaign, the quality of the fits in these regions was emphasized without
235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 149
the appreciation of the extent of gain variations in the detectors themselves. The LaBr3
fits were also re-examined, but appeared to be calibrated well at least for all count rate
regions below 1 eV neutron energy. Screenshots of the fits are shown in Fig. 6.22. It is
evident from the fit visualization that the baseline in NaI signals is underestimated by
approximately 8 channels, resulting in the routine missing a real signal (which is missed
by the improved fit as well, but due to low amplitude cut-off as intended), as well as
introducing three artificial signals.
 
 

Figure 6.22: Visualization of PSA fits for both scintillator types used on STEFF.
NaI signals with the original fit used during fission event building are shown in the
top panel. An improved fit for the same trace segment is shown beneath it. Bottom
panel shows PSA fit for a LaBr3 signal evidencing the good quality of both the baseline
estimation and the signal fitting. Blue arrows indicate artificial signals resulting from
poor baseline estimation.
Following the identification of approximately 8 channel underestimation of the baseline
an investigation was conducted to assess the behaviour of the fits for signals of various
amplitudes and at different neutron energies. Unfortunately, during the initial PSA
processing in 2016, PSA routines did not offer chi-squared calculation for each pulse,
which is a functionality that has since been implemented and will benefit future STEFF
data processing. The underestimation of baseline results in fits with greater amplitude,
at least partially contributing to the lack of observed low-energy fission gamma rays.
On the other hand, the introduction of artificial signals is unlikely to affect the fission
150 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
spectra significantly, since such signals are unlikely to coincide with a narrow fission
time gate in coincidence with the fast-timing detectors.
In order to assess the baseline underestimation, the NaI PSA settings were improved
(only by changing the step size variable) and a run of NaI data was re-processed with
the old parameters and then with the new, the latter data set serving as a reference.
The comparison of the signal amplitudes was performed using all the signals within the
chosen run (run 204893), i.e. both background gamma rays and fission gamma rays.
Gating on fission gamma-rays would require a full round of re-processing of the data
into fission events, which is a time-consuming process, while fitting errors are unlikely to
affect fission gamma rays any differently to the background ones. A comparison of the
resulting original and new fit amplitude spectra for the two proton pulse types are shown
in Fig. 6.23. The fits for both pulse types appear to agree reasonably well for gamma ray
energies above 1 MeV, however there is a considerable increase in low-energy gamma-rays
for the original fit settings. This is likely caused by the combination of overestimation of
pulse amplitude due to background underestimation and the introduction of the artificial
signals.

152 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
In order to quantify the fitting defects, gamma-rays from the improved fits were matched
to the their original fit counterparts using ROOT, by requiring that gamma rays origi-
nate from the same proton bunch and are identified within 5 ns of each other, accounting
for the drift in CFD crossing due to amplitude changes. Distributions of amplitude dif-
ferences between improved and original fit signals were then plotted to investigate the
effect of count rate (by means of neutron time-of-flight gates), minimal amplitude cut,
and signal pileup on the fit performance. The effect of the neutron ToF cut is shown
in Fig. 6.24. The centroid of the dedicated data is approximately -8 channels with a
standard deviation of 4 channels, while the centroid of parasitic data lies at -7 channels
with the same standard deviation as the dedicated data. All the ToF cuts appear consis-
tent within one standard deviation, although the lowest ToF cut (in black) has a large
peak at 0 channel difference, indicating agreement of the two data sets. This occurs
due to the baseline setting in PSA, which sets the baseline at higher count rate regions,
where signal baseline does not fully restore following pulses, resulting in similar fitting
by both parameter sets. Due to this effect, further PSA investigations were conducted
for neutron ToF greater than 2.5 ms.

of 0 meaning that no pileup was identified, value of 1 meaning that the signal starts
or ends above a set threshold, and -1 meaning that the signal starts or ends below a
set threshold. The threshold was set to 10 channels for both PSA fit data. Neither
the change in minimal amplitude nor the imposition of a pileup1 flag value resulted in
a significant change in amplitude differences, suggesting that neither neutron ToF, nor
amplitude cut or pile-up affect the performance of the baseline estimation significantly.
Furthermore, the effect seems consistent regardless of which NaI crystal is selected, as
shown in Fig. 6.27.

Based on the consistency of the amplitude differences for all the signals, a plot of am-
plitude difference for all neutron ToF greater than 2.5 ms has been constructed for each
pulse type summed for all the NaI crystals to investigate a constant offset to apply to
each signal in the analysis. The centroids are -8.13 with a standard deviation of 4.09
for both pulse types, corresponding to an offset of 92-112 keV depending on the crystal.
The calibration source data PSA fits used for energy calibration did not have the same
variations in the count rate, allowing for an accurate determination of the baseline, and
therefore did not suffer from an offset during fitting. For that reason, energy calibrations
did not take the offset into account despite having the same PSA settings, and the fission
energy spectra were re-compiled with all the signals reduced by 8.13 amplitude channels.
The results of the 8-channel correction are shown for the parasitic and dedicated pulse
in Figs. 6.28 and 6.29 respectively.

Shifting the spectra by 8 channels appears to bring the overall shape of the energy
spectra to general agreement with the improved fit data. An example comparing the
ILL data to a shifted spectrum is shown in Fig 6.30. It is evident that there are still
a lot of low-energy and high-energy counts missing, but it is difficult to estimate how
many signals were lost due to baseline misidentification by simply looking at PSA fits
(and therefore correct the spectrum) due to the introduction of artificial signals. In
158 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
order to accurately estimate the loss of fission gamma-rays in the PSA routine, a full
re-correlation of newly-fitted NaI data with the fast-timing detectors is required.

6.7 LaBr3 Gain Investigation
6.7.1 Count rate correction
As was shown in Fig. 6.8, based on calibration source investigation LaBr3 detector is
expected to exhibit gain fluctuations with increasing count rate like NaI, however the
change is expected to be linear in count rate. A linear fit was produced based on 22Na
count rate effect investigation data with a slope of 20.14.9 and an intercept of 1574
(2red. 7). The linear fit was used to calculate expected amplitude as a function of
count rate, however count rate information is not available directly from fission event

order to perform the calculation, a 9th order polynomial has been fitted to the parasitic
and dedicated count rates in LaBr3 shown in Fig. 6.12 in the thermal to 1 eV neutron
energy range. The fits are shown in Fig. 6.32 and the fit coefficients are listed in Table

Neutron energy was calculated based on the time of each LaBr3 signal, and was used as
an input to the count rate calculation, which was applied for all signals corresponding
to neutron energies below 1 eV. The calculated count rate was then used in the linear
fit in order to correct the amplitude for the count rate-induced gain effect. The effect of
the correction is demonstrated in Fig. 6.33.

6.7.2 Background peak correction
A further gain correction was implemented in LaBr3 spectra based on the background
spectra which featured a single peak, unlike the smooth background spectra in NaI
detectors. A comparison of the background spectra between the parasitic pulses in
LaBr3 and NaI detector 1 is shown in Fig. 6.34, and the peak visible in the LaBr3
spectrum is presented more clearly in Fig. 6.35.

In an effort to investigate the behaviour of the peak as a measure of gain, as well as to
164 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
determine its origin, the position of the peak was tracked in different neutron time-of-
flight regions for each proton pulse type. A plot of several time-of-flight cuts for both
pulse types is presented in Fig. 6.36. Following the count rate correction based on 22Na
source data, parasitic LaBr3 spectra were considered gain corrected, and indeed the peak
position appears stable across all ToF cuts. The position of the peak drifts with ToF in
the dedicated pulses despite the prior correction, and appears at a higher energy than
in parasitic, suggesting more complicated gain effects likely based on the more intense
rates and background of the dedicated pulses.

neutron ToF cuts to both proton pulse types. Plotted uncertainties represent peak
standard deviation divided by the square root of peak area. Peak position in the 2.7
ms ToF cut is omitted in the parasitic distribution, as it was combined with the 1 ms
cut to improve statistics for fitting. The data points for both pulse types in the 5.5 ms
cut exhibited unusual skewness, whereby the peak width was approximately the same
as in the other cuts, but the peak maximum was skewed towards low energy.
Based on the data presented in Fig. 6.38, a correction was produced by taking the ratio of
the peak positions in the dedicated pulses to parasitic, producing correction coefficients
as a function of neutron ToF. The coefficients were fitted with a linear fit, which was
used to calculate a multiplicative correction factor applied to the calibrated dedicated
166 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
LaBr3 spectra. The fit is shown in Fig. 6.39 and the resulting background and fission
gamma-ray spectra are shown in Fig. 6.40. It is evident from the background spectrum,
that the peak positions in the two pulse types are in considerably better agreement
following the correction. It is worth noting, that the post-correction reduction in gain
has moved some signals below the 10-channel miminum PSA threshold corresponding to
180 keV gamma-ray energy, and for spectra summed across large timespans with count
rate variations such as the one in Fig. 6.40 the threshold should be reapplied to the
dedicated spectrum to produce the final measured PFG energy spectrum. The counts
shifted below the threshold are retained in the spectrum shown here for demonstration
of the gain correction effect only, and the proper threshold can be seen in the figure for
parasitic data.

Figure 6.40: LaBr3 a) background and b) fission gamma-ray energy spectra following
gain correction based on the background peak position. Dedicated pulse data are shown
in blue, and parasitic in red.
Throughout the analysis of the background peak presented here, it has been assumed
that the peak corresponds to the same physical effect in both proton pulse types. Since
the structure only appears in the LaBr3 spectra and not in NaI indicates that there is
some LaBr3-specific activity producing the peak, rather than it being associated with
the in-beam or STEFF structural components. A natural first guess at the origin of the
structure is the internal activity in the detector produced by  decay of 138La discussed
previously in this work. The peak structure is quite broad (FWHM50 keV) compared
to the resolution of a LaBr3 scintillator, which may indeed suggest broadening due to the
varing energy deposited by the  particle in coincidence with a gamma ray. Calibration
source spectra have been used to investigate the possibility of internal transitions of
the detector producing the peak-like structure. Source spectra normalized in time are
shown in Fig. 6.41, and clearly indicate which of the peaks correspond to the internal
activity in lanthanum, since the rates are approximately constant on the timescales of
calibration spectrum collection.

Figure 6.41: Overlapped 137Cs, 60Co and 241Am9Be source spectra normalized in col-
lection time. The two internal transitions of 138La are indicated alongside the prominent
calibration source peaks.
The first 138La peak is the 789-keV  decay, and shows characteristic broadening caused
by the beta particle scattering. The shape exhibited by the peak is dissimilar to the
one observed in the background. Moreover, due to the ease of identification of internal
transitions in lanthanum-138, the energy calibration of the detectors may be tested.
The spectra presented above have been calibrated using the calibration function derived
from them, and the peaks are positioned within 7 keV of the known transition energies
(with the exception of the AmBe 4436-keV transition which was underestimated by 10
keV), confirming the overall accuracy of the calibration, and making it unlikely that the
background peak observed in the 500-600 keV range is actually the 789-keV transition. A
considerable reduction in gain could indeed shift the peak position by 200 keV, however
the peak position does not show recovery from gain reduction in the parasitic pulses
(as seen in NaI), and appears to be stable overall. Further possibility of detector gain
shifting due to damage has also been examined by comparing the position of the 88Y
peaks from calibrations before and after the STEFF campaign, and the peak position in
the spectra does not change, suggesting that the detector was not damaged during the
campaign in a way that would reduce gain.
Another possibility for a peak-like structure to occur in LaBr3 is a neutron capture
reaction occurring in the constituent elements of the detector (i.e. 138,139La, 79,81Br, and
140,142Ce dopant). Neutron capture can lead to prompt gamma emission, a formation of
a metastable state, which emits a gamma ray at some later time following capture, or a
formation of a compound nucleus that is unstable against beta decay, producing a beta
scattering-broadened peak from gamma decay following the emission of a beta particle.
These scenarios were investigated using data evaluated in ENDF [10] and Ref. [176]. A
clear way of testing neutron capture as a source of the peak would be to examine the
235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 169
behaviour of the peak at varying neutron energies, in particular at the resonance energies
of the various nuclei comprising the detector, however PSA fits to the LaBr3 data are
unreliable at neutron energies beyond 5 eV, below the majority of intense resonances
of the nuclei in question.
For the scenarios listed above, the peak could in fact be an overlap of several gamma
rays originating not from a single event types, but some combination of them. A simple
such combination of processes would involve a 511-keV gamma ray originating from
annihilation of a + particle originating from 138La or 80Br (a product of neutron capture
on naturally-occurring 79Br in the detector). Another gamma ray in the energy range
of 550-600 keV would then be required to explain the breadth of the peak. There are
several candidates for such gamma rays. Firstly, 82Br, produced by neutron capture with
a cross-section of 6.5 b [11] on 81Br, resulting in a 554-keV gamma ray following 
decay to 2.648 MeV state of 82Kr. Secondly, a gamma decay of 81Br following excitation
of the nucleus, which produces 566 keV gamma-ray from 32 state directly to ground
state. Similarly there are 544- and 553-keV transitions from 72 state in 79Br, and 569-
and 576-keV transitions in 138La from the 2+ and 2 states respectively. 138Ba, +
product of 138La, has a 547-keV gamma-ray decay, but its originating from a state with
energy of 2.446 MeV, above +-populated energy state of 1436 keV. 140,142Ce isotopes
in the crystal, 138Ce (populated by  decay of 138La), and 139La do not have such
low-energy gamma-rays with high intensities in low excitation states, which are the ones
more likely to be populated in the decays following thermal neutron capture.
While there are many transitions listed above which may contribute to the peak, none of
them are transitions to ground state directly from states populated by their respective
reactions. This means that one would expect other gamma rays from their decay band
to have a comparable intensity. Such transitions would subsequently appear in the
spectra alongside the peak already observed, provided sufficient LaBr3 efficiency in their
respective energy regions, a condition which some of the candidate transitions satisfy.
For example, the 554-keV transition originating from 82Br has a cross-section of 0.838
b, and the same parent nucleus has a 776-keV transition with a cross-section of 0.990
b [176], which is not seen in the spectra. It is possible, however, that other materials,
such as constituent elements of the PMT, contribute as well.
Despite the lack of a clear origin, the peak-like structure was deemed a good gauge of
detector gain. Following the gain corrections, measured fold distributions for LaBr3 were
calculated. Since a single LaBr3 crystal was used, during the narrow fission time window
the fold can only take values of 0 or 1, and multiple hits will likely result in pile-up and
subsequently a detected fold of 1. The ratio of fold 1 to fold 0 is 0.0438 for the dedicated
pulses and 0.0385 for parasitic. A measured gamma-ray energy spectrum summed for
170 235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF
both pulse types is presented in Fig. 6.42. Both the folds and the energy spectra were
produced for 1 eV maximum neutron energy, and have no gamma-ray energy thresholds
applied beyond the 10 channel PSA fitting threshold corresponding to 184 keV. Note,
that the gain corrections will have reduced the 184-keV energy threshold in the spectra
to varying extents depending on the count rate and pulse type, but it has to be re-
applied in the final STEFF PFG measurements with LaBr3. The need to re-apply the
thresholds arises, because the signals in the higher count-rate regions will have been
corrected more and have been added to the energy spectrum shown below, while the
gamma-rays with similar energies will have been rejected in PSA for lower count rate
regions (which undergo less gain correcting). Thus at gamma energies below 184 keV the
yield of gamma-rays is not reliable in the summed spectrum. The lower energy signals
were retained in the plots presented here for demonstration of the gain correction effect
only.

proton pulse types and corrected for gain drift.
6.8 Conclusion
Following the database construction for the 2016 n ToF 235U measurement campaign,
the gamma-ray data were analyzed to extract measured PFGS and fold distributions. A
series of corrections were devised for correcting for count-rate effects in NaI signals for
neutron ToF greater than 10 ms for both the dedicated and parasitic proton pulse types.
The corrections resulted in consistent spectral shape for all neutron ToF regions above
10 ms for each of the two pulse types, although small differences in the energy and fold
235U Gamma-ray Measurement Results with STEFF 171
distributions between the pulse types remain. The resulting measured gamma-ray energy
spectra have been compared to those measured during the ILL campaign. The spectra
agree in the 1-4 MeV energy range, but disagree in the lower- and higher-energy regions.
It is worth noting, that the deconvolved ILL energy spectra also show lack of low-energy
gamma-rays compared to the existing data such as Oberstedt et al. [14], and only agree
with them in the 1-3 MeV range, while observing a lack of low-energy gamma rays, but
an increase in the high energy counts. The increase in high-energy counts in the spectra
measured at ILL can also be investigated relative to the Makii et al. measurements [22],
and the n ToF spectra can be used for similar analysis after multiple-hits subtraction
is performed. As part of the work presented here, calibrated and gain-corrected LaBr3
energy and fold spectra have also been produced following investigation of the detector
gain, and may shed light on both the disagreements with prior data (as measurements
in Ref. [14] have been partially performed with LaBr3 detectors) and on losses of NaI
signals in the low-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum.
In order to resolve fully the discrepancies between the existing STEFF measurements as
well as with the previous data, several further steps are necessary. Firstly, the measured
ILL data need to be re-visited to verify fold distributions with difference gamma-ray
energy gates in order to identify more precisely the region where the n ToF and ILL data
agree using energy-gated fold distributions. Once a minimal reliable energy threshold
for the n ToF data has been identified based on fold agreement, the NaI and LaBr3
spectra in that region require neutron signal subtraction, multiple hit subtraction and
deconvolution as described in Ref. [20]. Deconvolution requires completion of GEANT4
[177] simulations of STEFF, which are currently undergoing testing by the Manchester
fission group.

Conclusion
Following the 2016 STEFF campaign of 235U(n,f) measurements of fission fragments
and gamma rays, a data pipeline has been constructed. The pipeline is based on pre-
existing libraries and pulse-shape analysis routine at n ToF, which are used to convert the
experimental data into ROOT format. A new routine has been written for raw2root,
which extracted ionization traces. An event-building program has then been produced
and tested for correlating individual detector signals into packaged fission events. The
gavSort sorting program has been adapted to produce a MariaDB database from
ROOT data for convenient access to the experimental results. The pipeline resulted in
70-fold data size reduction and allows for processing of the entire campaign in 7 hours.
The constructed database was then used to gate on fission gamma-rays using fast-timing
detectors and investigate count rate effects on STEFF scintillators as a function of
proton pulse type and neutron energy. Corrections have been developed to account
for the saturation of the scintillators and corrected spectra have been assessed with
reference to the 2014 STEFF campaign at ILL, which did not suffer from the saturating
effects affecting NaI scintillators (background gamma-ray intensity, -flash) inherent to
measurements at n ToF. The spectra for the two campaigns agreed in the intermediate
gamma-ray energy range (1-4 MeV), and the disagreement at lower energies has been
attributed to poor signal fitting. A corrected set of fitting parameters for future STEFF
experiments has been produced.
The performance of the PSA fitting routine has been investigated, and for the rates
involved with the large STEFF target and large EAR2 collimator was found to be
reliable for NaI detectors in the /1 eV neutron energy range, and for LaBr3 in the
/5 eV range. NaI signals were corrected to match the signals in the parasitic pulses
for count rates of less than 200 kHz, which appears to be the maximum count rate
for which the detector gain variations can be approximated as linear, and should form
174 Conclusion
the neutron ToF region of particular priority for fitting optimization and analysis in
future STEFF measurements at n ToF. The spectra and fold distributions presented
in the current work are based on 911,000 fission events, which were extracted from
the 5106 fission events in the MariaDB database following cuts on the neutron
time-of-flight, Master trigger timing and START-STOP coincidences.
An experiment has been conducted at ILL using FiFI Bragg detector in order to examine
the response of the detector to varying fission fragment masses and atomic numbers. A
calibration function based on ionization signal trace risetimes and amplitudes has been
proposed, which could be used for extraction of fragment masses and atomic numbers.
A comparison has been drawn to SRIM-2013 simulations, assessing the discrepancies
between the simulations and the results of the experiment. The results of the work using
FiFI at ILL have been published in Ref. [121].
7.1 Future work
7.1.1 STEFF
The 2016 experimental data have so far resulted in a set of background-subtracted energy
spectra. These spectra still require neutron-induced signal subtraction as well as multiple
hit subtraction deconvolution. The details of how these operations are applied to STEFF
can be found in the analysis of the ILL campaign [20]. The simulations for producing
the detector response matrix, used for accounting for interactions of the gamma rays
at various energies with STEFF (for example by Compton scattering), are currently
being tested in GEANT4. Deconvolution is a critical step used for converting observed
spectra into the final fission parameters, such as photon multiplicity or average PFG
energy. Following deconvolution, the combined results of the STEFF 235U campaigns
are planned for publication.
The results of the scintillator response examination based on the 2016 STEFF campaign
suggest far superior stability of the LaBr3 scintillators in the n ToF EAR2 environment.
Unlike NaI scintillator, the LaBr3 detectors did not show significant saturation regardless
of pulse type and neutron energy range (excluding regions near gamma-flash). For this
reason, any future STEFF experiments at n ToF should be conducted with as many
LaBr3 crystals as can be obtained. A further test of these detectors can be conducted
using the data available from the 2019 239Pu campaign, which used two clusters of three
LaBr3 crystals. The plutonium campaign was conducted with the narrow n ToF EAR2
collimator, and could therefore also provide a further test of the NaI detectors, as the
saturation effects should be less drastic. Since it is unlikely that the detectors operated
Conclusion 175
in the count rate regions where the gain drift is linear, the method for correcting the
signals proposed in this work may prove beneficial in the analysis of that dataset and
perhaps future STEFF experiments.
Fission fragment waveforms have also been stored in the MariaDB database, but have
not been analyzed as part of this work. Their analysis is ongoing, performed by a
PhD student in Manchester, currently focused on gain-matching the anode pads in the
two main arms of STEFF. Based on gain-matching coefficients, summed traces will be
constructed, representing the entire ionization signal. Such summed traces can be used
for extracting the kinetic energy of the fragments entering the detector volume, which in
turn can be combined with the ToF measurements to produce mass spectra. Following
completion of mass calculations, a calibration for atomic number extraction developed
as part of this work may be applied.
7.1.2 FiFI
A proposal [178] has been accepted by ILL for a follow-up experiment using FiFI with
improved timing foils for measurements of charge-changing effects inside Lohengrin and
testing the atomic number calibration presented in this work for several fill gases. Follow-
ing the 2016 experiment at Lohengrin, foil-making techniques in the Manchester fission
group have been refined and have resulted in thinner Mylar foils (estimated to be <
100 nm thick based on foil colour). Time permitting, running Lohengrin beams with
identical settings for both timing detectors, as well as only START detector and then
only STOP detector would allow for an accurate characterization of timing resolution
of the new foils, as well as determination of smearing effects of each foil individually. A
characterization of these foils will inform further developments of FiFI work and, likely,
STEFF as a result.
A collaboration has been proposed between the Manchester fission group and the fission
group at the Uppsala University in Sweden. The collaboration will aim to combine
silicon detectors used on VERDI with the time-of-flight section of FiFI to investigate
the plasma delay time in silicon as a function of fragment mass, energy and atomic
number at Lohengrin. FiFI ToF section will serve as an absolute time reference for the
comparison with Si signal timing. The proposal for the measurement [179] is currently
awaiting decision by the ILL Scientific Council with the plan for the experiment to take
place immediately after the 2020 FiFI run.
