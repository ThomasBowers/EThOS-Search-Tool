Phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider
Abstract:
The search for physics Beyond the Standard Model is the underlying motivation for
the physics programme of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In this thesis we
will present studies into the Large Hadron Collider phenomenology of dark matter
inspired extensions to the Standard Model, di-Higgs + 2 jet (hhjj) production, CP
violating effects in the Higgs sector, and the use of shape information from top
polarisation measurements in searches for new physics.
Full scans of the parameter space of Simplified Dark Matter models are demon-
strated to be viable and allow for intriguing comparisons to relic density constraints.
Strongly self-interacting dark sectors are shown to leave a potentially measurable
imprint on the energy scaling of mediator production. The weak boson fusion in-
duced production of hhjj turns out to be sensitive to a number of new physics
effects, including CP violation in the Higgs sector. The use of top polarisation mea-
surements to discover new physics which predicts polarised resonances is shown to
be an effective way to ameliorate the loss of shape information for kinematically
challenging regions of parameter space.
Keywords: particle physics phenomenology, collider phenomenology, Higgs physics,
dark matter physics, top quark physics

Introduction
The Large Hadron Collider is currently exploring the highest energies ever probed
systematically by a man-made experiment. After its seminal discovery of the Higgs
boson in 2012 [6,7] we are now at a crossroads: if further new physics exists within
its energy range, it should show up at any moment as the 13 TeV run quickly
approaches 100 fb1 of integrated luminosity [8]. If such new physics is discovered
it will finally herald the end of the era of the Standard Model, which has lasted for
almost five decades and has established quantum field theory as arguably the most
successful theoretical paradigm for describing the world ever conceived. Whatever
shape the discovery would take, it would surely revolutionise our understanding of
the fundamental physical laws of nature and open up completely new frontiers to
explore.
If no new physics is discovered within the Large Hadron Collider energy range
we are instead left in the confusing situation where we know the Standard Model
is deeply flawed and new physics is required to explain both large and small-scale
observations, but we are unable to find any direct evidence for the nature of this
new physics. We would instead have to turn to precision measurements of Standard
Model predictions in order to search for indirect hints of the underlying structure
of the higher energy completion. The Higgs and top quarks sectors are excellent
candidates for such measurements, as they are the heaviest particles in the Standard
Model and the least explored experimentally.
Advances in precision cosmology and astronomy will also offer new experimental
results which will have an increasing impact on particle physics. In this regard the
search for dark matter is an early example of how such an interplay can manifest:
the firm establishment of the CDM Standard Model of cosmology has led to a
large number of effectively particle physics experiments which search for hints of the
microscopic nature of dark matter. Colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider also
provide considerable information about these expected extensions of the Standard
Model, and connecting collider measurements to large scale observations such as the
2 Chapter 1. Introduction
relic density is an interesting problem in itself.
In this thesis we will discuss the phenomenology of new physics searches at
the Large Hadron Collider, with a focus on the Higgs and top quark sectors of
the Standard Model, and extensions which are motivated by dark matter. Chap-
ter 2 introduces the Standard Model and the calculational tools which will be used
throughout the rest of the thesis. Chapter 3 discusses the arguments for the exis-
tence of physics Beyond the Standard Model, focusing on the nature of electroweak
symmetry breaking and dark matter.
The remainder of the thesis consists of novel studies into these topics. In Chap-
ter 4 we perform a full parameter scan of a so-called Simplified Dark Matter model,
and connect it to a calculation of the relic density. Chapter 5 considers the collider
phenomenological consequences of adding a mostly secluded dark sector with strong
self-interactions to the Standard Model, connected through a Higgs portal. In Chap-
ter 6 we present a thorough study of hhjj production at the LHC, both through
gluon fusion using a full leading order matrix element calculation, and through weak
boson fusion. We also investigate perturbative unitarity constraints on CP violating
effects in the Higgs sector, using the hhjj analysis to get a handle on a certain type
of effect. In Chapter 7 we investigate the use of top polarisation measurements in top
resonance searches, and demonstrate their utility by applying them to a benchmark
Randall-Sundrum model.
In Chapter 8 we finally present some concluding remarks.

2.1 Representations of the Lorentz group
A particle is associated with a unique irreducible representation of the Poincar
group ISO(1, 3), as required by the transformation properties we expect from par-
ticles under Poincar transformations. All of the unitary representations we use in
quantum theories are infinite-dimensional and have been classified by Wigner using
the method of induced representations. The classification is given by a non-negative
massm and a spin representation given by a non-negative half-integer [9]. In general
it is impossible to build a consistent relativistic quantum theory without interpreting
particles as excitations of quantised fields rather than as quantised particles [10]. We
will therefore build our quantum theory lagrangians out of operator-valued fields, so
we are interested in representations of the proper orthochronous real Lorentz group
SO+(1, 3;R). Representations of this group are most easily found by making the
observation that we can define a complexified linear combination of the generators
which creates a pair of two commuting su(2) subalgebras, implying that:
C so(1, 3) ' su(2) su(2). (2.1)
Thus we can find irreducible representations of the complexified Lorentz group
by using the well-known irreducible representations of su(2). We might worry that
complexifying the algebra in order to make the connection to SU(2) introduces
complex representations that act strangely when embedded in real space. This is in
fact what allows us to find spinor representations which are not real representations
of SO+(1, 3;R) since they dont map rotations by 2 to the identity element. It
is as if these representations have some internal coordinates to perform a Mbius
rotation in. This can be understood physically as we are ultimately interested in
representations which on top of their normal properties additionally also allow group
elements to change the phase of a state since we cant distinguish this in practice by
quantum mechanics. These projective representations of SO+(1, 3;R) correspond
exactly to those of its spin group SL(2,C), rendering spinors physical in a quantum
theory [11].
When interpreting the excitations of a field as particle states these must fall into
one of Wigners classes. The spin of a particle is determined by its transformation
properties under the Little Group, the subgroup of ISO(1, 3) under which its mo-
mentum is invariant. The Little Group is SO(3) for massive particles and ISO(2)

representations of so(3) are projective.
for massless particles, both of which are finite-dimensional, and in particular the
projective representations of SO(3) are given by the representations of SU(2), al-
lowing half-integer spins. The irreducible Lorentz-representations of the fields do
not in general decompose into irreducible representations of the Little Group, and
in order to embed particles we need to make sure that only a single irreducible spin
representation propagates by projecting it out with the equations of motion.
The su(2)  su(2) representations used in the Standard Model are detailed in
Table 2.1, together with the projective so(3) representations that can be embedded
in these.
The first of these is the singlet representation (0, 0) which acts on scalars. It
carries no Lorentz indices and therefore transforms trivially under Lorentz transfor-
mations. In the Standard Model only the Higgs field transforms under this repre-
sentation.
The two following representations are the left-handed and right-handed Weyl
spinor representations (1/2, 0) and (0, 1/2). Since the two su(2) representations in
these cases are not equal we can imagine using fields which transform under these to
construct theories which are not invariant under (A,B)  (B,A) transformations:
such theories are called chiral and the Standard Model is an example of such a
theory. Weyl spinors have two degrees of freedom, usually denoted by dotted and
undotted indices for right- and left-handed Weyl spinors respectively:
L = 
, R = ,  =
() , (2.2)
They can be used to write down a Lorentz invariant theory of massless fermions,
however if the fermion is charged a mass term ends up mixing left- and right-
handed spinors which necessitates the use of Dirac spinors. These combine pairs of
Giving all non-scalar massless particles two degrees of freedom corresponding to positive and
negative helicity.
There is (as always) a very lucid physical discussion of this in Feynman Vol. 3, Lecture 6 [12].

left- and right-handed spinors into a single object with four degrees of freedom for
describing massive fermions, which transform in the reducible Dirac representation
, 0) (0, 1
. (2.3)
When working with the Dirac representation it is helpful to introduce Dirac or
gamma matrices defined through the following anti-commutation relation:
{, } = 2g . (2.4)
This is the Clifford algebra of Minkowski space. In the Weyl basis these gamma
matrices are given by:
 0
 = (1, ~)
 = (1,~)
. (2.5)
Here i are the Pauli matrices. While we will only use the Weyl representations
when writing down the Standard Model it turns out that the Dirac representation is
very useful when describing physics after electroweak symmetry breaking, in partic-
ular Quantum Electrodynamics is not a chiral theory and calculations can therefore
be simplified by considering Dirac spinors and gamma matrices rather than Weyl
spinors and Pauli matrices. When working with Weyl spinors embedded into Dirac
spinors it is very useful to be able to project out the Weyl spinors when needed.
This can be achieved with the following chirality operators:
PL,R =
(I 5) =
(I i0123), (2.6)
The final representation used is the Lorentz vector (1/2, 1/2) which acts on real
4-vectors. As can be seen in Table 2.1 this representation can be used to describe
both spin-0 and spin-1 representations of so(3): when writing down the Standard
Model we will only be interested in using it for spin-1 particles, which can be achieved
by using the equations of motion to project out the spin-1 component only. This is
in general achieved by using the Proca lagrangian:
L = 1
F 2 +
 . (2.7)
The terms used here will be defined later in Section 2.4.1.
2.2. Path Integral Formulation of Quantum Field Theory 7
We will in general introduce vector fields as connections which ensure local gauge
invariance under the Standard Model gauge group. This will disallow the mass
term and indeed all of the vector fields in the standard model are massless before
symmetry breaking, however Equation 2.7 can arise in a gauge-invariant manner for
a non-compact U(1) gauge group through the Stckelberg mechanism [13].
For the purpose of constructing Lorentz-invariant operators it is also useful to
note the (covariant) derivative  (D) is a Lorentz vector.
2.2 Path Integral Formulation of Quantum Field Theory
When working in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) it is often preferable to use path
integral quantization over the canonical approach of promoting classical fields to
continuous operator distributions acting on the Fock space. The central object in
path integral quantisation is the generating functional:
Z(J) = exp(iW (J)) =
DDDDA exp
iS + iJ [, , , A]
, (2.8)
where S =
d4xL is the classical action, the path integral measure D denotes
integration over all configurations of , and J [, , , A] can be used to generate
a dynamic field at a point x by taking a functional derivative with respect to the
appropriate classical source J(x). When writing down a classical action of fermions
in order to define the path integral we have to introduce Grassmann-valued fields to
mimic the desired behaviour. The functional path integral is dominated by classical
trajectories which minimise the action, but also receives quantum corrections from
paths which are slightly deformed from these: in this sense the path integral formu-
lation can be considered a quantum generalisation of the principle of least action.
In this formulation the Lorentz and gauge symmetries are manifest, and it therefore
often gives additional insight into QFTs. For example quantum anomalies show up
when a classical symmetry deforms the path integral measure D  |J |D, and
the Jacobian itself is a functional of the fields.
Starting with the generating functional the Feynman rules for propagators can
be determined from the kinematic terms in the free action, and those for vertices are
dictated by the interaction terms. We can calculate time-ordered n-point correla-
tion functions by taking n functional derivatives with respect to the correct classical
sources. This allows for a convenient way of performing the perturbative expansion

in the interaction strength g to generate all Feynman diagrams up to a certain order,
and in this way we can interpretW (J) as the sum of all connected diagrams. As out-
lined by the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula [14], the S-matrix
which governs physical scattering amplitudes between asymptotic free on-shell states
is given exactly by projecting out these states from the correlation functions.
2.3 Renormalisation and Scale Dependence
When performing calculations in QFT we will generically find ultraviolet (UV) di-
vergences. These are encountered when integrating loop momenta and signal that
we include effects from arbitrarily short length physics. For example the diagram in
Figure 2.1 will, after performing the spinor algebra and dropping the mass terms in
the denominator, give rise to the following divergent term (among others):

When we naively interpret a bare parameter in a lagrangian in terms of a mea-
sured physical value we make the claim that our theory is valid up to arbitrary
scales and try to include contributions from all scales in the parameter value, which
is made explicit when integrating over the loop momentum l and taking the limit
|l|max . Physically we could reason that quantum corrections have an ultimate
cutoff scale given by the Planck scale Planck. Following Wilson [15] we could there-
fore define our lagrangian at some scale  < Planck and not worry about |l| > 
which would give finite results. However we are interested in using measurements
to make predictions at scales p0   and would prefer if the physics at the Planck
scale didnt affect these too much, so we will take a different approach and instead
redefine the terms in the lagrangian to reflect this hope:
ZA(p0)A
R(p0) = (1 + A(p0))A
R(p0), (2.10)
g0 =Zg(p0)gR(p0) = (1 + g(p0))gR(p0), . . . (2.11)
2.3. Renormalisation and Scale Dependence 9
We can then try to use the counterterm s to subtract away terms associated
with physics at much higher scales than the measurement scale, and equate the
renormalised objects AR(p0), gR(p0), and so on with the physical objects we are
actually dealing with at this measurement scale. If all UV divergences in the theory
can be removed by fixing the available counterterms the theory is called renormalis-
able, which signals that it does not have a cutoff scale. A non-renormalisable theory
will in general have a cutoff scale above which it can not be used to calculate pre-
dictions reliably. We have already indicated that we expect the s and renormalised
parameters at p0 to now depend on the scale p0 since we will use the s to subtract
a term that will be  log /p0, and the renormalised parameters must cancel this
to remove any dependence from the bare parameters.
In order to perform the necessary regularisation we could for example introduce
the new heavy mass scale  explicitly by hand to cancel contributions to loops for
|l| > . An example of this is Pauli-Villars regularization which introduces new
unphysical particles at  which cancel the physical contributions to loop integrals
from momentum modes with |l|   [16]. We can then renormalise the theory by
using the counterterms to set the values of the renormalised parameters to those
measured in experiment at some scale p0, which allows us to regularise calculations
in the theory at this scale even if the bare objects and counterterms diverge as we
take . In practice we would have to define a specific renormalisation scheme
which would tell us which of the finite terms from the loop calculation we keep in
the renormalised parameter and which we subtract away with the divergence. The
physics should of course not depend on this choice.
For most practical purposes Pauli-Villars regularisation is not very convenient
since it breaks non-Abelian gauge invariance, and Dimensional Regularisation (DR)
is used instead: loop integrals are calculated in d = 4  2 dimensions and the
divergences show up as 1
poles when we take the physical limit  0. Taking the
diagram in Figure 2.1 as an example, in the numerator we have:
(/l  /p+M)(/l +M)
= 4(M2 + l2  l.p) . (2.12)
We will focus on the M2 term which can be pulled out of the integral and which
we will ignore for now and drop the mass terms in the denominator, giving us the
integral we mentioned above. We will also explicitly insert the coupling g which we
keep dimensionless using an arbitrary parameter  with mass dimension 1:
We will discuss the mass dimensions of fields later, but to be self-contained we here assume

Here we have only kept finite and divergent terms as   0 and already pulled
factors of E and log 4 into 1
on the last line. This can again be subtracted by a
counterterm, and only subtracting the divergent part corresponds to the so-called
MS renormalisation scheme. In order to keep the the bare couplings dimensionless
we again had to introduce a new mass scale , which plays the same role as the
renormalisation scale p0 in Pauli-Villars. This appearance of an unphysical mass
scale is an unavoidable feature of any regularisation method. Using the Wilsonian
language, it is equivalent to the scale at which we define our effective lagrangian:
starting with the lagrangian at the actual cutoff we have integrated out momenta
down to , and the generic logarithms with ratios of scales which appear as in
Equation 2.13 have been resummed and incorporated into the definition of the pa-
rameters themselves as in Equations 2.10, 2.11. This result suggests we should try
to use a lagrangian defined at 2  p2 to avoid large logarithms when calculating
predictions for a process with a typical scale p2, and post hoc rationalises why the
counterterm approach is the correct way to deal with UV divergences in a particle
physics context where the actual cutoff of the theory could be very far away.
The invariance of the bare lagrangian to variations in the unphysical scale  can
be used to calculate how the renormalised parameters change with :
g0 = 0 
(Zg()gR()) = 0 . (2.14)
Extending the same logic of invariance under the unphysical renormalisation
scale  to bare n-point A correlation functions Gn0 , where A
0 has been renormalised
as in Equation 2.11, gives an example of a Callan-Symanzik equation [17]:
the particle in the loop is a fermion and the particle whose self-energy we are calculating is a scalar,
which gives [g] = d d2

GnR = 0 . (2.15)
This allows us to define the so-called beta functions  and anomalous dimensions
(gR) = 
dgR()
, A =
. (2.16)
The beta functions tell us exactly how dimensionless parameters change as we
integrate down from the bare lagrangian, or in a particle physics context, how they
change as we perform calculations at different scales. The anomalous dimensions
tell us how the scaling behaviour of dimensionful objects differs from the classical
scaling expected based on their mass dimension. The combination of all the beta
functions for a theory is called the renormalisation group equations (RGEs) and
therefore tells us how to convert a theory with parameters measured at one scale
into the equivalent theory at some other scale. While the bare lagrangian must be
invariant under the arbitrary scale  and all orders calculations therefore can not
have a dependence on , the fixed order perturbation theory calculations we typi-
cally use in practice do have a dependence on  so in this sense the beta functions
are approximations of physical corrections. The RGEs can therefore be used to gain
qualitative insights into the behaviour of the theory at energy ranges outside of
those experimentally probed, and as a shortcut to calculating the full quantum cor-
rections to an observable when they are expected to be dominated by the resummed
logarithms. A useful thing to notice is that the appearance of logarithms of the type
which are resummed by the beta functions always is accompanied by the
divergent 1
pieces: this allows us to calculate the beta functions efficiently by only
focusing on the divergent parts of diagrams which contribute to them.
The condition that we can regularise all UV divergences in a theory with a finite
number of counterterms is called renormalisability. A renormalisable theory can
in theory be used to obtain predictions at any scale once we have performed the
necessary measurements to find the values of all of the parameters at one scale, and
renormalisability is therefore considered a desireable feature of a theory.
Theories with massless particles will in general also have infrared divergences which ultimately
cancel between loop and phase space integrals when dealing with inclusive observables, as shown
by Kinoshita, Lee, and Naunberg [18,19].
12 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .
2.4 Introduction to the Standard Model
The Standard Model is the crowning achievement of hundreds of years of investi-
gations into the fundamental nature of the physical world. It uses the language of
Quantum Field Theory introduced in the previous section and successfully describes
empirical results gathered from thousands of experiments covering many orders of
magnitude in energy. In theory it could be argued that it is obtainable in a fairly
elegant way by postulating a gauge group GSM = SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y and
writing down all of the invariant and renormalisable operators which can be formed
making the modest assumptions that there is some fermion matter content and a
complex scalar with a quartic potential. The lagrangian then takes the general form
(assuming the only dimensionful parameter is the 2 term in the scalar potential):
LSM =
GAG
A  1
W IW
I  1
 (Gauge sector) (2.17)
+ (DH)
(DH) 2HH  (HH)2 (Higgs sector) (2.18)

abL,b + i
(D)
cdR,d (Fermion sector) (2.19)
 (aY abbH + cY cddH + h.c.) (Yukawa sector) (2.20)
Eventually we add the assumptions that the complex scalar tranforms non-
trivially under the SU(2)L  U(1)Y subgroup and breaks this down to U(1)QED
thanks to a non-zero vacuum expectation value, achieved by assigning 2 < 0.
In practice this is a beautiful lie which looks good on t-shirts but ignores all of
the undeniable strangeness in the details that are required to fill in this outline.
Taking a step back and looking at the space of possible QFTs we can draw a parallel
to the Aarne-Thompson classification system for fairytales [20,21]: lets assume the
Standard Model belongs to an archetype refered to as the Snow White QFTs. This
suggests we have a reasonable idea of the characteristics of the main character and
her companions, who the antagonist is, and how the fairytale plays out. However
while this is strictly speaking true, when reading the book of the Standard Model
we are immediately introduced to five sets of triplet dwarves, two of which are left-
handed and three of which are right-handed and all of which have customary evil
twins. Within each dwarf triplet there is a size hierarchy that goes from miniscule
Note that only a scalar can have a Lorentz-invariant non-zero vacuum expectation value.

Which is effectively infinite, but we could imagine requiring some reasonable measure of
simplicity and elegance to end up with a practical list.
2.4. Introduction to the Standard Model 13
to huge (with one of the dwarfs in particular being a giant the size of a house). At
the end of the story we are not filled with the satisfaction of having read a classic
fairytale, rather we are left wondering what possibly could have compelled someone
to come up with such a contrived scenario just to tell a simple story. Upon closer
inspection we notice that there is structure and logic to the madness, but ultimately
we are still left with more questions than answers. The Standard Model appears to
be a fairytale  la Nostradamus, and the interesting details are often well-hidden in
nooks and crannies that have to be meticulously explored. In this way, even though
it appears far from a well-presented story at first, it has managed to remain the
central object of attention in the particle physics community for decades.
This innate strangeness, present even before we consider any of the number of
theoretical and experimental problems we know to be present in the Standard Model
as presented here, is often internalised through daily exposure among practitioners
in the field as we are wont to bleed the everyday of its peculiarities. It is however
of scientific interest as 13 of the 19 free parameters of the model originate from
this hierarchical three-generation structure of the fermion sector, see Table 2.2.
We will later investigate techniques for discvering a model which explains the mass
hierarchy of the fermion sector by introducing a warped extra dimension [22, 23] in
Chapter 7.
Before having a look at each section of the lagrangian in more detail we can
already determine the mass dimensions of all of the fields in the lagrangian: S =
d4xL suggests [L] = [d4x] since we want the action to be dimensionless. We will
in general operate with [h] = [c] = 1 which implies [x] = [1 ] = [E
1] = [M1],
which leads us to conclude the mass dimension of every term in the lagrangian must
be 4, or 4 2 when using dimensional regularisation.
From the Higgs kinetic term we can see that [H] = 1. The mass dimensions of
the field strength tensors can also be determined to be 2, and we will later see that
this expands into gauge fields A with mass dimension 1. The mass dimension of
the chiral fermions can be determined from their kinetic terms to be 3/2.
We can now see that all of the operators in the Standard Model carry four di-
mensions of mass in their field and derivative content alone, with a single exception:
the 2H2 term. This term therefore breaks the classical conformal invariance that
Note that I dont include the masses and mixing angles of the neutrino sector which addition-
ally complicate the simple picture presented here and would bring this number to at least 20 out
of 26.

is present in the rest of the theory by introducing a dimensionful coefficient . We
could equally imagine introducing operators which have a mass dimension > 4 in
their field and derivative content, which therefore would have coefficients of nega-
tive mass dimension. In general, operators O and their coefficients C are classified
according to the mass dimension of their field and derivative content as:
 Relevant: [O] = d < 4, [C] = 4 d
 Marginal: [O] = d = 4, [C] = 0
 Irrelevant: [O] = d > 4, [C] = 4 d
The naming convention is connected to the scale dependence we had to introduce
when renormalizing a theory discussed in Section 2.3. The name irrelevant origi-
nates from attempts to understand why physical solid state systems with widely
different microscopic descriptions fall into a small number of simpler classes in the

infrared (IR) or low energy regime. The modern way to explain this is through
the observation [15] that only relevant and marginal operators contribute to the
macroscopic low-energy description of a system, and these can be systematically
studied in the same way weve been able to write down all of the allowed operators
under the Lorentz and gauge symmetries we impose. The microscopic differences
enter through irrelevant operators which only contribute at higher scales (smaller
lengths). In high-energy physics we are usually interested in the high-energy be-
haviour of our theory, so we might wonder why there are no higher mass dimension
operators in the Standard Model. In general this is a consequence of requiring
all of the operators to be renormalisable [26] which means it is, in theory, predic-
tive up to an arbitrary energy scale. A better way to motivate the absence of
non-renormalizable operators is through the Wilsonian picture of renormalisation
discussed in Section 2.3: assuming the cutoff scale of the more complete theory of
which the Standard Model is a low-energy description is much higher than the weak
scale, any irrelevant operators which do contribute to the theory at this higher scale
will be completely negligible at the weak scale.
However there is no reason to believe the Standard Model is the final theory of
nature up to a very high scale: as we will later discuss there are many unsolved
problems both in small- and large-scale physics which strongly suggest it must be
only an effective description of a more fundamental theory which is not necessarily
widely separated in scale. We can then write down higher-dimensional irrelevant
operators suppressed by powers of this scale, which make increasing contributions at
smaller length scales. While such theories are non-renormalisable, and hence come
up with a cutoff scale above which they can not be used to calculate predictions
(given by  ), we can operate perfectly well within the range of validity and even
calculate quantum corrections by limiting our expansion in  to a certain order.
This is motivated by the fact that new effects will take the form (|p|/)n where |p|
is the scale of the interaction we study. As long as |p|   we are able to quickly
cut off the expansion in |p|/ since higher order terms will be suppressed. Note that
it is this suppression by |p|/ which renders these operators irrelevant in the IR and
increases their significance at higher scales. That the expansion starts breaking down
just as the size of the effect loses its mass-scale suppression is a fundamental feature
of these Effective Field Theories (EFT), and means they are best used to describe
small deformations from the Standard Model expectation. Calculating quantum

corrections requires that we include all of the necessary operators in order to be
able to cancel UV-divergences with new structures not present in the renormalisable
theory which will generically appear. This is guaranteed to be the case if we use all of
the Lorentz- and gauge-invariant operators that can be formed out of the fields of the
theory up to the inverse power of  we calculate to. A set of effective operators up
to a certain order in the expansion is called a basis; in general we can not construct
a complete and unique basis of operators for a given order of  due to redundancies
introduced by the classical equations of motion and integration-by-parts identities.
A complete basis of dimension-6 ( 1/2) operators in the Standard Model is given
in [27].
Having discussed and motivated the general form of the Standard Model la-
grangian, we will have a more detailed look at the individual components:
2.4.1 Gauge sector
The gauge sector Equation 2.17 describes the dynamics associated with the local,
internal symmetries of the Standard Model given by GSM . It is built exclusively out
of field strength tensors, which for SU(N) gauge theories are given by:
F a = A
  Aa + gfabcAbAc . (2.21)
Here Aa is a gauge vector field in the direction of the generator t
a of the algebra
su(N). The generators satisfy: [
ta, tb
= ifabctc . (2.22)
To ensure the defining local invariance under gauge transformations, the deriva-
tive operator is elevated to a covariant derivative when operating on a field that
transforms non-trivially under GSM :
(D)ij =   ig()Aa,() t
a,()
ij . (2.23)
The expansion over () is done in accordance with the representations of GSM the
target field transforms in, for example for the left-handed quark doublet which is
charged under all of the subgroups:
(DqL)
j = (  igsTAGA  ig2 IjkW I  ig1YqB)q
L . (2.24)
for the effects to be completely unobservable.
For U(1) gauge theories the last piece disappears and we are left with a Maxwell tensor.
2.4. Introduction to the Standard Model 17
Here gs, g2, and g1 are the gauge coupling constants of SU(3)C , SU(2)L, and U(1)Y
respectively, which determine the strength of said gauge interactions. TA = 1
and  I = 1
I are the generators of the fundamental representations of su(3) and
su(2) respectively, and the greek and latin indices on q denote the colour and isospin
degrees of freedom on which they act while the A and I denote the indices of the
adjoint representations to which G and W belong. The generator of the U(1)Y
algebra is just a single commuting real number Y . The covariant derivative of the
field strength is given by:
(DF)
a = F
  igAb(tbadj)acF c = F a + gfabcAbF c , (2.25)
where we used (taadj)
bc = ifabc and swapped indices on the structure constant.
For an Abelian group the second term is of course absent, however for non-Abelian
groups like SU(2)L and SU(3)C this term generates self-interactions among the
gauge bosons themselves. As we will see later this simple result creates significant
physical differences between Yang-Mills (SU(N)) and Abelian ( Maxwell) gauge
theories, and is responsible for the confinement of SU(3)C at low energies which
swaps the degrees of freedom in the theory from coloured quarks to colour-neutral
hadrons and mesons.
When quantizing a gauge theory we run into a problem: the determinant of the
operator k2g  kk is 0, so we cant invert it in order to find the propagator
using the standard Greens function approach [28]. This is not surprising since the
freedom to perform gauge transformations means it is impossible to uniquely solve
for A, which equally makes it impossible to construct the free theory in order to
use perturbation theory. In the path integral approach the situation is clarified:
integrating over the lagrangian as defined in Equation 2.17 means we sum over
gauge-equivalent field configurations, or gauge orbits, of the classical action, which
gives divergent results. The obvious solution is to fix the gauge before quantizing the
theory. This is elegantly done by using an auxiliary field  as a Lagrange multiplier to
force the integration to only pick up a single unique gauge orbit, following Faddeev-
Popov [29]:
Lg.f. = 
(Aa)
2 . (2.26)
When adding this term to the classical action we break the gauge invariance and end
up cancelling the integration over equivalent gauge orbits when calculating Greens
functions, leaving the physical result ( is guaranteed to cancel in the end). There
is one additional subtlety to deal with: when using non-Abelian groups, the extra
18 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .
factor we use to define the integration over equivalent gauge orbits is a functional
of A and not simply a number that automatically cancels. The customary way to
deal with this is to rewrite this term using two Grassmann-valued fields c and c for
each gauge field. The lagrangian for these is given by:
Lghost = caDac cc = ca(ac + gfabcAb)cc . (2.27)
The new fields are called ghosts due to being anti-commuting complex scalars. The
spin-statistics theorem means they can not be physical states, but they do appear
in the path integral. From a practical perspective the ghosts can be understood
as a way to remove unphysical degrees of freedom from virtual gauge bosons: when
we take gauge bosons off-shell we are naively not guaranteed that the number of
degrees of freedom stays physical. In Abelian theories the Ward identity guarantees
that longitudinal polarisations cancel in the final result, but due to the gauge boson
self-interactions which are present in non-Abelian theories there is no simple similar
identity for non-Abelian theories. Heuristically the fermionic 1 which will accom-
pany ghost loops can then be considered to cancel the unphysical contribution from
longitudinal gauge boson polarisations.
2.4.2 Higgs sector
The Higgs sector Equation 2.18 describes how the electroweak group SU(2)LU(1)Y
is broken down to U(1)QED [30,31] by a complex scalar H in the (2, 12) electroweak
gauge representation. Until recently it was the only part of the Standard Model
which had not been experimentally verified, but following the seminal discovery by
ATLAS and CMS in 2012 [6, 7] of a scalar consistent with the properties expected
of a Standard Model Higgs boson we are currently quickly moving towards an era
of precision Higgs physics.
The sign of the mass term of the H field in the Higgs potential Equation 2.18 is
of fundamental importance. This is because it is exactly when the mass term has
the opposite sign to the quartic interaction term (2 < 0) that the Higgs potential
develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value, H0 6= 0. Without loss of generality
we can choose the resulting vacuum expectation value to be real and in the second
component of the Higgs doublet:
Another way to understand the absense of ghosts in Abelian gauge theories is through the for-
mal definition of an Abelian group which is exactly that fabc = 0, forcing the ghosts to completely
decouple from the rest of the theory.
2.4. Introduction to the Standard Model 19
H = exp
v + h
, v =
. (2.28)
Here we have written H in terms of the Goldstone bosons a of the symmetry
breaking in a sigma form. The Goldstone bosons are perturbations along directions
on the vacuum manifold given by the broken generators, so a = 1
a here. This is a
generic way to parameterize the Goldstones bosons which arise when the vacuum of
a theory is only invariant under a subgroup H of the full lagrangian symmetry group
G as in our situation. When working with spontaneously broken gauge theories the
gauge-fixing term in Equation 2.26 needs to be modified to include the Goldstone
bosons. A convenient choice is the R gauge [32] which modifies the gauge-fixing
term thus:
Lg.f. = 
(Aa  mAa)2 . (2.29)
After performing the Faddeev-Popov procedure we pick up mass terms
for the Goldstone bosons and the ghosts. Unitary gauge is then defined as taking
  , or equivalently a = 0. This is the gauge we will use to study the effects
of breaking SU(2)L U(1)Y with a non-zero v. When expanding out the covariant
derivative we see that v generates mass terms for the W I and B bosons:

massless A boson is associated with the unbroken Abelian generator Q = 3 +
1/2 Y = diag(1, 0) and is identified as the photon  of U(1)QED. After rotating
all of the terms in the full lagrangian to these mass eigenstates we have found the

lagrangian after symmetry breaking. In non-unitary gauges the interactions of the
Goldstone bosons a also have to be kept track of.
The U(1)QED interaction strength is set by e = g2 sin W . Due to the large
masses of W and Z their effects are highly suppressed at the scales of everyday
interactions. Looking at the remaining degrees of freedom of H we identify the
would-be Goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking a = 0,  with the new
longitudinal degrees of freedom of W and Z, however they do show up explicitly
in calculations when not in unitary gauge. There is a remaining degree of freedom
which describes fluctuations around v, and so is described by a real singlet scalar
h. Note that since it appears linearly with v, all of its couplings to other fields are
scaled by their mass after symmetry breaking. This real scalar is often referred to
as the Higgs boson and can be identified with the resonance found by ATLAS and
CMS [6,7] withmh  125 GeV. The production cross sections of the most important
production modes are given in Table 2.3 and the branching fractions of the most
important decay modes are given in Table 2.4.

di-photon invariant mass distribution from the CMS discovery paper is shown in

2.4.2.1 Perturbative unitarity in longitudinal gauge boson scattering
In order to show the physical significance of the Higgs boson, we will consider
scattering of longitudinally polarised weak gauge bosons. As explained above these
polarisations correspond to three of the four degrees of freedom in H. Since they
are the physical manifestation of electroweak symmetry breaking in the sense that
22 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .

they allow the weak bosons to appear massive, they encode information about the
broken symmetries. Gauge symmetries will in general ensure unitary behaviour of
high energy vector boson scattering, so it is interesting to investigate what the high
energy behaviour of these states is. In order to do so we will make use of partial wave
analysis in order to determine whether these scattering processes are perturbatively
unitary: such analysis is also later used in Chapter 6, so we will introduce the
formalism here to remain self-contained, using Schwartz as our reference [28].
In general, the total cross section of scattering of two particles AB  AB at a
center-of-mass energy
s can be calculated as:
32E2CM
d cos |M(s, )|2 . (2.34)
Here M(s, ) is the matrix element of the process. This can be decomposed into
partial waves using Legendre polynomials Pj :
M(s, ) = 16
aj(s)(2j + 1)Pj(cos ) . (2.35)
2.4. Introduction to the Standard Model 23
We can also write the aj(s) in terms ofM(s, ):
aj(s) =
d cos Pj(cos )M(s, ) . (2.37)
The decomposition allows us to perform the integral in order to get an expression
for the total cross section as a function of the aj(s) coefficients:
(2j + 1)|aj(s)|2 . (2.38)
The optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering ampli-
tude to the total cross section:
ImM(AB  AB,  = 0) = 2ECM |~p|
(AB  X)
 2ECM |~p|(AB  AB) . (2.39)
Hence:
(2j + 1)Im aj(s) 
2|~p|
(2j + 1)|aj(s)|2 . (2.40)
This places strict bounds on the unitarily allowed values of aj . In practice
the contributions from j > 1 are often small, and the sum over j can be dropped
by considering scattering of angular momentum eigenstates. Consider additionally
elastic scattering where this is an equality and the high energy limit where ECM =
2|~p|. We then simply have:
Im aj(s) = |aj(s)|2 . (2.41)
The solution to this is shown in Figure 2.4. We will calculate the aj(s) using
perturbation theory, so aj(s) = a0j (s)g

This uses the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials:

Note that Pj(1) = 1.
A similar bound follows more generally by taking inelastic scattering into account, but as-
suming elastic scattering yields conservative bounds since taking inelastic scattering into account

effects, the tree level contribution (assuming the leading contribution is tree level)
a0j (s) is real, and will hence in general not sit on the unitary circle: this is shown in
Figure 2.4 as the red dot. This is not a problem since we can expect that going to
all orders will restore unitarity by bringing the solution back to the circle, as shown
by the green dot. Requiring our theory to be perturbative means we should not
allow these higher order contributions to be of the same magnitude as the leading
term, however. This means we need to define a convention for when we consider
perturbative unitarity to be violated by the value of a0j (s): we will take this to
be |Re a0j (s)| > 1 here and in Chapter 6. An alternative choice is |Re a0j (s)| > 1/2
which is motivated by the fact this already would require a 41% correction in exactly
the correct direction on the Argand diagram, and while higher order corrections of
the size 100% are not uncommon in QCD, there is no reason expect these to go in
exactly this direction.
Having thus introduced the machinery for performing partial wave analysis in
order to determine whether or not a scattering process violates perturbative uni-
tary, we return to the scattering of longitudinally polarised weak bosons. We will
consider the process W+L (p1)ZL(p2)  W
L (p3)ZL(p4). In order to calculate we
will need the Feynman rules for WWZ, WWZZ, and V V h vertices given below in
Equations 2.69, 2.70, and 2.71. The contributing diagrams at tree level are given
in Figure 2.5. To simplify the expressions we will use g1 = 0 (so mZ = mW ). The
longitudinal polarisation vectors we use are given by:
N  1 =
2mW p3,
t 2m2W
, N  2 =
2mW p4,
t 2m2W
N  3 =
2mW p1,
t 2m2W
, N  4 =
2mW p2,
t 2m2W
. (2.42)
We take all momenta to be incoming. The amplitudes are then given by:
The normalisation is N =
(t2m2

shows a tree level value of a0j (s) which will in general be unitarity-violating. The
green dot shows an all-order value of aj(s) which must be unitary. Corrections from
inelastic scattering will elongate the unitary circle into an ellipse with Im aj(s) >
|aj(s)|2 and arguments based on the assumption of elastic scattering are therefore
conservative.

We denote these, from the top to bottom and left to right,Ms,Mu,M4, andMh.
After calculating the diagrams we find that using only the first three diagrams
leaves a piece which grows with energy:
Ms +Mu +M4 
. (2.47)
Such a contribution, left as it is, will ensure that our theory can not be pertur-
batively unitary above some energy scale at which this term forces |aj | > 1. The
Higgs diagram adds a piece which has the following behaviour:
v2(tm2h)
. (2.48)
This piece will exactly cancel off the problematic term for t  mh. When
combined with requiring our model to be perturbatively unitarity, this allows us to
calculate a maximum value for mh which allows the cancellation to occur before
the amplitude violates the |aj | > 1 bound. The behaviour for three different cases
in our toy model are presented in Figure 2.6: in the absence of a Higgs (or if it is
very heavy) the amplitude violates perturbative unitarity at
s  2.5 TeV. A light
Higgs, such as the one found at the LHC, completely unitarises the behaviour. A

scattering in our toy model with g1 = 0. The red line shows where perturbative
unitarity is considered violated. While a light Higgs at mh = 125 GeV completely
unitarises the amplitude, a heavy Higgs with mh = 3000 GeV still causes the uni-
tarity bound to be violated at

heavy Higgs which could still be kinematically accessible at the LHC with mh = 3
TeV does not cancel the unitarity-violating behaviour fast enough, and perturbative
unitarity is still violated at
s  3.5 TeV.
We could in fact calculate the first three diagrams in an easier way by using a
Callan-Coleman-Wess-Zumino (CCWZ) expansion [38] since they only involve inter-
actions among the Goldstone bosons, which can be studied using only the pattern
of symmetry breaking. Let us return to the Goldstone matrix in Equation 2.28:
U(x) = exp
= exp
2w+ w0
w0 = 3, w =
(1  i2) . (2.49)
This field was introduced to describe the Goldstone dynamics when G =

perturbations along the broken generator directions which span the vacuum mani-

fold. The CCWZ expansion gives the nonlinear sigma model obtained when decou-
pling h by generating all of the terms allowed by G involving U . To leading order
this is given by:
(U)(
0w0 + w
w+
w0(w
) w(w0)
w0(w+) w+(w0)
. (2.50)
Here I have only included the terms which are relevant for WLZL WLZL scatter-
ing. Since the Goldstone bosons are massless this corresponds to the  = 0 gauge.
In this gauge the w, w0 fields are the longitudinal modes of W and Z and we can
re-calculateMs +Mu +M4 in a single diagram:
iM=0 =
 p1.p3 + p1.p4 + p2.p3  p2.p4
+(p2  p4)
M=0 =
(2.51)
This result follows from the Goldstone Equivalence Theorem [39] which states
that the high energy behaviour (sMW ,MZ) of longitudinal gauge boson scatter-
ing is the same as for Goldstone boson scattering. That we get a result which violates
perturbative unitarity at high energies when using only the CCWZ expansion is not
surprising: it is an effective theory which does not know about the mechanism of
symmetry breaking and is not renormalisable. To mend these issues we need to use
a linear sigma model instead, where it is explicit that the symmetry is spontaneously
broken since we keep the field which describes radial excitations along the vacuum
direction in the theory. This field is exactly h in our setup.
The physical significance of the Higgs boson is therefore that it unitarises inter-
actions between the massive SU(2)L  U(1)Y gauge bosons at high energies where
the longitudinal components (Goldstone modes) dominate. A detailed analysis fol-
lowing the perturbative unitarity argument presented above in the full Standard
Model with all scatterings considered allows a theoretical upper bound to be set on

mh [40]:
 1 TeV . (2.52)
This was a major motivation for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider as
it provided a no-lose theorem: either the Higgs would be discovered, or some other
new physics would have to occur at the TeV-scale to unitarise longitudinal gauge
boson scattering. In Chapter 6 we will make use of perturbative unitarity arguments
to constrain the allowed size of CP violating effects in the Higgs sector.
2.4.2.2 Measuring the Higgs potential
While we have assumed a specific form for the Higgs potential here, the experimental
discovery of the Higgs boson itself can not tell us if this is in fact the actual Higgs
potential realised in nature. Looking at the potential in Equation 2.18 in more
detail:
V (HH) = 2HH + (HH)2  1
h4 . (2.53)
Now m2h = 22 can be interpreted as the coefficient of the first term in an ex-
pansion in powers of h. We can infer the value of the trilinear coupling 3SM =
in the Standard Model using the assumed relation given in Equation 2.28 but from
a model-independent perspective we can not determine its value with our current
experimental measurements. The measurement of h hh is however very challeng-
ing as it suffers from very low signal rates, partly due to destructive interference
between box and triangle diagrams in the leading gluon fusion production chan-
nel, see Figure 2.8. A measurement of the trilinear coefficient is hence one of the
ultimate challenges and goals of the LHC physics program [41]. In Chapter 6 we
will investigate the phenomenology of the di-Higgs + two jets (hhjj) production
channel, and assess the potential contributions it can make to the wider study of
the Higgs sector.
2.4.3 Fermion sector
The Fermion sector in Equation 2.19 describes the kinematic terms of the fermion
fields which make up the matter content of the Standard Model. Since all of the
fields are chiral and charged under at least one gauge group there can be no mass
terms; these are introduced through couplings to H which are described later in
30 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .
Figure 2.7: Example diagrams which contribute to gg  hh at one loop. The
triangle and box contributions interfere destructively, as demonstrated in Figure 2.8
below.

Model coefficient of the trilinear term in the Higgs potential, so SM =

Section. 2.4.4. At this point we can summarise all of the fields of the Standard
Model and their gauge and Lorentz representations, given in Table 2.5. Since the
left- and right-handed fermions carry different charges the Standard Model is a chiral
theory which violates parity.
2.4.4 Yukawa sector
Using the fields we have written down so far we can construct some additional renor-
malisable operators. While we introduced the field H in order to break electroweak
symmetry, we can also form Lorentz- and gauge-invariant operators which couple
this field to various combinations of the fermions. Expanding out after electroweak

3  3 matrices and Mx a real non-negative diagonal 3  3 matrix. We can then

already defined rotations for all the fields in order to diagonalise both matrices, so
interactions which mix up- and down-type quarks end up being sensitive to a resid-
ual unitary mixing matrix V = (Lu)Ld, known as the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix [42,43]. In the mass basis:

This is a unitary complex matrix so it has 9 degrees of freedom: 3 of these are
rotation angles and hence 6 are complex phases. 5 of these phases can be removed
by using the remaining U(1)6 symmetry of the lagrangian:

Having discussed the field content of the Standard Model it is straightforward to
extract the momentum-space propagators by inverting the kinetic terms. Using
Feynman gauge ( = 1) for QCD and unitary gauge (  ) for the electroweak
sector, respectively, with momentum flow from left to right:
As can be seen from considering all components real.
One phase remains since V is invariant under an overall U(1) rotation given by j = j = .

dominant production mode of the Higgs boson is through a top-quark loop in so-
called gluon fusion, it is useful to introduce an effective theory which incorporates
this effect in themt  limit. Such approximations are called low-energy theorems
[4446] since they are only valid for momentum transfers inside the loop which
are smaller than mt. In the limit where the Higgs has zero momentum and is
much lighter than some other particles i in the theory (in the Standard Model this
only applies to the top quark, but in general it is possible to calculate for example
corrections to the h   branching fraction from new heavy fermions charged
under SU(2)L  U(1)Y using this framework), the physical effect of including it is
captured by the replacement
mi  mi
(2.73)
This is thanks to h appearing linearly with v, which generates all of the tree level
mass terms in the Standard Model. Another way of writing this, which extends to
higher order in perturbation theory, is
M(A B + h) =
M(A B)
(2.74)
2.4. Introduction to the Standard Model 37
whereM(A  B) is the matrix element for A  B and the 0 superscript denotes
bare quantities. The effective coupling of two gluons to the Higgs due to infinitely
heavy fermions is therefore encoded in the gluon vacuum polarisation, g  g, which
at loop level receives corrections which depend on bare mass terms. At one loop level,
the gluon vacuum polarisation gets contributions from the diagrams in Figure 2.10.
We are interested in fermions which are heavier than h, so will only focus on the
top quark contribution toMF which will have a dependence on mt, as required by
Equation 2.74. Since we assume the top is infinitely heavy we can drop any pieces
which disappear as p  0. We will use a (b) as the adjoint index of the incoming
(outgoing) gluon, and i, j as the color indices of the quarks in the loop. We then
have:
iMt = (igs)2 taijtbji

where we have only kept the factors of p and p2 which are required for the
propagator structure, and  is the renormalisation scale. We have separated the
traces over spinor indices from traces over generators by using Tr and tr respec-
tively. We have also introduced a new notation for the index of the fundamental
representation T (F )ab  tr[tatb]. This generalises to other representations, so
T (A)ab  tr[taadjtbadj ] and so on. Setting a = b we can see that tr[taRtaR] = d(G)T (R)
where d(G) is the number of generators or dimension of the group. In the fol-
lowing diagrams we will also use the quadratic Casimirs of representations, which
are defined as C(R)Id(R)  taRtaR (a is summed over and d(R) is the dimension of
the representation). This suggests tr[taRt
R] = d(R)C(R), so we have the relation
d(G)T (R) = d(R)C(R). In QCD we are only interested in the fundamental and
adjoint representations, which in our conventions have T (F ) = 1
, C(F ) = N
T (A) = N , C(A) = N . We have kept the dependence on N for a general SU(N)
gauge group explicit here since we will consider such gauge groups later in Chapter 5
and these are useful for reference.
Returning to the calculation at hand, we can now write down the term in the
one loop correction to the gluon propagator which has a dependence on mt in the

mt  limit:
Lgg = 
GAGA [1 + t(0)] , t(0) =

. (2.76)
Differentiating with respect to mt and using T (F ) = 12 , s = g
s/4, we get:
Lggh = 
GAGA
GAGA
(2.77)
We can further derive the low energy theorems for any number of Higgs bosons
coupling to two gluons by making the replacement 1/v  gt/mt, where gt is the
(scaled) Yukawa coupling. Then,
Lgghn =
GAGAg
mn1t
=  s
GAGA
 Lgg(h) =
GAGA log
(2.78)
where we have resummed the logarithm to provide an expression for all n on the last
line. We will use this low energy theorem in Chapter 6 to generate multi-Higgs gluon
fusion events. Note our approximation that the momentum going through the top
loop should be smaller than mt is questionable already for the second term in the
series since 2mh > mt, and for cases where a single Higgs is produced in association
with for example jets since the new scales which can enter the loop quickly begin
to resolve the top threshold. Also note the destructive interference discussed in
Section 2.4.2.2 is reflected in the signs of the ggh and gghh terms.
2.4.6 Renormalisation Group Equations
With the Feynman rules determined, we will return to the discussion of scale de-
pendence in Section 2.3 and calculate the one loop beta function for gs. To begin
we focus on the gluon field counterterm 3 since it will be necessary regardless of
if we try to calculate (gs) using the three-gluon vertex or gluon-fermion-fermion
vertex. The relevant diagrams are given in Figure 2.10.
Taking them in order, we begin with the fermion bubble MF we calculated
above. As pointed out in Section 2.3, the logarithms we are looking to resum cor-
respond to UV divergences, so for the purpose of calculating RGEs we can set all
masses inside loops to 0. This makes the calculation slightly different to Equa-
tion 2.75 and gives:

While we had to go through a fair amount of work to obtain this one loop beta
function for QCD, the fact that beta functions only depend on the UV divergent
parts of the relevant diagrams makes it possible to derive general forms for the
RGEs for renormalisable, perturbative quantum field theories. In Chapter 5 we will
calculate beta functions for extensions of the Standard Model, and make use of such
general results which have been derived in [4850] in order to avoid calculating them
all by hand.

Here yt is Mu3,3 and hence has a value of  0.99 at the top pole, and  =
has a value of  0.13 at the Higgs pole. Note in particular that the -function for gs
is negative: this means gs will become infinitely large in the IR and we can expect
a perturbative description of the physics at this scale to be impossible to find. We
can solve for s(Q2) =
g2s(Q
in terms of the value measured at some scale 2:
4s(
4 + 7s(2) log(
. (2.95)
When the denominator becomes 0 this will dynamically define a new scaleQcrit =
QCD. Measurements of the effective coupling have been performed above the scale
where the perturbative description breaks down and confirm this general picture,
see Figure 2.12, and give QCD  1 GeV. Looking at the form of Equation 2.93
we see that it is exactly the self-interactions among the gluons that give rise to
this behaviour. Note that this feature of SU(3)C has allowed us to generate a
new fundamental scale QCD in our theory through quantum corrections, without
putting it in by hand. This is an example of dimensional transmutation [51] and can
be used to construct extensions to the Standard Model which attempt to explain
the appearance of other scales  Planck, in particular why the weak scale is so
small. In the UV the coupling instead tends to 0 indicating the theory becomes free
at very high scales, a phenomenon referred to as asymptotic freedom. In Chapter 5
we will investigate the hadron collider phenomenology of secluded dark sectors with
QCD-inspired self-interactions using similar RGE scaling behaviour to generate a
scale that can explain the dark matter relic abundance.

2.4.7  and the Strong CP problem
We can add some additional CP violating Lorentz- and gauge-invariant renormalis-
able operators to the gauge sector:
LCPV =
GAG
W IW
BB . (2.96)
These terms arise as a modification of the path integral measure when we per-
form a chiral transformation of a left-handed quark since the chiral symmetry is
anomalous, and similarly for chiral rotations of the other fermion fields (however
since they arent charged under all of the GSM subgroups not all three terms are
generated). We can therefore attempt to remove these terms by performing chi-
ral rotations which leave observables invariant. Since the right-handed fields are
uncharged under SU(2)L we can rotate 2 into the Yukawa couplings using the left-
handed fields and then remove it by rotating the right-handed fields. Similarly we
can use right-handed neutrinos introduced with for example a seesaw mechanism
to rotate 1 away from the neutrino Yukawas after putting it in there, however
since you cant lasso a basketball this term would ultimately not have any physical
effects anyway since all these terms can be rewritten as total derivatives:
While this depends on the specific mechanism we use to introduce neutrino masses and mixing,
it is a fairly generic statement that this is possible.
Or, in a less colloquial manner, k(U(1)) = 0 for k  2, where k is the k-th homotopy group.

When there are no non-trivial mappings of spatial infinity S3 unto the group
elements such terms will disappear when converted into a surface integral.
Since qL, uR, dR all transform under SU(3)C we cant use the Yukawas to rotate
away  and instead we pick up another contribution F =  arg det(Y uY d) (where
these are defined as in Section 2.4.4), so we end up with a total coefficient  = F .
Since the QCD vacuum has a non-trivial structure thanks to 3(SU(N)) = Z for
N  2 this term will have physical effects, although they are difficult to calculate
directly in QCD. The so-called Strong CP problem is then why the Yukawa-induced
term seems to almost exactly cancel the bare :  < 1010. This limit can be set
by calculating the contribution  would make to the electric dipole moment of the
neutron using chiral perturbation theory [52], which effectively amounts to using a
CCWZ expansion to describe the dynamics of the low-energy QCD bound states
after chiral symmetry breaking.
2.5 Parton distribution functions
When calculating the cross section for a process in proton-proton collisions we have
to take the composite nature of the protons into account. Since the composition
of the proton is determined by non-perturbative physics it is difficult to calculate
analytically, so we parameterise it in terms of so-called parton distribution functions
(PDFs) fi(x) which represent the probability number densities to find a parton i
carrying a momentum fraction x of the proton. These can be fit to experimental
results for well-understood processes, and then used for making predictions for other
processes. Alternatively PDFs can also be calculated using lattice QCD from first
principles [53]. The use of fitted functions to capture low energy non-perturbative
physics implicitly assumes that QCD factorises [54]: this is the statement that
 = fi  H + O(QCD/Q), where H is the process-dependent hard function and
Q the hard energy scale Q  QCD. In order to remove infrared divergences from
summing over collinear radiation from the initial state at fixed x we absorb these
into the (now renormalised) PDFs. This introduces an unphysical factorisation scale
46 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .
F which defines the scale at which we probe the proton. Just as parameters in the
lagrangian run with the renormalisation scale, the renormalised fi(x, F ) run with
F . From a Wilsonian perspective the situation is however reversed: the cutoff scale
of the theory here is  QCD  Q and we define the bare, finite PDFs at this scale,
and incorporate the effect of integrating up over collinear radiation into the definition
of the renormalised PDFs. Factorisation can then be thought of as an inverse of the
expectation that calculations at the weak scale should be insensitive to the UV
completion of the Standard Model which lead us to only consider renormalisable
operators in the lagrangian: here we instead expect calculations at scales much
higher than QCD to be insensitive to the non-perturbative completion we know
exists, but is difficult to explicitly calculate with. The evolution is given by the
DGLAP equation [5557]:
fqi(x, F )
fg(x, F )
Pqiqj (x/) Pqig(x/)
Pgqj (x/) Pgg(x/)
fqj (, F )
fg(, F )
(2.98)
The splitting functions Pij(y) encode the probability that a parton of type j
emits a collinear parton of type i with a fraction y of the momentum of the parent,
and can be calculated from considering g  gg, g  qq, and q  qg. Just as with
the renormalisation scale , F should be chosen to be close to the hard scale Q
in order to avoid the reappearance of large logarithms of the type ns log
n(Q2/2F )
which this procedure resums. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental
observations in order to create the best PDF fit possible is a crucial ingredient
for calculating any cross section at the LHC. An example PDF fit is shown in
Figure 2.13. The unified PDF interface LHAPDF [58] will be used to access PDF
values throughout this thesis.
2.6 Jets
The infrared divergences associated with collinear radiation discussed in Section 2.5
show up in any process with coloured particles in the final state. The splitting func-
tions Pij(y) are universal and can be used to define a semi-classical approximation
for resumming such collinear radiation down to QCD called the parton shower.
Taking the radiation of a collinear gluon from a quark as an example, this will take
the general form:

where z is the energy fraction of the original quark carried by the daughter quark,
and t is a virtuality scale of the splitting such as the resulting mass m2, momentum
transverse to the direction of travel of the original quark k2T , or Q
2 where  is the
opening angle and Q2 a hard scale of the process. Since we cut off the radiation
at a scale tc  QCD where confinement kicks in and we no longer can perform
perturbative calculations with quarks and gluons this leads to an ultimate upper
bound on z which will in general depend on the choice of t, so we do not have to
worry about the z  1 pole in Pqq here. Using t = k2T , the minimum and maximum
values of z are:
Different parton shower implementations use different choices of t: the important thing is that
t 0 in the collinear limit. Choices which respect angular ordering (k2T and Q
2) turn out to also
model coherent radiation due to the non-zero colour charge of the gluon correctly so are favoured
in practice.

R(t) can be interpreted as the probability of finding a gluon at the scale t. We can

This is called a Sudakov factor and encodes the leading logarithmic resumma-
tion of a gluon radiating from a final state quark in QCD. For example, the rate
for e+e  qq with no additional resolvable radiation off the quarks is given by the
fixed order cross section times the Sudakov factor for no additional radiation from
Q2 down to the resolvable resolution of the detector (to make this statement precise
we require a mathematically consistent definition of a jet, which will be discussed
below). A diagrammatic representation is shown in Figure 2.14. Recursively radi-

legs of a parton level event (generated by unweighting a fixed order calculation)
until all resulting colored legs reach a scale  tc is referred to as parton showering,
since the final multiplicity of colored particles will be very large. After modelling
confinement (in practice done using phenomenological models tuned to data) this
effect means that colored partons in the final state of a fixed order calculation will
appear as collimated collections of colour-neutral hadrons in physical hadron level
events, with roughly the same total momentum as the original parton. These objects
are called jets. In order to define a jet we need to decide on a way to cluster these
particles together. Since we have just determined that the theoretical description of
jets relies on the resummation of collinear and soft radiation, we should use jet clus-
tering algorithms which are collinear and infrared-safe in order to be able to connect
experimental measurements of jets to theory calculations with final state coloured
partons unambiguously [60]. This can be done by using sequential recombination
algorithms, with the following central objects:
dij = min(k
t,i , k
R2ij
, diB = k
t,i (2.103)
where kt,i is the transverse momentum of pseudo-particle i, Rij is the distance
between pseudo-particles i and j in the y   plane, and R is an input parameter
called the jet radius. These algorithms proceed by recursively identifying the small-
est d, and:
 if min d = dij , combine i and j into a new object i.
 if min d = diB, remove i from the event and call it a jet.
Once there are no pseudo-particles left in the event it is completely clustered and
a physics analysis can proceed. The parameter p determines the general behaviour
of the algorithm and there are three common choices:
 p = 1 is the kt algorithm [61], which corresponds to recursively un-doing the
parton shower algorithm we just described.
 p = 0 is the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [62], which corresponds to recur-
sively un-doing an angular-ordered parton shower algorithm.
By pseudo we here mean that these also can refer to already clustered collections of particles.
50 Chapter 2. The Standard Model. . .
 p = 1 is the anti-kt algorithm [63], and does not correspond to any theoreti-
cally motivated model for jet formation. However it is infrared and collinear-
safe, and provides circular jets, which makes it very popular among the ex-
perimental collaborations.

3.1 Known unknowns at short length scales
The Standard Model as presented in the last chapter is well-established as the correct
theory of nature at the short length scales we have managed to probe it at. However
there are several experimental and theoretical observations which suggest it cant
be the final theory before Quantum Gravity kicks in at the Planck scale. The most
glaring one is the observation of neutrino oscillations [64] which suggests neutrinos
must have mass. This can be achieved by adding a right-handed neutrino field to the
theory, which allows a Dirac mass term to be generated through a Yukawa coupling
as for the other fermion fields. Since the right-handed neutrino would not carry any
52 Chapter 3. . . . and Beyond
Standard Model charges there would be nothing to stop us from writing a Majorana
mass term which would naively sit at the cutoff scale of the Standard Model:
L,mass = mLR 
RR . (3.1)
Diagonalising the mass matrix we find the eigenvalues to be given by M
m2 + M
 m2
,M . If m  v and M  Planck we find that the lighter mass
eigenstate has mlight  106 eV and is predominantly left-handed. This method of
generating very small neutrino masses from a large hierarchy is called the see-saw
mechanism [65]. In this sense the observation of very small neutrino masses can be
easily accommodated in the Standard Model, but the mechanism we use to to do
so intrinsically does not predict any further observables at low scales.
Another issue with the Standard Model is the strong CP problem which was
already introduced in Section 2.4.7 as the absence of an allowed total derivative
term which would generate physical effects through topologically non-trivial gauge
configurations. It was shown that the coefficient of this term is given by  =  
arg det(Y uY d) < 1010, and there must therefore be an almost perfect cancellation
between the two contributing parameters. However  is naively an O(1) parameter
of QCD, and arg det(Y uY d) is an O(1) parameter of the electroweak sector, so there
is no reason to believe they should cancel in this way. This is an example of fine-
tuning, where different parameters of a theory are forced to take very particular
values for no discernable reason. The strong CP problem is therefore another major
motivation for the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Solutions
to this problem usually introduce new light scalars called axions.
3.1.1 The Nature of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
A third issue is the so-called hierarchy problem, which is the question of why the
weak scale is  100 GeV when quantum corrections naively bring it to the cutoff
scale CO of the theory. Technically this shows up as large quantum corrections
to the physical mass term of the Higgs boson mhP : when calculating generic mass
corrections at the cutoff scale, these will naively add terms  CO to the bare
masses in the theory. This turns out not to be true for the mass terms miB of the
gauge bosons and fermions of the Standard Model since these are protected by the
See for example [66] for a modern discussion on the merits of the hierarchy problem as pre-
sented here.
3.1. Known unknowns at short length scales 53
custodial symmetries which the mass terms have broken. Since these symmetries
are exact when miB  0, quantum corrections must be  miB, explaining why we
dont necessarily expect miP  CO.
The Higgs boson, as a fundamental scalar, is not protected by any custodial
symmetry so we would therefore expect that the pole mass at the cutoff is given
by m2P = m
B + (m
B)  m2B + 2CO where (m2B) are real corrections to the
self-energy. This can be shown explicitly by calculating the self-energy contribution
from a heavy fermion with mass M  CO, the diagram on the left in Figure 3.1.
This loop calculation is similar to that done in Section 2.3 but with an explicit mass
term M for the particles in the loop, and we keep all the numerator terms to make
sure we do not miss any cancellations:
ih(p

((l  p)2 M2)(l2 M2)
20M2  4p2 + 2(6M2  p2)(1
+ log
) + f(p2,M2)
. (3.2)
Here f(p2,M2) is a function with a branch cut that starts at p2 = 4M2 and
extends to p2 = . We will assume we are calculating at the cutoff of the theory
and assume it is the Planck scale, so p2 = 2 = M2 = (1018 GeV)2, and similarly
assume y = 1 as a reasonable value for the coupling. Since we are at the cutoff we
ignore the  term. This gives:
Planck) 
 1036 GeV2 . (3.3)
To have a pole mass at mP = 125 GeV if the cutoff is at the Planck scale would
therefore require that m2B = ( 5162 + 10
32)2Planck at one loop, if this diagram
is the only contribution (diagrams with particles with masses  v will of course
also contribute but only with terms  v2, and do not change the overall argument).
This fine-tuning of the bare parameter value to an order of 1032 is the hierarchy
problem, and shows up whenever we take the cutoff of the Standard Model to be

Figure 3.1: Representative diagrams contributing to the Higgs boson self-energy.
Solutions to the hierarchy problem typically modify the Higgs sector of the Stan-
dard Model in order to for example introduce additional symmetries which ensure
cancellations in the self-energy calculation. In other words, the hierarchy problem
is deeply related to the question of what the underlying nature of electroweak sym-
metry breaking is in the Standard Model. Most extensions to the Standard Model
designed to solve the hierarchy problem predict that the higher order terms in the
Higgs potential such as 3 discussed in Section 2.4.2.2 are modified from the Stan-
dard Model expectation, 3 6= 3SM. This is for example a generic feature of Two
Higgs Doublet Models [67] and hence models of supersymmetry, and models where
the Higgs is a bound state of a new strongly interacting sector rather than an ele-
mentary particle [68]. Therefore measuring the coefficients of the higher order terms
is not just a precision test of the Standard Model itself: it also provides considerable
insight into the specific mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking nature has
employed and hence potentially allows physics beyond the Standard Model to be
indirectly discovered, even if the LHC does not find any new resonant states within
its energy range. The study of hhjj production in Chapter 6 is in this sense a study
of Beyond the Standard Model physics, even if the main topic is a measurement of
the Higgs trilinear coupling.
Another avenue to study the hierarchy problem if no new resonant states are
produced is to measure the Standard Model parameters that go into the Higgs
self-energy calculation. In dimensional regularisation there is strictly speaking no
hierarchy problem in the Standard Model itself: it only shows up when we explicitly
introduce new, heavy states into our theory as above. In order to remain model-
independent in our treatment it could therefore be argued we should first calculate
and measure the dominant Standard Model contributions before worrying about
hypothetical new physics: the leading one is given by the top Yukawa coupling
3.2. Known unknowns at long length scales 55
yt through a similar diagram as that calculated above with y = yt  0.93 and
M = mt  163 GeV in MS, which gives a difference between the pole and MS
masses
of order  1% if mP = 125 GeV using the result in Equation 3.2.
The absolute size of this correction is insensitive to the pole mass of the Higgs boson,
however: ifmP = 80 GeV the correction would be of the order 15%, and formP  40
GeV over 100%. The underlying cause is the large top mass and hence large size of
the top Yukawa coupling, yt  1. This suggests the top quark could play a special
role in electroweak symmetry breaking, and motivates the study of the top quark
sector as a proxy for its dynamics. In Chapter 7 we will present a study of the use of
top polarisation measurements for constraining a Randall-Sundrum model [22, 23]
designed to solve the hierarchy problem and explain the Yukawa structure of the
Standard Model, and show how such measurements allow the top sector to provide
additional sensitivity to the underlying dynamics.
The first subleading contribution to the Higgs self-energy comes from quartic
hhV V couplings in diagrams of the type on the right in Figure 3.1. Much like
the Higgs trilinear and quartic self-couplings these are predicted by the Standard
Model through our assumptions about the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking mech-
anism employed by nature, but can be generically modified in extensions which
expand or change the Higgs sector. These quartic hhV V couplings are difficult
to directly measure at the LHC. However they do contribute to the vector boson
fusion component of hhjj production: in Chapter 6 we will therefore also show how
a measurement of hhjj production can be used to constrain their values.
3.2 Known unknowns at long length scales
There is another group of known unknowns which tell us there must be some beyond
the Standard Model physics. Unlike the ones discussed so far they are all related to
astronomical and cosmological observations, and we connect them to short length
scale particle physics by considering the evolution of the universe as it cools down
after the big bang.
One such unexplained phenomenon is the baryon anti-baryon asymmetry of the
universe. While the complex phase of the CKM matrix and the  angle are sources
of CP violation, they are not sufficient to explain the observed baryon dominance
as outlined by the Sakharov conditions [69]. These state that in order to generate
a baryon anti-baryon asymmetry, the following must be true in the early universe:
56 Chapter 3. . . . and Beyond
 Baryon number is violated.
 C and CP is violated.
 There are interactions out of thermal equilibrium.
Baryon number is violated in the Standard Model by non-perturbative effects,
but again not to a great enough extent to generate the observed asymmetry. Intro-
ducing sufficient sources for baryon number and CP violation, and a strong enough
phase transition to keep the universe sufficiently out of equilibrium as it cools, are
major motivations for introducing BSM physics. One avenue to introduce additional
CP violation and a stronger phase transition into the Standard Model is modifica-
tions to the Higgs sector. CP violating effects in the Higgs sector, parameterised in
terms of effective operators, will be studied in Chapter 6.
As alluded to above, the Standard Model does not include a quantum description
of gravity. It is possible to construct a general effective quantum theory of a massless
spin-2 boson which turns out to be equivalent to General Relativity at low energies
[70] when the cutoff is given by the Planck scale. This suggests that whatever the
quantum gravity UV completion is, it is expected to behave like General Relativity
all the way up to the Planck scale. The experimental discovery of an accelerated rate
of expansion of the universe [71] suggests a non-zero cosmological constant . This
constant  faces a similar hierarchy problems as the Higgs mass in that quantum
corrections would be expected to bring it to the cutoff of the theory   (CO)4
but it is measured to be  . (mEV)4. Searches for some types of solutions to this
cosmological constant problem can be performed at the LHC [72,73].
A final known unknown is the apparent presence of large quantities of non-
interacting matter throughout the universe that can be inferred from a range of
astronomical and cosmological observations over a large range of length and energy
scales. This matter is called dark matter and since searches for particle physics
descriptions of it will be the topic of Chapters 4 and 5 we will discuss it in more
detail in the next section.
3.2.1 Dark Matter
The existence of dark matter is heavily implied by a number of observations. In
chronological order these include for example Zwickys observations of the radial
velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster [74], Babcocks observation of

the rotational velocity curve of the Andromeda galaxy [75], and Ostrikers and Pee-
bles numerical observation that the presence of a massive non-interacting spherical
component (halo) is required to stabilise the kinematics of galaxy disks [76]. More
recently the combination of X-ray spectroscopy of the visible matter and gravitional
lensing analysis of the total matter content of the Bullet cluster, created from the
collision of two other clusters, strongly indicates the presence of large amounts of
invisible, non-interacting matter distributed in halos around the two original clus-
ters. This has ruled out alternative explanations which modify gravitional inter-
actions rather than the matter content [77]. The current cosmological Standard
Model CDM also requires a large dark matter component to overcome the ther-
mal and radiation pressure of baryonic matter in the early universe in order to allow
galaxy and star formation which matches observations [78] and to explain observed
anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background [79].
Focusing on the rotational velocity of spiral galaxies we can calculate the ex-
pected result in Newtonian gravity with and without a dark matter halo. When
there is no dark matter present the gravitional potential  is dominated by a disk-
shaped core with a radius a and height b that we will assume has constant density.
A sketch of the setup is given in Figure 3.2. In cylindrical coordinates the potential
can then be approximated by a Miyamoto-Nagai form [80]:
disk(r, z) = 
GNMdisk(
r2 + (a+
b2 + z2)2
)1/2 . (3.4)
In a gravitional potential the rotational velocity of an orbiting object is found by
balancing the transverse acceleration against the potential, so vrot =
r ddr which
gives:
58 Chapter 3. . . . and Beyond
vrot, no DM(r) =
 GNMdiskr2(
r2 + (a+
b2 + z2)2
)3/2 . (3.5)
Adding a sphere of radius R with uniform density and a total mass MDM which
envelops the disk (a dark matter halo) modifies the potential as follows:
disk+sphere(r, z) = 
GNMdisk(
r2 + (a+
b2 + z2)2
)1/2  GNMDM(3R2  r2)2R3 . (3.6)
This gives the following rotational velocity:
vrot, sphere(r) =
 GNMdiskr2(
r2 + (a+
b2 + z2)2
)3/2 + GNMDMr2R3 . (3.7)
For more a more realistic description of the dark matter distribution we can use
the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) [81] density:
(r) =
1 + r
)2 . (3.8)
Following through the same calculation gives the following rotational velocity:
vrot, NFW(r) =
GNMdiskr
r2 + (a2 +
b2 + z2
+4GN0
R3s log(1 + r/Rs)

)]1/2
. (3.9)
The results along the z = 0 axis, with typical and comparable values used for
the free parameters, are shown in Figure 3.3. The rotation curve of the Milky
Way is presented in Figure 3.4 for comparison, and shows clearly that the observed
values are incompatible with only the visible disk contributing to the gravitational
potential, whereas a dark matter halo with a NFW density profile fits the data well.
In order to define the total mass in the NFW case we need to cut off the integral, which is
done at 5Rs which corresponds to a typical value for a spiral galaxy.

3.2.1.1 Calculating the Relic Density
Building a short length quantum field theory description of dark matter requires
us to consider how such a model would generate the astronomical signals outlined
at the start of the last section. The first thing to make sure is that it can explain
the total dark matter abundance at the current time, dh2  0.12 [83]. Here
where c is the critical density which exactly defines a flat universe, and
h = H0
100 km s1 Mpc1
 0.7 is the dimensionless Hubble constant, where the Hubble
constant itself is defined as H0 = rr .
In the CDM paradigm this is assumed to be a thermal relic of a stable particle
 which was frozen out as the universe cooled down: in the early universe the dark
matter is in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model particles f :
 ff . (3.10)
As the temperature falls below the mass of  it stops being produced and its
yield Y = n/s (where n is the number density of  and s is the total entropy of

Figure 3.4: Rotation curve of the Milky Way. Taken from [82]. We have ignored
the dense core or bulge in our calculations, but for R > 3 kpc it is clear that a dark
matter halo is required to explain the observed values for the rotational velocity.
Note that the iso model here does not correspond to our uniform model.
the universe) starts falling exponentially as a result of one-sided 2 2 annihilation
processes into Standard Model states:
 ff . (3.11)
However at some point n becomes low enough that the annihilation effectively
stops since the absolute density is too low for 2 2 annihilation processes to occur.
After this freeze-out Y is almost constant and taking t corresponds to the relic
density today. This kind of out-of-equilibrium behaviour is statistically described by
a Boltzmann equation which in terms of our definition of the yield Y and x = m/T
is given by:
=  1
s(m)
H(m)
v(Y 2  Y 2eq) . (3.12)
Introduced as a shorthand to normalise for the expansion of the universe.
We will follow Flip Tanedos notes [84] in the treatment of the Boltzmann equation.
3.2. Known unknowns at long length scales 61
The relevant cosmological quantities are:
s(T ) =

H(T )2 =
GN(T ) (3.14)
R(T ) =
4 (3.15)
Yeq =g
em/T 
= 0.145
x3/2ex . (3.16)
Here we used the non-relativistic expression for the number density n when cal-
culating the equilibrium yield Yeq. We will assume that for the purposes of the
freeze-out calculation the universe is radiation-dominated so   R. g is the inter-
nal number of degrees of freedom for the dark matter particle. gs and g are the
effective relativistic degrees of freedom for the entropy and energy density respec-
tively, and are defined as:
bosons
fermions
, (3.17)
where n = 3 for gs and n = 4 for g. Here T is the temperature of the background
plasma which is assumed to be in equilibrium. For T > 1 MeV gs = g holds to a
good approximation [85] so they are interchangeable for the temperatures we con-
sider, but we will keep them separate for clarity. They are approximately constant
with g(s)  100 above the electroweak scale, below which they start falling.
We can expand the thermally averaged cross section in powers of the velocity:
v = v0vp +O(vp+2) . (3.18)
We will assume s-wave annihilation dominates, so p = 0. Equation 3.12 is
difficult to solve numerically since there are many relevant scales that contribute
in the freeze-out region: Y 2  Y 2eq  Y 2  Y 2eq  v0. We therefore multiply
through both sides of Equation 3.12 by s(m)

v0 to get:
=  1
y2  y2eq
, yeq = 0.145
s(m)

This equation should be easier to numerically solve since the relevant scales are
now reduced to y2  y2eq  y2y2eq. We will choose representative parameter values
This is when neutrinos decouple and we no longer have T = T .

which ensure freeze-out occurs at T  v and approximate g(s) = 100, and take
g = 2 which corresponds to Majorana fermion dark matter. Expanding everything
out and plugging in values:
yeq = 0.192
v0x3/2ex = 0.0384
v0x3/2ex . (3.20)
As a boundary condition we use that y = yeq at small x, for example at x = 1
(going to smaller x would not be justified since we used the non-relativistic expres-
sion for the number density of ). The remaining free parameters are m which
is set to 1 TeV, and v0 which we set to 1010 GeV2 = 39 fb, corresponding
to typical weak scale values. With these we can numerically solve the Boltzmann
equation. The result is plotted in Figure 3.5.
To convert to the relic abundance we use:
d = mYs0 = m
s(m)
H(m)
v0
y . (3.21)
The solution could be improved by correctly taking the T dependence of g(s) into account,
but this ultimately has a small effect on the final result so we neglect it here.
3.2. Known unknowns at long length scales 63
Here Y is the yield at large x (or equivalently as t  ) and we have converted
this to a form where we can use our numerical answer y  21.3. This requires the
entropy of the universe today, s0 = 2890 cm3. Plugging in values again:
8GN s0 y
g v0
 8GN
. (3.25)
So our parameter choices overproduce dark matter by about an order of mag-
nitude since we want dh2 = 0.12. In order to get the correct relic abundance we
therefore have to increase the thermally averaged interaction cross section v0 and
recalculate y. In general y does not depend strongly on v0 so to a first order
we can approximate the required v0 by:
 v
v0
, (3.26)
which means we could reproduce the correct relic abundance if our model predicted
a  15 times higher annihilation cross section. Calculations of this type will be used
in Chapter 4 in order to estimate the sensitivity of the LHC to the full parameter
space of a realistic dark matter model.
Note that a thermal freeze-out is only one of many possible mechanisms pro-
posed for generating a dark matter relic density. It is the most popular one thanks
to the feature weve just demonstrated: it gives the correct abundance for roughly
weak-scale values for the mass of the dark matter particle m and the annihilation
cross section v0. This is referred to as the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
(WIMP) miracle and has motivated searches for heavy, stable, and neutral particles
at both direct detection experiments [86] and colliders [87]. In Chapter 4 we will
present a study of a Simplified Dark Matter model, which is a minimalistic extension
of the Standard Model incorporating a WIMP dark matter candidate. Other mech-
anisms include the freeze-in of very weakly interacting massive particles [88], and
independent freeze-out in an almost entirely secluded dark sector through 3  2
interactions, where very weak interactions with the Standard Model are used to
transfer the extra heat from these annihilations into the Standard Model sector [89].
In GeV these are given by:
GN =6.707 1039 GeV2 (3.22)
H0 =2.131 1042 GeV h (3.23)
s0 =2890 (1.98 1014 GeV)3 (3.24)
64 Chapter 3. . . . and Beyond
3.2.1.2 Other Large Scale Constraints
Another strong constraint on the nature of dark matter comes from observations
of the the current cosmic structure. In particular it is well-known that a strictly
top-down model of structure formation is disfavored by experiment, see Figure 3.6.
This rules out hot dark matter models where the dark matter is relativistic and
forms large structures first, before eventually forming smaller scale structure. Nu-
merical simulations show that this top-down structure formation creates a cutoff in
the density fluctuations at shorter correlation lengths which is not observed. Cold
and warm dark matter models, where none or only a fraction of the dark matter is
relativistic, instead produce bottom-up structure formation, where small scale struc-
tures are created first and later cluster into larger scale structures. This leads to a
smoother curve of density fluctuations and no cutoff at smaller correlation lengths,
in agreement with observations [90].
The relic abundance and bottom-up structure formation are only two of many
large scale observations that a quantum field theory description of dark matter
should address. However from a practical perspective they are often the most useful
ones, since many of the other observations come with considerable caveats attached:
CDM is for example known to have many apparent issues when comparing state-of-
the-art numerical simulations with modern experimental observations, including the
core vs cusp [92], too-big-to-fail [93], missing satellite [94] and Tully-Fisher Galaxy
Halo [9597] problems. Whether these are caused by the limited resolution of current
numerical simulations, a local statistical fluctuation in the region of the universe we
are able to observe, or are genuine physical effects is difficult to ascertain. However
as constraints on WIMPs of the type we discussed in the last section have become
stronger, these failures of CDM can be used to provide hints for new directions
to explore. In particular all of the afore-mentioned issues could be ameliorated
by self-interactions among the dark matter particles [98]. In self-interacting DM
scenarios an energy transfer from the outer hotter region of the halo to the central
colder region can produce a core structure in agreement with current observations.
In addition, the number of Milky Way satellite galaxies is significantly reduced. A
search strategy for specific signatures of such self-interacting dark matter at the
LHC and future hadron colliders is investigated in Chapter 5.

as measured by different experiments [91]. The right side of the plot corresponds
to long-length, pre-galaxy formation fluctuations, whereas left side corresponds to
increasingly short-length fluctuations. The blue line is a CDM fit which strongly
favours cold or warm dark matter with bottom-up structure formation, as hot dark
matter would result in a cutoff in the short-length correlations due to the top-down
structure formation it predicts.
3.3 Statistics in searches for Beyond Standard Model
physics
Since we will be interested in making statements about the (non-)existence of physics
beyond the Standard Model, we have to define a way to quantify agreement or
disagreement with a model hypothesis. We will in general employ the Modified
Frequentist confidence level CLs as outlined in [99], using a Poissonian likelihood
ratio as our test statistic. Using binned events:
bins
Poisson(di|si + bi)
Poisson(di|bi)
bins
esi
(3.27)
66 Chapter 3. . . . and Beyond
where si, bi and di are the expected number of signal and background, and observed
number of events for each bin respectively. Using the likelihood ratio we can compute
the observed value of the test statistic Xobs by using the actual observed number
of events for di (when calculating projections we can use di = bi instead), and then
calculate the probabilities of observing a smaller test statistic X for the background
and background+signal models by Monte Carlo sampling the predicted distributions
of di:
CLs+b =Ps+b (X < Xobs) , (3.28)
CLb =Pb (X < Xobs) , (3.29)
CLs =CLs+b/CLb . (3.30)
A value of CLs < 0.05 is interpreted as excluding the corresponding value of
 at 95% confidence level [100]. This setup is similar to those used by the LHC
experiments: the biggest differences will be introduced when considering systematic
uncertainties in distributions with more than one bin. Without detailed under-
standing of the experiments it is impossible to determine the correct correlation
matrix.
For discussions later in Chapter 7 it is useful to clarify the relation between this
simple statistical setup, the Fisher information of the full available phase space, and
machine learning algorithms often in use by the experiments. We will denote the
true parameter values of our model g, and measurements of these parameters g.
Assuming our measurements are not perfect, g will follow a probability distribution
f(g|g). If our measurements are unbiased, the expectation value of a parameter
value gi is equal to its true value:
gi  E[gi|g] = gi . (3.31)
The precision with which we can relate our measurements to the true parameters
is encoded in the covariance matrix:
Cij(g)  E[(gi  gi)(gj  gj)|g] . (3.32)
In our case we will extract the f(g|g) relation between true parameter values and
measured values using Monte Carlo simulations of both the theory model and the
This section is partly based on [101] where we borrow our notation from.
3.3. Statistics in searches for Beyond Standard Model physics 67
detector response. If we can calculate it exactly, we can define the Fisher information
matrix:
Iij(g)  E
2 log f(g|g)
gigj
g
. (3.33)
The Cramr-Rao [102] bound states that the values of the covariance matrix in
Equation 3.32 are bounded from below by the inverse Fisher information:
Cij  (I1)ij . (3.34)
That is, if we can calculate the Fisher information, we are guaranteed to be
able to access all of the available information in the measurements made. The
Fisher information is invariant under reparameterisations of g [101], so since the
LHC experiments typically make measurements of physical observables x and bin
these in phase space points xi, we rewrite f(g|g):
f(g|g) f(x|g) = Poisson(|(g))
f (1)(xi|g) . (3.35)
Here we have factorised out the total normalisation (g) and the total ob-
served event rate  from the single event normalised phase space probability density
f (1)(xi|g). (g) is of course given by the total event rate from a Monte Carlo simula-
tion, and f (1)(xi|g) contains all of the shape information from the same simulation.
To a good approximation the Fisher information contained in a distribution can be
approximated with Poissonian likelihoods like we do in this thesis: it is only terms
in f (1)(xi|g) which are nonlinear in g which break the equivalence. To be explicit,
for a bin r with an expected number of events r(g) and an observed number r,
the Poisson likelihood is:
Lr(g) = Poisson(r|r(g)) = r(g)rer(g) . (3.36)
The total likelihood for several bins is then given by:
Ltot(g) =
Lr = Lnorm(g)Lshape(g),
Lnorm(g) = (g)
e(g), Lshape(g) =
r(g)
(3.37)

where  is the total number of observed events. This shows that a Poissonian
likelihood factorises in the same way into a term which contains information about
the total normalisation and is identical to the term which we derived from the
general phase-space probability distribution, and another term which contains all
shape-related information [103].
If we only measure the total cross section in our experiment, the shape informa-
tion is trivial and the Fisher information is effectively given by differentiating the
cross section with respect to the theory parameters. In general, the act of binning
the continuous underlying distribution will always reduce or at best keep the Fisher
information constant. Similarly, the act of selecting only specific phase space regions
(applying cuts) will always reduce the amount of information in the distributions.
This is demonstrated in Figure 3.7.
Having established the statistical framework in which we consider LHC analyses,
we might wonder why the experiments (and phenomenologists, as will become clear
in this thesis) apply selections on their data before performing limit setting, if they
are guaranteed to lose information when doing so. Triggers are, of course, easy to
understand: it is simply impossible to store all collision data, so the phase space
needs to be cut down for practical purposes. However beyond this the situation is
more subtle. One, it would still be computationally prohibitive to calculate f(x|g)
3.3. Statistics in searches for Beyond Standard Model physics 69
from first principles with only trigger-level data in most cases. Two, when using such
an inclusive phase space we have to rely on theoretical extrapolations to describe for
example the parts of phase space which are described by non-perturbative physics,
and experimental extrapolations to describe the detector response for far corners
of observables. It is arguably the second point which makes an inclusive approach
impossible: limits calculated in such a way would not be reliable unless we could be
certain the models used to generate the physics and detector response distributions
were completely valid (or at least provided reliable errors) for the entire, incredibly
high-dimensional phase space.
However the first point is also important. Techniques for extracting information
from very high-dimensional distributions in a computationally efficient manner have
been developed over the recent decades, with neural networks and boosted decision
trees having seen widespread use also by particle physics experiments. Since these
techniques operate on the continuous phase space they can in theory retain the
full Fisher information of the considered observables. The well-known Universal
Approximation Theorem for neural networks [104, 105] states that a single-hidden-
layer network can represent a general degree d polynomial in a compact Rn space
as long as it has O(nd) hidden neurons. This means that an infinite-sized network
with an infinite amount of training data (under otherwise reasonable assumptions
about activation functions) will always be able to represent the optimal mapping
of f (1)(x|g)  f (1)(o|g), where o is a (potentially one-dimensional) output which
encodes all of the shape information in the full, high-dimensional x distribution.
There are of course many practical problems which make this very difficult to achieve
in practice, such as local minima in the weight distribution which can trap the
training in a suboptimal position, overfitting on limited data sets, and questions
of if (and if so, how) a network is ever guaranteed to be able to find this optimal
configuration. It has recently been proven [106] that a one-hidden-layer network
with complex weights using standard gradient descent training will always be able
to find the optimal configuration, and that there are no robust local minima in this
setup. Such results are mainly of theoretical interest and have little relevance to
the practical application of neural networks and similar algorithms. However, even
without a complete understanding of the underlying mechanics of neural networks
their real-world performance has shown them to be very useful for the types of
problems discussed in this section. In practice these methods are already used by

the experiments to access much more of the full shape information f (1)(x|g) than
they could using simple cut-and-count experiments.
These techniques still run into the same issues as mentioned above if considering
observables which we are not confident are well-described by our theoretical and
experimental models, but do at least provide a computationally feasible way to make
use of shape information from a reasonable number of well-modelled observables.
3.4 Beyond the Standard Model physics at the LHC
Having thus introduced the Standard Model and some of its problems, the remainder
of this thesis will be devoted to specific studies into the phenomenology of extensions
which could solve some of these shortcomings. The following two chapters will be
concerned with searches for a microscopic model of dark matter at the LHC:
 In Chapter 4 we will study the phenomenology of a so-called Simplified Model
of dark matter, which can be viewed as a minimalistic extension of the Stan-
dard Model introduced only to explain dark matter.
 In Chapter 5 we will calculate the RGEs for a mostly secluded dark sector
extension, and investigate if quantum corrections can be used to study the
internal structure of such a dark sector at a hadron collider.
Having considered ways to introduce dark matter extensions to the Standard
Model, we will return to the hierarchy problem and the nature of electroweak sym-
metry breaking more generally in Chapters 6 and 7:
 In Chapter 6 we will study the phenomenology of di-Higgs + 2 jet production,
and show that a future measurement can be used to constrain the trilinear
Higgs self-coupling, quartic V V hh interactions, and CP violating effects in
the Higgs sector.
 In Chapter 7 we will show how a measurement of the top polarisation in
resonant top pair production can be used to improve sensitivity to generic new
physics in the top sector, using a Randall-Sundrum model as a benchmark.

4.2 Summary
Run II of the LHC has seen the experiments move towards the adoption of so-
called Simplified Dark Matter models in order to set stronger and more robust
72 Chapter 4. Simplified Dark Matter Model Phenomenology
constraints on the dark sector [107,108]. In these models we introduce both a stable
dark matter particle  and a mediating particle, which together can be used to
generate the observed relic abundance in the thermal freeze-out paradigm. However
the generality of these models necessarily introduces a large number of a priori
free parameters that need to be considered and makes general scans difficult to
perform. In this chapter we will make use of the monojet + missing energy channel
to constrain a representative simplified model with the dark matter coupling to an
axial-vector Z  over the full parameter space, and investigate the validity of a narrow
width approximation to greatly reduce the computational demands of doing so. We
validate our analysis and the approximation using an early ATLAS 8 TeV dataset,
provide limits using the full ATLAS 8 TeV dataset, and provide predictions for
limits that can be set with 20 fb1 of 14 TeV data. Our technique provides a broad
benchmark for comparing constraints on simplified models, which we demonstrate
by comparing to actual limits on our model from the recently published ATLAS 13
TeV monojet search, which agree very well with our 14 TeV predictions and suggest
a move towards constraining the full parameter space is computationally feasible
using a narrow width approximation.
4.3 Motivating Simplified Dark Matter Models
Run I of the LHC saw EFTs become a popular framework with which to constrain the
dark sector [109]. In the simplest cases, the dark couplings and mediator masses can
be combined into a single effective energy scale, , leaving this and the dark matter
mass, m, as the only free parameters for each effective operator. EFT constraints
have the advantage of being relatively model-independent, allowing constraints to
be placed across a broad range of models and parameters. In addition they facilitate
an easy comparison with direct detection experiments via the shared energy scale .
However it is clear that EFTs must be used with extreme care at LHC energies, where
the typical momentum transfer is large enough that the momentum expansion used
in the construction of the EFT can not be assumed to be valid. At these energies
and luminosities the energy carried by the mediator can be larger than the mediator
mass, violating the expansion, except in the case of large mediator masses or for dark
sector couplings approaching the perturbativity limit [110]. Depending on the mass
and width of the mediator, this can lead to EFT constraints that are either stronger
or weaker than the constraints would be on a more complete model, reducing their

utility and making their validity questionable.
One solution is to rescale EFT constraints by truncating the simulated signal
such that only events for which the EFT approximation are valid are used to derive
constraints [111113]. This weakens constraints but at the same time makes them
substantially more robust, which is critical when considering bounds on Beyond
Standard Model parameters. Whilst this technique has the advantage of maintaining
some of the elegance of EFTs, it also has the serious disadvantage that it does not
make full use of all potential signal events available in a more complete model and
so does not address the region of parameter space where EFT constraints are too
weak. To constrain this region we need to consider models where the mediator can
be resolved. On the other hand, the parameter space of full, well-motivated models
such as supersymmetry [114] or extra dimensions [115] is broad, and by focusing
solely on such models we run the risk of missing more generic signatures of the dark
sector.
Hence, the usage of simplified models where the model is expanded to include an
explicit mediator has become the accepted practice [107, 108, 116119]. Simplified
models have the advantage of a relatively small set of free parameters, and do
not encounter the same validity problems as EFTs. However the parameter space
is still larger than for EFTs, which often necessitates arbitrary choices for one or
more parameters in order to constrain the remaining free parameters. Here we will
instead leave the dark matter mass, mediator mass, and coupling strengths all as
free parameters which we scan over and constrain in contours. We will use publicly
available ATLAS constraints on the monojet + missing energy channel to constrain
a simplified model with dark matter coupling to the standard model via exchange of
an axial-vector Z  mediator, and show that the use of a narrow width approximation
makes a scan of the full parameter space feasible.
In Section 4.4, we outline the choice of simplified model that we will be constrain-
ing, and discuss modelling issues surrounding the width of the vector mediator. In
Section 4.5, we describe our technique for converting the model-independent con-
straints on the visible monojet cross section into constraints on this simplified model.
In Section 4.7 we validate the constraints we get from our analysis against published
ATLAS results for an EFT model and in Section 4.8 we validate the cross section
reweighting with a narrow width approximation. In 4.9 and 4.10 we present our
results. Our 14 TeV predictions are compared to recently published ATLAS 13 TeV
results in Section 4.11. We conclude in Section 4.12.
74 Chapter 4. Simplified Dark Matter Model Phenomenology
4.4 Model
We consider a widely-used benchmark simplified model where Dirac DM interacts
with the SM via a Z -type mediator. This is described by the following Lagrangian
interaction term:
L = 
Z [q
(gVq  gAq 5)q] Z  [(gV  gA 5)], (4.1)
where gVi , g
i are respectively the vector and axial-vector coupling strengths between
the mediator and quarks (i = q) and DM (i = ). The LHC is relatively insensitive
to the mixture of Vector/Axial-vector couplings [113], however this ratio has a large
effect on the sensitivity of direct detection experiments to this model. A vector
coupling induces a spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon scattering rate, while an
axial-vector coupling induces a spin-dependent (SD) rate [120]. Current bounds
on SI interactions are much stronger than those on SD, to the point where direct
detection constraints are generally stronger than LHC constraints on models with
pure vector couplings, and vice-versa for pure axial-vector couplings, as seen in
e.g. [121]. For this reason we consider a pure axial-vector coupling, setting gV =
gVq = 0, and defining g  gA , gq  gAq . For simplicity, as is common, we assume
that the quark-mediator coupling gq is the same for each species of quark. In order
to keep the model perturbative we restrict couplings such that OS/M < 1 where
M is the Z  mass and OS is the on-shell width of the Z .
This choice of couplings to the quarks will in general not respect the gauge invariance of
the Standard Model quark Yukawa couplings. This can be fixed by setting some vector couplings
non-zero and will lead to larger cross sections, so our choice can be considered conservative. More
crucially, gauge invariance of the lepton Yukawa coupling also requires that the Z couples to
leptons, which introduces strong constraints from di-lepton searches [122]. This can be fixed by
enlarging the Standard Model Higgs sector with for a example a second Higgs doublet, as in Two
Higgs Doublet Models [67]. Using purely vector couplings to quarks would avoid these issues
entirely while keeping the LHC phenomenology similar. Perturbative unitarity of the process
  ZLZL also requires the introduction of a new Higgs state which is not too much heavier
than the Z [122] which we assume we can ignore in our analysis. In this sense the model should
not be viewed as UV-complete but rather as a well-defined limit of a number of possible UV-
completions, as customary in the Simplified Model paradigm.
4.4. Model 75
For the model we consider, OS is at tree level given by:
(k2) =
g2M(1 4m2/k2)3/2
(k2  4m2)
g2qM(1 4m2q/k2)3/2
(k2  4m2q) . (4.2)
The on-shell width OS is then given by OS = (M2). With the assumption that
gq is equal for each flavor of quark this width can become very large, for example
rising above OS  M at gq = g  1.45 when gq = g. This width assumes
no additional decay channels aside from quarks and DM, however it is conceivable
that the mediator could decay to standard model leptons or additional dark sector
particles. Given that the the structure of a possible dark sector is unknown and that
couplings to leptons are more appropriately constrained by searches for dilepton
resonances [123, 124], we confine ourselves to the more minimal model where the
mediator couples only to quarks and DM.
In the event generation we will use a Breit-Wigner form for the Z  propagator
with constant on-shell widths as introduced in Equation 2.61:
Z(k
2,M,OS) 
k2 M2 + iMOS
. (4.3)
This approximation will begin to break down when we no longer can rely on OS 
M [125,126]: it amounts to a replacement of k2(k2)/M  OSM in the imaginary
part of the resummed self-energy, which clearly can only be motivated for small
widths for which the cross section is dominated by k2  M2. Additionally we
identify (k2) as its on-shell value OS; this is again only justified when OS/M 
1. A consistent treatment of our model in the part of parameter space where we
cant assume that OS/M  1 hence requires a more careful consideration of the
propagator than we employ in our simulation, and we therefore use cross section
reweighting for the parts of parameter space where we are not conservative to correct
for this. In Figure 4.1 we show a comparison of line shapes for various values of
OS/M with fixedM,m using the naive Breit-Wigner shape we employ and a fully
kinetic propagator, which reflects that our simulation will become increasingly poor
as OS/M increases.
We have estimated the ratio of final cross sections using a Breit-Wigner propa-
gator and a kinetic one by convolving them with PDFs and requiring that we can
produce a  pair on-shell and found that within this approximation the choice of
propagator makes for modest differences for most of our parameter space, with large

propagator with the replacement OSM  k2(k2)/M in the imaginary part of the
self-energy (red) for various values of OS/M . The normalisation is arbitrary and

parameter space point.
effects in specific regions: for m  M and OS/M & 0.5 our propagator gives a
cross section that can be as much as 50% too low compared to a kinetic propagator.
In the other extreme end where m & M and OS/M & 0.5 we see an opposite
effect where our cross section can be several times too large. Since our propagator
in this region is not conservative we will reweight the visible cross section we get
at the end of our simulation whenever BreitWigner > kinetic using the ratio of the
two (where these cross sections are estimated as described above) to allow our limits
to remain robust. In general we do not set strong limits in this region in the first
place, so the effect of this reweighting procedure is in the end limited.
4.5 Reinterpreting Monojet Constraints
Our signal prediction is obtained by implementing the model in the FeynRules

order (LO) parton level events using the NNPDF2.3 LO PDFs [129]. These are
matched to Pythia 8.185 [130] using the MLM algorithm with a matching scale
of 80 GeV for showering and hadronisation using tune 4C. We generate  + 0,
1, and 2 jets in the matrix element before matching to the parton shower. We
use the default MadEvent factorization and renormalisation scales (R,F ) which
in this case both are approximately the transverse mass of the  system. Our
approach only makes leading order + parton shower (LOPS) predictions compared
to the next-to-leading order + parton shower (NLOPS) predictions used in a similar
study of CMS results [131] in [108], which means we suffer from larger theoretical
uncertainty due to scale dependencies which we can attempt to estimate by varying
our choice of R,F by a factor of two. This shows a weak dependence on the choice
of scales of +10%5% for a few representative choices of M,m which is clearly not a
realistic estimate of the uncertainty: previous studies [132134] with other choices
of scales have found fixed-order NLO corrections ranging from  20  40%. We
do however note that based on the results in [134], we expect NLO corrections to
ultimately be modest after matching to a parton shower and applying the ATLAS
monojet analysis cuts since the parton shower dilutes differences, helped by the
loose cuts on additional jets. As such they should have a limited impact on our
quantitative results and be negligible for qualitative results.
We analyze the generated events using the ATOM framework [135, 136] based
on Rivet [137]. We first divide the final state into topological clusters and find jets
with the anti-kt algorithm [63] using R = 0.4 in FastJet [138]. We then perform
a smearing of the pT of these jets based on typical values for the ATLAS detector,
leaving the EmissT unsmeared
. Our procedure has been validated by recreating the
limits set on an EFT operator by ATLAS and the results of this validation is given
in Section 4.7.
Some past constraints on simplified models have used a fixed benchmark width.
In this case, the cross section is only sensitive to the product g  gq and not to the
couplings individually; Further, this easily factorises out,
d(g, gq) = (g  gq)2d(g = gq = 1), (4.4)
Chosen to correspond to the matching scale used in the original ATLAS EFT interpretation
which we use to validate our method.
We are not aware of any ATLAS EmissT smearing values which could be unambiguously applied
to our case, based on the results in [139] we expect the plateau to have been reached for all our
signal regions however.
78 Chapter 4. Simplified Dark Matter Model Phenomenology
which simplifies the analysis since the coupling affects only the magnitude of the
signal, not the spectral shape. Including the physical width complicates things,
since now both the magnitude and signal spectrum have a dependence on both
g  gq and gq/g. This results in necessary complications if one wants to present
2D contour limits on g  gq when the width is known. However it is possible to
make an approximation for the cross section in the resonant region using the narrow
width approximation as   g2qg2/OS (for fixed M,m) and   g2qg2 for the
off-shell region, which allows us to set limits on g  gq while avoiding a scan in this
dimension, leaving only M m as free parameters for any given choice of gq/g.
The approximation follows from integrating over the Breit-Wigner propagator and
making the substitution tan  = m
, max  /2, min  /2:
(m2 M2)2 + 2OSM2
2OSM
(m2M2)2
2OSM
d tan 
tan2  + 1
d sec2 
tan2  + 1
(4.5)
This approximation should work well for the part of parameter space where
OS  M [140, 141], and we present a full study of this approximation (including
the effect of the mediator shape reweighting) in Section 4.8 which further motivates
restricting the parameter space to OS/M < 0.5.
4.6 Including Relic Density Constraints
We also include relic density constraints by finding out which parts of our parameter
space would result in a larger relic abundance than observed experimentally. Rather
than using the approximations introduced in Section 3.2.1.1 we use the well-known
formalism described in, for example, Refs. [142, 143] to constrain v0 by simulta-
neously solving an expression for the freeze-out temperature as a function of v0,
and the relic abundance as a function of both v0 and the freeze-out temperature.
This technique ceases to be valid when the Breit-Wigner expression for the width
breaks down. We will allow for values up to OS/M = 1 when performing the relic
density scan, so some care needs to be taken when interpreting relic density con-
tours for large couplings. We use the annihilation rate to quarks for our model as
calculated in [144].

When presenting later results in Figures 4.5 and 4.7 we use the relic density
calculation to define a contour, within which the LHC constraint on the coupling is
stronger than the coupling which would give thermal relic DM. For regions inside
this line the coupling strength is constrained to be less than the coupling which
gives the correct relic density. Hence, the annihilation rate is smaller than required,
and the relic density will naively be too large. For DM to lie in this region, either
the thermal relic scenario must break down, or the DM annihilates via additional
channels not considered here.
4.7 Validation of Procedure using EFT Limits
We use the ATLAS monojet analysis for 10.5 fb1 of 8 TeV data [145] to validate our
procedure and approximations, so we apply the following cuts: We require at most
two jets with pT > 30 GeV and || < 4.5, with |j1| < 2 and (j2, EmissT ) > 0.5
where j1 and j2 are the leading and subleading jet respectively. We define four
signal regions based on pj1T and E
T as outlined in Table 4.1.
Our overall limit-setting procedure has been validated by recreating the ATLAS
limits set on  for the D8 EFT operator which corresponds to our simplified model
with the mediator integrated out. A comparison for SR3 is presented in Table 4.2.
We consistently overestimate the limit by a few percent which reflects the less ad-
vanced nature of our detector simulation, however the agreement is good enough
for our purposes as we have sub-2% differences for m values which are relevant for
us. Note that we only perform the comparison for SR3 as it usually is the most
discerning signal region and the only one for which ATLAS results are reported,
however we assume the results are similar for the other signal regions. Similarly we
assume this agreement carries over to our analyses of the full 8 TeV dataset and our
14 TeV predictions.

4.8 Validation of Cross Section Reweighting
Our limits set using results from [145] using interpolation in M m  g  gq are
presented in Figure 4.2, limits set using the narrow width cross section approxima-
tion are presented in Figure 4.3, and the ratios of the limits set in the two cases
are presented in Figure 4.4. To visualise the breakdown of our approximations we
extend the limit of our parameter space to OS/M < 1.
Values of gq/g > 1 are hardly probed at all by monojet searches as evident
from our results for gq/g = 2: such models are much better constrained by dijet
searches which motivates not including these in our main study.
4.9 20.3 fb1 8 TeV Limits
We make use of 90% C.L. limits set using the full ATLAS 8 TeV dataset [113] for
our definite 8 TeV study as the ATLAS analysis uses selection criteria which are
better suited towards events with several jets than the full 8 TeV dataset analysis
by CMS [146]. The analysis defines signal regions based on EmissT and initially
only requires the leading jet pj1T > 120 GeV with the additional requirement that
2pj1T > EmissT for the harder signal regions, and does not veto events due to additional
jets as long as (jet, EmissT ) > 1.0. The signal regions are given in Table 4.3.

notation.
4.9.1 Discussion of constraints
The results of our full 8 TeV scan are shown in Figure 4.5. We see that we can
exclude mediator masses up to  1.3 TeV for gq = g = 1 and  0.9 TeV for
gq = g = 0.5 at 90% C.L. Lower gq/g values are relatively well-constrained by
monojet searches as expected due to resonant enhancement of the cross section.
Additionally because gq is small, dijet constraints are relatively weak for this part
of parameter space as we will discuss below.
The area inside the black line in Figure 4.5 indicates the region where the con-
straint on
gqg is stronger than the coupling strength which gives the correct relic
abundance. Naively, M  m values inside the region outlined by the black line
would therefore lead to a larger relic abundance than observed. However, if the DM
is not produced thermally or if the DM has other annihilation channels not consid-

ered here (e.g. to leptons), this constraint is relaxed. Therefore this contour does not
strictly rule out any region, but rather indicates that the simplest implementation
of DM using this model is expected to lie outside this contour. Limitations aside,
this is a useful way to compare collider measurements to cosmological observations,
and can be elegantly implemented in a simplified model context as we show here.
This crucially relies on knowledge of the full parameter space: only considering a
single slice will only allow a line which gives the correct relic density to be drawn,
greatly reducing the overall information provided.
4.9.2 Limits from dijet resonance searches
Since our Z  couples to quarks one could attempt to make use of limits from dijet
resonance searches [147150] to further constrain the model as done in for example
4.9. 20.3 fb1 8 TeV Limits 83
Figure 4.4: Ratio of the results using interpolation inM m space and the narrow
width cross section approximation detailed in the text to using a full interpolation
in M m  g  gq space. The cross section approximation is conservative in the
bright yellow (light) areas, and overestimates the limit in the dark blue (dark) areas.
The black dots are interpolation knots inMm space. Note the ratio takes values
higher than 1.2 in some parts of parameter space but the colourbar is restricted
since the approximations are conservative there. See the text for further details.
Note gDM = g, mDM = m in our notation.
[151]. This certainly gives much stronger constraints when gq/g > 1 which is
why we ignore this part of parameter space (we show results for gq/g = 2 in
our validation study in Section 4.8). For lower ratios of couplings we need to be
careful since dijet resonance searches generally assume narrow resonances and in
this part of parameter space the dark sector branching starts contributing to the
width considerably. The dashed white line on the plots show where the width of the
mediator becomes narrow enough to potentially violate such constraints assuming no
additional dark sector decays (we take this to be OS/M . 0.05 to be conservative,
but note that there are recent searches [150] which have constrained much wider

naively ruled out by relic density contraints. For details see text. Note gDM = g,
mDM = m in our notation.
resonances). Comparing to the results from the detailed Z  dijet analysis in [152],
presented in Figure 4.6, and assuming the results wont change drastically when
using an axial-vector coupling compared to a vector one, we see (note the difference
of a factor of 6 in the definition of gq) that the values of gq for which OS/M . 0.05
for gq/g = 1/2, 1/5 in our model typically are smaller than the values currently
constrained by dijet searches, but gq/g = 1 might be better constrained by dijet
searches in the part of parameter space inside the dashed white line.
Realistically the dijet resonance constraints will apply for much wider resonances
than we allow here once you perform a proper analysis instead of relying on con-
straints set assuming narrow widths, as done in [151] at parton level which suggests
that monojet searches give the strongest constraints for light mediators but dijet
searches are more constraining for heavy mediators even for low values of gq/g.

Figure 4.6: Limits set on a generic Z  model coupling equally to all quarks in [152].
Note that gB = 6gq and MZB = M in our notation.
Due to the sensitive dependence on the width it is however worth stressing that
since the model we assume here has no additional dark sector or standard model
decays for the mediator, constraints set on dark matter mediators with dijet reso-
nance searches in this part of parameter space can not be considered conservative:
the width we use is the minimum width assuming equal coupling to each generation
of quarks, and small changes to the dark sector can make a large difference to this
width. This problem is not as pronounced when gq/g > 1 since the width then
is dominated by SM decays, which further motivates using dijet constraints over
monojet ones in this part of parameter space. We also note that since the width
can be large, interference effects with Z/ should be properly taken into account
when using dijet searches to constrain these models  we expect interference to play
a similar role as in Drell-Yan [153] and have checked that this appears to be the
case but a detailed analysis is outside the scope of this study.
It is also possible to make use of dijet angular distributions which are sensitive
to wider resonances than the dijet mass spectrum [154, 155] and therefore can be
considered more robust than dijet resonance contraints. As shown in the parton
level study in [151] these can also be competetive with resonance searches in some
parts of parameter space, but we wont consider them further here.

We make use of the public results in [112] as estimations for the expected back-
grounds and hence expected cross section limits at 14 TeV with 20 fb1 of data from
the ATLAS detector assuming a low average number of pile-up collisions ( = 60).
Our event generation and detector simulation is the same, but our analysis is changed
to mirror that in [112]: we use a constant leading jet pT cut of 300 GeV and the
signal regions have been redefined as detailed in Table 4.4. The estimated reach
with 20 fb1 of 14 TeV data for gq/g = 1/5, 1/2, 1 is presented in Figure 4.7. The
black line again indicates the correct relic density as discussed in Section 4.9.1.
4.11 Comparison to ATLAS 13 TeV results
A monojet analysis using 36.1 fb1 of 13 TeV ATLAS data have recently been made
public in [156]. The analysis strategy is similar enough that it is possible to compare
to our 14 TeV predictions, keeping in mind theres a small difference in center-of-
mass energy and a factor of two difference in the available luminosity. The ATLAS
result for a single parameter point in our signal model is presented in Figure 4.8
and shows very good agreement with the closest parameter point in our scan. This
further confirms that our strategy is very robust and could be employed in realistic
experimental limit-setting.
4.12 Conclusion
During the LHC Run II there has been a clear move towards supplementing EFT
analyses with simplified models, as a stronger and more robust way to constrain the
dark sector. These same arguments apply to Run I data, and thus it is useful to
reinterpret existing constraints on the dark sector in the simplified model framework.
We thank David Salek for providing us with the exact numbers for the background estimates
and expected limits.
4.12. Conclusion 87

the black line could naively be ruled out by relic density contraints. For details see
text. Note gDM = g, mDM = m in our notation.
This has the added benefit of allowing us to validate a narrow width approximation
for facilitating a wider parameter scan, and gives a clear benchmark for simplified
models to be compared to results at higher LHC energies and luminosities. We have
demonstrated this through constraints on a simple Z  model, with an axial-vector
coupling. The parameter space for our simplified model spans four dimensions,
making the parameter scan and visualisation of the subsequent constraints more
challenging than for EFTs. The common restriction to 2-D slices of parameter
space allows for easy comparison between several constraints, but does not tell us
how these different constraints interact as we move to different parts of the parameter
space. Here we instead scan over the full 4-D parameter space, presenting results as
contours, allowing us to retain the maximum information possible on constraints.
By making a well-motivated narrow width approximation we can perform such scans

in an accurate and computationally reasonable way.
This allows for a more complete understanding of the strengths of the monojet
channel for constraining dark sectors and facilitates comparison to contraints from
other experiments and astronomical observations, as shown here by comparing to
dijet and a simultaneous scan over relic density constraints. Whilst the scope of this
analysis is limited to a single simplified model, this technique shows good prospects
for the (re)interpretation of constraints across a broader model-space.
Having discussed the phenomenology of a Simplified Dark Matter model which
falls squarely in the WIMP paradigm of dark matter, we will spend the next chapter
investigating the collider phenomenology of an enlarged dark sector with a dark,
potentially confining, gauge group.

5.2 Summary
As outlined in Section 3.2.1.2, the CDM paradigm suffers from a number of issues
related to relatively small-scale structures, including the core vs cusp [92], too-big-to-
fail [93], missing satellite [94] and Tully-Fisher Galaxy Halo [9597] problems. These
could be ameliorated if there were self-interactions among the dark matter particles.
The self-interaction cross section required to fit observations without being excluded
by others is of the same order-of-magnitude as nuclear interactions, 0.1 cm2/g 
/m  10 cm2/g  barn/GeV [157160]. The observation of the Bullet Cluster
called cross sections of this magnitude into question, as they would cause drag
on the dark matter density distribution compared to the visible component of the
cluster which was not observed [161]. However recent work has shown that such
an analysis is sensitive to the details of both the model used for the dark matter
density distribution of the bullet halo and the observational method used to infer the
(non)-existence of any drag, and in fact a self-interaction cross section of 2 cm2/g
can be completely consistent with the data [162, 163]. Dark sectors with strong
interactions are therefore still a viable alternative to the CDM paradigm which
can solve many of its apparent shortcomings, and have seen considerable interest
in the particle dark matter community. Here we will assume the existence of a
minimally-coupled dark sector which runs to strong interactions in the infrared,
and address the question of whether the scaling behavior of this dark sector can
be observed in missing energy signatures at present and future hadron colliders.
We compare these findings to the concrete case of self-interacting dark matter and
demonstrate that the energy-dependence of high momentum transfer final states can
in principle be used to gain information about the UV structure of hidden sectors at
future hadron colliders, subject to large improvements in systematic uncertainties,
which could complement proof-of-principle lattice investigations. We also comment
on the case of dark abelian U(1) theories.
5.3 Enlarged Dark Sectors
In the last chapter we considered a Simplified Dark Matter model with a massive,
weakly interacting particle which freezes out through an interaction with the Stan-
dard Model quarks mediated by a heavy Z . While such WIMP models offer a
realistic mechanism for generating the relic density and lead to the correct bottom-
up structure formation, there are other ways to achieve this.
5.3. Enlarged Dark Sectors 91
A popular alternative to the WIMP paradigm of dark matter is to consider the
existence of a mostly secluded larger dark sector which contains multiple particles
that are not charged under the SM gauge interactions. The interactions of the dark
sector can be protected by global symmetries and some of the particles can have a
long lifetime, thus providing plausible dark matter candidates. Collider-relevant the-
ories do not completely decouple the dark sector, but introduce interactions with the
Standard Model fields through the exchange of a mediator of a yet unknown force.
One reason to expect these to exist is that they in many cases can help cool down
the dark sector and hence lead to the correct bottom-up structure formation [89].
From a quantum field theory perspective portal interactions are often motivated
since they are allowed under the symmetries imposed and hence should exist, mod-
ulo fine-tuning. At the renormalisable level such an interaction can be facilitated
by U(1) mixing [164166] or a so-called Higgs portal interaction [167169].
A Higgs portal-like interaction is of particular interest, since we can argue for
its existence on general grounds in a wide class of models: if we introduce a dark
sector with particles which acquire their masses through a Higgs mechanism, this
can either be achieved through a Yukawa coupling to the Standard Model Higgs H
(this option requires the massive particles to not be singlets under GSM , and care
needs to be taken to ensure interactions with the Standard Model are sufficiently
suppressed [170]) or through a Yukawa coupling to a new scalar with a vev, . A
new (real or complex) scalar  will in general allow a mixing term HH to be
written down. Either way the Higgs provides a window into the dark sector.
Due to the issues the with CDM paradigm outlined above, dark sectors with
strong self-interactions have recently become of interest. One avenue to introduce
self-interactions is to use the structure of the visible Standard Model sector as in-
spiration and consider the existence of a larger, potentially confining dark sector.
The existence of complex dark sectors is further motivated by the fact that there is
no a priori reason why dark matter interactions should exhibit the simple structure
usually considered in WIMP scenarios.
While the very existence of dark matter is a strong indication of the presence of
a secluded sector, dark sectors are also motivated beyond the realm of dark matter.
Portal-type interactions have been motivated in generic hidden valley scenarios [171,
172], dark energy model building [173, 174], as well as conformal SM extensions to
tackle the hierarchy problem [175178] with potential links to leptogenesis [179]
and inflation [180]. Dark sectors and their interaction with the SM spectrum can
92 Chapter 5. Strongly-interacting Dark Sectors at Hadron Colliders
therefore be considered as versatile tools to tackle apparent shortcomings of the SM,
typically leading to the production of new states in high-energy interactions.
Irrespective of their motivation, we are faced with the question of how much
we can learn about dark sectors by the very fact that their interaction with visi-
ble sectors is suppressed. How much can present and future high-energy colliders
contribute to a resolution of this question?
It is known that inclusive rates of Z and Higgs boson interactions, as well as new
resonances in multi-Higgs final states, can be indicative of mixing effects with dark
sectors [181183]. However, depending on the complexity of mediator interactions
and dark sectors, it proves very difficult to enable a comprehensive dark sector
spectroscopy [184, 185]. In this chapter we show that some information about
the strong dynamics of a hidden sector can be gained by studying the momentum
dependence of telltale EmissT events. Although we limit ourselves to H + jet final
states in the following, our arguments apply to any process that involves mediator
production at high-energy colliders.
The chapter is organised as follows: we first review typical mediator scenarios
and discuss the extent to which strong dynamics in the dark sector can leave mea-
sureable imprints on mediator production through renormalisation group effects at
colliders in Sec. 5.4, before we focus on a minimal scenario based on Higgs por-
tal interactions. In Section 5.5 we will provide sensitivity estimates of dark sector
spectroscopy at the 14 TeV LHC and a hypothetical future 100 TeV hadron collider
and comment on the expected performance of a future lepton collider. As we will
see, this will crucially depend on improved experimental systematics. In Section 5.6
we connect the general discussion of Sections 5.4 and 5.5 to the concrete case of
self-interacting dark matter and demonstrate that aspects of dark sectors can in
principle be revealed by studying high-energy collisions. In case a state will be
discovered that can be interpreted as a dark sector-mediator, such measurements
can complement the on-going effort to construct realistic composite dark matter
scenarios using lattice simulations. We summarise and conclude in Section 5.7.
5.4 Model
How can the dynamics of a strong sector influence the mediator phenomenology?
The answer to this question is directly related to the UV properties of a partic-
ular mediator model and, to this end, we therefore focus on UV-complete models
5.4. Model 93
with scalar and vector mediators. As is well known from studies of simplified dark
matter models [110, 118, 119, 186], collider experiments are typically better suited
to discover vector mediators with gauge-like interactions to quarks and the dark
sector than scalar mediators with Yukawa-like couplings. In the vectorial case, how-
ever, the coupling to both visible and hidden sectors has to be a gauge coupling
while the mass of the mediator is realised through spontaneous symmetry break-
ing (or a Stckelberg approach). The only possibility, therefore, is to understand
the mediator interactions as part of a (Higgsed) product-group gauge theory, e.g.
SMU(1)mediatorSU(N)dark. Resumming the logarithmic enhancements of medi-
ator production with a monojet signature can be estimated through a leading order
(LO)-improved renormalisation group calculation that replaces the fixed LO value
of g with running parameter as function of the probed energy scale. The behaviour
of the mediator coupling g in the vectorial case, however, is protected through Ward
identities which gives rise to a one loop renormalisation group equation (RGE)
, (5.1)
irrespective of the dynamics in either the visible or hidden sector, as evident from
the Standard Model one loop gauge beta functions presented in Section 2.4.6. More-
over, the mediator production cross section would only reflect the total contributing
number of degrees of freedom to the running of g but not their interaction prop-
erties (this is exactly the situation we encounter for the SM gauge couplings). On
the one hand, such effects are difficult to observe in the LHCs (and a future 100
TeV colliders) energy range unless the value of g was large enough to make the
validity of perturbation theory questionable and potentially introduce a low-scale
Landau pole. On the other hand the monojet cross section dominantly probes the
mediator sector only, which is not the question we would like to see addressed by
the measurement.
The LO RGE characteristics of gauge couplings are not present for scalar medi-
ators. This already becomes transparent from the SM RGEs, where the top Yukawa
interaction behaves as (Equation 2.94d):
 17g
 8g2s
. (5.2)
As a consequence the top Yukawa RGE probes the strong QCD dynamics through
the dependence on gs, which runs as in Equation 2.94c. Therefore the combined
solution of one loop RGEs indeed dials sensitivity from the QCD sector into the
94 Chapter 5. Strongly-interacting Dark Sectors at Hadron Colliders
behaviour of the Higgs-top interactions. This only happens at two loop order for
gauge couplings and is hence a higher order effect for vector mediators.
We will therefore limit ourselves to scalar mediators, which can potentially allow
us to observe an echo of the strong sector dynamics in the mediator cross sections.
Our focus is a scenario consisting of a real SM-singlet scalar  which obtains a vev
x (similar to the singlet-extended Standard Model [167, 187, 188]), generating mass
terms for three generations of SM-singlet fermion dark quarks  through Yukawa
interactions. These mass terms can be small since we assume most of the mass in
the dark sector results from confinement, however they need to be non-zero to keep
all the dark pions massive in order to avoid strong long-range self-interactions in
the SU(N) case. We will in general assume a SM-like hierarchy structure in the
generation masses in order to keep one of the Yukawa terms large. The full scalar
potential is given by:
V (H,) = 2HH 
2 + 1(H
H)2 +
2HH. (5.3)
The 3 induced mixing between  and H generically results in interactions between
the visible and dark sector mediated by the two scalar mass eigenstates h and h,
and we denote the mixing angle . In unitary gauge:
(v + h1)/
,  = (x+ h2) ,
cos   sin 
sin  cos 
, (5.4)
 is expressed in terms of the Lagrangian parameters by:
tan 2 =
2x2  1v2
. (5.5)
In principle we have five free parameters in the scalar sector, which we choose as
m(h),m(h), v, x, , but we identify h as the Higgs-like particle discovered at the
LHC which fixes m(h) ' 125 GeV and v ' 246 GeV.
5.4.1 The confining SU(N) case
Since we are interested in dark sectors with nontrivial gauge structure we introduce
a new SU(N) gauge group (under which the SM transforms as a singlet) and let the
dark quarks transform in the M representation. We consider the U(1) case below.
We impose a Z2 symmetry to forbid any additional terms for simplicity.
This notation supercedes the use of  for the QCD-induced component of the CP violating
angle involving SU(3)C field strengths.
5.4. Model 95
Figure 5.1: Example diagram contributing to the process. The dependence on the
dark gauge group enters through the running of  as explained in the text.
The dark sector Lagrangian then reads
Ldark = Y i,j 
ij + h.c. + iD XaXa, . (5.6)
The mixing of the scalars will modify the interaction strength of the mass eigenstates
with the two matter sectors: h couplings to the Standard Model are scaled by cos 
compared to the Standard Model expectation and dark sector couplings are scaled by
sin  compared to the , and vice versa for h. This means  production is allowed
through both h and h when kinematically possible . We assume Y is diagonal
which means we have four new free parameters (with the dark gauge group coupling
gd) but motivated by the structure of the Yukawa terms in the SM we assume the
third generation of dark quarks is considerably heavier than the two first ones and
set the other Yukawa terms to 0 for the purposes of calculating the RGEs, which
leaves us with Y 3,3 and gd as free parameters. Showering and hadronisation can then
occur as in QCD [171, 172] and decay to low-lying states can be achieved through
additional weak interactions which will not impact the qualitative scaling behavior
induced by the strong interactions in the dark sector (like in the SM sector). In
total the free parameters for our study are:
 , gd, ,m(h
), x . (5.7)

dark quarks in varying representations,
and 5.2(c) for the U(1) model with vary-
ing values for the dark coupling g fixed at
MZ . We fix gd = gS at MZ as the dark
gauge sector boundary condition.
To illustrate the effects of RGE running from different N and M we fix most of
these to generic values inspired by their SM equivalents (defined at the h pole):
x = 100 GeV, Y 3,3 = 0.7,  = 0.5, and m(h
) = 150 GeV. This parameter point is
in agreement with current constraints [189]. For our chosen benchmark of a mass of
70 GeV for the heavy dark quark, production through h is kinematically suppressed
and we will ignore it from now on. Also, since Br(h  )  1 current constraints
from additional Higgs searches in visible channels are easily evaded.
We fix gd in two different ways: first, by setting gd = gS at the Z pole in order
to map out the general features of the solutions in Section 5.5, and second, by
requiring the dark IR Landau pole to be 0.5 GeV in order to make d fall in a
relevant part of parameter space for self-interacting dark matter in Section 5.6. This
second requirement could be refined by using auxiliary measurements (e.g. on the
lattice) but should capture the main features we are interested in; relevant to our
analysis is the comparison of the different dark sectors.
5.4. Model 97
Much like the top Yukawa in the Standard Model, the  function of Y 3,3 will
be sensitive to the dark gauge group already at one loop level, which is the source
of the dependence on the precise form of the group of the mixing angle  in Equa-
tion (5.5), as the one loop  functions for 2, 3 and x all have a dependence on
 . Additionally these also depend on M [4850]

. (5.8e)
Here C(A) is the quadratic Casimir of the adjoint representation (= N), T (M)
is the index of M, and C(M) the quadratic Casimir of M.
Taking the Standard Model as a guiding example, it is also reasonable to expect
an SU(N) to capture the most important RGE effects even when the gauge group
is enlarged, and hence this study should have some applicability beyond the simple
scenario we consider here.
5.4.2 Dark U(1)s
We also consider a model with a dark U(1) symmetry. In order to keep this force
short-ranged  must be complex and charged under this U(1) in order to break the
gauge symmetry by generating a mass term for the new gauge boson using the extra
scalar degree of freedom. To avoid anomalies we will use three Weyl fermions and
choose the charges as qd,L  0, ud,R  1/2, dd,R  1/2,   1/2. The dark sector
Lagrangian is then:
Ldark = Y i,ju (u

98 Chapter 5. Strongly-interacting Dark Sectors at Hadron Colliders
This gives us a theory which is similar to the one introduced above, with mass-
mixing in the dark fermion sector, and which is not confining and has a Yukawa-like
interaction potential between the dark fermion fields thanks to the vacuum being
charged under the dark U(1). Note that we will refer to the gauge coupling in the
U(1) model as g in contrast to gd in the non-Abelian case. Much like in the non-
Abelian case we assume only the largest Yukawa term is relevant and set Y 3,3u = 0.7
and the rest to 0. This gives a mass eigenstate with a mass of  70 GeV for the
purposes of the branching ratio calculation just like in the SU(N) case. We keep
all other parameters the same. We also assume there is no kinetic mixing between
the dark U(1) and U(1)Y . The renormalisation group equations for this model are
given below. Note that we have changed the normalisation of the  field to that
of a complex scalar field, and include a factor of 1/
2 when expanding around x
(leading to factor of 2 difference for terms involving squared Yukawas).

We use implementations of our models in the Mathematica-based package
Sarah [190] to obtain the relevant  functions at one loop for the described scenar-
ios (checked against the general forms given in [50]), and solve these for the given
boundary conditions using a slightly modified implementation of the RGE solver in
SARAH which allows for boundary conditions to be defined at other points than
the lowest scale considered. These are then used to calculate the running of the

mixing angle using the definition in Equation 5.5, which we numerically fit using
built-in Mathematica functions. This fitted function is then passed on to a FOR-
TRAN implementation of a full leading-order pp hj parton level event generator
based on Vbfnlo [191] with the analytic form of the matrix element evaluated using
FormCalc [192,193], arriving at a one loop RGE-improved parton level calculation
which is typically used in QCD LO calculations. Finally we take the branching ratio
Br(h  ) into account as a flat rescaling at the Higgs masses, which corresponds
to the advocated prescription of the Higgs Cross Section Working Group [194]. In
the matrix element calculation the renormalisation scale is set to pT (h), which is a
motivated relevant scale for the logarithmically enhanced modifications of the cross
section at large momentum transfers.
5.5.1 14 and 100 TeV hadron colliders
We estimate the monojet background by generating pp  (Z  )j parton level
events and scaling this by a factor of 1.5 to get an estimate of the total background
following [113].
In order to get a handle on the strong sector dynamics, we need to study the
energy dependence of exclusive cross sections. Concretely this means we need to
determine how an excess in the monojet channel scales as a function of EmissT when
such a signal can be extracted from the background. This will allow us to make a
statement about the likely gauge structure of the dark sector if different dark gauge
have checked that including two loop effects does not change the results presented here.
While mismeasured lepton (W  l)j events are important and slightly change the scaling
with energy of the background, this rescaling should be conservative for our purposes as back-
grounds at larger EmissT will be over-estimated.

dence level calculation detailed in the text.
groups indeed predict a statistically relevant deviation in a comparison. The relative
scaling of the cross section as a function of missing EmissT for different gauge groups
and different representations of SU(5) is given in Figure 5.2. Due to our choice of
scale the behaviour will be exactly the same at all center-of-mass energies.
The constraints from single Higgs phenomenology enforce a small mixing angle
for SM-like Higgs measurements, which act as a boundary condition to the RGE
flow. We therefore find for our parameter point that the absolute cross sections at
14 TeV are too small for a measurement to be made even with the full HL-LHC
data set.
The cross sections at a 100 TeV proton-proton collider given in Table 5.1 are
large enough to offer an opportunity to make a measurement of the running of 
using a data set of 10 ab1. Given the expected small mixing angle, the largest
experimental challenge will undoubtedly be the reduction of the systematic uncer-
tainties of the measurements by over an order of magnitude compared to the recent
8 and 13 TeV monojet analyses by ATLAS and CMS [113, 146, 195, 196]. The im-
peding factor of a 14 TeV analysis, i.e. the smallness of the expected signal cross
By changing the parameters, however, we could indeed maximise the potential sensitivity at
the HL-LHC at the price of creating further tension with Higgs signal strength measurements. We
do not discuss this case in detail as it would require additional dynamics in order to remain viabl.e

section as well as a limited data set will be overcome at a 100 TeV machine, where
the signal cross sections are large enough to gather very large statistics with the aim
to use data-driven, as well as multivariate techniques, which essentially remove the
background uncertainties to a very large extent. Using an extrapolation from the
low-missing-energy regime is not straightforwardly possible since the low-missing-
energy phase space region receives a contribution from signal events, and is not
entirely background dominated. However, Z boson data can be extrapolated from
visible Z  e+e and  + jet subsidiary measurements at essentially zero statisti-
cal uncertainty (note that all involved couplings are gauge couplings following 5.1),
which essentially allows us to directly infer the dominant Z( )+ jet distribution
completely using data-driven techniques. Similar techniques were used already for
8 TeV analyses, e.g. [197] . Since the detector layout of a 100 TeV machine is likely
to change towards an improved electromagnetic calorimeter coverage [198,199], this
mapping from (Z  e+e)+ jet and + jet could also be performed without relying
on an extrapolation into the jet-acceptance region beyond the lepton and photon
acceptance regions || < 2.5 that is imposed by the current LHC setup.
In the likely case that we can gain excellent control over the background dis-
tribution in a data-driven approach (i.e. assuming only statistical uncertainties),
we can expect a 5 discovery threshold of & 100 fb1 using a binned log-likelihood

approach (as detailed in Refs. [99, 200]) based on the missing energy distribution
for the SU(2) running, although the signal vs. background ratio is small. Dis-
criminating the SU(2) from the SU(20) hypothesis, for instance, should then be
possible at 95% CLs [100] for L & 1.6 ab1 (assuming statistical uncertainties only,
Figure 5.4). Similar conclusions hold for discriminating large non-Abelian groups
against the U(1) scenario (at slightly smaller integrated luminosities).
5.5.2 Probing dark sectors through h couplings
Since our SM-like scalar h has its couplings scaled by cos() we could in theory
also use these to investigate the structure of the dark sector. Measuring  at mh is
straightforward (current measurements already put some tension on our parameter
point), after which the scaling could be investigated through a similar analysis as
above but using cleaner and better understood visible decay channels, with larger
cross sections. However, the issue with such a measurement is that  generically
runs to smaller values and hence towards the maximum of cos  where derivatives
vanish; at small 1,2, cos(1)/ cos(2)  1. At our parameter point we find cross
section differences of up to 30% between SU(2) and SU(20) at a scale of 1 TeV
when looking at production scaled by sin()2 (running away from the minimum),
but these differences shrink to about 1% when scaling by cos()2. At smaller values
of (mh) this problem is further worsened and already with (mh) = 0.1 one needs
to investigate differences of O(0.01%), which is challenging the sensitivity range of
a future lepton collider [201,202].
5.5.3 A note on future lepton colliders
At a future lepton collider the two dominant production mechanisms for h would be
h-strahlung and WW fusion. h-strahlung is a threshold effect and would as such
be inherently insensitive to the running of . WW fusion dominates at higher
and does in theory feel the running of  but since the final state would be h, a
measurement would have to rely on a radiated photon leading to cross sections of the
order of O(110 fb) for
s = 5001000 GeV for unpolarised e+e beams, making
a measurement dependent on extremely large integrated luminosities. However,
thanks to the controlled kinematics at a lepton collider, the dominant background
(Z  ) peaks strongly at E = EZ = Ebeam for Ebeam  mZ , whereas the signal
peaks below E < mh , which allows for an almost background-free analysis before
detector effects are taken into account. The choice of scale here is not straightforward
5.6. Potential Relation with self-interacting dark matter 103
and we can expect non-RGE electroweak effects to play a significant role. Although
this channel provides a clean avenue to test the hypothesis, RGE analyses alone
cannot obtain a reliable estimate of the sensitivity.
5.6 Potential Relation with self-interacting dark matter
As discussed at the start of the chapter, there are measurements which point towards
a large DM self-interaction cross section of the order /m ' 1.3 b/GeV [161]. Such
a large cross section can of course be achieved by going to very small mass scales
in the perturbative regime (see e.g. [203]) and our U(1) discussion of the previous
section is therefore directly relevant for these scenarios.
Cross sections of this size are not unusual in strongly interacting confined theories
such as QCD, and we focus on this possibility in the following in detail. While the
non-Abelian theories we have discussed so far are asymptotically free, explaining the
relatively large characteristic decrease in cross section at large momentum transfers,
they will confine at low scales which gives rise to a series of hadronic states in the
dark sector. The details are highly dependent on the respective fermion and gauge
symmetry content and the details as well as the existence of realistic confining
theories can only be clarified by lattice simulations. However, we can obtain a
qualitative estimate of whether such theories can reproduce self-interacting dark
matter scenarios by means of chiral perturbation theory (PT). To this end we
assume that the self-interaction cross section is dominated by nonrelativistic pion
scattering, well below the energy scales of other dark hadronic resonances. This will
provide an estimate of the validity range of such scenarios and give us an idea if
our previous discussion is relevant for self-interacting dark matter scenarios without
making a particular reference to modified velocity distributions of the dark matter
halo, which are likely to be found in theories with complex interactions [204,205,205].
Modifications from both corrections due to additional hadronic contributions to the
cross section as well as a modified dark matter profile will change our numerical
outcome, but can be compensated at least numerically by changing the fundamental
parameters of PT, which needs to be confirmed by lattice investigations.
The pion dynamics is completely determined by the [SU(N) SU(N)]/SU(N)
nonlinear sigma model describing the coset field (x) with dark pion decay constant

Analogous to QCD we assume the pion to be the lightest hadronic state in the
spectrum; if no additional gauged U(1) symmetry is present in the dark sector this
state will remain stable. The interactions that we consider follow from expanding
the non-linear sigma model using the CCWZ prescription (see Section 2.4.2.1):

arrive at

where the ellipsis refers to higher-order terms in the PT expansion as well as inter-
actions of other states. With this Lagrangian we can compute the self-interaction
cross section straightforwardly (we have cross-checked our results against imple-
mentations with FeynRules [127] and FormCalc [192, 193]) and obtain in the
nonrelativistic limit

, (5.14)
which we can use to gauge whether self-interaction cross sections can be obtained
from theories that show similarities with QCD (we assume the mass to be generated
through a small explicit chiral symmetry violation analogous to QCD, as explained in
Section 5.4). With naive dimensional analysis [206] (NDA), we can furthermore limit
the parameter range of the dark pion decay constant given its mass. The mass needs
to be smaller than the NDA cutoff m < d ' 4f and pion scattering needs to be
in agreement with the observed self-interaction cross section of /m ' 1.3 b/GeV.
This locates the cutoff of the theory between 0.2 GeV . 4f . 0.8 GeV for pion
masses m < 0.8 GeV. Matching the Landau pole of the running of the dark sector
strong interaction to this energy scale then allows us to make a projection of the
impact of the running at large momentum transfers in the light of our discussion of
Sec. 5.5. The results are given in Figure 5.5.
As can be seen from Equation 5.14, if the self-interaction cross section is indeed
dominated by the low-energy pion interactions, the cross section alone does not con-
tain information about the strong dynamics as such (provided that the symmetry-
breaking pattern indeed produces a spectrum that matches our assumptions). If
this is the case, the only way to perform spectroscopy of the described scenario is
through studies of the momentum dependence of the fundamental parameters of the
dark sector UV theory. Since dark-gluon production is not directly accessible, an

investigation through portal-interactions whose presence can be established through
additional resonance searches is vital to gain information about the potential pres-
ence of such a sector given the discovery of an additional scalar which is compatible
with a Higgs mixing scenario.
Although our main focus is the general behavior of strongly interacting dark
sectors and their spectroscopy using Higgs mixing, models with self-interacting hid-
den sectors should also reproduce the correct measured relic density dh2  0.12
to be viable dark matter candidates. Our setup is flexible and allows for thermal
freeze-out to occur either through standard annihilation into the SM as outlined in
Section 3.2.1.1, through number-changing 3  2 interactions between the dark pi-
ons as in [89,207] (subject to the conditions detailed in this work), or a combination
of the two, depending on the details of the chosen parameter point.
There is also the possibility that glueballs make up most of the relic density
instead of the pions as qualitatively discussed above. Since our discussion involves
asymptotically free dark sectors, the analyses of [208,209] are applicable in this case:
on the one hand, the correct relic density can be achieved by tuning the ratio of the
visible and dark sector temperatures, which, however, requires an extremely small
mixing. Under these circumstances the discovery of the additional scalar becomes
impossible. On the other hand, if both sectors are in thermal contact through non-
negligible mixing angles, we need to rely on additional (supersymmetric) dynamics
to make the model cosmologically viable [208]. Our discussion does not apply in
these cases straightforwardly and we leave an analysis of supersymmetric extensions
106 Chapter 5. Strongly-interacting Dark Sectors at Hadron Colliders
to future work.
5.7 Conclusions
Dark sectors are SM extensions motivated to tackle a plethora of unexplained phe-
nomenological observations that require physics beyond the SM. Their appeal from a
model-building perspective comes at the price of a naturally suppressed phenomeno-
logical sensitivity yield in terrestrial experiments such as colliders. In this study,
using RGE-improved calculations, we have motivated that studying the energy de-
pendence of scalar mediators, produced at a future hadron collider and decaying
invisibly, can be utilised to gain some insights into the nature of the hidden sector,
in particular because data-driven methods will be available for large data sets of
10 ab1. Gaining excellent systematic control over the backgrounds well beyond
the current expectations of theoretical as well as experimental uncertainties will be
crucial to obtain these insights into strongly interacting dark sectors, which can
complement other lattice investigations.
We have used this rather general observation for the concrete case of self-
interacting dark matter, whose large cross section can be naturally explained by
strong dynamics. If the strongly interacting dark matter scenario turns out to be
true and its relation to the TeV scale through e.g. Higgs mixing becomes favoured,
then the described approach will be a unique collider-based strategy that provides in-
sight into a strongly interacting sector (supplied by calculations of finite corrections
which are not governed in our RGE-based approach), albeit remaining experimen-
tally challenging.
It is worthwhile mentioning that the authors of [208] found that the number of colours is
required to be small, which decreases the relative impact of the RGE running when the mixing
angle interactions of hidden and visible sectors are non-neglible.

6.2 Summary
As outlined in Sections 2.4.2.2 and 3.1.1, the search for di-Higgs production at the
LHC in order to measure the Higgs trilinear coupling and set constraints on or
discover new physics is one of the major goals of the LHC high luminosity phase.
Experimental feasibility studies [211, 212] suggest that such analyses will only be
successful if information from a range of channels is included. We will therefore
here investigate di-Higgs production in association with two hadronic jets and give
a detailed discussion of both the gluon- and weak boson fusion contributions, with a
particular emphasis on the phenomenology with modified Higgs trilinear and quartic
hhV V gauge couplings. We perform a detailed investigation of the full hadronic
final state and find that hhjj production should add sensitivity to a di-Higgs search
combination at the HL-LHC with 3 ab1. Since the WBF and GF contributions are
sensitive to different sources of physics beyond the Standard Model, we devise search
strategies to disentangle and isolate these production modes. While gluon fusion
remains non-negligible in WBF-type selections, sizeable new physics contributions
to the latter can still be constrained. We demonstrate this by investigating the
sensitivity that can be obtained for a measurement of the quartic Higgs-gauge boson
couplings, which can be interpreted as a proxy for the Higgs self-energy and therefore
can potentially be related to solutions to the hierarchy problem, as outlined in
Section 3.1.1.
We also consider the phenomenology of CP violating extended Higgs sectors
by investigating a subset of CP-odd effective field theory operators, and show that
perturbative unitarity arguments together with the non-observation of any new res-
onant states in the LHCs energy range thus far can be used to strongly constrain
the low-energy Wilson coefficients of many of these. Extending our discussion to an
operator which can be generated in a simplified model of a CP violating Two Higgs

CP violating effects in the Higgs sector. We then return to our discussion of hhjj
production and show that the weak boson fusion component is highly sensitive to
this operator.
6.3 hhjj production as a precision test of the Standard
Model
A measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling would provide both a precision
test of the Standard Model and a sensitive probe of beyond Standard Model physics.
This Higgs self-coupling manifests itself primarily in a destructive interference in
gluon fusion-induced di-Higgs production [213215] through feeding into the trilinear
Higgs interaction with strength 3SM = mh
/2 in the SM. The latter relation can
be altered in BSM scenarios, for example the SM coupling pattern can be distorted
by the presence of a dimension six operator  (HH)3, and di-Higgs production is
the only channel with direct sensitivity to this interaction [216,217]. A modification
solely of the Higgs trilinear coupling, which is typically invoked in di-Higgs feasibility
studies, is predicted in models of 2-less electroweak symmetry breaking [218].
After the Higgs discovery, analyses of the di-Higgs final state at the high-
luminosity LHC and beyond have seen considerable attention. Feasibility studies by
ATLAS and CMS [211, 212] have highlighted the complexity of these analyses and
110 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
the necessity to explore different production mechanisms to obtain the strongest
constraints possible.
Di-Higgs production in association with two jets is a particularly important
channel in this regard since this final state receives contributions from the weak
boson fusion (WBF) production mode. The phenomenological appeal of the WBF
mode is twofold. Firstly, the weak boson fusion component of pp hhjj is sensitive
to modifications of the gauge-Higgs sector [210, 219], which can lead to large cross
section enhancements. Secondly, the QCD uncertainties for the WBF topologies
are known and under theoretical control [220, 221], such that a search for BSM
electroweak-induced deviations is not hampered by QCD systematics. This situation
is very different from QCD-induced production [222225], and can be attributed to
the particular phenomenology of WBF-like processes [226231].
However, an additional source of uncertainty that was neglected until the calcu-
lation in [210] is the correct inclusion of the gluon fusion contribution to pp hhjj
analyses. Similar to single Higgs + 2 jet production [232,233], the correct inclusion
of massive fermion thresholds is crucial to a reliable prediction of QCD-induced
pp hhjj [41].
Given that the cross sections in WBF hhjj production are very suppressed
compared to WBF hjj production (the WBF hhjj cross section is  750 times
smaller at 14 TeV), we have to rely on the dominant hadronic Higgs decay modes
to be able to observe this final state. This rules out one of the most crucial single
Higgs WBF selection tools - the central jet veto [234]. The observation of WBF-
induced pp hhjj production is further hampered by the top threshold in the QCD-
mediated process. Since the top threshold sets the scale of the di-Higgs subsystem,
an analysis that tries to retain as many low pT Higgs bosons as possible leads to a
QCD contribution that dominates over the WBF component when minimal WBF-
like cut requirements are imposed [210].
In this chapter we perform a detailed comparison of EFT-approaches to QCD-
mediated pp  hhjj against a calculation keeping the full mass dependencies of
top and bottom quarks in Section 6.4. We compare the QCD-induced pp  hhjj
phenomenology to the WBF signature in Section 6.5 before we discuss general ap-
proaches to isolate the signal from the dominant top backgrounds in a hadron level
analysis in Section 6.6. This sets the stage for a discussion about the prospects to
isolate the WBF and GF components in Sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2, followed by a study
on constraining V V hh couplings using the WBF induced signal in Section 6.6.3.

order QCD effects.
To complement the interpretation in terms of 3 and V V hh measurements, we also
consider perturbative unitarity constraints on CP violating effects in the Higgs sec-
tor in Section 6.7, and ultimately show that a hhjj measurement strongly constrains
an operator which is unaffected by such theoretical considerations in Section 6.9.
We focus on collisions with 14 TeV throughout.
6.4 The gluon fusion contribution
6.4.1 Finite top mass effects
Effective field theory approximations in the mt   limit, as introduced in Sec-
tion 2.4.5.1, can not be invoked to study di-Higgs final states at colliders in a re-
liable way due to the effects of the top-quark threshold [235, 236]. Additionally
the breakdown of the mt   approximation is worsened in the presence of addi-
tional jet emission [41, 237]. Finite mt effects must therefore be considered for all
QCD di-Higgs production channels. This is crucially important when considering
WBF-induced hhjj production as signal as the GF-induced component will act as
a non-reducible background.
The computational challenges in QCD-mediated hhjj production are significant,
with the gluon-fusion channels particularly time consuming. The standard method
of simulating a differential cross section from unweighted events is not feasible in
this case, and we instead use a reweighting technique that is exploited in higher
order calculations and experimental analyses (see for example [238]).
We generate GF hhjj events by implementing the relevant higher dimensional
operators in the mt   limit obtained by expanding the low-energy effective
theory discussed in Section 2.4.5.1,

112 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
in MadEvent v5.1 [239] using the FeynRules/Ufo [240] framework. This allows
us to sample a weighted set of events that we subsequently feed into our analysis
solely depending on their final state kinematics. If an event passes the selection
requirements of a certain search region, we correct for the full mass dependence
using the reweighting library based on GoSam package [241,242] at this stage. The
reweighting employs exactly the same matrix elements used for the event gener-
ation and the trilinear coupling is steered through a modification of the GoSam
matrix element, i.e. variations of the trilinear coupling are part of the reweighting.
A selection of Feynman diagrams which contribute to the gluon fusion signal are
illustrated in Figure 6.1. The GoSam code used for the reweighting is based on
a Feynman diagrammatic approach using QGRAF [243] and FORM [244, 245] for
the diagram generation, and Spinney [246], Haggies [247] and FORM to write an
optimised fortran output. The reduction of the one loop amplitudes was done using
Samurai [248], which uses a d-dimensional integrand level decomposition based on
unitarity methods [249253]. The remaining scalar integrals have been evaluated
using OneLoop [254]. Alternative reduction techniques can be used employing
Ninja [255257] or Golem95 [258260]. To validate the reweighting procedure we
have performed a full phase space integration and we find full agreement within the
statistical uncertainties between the result obtained from reweighting and the result
from the full phase space integration.
6.4.2 Phenomenology of QCD-mediated hhjj production
Top thresholds are particularly prominent in the di-Higgs invariant mass distribu-
tion, which makes it well-suited to show the improvements of our finite mt calcula-
tion compared to the effective theory of Equation 6.1. Other observables constructed
from the six particle final state are also relevant when performing a targeted phe-
nomenological analysis so we will discuss a number of them here.
In Figures 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 we show a selection of hhjj final state observables
for inclusive cuts pT,j > 20 GeV and |j | < 5, no cuts on Higgs bosons are imposed.
We label Higgs bosons and jets according to their hardness, i.e. pT,h1 > pT,h2 and
pT,j1 > pT,j2. The cross sections are given in Table 6.1. The inclusive gluon fusion
cross section is about 2.5 times larger than the WBF cross section approximately
The effective theory implementation can be modified in the sense that only one effective vertex
insertion is allowed. This is gives only a mild  10% effect in the tail of the distribution, and is
not relevant for an order one EFT/full theory rescaling, see below.

As previously established in [41, 210, 235] the di-Higgs system is badly mod-
elled by the effective theory which overshoots the full theory cross section at high
momenta. The mhh distribution in Figure 6.4(a) is the crucial observable which
parametrises the finite top quark mass effects, and agrees well at small invariant

ably well, as shown in Figure 6.2(a). The jet emission on the other hand integrates
over a considerable range of mhh, and the ratio of full theory vs effective theory is
less than one for the entire range of pT,j1, Figure 6.2(b).
Considering just the dijet system in Figure 6.3, we observe that the jet kinemat-
ics is not severely impacted by the reweighting procedure upon marginalising over
the di-Higgs kinematics. The phase space dependence of the dijet invariant mass
Figure 6.3(a) is relatively mild aside from the total rescaling of the inclusive cross
sections, and the ratio for the pseudo-rapidity distribution of the jets is nearly flat,
Figure 6.3(b). This is also true for the azimuthal angle difference jj . The angular
distributions of the leading members of the jet-Higgs system are relatively mildly
impacted by the reweighting too Figure 6.4(b) and can be approximated by a total
reweighting by a K-factor. This agrees with the mhh being the observable most
sensitive to the top threshold, as suggested by the large impact of the reweighting
on mhh in Figure 6.4(a). A reweighting based on mhh to correct for finite top mass
effects could therefore potentially be used as a time-saving approach with reasonable
accuracy in future analyses.
6.5. The weak boson fusion contribution 115
6.5 The weak boson fusion contribution
The weak boson fusion contribution to pp hhjj has received considerable atten-
tion and precise higher-order QCD corrections are provided in [220,221,231]. Due to
the sensitivity of the WBF contribution to both the trilinear coupling and the quar-
tic V V hh (V = W,Z, ) vertices, as shown in the Feynman diagrams in Figure 6.5,
weak boson fusion to two Higgs bosons can, in principle, provide complementary
information about BSM physics which remains uncaptured in other associated di-
Higgs production channels.
We generate WBF samples with varying 3 using MadEvent v4 [261] and
normalise the cross section to NLO accuracy [220]. The WBF hhjj contribution
shares the QCD properties of WBF hjj production [226] which means it shares the
distinctive (j1, j2) distribution shown in Figure 6.6(a): to produce the heavy
di-Higgs pair we probe the initial state partons at large momentum fractions. This
together with a colour-neutral t-channel exchange of the electroweak bosons leads to
energetic back-to-back jet configurations at large rapidity separation and moderate
transverse momenta with a centrally produced Higgs pair. The production of an
additional Higgs boson in comparison to single Higgs production via WBF leads to
a cross section reduction by three orders of magnitude (see Table 6.1) in the SM.
Such a small inclusive production cross section highlights the necessity of considering
dominant Higgs decay channels such as h  bb and h  + which makes it
impossible to use central jet vetos [234] as a means to control the background and
GF contribution in a targeted analysis.
The gluon fusion contribution is bigger by a factor of 2.5 than the WBF com-
ponent of hhjj production. However with increasing invariant di-Higgs mass the
WBF contribution is enhanced relative to GF production as a consequence of the
suppression above the 2mt threshold, as shown in Figure 6.6(b).
Since we cannot rely on vetoing hadronic activity in the central part of the
detector, a potential discrimination of GF from WBF needs to be built on the
following strategy, which we will investigate in Section 6.6:
 To isolate the di-Higgs (WBF+GF) signal we can exploit the relative hardness
of the di-Higgs pair which peaks around  2mt. Such hard events are less likely
to be produced by (ir)reducible backgrounds.
 Focussing on large mhh we can enhance WBF over GF by stringent cuts on
the jet rapidity separation. This will also imply a significant decrease of QCD-

well-suited observables for unravelling the colour correlations in the final state

6.6. Taming the background 119
6.6 Taming the background
For our hadron level analysis we shower our signal samples with Herwig++ [264]
and generate backgrounds as follows: ttjj, tth, Zhjj, and ZZjj with Sherpa [265],
and ZWWjj with MadEvent v5. We find the dominant backgrounds to be ttjj
and tth production, for which next-to-leading order results are available [266277]
and we use inclusive K factors Kttjj ' 1 and Ktth ' 1.5 to estimate the higher
order contributions to these backgrounds. Higgs branching ratios are set to the
values agreed upon by the Higgs Cross Section Working Group [194].
We begin the hadron level analysis implemented in Rivet [137] by recreating a
base selection similar to [210]:
1.) We require two tau leptons using a two tau-trigger based on staggered transverse
momentum selection cuts pT  29, 20 GeV in | | < 2.5 and assume a flat tau
tagging efficiency of 70% with no fakes.
Jets are constructed by clustering R = 0.4 anti-kT jets using FastJet [138]
with pT,j  25 GeV and |j |  4.5.
2.) The two leading jets are b-tagged with an acceptance of 70% and fake rate of
1% [278] in the central part of the detector |j | < 2.5. We remove events if
either of the two leading jets overlaps with a tau. Any additional jets which do
not overlap with a tau are considered as potential tagging jets, of which we
require at least two.
3.) As a final step of this base selection we require the b jet and tau pairs to repro-
duce the Higgs mass of 125 GeV within 15 and 25 GeV respectively.
The signal and background cross sections after these cuts are presented in the
Base Selection column of Table 6.2. We find that the background contribution
of ttjj dominates with tth also providing a larger-than-signal background resulting
in S/B  1/300, making a study based only on these selections extremely chal-
lenging. Since we only have  40 expected gluon fusion and  10 expected weak
boson fusion events at 3 ab1 luminosity, additional selections must also be careful
to retain enough signal cross section to allow statistically meaningful statements to
be made with a finite amount of data.
It was argued recently [279] that single jet tagging [280] could provide an alternative at high
luminosity for single Higgs production at lost WBF/GF purity.
A high mass resolution is a crucial cornerstone of any successful di-Higgs analysis to assure a
minimum pollution of Z boson decay backgrounds [281].

under the assumption of no systematic uncertainties (a) and 20%
systematic uncertainties (b). The 95% C.L. limit on  is defined by the value for
which the expected number of theory events intersects with the experimental limit.
Shape comparisons for the rapidity and di-Higgs invariant mass distributions as
motivated in the previous section are shown in Figure 6.7. Indeed, as expected,
cutting on the rapidity distance between the jets will serve to purify towards a
WBF-only selection at a reduced background rate. The dominant backgrounds are
unlikely to produce a large invariant mass mhh. However the WBF contribution,
due to the lack of the 2mt threshold peaks at a considerably lower invariant mass,
leading to significant decrease of the WBF contribution for a reasonably strong cut
on mhh, which is required to observe the hhjj signal at the given low signal yield,
even at 3 ab1 luminosity.
6.6.1 Prospects to isolate gluon fusion
We can extend the analysis outlined in Section 6.6 with the aim to purify the
selection towards the GF component. We make use of the hard Higgs candidates
to greatly reduce the backgrounds by requiring mhh  500 GeV and additionally
require (j1, j2)  5 to minimise the weak boson fusion contribution. The signal
and background cross sections after these cuts are applied are presented in the GF
Selection column of Table 6.2.
The total background is reduced by a factor of  100 while the gluon fusion
contribution only is reduced by a factor of  2.5 which allows for an encouraging
Following the analysis of [282], we can expect negligible interference between WBF and GF
and which allows us to make this distinction.

6.6.2 Prospects to isolate weak boson fusion
Similarly we can extend the analysis towards isolating the WBF component. Since it
has slightly softer Higgs candidates we require mhh  400 GeV and (j1, j2)  5
to reduce both the gluon fusion and background contributions. The signal and
background cross sections after these cuts are applied are presented in the WBF
Selection column of Table 6.2.
122 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
The total background is reduced by a factor of  300 while three times more
of the weak boson fusion contribution is retained compared to the GF selection,
resulting in S/
B  0.8 with 3 ab1 of data due to the large reduction in the
gluon fusion contribution. However even so the WBF selection is composed of one-
to-three parts GF to WBF, which means measurements of physics that only enters
the weak boson fusion contribution will need to take this gluon fusion pollution
into account. This suggests a proper treatment of the gluon fusion component, as
we have provided here, is crucial for any analysis relying on the WBF production
mode.
6.6.3 Constraining the quartic V V hh contribution
As mentioned in Section 6.5 there is a contribution from quartic V V hh vertices to
the WBF induced signal, and modifications of the corresponding gV V hh couplings
away from their SM values using the Higgs Cross Section Working Group  frame-
work [194] will greatly enhance the signal cross section. This allows us to constrain
 defined by gV V hh =   gSMV V hh. To achieve this we have generated events with
varying  using MadEvent v5 and applied the WBF selections described in Sec-
tion 6.6.2 to estimate the enhancement of the signal, which is compared to expected
cross section limits on the signal with 3 ab1 of data in the WBF selection under the
assumptions of no systematic uncertainties and 20% total systematic uncertainties
for comparison. The results are presented in Figure 6.8. We find that in the more
realistic scenario of 20% systematic uncertainties the expected constraint on the
gV V hh couplings is 0.55 <  < 1.65 at the 95% confidence level. A measurement of
pp hhjj is therefore crucial to constrain new physics which enters predominantly
through enhancements to gV V hh, which can be used as a proxy for investigating
the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking as outlined in Section 3.1.1.
6.6.4 Event shapes of the tagging jets system
The analysis strategies outlined so far have mainly relied on exploiting correlations
in the di-Higgs system, with only (j1, j2) carrying information about the tagging
jets. Following similar applications in the context of single Higgs production [283],
we have also investigated a range of event shapes in the tagging jets system. These
could offer additional discriminating power through capturing colour correlations in
the different signal contributions beyond angular dependencies. More specifically,
we will present results for N -jettiness [284,285] and the thrust major which provided
6.6. Taming the background 123
the best results.
We calculate N -jettiness by minimising:
N = C
pT,k min(Rk,1, . . . ,Rk,N ) , (6.2)
where C is a normalisation which cancels when taking the ratio of two s, the sum
is taken over all visible momenta which do not belong to one of the identified Higgs
candidates within || < 5, and Rk,n is the distance in the  plane between the
k-th momentum and the n-th reference vector (which are collectively defined such
that they minimise Equation 6.2). 3/2 is then explicitly given by 3/2.
Thrust major is defined by maximising the scalar product with radiation in the
plane perpendicular to the direction of the thrust vector:
Tmaj = max
~n~nT=0
k |~pk  ~n|
k |~pk|
. (6.3a)
Here ~nT is the normalised thrust vector:
~nT = max
k |~pk  ~n|
k |~pk|
. (6.3b)
Again the sums run over all visible momenta which do not belong to one of the
identified Higgs candidates within || < 5.
Both of these observables are very sensitive to radiation away from the jet axes
in the event, and thus non-trivial colour connections in the underlying hard matrix
element which generate such radiation.
We find 3/2 and Tmaj show promise for improving the WBF selection, but the
signal cross section is already too low for us to be able to make meaningful use of
this insight. The 3/2 and Tmaj distributions after the GF and WBF selections have
been applied are presented in Figure 6.9. Cutting, for example, on Tmaj < 0.05, the
gluon fusion contribution is reduced by 80%, while the WBF contribution is reduced
by only 55% amounting to a total of 2 expected WBF and 0.3 expected GF events,
with backgrounds very strongly suppressed. This means that WBF can in principle
be observed at a small rate that can be used to set constraints on new physics in an
almost GF-free selection with greatly reduced backgrounds.
The event shape distributions can also be used to greatly reduce the background
in the GF selection as evident from Figure 6.9(c). It should be noted that these
improvements of GF vs WBF vs background ultimately depend on underlying event
and pile up conditions and have to be taken with a grain of salt in this hadron level
analysis. However the clear separation that can be achieved with these observables
124 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
indicate that an analysis employing multivariate analysis techniques could, at least
in theory, significantly improve the results presented here. These techniques may
also prove useful at a 100 TeV collider where the di-Higgs production cross section
is substantially higher [286].
6.7 CP structure of the Higgs sector
Having shown the potential of a measurement of hhjj production to constrain 3 and
V V hh vertices, we will also demonstrate its utility in constraining new operators
in the Higgs-gauge sector. These can arise for example as the result of an enlarged
Higgs sector. Here we will consider the case of CP violating effects from such an
enlarged sector.
There is strong evidence that h can be characterised by a dominant CP-even
coupling pattern to gauge bosons [287, 288]. The sensitivity of this measurement is
driven by large modified production rates compared to the Standard Model (SM) if
CP-odd couplings were dominant [289291], as well as different kinematics if cross
section information is not included in the analysis [288,292294].
The experimental observations of Higgs boson decays to electroweak bosons
h  ZZ,WW outlined in Table 2.4 are already a strong indication of a CP-even
character of the gauge-Higgs interactions. A CP-odd interaction parameterised by
L  g
/v hZZ which overpowers the L  ghhZ mZ hZZ term that follows
from gauge boson mass generation through electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)
would imply the breakdown of perturbation theory, only avoided if the longitudinal
gauge boson degrees of freedom are generated by a mechanism which is not directly
related to the observed Higgs boson with mh ' 125 GeV. This would be difficult to
reconcile with the otherwise successful description of the physics at this scale using
perturbation theory. Taking the measurements in the ZZ channel at face value,
the latter would need to be accompanied by a low scale of perturbative unitarity
violation, well below the TeV scale, which is typically mended by either resolving
a potential substructure responsible for the TeV scale or by accessing new resonant
degrees of freedom. However, the LHC has already explored regions well beyond
this regime without any evidence of neither weakly nor strongly-coupled degrees
of freedom, as discussed in Section 2.4.2. In this sense, the statistically signifi-
cant observation of pp  h  ZZ alone does cement the very character of mostly
CP-even couplings to vector bosons, which is a generic property of spontaneous
6.7. CP structure of the Higgs sector 125
symmetry breaking directly linked with perturbative unitarity of the Higgs-gauge
sector [295,296].
Strong constraints on CP violating interactions are typically inferred from flavor
and electric dipole measurements [297303]. These indirect probes of CP viola-
tion (which in the EDM context are strongest for interactions with first or second
generation fermions) need to be contrasted with direct searches as performed by
ATLAS and CMS. It is therefore natural to ask how CP violation can be accom-
modated by current Higgs measurements, in particular by the Run I combination
of ATLAS and CMS data [34]. Given the absence of any conclusive hints for new
resonant physics around the TeV scale, and taking into account the aforementioned
unitarity-related issues, we can expect that a low energy effective formulation of
TeV scale physics will reflect the imprint of a good probabilistic behavior of the
underlying UV model. Understanding an effective theory formulation as the tool of
mediating measurements between theories with widely separated scales, large fun-
damental CP violating effects at a scale that lies well above the electroweak scale
could therefore present themselves at low scales in the guise of operators that do
not immediately imply unitarity violation close to the TeV scale. Another possibil-
ity is the presence of additional intermediate degrees of freedom which could mend
whatever unitarity violation that seems to be present above the TeV scale. Put dif-
ferently, if no new particles are present, unitarity imposes a well-defined bias on the
perturbative expansion of new physics effects in terms of a dimension six extended
SM effective field theory framework [27]:
L = LSM +
Oi . (6.4)
This hierarchy will be fully reflected by the Wilson coefficients if we choose all
i    v in Equation 6.4 and limit ourselves to weakly-coupled UV theories.
The latter point is required to give perturbative unitarity violation a well-defined
meaning.
We will analyse the tree-level interplay of CP violation in the fermion-Higgs
and gauge-Higgs sectors and unitarity using the tools of effective field theory. As-
suming that amplitudes are well-behaved to high energies, we identify operators
in Section 6.8 which are largely unconstrained by tree-level unitarity requirements.
Using recent signal strength measurements as reported by ATLAS and CMS in [34],
we analyse the direct phenomenological implications of allowed CP violation in the
Higgs sector for future LHC exotics searches in Section 6.9. We provide a summary
126 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
of this work and offer conclusions in Section 6.10.
6.8 Unitarity and CP violating Operators
We consider the lowest order CP-odd operators involving the physical Higgs field,
which lead to CP-violation in conjunction of the CP-even operators in the Standard
Model. A comprehensive list of operators has been presented in [304], for the purpose
of this study we limit ourselves to a few key operators, which, on the one hand, are
relevant to the dimension-6 framework. On the other, we also discuss the particular
example of an operator which arises in the EFT expansion of Two Higgs Doublet
Models, and allows us to make a connection to the dark matter-motivated extensions
considered in Chapters 4 and 5.
In this study we work in the broken phase of SU(2)L  U(1)Y and consider CP
violating operators effectively up to dimension 5. With this condition, we have the
unique operator in the fermion-Higgs sector:
Ohff4 = hf5f , (6.5a)
with f denoting the Standard Model fermions (f = u, d, s, c, b, t).
In the gauge-Higgs sector, we consider the following operators:
OhF F5 = hFF . (6.5b)
We use F = (A,Z,W,G) as the (dual) field strengths of the photon, Z-boson, W-
boson and gluon here. These operators can be generated by integrating out massive
fermions with CP-odd Yukawa couplings as in Equation 6.5a, and arise in general
in non-linear Higgs EFT [305]. We also consider an alternative new dimension 4
operator in the gauge-Higgs sector:
OhhZ4 = h(h)Z . (6.5c)
This operator deserves a special comment as its appearance is linked to extending
the dimension six EFT framework to a simplified multi-Higgs model, based on a
two Higgs doublet model potential. If EWSB is triggered by more than one Higgs
doublet, in the Georgi basis [306] the kinetic term,
Lkin = |DH1|2 + |DH2|2 , (6.6)
Given by H1 = [G+, (v + h1 + iG0)/
2]T , H2 = [H+, (h2 + iA)/
2]T .
6.8. Unitarity and CP violating Operators 127
leads to the massless would-be Goldstone boson G0 to be eaten by the Z boson,
Lkin  mZ (G0)Z . (6.7)
This term is removed by R gauge fixing, while the CP-odd A couples as:
Lkin 
h2(A)Z
  gZ
(h2)AZ
 . (6.8)
If there is mass mixing between the CP-even h1, h2 and odd A states as would be
induced by a non-zero Im 5
6 in the 2HDM potential
 [307] we have CP violation
in the Higgs sector: the situation is similar to the neutral kaon K0 system in the
Standard Model. However we would not immediately induce the operator in Equa-
tion 6.5c as the expression in Equation 6.8 would disappear for A, h2  h1 after
diagonalising since it is anti-symmetric. However if we allow dimension-6 operators,
1DH2)(H
H1) 
2 gZ i
[h2 (h2)Z
 +A (A)Z
] , (6.10)
it becomes clear that Equation 6.5c is generically induced by an EFT expansion of a
CP violating 2HDM. While the operator in Equation 6.5c therefore can be connected
to CP violation in a 2HDM potential straightforwardly, we will also show how it can
arise in a dark matter-inspired extension to a CP violating 2HDM. If there is in
addition to the two Higgs doublet potential a portal-type real singlet scalar S we
can postulate a dimension 5 operator:
S (DH1)
(DH2) . (6.11)
We then have additional interactions in unitary gauge:
cSv gZ
[S (A)Z
 + i S (h2)Z
] . (6.12)
If we also introduce a portal interaction
V (H1, S)   |H1|2 S 
v1 h1S
, (6.13)
we can see that mass mixing among the scalars in Equation 6.12 will induce Equa-
tion 6.5c.
We use the standard conventions for the 2HDM potential in this section:
V (H1, H2) 
1H2)(H
1H2) + 6(H
1H1)(H
1H2) + 7(H
2H2)(H
1H2) + h.c. (6.9)
While we only consider CP violation through mass-mixing here, it can also be introduced through
interactions by non-zero Im 5
7 and Im 
128 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
CP-mixing in the two Higgs doublet potential will then again link the operator
in Equation 6.5c to CP violation in the Higgs sector. If cSv  , the operator in
Equation 6.12 is not heavily mass suppressed and could potentially greatly enhance
the amount of CP violation present thanks to the 2HDM potential.
While this setup appears somewhat contrived it is not unjustified from a BSM
perspective: the singlet scalar portal is well-motivated in dark sector models as out-
lined in Section 5.3, and introducing a second Higgs doublet allows the couplings
to quarks in a generic Z -mediated simplified dark matter model to be completely
spin-dependent which ameliorates tension with direct dark matter detection con-
straints, as discussed in Section 4.4. In this sense this model could arise naturally
as a so-called Two Mediator Dark Matter Simplified Model [308] generalisation of
the model presented in Chapter 4, where S is interpreted as the dark Higgs.
Since we are not interested in the effects of other new operators we assume that
the additional states are sufficiently heavy to not immediately influence the Higgs
decay phenomenology as well as unitarisation rules through additional channels
opening up. We therefore assume h is dominantly composed of h1 in the following.
We will see that this particular coupling is perturbatively unconstrained.
In order to respect the stringent flavor constraints which exist we only consider
flavour diagonal operators as in Equation 6.5a. With these operators we can calcu-
late the high energy behavior of 2 2 scattering amplitudes from an initial state i
to a final state f , using the partial wave decomposition introduced in Section 2.4.2.1.
As discussed there, unitarity together with perturbativity (which we also have to
impose for an expansion of the operators in Equation 6.5 to be meaningful) requires
the partial waves to be small compared to unity and we will define the critical value
of the Wilson coefficients in our theory by saturating
|afij ()| = 1 . (6.14)
 should here be read as the highest scale at which we require our EFT to be
consistent.
We will consider the following Lagrangian:
L = LSM + ChhZ h(h)Z + Chtt ht5t+
hF F
OhF F5 . (6.15)
It should also be noted that the presence of multiple mixings typically yields a more SM-like
phenomenology of the lightest state in terms of signal strengths as compared to minimal Higgs
portal scenarios [182].

preted as the intended cutoff scale of the effective theory: if Ci() is greater than
the critical value, the effective theory is not perturbatively unitary. In this sense the
critical value can be seen as a theoretical limit on the allowed contributions from
these operators as a function of the cutoff scale of the Standard Model.
We focus on the top quark for the reasons outlined in Section 3.1.1 and choose the
electroweak vacuum expectation value as reference scale where necessary. Typically
the partial waves exhibit a hierarchy in the angular momentum J .
We have surveyed the list of processes relevant for unitarity violation at tree-
level. These include vector, Higgs and fermion scattering, as well as combinations of
the different particle species [309, 310]. We find that the tightest constraints follow
from the J = 0 projections and will focus on the most constraining channels, but
also mention other channels that are relevant for the discussion of the remainder of
this study. Our results are collected in Figure 6.10 and we detail them below:
Ohff4 : We first consider fermion-fermion scattering tt  tt, which receives contri-
butions from the operator in Equation 6.5a. We include the (modified) Higgs,
Z boson and photon intermediate states and discard the gluon contribution as
it corresponds to a non-trivial colour configuration, which does not interfere
with the colour singlet exchange. The zeroth partial wave of tt tt for identi-
cal helicity (zero total angular momentum) gives rise to only weak constraints
on the Wilson coefficient |Chtt| ' 7.1, not dependent on the scale . The
amplitude also quickly approaches an asymptotic value as a consequence of
130 Chapter 6. hhjj production and the CP nature of the Higgs sector
energy scales cancelling between the spinor normalisations and the s-channel
suppression leading to an energy-independent value.
Superior bounds can be obtained from tt VLVL. Note that due to the ver-
tex structure induced by the operators of Equation 6.5, the Wilson coefficients
hF F
do not contribute to scattering processes involving longitudinally polar-
ized vector bosons. Hence, the limit obtained from inelastic fermion scatter-
ing to gauge bosons provides a way to derive stringent unitarity constraints on
Ctth without the influence of accidental cancellations between the interactions
in the lagrangian 6.15. It is worth noting that the CP-odd Higgs interactions
therefore also exhibit a completely different unitarity-related behavior than
their CP-even counterparts [40]. Numerically we find that tt W+LW
L pro-
vides the most stringent constraint among these channels as the amplitude
shows a  Ctth
s behavior.
OhF F5 : We derive unitarity bounds on the Wilson coefficients ChAA, ChZZ , and Chgg
through investigating V V  V V scattering for transverse polarisations of the
participating vector bosons V = A,Z, g. For equal helicity and transverse ZZ
scattering we obtain, for example,
M(ZTZT  ZTZT ) = 
s 4m2Z
sm2h
+ {SM} , (6.16)
where {SM} refer to the well-known results of the SM [40], which do not give
rise to unitarity violation. For the massless gluons and photons we find a
similar relation for the unitarity violation-driving part.
The channels involving both A and Z introduces a cross-talk between the
and C
channels and the results quoted in Figure 6.10 are
calculated assuming C
= 0, which allows us to set constraints on
individually.
OhhZ4 : J = 0 unitarity constraints on this operator are calculated from multi-Higgs
scattering. For tt hh in the equal helicity case, we obtain
M(tt hh) = e

This also holds for hh hZL, leaving only hh hh as a potentially sensitive
channel to ChhZ for J = 0. In this channel, however, crossing symmetry
guarantees that the amplitude can only have a small sensitivity on the energy
of the scattering process for s  m2Z ,m2H . With s + t + u = 4m2h and this
cancellation only slightly affected by the different propagators of the s, t, u
channels for large enough energy, the unitarity constraint becomes largely
insensitive to the probed energy (Figure 6.10). Amplitudes for ZZ  hZ
vanish irrespective of polarisations; WW  hh does not receive contributions
from OhhZ4 insertions, and hh hZL is suppressed by an order of magnitude
compared to hh hh at the amplitude level.
Table 6.3 summarises the constraints on the Wilson coefficients weve found in
this section based on the perturbative unitarity argument. Out of the operators
we consider in this work, OhhZ4 is special in the sense that perturbative unitarity
arguments do not limit the associated Wilson coefficients range. This means that a

or perturbative UV completion.

sector
Considering CP violation in the Higgs-gauge sector in a collider phenomenology
context, we will therefore focus on the operator OhhZ4 which is weakly constrained
by unitarity arguments. Such an operator will impact multi-Higgs final states. The
dominant process of this type is Higgs pair production through gluon fusion gg 
hh, which can receive a new Z boson-mediated contribution from OhhZ4 . However,
since tt  hh does not give rise to an energy-dependent unitarity constraint, we
can already anticipate that the absorptive parts of the gg  hh amplitude will be
largely unaffected.
In Figure 6.12 we compare sensitivity estimates for di-Higgs productions from
ATLAS [311] and CMS [312] with the expected enhancement of pp hh at the LHC
due to the operator OhhZ4 . The most optimistic constraints that can be set from this
channel result from the 1.9- significance reported by CMS for the bb + bb+
combination [312], which translates into a Wilson coefficient constraint

This constraint is weaker than the perturbative limit and does not probe the unitar-
ity limit imposed by hh hh scattering from Figure 6.10. This result is expected in

The observed sensitivity of pp  hh to OhhZ4 dominantly arises from contribu-
tions of Equation 6.17, which contribute to the imaginary part of the loop-induced
gg  hh amplitude near the the threshold m(hh) ' 2mt through modifying the in-
terference pattern that exists in gluon fusion between the box- and triangle-induced
amplitude contributions (see Section 2.4.2.2). While the interference is modified, the
magnitude of this change induced by OhhZ4 quickly dies out for larger di-Higgs in-
variant masses. This kinematic suppression cannot be circumvented, but it points to
a different channel that accesses a distinct kinematic configuration of OhhZ4 , which is
not probed by the unitarity constraints of Figure 6.10 - di-Higgs production through
weak boson fusion (WBF), which accesses t-channel virtual massive gauge bosons,

This leads to a sizeable contribution to WBF-induced di-Higgs production, which
can be investigated through the hhjj final state as outlined in Section 6.6.2 above.

6.10 Conclusions
After discovering single Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider, new anal-
ysis strategies need to be explored to further constrain the presence of new physics
beyond the Standard Model. Higgs pair production is pivotal in this regard as con-
straints from multi-Higgs production contain complementary information, in partic-
ular with respect to the Higgs bosons self-interaction. Cross sections for di-Higgs
production are generically small at the LHC, which highlights the necessity to ex-
plore other viable channels than pp hh to enhance sensitivity in a combined fit at
high luminosity. To this end, we have investigated pp hhjj production in detail in
this study. Keeping the full top and bottom mass dependencies, we find sensitivity
of pp hhjj searches at the LHC for production in the SM and beyond. The gluon
fusion contribution remains important at high invariant di-Higgs masses where the
dominant backgrounds can be suppressed to facilitate a reasonable signal vs back-
ground discrimination. It remains large even for selections that enhance the weak
boson fusion fraction of pp hhjj events. This pollution is important when such
selections are employed to set constraints on new physics effects that enter in the
WBF contribution exclusively. Large new physics effects in the WBF contribution
can still be constrained, which we have illustrated through an investigation of the
constraints that can be set on deviations of the quartic V V hh couplings from their
SM values with the HL-LHC, demonstrating that a measurement of pp hhjj will
provide a powerful probe of these. Employing observables which are intrinsically
sensitive to the different colour correlation of WBF compared to GF, the discrimi-
nation between GF, WBF, and background can be further improved. However, the
signal cross section is typically already too small to use such a strategy to constrain
the presence of new physics if those effects are only a small deviation around the
SM. If new physics effects are sizable, such an approach will remain a well-adapted
strategy to minimise GF towards a pure WBF selection.
We have also considered CP violating effects in extensions to the Higgs sector,
and shown that many such extensions can be strongly constrained by requiring their
general description in terms of an effective theory to be perturbatively unitary at

the cutoff scale of the effective theory. A particular operator, OhhZ4 = hhZ,
which will arise in for example CP violating 2HDM models and extended simplified
dark matter models, turns out to not be sensitive to such theoretical constraints.
We have also shown that this operator is difficult to constrain with a measurement
of pp  hh production, but that hh  hhjj production offers a highly sensitive
probe.

7.2 Summary
As outlined in Sector 3.1.1, the large top Yukawa coupling suggests the top quark
could play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking. In this chapter we will
Chapter 7. Constraining resonances in the tt spectrum using
polarisation information
present a comprehensive study of the BSM applications of measuring the polarisation
of top quarks in a top resonance search context, and interpret constraints that can be
derived from such an analysis in terms of a Randall-Sundrum model where the right-
handed top quark plays such a privileged role. We focus on kinematically challenging
regions of the parameter space where ATLAS and CMS start losing sensitivity due to
the width of the expected resonance. Following the general modeling and analysis
strategies pursued by the experiments, we analyse the semi-leptonic and the di-
lepton tt channels and show that including polarisation observables can provide
considerable shape information with large data sets. This will allow us to set limits
for parameter choices where sensitivity from m(tt) is not sufficient. In a wider
context we use this to point out the importance of spin observables as part of a more
comprehensive set of observables to gain sensitivity to BSM resonance searches.
7.3 Spin observables for top resonance searches at the
Given the lack of any conclusive hint for new physics beyond the Standard Model
at the Large Hadron Collider so far, it is interesting to consider avenues to en-
hance the sensitivity of searches that target new states and interactions which are
kinematically accessible.
Observables which directly reflect the final state momentum transfer, such as in-
variant mass or transverse momentum distributions, are obvious choices for searches
for new resonant states. However, if the new physics production cross section is
small, these observables might not have enough shape information to isolate the
signal from the competing backgrounds satisfactorily. In these circumstances, the
LHC experiments typically favor multivariate techniques over rectangular cut flows.
While this approach can increase the sensitivity dramatically, care needs to be taken
during the training stage of the analysis. In particular, experimental constraints
(such as the detectors granularity, response effects and so on) need to be included
and understood precisely in order to formulate a realistic sensitivity estimate. The
optimisation of these methods lies firmly within the remit of the expertise of the
experimental community. Observables which enhance the sensitivity in a cut-flow
based analysis will retain their power when used in such a context, so from this per-
spective it is still useful to investigate individual observables. Additionally this also
allows us to gain a physical understanding of where the shape information comes

from which can be absent in high-dimensional multivariate analyses.
For instance, constraints on the production cross section of new resonant states
derived from mass resonance searches are strongly dependent on the assumed width
of the new state. Larger widths reduce the shape information the pole of the res-
onance provides when in the energy range of a collider as the signal increasingly
resembles a continuum excess rather than a localised peak. We will show that spin
polarisation observables are precisely observables which can provide complementary
shape information in such a case.
In this study we will focus on an extra-dimensional model used as a benchmark
for top resonance searches by both ATLAS and CMS, see for example [316, 317].
This compactified Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [22] introduces a series of isolated
graviton resonances into the 4D effective theory. If SM fields propagate in the entire
five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background geometry, the 4D theory will also
contain Kaluza-Klein copies of the low energy states that are identified with the
The ATLAS study in [316] demonstrates that the constraint on the production
cross section of a 3 TeV gluon gKK decaying to tt weakens by almost an order of
magnitude when going from /m = 10% to /m = 40%. Such large widths can be
problematic from a modeling perspective, as discussed in Section 4.4, but are not
unexpected in strongly-coupled theories inherent to the dual formulation of RS-type
theories. In fact, one of the coupling choices we will make in our analysis corresponds
to a width of /m = 37.5%, to be compared to /m  15% for the default coupling
choice made for the standard ATLAS and CMS benchmark point. This does not
require the presence of additional strongly coupled states in the direct vicinity as
these are given by the higher Kaluza-Klein modes which still are well-separated in
mass, although the convolution with parton densities could in practice produce a
non-negligible contribution at lower masses as their widths also get large. We will
assume such contributions are not relevant for the purposes of this study.
From the AdS/CFT [318321] perspective, the top quark being the heaviest
particle discovered so far plays a special role as its mass could be direct evidence
of (at least partial) compositeness. A potential composite structure of extra reso-
nances could therefore be reflected in the analysis of the associated top quark spin
observables, while a tt bump search alone does not access this level of detail.
These BSM-induced effects can be contrasted with the fact that tt production in
the SM at the LHC is dominated by parity-invariant QCD processes. We therefore
Chapter 7. Constraining resonances in the tt spectrum using
polarisation information
can expect to produce almost unpolarised tops. At the high invariant masses we
consider there is a sizeable contribution from weak processes which makes the SM
expectation slightly left-handed: for m(tt) > 3 TeV, Pt  0.15 where Pt = +()1
correspond to completely right-(left-)handed tops. This fact has inspired many
studies of top polarisation as a probe into BSM physics, both in pair [322324]
and single [325328] production. As the decays of Kaluza-Klein gluons gKK and
gravitons GKK in our model are dominated by right-handed tops these distributions
are modified for the signal component as pointed out in for example [329,330].
The crucial point which motivates our expectation that spin observables will
carry additional shape information is that increasing the width of a parent particle
only has a modest effect on the spin observables of its decay products. Therefore,
they should offer a great opportunity to not only access more shape information
generically, but also maintain this shape information when considering wider signal
models. We will show that this allows enhancements to the sensitivity of analyses
like [316].
In this study we consider pp  gKK/GKK  tt production and focus on both
the semi-leptonic and di-leptonic final states of the top decays in the region where the
reported sensitivity is low. Our goal is to determine to what extent top polarisation
and spin correlation measurements allow us to make stronger empirical statements
for the models studied in for example [316]. Our results can be considered as a
litmus test which motivates the inclusion of such observables in analyses based on
the aforementioned multivariate techniques pursued by the experiments, and gives
a solid theoretical basis for the gains in sensitivity that can be achieved by doing so.
This chapter is organised as follows: in Section 7.4 we introduce the model and
discuss relevant parameter choices for our analysis to make this study self-consistent.
In Section 7.5.1 we discuss the semi-leptonic final state, while Section 7.5.2 focuses
on the di-leptonic final state. In Section 7.6 we summarise our results and we present
our conclusions in Section 7.7.
7.4 The Model
In RS1 models [22] the hierarchy problem is solved by introducing an extra compact-
ified dimension rUV < z < rTeV with a warped anti-de Sitter geometry AdS5. This
While our search focuses specifically on the Randall-Sundrum model as it allows us to investi-
gate the interplay of spin observables and cross sections in a theoretically self-consistent way, they
directly generalise to a Z case with chiral couplings to 3rd generation fermions.
7.4. The Model 141
explains fine-tuning inMPlanck/MWeak in terms of the localisation of the 4D graviton
near the "Planck" brane, z = rUV with a fundamental scale ofMPlanck and the Higgs
sector near the "TeV" brane, z = rTeV, with a fundamental scale of MWeak. Thanks
to the warped geometry we then expect MPlanck/MWeak  exp{k(rTeV  rUV)},
where k is the AdS curvature scale and rC = rTeV  rUV is the size of the extra
dimension. This is solved by krC  11 for the observed values of the Planck and
weak scales, and hence massively reduces the required fine-tuning.
If the SM fermions propagate in all five dimensions, we can additionally explain
the structure of the Standard Model Yukawa sector through localisation [23]. The
profile of the fermions wave function is determined by a localisation factor  which
exponentially peaks towards the Planck brane for  < 1/2 and towards the TeV
brane for  > 1/2 (this can be understood as mixing with CFT bound state in the
dual picture). To avoid electroweak constraints from Z  bLbL while reproducing
the correct Yukawa structure we will set tR > Q3L > other following [331]. In
general we will keep other < 1/2.
Setups with the right-handed top quark localised close to the TeV brane, a flat
third generation left-handed quark doublet profile, and the other fermions localised
close to the Planck brane are phenomenologically viable [331]. Thanks to tR living
on the TeV brane and (t, b)L being almost flat, the dominant decay mode of gKK
and GKK is to tRtR.
These are typical parameter choices that underpin the experimental analyses.
For the graviton, branching fractions to hh and VLV
L are also sizeable as the Higgs
and therefore also the longitudinal modes of the weak bosons are located on the TeV
brane, but strong constraints on the masses of both particles m(gKK) and m(GKK)
can be derived from top resonance searches [316,317].
Our model setup therefore follows ATLAS and CMS [316,317] but varies slightly
between the gluon and graviton signals. In general the gluon will always be easier to
discover due to much larger cross sections as it can be produced efficiently through
uu and dd annihilation, whereas graviton production is dominated by gluon fusion.
As such it does not make sense to compare identical parameter points and we focus
on choices which give a (relatively) narrow and a wide resonance for each signal
model.
For our graviton samples we use the model file from [332] and consider the above
extreme case where tR is localised on the TeV brane (i.e. being fully composite),
Q3L is very close to flat, and the decay widths of the lightest KK graviton resonance

right-handed tops are therefore dominant at  70% and offer good prospects for
detection, however, both ZZ [333] and WW searches offer additional information
[334, 335]. We consider two values of c = {1, 2} which correspond to widths of
G1/mG1 = {6.2%, 25%}. While c = 2 is in the upper end of the range where
we can trust our assumption that higher curvature terms can be neglected in our
calculations [333] this is a useful point to consider in order to have a wide, fully
polarised resonance as one of our benchmark points. Note that our model setup
has mG1  1.5mg1 which would put our chosen mass points in tension with current
constraints onmg1 , however our intention is to show the value of adding polarisation
information to searches and G1 is a useful example of a source of a fully polarised
resonance: searches for g1 will in general always be more sensitive due to the more
efficient production mechanism.
For our gluon sample, generated with the model file introduced in [336], we
soften the localisation requirement and set Q3L  0.4 and vary tR  {0.3, 0}
which corresponds to effective couplings of gg1bLbL = gg1tL tL = gS , and gg1tR tR =
{2, 6}gS . These give widths of g1/mg1 = {6.2%, 37.5%} and branching ratios to
tt = {78.5%, 96.5%}. While always dominated by right-handed tops, the fraction
of right-handed to left-handed tops also changes which should be reflected in the
polarisation observables.
7.4.1 Event Generation and Analysis
Our background is leading order semi- and di-leptonic tt samples generated using
MadGraph 5 [128, 239] and reweighted to the NNLO cross section given in [337
339]. We focus on
s = 14 TeV collisions. Our signal samples are also generated
with MadGraph using the UFO model format [240] to import models implemented
in the FeynRules [127] language. These parton level samples are then showered
in Herwig 7.0.3 [264, 340] and analysed using the Rivet framework [137] which

we also use for applying smearing and efficiencies to the physics objects according
to typical ATLAS Run II resolutions (where available, with Run I resolutions used
otherwise) [341343] at the beginning of the analysis routine.
7.5 Analyses
7.5.1 Semi-leptonic study
7.5.1.1 Analysis Selections and Reconstruction
The analysis of the semi-leptonic samples focuses on reducing non-tt backgrounds
and reconstructing the individual tops, largely following the boosted approach de-
tailed in [316]. We start by finding electrons with pT > 25 GeV for || < 2.47
and muons with pT > 25 GeV with || < 2.7. We then cluster narrow anti-kT [63]
R = 0.4 jets with pT > 25 GeV inside || < 2.8 and fat Cambridge-Aachen [62,344]
R = 1.2 jets with pT > 250 GeV inside || < 2, and require at least one of each after
removing narrow jets which overlap with the leading fat jet.
Since we are interested in highly boosted tops, we have to accept some overlap
between the lepton and b-jet on the leptonic side so we do not require these to
be isolated and assume we can veto events with hard leptons from heavy flavour
decays inside QCD-produced jets. Following [346], we top-tag the leading fat jet
with HEPTopTagger [347, 348] mostly using the default setup of [348]. Note
our choice of R = 1.2 is well-motivated compared to the choice of R = 1.5 in the
benchmark study in [348] since we consider much heavier resonances. Our only
deviations from the default setup is that we require the candidate to have a mass
between 140 and 210 GeV and a pT > 250 GeV, since widening the mass windows
allows us to gain some statistics while still keeping non-tt backgrounds negligible
and our signal tops are so highly boosted that there is no loss in efficiency in a
slightly higher cut in pT . This provides our hadronic top candidate and we require
at least one of the narrow jets to be b-tagged with an efficiency of 70% and fake rate
of 1%, see for example [278].
Our narrow jets tend to be quite hard since we are interested in the high-mtt
region but we have checked that the leading narrow jet pT distribution peaks in the
range from 50 GeV to 300 GeV where the MV1 algorithm used by ATLAS outper-
forms this naive estimate [349] for our signal samples. To reflect the degradation of

300 GeV. We have checked that combining the pT -dependent b-tagging with contem-
porary top-tagging techniques renders the Wjj background negligible compared to
SM tt production at our signal mass points. We expect other SM backgrounds to be
negligible: we find lower signal Acceptance  Efficiencies than the 13 TeV ATLAS
study in [350] thanks to our stricter top-tagging which further suppresses all non-tt
backgrounds. The final sensitivity of our study could potentially be improved by
using a more permissive top-tagging algorithm and taking care to estimate non-tt
background contributions.
In the next step, we require missing transverse energy /pT with |/pT | > 20 GeV
and |/pT |+mT > 60 GeV where mT =
2pT,l|/pT |(1 cosl/p).
We reconstruct the leptonic W by assuming that its decay products are the
leading lepton and a neutrino, which accounts for all of the reconstructed missing
transverse momentum. The longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is
found by assuming the W is produced on-shell, and we choose between the two
resulting solutions by picking the one which minimises |mbl mt| after combining
with the leading b-tagged jet. This object is our leptonic top candidate.
We extract m(tt) by adding the found leptonic and hadronic top candidates and

the lepton and the tops direction of travel. The final m(tt) distribution is shown

7.5.2 Di-leptonic study
The semi-leptonic final state discussed in Sec. 7.5.1 is naively much more attractive
due to a six times larger branching fraction (since we are only considering elec-
trons and muons) and a less involved reconstruction of the individual top momenta.
Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to also consider the di-leptonic final state as it offers
two clean final state leptons which enable a comparably straightforward measure-
ment of spin correlations with increasing statistics.
When considering di-leptonic tt decays, however, we run into a qualitatively new
issue related to the reconstruction of the individual top momenta: with two neutrinos
in the final state, we will have to make an educated guess of how the single missing
transverse energy vector decomposes into the transverse components of the neutrinos
pT,/ before reconstructing the longitudinal momentum components. There are a
number of approaches that we outline in the following.
The first method is to simply solve the full system of kinematic equations by
assuming all intermediate particles are produced on-shell and that your measured
Note that there are studies [351] that aim to extract the polarisation information from boosted
hadronic tops but we do not attempt to do so here. We can expect the sensitivity of such a
measurement to be smaller than that of the leptonic side measurement.

that the polarisation of the tops from g1 decays differs between the two coupling
choices and this can be discerned in both analyses.
kinematic quantities are exact [352, 353]. This will in general provide up to eight
sets of solutions, one of which being close to the true momenta assuming that the
assumptions are valid. Using smeared kinematic quantities results in a larger mean
number of solutions which causes large combinatorial uncertainties. CMS have made
use of this approach together with a Matrix Element-method [354] to reduce the
number of solutions on the basis of the matrix element weight.
A second method is to use so-called neutrino weighting [355,356], which scans
over a large number of proposed neutrino solutions and constructs and assigns in-
dividual weights for each guess based on how well the solution solves the kinematic
equations. It is then possible to calculate observables for single events by either
selecting the solution with the highest weight, or adding up the values for all so-
lutions with correct weighting. This method is often used by ATLAS and has the
advantage of only relying on kinematic information.
A third method, which is the one we will adopt in this work, uses kinematic in-
sights from theMT2 [357] observable. The so-calledMT2 Assisted On Shell (MAOS)
method [358, 359] uses the solution for the transverse components of the two neu-

and subsequent improvements of the algorithm [361363] have made it possible to
find the solution efficiently. The solutions for the neutrino momenta k

approach the true solutions for MT2  m(t), with k/ = p/
 for MT2 = m(t)
with all kinematic quantities measured exactly and all intermediate particles on-
shell. Therefore this approach provides an approach to improve the quality of the
reconstruction if required by only using events with m(t) MT2 < C for some cut
C. For completeness we will discuss the MT2 calculation in more detail below.
7.5.2.1 Estimating invisible momenta with MT2
The transverse mass observable mT is used to measure the W mass in leptonic
decays. The relevant kinematics are presented in the left-hand diagram of Figure 7.4.
The crucial point here is that since we do not know the fractions of the proton
momenta the scattering partons carry in a proton-proton collision, we can not rely
on momentum conservation along the beam line. Using the momenta as defined in
this diagram, the transverse mass is given by:
In this very particular situation we should find k+ = k.

T  ~plT .~pT = (l + )
2,  = (ET , ~pT ) . (7.3)
Here weve introduced the  notation to denote the (2 + 1) dimensional momentum
which drops the component along the beam line. The transverse component of the
neutrino momentum can be calculated since we can assume (to a good approxima-
tion) momentum conservation in the transverse plane. Assuming no finite width
effects, this suggests mT  mW  and allows mW to be measured as the cutoff when
a large number of events have been recorded. Generalising this to the situation
with a parent particle P decaying to two daughters Y , which further decay semi-
invisibly, will allow us to define the MT2 observable. The kinematics are shown
in the right-hand diagram of Figure 7.4. Note we still can only measure the total
invisible transverse momentum /pT , and have to deal with this ambiguity in the in-
dividual invisible momenta somehow. We will assume that the masses of the two Y
particles are identical, and similarly that the masses of the two invisible momenta
p1/2 are identical. MT2 is then given by:
M2T2 = min
~p1,T+~p2,T=/pT
m2T (1, a),m
T (2, b)
. (7.4)
The ambiguity in the individual invisible momenta is here dealt with by minimis-
ing over all possible values, keeping the sum equal to the observable /pT . Performing
this min max using a naive, numerical approach is very computationally expensive
and error-prone as there can be several local minima and a max distribution does
not have a smooth first derivative. There is a more clever method thanks to Cheng
& Han [360]: assuming the invisible momenta are single particles with the same
mass mi, we have:
p21 = p
2 = m
i , (p
1/2 + p
2 = 2Y , p

The two are equivalent if the rapidity of the lepton and neutrino are the same.

where we have used that we expect MT2 to be invariant under boosts along the z-
direction to set pza to 0. The same can be done on the other side to find an expression
for E2 in terms of the momenta on the other side. A physical momentum must have
p21  0, which can be rewritten as:
(pz1)
2 = E21  (px1)2  (p
2 m2i  0 . (7.7)
Combining Equations 7.6 and 7.7 we see that the physical solutions in the px1 , p
plane are given by an ellipse 1. Doing the same thing on the other side of the decay,
and remembering that px/y1 +p
2 = /p
x/y, we can express the requirement that both
invisible momenta are physical as two ellipses 1,2 in the px1 , p
1plane, with the
size set by 2Y . M
T2 is then given by the value of 
Y which uniquely determines
1  2. Therefore, by definition, this solution also provides unique values for
which can be used together with an on-shell assumption for Y to fully
reconstruct the invisible momenta, modulo a four-time combinatoric uncertainty in
the longitudinal components.
As mentioned above, assuming all momenta are exact and all particles are on-
shell, the solution for the neutrino momenta given by this method will be exact
when 2Y = m
7.5.2.2 Analysis Selections and Reconstruction
We begin the analysis by finding electrons with pT > 25 GeV inside || < 2.47 and
muons with pT > 25 GeV inside || < 2.7. We then find anti-kT R = 0.4 jets with
pT > 25 GeV with || < 2.8. Again we have to accept some overlap between the
leptons and jets due to the large top boost, so we do not require these to be isolated
and again assume we can separate very hard prompt leptons from a nearby jet. We
then b-tag the jets within || < 2.5 with 70% efficiency and a 1% fake rate (10%
for pT > 300 GeV with the comments regarding this choice made in Section 7.5.1.1
also valid here), and require at least two b-tags. We also require missing transverse
energy /pT with |/pT | > 60 GeV.
While the high boost of our tops means that we can usually correctly pair b-
jets to leptons by taking the ones closest to each other in    space, we make
Determining whether two ellipses overlap is non-trivial: a general solution using the roots of
the characteristic polynomials calculated using Sturm-Habicht sequences [364] was first presented
in [363], and an algorithm making use of this solution was only recently implemented in the MT2
context [362].
Chapter 7. Constraining resonances in the tt spectrum using
polarisation information
use of some standard approaches to further reduce the combinatorial uncertainty.
Due to the large boost we consider, we do not gain much from cutting on M ttT (0),
which is often considered in the literature [365368], where M ttT (0) is defined as the
transverse mass of the entire tt system when m = 0:
M ttT (0)
= m2vis + 2
|pT |2 +m2vis|/pT |+ pT  /pT
. (7.8)
We therefore select the candidate which minimises at least two out of three test
variables: T2, T3, and T4 defined in [367]. These correspond to how well the solution
corresponding to each pairing reconstruct the W and top masses and the expected
MT2 distribution. If either of the pairings returns complex solutions for the neutrino
momenta we automatically select the other one. Once we have selected a pairing we
veto the event if MT2 > m(t) or mbl >
m(t)2 m(W )2. We find that vetoing
the entire event if neither pairing results in a viable-seeming solution suppresses
the WWjj background with little signal efficiency loss. We do not use mbl for
determining the correct pairing (referred to as the T1 test variable in [367]) since
this would make the total number of test variables even and it correlates strongly
with T2.
As discussed above we reconstruct the individual neutrinos using the MAOS
method. We take the solution for the transverse momenta of the neutrinos which
gives the correct MT2, and solve the remaining kinematic constraints to give two
solutions for the longitudinal component of each neutrino. This results in four final
solutions for the complete kinematics of the event with equal weights. This technique
has been used for example in phenomenological studies of production angle mea-
surements in [358] and top polarisation measurements in [369]. Despite the fourfold
combinatorial uncertainty which introduces a large smearing of the final m(tt) dis-
tribution as shown in Fig 7.1(b), it reproduces truth-level angular observables well
as this only affects the longitudinal neutrino momenta. The cos l distribution in
Figure 7.3(b) shows this in practice and confirms the final distributions are closer to
their true shapes than in the semi-leptonic analysis. Unlike in the semi-leptonic case
in Section 7.5.1.1 we can extract the lepton angle from both tops by again boosting
to the individual rest frames and taking the angle of their decay lepton to the top
direction of travel.
Ignoring smearing, finite width effects, and O(mb) corrections to mbl these correspond to
unphysical solutions.

7.6 Discussion of Results
7.6.1 Signal vs Background discrimination
We estimate the limits that can be set on the signal strength  = /expected for
our model setups with them(tt) and combinedm(tt) - l distributions by using the
CLs method as outlined in Section 3.3: for each of the 2D-binned distributions (ex-
amples of which are shown in Figures 7.5,7.6) we calculate the Poissonian likelihood
ratio bin-by-bin. To avoid spurious exclusions we do not use bins which have no
background events  this has a negligible effect as we have ensured there is sufficient
statistics in all bins which are expected to contribute to the exclusion limit for our
signal models.
When calculating limits we use a flat Gaussian systematic of 5% on the total
cross section of the background and only statistical uncertainties for the signal. To
propagate the systematic uncertainty to individual bins we assume the fractional
systematic error is the same in all bins, and calculate the correct uncertainty which
would lead to the stated uncertainty on the total cross section when adding up all the
Note this use of  differs from that in from Chapter 2. For the rest of this chapter  will refer
to the signal strength.
We can expect that data-driven methods, that use the low m(tt) spectrum to extrapolate to
our signal region become well-controlled with large data sets.

uncertainties and propagating these in a consistent manner always requires us to
make an assumption of how this is to be done which introduces a large effect on the
final limit on . In order to provide an estimate of the importance of the systematic
uncertainty on our limits we also present a comparison to limits calculated with no
systematic uncertainties in Figures 7.7 and 7.8.
7.6.2 Improvement from top polarisation observables
Before we comment on the shape information gain from including polarisation-
sensitive observables let us quickly investigate the expected phenomenology in the
model we consider. As can be seen from Figure 7.1, the reconstruction smears out the
resonance so the signal appears very wide for all signal models in the semi-leptonic
and di-leptonic analysis. For relatively narrow resonances our reconstruction of the
semi-leptonic channel yields a better performance, however, for the wider parame-
ter points the mtt distribution quickly loses its peak-like features. In such a case,
setting limits by using m(tt) as a single discriminant effectively means constraining
a continuum excess.
Considering directly-inferred angular quantities like (l+l) from, for example,

the di-lepton final state offers limited shape information. This is in particular true
when we would like to discriminate between different signal hypothesis once an
excess has been discovered. The reason for the lack of information in (l+l) is
the large considered mass range of the tt resonance, which leads to back-to-back
tops and leptons as a consequence.
7.7. Conclusions 155
It is exactly the boost to the top rest frame which lifts this degeneracy. And
since the signal produces highly polarised tops, we see a large modification of these
lepton angle distributions, which provides the additional shape information (Fig-
ure 7.3) which we can use to tighten the estimated constraint on  when combined
with m(tt), Figures 7.5 and 7.6 (we also show the distribution of the expected SM
background which exhibits no particular resonant features in the m(tt)  cos l
plane). Note that the polarisation of the tops from g1 decays differs between the
two coupling choices and this is visible in both channels. The apparent difference
in the difference in polarisation between the two coupling choices can be traced to
the non-linear nature of the transfer functions from the truth distribution to the
reconstructed distribution in the two cases.
Using the m(tt) cos l correlation as the baseline of the limit setting outlined
above we obtain a large improvement by a factor up to  3 on the limit on  with
increasing luminosity compared to m(tt) alone in Figure 7.9(b) for the ideal case of
the di-leptonic analysis of a wide highly polarised resonance, as the large statistics
available with 100 fb1 provide an efficient sampling of the sensitivity unveiled in
Figures 7.6. This relative improvement reduces for smaller reconstructed widths
that can be reached in the semi-leptonic channel as shape information is gained in
m(tt), yet an improvement at large luminosity by a factor of 
2 is still possible
for our benchmark narrow less-polarised gluon in Figure 7.7(a), which is the least
sensitive of our parameter points.
It is exactly the additional shape information from including polarisation infor-
mation which renders the analyses potentially sensitive  depending on systematics
 to broad gluon-like resonances at L  100 fb1 at our benchmark point. Discrim-
ination solely based on m(tt) flattens out and an analysis which focuses exclusively
on resonant-like enhancements will have less sensitivity by factors up to 3.
The improvement is not too sensitive on the precise mass scale around our chosen
benchmark, and becomes especially relevant at large widths as alluded to in the
beginning of this work, Figures 7.8, 7.9, 7.10.
7.7 Conclusions
Resonance searches in the tt final state are a well-motivated strategy for discover-
ing new physics beyond the Standard Model [316, 317]. While peaks in the mass
spectrum are very powerful indicators of the presence of such new physics, we also
Chapter 7. Constraining resonances in the tt spectrum using
polarisation information
often expect to see large modifications to other distributions and including this
shape information through multi-dimensional distributions often offers a good way
to improve sensitivity. Additionally, if the resonance becomes wide, invariant mass
distributions necessarily lose shape information. We have performed a detailed in-
vestigation of the semi-leptonic and di-leptonic tt final states for
s = 14 TeV and
provide quantitative estimates of the information gain from including top polarisa-
tion information in the limit setting. Our results demonstrate that this information
helps to ameliorate the loss of shape information in the invariant mass spectrum
for wider signal models. To make our analysis comparable to the practice of the
experiments we have focussed on the RS scenario as a particular candidate that
provides a theoretically well-defined framework for such a phenomenological situa-
tion. For the fully-polarised scenarios we study in this work we find improvements
of factors of up to 3 (2) on the limit of the signal strength for the di-(semi)-leptonic
analysis at large luminosity, with larger improvements for wider signal models as
expected. For our benchmark choice of 3 TeV resonances, including this information
is crucial to exclude certain KK gluon resonances at 95%. Interestingly the larger
improvement for the di-leptonic analysis allows this channel to become competitive
with semi-leptonic one for resonance searches for these types of models, however we
would like to note that this statement heavily depends on the systematics modelling
and only a dedicated experimental analysis can fully assess the relative sensitivities.
While these improvements are specific to our parameter choices at face value,
similar relative improvements can be expected for other, non-graviton or gluon res-
onances (not limited to RS models) that predict a net polarisation of the top pair.
Polarisation information is therefore an important ingredient to a more comprehen-
sive analysis strategy that builds upon the invariant top pair mass, using additional
shape information through multivariate approaches.
Chapter 8
Conclusions
In this thesis we have discussed the Standard Model of particle physics, its ap-
plication and relevance to high energy hadron colliders, and some open questions
that we hope can be answered by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.
In particular we have focused on searches for microscopic models for dark matter,
and methods for revealing the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking using the
structure of the Higgs sector.
Chapter 2 reviewed the Standard Model and the calculational tools used to ob-
tain the results in Chapters 5 and 6. In particular the Higgs sector of the Standard
Model, the application of perturbative unitarity arguments for constraining parame-
ters, and the calculation of renormalisation group equations were reviewed in detail.
Chapter 3 focused in part on the Hierarchy problem of the Higgs sector in the Stan-
dard Model, and its connection to the question of what the underlying nature of
electroweak symmetry breaking is. The second part focused on dark matter and
in particular on how to connect quantum field theory dark matter models to the
macroscopic observations which motivate them. To remain self-contained the Boltz-
mann equation which underlies the thermal freezeout mechanism for generating the
relic density used in Chapter 4 was reviewed in detail, and the statistical framework
employed throughout the thesis was similarly introduced.
In Chapter 4 we showed how to facilitate scans of the full parameter space
of a Simplified Dark Matter Model, and demonstrated that this allows for a more
meaningful comparison between collider constraints and the relic density to be made.
This motivates the interpretation of future results using our method, especially if
searches continue to return null results and we require a more complete picture of
the status of the full parameter space of a model in order to target searches better.
In Chapter 5 we considered the phenomenology of a strongly interacting dark sector
at the Large Hadron Collider and future hadron colliders, and calculated the size of
the leading logarithmic quantum corrections to dark matter production which could
be used to disentangle the internal structure of a dark sector after a hypothetical
158 Chapter 8. Conclusions
discovery. While such effects are hard to disentangle at the Large Hadron Collider,
we show that our results could be used at a future 100 TeV Collider if a scalar
mediator connected to a dark sector is discovered in the Large Hadron Collider
energy range.
In Chapter 6 we presented a detailed study of hhjj production, both through
gluon fusion using the full leading order result and weak boson fusion, and showed
that the weak boson fusion channel is uniquely sensitive to modifications of the
quartic V V hh vertices from their Standard Model expectation. However the gluon
fusion component remains sizeable even if we apply strict selections towards the
weak boson fusion component, necessitating our detailed simulation. We further
considered CP violation in the Higgs sector and again found that the weak boson
fusion channel of hhjj production is highly sensitive to an operator which appears
generically in effective expansions of CP violating Two Higgs Doublet Models, but
is insensitive to perturbative unitarity arguments and other production channels.
Other leading CP violating effective operators are strongly constrained by pertur-
bative unitarity arguments, as the absence of new resonant physics in the Large
Hadron Collider energy range pushes the necessary completion to the TeV scale.
Finally, in Chapter 7 we investigated the use of shape information from top po-
larisation observables in searches for resonances decaying to top pairs. It was shown
that including this information can greatly improve the statistical sensitivity of the
searches towards signal models which predict polarised tops in both the di-leptonic
and semi-leptonic final states. This was demonstrated with a well-motivated bench-
mark Randall-Sundrum model. Looking forward, as the Large Hadron Collider col-
lects more data we can expect machine learning algorithms to become widespread
in order to fully exploit shape information in observables towards signal and back-
ground discrimination, and a robust understanding of the underlying physics will be
crucial both to guide the experiments towards interesting observables, and to avoid
spurious discoveries and exclusions. Our study provides an example of an observable
which is decorrelated from the hard kinematics underlying the resonant decay but
still carries robust information about the underlying signal model. In the future it
would be interesting to study such effects in a more systematic way.

the dense core or bulge in our calculations, but for R > 3 kpc it

whereas left side corresponds to increasingly short-length fluctua-
tions. The blue line is a CDM fit which strongly favours cold or
warm dark matter with bottom-up structure formation, as hot dark
matter would result in a cutoff in the short-length correlations due
to the top-down structure formation it predicts. . . . . . . . . . . . 65

propagator with the replacement OSM  k2(k2)/M in the imag-
inary part of the self-energy (red) for various values of OS/M . The
normalisation is arbitrary and differs between the plots to allow for a
straightforward shape comparison, and both axes are linear. M = 500
GeV and m = 100 GeV which corresponds to a typical parameter
space point. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76
4.2 Our results using interpolation inMmg gq space. The dashed
white line shows where OS/M = 0.05. The black dots are interpo-

4.4 Ratio of the results using interpolation in M  m space and the
narrow width cross section approximation detailed in the text to using
a full interpolation in M  m  g  gq space. The cross section
approximation is conservative in the bright yellow (light) areas, and
overestimates the limit in the dark blue (dark) areas. The black dots
are interpolation knots in M m space. Note the ratio takes values
higher than 1.2 in some parts of parameter space but the colourbar
is restricted since the approximations are conservative there. See the
text for further details. Note gDM = g, mDM = m in our notation. 83

here be interpreted as the intended cutoff scale of the effective theory:
if Ci() is greater than the critical value, the effective theory is not
perturbatively unitary. In this sense the critical value can be seen as
a theoretical limit on the allowed contributions from these operators

the di-leptonic one smears out all of the signal models into something
resembling continuum excesses. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 144

7.3 cos l distributions for the SM tt and signal samples for the semi-
leptonic (a) and di-leptonic (b) analyses after all analysis selections
and detector effects, in both for m(tt) > 2 TeV. Since the signal pro-
duces right-handed tops we see a large modification of these lepton
angle distributions when compared to the SM expectation which at
these high invariant masses is slightly left-handed. Note that the po-
larisation of the tops from g1 decays differs between the two coupling
choices and this can be discerned in both analyses. . . . . . . . . . . 146
7.4 Kinematics for the mT calculation (left) and MT2 calculation (right).
The diagrams here should not be interpreted in the usual Feynman
diagram sense: a solid line final state momentum indicates it is visible,
and a dashed line final state momentum indicates it is invisible. Note
that these should not be interpreted as particles: on the right-hand
diagram pa denotes all of the visible particles from the bottom Y
decay, and p1 denotes all of the invisible particles from the same
decay. We can only hope to measure the total transverse component
of all of the invisible particles in the final state at a hadron collider. . 147

pected SM background (a) and a narrow (gtR = 2) g

information from the polarisation measurement. . . . . . . . . . . . . 151

pected SM background (a) and a narrow (c = 1) G1 (b) in the di-

our signal models from the perspective of gaining additional informa-

luminosities using m(tt) and cos l (black line) and only using m(tt)
