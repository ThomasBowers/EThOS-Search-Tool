Abstract
With the start of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we will obtain a
new understanding of the physics beyond our current limits. New discoveries will
be made; but we will require a deeper understanding, which the LHC machine,
being a hadron collider, will not be able to elucidate. Instead, we will need an
e+e collider to make precision measurements of the newly discovered phenomena.
Electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of fermion and boson masses are
fundamental issues in our understanding of particle physics. The essential piece
of electroweak symmetry breaking - the Higgs boson - will probably be discovered
at the LHC. If there are one, or more, Higgs boson(s) precise measurements of
all properties of the Higgs will be very important.
In this thesis I present two measurements of Standard Model Higgs boson
properties in the context of the International Linear Collider (ILC) at
s = 500
GeV, using the proposed International Linear Detector (ILD). First a performance
study of ILD to measure the branching ratios of the Higgs boson with mH = 120
GeV, where the Higgs boson is produced with a Z-boson via the Higgsstralung
process, and the Z decays into e+e or +. It will also be essential to study
the Higgs Yukawa coupling. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis, I present
a study of e+e  ttH with the aim of making a direct measurement of the
the top-Higgs coupling, using the semi-leptonic final state and mH of 120 GeV.
I show that the top-Higgs coupling can be measured with an accuracy of better
than 28%.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The most intriguing questions for a human being are: what are we made of?,
what is the origin of this Universe? and what will be its end? Physicists are
able to understand the answers to these questions in the evolution of the universe
from the Big Bang to its present appearance in terms of galaxies, stars, black
holes, chemical elements and biological systems: the key role is of elementary
particles and their interaction.
1.1 The Standard Model
We now know that there are four fundamental forces in nature: the strong,
electromagnetic, weak and gravitational forces. The electromagnetic and weak
interactions have been found to emerge from the unified electroweak interaction [1,
2, 3]. We have been able to formulate a quantum theory of elementary particles
based on the strong and electroweak interactions. These interactions arise
from the interchange of the massless photon for the electromagnetic interaction,
massive W and Z bosons for the weak interaction, and the massless gluon for the
strong interaction.
Our understanding indicates that all forces may be incorporated into a unified
framework [5]. But our picture of observed particles is incomplete. It needs
an important ingredient, related to the origin of mass and the breaking of the
symmetry governing the electroweak interaction. The favourite candidate for
this ingredient is the Higgs field, a scalar field that spreads out in all space.
Its field quanta is the Higgs particle. The Higgs boson is the last missing
1.2. Beyond the Standard Model
particle of the theory explaining the electroweak and the strong interactions:
the Standard Model (SM) [6]. The SM is a very successful theory which has
described phenomena of these interactions with high precision [8].
1.2 Beyond the Standard Model
If a Higgs boson is found with characteristics predicted by the SM, the SM cannot
yet be the ultimate theory. A particular shortcoming of the SM is its instability
against the huge hierarchy of vastly different scales relevant to particle physics.
The hierarchy problem can be stated as: Why is the Higgs boson so much lighter
than the Planck mass? The two known scales are the electroweak scale at a few
hundred GeV and the Planck scale at about 1019 GeV, where the strength of
gravity and the other interactions are predicted to become comparable [11]. The
experimental evidence shows that neutrinos have a very small mass, m < 0.28
eV, which points towards the physics beyond SM [12, 13]. We also know that
ordinary matter (quarks and leptons), makes up a small fraction of the matter
density of the Universe [12]. But the SM does not give any explanation for the
missing dark matter and dark energy.
A very attractive possibility for physics beyond the SM is supersymmetry
(SUSY) [16]. In SUSY, every SM particle has a superpartner which has spin
one half unit different. This stabilises the hierarchy between the electroweak and
Planck scales, if SUSY exits close to the TeV energy scale. Figure 1.1 shows the
corrections to the Higgs boson mass, mH , from a top quark loop. The presence
of superpartner of the top quark, the stop, reduces the size of the quantum
corrections as the fermionic and bosonic Higgs interactions automatically cancel,
thus solving the hierarchy problem.
Supersymmetric theories allow the unification of the strong, electromagnetic
and weak interactions at a scale of about 1016 GeV, as shown in figure 1.2. The
possible scale of grand unification is the same as the one at which neutrinos gain
mass [14].
The discovery of new physics, such as SUSY, can be studied at experiments
with colliding beams. These experiments will play a crucial role in the
understanding of the physics beyond SM. The discovery of new particles needs
two things: the highest possible energy and the highest possible precision of

quadratically divergent, leading to corrections proportional to |t|2 2UV , where t
is the top quark - Higgs boson Yukawa coupling and UV is Planck scale. Bottom:
Feynman diagram for stop corrections (t) to the Higgs boson mass. This leads to
corrections proportional to t 2UV where t is the stop coupling to the Higgs.
These two corrections cancel if |t|2 = t.

1.3. Complementarity of LHC and ILC
the measurements. These two requirements cannot be obtained with one single
collider. Therefore we need both a hadron collider to make new discoveries and a
lepton collider to make the precision measurements of the physics discovered at
the hadron collider.
Advances in accelerator technology has made possible the next generation
of hadron and lepton colliders. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN
is currently running and will be able to discover new particles [17]. The
International Linear Collider (ILC) is proposed as the next lepton collider [25].
1.3 Complementarity of LHC and ILC
In the next few years, data from the CERNs Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will
have a direct look at the TeV physics. No one knows what will be found at the
LHC, but the discovery potential of the LHC experiments is well studied [17,
18, 19, 20]. For all of the outcomes from LHC, a future linear collider such
as the International Linear Collider (ILC) will be essential to move forward on
our understanding of Higgs boson physics [15]. The ILC is designed to collide
electrons and positrons with a maximum center-of-mass energy of
s = 500 GeV,
with a possible upgrade to 1 TeV. The discoveries at LHC and ILC will hopefully
explain the breaking of electroweak symmetry and thus the origin of the masses
of particles, and then it is most likely that we will be able to find the physics
which is responsible for stabilising the hierarchy problem, so the unification of all
forces.
This thesis is concerned with the search for the SM Higgs boson. The
measurements at ILC of the Higgs boson branching ratios and the top quark
- Higgs boson Yukawa coupling are the main analyses of this thesis. An overview
of the Standard Model and the Higgs mechanism is reproduced in chapter 2.
Chapter 3 contains a description of the ILC and its proposed detector concepts.
Simulation and reconstruction tools used in this thesis are provided in chapter 4.
The Higgs branching ratio and top Higgs Yukawa coupling analyses are presented
in chapters 5 and 6, respectively. The work described in this thesis is summarised
in chapter 7 and an outlook is given.

Theoretical Motivation
The Standard Model of particle physics is the result of the immense experimental
and inspired theoretical effort, spanning more than fifty years. The beauty and
basic simplicity of the theory lies in explaining the fundamental constituents that
made up the Universe and their interactions with one another. However, one
aspect of the theory is unconfirmed, that is how the fundamental constituents
acquire their masses. This chapter gives an introduction to the Standard Model
and the Higgs mechanism which allow particles to acquire a mass within the
theory [21, 22].
2.1 The Standard Model
The Standard Model explains what the world is made of and what holds it
together. It is a simple and comprehensive theory that explains the hundred
of particles and complex interactions with only 6 quarks: bottom (b), charm (c),
top (t), strange (s), up (u) and down (d), 6 leptons: electron (e), muon () tau
() and their neutrinos (e, ,  ), force carrier particles: photon (), gluon and
W and Z bosons and one Higgs boson (H) as shown in Table 2.1 and figure 2.1.
The quarks and leptons are spin 1
fermions but distinct on the basis of their
interactions: quarks carry one of three colour charges associated with the strong
interaction whereas leptons do not. Table 2.1 shows the fermions arranged in three
generations of progressively more massive doublets. There exists an anti-particle
for each particle with identical mass but opposite additive quantum numbers.
The first generation is the only constituent of ordinary matter. Second and
2.2. The Gauge Principle
Figure 2.1: Recipe for the Standard Model.
third generation particles are created at high energy, for example in particle
accelerators. Once these particles are created, they decay quickly into the first
generation particles.
The Standard Model describes three types of interaction out of four that are
present in the Universe: the electromagnetic interaction, weak and the strong
interactions, as shown in Table 2.2. The massless photon, massive W and
Z0 bosons and eight massless gluons are the mediating particles for the three
interactions respectively. The Standard Model gives precise values for the allowed
couplings amongst the fermions and bosons. The gravitational force is too weak
to have any significant effect at the level of these forces.
2.2 The Gauge Principle
In the Standard Model the strong and electroweak interactions are implemented
as gauge theories, which are spontaneously broken via the Higgs mecha-
nism [24][6]. A gauge theory requires an invariance of the system under a set
of local transformations. Noethers theorem provides an important result related
to the invariance of the theory under some transformations, that there exist one
or more conserved quantities associated to these transformations [31].

2.2. The Gauge Principle
Gauge Principle for the Electromagnetic Force
In electromagnetism, the existence and some of the properties of the gauge
field - the photon - follow from the principle of invariance under local gauge
transformations of the U(1) group. Let us consider the Dirac free particle
Lagrangian, L, for a particle of mass, m:
L =  (i m). (2.1)
Where  is the fermionic spinor field,  = 0, and  are the Dirac matrices.
Equation 2.1 is not invariant under the local gauge transformation,    =
exp(i(x)), where (x) depends on the space-time coordinate, x. However, if
we introduce the gauge field A through the minimal coupling D   + ieA
thus requiring A  A = A + 1e(x), the resulting Lagrangian is:
L =  (i m) 
F 2 + e 
A (2.2)
where e is the coupling between the fermion and the photon (essentially the
electron charge) and F  A  A. F and L are now invariant under
the local gauge transformation. There is no allowed mass term for the photon
in the Lagrangian, therefore the photon is required to be massless. The effect of
imposing local gauge invariance gives an interacting system.
Gauge Principle for the Standard Model
The Standard Model is locally gauge invariant under SU(2)LU(1) SU(3) [1,
2, 3]. The strong force is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is
based on the SU(3) symmetry group with eight massless gluons corresponding
to the eight generators of the group. The SU(2)L and U(1) groups correspond
to the weak isospin and hypercharge respectively. The electroweak sector of
the theory requires four gauge bosons: a triplet (W 1,W 2,W 3) associated to the
generators of SU(2)L and a neutral field (B) related to U(1). As will be shown in
equations 2.12 - 2.14, the charged weak bosons appear as a linear combination of
W 1 and W 2, while the photon and a neutral weak boson Z0 are given by mixtures
of W 3 and B. The theory does not have mass terms for W and Z0. The idea of
spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2)LU(1) U(1) and Higgs mechanism
2.3. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Mechanism
is to give mass to the weak bosons as described in the next section.
2.3 Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the
Higgs Mechanism
Exact symmetries give rise, generally, to exact conservation laws. In this case
the Lagrangian and the vacuum are invariant under the gauge transformation.
There are some conservation laws which do not follow this rule. Quark Flavour is
one example. There is another situation when a system has Lagrangian invariant
but a vacuum is non-invariant. A classic example of the situation is provided by
a ferromagnet where the Lagrangian describing spin-spin interaction is invariant
under tridimensional rotations but the vacuum is non-invariant below a critical
temperature where the ferromagnetic phase occurs.
2.3.1 The Goldstone Mechanism
The Goldstone theorem examines the spontaneous breaking of a continuous global
symmetry which is not the symmetry of the vacuum [21, 32]. To explain the
Goldstone theorem let us consider a complex scalar field  = (1 + i2)/
2. The
Lagrangian density for the field  is:
L = m2 (2.3)
In this case, as  is independent of space and time, the only contribution to the
energy is m2. As m2 is positive so the minimum will occur when 1 = 2 = 0.
Thus  = 0 corresponds to the vacuum state. If the Lagrangian density is
slightly different by changing the sign in front of m2, the vacuum state is unstable.
Stability can be restored by introducing a term (1/2m220)(
)2 where 20 is a
real parameter. The Lagrangian can be written as:
L =  V () (2.4)
where:
V () =
[ 20]2 (2.5)
2.3. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Mechanism
Figure 2.2: Scalar potential for V (1, 2) (a) and its contour plot (b) taken
from [32].
The minimum field energy is now obtained with  constant independent of
space and time, but such that  = ||2 = 20. Such a field is not unique but is
defined by a point on the circle || = 0 in the state space (1, 2), so that the
number of possible vacuum states are infinite.
The Lagrangian density has a global U(1) symmetry:   = eix. As we
see from the contour plot in figure 2.2, the vacua are also invariant under this
global U(1) transformation: this transformation rotates the state round a circle
|| = constant in the state space (1, 2). If we pick out the particular direction
in (1, 2) space for which  is real and take the vacuum state to be (0, 0), we
break the U(1) symmetry.
Expanding  around this ground state (1, 0), we get a Lagrangian shifting
   (1
2)(+ i) + 0:
L = 1
+ 
  m
20+ 
2/2 + 2/2
(2.6)
where  and  are scalars. Here we can write L = Lfree + Lint, where the
Lfree contains all the terms which are quadratic in the fields and Lint has all
contributions from the interaction terms. This is the Goldstone theorem which
states that when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken, the theory contains
one massless scalar particle for each broken generator of the original symmetry.
2.3. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Mechanism
2.3.2 Higgs Mechanism
The Goldstone theorem implies the existence of a massless scalar particle but
this particle is never seen experimentally. The Higgs Mechanism provides a way
out by giving mass to the gauge boson. This is accomplished by constructing a
Lagrangian density which is invariant under a local U(1) gauge transformation:
   = eiq, where  = (x) is space time dependent. Consequently, we
introduce a massless gauge field A. The Lagrangian density is:
(  iqA)
[( + iqA)] 1
  V () (2.7)
with V as defined in equation 2.5 and F as defined above. L is invariant under
the local gauge transformation:
(x) (x) = eiq(x) A(x) A(x) = A(x) + (x). (2.8)
A minimum field energy is obtained when the fields A vanish and  is
constant, defined by the point on the circle || = 0. Any gauge transformation
on this field is also a minimum. There are an infinite number of vacuum
states. We can always choose (x) so that (x) is real for a given (x).
Consequently, symmetry is broken as we are no longer free to make further gauge
transformations.
Expanding (x) around 0(x), we get Lagrangian:
(  iqA)(0 + h(x)/
( + iqA)(0 + h(x)/
  m
[ 20]2 (2.9)
where we have made the substitution (x) = 0 + h(x)/
2, where h(x) is a real
function.
Separating Lagrangian again into free and interaction parts: L = Lfree+Lint:
Lfree =
h 
hm2h2  1
 + q220AA
, (2.10)
Lint = q2AA
20h+
20h+
(2.11)
2.3. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Mechanism
Before symmetry breaking, we had , a complex scalar field and a massless
vector field with two polarisation states. After breaking the symmetry, Lfree
has one single scalar field corresponding to a spinless boson with mass
and a vector field A corresponding to a vector boson of mass
2q0 with three
polarisation states.
Therefore we can interpret this as the Higgs field h(x), resulting in a physical
scalar boson particle with the mass
2m. In the case of the electroweak
Lagrangian, the SU(2) group has three generators which correspond to the gauge
bosons (W 1 ,W
) and a coupling denoted by g. The U(1) group has one
boson and a coupling g. The relative strength of these interactions is determined
according to g = g tan W , where W is defined to be the weak mixing angle.
The linear combination of gauge fields give the physical mediators:
W  (W 1  iW 2/
2) (2.12)
Z  cos WW 3  sin WB (2.13)
A  cos WB  sin WW 3 (2.14)
of which only Z and W acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism.
In order to break the SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry we extend  to be doublet
of complex fields, providing four extra degrees of freedom:
1 + i2
3 + i4
(2.15)
During spontaneous symmetry breaking, three of the extra degree of freedom are
given to the W and Z bosons allowing them to become massive and the other
corresponds, as before, to a massive scalar Higgs boson. The photon remains
massless as the electroweak Lagrangian remains invariant under local Abelian
transformation.
2.3.3 Higgs Boson Coupling to Fermions
The Lagrangian does not have an explicit term for the fermions mass as in the
weak interaction helicity +1
(right-handed) and helicity 1
(left-handed) are
treated separately. However, there is one possibility in which left and right handed
fermions interact with each other and Higgs field, . These interactions are known
2.4. Higgs Boson Mass Constraints
as Yukawa interactions and gives terms in Lagrangian:
LY ukawa = g(LR + RL) (2.16)
where g is the coupling constant of the interaction.
The Yukawa coupling for electrons in unitary gauge is:
ge = g
(2.17)
We can see that the coupling is proportional to the electron mass. In a similar
way the quarks also acquire mass and coupling which is proportional to their
masses. Hence, each of the quark and charged lepton has its unique coupling
defined by its mass.
gfHf =
(2.18)
where v = (
2GF )
1/2  246 GeV.
The Yukawa couplings are free parameters of the Standard Model and they
are determined to a certain accuracy from the measured fermion masses. Both
analysis in this thesis investigate the coupling of Higgs boson with quarks.
Analysis in chapter 5 probes the branching fraction of Higgs boson to bb, cc
and gluons. Second analysis of this thesis is focused on studying how well the top
Higgs Yukawa coupling can be measured at a specific detector model of a linear
collider.
2.4 Higgs Boson Mass Constraints
The Higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons are related to the masses of
these particles and the only free parameter of the model is the mass of the Higgs
boson itself; there are, however, both experimental and theoretical constraints on
this fundamental parameter.
Experimental bounds The available direct information on the Higgs mass
(MH) is the lower limit MH & 114.4 GeV established at LEP [27]

accuracy of the electroweak data measured at LEP, SLC and Tevatron provides

results on Higgs searches - as a function of the Higgs boson mass, MH . Right:

an indirect sensitivity to MH : the Higgs boson contributes logarithmically, 
log(MH/MW ), to the radiative corrections to the W/Z boson propagators. A
recent analysis, which uses the updated value of the top quark mass [28] yields
the value 8525 GeV, with upper limit of MH . 165 GeV. Direct searches by
CDF and D0 exclude a region at high mass between 156 < MH < 177 GeV [29].
The left-hand side of figure 2.3 shows the standard fit to the electroweak
data. The solid (dashed) line gives the results when including (ignoring)
theoretical errors. If the Higgs boson turns out to be significantly heavier than
200 GeV, there should be an additional new ingredient that is relevant at the
Electroweak symmetry breaking scale which should be observed at the next round
of experiments.
Theoretical bounds From the theoretical side, interesting constraints can be
derived from assumptions on the energy range within which the SM is valid
before perturbation theory breaks down and new phenomena would emerge. For
instance, if the Higgs mass were larger than  1 TeV, the W and Z bosons
would interact very strongly with each other which would violate the unitarity
in their scattering at high energies. Imposing the unitarity requirement in the
high-energy scattering of gauge bosons leads to the bound MH . 700 GeV [23].
If the Higgs boson were too heavy, unitarity would be violated in these processes
at energies above
s & 1.2 TeV and new phenomena should appear to restore it.
2.5. Higgs Production and Decay
Figure 2.4: Theoretical upper and lower bounds on mass of Higgs, MH [42].
Requiring the SM to be extended to the GUT scale and including the effects of
top quark loops on the running coupling, the Higgs boson mass should lie in the
range 130 GeV. MH . 180 GeV; see figure 2.4.
In fact in any model beyond the SM in which the theory is required to be
weakly interacting up to the GUT or Planck scales the Higgs boson should be
lighter than MH . 200 GeV. Such a Higgs particle can be produced at the ILC
already for the center of mass energies of
s  300 GeV. However, to cover the
entire Higgs mass range in the SM, MH . 700 GeV, center of mass energies close
s = 1 TeV would be required.
2.5 Higgs Production and Decay
In the SM, the profile of the Higgs particle is uniquely determined once its mass
MH is fixed [23, 42]. The decay width, the branching ratios and the production
cross sections are given by the strength of the Yukawa couplings to fermions
(figure 2.5 and gauge bosons, the scale of which is set by the masses of these
particles.

is a phase space factor accounting for the velocity of the fermion in the center-of-mass
system. The branching factors are modified by higher-order QCD and electroweak cor-
rections.
The decay width to the pair of vector bosons is given by:
(HV V ) = V
m3H(1 xV +
x2V )V , (2.37)
1 V = Z;
2 V = W ;
(2.38)
Figure 2.5: Couplings of the Higgs boson to the fermions as a function of their
masses. The error bars show the uncertainty in the quark mass measurement.
The trilinear and quartic Higgs self-couplings are also uniquely fixed in terms of
the Higgs boson mass, for example trilinear coupling is:
gHHH =
(2.20)
The Standard Model Higgs boson decays are dominated by the heaviest,
kinematically accessible particles. Thus of mH  135 GeV, the largest branching
ratio is H  bb.
2.5.1 Decay Channels
Low Mass Higgs
In the low Higgs mass range, MH . 140 GeV, the Higgs boson decays into
a large variety of channels. As shown in figure 2.7 the main decay mode is the
decay into bb pairs with branching ratio of O(80%), followed by the decays into
cc and + pairs with fractions of O(5%). Also of significance, the top-loop
mediated Higgs decays into gluons which for MH around 120 GeV occurs at the
2.5. Higgs Production and Decay
level of  O(6)%. The top and W -loop mediated  and Z decay modes are
very rare with the branching fractions being of O(103). However, these decays
are, together with H  gg, theoretically interesting being sensitive to new heavy
states such as SUSY particles.
High Mass Higgs
In the high Higgs mass range, MH & 140 GeV, the Higgs bosons decays mostly
into WW  and ZZ pairs, with one of the gauge bosons being virtual if energy
is below the threshold. Above the ZZ threshold, the Higgs boson decays almost
exclusively into these channels with a branching ratio of 2/3 for H  WW and
1/3 for H  ZZ decays. The opening of the tt channel for MH & 350 GeV does
not alter this pattern significantly as BR(MH  tt) does not exceed the level of
10-15% when kinematically accessible. In the low mass range, the Higgs boson is
very narrow  < 10 MeV, but the width becomes rapidly wider for masses larger
than 140 GeV, reaching   1 GeV at the ZZ threshold as shown in figure 2.6.
For large masses, MH & 500 GeV, the Higgs becomes very broad since its total
width is comparable to its mass, and it is hard to consider it as a resonance.
In our study of branching ratios, Higgs bosons were produced with MH of 120
GeV. At this mass, Higgs decays 68% into bb, 3% into cc and 6% into both +
and gg.
2.5.2 Higgs Production at Lepton Colliders
In this section the main production process of Higgs at the lepton collider such as
ILC are presented. First one is the Higgs-strahlung process including e+e  ZH
which is studied in this thesis for measurement of the Higgs branching ratio.
Second process is the associated production with top pair, as studied in this
thesis for the top Higgs Yukawa coupling. The production rates for all these
processes are shown in figure 2.8 at energies
s = 500 GeV as a function of MH .

Abstract
This review is devoted to the study of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking
and this first part focuses on the Higgs particle of the Standard Model. The funda-
mental properties of the Higgs boson are reviewed and its decay modes and production
mechanisms at hadron colliders and at future lepton colliders are described in detail.
The decay branching ratios of the Standard Model Higgs boson and its production cross sections in
the main channels at the LHC and at a 500 GeV e+e collider.

500 GeV [24].
Higgs-Strahlung mechanism
In e+e collisions, the main production mechanisms for the SM Higgs particle are
the Higgs-strahlung [42] and WW fusion [30] processes, as shown in figure 2.9:
e+e  ZH  ffH
e+e  eeH
where f are the fermion decay products of the Z boson such as e,  etc.
The final state H is generated in both the fusion and Higgs-strahlung
processes. The cross section for Higgs-strahlung scales as 1
and therefore
dominates at low energies, while the WW fusion mechanism rises like log s/M2H
and becomes more important at high energies. At
s  500 GeV, the two
processes have approximately the same cross sections, O (50 fb) for the interesting
Higgs mass range 115 GeV . MH . 200 GeV. For the planned ILC integrated
luminosity of  500 fb1, approximately 30,000 and 40,000 events can be collected
in, respectively, the e+e  ZH and e+e  H channels for MH  120 GeV.
This sample is more than enough to observe the Higgs particle at the ILC and to
study its properties in detail.

integrated luminosity of
L = 500 fb1, as expected for future machines. The cross section
scales as the inverse of the c.m. energy,  $ 1/s and, for moderate Higgs masses, it is larger
for smaller c.m. energies. The maximum value of the cross section for a given MH value is
s $ MZ +
2MH . An energy of the order of
s $ 800 GeV is needed to cover the
entire Higgs boson mass range allowed in the SM, MH <$ 700 GeV.

Figure 2.11: Feynman diagrams for Higgs production in association with tt pair.
Associated production with top quark pair
The associated production of a Higgs boson with a pair of top quarks [24] in the
SM has two Feynman diagrams as shown in figure 2.11. In one diagram the Higgs
boson is radiated off the tt pair, and the other diagram is where Z and Higgs
are produced in association with each other. The associated production with top
quarks has a small cross section at
s = 500 GeV due to phase space suppression
but, at
s = 800 GeV, it can reach the level of a few femtobarns. In figure 2.12
the dashed line shows cross section when the contributions are only from the
Higgs radiated off the top quark. The additional contributions from Higgs boson
emitted by the Z line are small for low
s as shown in the figure 2.12. The ttH
final state is generated almost exclusively through Higgs-strahlung off top quarks
in that case. The electroweak and QCD corrections are known and are moderate,
except near the production threshold where large coulombic corrections occur
and double the production rate.
Next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) QCD corrections are determined which
enhanced the tree level predictions by about a factor of two. These are important
for the determination of the top Yukawa coupling [24]. In the top Higgs Yukawa
coupling analysis presented here, the event generator, WIZHARD, makes use of
2.6. Problems of the Standard Model
Integrating over the fermion energies, with the boundary conditions similar to that given in
eq. (2.18), one obtains the total production cross section. In the case of e+e  ttH , it is
shown in Fig. 4.17 as a function of MH for three c.m. energy values
s = 0.5, 1 and 3 TeV.
Figure 4.17: The cross section for the associated production of the Higgs boson with tt pairs
in e+e collisions with c.m. energies
s = 0.5, 1 and 3.TeV. The dotted lines are when only
the contributions with the Higgs radiated o the top quark lines is taken into account.
While the cross section is in general small for the lowest c.m. energy
s = 500 GeV, it is
more important at
s = 1 TeV as a result of the larger available phasespace. For
s = 3
TeV, it becomes again smaller as it scales like 1/s. The cross section is at the level of a few to
a fraction of a femtobarn, depending on the Higgs mass and the c.m. energy and therefore,
this process requires highluminosities. The ttH final state in this associated production
mechanism is generated almost exclusively through Higgsstrahlung o top quarks. As
shown in Fig. 4.17, the additional contributions from Higgs bosons emitted by the Z line
are very small, amounting, for
s # 1 TeV, to only a few percent. In addition, since top
quark pair production in e+e collisions at high energy is known to be dominated by photon
exchange, the bulk of the cross section is generated by the e+e  "  ttH subprocess.
This process thus allows the determination of the important Yukawa coupling of the Higgs
boson to top quarks in an almost unambiguous way.
The radiative corrections
The QCD corrections to the process e+e  ttH , consist of the top vertex and selfenergy
corrections and the emission of an additional gluon in the final state, e+e  ttH + g. The
rather involved analytical expression of the cross section at NLO can be found in Refs. [522,
523]; see also Refs. [524, 525]. The corrections can be interpreted in an easy way and be
given analytically in two kinematical regimes [522].

the enhanced cross section of ttH due to these QCD corrections. The cross section
is increased from 0.32 fb to 0.58 fb for mt = 175 and mH = 120 GeV at
500 GeV [26].
2.6 Problems of the Standard Model
In spite of the successful experimental confirmation of the Standard Model (SM),
it does not give the full picture of nature [35]. It is rather a low energy effective
theory of a more fundamental one. There are certain experimental and theoretical
problems associated with the SM. The experimental evidence that neutrino has
mass is one conflicting issue of the SM. The hierarchy problem is one issue arising
in the theory as explained earlier in section 1.2. The SM leaves unexplained why
the strong and the electroweak gauge structure is SU(3)  SU(2)L  U(1) with
different gauge couplings and fermionic quantum numbers whose values are not
predicted to the model.
There are a lot of efforts in solving the above mentioned problems [35, 36].
2.7. Higgs Analysis at the International Linear Collider
Theories that lie beyond SM include various extensions of the SM through
introducing new symmetries such as Supersymmetry (SUSY) or Grand Unified
Theory (GUT). There are some entirely novel explanations also exist such as
extra dimensions and string theories.
2.7 Higgs Analysis at the International Linear
Collider
In this chapter, an overview of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard model,
constraints on the mass of Higgs, its different production and decay channels
has been reproduced. Certain problems which SM is unable to solve, have
been summarised. At last a brief introduction to the experimental high energy
physics has been given. Once the Higgs boson is found it will be of great
importance to explore all its fundamental properties. This can be done in great
detail in the clean environment of e+e linear colliders: the Higgs mass, its
spin and parity quantum numbers and its couplings to fermions, massive and
massless gauge bosons as well as its trilinear self-couplings can be measured
with very high accuracies. The measurements would allow to probe in all its
facets the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism in the SM and probe small
manifestations of new physics. In the following chapters, the Higgs-strahlung
channel, and the associated production of Higgs with top quark, at the ILC is
studied. The aim of the study is to measure the branching ratios of the Higgs
to fermions and to test the top Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson. In both
analysis, we have used the mass of Higgs equals to 120 GeV. At 120 GeV the
main decay mode of the Higgs is bb ( 68%). Other significant fermionic decay
channels are cc ( 3%) and + ( 6%). One of our study uses a center of mass
energy of 250 GeV and the other one uses 500 GeV.

3.1 Particle Physics Experiments
Particle Physics experiments are conducted using accelerators and colliders. The
high energy accelerator today has two kinds; one is synchrotron, where particles
follow a high energy constant radius in a time varying magnetic field. The other
one is a linear accelerator, where particles have linear motion. These accelerated
bunches of particles, called beam, are collided in a detector [40, 41].
Parameters which govern the performance of the accelerators are the center of
mass energy
s and the luminosity (L).
s is decided on the basis of what kind
of measurements are needed to be done. For example if search of new phenomena
is the goal, then as high as possible
s is tried to be achieved. Luminosity and
number of events produced are related with each other through:

where  is the cross section of a given process. Luminosity itself is dependent on
machine parameters:

point.
The detectors are placed at the collision points of the beams. Usually, they
obey cylindrical symmetry, with the z-axis defined to be the direction of the beam.
There are different subdetectors performing different purposes. A magnetic field
is necessary to measure the charge and the momentum of the particle. A general
overview of a detector and the purpose of various subdetectors is given below.
 Impact parameter of the trajectories of the charged particles with
respect to the reconstructed interaction point is measured in the innermost
subdetector. Hence help in the tagging of particles which live for relatively
long time.
 Momentum and charge measurement is performed in the next detector
layer. It is done by measuring the curvature of the trajectories of the
charged particles in the magnetic field.
 Particle Identification is determined by combining information of energy
loss per flight length and the momentum measurement.
 Energy measurement is done in the calorimeters. The two different kinds
of calorimeters; electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters (HAD)
are used to measure the deposited energy of electron, positron, photon and
heavier particles. Heavier particles deposit some of their energy in EM
calorimeter if they are charged.
 Muon Identification is the aim of the outermost detector layer. Muons
are the only interacting particles which are able to cross the calorimeters.
The ILC is a powerful engine in terms of its energy and luminosity, and as
such it poses difficult experimental environments. The kinematically accessible
range of center-of-mass energy, 0.5-1 TeV, allows new particle production, and
their properties can be studied in great detail. New particles can be discovered
even if their production cross sections are fairly low, and even if their decays are
complicated. The challenges for ILC arise due to the requirements as described
in the Reference Design Report, (RDR) [42]. The design of machine is motivated
by the desire to investigate the details of electroweak symmetry breaking. At the
ILC we know the initial momenta of particles so it allows the reconstruction of
the final states with high efficiency and resolution. The center-of-mass energy

is tuneable allowing for precise mass and quantum number measurements from
threshold scans. High-luminosity running at the Z-resonance and at the W+W
threshold, as well as ee, , and e collision modes, offer additional flexibility.
The jet energy resolution should be good to separate the hadronic decay of the
W and Z decays. Therefore, a big challenge for ILD is to require a jet energy
resolution of E/E  3 4% [50].
3.2 ILC Layout
The proposed layout of ILC will be given in the Technical Design Report to
be published in 2012 but efforts are being put to decide different parameters of
the accelerator [38] shown in figure 3.1. There are already some parameters for
3.2. ILC Layout

The parameters are shown for two different high-level radiofrequency schemes [47].
TESLA Linear Collider which are used as a baseline for the ILC [24] as given in
table 3.2.
There are a number of elements which provide collisions in a linear collider.
The central element of the ILC concept is the superconducting RF technology that
will be used to accelerate electrons and positrons in the main linac. The choice
of accelerating gradient is perhaps the single most important parameter decided,
since it determines the length of the machine and has significant cost implications.
Electrons and positrons are produced in a source and accelerated to a few GeV.
They are injected into a damping ring to reduce the phase space volume of the
bunches. During this process these bunches are cleaned and prepared to be used
in the main linac where they get the final energy. In the accelerator, the beam
delivery system is treated in such a way to condition the bunches for the collision,
collimates away tails and eventually focuses the bunches into the interaction
region. Beam is then ready to collide. After collision, there is a region behind the
interaction point, where beam is dumped and its energy is absorbed as shown in
figure 3.1.
The design of the ILC is based on superconducting cavities. An aggressive
peak accelerating gradient of 35 MV/m has been chosen which poses a formidable
3.2. ILC Layout
challenge to achieve this gradient in production cavities. A Japanese cavity now
demonstrated the accelerating gradients of 31.5 MV/ for the first time at a test
which took place at the Superconducting radio-frequency Test Facility (STF)
at KEK [48]. To reach the energy of 500 GeV about 10km of accelerator is
needed, based on an operating gradient of 31.5 MV/m for the baseline design.
The injection chain, the beam forming, and the beam delivery add another 5-
8 km per side, so that in the end the total site length will be about 33 km. If an
upgrade to 1 TeV will be done later on, an additional tunnel is needed which will
provide additional RF power to the beam.
The electron source is planned to be a conventional laser based electron source,
as has been used at the SLC and also at the Tesla Test facility [49]. This allows
high intensity production of polarised electrons, and is a very well understood
technology.
For the positrons, an alternative to the conventional source is an undulator
based source. A high energy electron beam - in principle the electron beam from
the main linac can be used for this - is used to produce a very intense photon
beam. These photons are then used to produce positrons. The advantage of this
source is that it can deliver larger currents for the positron linac, and that it has
the option of producing polarised positrons.
The damping rings are a major part of the overall ILC infrastructure. The
finalised scheme foresees two rings with a possibility of installing a third damping
ring. Each ring has a circumference of 3km at the start of the two linacs. The
length of the damping ring is less than the RDR value, 6km, due to a reduction
of the number of bunches per pulse by a factor of two from 2625 to 1312. This
scheme is currently under aggressive study and It would require a different and
untested technology for the kickers, not based on magnet technology but on
RF cavities itself. When inside the damping ring, the bunches are subjected to
wigglers which will help to reduce the vertical emittance of the bunches. For
electrons a one stage damping is deemed sufficient, for positron, two rings on top
of each other might be needed to provide enough damping.
The designed luminosity of the ILC is 2  1034cm2s1. The average bunch-
crossing rate will be 15  30 kHz and the interaction rate will be dominated by
 interactions ( 0.1 events per crossing). Because of such a low rate, there is
no need for a trigger, so the acceptance is maximised. Figure 3.2 shows the beam

Due to beam-beam interactions there is a high background. The high
charge density of the colliding beams produce intense emission of beamstrahlung
photons. These photons broaden the energy spectrum of the colliding beams
towards lower energies, with typically 8590% of the luminosity being produced
at energies higher than 95% of the nominal center-of-mass energy. The energy loss
due to beamstrahlung is roughly of the same size as initial state radiation. These
photons also give rise to secondary electrons and positrons in the interaction
region. By applying a high magnetic field these pairs can be confined inside
a cylinder of radius < 3 cm around the beam line. The signal-to-background
3.3. Detector Concepts for ILC
ratio is favourable at lepton collider compared to a hadron collider. With high
luminosity, many physics scenarios can be explored in a few years of operation.
The direct mass reach of ILC is limited by the available center-of-mass energy
to less than 1 TeV. But due to the clean environment, direct signals of particles
with low cross sections, or leaving only a very small amount of visible energy
in the detector, can be discovered. The measurements of known processes and
the detection of deviation from the expectations of the SM may lead to the
indirect discovery of New Physics. So the precision measurements at ILC are
the strongest aspect of the collider, allowing the exploration of quantum effects
and the possibility to extrapolate the observations to energy scales far above the
center-of-mass energy like Planck or GUT scale.
3.3 Detector Concepts for ILC
To extract full information from the physics potential of ILC, highly efficient
detectors are needed. There were initially four detectors designs developed.
SiD (Silicon Detector) [51], LDC (Large Detector Concept) [57], GLD (Global
Large Detector) [56] and the 4th Concept [58] with plans to choose two for the
final accelerator. The plan was to have these detectors at fixed positions but it
turned out to be too expensive. The current design has a single interaction point
with the detectors in a push/pull arrangement, so that the detector in use at
any particular time can be switched out quickly and the other detector moved
into the beam line. This should save considerable expense on beam delivery
components and the civil engineering required to dig the two detector caverns
and the connecting beam tunnels. This option presents a considerable practical
challenge to make the switching process quick and realignment reliable. Because
of their similarities the LDC and GLD collaborations decided to merge efforts
into developing a single detector, International Large Detector (ILD). Hence,
at the end only two detector study groups were validated by the ILC Research
Director following the recommendation of the International Detector Advisory
Group (IDAG) [44]. These detectors are:
 SiD (Silicon Detector) [51]
 ILD (International Large Detector) [50]
3.3. Detector Concepts for ILC
The concept of particle flow as a reconstruction method has driven many
detector designs [46]. Briefly, this involves reconstructing each particle in an
event individually by accurate calorimeter clustering. Charged tracks are then
matched to clusters in the calorimeter and all other clusters are reconstructed as
neutral particles. This requires a highly segmented calorimeter. Separating the
particles in the calorimeter is often more important than accurately measuring the
energy of individual particles, so the choice of using particle flow is fundamental
to a detectors design.
The physics studies in this thesis were performed using the ILD detector
model. But a brief description of the SiD detector concept is given in the next
section.
3.3.1 The SiD concept
The SiD concept as shown in figure 3.3 is designed to be sensitive to a wide
range of possible new phenomena at the ILC. A plan view of one quadrant of
the detector is shown in figure 3.4. SiD is based on silicon tracking silicon-
tungsten electromagnetic calorimetry, highly segmented hadronic calorimetry,
and a powerful silicon pixel vertex detector. SiD also incorporates a high field
solenoid (5T), iron flux return, and a muon identification system. The choice
of silicon detectors for tracking and vertexing ensures that SiD is robust with
respect to beam backgrounds or beam loss, provides charged particle momentum
resolution, and eliminates out of time tracks and backgrounds.
The SiD concept recognises the fundamental importance of calorimetry for
ILC physics, and adopts a strategy based on Particle Flow Calorimetry. This leads
naturally to the choice of a highly pixellated silicon-tungsten electromagnetic
calorimeter, and a multi-layered, highly segmented hadron calorimeter. Achieving
excellent jet energy resolution requires both the calorimeters to be located within
the solenoid, and cost considerations push the design to be as compact as possible,
with the minimum possible radius and length. The use of a high magnetic field
solenoid (5 Tesla) compensates for the reduced radius and improves the separation
of charged and neutral particles in the calorimeters. Given the high magnetic
field, an all-silicon tracker, with its good intrinsic resolution, can provide excellent
charged particle momentum resolution. The high magnetic field also constrains
e+e-pair backgrounds to a minimal radius, and so allows a beam-pipe of small

radius for high performance vertex detection. The SiD baseline detector has the
following components, moving from small to large radii:
 The vertex tracker has five barrel layers of pixel detectors augmented
with four endcap layers on each side, beginning at a radius of 1.4 cm
and extending to 6.1 cm. The endcap design ensures excellent pattern
recognition capability and impact parameter resolution over the full solid
angle.
 The main tracking system consists of five layers of silicon microstrip sensors
and four endcap layers, which tile low mass carbon fiber/rohrcell cylinders
and endcap planes. The sensors are single side Si, approximately 15 cm2,
with a pitch of 50 m. With an outer radius of 1.2 m and a 5 Tesla field, the
charged track momentum resolution will be better than (1/pT ) = 5105
GeV1 for high momentum tracks.
 SiD calorimetry is optimised for jet energy measurement, and is based on a
particle flow strategy, in which charged particle momenta are measured
3.3. Detector Concepts for ILC
Detector Overview
olution, and eliminates out of time tracks and backgrounds. The main tracking detector and
calorimeters are live only during a single bunch crossing, so beam-related backgrounds
and low mass backgrounds from 2-photon processes will be reduced to the minimum possible
levels. The SiD design has been cost-conscious from the beginning, and the present global de-
sign represents a careful balance between cost and physics performance. The SiD proponents
are convinced that two detectors are required scientifically, technically, and sociologically to
exploit fully the ILC physics potential. Therefore SiD is engineered to make the push pull
process efficient and to minimize the time required for alignment and calibration after a move.
Solenoid
Tracker
Figure 1.1: Illustration of a quadrant of SiD (dimensions in mm).
The key parameters of the SiD design starting point are listed in Table 1.1. The
innermost tracking sub-system is the Vertex Detector (VXD), which comprises 5 cylinders
and 4 sets of endcaps, composed of pixilated sensors closely surrounding the beampipe. The
impact parameter resolution will surpass r = rz= 5  10/(p sin3/2) [m]. SiD has
chosen a 5 T solenoidal field in part to control the e+e pair background, and the cylinder
and disk geometry is chosen to minimize scattering and ensure high performance in the
forward direction. The VXD sensor technology is not yet chosen because the relatively high
luminosity per train at the ILC makes integration through the train undesirable, and optimal
technologies for separating the train into small temporal segments, preferably bunches, have
not been determined. This is not a problem, since this choice will have almost no effect on
the rest of the SiD design, and the VXD can be built and installed after many of the main
detector components are complete.
SiD has chosen Si strip technology, arrayed in 5 cylinders and 4 endcaps for precision
tracking and momentum measurement. Particular attention has been given to fabricating

in the tracker; neutrals are measured in the calorimeter and then the
charged and neutral components are added. SiD calorimetry begins with
an exceptionally dense highly pixilated Silicon - Tungsten electromagnetic
section. The ECal has alternating layers of W and silicon pixel detectors;
there are 20 layers of 2.5 mm thick tungsten followed by 10 layers of 5 mm
tungsten. The silicon detector layers are only 1.25 mm thick. This results
in a Moliere radius for the thin section of 13.5 mm. The sensor are divided
into 1024 hexagonal pixels, forming an imaging calorimeter with a track
resolution of  1 mm. The same technology is used in the endcaps.
 The Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL) is made from 4.5 , ( is the interaction
length) of Stainless Steel, divided into 40 layers of steel and detector. The
baseline detectors are RPCs with 1 cm pixels inserted into 8 mm gaps
between the steel layers. The same technology is used for the endcaps.
 The calorimetric coverage is completed in the forward direction by a LumCal
and BeamCal. The LumCal overlaps the endcap ECAL. The LumCal is Si-

W, with the pixelation designed to optimise the luminosity measurement
precision. The BeamCal is the smallest angle calorimeter and is mounted
to the inboard side of QD0 shown in figure 3.4. The BeamCal sensor
technology may be diamond or low resistivity Si.
 The SiD 5 Tesla superconducting solenoid is based on the CMS design,
but has 6 layers of conductor. The stored energy is 1.6 GJ. The critical
cold mass parameters, such as stored energy/Kg, are similar to CMS. The
CMS conductor is the baseline choice, but SiD is developing an advanced
conductor that would eliminate the e-beam welding of structure alloy
and be easier to wind. SiD will carry all the solenoid utilities (power
supply, quenching protection, etc) except for the He liquefier, which will
be connected by a vacuum insulated flex line.
 The flux return and muon system begins at a radius of 3.33 m and extends
to 6.45 m. The flux is returned with an iron structure, configured as a barrel
with movable endcap. The present design limits field leakage to < 100 G
at 1 m. The flux return is 11 layers of 2cm iron. The flux return also is
the absorber for the muon identifier and is an important component of SiD
self shielding. The barrel is composed of full length modules to help keep
the structure stable during push and pull and to enable full length muon
detectors. The endcap support the final-focus QD0 magnets, with provision
for transverse alignment of the quads and vibration isolation. A platform
fixed to the barrel supports the 2K cryogenic system for the QD0s.
The details of the current status of the SiD concepts is given in reference [51].
3.3.2 The ILD Concept
The International Large Detector (ILD) is a concept for a detector at the ILC. ILD
has been conceived to use the particle flow method, and so has finely segmented
calorimetry as a major design goal. Tracking is achieved primarily with the silicon
pixel vertex detector and a large gaseous tracker, but with extra silicon detectors
in regions of low coverage. A 3.5 T magnet using similar technology to that of the
CMS detector provides the magnetic field [52, 53]. Figure 3.5 shows the detector
concept and Figure 3.6 shows a quadrant of the detector.

Performance Requirements

An iron yoke, instrumented with scintillator strips or RPCs, returns the magnetic flux
of the solenoid, and at the same time, serves as a muon filter, muon detector and tail
catcher.
A sophisticated data acquisition (DAQ) system which operates without an external
trigger, to maximise the physics sensitivity.
Precision physics at the ILC requires that the beam parameters are known with great
accuracy. The beam energy and the beam polarization will be measured in small dedicated
experiments, which are shared by the two detectors present in the interaction region. These
detectors will only be covered briefly in this document, more details may be found in a
dedicated document. The luminosity of the interaction will be measured by the luminometers
integrated in ILD. To enable the operation of the detector in a push-pul scenario, the
complete detector is mounted on a movable platform, which can move sideways out of the
beam to make space for the second detector in the interaction region. The platform ensures
that the integrity and calibration of the detector is minimally disturbed during the moving
process, making the re-commissioning of the detector after the push-pull operation easier.
The ILD detector concept is shown graphically in Figure 1.2-1.
1.3 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
The requirements and resulting challenges for detectors at the ILC are described in the ILC
RDR [4]. The ILC is designed to investigate in detail the mechanism of the electroweak
symmetry breaking, and to search for and study new physics at energy scales up to 1TeV. In
addition, the collider will provide a wealth of information on Standard Model (SM) physics,
for example top physics, heavy flavour physics, and physics of the Z and W bosons. The
requirements for a detector are, therefore, that multi-jet final states, typical for many physics
channels, can be reconstructed with high accuracy. The jet energy resolution should be suf-
ficiently good that the hadronic decays of the W and Z can be separated. This translates

Moving outwards radially is the vertex detector (VXD), intermediate silicon
tracker (SIT), the time projection chamber (TPC), the electromagnetic calorime-
ter (ECAL), the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) and the magnet return yoke. There
is an additional silicon tracking layer between the TPC and the ECAL called the

In the forward direction are the forward tracking discs (FTD), endcap
tracking discs (ETD), luminosity calorimeters (LCAL and LHCAL) and the beam
calorimeter (BEAMCAL). These forward calorimeter improve the hermeticity and
provide additional functions. The LCAL will use small angle Bhabha scattering
to measure the luminosity, and the BEAMCAL will analyse electron-positron
beamsstrahlung pairs to provide feedback to the beam delivery system.
3.3. Detector Concepts for ILC
The inner tracking system is shown in Figure 3.7. Each of the three main
tracking systems, VXD, FTD and TPC, have been designed to be capable of
stand alone tracking. The VXD is a three double layer design carried forward from
GLD because it had the best impact parameter resolution. The FTD is a series
of 7 discs that cover the forward direction down to approximately 10. Forward
coverage by the VXD extends to 15, although at this angle the obliqueness of
tracks reduces precision.

The electromagnetic calorimeter is made from layers of tungsten absorber and
silicon detectors with a cell size of 5  5 mm2. The physics studies presented
in this thesis are performed with a hadronic calorimeter using scintillators,
although gaseous detectors are under active research. In both cases the hadronic
calorimeter uses stainless steel as an absorber. These choices of calorimeter
technology are not intended as an indication of the final technology; the most
advanced technology was simply chosen for the first stage of physics simulations.
3.4. Technologies for ILD subdetectors

3.4.1 The Vertex Detector
Several designs and silicon pixel technologies are being considered for the vertex
detector. The choice of sensor is still very much in question, with the competing
designs being challenged with producing a working ladder by approximately 2012.
Details of different technologies are available from [45]. SiD and 4th have been
pursuing a design with short barrels and endcaps, whereas LDC and GLD (and
hence ILD) have been looking at long barrel designs [43]. Although the long
barrel designs suffer from reduced forward sensitivity due to the obliqueness from
the interaction point, a short barrel and endcaps provides a significant challenge
for readout electronics placement.
It is widely accepted that a critical parameter for the performance of the vertex
detector is the radius of the innermost layer. In essence, this is determined by
the radius of the beam pipe, although hits from background electron-positron
pairs could force this layer further out. How much the inner layer is affected by
backgrounds depends on the integration time of the technology used - technologies
with a large integration time will have to be placed further from the beam pipe or
the occupation from backgrounds will be over whelming. The integration times of
current proposals range from a single bunch to the entire bunch train and having
to move the inner layer out from the beam pipe is a very real possibility.
The sensor choice will make a huge impact on the rest of the design. Each
of the ten or so technologies being investigated have their own advantages and
disadvantages, so it is not simply a case of picking the sensor with the shortest
integration time. Power consumption needs to be kept to a minimum to prevent
heat build up, and the readout electronics required will have to be factored into
the mechanical design. The material budget excludes the option of liquid cooling,
so all of the technologies will have to prove that gas cooling is sufficient to keep
them at their operating temperature. The sensor itself will have to be very thin,
both to minimise material and also the weight and hence the support required
to hold it in place. An ILC vertex detector should be able to pin point the
interaction point to less than a m in x and y, a very ambitious goal, so keeping
each sensitive layer stable to less than this is imperative. An additional problem
is that all of the technologies minimise heat build up by power cycling during

the very forward region. This geometry may however be less efficient in reconstructing long
lived B mesons decaying outside of the beam pipe. It is also technically more challenging
because of the additional difficulty to realise double ladders as compared to single ones. It
may however be robust against mechanical distortions resulting from power pulsing the sen-
sors inside the solenoid field. The two VTX geometries are displayed on figure 4.1-1. Some

The complete VTX-SL ladder thickness is equivalent to 0.11 % X0, while the double
ladders of VTX-DL represent 0.16 % X0. These values assume 50 m thin silicon pixel
sensors. The length of the innermost ladder (125 mm) is limited due to the radial expansion
of the pair background envelope as it diverges from the IP. It would shrink significantly when
considering the so-called low-P option of the machine parameter. In this case, the innermost
ladders should be shortened to < 100 mm and/or the inner radius should be increased in

bunch train gaps, so Lorentz forces from the detectors 3-4 T field during the
high current power up will have to be accounted for. A high power sensor will
therefore require more support than a similar low power option.
3.4.2 The Time Projection Chamber
Time Projection Chambers are the technology that have been in use for over
25 years, and have proven to be accurate and reliable [54, 55]. They provide
an accurate 3 dimensional path for charged particles with a minimal amount
of material in their path. The tracking requirements at the ILC however will
require a significant increase in performance. The desired momentum resolution
is (1/pT )  9  105 GeV/c [42], which will require the development of a
number of technological improvements to the standard TPC design. A time
projection chamber works by having a large volume of gas, which ionises when
the charged particles under study pass through it. A large cathode in the center
of the detector causes the ionised electrons to drift towards the endcaps, which
are held at ground potential. If the ionisation electrons happen to deviate from
a path perpendicular to the beam axis, the large magnetic field from the main

magnet will cause them to travel in small radius, helical trajectory so that they
reach the anode in approximately the same position in x and y that they were
ionised in. Measurement of this position for all ionised electrons hence gives x and
y coordinates of the particle under study all along its path through the gaseous
volume. If accurate knowledge of electron travel through the gas is combined
with knowledge of the time from ionisation to detection at the anode then a
z coordinate can also be inferred, hence the time projection. The time of
ionisation needs to be taken from an external source.
Traditionally, the anode consisted of several wires at known positions; when
a signal was detected on one of these wires one of the spatial coordinates of the
ionised electrons was known, the anode itself was also the detector. A process
of natural amplification occurs in the gas - as the electrons approach an anode
wire, the electric field gradient increases and the electrons are accelerated. As
they do so, they can knock additional electrons from the gas atoms which are
also accelerated and ionise more atoms. This cascade, known as a Townsend
avalanche, increases the signal.
One of the new technologies under consideration for improved performance
is the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). This is a thin piece of dielectric coated
on both sides with metal. Tiny holes of no more than 100 m are drilled in the
sheet, so that when a high potential is applied between each side the electric
field is concentrated through the holes. Any electrons approaching the sheet are
accelerated through the holes, and the field gradient is high enough to create a
very localised avalanche that can be detected just the other side of the sheet.
Another candidate is Micromegas (MICROMEsh GAseous Structure) detec-
tors [59]. These involve holding a fine wire mesh a short distance (typically 0.1
mm) above a plane of detector pads. The mesh is held at a voltage of order 400 V
so that avalanches are caused in the region between the detector plane and the
mesh.
3.4.3 Calorimetry
ILD has been pursuing the particle flow approach, whereby the energy of
charged particles is taken from the tracking, and the energy of neutrals from
the calorimeters. This requires very high spatial resolution for the calorimetry, so
that tracks can be matched to the charged particle clusters (which are effectively
3.4. Technologies for ILD subdetectors
ignored) to distinguish them from clusters created by neutral particles. A mistake
in the matching process will either result in missing energy, if a neutral cluster is
thought to be associated to a track and hence ignored; or more likely in double
counting if the energy of a charged particle is taken from its track, and its
calorimeter energy wrongly assumed to be from a neutral particle.
The calorimeter system is comprised of two parts: the electromagnetic and
hadronic part, which are installed within the coil to minimise the inactive material
in front of the calorimeters.
Electromagnetic calorimetry
Electromagnetic calorimeters are designed to measure the energy of particles that
are absorbed in an electromagnetic shower, i.e. either photons or electrons. High
energy (above approximately 1 GeV) electrons primarily lose energy through
bremsstrahlung, emitting a high energy photon. High energy photons primarily
lose energy through pair production, creating an electron and positron pair. These
processes continue in turn until ionisation (for electron) or Compton scattering
(for photons) takes over as the main form of energy loss. It is the energy loss in
these processes that is actually measured by the calorimeter.THE ILD SUB-DETECTOR SYSTEMS

4.4.3.2 Optimisation
For the final detector, a global optimisation study of the longitudinal profile has to be per-
formed, by varying the thickness of the Silicon and Tungsten layers as a function of the depth,
in order to minimise cost, lateral spread and energy resolution.
The dependence of the ECAL energy resolution as a function of the longitudinal sampling
scheme has been studied in simulation [96]. For a given number of sampling layers, the energy
resolution improves if the first part of the calorimeter is more finely segmented than the latter
part. The effect of the silicon cell size on ECAL performance has been studied in simulation,
focusing on the photon reconstruction capability in di-jet events and hadronic  decays. Three
different cell-sizes (55 mm2, 1010 mm2 and 2020 mm2) have been investigated. In both
cases a specialised photon reconstruction algorithm (GARLIC [97]) has been applied. The
algorithm was separately tuned for each cell-size.
Figure 4.4-8 shows the mean ratio of calorimetric energy reconstructed as photons to the
true photon energy, in simulated di-jet events at ECM = 400GeV for a variety of cell sizes. A
cell-size of 55 mm2 is clearly to reconstruct the correct fraction of photon energy inside jets.
The interpretation of these result, which is based on a dedicated photon finding algorithm,
requires care. It can not be applied directly to full particle flow reconstruction, which in
general shows a weaker dependence.
Studies of  reconstruction have been performed in ZH (H  ) events at ECM =
230 GeV with mH = 120 GeV. The three decay modes   ,    and   a1
have been considered. The reconstructed invariant mass of the visible  decay products is
shown in Fig. 4.4-9 for the three different cell sizes. A simple selection based on particle flow
(reconstructed photons) and jet mass (cut at 200 MeV) allows one to reach good efficiency
and purity, without the need for the more sophisticated analysis. The efficiencies and purities
of the reconstruction of the various decay channels are given in Table 4.4-6. Again a cell size
of 5 5 mm2 is favoured although the performance loss with respect to 10 10 mm2 cells is
smaller than in high-energy jets.
To study the effect of material in front of the ECAL on the particle flow performance,
4 GeV single charged pion events have been simulated. The 0s produced in interactions
in the tracker region may give rise to additional reconstructed photons in the ECAL. The
GARLIC photon identification algorithm [97] has been applied to the single pion events.
For the approximately six percent of pions which interact in the tracking volume, Fig. 4.4-
10 shows the position of the pion interaction point inside the detector for events in which

The calorimeter thus has two roles: to induce bremsstrahlung and pair
production, and to measure ionisation. For low energies both roles can be fulfilled
by one material (homogeneous calorimeter), but at high energies the volume
3.4. Technologies for ILD subdetectors
required to contain the shower would be prohibitive. All ILD electromagnetic
calorimeter designs interweave layers of a material with a high radiation length
with the detector material. Since shower separation is the primary concern with
particle flow algorithms, tungsten will be used as the absorber to contain showers
laterally since it has a low Moliere radius. Lead is also being considered as a lower
cost option. Another goal to minimise lateral shower spread is to minimise the
thickness of the sensitive layers. Current designs are aiming for sensitive layers
3 mm thick, including readout. The tungsten absorber layers are between 2 and
3 mm thick at the face of the calorimeter, but then switch to approximately 4
mm thick in the middle of the detector.
Silicon pad diodes, monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) and scintillator
strips and tiles are all being considered for the sensor layers. MAPS is a
relatively new proposal. The technology choice for ILD is still in question, but
the scintillator option was used for the physics analyses in this thesis.
Hadronic Calorimetry
The same principle of interspersing a detector medium with a non-sensitive
material to induce the shower also applies to hadronic showers. Like EM showers,
hadronic showers are an inherently stochastic process, making accurate incident
particle energy measurements difficult. The stochastic nature means that the
error on the measured energy reduces as energy increases, as opposed to the
tracking which has reduced energy resolution for very straight tracks, i.e. for
high energy particles. Since any 0 particles produced will predominantly decay
to two photons, hadronic showers naturally have an element of electromagnetic
showers as well.
Hadronic showers extend much further than electromagnetic showers, so
hadronic calorimeters are naturally larger than electromagnetic calorimeters. The
size creates the most common deciding factor in the choice of absorber material
- such a high volume of detector requires a very low cost material. Stainless steel
was chosen for the analysis presented in this thesis, with the added advantage
of its mechanical qualities. Lead is also an option because it would have equal
response to the hadronic and electromagnetic components of the shower.
Both gaseous and scintillating detectors are being researched for the detector
layers. A gaseous detector layer would use either GEM, micromega or resistive
3.4. Technologies for ILD subdetectors
plate chambers (RPCs). A scintillating layer would use either scintillating tiles,
scintillating strips or a combination of the two to maximise granularity.
THE ILD SUB-DETECTOR SYSTEMS
FIGURE 4.4-15. Layout 1 of the HCAL (left), and view of the integrated ECAL and HCAL beam test
setup (right).
Presently the boundaries between modules are pointing in  and in z. Variants with
non-pointing boundaries have been validated in finite element calculations as well, but are
disfavoured to ease the mechanical construction. The pointing geometry does not degrade
the performance as long as the cracks are filled with absorber material, and if the active
instrumentation extends up to the boundary within tolerances, which is the case in the
present scintillator layer design.
4.4.4.1.3 Design 2 This design intends to reduce cracks both in  and  and to reduce
the distance between the barrel and the endcaps. The barrel part is made of 5 independent

of the ECAL barrel. A module is made of 48 stainless steel absorber plates (welded with 2
transverse 10mm stainless steel plates) with independent readout cassettes inserted between
the plates. They define the rigid structure on to which the corresponding ECAL modules are
mounted. A drawing of the structure is shown in figure 4.4-16(right). The absorber plates
consist of a total of 20 mm stainless steel: 16 mm absorber from the welded structure and
4 mm from the mechanical support of the detector layer.

3.4.4 Coil and Return Yoke
The ILD detector design requires a 3.5 T field in a large volume, with a high field
homogeneity within the TPC and with a reduced fringe field outside the detector.
The parameters of the ILD magnet are very similar to the CMS ones [52] and the
basic designs of both magnets are the same. An anti Dipole in Detector (DiD)
is also added in the design, which allows to compensate the effect of the crossing
angle for the outgoing beam (and pairs) after the interaction point.
Magnet Technology
As several technical aspects of the magnet are quite similar for the ILD and
CMS, the experience of CMS will help out for ILD [53]. The conductor will
consist of a superconducting cable co-extruded inside a low electrical resistivity
stabiliser and mechanically reinforced by adding high-strength aluminium alloy.
Two different conductors will be necessary, using different superconducting cables
and a different ratio of mechanical reinforcement, but with the same overall
dimensions. The winding will be done using an inner winding technique. The
magnetic forces will be contained both by the local reinforcement of the conductor

The barrel yoke has a dodecagonal shape. It is longitudinally split into three parts. In the

Three thicker iron plates of 560 mm each with 40 mm spaces for muon detectors form the
outer part of the barrel yoke. The weight of the barrel yoke is around 7000 t.
The end-cap yokes, also of dodecagonal shape, have a similar split structure, with 10 iron

and by an external cylinder. The coil will be indirectly cooled by saturated liquid
helium at 4.5 K, circulating in a thermosiphon mode. The central barrel yoke
ring will support the vacuum tank. Internal sub-detectors will be supported on
rails inside the vacuum tank.
3.4.5 Muon Detector
The identification of leptons is an important part of the physics programme at
the ILC. For muons above a few GeV, the instrumented iron return yoke is used
as a high efficiency muon identifier. There is no need to trigger on muon tracks
as is the case in hadron colliders. In the clean environment of ILC the linking of
track candidates from the inner detectors with tracks in the muon system will be
possible.
The system will be instrumented to allow a limited calorimeter performance
as well as muon tagging. This will improve the energy measurement by tagging
the late developing showers and hence act as a tail catcher.
A muon is easily identified by a track in a muon detector behind significant
material. In the ILD design, the muon system is reached by muons with a
momentum above about 3 GeV/c. The strong central magnetic field will keep
lower energy particles from reaching the muon system. The main challenge then
for identifying muons is the joining of a signal in the calorimeter with a track
segment outside the coil. Multiple scattering in the calorimeters and the coil
will have large impact on this, and the efficiency of association will increase with
momentum. At lower momenta, the signal in the calorimeter will be used to
identify muons.

Event Generation and
Reconstruction Techniques
The two analyses presented in this thesis use the same types of event samples. The
techniques used to simulate, reconstruct and analyse these samples are almost the
same for both of the analyses. In this chapter, the detector model is described
that is used for the analysis in the following chapters. Techniques which are
common to many physics analysis are also described in this chapter. Specifics of
the two analyses are discussed in the chapter 5 and 6.
4.1 Software Tools
The ILD concept uses the Linear Collider I/O (LCIO) persistency format and
event data model based software framework [63]. Mokka [63] is a GEANT4 [65]
based application, used for the detailed simulation of the detector response. A
MySQL [66] database is used to store the complete subdetector geometries and
component materials which then make up the detailed detector structure. At
reconstruction and analysis level, the geometrical properties are accessed by using
the GEAR package [68].
Marlin [66] is the reconstruction package which is used to process Mokka
generated events. Marlin is provided with plug-in modules, which are called
processors, and can be loaded at the run time. These processors can be configured
by steering files in xml format. The MarlinReco [62] package is used to carry
out the event reconstruction. There are sets of modules for digitisation, track

finding, track fitting, particle flow reconstruction, and flavour tagging in the
MarlinReco package. Tracks from standalone pattern recognition in the silicon
trackers and in the TPC are combined and refitted using a Kalman-fitter based
track reconstruction. Reconstruction of the individual particles in the event is
performed with the particle flow algorithm in the PandoraPFA package [70]. The
LCFIVertex package [61] employs code for vertex finding/fitting and uses a neural
network approach for the identification of heavy flavour jets and estimation of the
charge. The JetFinder algorithm within MarlinReco can be used to reconstruct as
many jets as required for the analysis. MarlinReco contains some other tools such
as the Reconstruction in abstract vertexing environments, RAVE toolkit [71] and
kinematic fitting. A schematic diagram of these softwares is given in figure 4.1.

1 Introduction
The International Linear Collider ILC is the next big project proposed by the high en-
ergy physics community. The detectors for this collider will be precision experiments
with highly granular calorimetry and excellent tracking capabilities. A software frame-
work has been developed to support the research and development needed to design and
optimize a detector concept for the ILC. The framework provides the basis for the devel-
opment of reconstruction and analysis software. While originally designed for studying
data from Monte Carlo simulation of the full detector response the framework has been
adapted to also be used in test beam experiments with small subdetector prototypes.
Using the same core software framework both in Monte Carlo studies and for analy-
sis of real data provides synergies for both worlds. The adaption of the framework to
test beam experiments has been carried out in the context of the EUDET[1] project
supported by the European Union in the 6th Framework Programme structuring the
European Research Area. Here we give an overview on the framework and report on
some of its applications.
2 Overview Core tools
A typical processing chain in any high energy physics software framework consists of
the following steps: Generation, Simulation, Digitization, Reconstruction and Analysis.
Fig. 1 shows a schematic overview of the software framework and the tools that are used
at the various steps.
Figure 1: Schematic overview of the software framework and the tools that are used at
the various levels of the processing chain.
The LCIO[3] persistency framework provides the data model that is used for the event
and conditions data throughout the processing chain. The full simulation of the de-
tector response is done in the geant4[4] based Mokka[7] application. Marlin[8] is an

4.1.1 The ILD Simulation Model
For the physics studies, a reference simulation model known as ILD 00 was
created in the Mokka simulation program. As far as possible generic expected
measurement performances are used instead of selecting a specific technology. As
4.1. Software Tools
an example, no readout technology is specified for the tracking systems, and the
expected resolution is applied to the hits during digitisation.
In most cases the sub detectors have been implemented with mechanical
support structures, electronics, cabling, and realistic dead material and cracks.
The three double layers of the Vertex Detector, VXD, were constructed as 50
m thick silicon ladders, and the Time Projection Chamber, TPC, had the inner
and outer field cages modelled. The Forward Tracking Discs, FTD, and Endcap
Tracking Discs, ETD, were modelled using discs, and the Silicon Tracker, SIT,
and SET, (silicon tracking layer between TPC and ECAL) were modelled using
cylinders.
The detector model ILD 00 was simulated with the parameters given in table

4.2. Particle Flow
4.2 Particle Flow
Particle Flow [69] reconstruction provides the best way to achieve the jet energy
goals for ILC. It poses certain requirements on the separation of photons and
showers produced by neutral and charged hadrons.
The jet energy resolution for a given detector design comes from a combination
of the detector performance and particle flow software. The unprecedented
resolution of the jet energy to be achieved is E/E = 30% of
1/E for a wide
range of jet energies at ILC [69]. If a cluster is not correctly assigned to a
track or a photon is not resolved from a charged hadron shower, then there is a
confusion [69] term which degrades the jet energy resolution. The particle flow
and calorimeter clustering are performed in ILCSoft package in a single algorithm
i.e. PANDORAPFA [70]. There are six steps involved:
Track Reconstruction The track reconstruction for ILD is performed mostly
on three subdetector VXD, FTD and the TPC separately. A magnetic field of
3.5T is provided outside the tracking system. For example to reconstruct an
Interaction point, IP, the track selection is done by requiring at least 20 hits in
the TPC or at least three hits in the FTD. There is no requirement on hits in the
vertex detector. If there are fewer hits in the TPC or FTD then at least three
hits in the vertex detector needed.
The track finding procedure is performed in the entire ILD detector by linking
track segments found by the SiliconTracking processor in the silicon detectors
and by the LEPTracking processor in the TPC. Each track is characterised
by five parameters:  (signed curvature), tan() where  is the dip angle, 
(azimuthal angle of point of closest approach), d0 (signed impact parameter), z0
(displacement along z axis at the point of closest approach to IP). Figure 4.2
shows these parameters.
Calorimeter Hit Selection Hits identified as isolated on the basis of nearness
to other hits, are removed from the initial cluster, and the left over hits are ordered
into pseudo-layers. The ordering is done with respect to decreasing energy. The
pseudo-layers correspond to the detector geometry in the way that pseudo-layers
are crossed by particles while going outward. The assignment of hits to the
pseudo-layers is carried out by using minimum information of the geometry of
4.2. Particle Flow
Chapter 4 - Reconstruction and Analysis Tools
Figure 4.1: The track parameters used are defined at the point of closest approach to
an arbitrary reference point (shown here as the origin). The magnetic field is in the z
direction, along the beam line, so the particle travels in a helix orientated in z. In all
parts of this thesis the reference point used is the interaction point.
4.2 Tracking
Tracking is performed using the Kalman filter track fitter and full pattern recognition
provided with MarlinReco[3]. Tracking is performed on the vertex detector and SIT
layers separately than from the TPC and also the FTD. The three sets of tracks are then
analysed and refitted to get the final track collection.
4.3 Particle Flow
In its simplest form, particle flow measures the energy of individual charged particles
from the tracking, and the energy of neutral particles from the calorimeters. The jet
energy is then the sum of the individual particles constituting the jet. Clusters in
the calorimeters are first matched to tracks, any clusters remaining are assumed to be

the detector. It uses the radius of the ECAL barrel, n-fold symmetry of the
barrel, the z coordinate of front face of ECAL endcaps and the  offset of the
barrel stave with respect to the x-axis.
Cluster Reconstruction Inside the calorimeters, hits are gathered using a
clustering algorithm. This algorithm works from the innermost to the outermost
pseudo-layer and a direction to the clusters is assigned in this ascending direction.
The initial direction of the cluster is the direction of the track. The hits are added
to the clusters in the outward direction. In each pseudo-layer, hits are compared
to the hits in the previous layer. The association of hits in different layers is made
using a cone-cut d < dtan() + Dpad with  being the cone half angle, Dpad
is the size of pixel in the layer being considered,  is the number of pixels added
to the radius of cone, d and d are the perpendicular and parallel displacement
vectors with respect to the propagation direction.
Cluster Merging After the tracking and clustering is performed, a merger of
clusters from tracks and hadronic showers takes place. Photons are identified
by using the cut-based method while the tracks and hadronic showers are
characterised by minimum ionising tracks, back scattering tracks and showers
including hadronic interactions before merger. Clusters which are identified as
photons are not considered for merger.
4.3. Jet Finding
Statistical Re-clustering If jets are highly energetic such that the jet energy
is greater than 50 GeV, the performance of the algorithm degrades due to
the overlap of hadronic showers of different particles. A re-cluster of energy
is performed by splitting clusters. This is achieved by temporarily assigning
calorimeter clusters to the tracks and performing the association procedure using
smaller values of  and .
Particle Flow Objects (PFOs) Once track and cluster information is
gathered, the PandoraPFA algorithm matches clusters to tracks, and performs
particle reconstruction. The matching is achieved on the basis of the distance of
closest approach of the track projection into the first ten layers of the calorimeter.
In particle flow, every constituent particle of the jet is reconstructed. The
identified PFOs are used to reconstruct jets, with jet energy as the sum of
the individual particles energy within the jet. To identify individual PFOs as
photons, electrons, muons, charged hadrons or neutral hadrons, the fraction of
energy deposited in the ECAL and track-cluster matching is used. When the PFO
is charged, tracking information is used to reconstruct the particles energy; when
the PFO is neutral then the calorimeter information must be used to reconstruct
the particles energy.
4.3 Jet Finding
The event processing grouphe reconstructed PFOs into jets, using the so-called
Durham (kT ) clustering algorithm [72]. It involves computation of the scaled
transverse momentum between two particles i.e.
ymn =
2(1 cos mn) min(E2n, E2m)
(4.1)
where (m,n) represents every pair of the final-state reconstructed particles with
energies En, Em and mutual angle, mn and s is the center-of-mass energy. The
two particles with the smallest values of ymn are then combined and if their ymn is
smaller than a pre-defined parameter ycut, they are replaced with a pseudoparticle
with 4-momentum pmn. The process of combining particles continues until a
specific required number of objects is left. It forces reconstructed particles into
the number of jets found.
4.4. Vertexing
4.4 Vertexing
The LCFIVertex package [67] provides tools for vertex finding, flavour tagging
and vertex charge reconstruction. In the next section a brief overview of these
tools is presented.
4.4.1 Vertex Finding
The LCFIVertex package provides the vertex finder ZVTOP originally developed
at the SLD experiment [73]. There are minor improvements in the currently used
version by including a Kalman vertex fit, and adjustments to use ZVTOP in
events at the center-of-mass energies above the Z resonance.
The ZVTOP provides two algorithms complementary with each other. In this
thesis ZVRES is used. The central idea of the ZVRES algorithm is to define the
probability density function fi(~r) describing each track i. The track function has
a Gaussian profile in the plane normal to the trajectory. The track function is
defined as:
fi(~r) = exp
(~r  ~p)V 1i (~r  ~p)T
(4.2)
where ~p is the point of closest approach of track i to space point ~r and Vi is the
position covariance matrix of the track. Then a vertex function, V (~r), is defined
that gives high values in the region of true vertices. The simplest V (~r) for a
collection of N tracks is:
V (~r) =
fi(~r)
i=1 f
i (~r)N
i=1 fi(~r)
(4.3)
with the second term ensures that V (~r) approaches zero in spatial regions in
which only one track contributes significantly.
Fake vertices can be suppressed by weighting the vertex function using the
knowledge of the vertices most likely position. Additionally, the IP position can
be used to suppress the fake vertices from tracks passing close by each other in
an area near the IP.
The other ZTOP vertex finder algorithm is ZVKIN. It works in the particular
situation when ZVRES fails. For example when a b jet decays into two particles
but only one charged track is detected. In the current thesis only ZVRES is used
4.4. Vertexing
as it applies to a broader class of jets. For more details of ZVKIN, reference [67]
can be consulted.
4.4.2 Neural Networks
A Neural Network (NN) is an information processing paradigm. It is composed
of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (nodes) working
in unison to solve specific problems. A NN is configured for a specific application,
such as pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process. As
an application to the high energy physics, NN achieves usually better results
than simple cuts. Basic elements of the NNs, nodes, can exchange information
between themselves through synapses. Nodes are grouped into three types of
layers: input, hidden and output.
The aim of a NN in a physics analysis is to separate the signal events from the
backgrounds. Given a certain number of discriminating variables, x1, x2, ..., xn,
the NN attempts to define a border between the signal region and the background
region. During the training of the NN, weights are assigned to each region. If it
is possible to find a set of discriminating variables which distinguish the signal
and the background regions in their multi-dimensional space, figure 4.3a, the
signal region is assigned large weights and the background region is allotted small
weights. Then the NN output will have a peak at one for signal events, figure 4.3b.
Figure 4.3: Signal and background separation in NN and its output. [79].
In the complex cases, where signal and background are not well distinguished
4.4. Vertexing
within the discriminators space, one might be tempted to perform more training
of the NN to improve the separation of the signal and background regions. This
may lead to overtraining. In the overtraining, the neural network starts to create
islands around concentrations of signal events, figure 4.4a. As in the islands
there are not many background events large weights are assigned to them during
the training, as well as low weights are assigned to the regions outside them.
When one runs then the NN on test samples (different from the training sample),
figure 4.4b, a significant fraction of signal events falls outside the islands (low
weights) and to them very small values of the NN output will be given. To those
events that fall inside the islands (large weights) the response from the NN should
be close to one. Thats a characteristic of overtraining of a NN: With a pure signal
sample the response from the NN show two peaks, one at 0 and the other one at
1, figure 4.4c.
Figure 4.4: Overtraining in the NN. [79].
4.4. Vertexing
4.4.3 Flavour Tagging
The LCFIVertex package determines the flavour of the jets based on a neural
network (NN). A network is trained on b decays, and another on c decays. Each
jet is examined according to the trained NN values to get probabilities of b and c
decays. A unique feature of this package is the distinction between IP and non-
IP vertices. There are different sets of observables for jets containing one vertex
and jets with more than one vertex. If only one vertex is found, then the most
significant track information such as the impact parameter and the momentum of
the track is used as input for the flavour tag. The most significant track is defined
as the track with the smallest absolute value of the impact parameter, d0/(d0),
as discussed below. The observables from the second-most significant track help
to discriminate between c and b jets, for which it is more likely that two tracks of
high impact parameter significance are found, with one resulting from the decay
of the leading hadron and one from the decay of the charmed hadron produced
in that decay. Further observables, as given below, can be studied to tag the
jets for the one vertex case. In practise different algorithms are used for one or
more than one vertices but using the same variables. The networks are trained
differently for one or more than one vertex. All of the networks used have 8 input
nodes/variables, a hidden layer of 14 nodes and one output node. The following
set of variables are used to distinguish the flavour of the jets.
Impact parameter significance
The impact parameter significance is the impact parameter divided by its error.
Heavy flavour hadrons travel a short distance before decaying, so tracks from these
decay products will tend to have larger impact parameters than tracks from light
hadrons. This parameter can have a negative or positive sign depending on the
intersection of the track with the jet axis in front (positive) or behind (negative)
the vertex. Heavy flavour tracks will have positive impact significance as negative
can only arise if the detector has imperfect resolution. Light flavour tracks should
have symmetric impact parameters. The significance of the impact parameter in
the xy plane is defined as d0/(d0), and as z0/(z0) in the z direction. In the one
vertex case the track significance is given by d0/(d0)1, and as z0/(z0)1 in the
z direction and similarly for the second-most significant track. The distributions
of d0 significance is given in figure 4.5 for a test sample.

Joint probability
The joint probability, J is the probability that all of the tracks come from the interaction
point. This is calculated by parametrising the impact parameter significance distribution
for light flavours by a function f(x). The probability that a track can have a significance

Joint Probability
The joint probability, J , is the probability that all of the tracks come from
the interaction point. The probability variables are calculated from the impact
parameter significance in the xy plane and z of all the tracks in the jet.
The significance distribution is given as f(x) and probability of a track with
significance x (not the spatial co-ordinate x) is:
Pi(x) =
f(x)dx
f(x)dx
(4.4)
where i is to identify each track. This information for each track is combined to
form the joint probability for the jet by:
J  P
log(i P i)m
(4.5)
The significance distribution is approximated by a Gaussian with two exponential
tails. Since the distribution for light flavours should be symmetric about zero,
the form of this function can be found by fitting just the negative side. Jxy is the
joint probability in the xy plane and Jz in z.
4.4. Vertexing
Track momentum
The momentum magnitude for the first and second most significant impact
parameter tracks are denoted by |p1| and |p2| respectively.
Decay length
The decay length is the distance from the interaction point to the furthest vertex.
This is defined as l.
Decay length significance
The decay length significance is the decay length divided by its error. This is
defined as l/(l).
pT corrected mass
This is the invariant mass of the vertex after applying a momentum correction
that would make the momentum vector point directly away from the interaction
point and transverse to the beam axis, denoted by MPT .
Vertex momentum
The vertex momentum pV , is the sum of the momenta of all tracks in the vertex.
Number of tracks in vertices
The number of tracks associated to any vertex that is not the interaction point,
NV . Figure 4.6 shows the distribution for a test sample.
Secondary vertex probability
This is the secondary vertex probability, PV2 , of the tracks assigned to the decay
chain, that is the 2 of a new track fit using all of these tracks.
4.4.4 Flavour Tagging Performance
The flavour tag uses the 8 variables presented in the previous section to train
three neural networks: one produces the b-tag, one produces the c-tag and the

Decay length and decay length significance
The decay length, l, is the three dimensional distance from the interaction point to,
generally, the furthest vertex found. The decay length significance, l
, is this distance
divided by its error. Strictly speaking, it is the vertex with the largest decay length
significance that is used in the flavour tag, although this is generally the furthest ver-
tex. Figures 5.15 and 5.16 show, respectively, the decay length and the decay length
significance for the test sample.
pT corrected mass
The pT corrected mass, MpT , is an estimate of the mass of the decaying particle. First
the uncorrected mass, MV tx, is calculated by summing the 4 momenta of the charged
decay daughters, assuming they are pions. That is, for each track a 4 momentum is
determined using the tracks 3 momentum and an energy calculated from the 3 momentum
and the pion mass, i.e. E =
M2pion + p
The pT correction comes in to attempt to account for neutrals in the mass calculation.
A correction is applied to the vertex momentum to make it point in a straight line away

third one is designed to tag c jets in the case that the main background is from
b jets. Each of the tag outputs has a value between 0 and 1. Figure 4.7 shows
the distribution of the b-tags and the c-tags for b, c and light flavour jets from
a MC sample of Z bosons decaying into two jets. Figure 4.8 shows the flavour
tag performance for the model ILD 00. Although in the ILD 00 model, vertex
detector was implemented as three double sided layers, a performance studies for
five single sided ladders vertex detector was also conducted by the Edinburgh
ILC group. The performance difference between the two geometries is small as
shown in figure 4.8. Therefore, any of the vertex detector model can be used for
ILD 00.
4.5 Summary
The requirement for precision measurements at the International Linear Collider
puts stringent requirements on the reconstruction software. The optimisation of
tools and techniques for the reconstruction needs to be excellent. This chapter
provides an overview of these tools and techniques. The analysis in the following
chapters are performed by using these techniques.
4.5. Summary

straightforward way of using the charm tag (i.e. c net output) in an analysis634
is to require one or more jets in an event to have a charm tag exceeding a635
certain cut value, chosen as appropriate for the specific analysis. Resulting636
performance on a jet-by-jet basis is discussed in Section 4.5. Event selection637
can be improved by using information from both the charm and the bottom638
tag. This can, for example, be achieved by plotting charm versus bottom tag,639

3.2 Subdetector technologies
3.2.1 The vertex detector
Several vertex detector designs and silicon pixel technologies are still being considered
for the vertex detector. The choice of sensor is still very much in question, with the
competing groups challenged with producing a working ladder by approximately 2012.
Details of the competing technologies are available from [22]. SiD and 4th have been
pursuing a design with short barrels and endcaps, whereas LDC and GLD (and hence
ILD) have been looking at long barrel designs[17]. Although the long barrel designs suffer
from reduced forward sensitivity due to the obliqueness from the interaction point, a
short barrel and endcaps provides a significant challenge for problems such as electronics
placement.

Chapter 5
Measurement of Higgs Boson
Branching Ratios
An analysis of the Higgs branching ratios using ZH  llH was prepared for
the ILD Letter of Intent (LoI) as a collaboration effort between Edinburgh and
Bristol Universities. The muon channel was studied in Edinburgh, while the
electron channel was studied by the Bristol collaborators [78]. The statistical
uncertainties on the Higgs branching ratios to bb, cc and gg are estimated, for an
integrated luminosity of 250 fb1 at
s = 250 GeV and a 120 GeV Higgs.
5.1 Monte Carlo Samples
The samples for this analysis were generated centrally at SLAC by the ILD
optimisation group in preparation for the Letter of Intent (LoI) [50]. WHIZARD
was used to generate these samples [80]. For simulation, the Mokka [63] package
was used which is GEANT4 based. The detector model was ILD 00. MarlinReco,
PandoraPFA and LCFIVertex packages were used for the reconstruction. Details
of these packages are given in chapter 4.
We used a Higgs with mass 120 GeV and a center of mass energy
250 GeV. The signal used is e+e  ZH, where the Z decays as Z  +
and the Higgs boson, H, was allowed to decay according to its Standard Model
branching ratios given in figure 2.7. The main background samples were generated
as e+e  +qq. Other considerable background, W+W, was also considered
for the study. Table 5.1 below shows the sample sizes used in the analysis.

5.1.1 Polarised Electron and Positron Beams
The full potential of the linear collider could be realised only with the polarised
electron and positron beams. For the ILC it is possible to get the polarised
beams without a significant loss in the luminosity. Having both beams polarised
would increase considerably signal rates and efficiently suppress unwanted
background processes. This increase in the signal/background ratio gives
additional opportunities for possible new discoveries. Studies have shown that
the combination of two polarised beams are indispensable for revealing the
structure of the new physics [74, 75, 76]. In the Higgs branching ratio analysis,
therefore, we have used samples of different polarisations to get an effective beam
polarisation of 80% for the e beam and 30% for the e+ beam. Table 5.1
gives unpolarised sample corresponding to the luminosity 292 fb1 while in
table 5.2, the number of events corresponds to the luminosity 250 fb1 with
beam polarisation, P (e+, e) = (+30%,80%).
5.2 Muon Identification
In our analysis we need a very efficient muon identification to reconstruct the
Z boson. The muons arising from the decay of the Z boson are isolated and
have large momenta. Single particle samples were generated and simulated
with Mokka for the detector model ILD 00. In MarlinReco, no digitisation
was implemented and therefore, there was no reconstruction of hits in muon
detector. We thus only use calorimeter and tracking information for muon

identification. We obtained the discriminating variables and used them to train
different methods implemented in the Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis Package
(TMVA). The TMVA provides a ROOT-integrated machine learning environment
for the processing and parallel evaluation of multivariate analyses. TMVA consists
of the multivariate methods such as likelihood estimation, Neural networks with
three implementations (MLP), boosted decision trees (BDT) etc. It provides
training, testing and performance evaluation algorithms and visualisation scripts.
TMVA supports the use of variable combinations and formulas [81].
Our signal was muons only and the background sample was pions and
electrons. We optimised the output of above mentioned multivariate methods,
by maximising S/
(S +B):
(S +B)
signal
(signal + background)
(5.1)
These muons are identified by using a set of variables which are used to train
the TMVA. These variables use the calorimeter and tracker information. Four
variables showed a high power of separation. These variables are:
 EEcal
 EHcal
 EEcal/(EEcal + EHcal)
 (EEcal + EHcal)/p
where EEcal and EHcal are the energies that the track leaves in the electromagnetic
and in the hadronic calorimeter, respectively and p is the momentum of the tracks.
Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of signal and background for these variables.
Based on the efficiencies of different multivariate methods, neural networks
MLP, was decided to be used to identify muons. If MLP has value > 0.2932, the
particle is identified as a muon. This cut value maximises S/
S +B as shown in
right figure 5.2. The distribution of purity verses efficiency for the TMVA output
is given in left figure 5.2.
In neural networks, sometime overtraining can arise, as explained in sec-
tion 4.4.2. We performed an overtraining check for our study and no overtraining
was observed after the optimisation cuts. The response of MLP for the
overtraining check is shown in right figure 5.2.

5.3. Initial-State Radiation
Figure 5.3: Overtraining check.
5.3 Initial-State Radiation
Initial-state radiation (ISR), as discussed in chapter 3, can be a considerable
source of degradation of beam energy. Most of the ISR photons have very low
transverse momentum and low energy, and fall outside the detector acceptance.
The ISR photons that reach the detector are very difficult to distinguish from
photons arising from bremsstrahlung of the final state particles. To select ISR
photons we used the PFOID algorithm in MarlinReco [82] with the following cuts:
energy of the photon E > 5 GeV, transverse momentum of the photon pT < 3
GeV and no other particle object within 10 around the photon direction. In a
sample of 5000 generated +H events, 95 ISR photon candidates were found,
of which 45 photons were matched with the generated ones.
5.4 Reconstruction of the Z boson
We reconstructed Z boson candidates by combining a pair of oppositely charged
tracks identified as muons. Neural Networks were used to identify the tracks
with momentum p > 20 GeV and no other track within an angle of 5 around the
track direction, as muons. If more than one candidate was found, the one with
the reconstructed mass closest to the Z boson nominal mass, MZ = 91.2 GeV,
was taken. We obtained 4284 +H and 50994 background events from the date
samples given in table 5.1. Figure 5.4 show the distributions of the reconstructed

1.3.4 Event pre-selection
To suppress the background contributions from the non-partonic higgs decay
modes, in particular the  lepton mode, and from processes with two or
four leptons in the final state, only events with 25 reconstructed particle
objects or more are accepted. Only events with one Z boson candidate with
mass 80 < MZ < 100 GeV and one reconstructed higgs boson candidate are
accepted, further reducing contributions from qq production.
After pre-selection the number of signal (background) events was 3327
(31123).

5.5 Jet Finding and Higgs boson Reconstruc-
Particles identified as muons and used to reconstruct Z bosons and the ISR
photons (if found) are removed from the full reconstructed particle collection.
Remaining particles are then forced into two jets using the Durham algorithm as
described in section (4.4). Each jet gets a momentum which is the sum of all of
the constituent particles. The two jets are combined into a Higgs candidate. The
di-jet mass distribution is shown in Figure 5.5. Figure 5.4 and 5.5 attempts to
reconstruct the mass of the Higgs candidate. It is noticed that the recoil mass
distribution gives a better reconstruction of the Higgs mass as it involves initial

parameter such as the center-of-mass energy,
s, which is well defined for the
ILC. The other variables, mass and energy of the di-muon system, are also well
reconstructed. On the other hand, limitation on the jet energy resolution restricts
the reconstruction of di-jet mass, Mjj.

The cut on the likelihood was optimised to maximise S/
(S + B). We
ended up with 2725 (2386) signal (background) events corresponding to an
eciency of 81.9% (7.7%) with respect to the number of events after the
pre-selection.
1.4 Flavour tag
The reconstructed jets were submitted to vertex reconstruction and flavour
tagging using the LCFIVertex package. To each jet a value for the b-tag,
c-tag and bc-tag (c-tag in the presence of b background only) is assigned.

5.6 Event Pre-Selection
To suppress the background contribution from the non-hadronic Higgs decay
modes, in particular the + mode, and from processes with two or four leptons
in the final states, only events with 25 reconstructed particle objects or more
are accepted. Only events with one Z boson candidate and one reconstructed
Higgs boson candidate are accepted, further reducing the contribution from qq
production. After pre-selection the number of signal events was 3327 and of
background was 31123. These numbers correspond to the luminosity 292 fb1.

 Di-Muon Mass The invariant mass of + pairs found.
 Di-Jet mass The invariant mass of the two jets found by the jet finder.
 Thrust The thrust of the particles assigned to the jets. This is calculated
in the laboratory frame. The thrust is defined as
T = max|~n|=1
i|~n  ~pi|
i|~pi|
(5.3)
with ~n being unit vector to give maximum value. T can have a value
between 1/2 and 1, depending on how linear or isotropic the jet is.
 Cos(Thrust) of the primary thrust axis.
 Cos Z of the Z candidate, from the sum of the four momenta of the +
pair.

energy is assumed to be 250 GeV, and the center of mass frame is assumed
to be the laboratory frame.
 Constraint Di-jet Mass The jets and muon four momenta are fitted with
the constraints of having a total four momentum of p (250, 0, 0, 0) GeV,
and a di-lepton mass of the Z mass. The invariant mass of the two jets is
then taken as the fitted di-jet mass.
 Jet energy difference (|Ejet1Ejet2|) The difference between the energies
of the two jets found by the jet finder.

particular the  lepton mode, and from processes with two or four leptons in the final state,
only events with 25 reconstructed particle objects or more were accepted. Only events with
one Z0 candidate with and one reconstructed Higgs boson candidate were accepted, further
reducing contributions from qq production.

In each case the cuts were chosen to maximise S
(S+B)
. Starting with an
initial loose set of cuts, S
(S+B)
is calculated for different cut values. The cut on
the variable that offers the best improvement in S
(S+B)
is then tightened to that
value and process repeated.
An exception was made for the lower cut on the di-muon mass, M+ > 70
GeV which does not provide the optimum value of S
(S+B)
. A tighter cut was
found to reduce the number of H  cc to a level detrimental to the branching
ratio extraction. In addition, there was no cross-contamination observed between
electron and muon samples.
5.8 Branching Ratio Fitting
The extraction of the branching ratios described here follows the procedure used
in [77]. The reconstructed jets were submitted to vertex reconstruction and
flavour tagging using the LCFIVertex package [83]. To each jet a value for the
b-tag, c-tag and bc-tag is assigned as explained in chapter 4.
For each event the b-likeness and c-likeness is calculated from the b-flavour
tag and c-flavour tag information. The b/c-likeness are:
X1 X2
X1 X2 + (1X1)  (1X2)
(5.4)
where Xi is c- or b-flavour likeness. X1 and X2 are the b/c-tag neural net
5.8. Branching Ratio Fitting
outputs of the first and second jets respectively. This variable requires both jets
to have a high b- or c-tag value for an event to have a high b-flavour likeness or
c-flavour likeness.
A template fitting method is then used to extract the branching ratios.
Independent Monte Carlo samples passing the same event reconstruction and
selection as the data samples are used to build the four two-dimensional
distributions of b-likeness versus c-likeness for each of the Higgs boson hadronic
decay modes (H  bb, H  cc, H  gg) and for the background (everything
else). These templates are then fitted to the simulated data distribution.
Figure 5.7 shows the four Monte Carlo templates and the simulated data.
The branching ratios are extracted by minimising the 2 function

(5.5)
where 2 = N

s takes into account the limited statistics of the Monte
Carlo samples, N ij is the number of events in the bin (i, j) of the distributions,
f = 0.217 is the luminosity used to generate the simulated data divided by the
luminosity of the Monte Carlo samples, rs are the parameters obtained from the
fit and correspond to the b/c-likeness distribution, where s = bb, cc, gg, bkg.
The measured quantities, cross sections times branching ratio, are calculated
from the fitted parameters rs according to:
(e+e  HZ)BR(H  s) = rsBR(H  s)SM(e+e  HZ)SM (5.6)
where SM denotes the Standard Model cross section or branching ratio.
In the Standard Model rs = 1 by definition for bb, cc and gg. Templates are
made of H  bb, H  cc and H  gg decays. All other Higgs decays are put
into background to simplify our calculation, fixing the parameter rbkg = 1. This
is well justified using the fact that the dominant non-hadronic backgrounds, H 
W+W, H  ZZ and H  +, can all be measured separately with negligible
cross contamination from hadronic deays using final state leptons (see [84] for
H  W+W) and therefore they are assumed known in this analysis. Figure 5.7
shows the template and data distributions.

5.10 Discussion
Combined Results Independent studies for other Z decay channels were also
conducted for the ILD Letter of Intent. For this purpose the Higgs branching
ratio results for other Z decay channels are combined with the muon channel.
The combined results are summarised in table 5.3. An uncertainty on the total
cross section of e+e  ZH is expected to be 5% [86]. This value is obtained
by performing a study on the Model Independent analysis which is added in
quadrature for the combined results in table 5.3. The precision achieved in this
analysis and the combined results for different Z decay modes demonstrate the

The results for the Higgs branching ratios are summarised in Table 3.3-4. The statistical
uncertainties are from the exclusive measurements and the 5% uncertainty on the total cross
section. After taking into account the different integrated luminosity and different centre-of-
mass energy, the combined results shown in Table 3.3-4 are broadly in agreement with those
obtained with a fast simulation analysis performed in the context of the TESLA TDR [31].

Analysis Improvements Progress in the detector model and the software can
refine the analysis significantly. Improvements in flavour tagging can be achieved
by re-examining the jet finding. In jet finding, we force particles into a jet which
sometime dont belong to that jet. It could affect the energy of the reconstructed
jet. A scaling of the flavour tag variables to the reconstructed jet energy can
minimise these effects but a study of these effects is beyond the scope of this
thesis. For signal and background separation, we used only cut based method. An
improvement can be achieved by using the TMVA likelihood method as explained
in section 5.11.
Error Analysis To investigate the experimental systematics, a very good
understanding of the detector performance is needed. This investigation and a
good understanding of the SM backgrounds is not in the scope of this study.
The errors for H  cc and H  gg are certainly statistics limited. For
systematic uncertainties, a very good understanding of the detector performance
and response is needed. It is believed that it is possible to achieve a systematic
uncertainty of 1% for the bb channel based on the fact that there will be manifold
possibilities for calibration and cross checks. [77].

Likelihood Method
A selection of events based on the likelihood method implemented in TMVA was
used in order to achieve better separation of the signal and the background but
due to lack of time this was not completed and not implemented in the analysis.
However, a future study of the Higgs branching ratio can include this neural
network based selection and get an improvement in the selection efficiency of the
signal and background rejection. The input variables were Mjj, E+ , | cos(Z)|,
thrust of the hadronic system, difference of the two jets energies, |Ej1  Ej2|,
and | cos(thrust)|. Figure 5.8 shows the distributions of signal and background of
the separation variables. The cut on the likelihood was optimised to maximise

Chapter 6
Top Higgs Yukawa Coupling
Analysis
6.1 Overview
This chapter presents the analysis which the author carried out on the ttH
process. References [89] and [91] have performed earlier feasibility studies of
the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling via the process e+e  ttH at a linear collider
and in [88], an analysis was performed at 800 GeV center-of-mass energy. We
perform a complete analysis of the process for the Higgs with mass 120 GeV
and the channel where one W boson from the top quark decay, t  bW , decays
as W  l and the other as W  qq. The full reconstruction of the final
state was conducted by reconstructing one hadronic and one leptonic W decays.
Top quarks and the Higgs boson were then reconstructed from W s and b jets.
Missing energy reconstruction has a large impact on the reconstruction of the
semi-leptonic channel, and b-tagging has a crucial role in separating signal and
background. The analysis is carried out for an integrated luminosity, L, of 1000
fb1 at
s = 500 GeV. At this center of mass energy and L, the main background
process is tt.
6.2 Monte Carlo Samples
The analysis was performed with the samples provided by the ILD optimisation
group. The samples were generated at SLAC using WHIZARD, and then
6.3. Semi-Leptonic Channel
simulated and reconstructed on the DESY Grid nodes. The GEANT4 based
Mokka package was used for simulation in the ILD-00 detector model, which
is the first simulated reference model of ILD. Reconstruction was performed
using MarlinReco, PandoraPFA and LCFIVertex with the versions supplied in
ILCInstall v01-07 as described in chapter 4.
The signal used is e+e  ttH at s = 500 GeV, where t decays with 100%
into a b-quark and a W , and Higgs are allowed to decay according to the Standard
Model branching ratios. The signature of the process e+e  ttZ and its cross
section are very close to those of the signal. The process e+e  tt has a rather
large cross section and could mimic the signal. In table 6.1, the sample sizes
used in the analysis for
s = 500 GeV are shown. Note that e+e  tt has
two leptons and two light jets in final state. Time constraints compelled us to
include only this final state in our study. Inclusion of this final state will change
the results of this study to some extent. We had intended to extend this study
for all signal and background channels.
Table 6.1: Cross section and luminosity for signal (ttH) and different background
processes.
Process  (fb) Sample size Luminosity (ab1)
e+e  ttH 0.576 20000 34
e+e  tt lqq 230 400000 1.7
e+e  ttZ 0.58 24000 41
6.3 Semi-Leptonic Channel
For our analysis we selected the semi-leptonic channel of the signal process in
which both top quarks decay into a W and a b-quark, and one W bosons decays
into a charged lepton and a neutrino and the other one decays into light jets.
The final state in this channel has 6 jets among which four are b-jets and two
light jets, j, plus one charged lepton, l, and missing energy for . The final state
follows from the process:
e+e  ttH  W+bWbbb l2j4b (6.1)
6.4. Lepton Identification
The effective branching ratio with the Standard Model values [12] is given:
BR(ttH  l2j4b) = 2 ? BR(H  bb) ? BR(W  2j) ? BR(W  l)
= 30%
Figure 6.1, shows the branching fraction for different final states of the W+W
in ttH. Although the hadronic final state has a larger branching ratio compared
to the semi-leptonic state, it is difficult to reconstruct due to the presence of 8
jets in the final state. The leptonic final state has two charged leptons which can
be reconstructed efficiently but two neutrinos posses difficulty in reconstructing
the full final state. Moreover, the branching ratio is very small for this channel.
In selecting the semi-leptonic channel, we have filtered out  leptons as they
are difficult to reconstruct and identify with an optimal efficiency. This reduces
further the signal efficiency to  20%. There are 20,000 initial events from
which we select the semi-leptonic channel filtering to 4,400 events  22% of the
signal events. There are 3% badly reconstructed events which passed the filtering
process which are easily removed by imposing the condition on the lepton number
> 0 in an event, leaving 3860 events  19.3%.
6.4 Lepton Identification
The first step of the analysis is to select events with a topology compatible with
that of the signal. We need an efficient lepton identification for reconstruction
of the final state. In MarlinReco, there was no reconstruction of hits in muon
detector. We thus only use calorimeter and tracking information for muon
identification. The selection of a lepton is based on the cuts obtained by studying
single particle MC samples (same samples used for the muon identification in
section 5.2).
In the analysis presented in chapter 5, the identification of muons is performed
by using the NN approach. A cut based selection study is conducted at the same
time for the identification of both electrons and muons. In the current top Higgs
Yukawa coupling analysis, we have used the cut based selection.
We generate these single particle samples of 10,000 events each using the
Generic built-in GEANT4 Particle Gun package [90]. The energies of these
generated particles are between 50 and 65 GeV. Five single particle samples

 Reconstructed energy in Hadronic calorimeter, EHCal
 Ratio of the energy in Electromagnetic calorimeter and the Total energy,
EECal/ETot
 Ratio of Total energy and momentum, ETot/P
These variables, ETot, EECal/ETot, EHCal/ETot and the ETot/P are shown in
figure 6.2.
We examine the behaviour of the particles in the individual sub-detectors:
tracking detector, calorimeters, vertex detectors and TPC Tracker. To decide
the selection cuts for the identification of the electron and muon, we analyse
efficiencies for different cut variables. The efficiencies vary with the values of the
cut applied. For example in figure 6.3, the top center plot shows the efficiency
changes as the result of varying the upper cut on EECal listed in table 6.2.

6.5. Lepton Selection and Jets Finding
After examining the plots in figure 6.3 we chose the following cuts for Muon
and Electron identification:
Table 6.2: Cuts for muon and electron identification.
Variable Muon Cut Electron Cut
Momentum 20GeV < P < 100 GeV 20GeV < P < 100 GeV
EECal < 2.5 GeV > 32 GeV
EHCal < 15 GeV < 15 GeV
EECal/ETot < 0.5 > 0.6
ETot/P < 0.3 > 0.7
The overall efficiencies of the Muon cuts are:
 ()Muon = 98.8% 0.7%
 ()Pions = 3.4% 1.3%
 ()Electron = 0+0.010 %
Similarly the overall efficiencies of the Electron cuts are:
 (e)Electron = 97.7% 0.1%
 (e)Pions = 0.80% 0.13%
 (e)Muon = 0+0.010 %
6.5 Lepton Selection and Jets Finding
We apply the cuts obtained from the single particle sample study on the PFOs
(section 4.2) in the ttH sample to identify leptons. Figures (6.4) shows the
resolution of the reconstructed three momentum of selected leptons. It should
be noted that we consider only electrons and muons as the lepton candidates, as
taus are difficult to reconstruct and identify.
Once we select the leptons, we remove them from our sample and force the
remaining particles into 6 jets by using the JETFinder algorithm (see section
4.4). The LCFIVertex reconstruction is performed on the jets afterwards.

6.6 Reconstructing Missing Momentum
In the semi-leptonic channel, there is missing momentum due to the presence of
a neutrino. The reconstruction of this missing momentum summed over all the
particles, i, in the event.
pmissx = ipxi, pmissy = ipyi, pmissz = ipzi (6.2)
The transverse component of the the neutrino momentum is equal to the
corresponding component of the missing energy in the event, defined as:
pmissT =
(pmissx )
2 + (pmissy )
2 (6.3)
Figure 6.5 shows the reconstruction of the transverse component of the missing
momentum. Comparing the transverse component and the z-component, the
resolution for pz is slightly worse compared to pT as shown in right figure 6.6 but
far better than at the LHC. This is a motivation and an advantage of the ILC
that the z-component of momentum is well reconstructed compared to the LHC.

6.7. Pre-Selection
6.7 Pre-Selection
Once leptons are identified, only those events are selected which have at least
one charged lepton (electron or muon). If there are more than one electron or
muon in the event, then the charged lepton with highest momentum is selected to
reconstruct the final state. Remaining leptons are included in the reconstructed
jets.
6.8 Reconstruction of Semi-Leptonic W
Compared to the LHC where the complete reconstruction of W  l is limited
by the impossibility of reconstructing fully the neutrino four-momentum, at a
linear collider it is possible to fully reconstruct the semi-leptonic W . The W
boson mass can be reconstructed using equation:
(E + El)2  (px + plx)2  (py + ply)2  (pz + plz)2 (6.4)
In the left figure 6.7, the reconstructed mass of the W candidate, given in
equation 6.4, is shown. Equation 6.4 is also used to combine the truth information
of the charged lepton and missing energy to get the mass of W as shown in the
right figure 6.7. In this plot, some events are in the lower W mass range due
to the linking processor used to get the truth W mass. In this processor, the
reconstructed and true particle are linked. In some of the events, this linking
is not effective as it matches a wrong true particle with the reconstructed one,
having a lower momentum. The combination of wrong true particles gives a
smaller W mass as shown in the right figure 6.7. The width of the distribution
is the natural width of the W boson.
The z-component of the missing momentum can be reconstructed at ILC far
better than at the LHC, therefore, it is worth calculating the transverse mass
of W -boson and compare with the full reconstructed mass. The reconstructed
transverse mass of W boson and the true transverse mass of W boson in figure 6.8
are given by the equation:
MWT =

where plT and p
T are the transverse momentum of the reconstructed lepton and
missing energy respectively, while l and  are the polar angles of lepton and
missing energy with the z-axis.
In the figure 6.8, the reconstruction of transverse mass is compared with the
true transverse mass. Both distributions have same shape but the reconstructed
transverse mass has more events for lower values. It is due to the uncertainty in
the reconstruction of x- and y-components of both missing momentum and the
lepton.
6.9 Reconstruction of Hadronic W
Jets passing the LCFIVertex reconstruction are sorted according to their b-tag
value. These four jets with the highest b-tag value are considered as the b-jets
and the two with the lowest b-tag value are considered as the light jets. Hadronic
W candidates are created from pairs of light-jets in the event. Right figure 6.9
shows the distribution of the Hadronic W reconstructed mass where we see a very
wide range of the distribution. The b-tag of all six jets is examined as shown in
left figure 6.10 and it is noticed that in an event not all four b-jets have a very
high b-tag value. Sometime the value of jet three and four is very close to the
b-tag value of jets tagged as light jets. Therefore, reconstruction of W by using
this method of sorting is not always effective. There is a possibility that a wrong

jet is tagged as the light jet.
Therefore, another way of reconstructing the mass of hadronic W is attempted
in which all jets with b-tag value less than 0.09 are combined. This value is
selected by using the optimised cut value of 0.09 on the b-tag of third and fourth
jet as explained in the next section. Among all these combination, that one is
selected where the invariant mass of the light jet pair is closest to the W mass as
shown in left figure 6.9. The remaining jets are considered as the b-jets and they
are used to reconstruct Mbb,Mlb and Mjjb. Right figure 6.10 shows b-tag value
of the jet pair which is chosen to reconstruct W .
6.10 Full Reconstruction of the Final State
From the six jets, four jets are tagged as b-jets (those with highest b-tag
value). Top-quarks are reconstructed using a tagged b-jet and a reconstructed
W candidate and the Higgs boson is reconstructed from a pair of tagged b-jets.
All possible combinations of tagged b-jets are examined to reconstruct the mass
of Higgs boson and both top-quarks simultaneously. Figure 6.11 shows the mass
distributions for the 12 possible combinations of reconstructed Higgs and top-
quarks per event.
To reduce combinatorial background, only that combination is selected per

where the first term is from the reconstructed semi-leptonic top-quark, the second
term from the hadronic top-quark reconstructed from the two light jets W , and
the final contribution is from the Higgs boson, with Mt = 175 GeV and MHiggs =
120 GeV. The 2 incorporates the uncertainties, ()s, on the jet energies. These
s are determined from the mass distributions of Higgs and top quarks given by
the minimisation of 2 with s considered as equal. From the Higgs and top
quark mass distributions we get:
lb = 20.7 0.2 GeV
jjb = 23.5 0.3 GeV
bb = 19.3 0.2 GeV
The mass distributions of the lowest 2 combination are given in figure 6.12.
6.11 Signal Background Separation
Once a full reconstruction of the final state has been achieved, we include
background samples in our analysis. There are 400,000 events in the tt sample
and 24,000 events for ttZ background process. A cut-based method is used to
reduce these main background processes.
6.11.1 Selection Cuts
The following variables are used to select events to be considered for further
analysis:
 EAllReco is the sum of the energies of all reconstructed particle in the event.
 PRecoLep is the reconstructed momentum of the identified lepton.
 Pmiss is the reconstructed missing momentum.
 PJets is the momentum of each of the reconstructed jets.

6.11.2 B-tag of Light Jets
The b-tagging information separates the signal and background quite significantly.
As the background events do not have H  bb, therefore the b-tag values of jet3
and jet4 can remove a significant number of background events as shown in the
figure 6.14.
6.11.3 Cuts Summary
Two other variables which can improve the separation of signal and background
are 2 and the mass of Wl . The mass of the Wjj, which we obtain by combining
the light jets tagged in order of the highest b-tag, does not help much to reduce
the separation of background due to its large distribution width. Table 6.3
summarises the number of signal and background events at each consecutive step
of the reconstructed procedure.
Figure 6.15 shows that the selection variable, total reconstructed mass in the
event, discriminate tt background significantly. It is defined as:
TotalMEvent = mbb +mlb +mjjb. (6.7)
We vary the TotalMEvent to optimise the quantity
. We select the events
which have TotalMEvent greater than 420 GeV. After applying this cut, our final
state looks like as shown in figure 6.16. We notice that the signal events in Mbb
distribution are mostly in mass window (100 , 140) GeV. Finally we apply this
cut to suppress the background contribution.
The cut based selection reduces the tt background significantly to 0.11% and
ttZ to 2.76%, whereas the efficiency for signal is  8%. Our final state is shown
in figure 6.16 after applying all cuts except the Higgs mass window selection.

The value of L we used in finding our final results is 1000 fb1. This large value

the ILC with three to four years data, 1000 fb1 luminosity can be achieved at
500 GeV center-of-mass energy.

background normalisation. It is due to the badly known differential cross-section
for tt in weakly populated phase space areas. It is sizeable and moreover difficult
to estimate. In [88], two values 5% and 10% were used for this uncertainty. A
study to measure the top pair production cross section at the ILC, is currently in
process at LAL, Orsay [92]. Once these results are ready, we can use that value in
the analysis but currently the 5% value is chosen. The large cross section and low

selection of tt background sample limits available MC sample statistically. In the
systematic uncertainty, we just take into account the one which arises from the
effective background normalisation since it is by far the largest one among those
we can estimate. The sensitivity factors Sstat and Ssyst in the above relations
express the dependency of the cross section on the squared coupling:

Ssyst(g

 (6.11)
As shown in figure 2.11, the contribution from Higgs radiation off the Z to
the signal cross-section is very small. In order to calculate the sensitivity factors,
we will thus neglect it, allowing a very simple calculation. In this approximation,
we can write:
ttH  g2ttHF (mH ,mt, s) (6.12)
And thus:
dttH
 F (mH ,mt, s) 
ttH

where s is the squared collision energy. The values of Sstat and Ssyst for mH = 120

s = 500 GeV are:

Ssyst = 1.98 (6.15)

The expected precision on measuring the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling is better
than 28% for mH = 120 GeV, if the knowledge of tt background normalisation is
known at the 5% level. Much of the uncertainty on the results of this analysis is
due to the small cross section of the ttH signal process. Even though the signal
cross section is very small at the
s = 500 GeV, yet 28% accuracy is achieved.
At higher energies, the cross section of the signal process is larger, therefore it

motivates an increased center of mass energy for the ILC. For example, at
800 GeV, the signal to background ratio decreases to  100 as compared to the
ratio  900 at 500 GeV.
Certainly there is room for improvement of the study presented in this chapter.
As explained for the Higgs branching ratio analysis (section 5.10), jet finding can
be re-examined to refine the flavour tagging. Improved jet finding and flavour
tagging processors are available recently in the new ILC software but a study of
the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling analysis with this version of software is beyond
the scope of this thesis.
One of the areas of consideration is the improvement in the hadronic W
reconstruction. A cut on the b-tag value of the jets is used to identify light
jets which are then combined to reconstruct the W boson. This cut was decided
to accommodate the selection cut on b-tag of third and fourth jet. A re-examining
of the cut on b-tag of fifth and sixth jet could recover the signal events with a
b-tag > 0.09 and hence, improve the efficiency and purity of the sample.
A cut based strategy is applied to discriminate the signal and background
events. It is shown in previous studies that the use of neural network and
likelihood methods can perform the signal background separation with better
efficiency [91]. Hence, it is anticipated that a 2-3% improvement in the precision
can be achieved by using neural network analysis.
For the current study, six fermion backgrounds are not included but refer-
ence [88] shows that the loss of precision on gttH measurement is negligible due
to this background. An amendment in the analysis involves the tt background
normalisation which is 5% in our analysis. If the exact background normalisation
is used, our results might change. Once the results from the group working
on measuring the cross section of top pair production [92] are ready, they can be
included in the analysis.

Summary and Conclusions
In this thesis we have presented two studies measuring the coupling of the
Standard Model Higgs boson to quarks using the proposed ILD detector at the
proposed ILC collider. In both cases we have used a Higgs boson with mass of
120 GeV. If a SM-like Higgs boson exists, its very likely to be found at LHC
which is currently operational. However, as LHC is a hadron collider, it may
not be possible to measure the interesting properties of Higgs boson which could
discriminate the SM from the other models, such as Supersymmetry. Therefore,
one purpose of the ILC is to precisely specify the properties of Higgs boson.
Two key properties are the coupling of Higgs with the heaviest quark, top, and
different branching ratios of Higgs to quarks. These properties are predicted to
be poorly measured at the LHC.
In the first part of this thesis, a study of the Higgs branching ratio
measurements was conducted. The channel studied is ZH  +H at 250 GeV
center of mass energy. The main background is ZZ production. Muons were
identified using a Neural Network. The identified muons were removed from
the sample and the remaining particles were used to reconstruct exactly two jets.
Subsequently, successive cuts were applied to suppress the background process. b-
and c-tagging was then used to distinguish between the final states of the Higgs
decay. In this study, the SM branching ratio of Higgs to bb can be measured
with a precision of 4% with an integrated luminosity of 250 pb1. Similarly, the
SM branching ratios to cc and gg are both measured with precision of  45%.
Results from other independent studies were combined with the branching ratio
analysis presented in this thesis for the ILD Letter of Intent [50]. Including a
5% uncertainty on Higgs production cross section, the combined precision on the
BRs are 5.5% for bb and 15% for cc.
The second study for this thesis involved measuring the top Higgs Yukawa
coupling using the ttH production at 500 GeV. The top quark always decays
as t  bW . The semi-leptonic channel was investigated where one W boson
decays into leptons and other into light jets and the Higgs boson decays into
b-jets. The full reconstruction of the final state is performed by identifying
the charged lepton and reconstructing the missing momentum and six jets. b-
tagging plays a crucial role in identifying different jet flavours. Among six jets in
the final state, four are tagged as b-jets and two as light jets. The leptonic
and hadronic W bosons are reconstructed by combining the charged lepton
and missing momentum information and the two light jets, respectively. The
combinatorial background, in reconstructing final state top quarks and Higgs
using the four b-tagged jets, is suppressed by minimising the 2:
(Mlb Mt)2
2lb
(Mjjb Mt)2
2jjb
(Mbb MHiggs)2
where theMlb, Mjjb andMbb are the reconstructed invariant masses of the leptons
and jets,  are the resolutions of the reconstructed invariant masses and MHiggs
and Mt are the Higgs and top quark masses respectively. To discriminate the
signal, ttH, and background tt and ttZ processes, selection cuts are applied.
In this analysis, top Higgs Yukawa coupling is measured with a precision of
28% including an uncertainty of 5% on the cross section normalisation of the
tt background.
We have studied the prospects of precise measurement of the Higgs boson
branching ratios and top quark Yukawa coupling during the first phase of the
ILC with center of mass energy 500 GeV. These shows that a
s = 500 GeV
collider adds enough to our physics knowledge to justify the project. However, an
upgrade to
s= 1TeV increases significantly the value of the ILC. The ILC will be
essential to interplay the LHC discoveries and move forward on our understanding
of the Higgs physics. Both analyses in this thesis are the optimised studies
performed for the ILD 00 detector model. They do not represent the ultimate ILD
performance as significant improvements in the analyses are possible. However,
the precision achieved by these studies showed that the ILD detector concept
meets the requirements for an ILC detector.
