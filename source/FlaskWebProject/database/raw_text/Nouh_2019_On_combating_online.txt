Abstract
The Internet is the crime scene of the 21st century.
The complexity of cybercrimes is constantly increasing with advanced tools,
attack vectors, and Modus Operandi adopted by offenders every day. Criminals
have easy access to advanced technical abilities that they need to carry their attacks,
using what is called crime-as-a-service, from the dark web and online black markets.
Similarly, the nature of cybercrimes has generated multitudes of data introduced by
the cyber aspect of these crimes, which makes the process of identifying evidence
similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. To aid law enforcement to better
detect, analyse, and understand the threat landscape posed by cyber-criminals,
research into the area of cybercrime intelligence has flourished. Law enforcement
faces numerous challenges when policing cybercrimes. The methods and processes
they use when dealing with traditional crimes do not necessarily apply in the cyber
world. Additionally, criminals are usually technologically-aware and one step ahead
of the police. Furthermore, current tools created to support law enforcement to
better police cybercrimes more often conflict with how they are used to operate,
and are too complex, thus making them difficult to adopt.
In this thesis, we aim to design and develop a cybercrime intelligence framework
for law enforcement that provides decision support to detect and analyse the
behaviour of cyber-criminals. To do so, we need to better understand the cyber-
criminal ecosystem, as well as understand the current capabilities of law enforcement
agencies, and the challenges they face when policing cybercrimes. We achieve
this through semi-structured interviews conducted with professionals and law
enforcement agents investigating cybercrimes. From there, we define a framework to
aid them in addressing some of the challenges they face. Moreover, the cybercrime
landscape varies considerably in regards to the type of crime and what they target.
Some crimes target computers and systems while others target the human. As
there has been considerable research focusing on analysing cybercrimes that target
systems such as (Malware, Hacking, DDOS), the focus on the crimes that target
the human ( e.g., cyber-bullying, online radicalisation) has recently become more
evident. In this research, we focus on the area of online radicalisation and utilise our
framework to better understand the properties of radical propaganda and develop
methods to defend against its spread. We focus on the ISIS group aiming to identify
measures to automatically detect radical content and activities in social media.
We identify several signals, including textual, psychological and behavioural, that
together allow for the identification of radical messages, using methods such as
natural language processing, social network analysis, and machine learning. Our
findings can be utilised as signals for detecting online radicalisation activities by
law enforcement and social media platforms to help keep the online world safe.

Introduction
Cybercrime is defined as any crime that is facilitated or committed using a computer,
network, or hardware device [1]. Initially, it emerged as a threat to individuals and
organisations; now it also impacts on entire countries. Experts in the criminology
field have reported that the existence of organised cybercriminals in the online world
is growing rapidly [2]. According to the Cyber Security Breaches Survey [3], around
a third (32%) of businesses in the UK report having cyber security breaches or
attacks in 2019. In one minute on the internet, $2.9 million is lost to cybercrimes1.
These figures show that there is an increase in scale and numbers of cybercrime
incidents, which is often correlated with a lack of proper technological response
and support from law enforcement [4].
The area of cybercrime poses a low risk and high return for cybercriminals
since typically they carry out their operations remotely, equipped with tools that
provide them with anonymity and encryption. This makes detecting and identifying
them even more challenging for law enforcement. Therefore, many traditional
criminals have migrated to the cybercrime world, even if they lack the technological
advancement, by making use of the online cybercrime marketplace or what is
called cybercrime-as-a-service [5].

1. Introduction 2
The threat of cybercrime is evolving as a tool for terrorism and serious and
organised crimes. The convergence of cyber and terrorism introduces new threats
and attack victors. Terrorist groups are exploiting emerging online platforms and
adopting new technologies to facilitate online communication and distribution of
their propaganda [6]. As these threats continue to evolve, online platforms and
law enforcement need to innovate and collaborate in order to stay ahead and
effectively respond to these threats.
1.1 Motivation
Cybercrime Intelligence  Cybercrime investigators are facing numerous diffi-
culties trying to keep pace with the increasing numbers of incidents and the evolution
of techniques used by cybercriminals. Previous studies suggest that the methods and
processes typically used by law enforcement when investigating traditional crimes
do not necessarily apply in the cyber world [7, 8]. Thus, there is a need to adopt a
different process and build a new set of skills and knowledge to be able to mitigate
these technologically advanced crimes. This is essential mainly as the cybercriminals
are usually technologically-aware and are constantly adapting and developing new
tools to allow them to stay ahead of law enforcement investigations [911]. Even if
they do not have the appropriate technical knowledge to commit the crime, thanks
to several online markets that provide crime-as-a-service, any advanced technical
skill is now available for anyone willing to pay.
Moreover, from the technology side, current tools created to support law
enforcement to better police cybercrimes more often conflict with how they are
used to operate, and are too complex, thus making them difficult to adopt [4, 12].
As a result, the area of cybercrime intelligence has attracted the attention of the
research community intending to aid law enforcement to better detect, analyse, and
understand the threat landscape posed by online cybercriminals. Cybercriminals use
the Internet as their crime scene since it provides them with ease of communication,
wider recruitment possibilities, and opportunities to form a partnerships with other
national and international criminal groups [13, 14]. This often results in them
1. Introduction 3
leaving several crumbs that collectively produce a digital footprint for each group
of cybercriminals. Previous research has studied these footprints to gain a better
understanding of the characteristics of these cybercriminal groups [1518]. For
example, this could be by adopting techniques such as content analysis. This is
used to interpret meaning from text and extract inferences, to profile criminals,
or by uncovering the leadership and organisational structure of a given criminal
organised group using social network analysis methods [19], which is the process
of investigating social structures using network and graph theories.
Furthermore, while there are many research efforts focused on understanding
and analysing the tactics used by cybercriminals [11, 20, 21], very little research
exists that focuses on understanding the processes, challenges, and needs of law
enforcement and cybercrime investigators. Therefore, there is a need for new research
that focuses on understanding the needs and challenges faced by practitioners.
Online Radicalization  The rise of Online Social Networks (OSN) has
facilitated a wide application of their data as sensors for information to solve
different problems. For example, Twitter data has been used for predicting election
results, detecting the spread of flu epidemics, and as a source for finding eye-witnesses
during criminal incidents and crises [22], [23]. This phenomenon is possible due
to the great overlap between our online and offline worlds. Such a seamless shift
between both worlds has also affected the modus operandi of cybercriminals and
extremist groups [24]. They have benefited tremendously from the Internet and
OSN platforms, as they provide them with opportunities to spread their propaganda,
widen their reach for victims, and facilitate potential recruitment opportunities.
For instance, recent studies show that the Internet and social media played an
important role in the increased number of violent right-wing extremism activities [25].
Similarly, extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) have used social media to spread and promote their propaganda, which
inspired the Boston Marathon bombers in 2010 [26].
To limit the reach of cyber-terrorists, several private and governmental organiza-
tions are policing online content and utilising big data technologies to minimize the
1. Introduction 4
damage and counter the spread of such information. For example, the UK launched
a Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit in 2010 aiming to remove unlawful
Internet content and it supports the police in investigating terrorist and radicalizing
activities online. The unit reports that among the most frequently referred links
were those coming from several OSNs, such as Facebook and Twitter [24]. Similarly,
several OSNs are constantly working on detecting and removing users promoting
unlawful and extremist content. In 2018, Twitter announced that they suspended
over 1.2 million accounts that featured terrorist content [27].
Realizing the danger of violent extremism and radicalization and how it is
becoming a major challenge to societies worldwide, many researchers have attempted
to study the behaviour of pro-extremist users online. Looking at existing literature,
we find that several existing studies incorporate methods to identify distinguishing
characteristics that can aid in automatic detection of these users [28, 29]. However,
many of them depend on performing a keyword-based textual analysis which, if used
alone, may have several shortcomings, such as producing a large number of false
positives and having a high dependency on the data being studied. Additionally, it
can be easily evaded if users adapt their writing styles using automated tools.
1.2 Scope
As in any research project, it is important to draw boundaries around the scope
of the project, and this is defined as follows:
UK Centric  The majority of the research in the literature that focuses
on studying investigators needs and the challenges they face is based in the
United States [3032]. Very little published literature has investigated elsewhere
in the world, including the UK [33]. Similarly, the majority attempted to use
surveys with close-ended questions as a means to collect data. One advantage
of using this approach is that responses may be collected from a large number
of participants. However, a disadvantage is that it limits the ability to capture
insights and understand the reasons behind the chosen answers [31]. Additionally,
related literature studied the views of particular types of participants dealing with
1. Introduction 5
cybercrimes (e.g., local police officers). Very few looked at this issue from multiple
viewpoints of different participant types (i.e., local officers, regional and national
cybercrime units). In our study (presented in Chapter 4) we address these gaps
by interviewing participants dealing with cybercrimes from the government-sector
(including local and regional units) as well as from the private sector. We aim to
identify the needs and challenges faced by cybercrime investigators and practitioners
using detailed, in-depth interviews. In these expert interviews, we not only focus
on a specific aspect of the investigation, such as digital forensics, but we also look
at the holistic process followed when investigating and therefore touch on several
issues related to technical and human aspects.
Cybercrimes  The topic of cybercrime is quite diverse and varies considerably
in terms of methods, motives, and victims, based on the type of crime under
investigation. While there is a considerable amount of research that focuses on
studying cybercrimes that target networks and systems, such as malware, DDoS,
and cyber-fraud [3436], research is sparse related to cybercrimes that target the
humans mindset. In recent years, an evolving threat that targets peoples hearts and
minds has grown. These crimes cause online harm and have ideological, political, or
psychological motives. Such threats include the use of online resources to manipulate
the public for political or social gain, hate crimes, cyber-bullying, trolling, the
spread of fake news and violent and extremist content and activities. Starting from
Chapter 6, we focus our topic of cybercrime on the area of online extremist content
and activities as this area still lacks a proper and effective response [37].
Extremist Groups  Several terrorist and extremist groups have benefited
tremendously from technology such as the Internet and Online Social Network (OSN)
platforms as this provides them with opportunities to spread their propaganda,
widens their reach for victims, and facilitates potential recruitment opportunities.
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is one of the leading groups to heavily
utilise digital media and propaganda to promote their views and recruit sympa-
thisers [38]. In the study presented in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, we focus on
studying strategies used by the ISIS extremist group with the aim of analysing their
1. Introduction 6
propaganda narrative in order to identify measures to automatically detect the
spread of radical content and activities online. We then compare the learned signals
and strategies across different extremist groups in Chapter 8 to ascertain if these
signals are a group focused or whether they are shared across different extremist
narratives. Through the understanding of how the extremist narrative is constructed
and distributed we can design and build systems to aid law enforcement and social
network platforms effectively detect and mitigate the spread of extremist content.
1.3 Research Questions
In the course of this research project, we aim to answer several research questions
that relate to the two sides of the crime: defenders (investigators) and offenders
(criminals). From the defenders side, we define the following research questions.
RQ1. What are the main challenges currently being faced by cybercrime investi-
gators?
RQ2. What are the requirements for cybercrime intelligence systems that
would be appropriate and helpful for investigators?
Before identifying the challenges that are faced by investigators, we need
to understand their existing capabilities and the processes and workflows they
follow during investigations. To address the above two questions, we start by
exploring the current literature relating to the needs and challenges of cybercrime
investigators. Then, we design our study where we interview practitioners from
different organisations to capture their requirements and areas where improvements
are needed in terms of processes and tools. This leads to the design of a cybercrime
intelligence framework.
From the offenders side, we focus on the topic of online extremism and
radicalisation, where we apply our framework to study properties of extremist
narrative and build systems to detect the spread of online radicalisation. As such,
we define the following questions.
RQ3. Can we identify hidden properties and signals that describe extremist
strategies in crafting their online propaganda?
1. Introduction 7
RQ4. Can we detect the spread of extremist narrative in social media?
RQ5. To what extent are extremist narrative properties shared across multiple
extremist groups?
To address the above questions, we focus on the ISIS extremist group to
understand their methods and strategies in crafting their propaganda material.
Using our framework, we identify a set of properties that are extracted from ISIS
propaganda. Then we conduct a study using Twitter, to understand the behaviour
of ISIS supporters and evaluate our approach for detecting the extremist narrative.
Finally, we end by comparing the identified properties across different extremist
groups, mainly Al-Qaeda and Alternative-Right (Alt-Right) groups.
1.4 Contributions
The main contributions of this thesis are presented in the following chapters of work:
1. Chapter 4: Cybercrime Investigations: Process and Challenges. We
study the current practices followed by law enforcement, and more generally
security intelligence companies when investigating cybercrimes and gathering
intelligence. Using detailed in-depth expert interviews, we identify the general
characteristics related to the investigation process of cybercrimes. This allows
for the identification of empirical socio-technical challenges currently faced
and areas where new technologies, processes, and workflows are necessary.
Identifying these challenges led to formulating user-driven recommendations
for designing and building processes and tools to improve the day-to-day
operations of cybercrime investigators. In these expert interviews, we not only
focus on a specific aspect of the investigation, such as digital forensics, but
we also look at the holistic process followed when investigating and therefore
touch on several issues related to technical and human aspects.
2. Chapter 5: The CCNIT Framework. Based on our evaluation of the
literature and our understanding of the processes and challenges faced by
experts in the field, we propose a cybercrime intelligence framework named
1. Introduction 8
CCINT. The framework is designed to fill gaps identified in the literature and
adhere to the gathered requirements and design guidelines recommended for
intelligence systems. We describe the different components of the framework,
which include a conceptual model that aids investigators in the process of
collecting effective intelligence, and an operational model that focuses on
developing analytical tools.
3. Chapter 6: Properties of Radical Propaganda. In this chapter, we focus
our study on the problem of online radicalisation. More precisely, we apply
methods from the CCINT framework and utilise computational techniques
to analyse online extremist propaganda and reveal their underlying tactics.
We explore the use of new methods to uncover syntactic, semantic, and
psychological properties associated with the extremist discourse.
4. Chapter 7: Detection of Online Radicalisation. After identifying prop-
erties of extremist propaganda, we design and build a system to detect online
supporters of extremist groups in social networks. We build different models
to detect extremist narrative and behaviour on Twitter and show how the
results are consistent across different datasets. This system can be useful
for OSN platforms and law enforcement to counter extremist groups online
propaganda.
5. Chapter 8: Comparison of Radical Groups. We compare the properties of
propaganda published by different radical groups and identify the similarities
between them. This is important in order to understand what properties are
global across different extremist groups, and what properties are local and
linked to a particular groups culture and ideology. This allows us to highlight
the potential wider applicability of our system proposed in Chapter 7.

quantitative) methods we adopt to answer the defined research questions. Chap-
ters 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 cover the main contributions of this work, as summarised in

the key findings of the research and the main lessons learned; we also discuss the
limitations of this research and propose a set of future research directions.
Literature Review
In this chapter, we present a review of related literature and key concepts relevant to
the research presented in this thesis. First, we understand the necessary background
related to the field of cybercrime. Then, we discuss the literature related to
intelligence gathering, before exploring existing work on requirements for intelligence
frameworks. Since we later scope on the topic of online radicalisation, we outline
the existing related studies.
2.1 Cybercrime Definitions and Taxonomies
In order to understand the state-of-the-art research in the area of cybercrime, it is
important to define what we regard as cybercrime and cybercriminals. There have
been several arguments in the literature over the exact definition of cybercrime with
no single universal definition [39]. Similarly, some articles use generic references such
as computer-crime, Internet-crime, digital-crime, and most widely used cybercrime
(or cyber-crime), as well as terms references to specific forms of crimes such as
cyber-terrorism and cyber-stalking [40]. The European Commission proposed
the following definition for cybercrime: criminal acts committed using electronic
communications networks and information systems or against such networks and
2. Literature Review 13
systems" [39]. The definition incorporates crimes that were facilitated by computers
and those that were committed against them.
Some articles in the literature define cybercrime as any crime that involves
computers or networks, others define it as purely digital crimes, or traditional
crimes which are enhanced through the use of digital technology [41]. Initially,
previous research drew a distinction between crimes, where the computers are the
target of the crime (hacking, spam, terrorism-related offences), and crimes where
computers act as tools to commit the crime (child pornography, phishing) [40].
David Wall considers cybercrime to be one of three types: (1) Crime in the machine,
(2) crime using the machine, and (3) crime against the machine [42]. Crime in the
machine relates to the content of computers which include for example the trade of
pornographic material, crime using the machine relates to any crimes committed
using networked computers such as targeting victims by phishing emails, finally
crimes against the machine covers the integrity of computers and networks such
as hacking and planting of viruses and Trojans.
Furthermore, Brar et al. [43] attempts to provide a taxonomy of cybercrimes in
the context of the three security principles (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).
They break-down cybercrimes to four types: cyber-violence (e.g., cyber-terrorism,
cyber-stalking), cyber-peddler (e.g., cyber-fraud, cyber-activism), cyber-trespass
(e.g., cyber-theft, cyber-pornography), and cyber-squatting (e.g., attackers illegally
register the trademark of legitimate owners to deny them).
Another classification of cybercrimes that is adopted by the UK Home Office, is
the break-down to computer-enabled and computer-dependant crimes. The former
includes traditional crimes that can be enhanced in scale and reach using computers
and networks, while the latter includes crimes that can only be committed using
computers and networks [44]. The matrix in Table 2.1 gives examples for each of
these categories based on the level of opportunity and type of crime. For example,
a phishing attack is considered a computer-dependant crime and a crime using the
machine. On the other hand, distribution of viruses and hacking are classified as
computer-enabled crime and a crime against the machine.

This section points out the variations in definitions and taxonomies that exist
in the current literature. Such variations contribute to the challenge of establishing
proper international efforts to counter cybercrimes.
2.2 Cybercrime Intelligence Literature
We classify existing work in the area of cybercrime intelligence into three main
research tracks presented in Figure 2.1 and detailed in the following subsections.
2.2.1 Detection of Cybercrimes
This section reviews the literature related to cyber-dependent crimes, the methods
and data sources being employed. As the majority of online content is lawful;
the challenge is to detect outlier criminal-related content and behaviour. Several
methods are reported in the literature to address this issue [17, 46, 47]. Some
focus on studying textual content through the use of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques in order to achieve different tasks, such as authorship profiling
and analysis; text classification; and sentiment analysis [17]. Others adopt different
methods such as Social Network Analysis (SNA) to study the relations between
criminals and properties of the communities they form [46]; information extraction
to extract intelligence from large amounts of text [47]; and machine learning to
classify/cluster users accounts and identify outliers automatically [28].
2. Literature Review 15
Figure 2.1: Classification of cybercrime intelligence research tracks
One of the tough challenges for all researchers in this domain is access to reliable
data. Previous studies have focused on different types of online data, such as
online forums and social media. Similarly, some used data gathered from different
news websites and online auctions to detect fraudulent behaviours [48]. When
it comes to methods for evaluation, most of the existing research either lacks a
proper evaluation method, performs manual evaluation [46], depends on expert
evaluation [49], or uses statistical measures [50].
The literature review shows that one of the heavily studied research problems is
the detection of online spam. One method that is employed the most to achieve this
task is machine learning [51, 52]. McCord et al. [51] present a traditional machine
learning classifier to detect spam users in Twitter. They used a combination of
content-based and user-based features, and compare the performance of four different
classifiers. For evaluation they use the standard metrics for measuring the usefulness
of the detection scheme (confusion matrix). In a similar study, Wang [53] proposed
spam detection classifier for Twitter based on content and graph features. His results
showed that the Bayesian classifier generated the best performance. He used classic
evaluation metrics (i.e., precision, recall, f-measure) to compare the performance
of different classification methods. Looking at a different social network platform,
Beeutel et al. [54] study the problem of spammers performing Page Like actions in
order to make a profit. They propose a method called CopyCatch, aimed at detecting
ill-gotten Page-Likes on Facebook by analysing the social network of users and Pages
and the times at which the Likes-actions were created. They use two algorithms, an
iterative algorithm and an approximate MapReduce implementation. Stringhini at
2. Literature Review 16
al., [55] showed the possibility to automatically identify spammers accounts using
honey-profiles (similar to honeypots concept) in several social networks (Twitter,
Facebook, MySpace). To evaluate their method they submitted the identified
profiles to Twitter, and Twitter verified these accounts and deleted around 15, 857
spam profiles, while 75 profiles were reported by Twitter as false positives.
Moreover, another type of threat that emerged is what is called social-bots.
Several research efforts [52, 5658] studied the identification of malicious bots
(software agents imitating humans). These bots are able to mimic characteristics
related to content, network, sentiment, and temporal patterns of activity. Ferrara
et al. [56] study the incorporation of behavioural features to detect social bots
in Twitter. Everett et. al., [57] investigated how easily bots can deceive humans
to the extent of believing that an automatically-generated text was written by
a human. They identified a set of factors that contribute to how convincing the
text is. In other work Thomas et al. [52] infiltrated the underground market of
fraudulent accounts. By collaborating with Twitter, they were able to investigate
fraudulent accounts and develop a classification algorithm to retroactively detect
millions of fraudulent accounts that were sold by the underground marketplace
they infiltrated. For the classification they used features such as account-naming
patterns, form-submission timing, and sign-up flow events. Precision and recall
were used to validating the proposed model. Moreover, Wang et al. [58] studied the
use of crowd-sourcing for detecting Sybils (fake accounts) in online social networks,
more specifically Facebook. They analyse the detection accuracy using workers
from Amazon Mechanical Turk called turkers and experts.
Furthermore, Yang et al. [59] perform an empirical study to study cybercriminal
communities in Twitter. They focus on developing criminal-account detection
algorithm based on social relationships and semantic coordination. Their study
focuses on identifying profiles that post malicious URLs as a starting point for
identifying communities, then they look at social relations between these accounts.
They evaluate their algorithm on two datasets and determine the effectiveness of the
algorithm based on the number of correctly inferred criminal accounts and malicious
2. Literature Review 17
accounts. Savari et al. [46] built a social network from a seed of publicly leaked
email addresses of criminals. They identified Facebook accounts associated with
these emails and constructed their social graph. Through several SNA methods
they identified multiple criminal communities and profile groups on Facebook. They
manually validated the results to evaluate the effectiveness of their method.
2.2.2 Analysis of Cybercriminals
Analysing the criminal content online allow us to gain further insight into the
structure and behaviour of cybercriminal groups. The work of Stringhini et al. [60]
sheds light on the relations and interactions between different actors involved in the
spam ecosystem. The authors investigate the relations between email harvesters,
botmasters, and spammers, where the analysis is based on correlating their behaviour
based on indirect measurements. Thus, whilst insightful, a limitation of their work
is apparent since no exact figures are calculated and only indirect measurements
are considered. Moreover, Almaatouq et al. [61] analyse the behaviour of spam
accounts on Twitter. Spammers are categorised based on their behaviour into two
different categories: compromised accounts and fraudulent accounts. The authors
then analyse the profile properties of the accounts, and their social interactions
including following and mention-behaviour.
Garg et al. [62]. study the organisation structure of criminals in three under-
ground online forums. They analyse the communities within these forums and
compare topics of communication used by these communities using topic modeling.
They found that most communities specialise in specific crime types. Additionally,
they identified central members from each community using different SNA centrality
measures. Finally, they investigated the effects of removing misbehaving criminals
on the criminal network, and found that this had a positive impact on the network.
Results generalisation is a limitation of this research, similar analysis should be
repeated on larger dataset and different types of underground forums.
Chen et al. [63] present a general framework for data-mining of criminal and
terrorist behaviour. Four categories of crime data-mining techniques were identified,
2. Literature Review 18
namely entity extraction, association, prediction, and pattern visualisation. Three
tasks were performed using those techniques. First, they extracted named entities
(e.g., person names, addresses) from police reports. Second, they detected deceptive
criminal identities within police database using string comparators to measure
similarities between strings. Finally, they worked on identifying subgroups and key
members. Hierarchical clustering was applied to identify subgroups and centrality
measures was used to detect key members in each group. Their work showed that
using SNA concepts is suitable for studying such terrorist networks. Choudhary et
al. [64] surveyed existing literature on counter terrorism and social network analysis.
They found that SNA is one of the most successful methods for counter terrorism
in social networks. This is given that the most studied problems in this domain are
related to identifying key-players, finding behaviour patterns, community discovery,
and disrupting terrorist networks.
Similarly, Qin et al. [65] studied the Global Salafi Jihad (GSJ) terrorist network
by applying techniques such as web structural mining, social network analysis, and
statistical analysis. The GSJ dataset was collected from several sources including
transcripts of court proceedings and several people statements. For each identified
terrorist they calculated degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures.
Then they used statistical analysis methods (e.g., link density, average node degree,
degree distribution) to study the organisation of the terrorist group and the overall
topological properties of the GSJ network. Finally, they applied PageRank algorithm
(adopted from the Web structural mining area) to study the communication patterns
in the GSJ network and identify the influential leaders within local terrorist groups.
This allows them to understand the hierarchy of the GSJ network. They evaluated
the results using knowledge obtained from domain experts.
Xu et al. [66] proposed algorithms to identify the strong ties between nodes in a
criminal network. They used shortest-path algorithms, priority-first-search (PFS)
and two-tree PFS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm in uncovering crime
investigative leads, they compared the PFS algorithms with the typical approach
used by crime investigators. Xu and Chen [67] developed CrimeNet framework to aid
2. Literature Review 19
law enforcement automatically extract criminal network knowledge. The framework
has four stages, which include network creation, partitioning, structural analysis,
and visualization. The framework allows for fast identification of central members in
the network, detection of subgroups, and extraction of interaction patterns between
these subgroups. They used methods such as social network analysis, hierarchical
clustering, and multidimensional scaling. For evaluating the system performance,
they performed a controlled lab experiment where they recruited 30 university
students with the task of detecting subgroups, identify interaction patterns, and
finally identify central members within the groups.
One of the very first initiatives to link the disciplines of network analysis and
crime intelligence is the work of Sparrow [68]. He used network analytic techniques
to identify vulnerabilities in criminal organisations. Lu et al. [16] empirically study
a hacker community called Shadowcrew, which is a known group for committing
identity theft and credit-card fraud. The authors study questions related to the
hacker network centralization, leadership and their influence on the group, and the
existence of different subgroups within the community. The data was collected from
newspapers, journals and law reviews that had a keyword match for Shadowcrew.
The methods used for the analysis was based on social graph analysis and the leaders
were identified using centrality measures. This study has a couple of limitations:
It is based on analysis of a single group, which means it can not be generalized.
Additionally, the network was built based on data gathered from text documents,
which does not capture the behaviour of the group.
As observed in the related literature, most existing work uses SNA related
measures to analyse cybercriminal groups. They mainly focus on detecting commu-
nities and influential members within the group by analysing the social structure
and their interactions. Very few consider the behavioural and temporal factors
when analysing these groups.
2. Literature Review 20
2.2.3 Intelligence Frameworks
Several previous efforts have worked on developing frameworks and tools to support
law enforcement by providing intelligence to facilitate the detection and analysis of
cybercrimes. Some of these frameworks focus on providing web crawling capabilities
for collecting criminal-related content [6971]. Zhang et al. [69] introduced the
first version of the Dark Web Forum Portal (DWFP). The system supports several
functions including data acquisition from different online forums, forum browsing
and searching, multiple language translation and network visualisation. The system
was later enhanced in a newer version, where several limitations were improved [72].
Moreover, Mei et al. [70] present a semi-automated web-crawler for collecting
extremist content using sentiment analysis. The system uses a decision tree that
classifies the web pages into a set of classes by combining methods of web-crawler,
parts-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. The content is classified into:
content with extremist sentiment (pro-extremist class); news sources (neutral class);
government or anti-extremist organisations (anti-extremist class); and content
unrelated to extremism.
The work of Bouchard et al. [71] presents a web-crawler called the Terrorism and
Extremism Network Extractor (TENE). The aim of TENE is to collect information
about extremist activities online and help differentiate between extremist websites
and other similar websites. The crawler starts at a user-specified webpage then
analyses the content and further follows any hyperlinks in the page. In order to
add the webpage to the analysis, it has to contain a set of user-defined keywords.
TENE extracts around 200 characters before and after the user-defined keywords
in order to determine the context in which the keywords were used. Although the
context extraction is done automatically, the analysis of the context is performed
manually. The COPLINK system [73, 74] was designed to aid law enforcement
in extracting information from police reports and provide an environment for
information-management in the intelligence domain. The system uses data-mining
techniques to build a concept space of objects and entities and their associations,
2. Literature Review 21
as well as social network analysis to study the relations between them. In addition,
the system provides visualisation functionality.
Furthermore, CrimeNet Explorer [67] is a framework for discovering criminal-
network knowledge that incorporates both structural analysis and visualisation
methods. Similar to COPLINK, the framework uses data gathered from crime
incident reports. The framework includes four main steps, network creation, network
partition, structural analysis, and network visualisation using multidimensional
scaling. Limitations of the CrimeNet Explorer framework include the use of concept
space to create the network, as this approach is fairly simplistic [67]. Additionally,
the framework only focuses on analysing networks of people (criminals) and does
not look at networks of people and entities (e.g., places, weapons). Concept
space method is used for network creation, and hierarchical clustering for network
partitioning. In the structural analysis stage subgroups are detected, interaction
patterns between these groups are identified, and the central members of these
subgroups are detected using a set of centrality measures. For network visualisation
multidimensional scaling (MDS), which is usually used to visualise distance and
similarity levels, is used to visualise the social networks.
The Isis toolkit [75] provides law enforcement with the ability to analyse digital
personas in cybercrime investigations. The main features supported by the toolkit
are establishing a stylistic language fingerprint, establishing the age and gender
of the person behind the persona, and finally establishing interaction patterns
between a set of digital personas. The toolkit combines techniques from corpus-
based natural-language analysis and authorship attribution. It presents the results
in a visualisation view, but it is based on a fairly simple, chart-like visualisations
with no support for user interaction. Furthermore, the toolkit is able to detect
deceptive personas (users with masquerading behaviour) with high degree of accuracy.
Jigsaw [76] is a visual analytic system that supports investigative analysis. It
provides visual representations of information extracted from textual documents
to aid analysts in better understanding the documents. The analysis is based
on extracting entities (e.g., person, place, date) and identifying connections and
2. Literature Review 22
relationships between them. Two entities are connected if they appear together
in one or more documents. The Jigsaw system consist of multiple views that
provide the user with different perspectives of the data. Although the Jigsaw system
provides rich visualisations and supports user interaction, it does not provide any
sophisticated data-mining or analytic capabilities.
Chen et al. [49] propose a semi-automated methodology for collecting and
analysing Dark Web information. The methodology consists of collecting, analysing
and visualising information gathered from multiple web sources. The data collection
is based on keyword search and websites of terrorist organisations. They also
used the back-link search function of Google to identify websites that point to
the terrorist organisations sites. Unrelated sites such as news and government
websites are manually filtered out, which resulted in total of 39 websites to be
included in the analysis phase. The analysis consists of clustering websites based
on similarity measure calculated based on the number of hyperlinks in website
A pointing to website B, and vice versa. Moreover, websites classification was
performed based on their affiliation with a specific terrorist group. However, the
classification was performed manually by reviewing the content of each website,
which is not efficient and is error-prone especially for large datasets. Two types were
adopted for visualisation, these are MDS and snowflake. The proposed methodology
was evaluated by a terrorism expert.
There are other frameworks that have more specialised purposes that can be
applied to the cybercrime-intelligence domain. For example, TwitterHitter [77]
which is focused on spatio-temporal analysis of Twitter data, such as the geo-
spatial information that includes time zone, and latitude/longitude of the twitter
user. The framework supports name/alias keyword search, which then provides a
spatio-temporal record of the target users activity. Additionally, the framework
provides relationship investigation analysis of users in a particular region, key players
identification and detection of existing communities. TwitterHitter provides analysts
with a map view that shows the location of hot-spots where people are tweeting
about a particular topic that match a given keyword. EVILCOHORT [78] is a
2. Literature Review 23
system that detects malicious online accounts that are controlled by cybercriminals.
The system relies on detecting criminal accounts by identifying the connection points
(IP addresses) used to access them. Typically, these IP addresses correspond to bots
controlled by the criminal. By identifying communities of accounts that are accessed
by a common set of computers (botnets) they were able to pro-actively detect these
malicious accounts even before they spread the malicious content (e.g., spam).
Moreover, there are several commercial and open-source tools available that
support open-source intelligence gathering. For example, Maltego [79] combines
intelligence gathering and forensics of open online information. It offers mining and
information gathering capabilities, with the ability to visualise the information in a
graph-like format. This allows the analyst to infer relations that may be otherwise
hidden. The tool uses the concept of entities and run different transformations on
them. An entity could be anything from websites, IP addresses, people, companies,
etc. and a transformation is a code that transform one entity to another. For
example, through a transformation a website entity may be transformed to the
IP address associated with that website. This will be visualised as new child
entity of the original website. Another example is Wynyard Advanced Crime
Analytics Platform [80], an off the shelf solution to help law enforcement reveal
actionable intelligence hidden in the data. The platform supports time, link,
geo-spatial, and mobile-device analysis.
2.2.4 Outstanding Research Challenges
The previous section discussed literature related to cybercrime intelligence focusing
on the detection and analysis of cybercrimes. We found that different techniques
are adopted to detect online cybercriminals such as machine learning and data
mining. In addition, a variety of analysis methods are used such as content analysis
and sentiment analysis to analyse their behaviour.
Furthermore, in order to evaluate the existing intelligence frameworks we compare
them against a set of criteria identified from our review of the literature. Table 2.2
presents a summary of this comparison. The frameworks included in the table
2. Literature Review 24
were selected based on the year of publication and number of citations, as well
as the relevance to our topic. The columns in Table 2.2 outlines the comparison
criteria: these are the data-sources used by the framework; type of cybercrime they
target; whether they aim at detection or analysis; support for data acquisition or
only operating on previously collected datasets; the types of analysis they use; and
finally whether or not the framework supports visual analytics. If this criterion is
satisfied, we also look at support for feedback and interaction from the analyst.
Through our analysis of the literature, we identify several gaps which future
research efforts should aim to fill. As observed in Table 2.2, none of the previously
developed frameworks cover all three stages related to detection, analysis, and
visualisation, and very few cut across both the detection and analysis stages. Thus,
most frameworks are focused on a single functionality in order to solve a particular
problem. This approach limits the investigator abilities as it narrows their view
when working on a particular case. Similarly, nearly all of the frameworks we
examined focus on only a single data-source (very few papers combine different
data-types), which make the framework dependant on a particular platform (e.g.,
Twitter) and the methods used are not generalisable to other data sources and
types. Additionally, in many cases cyber criminal groups make use of multiple
platforms to plan their crimes, thus, a platform-focused framework may fail in
providing the investigator with the whole picture.
Another area that is worth mentioning, although considered outside our scope,
is visual analytics for cybercrime. We find that most of the existing frameworks
either do not support any form of visualisation or provide very abstract and static
visualisations. Those who do provide visual representation of the analysis results
do not necessarily support user interaction with the framework. In order for the
investigator to be able to make sense out of the data and results they need to have
a way to inject their own expertise and hypothesis into the framework analytics.

2.3 Requirements for Intelligence Frameworks
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining the requirements of a system,
documenting these requirements, and maintaining them. It provides a framework
to identify stakeholders, understand what a system should do, and how it will
be used [82]. Two main types of requirements are typically identified, functional
and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements deal with concerns
related to the main functionality and behaviour of the system, while non-functional
requirements describe the non-behavioural aspects of a system such as usability
and performance.
Very few of the surveyed literature listed requirements for building intelligence
systems. However, many of them focus on distinguishing the cognitive processes that
underlie the intelligence analysis process and the associated cognitive biases [8385].
Such processes could directly help inform the appropriate framework requirements.
In order to understand the cognitive processes and biases it is first important to
know what are the main steps included within the intelligence analysis process.
Previous research proposed different cybercrime investigation models to guide law
enforcement through the investigation process [4, 86, 87]. Although these models
may seem different as they use different terminology to define the models activities,
most of them have similar processes.
At its core, the intelligence cycle consist of six main steps [87]: Direction,
Collection, Processing, Analysis, Dissemination, and Feedback. The Direction step
focus on identifying what are the questions to be answered, and plan the best course
of action to be followed. The Collection step deals with collecting information and
data (overtly and covertly) to help answer the identified questions. The Processing
step is when the heterogeneous data is reformatted into a common format for
future analysis. The Analysis step is the heart of the intelligence cycle where the
processed data is fit together in order to find answers and extract intelligence. The
Dissemination process is where the analysed data intelligence is shared with the
intended stakeholders. Finally, the Feedback step is where the stakeholders give
2. Literature Review 27
their views on the intelligence by either accepting it or coming back with more
questions to answer by repeating the process.
Elm et al. [83] describe the cognitive process for intelligence analysis as three
interacting cognitive functions: (1) Down-Collect which focus on the extraction of an
essential, representative sample from available data, (2) Conflict and Collaboration
focus on the construction of interpretations of the findings from the Down-Collect
process, and (3) Hypothesis Exploration focus on the construction of coherent
stories/hypotheses to explain the interpretations of the findings. Furthermore,
they identified five requirements for designing effective decision support system for
intelligence analysis. Observability, the ability to gather insight and allow the analyst
to see sequences and evolution over time, patterns and relationships. Directability,
the ability to direct/redirect resources, and priorities as situations change. Teamwork
with agents, the ability to coordinate, collaborate, and synchronise activity across
agents. Directed attention, the ability to re-orient focus which allows the team
of analysts to work in a coordinated manner. Finally, resilience, having failure
strategies, and being able to anticipate and adapt to surprise, and error.
Previous related literature [84, 85] has developed design guidelines that act
as recommendations for system designers in order to minimize the occurrence
of cognitive biases. Hillemann et al. [84] carried out a requirements elicitation
process through interviews, workshops and meetings with intelligence analysts in
law enforcement in order to identify their needs, tasks they perform, and current
issues with existing techniques. In many situations the prior beliefs and experiences
(i.e., biases) of the decision-maker (the analyst) influence his decisions, which may
lead to incorrect results. To avoid such issues, information should be presented
in a way that minimises cognitive biases and supports the sense-making process.
Typically, analysts deal with large volumes of data with the objective of extracting
insights and actionable intelligence to make informed decisions. Cognitive biases
may impact any step from the collection of raw data up to reaching actionable
intelligence [84]. From these interviews, requirements were gathered and relevant
biases that affect them were identified. The following biases have been recognised
2. Literature Review 28
in the literature in the context of intelligence analysis: 1) Confirmation bias, the
most well known cognitive bias in decision making [84], in which the analyst
selects information that match his initial expectation and hypothesis. 2) Evidence
evaluation bias, which is related to persistent impressions on discredited evidence,
evidence of uncertain accuracy, and missing information [85]. 3) Cause and effect
perception biases, in which the analyst is looking for causal patterns and rejecting
explanations of randomness or errors in the observed events [88].
Furthermore, existing research in the field of visual analytics and sense-making
has shed the light on problems that designers need to address in their designs in
order to support sense-making for information analysts. Wong et al. [89] identified
three key problems that impact the intelligence gathering process: (i) Blackholes
problem: the problem of representing missing data, (ii) Keyhole problem: the
problem of being able to access and view only a small part of a large dataset or only
part of a problem; and (iii) Brown worms problem: the problem of representing
misleading or deceptive data. These three problems should be taken into account
when designing systems for intelligence analysis.
In summary, the elicited requirements for cybercrime intelligence frameworks
should include as part of its functional requirements support for the six steps of the
intelligence cycle previously described. Additionally, as functional requirements the
framework should allow collection of data and evidence, and allow the user to form
connections and interpretations of the gathered evidence. Finally, the framework
should be designed to mitigate the cognitive biases as much as possible. For example,
as a non-functional requirement the system should have a clear separate view listing
the gathered evidence, ranked based on their accuracy, to keep the analyst focused
on tangible evidence and avoid internal biases.
2.4 Understanding Online Radicalisation
In this section, we focus on the topic of online radicalisation and review existing
literature in the area. But first we need to define what we mean by online
radicalisation. The U.S. Department of Justice defines online radicalisation as
2. Literature Review 29
the process by which an individual is introduced to an ideological message and
belief system that encourages movement from mainstream beliefs toward extreme
views, primarily through the use of online media, including social networks such
as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube [90]. There are several incidents of violent
extremism that took place world-wide in the past few year. They stem from
different ideological movements, such as religion (e.g., ISIS) and white nationalism
(e.g., Alternative-Right). These groups utilise the Internet and online platforms
to radicalise individuals and gather supporters.
According to experts, individuals are not radicalised by viewing a single video
or propaganda, but it takes time and it occur gradually through constant exposure
to extremist views. Realising the danger caused by the spread of violent extremism
and radicalisation content online, and how it is becoming a major challenge to
societies worldwide, many researchers have attempted to study the online behaviour
of a number of extremist and terrorist groups.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is one of the leading terrorist groups
that utilise social media platforms and invest huge resources in creating digital
media to spread their ideology and propaganda [38]. This is achieved by regular
publications of a number of propaganda magazines, namely, Dabiq and Rumiyah, as
well as a number of high-end quality videos and images promoting their activities [91].
Previous research looked at analysing the propaganda distributed by ISIS online and
focused on understanding the narrative and logic used in these magazines [38, 91,
92]. For example, Ingram [91, 92] studies the strategic differences between Inspire
magazine published by Al-Qaeda group and Dabiq magazine published by ISIS. He
looks at how images, narrative, and counter-narrative are used to affect the readers
perceptions and polarise their support. Additionally, Allendorfer et al. [38] examined
the strategies used by ISIS propaganda videos and compared it with those published
by the U.S. Department of State to counter that propaganda narrative in order to
evaluate how the structure and content of videos may be affecting the recipients.
2. Literature Review 30
2.4.1 Process of Online Radicalisation
Several research efforts attempted to study the process towards radicalisation in
the online world. Torok et al. [93] used a grounded theory approach to develop an
explanatory model for the radicalisation process utilising concepts of psychiatric
power. Their findings show that the process typically starts with social isolation of
individuals. This isolation seem to be self imposed as individuals tend to spend long
time engaging with radical content. This leads to the concept of homophily, the
tendency to interact and associate with similar others. Through constant interaction
with like-minded people, an individual gradually strengthen their mindset and reach
more extreme levels. Similarly, they start to feel as being part of a group with strong
group identity which lead to group polarisation. In psychology, group polarisation
occurs when discussion leads the group to adopt actions that are more extreme
than the initial actions of the individual group members [94].
The National Police Service Agency of the Netherlands developed a model to
describe the phases a jihadist may pass through before committing an act of
terrorism [95]. These four sequential phases of radicalism are: 1) Preliminary phase
where the individual experience a crisis of confidence in the authorities. 2) Social
alienation phase where the individual feel alienated from the rest of the society,
which increases their susceptibility for the extremist ideology. 3) Jihadization phase
where the individual have strong involvement with radical groups and willingness
to support them. Finally, 4) Jihad extremism phase is the last phase where the
individual is prepared to use violence and commit terrorist acts.
Furthermore, since the process to radicalisation involve a lot of psychological
and personality changes, an interesting angle to analyse propaganda material is to
look at the psychological properties conveyed through the text. This is typically
referred to as psycholinguistics, where one examines how the use of the language
can be indicative of different psychological and personality states [96]. Examples
of such properties include the OCEAN model [97] that include five components
(big-five): Openness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
In addition, emotions, sensitivity, and personal drives are all examples of properties
2. Literature Review 31
that can be inferred from written communication. The social psychologist, Michael
Billing, is one of the advocates of this approach, building on the theory that the
choice of language is reflective of ones psychology [98]. A number of studies
in the literature have demonstrated the potential and effectiveness of extracting
psychological and personality properties from online communications [99101].
One of the most used tools to automate the process of analysing text and
extracting such properties is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
tool [102]. LIWC includes a semantic dictionary to measure properties for different
categories such as cognitive, emotional, and personal drives. This approach has
been used in the literature to study the behaviour of different groups and to predict
their personality and psychological states [103105]. For instance, it was used to
predict depression [104], identify emotional expression in cancer narratives [103].
In addition, more recently it has been applied to identify different properties of
extremist groups to uncover their targets as well as the intentions behind their
recruitment campaigns [106].
2.4.2 Detection of Online Radicalisation
In the recent years, there has been an increase in online accounts advocating and
supporting extremist groups such as alt-right and ISIS [107, 108]. This phenomenon
has attracted researchers to study their online existence, and research ways to
automatically detect these accounts and limit their spread. Ashcroft et al. [28]
make an attempt to automatically detect Jihadist messages on Twitter. They adopt
a machine-learning method to classify tweets as ISIS supporters or not. They focus
on English tweets that contain a reference to a set of predefined English hashtags
related to ISIS. Three different classes of features are used, including stylometric
features, temporal features and sentiment features. However, one of the main
limitations of their approach is that it is highly dependant on the data.
Rowe et al. [29] focused on studying Europe-based Twitter accounts in order to
understand what happens before, during, and after they exhibit pro-ISIS behaviour.
They define such behaviour as sharing of pro-ISIS content and/or using pro-ISIS
2. Literature Review 32
terms. To achieve this, they use term-based approach such that a user is considered
to exhibit a radicalisation behaviour, if he uses more pro-ISIS terms than anti-ISIS
terms. While such approach seems effective in distinguishing radicalised users, it
is unable to properly deal with lexical ambiguity (i.e., polysemy). Furthermore,
Kaati et al. [109] focused on detecting twitter users who are involved with Media
Mujahideen, a jihadist group who distribute propaganda content online. They
used machine learning approach using a combination of data-dependent and data-
independent features. Similar to [29] they used textual features as well as temporal
features to classify tweets, and twitter accounts. The experiment reported in this
work was based on a limited set of twitter accounts, which makes it difficult to
generalise the results for a more complex and realistic scenario.
Weir et al. [110] attempted to classify crawled web-pages to pro-extremist,
neutral, and anti-extremist using a combination of language analysis and data
mining techniques. They used two different approaches on the same dataset, one
based on keywords, part of speech tagging, and sentiment while the other approach
was based on quantitative frequency analysis of syntactic features extracted from
the web-pages. The reported results show that the approach based on frequency
analysis yielded higher classification accuracy. Klausen et al. [111] used a different
approach to detect pro-extremist accounts on twitter that is not based on textual
features. They developed a behavioural model that is used to identify new extremist
accounts and predict if it will be suspended by twitter for extremist activity. They
used logistic regression using network-based features together with account-based
features extracted from the user profile.
A number of recent works have looked at identifying different sensors for detecting
potential online radicals or pro-extremist users [112115]. For instance, the authors
in [112, 113] looked at signals for detecting lone-wolf terrorists and violent extremists
online. They suggest that those lone-actor terrorists leak online traces on their
intent which can be utilised to predict attacks and prevent them in a proactive
manner. Similarly, Cohen et al. [113] suggest there are a set of linguistic markers
that can be used to detect radical violence in social media. In a recent study by
2. Literature Review 33
Williams et al. [114], they found that there is an association between aggregated
online open source data and aggregated police-recorded crime data. In this research
they used Twitter as the online source of data and the premise is that tweets can
be used as sensors reporting on crimes occurring in a users local environment.
Furthermore, Alsaedi et al. [115] present a framework for detecting real-world events
from Arabic Twitter posts. They use an integrated classification-clustering system
that groups tweets discussing similar topics. The framework does not look at
behavioural features and mainly considers textual, and spatio-temporal features.
Finally, we will look into more literature related to detection of online radicalisation
and present a comparison with our proposed approach in Chapter 7.
2.5 Summary
In this chapter, we presented an overview of the existing literature relevant to the
key topics discussed in this thesis. We have also highlighted the research gaps in
cybercrime intelligence and online radicalisation. We will describe how some of
these gaps are addressed throughout this thesis.
Research Methodology
3.1 Introduction
The research conducted in this thesis has a multi-disciplinary nature as it cuts across
different disciplines, including computer science, criminology, behaviour science, and
psychology. We adopt mixed methods to answer the different research questions
outlined in Chapter 1. In this chapter, we provide a high-level description of the core
research methods used throughout this thesis. However, the detailed methodological
steps followed are included in each subsequent chapter.
3.2 Qualitative Methods
Data Collection  Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews are different methods
to collect data from users. Due to the sensitive topic of this research, it is difficult to
gather rich detailed information from experts in the field of cybercrime intelligence
through general means (e.g., surveys). They are not likely to participate and share
detailed views without us gaining their trust and confidence. Also, we intend to
collect detailed data to capture practitioners experiences and needs, which can
only be achieved through direct communication. Therefore, we chose to collect
information by a combination of questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire
was used first to gather generic information about the participants role and expertise
3. Research Methodology 35
within the field of cybercrime. Additionally, it acted as a means for us to assess their
applicability to participate in the interview process. We then conducted face-to-face
semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions, to allow the interviewees
to elaborate on their experiences when dealing with different incidents, provide
lengthy and descriptive answers, and make them express their views in their own
terms. This study is presented in Chapter 4.
Data Analysis  All interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed
to facilitate the analysis. For the extraction of qualitative findings, we adopted
a thematic analysis [116] approach. The thematic analysis focuses on identifying
common themes within the data. A theme is defined as a recurrent feature or
topic describing particular perceptions and experiences relevant to the research
questions [117]. It allows for theoretical freedom, as it provides a flexible and useful
research tool, which can yield a rich and in-depth account of the data [118]. We
adopted thematic analyses with a mixture of deductive and inductive approaches to
identify themes and analyse the interview data [117]. While the deductive approach
allows us to guide the flow of analysis according to our aims and predefined generic
themes from the literature, inductive analysis allows us to incorporate additional
themes that are new and arise from the data [116]. This allows us to generate findings
from the bottom up to be inductive and identify patterns based on participants
expressed reasoning. This is in contrast to using rigid pre-set criteria, which may or
may not map to participants perspectives. We used a specialised qualitative analysis
software package (i.e., NVivo1.) to perform the coding and support our analyses.
Coding We followed the popular approach outlined by Ritchie et al. [119]. We
began by familiarising ourselves with the data by parsing through the transcripts in
detail. This enabled initial patterns to emerge. We then started coding by assigning
annotations to reoccurring ideas. This was an iterative process where, at the end, we
grouped related codes into themes. Moreover, since participants hold different roles
and are associated with different types of organisations, they had some unique views.
1https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home
3. Research Methodology 36
As such, we also included themes that were salient to a particular organisations and
roles. By including these deviant cases [120], our themes should represent the data.
Reliability  Since the coding process was carried out by a single coder, to
mitigate any misinterpretation and biases, we performed a number of iterations of
the coding process spread over a long period. This allowed us to refine the coding and
the produced themes, thus increasing the robustness of the process. Furthermore,
the sample size of participants in the study presented in Chapter 4 is in line with in-
depth interview guidelines [121]. As explained by Crouch and McKenzie, an in-depth
interview study is one which scrutinises the dynamic qualities of a situation (rather
than elucidating the proportionate relationships among its constituents) [121].
As such, having a small number of participants when conducting an exploratory
in-depth study has little bearing on the reliability of the findings.
3.3 Quantitative Methods
Different types of quantitative measures were used in this research. In this section,
we describe the key measures used and provide justification for their selection.
Questionnaire Analysis  Quantitative methods were used to analyse
questionnaire data that were collected from participants in the study documented
in Chapter 4. The questionnaire included categorical data which was analysed
using simple descriptive statistical methods. Also, it included a set of assertions to
collect participants views. The Likert scale [122] is considered an efficient method
for collecting data related to participants attitudes [123]. As such, it was used to
capture participants level of agreement with a set of statements and requirements
gathered from the literature. The scale categories include: 1 strongly disagree,
2 disagree, 3 neutral, 4 agree, and 5 strongly agree. To avoid forced choices, it is
important to include a neutral response so as not to coerce an answer. We calculated
the percentages of participants attitudes towards each of these statements.
Measures  Several quantitative measures were used throughout this research.
This included similarity measures, distance measures, and significance tests. In
the following section, we define each of these measures.
3. Research Methodology 37
Cosine Similarity. In the study described in Chapter 6, we compare topics
of different propaganda magazines in order to identify how similar their topics are.
Many measures can be used to measure the similarity between two documents. We
opted to use cosine similarity as it has been identified in the literature as being most
appropriate for information retrieval and text mining tasks. It measures the cosine
of the angle between two vector representations of the documents. The smaller
the angle, the higher the cosine similarity [124]. An important property of this
measure is that it gives a similarity score for two documents based on how similar
their subject matter is, regardless of the length of the documents. Thus, this makes
it suitable for our task of comparing variable length documents.
Manhattan Distance. In Chapter 7, we describe an experiment that aimed to
detect radical tweets. As part of the experiment, we measured the distance between
a users psychological profile and a high dimensional radical profile. In such a case,
Manhattan distance (L1 norm) is preferable to other types of measures such as
Euclidean distance, due to its applicability for high dimensional data [125].
Significance Tests  These tests were used to assess whether a statistically
significant difference exists between multiple groups. In Chapter 8, we studied the
properties of extremist propaganda published by different groups (AL-Qaeda and
Alt-Right). We compared these properties against the ISIS propaganda and a control
group (news articles). To determine if the differences were statistically significant,
we used appropriate significance tests. We examined certain characteristics of the
different groups to select a suitable test. These were the number of data records in
each group, the variance of each group, and number of groups to compare. In case
of comparing two groups, if both had the same variance and had the same number
of records we performed an equal variance (independent) t-test [126]. However, if
both had a variable number of records and different variance, then we performed an
unequal variance t-test. If the samples were not drawn from a normal distribution,
we used the non-parametric statistical test Mann-Whitney U test [127]. In case of
comparing three or more groups, the KruskalWallis H test [128] were employed.
3. Research Methodology 38
3.4 Computational Analyses
Methods of online research, in the context of social research, can be divided into
obtrusive and unobtrusive research [129]. Obtrusive research, also called reactive
research, is when the researcher has direct contact with research subjects. It includes
surveys, interviews, focus-groups, and field observations. Meanwhile, unobtrusive
research is when the researcher has no contact with the research subjects. It includes
two main types: secondary data analysis methods and content analysis. In our
research documented in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, we use unobtrusive content analysis
methods, which include quantitative web content analysis and social media network
analysis. Such analysis is performed through different methods, including Natural
Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Social Network Analysis (SNA).
In the next section, we describe the main methodological concepts we use.
3.4.1 Natural Language Processing
NLP explores how computers can be used to understand and manipulate natural
language text to accomplish a desired task [130]. NLP consists of a sub-field of
artificial intelligence, information engineering, and computer science. Applications
of NLP include machine translation, sentiment analysis, content analysis, and
summarisation. To computationally analyse text, we need to transform it to a
representation that can be processed by different algorithms. In the following, we
describe the main techniques we used in this research.
Bag of Words (BOW)  A BoW model is a simple and effective represen-
tation of text that reflects the number of word occurrences. Using this approach,
we focus on the histogram of the words in the text rather than where they occur
in the text. The intuition here is that if two documents include a similar set of
words, then they are considered similar [131].
TF-IDF  Short for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, which
is a statistical method used to measure how important a word is to a document
in a corpus. The TF-IDF value increases in proportion to the number of times a
word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the
3. Research Methodology 39
corpus that contain the word; this allows for adjustments as some words, such as
articles and prepositions, generally appear more frequently. As a result, common
words in a small group of documents will have higher TF-IDF numbers [132].
Nonetheless, TF-IDF does not account for the semantic relations of the words;
this is addressed by the following method.
Word Embedding  It is a real-valued vector representation of text such
that words that have the same meaning will have a similar representation. Vector
values are learned using neural networks [133] and require a large amount of text.
There are many pre-trained embeddings available that are already trained on a
large corpus, which can be used to seed the model and update later based on a
specialised corpus. Different algorithms can be used to learn a word embedding.
In the following, we describe the most common techniques and highlight their
advantages and disadvantages.
Word2Vec [134] is a statistical method developed at Google for learning word
embedding from text corpus. It uses skip-gram model [135], which is an efficient
method that does not involve dense matrix multiplications for learning vector
representations of words from unstructured text. It has become the de-facto standard
for developing pre-trained word embedding. As demonstrated in [134], semantic
information is preserved when performing operations on words vectors. A popular
example used to illustrate this feature is: King - Man + Woman, which results in
Queen. This method is considered the most effective in preserving such semantic
relationships between words. However, it requires a large amount of training corpus.
FastText [136] is an extension of the skip-gram model [135] developed at
Facebook, to learn representations for character n-grams. This method represents
words by the sum of their character n-gram vectors. As such, it can capture
sub-word information. This feature makes this approach capable of handling
out-of-vocabulary words (words that did not appear in the training data), by
constructing the representations from its character n-grams. However, studies
looking at comparing the representation of the semantic relationship between words,
found that skip-gram Word2Vec models perform better in capturing such relations.
3. Research Methodology 40
As a result, after testing both models on our corpus, we opted to use Word2Vec
model to build a semantic representation of the radical propaganda as it better
captured the semantic relations of our corpus.
3.4.2 Machine Learning
Machine Learning can be defined as the process of automated detection of meaningful
patterns in the data [137]. Machine learning models are categorised as follows:
supervised (labelled data) and unsupervised models (unlabelled data). In this
research, we use supervised machine learning methods and perform classification
tasks to identify radicalisation activities. In the following, we describe the main
algorithms and evaluation metrics we use.
Classification Algorithms  Random Forest and Neural Networks algo-
rithms have been identified in the literature to produce the best performances
for text classification tasks [138, 139]. Random Forest (RF) [140] is an ensemble
learning method that creates multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets.
Using a majority-wins model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.
Thus, it outperforms decision trees as it has a hierarchical structure. This allows
RF to be able to model non-linear decision boundaries. RF is scalable and is robust
to outliers. Neural Networks (NN) are known to perform well when applied to tasks
related to image recognition and natural language processing [138, 141]. However,
they usually tend to require large amounts of data to train.
Evaluation Metrics  We use multiple evaluation metrics to assess the
performance of the classification model. Accuracy. looks at the overall performance
of the model by measuring the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by
the total number of observations. Recall is considered a measure of effectiveness in
retrieving positive classes [142]. It helps when the cost of a false negative is high.
For example, it measures how many radical tweets we can detect out of all the
radical tweets in the data. Precision, on the other hand, is a measure of purity as
it considers the number of retrieved positive classes that are labelled as positive
class [142]. It helps when the costs of false positives are high. For instance, it
3. Research Methodology 41
measures how many radical tweets we can detect without falsely accusing anyone.
Thus, if we identify every single tweet as radical, we will expose all radical tweets
and obtain high recall, but at the same time, we will call everyone in the population
a radical and obtain low precision. F-measure is the average of both precision and
recall. When predicting the probability of a binary outcome, the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve (ROC curve) is a useful tool to evaluate the performance of
the model. It plots false-positive rate against true-positive rate. We use the area
under the ROC curve (AUC) to summarize the performance of the model.
3.4.3 Social Network Analysis (SNA)
In graph theory, centrality measures identify the most important vertices in a
graph [143]. In analysing social networks for identifying a users behaviour and
their influence level, several SNA metrics have been deemed useful. SNA metrics
can be divided into node-level metrics (e.g, degree centrality), and network-level
metrics (e.g., network density). SNA is an important tool that facilitates the
identification of properties related to criminal and terrorist networks using traces
of collected communications. In the following, we give a brief description of the
main metrics used in this research.
Degree Centrality  Measures the number of direct links a given node has.
The higher the score of a node, the more connected the node is in the network.
In a directed graph, it is also useful to measure the in-degree and out-degree to
identify the direction of influence/information flow. For example, in the context of
a retweet network, users with high in-degree values represent the role of information
generators, while users with high out-degree values correspond to information
distributor role. While degree centrality focuses on the number of direct connections
a node has, it does not consider the global localisation the node has in the network
and does not take into consideration how powerful those connections are in the
graph. Another centrality measure that focuses on the influence of the connected
nodes is Eigenvector Centrality which is described below.
3. Research Methodology 42
Eigenvector Centrality  A node that has a high Eigenvector score is one
that is adjacent to nodes that themselves have high scores [143]. This centrality is
useful to identify which nodes can spread information to many other nodes quickly.
Betweenness Centrality  This is a measure that indicates if a node has an
intermediary role in the network (i.e., broker role) by looking at all the shortest
paths that pass through a particular node. In other words, nodes with high
betweenness centrality mean that they have the most control over information
flow in the network [144].
PageRank  This is a variant of Eigenvector centrality [145], which can
be used to uncover influential nodes whose reach extends beyond their direct
connections. One main difference to Eigenvector centrality is that it considers
the link weight and direction when calculating the score [146]. Therefore, it is
more suitable for directed graphs.
HITS Hypertext Induced Topic Selection also called Authorities and Hubs [147].
Similar to PageRank, it is used in directed graphs to capture the importance of
nodes. Nodes have high authority values if they are pointed to by many nodes
with high hub values. Similarly, nodes have high hub values if they point to nodes
with high authority values. In an information network, this measure indicates how
valuable the information carried by each node is.
3.5 Ethics
Formal ethical approval was obtained from the Central University Research Ethics
Committee at the University of Oxford. Besides, careful adherence to research
ethics guidelines were followed before, during and after the study, the reporting
of results, and the storage of the collected data.
In the expert interviews study (Chapter 4), the process of participants consent
took place at the beginning of each study. Participants were presented with an
information sheet that described the aim of the study, information on the handling
and anonymisation of their data, processes for withdrawal of their data, and
contact details should they have any concerns. Data related to the participating
3. Research Methodology 43
individuals and organisations were anonymised in any published results, as per
participants requests.
Furthermore, in our radicalisation study, all user-related data were anonymised.
All collected data related to extremist material was carefully handled and stored.
Given the sensitive nature of the topic, we followed the university guidance on
research involving security-sensitive research material, and measures have been put
in place to consider the psychological safety of the main researcher.
3.6 Summary
In this chapter, we outlined our high-level methodology. We justified the usage of a
range of quantitative and qualitative methods. We also outlined the computational
methods used to perform content analysis. Finally, we described the ethical
considerations followed in this research.
Understanding Cybercrime Investigations:
Process, Needs, & Challenges
4.1 Introduction
Cybercrime investigators are facing numerous difficulties trying to keep the pace
with the increase in numbers and the evolution of techniques used by cybercriminals.
Previous studies suggest that the methods and processes typically used by law
enforcement when investigating traditional crimes do not necessarily apply in
the cyber world [7, 8]. Thus, there is a need to adopt a different process and
build a new set of skills and knowledge in order to be able to mitigate these
technologically advanced crimes. This is essential mainly as the cybercriminals are
usually technologically-aware and are constantly adapting and developing new tools
to allow them to stay ahead of law enforcement investigations [911].
While there are many research efforts focused on understanding and analysing
the tactics used by cybercriminals [11, 20, 21], very little research exists that focuses
on understanding the processes, challenges, and needs of law enforcement. With
the majority of the research literature focusing on challenges related to the digital
forensics side of cybercrime investigations [148150], few focus on studying the
challenges related to the holistic process of cybercrime investigations. Additionally,
current cybercrime literature, especially those considering the technical side, tend to
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 45
primarily focus on proposing and developing new solutions and tools that researchers
believe are required by cybercrime investigators. However, little research in the
literature focuses on understanding the needs and challenges that are actually being
faced by the investigators. The novelty of this study is that it attempts to bridge
that gap, thereby setting a better foundation for future research in the field.
The majority of the literature attempted to use surveys with close-ended
questions as a means to collect data related to how police officers deal with
cybercrimes [3032]. One advantage of using this approach is collecting answers
from a large number of participants. However, a disadvantage is that it limits the
ability to capture insights and understand the reasons behind the chosen answers.
Therefore, we decided to conduct a qualitative study using a combination of direct
questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The questionnaires were used to
gather generic information about the participants role and expertise within the
field of cybercrime, while the interviews gathered in-depth data.
Additionally, related literature studied the views of a particular type of par-
ticipants dealing with cybercrimes (e.g., local police officers). Very few looked
at this issue from multiple viewpoints of different participant types (i.e., local
officers, regional and national cybercrime units). In this study, we address this
gap by interviewing participants dealing with cybercrimes from the government-
sector (including local and regional units) as well as from the private sector. We
interviewed a total of ten experts who hold varying roles and responsibilities,
including operational and managerial positions. This gives us diversity in the
collected viewpoints and richness of data.
This chapter makes the following contributions to the cybercrime, socio-technical,
and usable-security fields:
1. Establishes an empirical understanding of some of the key processes used by
cybercrime investigators within government (e.g., police and law enforcement)
and private (security intelligence) sectors.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 46
2. Identifies a set of outstanding and important challenges (practical, procedural
and usability-based) faced by investigators while combating cybercrimes and
gathering intelligence. This is useful in terms of directing future research
towards more user-centric approaches, practices and systems for investigators.
3. Presents recommendations for areas of improvement associated with the
processes of intelligence sharing, reporting cybercrimes, skills and training,
and improving the usability of cybercrime systems.
4.2 Methods
In order to gain an understanding of the different socio-technical challenges and needs
associated with investigating cybercrime incidents, multiple qualitative methods can
be used. Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews are all possible methods that can be
used to achieve this [119]. However, our aim is to understand the problem in-depth
and also the needs from multiple stakeholders perspectives, such as government
(law enforcement agents), and private sectors (security intelligence and consultancy
companies). Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of this research, it is difficult
to gather such detailed information from experts in the field by general means
(e.g., surveys) as they are not likely to participate without us gaining their trust
and confidence using direct communication. Another viable option is to rely on
observations, which would provide rich data, however, there are many difficulties
inherent in observing this kind of activity directly. Therefore, we rely on participants
reports via a combination of direct questionnaires and interviews to collect our data.
4.2.1 Study Design
We designed the study to be conducted in two phases: first, we used a questionnaire
to gather generic information about the participants role and expertise within the
field of cybercrime. This acts as a means for us to assess their applicability to
participate in the interview process and be familiar with their area of expertise.
Second, we conducted face-to-face, semi-structured interviews using open-ended
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 47
questions. This allowed the interviewees to elaborate on their experiences when
dealing with different cybercrime incidents, provide lengthy and descriptive answers,
whilst also allowing us to ask probing and clarifying questions where needed.
The questionnaire focused on collecting information to give us a general overview
of the participants role, expertise, and technical capabilities. In addition, we used
the questionnaire to capture participants views regarding a set of assertions related
to the process of investigating cybercrimes. We used a five point Likert Scale to
capture how strongly they agree/disagree with each statement. The final set of
questions and assertions used are summarised in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.
After collecting the questionnaire responses, we proceeded with conducting the
face-to-face, semi-structured interviews. These interviews ranged from 45-min to 1.5
hours long, depending on the availability of the participant and the level of detail
they were able to provide. We formed a set of predefined questions informed by
our review of the literature to guide the interview, but we also asked some probing
questions when needed [151]. All participants were provided an information sheet
describing the project prior to participating. All interviews were audio recorded
and then manually transcribed producing transcripts for each participant discussion.
Additionally, to ensure the validity of the questionnaire and the interview questions,
we discussed them with a subject matter expert and incorporated appropriate
feedback before conducting the study.
4.2.2 Interview Questions Design
When designing the interview questions we focused on four main themes to
capture the socio-technical aspects relevant to fighting cybercrimes, as described
below. These themes emerged from our understanding of the literature and
aims to gather details regarding the incident, the process, the people, and the
technology. An overview of the guiding questions are summarised in Table 4.3
and are described below.

The focus of this theme was to understand which types of cybercrime incidents
were dealt with by the respective organisation, the volume of incidents reported,
and whether they had the capacity and resources to investigate all reported
incidents. If not all incidents are investigated, we wanted to identify the filtering
or scoring mechanisms they used to determine which incidents to investigate.

A complete intelligence gathering life cycle should consist of five stages:
data acquisition, detection, analysis, visualisation, feedback from the analyst
Visual presentations of data within current intelligence tools do not
have adequate interactivity to support data exploration
Data visualisation is an essential method for communicating
findings to colleagues, and documenting decisions.
The investigation of large volume of data, and the discovery of patterns
within data, can be enabled through visual data presentation.
When formulating/testing hypotheses
analysts search for patterns or trends from data.
Analysts usually uses a series of filters to reduce
data and find relevant intelligence.
Keyword-based search and analysis techniques are
not enough to identify the intent of the text (message/post).
Intelligence gathering tools should provide the analyst with the ability
to distinguish between different levels of uncertainty in the data
(e.g., assign confidence scores to each data item)
Intelligence gathering tools should
be platform-independent.
Intelligence gathering tools should be scalable
and able to handle big-data.
Analytical process consist of Six steps:
1-Problem definition, 2-Hypotheses generation,
3-Information collection, 4-Hypotheses evaluation,
5- Selecting the most likely hypothesis,

Finally, the method by which victims report cybercrimes and how such interaction
occur was explored.
Theme 2: Investigation Process
After understanding the types of incidents investigated, we then explored the
actual process used to investigate a given incident. Under this theme, we collected
information on the different tasks performed, if the investigation process was
iterative, and whether it was a reactive or proactive process. Understanding the
details of the investigation process will allow us to map the different steps performed
and identify, where applicable, how each step can benefit from technology adoption.
Theme 3: Investigation Team
This theme sought to understand the dynamics within the investigation team. How
big is the team that works on any single case? What role does each team member
typically have? Are they all located in the same location? Such questions will
allow us to ascertain if there is a need for processes, systems or tools to support
collaborative investigation sessions. This relates to the field of Computer-Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW), which focuses on describing how collaborative activities
and cooperation can be supported by computer systems [152].
Theme 4: Tool Support
This theme covered the different tools currently being used by the investigation
teams. The aim was to understand what advantages were gained from using these
tools, the perceived usability of the tools, their availability, and effectiveness at
supporting the investigation tasks. We also asked about the perceived limitations
of the tools, which is important to be able to enhance these limitations and provide
better support to investigators.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 52
4.2.3 Recruitment of Experts
Since our aim is to gather the perspectives of practitioners working in various
organisations who deal with investigating and mitigating cybercrimes, we targeted
a population from both government and private sectors. Participants were recruited
based on their knowledge and experience in investigating cybercrimes and gathering
intelligence. Government sector organisations that handle cybercrimes have a
hierarchical structure that consists of multiple levels, including local cybercrime
units, regional cybercrime units, and national cybercrime units. We aimed at
recruiting participants from each of these levels.
We used a snowball sampling approach [153] where we asked initial participants to
recommend candidates from their network. The recruited participants held different
roles; some possessed technical experience while others held more managerial
positions. This diverse sample of experiences and backgrounds was important to
capture different perspectives on the topic.
Reaching out to professionals working in this field is a difficult task given the
sensitivity of the topic. Many of the individuals we contacted were very busy and
could not afford the time to conduct a full face-to-face interview. In total, we
interviewed ten experts, six from UK law enforcement, and four from the private
sector, one of whom had ten years of experience working for law enforcement before
moving to the private sector. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, all the
participating organisations and individuals requested to remain anonymous.
4.2.4 Data Analysis
The data collected from the questionnaires consist of open-ended text (e.g., par-
ticipants role) and categorical data (e.g., types of cybercrimes). The categorical
data was analysed using descriptive statistics by calculating the frequencies for
each category. The results from the questionnaires played a role in guiding the
discussion during the interview session to areas that matched the participants
experience. Likert scale results for the assertion statements were analysed by
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 53
calculating the mode of the most frequent responses and measured the distribution
of responses i.e. (% that agree, disagree).
To analyse the interviews data, thematic analysis was chosen as it best fits
the exploratory nature of this study as described in Chapter 3. We began our
analysis with initial coding using a deductive approach by coding the data to a
pre-defined set of codes relevant to our research interest. These codes correspond to
the four themes described earlier, i.e., cybercrime incidents, investigation process,
investigation team, and technology. Then, through an iterative analysis approach,
the coder immerses herself in the data and assign new codes where appropriate
to the recurring ideas. Using this approach makes the findings more robust as it
allows us to test emerging themes against new data.
An example of our coding process is shown in the quote below, where the
participant was asked about their impression of utilising automated tools in their
investigation of different cybercrimes. This question falls under the technology
and tool support generic theme.
I think fully automated tools need to be introduced into our work. Purely because
you know budget cuts. So theres going to be no more resources. So we need these
tools, scripts, data mining tools to go through everything we see.
We initially assigned the code impression of automated tools to highlight the
participants views on the topic during the first coding round. Then, in our
subsequent iterations, we assigned the code drivers for automation and resources
availability as they also mentioned the lack of resources and budget cuts as reasons
for their views. Overall, we identified 35 codes in our data, that were then refined
and grouped into themes.
4.3 Results
Through the analysis of the interview data, we attempt to understand different
aspects connected to the process followed when investigating different cybercrimes.
Several themes appeared across the interview data that show how private and
public sectors carry out their investigations. In this section, we first present
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 54
the demographics of interview participants. Second, we discuss results from the
collected questionnaires. These give us an idea regarding the expertise of the
sampled participants. Third, we report results from the interview analysis relating
to the different identified themes.
4.3.1 Participants Demographics
We interviewed 10 participants who are experts in cybercrime investigations.
The participants work in the government (6 participants) and private sector
(4 participants). All participants are based in the United Kingdom. Of the
participants, 4 are intelligence analysts; 2 are intelligence researchers; 1 is a sergeant;
1 is a detective; 2 are law enforcement agents dealing with cybercrimes (1 is
currently working as a consultant). The participants are associated with 5 different
organisations: 2 private sector, and 3 government sector. The government sector
organisations tackled cybercrime at different levels, including local, and regional
forces. This allowed us to collect the viewpoints from experts working at tackling
cybercrimes from different levels. The private sector organisations deal with security
investigations and intelligence gathering from open and closed sources to provide
clients with threat intelligence.

participants identities, we grouped them into 4 groups based on their roles and
level of experience. Table 4.4 summarises the different groups by providing the

Average Years of Experience
Figure 4.1: Participants average years of experience with cybercrimes per group
have worked in (i.e., private, or government). We note that each group consist
of a minimum of 2 members.
4.3.2 Questionnaires Results
The questionnaires were designed to collect data that can paint a picture of the
participants experience, role, types of cybercrimes they investigated, and their
technical capabilities. Additionally, it was used as a tool to obtain the participants
views on a set of assertion statements related to cybercrime investigations.
Years of Experience The average years of experience participants had was
3.5 years working in investigating cybercrimes. The minimum was 1 year and
the maximum was up to 10 years of experience. They held roles that ranged
from intelligence analysts, consultants, lead analysts, researchers, and investigation
officers. This generates multiple viewpoints and allows us to gather requirements
from different angles (Figure 4.1).
Types of Cybercrimes A list of different types of cybercrimes were pre-
sented to the participants and we asked them to select the crimes that they have
experience dealing with. The results were distributed between cyber-enabled and
cyber-dependent crimes, with the majority having experience dealing with cyber-
fraud, spam, hacktivism, and child pornography. Additionally, participants noted
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 56
that after the 2017 WannaCry ransomware, the numbers of reported ransomware
spiked and became the most reported cybercrime (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2: Participants experiences with different types of cybercrimes (%)
Role of Investigation We wanted to know if participants involvement with
the investigation had an operational, tactical, or managerial nature. We asked them
to describe and categorise their role as contributing to the (1) detection phase,
(2) analysis phase, (3) mitigation techniques, (4) policy formulation, or (5) derive
approaches to address crimes. The majority (around 70%) were mainly involved in
the analysis and mitigation of cybercrimes. Additionally, around 50% of participants
were involved in the detection phase and in deriving different approaches to address
these crimes. Only 30% of participants had a role in formulating cybercrime policies
(Figure 4.3). We can see the diverse experiences in the participants sample that
will allow us to collect in-depth data from different view points.
Techniques Used We asked the participants about the techniques and
experiences they adopt when investigating cybercrimes. Among the most common
techniques were OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) that gathers data from online
sources, Social Network Analysis (SNA) to study relationships, links, and interac-
tions between criminals, and visual analytics. None of the participants reported

that they use machine learning approaches in their investigations and only some
reported using data mining techniques.
Assertions
The assertion statements are designed to measure participants agreement with a set
of claims inferred from the literature related to the process and technological support
of cybercrime investigations. Five assertions were focused on the investigation
process (A.1, A.5, A.6, A.7, A.11), and six assertions were focused on the
technological support (A.2, A.3, A.4, A.8, A.9, A.10). All eleven assertions
and corresponding distribution of responses are presented in Figure 4.4.
Overall, participants agreed with the majority of assertions from the literature,
with the exception of four assertions that prompted some level of disagreement.
Both A.1 and A.11 from the process-related assertions prompted disagreement
from some of the participants. When discussing this with them, they clarified that
their objection was not related to the described steps, but rather it was based
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 58
Figure 4.4: Assertions results
on it being depicted as a cycle or an ordered process. From their experience, the
investigation process steps are not strictly ordered but are quite interchangeable
depending on the situation and incident at hand. For example, they might start
with data collection, and then do some analysis before going back to collect
additional data, and then do more analysis before visualising the results and
obtaining more feedback.
As for the technology related assertions, A.3 and A.9 prompted disagreement
from some participants. We noticed that there is a relation between those who
disagreed and the role/level of experience they hold. For instance, regarding
the importance of visualisation (A.3 ), participants with high levels of experience
and who hold managerial or leadership positions appreciate the importance of
visualisation more that those who have less experience. Furthermore, with regards
to having tools that are platform independent (A.9 ), participants that disagreed
were more technically oriented. From their experience, they explained that some
tools need to be platform-specific to be able to deliver deeper analysis for the
task at hand. They expressed that if the tool becomes platform independent, it
will lose some of its specialised abilities.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 59
We also note that a number of assertions prompted a neutral response from
participants. For instance, more than 40% of participants indicated a neutral
response for A.2, A.9, and A.11. Having the neutral response option is important
so as not to force participants reach an answer, when they might not have a strong
opinion towards a particular topic. For example, this might be when an assertion is
more technically oriented and the participant has a managerial role.
4.3.3 Cybercrime Incidents
We asked participants about the types of cybercrime incidents they usually deal with.
Participants from the private sector reported that their clients are usually interested
to know if they get any mentions on the DarkNet. For example, if people are buying
and selling related hacked accounts, personally identifiable information and credit
card information. Moreover, private sector participants reported that they tend
to monitor social media platforms to detect any potential threats to their clients,
identify the groups that are involved in these threats, and then relay that information
back to the client. For example, they cover incidents related to activism, hacktivism,
or public order matters that could impact on the day-to-day operations of the client.
On the other hand, government sector participants reported that they would
deal with cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. Although they are meant to
only focus on cyber-dependent crimes, they also assist with cyber-enabled crimes
mainly due to the current structure and limited capacity of the police force. On
the cyber-enabled side, they look at crimes such as fraud and financial offences and
selling/buying of drugs from dark-web markets. On the cyber-dependent side, they
cover a number of incidents: (1) Viruses, Ransomware, Malware, and Trojans, (2)
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, (3) DDOS Extortion, where attackers
demand extortion fees to stop the attack, (4) Hacking offences which include hacking
servers (e.g., data breaches), hacking websites (e.g., website defacement), hacking
personal accounts (e.g., emails), and hacking phones.
Participants reported that among the most reported cybercrimes are Ran-
somware. One participant related this to the urgency effect that a Ransomware
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 60
introduces.
"I think another thing about Ransomware is it tends to have an urgent impact.
All of a sudden you find your computer system is locked and a lot of people dont
know why. Whereas with some of the other leaks or hacks where actually its a lot
slower and information is pulled more slowly, then companies are probably able to
deal with it internally and much more low key because their operation is still able
to carry on. Whereas with Ransomware its an abrupt halt to all their systems. [G2]"
When investigating a cybercrime incident, participants reported that there are
several factors that affect how this process will be carried out and which cybercrime
unit will deal with the incident. A cybercrime incident might be dealt with at
a local-level (LL) by a local cybercrime force unit, at a regional-level (RL) by a
regional cybercrime unit, or at a national-level (NL) by the national crime agency.
We broke things down between what might be dealt with by local cybercrime
force unit, a regional cybercrime unit, and then the National Crime Agency, each
of those tiers kind of elements will have some kind of criteria. And we used to
have criteria at regional level that says we can only take so many jobs on because it
takes a long time to investigate them and a lot of resources. Unfortunately a lot of
the sentences, even if you get it that far, are tiny. So in that regards, I know that
there would be financial limits on losses set, impact, who the victim was, is there a
national infrastructure kind of element to it. There are hundreds of thousands of
reports in action fraud every day and there is not the resources to tackle them. So
lots of them, its based on: is there a viable lead here to take it forward. [G1]
Based on this works analysis, the main factors that affect how a cybercrime
incident will be handled include: the type of crime committed (cyber-enabled,
or cyber-dependant), the victim type (individual, small/medium business, large
enterprises), type of potential suspects (hacker or organised crime group), what
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 61
Figure 4.5: Investigation Factors
information or intelligence is available (investigation leads), and existing resources
available (human and technological resources). We map these factors and show
the relationship between them in Figure 4.5.
4.3.4 Understanding the Investigation Process
When asked about the process of intelligence gathering, the majority of the
participants agreed with the six steps of the intelligence gathering cycle described
in the literature [86]. However, the initiation of the intelligence gathering process
differs between the private sector and government sector participants. This is due
to the difference in nature between the two sectors. In the case of the private sector,
typically they work with a client and start by collecting and understanding the
clients requirements. Thus, they are able to scope down the task of gathering specific
intelligence to answer clear requirements. The process tends to take a top-down
approach where they formulate a hypothesis and then collect data to prove it.
On the other hand, with law enforcement, the investigation and intelligence
gathering are initiated when they receive a report that someone has been a victim
of a cybercrime. In such a case, the intelligence gathering process begins with a
bottom-up approach. This means they start from the collected data, analyse it,
and then try to formulate a hypothesis of what happened based on the analysed
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 62
data. Although the majority of participants from the government sector emphasised
this bottom-up approach, one participant stated that they tend to use mixed
approaches. They may start with a hypothesis or initial belief bias based on their
experience and then look at the data to either prove or dismiss the hypothesis.
What Ive done over time is, you will have your own kind of biases or stereotypes
in your head which guide you. Not in like negative stereotypes but ones that help
you. Youve just learnt from how youve gone before.[G3]
When we asked participants about the differences between investigating tradi-
tional crimes and cybercrimes, we received a diverse set of opinions. Some felt that
for cyber-enabled crimes, there are no differences and the same kind of detective
tactics would work. To them, it is still just a crime that has been committed
regardless of the means used. Thus, the investigation process is basically the same.
The fundamental thing is the majority of crime associated with fraud or cyber
is enabled crime. In other words, its traditional crime that is just leveraged through
a digital device. Nothings changed, its the existing crime that has been committed
for centuries if not thousands of years.[G2]
On the other hand, others felt that there are key differences that the cyber aspect
brings to the investigation. The main differences mentioned by participants relate
to the globalisation of cybercrimes, which restricts how far the investigation may
go due to jurisdictional issues. Another key difference mentioned by participants is
that cybercrimes, compared to traditional crimes, tend to have less investigation
leads 90% of the time. This may be due to the sophistication of cybercriminals in
covering their online traces, or due to the lack of cyber awareness of the victims.
For example, they may accidentally destroy digital traces and evidence, or report
the wrong information to the police.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 63
We asked participants about the use of OSINT during their investigations, and
the general consensus across participants from different organisations was that
OSINT is an important tool for intelligence gathering.
Open Source Intelligence is a massive tool for policing, and its used across
the board, not just by us, its used for all sorts of things, so it is a technique that
detectives are familiar with.[G4]
Participants stated that its importance arises from the fact that suspects spend
a lot of time online and have a large presence either on social media or on the
internet in general. One participant stated that OSINT is not only valuable to the
cybercrimes investigations, but even traditional crimes would have benefited from
using online sources to help with the investigation.
With some of the historic crimes we investigate, I think we should have been
doing more open source research side... I think open source intelligence has got a
much bigger role to play than any more traditional crimes and can be much more
successful, we can get a lot better results[G2]
4.3.5 Collaboration and Investigation Teams
Participants across different organisations described similar team structure and
dynamics when investigating cybercrimes and gathering intelligence. Typically, a
given case will have a lead investigator and may have the assistance of an analyst
and a researcher to support the investigation. Researchers are responsible for
conducting regular monitoring of different sources and preparing intelligence briefs
for analysts/investigators or clients. Analysts are responsible for developing the
intelligence products and identifying trends related to specific expertise and themes
in cybercrime. For instance, this might involve taking the volume of data and
making it presentable and useful either to the lead investigator (and the court later
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 64
on) or to the client. Depending on the size of the department and the available
resources, the team may also include technical staff who examine devices, whether
this is for the victim or suspect. Once these are reviewed, all the case data goes to
the analyst who tries to evaluate it, challenge it, and pick it apart.
We asked participants about the typical technical and cyber experiences of
people working in each role. Most mentioned that investigators and analysts do
not necessarily come with previous technical knowledge or backgrounds, however,
they would learn on the job the technical skills needed. This phenomenon was true
across all types of organisations, be it private sector or government and police force.
Some before they become cybercrime investigators, they were all probably 6
to 12-year detectives, so theyve been dealing with burglaries and things like that.
But there were a couple that had programming backgrounds, and one had worked
in information security....  The basis of it was getting good detectives and good
research and analyst skills and then try to give them enough technical knowledge to
do what they need to do.[G1]
Moreover, we wanted to understand how the collaboration across departments
and/or organisations happens when investigating a specific case. In the context of the
private sector, this was easily done online, through emails, or face-to-face meetings
with people from different departments. Depending on the size of the organisation,
teams would either all be based in the same office or city, or they may be working with
teams based overseas. Either way, they reported that information sharing within and
across teams was quite seamless and did not present a challenge to their investigation
process. Overall therefore, these represented usable and efficient workflows.
On the other hand, participants from the government sector had a different
and more challenging user experience. The flow of information and intelligence
sharing from different cybercrime units and agencies was a challenge. Participants
from different cybercrime force units mentioned that they often have difficulties
connecting information from a case they are investigating with possible linked cases
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 65
in other forces.
So very little intelligence sharing happens within cybercrime. ... Getting stuff
up from forces to regional units and vice versa is a lot more difficult. ... Say you had
an offence down south [placeName] and you had an offence up north [placeName]
and they were connected, whether it be like a suspect email address, the chances
of connecting those two offences, depending on what level it came in, could never
happen basically.[G3]
This is particularly true for information sharing between units at different levels
(local force and regional force) as well as between force units at the same local level.
However, the information sharing is currently better between force units at the
regional level. Moreover, one participant mentioned that sometimes such linkage of
cases may happen by chance.
Because you have such a workload that youd like to be most of the time
now identifying that something connected to something else is purely based of an
individuals memory as opposed to a system alerting. So those are the kind of next
steps we need.[G3]
Another participant expressed the need for a connected system across forces
that is able to calculate such associations between relevant cases.
If we had the ability to share our data from our jobs and their jobs and we had
the analytical ability to be able to pick out and go hang on a minute, their, our job
links to that one in [placeName]. Sometimes that linkage happens by virtue of us
having conversations but not you know automated.[G4]
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 66
4.3.6 Technological Capabilities and Tool Support
Within the general theme of technological tools and capabilities, participants
reported that multiple tools are usually used during investigations. Each of
these tools is used to achieve a specific task, such as data collection, analysis,
or visualisation. When asked about the interoperability and interactions between
these tools, the majority stated that these tools do not work well together. Instead,
it requires significant manual effort to extract the output of one tool and map it
into another tool for further analysis.
Theyre not necessarily as good at each part of the investigation. Certainly,
most of them have a focus at one point of the investigation cycle. And then the rest
might be add-ons which are getting better but do not necessarily, see the job all the
way through as good as youd like.[G1]
Moreover, participants stated that sometimes they work on different systems
and networks, and this is due to corporate regulations meaning that some tools are
only allowed to reside within public systems. Thus, different tools will be forced to
sit on different networks.
They very much work in isolation, in most cases you would use a tool, and say
it was going to be the main tool that I was using to build court products, it is great
for visualisation but there is very little in terms of labelling, exporting, producing
reports. So I might do all my working outside that tool, narrow it down to the
picture I want to show and then manually map that in the tool.[G3]
Participants from the government sector also mentioned that there is currently
no national mandate for the selection of tools to be used within forces. Therefore,
each police force operates a different system and process, which adds to the challenge
of sharing knowledge and intelligence between forces. This suggests a much larger
issue with regards to creating an efficient, effective and ultimately widely usable
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 67
cybercrime investigation process.
Tools are not mandated nationally to each force, and if it was a national
infrastructure for a lot of these things then that would be really helpful. Its generally
on a force by force basis.[G4]
We asked participants from the government sector about how the current police
systems are being used to report cybercrimes. Participants expressed that the
current police reporting system for cybercrimes (called Action Fraud (AF) [154])
suffers from a number of issues. AF is the UKs national fraud and cybercrime
reporting centre, which was initially designed for reporting fraud crimes specifically.
The system was not designed for recording cybercrimes and thus generates ambiguity
for the AF system users ( police officers or self-reporting victims) when reporting
these crimes. This sometimes leads to offences being recorded under the wrong
category.
It was not really built to deal with cybercrime, and so they had real issues in kind
of categorising offences, and when they get reported you have the victim knowledge
being able to accurately report it, and then we have the call taker knowledge.[G4]
Moreover, many details specific to cybercrime data are not properly recorded
and stored. This is due to the lack of structured methods to collect the necessary
cyber-related information, such as IP addresses, bitcoin wallets and usernames,
which makes reports collected from different victims differ in the level of detail.
This has an effect on how these reports are being searched and eventually leads to
missing links between crimes that may share similar details, such as email or IP
address.
The police reporting systems themselves are not even necessarily catered to
record cybercrime offences. They have to be kind of pushed in under a different
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 68
category sometimes and systems might be set up to record things like home addresses,
vehicle indexes and everything like that, but very little systems are set up to record
email addresses, IPs and everything like that.[G3]
Additionally, participants mentioned that there may be a shortage in the number
of call-takers within Action Fraud, which has an effect on the number of cybercrimes
that are assigned to different forces. Participants also mentioned complications
related to the limited level of cyber knowledge and experience in dealing with
cybercrimes that initial call-takers have. This leads them to misdirect crimes to the
wrong department which causes delays in responding to the crime. Also, one of the
participants perceived a link between how prevalent cybercrimes are in the news to
the number of crimes that are communicated to them from the call-takers.
One of the issues that weve identified within our force is when a victim calls
the Police, they get a really patchy response as to how its dealt with because our
call takers have a lot of experience of dealing with reports of rapes and assaults but
when it comes to cybercrimes they do not really know what to do so it often gets
misdirected or delayed.[G2]
We talked with participants about the implications of using technology to
automate certain investigation processes. Many of them had some concerns regarding
the automation effects on the process, and expressed a preference for performing
investigation tasks manually. This was either due to a lack of technical skills to
re-validate previously obtained results, or due to the fear of missing some evidence
that is relevant to the context they are investigating. Nevertheless, participants
from both private and government sectors emphasised that automating certain
processes may be necessary, but it should be done under human control and guidance.
 Automated tools can be useful for finding new data. I still think, and may
be its a cultural thing, but it still requires very human element to it. I know
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 69
the context of what were looking for and I can interpret the messages and the
chats that Im reading and pick up different things and bring it all together. I might
see something in one investigation, actually I realise is relevant for another one.[G1]
Including the human (user) in the process is particularly important in order
for them to understand the results produced by the tool, and to be able to trace
back the process from the input to the produced output. This is important because
investigators need to explain their findings to clients and to be able to defend it in
court.
You do not want to use a tool and just feel like you are just clicking a button
... If you are stood in court you want to be able to explain what is happening behind
that tool.[G3]
We asked participants about the technical capabilities and desirable tool features
they think will benefit the way they conduct their investigations and gather
intelligence. Government sector participants all agreed that they need a substantial
upgrade in their IT infrastructure to be able to cope with the sophisticated cyber-
crimes they investigate. This was not an issue for the private sector. Additionally,
both groups described the need for more user-centred tools to allow them to easily
do their jobs, tools with better support for data visualisations, and tools that can aid
in analysing bulk amounts of online data to cope with the evolving online ecosystem.
We could be so much better with better technology, share data, analyse data,
be proactive with data. So an improvement in technology would certainly assist us
for the future. I think we do things perhaps the long way and over time we could
improve on that.[G4]
In summary, this section highlighted the main findings gathered from the
experts interviews. These are mainly spread across topics related to the process of
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 70
cybercrime policing, the collaboration between investigation teams, and technological
capabilities of the investigators.
4.4 Key Challenges Faced by Cybercrime Inves-
tigators
The literature from the criminology field discusses a number of challenges facing the
police when investigating crimes. For example, some of the discussed challenges are
related to police patrol and organising hot-spot policing in order to minimise the
number of street crimes [155]. Moreover, Ratcliffe [156] argues that there is a need for
a new shift in policing from relying on old knowledge, which is relating to the criminal
activity that is typically collected in traditional crimes, to a new knowledge, which
is focused on the crime event that is collected from public open source information.
While some of the challenges that are inherent within the traditional crimes
field transcend to cybercrimes, a number of new challenges emerge that are linked
to the cyber-world. For example, cybercrimes are borderless by nature, thus there
are several legal and jurisdiction issues related to investigating cybercrimes. In
traditional crimes, the offender has a physical link to the crime scene which makes
the investigation and detention easier. However, in cybercrimes, this is not the
case. Offenders may be in a different place, state, or country from the victim. This
makes cooperation across different agencies a necessity.
Through the analysis conducted in this study, we are able to identify some
key socio-technical challenges that cybercrime investigators face. These challenges
emerged from the themes discussed previously and are grouped into four main
topics: (1) Reporting of Cybercrimes, (2) Information Sharing, (3) Tools and IT
infrastructure, and (4) Skills and Technical Abilities. We discuss these further below.
4.4.1 Reporting of Cybercrimes
One of the main issues is related to the AF system and how it was initially
designed and used. The system users face many ambiguities when recording the
reported crimes, which results in miss-categorising cybercrime offences. This leads to
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 71
inconsistencies in the level of detail collected from victims, which typically depends
on how technologically-aware the victim is and the level of cyber-experience held
by the call-taker preparing the report. There is also an increased likelihood of
misdirecting the report to the wrong department thus causing delays in addressing
the crime. It also increases the time and effort needed to conduct the investigation.
Additionally, the lack of structured methods to collect the necessary cyber-related
information, has multiple implications on the investigation process, such as missing
some connections between possibly related victim reports. Overall, a major review
of the questions included in AF was deemed necessary and appropriate training is
needed to better equip call-takers to handle cybercrime related reports.
4.4.2 Information Sharing
One of the most significant challenges faced by law enforcement is the lack of
centralised coordination of intelligence sharing between forces and agencies working
on cybercrimes. This has multiple effects. Firstly, the intelligence products produced
by forces may be incorrect since they do not have the big picture and are not fully
aware of the crimes which are being reported in different regions. Second, the
lack of communication between different local forces results in missing possible
connections between different reported cybercrimes. This makes establishing links
between cases a real challenge. Based on our results from interviewing participants
from different cybercrime force units, there exist a variety in the level of information
flow across local, regional, and national levels. Third, following up on specific
cybercrime cases and providing status updates either to the victim or the media
when requested, is difficult due to the lack of sharing case information. This
has a negative effect on the police reputation and image as it may make them
look incompetent in the eyes of the public. Moreover, given that cybercrimes
have a border-less nature, unlike traditional crimes, they may involve suspects in
distributed locations. Therefore, having better communication, coordination, and
automated data sharing between different units and forces will have a positive
effect on mitigating and responding to these crimes.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 72
4.4.3 Tools and IT Infrastructure
A key challenge associated with investigating cybercrimes is related to the level of
IT infrastructure available to police forces and the cyber capabilities of investigators.
In recent years, there have been several budget cuts that prevent forces from
investing in upgrading the IT infrastructure and acquiring advanced tools. This
limits their capabilities and has effects on the efficiency and quality of the conducted
investigations. Similarly, investigators expressed that a lot of the investigation time
is spent doing manual tasks that may be saved by utilising some automated or semi-
automated tools. Examples of such tasks include looking at OSINT data to collect
intelligence and analysing terabytes of data from server logs and victim devices.
Furthermore, the lack of a national mandate of tools and systems to be used in
cybercrime investigations adds another challenge for collaboration between different
cybercrime units. Police forces are generally decentralized in the UK. While having
a structure of separate 43 police forces [157] may be fit for policing traditional crimes,
this may not be the best structure for delivering effective actions against crimes that
are cross-jurisdictions (i.e., cybercrimes). This structure has lead to each cybercrime
unit becoming a silo, operating a different set of processes and tools and being
unable to interoperate. Similarly, this interoperation issue also exists for the different
tools used, where much of the investigation time is spent manually modifying and
formatting data to be able to move it between different analytical tools.
4.4.4 Skills and Technical Abilities
Another challenge is related to the cyber skills of the staff. There is a lack in the
number of skilled technical personnel working on investigating cybercrimes. The
majority are highly experienced investigators who have been working with traditional
crimes and are now, because of the increasing numbers of cybercrimes, moving
toward the cyber field. Investigators are highly trained in gathering intelligence and
investigation tactics but might not be as well-trained in the cyber-world. There are,
therefore, open questions pertaining to employee training and expertise. This is also
unlikely to be a problem only faced in this geographic area due to the widespread
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 73
Collaboration
People
Data & Technology
Strategy
Figure 4.6: Response areas to cybercrime challenges
increase in cybercrime. Potential avenues that may be explored going forward
include further training and upskilling for the necessary personnel, but also creating
tools that are better geared towards supporting user skills and activities. The ideal
case will be the provision of practices and tools that are easy to use and would
reduce the learning time for new cybercrime investigators.
4.5 Recommendations
As discussed in the previous section, there are a number of challenges currently
faced by cybercrime investigators working in government and private sectors. Some
of these challenges are inherent in the area of policing traditional crimes and
have transcended to cybercrimes. Others are new challenges that have emerged
because of the way the cyber space is designed. To overcome the challenges
of combating cybercrimes, we provide a set of recommendations covering four
key-areas depicted in Figure 4.6.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 74
4.5.1 Strategy
A clear holistic national strategy to combat cybercrimes is critical to any nation. The
latest UK Cyber Security Strategy [158] focuses on delivering three objectives: (1)
Defend the UK against cyber threats and respond effectively to occurring incidents,
(2) Deter by making the UK a difficult target for any cyber attack, and (3) Develop
existing talent in the cyber security industry and invest in innovation and research
to overcome future threats. Due to the nature of cybercrimes and the diversity
of its threats, actors, and motives, a comprehensive strategy is required to tackle
every aspect. The UK Serious and Organised Crime Strategy [159] covers four main
objectives: Pursue, Prevent, Protect, and Prepare. Pursue and Prevent are critical to
reduce the threat, while Protect and Prepare are focused on reducing vulnerabilities.
While these developed strategies have achieved great advancement with regards
to deterring and combatting cybercrimes, we believe that further advancements
may also help in winning this battle. Based on the interviews conducted and our
empirical study we recommend the following:
 Evaluate the current structure of law enforcement cybercrime units and its
effectiveness in addressing cybercrimes. This includes improving the capacity
and capabilities within these units.
 Re-engineering the investigation process and workflow to be more suitable to
the nature of cybercrimes.
 Review and update the usability, workflow, and current questions included
in the national cybercrime reporting systems [e.g., UK Action Fraud]. This
should include details to capture new threats, and to standardise the level of
details collected from victims in order to have a better picture of the incident
and thus direct the incident to the appropriate cybercrime unit to handle.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 75
4.5.2 Collaboration
Collaboration and coordination of intelligence and partnership is required at a
national and international level to be able to share intelligence, make effective use of
resources, and better combat cybercrimes. International initiatives and treaties are
important to tackle cross-jurisdiction cybercrimes. Strengthening those agreements
and continuing to develop them with common procedures and policies will lead
to effective prosecution and deterrence of cybercrimes.
At a national level, information sharing between different cybercrime agencies is
required. Having a central system connected across cybercrime forces will allow a
seamless flow of information between local, regional, and national agencies dealing
with different threat levels of cybercrimes. To achieve this, further research is
needed to facilitate the exchange of intelligence in a secure and usable manner
across different systems and cybercrime units. Additionally, it is critical to study
and evaluate the best architecture for information sharing across different levels
of cybercrime units; common options include a hierarchical architecture (i.e., local
unit connected to regional, and regional to national) or a flat architecture (i.e.,
having each cybercrime force unit connected to the others). Additionally, the
design of appropriate access control models is needed to facilitate the availability of
intelligence to those who require access to it while maintaining the confidentiality
and integrity of that information.
Moreover, collaboration and intelligence sharing is critical not only between
different government agencies but also across public and private sectors. Col-
laboration within the private sector will facilitate the exchange of expertise and
knowledge. Establishing frameworks to encourage the private sector to share
intelligence related to new threats they face will allow the threat effect on others
to be reduced, thus protecting them from becoming a potential victim of similar
threats. This can be achieved through a public-private consortium where businesses
can share threat information in a secure way, and the government can provide
actionable intelligence. Furthermore, such collaboration will allow the government
and large enterprises to provide a set of best practices and guidelines on how to
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 76
tackle threats, especially to small/medium enterprises who do not have the capacity
and resources to protect themselves.
4.5.3 People
Many of the investigators working in cybercrime from private and government
sectors come with experience in investigation tactics associated with traditional
crimes, and may lack the complex technical skills. One way to address this is to
provide more training, capacity building, and awareness in cyber for law enforcement
forces (especially at the local-force level). Attracting, recruitment, and retention of
highly skilled individual is a must to be able to cope with the constantly evolving
cybercrimes. Cybercriminals adapt new technologies and methods to evade detection
which makes investigating these crimes technically complex. Therefore, attracting
highly skilled people with expertise in cyber security and forensics will lead to
more effective combatting of cybercrimes.
Moreover, to proactively address cybercrimes, it is important to focus on
educating the general public and provide awareness campaigns on online safety best
practices, existing threats and tactics used by cybercriminals to aid in lowering
the chances of being victims to cybercrimes.
4.5.4 Data and Technology
The complex nature of cybercrimes and the constant adoption of new methods and
tools by cybercriminals to carry out their attacks generate a large digital footprint.
Data sources such as the dark web, social media, underground markets, and digital
logs are all examples of data sources that would be collected and analysed to gather
evidence in cybercrime cases. As described by participants, going through terabytes
of data is not an easy task, especially when you do not necessarily know what
you are looking for. This makes evidence gathering a difficult and time-consuming
task. Making use of automated methods and new technology such as artificial
intelligence would help filter out the noise, accelerate the investigation, and uncover
patterns and trends from the data.
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 77
Current tools used within the investigation process as suggested by participants
sometimes lack an important requirement that is related to the transparency of
the analytical process. Investigation and intelligence gathering tools should be
designed with human-in-the-loop concept in mind. As an investigator, he/she needs
to be able to understand how the tool is working, and how particular results were
reached. This is critical to them as they need to be able to explain their findings
and defend them in court as well as in other legal settings. To achieve this, the HCI
and usable security research community need to investigate how best to improve the
user interaction and involvement with intelligence tools. Additionally, the systems
and tools used in each cybercrime force unit should be mandated nationally. This
will facilitate a common infrastructure of sharing of analytical capabilities and
linked intelligence. Furthermore, this will increase the interoperability between
different tools and systems, and reduce the amount of incompatible tools currently
being used across different organisations. Finally, an investment in upgrading
the current IT infrastructure in different cybercrime force units is necessary, to
allow investigators to have the capacity to analyse the vast amounts of data being
generated from these crimes.
Many of the investigators working in cybercrime from private and government
sectors come with experience in investigation tactics associated with traditional
crimes, and may lack the technical skills. Increasing the usability of the cybercrime
investigation and intelligence tools is crucial as it can reduce undue burden on
the technical abilities of workers. The ideal situation is for tools and workflows
to be designed to take advantage of investigators expertise and support them in
cases where this may require bolstering.
4.6 Limitations and Implications
There were some limitations in our study related to the sampling of participants,
which we discuss in this section. The size of the interviewed sample that participated
in this study is small and does not allow us to draw generalisable conclusions. To
identify the main challenges faced by investigators and the process they use, we opted
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 78
for depth rather than breadth. This was achieved through the detailed in-person
discussion with participants to understand their experience while investigating
cybercrimes. Moreover, sample representativeness is another limitation that we
acknowledge. As we discussed earlier, we chose a diverse sample from both
government and private sectors. However, since the government sector consists
of cybercrime units within local police forces, regional, and national levels it
was not feasible to interview participants from all units. Similarly, with all 43
police forces in England and Wales have now established a dedicated cybercrime
unit, in addition to the 10 regional organised crime units it was not attainable
to recruit participants from all units.
This small sample size may affect the obtained results concerning the described
processes and challenges. Mainly, since each unit operates a different set of processes,
this may influence the identified challenges and needs. Thus, we do not claim to
have identified all the challenges faced by investigators. Furthermore, this study
was focused on the processes followed within local and regional force units. The
national-level perspective is yet to be explored. Nevertheless, our goal was to reach
data saturation for discontinuing data collection, i.e., when no new information or
themes are being observed in the data [160]. This was achieved for each sample
group in relation to the identified themes.
Through this study, we have answered the first two research questions we
outlined in Chapter 1. We have created an understanding of the existing capabilities,
processes, and workflows followed by practitioners in the field. Similarly, we identified
a set of challenges they face and provide a set of recommendations to overcome
these challenges. Our work has implications for future research in the field as it
defines a set of recommendations and future research directions that can allow for
better support to investigators and more effective combating of cybercrimes.
One of the main findings is the need for a common cybercrime framework
that unifies the investigation process across different units. This will facilitate the
collaboration and exchange of information between different forces. Moreover, better
utilisation of new technology, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can digest
4. Understanding Cybercrime Investigations: Process, Needs, & Challenges 79
the big data associated with cybercrimes is needed. As a result, in the following
chapter, we address these issues by proposing the CCINT framework.
4.7 Summary
In this chapter, we focused on providing an understanding of the needs and challenges
faced by practitioners working on cybercrime investigations. We interviewed
participants from both private and government sectors regarding their experience
with investigating different cybercrime incidents and the process of gathering
intelligence. The interviews were focused on four main themes: (1) investigation
process, (2) cybercrime incidents, (3) collaboration and information sharing, and (4)
technology. Moreover, we discussed four key areas where improvements are needed
to better combat cybercrimes. A clear holistic strategy is critical to improving
the current advancement with regards to deterring and combatting cybercrimes.
National and international collaboration with government, private and public sectors
is needed to facilitate the sharing of intelligence and information across jurisdictions.
Investment in education and awareness campaigns are necessary to inform the
general public. Finally, the development and utilisation of new tools and technology
are needed to overcome the burden associated with analysing big-data generated
from different cybercrime incidents.
Having understood the existing landscape of cybercrime investigations and
identified key needs and challenges faced by professionals. In the next chapter, we
will propose a cybercrime intelligence framework that focuses on developing models,
methods, and tools to aid investigators in their battles against cybercrimes.
CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence
Framework
5.1 Introduction
Cybercrimes complexity is increasing with new tools and Modus Operandi (MO)
being adopted by offenders to evade detection and achieve their goals. Criminals
have easy access to advanced technical abilities that they need to carry out their
attacks using what is called crime-as-a-service through the dark web and online
black markets. Similarly, the nature of cybercrimes have generated multitudes of
data introduced by the cyber aspect of these crimes, which makes the process of
identifying evidence similar to the process of searching for a needle in a haystack.
In order to aid law enforcement better detect, analyse, and understand the threat
landscape posed by cyber criminals, research into the area of cybercrime intelligence
has flourished.
Cyber criminals use the internet as their crime scene since it provides them
with ease of communication, wider recruitment possibilities, and opportunities
to form partnerships with other national and international criminal groups [13,
14]. This results in them leaving several crumbs that collectively produce a
digital footprint for each cyber-criminal. Previous research has studied these
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 81
footprints in order to gain better understanding of the characteristics of these
cyber-criminal groups [1518].
Moreover, as presented in Section 2.1 of Chapter 2, most of the taxonomies
and classifications of cybercrimes in the literature focus on describing cybercrimes
from a single view point, such as the target of the crime (e.g., [40]), the method
of the crime as in cyber-enabled or cyber-dependent (e.g., [45]), or the security
principle the crime exploits (e.g., [43]). To the best of our knowledge, none
of the existing models consider in their classification the wide range of factors
that constitute a cybercrime, including the victims and offenders backgrounds,
motives, incurred losses, and skills.
In order for cybercrime investigators to be able to effectively defend against
cybercrimes, they need to understand the motives, methods, targets, and MO
used by cyber criminals. In this chapter, we propose the CCINT Framework, a
CyberCrime INTelligence framework that provides conceptual model and operational
framework for investigating cybercrimes. The conceptual model is inspired by
how practitioners describe the process they use and the key factors they consider
when investigating cybercrimes (insights from Chapter 4), while the operational
framework covers the technical-side with the focus on methods and tools to handle
the data analysis and investigation.
We will then demonstrate examples of how the model is applied to different
examples of cybercrimes. Having a common framework to follow while investigating
will help investigators extract effective intelligence and better analyse such crimes.
Finally, we will present the design and architecture of the CCINT framework that
will aid analysts in the operational aspects of their investigations.
The main contributions of this chapter are outlined as follows:
1. Provide a conceptual model to be used during investigation of cybercrimes
inspired by practitioners experiences. Having a common framework to follow
while investigating will help investigators extract effective intelligence and
better analyse such crimes.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 82
2. Present a detailed example of how the conceptual model can be applied to a
real-world cybercrime case.
3. Outline the design and architecture of the operational part of the framework
that will aid practitioners in the operational aspects of their investigation.
5.2 The Framework
For cybercrime investigators to be able to analyse and investigate cybercrimes, they
need to better understand the techniques, processes, and procedures used by cyber
criminals. To do so, a robust framework that provides a holistic overview is needed.
In the interviews we conducted with cybercrime investigators (Chapter 4), they
described the different factors they need to consider when investigating a crime.
These factors consist of three main elements: (1) the offender, (2) the victim, and (3)
the incident. Based on a set of properties that describe each of these three elements,
they will be able to determine how this particular incident will be investigated. In
particular, which cybercrime unit will handle it (national, regional, local), what
type of resources will be allocated (e.g., time and man power), and what type
of intelligence sources will be considered. In the following sections, we provide
a complete description of each of these elements through the CCINT conceptual
model. We then show how the model can be used in a real-world cybercrime case.
Next, we present the design and architecture of the operational side of the
framework, where we describe the main methods and functionalities that constitute
the framework.
5.3 CCINT Conceptual Model
Any given crime consist of three main elements. The offender, who commits
the crime, the victim, who suffers from that crime, and the incident, the event
that constitute the crime. Previous studies, as well as current work, attempted to
understand the different elements of cybercrime from multiple perspectives [161164].
Some focused on understanding the victims-side, while others focused on the
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 83
Figure 5.1: CCINT Model
offenders. In addition, some included defenders in their model. For instance, Arief
et al. [161] define the cybercrime stakeholders to include the defenders in addition to
attackers and victims. In the following, we present our model, which include three
main elements, the relationships between them, and the properties describing each
of the elements. Figure 5.1 illustrates an overview of CCINT conceptual model.
5.3.1 Offenders
Offenders of cybercrimes can be described by five main properties. (1) Motive,
(2) gain, (3) type, (4) resources, and (5) jurisdiction.
Motive  In cybercrime, similar to traditional crime, there is always a motive
behind committing such crime. Typically, one of the most common motives is
economic gain. However, there are multiple cases where the motive behind the crime
is completely different. Understanding the main driving motive behind committing
the crime will allow investigators better investigate these crimes. Prior research
investigated the different motives [165] and psychology of online offenders [162] in
general, and cyber-terrorist in particular [163]. Offenders might have composite
motives behind committing crimes. We break down these motives as follows:
1. Economic: It is considered one of the most common motives for cybercrimes.
For example, ransomware, one of the most common attacks in recent years,
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 84
is primarily motivated by financial factors. A typical way to financial gain
would be through the victim himself (e.g., paid ransom) or through the sale
of victim data in black markets.
2. Political: It includes disrupting another state by attacks targeting a critical
national infrastructure (e..g, power grid). It may also involve attacking
government websites and taking them down, or defacing them to spread a
political message. Additionally, manipulating elections in favour of particular
party is another type of attack that we have seen recently that is politically
motivated.
3. Ideology: This include attacks by violent extremists trying to promote
their ideology and spread propaganda. Additionally, hacktivism activities are
ideology motivated where the attackers try to deliver their message (social,
cultural) by breaking into systems.
4. Esteem: This include attacks that are motivated by gaining status, power,
or purely for fun. Typically, these are conducted by script-kiddies who are
looking to prove their abilities or groups trying to gain reputation in the cyber
world.
Gain  While the defining motive behind the crime significantly influences
the gain the offender obtains, we separate them to capture the details of the
actual advantage gained by committing the crime. This may include money, data,
competitive advantage, and fame.
Type  Offender type captures the category to which the cyber criminal
belongs. This is divided into (1) individual actor, (2) group, (3) organised group,
(4) state-sponsored actors. Knowing the offender type will give the investigator
a sense related to what kind of resources they may have.
Resources  This includes the type of resources the offender has access to in
order to commit the crime. These include technical knowledge, access to malicious
software, computation power, and financial means.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 85
Jurisdiction  This is the jurisdiction that the offender is part of. This
will help in coordinating with other cybercrime units, either locally, regionally,
nationally, or globally.
5.3.2 Victims
Three main factors need to be defined to describe victims of cybercrimes. These
are: (1) type of the victim, (2) the level of loss/harm incurred, and (3) the
jurisdiction where the victim resides. Other studies in the literature [164] also
included in their definition of victims, the awareness-level and attractiveness level
to attackers. We exclude these from our definition, as they do not necessarily
contribute to assisting the investigation.
Victim Type  The victim may be an individual who has fallen a victim to a
cybercrime. An enterprise is further broken down into two types: a small/medium
enterprise, as they would typically need more assistance in dealing with the aftermath
of the crime due to their limited resources. A large enterprise is usually more capable
of handling and overcoming the effects of the incident through proper processes
and procedures. Moreover, victims may be government entities, or the public
which is when the cyber attack has affected the general population. Investigators
also need to identify if the victim is considered a vulnerable victim such as a
minor individual or a charity organisation as these will need further assistance
and guidance when handling the incident.
Loss / Harm  The investigator needs to have an understanding of the level
of harm/loss incurred by the victim because of the incident, as this will have and
effect on the level of resources to put in place. The topic of online harm and the
cost of cybercrime has been studied in the literature [166168]. The studies suggest
the concept of cyber harm must consider the wide variety of stakeholders it may
affect. A detailed taxonomy of cyber-harm has been presented in [168]. They
explain different characteristics of harm and how they can influence its magnitude.
We break down the types of cybercrime harm to six types:
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 86
1. Economic: Amount of financial loss incurred because of the cybercrime.
Either directly (e.g., payment of a ransom) or indirectly (loss of availability
of a service because of the attack).
2. Digital and Physical Assets: Loss of digital assets such as data and IP, or
abuse of resources such as computation power. The level of loss relates to the
nature of damage caused. For example, if the victim can restore from a recent
back up then this would be a small loss. If the victim lost an IP related data
then it would be a high loss for them.
3. Political: This type of loss includes loss of geo-political power, damaged
relations with other nations, disturbance to the electoral process, and loss of
political influence on the public.
4. Psychological: This type of loss causes emotional and cognitive disturbance
such as feelings of depression, anxiety, negative emotions, and self-harm. This
can be clearly manifested in cybercrimes that target the human such as
cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, and online radicalisation.
5. Reputation: The attack could cause severe reputation damage to the victim.
Reputation damage may affect different types of victims, such as individuals,
enterprises, and states.
Jurisdiction  The jurisdiction that the victim belongs to. This will help in
coordinating with other cybercrime units, either locally or globally.
5.3.3 Incident
The incident represents the main event under investigation caused by the offender
and which affects the victim. It is described according to five properties as follows.
Offence Type  As discussed in Section 2.1, there are different classifications
of cybercrimes in the literature. Some are based on the target of the crime (crime
against the machine, crime using the machine, crime in the machine), while others are
based on the fundamental principles of cyber security (i.e., attacks on confidentiality,
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 87
integrity, or availability). The most commonly used classification of offences is
the breakdown to cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent crimes. As described by
the interviewed professionals (Chapter 4), the common classification they use is
cyber-enabled (fraud and financial offences) and cyber-dependent crimes (intrusions
(e.g., hacking) and disruption (e.g., DDOS) of computers and networks).
Method  This includes a description of the MO used in the offence and how
the incident occurred. For example, was it through a certain phishing campaign
that lead to a malware infection? What types of malware have been used? What
vulnerabilities were exploited and what tools were used? Identifying the method
will aid investigators better understand the incident, identify MO patterns, and
profile cyber criminals.
Scale  The scale of the incident and level of impact it caused. This is in
terms of the frequency and urgency of the situation, if it is an on-going incident,
and the number of victims it is affecting.
Location  The domain where the incident occurred and its impact is visible.
This can occur purely online, offline, or it may have a combined online/offline impact.
Investigation Leads  The types of available investigation leads and verifiable
information related to the incident. Depending on the verifiable information and
leads, the crime may be allocated for investigation or transferred or cancelled
due to limited investigation leads.
5.3.4 Dependent Variables
Three dependent variables will be influenced by the described elements of the
cybercrime model. These are the cybercrime unit that will handle the investigation,
the resources allocated to conduct the investigation, and the type of intelligence
sources that will be utilised to investigate the incident.
Cybercrime Unit  Based on the properties of the above described elements
of cybercrimes, it will determine the type of cybercrime unit (s) that will handle the
investigation of the incident. This will be a national agency (e.g., NCA), regional
cybercrime unit (ROCU), or a local cybercrime unit within a police force. For

example, if the incident has a large scale and high impact on the victim such that
it causes disruption to essential services, or leads to severe economic or social loss,
or has a political intent, then it will have to be handled and coordinated by a
national crime agency. On the other hand, if the incident affects an enterprise with
a serious impact on the victim then it will be handled by the regional cybercrime
unit with assistance from the national crime agency. Finally, if the incident affects
an individual or a small/medium enterprise with limited economic loss then it
would be handled by a local cybercrime unit.
Intelligence Sources  The type of intelligence sources to consider while
investigating the incident is largely dependent on the incident properties, such as
offence type, method, and investigation leads. In addition, the offender/victim types
will influence the type of sources to consider during the investigation. Intelligence
sources can be open source intelligence (OSINT) from online public sources such
as social media, forums, white papers, or closed intelligence sources from local
intelligence reports or global intelligence from international agencies.
Allocated Resources  The amount of resources that will be allocated to
investigate an incident is affected by the loss, incident scale, and victim/offender
types. The resources include man power, financial resources, and investigation time.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 89
5.4 Applications of CCINT Model
In this section, we demonstrate the frameworks use by applying it to different
examples of cybercrimes. In Table 5.1, we show how different types of cybercrimes
(cyber-enabled, cyber-dependent) map to the offenders intents and victims losses.
For instance, the intent of a creator of a malware may be an economic gain by
selling the malware in the dark web. Similarly, it may be for gaining reputation
and esteem in their community, or it can be politically motivated where the
malware is written to target a foreign state. On the other hand, the victims
of such crime may suffer different losses. For instance, this might be economic
loss if the malicious software caused disruption to the victims business services.
Reputation loss may occur if being targeted by a cyber attack made the news (e.g.,
Yahoo attack). Digital loss may occur if the malicious software wiped the data.
A physical loss may be incurred, for example, if the malware targets a critical
national infrastructure such as a power plant.
To demonstrate the details of how the framework can be used in investigating
a given cybercrime, we provide a detailed example by applying it to a real-
world case study.
5.4.1 Case: Buying & Selling of Hacking Tools
Case Description  A website is used for selling a hacking tool, which allows
remote access to victim machines. The tool is called Imminent Monitor RAT (IM
RAT), and was purchased by around 14, 500 people from 124 countries for as little as
US$25. The tool gave full remote control of tens of thousands of victims computers.
Once installed, the IM RAT allowed the hacker full access to the infected device,
enabling the attacker to disable anti-virus software, steal data or passwords, record
key strokes, and watch victims via their webcams [169].
Case Analysis  Figure 5.2 shows how the case is mapped against our model.
The model allows the investigator to visualise the details of the case and map
the different properties associated with each of the three main elements: incident,
offenders, and victims. The incident element shows the different offences that have
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 90
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 91
been committed, such as selling of the hacking tool, the purchase of the tool, and
the utilisation of the tool to gain unauthorised access to victims machines. We also
capture the methods of how the offences have been implemented, which includes,
for instance, the manufacturing of the malicious software and the hosting of the
website to buy/sell the RAT tool. The scale of this incident is also captured and
considered high due to the wide-scale target of victims, the wide features and control
it provided to the attacker, the ease of use, and the low cost. We also model the
information related to the offenders and victims as they become available during the
investigation. For example, we capture that there are different types of offenders:
those who sell/create the RAT and those who buy it and utilise it. Moreover, the
nature of the cybercrime means the offenders (buyers, sellers) are located in multiple
jurisdictions which warrants a global collaboration between authorities in multiple
countries for coordinated capture of offenders and the taking down of the selling site.
The victims element captures the types of victims who are targeted by the RAT and
the types of losses they suffered. For example, psychological and reputation losses
are incurred due to voyeurism, and economic loss due to data theft and extortion.
This case demonstrates one example of how our model can be used to map a
case of selling and buying of malicious tools. It helps organise the investigation
process and inform what kind of resources, collaboration, and intelligence are needed.
The model can also be applied to other cases of cybercrimes including phishing,
cyber-stalking, and cyber-terrorism just to mention a few.
For instance, let us consider a case of cyber-terrorism that is based on a
recent case that took place in the US, where the offender designed a process
that uses a computer script to make ISIS propaganda more conveniently accessed
and disseminated to users on social media platforms [170]. The case describes how
the offender distributed the script with instructions on how to use it to individuals
whom he believed to be ISIS supporters and members of pro-ISIS organisations. The
offender is an individual actor, who used online chatting services and social media
platforms to provide easy access to terrorist material such as online magazines and
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 92
videos. The motive is ideological as he wanted to provide easy access to terrorist-
created material to radicalise and inspire attacks against the US. Although the
distribution scale was limited to specific social media groups, the impact of sharing
such material that advocates for carrying out attacks is significant. Therefore,
this incident requires the investigation to be conducted by a national level agency.
Moreover, the intelligence sources required would include coordination with the social
media platforms used by the offender, online information related to the publications
of online media by the ISIS group, and evidence found from the offenders devices.
In this example, although there are no direct victims, there are indirect victims
who will be targeted and recruited by the dissemination of the terrorist media.
5.5 CCINT: Operational Framework
One of the challenges that analysts face when investigating cybercrimes, is making
sense of large amounts of data. As such, we designed the operational side of the
framework to assist in handling complex data and support multiple analytical
techniques. In addition, the framework is designed to account for the six key
steps in the analytical process: problem definition, hypotheses generation, infor-
mation collection, hypotheses evaluation, selecting the most likely hypothesis, and
continuous monitoring of new information [85].
An overview of the architecture is shown in Figure 5.3. The initiation of any
investigation, as described by the practitioners, is usually triggered by either an
internal event (uncovered intelligence information) or external event (reported
crime). These are modelled in our framework by providing two modes of operation:
bottom-up investigation where the system detects intelligence information from raw
data and generates alerts to the user to further investigate, or top-down investigation
where the investigator has outside knowledge and wants to generate a hypothesis in
order to prove it using the data. Furthermore, typically any cybercrime investigation
involves various specialists and investigator roles working together to solve a case,
thus we design the framework with support for collaborative investigation sessions,
such that several specialists can work together on a shared case scenario.

5.5.1 Framework Components
The framework consists of three main layers: data-handling, analysis, and front-end,
and two external layers: users, and data-sources. The data-sources layer contains
any open online or offline data sources that are of interest to the analyst and can
be plugged into the framework through an Application Programming Interface
(API) to feed data to the data-handling layer.
The data-handling layer is responsible for collecting data from the different
sources based on the users defined configuration. A plug-in for each data-source
is created to facilitate the collection of the data. Moreover, this layer consists of
data acquisition using a crawler, pre-processing and cleaning of the data, search
and filtering, and a database for storage.
The next layer is the analysis layer, which provides a collection of analytical
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 94
methods to support the detection and analysis of cyber criminal activities. Methods
such as content and sentiment analysis, psychological and personality analysis, time
analysis, and social network analysis are used to perform these operations. These
methods are utilised to support different functionalities that an investigator may
need to perform. We focus here on six main functions that have been found to
be important to investigators: behaviour analysis, community detection, profiling
cyber criminals, detection of weak signals, and identification of criminal content.
The front-end layer supports user interaction and consists of a dashboard,
multiple visualisation views and a configuration panel for the analysts to customise
the different processes within the framework. The top layer is the user layer that
supports both individual and collaborative sessions.
Furthermore, as described by professionals, during the investigation they may
combine two approaches: bottom-up and top-down. Thus, the framework should
support the two modes of analysis. The bottom-up mode allows the analyst to
start from the data level without having any previous hypothesis, and allows him
to observe the data and look for anomalies and abnormalities. In this analysis
mode, the system may suggest possible leads for the analyst to investigate in the
form of alerts, based on anomalies detected and unusual patterns. For example,
the system may alert the investigator if it detects an increase in the number of
negative sentiment tweets originating from a given location of interest. Thus, the
investigator would then hypothesise that some event may have occurred in that
location and perform a more detailed investigation. On the other hand, the top-
down approach allows the analyst to start with a hypothesis that they want to
test, and examine different what-if scenarios in order to confirm or reject their
hypothesis using the data. For example, the investigator may have a lead that
two online personas are actually operated by the same criminal. He would then
test this hypothesis using stylometric content analysis, and the result would be
the probability that this hypothesis is true.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 95
The analysis layer is the core component of the CCINT architecture. As
such, in the following sections, we will describe in detail the main elements that
constitute the analysis layer.
5.5.2 Analysis Methods
Based on the interviews with cybercrime investigators, they described a variety
of methods that they use while investigating different cybercrimes. Some of these
methods are still conducted manually (e.g., reading through online content), assisted
with simple methods (e.g., keyword-based filtering), or conducted using a diverse,
incompatible, set of tools. Investigators highlighted the need for (semi)-automated
methods to improve the process of investigation and detection of hidden patterns
in the investigation data. As such, in the following, we outline the main methods
used in CCINT framework to support the needs of investigators.
Content Analysis  The content analysis method allows cybercrime investiga-
tors to analyse the various material posted by cyber-criminals, such as text, images,
and videos. Currently, we focus only on textual content however we plan to add
support for multimedia such as images and videos. This method utilises techniques
from natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning fields. For
example, entity extraction is used to allow investigators to extract specific patterns
such as usernames and URLs. Additionally, this method allows the investigator
to analyse the text in order to identify topics, detect most frequently used words,
and compare the writing style of different suspects, or criminal groups.
Psychological and Personality Analysis  Previous research in the crimi-
nology and psychology fields suggested that criminals may exhibit behaviour and
personality changes that may act as indicators to them committing a crime [171,
172]. Based on this premise, we provide investigators with analytical support to
explore personality and psychological characteristics of their suspects. This is
achieved by proxy of analysing textual content written by these suspects in order
to identify features such as emotions (e.g. anger, disgust, sadness, joy, and fear),
and personality traits (e.g., OCEAN Big-five).
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 96
Social Network Analysis (SNA)  The SNA method allows cybercrime
investigators to capture interactions between different nodes in a criminal network.
For example, it can be used to create a network of possible criminals nodes
and the interactions/relationships edges between them. Using SNA techniques,
the investigator will be able to detect hidden relations among possible suspects,
understand who is the most influential member in an organised criminal group, and
what is the best way to disrupt such a network. SNA will also enable us to provide
the investigator with a visual representation of the criminal networks. Additionally,
this can capture different patterns of the suspect behaviour, for example, in terms
of the number of posts they share, discussions they participate in, and friendship
connections they create or destroy [173].
Time Analysis  Time analysis methods provide support for detecting
patterns in the data when temporal information is available. For example, how
frequently the suspect posts, or a sudden increase of suspicious network activity
before an attack is launched. Analysing these patterns can sometimes provide
interesting insights to investigators.
5.5.3 Analysis Tasks
From our investigation of the literature (Section 2.2), we found that the main
research problems tackled in the literature within the cybercrime-intelligence domain
generally revolve around the following key areas:
Detection of communities and organisational structure  This includes
the identification of key members in criminal networks, the discovery of sub-
communities within the network and the different properties they possess, the
detection of strong ties between nodes to evaluate relationships between criminals,
and finally studying organisational structure of the criminal groups to understand
the hierarchy of the criminal network. This aids law enforcement in detecting
the leaders and influential members in order to target them instead of wasting
resources on low-level, non-influential criminals.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 97
Behaviour analysis and interaction patterns This includes analysing be-
haviour and finding patterns in the cyber-criminal networks, establishing interaction
patterns between individual actors or between sub-groups within the network. By
observing how the network changes over time and studying meta data information,
we can possibly predict when the network is conspiring to commit a crime.
Profiling cyber criminals  This includes identifying language stylometric
fingerprints and author characteristics such as their age, gender, and ethnicity. As
most criminals use screen-names and disguise their information, it is critical to
study techniques that can reveal characteristic information about them. Profiling
cyber-criminals aids in predicting if two online accounts are operated by the same
individual, and to track criminals across different online platforms.
Identifying Weak Signals  This includes identifying weak signals of disrup-
tive events and predicting offline events [174] (i.e., indicators that initially appear
insignificant but actually are early indicators of large-scale real-world phenomena).
Predicting tipping points, the likelihood of rumour spread, information propagation,
and the expected reactions of the public.
Extraction and identification of online criminal content This includes
the development of techniques to automatically identify criminal-related content or
individuals. This involves building crawlers that are able to extract content and
classify it as criminal-related or non-criminal content.
5.6 Research Focus  The Battle for the Heart
and Mind
As we have seen in previous sections, cybercrimes are quite diverse and vary
considerably in terms of methods, motives, and victims. Therefore, we need to focus
the research on a specific type of cybercrime. A considerable amount of research has
focused on studying cybercrimes that target networks and systems, such as malware,
DDoS, and cyber-fraud [3436]. However, in recent years, a different kind of threat
has grown and became prevalent, which targets peoples hearts and minds [175].
These crimes cause online harm and have ideological, political, or psychological
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 98
motives. Such threats include the use of online resources to manipulate the public
for political or social gain, hate crimes, cyber-bullying, trolling, spread of fake
news, and spread of violent extremist content and behaviour. Recognising the
danger of these emerging online threats, the UK governments Department for
Digital, Media, Culture and Sport along with the Home Office recently published a
joint white paper aiming at limiting online harm and establishing new regulatory
frameworks that can properly address these issues [37]. Among the categorise
identified in the report, is the topic of extremist online content and activity, which
is highlighted as one of the areas that have a less clear definition and is still lacking
a proper and effective response [37].
Moreover, the Internet organised crime threat assessment report published by
the European Cybercrime Center (EC3) [6], emphasise the threat caused by the
wide exploitation of online service providers by terrorist groups to distribute their
propaganda material. This forms a significant challenge to law enforcement as
well as online platforms to disrupt such activities. Therefore, there is a need for
collaborative efforts from the research community, the private, and the government
sectors to create appropriate methods and policies to counter this threat. Several
studies in the literature looked at the role of the Internet in terrorism and whether
it is mainly used to instigate or facilitate involvement [176, 177]. Some studies
categorise its role to three goals: instrumental such that it facilitate the access to
information, identity such that it provides ideological belief, and relational such that
it satisfies affiliation and connection goals [178]. Moreover, other studies have showed
links between limiting terrorists abilities to carry out attacks and the disruption of
their flow of online propaganda [6]. For example, reports suggested that the Boston
Marathon bombers in 2010 were inspired by extremist online propaganda [26].
Furthermore, the report from Europol [6] points out the importance of counter-
terrorism cooperation and sharing of information between law enforcement authori-
ties as well as with the private sector. This supports our findings from the study in
Chapter 4. As such, it has become a priority for law enforcement practitioners to
have a better understanding of emerging threats and technologies. This is important
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 99
to have an effective measure to counter the extremist online recruitment campaigns
and the spread of their online propaganda. Going forward in this research, we
will focus our scope on the topic of online extremist content and activities. We
will utilise our framework to better understand the properties of the extremist
narrative and develop methods to defend against its spread. This will aid law
enforcement and online platforms in their fight against online radicalisation and
the spread of extremist propaganda.
5.7 Limitations and Implications
The method applied to create the CCINT framework depends on combining
previous knowledge from the literature with our understanding of existing processes
followed by practitioners and their needs. As such, it is limited to the trends
and the processes discovered during the interviews as described by practitioners.
Additionally, although we have demonstrated the applicability of the framework
to different examples of cybercrimes and presented a case study to validate the
proposed framework, further validation with practitioners is needed to test the
framework in a real-life investigation environment.
Our work has implications for practitioners working on investigating cybercrimes.
Our work can assist investigators by providing a holistic view of the investigation and
improve their understanding of the different factors relevant to the three elements
of the crime (i.e., offender, victim, and incident). Also, it aids them in managing
allocated resources such as time and manpower, identifies the different intelligence
sources to consider, and which cybercrime unit to oversee the investigation. More-
over, through the operational side of the framework, we give a road-map that allows
for integration between different analytical techniques covering behavioural and
linguistic aspects, as well as a combination of multiple data sources. Furthermore,
the framework components act as a general definition of models that need to be
specialised for each type of cybercrime. As such, going forward, we demonstrate the
use of the framework components by focusing on a particular type of cybercrime
and show how it can support investigators to combat such crime.
5. CCINT: The CyberCrime INTelligence Framework 100
5.8 Summary
In this chapter, we presented the CCINT framework that is inspired by our investi-
gation of the literature and interviews with practitioners from both government and
private sectors. We provided a conceptual model to be used during investigations
of cybercrimes, which will help investigators visualise the details of the case and
map the properties associated with different elements of the crime. Moreover, we
presented a working example of how to apply the model on a real-world cybercrime
case. Next, we outlined the operational side of the framework, where different
analytical methods are adopted to achieve various functionalities related to the
investigation of cybercrimes.
To narrow the scope, we decided to focus our research on a particular type
of cybercrime, namely extremist online content and activities, which have been
highlighted as one of the emerging online threats that require further investigation
and more effective responses. As such, the following chapters will focus more
closely on the topic of online extremism and radicalisation and, in particular, the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremist group, aiming to identify measures to
automatically detect the spread of radical extremist propaganda and activities online.
Identifying Signals of Extremist
Propaganda
6.1 Introduction
Several terrorist and extremist groups have benefited tremendously from technology
such as Internet and Online Social Network (OSN) platforms as they provide them
with opportunities to spread their propaganda, widens their reach for victims,
and facilitates potential recruitment opportunities. Research into extremism and
online radicalisation revealed that the MO of those groups starts by exploiting
popular public platforms to capture attention, maximise impact, and widely spread
their ideology and propaganda [6]. They then move potential recruits to more
controlled environments such as smaller platforms with end to end encryption
for further grooming and radicalisation. A study released by UNESCO [179]
discussed how young people and vulnerable individuals are affected by violent
extremism on social media. The study looks at existing research in the area and
suggests that although the Internet and social media platforms may not directly
cause violent behaviour, they can be used as a first step by extremists towards
facilitating violent radicalisation.
To limit the reach of cyber-terrorist and extremist groups, several private
and governmental organisations are policing online content and utilising big data
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 102
technologies to minimise damage and counter the spread of such information.
For example, the UK launched a Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit in
2010 aiming to remove unlawful Internet content and it supports the police in
investigating terrorist or radicalising activities online. The Unit reports that among
the most frequently referred links were those coming from several OSNs, such
as Facebook and Twitter [24]. Similarly, several OSNs are constantly working
on detecting and removing users promoting unlawful and extremist content. Big
tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have established dedicated
teams to develop policies and tools to counter terrorism and extremist content
and their use of the corresponding platforms. For example, in 2017, Twitter
announced that they suspended around 300,000 accounts globally that were linked
to terrorism [108]. In addition, the establishment of the Global Internet Forum
to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT)1 by a collection of tech companies with the vision
of preventing terrorist from exploiting platforms is a major step towards creating
a safe online environment. The GIFCT initiative announced the commitment to
invest in technology and improve the existing capabilities to detect and remove
terrorist and violent extremist content online.
In this chapter, we utilise computational methods to analyse online extremist
propaganda and reveal their ideology and tactics. Our analysis uses data mining
techniques to computationally uncover textual properties associated with these
groups. Furthermore, we explore new methods to uncover not only the syntactic
properties associated with online extremist propaganda, but also look at the contexts
and semantics of words used from the perspective of the extremist group. Finally,
we adopt psycholinguistic methods to extract a number of psychological properties.
These properties correspond to the radicals interests, personality, and emotions.
This allows us to create a general radical psychological profile that we can later
utilise as a signal to detect possible radicalisation behaviour. Our hypothesis is
that the psychological and linguistic properties of those who produce extremist
propaganda are shared by those who may be influenced by it. By having a better
1https://www.gifct.org/
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 103
understanding of the linguistic cues and psychological properties conveyed in the
extremist propaganda, we can identify extremist content and people who might
be at risk of radicalisation.
In summary, the main contributions of this chapter are outlined as follows:
1. An analysis of the textual properties of ISIS online extremist magazine, Dabiq,
in order to empirically identify their linguistic models and cues. This includes
identification of themes, topics, and how they change over time.
2. Generate a radical-language model trained on the ISIS propaganda material.
The model captures contextual properties and the semantic relationships
between words.
3. An investigation into the psycholinguistic properties conveyed in these articles
and how they change over time. This leads us to create a general profile for
ISIS inferred from their published propaganda.
6.2 Method
In order to understand how radical propaganda are constructed and used, we
analyse all issues of Dabiq magazine, an online English magazine published by
ISIS terrorist group with the purpose of recruiting people and promoting their
propaganda and ideology. A general overview of our approach is presented in
Figure 6.1, where articles from Dabiq extremist magazines are used to perform
two parallel tasks. (1) Build a language model using (a) Term-Frequency Inverse-
Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) scores of uni-, bi-, and tri-grams, and (b) create
word embeddings generated from a word2vec model. The output of this task is
a radical corpus of top k-grams, and a word embedding model giving a vector
representation for each word in the corpus. (2) Create a psychological profile based
on the language used in the extremist propaganda articles, consisting of a set of
emotional and topical categories using LIWC dictionary-based tool.
Dataset  A summary of the radical corpus dataset (CRAD) is shown in
Table 6.1. The corpus consists of 15 magazine issues with total of around 400K
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 104
Figure 6.1: Approach Overview
words and 2M characters. Each issue typically consists of a collection of articles,
editorial snippets, and visual images. The purpose of these magazines is to spread
ISIS ideology, motivate, and recruit people. In our analysis, we focus only on
the text and discard any graphical content. Using this dataset, our aim is to
(1) investigate what topics, textual properties, and linguistic cues exist in these
magazines, and (2) uncover psycholinguistic properties including emotions and
personality traits using these magazines as proxy.
Approach  In order to be able to analyse the text in an automated way,
we need to transform the text into a format that we can computationally process
and analyse. To do so, we transform each magazine issue M in our dataset to
a vector of words (Bag of Words). We run a set of pre-processing steps and
convert all words to lower-case, remove all stop-words (e.g., and, or, the) and
punctuation marks (e.g., . ,  ?). We perform lemmatization aiming to remove
inflectional endings and return words to their roots in order to avoid duplicates
of the same word. For example, words with different endings (e.g., killed, killing)
will be mapped to a single word (e.g., kill) [180].
After pre-processing the text, the first step focuses on extracting n-grams from
the magazines in order to capture not only the words, but the context in which
they were used. Each magazine M is now represented as a vector containing the

n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3). We then calculate a composite weight weighti,j for each
gram gi occurring in a given article Mi using term-frequency inverse-document-
frequency (tf-idf) as follows:
weighti,j = tf(gi,Mj)  log(
where tf(gi,Mj) is the frequency of gram gi in magazine Mj, N is the total
number of issues in the corpus, and dfi is the total number of magazines that
contain the gram gi.
After applying this process to each magazine issue in our dataset, we get a
weighted matrix of size m n, where m is the number of magazine issues we have
in the dataset, and n is the number of unique grams in the corpus. Grams with
high weights means that they are more important in our collective corpus.
The second step in our approach is to create a word embedding model for the
radical corpus. A popular idea in modern machine learning is to represent words by
vectors, as vectors capture hidden information about the language, such as word
analogies or semantic aspects. It is also used to improve the performance of text
classifiers. Research in NLP has studied the effectiveness of word embedding methods
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 106
for encoding semantic meaning and found that semantic relationships between
words are best captured using vectors representations within word embedding
models [181]. We train word2vec model [134] on our corpus to build the lexical
semantic aspects of the text using vector space models. We learned word embeddings
using skip-gram Word2Vec model implemented in the gensim package2 with vector
size of 100 and window size of 5.
The final step in the analysis of the extremist content is to investigate the
psycholinguistic properties of the text. Research in fields such as linguistics, social
science, and psychology suggests that the use of language and the word choices
we make in our daily communication, can act as a powerful signal to detect our
emotional and psychological states [182]. Several psychological properties are
unintentionally transmitted when we communicate. It can be detected in the
way we speak or express ourselves in writing. For example, research in the field
of psychology has found relations between the choices of words and symptoms
like depression, suicide, and anxiety [183]. Moreover, previous research studied
the social psychology of online interaction and investigated the extent to which
principles of social psychology carry over into the online domain. Indeed, Li and
Chignell [184] found that online blog readers are significantly more attracted to
blog writers with similar personalities.
Different text analysis tools and dictionaries have been developed and used in
the literature to identify psychological properties from written text. One of the very
first tools to achieve this is LIWC [102]. The tool focuses on counting the frequencies
of words occurring in a given text and mapping these to a set of pre-defined lexical
categories, such as emotions (e.g., anger, fear), social interests (e.g., family, friends),
morality foundation (e.g., care/harm, authority/subversion), and cognitive processes
(e.g., certainty, tentative). These categories together can paint a picture of the
authors interests, personality, and emotional states as conveyed in the analysed
text. Although LIWC is not a personality measure in itself, previous work has found
strong associations between LIWC categories and personality measures [103105].

6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 107
They demonstrated the ability of these computerised text analysis tools to detect
psychological meaning in different experimental settings [105]. By utilising the
LIWC dictionary, we analyse the text in our corpus (CRAD) and calculate the
frequencies of words that map to the different categories.
6.3 Results
6.3.1 Textual Analysis of Dabiq Magazines
First, we perform a macro level analysis by looking at the top scoring TF-IDF
grams in CRAD. Among the top scoring grams in the corpus are words related
to Islamic concepts, which is expected as the group focuses on associating its
legitimacy with religion. Grams such as Allah, Islamic state, Muslim were among
the top scoring grams in the corpus together with Arabic words such as Khilafah,
Jihad, Ummah (nation).
To discover the main topics present in the corpus, we apply topic modelling tech-
niques using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm [185]. We find common
themes that appear across different issues, and these are Religion, war/violence,
and people/places. Given that the group is using religion to legitimise their
action, the articles contain a heavy Islamic tone, which is apparent through the
excessive use of words such as Allah, Muslim, and Islam which all appear among
the top 10 weighted words. Additionally, words such as Kuffar (infidels), Hijrah
(migrate), and Khalifa (ruler) are used. Moreover, references to other religious
groups such as Jews, Christians are becoming more present in later issues of Dabiq,
mainly Issue#13 and Issue#15.
In terms of the war/violence theme, it includes grams corresponding to religiously
motivated wars such as crusade and Jihad. Additionally, another interesting finding
is that in Dabiq articles words like fight had higher weights than kill, and war had
higher weights than attack, & blood. This may be a conscious strategy to legitimise
their activities in the eyes of the reader by giving it such a lawful impression.
As for the people/places theme, we can see, for instance, that places including
Iraq, Syria appear frequently, which aligns with the origins of both groups and

their geopolitical standings. Also, locations related to where they carried attacks
and locations of their declared enemies like Paris and America are among the
top weighted words.
To have a better understanding of the topics discussed in each issue and how
they changed over time, we extract the top scoring grams per issue. However, first
we filter out grams related to generic religious terms such as Allah, Islam, Muslims,
and terms referencing names such as Abu, Ibn, Ibrahim, Mohammad to focus our
analysis and extract relevant topics of each magazine issue. Table 6.2 presents a
list of the top scoring grams in each issue of the Dabiq magazine.

Figure 6.2: Cosine Similarity of the 15 Dabiq issues
Moreover, to identify the overall similarity between each issue of Dabiq magazine,
we calculate the cosine similarity between the weighted vector representation for
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 110
each issue. Figure 6.2 shows a heat map comparing the different Dabiq issues.
We can see from the Figure that there are two odd parts where the similarity
scores are decreasing. Mainly, Issues #6 and #15 are quite distinct and seem
to have different focus from all other issues. For instance, Issue#15 which is the
last published issue of Dabiq to date focuses on other religious groups, mainly
Christians, while Issue#6 seem to focus on other Jihadi groups such as organisation
(Tandhim) of al-Qaeda in Waziristan (Table 6.2).
6.3.2 Word Embeddings for Radical Propaganda
After exploring the general themes and topics discussed in Dabiq issues and the
main keywords used in each issue, we want to investigate the relationship between
words used in the context of ISIS propaganda. To do so, we use word embeddings
to capture these semantic connections.
We train a word embedding model on the corpus to obtain a vector representation
for each word. We then build a semantic network of the top 500 scoring words
(TF-IDF), such that we calculate the cosine-similarity score between each of these
words. This will result in a graph (571 nodes, 2965 edges), where nodes represent
words, edges represent a similarity relationship, and edge weights represent the
similarity score. In other words, every node (word) will be connected to other
words close to it in the vector-space [186].
Figure 6.3 represents the giant component of the semantic network. We use
a modularity algorithm [187] to measure the network modularity and partition
the network into communities (groups of semantically related words). Words are
scaled based on weighted degree measure.
To validate if the model is able to capture semantics of the Dabiq magazine, we
query the model to get the most similar semantic neighbours of some selected words.
For example, the word taghut is most similar to some political figures such as
Erdogan and Saddam which gives an indication that ISIS view these politicians
as tyrant and evil. Moreover, the word Kuffar (infidel) is mostly associated with

words appearing in ISIS propaganda are available in Table 6.3.
6.3.3 Psycholinguistic Properties of Dabiq
Literature from the fields of terrorism and psychology suggests that terrorists may
differ from non-terrorists in their psychological profiles [172, 188]. A number of
studies looked at the motivating factors surrounding terrorism, radicalisation, and
recruitment tactics. Terrorist groups tend to target vulnerable individuals who

have feelings of desperation and displaced aggression. In particular, research into
the recruiting tactics of the ISIS group found that they focus on harnessing the
individuals need for significance. They seek out vulnerable people and provide
them with constant attention [189]. Similarly, these groups create a dichotomy and
promote the mentality of dividing the world into us versus them [190].
Inspired by previous research, we extract psychological properties from the
radical corpus in order to understand the personality, emotions, and the different
psychological properties conveyed in these articles. Using existing psycholinguistic
lexicons (e.g., LIWC dictionaries), we explore the different categories related to
emotions, drivers, morality, and personality and compare how these properties
change across issues and over time.
We analyse the text in our corpus (CRAD) and calculate the frequencies of words
that map to different categories. In a macro scale, we look at the following properties:
Summary variables  Analytically thinking which reflects formal, logical, and
hierarchical thinking (high value), versus informal, personal, and narrative thinking
(low value). Clout which reflects high expertise and confidence levels (high value),
versus tentative, humble, and anxious levels (low value). Tone which reflects positive
emotions (high value) versus more negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, or
anger (low value). Authentic which reflects whether the text is conveying honesty
and disclosing (high value) versus more guarded, and distanced (low value).
Our analysis shows that the magazines reflect confidence and formal logical
thinking style with high scores of analytical thinking and clout. Adopting this style
of writing for the propaganda material may reflect why they have been successful
in their recruitment campaigns. On the other hand, low scores for tone reveal high

levels of negative emotions being conveyed in the text. Similarly, low scores for
authenticity suggests more guarded and deceptive text (Figure 6.4a).
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 114
OCEAN / Big five  Measures the five personality traits, namely Openness,
Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Looking at the
Big Five personality properties, derived from LIWC dictionaries, we find that Dabiq
articles exhibit significant levels of neuroticism followed by conscientiousness and
extraversion, while the text showed lower levels for openness and agreeableness.
This suggests that the text conveys high levels of anxiety, depression, and anger due
to high neruoticism, as well as high conscientiousness which is typically associated
with being focused and non impulsive (Figure 6.4b).
Emotional Analysis  Previous research that studied the motivations of
terrorism has mostly focused on the role of negative emotions such as anger, hate, and
anxiety. For example, anger has been linked in the literature as a mobilising emotion
for motivating collective group actions [191]. It is equally important to examine the
role of positive emotions such as love and compassion in activating and motivating
extremists [192]. Therefore, this property measures the emotions conveyed in the
text from both positive and negative sides (including anger, sadness, anxiety). The
results show that both emotions are conveyed in the text, although the negative
emotion is higher mainly due to the prevalence of the anger emotion (Figure 6.4c).
Personal Drives  Focuses on five personal drives, namely power, reward, risk,
achievement, and affiliation [105]. The analysis revealed a significant effect of power.
This may be linked to the purpose of these magazines which is to advertise their
strength and recruit and attract individuals (Figure 6.4d).
Personal Pronouns  Counts the number of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd personal
pronouns used. The analysis for the use of personal pronouns reflects the dichotomy
mentality of us-vs-them. The articles focus more on the 3rd person pronouns (they,
she, he) as opposed to less focus on the use of 1st person pronouns (I, we). This
suggests high levels of extremism as found in previous research that reveals high
use of 3rd person plural pronouns (e.g., they) is one of the predictors of extremism
since this suggests that the group is defining themselves against the existence of an
opposite group [193]. In addition, it is interesting to note that the use of the second
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 115
person pronoun (you) is higher than first person singular pronouns (I), which shows
the strategy of these magazines in making the focus more on the reader (Figure 6.4e).
Morality  The moral foundations theory [194] is a psychological theory that
describes how morality differs between cultures and yet shares some fundamental
characteristics. The universal moral foundations that hold across cultures as
described by the theory are: (1) harm and care, (2) fairness and cheating, (3)
authority and subversion, (4) purity and degradation, (5) loyalty/in-group and
betrayal/out-group. The theory suggest that cultures differ on the degree to which
they build virtues on these five foundations. For instance, if we take political
parties as an example, political liberals value virtues based on the harm/care and
fairness/cheating foundations, while conservatives value virtues based on all five
foundations [195]. We analyse the five morality foundations across all Dabiq issues
and found overall very low scores for morality with the two most valued virtues
being authority and care (Figure 6.4f).
Micro Level Analysis  We want to investigate how the different properties
evolve over time across different Dabiq issues. Such micro level analysis revealed
some interesting observations and trends as seen in Figure 6.5 and Figure 6.6.
The morality values associated with each issue of Dabiq magazine are shown
in Figure 6.5a and Figure 6.5b. The authority foundation was at its peak in the
very first issue published as the group needed to establish respect and legitimate
authority. We then notice a drop until Issue#3 when it starts to pick up again with
minor fluctuations. Similarly, the care foundation shows some major fluctuations
with two main peaks in the 5th and the 13th issues before it drops again to a
level similar to that of the first issue.
With regards to the drives and motives of the magazines, power, achievement,
and affiliation are the core drives and needs present in each issue of Dabiq. As
shown in Figure 6.5c, power fluctuates over time with peaks in the 1st and 4th issues.
Similarly, affiliation-related words show minor fluctuations with a tendency to
increase over time as opposed to achievement-related words which seem to decrease
over time. By comparing the first and last issues of Dabiq, we see how ISIS tended

to convey more power and sense of achievement in its propaganda at the start but
then these drives decreased by the time of the last publication. On the other hand,
the sense of affiliation had an opposite trend as it grew over time.
Looking at how the OCEAN variables change over time (Figure 6.5d), we see an
overall increase for the openness property over time until it peaks in the last issue,
while conscientiousness shows an opposite decreasing pattern. This suggests that the
group propaganda strategy over time may have been less focused than in their first
issue. Similarly, studies suggest that low scores for conscientiousness may be linked
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 117
to more antisocial and criminal behaviour [196, 197]. Furthermore, extraversion
show a significant fluctuation behaviour across different issues, while agreeableness
had significant spikes in the 3rd, 8th, and last issues. Finally, neuroticism has
remained at similar levels following a spike in the 4th issue.
Moreover, as we have seen from the macro analysis both positive and negative
emotions are properties conveyed in Dabiq magazines. Comparing the distribution
of positive and negative emotions across each issue (Figure 6.5e) reveals fluctuations
with negative emotions slightly higher across the majority of the issues with
exceptions in the 1st, 11th, and the last two issues). The negative emotion peaks
in the 7th issue which, upon examination, shows that the issues feature articles
focus on who ISIS deem to be enemies of Islam including other Islamic groups,
leaders, and the west [198].
Looking at the use of personal pronouns over time (Figure 6.5f), we see an
overall increase in using more 3rd person plural pronouns such as they until
about the 13th issue where it starts to drop. Similarly, the emphasis seem to be
more on the reader through the use of you pronoun which tends to increase
until it spikes in the last issue of Dabiq.
Moreover, one of the main themes prevalent in ISIS is religion. Figure 6.6a
shows how this theme is mostly steady across all issues with the exception of two
drops in issue 6 that focus on rejection of other Jihadi groups and issue 12 that
followed the 2016 Paris attack [199]. Moreover, the final issue of Dabiq shows a
peak in its focus on the topic of religion even exceeding the initial peak in issue#1.
This is in line with our observation while analysing the topics for each issue as the
focus in the final issue seems to be on motivating war against other religious groups.
The emotional tone (Figure 6.6b) shows an interesting pattern as it started with
very high levels in Issue#1 and dropped after that in the following issues before
it peaked again in the last couple of issues. Another inclination in the levels of
emotional tone is observed in Issue#11, which focuses on out-group conflict and
builds on different conspiracy theories against ISIS [199].

The last variable we will look at is the analytical thinking variable (Figure 6.6c).
Overall, the variable scores are high (over 80%), with its highest levels in the very
first issue and its lowest in the final issue with fluctuations in between. This suggests
that ISIS approach to constructing the propaganda has changed over time which
may be related to the groups sustained losses in territory.
6.4 Discussion
In this chapter we made progress in understanding how extremist propaganda is
constructed by attempting to computationally identify the different hidden markers
that are associated with propaganda published by the ISIS group. We analysed the
text published in all issues of Dabiq magazines from textual and psycholinguistic
perspectives to uncover generic themes, topics, and psycholinguistic properties
as depicted in the the ISIS propaganda.
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 119
The textual analysis of the articles showed several themes that appear across
different issues. As expected, religiously motivated violence was the main overarching
theme across all issues. Similarly, the motivation for war and violence against the
declared enemies of ISIS included groups such as other Jihadi groups, Islamic
politicians, and the West. In addition, the contextual analysis of the relations
between different words used by ISIS allowed us to extract semantic meaning of how
they describe different concepts. Using word embeddings to represent the different
words appearing in the articles, allows us to extract semantic relations between
words such that words with similar meanings will have similar representations and
thus cluster together. This approach revealed a number of interesting semantic
associations regarding the ISIS ideology. For example, the association between
Taghut (tyrant) and a number of political figures shows how ISIS portrays those
politicians. Similarly, the high similarity between Jihad and words such as
defensive and Fard (obligation) illustrates how ISIS portrays jihad as a defensive
tactic and as an obligation to all followers.
Moreover, the psycholinguistic analysis revealed that the magazines exhibit
strong emotions from both positive and negative sides. The most prevalent negative
emotion is the anger emotion, which as suggested in the literature, is typically
considered one of the main mobilising factors for groups [191]. Additionally, looking
at the Big Five psychological traits, we found that the neuroticism trait is extremely
dominant throughout the 15 issues followed by the conscientiousness trait, while
the agreeableness trait was the weakest of all five. The analysis of the morality
foundations showed that the main valued virtues for ISIS are authority, care,
and in-group loyalty.
In order to identify if these properties are capturing radical signals or are common
across any normal discourse. We need to compare the results against a control
group. To capture the properties related to a normal non-radical discourse (i.e.,
a control group), we used a dataset consisting of different news articles. The data 3
include articles from different publishers, such as the New York Times, CNN, and

The Guardian. The articles discuss a range of topics and include a mix of print
and digital publications. We randomly sampled 31 articles with varying lengths,
such that the lengths are comparable to those in the Dabiq magazine. A summary
of the news dataset control group is presented in Table 6.4.
To identify if mean differences between properties of both groups are statistically
significant or merely due to chance, we perform an unpaired two-sample comparison
using MannWhitney U test at the 5% level of significance ( = 0.05). The
null-hypothesis (H0) is formulated such that there is no difference among the
groups (the radical propaganda and the news groups). Alternatively, rejecting
the null hypothesis means that the two groups are different. We report the mean
scores of all properties for both Dabiq and News groups in Appendix A Table A.1.
The results of the test showed that the differences between means of a number
of properties are significant. For instance, properties related to the us-vs-them
dichotomy (Figure 6.7a), the clout and authentic properties of the summary variables
(Figure 6.7b), and the authority and degradation morality foundations (Figure 6.7c)
were indeed significantly different from those of the control group.
It is critical that we discuss the topic of warning behaviours, in the context of
extremism, as a method to identify a set of indicators that may precede an act of
violence. Meloy et al. [200] have identified the following eight warning behaviours:
(1)Pathway, any behaviour that is part of research, planning, preparation, or
implementation of an attack. (2) Fixation, any behaviour that indicates an
increasing pathological obsession with a person or a cause. (3) Identification, the
identification with a group or larger cause and have a warrior-like mentality. (4)
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 121
(a) Personal Pronouns (b) Summary Variables (c) Morality
Figure 6.7: Comparison of Dabiq properties v.s. News Articles
Novel aggression, a behaviour change that results in acts of violence committed
for the first time. (5) Energy burst, an increase in the frequency of activities
(related to the target) before the attack. (6) Leakage, any leak of the intent
through communication to a third party. (7) Last resort, where the subject feels
increasing desperation forcing them into a position of last resort. (8) Directly
communicated threats, where a threat is communicated to the target (implicitly
or explicitly) explaining an intent to do harm.
Some of these warning behaviours are implicit and relate to the psychological
properties of the subject (e.g., fixation and identification) while others can be
explicitly identified through actions (e.g., energy burst and novel aggression). In
light of our analysis, we reflect on some of these indicators (warning behaviour) in
the context of ISIS. For instance, the fixation behaviour of the group is manifested
in topics of religiously motivated violence against out-groups. Similarly, the group
fixation with properties such as power and authority is prevalent from our analysis.
Additionally, identification is established through the dichotomy of in-group and
out-group by alienating enemies of ISIS and refusing what they call grey-zone (i.e.,
if you are not with us you are against us). As demonstrated in Figure 6.7a, this
property clearly differs from a normal discourse of news articles, mainly through the
focus on the other (i.e., they) and the ratio use of you to I. Similarly, the focus
on the language that supports sense of affiliation and care feeds into enhancing the
identification level of the reader with the group. The manifestation of last resort
mentality was established by utilising emotional language with special focus on
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 122
the anger negative emotion, which can be linked to preparing the reader into a
desperation state and trying to justify the use of violence as a last resort.
6.5 Limitations and Implications
To understand ISIS extremist narrative and ideology, our method focused on
analysing the textual content of Dabiq magazine. We used the text of the magazine
as a proxy to identify underlying properties related to psychological and personality
traits. These magazines are carefully crafted by ISIS and created with great effort
and resources to reflect how they want to appeal to their supporters and the public.
However, analysing the personality traits through the text is representative of the
authors of the magazine articles (members of ISIS) rather than being representative
of the whole group. The identified properties describing the extremist narrative is
not meant to be generalised to other extremist groups. Further analysis is required
of different extremist narratives to evaluate if the approach can be applied to other
groups before attempting to generalise the findings. We will touch on this topic
towards the end of this thesis. Finally, as the method applied is quantitative, future
validation of the study results through a combination of qualitative analysis of the
magazines and expert interviews would complement the findings.
Through this study, we addressed our third research question by identifying
properties and signals that describe ISIS strategy in crafting their propaganda
material. For example, the use of personal pronouns shows the emphasis on the
dichotomy between the in-group and out-group. This is an important strategy to
create fixation with group identity and increase the readers association with the
group. Similarly, the main group drive being depicted through the propaganda is
power, which reflects the image they try to communicate to the readers. Having
such an understanding of the ideology and propaganda strategy adopted by ISIS is
important to law enforcement and other stakeholders such as social media platforms
to improve the narrative of counter-terrorism communication. In the following
chapter, we will show how we utilise this understanding in building a system to
detect the spread of extremist narrative online.
6. Identifying Signals of Extremist Propaganda 123
6.6 Summary
In this chapter, we analysed all issues of Dabiq magazine to reveal characteristics
related to ISIS recruitment and propaganda strategy. We adopted computational
methods to analyse the propaganda and reveal underlying signals related to the
ideology and recruitment strategies of the group. We used data-mining techniques to
identify key linguistic and psycholinguistic properties represented in ISIS propaganda.
The analysis showed that the main drive for the ISIS group is power, which is
expected as they aim to recruit and attract individuals. Additionally, the propaganda
published in Dabiq illustrates traits such as confidence and formal logical thinking
styles. Adopting this style of writing for the propaganda material may reflect why
they have been successful in their recruitment campaigns. The dichotomy mentality
of us-vs-them is reflected in the Dabiq articles, and this was exposed based on the
distinction of using 3rd person pronouns (they, she, he) and the use of 1st person
pronouns (I, we) in the articles. Moreover, the use of the 2nd person pronoun (you)
was higher compared with other pronouns. This reveals a strategy used by these
magazines to put the focus and emphasis on the reader.
Informed with the results of this analysis, in the next chapter, we will integrate
the different models and properties learned in a pipeline to detect pro-ISIS users
in OSN. We hypothesise that supporters of ISIS may share similar characteristics
to the ones that are conveyed in the ISIS propaganda.
Detection of Radicalisation on
Microblogging platforms
7.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we aim to study the effects of using textual and psycholinguistic
signals to detect online extremist content. These signals are developed based on
the insights gathered from analysing propaganda material published by extremist
groups (Chapter 6). Mainly, we will focus on detecting pro-ISIS supporters on
Twitter, as they are one of the leading terrorist groups that have utilised Twitter to
gain a wide audience, disseminate their propaganda, and recruit individuals.
In summary, the main contributions of this chapter are as follows:
 Design and develop a system to detect online radical content using properties
inferred from radical magazines.
 Develop a general psychological profile for radicals inferred from the ISIS
propaganda material. This profile acts as a baseline that is used to develop a
radical distance measure.
 Evaluate our system on Twitter focusing on the detection of pro-ISIS tweets.
We show how psychological and radical language models can be used to
improve the detection mechanisms of radical content on Twitter.
7. Detection of Radicalisation on Microblogging platforms 125
Figure 7.1: Approach Overview
7.2 System Design
We define our task as a binary classification problem where we classify tweets as ISIS
supporters or not. An overview of the approach is illustrated in Figure 7.1 with three
main steps: (1) Data pre-processing, (2) Feature engineering, (3) Classification and
Validation. We utilise the models generated from the previous chapter to engineer
textual and psycholinguistic features related to radical activities. In addition, we
look at behavioural patterns that are relevant to OSNs and Twitter in particular
to capture activities of pro-ISIS users.
We explore three categories of information to identify relevant features to detect
radical content. Some features are user-based while others are message-based. The
three categories are: (1) Radical language (Textual feature FT ), (2) Psychological
signals (Psychological features FP ), and (3) Behavioural features (FB). In the
following, we detail each of these categories.
7.2.1 Radical Language
In Chapter 6, we explored the different topics, textual properties, and linguistic
cues related to the propaganda produced by ISIS. We conjecture that these textual
properties would be shared by people influenced by it.

We select the top scoring TF-IDF grams from the propaganda corpus and use
them as features for the language model. N-grams and words frequency have
been used in the literature to classify similar problems, such as hate-speech and
extremist text and have proven successful [201].
Moreover, in order to get the vector representation for words in tweets. We
use the method described in Section 3.4.1 of Chapter 3 to seed the model using
available pre-trained Twitter embeddings that has been trained on 1-billion tweets.
Then, we update these embeddings based on the specialised corpus of Dabiq. Thus,
we obtain the word embedding 100-dimension vector representation for each word
in the tweet. We then aggregate the vectors for a single tweet, and concatenate the
maximum and average for each word vector dimension, such that any given tweet
is now represented by a 200 dimension sized vector [202]. Figure 7.2 illustrates
an example of the tweet embedding process.
Furthermore, since ISIS supporters typically advocate violent behaviour and

tend to use offensive language, we use dictionaries of violent words1 and curse
words2 to record the ratio of such words in the tweet. We also measure frequencies
of words featuring all capital letters as they are usually used to convey a shouting
behaviour. A summary of the textual-based features (FT ) is presented in Table 7.1.
7.2.2 Psycholinguistic Signals
Previous research found that online personality may be signalled by several linguistic
cues [184]. Similarly, studies found that analysis of language used in social media
communication can be utilised for gaining psychological insights of the authors [203].
Furthermore, previous research [204206] looking at the motivating factors
surrounding terrorism, radicalisation, and recruitment tactics found that terrorist
groups tend to target vulnerable individuals who have feelings of desperation
and displaced aggression. In particular, research into recruiting tactics of ISIS
group found that they focus on harnessing the individuals need for significance.
They seek out vulnerable people and provide them with constant attention [189].
Therefore, we explore the effect of psycholinguistic features on the detection of
tweets supporting ISIS.
Using the psycholinguistic properties described in Chapter 6, we calculate
the properties scores and create a psycholinguistic profile (psyc-profile) for each
Twitter user. Additionally, we calculate a distance measure (psyc-profile-dist)
using Manhattan distance that measures the distance between each of the users
created psych-profiles and the average scores of the psycholinguistic properties

is presented in Table 7.2.
7.2.3 Behavioural Signals
This category consists of measuring behavioural features to capture different
properties related to the user and their behaviour. We focus on behaviours that can
be used to describe some of the warning behaviours described in Chapter 6. For
example, energy burst warning behaviour can be measured using levels of users
activity (i.e., frequency of tweets posted), #followers,#following, and #hashtags and
URLs used. Similarly, identification can be measured based on following/followers
behaviour of known pro-ISIS accounts. Additionally, we use features to capture users
engagement and interactions with others through using hashtags, and engagement
in discussions using mention, reply, and retweet actions.
Moreover, to capture the users influence in their network, we construct an
interaction graph (GM) from our dataset, such that GM = (U,E), where U
represents the users nodes and E represents the set of edges. The graph GM
is a directed graph, where an edge e exists between two user nodes A and B, if
user A mentions (replies to) user B. After constructing the graph, we measure
the degree of influence each user has using different centrality measures, including
degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and HITS-Hub. Such properties have
been adopted in the research literature to study characteristics of cyber-criminal

networks and their behaviour [173], [207]. A summary of the behaviour-based
features (FB) is presented in Table 7.3.
7.3 Experimental Setup
We perform multiple experiments and compare the performance of our approach.
In this section, we describe how each experiment is constructed, the data used,
and the adopted evaluation metrics.
7.3.1 Dataset
We acquired a publicly available dataset of tweets posted by known pro-ISIS Twitter
accounts that was published during the 2015 Paris attacks by Kaggle data science
community 3. The dataset consist of around 17, 000 tweets posted by more than 100
users. These tweets were labelled as being pro-ISIS by looking at specific indicators,
such as a set of keywords used (in the users name, description, tweet text), their
network of follower/following of other known radical accounts, and the sharing of
images of the ISIS flag or some radical leaders. To validate that these accounts are
indeed malicious, we checked the current status of the users accounts in the dataset
and found that most of them have been suspended by Twitter. This suggests that
they did in fact demonstrate malicious behaviour that opposes the Twitter platform
terms of use which caused them to be suspended. We filter out any tweets posted
by existing active users and label this dataset as known-bad.
To model the normal behaviour, we collected a random sample of tweets from
ten trending topics on Twitter using the Twitter streaming API. These topics were
3www.kaggle.com/fifthtribe/how-isis-uses-twitter/data
www.kaggle.com/fifthtribe/how-isis-uses-twitter/data
7. Detection of Radicalisation on Microblogging platforms 130
related to news events and on-going social events (e.g., sports, music). We filter
out any topics and keywords that may be connected to extremist views using a
dictionary of violent and abusive terms. This second dataset consists of around
8, 000 tweets published by around 1, 000 users. A random sample of 200 tweets
was manually verified to ascertain it did not contain radical views. We label this
dataset as our random-good data.
A third dataset is used which was acquired from Kaggle community4. This
dataset is created to be a counterpoise to the pro-ISIS dataset (our known-bad)
as it consist of tweets talking about topics concerning ISIS without being radical.
It contains 122, 000 tweets from around 95, 000 users collected on two separate
days. We verify that this dataset is indeed non radical by checking the status
of users on Twitter and found that a subset (24, 000 users) was suspended. We
remove those from the dataset and only keep users that are still active on Twitter.
This dataset is labelled as counterpoise data.
7.3.2 Data Preprocessing
We perform a series of preprocessing steps to clean the complete dataset and
prepare it for feature extraction. These steps are:
1. We remove any duplicates from the dataset in order to reduce noise.
2. We filter out any non-English tweets.
3. We remove tweets that have been authored by verified users accounts, as
they are typically accounts associated with known public figures.
4. All stop words (e.g., and, or, the) and punctuation marks are removed from
the text of the tweet.
5. If the tweet text contains a URL, we record the existence of the URL in a
new attribute, hasURL, and then remove it from the tweet text.

7. Detection of Radicalisation on Microblogging platforms 131
6. If the tweet text contains emojis (e.g., :-), :), :P), we record the existence of
the emoji in a new attribute, hasEmj, and then remove it from the tweet text.
7. If the tweet text contains any words with all capital characters, we record
its existence in a new attribute, allCaps, and then normalise the text to
lower-case and filter out any non-alphabetic characters.
8. We tokenize the cleansed tweet text into words, then we perform lemmatization,
the process of reducing inflected words to their roots (lemma), and store the
result in a vector.
7.3.3 Classifier Design
We conduct two experiments using the datasets described in Section 7.3.1. Our
hypothesis is that supporters of groups such as ISIS may exhibit similar textual and
psychological properties when communicating on social media, to the properties
seen in the propaganda magazines. A tweet is considered radical if it promotes
violence, racism, or supports violent behaviour.
In exp 1 we use the first two datasets, i.e., the known-bad and the random-good
datasets to classify tweets into radical and normal classes. For exp 2 we examine if
our classifier can also distinguish between tweets that are discussing similar topics
(ISIS related) by using the known-bad and the counterpoise datasets.
The classification task is binomial (binary) classification where the output of
the model predicts whether the input tweet is considered radical or normal. In
order to handle the imbalanced class problem in the dataset, there are multiple
techniques in the literature to tackle this issue. Over-sampling or under-sampling
of the minority/majority classes are common techniques. Another technique that is
more related to the classification algorithm is cost sensitive learning, which penalises
the classification model for making a mistake on the minority class. This is achieved
by applying a weighted cost on the misclassifying of the minority class [208]. We
will use the last approach to avoid down-sampling of our dataset.

the best performance. We only report results obtained using RF model. We
configured the model to use 100 estimators trees with a maximum depth of 50, and
we selected gini impurity for the split criteria. We used the out-of-bag samples (oob)
score to estimate the generalisation accuracy of the model. Additionally, since RF
tends to be biased towards the majority class, we apply the cost sensitive learning
method described earlier to make RF more suitable for imbalanced data [208].
We divide the dataset to training set (80%) and testing set (20%), where the
testing set is held out for validation. We report validation results using different
combinations of the features categories (i.e., FT , FB, FP ) and different evaluation
metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure, and area under the ROC curve.

7.4.1 Exp 1: Identifying Pro-ISIS Tweets
The classification results using the known-bad and random-good datasets are reported
in Table 7.4. The table shows the average accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure
scores obtained from each feature category (FT , FP , FB) and their combination (FAll).
We also compared the two textual models, and found that results obtained from using
word embedding outperforms the use of n-grams TF-IDF scores. This confirms
that contextual information is important in detecting radicalisation activities.
Furthermore, our model performs best using the FP features across all metrics. This
means that the model is able to distinguish between both radical and non-radical
with high confidence using only FP .
7.4.2 Exp 2: Detecting Radicals from ISIS-related Tweets
In this experiment we test the performance of our classifier in distinguishing between
radical and normal tweets that discusses ISIS related topics. Although this task is
more challenging given the similarity of the topic discussed in the two classes, yet we
found that the model still achieves high performance. Table 7.5 shows the different
metrics obtained from each feature category. The FT feature group obtained 80%
accuracy, and 91%, 100% for FB and FP feature groups, respectively. The results
are consistent with the ones obtained from the first experiment with the features

7.4.3 Exp 3: Longitudinal Study for Pro-ISIS Users
One of the main limitations of the previous two experiments is the relatively
small number of observations which are collected over a small time span. Thus, we
performed a third experiment on a larger dataset collected over a long period of time.
We obtained a dataset of accounts associated with ISIS members and sym-
pathisers, which has been manually validated via crowd-sourcing initiative called
Lucky Troll Club. This data has been also verified by Twitters anti-abuse team
manually and all the accounts related to ISIS have been suspended due to the
violation of Twitters Terms of Service policy [209]. The data consist of around
25, 000 Twitter accounts. These users were responsible for posting over 1.9 million
tweets from January 2014 to June 2015 [210, 211]. This data is labelled as ClassRad.
Furthermore, to model the normal behaviour ClassNorm we collected tweets from
the top 20 most occurring hashtags in the radical tweets, that were published during
the same period and their authors still have active accounts in Twitter.
We tested our model on the new dataset and report the results in Table 7.6.
The results are comparable with the previous experiments. Using the feature
group FT we get f-measure of 77%, which is 3% lower from Exp2. The same
trend is true for feature group FB. However, for the FP features, the results are
consistent at 100% f-measure.

7.5 Feature Importance
We investigate which features contribute most to the classification task to distinguish
between radical and non-radical tweets. We use the mean decrease impurity method
of random forests [212] to identify the most important features in each feature
category. The ten most important features are shown in Table 7.7. We found that
the most important feature for distinguishing radical tweets is the psychological
feature distance measure. This measures how similar the twitter user is to the
average psychological profile calculated from the propaganda magazine articles.
Following this is the Us-them dichotomy which looks at the total number of
pronouns used (I,they, we, you). This finding is in-line with the tactics reported in
the radicalisation literature with regards to emphasising the separation between
the radical group and the world.
Moreover, among the top contributing features are behavioural features related to
the number of mentions a single user makes, and their HITS hub and authority rank
among their interaction network. This relates to how active the user is in interacting
with other users and how much attention they receive from their community. This
links to the objectives of those radical users in spreading their ideologies and reaching
out to potential like-minded people. As for the FT category we found that the
use of word2vec embedding improves the performance in comparison with using
the TF-IDF features. Additionally, all bi-grams and tri-grams features did not
7. Detection of Radicalisation on Microblogging platforms 136
contribute much to the classification, only uni-grams did. This can be related to
the differences in the writing styles when constructing sentences and phrases in
articles and in the social media context, particularly given the limitation of the
number of words allowed by the Twitter platform. Additionally, the violent word
ratio, long-Words, and allCaps features are among the top contributing features
from this category. This finding correlates to high extent with observations from
the literature dealing with similar problems, where the use of dictionaries of violent
words aids with the prediction of violent extremist narrative.
7.6 Comparison with Related Work
There is a range of work that focuses on detecting online radicalisation activities and
analysing such behaviour. In Table 7.8 we compare the related work that focuses
on detecting online radicalisation activities on Twitter to our proposed approach
using a set of criteria. The comparison criteria looks at the size of dataset used to
evaluate the approach, the generalisability of the used features and how much it is
influenced by the used dataset. This is important as it can influence whether or not
the approach can be successful when applied to other datasets. Additionally, we
compare the types of features used, mainly sentiment, textual, behavioural, and
psychological features. Finally, the best performance measure obtained is reported.
From Table 7.8, we can see that the majority of the literature combines different
types of features to detect online radicalisation. This is important as each feature
type provides an insight and an additional signal that aids in distinguishing this
behaviour. The main limitation of previous work is the generalisability aspect,
as few articles adopted features that are independent of the testing dataset, or
performed an extensive evaluation of multiple datasets.
Moreover, some of the features proposed in the literature may seem similar to
our work, however, there are key differences that we would like to highlight. For
example, in the work of Ashcroft et al. [28] (achieved 100% accuracy), they used
stylometric features that contain a set of words that are most frequent in the dataset.
This raises the question of the applicability of the approach to different datasets.

Additionally, they used sentiment features to capture the polarity of the text from
being very negative to very positive. This method captures part of the psychology
of the writer (having negative, or positive emotion), however it reduces it to one
variable which does not capture the context of that emotion. Understanding the
context of the sentiment is important to detect radicalisation because it paints a
picture regarding what the positive/negative sentiment is about. For example, a
positive sentiment can be used to express radical ideas.
7.7 Limitations and Implications
In this section, we highlight some of the identified research limitations and the
potential implications of the study.
The dataset used in all three experiments were validated through crowd-sourcing
techniques. To guarantee the correctness of the validation, we performed a second
level of validation by checking the current status of the accounts on Twitter
(active/suspended). Thus, our ground-truth is reliant on what Twitters anti-
abuse team identify as abusive. Moreover, online extremism behaviour is constantly
evolving. Some radical extremist supporters are changing their tactics to avoid
detection by using different terminology and more subtle references to violence.
Since our textual and psycholinguistic features depend on the keywords used and
emotions expressed, the system might not be as successful in detecting those that
try to masquerade their support. As such, future work should investigate if the
7. Detection of Radicalisation on Microblogging platforms 138
model is resilient to different evasion techniques that radical supporters may adopt.
Furthermore, the textual and psycholinguistic features are language-dependant.
Currently, we focus only on the English language since the embedding model is
trained on English text and the LIWC dictionaries are for the English language. A
possible future study would be to expand and test the approach on other languages,
this can be achieved by adapting the embedding models and the LIWC dictionaries
based on the target language.
Our results show that using linguistic and psycholinguistic characteristics we
can accurately identify radical content. The radical psych-profile distance measure
has been found to have the most contributing effect to the detection task. Similarly,
using word embeddings trained on official published extremist propaganda we
can detect radical tweets with 76% accuracy. This result agrees with our earlier
hypothesis that suggests that supporters of extremist groups are influenced by the
published extremist propaganda and share psychological and linguistic properties.
Our system can aid law enforcement and OSN platforms to better address the
threat of online radical content and help solve a challenging real-world problem.
7.8 Summary
In this chapter, we identified different signals that can be utilised to detect evidence
of online radicalisation. We derived linguistic and psychological properties from
propaganda published by ISIS for recruitment purposes. We utilised these properties
to detect pro-ISIS tweets that are influenced by their ideology. Unlike previous
efforts, these properties do not only focus on lexical keyword analysis of the messages
but also add a contextual and psychological dimension. We validated our approach
using different experiments and the results show that this method is robust across
multiple datasets. The psychological features identified had an important role in
improving the overall detection accuracy of the model.
Discussion on Other Extremist Groups
8.1 Introduction
As we have seen in the previous chapter, the psycholinguistic profile was identified
as a powerful contributor to the successful detection of supporters for extremist
groups. Therefore, in this chapter, we wanted to investigate if different extremist
groups who originate from both similar and different ideologies share some of these
properties. We compare the linguistic properties of online propaganda material
published by different extremist groups against the properties of the Dabiq magazine
previously described in Chapter 6. Mainly, we study Al-Qaeda and Alternative
Right (Alt-Right) groups and compare their linguistic properties against those of
Dabiq and the control group. The aim of this chapter is to first highlight the
main similarities and differences between these groups in crafting their propaganda
material. Second, if similarities are identified, does that mean that our proposed
detection approach outlined in Chapter 7 would work on these different groups.
In our analysis we followed a similar methodology to the one described in
Chapter 6 to extract textual and psycholinguistic properties from the extremist
propaganda. We started by calculating the top-scoring grams based on TF-IDF
weights. Then, using LIWC and morality foundation dictionaries, we calculated
8. Discussion on Other Extremist Groups 140
(a) Grams for Inspire (b) Grams for Dabiq
Figure 8.1: Top TF-IDF grams
the frequencies of words that map to the different categories. Finally, we compared
the scores against Dabiq and the control group.
8.2 Al-Qaeda: Inspire Magazine
Inspire magazine is an online English magazine published by Al-Qaeda group in
the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Similar to Dabiq, it aims to radicalise individuals,
promote and justify the activities of the group, and improve the groups brand
and image. We collect all 17 issues of Inspire that were published between 2010
and 2016. Similar to Dabiq, each issue typically consists of a collection of articles,
editorial snippets, and visual images. We focus only on the text and discard
any graphical content.
Textual Analysis  Figure 8.1a presents the top-scoring grams ordered by
the TF-IDF values. As both groups stem from a similar ideology, we find several
similarities related to the general articles focus. Along with the religion theme
that is apparent through the top-scoring grams (e.g., Allah, Muslim), there seems
to be a big focus on the United States through the grams America (ranked 6th)
and American (ranked 8th). This is linked to the history of AL-Qaeda with the
US and how their leader, Osama bin Laden, declared war against the United
States [221]. Furthermore, terms such as Jihad (ranked 5th) have a strong presence
in the magazine, followed by terms representing violence such as war and kill.

Figure 8.2: Heat-map representing the cosine similarity values between articles published
by ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
We can see that there are a lot of similarities between ISIS and AL-Qaeda
concerning the topics and words they use, however, there are also some subtle
differences. For example, in Inspire the groups enemy is apparent, while in Dabiq,
we find a heavier Islamic tone and more focus on the concept of Khilafah that does
not seem to be as apparent in the Inspire articles. Similarly, topics of religiously
motivated wars (e.g., crusaders) are more prevalent in Dabiq than Inspire.
Furthermore, to measure the similarity between articles appearing in ISIS
publications and Al-Qaeda ones, we calculate the cosine similarity between their
vector representations. Cosine similarity has been widely used in the literature to
compare text documents in the vector space to determine the degree to which they
are similar. The values range between [0, 1], where 0 means that the documents
have no similar words, and 1 means that they are identical. Figure 8.2 shows a
8. Discussion on Other Extremist Groups 142
heat-map of the cosine similarity measure of magazines from both groups. We
can see from the figure that ISIS articles have high similarities among themselves
(cluster in the upper left corner) and Al-Qaeda articles have more similarities among
themselves (cluster in the lower right corner). In summary, although the articles
from both groups share some similar themes/topics, they do differ in the choice
of words used to express these topics.
Psycholinguistic Analysis  We analyse the Inspire articles to identify the
psycholinguistic profile for the magazine. We calculate the same properties described
in Chapter 6 for each Inspire magazine issue, and report the mean and standard
deviation (std) in Appendix A Table A.1. We then compare it to Dabiqs profile
and use the MannWhitney U test to identify if the difference between the groups
styles is significant or due to chance. Figure 8.3 shows a comparison between Dabiq
and Inspire with regards to some of the key properties.
Overall, both groups share similar trends across most of the properties. For
instance, Dabiq shows more analytic and clout signs for summary variables, while
Inspire exhibits higher levels of positive and negative emotions for emotion variables.
The main drive for both groups is power followed by affiliation. We see different
behaviour in the use of personal pronouns (Figure 8.3d). While Dabiq has a clear
focus on the other (i.e., out-group focus) through the emphasis on the use of
3rd person pronouns, Inspire focuses more on 1st person plural pronouns which
emphasise the in-group identity. Finally, looking at the morality foundations, both
groups share a similar moral foundation that focuses more on care and authority,
with Dabiq devotes significantly more attention to authority.
8.3 Alt-Right: American Renaissance Magazine
American Renaissance (AR) magazine is a monthly white supremacist online
publication by the New Century Foundation [222]. The foundation describes
itself as a race-realist, and has been described as alternative right (Alt-Right)
by The Guardian [223]. We collect 22 issues of AR 1 that were published between

2009 and 2012. After 2012, the group shifted to publishing online short articles,
rather than combined magazines. Similar to Dabiq, each issue typically consists
of a collection of articles, editorial snippets, and visual images. We extract the
text and discard any graphical content.
8. Discussion on Other Extremist Groups 144
Figure 8.4: Top TF-IDF grams for AR
Textual Analysis  Figure 8.4 presents the top TF-IDF scoring grams for
the Alt-Right propaganda. In line with the group focus on race and particularly
the supremacy of the white race, the top-ranked gram is indeed white. Similarly,
the groups ideology places emphasis on the alleged inferiority of other races and
particularly people of colour; this explains the high rank of black as the 2nd most
used gram. Furthermore, the American gram (ranked 3rd) is highly relevant since
the group is mainly based in the United States and is targeting an American
audience. In comparison with the top-ranked grams in Dabiq and Inspire, we
notice that AR does not place explicit emphasis on violence, which is clearly due
to the absence of violence-related grams.
Psycholinguistic Analysis  We analyse the articles in AR magazine to
identify the psycholinguistic profile for the magazine. We calculate the same
properties described in Chapter 6 for each AR magazine issue, and report the
mean and standard deviation (std) in Appendix A Table A.1. We then compare it

comparison between Dabiq and AR with regards to some of the key properties. A
complete comparison of the two groups properties is presented in Appendix A.
8. Discussion on Other Extremist Groups 146
Both groups share similar trends for the summary variables, emotions, and
drives. Dabiq exhibits higher negative emotion, mainly in the anger emotion and
AR exhibits a slightly higher sadness emotion. Additionally, both groups share
similar levels for the main drive, power.
Furthermore, when comparing the use of pronouns, we find that both groups
share the tendency to focus more on 3rd person pronouns, which is associated
with distinguishing between in-group/out-group identities. However, AR utilises
1st person pronouns more than 2nd person pronouns, unlike Dabiq which puts
the focus more on the reader.
Comparing the groups attitudes towards different concerns, as expected, we see
clear emphases on religion for Dabiq which is significantly higher than AR, while
AR focuses more on work-related issues. Finally, looking at the morality foundation,
the AR driving moral foundation is the in-group (loyalty) foundation followed by
authority. On the other hand, Dabiq is more motivated by authority and care.
8.4 Discussion
Online radical propaganda has been used as a way to promote extremist ideology and
gather support for their causes. Studies in the literature suggest that individuals who
are exposed to online extremist propaganda are influenced by it and are more likely to
use violence in support of their cause [224]. As a result, it is crucial to understand the
discourse of such propaganda and how it is created and crafted to deliver its message.
In this chapter, we compared different propaganda material published by three
different radical groups; two stem from religious ideology and one stem from racial
ideology. We found that there are some common properties and trends that appear
in the propaganda material of all three groups despite their ideology, and some
properties that are a group-focused. For instance, conveying emotion is a common
factor across all groups including both positive and negative emotions, with the
anger emotion being the main driving emotion for radical propaganda.
Furthermore, regardless of groups ideologies or causes, the main driving motives
being conveyed in the propaganda text are power followed by affiliation. Such a

projection of power and a sense of affiliation may be the reason why these groups
have been successful in gathering supporters and influencing people. Also, strong
group identification can be inferred from the text of all three groups. This is achieved
through the emphasis being focused on in-group and out-group mentality. In many
cases, radicalisation intensifies when people feel strong links to the groups identity
combined with feelings of being at risk and feeling threatened by the out-groups [225].
As for the main driving morality foundation for radical groups, we found that
each group varies slightly in terms of the main morality foundation, although
they are mainly focused around three morality foundations: authority, in-group
loyalty, and care. For example, while ISIS tends to show more authority in its
propaganda followed by care and in-group loyalty, AL-Qaeda focuses more on
care. On the other hand, Alt-Right group is concerned the most with in-group
loyalty followed by authority and care.
To identify if mean differences between groups properties are statistically signif-
icant or merely due to chance, we performed an unpaired two-sample comparison
of each of the radical groups against a set of news articles control group using
MannWhitney U test at the 5% level of significance ( = 0.05). The null-hypothesis
(H0) was formulated such that there was no difference among the groups (the radical
propaganda and the news groups). Alternatively, rejecting the null hypothesis means
that the two groups are different. In Table 8.1 we list the variables that resulted
in rejecting the null-hypothesis (p <= 0.05) for each comparison group. In other
words, these properties are able to distinguish between these groups. Furthermore,
we performed a Kruskal-Wallis test on all three radical groups and report the
H-scores and p-values in Appendix A Table A.2.
8. Discussion on Other Extremist Groups 148
8.5 Summary
This chapter presents a comparison between properties of propaganda material
published by different radical groups. Mainly, we studied properties of Inspire (Al-
Qaeda magazine) and American Renaissance (Alt-Right magazine) and compared
their linguistic and psycholinguistic properties against those of Dabiq. We found
a number of similarities in how these group construct their propaganda material.
Similarly, we identified a number of properties that can be used as distinguishing
features between these groups. We tested the properties against a control group
represented by randomly selected set of news articles, and highlighted the main
properties that were indeed significantly different from the control group. Finally,
these findings could suggest that there is a potential for a wider application of our
proposed approach to the detection of online radicalisation beyond the group of ISIS.
Conclusions
This thesis aimed to examine and address challenges faced by cybercrime investiga-
tors and to provide novel techniques for analysing and detecting such crimes. In
this final chapter, we conclude our research. First, we summarise our work and
demonstrate how it addresses our research questions. We then critically reflect on
the main research limitations, before we discuss future research directions. Finally,
we conclude with final remarks.
9.1 Summary
The threat posed by cybercriminals is constantly increasing as they target new attack
vectors and adopt different strategies. To develop an effective framework to respond
to cybercrimes, it is essential to approach it with a holistic view. In this thesis, we
addressed this by focusing on three main pillars: People, Process, and Technology.
People  We started this research by approaching the people who work on
investigating cybercrimes. This allowed us to better understand their environment,
background, and capabilities. Many practitioners who work on investigating
cybercrimes come with a strong background in investigative tactics and have long
expertise in investigating traditional crimes, but may be limited in their technical
background. In our study outlined in Chapter 4, we formulated a set of challenges
9. Conclusions 150
and recommendations that relate to building the capacity and technical skills
(especially at the local-force units) of people working in investigating cybercrimes.
Moreover, we identified a set of challenges related to the investigation process. For
instance, we found that different cybercrime investigation units operate their own
set of processes and workflows. Similarly, a proper process that facilitates the
sharing of information across different organizations (e.g., government-government,
government-private, and private-private) seemed lacking.
Process  After understanding the process being followed by professionals
during investigations, and the main needs and challenges they face, we outline in
Chapter 5 CCINT, a framework for cybercrime investigations. CCINT constitutes a
conceptual model inspired by how professionals described the investigation process
and an operational framework that facilitates different analytical capabilities. We
provided an example of how to apply the model to a real-world case study, such that
we aid investigators to organise the investigation process and inform what type of
resources, collaboration, and intelligence are needed when investigating an incident.
Technology  The complexity of cybercrimes is constantly increasing with
new methods, tools, and attack vectors being adopted. Similarly, such complexity
generates large amounts of data and digital footprints that require advanced tools
to handle. As a result, making use of new methods and technological advancements
is critical to be able to analyse the data and defend against such crimes. By
understanding users capabilities and needs, we build tools that can seamlessly fit
into their workflow and can assist them in conducting their investigations.
Through the three-pillar approach, we answered the first two research ques-
tions: RQ1. What are the main challenges currently being faced by cybercrime
investigators? In Chapter 4, we outlined a set of socio-technical challenges and
recommendations. The wide scope of these challenges and recommendations, which
can potentially fill many theses, made us decide to focus our research to address
the process and technology-related aspects of them. This led us to design the
CCINT framework, and answer the second research questions: RQ2. What are
9. Conclusions 151
the requirements for cybercrime intelligence systems that would be appropriate
and helpful for investigators?.
Furthermore, recognising the danger of the increasing spread of extreme online
speech extremist content, which has been described by the UK government
report on online harm [37] as still lacking a proper and effective response, we
decided to further focus the research into this topic of cybercrime. Tackling such
an issue requires coordination between government, academia, and private sectors
to formulate policies and supporting technologies that can help limit the spread
of extremist narrative online while preserving the societal rights of freedom of
speech. As such, we approach this by exploring the properties associated with
extremist discourse and focusing on analysing online propaganda published by
them. In Chapter 6, we answer the 3rd research question: RQ3. Can we identify
hidden properties and signals that describe extremist strategies in crafting their
online propaganda? This was achieved by utilising computational methods to
model the language used in these magazines and extract psycho-linguistic properties
that describe the overall personality, morality, and psychology patterns being
conveyed in these magazines.
After identifying these properties that stem from the extremist narrative, we test
the hypothesis that supporters of extremist groups who are influenced by the ideology
will share similar linguistic and psycho-linguistic properties. Therefore, we perform
an experiment on Twitter to detect supporters of ISIS, which allow us to answer the
4th research question: RQ4. Can we detect extremist narrative in social media and
therefore help mitigate its spread? We were able to achieve this with high accuracy
using random forest classifiers trained on different groups of features. We found
that using word embeddings, trained on extremist propaganda, to represent tweets
demonstrate significant improvement over the use of n-grams and TF-IDF weights.
Additionally, throughout the three experiments we performed with different datasets,
the psycho-linguistic features contributed the most to the successful detection of
pro-ISIS users on Twitter. Using a crafted measure that calculates the distance of
the users psych-profile from a pre-calculated profile of the extremist magazines.
9. Conclusions 152
Finally, due to the successful nature of the psych-profile in detecting supporters
of extremist groups, we wanted to investigate if different extremist groups who
originate from similar and different ideologies share some of these properties. Thus,
addressing our final question: RQ5. To what extent are extremist narrative properties
shared across multiple extremist groups? The results showed that groups that share
the same ideology have more properties in common, which is expected. However,
we also found that some properties were global across different extremist ideologies.
For instance, the us-vs-them dichotomy was affirmed in all extremist propaganda.
Similarly, they shared the emphasis on affiliation and achievement drives in their
propaganda. As for morality foundations, authority, care, and in-group loyalty were
the main moral foundations conveyed in all extremist propaganda.
In summary, the level of ease by which online extremist material is being widely
distributed and shared represents a considerable challenge to online platforms and
law enforcement. As extremists moved towards exploiting small online platforms,
which lack the resources and capabilities to monitor its data, to widely distribute
their propaganda they create difficulties for law enforcement in disrupting the
distribution. Therefore, we hope that our contribution can enable practitioners in the
field to properly disrupt such activities and minimise the spread of harmful content.
9.2 CCINT Framework for Online Radicalisation
The threat of cybercrime is expanding as criminals are migrating to the cyber world
to benefit from a low-risk high return environment. Similarly, the convergence
of cyber and terrorism introduces new threats with terrorist groups exploiting
emerging online platforms to spread their propaganda and radicalise individuals.
As these threats continue to evolve, it is important to provide appropriate support
for online platforms and law enforcement to effectively respond to these threats.
In this thesis, we achieve this by providing a common framework for practitioners
to follow to aid them in extracting effective intelligence and better understand,
analyse, and detect such crimes. Most previous frameworks in the literature focus
on describing cybercrimes from a single viewpoint, such as the victim, offender, or
9. Conclusions 153
the incident. The CCINT framework, on the other hand, aims to provide a holistic
view and understanding of the crime by describing it from different factors, and
provide practitioners with a combination of analytical techniques and supporting
tools that they need to analyse such crimes.
As we apply the framework to the problem of online radicalisation. We define
the three elements as follows:
Offenders are an organised extremist group who are ideologically motivated
to promote and spread their propaganda and influence people. Through their
propaganda, they aim to recruit supporters and sympathisers, celebrate their
victories, and project power and authority. For example, as the military fight
against ISIS was successful and resulted in them losing territory, however, this
defeat made the digital world an even more important platform for them to promote
their propaganda, inspire new attacks, and celebrate their ideology.
Incident  is the spreading of extremist material online to recruit and promote
extremist activities. Based on the matrix of cybercrimes presented in Table 2.1,
the incident is described as a cyber-dependent, crime in the machine, since it is
content-related, and the opportunity here is to spread violence and online grooming.
Thus, the scale and the impact of the incident is big since it spreads online, widely
targets victims, and can lead to offline real-world attacks.
Victims  The victims are individuals who might get influenced by such
propaganda and slowly groomed to join an extremist group. The type of harm
caused is psychological. Similarly, when the propaganda entices an attack or an act
of violence the general public would be considered as victims and additional types
of harm such as economic and loss of digital and physical assets may be incurred.
Since the M.O depends on the spread of propaganda material to recruit indi-
viduals and promote the extremist ideology, we utilised them as data sources to
study their properties. It is important to note that radicalisation is a process that
does not happen overnight. It occurs over time and is linked to multiple online and
offline factors. Exposure and interacting with extremist propaganda is one factor
that can lead to radicalisation. Through our analysis of extremist propaganda, we
9. Conclusions 154
were able to identify factors and signals that can explain their recruitment strategy
and why they have been successful in radicalising people. These factors were shared
among different radical groups regardless of their ideology.
Several theories in the radicalisation and social psychology literature discussed
how the radicalisation process occurs and how to influence group behaviour. Our
findings support these theories as it showed how a dichotomy mentality of us-vs-them
is apparent in the construction of the propaganda material through the analysis of
the use of pronouns. Additionally, the strong manifestation of power and authority
was also apparent in the construction of the radical propaganda material. Such
focus on strong associations with the in-group ideology and alienating out-groups,
radicals can establish strong identification with the group ideology and its superiority.
This is in line with the social identity theory that explains how social identity is
formulated through positive in-group emotion and affiliation, and hostility towards
out-group. Similarly, this dichotomy help groups to create a collective identity and
thus influence the behaviour of individuals to commit actions that are of benefit
to the group even if they are against the individuals interest. Furthermore, we
showed how emotions play a strong role in radical discourse. Utilising emotional
language, both positive and negative, allows them to strengthen the individuals
sense of affiliation and motivates the collective group action. For example, the
anger emotion which is one of the most prevalent emotions in radical propaganda
is known in the literature to be a group mobilising factor.
The successful utilisation of these properties in detecting supporters of extremists
in social media demonstrates the importance of understanding these factors in
detecting radicalisation. Especially when combined with linguistic cues, we can
capture extreme ideological discourse that calls for violence.
9.3 Research Limitations
There are a few limitations to our research which should be noted.
In our study that focuses on understanding the investigators needs and chal-
lenges, we opted to collect our data by conducting semi-structured interviews. While
9. Conclusions 155
this approach allowed us to gather detailed data from participants, which would not
be possible using survey methods, it limited us in the number of participants that
we were able to reach. Especially given that the targeted community is considered
difficult-to-reach for academics. Additionally, although each interview was guided
by the same set of predefined questions, there are unavoidable variations in the level
of details gathered from each participant depending on their time availability and
their role in investigating cybercrimes. Furthermore, to understand the problem
in-depth and capture the views of participants with their own words, we chose to
conduct face-to-face interviews which gave us an understanding of how participants
perceived their role and the challenges they face. However, relying on methods
such as participants observations as a tool for collecting data would give a better
understanding of the people, processes, and cultures of the organisations. Yet, there
are many difficulties inherent in observing this kind of activity directly. Therefore,
we rely on participants reports via interviews to collect our data. Similarly, the
sampling of participants was chosen from different agencies (government and private)
who deal with cybercrime investigations. From the government agencies, we were
able to gather the perspective of local cybercrime task forces and regional cybercrime
units. However, we could not get access to participants at a national cybercrime
agency level. In future work, it would be interesting to include the views and
perspectives of experts from national cybercrime agencies, as well as expanding
our sample size to allow even more insight into the problems faced.
With regard to researching the area of detection of online radicalisation, access
to quality data is a major challenge. The collection of a large dataset that is
representative of the community being studied and is not biased is difficult. Using
Twitter as a data source involves potential sampling biases enforced by Twitter
Sampling API that delivers a random 1% sample of all tweets. Another limitation
is related to obtaining ground-truth. Although the data used in this research has
been validated by different means, including crowd-sourcing manual validation. We
also validated the data by querying Twitters API to verify if all users that are
labelled as radical in our dataset, currently have suspended accounts. Similarly, we
9. Conclusions 156
query all non-radical users accounts to verify that they still have active accounts.
Since the data is more than 3-years old, our assumption relies on the ability of
Twitters anti-abuse team to correctly verify and suspend abusive accounts.
9.4 Future Research Directions
The work presented in this thesis offers several potential directions for future work.
We have explored the behaviour of pro-ISIS users on Twitter. One possible
extension of this work is to study their behaviour across different online platforms.
Since mainstream social media platforms have become more focused on minimising
the spread of extremist narrative in their platforms, supporters of extremist
groups have migrated to smaller or less open platforms, hiding behind encrypted
communication (e.g., telegram), gaming-platforms, and the dark-web. Moreover,
the work in this thesis explored the textual content of radical propaganda. Another
avenue of future work may focus on multi-media data sources. Large amounts
of propaganda being distributed online consist of imagery and video. Creating
tools capable of processing multi-media and detecting links to extremism is critical.
Furthermore, stemming from our final study on comparing properties of different
radical discourse, future work would investigate if we can generalise our approach
to detecting supporters of different extremist groups.
We outlined a set of open-research directions in Chapter 4 that relates to
formulating appropriate methods to facilitate information sharing across different
cybercrime agencies and private organisations. Additionally, the CCINT framework
proposed in this thesis consists of a wide set of methods and tools that are useful
for cybercrime investigators. In our application of the framework to the topic of
online radicalisation, we implemented a select number of the framework components.
Mainly, we focused on the data and analysis layers as we designed and built a
system that can utilise data sources from online social network platforms and online
magazines to detect weak signals (warning behaviour) for adopters of extremist
ideologies. We used behaviour analysis to identify patterns of behaviour for ISIS
supporters. As such, we leave the remaining components for future work. For
9. Conclusions 157
instance, exploration of visual analytics methods and how they can be used to
assist investigators in detecting and understanding radical behaviour is a natural
expansion to this research. Visual analytics is an important aspect that supports
analytical reasoning through visual and interactive user interfaces [226]. Having
an appropriately crafted visual representation of complex data plays an important
role in achieving effective understanding, reasoning and ultimately results in better
decision making. Additionally, work on improving the usability of tools targeted
to law-enforcement and ensuring seamless integration and compatibility between
existing tools they use and newly designed tools are topics to be investigated further.
9.5 Final Remarks
This work has explored the wide topic of cybercrime investigations before it zoomed-
in to the topic of online radicalisation. Through a detailed study including
practitioners from both government and private sectors, we identified existing
processes, needs, and challenges they face. Informed by our review of the literature
and the participants interviews, we designed CCINT, a cybercrime intelligence
framework to aid practitioners better analyse and investigate cybercrimes. We apply
framework methods to the problem of online radicalisation, where we investigate
properties related to extremist propaganda. Using systematic methodology we
design an approach to extract contextual and psycholinguistic properties from
extremist propaganda. Subsequently, we demonstrate how these properties can aid
in detecting supporters in online social network platforms. Extremists are getting
more and more creative in the ways they exploit online platforms. They started
by spreading their propaganda online to radicalise and celebrate their attacks, and
have now evolved to live-broadcasting attacks as we have seen in the Christchurch
mosque attack. We, as the research community, public, and private sectors, need to
form collaborations and be one step ahead of them by developing proper methods,
tools, and policies to limit the spread of such harmful extremist content online.
