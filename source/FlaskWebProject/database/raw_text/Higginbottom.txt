MODELLING ACCRETION DISK WINDS IN QUASARS
by Nicholas Higginbottom
Outflows are ubiquitous in active galactic nuclei (AGN). They can take the form of
either dramatic radio jets, which extend vast distances into the inter-galactic medium,
or of much smaller scale winds - whose existence can be inferred only indirectly via their
influence on the observed spectra.
There is good evidence to show that winds are likely to arise from the accretion disks
thought to form the central engine of all AGN; they should therefore be observable in
all such systems. The clearest observational signature comes in the form of the broad,
blue-shifted absorption features seen in the spectra of broad absorption line quasars
(BALQSOs) and the aim of this work is to investigate how the geometry and physical
parameters of disk winds affect their absorption spectra.
We first discuss the changes made to an existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code,
python, in order to extend its capabilities to include modelling of AGN. These changes
include the implementation of an approximate ionization scheme which takes account of
arbitrary illuminating spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and the inclusion of heating
and cooling effects likely to be important in the presence of high energy photons.
Next, we describe the second stage of the project which was to gain insight into the
general properties of a wind exhibiting broad absorption line (BAL) features. We did
this by performing radiative transfer and ionization calculations on a simple kinematic
wind representation using python. We show that BAL features can be produced for
plausible AGN parameters.
Finally, we present calculations carried out on a more complex wind geometry, generated
from a hydrodynamic simulation of a line driven disk wind. This calculation does not
produce BAL features at all, and in fact the wind is too highly ionised to permit efficient
line driving. This result is significant because it illustrates the importance of detailed
radiative transfer in hydrodynamic modelling, and suggests future work.

Introduction
1.1 Active Galactic Nuclei
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely luminous, spatially compact sources of con-
tinuum and line radiation found at the centres of galaxies. The first examples were
seen in the early 20th century as unusually bright cores in some spiral galaxies. These
sources were first classified by Seyfert (1943) and thus became known as Seyfert Galaxies.
Radio pioneers such as Karl Jansky and Grote Reber first noted the existence of extra-
terrestrial radio emission (Jansky 1933; Reber 1958); and radio surveys conducted in the
1950s and 60s (e.g. Shakeshaft et al. 1955; Edge et al. 1959; Bennett 1962) showed that
at least part of this emission came from discrete, unresolved sources. Following lunar
occultation work (Hazard et al. 1963), 3C 273 became the first of these radio sources
to be identified with a faint, bluish star-like object. It was around this time that these
objects were named quasi-stellar radio sources or quasars (Chiu 1964). Once spectral
lines were identified in 3C 273, its redshift could be measured (Schmidt 1963). Assuming
a cosmological origin for this redshift placed 3C 273 and other quasars at even larger
distances than the Seyferts, which in turn implied that they had unprecedented lumi-
nosities. Soon after, optical surveys found many more bluish star-like objects that also
had very large redshifts, but no radio emission (Sandage 1965). Originally these were
known as QSOs (quasi stellar objects), but now the terms QSO and quasar are used
more or less interchangeably. Here, both types are referred to as quasars.
2 Chapter 1 Introduction
In subsequent years, a whole zoo of extra-galactic objects were found, exhibiting a range
of subtly different observational features. Almost all share a non-stellar, high-luminosity
continuum source, and so they all came to be grouped under the AGN banner, even if
the surrounding galaxy could not be detected. In this chapter, we will first discuss how
AGN are classified by their observational features and then introduce models which seek
to unify the different types under a single geometry.
1.2 AGN Taxonomy
The next section briefly reviews the main observational features of the different classes
of AGN. Much of the information presented in this section has been taken from the
excellent review of AGN taxonomy in Peterson (1997).
1.2.1 Seyferts
The first distinction to be made in AGN is between Seyferts and quasars. This is made on
the basis of luminosity, with Seyferts being the lower luminosity counterpart to quasars.
A simple criterion of MB > 21.5 + 5 log h0 for Seyferts was originally suggested by
Schmidt and Green (1983), and most Seyferts have a luminosity of order 1011L, con-
centrated in the centre of (generally spiral) galaxies. All Seyferts exhibit narrow emission
lines (NELs) with widths of a few hundred km s1. These narrow lines are from ions in
a wide range of ionization states. Critically, forbidden lines are also seen which implies
that the electron density of whatever gas is producing the narrow lines must be below
about 106 cm3.
An estimate of the actual density of the narrow line gas can be made by measur-
ing the ratio of the strengths of forbidden line doublets like [O ii] 3729/3726 and
[S ii]  6716/6731. Such lines are sensitive to the electron density, since the upper lev-
els are populated primarily via collisional processes. At low densities, every collisional
excitation will be quickly followed by radiative de-excitation, and so the ratio of the two
lines in the doublet is just the ratio of the collisional excitation rates to the two upper
levels. This ratio is given by the statistical weights of the upper levels. At high densities,
Chapter 1 Introduction 3
collisional de-excitation will dominate over radiative de-excitation, and a Boltzmann dis-
tribution between the two levels will be set up. Therefore the populations of the upper
states will now be in the same ratio as the statistical weights. This gives a different
ratio to the relative intensities of the doublet. The change from the low density limit
to the high density limit takes place over about two orders of magnitude in density, and
therefore an estimate of the density can be made depending on the exact ratio. Using
this technique, the density of the narrow line region (NLR) has been shown to be in the
range 103  106 cm3.
A second set of emission lines is seen in some Seyferts, but not others. This forms the
basis of a subdivision into two classes. In type 2 Seyferts, the narrow lines are the
only emission lines present however in the type 1 Seyferts, a set of broad emission lines
(BELs) is also seen. Many of the same transitions are seen in both narrow and broad
lines, and, as the name suggests, the widths of the broad lines are greater than those of
the narrow lines, on the order of a few thousand km s1. There are no broad forbidden
lines, implying a higher density for the emitting gas. Broad semi-forbidden lines are
seen, however, which suggests that the electron density in the broad line region (BLR)
is of order 109 cm3.
Both types of Seyferts also show a stellar component to their spectra, along with a strong,
featureless continuum associated with the object at the very centre of the system. This
continuum is much fainter in type 2 Seyferts. Over time, it has become clear that Seyferts
do not always split perfectly into type 1 or type 2, and so a range of intermediate classes
exist based upon exactly which emission lines are seen in the spectrum.
1.2.2 Radio Galaxies
Radio galaxies are almost always elliptical galaxies and exhibit strong radio emission,
often in the form of one or two jets. The emission mechanism appears to be synchrotron
radiation, and so there must be strong magnetic fields present, along with a population
of hot electrons. Based on their optical spectrum and line emission, radio galaxies can
themselves be split into three classes. First, narrow line radio galaxies (NLRG) have
optical/ultraviolet (UV) spectra very similar to Seyfert 2 galaxies. Second, the much
4 Chapter 1 Introduction
rarer broad line radio galaxies (BLRG) are more analogous to Seyfert 1s. There is also a
third class, which exhibit almost no line emission; these are referred to as low excitation
radio galaxies (LERG). The NLRG and BLRG are both high excitation radio galaxies
(HERG).
Radio galaxies can also be classified by their morphology. Faranoff-Riley type I galaxies
(FRI) are brighter towards the centre of the galaxy, while Faranoff-Riley type II (FRII)
galaxies show powerful jets that persist out to large radii before they impact the IGM
and form radio hotspots (Fanaroff and Riley 1974). There is also a difference in the
shape of the radio spectrum of the two types. The core-dominated FRI sources have a
flat radio spectrum, while the jet-dominated FRII sources have a steep radio spectrum.
FRI galaxies tend to be LERGs, and so appear to be generally lower luminosity systems.
1.2.3 Quasars
As the more luminous counterparts of Seyfert galaxies, quasars share many of the same
observational features and are similarly categorised. Type 1 quasars have both BELs
and NELs, with only narrow forbidden lines and strong continuum emission from the
central source. If quasars are indeed the same type of object as Seyferts, one would
expect to see a class of quasars with only narrow lines - i.e. type 2 quasars. Some
NLRGs fit into this class, with their optical/UV emission showing evidence for heavy
dust obscuration. Searches for radio quiet sources with type 2 line spectra have taken
some time to yield results, but there are now a significant number of type 2 quasar
candidates (e.g Zakamska et al. 2003; Alexandroff et al. 2013). These sources also show
the signatures of dust obscuration, and the reduced luminosity is the reason they have
been harder to detect than their type 1 counterparts.
The strength of the radio emission from a quasar is also used as a classifier, with sources
described as simply radio loud or radio quiet. The most commonly used R definition
of radio-loudness defines a quasar as radio loud if the rest-frame ratio of the radio (5 GHz)
to optical (4400) flux density is greater than 10. Using this definition, about 15-20% of
quasars are radio loud (Kellermann et al. 1989). The radio emission of radio loud quasars
tends to exhibit a flat spectral index gradually steepening at shorter wavelengths.
Chapter 1 Introduction 5
1.2.4 Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQSOs)
A subset of quasars, the BALQSOs, are distinguished by having broad, deep absorption
features in their spectra. These broad absorption lines (BALs) appear in moderately
to highly ionized species, with considerable overlap with the species giving rise to the
broad emission features seen in type 1 quasars and Seyferts. The absorption features are
nearly always blue-shifted from the rest frequency of the emission line and often exhibit
a P Cygni type profile. An example is shown in Figure 1.1. This line profile, taken from
Junkkarinen et al. (1983), shows the C iv 1550 line in the prototypical BALQSO, PHL
5200. On the redshifted side of line centre, we see emission that is well modelled by a
logarithmic line profile; however, on the blue shifted side, emission abruptly switches to
absorption. The simplest model for this type of line shape is absorption in outflowing
material (see section 2.3.2), and the width of the absorption feature in many BALQSOs
suggests outflow velocities of up to 10% of the speed of light.
Figure 1.1: The Civ line profile from the prototypical BALQSO - PHL 5200
reproduced from Junkkarinen et al. (1983).
BALQSOs can be further subdivided into objects showing absorption only from highly
ionised species (HiBALs) and those showing absorption also from less ionised species
6 Chapter 1 Introduction
(LoBALs). Most BALQSOs are radio quiet, although more recent studies suggest that
about 20% of BALQSOs do produce radio emission (Shankar et al. 2008), albeit at a
much lower luminosity than one would expect from a radio-loud quasar.
BALQSOs are most commonly classified via the so called BALnicity index (BI) defined
by (Weymann et al. 1991)
BI = 
 3000
25000
[1 f(V )/0.9]CdV , (1.1)
where f(V ) is the normalised flux as a function of velocity with respect to the line
centre. Normalisation is carried out by calculating a continuum between the Si iv and
C iv emission features. C is set to 0 initially, but once the quantity in brackets has
been less than zero for 2000 km s1, it is set to 1. Whenever the quantity in brackets
is greater than zero, C is reset to 0. Thus, only absorption that is continuous for at
least 2000 km s1 counts towards the BI. This quantity is normally calculated for the
C iv absorption feature, and a quasar is defined as a BALQSO if the BI for C iv is
greater than zero.
Observationally, around 10-15% of quasars can be classified as BALQSOs (e.g Hazard
et al. 1984; Trump et al. 2006; Gibson et al. 2009), but after correction for selection
effects, this fraction increases to perhaps 20% (Knigge et al. 2008, but also see Allen
et al. 2011). BALs represent the most convincing evidence for large scale disk winds
in AGN, and explaining these spectral features is one of the main motivations for this
project.
1.2.5 Blazars
Blazars are a class of radio loud quasars that show continuum emission running from
the radio all the way to -rays (Sambruna et al. 1996). This is a wider range than
that observed in normal quasars, particularly at the high-energy end. They also show
rapid variability at the highest energies, which implies variability in the whole continuum
(Ulrich et al. 1997). Their optical emission exhibits a high degree of polarisation and is
also variable on timescales of less than a day (Mead et al. 1990). All blazars show strong
Chapter 1 Introduction 7
radio emission with a fairly flat spectrum similar to that seen from FR I radio galaxies.
BL Lac objects are a subclass of blazars that exhibit a featureless optical spectrum,
whilst flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) show strong, broad emission lines like type
1 quasars. Optically violent variable (OVV) quasars are another small subclass that
exhibit particularly extreme variations.
1.2.6 Other related exotica
There are a range of other extra-galactic objects that may or may not be AGN in the
conventional sense. For example, the ultra-luminous infra-red galaxies (ULIRGs) are a
population of luminous galaxies that seem to emit their energy primarily in the infra-
red. It is possible that these objects represent extreme type 2 Seyferts/quasars, with the
optical emission even more heavily obscured by dust than a normal type 2 object.
Another class of object which shares some properties with AGN are the low-ionization
nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). These objects show rather low nuclear lumi-
nosities, and so do not fully fit the criteria for a Seyfert. Whilst they do show narrow
emission lines (like Seyfert 2s), these lines are due to ions in relatively low ionization
states. LINERs are very common, existing in perhaps 50% of all spiral galaxies, and so
may represent the end state of quasar/Seyfert evolution.
Finally there is a class of radio quasars showing a steep spectral shape in the radio - like
the jet-dominated FR IIs. These are labelled the steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs).
Table 1.1 summarises the types of AGN in a simple scheme after Urry and Padovani
(1995).
1.3 Unification
Science seeks to find patterns in nature and, faced with such a dizzying array of different
AGN, astronomers were keen from the time of the first discoveries to find some underlying
model that could explain this observational diversity. The first hard evidence that all

AGN could be different aspects of the same phenomenon came when Rowan-Robinson
(1977) showed that quasars and Seyferts lie on the same luminosity function. Quasars
simply lie at the rarer, higher luminosity end of the distribution. He also suggested that
the difference in luminosity between Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s could be explained by dust
extinction. He took the strong IR emission in Seyferts as evidence of dust surrounding
the bright core, and suggested that Seyfert 2s simply have more dusty core than Seyfert
As we will see in the next chapter, the most likely physical mechanism to produce the
very large luminosities seen in AGN is a super-massive black hole (SMBH) fed by an
accretion disk. If this is true of all AGN, with the difference in luminosities simply being
the mass of the SMBH and/or the rate of accretion, then the first broad brush unification
has been made. If one then further postulates that radio activity is not a question of
geometry, but is rather an evolutionary phase that AGN go through, then the radio
properties can be set aside.
This leaves the line spectra. Whilst almost all AGN show NELs, only a subset show
BELs, and fewer still show BALs. It is suggested that the narrow lines are produced
in a structure called the narrow line region (NLR) (Oke and Sargent 1968; Weedman
1977), which is common to almost all classes of AGN. It appears to have a relatively
large spatial extent and has even been directly imaged in nearby Seyferts (e.g. Macchetto
et al. 1994).
Given the differences in the physical properties of the emitting gas, the broad lines are
thought to arise in a separate structure - the broad line region (BLR) (Oke and Sargent
Chapter 1 Introduction 9
1968; Weedman 1977). The absence of these features in type 2 AGN is put down to an
orientation effect with the BLR obscured from some sightlines (e.g. Lawrence and Elvis
1982; Antonucci 1993; Urry and Padovani 1995).
Figure 1.2 shows a schematic of this unification scheme based on Urry and Padovani
(1995). The left-hand panel shows the location of the proposed elements of the model
for a radio loud quasar, whilst the right panel shows how the object would be classified if
viewed from different sightlines. In the right-hand panel, radio quiet quasars have been
included by simply assuming the radio jet can be on or off.

The main elements of the model are the SMBH and associated accretion disk in the
centre, both surrounded by an equatorial ring of dense, cold material - the torus. The
exact nature of the torus is unknown, but its role in the unified theory is to obscure the
direct view of the accretion disk from high inclination sightlines. This angle dependant
obscuration provides the separation between type 1 and type 2 AGN, with the former
corresponding to systems viewed at low inclination angles, so seeing the accretion disk
directly. If the torus is geometrically thick enough, it can also obscure the view of the
BLR, which is found within a parsec of the central region (Lawrence and Elvis 1982).
If one were to look at the object from a polar direction, the jet would be pointed straight
towards the observer, and relativistic beaming would thus make the source appear to
10 Chapter 1 Introduction
be more luminous. Also, any fluctuations in the emission from the jet would appear to
happen almost simultaneously, even if the mechanism causing the fluctuation could only
propagate along the jet at the speed of light. These characteristics are typical for the
blazar class of quasars.
The BLR itself is pictured in Figure 1.2 as a system of clouds. However, this is just one
potential model, and the true nature of the BLR is one of the most important outstanding
pieces in unified models of AGN. Models can be broadly grouped into cloud models and
disk wind models although there is significant overlap between the two. However, before
discussing these models, it is worth summarising the physical properties of the BLR that
can be inferred directly from observations.
1.3.1 The physical properties of the broad line region
1.3.1.1 Density and temperature
As described earlier, the absence of forbidden BELs, coupled with the existence of semi-
forbidden BELs suggests a characteristic hydrogen number density of order 109 cm3 for
the line-forming region. The fraction of the sky which is covered by the BLR as seen
from the central source (the covering factor) can also be estimated. Very few quasars
show Ly absorption, which implies a covering factor of no more than 10% (assuming
the BLR gas is optically thick in Ly) (MacAlpine 2003). Estimating a characteristic
temperature is more difficult, but the existence of Fe ii lines in most AGN spectra implies
a temperature of < 35000 K for at least some parts of this region. Higher temperatures
would collisionally ionize this ion (Osterbrock and Ferland 2006).
1.3.1.2 Ionization mechanism
There is strong observational evidence that the BLR is photoionized. Recombination
lines respond very quickly to changes in the continuum flux, which implies that the ion-
ization state of the BLR is set by photoionization (Osterbrock and Ferland 2006). In
addition, the equivalent widths of recombination lines in objects with a wide range of dif-
ferent luminosities are proportional to the luminosity, which implies a direct relationship
Chapter 1 Introduction 11
between the luminosity of the source and the ionisation state of the BLR. More evidence
that the BLR is photoionized comes from the existence of fairly highly ionized species,
such as O vi. If the temperature derived from the Fe ii lines is representative, then
only photoionization can explain the existence of such highly ionized ions. Of course,
the existence of both low ionization and high ionization species in the same structure
immediately implies some kind of ionization stratification.
1.3.1.3 Size
The size of the BLR can be determined by measuring the time-lag between changes in the
continuum and changes in the emission lines (reverberation mapping). This technique
works because photoionization drives the ionization state of the wind. The typical size
scale of the BLR turns out to be of the order from a few light days up to a few hundred
light days, depending on the mass of the SMBH (e.g. Peterson et al. 2004; Kaspi et al.
2007). Reverberation mapping can also provide some insight into the ionization structure
of the BLR: low ionization lines exhibit longer lags, thus appear to originate further away
from the central source than lines from more highly ionized species.
1.3.1.4 Kinematics
The width of the broad emission lines cannot be thermal if the temperature of the
gas is only around 104 K, so bulk motion of the gas must be responsible. The velocities
implied by the width of the lines, coupled with the distances from reverberation mapping,
suggests that the gas is moving under the gravitational influence of the SMBH. However,
whether this is an orbit or an inflow / outflow is not immediately apparent from the line
profiles.
BALs, first seen in quasars in the late 60s, were immediately associated with outflowing
material around the SMBH - perhaps in the form of expanding shells of material, ejected
in repeated outburst events (Burbidge et al. 1966; Lynds 1967). The width of the ab-
sorption features is of the same order as that of the emission lines (Lee and Turnshek
1995) and very similar ionic species are seen, which suggests a simple model in which
12 Chapter 1 Introduction
BALs and BELs arise in a single structure. There are of course alternative explanations,
the strongest alternative being that the structure producing BALs is simply present in
some quasars but not others, possibly indicating an evolutionary sequence (e.g. Surdej
and Hutsemekers 1987; Fabian 1999; Becker et al. 2000).
1.3.1.5 Geometry
As mentioned in Section 1.2.4, the P Cygni profile of the BALs implies that they are
produced in an expanding medium. The absorption features are very deep, but not
completely black. This could mean either that part of the background source is visible
around the side of the absorbing medium; that the optical depth is not high enough for
complete extinction; or that scattering is filling in the trough. Polarisation studies have
shown significant polarisation in the bottom of the absorption troughs, suggesting that
scattering is responsible (e.g. Cohen et al. 1995). Furthermore, it has been shown that
whatever material is responsible for the BALs has a covering factor less than 100% (Arav
et al. 1999a), although from the point of view of the observer, the continuum source is
completely covered. This implies a preferential viewing direction for BALQSOs, where
the sightline to the continuum source intercepts the absorbing gas.
So, to summarise, the BLR appears to be a photoionized region with temperatures of
order a few tens of thousands of K. It is relatively compact, and consists of material
moving at virial speeds, suggesting that it is in the gravitational influence of the SMBH. It
seems that the material producing emission lines is always present. However, whether it is
the same material which produces BALs in some objects, or whether another component
is required, is not known. In the next sections, we will introduce the two main classes of
physical model for the BLR that have been suggested to date: photoionization models,
and disk wind models.
1.3.2 Cloud or photoionization models
Form follows function is perhaps the best way to describe the development of the cloud
models of the BLR. Since the BLR appears to be photoionized, it made sense from the
Chapter 1 Introduction 13
earliest investigations to try to tie down its structure by carrying out photoionization
calculations. If one assumes that all of the BLR sees the same continuum spectral energy
distribution (SED) as we observe from the Earth, the ionization state of a parcel of gas in
the BLR depends on the luminosity of the continuum source, the distance of the parcel
from the source, and the density of the parcel. These factors are usually combined into
an ionization parameter - one common definition is given by
  Lx
n(H)R2x
, (1.2)
where Lx is the X-ray luminosity of the source, n(H) is the number density of hydrogen
atoms, and Rx is the distance of the cloud under investigation from the source. An
alternative, again commonly used, definition is given by
U  Q(H)
4r20n(H)c
 (H)
n(H)c
, (1.3)
where Q(H) is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons emitted by the central source
per second, r0 is the distance from the source to the illuminated face of the cloud and
(H) is the surface flux of ionizing photons. Since U depends on the number of photons,
whilst  depends on the integrated source luminosity, the relationship between the two
depends on the sources SED. In this thesis, we usually use U , however both are common
in the literature.
Photoionization codes such as cloudy (Ferland et al. 2013) are used to predict line
strengths using the ionization parameter as an input, and so the physical conditions in
the BLR can be inferred by comparing predictions with observations. Usually, a single set
of parameters cannot perfectly match observations, and so a complete model generally
involves a large number of clouds, usually with the same density, but distributed in
distance from the central source. A lower limit on the number of clouds can be inferred
from the smoothness of the observed line profiles (e.g. Atwood et al. 1982; Arav et al.
1997; Dietrich et al. 1999) if the internal velocity distribution for each cloud is assumed
to be thermal. The upper limit on the number of clouds is much harder to obtain, since
it is degenerate in quantities like the size of the clouds and the covering factor. As the
14 Chapter 1 Introduction
number of clouds increases, the clouds would merge into a continuous flow (Dietrich et al.
1999).
Given the line intensity, one can estimate the number of ions in a cloud, and hence the
size of the clouds (given the density), the optical depth through a cloud, and the volume
filling factor of the BLR (the proportion of the volume of the BLR which is taken up by
the clouds). This type of model has come to be known as the cloud or photoionization
model of the BLR.
A further development of this model came from the observation that very different objects
seemed to have very similar broad emission lines. This implies a preferential location
for the BLR. However, it turns out that if there is a system of clouds, with a range
of densities, distributed in space around the continuum source then those clouds which
are in the correct ionization state for a given ion to exist would dominate the emission
spectrum. This is the locally optimised cloud (LOC) model (Baldwin et al. 1995).
In such cloud models, the distribution of clouds within the volume of the BLR can
be used to explain other observations. For example, as already mentioned, the lack of
Ly absorption in quasars implies a covering factor for the BLR of about 10%. However,
given the energy radiated in the lines, the BLR would need to intercept more than 10% of
the energy emitted by the central source (Maiolino et al. 2001; Gaskell et al. 2007). This
apparent contradiction can be explained if the BLR clouds form a flattened geometry,
so in most cases we see the central source through a hole in the BLR whilst in other
directions, the BLR has an almost 100% covering fraction.
Despite the flexibility of the cloud model, there are obvious questions regarding its phys-
ical viability. For example the clouds need to be confined in some way to prevent them
from simply evaporating. This confinement could be provided by some kind of intra-cloud
medium1 (Krolik et al. 1981) although magnetic confinement has also been suggested
(Rees 1987).
1A confining medium needs to move with the BLR to avoid the clouds being destroyed due to Rayleigh-
Taylor instabilities (Mathews and Ferland 1987). The temperature and composition of this medium are
uncertain since it must be dense enough to confine the clouds, yet it is not directly observed.
Chapter 1 Introduction 15
In addition, it is not clear how to explain the BALs in this geometry although one possi-
bility that has been extensively investigated is that the flattened distribution mentioned
above would have some sightlines passing through a cloud, and it is possible that one
would then see absorption. This geometry ties in with the observational constraint that
the material producing the BALs must only partially cover the central source in order
to give the observed ratio of emission to absorption (Junkkarinen et al. 1983). Another
option is to turn to an evolutionary argument; for example that BALQSOs represent an
early phase of quasar development (e.g Gregg et al. 2006).
1.3.3 Disk wind models
One observational characteristic of the BLR that cannot be directly explained by the
simple cloud model is the origin of the width of the BELs.
Bulk motion of the line emitting material (whether clouds or something else) is clearly
required, but the model does not tell us whether this is orbital, infall or outflow. It
has been suggested for a long time that some kind of acceleration mechanism could be
driving the clouds outwards2 (e.g Blumenthal and Mathews 1975; Shields 1977), but this
still leaves the question of how the clouds could survive a fairly long acceleration phase
without breaking up. This was addressed by models in which the clouds are formed
as condensations in an outflowing wind driven from the surface of the accretion disk
(Beltrametti 1981; Weymann et al. 1982). The clouds are confined by the surrounding
lower density wind, eventually evaporating as they move outwards, to be replaced by
fresh condensations closer in.
As mentioned earlier, the simplest explanation for the line shape of BALs (as opposed
to BELs) is that they are formed in outflowing gas. Fairly early on, it was suggested
that the AGN itself could provide the driving force for such an outflow (e.g Rees 1970),
although the mechanism was not (and is still not) a settled question. Non-spherically
symmetric outflows seemed to be required from photon conservation arguments, and such
2Radiation pressure from the inner accretion disk was most often invoked as the force providing this
acceleration in this early work.
16 Chapter 1 Introduction
a geometry also provides a natural explanation for the BALQSO fraction (Junkkarinen
1983)3.
Around the same time, it was shown that accretion disks in AGN could produce strong
winds, driven either radiatively by scattering of UV photons (Shlosman et al. 1985), or
centrifugally by magnetic fields (Blandford and Payne 1982). These disk winds suggest
a natural unifying structure, and theoretical studies (e.g Murray et al. 1995) showed that
such winds could indeed produce both BELs and BALs if the conditions were correct.
One of the most influential disk wind unification models was described by Elvis (2000).
His proposed geometry for the inner parts of a QSO is shown in Figure 1.3.
Figure 1.3: A disk-wind based QSO geometry (Elvis 2000).
In this particular model, the wind consists of two phases: a warm, highly ionized medium
(WHIM) in pressure balance with denser, cooler clouds, which give rise to the BELs.
An observer looking from a polar direction would see both the unobscured continuum
source and line radiation from the BEL clouds. From a sightline which intersects the
opening angle of the wind, one would see absorption from the same clouds, and the object
3Spherically symmetric models can also work in some cases (Drew and Boksenberg 1984).
Chapter 1 Introduction 17
would appear as a BALQSO. Narrower absorption features, identified with the narrow
absorption lines (NALs) seen in some quasars, would be seen from equatorial directions,
since the velocity gradient of gas along the sightline to the source of UV photons is small.
This model is essentially free of assumptions about the mechanism which accelerates the
wind4, but many other models exist in which the structure of the wind is calculated
through direct modelling of a given driving mechanism. These models are discussed in
Chapter 3, where the main driving mechanisms are also described.
1.4 This thesis
The aim of this thesis is to test how well the disk wind model can explain the observational
features of BALQSOs. Chapter 2 continues the introductory portion of the thesis, with
a brief summary of the physics of the accretion disk. This is key to the understanding of
disk winds, which are described in more detail in Chapter 3. We investigated how dif-
ferent wind geometries affected the absorption spectrum through numerical simulations
carried out using the radiative transfer and ionization code python, first described in
Long and Knigge (2002). The code as it stood at the start of this work is introduced in
Chapter 4.
python was originally written with the simulation of cataclysmic variable (CV) systems
in mind, and significant development effort was needed to allow it to properly model
winds around AGN. The new physics included in the code, and a few of the validation
exercises carried out, are discussed in Chapter 5.
With the upgraded version of python in place, the next step in the project was to take a
smooth, kinematic representation of a disk wind and investigate whether it could produce
BAL features. Chapter 6 describes a benchmark model that manages to produce BALs
for a physically reasonable set of AGN disk wind parameters. We then present the
simulated spectra obtained from this geometry, and discuss what can be learnt from the
successes and failures of benchmark model.
4although radiation pressure is invoked to bend the wind outwards, forming the funnel like shape
18 Chapter 1 Introduction
In Chapter 7, a radiative transfer and ionization calculation for a more complex line
driven disk wind model is presented. First described by Proga and Kallman (2004), this
hydrodynamic wind model represents a realistic geometry, which we hoped could gen-
erate more complex spectral features than the benchmark model. In fact we find that the
original, necessarily simplified, radiative transfer treatment led to an underestimation of
the ionization state of the wind. Since the driving mechanism for the outflow is critically
dependant on the ionization state, this means that the calculated outflow geometry itself
may not be completely self consistent. This is an important result given the influential
nature of the model.
Finally, conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in Chapter 8.
Chapter 2
Accretion
2.1 Accretion power
Once the true luminosity of AGN had been established, the question of what mechanism
could produce such huge energy outputs quickly followed. For example, the prototypical
quasar 3C 273 has a bolometric luminosity of around 6 1046 ergs s1 (Trler et al.
1999). This is around 1.6 1013 L, or more than a hundred times the total luminosity
of all the stars in the Milky Way. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted
from matter is given by E = mc2. We can thus define the efficiency, , of an energy
conversion process as the fraction of this theoretical maximum conversion rate that it
can sustain. If we define M as the rate at which matter is supplied, then the luminosity
of a source powered by a process with efficiency  is
L = Mc2. (2.1)
Fusion, the power source of stars, is one of the most efficient processes for converting
mass into energy, with a typical efficiency (for H He) of 0.7% (Frank et al. 2002). If
fusion were the power source of 3C 273, this would require the conversion of H to He at
a rate of M  150 M yr1. At first sight, this may not seem unreasonable. However,
when one includes information about the size of the continuum source in quasars, things
become more challenging.
20 Chapter 2 Accretion
The bright continuum source at the heart of AGN has never been resolved even in
nearby Seyferts. Furthermore, many AGN (including 3C 273) are observed to be variable
on timescales of days, some even shorter. These observational clues suggest that the
continuum source is at most a few light days in size. It is hard to conceive of a stable
configuration of a sufficient number of stars to produce 100 times the luminosity of a
typical galaxy in a volume about the size of the solar system. There is, however, a more
efficient way of extracting energy from matter - the conversion of gravitational potential
energy (GPE) into radiation as that matter is accreted onto a gravitating body.
The energy, E, liberated via accretion of a parcel of material of mass M falling from
infinity onto the surface of a body of mass M and radius R is given by
. (2.2)
Taking the time derivative of both sides of Equation 2.2 allows us to write an expression
for the luminosity, L, of an accretion pwered source
, (2.3)
where M is the accretion rate. The factor of 2 is due to the Virial therom, which states
that a maximum of 50% of the initial GPE is available for conviserion into readiation.
The efficiency of the accretion process is therefore
(2.4)
(2.5)
. (2.6)
Thus the accretion efficiency is proportional to the compactness, (M/R), of the accreting
object. This parameter is maximised for a black hole1, and whilst there is no hard
surface, we can usefully define its characteristic size as the radius of the innermost
1Actually, neutron stars can be somewhat more efficient, since more energy can be released as the
accreting material impacts the surface of the neutron star.
Chapter 2 Accretion 21
stable circular orbit, RISCO. Inside this radius, material plunges directly over the event
horizon, carrying any remaining energy with it.
For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, RISCO = 6GM/c2, which gives a maxi-
mum efficiency of about 8% (more detailed calculations yield the more commonly used
value of 6%). The ISCO reaches a minimum value of RISCO = GM/c2 for prograde
orbits around a maximally spinning (Kerr) black hole. In this case, a relativistic treat-
ment is necessary and yields a maximum efficiency of about 32% (Dutan and Biermann
2005). This is more than an order of magnitude more efficient than fusion and reduces
the required accretion rate for 3C 273 to around 10 M yr1. In addition, as we will see
in section 2.2.2 below, the size of the region that would be expected to emit the bulk of
the luminosity is very small, consistent with observations.
At first sight, it may appear that there is no limit to the luminosity of an accretion-
powered source. Furthermore, since the efficiency appears to be independent of the mass
of the accreting object, it seems that there is no requirement to have a particularly
massive black hole to power even a quasar (although clearly any object which accretes
10 M yr
1 over significant timescales will become very massive). There is, however,
another consideration. In order to accrete material onto a luminous object, the inward
force of gravity must overcome the outward radiation pressure on the in-falling material.
Let us assume that this material is ionized hydrogen, but that the free protons and elec-
trons still strongly interact via the Coulomb force. The gravitational force is dominated
by the force on the protons, and the inward force on a single proton is given by
Fgrav =
. (2.7)
Assuming the central object radiates isotropically with luminosity L, the radiation flux
S at a distance r from the source is
. (2.8)
In a fully ionised plasma, the radiation will interact with electrons via Thomson scat-
tering. Since the Thomson cross section (T ) is over a million times larger than the
22 Chapter 2 Accretion
comparable proton cross section, we can neglect the force exerted by the radiation on
the protons. The force acting on a single electron is given by the rate of change of mo-
mentum of the photons interacting with it, which is just the energy transferred from the
photons to the electron, divided by the speed of light, c. The energy transferred is equal
to the flux multiplied by the cross section and so the outward force acting on a single
electron is given by
Frad =
4r2c
. (2.9)
In a neutral plasma, the number of protons and electrons is the same. The so-called
Eddington luminosity, Ledd, is thus defined as the luminosity at which those inward
and outward forces balance, so that accretion would be halted. Equating 2.7 and 2.9 and
rearranging, we obtain
Ledd =
4GMmpc
' 1.3 1038 M
ergs s1. (2.10)
Thus the maximum luminosity of any object is a function of its mass, and so in order
to achieve the observed luminosity of 3C 273, we require a central mass of at least
4 108 M. This relation is often used to place lower limits on the mass of the SMBH
in AGN. Equation 2.10 can be rewritten in terms of the mass accretion rate, assuming
L = mc2 to give an Eddington accretion rate
Medd =
4GMmp
' 3.7 108 M

1, (2.11)
for  = 0.06. Thus a 108M SMBH has an Ledd ' 1.3  1046 ergs s1 and Medd '
3.7M yr
In the above derivation, the Eddington luminosity relates to a spherically accreting and
isotropically radiating body. One can therefore envision geometries where super Ed-
dington accretion can take place. This could happen, for example, if the material is
accreted only from certain directions, whilst the radiation is still released isotropically
or vice versa. Thus the accretion flow would not see all of the radiation. The Eddington
luminosity is, however, still used extensively when discussing the luminosity of sources.
This is partly because it is a convenient benchmark, and partly because it is unlikely
Chapter 2 Accretion 23
that any source can exceed it by more than about an order of magnitude whatever its
geometry.
Another interesting aspect of this treatment is to consider what happens if the in-falling
material is not fully ionized. In this case, there may be many spectral lines present, due
to bound-bound transitions which collectively have a cross section far larger than T .
Thus sub-Eddington sources can still expel strong outflows by radiation pressure alone.
This is an important mechanism for the driving of disk winds, and is discussed in more
detail in section 3.1.2.
2.2 Accretion disks
The preceding section demonstrated that the most likely power source for an AGN is
accretion, the release of GPE from material falling towards a massive central object.
However, this is not the complete answer, since the GPE will initially be converted into
kinetic energy (KE) and material falling into a black hole will simply carry all of its KE
with it over the event horizon. There must therefore be some mechanism by which the
energy is converted into radiation. It turns out that the kinematics of collapse almost
inevitably produces a structure which provides this mechanism.
2.2.1 Formation of accretion disks
Whenever material collapses under gravity, the result is likely to be a disk-like structure.
This is a natural consequence of the fact that, in general, any collection of particles
will always have some net angular momentum. If we take an initially spherical cloud of
particles, they will begin to move along radial paths towards the centre of mass. However,
since angular momentum must be conserved, as the particles get closer to the centre,
their rotational velocity will increase. Particles will eventually reach the point when the
radial gravitational attraction is balanced by the centrifugal force due to their rotational
velocity, and so their paths will become vertical rather than radial. They will thus fall
towards the plane defined by the angular momentum vector. This is illustrated in figure
24 Chapter 2 Accretion
Figure 2.1: Collapse onto an accretion disk.
As particles pass through this plane, the net force will switch direction, and so they will
start to oscillate about the plane, dissipating energy via interactions with other particles
until the vertical component of motion is damped out, and a disk is formed. This process
of energy dissipation will continue in the disk, and the orbits of particles in the disk will
gradually circularise. This is because for any given value of angular momentum, a circular
orbit represents the lowest energy state. We will therefore end up with a rotationally
supported system of particles in a plane - the accretion disk.
There are now two important pieces of physics that must be understood. Firstly, if we
are to tap the kinetic energy of the orbiting material, there must be some mechanism by
which that energy is radiated away as the material moves deeper into the gravitational
well. Secondly, angular momentum must be lost by material in order for it to move
inwards through the structure of the disk in order to convert further GPE into KE and
hence into radiation.
2.2.2 -disks
An accretion disk is a differentially rotating system. That is, if one takes material at a
given radius, neighbouring material slightly closer to the central object will orbit more
quickly, while material further away will orbit more slowly. The interaction of systems
of particles moving at different velocities is dealt with by the theory of viscosity, where
the dynamic or shear viscosity expresses the resistance of a material to shearing forces.
Chapter 2 Accretion 25
The viscous force per unit area () of two slabs of material separated by a distance ds,
moving with a relative shearing velocity gradient dv/ds is given by
 = 
, (2.12)
where  is defined as the kinematic viscosity of the material (measured in stokes, or
cm2 s1), and  is the density.
In an accretion disk, this shearing force will act to transport angular momentum out-
wards, allowing material to slow down and move inwards. Of course this will mean that
some material ends up with increased angular momentum which will have to leave the
system via some other mechanism, perhaps magnetically confined outflows (Blandford
and Payne 1982). In binary systems, tides can also transfer angular momentum back
to the orbit. If the angular momentum cannot be shed, then the disk will continuously
increase in size.
The exact source of the viscosity in an accretion disk is not fully understood, although
it is clear that magnetic fields are probably important (Balbus and Hawley 1991). It
turns out that one can produce a reasonable model of an accretion disk by assuming the
presence of some kind of viscosity and parameterising it. The most successful model of
accretion disks is the so called -disk model, first described by Shakura and Sunyaev
(1973). Here,  is a scaling parameter used to describe the strength of viscosity  in
terms of other disk parameters. In this model, hydrodynamic turbulence is assumed to
be the source of the viscosity, i.e. the chaotic motion of small parcels of gas is assumed
to transport angular momentum between neighbouring rings of the disk. In this case,
dimensional analysis suggests that the kinematic viscosity can be written as
  v, (2.13)
where  is the spatial scale of turbulent motion in the gas, and v the typical velocity of the
turbulent eddies. It is reasonable to assume that the size of the largest turbulent eddies
in the disk are of order the local scale height of the disk, H. Furthermore, the velocity
of the eddies cannot be faster than the local sound speed, cs. If it were, shocks would
26 Chapter 2 Accretion
form, and the eddies would dissipate via shock heating and radiation. The kinematic
viscosity can therefore be written as
 = csH, (2.14)
where  is a dimensionless parameter that combines the uncertainty in the actual scale
size of eddies in the disk and in the velocity at which they travel. Based on the arguments
above, it is expected that < 1. If one further assumes that the only source of heating
for the disk is viscous dissipation, and that any radiation generated leaves the disk locally
(rather than heating neighbouring parts of the disk), then the temperature of the disk
can be calculated as a function of radius, yielding (Wade 1984)
T (r) =

)1/2}]1/4
. (2.15)
Here, Rin is the innermost edge of the accretion disk where viscous forces are assumed to
drop to zero. The shape of this relationship is shown in Figure 2.2 for four very different
systems, all of which are likely to contain accretion disks. These systems are intended
to be generic illustrations rather than to simulate any given astronomical object. For
ease of comparison, the same Eddington ratio, M/Medd = 0.25, has been adopted for
all four systems. They are
 A quasar: M = 109 M and M = 10 M yr1
 A Seyfert galaxy: M = 107 M and M = 0.1 M yr1
 An X-ray binary (XRB): M = 10 M and M = 107 M yr1
 A cataclysmic variable (CV): M = 1 M and M = 108 M yr1
For the quasar, Seyfert and XRB, the innermost disk radius, Rin is set to 6 gravitational
radii, RG, where RG = GM/c2. The outermost disk radius in these systems is set to
Rout = 10
4Rin. For the CV, Rin = 109 cm and Rout = 100Rin.
Several interesting features are visible in Figure 2.2. Firstly we see that at large radii,
the temperature scales as T  r3/4. Secondly, and much more importantly, we see that

the peak temperature of the disk around a black hole goes down with increasing black
hole mass. In fact, for an accretion rate set to a fixed fraction of the black hole mass,
Tmax M1/4. Thus, whilst an accretion disk surrounding a 10 M black hole would
be a strong source of X-rays, this is not the case for a 109 M black hole in a quasar.
Note, however, that there can be other sources of X-ray radiation in a quasar.
Finally, looking at the temperature distribution in the accretion disk of a CV, we see
that the hard surface of the white dwarf at the centre of the disk means that, despite
the scaling law above, the peak temperature in a CV disk is about the same as that in a
quasar disk. This somewhat counter-intuitive result provided part of the motivation for
this project, because some of the observational features of CVs have been successfully
explained in terms of disk winds (e.g. Drew and Verbunt 1985; Long and Knigge 2002;
Noebauer et al. 2010) and, given the apparent similarity between the disks, it is reason-
able to think that these models and techniques might also help to explain the similar
features seen in some AGN.
If one makes the assumption that an accretion disk will radiate like an ensemble of
28 Chapter 2 Accretion
blackbodies, with each annulus radiating at the local temperature given by equation
2.15, then one can produce a simulated spectrum by simply integrating over all radii.
Figure 2.3 shows this for the four systems previously described.

Figure 2.3: Accretion disk spectra for four different accretion disks.
We immediately see that the spectra all take the form of stretched blackbodies. At the
high frequency end, the spectrum drops off exponentially - this is the Wien tail of the
hottest part of the disk. At low frequencies, L  2 - this is the sum of the Rayleigh-
Jeans tails of all of the black bodies. In between these two limits is the characteristic
disk spectrum, L  1/3. Figure 2.3 clearly shows the X-ray emission expected from
the XRB, and also the subtle difference between the two types of AGN. The location of
the high and low frequency break points in the disk spectrum depends on the values of
Rin and Rout respectively, and the range of frequencies over which the characteristic disk
spectrum applies depends on the ratio Rout/Rin. For the quasar, Seyfert and XRB, we
set Rout/Rin = 104, so the characteristic disk spectrum applies over about three orders
of magnitude (since T  r3/4). In contrast, because the CV disk exists over a much
smaller range of radii, it hardly shows the characteristic spectrum at all.
Chapter 2 Accretion 29
Finally, we can calculate the luminosity of the accretion disk as a function of radius.
Figure 2.4 shows the cumulative luminosity as a function of radius for the quasar disk
described above. The luminosity is scaled to the total, and the figure shows clearly that
90% of the luminosity is radiated within 150 RG of the centre. This is approximately
2 1016 cm or about 8 light days. This is the right size to explain the timescale of
variability of quasars, as described earlier. The second line shows the cumulative ionizing
luminosity (the integrated flux emitted at frequencies such that h > 13.6eV) for the
same disk, also normalised to the total luminosity. We see that the radial distribution of
ionizing flux is even more concentrated towards the centre, with essentially all ionizing
flux emitted inside about 50RG.

This treatment of the accretion disk only holds if the disk is radiatively efficient. This
means that the disk is in local thermal equilibrium, with energy dissipated locally. This is
expected to be true if the accretion rate is between about 1% and 100% of the Eddington
rate. There are therefore two cases that require further consideration. Firstly, if the
accretion rate is very low, the density of the disk will be low, and the disk will be
optically thin. It will therefore not radiate efficiently, and the thermal energy of the gas
30 Chapter 2 Accretion
will be transported inwards with the gas (advection). In the case of a black hole, this
energy will be lost when the material passes over the event horizon. This is is known as
an advection dominated accretion flow - ADAF (Ichimaru 1977; Narayan and Yi 1994).
If the accretion rate is above the Eddington rate, the solution is not as well known. For
moderately super Eddington accretion rates, modifications to the -disk model yield a
similar slim disk solution (Abramowicz et al. 1988). However, for even higher accretion
rates, the disk becomes unable to radiate away all of the locally generated heat, and it
will begin to puff up to form a thick disk, known as a Polish doughnut. This structure
can sustain luminosities up to 100 times the Eddington limit (Abramowicz et al. 1980).
Both types of super-Eddington disk are radiatively inefficient, with significant energy
being advected into the black hole.
2.2.3 Departures from a pure accretion disk spectrum
In many accreting objects, radiation is observed at energies far in excess of those that
would be expected from a system of blackbodies, extending to X-rays and even -rays.
This radiation is best modelled by a power-law SED, although the process by which
these photons are produced is not fully understood. A popular model suggests that
the X-ray emission comes from some kind of disk corona, i.e. a hot atmosphere which
increases the energy of photons originating from the disk below via a process of Compton
up-scattering.
Many AGN also exhibit a fairly featureless, soft X-ray continuum, which is well described
by a blackbody with radiation temperature 0.1-0.2 keV (Gierliski and Done 2006). This
temperature is higher than one would expect from the accretion disk in such systems.
This so-called soft excess lies above the extrapolation of the power-law X-ray source
seen in harder X-rays, and its origin is also a topic of active research. The similarity of
the radiation temperature of the soft excess radiation across a range of objects of different
masses suggests that it is not Comptonised emission from the accretion disk (Gierliski
and Done 2004). Alternative explanations include radiation from an optically thin inner
part of the accretion disk (Done et al. 2012), and reflection of X-ray photons from the
photoionized surface of the accretion disk (Ross and Fabian 2005; Crummy et al. 2006).

2.3 Outflows
Perhaps surprisingly, wherever one sees or infers an accretion disk, one also sees strong
evidence of outflowing material. This can take the form of the dramatic radio jets
seen in radio galaxies, AGN, CVs and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXB) or the disk
winds thought to exist in the same range of objects. The luminosity associated with
these outflows is significant, and no discussion of accretion would be complete without
mentioning some of their key features.
2.3.1 Jets
Radio jets have been seen in a wide range of astrophysical settings and seem to be
intimately linked to accretion. This relationship has been seen most clearly in the BHXB
case, where they appear to be produced as the accretion process switches from a high
rate of accretion to a lower rate. When the accretion rate is high (the so called high/soft
state), emission is dominated by an accretion disk extending down to very small radii,
whereas at the lower accretion rate (the low/hard state), the disk seems to be truncated,
and a jet is launched (Fender et al. 2004). In the low/hard state, accretion appears to
proceed via the relatively inefficient ADAF mode.
In AGN, strong radio emission is seen in about 5-10% of sources (Peterson 1997), which
suggests that there may be a similar evolutionary track for accretion in these sources
(Jester 2005). However, since the mass of the central black hole is at least 5 orders of
magnitude higher than in a BHXB, the state transition would take place over thousands
of years (state changes in BHXBs take place over timescales of order a year), and so,
observationally, AGN appear to be in a fixed state.
It is clear that there is a strong magnetic field associated with radio jets, since the
emission from the extended jets is predominantly synchrotron radiation, where electrons
lose energy by spiralling around magnetic field lines. It is partly for this reason that the
leading candidate of a launching and collimation mechanism for radio jets relies upon
magnetic field lines (e.g Heyvaerts and Norman 1989).
32 Chapter 2 Accretion
2.3.2 Disk winds
Less obvious observationally, but perhaps more important energetically, are the disk
winds that are expected (and observed) to be launched from accretion disks. A discussion
of the launching mechanisms and different models of disk winds is presented in Chapter
The clearest observational signature of an outflow is the P Cygni line profile, first seen
in the stellar system of the same name. In the case of P Cygni itself, a luminous blue
variable star, the outflow is a stellar wind driven from the surface of the star. However,
the same feature is seen in CVs and BALs (see Figure 1.1 for an example), and here a
disk wind is the proposed outflow.
The P Cygni feature in BALs is due to resonance line scattering of (probably disk)
photons, and Figure 2.5 shows a cartoon illustrating how the classic profile is produced.
The small red circle represents a continuum source, and the larger circle represents an
extended cloud of outflowing gas. Photons coming directly to the observer pass through
the blue segment of the outflow. If the outflow is not fully ionized, photons can scatter
via interactions with line transitions in the gas. Each line occurs at a fixed frequency, but
since the gas is accelerating away from the continuum source, the photon frequency is
Doppler shifted into the rest frame of the gas. For photons coming towards the observer,
the resonant frequency of the line is increasingly blue shifted, and so a broad, blue-shifted
absorption feature will appear in the continuum, starting at the rest frame frequency of
the line and extending to a frequency corresponding to the maximum outflow velocity.
Photons are scattered out of the observers line of sight in the blue segment of the outflow.
However, interactions in the rest of the outflow can scatter photons into the observers
sightline. Photons leaving the far side of the continuum source will encounter gas moving
away from the observer, and so will produce a red-shifted resonance line feature (e.g.
position A in Figure 2.5). Photons scattering from parts of the wind moving towards the
observer (e.g. position C) will similarly produce a blue-shifted resonance line. The sum
of all such scattering events into the observers line of sight will produce a broadened
emission line, centred at the rest frequency of the transition. This broad resonance line

will be superposed on the absorbed continuum to produce the characteristic P Cygni line
shape illustrated at the bottom of Figure 2.5.
This basic argument is for a smooth, spherically symmetric outflow, however more com-
plex profiles will result if the flow is clumpy or non-isotropic. Collisionally excited (ther-
mal) line emission in the outflow or background source can also modify the line profile.
2.3.3 Feedback
Both types of outflow mentioned in the preceding sections have the capability of interact-
ing with the local environment surrounding the accreting object (and indeed far distant
environments, in the case of the radio jets). This is of great interest, particularly in the
case of AGN, where the relatively tiny SMBH at the central of a galaxy appears to have
a significant impact on the evolution of the entire galaxy surrounding it. This effect is
observed, for example, in the so called M   relationship (e.g. Tremaine et al. 2002)
between the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge of a galaxy and the mass of the black
hole at its centre. Also, the overall mass contained in galactic bulges appears correlated
with the mass of the central SMBH, MBULGE ' 103 MSMBH (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998).
There appear to be two distinct modes by which AGN outflows interact with the host
galaxy. These are the radiative or quasar mode of feedback which is likely associated
with disk winds, and the kinetic or radio mode of feedback, probably associated with
radio jets (Fabian 2012). The latter mode is better studied, at least in part because
radio jets are observationally easier to investigate than disk winds. Indeed, some jets
carve out huge bubbles in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) around galaxies, which are
directly observable as cool regions in the hot IGM.
Quasar mode feedback appears to be primarily momentum-driven, with an outflow from
the central accreting object simply pushing gas out of the bulge of the galaxy and thus
halting star formation. It is thought that this is the initial mechanism by which star
formation is quenched, since it would occur early on in the evolution of a quasar, when
the accretion rate would be high, and winds would be strong. This process would thus
move galaxies from the actively star-forming blue cloud to the more passively evolving
Chapter 2 Accretion 35
red sequence (Granato et al. 2001; Schawinski et al. 2007). In contrast, radio mode
feedback is thought to be a kind of maintenance feedback, constantly heating the intra-
cluster medium (ICM). This inhibits new star formation from taking place via cooling
flows in massive red galaxies in the centres of clusters and groups (McNamara and Nulsen
2007).

Chapter 3
Accretion disk winds in AGN
Evidence for powerful disk winds has been found in a wide range of disk accreting as-
trophysical systems, including CVs (e.g. Cordova and Mason 1982), X-ray binaries (e.g.
Ponti et al. 2012) and AGN (e.g. Tombesi et al. 2010; Weymann et al. 1981). Indeed, it
seems that such outflows are a fundamental and universal aspect of accretion physics. It
is widely assumed that these outflows arise from the surface of accretion disks, but the
mechanisms by which they are launched and accelerated are not fully understood. In
this chapter, we will briefly review the leading three basic scenarios for disk wind driving
mechanisms and also introduce some of the specific models for AGN disk winds.
3.1 Driving mechanisms
In order to launch and accelerate a wind from an accretion disk, some kind of driving
force must act upon the gas in order to overcome the inward pull of gravity. There are
three likely sources for this driving force: gas/thermal pressure; radiation pressure and
centrifugal forces mediated by magnetic fields. An introduction to each of these three
driving mechanisms is given in the following sections.
38 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
3.1.1 Pressure driven or thermal disk winds
Pressure-driven winds are produced when the thermal speed of gas in the disk atmosphere
exceeds the local escape velocity. This requires very high temperatures. For example, at
a distance of 1018 cm from a 108M SMBH, the escape velocity is about 1000 km s1.
Hydrogen gas with this mean thermal speed has a temperature of about 3  108 K,
much higher than any temperature expected in a standard  disk (see Figure 2.2).
However, a simple geometrical argument provides a plausible way of achieving such high
temperatures in the outer parts of the disk.
In a disk in hydrostatic equilibrium, the vertical component of the gravitational field
of the central object must be balanced by the pressure of the gas in the disk. This
requirement gives an expression for the scale height, H, of the disk as a function of
radius, R (Kenyon and Hartmann 1987)
, (3.1)
where vs is the local sound speed in the disk, and M is the mass of the central object.
Since v2s  T (r), and, in the standard  disk model, T (r)  r3/4, we see that H/R 
r1/8, so the disk gets thicker with radius. In fact, the geometry can be more complex
than this simple picture. The accretion rate through the disk can affect the structure of
the innermost parts of the disk. If the accretion rate is more than a small fraction of the
Eddington rate, then the inner parts of the disk will be radiation dominated, rather than
pressure dominated and the inner disk will be thicker than expected from Equation 3.1.
This is expected to be the case in AGN and particularly quasars (given their implied
higher accretion rate).
With the proviso that a geometrically thick inner disk could modify the details, the flared
shape of the outer disk means that UV and X-ray radiation produced in the inner disk
can illuminate it. Since the outer parts of the disk are characterised by a relatively low
density, the two-body cooling processes which control the temperature in a cool plasma
(collisionally excited line emission and radiative recombination) are inefficient. Instead,
heating and cooling will be dominated by Compton effects, and the temperature will
Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN 39
tend to the Compton temperature, around 107 K. In our example system, this would
be sufficient to drive a thermal wind at a distance of about 1019 cm from the centre.
Thus, if such winds do exist, they must be produced at relatively large distances from
the SMBH, past the radius at which the escape velocity is equal to the isothermal sound
speed at the Compton temperature (Begelman et al. 1983). This is the Compton radius,
rC given by
9.8 109
MSMBH
cm, (3.2)
where TC8 is the Compton temperature in units of 108K (Netzer 2006).
Begelman et al. (1983) carried out a theoretical investigation of the dynamics of ther-
mal winds, and concluded that significant mass loss was possible. Furthermore, they
suggested that this type of wind could provide the hot confining gas required in cloud
models of the BLR (Krolik et al. 1981). It is less clear whether thermal winds could
produce BALs in the UV, since the velocities of these outflows are too low, and the
temperature is too high. They have, however, been invoked as a possible source of the
so called warm absorbers that are thought to produce the relatively narrow X-ray
absorption features observed in some AGN (Krolik and Kriss 2001).
3.1.2 Radiation-pressure or line-driven winds
We have already encountered radiation pressure in the calculation of the Eddington
limit in Chapter 2. In that simplified treatment, Thompson scattering was taken to
be the dominant interaction mechanism between matter and radiation. However, as
mentioned there, interactions with bound electrons via resonance lines provide a far more
efficient way of transferring momentum from photons to a partially ionized or neutral
gas. Since the clearest indicator of outflowing gas, the P Cygni line profile, is formed
through resonance line scattering, it is likely that line driving provides at least part of
the accelerating force in any wind exhibiting such features.
The definitive paper on the subject of line driving is by Castor, Abbott, and Klein (1975),
who investigated the effect of scattering and absorption by lines in the atmosphere of Of
40 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
stars. They couch their equations in the form of a force multiplier,M(t), which is the
factor by which the line-driving force exceeds the force due to electron scattering alone.
The radiation force, frad, is given by
frad =
M(t), (3.3)
where F is the total flux and e is the mass scattering coefficient of free electrons. M
is a function of t (an optical depth variable scaled to remove the effect of line strength),
which in turn depends on the velocity profile of the gas (both thermal and bulk) and the
details of the lines doing the driving. The value of t is calculated in a summation carried
out over all lines in resonance over the frequency range of the calculation. M(t) has a
maximum value of around 2000 in ideal conditions (Gayley 1995), placing a rough lower
limit on the luminosity required for efficient line-driving, L> 0.0005Ledd. Although their
initial treatment was designed for stellar winds, it has also been shown that line driving
could produce winds from accretion disks (e.g Shlosman et al. 1985; Proga et al. 2000).
The force multiplier treatment of line driving was extended to disk winds by Stevens and
Kallman (1990) who computed the line-driving force multiplier as a function of ionization
parameter, 1, for X-ray binaries. This treatment included the ionizing effect of X-rays
produced from the inner regions of the accretion disks in such systems, and they found
that the multiplier drops off dramatically as  exceeds a value of around 100. This is
because the number of lines decreases dramatically as gas becomes more ionized. Figure
3.1, reproduced from the paper, shows the response of M to . This data has since
been used in the simulation of AGN scale disk winds (see section 3.2.1.2), which are also
expected to be exposed to a strong X-ray source.
It turns out that it is quite challenging to find a simple wind geometry in which  remains
sufficiently low to allow significant line driving. As a quick illustration, let us postulate
that the BLR in quasars is associated with a wind, as in the model suggested by Elvis
(2000). Considering a typical quasar X-ray luminosity of around Lx = 1044 ergs s1, a

distance to the BLR region of Rx' 1016 cm, and a density of 1010 cm3, we obtain
nHR2x
1010  1016  1016 = 100; (3.4)
we are already at the limit of line driving. To make matters worse, we have neglected
the contribution of the UV bright parts of the accretion disk to the ionizing flux in our
estimate.
This back-of-the-envelope calculation is a good illustration of the main difficulty faced by
line-driven disk wind models. However, there are good reasons to further investigate this
driving mechanism. Firstly, as previously mentioned, the presence of P Cygni features in
the UV spectra of BALQSOs demonstrates that theremust be some degree of line driving.
Secondly, some BALQSOs exhibit a spectral feature colourfully known as the ghost of
Ly (Arav et al. 1995; Arav 1996). Observationally, this is a slight hump seen in the
blue shifted absorption trough of BALs, centred at around 5900 km s1. The proposed
mechanism for its formation is explicitly linked to line driving. More specifically, if the
outflow producing the BALs is line driven, and the BEL region is inside the BAL region,
then the strong Ly BEL will contribute to the acceleration of the outflow. Photons
42 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
from this line will interact with Nv in the part of the wind where the velocity relative to
the BEL region is 5900 km s1, the separation in velocity space between the Ly and
N v1240 lines. This interaction will give a little extra acceleration to this layer of the
wind, causing a local reduction in optical depth and hence a hump in the absorption
line profile. Since other BALs are formed in the same part of the wind, the optical depth
in those transitions will also be reduced, causing slightly less absorption at a wavelength
shifted from the peak by the same velocity. This feature may already have been seen in
several BALQSOs (Arav et al. 1995; North et al. 2006, but also see Cottis et al. 2010).
In order to overcome the problems of over-ionization, most models of line-driven disk
winds incorporate some kind of shielding gas to attenuate the ionizing radiation before
it encounters the wind. Some of the most successful line-driven wind models are described
later in this chapter, where we will see that there is a plausible physical explanation for
the existence of this attenuating shield.
3.1.3 Magnetocentrifugal and magnetically confined winds.
Accretion disks are likely to contain magnetic fields, since infalling material will retain
any field it had prior to joining the disk. Magnetic fields are also clearly an important
component of the radio jets seen in many AGN. It is therefore natural to ask whether
these fields could also be involved in driving the observed disk winds.
In the model proposed by Blandford and Payne (1982), gas is initially lifted from the
disk surface by thermal expansion, but it is confined by poloidal magnetic field lines
which are frozen into the disk and rotate with it. If the field lines make an angle of less
than 60 to the disk, the centrifugal force drives the hot gas out along the field lines.
The gas therefore gains rotational velocity, and this bead-on-a-wire motion provides a
mechanism for the removal of angular momentum from the disk.
A critical point in the flow is reached at the Alfvn radius, where the magnetic pressure
equals the gas pressure. At this point, the magnetic field stops controlling the flow of
the gas, and the gas starts to flow radially. However, the field lines are still frozen into
the gas, and so the field lines wind up, causing the field to become more toroidal and
Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN 43
stronger. This mechanism is a possible source for the collimating fields of radio jets (e.g
Heyvaerts and Norman 1989).
Magnetocentrifugal winds do not require any kind of additional driving mechanism once
the plasma has been launched. They are therefore good solutions in systems which either
lack the luminosity for other types of driving (e.g. YSOs) or are over-ionized (Proga
2007). However, the magnetic field of the disk may also confine a wind predominantly
driven by another mechanism, thereby maintaining a high density and low ionization
parameter (de Kool and Begelman 1995; Proga 2000). This overcomes one of the main
problems with line-driven winds - the tendency of the strong ionizing flux of the central
source to overionize the wind and thus remove its driving mechanism.
3.2 Disk wind models
This section briefly reviews the geometries that have been calculated or postulated for
a few of the most influential disk wind models. Wherever possible a figure is provided
to illustrate the proposed geometry. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list; in
particular, it is mostly restricted to models that attempt at least in part to explain the
origin of BALs.
3.2.1 Radiation-driven winds
The observational clues of P Cygni line profiles in BALQSOs, and the ghost of Ly offer
strong evidence that line driving is occurring at some level in disk winds. The question
is whether it can be the sole driving mechanism. In this section some of the models
that aim to explain disk winds via line driving are introduced. A recurring theme is the
requirement for some kind of shield to protect the outflow from overionization.
3.2.1.1 Murray and Chiang - a line-driven disk wind model
In the first of a series of influential papers, Murray et al. (1995) compute a disk wind
model arising from an accretion disk surrounding a 108M SMBH accreting at a rate of
44 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
1.8M yr
1 (about 50% of the Eddington luminosity for  = 0.06). They find a solution
which produces a line-driven disk wind arising at radii outside about 1016 cm which
carries away about 10% of the accreting gas. The opening angle of the wind is around
5, which gives a covering factor of around 10% for the outflow as seen by the central
source of UV radiation.
In order for line driving to be efficient, the ionization parameter must be  < 100 (see
Figure 3.1). However, the X-ray source at the centre tends to overionize the wind.
The solution proposed by Murray and Chiang takes the form of so-called hitchhiking
gas, which is drawn along with the line-driven gas due to pressure gradients. It rapidly
becomes overionized and falls back, but shields the outflowing wind in the process. Their
figure illustrating the geometry is reproduced below as Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2: Schematic of line driven disk wind proposed by Murray et al. (1995).
Murray et al. (1995) also demonstrate that BELs can be produced from the dense base
of the wind, while BALs are formed in the outer parts of the wind where it has been
accelerated to large outflow velocities. This model was fleshed out in several follow
up papers. For example, Murray and Chiang (1995) suggest that the material at the
innermost edge of the wind could be the source of the warm absorbers seen in X-rays,
whilst Murray and Chiang (1997) demonstrate that the characteristic single-peaked line
profile shapes of BELs are a natural consequence of line formation in a disk wind.
3.2.1.2 Proga, Stone & Kallman - a hydrodynamical, line-driven disk wind
model
Using the zeus hydrodynamic code, with some modifications to include the effect of line-
driving, Proga, Stone, and Kallman (2000, hereafter referred to as PSK) produced the
Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN 45
first of a series of hydrodynamic models of line-driven disk winds. In these simulations,
the ionization state of the gas in the model was set by the X-ray luminosity of a centrally
located source, LX, taking account of continuum attenuation between the source and
each point in the wind. This gives an ionization parameter for each part of the wind,
which is then translated into a line driving force multiplier using the parametrisations
from Stevens and Kallman (1990) (Figure 3.1).
In their model the central source was also a source of UV photons, with luminosity
LUV, and these photons together with those produced from the central parts of the disk
interact with the ionized gas, via resonance lines, to drive a disk wind. The temperature
of the gas was also computed from the ionization parameter, and then the equations of
motion were solved. The solution is reproduced here in Figure 3.3. In this initial model,
the mass of the central object is assumed to be 108 M, and the accretion rate is taken
to be Macc = 1.8 M yr1 (50% of the Eddington rate). This is used to calculate the
total disk luminosity LD, and the luminosity of the central object is then set equal to LD
and split equally between LUV and LX.
PSK report that a strong outflow forms in this simulation, carrying a mass of
Mwind = 0.5M yr
1 and starting at a radius of about 1016 cm. The flow quickly accel-
erates to the velocities required to produce BAL profiles in line with observations. The
covering factor of this wind is around 0.2, centred at angles around 75. However, the
flow is unsteady, producing dense knots on the timescale of a few years in the rest frame
of the quasar. Importantly, they also find a region inside the launching radius where a
wind is initially lifted from the disk, but is overionized by the central X-ray source, and
thus falls back to the disk. This failed wind provides shielding for the successful wind,
doing the job of the hitch-hiking gas in Murray et al. (1995).
This model is further tested in Proga and Kallman (2004), in which only disk photons
are counted as contributors to the line-driving force, and the central X-ray source is only
attenuated by electron scattering (although it is assumed to have a lower luminosity of
LX = 0.1LD). Even under these less favourable conditions, a wind is still launched;
its density and velocity fields are reproduced in Figure 3.4. Synthetic profiles for the

3.2.1.3 Risaliti and Elvis - a non-hydrodynamical line-driven disk wind model
A related wind model was presented by Risaliti and Elvis (2010). They consider a SMBH
mass of 2108M accreting at 50% of the Eddington rate and model it both analytically
and with a code called qwind. This code calculates the radiation pressure on the wind
based upon a simplified estimate of the local ionization parameter. They do not solve the
equations of hydrodynamics for the wind, rather they concentrate on more approximate
calculations which allows a wider range of different parameters to be investigated.
Figure 3.5: Wind streamlines for a line-driven disk wind as calculated by Risaliti
and Elvis (2010).
They find that there is an inner region where the wind becomes overionized and falls
back to the disk surface, forming a shield similar to the hitchhiking gas postulated by
Murray et al. (1995) and the failed wind found by Proga et al. (2000). At large radii, the
UV flux from the disk is too low to accelerate the wind to escape velocity, and so once
more the wind fails. However, in between these two regions, at around 200 Schwarzchild
radii ( 6 1015 cm) there is a thin region where the ionization state is low enough, and
the UV flux high enough, to allow efficient line driving. This drives an outflow at about
20 above the disk plane, with a covering fraction of a few percent. One of their wind
models is reproduced here as Figure 3.5.
Investigating the effect of the Eddington ratio of the central objects, they find that the
wind moves outwards and accelerates as L/LEdd increases towards 0.5, but then decreases
48 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
as the wind becomes more ionized, and line-driving becomes less efficient. For ratios less
than about 0.3, no wind is launched.
Very similar calculations were carried out by Nomura et al. (2013). However, they used an
improved ionization scheme and a more realistic mass outflow rate. A cartoon illustrating
their calculation is reproduced in the left hand panel of Figure 3.6, along with one of
their wind solutions for a 108M SMBH accreting at 50% of the Eddington rate.
Figure 3.6: Cartoon of proposed geometry (left panel) and simulated flow (right
panel) from Nomura et al. (2013).
They find that BAL features would be expected for a range of SMBH masses between
107  108.5M and for a range of Eddington ratios from 0.3 to 0.9. For larger SMBH
masses they do not find a wind, because the cooler disk produces an insufficient UV flux
to drive it.
3.2.2 Magneto-centrifugal winds
Most models of magnetically driven winds do not suggest that the magnetic effects
are the sole accelerating mechanism. Some use the magnetic field lines to constrict
the outflowing gas, thereby increasing its density and reducing the ionization state to
the point where line driving becomes possible. Others include the bead on a wire
mechanism of magneto-centrifugal acceleration as both an additional driving mechanism
and a way of extracting angular momentum from the disk. In this section, some of the
models which explicitly rely on magnetic fields are reviewed.
Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN 49
3.2.2.1 Emmering, Blandford and Shlosman - a model of a
magneto-centrifugally accelerated disk wind
Emmering et al. (1992) set out to explain BELs in terms of dense molecular clouds flung
out from the outer parts of the accretion disk by magnetic stresses. These clouds quickly
become exposed to the ionizing flux from the central parts of the disk and thus become
photoionized. The clouds remain dense enough to maintain the ionization state seen in
BLR regions, because they are confined by the magnetic field lines. A cartoon illustrating
the model is reproduced in Figure 3.7.
Figure 3.7: Schematic of magnetically driven disk wind proposed by Emmering
et al. (1992).
The clouds are launched from the outer part of the disk, with a typical launch distance
of about a parsec for an AGN with ionizing luminosity of 1046 ergs s1. At this distance,
the bulk velocity of the clouds would not produce the observed line widths, and so
line broadening due to high temperature electrons in an intra-cloud medium is invoked.
They are able to show that the typical cloud sizes, electron densities, filling factors
and velocities are comparable with observations. They also suggest that, with some
modifications, BALs could be explained by their model.
50 Chapter 3 Accretion disk winds in AGN
3.2.2.2 de Kool and Begelman - a magnetically confined, radiation-driven
disk wind
A simple disk wind model in which magnetic fields are included as a factor is presented by
de Kool and Begelman (1995). They investigate whether BAL features can be produced
in a clumpy wind arising in the outlying parts of a disk. Using similar arguments to
Emmering et al. (1992), they suggest that such an outflow could first be confined by
magnetic field lines threading the disk and wind, and then compressed by radiation
pressure from the central source. An illustration of the wind geometry from their paper
is reproduced in Figure 3.8.
Figure 3.8: Illustration of a clumpy, magnetically confined wind reproduced from
de Kool and Begelman (1995).
The initial launching mechanism is suggested to be magnetic buoyancy or interactions
between cool molecular clouds in the disk, which gives some clouds a small vertical
velocity. As the clouds leave the disk, they are exposed to the radiation from the central
source and are heated up. The magnetic field prevents sideways expansion, and the
plasma is squeezed up between the field lines, becoming a filamentary outflowing wind.
The wind is then accelerated outwards via UV line driving.
This model suggests that the wind is launched at about 1018 cm from the central source,
about 100 times further out than the line-driven disk wind of Murray et al. (1995). At
such a large distance, there is no issue in maintaining the ionization state required to

show UV BALs, and no shielding gas is required. They find that a mass-loss rate of
 1 M yr1 is required for a 108M SMBH to produce the right covering factor to
explain the BAL fraction.
3.2.2.3 Everett - a hybrid line-driven / magneto-centrifugal disk wind
Everett (2005) explores how line driving can be combined with a magneto-centrifugal
model of a disk wind from a disk around a 108M SMBH. He chooses an Eddington
ratio of L/Ledd = 0.01 for his fiducial model and splits the wind into two components
to simplify the calculations. At radii close to the assumed launch radius of 3 1016 cm,
the wind becomes over-ionized, but the magneto-centrifugal effect means that the wind
is still able to accelerate outwards. This inner wind then provides a shield for an outer
wind, which is in a lower ionization state and can therefore be accelerated via line driving
to very high velocities. A schematic of this model is reproduced here as Figure 3.9.
When the Eddington ratio of the central source is increased, the wind tends to become
overionized, even with the shield, and line driving declines. For lower values of L/Ledd,
the UV flux is insufficient for line driving.
Figure 3.9: Schematic of the hybrid line-driven /magneto-centrifugal disk wind
proposed by Everett (2005).
This model was extended somewhat by Gallagher and Everett (2007) with the incorpo-
ration of a third wind component from the dusty torus. The driving mechanism for this
last component is suggested to be UV radiation pressure on dust grains. This dusty wind
is highly equatorial and would be expected to produce the strong absorption seen in the
rarely observed type 2 Quasars. This extended geometry is reproduced in Figure 3.10.

Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
This chapter introduces our photoionization and radiative transfer code, python, first
described in Long and Knigge (2002). Significant modifications to the code have been
made in the process of this project, but the basic approach is unchanged, and this is
described in detail here. In addition, all of the physics included in the original version
of python are still used in the new version, and so these are also described here. The
main exception to this is the ionization calculation, where a new approach has been
introduced which improves the treatment of AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs).
This updated scheme is discussed in the next chapter, but the original scheme is described
here for completeness.
4.1 Radiative transfer - the need for Monte Carlo
Radiative transfer (RT) calculations treat the passage of a ray of given specific intensity
through a medium. As the ray progresses, the specific intensity can increase if the
medium is radiating energy, and it can decrease due to opacity. These two processes are
summarised in the RT equation
= I + j , (4.1)
54 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
where dI/ds is the rate of change of specific intensity I with distance travelled along
a path segment of length ds,  is the absorption coefficient and j is the emission
coefficient. In order to solve the RT equation, it can be recast in terms of another
variable, the optical depth
 = ds. (4.2)
Dividing both sides of Equation 4.1 by  the RT equation can be rewritten as
= I + S , (4.3)
where S is the source function for the medium, defined as
. (4.4)
The RT equation can now be solved if the intensity and source function are expressed as
functions of the optical depth. The formal solution of the RT equation is
I() = I(0)e
 +
e(
)S(
 , (4.5)
where the first term on the right hand side refers to the attenuation of the ray, and the
second term is the contribution of emission in the medium along the path the ray has
taken. If the geometry is sufficiently simple, then this equation can be used to compute
an emergent spectrum. However, if one wishes to calculate RT through a geometry with
little or no symmetry or with a clumpy distribution of opacity and emission, then the
problem becomes analytically intractable. In such cases the equation of RT needs to be
solved numerically.
The Monte Carlo method is one such numerical method. The fundamental idea is to
simulate RT through a distribution of material by tracing the path of individual photons
through a computer representation of the medium under consideration. As the photons
progress through the model, they can be absorbed by the medium and more can be
generated through radiative processes. When they finally exit the medium, they can
be added up to produce an emergent spectrum. The method is named after the casino
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 55
on the French Riviera because it is largely probabilistic, starting with the generation
of photons. These are produced randomly in such a way as to properly represent the
photon distribution that would be seen in the real object. There are many variants of
the Monte Carlo method, and in the rest of this chapter we will describe how the method
is implemented in our RT code, python.
4.2 Overview of the method
An RT simulation in python begins with the construction of a computational grid of
cells. Physical parameters such as density, temperature and velocity are associated
with each cell. These are either calculated from a kinematic prescription for a wind,
or input directly from an externally defined wind model. The initial ionization state of
the wind is set by assuming each cell is illuminated by a dilute blackbody. The mean
intensity in the cell is therefore
J = WB(Tr), (4.6)
where the radiation temperature, Tr, is set to the initial temperature of the cell, and the
dilution factor, W , is initially assumed to be purely geometric, i.e.
W = 0.5
1R2
, (4.7)
where R is the radius of the central star and r is the distance of the cell from the star.
A system of radiating sources is then defined, which can include an accretion disk and a
central object. Photons are produced from these sources and then tracked through the
wind. They are used to compute the heating in grid cells via the various heating processes
discussed in section 4.5.1, and therefore an improved estimate of the cell temperature.
They are also used to compute the frequency-averaged mean intensity, J , and mean
frequency, , for the cell.
In the original version of the code described here, these parameters are in turn used to
calculate improved estimates of Tr and W . This results in a more accurate model of J ,
based upon the radiation which actually reaches the cell and thereby taking some account
56 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
of absorption and emission between the source and the cell. This improved model of J ,
along with the new temperature, is then used to calculate an updated ionization state.
At this point, a new population of photons is generated, and the process is repeated in
an iterative fashion until the temperature of each cell converges.
Once the wind temperature and ionization state have converged, synthetic spectra may
be computed. To this end, photons are once more produced and propagated though the
converged wind model. These photons are captured as they leave the model and used to
produce synthetic spectra at user-defined sightlines. The photons are typically produced
over a reduced frequency range to improve signal-to-noise, and other variance reduction
techniques are used to further improve the spectrum. This execution cycle is summarised
below in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: An overview of the execution cycle of a python simulation.
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 57
4.3 Radiating sources
In python, emission processes are dealt with separately from absorption processes. The
former are treated as sources of photon packets, generated at the start of a calculation
cycle, whilst the latter are calculated as the photon packets pass through the wind. The
wind itself can generate photon packets. However, once converged, the wind is assumed
to be in thermal and radiative equilibrium and so it is not a net source of energy, rather
it reprocesses absorbed packets. This section deals with the different sources of photons,
the physics of emission and the details of how the various mechanisms are implemented.
4.3.1 Photon packet production
The photon packet, defined by its frequency  and its weight w, is the basic modelling
unit in python. In the most simple implementation, all photon packets have the same
weight. This weight is equal to the total luminosity of all radiating sources integrated
over the frequency range required, divided by the number of photon packets, Nphot, i.e.
sources
 max
Nphot
. (4.8)
Thus w has units of luminosity, ergs s1.
The frequency of a packet is chosen randomly in such a way as to produce the correct
SED. This is achieved by converting the required SED into a cumulative distribution
function, P ,
)d  max
L( )d 
. (4.9)
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) monotonically increases from 0 at min
to 1 at max. Figure 4.2 illustrates the form of the CDF for a Planck function with
Teff = 10
In order to select a photon frequency, one therefore calculates a random number from
a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and inverts the CDF to find the frequency
corresponding to this probability. In practice this approach has a few limitations, so
various techniques are employed to improve results.

Planck function
Figure 4.2: A Planck function with Teff = 105K and associated CDF.
First, it is often desirable to ensure that a sufficient number of photons are produced at
certain frequencies, for example around photoionization edges. If these frequencies lie on
the Wien tail of a blackbody distribution, it is rather unlikely that many such photons
would be generated, since the vast bulk of the luminosity is produced at lower frequencies.
We see this in Figure 4.2, where the CDF at 2 1016 Hz (near the photoionization edge
of the important ion C iv) is 0.987. Thus if we sample directly from the CDF, only 13
photons in every 1000 would have a frequency above this value. However, the precise
shape of the Wien tail is critical in accurately modelling the photoionization state of a
plasma. It is therefore important to produce a sufficient number of energy packets from
this part of the spectrum to ensure that this population of high energy photons has a
fair chance of propagating to all parts of the wind.
In order to cope with such cases, python implements a strategy called importance
sampling. Here, the frequency range over which photons is generated is subdivided
into bands. The weight of photon packets is permitted to differ between bands, which
allows one to produce a large number of low-weight photons to represent parts of the
SED far away from the peak luminosity that are still important to the calculation.
Following changes to the ionization scheme described in Chapter 5, this banding of
photon generation has become much more important, since accurate modelling of the
spectrum in a given cell requires good sampling across the frequency range. The relatively
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 59
more simple dilute blackbody model of the spectrum in a cell (used in the original version
of python described here; Equation 4.6) is more forgiving of sparse sampling. This is
because all that is required is a good estimate of the radiation temperature and frequency-
averaged mean intensity (see section 4.6).
The second limitation is a computational one: it is not always possible to construct an
algebraic expression for the CDF. For example, in the case of a power-law SED, the CDF
is a simple function, and one can easily invert it. However, in the case of a blackbody,
it is not possible solve Equation 4.9 analytically. Photon packets can also be produced
by line emission, and the SED for this process is more complex still. In such cases, the
CDF is constructed numerically on a fixed grid of P . A random number is then used to
select a bin, and the exact frequency chosen for the photon is calculated by interpolating
between the two bin limits. This interpolation can take account of the known form of
the SED - e.g. if we are in the Rayleigh Jeans or Wien limits of a blackbody spectrum,
or failing that, linear interpolation can be used.
Having described the basic mechanism of photon generation, the next sections describe
the three main sources of photons in the original version of python.
4.3.2 Photon source 1: the central source
Prior to the start of the current project, most models contained a central star, defined
by its temperature T, its radius, R and its mass M. The radiation from the star can
either be modelled as a simple blackbody or using externally defined stellar atmosphere
models. The Eddington approximation of limb darkening is also accounted for, in the
CDF for the photon packets direction of emission. One may also define an additional
source of photons, the boundary layer, which is of use in modelling CVs where high
frequency photons can be produced in a transition region between the accretion disk
and the surface of the star (Popham and Narayan 1995). In an AGN model, the star is
replaced by a source of X-rays (see section 5.2).
60 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
4.3.3 Photon source 2: the accretion disk
The accretion disk is modelled as an -disk, described in section 2.2.2. This allows
calculation of the luminosity of an annulus of the disk at radius r of width r
Lannulus ' 2rrT 4. (4.10)
The disk is radially sub-divided into equal-luminosity annuli, and a random number is
used to select from which annulus a photon will be emitted. The temperature of each
annulus is assumed to be constant, and the frequency of the photon generated is normally
chosen from a blackbody distribution or an imported stellar atmosphere model. In the
latter case, the local surface gravity is calculated taking into account the central object
only. The actual location of the photon packet emission within an annulus is randomised
along with the direction of emission, which takes account of foreshortening and limb
darkening.
4.3.4 Photon source 3: the wind
The wind is also a source of radiation, generating photon packets via free-free (bremsstrah-
lung), free-bound (recombination) and thermal, collisionally excited, bound-bound (line)
emission. In a converged model, the wind is treated as being in radiative equilibrium, so
it is not a net source of photons, but rather a reprocessing medium. Thus the luminosity
of a converged wind cell summed over all three emission processes is equal to the radia-
tive heating rate in that cell, less any non-radiative cooling due to adiabatic expansion.
Before convergence, this balance does not hold. Hot cells can cool down by emitting
more energy than they absorb, and cool cells may not emit all the energy they absorb.
In the first ionization cycle, before a heating rate for each cell is known, wind emission is
calculated using an initial estimate of the wind temperature. The details of the emission
processes as implemented in python are introduced in the rest of this section.
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 61
4.3.4.1 Free-free emission
The free-free emissivity per unit volume is given by
4jff = neni
gffeh/kTe (4.11)
for an ion j of density ni and charge Z. When generating photons from the wind, this
expression is integrated over the frequency range of the simulation and summed over
all ionic species present. In practice, in typical conditions, the free-free emissivity will
always be dominated by interactions of electrons with H ii, He ii and He iii ions, so the
summation is only carried out over these three species. The gaunt factor, gff , is set to
unity. So, in a given band,
Lff = V
 max
4jff d. (4.12)
4.3.4.2 Free-bound emission
The free-bound emissivity due to an ion in the ground state of ionization state i + 1,
recombining to level l of ionization state i is calculated via the Milne relation from the
photoionization cross section bf

(i,l)

Thus the total luminosity due to free-bound emission is
Lfb = V
levels
 max
(i,l)
d, (4.14)
where the summation is carried out over all ions and also all levels. The level populations
for excited levels are calculated using
ni,l = ni
Ek/kTr
zi(Tr)
, (4.15)
62 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
where zi is the partition function for the ion calculated from
levels
El/kTr . (4.16)
The statistical weight of level l is gl, and El is the excitation energy. If W = 1, and
Tr = Te, the requirements for local thermodynamic equlibrium (LTE), then the equation
reduces to the normal Boltzmann equation. This represents a first-order approximation
to a non-LTE level population, where the levels are radiatively excited. The radiative
weight W and the radiation temperature Tr are the parameters calculated for the black-
body model of the mean intensity in each cell (Equation 4.6).
4.3.4.3 Line emission
The final emission process is thermal, collisionally excited, line emission. To understand
this process, it is worth a quick diversion into the microphysics of line interactions. When
a photon interacts with an ion via a line interaction, the ion in question is excited to
a higher energy state, and the photon is destroyed. This process can be described as
line opacity. The excited ion can relax in one of two ways. Firstly, it can radiatively
de-excite, thereby re-emitting essentially the same photon; the photon is said to have
scattered. Alternatively, the excited ion can be collisionally de-excited, and the photon
is lost - this process is true absorption.
An ion can also be excited by interactions with the electron pool - this is collisional
excitation, and the excited ion can once again relax collisionally (in which case the energy
is returned to the electron pool) or radiatively, in which case a photon is generated. This
latter process is what we would call collisionally excited line emission, and this is what
we want to treat as line emission from the wind.
The source function for line emission, taking account of both scattering and true absorp-
tion is
S = (1 q)J + qB(Te), (4.17)
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 63
where q is the fraction of excited ions which relax collisionally rather than radiatively.
The first term therefore represents the scattered photons from the incoming radiation
and the second term is the thermally generated photons. python treats line emission
in the two-level atom approximation. The source function for line transitions between
upper level u and lower level l can be written as
jline
line
nuAul
nlBlu  nuBul
, (4.18)
where Aul is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, Blu is the coefficient for
induced absorption, and Bul is the coefficient for induced emission. The number densities
in the two levels (nu and nl) are related by the rate equation,
nl(clu +BluJ) = nu(cul +Aul +BulJ) (4.19)
where clu and cul are the collisional rates for excitation and de-exitation respectively.
Combining these expressions, and comparing the result with Equation 4.17 allows an
expression for q to be written down,
1 eh/kTe
Aul + cul
1 eh/kTe
) . (4.20)
From Equation 4.17, the line emission coefficient is given by
jline = qlineB(Te). (4.21)
The total line absorption coefficient is given by
line =
(nlBlu  nuBul) =
nl  nu
Aul, (4.22)
and thus we can write an expression for the line emission coefficient
jline = q
nl  nu
eh/kTe  1
. (4.23)
64 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
The total line luminosity for a cell of volume V is given by
Llines = V
lines
4jline. (4.24)
However, not all photons produced by a particular line transition in a cell would be
expected to escape that cell, due to interactions with the same line in neighbouring
atoms. This is called line trapping, and it turns out that Equation 4.23 requires only
slight modification to take account of this.
The chance of a line photon escaping the region in which it is generated can be described
in terms of the escape probability formalism. The probability that such a photon will
escape in a given direction n is given by the escape probability,
Pesc =
1 e(n)
(n)
, (4.25)
where (n) is the optical depth of the cell in the direction n.
Therefore, the proportion of photons which escape the region in which they are generated
is just the angle-averaged escape probability Pesc. This means that a fraction 1 
Pesc will be reabsorbed locally. As already discussed, such interactions result in an
excited ion which can de-excite radiatively or collisionally. In the latter case, the photon
energy returns to the electron pool, thereby reducing the expected line luminosity. The
fraction of excited ions that collisionally de-excite is just the probability of collisional de-
excitation, q. We define a new absorption fraction, Q, which is the fraction of photons
that are absorbed by a line interaction, taking account of line trapping:
q + Pesc (1 q)
. (4.26)
We can then re-write Equation 4.23 to take account of this by simply replacing q with
jlineesc = Q
nl  nu
eh/kTe  1
. (4.27)
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 65
The actual line luminosity of the cell is then
Llines = V
lines
Pesc 4jlineesc . (4.28)
This is the equation for line emission used in the simulations presented in this thesis.
Equation 4.27 contains nu, the number density of ions in the excited state. This is effec-
tively a correction term, which takes account of stimulated emission. The ratio between
number densities in the two levels is calculated in the on-the-spot approximation1 using
Equation 4.19, assuming that the mean intensity can be modelled as a dilute blackbody
(Equation 4.6). This gives
clu +BluWB(Tr)
cul +Aul +BulWB(Tr)
. (4.29)
The collisional de-excitation rate coefficient, cul, is calculated from the collision strength,
which is in turn calculated using the g-bar, or van Regemorter (1962) approximation.
The collisional excitation coefficient clu is calculated from cul using a detailed balance
argument. The population in the lower level nl is calculated using Equation 4.15 if
that level is the ground state. If both levels are excited, then the population of each is
calculated with respect to the ground state separately.
4.3.4.4 Wind photon weights and directions
The total wind luminosity is the sum of the contributions from all three mechanisms,
Lwind = Llines + Lfb + Lff , (4.30)
and is added to the disk and central source luminosities to give the total luminosity. The
weight of each photon packet is then calculated, with the number of photons generated
from each source set to be in proportion to the source luminosity. The number of photons
produced by each wind emission mechanism is split in the same way.
1The on-the-spot approximation assumes all locally emitted radiation is reabsorbed close to where it
is produced, meaning that the local mean intensity is dominated by the radiation arriving from remote
sources.
66 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
The frequency of free-free and free-bound photon packets is decided via a numerically
calculated CDF, just as for blackbody photons. For line photon packets, the frequency
is chosen by selecting which transition emits the photon, based on a CDF calculated as
a sum over the frequency-ordered lines
P (i) =
i=0,i Li
Llines
. (4.31)
Free-free and free-bound wind photons are emitted isotropically, but line photons are
emitted with a directional CDF based upon the angle-dependent escape probability,
given by Equation 4.25.
Once the photon packets have been launched, they are tracked through the wind struc-
ture. In the next section, we will briefly discuss the sources of opacity in the wind; the
method by which the path of a photon is determined; and how the estimators of the
radiation field in each cell are computed. These are used to determine the ionization
state of the wind.
4.4 Radiative transfer in the wind
The equation of radiative transfer (Equation 4.1) includes both emission and absorption
processes in the calculation of the rate of change of intensity as a beam of radiation
passes through a medium. In python they are treated separately. Emission takes the
form of the production of photon packets by the wind and was discussed in section 4.3.4.
Absorption is formally split into scattering and true absorption, although it is worth not-
ing that this is an artificial distinction. Physically, scattering is just absorption followed
quickly by re-emission of an identical photon. It is convenient to treat this as the same
photon, thereby making the distinction between scattering and true absorption (where
the photon is destroyed). Scattering processes therefore do not change the weight of a
photon packet, but they may cause the packet to change direction. True absorption pro-
cesses cause a reduction in weight of the photon packet, with the balance of the energy
going into heating the wind.
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 67
python therefore splits absorption processes into scattering and true absorption pro-
cesses. Electron scattering and line scattering are treated as pure scattering processes,
causing the photon packet to change direction without loss of weight2. In contrast, free-
free and photoionization processes are treated as true absorption processes, which can
remove energy from a photon packet along its entire path through the wind, but do not
change its direction.
4.4.1 Tracking the path of photon packets
The path a photon packet takes through the wind is a series of straight path segments,
along which its weight can be reduced by true absorption. These path segments are
linked by scattering events. Thus the procedure for tracking a photon packet involves
searching for locations at which the packet will scatter. This is a probabilistic process,
based upon the cumulative scattering optical depth along the path segment.
When a photon packet enters a grid cell containing plasma, a randomised optical depth,
T , is generated
T =  ln(1 p), (4.32)
where p is a random number with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. As the packet
moves through the the cell, the cumulative scattering optical depth, scat due to electron
and line scattering along its path is calculated. If/when this equals T , the packet scatters.
If the packet reaches the boundary of a cell, the accumulated value of scat is retained,
along with the T , and the photon continues into the next cell. This process continues
until the photon eventually scatters or leaves the wind. Once a new scattering location
is found, the total absorption opacity along the path segment from the last scattering
location is calculated, and used to reduce the weight of the packet - this lost energy heats
the cells that the packet has passed through. The procedure continues until the photon
packet leaves the wind, strikes an absorbing surface, or has its weight reduced to zero by
continuum opacity. The procedure is summarised in Figure 4.3 below.
2In fact, when scattering from a line, the weight of the photon packet can be reduced since, as already
discussed, a proportion of the excited ions will de-excite via collisional processes rather than radiative
ones. This is taken account of in the code - see Section 4.4.4.
68 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
Figure 4.3: An overview of the radiation transfer scheme.
The following sections briefly describe the implementation of the various scattering and
absorption mechanisms, starting with electron scattering.
4.4.2 Scattering processes
4.4.2.1 Electron Scattering
The electron scattering absorption coefficient in the Thompson limit depends only on
the electron density, ne, and the Thompson scattering cross section, T
es = Tne. (4.33)
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 69
The electron scattering optical depth along a path of length ds is then simply
 es = esds, (4.34)
which simply increases monotonically along the path of a photon packet through a cell. If
electron scattering were the only scattering process, then discovering the point where the
packet scatters would be a simple matter. However, in the situations we are interested
in, line opacity is important.
4.4.2.2 Line opacity and the Sobolev approximation
Line opacity in a wind requires special treatment, since it is not a continuous process.
python treats line opacity using the Sobolev approximation, in which each line is treated
separately, with resonance events taking place only on physically distinct Sobolev sur-
faces. These surfaces are where, through Doppler shifting of the photon frequency into
the local frame, a photon comes into resonance with a given line. Therefore, the process
by which a photon is propagated though the wind involves calculating the locations of
these surfaces in the wind. A photon packet of frequency  will enter resonance with a
line with rest frequency lu at a location in in the wind where the local velocity v is such
 = lu(1
). (4.35)
At this point, the optical depth associated with the line is calculated via the equation
nl  nu
lu |dv/ds|
, (4.36)
where |dv/ds| is the velocity gradient through the Sobolev surface. The level populations
nu and nl are calculated using Equation 4.29.
The procedure for computing the path of a photon through a cell is therefore one of
calculating the distance to the next Sobolev surface at which the photon may undergo
line scattering. The scattering optical depth due to electron scattering along this path
is calculated. If the total scattering optical depth exceeds T before the packet reaches
70 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
the next Sobolev surface, than the packet scatters via electron scattering. Otherwise,
the scattering optical depth associated with the line is calculated and added to the total
scattering optical depth. If this combined electron and line scattering opacity exceeds
scat, then the photon scatters from that line. If not the process is repeated until the
photon does scatter by a different line, via electron scattering, or is absorbed completely
by the wind due to its weight being reduced to zero.
Application of the Sobolev approximation requires that the macroscopic velocity gradient
(|dv/ds|) along the photons flight path is much greater than the thermal velocity of
the gas divided by the typical length scale over which interactions occur (vth/l). If
this requirement is met the Sobolev surfaces can be correctly assumed to be physically
distinct. A second requirement is that the physical conditions of the gas (temperature,
ionization state etc.) do not change on the scale of the Sobolev length, ls, defined by
dv/ds
. (4.37)
Physically, the Sobolev length represents the depth of a Sobolev surface. This interpre-
tation comes about because the thermal broadening of the line profile in velocity space
translates into a distance in this formalism. In our case, these requirements are usually
well satisfied.
4.4.3 Continuum Opacity
Once the location where a photon packet scatters has been calculated, the continuum
opacity along the last path segment is used to take account of attenuation through
reduction in the weight of the photon packet. The energy lost contributes to the heating
of the cell. Bound-free and free-free processes are both treated in python as sources of
continuum opacity; the details of how they are implemented in python is discussed in
the next two sections.
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 71
4.4.3.1 Bound-free opacity
The bound-free absorption coefficient is given by
bf = ni,l
(i,l)
, (4.38)
where ni,l is the number of density of level l of ion i, and 
(i,l)
is the photoionization cross
section of that ion/level. The total bound-free opacity to a photon packet of frequency 
is therefore simply a summation over all ions in the wind cell. Excited levels are included
in the calculation, and the requisite level populations are again calculated using Equation
4.15, as for the free-bound calculation.
4.4.3.2 Free-free opacity
The free-free absorption coefficient is calculated from the free-free emission given in
Equation 4.11 via Kirchoffs law,
= B(T ). (4.39)
This states that material at temperature T in (local) thermodynamic equilibrium with
its surroundings must re-radiate absorbed energy with a frequency distribution which
maintains a blackbody radiation field. We can therefore write
ff = neni

4.4.4 Attenuation and scattering
The photon packet passes through the cell until the total optical depth to scattering
along its path is equal to the random optical depth, T , generated at the start of this
path segment. The total absorption optical depth along the path segment is then simply
the sum of both continuum absorption coefficients multiplied by the path length. This
72 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
summation yields the absorption optical depth,
abs = 
 ds+ 
 ds. (4.41)
The photon weight just before it scatters, wabs, is given by
wabs = wine
abs . (4.42)
If the packets path ends on a line resonance, then the new direction of the photon can
be chosen from an isotropic distribution or via the escape probability formalism given
in Equation 4.25. As discussed earlier, line scattering is not a purely elastic process,
since there is a chance that the excited ion will de-excite via a collisional process rather
than a radiative one. This means that the photon packet should lose a proportion of
its energy during the scattering process. We have already calculated the proportion of
photons that are absorbed (as opposed to scattered) in a line interaction. This is given
by q (Equation 4.20) or Q (Equation 4.26), if we want to take account of line trapping.
Thus the energy lost from the photon packet is given by Qwabs, and so the new photon
packet weight wout is given by
wout = (1Q)wabs. (4.43)
The alternative to line scattering is electron scattering. In this case, the photon packet
is scattered in a direction chosen from an isotropic distribution, and its weight is not
reduced. A new random optical depth, T , is now calculated, and the next path length
calculated. This procedure is repeated until the photon leaves the wind.
4.4.5 Radiation estimators
Several parts of the method, most notably the ionization scheme, require a model of the
specific intensity of radiation in the cell. As mentioned earlier, in the original version of
python this is assumed to take the form of a dilute blackbody, defined by a dilution
factor, W , and radiation temperature, Tr. In order to calculate these parameters, two
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 73
radiation estimators are logged during the photon transport phase of the simulation.
These estimators are the frequency-averaged mean intensity, J , and the mean frequency
of photon packets,  :
paths
waveds, (4.44)
pathswaveds
pathswaveds
, (4.45)
where wave is the average packet weight along each path segment,
wave = (wabs  win) /abs. (4.46)
W and Tr are then calculated from these radiation estimators by comparison with the
values expected from a blackbody (Mazzali and Lucy 1993):
3.832 k (4.47)
T 4r
. (4.48)
4.5 Heating and cooling balance
Once a population of photon packets has passed through the wind, python calculates
an updated estimate of the cell electron temperature. This is done by assuming that
cells should be in thermal equilibrium, with the heating rate equal to the cooling rate.
The heating rate is calculated from the weight loss of photon packets passing through
the cell. It is therefore a fixed quantity for a given ionization cycle. The cooling rate
is expressed as a function of temperature, and so the new temperature for the cell is
calculated by finding the temperature, T , where
processes
processes
C(T ). (4.49)
74 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
This approach would directly yield an answer for the cell temperature if the heating rate
was temperature independent, and the cooling rate was simply a function of temperature.
However, both the heating and cooling rates are complex functions of not only the
temperature, but also the ionization state of the gas. This dependency means that an
iterative process is required, where the temperature is updated after each ionization cycle
and used to calculate an updated ionization state, giving a different heating rate in the
next cycle.
In order to guard against instabilities, the temperature of a cell is only allowed to change
by a fixed fraction of its current value after each ionization cycle. As the temperature
converges, and the cooling rate approaches the heating rate, this fraction is reduced. A
simulation is considered converged once most cells have reached a fixed temperature.
The details of the heating and cooling mechanisms are discussed in the next two sections.
4.5.1 Heating processes
Heating in a cell occurs when a photon packet loses weight due to one of the processes
described in the previous section. In this section, a few of the details associated with
calculating the heating rates are discussed.
Electron scattering events are treated as elastic, so the only continuum opacities that
remove energy from a photon packet are free-free and bound-free. All of the energy a
photon packet loses to free-free opacity is transferred directly to the electron pool, so the
total free-free heating rate is given by
Hff = win
1 eabs
)  ff
. (4.50)
In contrast, if a photon is absorbed via bound-free opacity, a proportion of the photons
energy is lost in overcoming the binding energy of the electron. The balance ends up as
the kinetic energy of the liberated electron, i.e. it represents the heating of the electron
pool. Therefore the heating rate due to bound-free absorption is given by
Hbf = win
1 eabs
)  bf
1 t
, (4.51)
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 75
where t is the ionization threshold frequency.
The photon packet can also lose energy via collisional de-excitation in line interactions.
The total heating rate due to this process is given by
H lines =
lines
wabs  wout (4.52)
lines
wabs  (Q)wabs (4.53)
lines
(1Q)wabs, (4.54)
where wabs is the weight of the photon packet following true absorption, prior to the
scattering event.
4.5.2 Cooling processes
The wind is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium, and python searches for a tempera-
ture which balances heating and cooling processes after each cycle of photon packet prop-
agation. Three of the cooling processes, free-free, free-bound and lines have already been
described in the context of photon emission from the wind. The total cooling effect due
to each of these three processes is calculated by integrating the frequency-dependent lu-
minosities associated with each process for a range of temperatures, thereby constructing
temperature-dependent cooling rates. For example, the temperature-dependent cooling
rate due to the free-free process is calculated as
Cff (T ) =
Lff (, T )d. (4.55)
In an outflowing wind with diverging streamlines, the density of the gas drops as it moves
outwards. Since, in the sort of wind we typically model, the bulk velocity of the wind
is much higher than the thermal velocity of the gas within it, this will cause adiabatic
(expansion) cooling. This mechanism is included in the code as a non-radiative cooling
mechanism and is given by
Cad = P
, (4.56)
76 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
where P is the pressure and dV/dt is the rate of change in the volume of a co-moving
parcel of gas in a given cell. The pressure is assumed to be dominated by free electrons,
so, for a temperature T , we have P = nekT . In our model, each cell has a fixed volume,
but the effective expansion rate can be written as V (.v), where the divergence of the
velocity, .v, of the cell is calculated by summing the partial velocity gradients along
the three axes at the centre of the cell. Thus we have
Cad(T ) = nekBTV (.v). (4.57)
4.6 Ionization equilibrium calculation (dilute blackbody ap-
proximation)
The original version of python used a highly simplified but computationally efficient
approach to calculating the ionization state of a wind cell. This was based on the modified
Saha approach first suggested by Mazzali and Lucy (1993) and can be summarised by
ni+1ne
= W [ +W (1 )]
)1/2(
ni+1ne
. (4.58)
This equation is derived in section 5.3.1, where the derivation is used to introduce the
more flexible scheme now implemented in python. The left hand side of the equation
is the ratio of the number density of two adjacent ionization stages of an element, mul-
tiplied by the electron number density. The starred term on the right is the same ratio,
calculated in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) via the Saha equation. W and Tr
are the parameters of the dilute blackbody used to model the mean specific intensity in
the cell (see Equation 4.6). Finally,  is the ratio of recombinations going directly to the
ground state relative to the number of recombinations going to all states.
Since this equation only links pairs of ionization levels, the calculation of the complete
ionization state proceeds via an iterative process. First, an initial estimate of ne is
made. The number density of each neutral ion is set to 1, and then the population
of each subsequent state is calculated relative to this. The number densities of ions of
different elements are then rescaled to take account of the relative abundances, and then
Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer 77
the electron density ne is recalculated. This new value of ne is then used for a second
calculation, and the process continues until ne converges.
At this point, we have a new estimate of Te and a new ionization state for the wind. This
is the end of an ionization cycle. If the wind has converged in Te, then the ionization and
temperature structure of the wind is frozen, and synthetic spectra may be calculated.
If more ionization cycles are needed to produce convergence, then a new population of
photon packets are generated and another ionization cycle begins.
4.7 Synthetic spectra
In python, synthetic spectra can be generated at a series of user defined sightlines. The
calculation proceeds via a sequence of spectral cycles, which are similar to ionization
cycles, but with two main differences. Firstly, the frequency range over which photons are
produced is normally much reduced. In the ionization cycles, it is important to produce
enough photons to ensure that all applicable heating and cooling mechanisms for the
wind can be properly modelled. It is also important that the range of frequencies is large
enough to allow a good estimate of the mean intensity in the cell to be calculated. As
we will see later, this is even more critical in the case of the modified version of python
presented in the next chapter. However, since the thermal and ionization state of the
wind is fixed for the spectral cycles, it is not necessary to carry out these calculations.
Secondly, whenever a photon packet scatters in the wind, the optical depth from the
scattering location to the edge of the wind along all requested sightlines is calculated
in addition to the normal scattering calculation. Normally, the photon packet would
scatter in a random direction. However, in this case, the photon is split into as many
parts as there are sightlines, each weighted according to the chance it would have gone in
that direction (thus preserving the total luminosity). The remains of the original packet
proceed as normal, but each of the extracted packets is added to the spectrum in the
given sightline, attenuated by the optical depth in that direction.
The final spectrum is calculated by summing the weights of the extracted photon packets
for each sightline in a set of frequency bins. If the extraction technique is not used, then a
78 Chapter 4 Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
spectrum at a given sightline is made by summing photon packets leaving the simulation
in a small range of angles around that sightline. Clearly in this case many, if not most,
of the photon packets will not happen to leave at the right angles, and so will be wasted.
This illustrates the efficiency of the extraction algorithm.
The specific luminosity in a given frequency bin is the sum of all photon packet weights,
divided by the width of the bin,
+/2
/2
w/. (4.59)
The observed monochromatic flux for any given observer distance d is then simply cal-
culated by dividing by the surface area of a sphere,
. (4.60)
Reducing the frequency range over which photon packets are produced in the spectral
cycle increases the number of photons in each frequency bin, and so improves the signal-
to-noise ratio of the resultant spectra. The extraction process does the same thing, since
every photon contributes at least once to each spectrum.

Radiative transfer and ionization
calculations in AGN
5.1 Introduction
Chapter 4 introduced the original version of python, our radiative transfer and ioniza-
tion code. It was written the enable the modelling of disk winds in CVs, and the physics
included in the code reflect this. This project, however, seeks to understand disk winds in
AGN, where different physical processes can become important. In this chapter, we will
discuss the additional physics we have sought to model in python to allow meaningful
simulations of AGN, and present the results of some test calculations.
5.2 X-ray source
Figure 5.1 shows a collection of quasar spectral energy distributions. This shows that a
type 1 quasar spectrum consists of several parts. The optical/UV part of the spectrum is
generally believed to arise from an optically thick accretion disk and is therefore already
modelled reasonably appropriately in python. However, the X-ray part of the spectrum
arises from a different source, and given the lack of consensus as to the physical origin
of this component, we do not try and model it in a self-consistent manner. Instead, we
80 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
Figure 5.1: Collection of type 1 quasar spectral energy distributions (Richards
et al. 2006).
include it as a separate radiation source, with an SED parameterised by a photon power
law index, x, and the integrated luminosity from 2-10 keV.
Despite the fact that the detailed geometry of the X-ray source is not known, it is
still important to choose a physically motivated location for it. A popular explanation
for the production of AGN X-rays is Compton up-scattering of disk photons by a hot
corona. This picture suggests that the X-ray source should be close to the location of
high frequency seed photons, i.e. the inner part of the accretion disk. This is backed up
by recent reverberation measurements, which show that the X-ray source is located only
about 4RG above the accretion disk (Emmanoulopoulos et al. 2014). Other possibilities
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 81
are the base of a radio jet, or perhaps a spherically symmetrical accretion flow at the
centre of the accretion disk (Meyer et al. 2000).
Based upon these considerations, we choose a simple source geometry - a centrally located
spherical source with radius set equal to the innermost radius of the accretion disk. It
radiates isotropically, with no limb-darkening.
5.3 Ionization balance
Disk winds are generally thought to be photoionized, and therefore accurate calculation
of the ionization state of the wind requires accurate modelling of the local mean intensity.
The ionization calculation in the original version of python makes the assumption that
the SED is well approximated by a dilute blackbody. However, with the addition of the
X-ray source described above, this will no longer be the case. Additionally, absorption in
the wind can strongly modify the SED seen in a cell, and the original scheme could only
treat this very approximately. Following Sim et al. (2008), we have therefore extended
the original scheme to work for an arbitrary SED. It is instructive to examine the physical
basis of the original scheme before describing our upgraded method.
5.3.1 Derivation of the approximate ionization scheme
The approximate ionization scheme used in python originally is based upon calculat-
ing LTE abundances using the Saha equation and then applying correction factors to
take account of the true photoionization and recombination rates. It has already been
summarised in Chapter 4 (Equation 4.58).
The Saha equation links the relative number of ions in two successive stages of ionization
and is derived by noting that, in LTE, collisional processes dominate, and so free electrons
and ions are in statistical equilibrium. The ratio of the number densities in any two states
is then simply set by statistical and quantum mechanical arguments. A version for two
82 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
successive ions, both in the ground state, is
ni+1,0n
ni,0
gegi+1,0
2mekT
i,0,0
. (5.1)
In this equation, ni,0 and n
i+1,0 are the number densities of ions in ionization state i
and i + 1, whilst ne is the number density of electrons. The star in the superscript
reminds us that these densities are calculated in LTE, and the zero in the subscript
shows that the equation refers only to the ground state of the ions in question. In the
following derivation, we replace the ratio on the left hand side of the equation with the
symbol i,0,0(T ). The first term on the right hand side is the ratio of the ground state
multiplicities of the two ions, and the electron multiplicity. T is the temperature, and
i,0,0 is the ionization potential.
In a typical nebula it is unlikely that LTE will hold, because the densities are too low
for collisional processes to dominate. However, if the overall ionization state is in equi-
librium, the number of ionizations from ion i per unit time must equal the number of
recombinations back into i. Thus we can write
ii+n = ni+1ne
i+1i, (5.2)
where the left hand side is a summation over all ionizing processes with rate coefficients
, and the right hand side is a summation over all recombination processes with rate
coefficients . Note that ionizations do not necessarily only increase the charge of an ion
by one, hence the i + n in the subscript of the ionization rate coefficient, where n = 1
or more. In LTE, we can apply the principle of detailed balance - that is the rate of
each process is the same is that of its inverse. Choosing photoionization and radiative
recombination, we can therefore write
ni,0
i,0i+1,0 = n
i+1,0n
i+1,0i,0 (5.3)
where pi,0i+1,0 is the photoionisation rate coefficient, and 
i+1,0i,0 is the radiative
recombination rate coefficient, both linking the ground states of successive ionization
stages. These rates are starred to remind us that they refer to LTE. The recombination
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 83
rate coefficient is for a Boltzmann distribution of electron velocities at temperature T,
and the photoionization rate coefficient is for a Planck distribution of photon energies at
the same temperature. Rearranging we see that
ni+1,0n
ni,0
i,0i+1,0
ri+1,0i,0
= 0,0,i(T ). (5.4)
Even if we are not in LTE, we can make the same simplification to Equation 5.2 as
long as photoionization and radiative recombination are the dominant processes. This
is reasonable in a low density radiation dominated plasma. We can therefore write
ni+1,0ne
i,0i+1,0
ri+1,0i,0
, (5.5)
where we now have the densities we are interested in in terms of the actual photoioniza-
tion and recombination rates. Multiplying top and bottom of Equation 5.5 by the LTE
rate coefficients, we can write
ni+1,0ne
ii+1
ri+1i
i,0i+1,0
ri+1,0i,0
ri+1,0i,0
i,0i+1,0
= 0,0,i(T )
ii+1
i,0i+1,0
ri+1,0i,0
ri+1,0i,0
. (5.6)
The first term on the right hand side of Equation 5.6 is the LTE abundance ratio from
the Saha equation, the second term is the actual photoionization rate coefficient divided
by the LTE rate coefficient, and the last term is the LTE radiative recombination rate
coefficient divided by the actual coefficient. These last two are our correction factors.
Let us deal with them in turn.
To work out the photoionization correction factor, we start by writing an equation for
the photoionization rate p. It is simply the number of photons of sufficient energy to
cause an ionisation multiplied by the ionisation cross section. The energy flux E in the
frequency range d is
E = 4Jd (5.7)
where J is the mean specific intensity. Therefore, the energy absorbed by a given ion
84 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
is the flux multiplied by the cross section of the ion pi,0(). Therefore E
 , the energy
absorbed by the ion per unit time is
Eabs = 4J
i,0()d. (5.8)
The photoionization rate coefficient is the number of ionizations per unit time, and so we
must divide by the energy of a photon, and integrate over all ionizing photons to obtain
an expression for pi,0i+1,0, viz
i,0i+1,0 = 4
i,0()
d. (5.9)
In LTE, the mean specific intensity is, by definition, a blackbody, so J = B(T ), yielding
i,0i+1,0 = 4
B(T )
i,0()
d. (5.10)
Thus, the photoionization rate correction factor, Si,0,0, is
Si,0,0 =
i,0i+1,0
ii+1,0
i,0()
1d
B(T )
i,0()
(5.11)
The recombination rate correction factor is more simple. To first order the recombina-
tion rate coefficient is inversely proportional to the square root of the temperature of
electrons. Furthermore, even if we are not in LTE, it is a reasonable approximation to
say that the electrons still follow a Boltzmann distribution. This is because the typical
timescale of electron-electron interactions is much shorter than the typical timescale of
photoionizations. Thus any electrons produced by photoionization will very quickly in-
teract with the electron pool and reach equilibrium. This means that the only difference
between the LTE recombination rate and the true recombination rate will be due to
differences in electron temperature. If electrons in our plasma have temperature Te, and
T is the temperature at which we calculate the LTE abundance ratio, the recombination
rate correction factor is
ri+1,0i,0
ri+1,0i,0
(5.12)
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 85
Replacing the correction factors in Equation 5.6 with equations 5.11 and 5.12, we obtain
the fundamental equation for this approximate ionization method
ni+1,0ne
= 0,0,i(T )Si,0,0
. (5.13)
In the simple case where the mean intensity can be approximated by a dilute blackbody
with radiation temperature Tr, we can write J = WB(Tr). If we calculate the Saha
abundances at temperature Tr, the approximate ionization equation simplifies to
ni+1,0ne
= 0,0,i(Tr)
WB(Tr)
i,0()
1d
B(Tr)
i,0()
0,0,i(Tr), (5.14)
which is the basic form of Equation 4.58, the scheme that was implemented in the
version of python prior to this project. The extra factor of [ +W (1 + )] is a further
correction which takes account of recombinations to levels other than the ground state
and photoionizations from excited levels. This factor is discussed in the next section.
5.3.2 Correction factor for recombination to excited levels
In the derivation above, we have assumed that all photoionizations are from the ground
state, and all recombinations are to the ground state. The first assumption is very
commonly used in RT calculations of low density gas clouds and is known as the nebular
approximation. The argument is that the typical timescale for radiative de-excitation of
an ion in an excited state to the ground state is much less than the typical time between
photoionization events.
The second assumption is not as sound, however, since excited states are available to
all electrons during recombination, and so the cross section of the ion to electrons is
larger than one would expect from the ground state alone. Fortunately it is easy to
come up with a correction factor. We start by rewriting Equation 5.2 to incorporate
86 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
recombinations to all excited levels l of ionization state i
ni+1,0ne
i,0i+1,0
i+1,0i,l
. (5.15)
Multiplying top and bottom by the recombination rate to the ground-state only and
rearranging gives
ni+1,0ne
i,0i+1,0
ri+1,0i,0
ri+1,0i,0
i+1,0i,l
. (5.16)
The second term is now a correction factor which is the ratio of recombinations going to
the ground-state only to all recombinations. We represent this correction factor with the
symbol (T ). The rest of the derivation of the approximate ionization equation proceeds
as in the previous section, apart from a factor of (Te), where  is calculated at the
electron temperature Te, a suitable choice for recombination processes. Thus we obtain
ni+1,0ne
= W(T )
0,0,i(Tr). (5.17)
This represents the first stage of modifications to Equation 5.14. However, following
Mazzali and Lucy (1993), python includes further correction factors which take account
of photoionizations from excited levels. However, these arguments are based upon the
assumption that the mean intensity is well modelled by a dilute blackbody. Since this
is not the case in our AGN models, we do not use these extra correction factors in the
new ionization scheme described below. Therefore the derivations of these extra factors
are not included here.
The recombination rate coefficients used to calculate (T ) are generated in one of two
ways. Ideally, we use tabulated values of the total recombination rate and the ground
state resolved rate from the chianti database (Dere et al. 1997). If these are not
available, we calculate the rate coefficients from the photoionization rate coefficients via
the Milne relation. Figure 5.2 shows the values of (T ) calculated for the ionic states of
carbon.

5.3.3 Approximate ionization calculations for an arbitrary SED
The approximate ionization scheme derived above is implemented in python in the
dilute blackbody form, which is computationally very fast and accurate in the limit
where the sources of radiation in the model are thermal. For the AGN simulations
proposed in this project, there are strongly non-thermal sources of ionizing radiation,
and early testing revealed that this particular implementation did not give an accurate
representation of the ionization state in this case.
Fortunately, there is a simple way to increase the flexibility of the scheme to take account
of any SED. Instead of assuming J = WB in Equation 5.11, the photoionization rate
correction factor can be evaluated by direct numerical integration of the SEDs in the
numerator and denominator. The denominator is simply an integral of the photoioniza-
tion cross-section multiplied by a Planck function with the same temperature as that
used to calculate the LTE abundances from the Saha equation. The numerator is an
integral of the cross section multiplied by the mean intensity actually seen in the cell.
This calculation therefore requires a model of the mean intensity. This modelling is the
most complex element in the new ionization scheme and is described next.
88 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
5.3.3.1 Modelling the mean intensity
In the original version of python, the mean intensity is assumed to be a dilute blackbody,
but the new implementation discussed above requires a more flexible model of the mean
intensity in a cell as a function of frequency. We first split the full frequency range up
into a series of bands. In each band, j, the mean intensity can be represented by a power
law of the form
J,j = Kpl,j
pl,j , (5.18)
or an exponential
J,j = Kexp,je
(h/kTexp,j). (5.19)
The parameters defining the two models are the two normalisation factors, Kpl,j and
Kexp,j , the power law spectral index, pl,j , and the exponential temperature, Texp,j . The
exponential representation is parameterised in a way that is meant to ensure that the
temperature has physical meaning, i.e. in the case of a thermal source of photons it can
be compared to the known radiation temperature to check for consistency.
The SED parameters are calculated using three estimators of the radiation field in the cell,
which are logged during the propagation of photon packets. These three estimators are:
the mean frequency of photon packets, j , the frequency integrated mean intensity, Jj ,
and the standard deviation of the frequency, ,j . These estimators are collected in each
of the bands used to model the spectrum, each covering a frequency band min  max.
Jj and j are just band limited versions of the estimators collected in the original
version of python, but all three are given below for completeness:

Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 89
where wave is the mean weight of a photon packet with frequency between the band
limits, over a path segment of length ds. In the rest of this section, the subscript j is
dropped for clarity, but all calculations are assumed to be carried out using band-limited
values. Similarly, integrals are always over the range of frequencies in the band.
Once the estimators have been calculated following a flight of photons, they are used to
compute values for the spectral model parameters. We first calculate the mean frequency
from the mean intensity
mod =
Jd
. (5.23)
We can then substitute the two different spectral model expressions for J , which allows
Equation 5.23 to be solved for two estimates of the mean frequency. For the power law
representation we obtain
mod =
(pl + 1)(
pl+2
max  
pl+2
min )
(pl + 2)(
pl+1
max  
pl+1
min )
, (5.24)
and for the exponential, setting x = h/kTexp, we find
mod =
(xmax  1)exmax  (xmin  1)exmin
exmax  exmin . (5.25)
We then find a value for pl and Texp by numerically solving the equation   mod = 0.
It is then straightforward to use the measured frequency-integrated mean intensity to
calculate the normalisation factors Kpl and Kexp via
 max
Jd. (5.26)
At this point, we have two potential models for the mean intensity in the cell. In order
to choose between them, we calculate the standard deviation of the frequency for each
model,
,mod =
2Jd
 mod (5.27)
and compare this to the estimator. We choose the model which yields the best match.
Once we have a series of models for J , the numerator in the photoionization rate cor-
rection factor (Equation 5.11) can be evaluated as a sum of integrals over each band

we focus on just three cells to illustrate the spectral models.

Figure 5.3: Three examples of modelled cell spectra.
The top panel is for a cell exposed directly to the illuminating SED, and we see that
the model reproduces the mean intensity very well. The step between the end of the
exponential model chosen for the Wien tail of the disk and the power law model at
higher frequencies highlights the fact that we do not enforce continuity across band
boundaries.
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 91
In the middle panel, the cell is in the bulk of the wind, and bound-free absorption has
caused a reduction in the mean intensity between 3 1016 and 1018 Hz. Once more, the
model follows J very well. The cell represented by the final panel is deep within the
wind, and the bound-free absorption is consequently much greater. No photon packets
at all have survived between 3 1016 and 3 1018 Hz, and it is situations like this which
potentially cause the biggest problems when trying to model J . Our approach is to
change min and max for any band which does not see photons across the whole band to
reflect the range of frequencies that it does see. We then fit a model to this reduced band,
and only carry out the integrals for photoionization rate coefficients over that reduced
frequency range. The model fitted to the SED in the bottom panel is truncated at the
edges of the absorption feature and fits the SED fairly well. Clearly, this scheme has
limitations. For example, if there are multiple deep absorption features in a given band,
they will be hard to model. However, bound-free is the main absorption process in the
winds we model and this tends to give very broad features like those in Figure 5.3.
5.3.3.2 The variable temperature scheme
The model of mean intensity allows us to calculate the numerator of the photoioniza-
tion rate correction factor Si,0,0 (Equation 5.11) more accurately than with the dilute
blackbody formulation. However, we still need to calculate the denominator, which is
the integral of a blackbody multiplied by the frequency-dependent photoionization cross
section for the lower ion. The temperature of the blackbody is the same as that at which
the Saha equation is evaluated, and this can lead to computational issues.
In order to overcome these issues, we note that there is actually nothing in the ap-
proximate ionization scheme which tells us at which temperature to calculate the Saha
equation. Previous choices have been made for reasons of computational efficiency. In
the original scheme, evaluating the Saha equation at the radiation temperature of the
dilute blackbody removes the requirement to carry out an integral for the denominator
- a significant computational saving. Therefore, in this case the choice is obvious.
However, in the new formulation, we always have to calculate the integral in the denomi-
nator, so we have a free hand in selecting the temperature at which to calculate the Saha
92 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
equation. One choice might be to evaluate it at Te, since this would remove the need
to correct for the recombination rate (the square root term in Equation 5.14). However,
with a significant population of X-ray photons contributing to J , we would expect non-
zero populations of highly ionized ions. If the temperature at which the LTE abundances
are calculated is too low, the photoionization threshold of the more highly ionized ions
will be significantly past the peak of the blackbody spectrum at that temperature. Thus,
the integral in the denominator can become very small - quickly approaching machine
accuracy. At this point, the scheme becomes unstable.
Equation 5.4 suggests a good choice of temperature. It shows that the photoionization
rate divided by the recombination rate (both calculated in LTE) is equal to ni+1ne/ni.
The integral in the denominator of equation 5.11 is also the LTE photoionization rate.
Equation 5.4 shows that this must be non-zero if ni+1ne/ni is non-zero. We can therefore
calculate a reasonable temperature for the Saha equation and hence the temperature of
the blackbody in the denominator of Equation 5.11 by numerically solving Equation 5.1
to find the temperature where ni+1ne/ni = 1.
5.3.4 Additional ionization and recombination processes
Whilst photoionization and radiative recombination are the dominant processes which set
the ionization state of a diffuse, radiation dominated plasma such as is expected around
an AGN, there are other processes that can have an influence. As it stands, the new
ionization scheme described above can incorporate other processes which link adjacent
ionization states of a given ion. Ionization processes would simply become additive terms
in the numerator of the photoionization rate correction factor (Equation 5.11), whilst
recombination processes would appear in the denominator of the  term which would
become
(T ) =
ri+1,0i,0
i+1,0i,l + 
x + y + ...
(5.29)
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 93
where the x,y terms represent the recombination rate coefficients for additional pro-
cesses. The rest of this section describes some of the additional ionization and recombi-
nation processes that could be considered for inclusion in python, starting with dielec-
tronic recombination (DR), which has already been included via this method.
5.3.4.1 Dielectronic recombination
In this process, a free electron is captured by an ion, but instead of releasing a photon
immediately, excess energy carried by the electron goes into exciting one of the exist-
ing electrons. This differs from normal radiative recombination in that it is a resonant
process. The cross-section of the ion to electrons is strongly peaked at energies corre-
sponding to the energy difference between different electron orbitals in the ion. Once
in the excited state, the ion can decay in one of two ways. First, it can undergo auto-
ionization, where one of the electrons is re-emitted. Thus the ion ends up in the same
state as before the event. Clearly this outcome will not affect the ionization state of the
The second outcome is that the ion relaxes via the emission of a photon, and the ion
remains in the less ionized state. This second process is of interest in the ionization
balance. As a proof of concept, we have implemented this process into the ionization
scheme as an extra additive term in the denominator of (T ) using DR rate coefficients
from the chianti database. Figure 5.4 shows how (T ) is modified by this additional
process. The solid lines are the new values, with the original values also plotted as dashed
lines. We see that the recombination rate for C vii is unchanged. This is simply because
there are no electrons in the bare ion to take part in the process. DR is only important
for C vi and C v above a temperature of about 106 K. The recombination rate for the
lithium-like C iv is most affected by DR.
5.3.4.2 Auger Ionization
Auger Ionization is the inverse process of DR, i.e. it corresponds to a high energy
photon causing an inner-shell electron to be ejected from the ion. This leaves the ion

in an excited state, and there is a second process of relaxation where an outer electron
de-excites into the gap left by the electron initially removed. This causes emission of
an energetic photon, or possibly an auto ionization event whereby an outer electron is
ejected leaving the ion two stages more ionized. This is a significantly more complex
process to implement in our scheme, since it couples non-adjacent ionization states. We
have therefore not implemented it as yet. In section 5.3.5, we will consider its importance
in the ionization balance of carbon, and in section 8.2.1.3, we will discuss a strategy for
possible future implementation.
5.3.4.3 Charge Exchange
In the process of charge exchange, an electron is passed between two interacting ions.
Clearly, if the two ions belong to same species, this leaves the net ionization state un-
changed. However, this process can also occur between different species. An important
example is Oi/ii and Hi/ii. This is a particularly favourable interaction, because the
ionization potential of both neutral species is around 13.6 eV. Again, this is a difficult
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 95
process to implement in the current scheme, since it cross-connects ions of different
elements. Nevertheless, the scheme outlined in section 8.2.1.3 would also work for this
process.
5.3.4.4 Three-body recombination
Three-body recombination is a recombination process where two electrons interact near
an ion, leaving one to recombine and the other to carry away the excess energy. This
process is only important in relatively high density plasmas, since the rate scales as n2e.
We have therefore not attempted to include it in the current project.
5.3.4.5 Supra-thermal electron ionization
In a plasma that is illuminated by a flux of very high energy photons, photoionization can
release very high energy electrons. These will thermalise fairly quickly, however, during
this process they can take part in collisional ionization of other ions in the plasma.
This may well be an important process, particularly in locations where photoionization
absorption heavily attenuates the far UV/soft X-ray flux. In order to properly include
this process, we would need to include a model of the electron energy distribution in
each cell. This is beyond the scope of the work presented here.
5.3.4.6 Unresolved transition array (UTA) ionization
UTA ionization takes place when one of the inner shell lines of iron with an open M
shell (Fe i - Fe xvi) is excited by a soft X-ray photon. An n=2 electron is excited to
the n=3 level and, upon relaxation, there is sufficient energy for autoionization to take
place. These lines form a broad, unresolved feature in the soft X-ray spectra of AGN
(Behar et al. 2001). Implementation of this mechanism requires a multi-level model of
the iron atom, which is a task beyond this project.
96 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
5.3.5 Validation of ionization scheme
In order to test our new ionization scheme, several validation exercises were carried out in
which we compared the ionization state of a simple spherical shell model calculated with
python to that predicted by the widely used photoionization code cloudy (Ferland
et al. 2013). The geometry used was a shell of depth 1 cm and radius 1011 cm. This
ensures that the plasma is optically thin, thereby allowing testing of the ionization scheme
in isolation. The hydrogen density was set to n(H) = 107 cm3. For the cloudy runs,
the illuminating spectrum was set using the command
Table power law spectral index -0.9 low=0.01, hi=1470,
which produces a broken power law spectrum with spectral index  = 0.9 between
0.01 Rydbergs and 1470 Rydbergs. It is characterised by  = 5/2 for low frequencies
and  = 2.0 at high frequencies. This spectrum is not intended to replicate any
astrophysical object, but is convenient to use because it can be defined identically in
both codes. The overall luminosity is set in cloudy via the ionization parameter
command. cloudy uses the U definition of ionization parameter (Equation 1.3). Thus
the luminosity is set indirectly by requiring a given ionization parameter at the inner
edge of the cloud. This spectrum is illustrated in Figure 5.5. The noise in some parts of
the python spectrum is due to the limited number of photon packets produced at the
low flux end of each photon generation band.
In python a new mode was written in order to precisely replicate both the spherical shell
geometry and the broken power law SED. We use the photon packets passing through a
cell to compute the ionization parameter via
cV n(H)
h13.6eV
waveds
, (5.30)
where wave is the average photon packet weight along a path length ds in a cell of volume
V . The summation gives a number of photons, which, when divided by the cell volume,
gives a photon density. For these runs we fixed the plasma temperature in both codes
at 10 000 K, i.e. we only test ionization, not thermal equilibrium.

Figure 5.5: The flux incident on the inner edge of the thin shell model used to
compare the ionization state from python and cloudy. This is for ionization
parameter U = 1.
Figure 5.6 shows the predicted relative abundances for ionic species of hydrogen, helium,
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. We see that there is excellent agreement for hydrogen
and helium, but there are differences for the other three elements. It is instructive to
investigate the reason for these differences, since this informs future work to extend the
number of ionization and recombination processes implemented in python.
We will take carbon as an example, and begin by plotting the ratio of the number density
of adjacent states, rather than simply the relative abundances. This directly allows us to
understand which pair of states are to blame for any discrepancy. This plot is presented
in Figure 5.7. It is immediately apparent that there is an offset between the two codes
for the ratio of n(C ii)/n(C i), and this is down to a difference in the photoionization
cross section data used in the two codes. cloudy uses cross sections taken from Verner
et al. (1996a) (hereafter referred to as VFKY), whereas python uses cross sections taken
from TOPBASE (Cunto et al. 1993) for H, He, C, N, O and Fe. The TOPBASE data
includes data for inner shell photoionization edges and is easily extrapolated to very high
frequencies, where even small cross sections can be important. However, there is a slight
discrepancy between the two data sets for the exact threshold frequency. python also
includes a limited subset of the VFKY data, and Figure 5.8 shows the ratio of number

The C ii/C i ratio is now in good agreement, but we see that python still underestimates
the C iv/C iii ratio. This shows that the C iii photoionization rate is underestimated. In
order to investigate what mechanism is responsible for the remaining differences, we have
turned off a few mechanisms in cloudy. We begin by turning off charge exchange. The

photoionization cross sections and cloudy calculation has charge exchange dis-
abled.
Clearly charge exchange was a significant process, leaving only the C v/C iv ratio in
error. This could be caused by too much C v or too little C iv. Auger effects are
particularly important for lithium-like ions like C iv, since this ion is the one which has
the smallest difference between the ionization potential and the energy required to eject
an inner shell electron. We therefore turn off Auger ionization in cloudy. The results
for carbon are shown in Figure 5.10, and the hunch that Auger ionization was to blame
is confirmed.
Figure 5.11 shows the ion fractions for H, He, C, N and O for VFKY photoionization cross
sections for the python predictions, and with charge exchange and Auger ionization
disabled for cloudy. We now see excellent agreement. Inclusion of these two ionization
mechanisms has not proved possible in the timescale of the research program described
here. Looking back at Figure 5.7, however, we see that for ionization parameters above
around 103, we obtain good agreement with cloudy even without them. We are
always in this regime and we therefore note the important ionization mechanisms for

future implementation, but our ionization calculations are acceptable for use in the type
of radiation fields seen around AGN.
As a final test, we have switched off the dielectronic recombination effect in python to
observe how important it is. Figure 5.12 shows the ratio of number densities of adjacent
carbon ions. Comparing this with Figure 5.4, we see that the ratios between the upper
three ion pairs are unchanged, which is as expected because dielectronic recombination
is not important for these ions at T = 104 K. The largest effect is for C iv ion, and this
is reflected in the significant change in the ratio of that ion to C iii. The excess of C iv
is due to the lower recombination rate when dielectronic recombination is neglected.
Finally, Figures 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 show a comparison between cloudy and python
for iron. In general, even for this very complex element, agreement is reasonable. In
particular python agrees with cloudy for the value of U at which each species is
dominant to within an order of magnitude in most cases. We do very well once we get to
lithium-, helium- and hydrogen-like iron ions. Whilst iron is a very important element
in the X-ray spectrum of AGN, it is much less critical to get abundances of iron ions
exactly right for UV spectra. As long as the heating and cooling effects due to iron are
about right, our treatment should be good enough for the current project.

5.4 Heating and cooling mechanisms
In the original version of python, photons passing through a cell are able to lose energy
through continuum absorption from bound-free and free-free processes. They can also
lose energy when undergoing line scattering. This lost energy goes into heating the cell,
which is then able to cool through free-free, free-bound and line emission, as well as
adiabatic cooling. For the kind of SED seen in AGN, there are additional heating and
cooling processes that set the plasma temperature. It is important to include them if we
wish to obtain correct converged temperatures in such cases. This section describes the
additional processes included in the new version of python.
5.4.1 Compton heating and cooling
At the start of this project, all scattering of photons by electrons in python was dealt
with in the Thompson limit. This approximation is entirely suitable for situations where
the typical photon energy is less than the rest energy of an electron, h  mec2, i.e.
  1.231020 Hz. However, with our inclusion of X-rays into the illuminating spectra,
we now reach photon energies up to 50 keV, representing a frequency of 1.2  1019 Hz,

which is approaching this limit. Unlike Thompson scattering, Compton scattering is not
a purely elastic process, and so removes energy from the photons.
Treatment of an individual Compton scattering event requires consideration of the direc-
tion of the photon and electron before and after the scattering process, taking account
of both energy and momentum conservation. The energy transfer between the electrons
and photons depends on the energy of each, and the change of direction during the inter-
action. However, since we are dealing with a photon packet representing a large number
of photons, interacting with a cell containing electrons with a range of velocities, we
require a statistical treatment.
If one considers a population of electrons with velocities that can be represented by a
Boltzmann distribution, then the mean energy transfer can be calculated by an inte-
gration over all possible angles. For a photon of energy  = h, the mean fractional
energy transfer per scattering event is given (in the non-relativistic limit) by (Rybicki
and Lightman 1979)
4kT  
. (5.31)
A plot of the mean fractional energy change of a photon per interaction is shown in
Figure 5.16.
/ is negative when h > 4kT , which represents a transfer of energy from the photons
to the electrons - this is Compton heating of the gas. This case is plotted in the top
panel of Figure 5.16 and occurs when high energy photons pass through a relatively cool
When low frequency photons pass through a relatively hot gas, the opposite happens,
and we have the inverse Compton effect - the energy of photons is increased by collisions
with hot electrons. This case is shown in the lower panel of Figure 5.16. This is the
process thought to be responsible for the X-ray power law tail seen in the SED of AGN,
where seed photons from the accretion disk are Compton up-scattered by an atmosphere
of hot electrons.

In the new version of python, we include Compton heating as a form of opacity which
removes weight from photon packets during the photon propagation part of a calcula-
tion. It acts as an additional heating mechanism alongside free-free and bound-free (see
Section 4.4.4). Compton cooling is implemented as an additional cooling term in the
heating/cooling calculations (see Section 4.5). The next three subsections describe how
Compton heating and cooling are implemented.
5.4.1.1 Compton heating
The heating component of Equation 5.31 is given by
HEATING
, (5.32)
which represents the mean energy loss from photon to electron in a single interaction.
In python wind heating is calculated during the photon packet transport phase of a
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 109
simulation. The photon packets lose weight to continuum processes along their paths
through the wind, and that lost weight represents a heating input to the wind cells. In
order to calculate how much energy is lost from a photon packet due to this process,
we need to compute the number of interactions that take place along a path segment of
length ds. The differential cross section of an electron to a photon of frequency  is given
by the Klein-Nishina formula. Since we are carrying out an angle-averaged calculation,
we use the angle-averaged Klein-Nishina formula from Rybicki and Lightman (1979)
c() = T .
1 + x
2x(1 + x)
1 + 2x
 ln(1 + 2x)
ln(1 + 2x) +
1 + 3x
(1 + 2x)2
(5.33)
where x = h/mc2. Therefore, a photon packet of frequency  will scatter neC() times
per cm travelled, and since each interaction will change its energy by a factor given by
Equation 5.32, we can write an absorption coefficient for this process:
Comp = nec()
cm1. (5.34)
Equation 4.41 becomes
abs = 
 ds+ 
 ds+ 
 ds, (5.35)
and the weight of a photon packet passing through a given cell is further reduced due to
Compton opacity. The lost weight is an additional heating input into the cell,
HComp = win
1 eabs
) Comp
, (5.36)
where
Comp = Comp ds. (5.37)
Note that this implementation is not strictly physical; in reality, the energy lost from a
photon in such an interaction results in a change in its frequency, whereas we represent
this energy loss as a reduction in the weight of the photon packet, at fixed frequency.
Since we are primarily interested in ions with ionization energies up to a few hundred eV,
110 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
and lines in the UV, this approximation will not significantly affect results. This is be-
cause the fractional frequency shift for relevant photon packets would be much less than
1% per interaction, and we are normally operating in the optically thin regime. Nonethe-
less, we note that the spectrum at frequencies where h approaches mc2 ( > 1019 Hz)
should be treated with caution.
5.4.1.2 Induced Compton heating
In situations where
, (5.38)
induced (or stimulated) Compton heating can also take place. This heating rate is iden-
tical to the Compton heating rate, but with an additional multiplicative term (Cloudy
& associates 2011): the photon occupation number, i(), given by
i() =
. (5.39)
We can therefore write an induced Compton absorption coefficient
ind Comp = i()nec()
. (5.40)
We use the spectral model from the previous ionization cycle to estimate J when calcu-
lating this heating mechanism. The absorption coefficient is included (multiplied by ds)
as a further additive term in Equation 5.35, and the induced Compton heating input is
calculated as for Compton heating. Again, the packet weight is reduced rather than the
frequency and so the same caveat applies here as in Compton heating.
5.4.1.3 Compton cooling
When 4kT > h, the fractional energy change per interaction is positive, and so energy
passes from the electrons to the photons. This process is inverse Compton scattering
which cools the plasma. We therefore include it along with the other cooling terms that
are calculated after each cycle of photon propagation (see section 4.5.2).
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 111
Each interaction results in a fractional energy loss from the plasma of
COOLING
. (5.41)
Taking a ray of intensity I , the energy per solid angle, per unit frequency interval per
second intercepting an electron in the gas is equal to Ic(). Therefore the total energy
lost by this ray is equal to Ic() 4kT/mc2.
The total energy loss by all rays passing through a given cell, with electron number
density ne and volume V is therefore given by
CComp = V ne
Ic()dd. (5.42)
Since this process is only important for low frequency photons, the relevant cross section
is the Thompson cross section, T . The double integral then reduces to 4 times the
frequency-averaged mean intensity J in the cell, which we already log as part of the
spectral modelling. Thus, the Compton cooling rate (CComp) is given by
CComp = 16V TJ
. (5.43)
As with the other cooling mechanisms, this is a function of the electron temperature Te,
and so can be included in the heating and cooling balance calculations.
python generates photon packets to balance free-free, recombination and line cooling.
However, in the case of Compton cooling, it is not so clear how to proceed. Compton
cooling does not generate photons, rather it increases the frequency of photons passing
through the hot plasma - Compton up-scattering. As implemented, the cooling mecha-
nism is calculated after the photon packets have been propagated, so we cannot change
the frequency retrospectively. We therefore neglect Compton cooling as a source of wind
radiation, but note the approximation. In cases where Compton cooling is an important
process, we will likely underestimate the emergent flux at high frequencies.
112 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
5.4.2 Dielectronic recombination cooling
Since we have included dielectronic recombination in the ionization scheme, it should
also be included as a cooling mechanism for consistency. For radiative recombinations,
the recombination rate is calculated from the photoionization cross sections via the Milne
relation. The analogous calculation for dielectronic recombination cooling would be to
carry out an integration of the Auger ionization cross sections, since this is the inverse
process. We have not yet carried out this work, and so we include only a rough estimate
of the dielectronic recombination cooling rate.
The temperature-dependent dielectronic recombination rate coefficient multiplied by the
electron number density and the number density of the recombining ion gives the number
of recombinations per unit volume. As an estimate of the energy removed from the
cell by each recombination, we use the mean electron energy. The total dielectronic
recombination rate in a cell is therefore given by
CDR(T ) = V
ions=i
neni2kTe
i (T ). (5.44)
This approximate treatment allows us to understand the relative importance of this
cooling process, although the current implementation is not fully self-consistent.
Free-free, free-bound and line cooling processes in the wind all produce photons packets
to balance the cooling rate and so maintain the total luminosity of the the system. Since
we do not have the frequency-resolved emissivity (which would come from the Auger
ionization Milne relation), we do not have the data required to generate photon packets
of the correct frequency. We therefore again neglect this process, but note that if dielec-
tronic recombination is a significant cooling mechanism, we could be underestimating
the total luminosity of the wind.
5.4.3 Validation of new heating and cooling mechanisms
As with the ionization calculations, we turn to cloudy as a well tested comparison for
our calculations. We use the same geometry and illuminating spectrum as in Section
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 113
5.3.5, but this time the temperature is solved for as well. We already know that for a
given temperature, python produces a slightly different ionization state from cloudy,
so we limit this effect by disabling Auger ionization, charge exchange and three-body
recombination in the cloudy calculations.
Figure 5.17 shows the results of the comparison, with electron temperature plotted
against ionization parameter on the left hand y-axis. The volumetric heating and cool-
ing rates for the two codes are plotted on the right hand axis - since both successfully
converge, the heating and cooling curves overlie each other. The agreement is excel-

lent, particularly at the extremes, and we can clearly see that both codes converge to a
similar Compton temperature for 2< log(U)< 7. The slight difference in the Compton
temperature is mainly due to differences between the cross sections used in cloudy and
python. The departure from the Compton temperature at very high values of U arises
because (with the simple SED we are using here), the photon occupation number at
low frequencies exceeds that of a blackbody. Thus induced Compton heating becomes
important. The heating rate is proportional to J2 - hence the change in gradient of the
heating curve.
Figure 5.18 shows the heating rate for both codes split by physical mechanism. At low
values of U , the dominant heating mechanism is photoionization, and we agree very
114 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
well with cloudy (although note that we have turned off two important ionization
mechanisms in cloudy). The disagreement is slightly worse between 0< log(U)< 2,
and the slightly higher heating rate in python is the reason for the shape of the T vs
log(U) curve being different around this point. This is where iron ionization heating
(including un-modelled UTA heating) becomes dominant.

5.5 Treatment of excited levels
Much effort has been expended in this project to allow accurate calculation of the ion-
ization balance of gas illuminated by a non-thermal SED. This has in large part been
successful, as evidenced by the promising agreement between ionization states predicted
in python and cloudy. However, this is not the complete picture, since ions can exist
in excited states. The excitation level of ions is particularly important in the calculation
of line emission, but it can also affect the detailed ionization state through ionization
from excited levels. There has not been sufficient time to address excitation of ions for
non-thermal SEDs in this project, but in this section we will discuss the approximations
that have been made.
There are three main areas in which the calculation of level populations affects a RT and
photoionization calculation. First, in the ionization calculations, the Saha equation only
links two individual levels of an ion. We have chosen to calculate the relative populations
of the ground state of two adjacent ions. One can generalise the calculation to include all
levels of the two adjacent ions by replacing the ground state degeneracies (gi+1,0 and gi,0
in Equation 5.1) with the partition functions for the two ions. In the original version of
python, the partition functions are calculated using a first order non-LTE correction,
given by Equation 4.16. This equation is based upon the assumption that the levels
are radiatively excited, and the specific intensity can be modelled as a dilute blackbody.
Initial testing showed that this approximation was not appropriate for the non-thermal
SEDs we were modelling, and in fact worsened our agreement with cloudy. The correct
way to deal with this would be to solve for level populations using photo-excitation rates
based on the actual specific intensity in a cell and also collisional excitation rates based
on the electron density and velocity distribution. This is a complex task, beyond the
scope of the project. In situations where we are modelling the specific intensity with
exponential and power law models rather than a dilute blackbody, we therefore assume
that all ions exist only in the ground state. Given the good agreement between python
and cloudy, this appears to be reasonable over a large range of ionization parameters.
In the original version of python, the partition function is also used in the calculation of
116 Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN
bound-free opacity, where photoionization from excited levels is included. If we assume
all ions are only in the ground state, this can clearly affect the total level of bound-free
opacity and heating. Free-bound cooling would be similarly affected, since it is calculated
via the Milne relation, and excited levels are also included in this calculation. However,
we can be reasonably sure that if the calculation of the ionization state is not affected
adversely by the assumption of all ions only being in the ground state, then the effect on
the heating and cooling rates will be similarly negligible. This is borne out once more
by the good agreement with cloudy for the heating and cooling rates.
Finally, level populations are central to the calculation of line opacities and emission. In
the original version of python, level populations were calculated using a two-level atom
model (see Section 4.3.4.3 and specifically Equation 4.29 for details). This takes account
of stimulated excitation and de-excitation through the normal assumption that the mean
intensity is a dilute blackbody. This formulation has not been changed in the new version
of python, and so the mean intensity will not be accurately modelled. It is perhaps
surprising therefore, that the overall line cooling rate appears to be correctly calculated,
at least for the geometry and illuminating spectrum used to create figure 5.19. In this
case, the modelled dilute blackbody has a very small radiative weight, and so the popu-
lations in the two level atom are set by collisional excitation and spontaneous radiative
de-excitation. Presumably, the line populations in cloudy are also set collisionally.
It seems therefore that use of the less accurate dilute blackbody model for mean intensity
in the two level atom approximation does not cause significant error, at least to the overall
line cooling rate. It is less clear at the time of writing how it affects the modelling of
which lines actually emit the energy. The way forward is clear - use the same model for
mean intensity as used in the ionization calculations. This is an improvement that will
take place in the next phase of development of python.
5.6 Atomic data
For the calculations described in this work, we include atomic data for H, He, C, N, O,
Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe. Elemental abundances are taken from Verner
Chapter 5 Radiative transfer and ionization calculations in AGN 117
et al. (1994), and the basic atomic data, such as ionization potential and ground state
multiplicities, are taken from Verner et al. (1996b). For H, He, C, N, O and Fe, we use
topbase (Cunto et al. 1993) data for energy levels and photoionization cross sections
from both ground state and excited levels. For other elements, we use the analytic
approximations for ground state photoionization cross sections given in Verner et al.
(1996a). For bound-bound transitions, we use the line list given in Verner et al. (1996b),
which contains nearly 6000 ground-state-connected lines. The levels associated with
these lines are computed from the line list information using a method similar to that
described by Lucy (1999).
We adopt dielectronic recombination rate coefficients and total radiative rate coefficients
from the chianti database version 7.0 (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2012). Ground-
state recombination rates are taken from Badnell (2006) where available and otherwise
computed from the photoionization data via the Milne relation. Finally, we use Gaunt
factors for free-free interactions given by Sutherland (1998).

A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For
BALQSOs
6.1 Introduction
In Section 1.3.3 we introduced a disk wind model for the BLR in AGN which suggests a
unification scheme linking type 1 quasars and BALQSOs via wind emission and absorp-
tion. In order to assess the feasibility of such a model, it is clearly important to determine
the physical properties  i.e. the geometry, kinematics and energetics  of these outflows.
However, while there have been many previous efforts in this direction (see Chapter 3)
there has not really been a convergence towards a unique physical description. Our aim
here is to test if a simple, physically motivated disk wind model can give rise to spectra
that resemble those of BALQSOs when the line of sight towards the central engine lies
within the wind cone.
In Section 6.2, we describe the family of kinematic disk wind models we use to describe
AGN/QSO outflows. In Section 6.3, we discuss observational and theoretical constraints
that restrict the relevant parameter space of the model. These considerations allow us
to define a benchmark disk wind model as a reasonable starting point for investigating
the impact of disk winds on the spectra of AGN/QSO.

model.
In Section 6.4, we present the results from simulations of this benchmark model, including
synthetic spectra. We then go on to discuss the implications of what we see.
6.2 The Kinematic Disk Wind Model
Since the driving mechanism, geometry and dynamics of AGN/QSO disk winds are all
highly uncertain, we use a flexible, purely kinematic model to describe the outflow.
This allows us to describe a wide range of plausible disk winds within a single, simple
framework. The specific prescription we use was developed by Shlosman and Vitello
(1993, SV93 hereafter) to model the accretion disk winds observed in CVs, i.e. accreting
white dwarf binary systems.
The geometry of our outflow model is illustrated in Figure 6.1. A biconical wind is taken
to emanate between radii rmin and rmax in the accretion disk, with the wind boundaries
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 121
making angles of min and max with the axis of symmetry. At each radius, r0, within this
range, the wind leaves the disk with a poloidal (non-rotational) velocity vector oriented
at an angle  to the axis of symmetry, with  given by
 = min + (max  min)x , (6.1)
where
r0  rmin
rmax  rmin
. (6.2)
The parameter  can be used to vary the concentration of poloidal streamlines towards
either the inner or outer regions of the wind, but throughout this work we fix it to 1, so
the poloidal streamlines are equally spaced in radius.
The poloidal velocity, vl, along a streamline in our model is given by
vl = v0 + [v(r0) v0]
(l/Rv)
(l/Rv)
, (6.3)
where l is distance measured along a poloidal streamline. This power-law velocity profile
was adopted by SV93 in order to give a continuous variation in the derivative of the
velocity and a realistic spread of Doppler-shifted frequencies in the outer portion of the
wind (l > Rv). We have similar requirements. The initial poloidal velocity of the wind,
v0 is (somewhat arbitrarily) set to 6 km s1 for all streamlines, comparable to the sound
speed in the disk photosphere. The wind then speeds up on a characteristic scale length
Rv, defined as the position along the poloidal streamline at which the wind reaches half
its terminal velocity, v. The terminal poloidal velocity along each streamline is set to
a fixed multiple of the escape velocity at the streamline foot point,
v = fvesc, (6.4)
so the innermost streamlines reach the highest velocities. The power-law index  controls
the shape of the velocity law: as  increases, the acceleration is increasingly concentrated
around l = Rv along each streamline. For large , the initial poloidal velocity stays low
near the disk and then increases quickly through Rv to values near v.

three values of . M and (r0) are set as in the benchmark model defined in
Section 6.3
The wind is assumed to initially share the Keplerian rotation profile of the accretion disk,
i.e. v,0(r0) = vK(r0) at the base of the outflow. As the wind rises above the disk and
expands, we assume that specific angular momentum is conserved, so that the rotational
velocities decline linearly with increasing cylindrical distance from the launch point.
The SV93 prescription also allows us to control the mass loading of the outflow as a
function of radius. More specifically, the local mass-loss rate per unit surface area on the
disk (mwind) is given by
mwind  Mwindr0 cos [(r0)] (6.5)
where Mwind is the global mass loss rate through the wind. The run of mass loss rate
per unit area with r0 is illustrated in Figure 6.2.
The combination of local mass-loss rate, launching angle and poloidal velocity is sufficient
to uniquely determine the density at any point in the wind via a continuity equation (see
SV93 for details). The resulting wind is a smooth, single phase outflow without clumps.
There is evidence for structure in BALQSO outflows, apparent from complex line shapes
(e.g. Ganguly et al. 2006; Simon and Hamann 2010) and time variability (e.g. Capellupo
et al. 2011, 2012, 2013), but this is something our simple model cannot address. However,
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 123
hot star winds and CV winds also exhibit variability and small-scale structure, yet much
has been learned about these winds by focussing on the global, underlying smooth flow
field. This is the approach followed here.
6.3 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
One of the main challenges in trying to model BALQSOs is that the physical charac-
teristics of the disk winds that produce the BALs are highly uncertain. The kinematic
model described in Section 6.2 is sufficiently flexible to describe a wide range of outflow
conditions, but the price for this flexibility is a potentially huge parameter space. We
have therefore used a variety of theoretical and observational constraints (and consider-
able trial and error) to design a benchmark disk wind model whose predicted spectrum
resembles that of a BALQSO (for sightlines cutting through the outflow).
Since we have not yet carried out a systematic exploration of the relevant parameter
space, we make no claim that this fiducial model is optimal, nor that it faithfully describes
reality. Indeed, in Section 6.5, we will discuss some of its shortcomings. However, we
believe it is nevertheless extremely useful as a benchmark. More specifically, it provides
(i) a first indication of what can be realistically expected of disk wind models; (ii) a
better understanding of the challenges such models face; (iii) a convenient starting point
for further explorations of parameter space.
In the rest of this section, we will discuss the constraints that have informed our choice
of parameters for the benchmark model, which are summarised in Table 6.1.
6.3.1 Basic Requirements: BALnicity and Ionization State
Our primary aim here is to find a set of plausible parameters for a QSO wind that yield
synthetic spectra containing the features expected of a BALQSO from a range of viewing
angles. As noted in Section 6.1, in the majority of BALs, the HiBALs, the absorption
features are due to highly ionized species such as N v 1240, C iv 1550, and Si iv
1400. The C iv feature, in particular, is most often used to identify BALQSOs, so
124 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
we judge the initial success of candidate wind models by their ability to produce this
feature. In practice, this is primarily a constraint on the ionization state of the wind:
we require that C iv should be present  if not necessarily dominant  throughout an
appreciable fraction of the outflow.
BALs are usually identified via the so-called BALnicity index (BI) (Weymann et al. 1991),
which is a measure of absorption strength in the velocity range between 3000 km s1
and 25000 km s1. It is therefore not sufficient to produce C iv anywhere in the outflow
 in order for the model to resemble a BAL, C iv needs to be present in reasonable
concentrations in regions characterized by the correct velocities.
6.3.2 Black Hole Mass, Accretion Rate and Luminosity
Our goal is to model a fairly typical, high-luminosity (BAL)QSO, so we adopt a black
hole mass of 109 M, along with an Eddington ratio of  = 0.2. For an assumed accretion
efficiency of  = 0.1, this corresponds to an accretion rate of Maccretion  5 Myr1 and
a bolometric disk luminosity of Lbol ' 2.4 1046 ergs s1.
6.3.3 Outflow Geometry
BALQSOs represent '20% of all QSOs (e.g. Knigge et al. 2008; Hewett and Foltz 2003,
but also see Allen et al. 2011). There are two obvious ways to interpret this number: (i)
either all QSOs spend ' 20% of their life as BALQSOs (evolutionary unification; e.g.
Becker et al. 2000), or (ii) all QSOs contain disk winds, but the resulting BAL signatures
are visible only from ' 20% of all possible observer orientations (geometric unification;
e.g. Elvis 2000).1 Here, we adopt the geometric unification picture, with the aim of
testing its viability.
As illustrated in Figure 6.3, our wind geometry allows for three distinct classes of sight-
line towards the central engine. Looking from the polar direction, above the wind cone,
1A 20% BAL fraction could be an underestimate, since intrinsic BALQSO fractions tend to be
derived from magnitude-limited samples, with no allowance for the possibility that foreshortening, limb-
darkening or wind attenuation may reduce the continuum flux of a typical BALQSO relative to that of
a typical QSO (Krolik and Voit 1998). For the purpose of the present paper, we ignore this potential
complication.

the sightline does not intersect the wind at all, and looking from the equatorial direc-
tion, the sightline passes through the base of the wind cone where the projected line of
sight velocities are too low to produce BAL features. We anticipate that BAL features
will result when the central engine (or, strictly speaking, the UV-bright portions of the
accretion disk) are viewed from the third class of sightline - looking into the wind cone.
We therefore expect such sightlines to subtend ' 20% of the sky as seen by the cen-
tral engine. Note that this description of the sightlines only applies to models like our
benchmark model, in which most of the emission arises from inside the wind launching
radius.
If we define min and max as the angles made by the inner and outer boundaries of the
wind with respect to the disk normal, these constraints translate into a simple relation-
ship between min and max, i.e.
0.2 = cos(min) cos(max). (6.6)
Most geometrical unification scenarios assume that BAL-producing QSO winds flow pre-
dominantly along the equatorial plane of the disk, rather than along the polar axis (e.g.
Weymann et al. 1991; Ogle et al. 1999; Elvis 2000; however, see Zhou et al. 2006 and
Brotherton et al. 2006 for a contrary view). In line with this general view, we have found
that ionization states capable of producing C iv and other typical BAL features are more
naturally produced in equatorial, rather than polar disk winds. This is because one of
the main challenges faced by disk wind models is to prevent the over-ionization of the
126 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
outflow by the central X-ray source (see below). Other things being equal, equatorial
winds are less ionized, partly because of limb darkening, and partly because the disk
appears foreshortened from equatorial directions. In addition, in geometries like ours,
where the wind arises from parts of the disk radially outside the location where the ion-
izing radiation is produced, an equatorial wind exhibits self-shielding, i.e. the radiation
must pass through the inner parts of the wind to reach the outer parts. Therefore the
ionization state can be lower than for a polar wind, where all parts of the wind can see
the ionizing radiation directly.
Based on these considerations, we adopt a mostly equatorial geometry with min = 70
and max = 82 for our benchmark model. With this choice, 66% of the remaining
sightlines lie above the wind cone, while 14% view the central source through the base
of the wind. If geometric unification is correct and complete  in the sense that the
emission lines in non-BAL QSOs are produced by the same outflow that produces the
absorption features seen in BALQSOs (e.g. Elvis 2000)  we would ideally see different
classes of QSO as we view a given system from the three distinct types of viewing angles.
6.3.4 Wind-Launching Region
There is no consensus on the location of the wind-launching region on the accretion disk.
However, there are several empirical and theoretical considerations that can inform the
design of our benchmark model.
First, within the geometric unification scenario, QSO disk winds are responsible not
only for BAL features, but also for the broad emission lines (BELs) seen in non-BAL
QSOs. We can therefore use the result of reverberation mapping studies of this broad
line region (BLR) to guide us in locating the outflow. Kaspi et al. (2000) have carried out
reverberation mapping of the C iv BLR for high luminosity quasars. A representative
example is S5 0836+71, a quasar with a black hole mass of 2.6 109 M, for which they
found a rest frame delay of 188 days. This delay implies a distance of the line-forming
region from the UV continuum source of 1260 rg.2 Since the C iv line-forming region
2Note that the UV continuum is produced at very small radii compared to the wind launch radius
and so can be treated as originating from the centre of the model for these estimates
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 127
may lie substantially downstream in the outflow, this is an upper limit on the distance
of the launching region from the centre.
Second, BAL features exhibit variability on timescales from days to years (e.g. Capellupo
et al. 2011, 2012, 2013). If interpreted in terms of wind features crossing our line of sight,
the shortest variability time scales  which arise in the innermost parts of the line-forming
region  correspond to distances of  3  1016 cm or, equivalently,  200 rg from the
centre (for an assumed MBH ' 109 M).
Third, one of the most promising mechanisms for driving QSO disk winds is via radiation
pressure in spectral lines (e.g. Proga et al. 2000; Proga and Kallman 2004). Empirical
support for this idea comes from the presence of the ghost of Lyman  in some N v
BAL features (see Arav et al. 1995; Arav 1996; North et al. 2006; but also see Cottis et al.
2010). In published simulations where such winds are modelled in a physically consistent
manner, the typical launching radii are (a few) 100 rg (e.g. Proga et al. 2000; Risaliti
and Elvis 2010).
Fourth and finally, it is physically reasonable to assume that the maximum velocity
achieved by the outflow corresponds roughly to the fastest escape velocity in the wind
launching region on the accretion disk. Observationally, vmax  20, 000 km s1, which,
for a 109M black hole, corresponds to the escape velocity from '400 rg.
Taken together, all of these considerations suggest that a reasonable first guess at the
location of the wind-launching region on the disk is on the order of a few hundred rg. In
our benchmark model, we therefore adopt rmin = 300 rg and rmax = 600 rg.
6.3.5 Wind Mass-Loss Rate
One of the most fundamental parameters of any wind model is the mass-loss rate into
the outflow, Mwind. In our benchmark model, we set Mwind = Macc = 5 M yr1.
This value was arrived at mainly by trial and error, but with a conservative preference
for values satisfying Mwind< Macc. As shown explicitly in Section 6.5.1, in practice, we
found that we required Mwind ' Macc in order to produce BAL features for even modest
X-ray luminosities.
128 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
Strictly speaking, any model with Mwind> Macc is not entirely self-consistent, since the
presence of such an outflow would alter the disks temperature structure (e.g. Knigge
1999). However, we neglect this complication, since the vast majority of the disk lumi-
nosity arises from well within our assumed wind-launching radius. Thus even though
our model ignores that the accretion rate is higher further out in the disk, it correctly
describes the innermost disk regions that produce virtually all of the luminosity.
Finally, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we take the simplest possible pre-
scription for the run of the mass-loss rate with radius across the wind-launching region,
i.e.  = 0 (see Equation 6.5 in Section 6.2).
6.3.6 Velocity Law Parameters
Ideally, the parameters defining the poloidal velocity law of the wind would be predicted
by the relevant acceleration mechanism. However, since this is not yet possible, we have
simply adopted parameters that result in reasonably BAL-like C iv features.
As noted in Section 6.3.4 above, it seems physically plausible that the terminal outflow
velocity along a poloidal streamline will roughly reflect the local escape velocity at the
streamline footpoint. Having already adopted wind launching radii based on this idea,
we therefore also adopt v = vesc, i.e. f = 1 in Equation 6.4.
The other two parameters defining the poloidal velocity law are Rv, the poloidal distance
at which the velocity is equal to half the terminal velocity, and , the exponent describing
how the velocity varies with poloidal distance. As discussed above, the locations of BAL-
and BEL-forming regions within the wind likely extend to distances of up to about
2000 rg, so this is a reasonable number to adopt for Rv. For the 109M black hole in our
benchmark model, this corresponds to Rv = 1018 cm. Finally, in the absence of other
information, we adopt  = 1. This value produces a relatively slow acceleration as a
function of poloidal distance along a streamline and seems to produce reasonable BAL
shapes. We will explore the effect of changing these parameters in future work.
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 129
6.3.7 X-ray Spectrum and Luminosity
The X-ray luminosity of the central source is set to LX = 1043 ergs s1 in our bench-
mark model. This value was arrived at through the requirement that the model should
produce BALs which constrains the X-ray luminosity, since X-rays can strongly affect
the ionization state of the outflow. We set the spectral index of the X-ray spectrum to
X = 0.9, as suggested by Giustini et al. (2008).
Quasar spectra are often characterised in terms of the ratio of X-ray to bolometric (or
UV) luminosity. This ratio is usually characterized by the spectral index between X-rays
and optical/UV, OX , defined as
OX = 0.3838 log
L(2 keV )
L(2500 )
, (6.7)
where L(2 keV ) and L(2500 ) are the inferred monochromatic luminosities at 2 keV (X-
ray) and 2500 (UV), respectively. Ignoring the angle dependence of the disk emission,
we obtain a mean value of OX  2.2 for the parameters used in our benchmark model.
This is considerably lower than observed in typical non-BAL QSOs (Just et al. 2007)
and lies near the lower (X-ray weak) end of the range of ox seen in BALQSOs (e.g
Giustini et al. 2008; Gibson et al. 2009). The X-ray weakness of the model, as well as the
sensitivity of our results to the adopted X-ray luminosity, are discussed in more detail in
Section 6.5.1.
6.3.8 Size and Resolution of the Numerical Grid
The outer edge of our simulation grid is set to 1 1019 cm, large enough to ensure that
all spectral features of interest arise entirely within the computational domain. In all
simulations shown in this paper, this domain is sampled by a cylindrical grid composed
of 100 100 logarithmically spaced cells. We have carried out resolution tests to ensure
that this is sufficient to resolve the spatially varying physical conditions and ionization
state of the outflow.

6.4 Results
Having defined a benchmark disk wind model for AGN/QSOs, we are ready to examine
its predicted physical and observable characteristics. In Section 6.4.2 we will present
synthetic spectra reminiscent of BALQSOs for sightlines looking into the wind cone.
However, it is helpful to examine the physical and ionization state of the benchmark
model before analyzing these spectra in detail.
6.4.1 The Physical State of the Outflow
The top four panels in Figure 6.4 show a selection of physical parameters of the converged
wind model. Considering first the electron density (top left panel), we see that our
choice of kinematic parameters has given rise to an outflow with a fairly high density of
nH  1010 cm3 at its base. However, the density declines quickly as we move outwards,
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 131
due to the expansion and acceleration of the wind. Hydrogen is fully ionized throughout
the entire outflow, so nH ' ne everywhere.
The electron temperature in the wind ranges from  103 K near the base of the wind to
more than 105 K (top right panel). The highest temperatures are in a thin layer near the
top of the wind, at distance of ' 1018 cm from the central engine. These regions are
hot because they are directly exposed to the radiation field of the accretion disk and the
X-ray source. These regions also shield the wind material behind them, however, and
thus help to ensure more moderate temperatures in the rest of the outflow. In fact, much
of the disk wind is heated to temperatures near Te  104 K, which are quite conducive
to the formation of the high-ionization lines typically seen in (BAL)QSOs, such as C iv,
Si iv and N v.
The middle panels of Figure 6.4 illustrate the velocity structure of our benchmark model,
separated into poloidal (middle left panel) and rotational (middle right panel) compo-
nents. The poloidal velocities show the relatively gradual speed-up of the outflow as a
function of distance, which is due to our choice of velocity law exponent. As one would
expect, low velocities are found near the base of the wind and high velocities are reached
only quite far out. It is this variation in poloidal velocity which produces BAL features
as photons produced by the effectively point-like central UV source are scattered out of
the line of sight by progressively faster moving wind parcels.
By contrast, the highest rotational velocities are found near the disk plane, where they
are effectively equal to the Keplerian velocities in the disk. They then decline linearly
with increasing cylindrical distance from the rotation axis, because we assume that wind
material conserves specific angular momentum. The projected rotational velocity along
a sightline to the central source is zero (or nearly so), and therefore rotational velocities
do not play a major part in the formation of BAL features, although they should help
in producing broad emission lines.
The bottom left and right panels in Figure 6.4 show the ionization parameter and C iv
ionization fraction throughout the outflow, respectively. Interestingly, the model gener-
ates sufficient concentrations C iv to make strong BALs even though U > 1 throughout
132 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
most of the wind. This contrast with the results shown for a thin-shell model in Fig-
ure 5.6, where this ion is not present for such values of U . The main reason for this
difference is that the wind is self-shielding: absorption in the inner parts of the outflow
(primarily due to photoionization) can strongly modify the SED seen by the outer parts
of the wind. This, in turn, changes the ionization parameter at which particular ions are
preferentially formed. Figure 6.5 illustrates the effect of the self-shielding on the SED
seen by different parts of the outflow.
6.4.2 Observing the Model: Synthetic Spectra
Figure 6.6 shows the spectra we predict for observers located along the directions indi-
cated in the lower right panel of Figure 6.4. These viewing angles correspond to sightlines
to the central source that look above the wind cone (i = 40), into the wind cone (i = 75
and i = 80), and through the base of the wind cone (i = 85). For comparison, we also
show a pure, unobscured continuum spectrum for each viewing angle; these continua
were generated by re-running the model with the wind density set to a negligible value.
6.4.2.1 Sightlines looking into the wind cone
The two middle panels in Figure 6.6 show the emergent spectra for sightlines through the
wind (i = 75 and i = 80). These spectra clearly contain BALs, i.e. broad, blue-shifted
absorption features associated with several strong, high-ionization lines in the UV region.
More formally, we calculate BIs of 11400 km s1 (i = 75) and 9900 km s1 (i = 80)
for the C iv lines we predict for these two sightlines. Thus observed systems displaying
these spectra would certainly be classified as bona-fide BALQSOs. This is one of the
main results of our work.
Many of the transitions exhibiting BAL features in the spectra for both sightlines also
show a redshifted emission component, forming the other part of the classic P-Cygni
profile seen in such sources. This can be interpreted as the red-shifted part of a classic
rotationally broadened, double-peaked emission line, which is produced primarily by

scattering in the base of the wind. The blue-shifted part of the line profile is not visible,
since it is superposed on and/or absorbed by the BAL feature.
Another interesting feature of the BAL spectra is that the Si iv absorption feature
is narrower than the C iv feature for all sightlines. This is due to the lower ionization
potential of the silicon ion, meaning that it is produced in a more limited part of the wind.
The relative strengths of features is broadly in agreement with observations (Gibson
et al. 2009) and demonstrates that, at least to first order, we are predicting the correct
ionization state in the BAL-forming portion of the wind.
The continuum for both sightlines through the wind is suppressed relative to the un-
obscured SED (see Figure 6.6). This attenuation of the continuum is predominantly
due to electron scattering. The optical depth to electron scattering through the wind
is shown in Figure 6.7, along with the corresponding attenuation factor, F/F0 = ees .

a scaled continuum. The scaled continuum is the unobscured continuum scaled
to equal the simulated spectrum away from line features, and therefore takes
account of electron scattering. The location of some of the spectral features
most relevant for BALQSOs are marked.
136 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
For example, at i = 75 our model gives es ' 0.3 and F/F0 ' 0.7, in agreement with
Figure 6.6.
Detailed C iv line profiles predicted by our model for a more finely spaced grid of sight-
lines are shown in Figure 6.8, along with the BI calculated for each profile. BALs (i.e.
features with BI > 0) are observed for inclinations 73 < i < 83, which represents
' 17% of all possible sightlines.
None of the BALs are completely black. Examination of the history of the photon pack-
ets contributing to the flux seen at the bottom of the lines reveals that all have scattered
at least once, which means that this radiation could exhibit significant polarisation. Ob-
servations of BALs do indeed find significant polarisation in the troughs (e.g DiPompeo
et al. 2011).
6.4.2.2 Sightlines looking above the wind cone
We now consider the i = 40 sightline, which views the central engine from above the
wind cone. In a pure geometric unification scenario, this sightline may be expected to
produce a classic Type I QSO spectrum. What we observe from the simulation is a
slightly enhanced continuum, along with some broad, but weak emission lines (as in Sim
et al. 2008).
The continuum enhancement is mainly due to electron scattering into this line of sight.
As we have seen in Section 6.4.2.1 and Figure 6.7, the base of the wind is marginally
optically thick to electron scattering in directions along the disk plane. Thus photons
scattering in this region tend to emerge preferentially along the more transparent sight-
lines perpendicular to this plane, and the wind essentially acts as a reflector.
More importantly, the emission lines superposed on the continuum do correspond to the
typical transitions seen in Type I QSOs, but they are weaker than the observed features.
For example, the C iv emission line in our model has an equivalent width of only 1.4 .
By contrast, the equivalent with of the C iv line in a typical QSO with a continuum
luminosity of L(1550) ' 1043 ergs s1 is ' 60  (Xu et al. 2008). Other sightlines
above the wind cone (0  i  70) yield qualitatively similar spectra. Overall, the
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 137
presence of the right sort of emission lines is encouraging, but their weakness is an
obvious shortcoming of the model. We will discuss the topic of line emission in more
detail in Section 6.5.2.
6.4.2.3 Sightlines looking through the base of the wind cone
Let us finally consider the highest inclinations, which correspond to sightlines that do not
lie along the wind cone, but for which the UV continuum source (i.e. the central region
of the accretion disk) is viewed through the dense, low-velocity base of the outflow. It is
not obvious what type of QSO one might expect to see from such sightlines, since in the
standard model of QSOs, one might expect the torus to obscure such sightlines.
Figure 6.7 shows that the es > 7 for this inclination, and indeed we find that essentially
all of the radiation emerging from the model in this direction has been scattered several
times within the wind before ultimately escaping along this vector. This is in line with
results presented by Sim et al. (2010a), who found that, for Compton-thick winds, AGN
spectra at high inclination are dominated by scattered radiation. Recent observational
work (e.g. Treister et al. 2009) has demonstrated that there is a population of AGN in the
local universe where the X-ray source is completely obscured, and the X-ray spectrum is
dominated by reflection. These high inclination sightlines could represent these so called
reflection dominated Compton thick AGN.
The shape of the predicted emission features is dominated by the rotational velocity
field in the wind. Taking C iv as an example and examining Figure 6.4, we see that the
fractional abundance peaks in a region where the rotational velocity is significantly higher
than the outflow velocity. Scattering from this region (along with any thermal emission)
will produce the double-peaked line profile that is characteristic of line formation in
rotating media (e.g. Smak 1981; Marsh and Horne 1988). The blue part of this profile
is then likely suppressed, since it is superposed on and/or absorbed by blue-shifted
absorption in the base of the wind.

6.5 Discussion
The results shown in the previous section confirm that a simple disk wind model can
produce the characteristic BAL features seen in about ' 20% of QSOs. However, they
also reveal some significant shortcomings of the model. In this section, we will consider
some of the key questions raised by our results in more detail and point out promising
directions for future work.
6.5.1 The Sensitivity of BAL Features to X-ray Luminosity
As noted in Section 6.3.7, our benchmark model is rather X-ray weak compared to most
real (BAL)QSOs. To quantify this, Figure 6.9 shows the viewing angle dependence of
OX for our benchmark model. Clearly, OX (i.e. the X-ray to optical ratio) is a strong
function of inclination. Two effects are responsible for this.

is scaled to a linear continuum, fitted at velocity 30000kms1 The BALnicity
Index for the spectrum is marked on each plot.
First, the UV and optical fluxes are dominated by the accretion disk and thus decline
steeply with inclination, due to foreshortening and limb-darkening. By contrast, the
X-ray source is assumed to emit isotropically (although the disk can obscure the lower
hemisphere). Thus, in the absence of any outflow, OX increases with inclination, as the
X-rays become relatively more important. This is the trend marked by the solid line in
Figure 6.9.
Second, sightlines to the central engine that cross the wind cone can be affected by
absorption and radiative transfer in the outflow. In particular, bound-free absorption
140 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
preferentially suppresses the X-ray flux along such sightlines in our model, and hence
reduces OX . The crosses in Figure 6.9 show the predicted values of OX taking both
effects into account. This shows that the suppression of OX is strongest for sightlines
looking directly into the wind, i.e. the same viewing angles that produce BALs.
For our benchmark model, we find that OX = 2.44 for i = 40 and OX = 2.89 for
i = 75. If these viewing angles can be taken to represent non-BAL QSOs and BALQSOs
respectively, we can compare these values to those expected from the observed scaling
relation between L2500 and OX found by Just et al. (2007) for non-BAL QSOs,
OX = (0.140 0.007) log(L2500) + (2.705 0.212). (6.8)
Taking the values of L2500 for the two sightlines from our benchmark model, we obtain
empirical predictions of OX = 1.66  0.43 for i = 40 and OX = 1.52  0.43 for
i = 75. However, we still have to correct for the fact that BALQSOs are known to be X-
ray weak (presumably due to absorption in the outflow). Gibson et al. (2009) find that the
median OX = OX,BALQSO  OX,QSO = 0.17 for all BALQSOs with BI > 0, but
the distribution of OX is quite wide, and systems with large BI > 1000 km s1 tend to
have larger OX . If we adopt OX ' 0.3 as typical for strong BALQSOs (like our
benchmark model), the empirically predicted value for the i = 75 BALQSO sightline
becomes OX ' 1.8 0.4 (where the quoted uncertainty is purely that associated with
the scaling relation for non-BAL QSOs).
These numbers make the X-ray weakness of the benchmark model clear: at fixed L2500,
the emergent X-ray flux predicted by the model is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower
than the average observed values. Equivalently, the model corresponds to a 23 outlier
in the OX distribution of (BAL)QSOs.
To investigate whether we can increase LX substantially while retaining the observed
BAL features for sightlines looking into the wind cone, Figure 6.10 shows the behaviour
of the emergent spectra for i = 75 and i = 80 as the X-ray luminosity is increased
from LX = 1043 erg s1 to LX = 1044 erg s1. We will focus on the behaviour of
C iv and O vi as representative examples. For i = 75, the C iv BAL feature becomes

narrower with increasing LX : it gradually disappears, starting from the blue edge. The
feature is lost entirely by LX = 5 1043 ergs s1. The effect on the O vi feature is more
abrupt, with almost no effect up to a luminosity of 3.7  1043 ergs s1, but complete
disappearance for twice that luminosity. Similarly, for i = 80, C iv weakens gradually
in models with larger LX , while in this case O vi shows hardly any response to LX until
we reach LX = 1044 ergs s1. Note that C iv is still present with a clear BAL signature
at this X-ray luminosity for i = 85.
The strong sensitivity of the UV resonance transition to LX in this range can be under-
stood by considering the location of the photoionization edges for these species. Figure
6.11 shows these locations relative to the angle-averaged disk spectrum and the X-ray
spectra corresponding to LX = 1043 erg s1 and LX = 1044 erg s1. The ionization edge
of C iv falls very close to the frequency above which the X-ray source takes over from

the disk as the dominant spectral component. In fact, for LX = 1043 erg s1, photo-
ionization of C iv is driven primarily by disk photons, while for LX = 1044 erg s1, it
is mainly due to photons from the X-ray source. The photo-ionization rate of higher-
ionization species like O vi is dominated by the X-ray source even at LX = 1043 erg s1.
We conclude that moderate increases in LX (by a factor of a few) would be feasible
without any other parameter adjustments, but larger changes will begin to destroy BAL
features for more and more sightlines. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that the
negative effects of increasing LX on BAL features may be mitigated by simultaneously
increasing the mass-loss rate in the wind, Mwind. We have therefore carried out a 2-
dimensional sensitivity study, in which we vary both LX and Mwind. The results 
focussing particularly on the key C iv line profile for i = 75  are shown in Figure 6.12.
In each panel of this figure, we also give the BI measured for the profile shown, as well
as values of F/F0; the ratio of the continuum at 30000km s1 to that obtained in a
model without a wind.
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 143
The second column in Figure 6.12 illustrates the effect of increasing LX while keeping the
mass-loss rate at the benchmark value of Mwind = 5M yr1 (as in Figure 6.10). We see
again that the C iv BAL feature persists up to at least LX = 1044 erg s1, although it
becomes both weaker and narrower with increasing LX . For higher mass-loss rates (third
and beyond columns in Figure 6.12), the C iv profile becomes increasingly insensitive to
LX . So, as expected, increasing Mwind allows for the production of strong BAL features
in species like C iv even at higher irradiating LX . Thus one way to address the X-ray
weakness of the benchmark model (i.e. increase ox) is to increase both LX and Mwind.
This remedy has a side effect: any increase in Mwind also implies an increase in es,
the electron-scattering optical depth through the outflow, which reduces the observed
X-ray and optical luminosity of the BALQSO. For moderate inclinations and mass-loss
rates, the emergent continuum flux will scale simply as ees , although for the highest
inclinations and Mwind, scattered radiation will dominate the continuum and break this
scaling. In any case, our main conclusion is that, for high mass-loss rates, we are able
to produce BALs over a wider range of LX but at the expense of significant continuum
suppression. If this is to provide a realistic route towards geometrical unification, it
implies that the intrinsic luminosities of BALQSOs must be higher than suggested by
their observed brightness.
There are, of course, other possibilities. For example, if the outflow is clumpy (e.g.
Krolik et al. 1981; Arav et al. 1999b), some of the X-ray radiation may pass through the
wind unimpeded, thus increasing the observed LX for sightlines inside the wind cone.
Such a solution would have the added advantage that the higher density within the
clumps would naturally result in a lower ionization state for a given X-ray flux. Relaxing
the assumption of a smooth flow would, of course, take us back in the direction of cloud
models of the BLR and BALR. We plan to investigate the pros and cons of such scenarios
in future work.
6.5.2 The Weakness of Line Emission Produced by the Outflow
As mentioned in Section 6.4.2.2, our benchmark model does not produce strong emission
line features, especially at low inclination models where the geometric unification scenario

suggests Type I QSOs should be seen. This suggests that modifications are required in
some aspect of the structure or the physics that is incorporated into python, if the
geometric unification scenario is correct.
In considering this shortcoming, it is interesting to compare with the disk wind modelling
carried out by Murray et al. 1995 [hereafter MCGV95]. They explicitly model a line-
driven outflow, and the broad characteristics of their disk wind are sufficiently similar to
our benchmark model to make a comparison interesting. MCGV find that their outflow
produces BAL troughs when viewed at high inclinations. However, they also find that
their model produces sufficient collisionally excited emission in species like C iv to explain
the BEL in both BALQSOs and non-BAL QSOs. In their model, this C iv emission arises
in a layer of the wind close to the disk plane where C iv is the dominant ionization stage
of carbon. They argue that this region extends from ' 1016 cm to ' 1017 cm and is
characterized by Te ' 20, 000 K and ne ' 1010 cm3. It is the integrated, collisionally
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 145
excited emission from this region that dominates the C iv line flux in their model.
In the case of our benchmark model, Figure 6.4 shows that the fractional C iv abundance
is high (fC iv> 0.1) in a region extending from x ' 5  1016 cm to x ' 3  1017 cm.
However, the density in this region is considerably lower than in the C iv line-forming
region considered by MCGV: 107 cm3<ne< 109 cm3. It is this lower density that
almost certainly explains the difference in C iv emissivity in the models. In a later
version of their model (Murray and Chiang 1998), the production of C iv is dominated
by lower density (ne ' 108 cm3) material lying at larger radii r > 1018 cm. In these
models, it is the large emitting volume that explains the strength of collisionally excited
C iv feature.
These comparisons suggest that moderate changes to the benchmark model may be
enough to produce BELs via collisionally excited line emission in the outflow. It is likely
that such changes would go in the direction of increasing the density in some parts of
the wind, either by modifying existing wind parameters or by introducing clumpiness. In
fact, we can clearly see that the emission component of the C iv line in Figure 6.12 does
increase with increasing Mwind. However, even our highest Mwind models do not yet
produce enough emission at low inclination angles. Thus, while the benchmark model
shows some promise in the context of geometric unification, it remains to be seen whether
(and how) it can be modified to produce the strong emission lines seen in both BALQSOs
and non-BAL QSOs. This will be the subject of a separate paper.
Before we leave this section, it is interesting to ask why the scattering of C iv photons
in the outflow does not produce emission lines of sufficient strength in our model. In
CV winds, for example, modelling suggests that resonance scattering is the primary
mechanism for producing the observed emission line profiles (Shlosman and Vitello 1993;
Knigge et al. 1995, LK02, Noebauer et al. 2010). The critical factor in understanding the
relative importance of scattered photons to the line formation process is the combination
of foreshortening, limb-darkening, outflow orientation and covering factor. The outflows
in CVs are thought to be ejected roughly perpendicular to the accretion disk, albeit over
quite a large range of opening angles. Moreover, CV winds emerge directly above the
continuum emitting regions of the disk, whereas BALQSO winds cover only ' 20% as

seen from the continuum source. Thus, in a CV, an outflow that is optically thick in C iv
over some velocity interval will intercept virtually all of the continuum photons within
this interval  and scatter them into other sightlines, where they emerge as apparent
line emission. Conversely, our QSO wind scatters only a small fraction of the continuum
photons, even in frequency intervals in which the wind is optically thick. As a result,
scattered photons will not contribute as much to emission line formation.
6.5.3 Ionization Stratification and Reverberation Mapping
In our benchmark model, the ionization state of the outflow tends to increase with
increasing distance along poloidal streamlines (Figure 6.4). This observation is easily
understood. Far away from the central engine, in the region of the flow where the
BAL features are produced, the wind geometry approximates an optically thin, spherical
outflow. In such an outflow, U  v(r), so as long as the wind accelerates, the ionization
parameter must also increase outwards.
This trend may appear to contradict reverberation mapping studies of the BLR, which
suggest ionization stratification in the opposite sense. For example, the C iv BLR radius
at fixed UV luminosity inferred by Kaspi et al. (2007) is ' 2 smaller than that obtained
by Kaspi et al. (2005) for H. This sense of ionization stratification is also supported by
recent microlensing results (e.g. Guerras et al. 2013).
However, our model is not necessarily in conflict with these empirical findings. As dis-
cussed in Section 6.5.2, it is clear that the parts of the wind producing BALs (where U
increases outwards) are unlikely to be co-spatial with the parts of the wind producing
BELs. More specifically, only the dense base of the disk wind is likely to produce sig-
nificant amounts of collisionally excited line emission. Thus, in the context of disk wind
models, the reverberation mapping results are unlikely to probe the radial ionization
structure of the outflow, but may instead probe the stratification along the base of the
wind in the x direction. Here, the ionization parameter can (and does) decrease outwards
in our disk wind models.
148 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
6.6 Implications
Here we consider implications of our benchmark model for AGN feedback in galaxy
evolution and identifying possible driving mechanisms for the wind.
In energetic terms, effective feedback  sufficient to establish the MBH   relation, for
example  seems to require Lk/Lbol ' 0.005  0.05 (Di Matteo et al. 2005; Hopkins
and Elvis 2010). Here, Lk = 12Mwindv
 is the kinetic luminosity of the outflow. Our
benchmark model is characterized by v ' 20, 000 km s1 and Mwind = 5 M yr1,
which yields Lk/Lbol ' 0.025. Thus an outflow of this type would be capable of providing
significant amounts of energy-driven feedback. The kinetic luminosity of the benchmark
model is also broadly in line with the empirical scaling between Lbol and Lk found by
King et al. (2013) for black holes across the entire mass-scale, from compact binary
systems to AGN/QSO.
King (2003, 2005, 2010) has argued that QSO outflows interact with their host galaxy
in a momentum-, rather than energy-driven fashion. In this case, the strength of the
feedback an outflow can deliver depends on its momentum flux, Mwindv. This scenario
naturally produces the observedMBH relation if the outflows responsible for feedback
satisfy Mwindv ' LEdd/c; this is the single-scattering limit for momentum transfer in
a radiatively-driven outflow from a QSO radiating at Ledd. For our benchmark model,
we find Mwindv ' 0.7Lbol/c ' 0.1LEdd/c. In other words, the momentum flux in our
model is close to the single-scattering limit for its bolometric luminosity. Since black
hole growth and cosmological feedback are thought to be dominated by phases in which
Lbol ' LEdd (Soltan 1982; Yu and Tremaine 2002; Di Matteo et al. 2005), outflows of
this type would probably also meet momentum-based feedback requirements.
The momentum flux in the outflow is also a key parameter for any disk wind driven
by radiation pressure, such as the line-driven winds considered by MCGV95 and Proga
et al. (2000). In particular, such winds typically satisfy the single-scattering limit for
momentum transfer from the radiation field to the outflow, Mwindv  Lbol/c. As
noted above, our benchmark model also satisfies this limit. However, this is somewhat
misleading: our disk wind subtends only ' 20% of the sky as seen from the central
Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs 149
source, and it intercepts an even smaller fraction of the QSOs bolometric luminosity (due
to foreshortening and limb-darkening of the disk radiation field). The momentum flux
in our benchmark model actually exceeds the single-scattering limit if only momentum
carried by photons that actually intercept the wind is taken into account. Thus, in
the context of radiatively-driven winds, either the mass-loss rate in our model must
be overestimated or multiple scattering effects must be important. The latter has been
suggested for quasi-spherical Wolf-Rayet star winds (Lucy and Abbott 1993; Springmann
1994; Gayley 1995) but is much more challenging for the biconical wind considered here.
Alternatively, the winds of QSOs may not be driven (exclusively) by radiation pressure,
with magnetic/centrifugal forces providing the most obvious alternative (e.g. Blandford
and Payne 1982; Emmering et al. 1992; Proga 2003).
Our discussion of all these considerations is preliminary: the benchmark model is far
from perfect, and we have not yet carried out a comprehensive survey of the available
parameter space. However, the first column in Figure 6.12 shows that a reduction in the
mass-loss rate from the benchmark value of Mwind = 5M yr1 to Mwind = 1M yr1
virtually destroys the BAL features, even for LX = 1043 erg s1. Thus, at least for our
adopted wind geometry and kinematics, it seems that any outflow capable of producing
BAL features is also likely to provide significant feedback and pose a challenge to line-
driving.
6.6.1 Outlook
In our view, the most significant shortcomings of the benchmark model are its intrinsic
X-ray weakness and its inability to produce collisionally excited BELs. Both problems
might be resolved by moderate changes in wind parameters, so an important step will
be to explore the parameter space of our model. We plan to adopt two complementary
approaches in this: (i) systematic grid searches; (ii) targeted explorations guided by
physical insight. The latter approach is important, since compromises will have to be
made in the former: a detailed and exhaustive search over all relevant parameters is
likely to be prohibitive in terms of computational resource requirements. As an example
150 Chapter 6 A Benchmark Disk Wind Model For BALQSOs
of how physical insight can guide us, we note that both the X-ray and emission line
problems might be resolved by increasing the density in specific wind regions.
6.7 Summary
This work represents the first step in a long-term project to shed light on the nature of
accretion disk winds in QSOs. These outflows may be key to the geometric unification of
AGN/QSO and might also provide the feedback required by successful galaxy evolution
scenarios.
In this pilot study, we have focussed on the most obvious signature of these outflows,
the broad, blue-shifted absorption lines seen in ' 20% of QSOs. We have constructed
a kinematic disk wind model to test if it can reproduce these features. This benchmark
model describes a rotating, equatorial and biconical accretion disk wind with a mass-loss
rate Mwind ' Macc.3 A Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code, python,
was used to calculate the ionization state of the outflow and predict the spectra emerging
from it for a variety of viewing angles. Our main results are as follows:
(i) Our benchmark model succeeds in producing BAL-like features for sightlines to-
wards the central source that lie fully within the wind cone.
(ii) Self-consistent treatment of ionization and radiative transfer is necessary to reliably
predict the ionization state of the wind and the conditions under which key species
like C iv can efficiently form.
(iii) The benchmark model does not produce sufficient collisionally excited line emission
to explain the BELs in QSOs. However, we argue that moderate modifications to
its parameters might be sufficient to remedy this shortcoming.
(iv) The ionization structure of the model, and its ability to produce BALs, are quite
sensitive to the X-ray luminosity of the central source. If this is too high, the

indicated by observations. Higher values of LX may require higher outflow columns
 e.g. via higher Mwind  in order to still produce BALs.

7.1 Introduction
As discussed in Chapter 3, several mechanisms have been proposed to produce the accel-
erating force for disk winds in AGN, including gas/thermal pressure , magnetocentrifugal
forces and radiation pressure acting on spectral lines (line-driving). All of these mecha-
nisms have been shown to be capable of producing outflows in suitable conditions. How-
ever, line driving is particularly attractive, since the requisite force in this case arises
naturally when (primarily UV) photons produced by the central engine are scattered
by strong resonance lines. Many such lines are observed directly in the UV spectra of
(BAL)QSOs, so line driving must certainly be acting in some measure.
Following the kinematic disk wind simulations presented in the last chapter, it seemed
natural to carry out simulations for a more realistic physical model. In particular, a
hydrodynamic model such as that presented by Proga and Kallman (2004, hereafter
PK04) naturally forms higher density knots, so it is interesting to ask whether such
high density regions could produce enhanced emission line strengths. Moreover, the RT

treatment in the original simulation was necessarily simplified, so we were also interested
in seeing whether a full radiative transfer and ionization simulation in python would
give the same ionization structure as that found in PK04.
The PK04 wind model (introduced in Section 3.2.1.2) has already been subjected to
two post-processing radiative transfer calculations of the type we are proposing here.
Both of these were concerned with the impact of the predicted outflow on the X-ray
spectra of AGN/QSO. First, Schurch et al. (2009) performed a 1-D simulation which
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 155
found that the wind produced observable X-ray spectral features. Second, Sim et al.
(2010b, hereafter SP10) carried out a multi-dimensional radiative transfer simulation in
which the ionization state and temperature structure of the wind were self-consistently
computed. They confirmed that the wind was able to imprint a variety of characteristic
features into the X-ray spectra of AGN. However, they also showed that scattering in
the (failed) outflow is critically important in setting the ionization state of the wind in
regions that would otherwise be shielded from the central engine.
Here, we therefore carry out a full, multi-dimensional radiative transfer calculation for
the PK04 model that allows us to predict the ionization state, temperature structure and
emergent UV spectra for this outflow. This extends the work done by SP10 to the longer
wavelengths and lower ionization stages that are critical for the line-driving mechanism
and for the formation and the formation of BALs.
7.2 Method
In this section, we will review the geometry and kinematics of the outflow computed by
PK04. We also describe the form of the illuminating spectrum we adopt and discuss
how it relates to that used in PK04 and SP10. We use version 77 of python for the
calculations.
7.2.1 The PK04 disk wind geometry
We take as our input the hydrodynamic wind model computed by PK04 at time-step 955.
This represents a time sufficiently far from the simulation start that the wind geometry
no longer depends on initial conditions. In addition, at this point, the flow is only weakly
time-dependent, so this time-step is broadly representative of the flow as a whole. The
figures in PK04 also focused on this time-step, as did both SP10 and Schurch et al.
(2009). The hydrodynamic calculations in PK04 were carried out using zeus (Stone and
Norman 1992), modified to include the effect of the radiation field on the driving force
and the temperature balance of the wind. The model is illustrated in Figure 7.1, with
156 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model
the poloidal component of velocity field superimposed upon the density structure. PK04
noted three main regions (delineated on Figure 7.1 by radial lines):
 A: A hot, low-density, infalling region near the pole.
 B: A hot transition zone in which the wind struggles to escape.
 C: A warm, dense, equatorial flow that is shielded from the central source by a
high-density failed wind region close to the origin
The zeus grid is polar, logarithmic in both the r- and -direction, with finer discretisation
close to the disk and the origin. To carry out the radiative transfer calculation, we create
an identical grid and import the density and velocity structure of the zeus model. The
density in each of our grid cells is constant and taken to be the value at the centre of
each matching grid cell in the hydrodynamic model, whilst the velocity field in each
cell is interpolated across each cell based upon the values at the vertices in the original
model. This discretization of the velocity field lends itself more naturally to our use of
the Sobolev approximation in the treatment of line scattering.
Figure 7.2 shows the same density information as Figure 7.1, but on logarithmic axes
in order to highlight the dense parts of the wind closer to the disk plane. A wedge-
like region at the base of the wind clearly visible - the disk atmosphere. In our code,
photons emitted by the accretion disk start from the disk plane and therefore would
have to make their way through this atmosphere before entering the rest of the wind.
Such dense regions, in which photons scatter a very large number of times, are extremely
computationally expensive in a Monte-Carlo code. We therefore remove this part of the
flow from the computation, permitting photons to fly unimpeded from the disk into the
lower part of the wind. This is a reasonable approximation since, to first order, the dense
disk atmosphere would be expected to thermalise to the same temperature as the disk
beneath it. Hence the upper surface of that region would be expected to emit photons
with the same spectral distribution as our disk.
The dashed line in Figure 7.2 shows the angle at which we make this cut -  = 89.5. The
temperature of the lower surface of the flow where it is primarily irradiated by photons

from the disk is approximately equal to the disk below it. This is the same temperature
as would be expected if the surface was in direct contact with the upper surface of an
extended disk atmosphere. We are therefore confident that this simplification does not
significantly affect the results obtained for the bulk of the wind.
7.2.2 Illuminating spectrum
Given the density and velocity structure of the wind, we next need to specify the param-
eters of the radiation sources in our model, i.e. the accretion disk and X-ray-emitting
central corona. To permit comparison between our results and those of PK04 and SP10,
we match the parameters used in those studies as closely as possible.

PK04 assumed the presence of a 108M supermassive black hole (BH) at the centre
of their accretion disk and adopted an accretion rate on the BH of 1.8 Myr1. This
rate gives a disk luminosity of LD = 6.5 1045 ergs s1 assuming an efficiency of '
6%. In their hydrodynamic simulation, PK04 split the illuminating luminosity into two
components. First, they defined an ionizing luminosity (LX) that was used to compute
the temperature and ionization parameter throughout the wind. Second, they defined a
UV luminosity (LUV) that was used to compute the actual line-driving force. However,
in regions of the wind that are shielded from the X-ray source by optically thick material,
the wind temperature was set to that of the disk below the wind, thus implicitly assuming
that these parts of the wind would be heated and ionized by disk photons.
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 159
The balance between the two components was motivated by the composite spectra pre-
sented in Laor et al. (1997) and Zheng et al. (1997); the radio quiet composite is shown
in Figure 7.3. The ionizing luminosity, LX, defined by PK04 as the integrated lu-
minosity of the central source above 13.6 eV (912 ), was taken to be 10% of LD, or
6.5 1044 ergs s1. The ionization parameter at any point in the flow was then com-
puted from the local X-ray flux by assuming 1/r2 geometric dilution as well as ees
attenuation, where es is the optical depth towards the origin due to electron scatter-
ing. This ionization was then used to calculate the line-driving force using the analytic
formulae of Stevens and Kallman (1990). These formulae assume that the frequency
distribution of ionizing photons takes the form of a 10 keV bremsstrahlung spectrum
with no low-frequency cutoff. The calculations of the wind temperature structure in
PK04 used the same characteristic temperature for the X-ray source in order to ensure
self-consistency. A bremsstrahlung spectrum of this form, normalised to give the correct
value of LX is also plotted on Figure 7.3.
The UV luminosity in PK04 was defined as the luminosity in a band running from 200 to
3000  and was set to 90% of LD. It should be noted that there is a degree of inconsis-
tency here - a significant part of the UV band is actually above the 13.6eV lower limit
of the ionizing band, and we see from Figure 7.3 that the composite spectrum carries
significant ionizing luminosity that would contribute to LX, as well as LUV. However,
increasing LX to take account of this would mean that the luminosity around the peak
of the bremsstrahlung spectrum would be much too high. This illustrates the difficulty
of approximating an observed SED with a highly simplified model.
In our current calculation, we use a thin accretion disk with the same BH mass and
accretion rate adopted by PK04, even though such a model may not produce the best
match to observations (e.g Davis and Laor 2011; Done et al. 2012; Slone and Netzer
2012). We also include a power-law X-ray source assumed to arise in a central spherical
corona. This X-ray source is defined by the same photon index, , and luminosity in
the 2-10 keV range, L210, that was used by SP10. In that work, the X-ray parameters
were chosen so as to give a reasonable match to observations whilst maintaining the same
luminosity in the 2-10 keV range as the X-ray parameters in PK04. More specifically, we

follow SP10 in adopting L210 = 2.7 1044 ergs s1 and X = 2.1. Moreover, following
PK04, we set the radius of the X-ray source, rX, equal to the innermost radius of the
accretion disk. With these choices, our SED yields LX  0.7LD and LUV  0.9LD in
the notation of PK04. Note the two components sum to more than unity because we
count ionizing photons from the disk in both LX and LUV. Figure 7.3 shows that our
SED provides a reasonable match to the composite spectrum derived from observations
and also produces roughly the same luminosity at high energies as the bremsstrahlung
spectrum. However, the ionizing luminosity in our model is much higher than that in
the PK04 simulation, since we allow both disk and central source photons to contribute
to the ionizing flux. We return to this point in Section 7.4.1, where we explicitly check
the impact of this difference on the calculated ionization state of the wind. Our adopted
parameters are summarised in Table 7.1.
7.3 Results
We are now ready to present the key properties of our converged wind model. We will
first illustrate the ionization state of the wind and then present the simulated emergent
spectra. Finally, we will also show the temperature structure and ionization parameter
throughout the outflow.
7.3.1 Ionization state
We begin by considering the ionization state of carbon, since strong, blueshifted absorp-
tion associated with C iv 1550  is a defining feature in the UV spectra of essentially
all BALQSOs. However, as illustrated in Figure 7.4, carbon is actually fully ionized

throughout much of the outflow. In the very dense failed wind at the base of the wind,
carbon is in a much lower ionization state. This is partly due to the high density in
this region, but also to photoelectric absorption in the outer skin of the wind, which
removes a large proportion of the soft X-ray photons responsible for ionizing carbon. In
PK04, the warm outflow behind the failed wind also remained in a low ionization state.
However, in our calculation, the carbon in this area is fully ionized. This key difference
is due to scattered and reprocessed radiation and is discussed in more detail in section
7.4. Figure 7.4 also illustrates the sight-lines for which we produce synthetic spectra.
Figure 7.5 shows the mean charge of iron in the model and can be directly compared
to Figure 3 in SP10. The computed ionization states are very similar. This similarity
shows that the inclusion of an accretion disk in our simulation as a source of ionizing
photons has not altered the conclusions of the earlier work with regards to species whose
162 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model

ionization state is mainly set by the incident X-ray flux.
7.3.2 Synthetic spectra
Figure 7.6 shows synthetic spectra computed for the four sightlines illustrated in Figure
7.4. For comparison, the spectrum that would be seen in the absence of any absorbing
material (labelled unabsorbed) is also shown as a faint grey line for each sightline. The
80 sightline passes through the failed wind region where carbon is not fully ionized. This
is the most likely place to look for absorption from moderately ionized species. However,
the simulated spectrum for this sightline (the heavy black line) is almost entirely feature-
less except for a small absorption feature at 255  due to a resonance line of Fe xxiv.
The other three spectra in this plot show the proportion of the net spectrum made up
from unscattered, singly scattered and multiply scattered photons. These contributions
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 163
reveal why we do not see any absorption features associated with the species present in
the failed wind: essentially all of the photons escaping along this direction have scat-
tered at least once and about 50% of them have scattered more than once. Thus the net
spectrum for this sightline is produced by photons that have scattered around the failed
wind, rather than passing through it. Fe xxiv is present in the equatorial, outflowing
wind behind the failed wind region (see Figure 7.5) and scattered photons pass through
regions of the wind where this ion is present. The direct (unscattered) component of the
radiation field escaping along this sightline is very heavily attenuated by a combination
of photoionization absorption and electron scattering.
The 60 sightline skims the top of the failed wind. Here, the component of the synthetic
spectrum associated with photons that did not undergo any scattering events is only
slightly less than 50% of the total. As the viewing angle moves even further up, to 55,
most of the photons escape unscattered. The Fe xxiv feature is still present at 60, but
only in the direct component. The spectrum predicted for the 55 sightline is completely
featureless.
The final spectrum is computed for a sightline of 40, and here we see a continuum
enhancement at wavelengths below about 700 . This is a consequence of the geometry
of the wind model: photon packets with wavelength less than 700  are predominantly
produced by parts of the accretion disk inwards of the innermost radial extent of the wind
(60 RG). The spectrum is therefore made up of a direct component of photons passing
unimpeded from the disk into the relatively low density polar parts of the wind (direct
component), and photons reflecting from the inner face of the failed wind (scattered
component). By contrast, a significant proportion of photon packets with wavelength
longer than 700  are produced from parts of the accretion disk under the dense failed
wind, and this component will tend to be absorbed or scattered back into the disk.
We therefore only see a fraction of the direct component. Even when supplemented by
scattered radiation, the resulting flux is less than would be seen in the wind were not
present at all. The continuum enhancement at low inclination angles was also predicted
in the X-ray spectra computed in SP10, where it was also attributed to reflection from
the innermost illuminated face of the failed wind region.

of the two lower plots, while the right hand panel is optimised to show the full range
of temperatures obtained in the current calculations. The lower left panel shows the
temperature structure estimated by PK04, whilst the lower right hand panel shows the
temperature structure found by SP10. The clearest difference between the temperature
computed in the hydrodynamic simulation and that found here is in the low density
in-falling flow towards the polar direction. In this region, Compton heating and cooling
are the dominant mechanisms, and so the temperature depends on the mean frequency
of photons in the region. Since we include the radiation field produced by the accre-
tion disk in our ionization and thermal equilibrium calculations of ionization, the mean
frequency we find is is far lower than that assumed in PK04, where only the 10 keV
Bremsstrahlung spectrum was used to compute the ionization state and temperature
structure. The temperature structure found by SP10 is closer to ours, since they also
included an assumed disk spectrum in their calculation of Compton cooling. In any case,
the exact temperature in this polar region is actually not all that important, since the
density there is far too low to imprint any spectral features.
Another interesting difference is seen in the transition zone, where the PK04 calculation
contains very hot streamers of shock-heated gas. We do not model this non-radiative
heating mechanism, and so our wind does show these structures. Again, this difference
does not affect the simulated spectra or our wider conclusions, since this region is fully
ionized in both cases.
Finally, a much more important difference is in the warm equatorial flow. This region
lies behind the dense failed wind region which is very cold all three calculations. In
PK04, the ionization parameter was used to calculate the temperature in the model. The
ionization parameter, in turn, was calculated using the X-ray luminosity of the central
source, attenuated by electron scattering opacity and distance. In the dense equatorial
flow, this estimate of the ionization parameter is very low, and the treatment used in
PK04 (described in detail in Proga et al. 2000) yields unrealistically low temperatures. In

such cases, they assumed that the gas would be in local thermodynamic equilibrium, and
the temperature was set to be equal to the temperature of the disk below it. However, our
more detailed radiative transfer treatment permits photons to scatter around the failed
wind, and these scattered photons turn out to be the dominant source of ionization
and heating in the equatorial flow region. We therefore obtain temperatures of a few
hundred thousand Kelvin for this region, significantly hotter than in PK04, but similar
to the temperatures obtained by SP10, whose calculation also allowed for scattering. We
discuss the critical consequences of this finding in Section 7.4.

7.3.4 Ionization parameter
In Figure 7.8, we show the ionization parameter U , computed for each cell in the model
based on the actual photon packets that have passed through the cell. The standard
definition of U is
4r20n(H)c
, (7.1)
where Q(H) is the number of photons emitted by the source per second, r0 is the distance
from the illuminated cloud to the source, and n(H) is the number density of hydrogen.
Thus U is simply the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons, n(H), to the num-
ber density of hydrogen atoms. We explicitly track this information in our simulation,
and so our version of U for each cell is given by
n(H)
. (7.2)
In the optically thin case, both definitions will give identical values of U . However, our
version self-consistently takes account of any absorption between the source and the cell,
along with additional photons which may scatter into the cell from other lines of sight.
Figure 7.8 shows immediately why we do not have any C iv in the wind. In order
for a significant fraction of carbon ions to be found in this ionization stage, we require
log(U)  2 (Higginbottom et al. 2013). There are no parts of the wind where this is
true. There are also significant implications of this ionization parameter distribution
on the self-consistency of the hydrodynamic model, since efficient line driving is only
possible for significantly lower values of ionization parameter than we predict for the
outflowing parts of the simulation. We discuss this further below.
7.4 Discussion
We are now in a position to consider some key aspects and consequences of our results
in more detail. First, we will attempt isolate the cause of the discrepancy between the
temperature structure and ionization state found by PK04 and those calculated above.
Second, we will look at the the way in which photons actually propagate through the
168 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model

contours show the underlying density of the model.
PK04 model in order to address what the structure of a viable line-driven disk wind
might be. Third and finally, we will discuss the implications of our study for dynamical
simulations of line-driven winds.
7.4.1 Why is the wind hotter and more ionized than predicted by
PK04?
There are several key differences between the calculation of the temperature and ioniza-
tion state of the wind in PK04 and that described above:
 Input spectrum: PK04 used a 10 keV Bremsstrahlung spectrum to compute both
the ionization parameter and the temperature of the wind; by contrast, we have
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 169
used an observationally motivated AGN spectrum that includes ionizing radiation
associated with both the accretion and a central X-ray source.
 Wind radiation: in our model, photons produced by the wind itself are able to
interact with (e.g. ionize) other parts of the outflow; in PK04, the wind was
assumed to be transparent to its own cooling radiation.
 Scattering: in PK04, the local radiation field at each point in the wind was as-
sumed to be dominated by direct radiation from the central engine, with electron
scattering treated as a purely absorptive process; here we take full account of all
opacity mechanisms and in particular we track the propagation of scattered photons
through the flow.
To assess the relative importance of these effects, Figure 7.9 shows the distribution of the
ionization parameter throughout for two additional test cases. The ionisation parameter
is a useful parameter to compare here, since it largely defines the ionization state of the
wind and is also used to compute the temperature and line-driving force in PK04.
The upper right panel in Figure 7.9 shows the ionization parameter as presented in
Figure 1 in PK04. However, we have converted the definition of the ionization param-
eter adopted in PK04 () to that adopted here (U), using their approximate formula
log(U) = log() 1.75. Comparing this to Figure 7.8, we immediately see that our val-
ues of U are consistently higher than those found by PK04.
To test how much of this difference is due simply to the differences between the adopted
illuminating spectra, we have rerun our simulation, with the accretion disk removed as a
radiation source and with the X-ray spectrum modified to a power-law that approximates
the 10 keV Bremstrahlung spectrum assumed in PK04, i.e. F  0. This X-ray spectrum
is normalized so as to give the same luminosity over the 2-10 keV range as the PK04
SED, and the high-frequency cutoff of the Bremsstrahlung spectrum is approximated by
truncating the power law at 10 keV. This input spectrum is used for all three of the new
calculations shown in Figure 7.9.
The ionization parameter calculated for the wind in the absence of a disk radiation
field is shown in the upper left panel of Figure 7.9. Based on this, we can conclude
170 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model
Figure 7.9: The upper right panel shows the ionization parameter from PK04
(scaled from their definition  to ours via log(U) = log() 1.75). The remain-
ing three panels all show results from python calculations that use an approx-
imation to the 10 keV bremsstrahlung spectrum assumed in PK04 as the only
source of photons. The two panels on the left are based on the same simula-
tion, but the upper panel shows U calculated taking into account all photons in
the cell, whilst the lower panel only counts photons arriving directly from the
X-ray source (i.e. unscattered photons). The lower right panel shows U from a
calculation where the wind is permitted to cool via radiative processes, but the
resulting photons are not actually produced and tracked in the simulation. This
is analogous to the approximation made in PK04. Here, again, only unscattered
photons are used to calculate U .
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 171
that the difference between the ionizing SED adopted by us and in PK04 is the main
reason for the discrepancy between the estimates of U in the polar wind regions. This
is unsurprising since the wind is optically thin in these directions. However, the critical
region for the viability line-driving and the production of broad UV absorption lines is
the warm, equatorial outflow. Here, U is uniformly very small in the PK04 data, but
remains at log(U)> 2 outside the dense failed wind region even in our simulation without
disk photons. This ionization parameter is too high to support line driving (Stevens and
Kallman 1990).
In the lower left panel of Figure 7.9, we show U from the same no-disk calculation, but
taking into account only photons that have not undergone any scattering events, i.e. only
photons arriving directly from the central source or emitted by the wind. We now see a
moderate decrease in U throughout the whole model except the bulk of the failed wind.
This is consistent with the failed wind efficiently scattering photons into the polar regions
in our standard calculation, and with regions shielded by the failed wind being affected
strongly by radiation scattered around the shield. However, the ionization parameter in
the warm, equatorial outflow region is still higher than in PK04 and still too high for
efficient line driving.
Finally, in PK04, the wind is able to cool via radiative processes, but is assumed to be
optically thin to its own radiation. We therefore carry out another no-disk, unscattered-
photons-only calculation, but now also disable wind emission in the python simulation.
More specifically, the wind is still allowed to cool via radiative processes, but no photons
are produced that could interact with other parts of the wind. The result is shown in
the lower right panel of Figure 7.9. Only in this last calculation, which most closely
mimics the approximations made in PK04, does log(U) drop to a level where line driving
could become efficient. It should be noted that drawing this distinction between the
wind photons and scattered photons is largely artificial. Since python treats the wind
as being in radiative and thermal equilibrium, and there are no non-radiative heating
processes implemented (e.g. shock heating or magnetic reconnection) all photons that
reach the wind have originated in the disk or central source. Some will have scattered,
172 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model
whilst others have been absorbed and re-emitted. We call the latter wind photons, but
what we call scattering is really just a special case of absorption and re-emission.
7.4.2 The propagation of ionizing photons through the outflow: impli-
cations for line-driving
We have seen that taking account of wind emission, multiple scattering and including
the accretion disk as a source of ionizing radiation has resulted in an outflow that is too
highly ionized for line driving to work efficiently as an acceleration mechanism. However,
this does not mean that line driving could not produce an outflow at all. If one were
to compute a new step in the hydrodynamical calculation based on our new ionization
state, the line-driving forces, and hence the outflow structure, would certainly change
(relative to the same time step in PK04s original simulation). The key question is
whether the end result would be a total quenching of the wind or whether the flow might
adjust itself to a new configuration in which line driving can be effective again. A self-
consistent 3-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculation would be needed to answer
this question definitively, and we briefly comment on the prospects for this in Section 7.4.3
below. However, by considering the way in which ionizing radiation actually propagates
through the outflow, we can already comment on the general properties of any viable
line-driven disk wind model.
In Figure 7.10, we show some characteristics of the ionizing photons that reach three
particular cells in the wind. One cell (1 - marked with the triangle in the upper panel)
is in the highly ionized, low density part of the model and serves as a comparison to
the other two cells (2 - marked with a circle, and 3 - marked with a square), both of
which are in the outflowing part of the model. In PK04, cells 2 & 3 are characterized by
the relatively low ionization states required for efficient line driving. In our calculations,
these cells are highly ionized, so that line driving could not be effective in them. Also
shown in the upper panel are the starting locations of the ionizing photons emitted by
the wind that pass through cell 2. Broadly speaking, these photons turn out to originate
in the outside skin of the failed wind. This region sees and absorbs a significant fraction
of the ionizing radiation generated by the disk and the X-ray source. Since the wind is

radiation field in three cells. The top panel shows the location of the three cells
(filled symbols), along with the starting locations of wind generated photons
that reach cell 2 (open circles). The underlying colours show the density of the
model - note that the colour scale here is different to that used in Figure 7.2.
The two straight lines in this plot correspond to two specific sightlines: the top
line marks i ' 26.5, the sightline passing from the origin through cell 1; the
bottom line marks i ' 58, a sightline passing through the transition region
between the failed wind and the polar regions of the outflow. The middle panel
shows the launch radius of the disk generated photons that reach the three cells
(plot symbols match the symbols used to mark each cell in the top panel). The
proportion of photons originating from the central X-ray source is also shown
via the isolated symbols near the left hand side of the plot. The bottom panel
shows the initial launch angle (relative to the vertical axis) of the same photons.
The vertical lines mark the two angles also shown as sightlines in the top panel.
In the lower two plots, the ordinate is normalised to the total number of photons
reaching the cell in question.
174 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model
assumed to be in radiative and thermal equilibrium, all of this absorbed energy must be
locally re-emitted.
The middle panel in Figure 7.10 shows the distribution of the initial launch radii of the
ionizing disk photons that pass through our test cells. The detached symbols near the
left-hand-side of the plot show the corresponding fraction of photons emitted by the
central X-ray source for comparison. We can see immediately that, for all cells, the
majority of ionizing photons arise in the inner parts of the accretion disk. In PK04,
the region above this part of the disk was outside the computational domain, and so
it is empty in our calculation as well. Photons generated in this part of the disk are
therefore able to reach the wind without attenuation. In the hydrodynamic calculation,
this was done for reasons of computational efficiency, but it is also physically reasonable,
since the temperature and ionization state of the gas above this part of the disk would
likely be too high to permit efficient line driving. Nonetheless, the additional failed
wind region that would likely result if this region was included in the simulation would
certainly modify the spectrum incident on the rest of the wind and might result in a lower
ionization state there. Extending the computational domain down to the innermost parts
of the disk would therefore be an important next step in understanding line-driven winds.
Useful steps towards this have already been taken in radiation-(magneto)hydrodynamic
simulations of accretion disks (e.g. Ohsuga and Mineshige 2011; Jiang et al. 2013).
The middle panel of Figure 7.10 also shows that the launch radius distribution of ionizing
photons is similar for all three test cells, even though two of the cells (nos. 2 and 3) are
located in the shadow of the failed wind region, as seen from the central engine. Thus the
failed wind does not provide an effective shield from ionizing radiation. As already shown
in Figure 7.6 and discussed in Section 7.3, this is because scattering allows photons to
reach parts of the flow that would otherwise be shadowed. Interestingly, the radiation
field in cells 2 and 3 also includes some photons generated in the outer parts of the disk;
for example, about 10% of the ionizing photons reaching cell 3 come directly from the
disk beneath it. This is possible because the outflow density and opacity has dropped
significantly at these larger radii.
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 175
Finally, the lower panel of Figure 7.10 shows the distribution of launch angles (relative to
the vertical axis) for all ionizing photon packets produced by the disk and central X-ray
source that ultimately pass through the three test cells. The direct sightline from the
origin to cell 1 corresponds to an angle of 26.5, and the launch angle of most photons
that reach this cell is, in fact, close to this value. However, a significant fraction of the
ionizing photons in this cell were originally emitted in a more equatorial direction and
only reach the cell after scattering off the failed wind. These photons produce the hump
near 65 in the photon launch angle distribution for cell 1. Cells 2 and 3 (which lie at a
sightline from the origin of 80) are shielded from the direct radiation produced by the
central X-ray source and inner disk by the failed wind. The ionizing photons reaching
these cells instead exhibit a wide distribution of initial launching angles, peaking around
58. This direction is marked by the lower straight line in the top panel of Figure 7.10.
Photons taking this initial path interact with the hot transition region of the flow, i.e.
the upper skin of the failed wind. When they enter this region, the optical depth along
their trajectory is much higher than that perpendicular to it, so they are preferentially
scattered both up into the polar regions and down into the parts of the flow behind the
failed wind. Photons with initially more equatorial directions will initially strike the
failed wind region. A significant fraction of these photons will be reflected back across
the inner disk and enter the transition region on the other side of the grid. Some of these
photons will then once again be scattered in the outflow region behind the failed wind.
This analysis suggests that it is the transition region (i.e. region B in Figures 7.1 and
7.2) that is mainly responsible for redirecting ionizing photons into the outflow regions
behind the failed wind. This applies not only to photons emitted by the central X-ray
source and inner disk, but also to photons produced by the front of the wind itself.
Thus, even though the failed wind is doing its job in preventing direct illumination from
reaching the outflow behind it, ionizing photons can get around it via scattering in the
transition region.
How might we expect the outflow to respond? Given the over-ionization of the outflow
behind the failed wind, it seems likely that the outflow in this region would also fail.
This would result in a larger failed wind region - perhaps reducing the ionization state of
176 Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model
the material behind this extended block. However, since the failed wind is already highly
optically thick in the radial direction, and since scattered and reprocessed radiation is
already dominant in the shielded region, this effect is likely to be quite small.
Given the importance of the transition region in redirecting ionizing photons into other-
wise shielded parts of the flow, it seems likely that it is this region that would have to be
modified to allow the formation of a line-driven outflow. In the PK04 model, the geome-
try of this transition region allows photons that would otherwise pass over the outflow to
be efficiently scattered down into it. If this transition region instead had a more curved
upper surface profile, photons missing the failed wind could not be scattered so easily
back down into the outflow behind this region. Is it plausible that the flow might adjust
itself to form such a geometry? Possibly. In the PK04 model, line driving already only
just works in the transition region, since the ionization state there is fairly high. Given
the even higher ionization state we predict for this region, line driving would likely fail
completely, causing the material to drop back to the disk, perhaps forming the geometry
required to produce an effective shield. However, fully self-consistent calculations would
be required to test this idea.
7.4.3 Implications for hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven winds
The analysis we have carried out on the PK04 geometry has clearly shown that repro-
cessing and scattering effects have a significant  and actually dominant  effect on the
ionization state of the wind. This, in turn, must strongly affect the efficiency of the line
driving mechanism itself. The clear conclusion from our results is therefore that these
radiative effects must somehow be incorporated into hydrodynamic simulations.
The most obvious way to achieve this would be to carry out a full radiative transfer and
ionization calculations after each time step of the hydrodynamic simulation. However,
the main radiative transfer calculation presented here takes about 20 hours of processing
time on 192 processors of the Southampton University Iridis supercomputer. Thus, even
if such a scheme could be implemented, it is not at all clear that it is computationally fea-
sible at this time. Nonetheless, it is important to develop at least an approximate method
along these lines in order to obtain robust results from line-driven wind simulations.
Chapter 7 RT simulations for a hydrodynamically generated wind model 177
It should be noted that it is not only full hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven winds
that have treated radiative transfer in a simplified manner. Calculations such as those
presented in Risaliti and Elvis (2010) and Nomura et al. (2013) also neglect scattered
and reprocessed radiation and give rise to wind solutions similar to that presented in
PK04. It is therefore likely that similar effects would be seen in these models.
7.5 Conclusions
We have presented results from comprehensive radiative transfer and photoionization cal-
culations for the line-driven AGN disk wind predicted by the hydrodynamic simulations
carried out in PK04. These simulations were computationally expensive and therefore
treated the radiative transfer and ionization in a simplified manner. Here, we have fo-
cused on one snapshot from the hydrodynamic calculation and carried out a much more
detailed Monte-Carlo simulation of the interaction between the AGN radiation field and
the outflow.
Our main result is that the ionization state of the outflow is much higher than estimated
by PK04, to the extent that line-driving would become inefficient. The over-ionized flow
also no longer produces the broad UV absorption lines that are the key observational
tracers of disk winds in AGN/QSOs. The main reason for this change in the predicted
ionization state of the flow is that self-shielding becomes much less effective when ra-
diative transfer effects are fully accounted for. More specifically, the failed wind region
that protects the outflow from over-ionization in the simulations of PK04 can actually
be circumnavigated by ionizing photons via scattering and reprocessing.
We conclude that hydrodynamic disk wind simulations need to take account of scattering
and reprocessing in order to robustly assess the viability of line driving as an acceleration
mechanism. This should ideally take the form of a self-consistent treatment, in which the
radiative transfer and hydrodynamics are calculated simultaneously. However, the kind
of post-processing approach we have used here is at least useful in validating purely
hydrodynamic models. For outflows driven non-radiatively, it already provides a means
to self-consistently predict the observational characteristics of the flow.

Summary and suggestions for future
8.1 Summary
In this thesis, we have described the work carried out over the past three and a half years
to investigate the viability of disk-winds as a physical explanation for the origin of the
BALs seen in 10-20% of quasars with the long term goal of producing a unified model
for the broad emission and absorption line regions in quasars.
The first section of this work was to extend the capabilities of python, our radiative
transfer and ionization code to produce reliable results for AGN. The first modification
was to include a source of X-ray photons. This was observationally motivated - all AGN
show non-thermal X-ray emission, although the source is not fully understood. The
inclusion of this extra source of ionizing photons necessitated a significant modification
of the ionization scheme used by python. Originally, python used a computationally
fast method for calculating the ionization state of the plasma, but this method is only
accurate if the mean intensity can be adequately represented by a dilute blackbody.
This is not the case if an X-ray power law is present. We therefore implemented a
more flexible scheme, which models the mean intensity using power law and exponential
components. This spectral model is then used to calculate the ionization state. We
180 Chapter 8 Summary and suggestions for future work
compared the ionization state calculated by python using the new scheme with the
output of cloudy for a simple geometry, and demonstrated excellent agreement for ions
of interest.
The second modification was to include extra heating and cooling mechanisms required to
properly calculate the temperature of a plasma illuminated by X-rays. Compton effects
were the most important, and, again, comparisons with cloudy show that python
obtains good results for simple geometries where the capabilities of the two codes overlap.
Armed with the updated version of python the first application of the code was to in-
vestigate a simple wind geometry. The aim was to see if BAL features could be produced
from a disk wind at all, and if so what physical properties were required. We therefore
began by constructing a smooth, biconical disk wind, with physical parameters based
on observed quantities wherever possible. We demonstrated that BAL features could in-
deed be produced in this benchmark disk wind model. Moreover, we found that winds
producing strong BAL features can potentially provide feedback at the levels required to
influence the evolution of their host galaxies.
There are, however, two main challenges for our benchmark model. First, it is very
sensitive to the X-ray luminosity of the central source, with realistic values of OX
tending to overionize the wind. Increased mass loss through the wind (Mwind) is able to
partially recover the required ionization state, but this introduces other difficulties, such
as the self-consistency of a model where the accretion rate is significantly less than the
outflow rate. Second, line emission is seen only at a relatively low level in our model.
This is important, since if QSO unification is to be achieved via disk winds, they must
produce strong line emission for sightlines where no absorption is seen.
This initial work was promising, but we were also interested in investigating a more
realistic wind model. Hydrodynamic wind models naturally produce density variations
in the outflow, and one might expect denser regions to maintain lower ionization states
in the presence of a given radiation field. In addition, increasing density increases the
emission measure of the plasma, thereby increasing line emission. Thus, a more realistic
wind could potentially solve both of the shortcomings of the simple wind at the same
time.
Chapter 8 Summary and suggestions for future work 181
We therefore used python to compute the ionization structure of a line-driven disk
wind model first reported in Proga and Kallman (2004) and also produced synthetic
spectra for this model. The results were very interesting, although not what we were
initially hoping for. The original work used a necessarily simplified ionization and ra-
diative transfer scheme, however the more complete RT treatment provided by python
predicted that the outflow was very highly ionized. This meant that no BAL features
were seen, but more importantly line driving would fail to provide the expected acceler-
ation in that model. This is an important result, and whilst it does not suggest that line
driving cannot be the driving mechanism for disk winds it does demonstrate that one
needs to incorporate radiative transfer and ionization calculations into the hydrodynamic
simulation.
8.2 Future work
The work done to date represents the first steps in a long-term effort to understand the
promises and limits of the disk wind paradigm in explaining the properties of quasars.
Future work will take place in three parallel strands.
First, whilst the physics included in the current version of python produces good results
in most parts of a typical wind model, there are a few shortcomings that should be
addressed in future versions. Some of the more pressing issues and likely solutions are
described in Section 8.2.1.
Second, kinematically defined disk wind models like that introduced in Section 6.2 are a
good way of gaining physical insight. The calculations of simple geometries tend to be
relatively fast, and therefore large parameter spaces can be efficiently searched. Section
8.2.2 briefly describes some possible future directions.
Finally, we have demonstrated the importance of including detailed RT and ionisation
calculations in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of disk winds. This is an exciting
area of research, and we are well placed to make a significant contribution to it. We will
discuss possible starting points in section 8.2.3.
182 Chapter 8 Summary and suggestions for future work
8.2.1 Extending the capabilities of python
8.2.1.1 Lines and levels
One of the major shortcomings of the benchmark kinematic disk wind model was the
weakness of the emission lines. In section 6.5.2, we argue that the relatively low covering
factor of the wind means that resonance line scattering cannot contribute as much to the
lines as in CVs. Assuming that model is at all realistic, we must therefore seek alternative
mechanisms for the production of lines.
Collisionally excited line emission is implemented in python via a two-level atom model,
as described in section 4.3.4, with the level populations set via the assumption of a dilute
blackbody radiation field. We see from the comparisons with cloudy discussed in section
5.4.3 that the overall line luminosity is about right, but this is not to say that the energy
comes out in the correct lines. The approximation used in python for populating the
levels linked by a line is that the mean intensity can be modelled by a dilute blackbody.
This is not the case for our AGN model, and this inconsistency may be a reason for the
lack of thermal line emission for resonance lines.
The new ionization scheme maintains a model of the mean intensity in each cell, and,
in principle, this could be used to calculate radiatively populated level populations in
a more self consistent manner. In addition, this scheme could be used to calculate the
partition function for each ionic species, which could improve the ionization calculations.
There is also a second, unmodelled, source of line radiation: recombination cascades.
We permit recombination to excited levels via the  term in the ionization equation,
but we do not explicitly follow the radiative cascade as the excited ion relaxes to the
ground state. Such cascades are an important source of line emission (particularly for the
Balmer lines of hydrogen), but including it as a process is not simple. In order to capture
the process, one needs to deal with collisional and radiative excitation and de-excitation
between all of the levels in an ion. This work is underway for hydrogen and helium, via
the macro-atom formalism described by Lucy (2002, 2003). It is possible that this work
could be extended to include some important ions of other elements, but a full treatment
for all ionic species would prove very computationally expensive.

8.2.1.2 Improved disk models
The accretion disk model used in python for the models presented here are all based
upon the radial temperature distribution from a thin disk model. This is a reasonable
first approximation, but the spectra of real AGN suggest that modifications to this model
should be considered.
One frequently observed departure from the thin disk spectrum is the so called soft X-ray
excess. The excess refers to radiation below 1 keV, which lies above the extrapolation
of the power law seen at higher energies. The highest frequency radiation produced by
an accretion disk is set by the temperature of the innermost annulus, and, for SMBH
of M  108 M, this is around a few times 104 K. A blackbody with this temperature
peaks in the EUV, and cannot explain the soft excess. Done et al. (2012) suggest a model
for the soft excess where only the outer parts of the disk produce blackbody emission.
At smaller radii, they find that Compton upscattering from the disks own atmosphere
can reprocess EUV from the inner disk into soft X-rays, explaining the excess. A simple
modification of the disk to reproduce this model has been tested in python and could
be included.
Another possible shortcoming of our disk model arises when we have large outflow mass
fluxes. Knigge (1999) discusses the possible impact of mass loss via a wind on the tem-
perature distribution of an accretion disk. Again, such a scheme could be implemented
in python.
Finally, python does not at present include general relativistic (GR) effects such as
the gravitational redshift of photons due to the central SMBH. Gravitational redshift
can actually produce a secondary line driving force as the photon frequency changes
(Dorodnitsyn 2003). In principle these effects can be included, although more complex
GR effects such as light-bending would be more challenging.
8.2.1.3 Other photoioniziation and recombination processes
As mentioned in section 5.3.4, there are several other ionization and recombination pro-
cesses that affect astrophysical plasmas in the kind of state we want to model. These are
184 Chapter 8 Summary and suggestions for future work
Auger ionization, charge exchange and possibly three-body recombination. The current
ionization scheme is based upon a computationally fast approximate Saha formulation,
and it is possible to fairly easily include extra processes that link adjacent states. This
has already been done for dielectronic recombination. However, this procedure is harder
to implement for Auger ionization, since it links non-adjacent ionic stages, or for charge
exchange, which links ions of different elements. Furthermore, the calculation of rate
coefficients to implement such processes actually removes the computational efficiency
that was the original motivation for the scheme.
The next stage to improve the ionization state calculations of python is almost certainly
to move to a full rate-equation scheme, albeit still based upon spectral models for the
mean intensity in a cell. Specifically, this would involve the construction of a matrix of
rate coefficients, which can link any ion to any other ion. This is then solved via a matrix
inversion operation, still requiring an iteration on ne.
8.2.2 Kinematic models
Whilst there are many competing models of disk winds, models defined using a simple
parametric approach are a good way of gaining insight that can be applied more widely.
This was the reasoning behind the kinematic model described in Chapter 6. A possi-
ble next stage of this research strand is to address the two shortcomings seen in that
benchmark model.
In order to maintain a moderate ionization state in the presence of high X-ray luminosi-
ties, many previous studies have included a dense shielding region into their models
(e.g. Murray and Chiang 1995). We could do the same, either as a separate element,
or by finding a wind geometry which naturally produces such a shield (the dense base
of a wind with slow acceleration is a likely candidate). If this takes the form of an ex-
tra, dense component, then it may also produce the enhanced line emission required to
address unification issues.
The great benefit of simple kinematically defined models is the speed with which simu-
lations proceed. Once a successful geometry is discovered, a grid of models with varying
Chapter 8 Summary and suggestions for future work 185
parameters can be calculated, thereby producing an atlas of observational signatures of
different classes of wind solutions. In principle this would permit a statistical investiga-
tion linking disk wind geometries with the proportions of different classes and subclasses
of AGN. This is a long term goal.
8.2.3 Hydrodynamic models
In chapter 7, we showed the results of a detailed RT calculation on a hydrodynamic disk
wind model. The ionization state of the wind was shown to be too high for efficient
line-driving, which called into question the self-consistency of the original calculation.
We also suggested how the wind might respond to this changed ionization state - it is
distinctly possible that a new stable outflow could result, albeit with a different geometry.
An exciting next step to this project would be to take the wind model with its new
ionization state, and feed this back into the hydrodynamic simulation to see how it
responds. Solving the problems of how to do this would pave the way for a linked RT
/ hydrodynamic simulation, where after each hydro step (or several steps) an RT step
is calculated, which would update the ionization state of the wind. This would permit
a fully integrated radiation hydrodynamic simulation of AGN disk winds to be carried
