Abstract
A search for heavy exotic diboson resonances decaying to ``qq final states is
presented using pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 20.3 fb1 at
s = 8 TeV collected between April and December
2012. No significant excess of data events over the predicted Standard Model
background is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the
product of the production cross-section and the branching ratio for spin-2 Kaluza-
Klein gravitons predicted by the bulk Randall-Sundrum model and for Extended
Gauge Model W  bosons. These results are subsequently combined with limits
obtained from searches using the ```, `qq and qqqq final states, and new mass
limits are set on both signal models.

Preface
From 2011 to present the author has been a member of the High Energy Physics
Group at The University of Manchester, and a member of The ATLAS Collabora-
tion. During this time the author contributed to the development and validation
of electron triggers applied to the Inner Detector and worked on a number of ex-
otic analyses specialising on the implementation of the statistical interpretation.
A search for resonant ZZ  ``qq was performed using a partial 8 TeV dataset
collected by the ATLAS detector. The results of this analysis were published in
the form of a conference note [1].
A larger updated dataset was used to perform a similar analysis in the ``qq
channel, searching for resonant ZZ and WZ production. The results of this
analysis were published in The European Physical Journal C [2]. This analysis is
described in detail in section 5.
A combination of this latter analysis was performed with similar searches in
the qqqq, `qq and ``` final states using the same dataset. Preliminary results
of this combination were published in a conference note [3], and updated results
are due to be submitted to a peer reviewed journal in the immediate future.
Details of this combination are given in section 6.
Introduction
The Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete, and many possible exten-
sions to the model predict the existence of new particles. This thesis describes the
search for both charged and neutral resonances at the TeV scale that decay into
vector boson pairs. The large resonance masses probed result in highly boosted
topologies, and new boson tagging techniques are employed. The dataset used for
the analyses presented here corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb1
and was collected using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a
centre of mass energy of
s = 8 TeV.
The contents of this thesis are arranged in the following manner. Section 2
presents a brief overview of the Standard Model and of the exotic extensions that
are used as benchmark models. The designs of the Large Hadron Collider and the
ATLAS detector are described in section 3. Section 4 describes the reconstruction
of signals recorded by the detector into physics objects used in the analyses. The
search performed for resonant V Z  ``qq production, where V represents either
a W or Z boson, is presented in detail in section 5. Similar diboson resonance
searches were performed by the ATLAS collaboration in the ```, `qq and qqqq
final states. The combination of these with the ``qq analysis is presented in
section 6. Finally in section 7 a summary is given of the work contained within
this thesis.
The Standard Model and Beyond
2.1 Overview of the Standard Model
The Standard Model (SM) is currently the best framework for modelling the prop-
erties and interactions of fundamental particles and is one of the most rigorously
tested theories in physics [4]. There are four fundamental forces, electromagnetism
(EM), weak interaction, strong interaction and gravitation, of which the SM de-
scribes the interactions of the first three.
For the three forces described in the SM, interactions between particles are
mediated by integer spin particles (bosons). The photon, , is responsible for
electromagnetic (EM) interactions, the W and Z bosons mediate the weak force,
and gluons, g, mediate the strong force. Particles that constitute matter have half
integer spin (fermions). Fermions are subdivided into the categories of quarks and
leptons. Quarks interact via the strong, weak and EM forces, whereas leptons
only interact via the weak and EM force. Leptons are further subdivided into
the electrically charged leptons and the neutral neutrinos. All fermions have
associated anti-particles that have the same properties, and have opposite charges.
Whether the neutrinos are their own antiparticles has yet to be determined and
is a topic of current research. Particles obtain mass through interactions with a

spin-0 Higgs field. The particles of the SM are summarised in figure 2.1.
The SM is a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which is gauge invariant under
local transformations defined by the SU(3)c  SU(2)L  U(1)Y group [5]. In
order to preserve the symmetry under these transformations, spin-1 fields must
be introduced to the Lagrangian, which give rise to associated vector bosons.
The SU(3)c component describes Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is
the theory of the strong force and requires eight gluons. The remaining SU(2)L
U(1)Y components together describe the electroweak force, and require a total of
four vector fields, which give rise to the , W and Z boson fields after electroweak
symmetry breaking.
2.2 Success and Failure of the Standard Model
The SM has been very successful in describing a wide range of observed phenom-
ena to high precision as shown in figure 2.2. Despite this success, there are a
number of known failings that require the introduction of new physics.

The SM is incapable of describing gravitational interactions. In a vast ma-
jority of situations where the SM is applied the masses involved are sufficiently
small that the effect of gravity is negligible. In the very early universe, particles
had sufficient energy to cause gravity to no longer be negligible. To accurately
describe the evolution of the universe under these conditions, a new theory is
required.
Cosmological observations have shown that approximately 69% of the universe
comprises dark energy, and 26% comprises dark matter, which are absent from
the SM [7]. This matter is assumed to only interact weakly with the known fun-
damental particles. There are a number of extensions to the SM which introduce
new particles that could be dark matter candidates.
An additional question that remains unanswered in the SM is the hierar-
chy problem. Since the Higgs boson mass is close to the electroweak scale of
 100 GeV, contributions to its mass due to loop corrections from massive par-
ticles should lead to the Higgs boson having a mass close to the Planck scale
of 1018 GeV. One way to resolve this is by fine tuning the coupling parameters
of the Higgs boson to the SM particles, such that the contributions which have
values close to the Planck scale cancel. The extremely high level of precision
required for this cancelling is considered to be unnatural. There are numerous
extensions to the SM that introduce new physics at the TeV scale such as SUper
SYmmetry (SUSY) [4], which lead to detectable signatures in the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC).
2.3 Beyond the Standard Model
There are a large number of proposed extensions to the SM, each potentially
having a large number of tunable parameters leading to an extremely large theory
space. Searches for new physics are performed using benchmark models, and the
results applied to a broad theory parameter space. The benchmark models which
are considered here are the bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, and the Extended
Gauge Model (EGM).
2.3.1 Bulk Randall-Sundrum Graviton
A possibility for new physics resides in the production of a bulk RS graviton,
which is a massless spin-2 boson that mediates gravity [8, 9, 10, 11]. The RS
formulation of a graviton introduces a higher dimensional mechanism that offers
a possible solution to the hierarchy problem. The bulk consists of the three
observable spacial dimensions, one temporal dimension, and a single extra spacial
dimension. The metric for this extra spatial dimension is multiplied by a warp
factor which is a rapidly changing function of position in the extra dimension.
Subspaces of the bulk consisting of the three observable spacial dimensions and
the temporal dimension are referred to as a 3-brane.
The Planck brane is the location in the extra dimension where the massless
graviton is localised. In the RS1 model [12], the SM fields are confined to a
single 3-brane, called the TeV brane, and are incapable of propagating through
the extra dimension. In contrast, the bulk RS model allows the SM fields to
propagate through the bulk, and are each localised to a different 3-brane. The
relative couplings of the fields are determined by the overlap of the wave functions.
By tuning the overlap of the lepton and quark wave functions with the Higgs field,
the hierarchical nature of the masses of the three families can be accounted for.
In keeping with the nomenclature of the RS1 model, the collection of 3-branes
on which the SM fields are localised are often referred to singularly as the TeV
brane. In both the RS1 and bulk RS models, the observed large hierarchy is
generated due to the separation of the TeV brane and the Planck brane in the
presence of the exponential warp factor.
If the extra dimension is warped, the graviton is a bound state, and a Kaluza-
Klein (KK) ladder of excited graviton states G, would be observed, with the
lightest excited state having a mass close to the TeV scale. The geometry of the
extra dimensions results in the couplings between the SM fields and the excited
graviton states being a factor of 1015 stronger than to the ground state graviton,
which permits the production and detection of these excitations within the LHC.
Since the extra dimension is warped and the positions of the SM fields within
the bulk differ, the couplings of excited state gravitons and fermions is heavily
suppressed.
The governing parameter of this model is the curvature of the extra dimension,
k, divided by the reduced 4-dimensional Planck scale MPl given by,
M2Pl =
1 e2krc
, (2.1)
where M5 is the 5-dimensional Planck scale. The product of the energy scale of
the theory, k, and the radius of curvature of the extra dimension, rc, is  11.
The suppression of the couplings of the excited gravitons to fermions increases
with k/MPl. For this reason searches including leptonic final states typically
concentrate on the scenario k/MPl  0.1, whereas gauge boson final states are
sensitive to k/MPl  1. This case is considered within the analyses presented in
this thesis.
As the couplings between the graviton and fermions are suppressed, and gluon
distribution functions dominate over quark distribution functions at the LHC,
the dominant production channel for this model is gluon-gluon fusion. The large
coupling to gauge bosons leads to the G  WW and G  ZZ decay channels
being dominant, as shown in figure 2.3. For excited graviton states with masses
between 0.5 TeV and 2.5 TeV, the resonance width ranges from 3.7% to 6.2% of
the pole mass, where the pole mass of a particle is defined as the position of the
singularity in the propagator of the particle in perturbation theory.

2.3.2 Extended Gauge Model
The Sequential Standard Model (SSM) is a proposed extension to the SM, which
introduces additional heavy gauge bosons in a simple explorative manner [13].
The predicted charged and neutral bosons share similar properties to the SM W
and Z bosons, and so are referred to as W  and Z  bosons respectively.
W, Zq
W, Z
Figure 2.4: Feynman diagrams of the production and decay of the EGM W  boson
(left) and Z  boson (right).
The SSM bosons share the same relative couplings to SM fields as their SM
equivalents. For SSM bosons that are lighter than twice the mass of the SM W
boson, the dominant decay is into fermions. Once the mass of the new boson mV 
is sufficiently large that decaying into two gauge bosons is no longer forbidden,
the diboson branching ratios increase rapidly as m5V  . The dependence of the
diboson branching ratio on mV  is reduced to being linear by the introduction of
a mixing factor between the SSM bosons and the SM equivalents of
 = c
. (2.2)
The tunable coupling constant c is taken to be equal to 1 in the EGM case.
At the LHC the dominant production mechanism is through quark-antiquark
annihilation as shown in figure 2.4. For a W  boson with a mass above 0.5 TeV,
the resonance width is approximately 3.6% of the pole mass.
2.4 Monte Carlo Event Modelling
Monte Carlo (MC) event generators are used to simulate particle interactions [14].
In a hadron collider, a simulated event can be broken down into multiple distinct
processes.
The hard scatter process characterises an event, and is where the largest
momentum transfer occurs. The momenta of the partons inbound to this event
are described by a Parton Distribution Function (PDF), and perturbation theory
gives a probabilistic distribution of the momenta of the outgoing particles.
In the parton shower phase, partons that are outbound from the hard inter-
action repeatedly radiate additional colour charged particles. These particles in
turn radiate. As a particle continues to radiate, the momentum scale reduces
until perturbation theory is no longer valid.
In a proton-proton interaction alongside the hard process there are typically
multiple soft interactions. These lead to the production of parton showers in
addition to those originating from the hard scatter event.
Hadronisation occurs at low momentum scales, when partons produced in
showers can form bound states. Non-perturbative hadronisation models calculate
the formation of these bound states.
During the hadronisation process, heavy unstable resonances can be formed.
It is then necessary to model the decay of these unstable secondary particles.
To compare the simulated event to data, it is necessary to model the interac-
tion of the generated outbound particles with the material of the detector. This is
typically performed using Geant4 [15]. The event is then subject to a digitisation
procedure that models the detector response, providing a digital readout from
the simulated detector channels. The event now resembles data, and the same
reconstruction techniques can be applied.
ATLAS and the LHC
3.1 The Large Hadron Collider
The LHC [16, 17] operates at high energy and high luminosity, with proton-
proton collisions occurring at a centre of mass energy of
s = 8 TeV. Located at
the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), on the Franco-Swiss
boarder near Geneva, the LHC is contained within a 26.7 km circumference tunnel
 100 m underground, which formerly held the Large Electron-Positron (LEP)
experiment, between 1989 and 2000.
3.1.1 LHC Timeline
The initial concept of the LHC dates back to 1984, four years prior to the com-
pletion of the LEP tunnel. Construction was approved by the CERN Council
10 years later in December 1994 and construction ran between 1998 and 2008.
The two general-purpose detectors, CMS (The Compact Muon Spectrometer) [18]
and ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS), which were designed to probe a wide
range of new physics that may be present up to the TeV scale, were granted
approval in January 1997. The following month saw approval granted to ALICE
(A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [19], a more specialised detector to study
the strong interaction in the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions.
In September of the following year a fourth experiment, LHCb (Large Hadron
Collider beauty) [20], a single arm forward spectrometer to study heavy flavour
physics and the matter-antimatter asymmetry, was approved.
Construction of the LHC was completed in October 2008, and the first protons
successfully circulated the following month [21]. In November 2009 the LHC
exceeded the Tevatrons beam energy record and commenced a two week period
of data collection at a centre of mass energy of 2.36 TeV. After a brief technical
stop the main research programme began. The Run 1 data collection period
commenced in 2010 with two years of data taking with a collision energy of
7 TeV and a bunch spacing of 50 ns. The run continued through 2012, with an
increased collision energy of 8 TeV.
In 2013 the LHC entered its first Long Shutdown (LS), during which time
it was refitted in order to be capable of ultimately reaching a collision energy of
14 TeV. Beam tests commenced in March 2015 at a beam energy of 6.5 TeV, with
the first 13 TeV collisions occurring in May. The taking of data as part of Run 2
began in June with a collision energy of 13 TeV with an initial bunch spacing of
50 ns. The bunch spacing was subsequently reduced to 25 ns in August. Run 2 is
planned to continue until the end of 2018, during which time the centre of mass
energy increased to 14 TeV and is planned to deliver an integrated luminosity of
 100 fb1.
The second long shutdown will follow Run 2, during which time the LHC will
be refitted in order to achieve its ultimate design luminosity. Run 3 is scheduled
to commence in 2021 and continue until the end of 2023, with a centre of mass
energy of 14 TeV and a bunch spacing of 25 ns throughout. During Run 3 an
integrated luminosity of  350 fb1 is expected. The current proposed future
is to greatly increase the luminosity during a third long shutdown, which will
require almost three years starting at the end 2023. The resulting machine, the
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), would continue the pattern of long shutdown
followed by a physics run with Run 4 (2025), LS4 (2029), Run 5 (2030), LS5 (2032)
and Run 6 (2034) [22, 23]. During these three runs, the HL-LHC is planned
to reach a peak luminosity of  5  1034 cm2 s1, and deliver an integrated
luminosity of  3000 fb1.
3.1.2 Design of the CERN Accelerator Complex
The design and operation of the CERN accelerator complex, including the LHC is
here described. The analyses described in this thesis utilise data collected during
Run 2. For this reason, where details vary between runs, the specifications for
Run 2 are given.
The protons are accelerated through a complex of incremental accelerators
prior to being injected into the the LHC [24], as seen in figure 3.1. Initially
the protons are accelerated from an ion source, through the Linear Accelerator 2
(LINAC 2) up to an energy of 50 MeV and injected into the Booster. The Booster
is the first of three synchrotrons [25] accelerating protons prior to injection into
the LHC, and it has a radius of 25 m. Once the protons have reached a beam
energy of 1.4 GeV they are fed into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which further
accelerates them up to an energy of 26 GeV. Once at this energy, the protons
enter the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), which accelerates them to 450 GeV
prior to injection into the LHC [26].
The SPS injects protons into the LHC via TI2 and TI8, allowing the proton
beams to travel around the LHC clockwise and anticlockwise, respectively, in two
separate beam pipes. It takes approximately eight minutes to fill both beams,
after which the LHC continues to accelerate the beams using the superconduct-
ing Radio-Frequency (RF) cavities. During Run 1, a period of 20 minutes was
required to reach the maximum beam energy of 4 TeV.
The LHC comprises eight identical arcs that are approximately 3 km long, sep-

arated by long straight sections. Each of the four collider experiments, ATLAS,
CMS, LHCb and ALICE resides along one of the long straight sections, where the
counter-rotating beams cross and the protons can be collided. The proton beams
are made to follow the curvature of the arc sections by a dipole magnetic field
generated by a total of 1232 superconducting niobium-titanium (NbTi) magnets.
As the LHC accelerates the beams, the dipole magnets must be simultaneously
ramped from 0.53 T at injection to a maximum of 4 T for 4 TeV beams, and
intend to reach 8.6 T for 7 TeV beams.
Each of the two beams in the LHC consists of 1380 bunches of around 1011 pro-
tons, with a 50 ns bunch spacing for 8 TeV. This is due to increase to 2808 bunches
separated by 25 ns when running with a beam energy of 14 TeV. The RF cav-
ities are located at Point 4, between ALICE and CMS, and have a frequency
of 400 MHz and an electric field gradient of 5 MV m1. Once the beams have
reached peak energy, the RF cavities continue to provide approximately 10 keV
per proton each turn to account for losses through synchrotron radiation. In this
state, the beams are made to cross within the four main experiments and can
remain circulating for several hours.
3.2 The ATLAS Detector
The ATLAS detector is a general purpose particle physics detector intended for
the study of a wide range of potential new physics that may exist at the TeV
scale as well as for performing precision measurements of known phenomena [28,
29, 30, 31]. In order to facilitate this task the detector is required to be capable
 Tracking charged particles with a high precision and efficiency.
 Accurately measuring the energy of electrons, photons and hadrons.
 Precisely measuring the momenta of high energy muons.
The detector is constructed from three main subdetectors, the inner detector,
the calorimeter system and the muon spectrometer, which address these require-
ments. To achieve a high acceptance in both pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle,
these subdetectors are arranged within a barrel of concentric cylinders with disk
shaped end-caps as shown in figure 3.2. The unprecedented high collision energy
leads to the presence of high energy radiation. The high luminosity results in
this radiation having a high intensity. The detector is required to be capable of
operating in this environment.
3.2.1 Coordinate System
The ATLAS detector makes use of a right handed coordinate system with its
origin at the nominal Interaction Point (IP). The z-axis is defined along the anti-
clockwise beam direction and points towards what is referred to as the A-side, and
Figure 3.2: A cut-away schematic of the ATLAS detector [28].
away from the C-side. The x-axis points towards the centre of the LHC ring. The
y-axis points upwards, however due to the inclination of the x-z plane of the LHC
compared with the ground, the y-axis makes an angle of 0.704 with the vertical.
The x-y plane is often referred to as the transverse plane, through which the
azimuthal angle  is measured, with  = 0 falling parallel to the positive x-axis
in the range 0 6  < 2. The polar angle  is defined as the angle from the beam
direction such that  = 0 is parallel to the z-axis, and with 0 6  6 . Particle
trajectories are defined in terms of the polar angle  and the pseudorapidity ,
which is defined as
 =  ln
. (3.1)
Hence,  = 0 lies in the transverse plane, and  = ( = ) points along the
positive (negative) z-axis. When the mass of the particle cannot be neglected,
the rapidity y, given by
E + pz
E  pz
, (3.2)
is used. These are useful measures as the difference between two rapidities or
pseudorapidities are invariant under Lorentz transformations along the z-axis.
The distance R in - space is given by
+ ()
. (3.3)
Hard scatter events within the detector have minimal momentum in the trans-
verse plane, but in general have significant momentum along the z-axis. It is
therefore useful to use properties calculated in the transverse plane. The com-
ponent of a particles momentum in the transverse plane can be calculated using
the relation
pT = |p| sin . (3.4)
Similar to this transverse momentum, the transverse energy is defined as
ET = E sin . (3.5)
Particles produced outside of the acceptance of the detector, or which do not
interact in the case of neutrinos, can result in an imbalance in the total transverse
energy, which is denoted as EmissT . In the instance of a two-body decay, where one
of the decay products cannot be reconstructed, the invariant mass of the incident
particle cannot be reconstructed. If it is assumed that the missed decay product
is massless, then it is possible to use EmissT to calculate the transverse mass mT
using
T (1 cos( miss)), (3.6)
where  and ET correspond to the azimuthal angle and transverse energy of the
measurable decay product.
3.2.2 Magnet System
The ATLAS magnet system consists of four superconducting magnets; one solenoid
and three toroids as shown in figure 3.3. The barrel solenoid, with its axis parallel
to the beamline produces a 2 T magnetic field within the Inner Detector. The
barrel and end-cap toroids maintain 0.5 T and 1 T fields respectively, which are
required for the muon spectrometers.
Figure 3.3: Layout of the ATLAS magnet system, including the magnet windings and
tile calorimeter steel. The solenoid lies at the centre of the barrel surrounded by the
calorimeter and return yoke. The remaining coils outside of the calorimeter comprise
the barrel and end cap toroids [28].
3.2.2.1 Solenoid
The barrel solenoid, under nominal operating conditions, creates a field of 1.998 T
at its centre [28]. The design is optimised to minimise the quantity of mass
placed in front of the calorimeters, and in total contributes approximately 0.66
radiation lengths. This was in part achieved by containing the solenoid within the
same vacuum vessel as the calorimeter and thus removing the need for separating
vacuum walls. The superconducting single layer coil contains 1154 turns of an
aluminium stabilised NbTi conductor and is contained within a 12 mm thick
aluminium alloy support structure. A layer of 2 mm thick aluminium panels
is required as a heat shield between the solenoid and the Liquid Argon (LAr)
cryostat. The solenoid has an axial length of 5.8 m, inner radius of 1.23 m and
a thickness of 5 cm. The mass of the coil is 5.4 tonnes and the stored energy is
40 MJ.
3.2.2.2 Toroids
The barrel toroid is constructed from eight coils, each is contained within an
individual stainless steel vacuum vessel, and has a mass of 45 tonnes. The toroid
surrounds the calorimeter with inner and outer radii of 4.7 m and 10.1 m, and
a length of 25.3 m along the z-axis. The field within the toroid ranges between
0.2 T and 2.5 T, storing a total energy of 1.1 GJ.
The end-cap toroids, similar to the barrel toroid, each consist of eight coils.
Slotting between the coils of the barrel toroid, the end-cap toroids have inner and
outer radii of 0.83 m and 5.4 m respectively, and each measures 5.0 m along the
z-axis. Each toroid stores 250 MJ, with a field ranging between 0.2 T and 3.5 T.
3.2.3 Inner Detector
Located within the barrel solenoid, the Inner Detector (ID) is responsible for
tracking charged particles created in events, measuring their momenta and cal-
culating the location of vertices. The ID is constructed from the Pixel Detector,
the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT).
The layout is shown in figure 3.4. All three systems are split into two regions.
Within the barrel region they are located on concentric cylinders, while in the
end-cap region they are arranged into wheels perpendicular to the z-axis.
Figure 3.4: Cut-away view of the Inner Detector [32].
3.2.3.1 Pixel Detector
It is important to have a detector close to the interaction point that is capable
of tracking charged particles to a high precision in order to calculate the posi-
tion of both primary and displaced vertices, the latter being important for the
identification of b-hadrons and tau leptons. This role is performed by the Pixel
Detector. Due to the requirement for a high granularity around the vertex region,
the Pixel Detector utilises 80 million readout channels, which is about half that
of the whole of ATLAS [33, 34].
The Pixel Detector is composed of silicon detector modules divided into 50 m
by 400 m pixels. The barrel section contains three cylindrical layers, the inner-
most layer of which is located 5 cm from the IP and is often referred to as the
b-layer. The end-cap regions each have three disks and together with the barrel
region allow track reconstruction in the region || < 2.5.
3.2.3.2 Semiconductor Tracker
Surrounding the Pixel Detector and of similar design is the SCT. The require-
ments for high resolution in this region of the detector is lower than in the Pixel
Detector, so the geometry has been optimised to reduce cost while using the same
silicon semiconductor technology. The SCT contains four cylindrical layers in the
barrel and nine disks in each end-cap achieving coverage within || < 2.5
Each layer of the SCT has two strip layers, where a strip measures 6.4 cm by
80 m. These layers are offset by 40 mrad in order to resolve  and z (r and ) in
the barrel (end-cap), with one of the strip layers arranged parallel (perpendicular)
to the beamline. The results of the strip geometry are that the SCT has a position
resolution in the barrel (end-cap) in the  and z (r and ) plane of 17 m by
580 m and requires a total of 6.3 million readout channels.
3.2.3.3 Transition Radiation Tracker
The TRT is the outermost layer of the ID and provides r- and -z information
in the barrel and end-cap regions up to || < 2.0. Constructed from over 350,000
drift tubes, also known as straw tubes, it is designed to a lower cost and has a
lower material budget than both of the silicon detectors.
The straws are arranged parallel to the beam axis in the barrel region and
perpendicular in the end-caps. The straws have a 2 mm radius and are up to
144 cm long in the barrel region, and 27 cm long in the end-caps. They are
maintained at a temperature of 20C by a flow of CO2 around the TRT envelope.
The 31 m gold-plated tungsten anode is kept at ground potential, and the wall
of the tube with thickness of 35 m operates at a voltage of -1.530 kV. The
volume of the straw is filled with a gas mixture of 70% Xe, 27% CO2 and 3% O2
which becomes ionised when particles pass through it. The electric field causes
the electrons to drift to the anode, with a maximum collection time of 48 ns. The
closest approach of a track to the anode can be calculated from the drift time
with a resolution of 130 m. Despite the straws having a much lower resolution in
comparison to the other ID subsystems, the TRT still significantly improves the
overall position resolution of the ID due to tracks typically crossing 35-40 straws.
3.2.4 Calorimeters
The calorimetry system provides energy and position measurements of parti-
cles [35]. The calorimeters are capable of measuring the energy of all SM particles
except neutrinos, which traverse the detector without interacting, and muons,
which typically do not radiate a significant amount in the calorimeter. The
calorimeter is subdivided into the EM and hadronic calorimeters, which are ar-
ranged as shown in figure 3.5, extending to || = 3.2 and || = 4.9 in the barrel and
forward regions respectively. Both EM and hadronic calorimeters are constructed
from alternating layers of absorbing materials that initiate particle showers, and
sampling materials that perform the measurement of the showers. The sum of
energy deposited from a shower can then be used to infer the energy of the inci-
dent particles. In order for the calorimeters to perform a measurement affectively,
it is necessary for all the energy of the incident particle to be absorbed and to
minimise punch-through into the Muon Spectrometer. Conversely to the ID, the
calorimeter system therefore benefits from containing a large amount of material.
3.2.4.1 EM Calorimeter
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) measures the energy of electrons and
photons in the energy range 5 GeV to 5 TeV. It is divided into the barrel
(|| < 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < || < 3.2) regions, with the end-cap calorime-
ter subdivided into two coaxial wheels covering ranges of 1.373 < || < 2.5 and
2.5 < || < 3.2. Precision measurement is restricted to the region || < 2.5.
Layers of LAr sampler are sandwiched between the lead absorber in an accordion-
like pattern as seen in figure 3.6. The accordion shape allows for full  coverage
Figure 3.5: Cut-away view of the hadronic, electromagnetic and forward calorimeter
systems [36].
to be obtained without azimuthal gaps as well as ensuring that particles traverse
approximately the same amount of material independent of angle. The barrel re-
gion has a thickness greater than 22 X0, and the end-cap has a thickness greater
than 24 X0, where X0 is the radiation length.
The absorber causes incident electrons and photons to initiate electromagnetic
showers, a process in which electrons radiate photons, and photons pair produce
electrons. These shower constituents cause ions to be formed within the LAr. The
electrons from these ionisation events drift towards the kapton electrodes which
are held at 2000 V. The drift time is 450 ns, and thus spans the time of several
bunch crossings. This leads to the possibility that an event may have an out of
time pileup created by other bunch crossings. After noise has been accounted for,

of the Level 1 trigger.
the energy resolution of the ECAL is described by
B, (3.7)
where A, the stochastic sampling term, is 0.1 GeV
2 , and the constant B, which
describes cell level miscalibrations, is 0.007 [38].
For the precision region || < 2.5, the ECAL is segmented into three sections in
depth numbered from 1 to 3, and named front, middle, and back, moving outwards
from the beam axis. The granularities of the cells in these layers in  
space are 0.1 0.0031 for Layer 1, 0.025 0.025 for Layer 2, and 0.050 0.025
for Layer 3. The maximum of a shower typically occurs within the middle layer,
covering the area of approximately 20 cells.
The particles must pass through the ID before reaching the ECAL, which
accounts for between 0.5 and 2 radiation lengths. In order to accommodate the
energy loss due to upstream interactions, a 1.1 cm (0.5 cm) LAr pre-sampler
layer, located before the first layer of the barrel (end-cap), measures the position
and energy of the shower prior to entering the ECAL within || < 1.8.
3.2.4.2 Hadronic Calorimeter
The central most part of the hadronic calorimeter is the Tile Calorimeter (TileCal),
which is split into the barrel (|| < 1.0) and extended barrel (0.8 < || < 1.7) re-
gions, both of which occupy the region 2.28 m to 4.25 m radially from the beam
axis. Both the barrel and extended barrel are subdivided into three layers of steel
absorber and scintillating tiles, which are divided azimuthally into 64 modules.
Compared to the interaction length , the three layers have a thickness of 1.5 ,
4.1  and 1.8  in the barrel, and 1.5 , 2.6  and 3.3  in the extended barrel.
The granularity of the tiles in   space is 0.1 0.1 in the first two layers,
and 0.2 0.1 in the outermost layer, for both the barrel and extended barrel.
Wavelength shifting fibres read out from each side of each tile into two pho-
tomultiplier tubes. A trigger tower is used for triggering at Level-1, whereby a
sum of ET deposited in each layer of the ECAL and TileCal within a window in
  space of 0.1 0.1 is calculated.
The Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) is located in both end-caps behind
the ECAL in the region 1.5 < || < 3.2. There exists an overlap with both the
TileCal and the Forward Calorimeter (FCal). It uses the same LAr technology as
the ECAL, however, copper is used as the absorber. Each end-cap contains two
wheels, each wheel containing two layers split into 32 wedges each. The HEC has
a minimum of 0.372 m from the beam line, and a maximum radius of 2.03 m. The
granularity of the HEC in   space is 0.1 0.1 for || < 2.5, and 0.2 0.2
for || > 2.5
The FCal located in the far forward region (3.1 < || < 4.9) of both end-caps
is recessed 1.2 m from the ECAL front face to reduce neutron albedo in the ID
cavity. This limits the overall size and necessitates a high density design. In
each end-cap the FCal is 10  long, split into three modules. The first module
utilises a copper absorber, and is optimised for EM calorimetry. The remaining
two modules are optimised for hadronic calorimetry, using a tungsten absorber.
Each module has regularly spaced channels passing through parallel to the beam
axis. These contain electrodes surrounded by LAr, with channels in the first layer
being as small as 0.25 mm to avoid ion build-up. The FCal has a granularity in
  space of 0.2 0.2.
The energy resolution for the hadronic calorimeters is described by equa-
tion 3.7, with A = 0.5 GeV
2 and B = 0.03 for both the TileCal and HEC [39, 40],
and A = 1 GeV
2 and B = 0.1 for the FCal [41].
3.2.5 Muon System
Muons traverse the ID and calorimeters without depositing a significant portion
of their energy [42]. The Muon Spectrometer (MS) allows for the identification
of muons, and measures the deflection of muons through the toroidal magnets.
The momentum of muons is calculated from the combination of track information
from ID and MS. The MS does not require the mass between it and the beamline
to be minimised, as muons do not readily deposit energy and have a long lifetime
in comparison to the time taken to traverse the detector. For this reason the MS
forms the outermost layers of the detector, as shown in figure 3.7.
The magnetic field through which the muons are tracked is provided by the
barrel toroid for || < 1.4, and the end-cap toroids for 1.6 < || < 2.7. The tran-
sition region, 1.4 < || < 1.6, between the toroids has a field provided by a com-
bination of the two toroid systems. Approximately 1800 Hall sensors are used
to accurately monitor the field within the spectrometer. The MS comprises four
types of chamber, each arranged in layers of three, parallel to the beam axis in
the barrel region, and perpendicular in the transition and end-cap regions.
Figure 3.7: Cut-away of the ATLAS muon spectrometer [28].
The Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) provide precision track measurement in
the region || < 2.7. They have a relative alignment precision of 30 m, both
within the chamber towers and between adjacent towers. This alignment is mon-
itored by 12000 optical alignment sensors.
The Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) provide precision muon tracking within
2.0 < || < 2.7, though with a higher granularity than the MDT. They are multi-
wire proportional chambers in which the cathodes are segmented into strips.
This design is capable of withstanding the higher rate and background conditions
present in the end-caps [28].
The trigger system comprises Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) for || < 1.05,
and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) for 1.05 < || < 2.7. These chambers provide a
second coordinate for the muons, orthogonal to the precision tracking, and provide
a definite transverse momentum threshold necessary for effective triggering.
The momentum resolution of the MS has its minimum value of < 4% for
muons with pT  30 GeV, and > 12% for muons with pT > 1 GeV.
3.2.6 Forward Detectors
Measurement of the rate of elastic proton-proton scattering in the forward region
allows for the total interaction rate, and so luminosity, to be calculated [43]. To
perform this task two forward detectors are primarily used.
One of these is the LUminosity measurement using Cherenkov Integrating
Detector (LUCID) [44] comprises two modules, 17 m either side of the IP, covering
the pseudorapidity range 5.4 < || < 6.1. The modules contain 200 Cherenkov
counters each, and are capable of measuring luminosities up to 41033 cm2 s1.
The Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS (ALFA) [45] detector, which consists
of scintillating fibre trackers, is located 240 m from the IP, as close as 1 mm
to the beam axis in Roman Pot units. These measure the trajectories of protons
that have been elastically scattered through micro-radian angles in the Coulomb-
Nuclear interference region [46].
3.2.7 Trigger and Data Acquisition
The maximum bunch crossing rate the LHC is capable of delivering is 40 MHz,
with a total interaction cross-section of approximately 100 mb for a collision
energy of 8 TeV. It is only possible to record events at 300 Hz, and interactions
of interest have cross-sections around 1 pb. It is therefore necessary for each event
to quickly decide whether or not to record the data. This selection is performed
by the Trigger and Data AcQuisition (TDAQ) system, which comprises three
consecutive levels; Level-1 (L1), Level-2 (L2) and Event Filter (EF) as depicted
in figure 3.8.
The L1 trigger [47] is responsible for stepping the rate down from 40 MHz to

400 kHz. This is performed by providing limited information from the calorimeter,
muon and forward detectors to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP) in order
to identify electron, photon, jet and muon candidates, as well as specific event
features such as missing transverse energy [48]. The CTP outputs a single bit
Level-1 Accept (L1A), which triggers the event to be read from the pipelines of
the front end electronics. The pipeline storage holds the information for 2 s,
after which a decision must have been received. The maximum time of flight
for a particle within ATLAS is 0.75 s, and the maximum cable distance from a
detector to the dedicated L1 computing cluster is 80 m, resulting in 0.4 s taken
for the information to reach the CTP, and a further 0.4 s for the decision to
be transmitted back. This means that approximately 0.5 s processing time is
available before the pipeline storage overflows [49].
If an event passes the L1 trigger, the detector readout is passed to the High
Level Trigger (HLT), which comprises the two remaining TDAQ levels; L2 and
EF [50]. The L2 trigger receives the detector readout, along with information from
the L1 trigger defining Regions of Interest (RoIs), which contain the coordinates
and the nature of the interesting candidate or features which led to the selection
decision. From this information the L2 trigger takes approximately 40 s on
average to process an event, which reduces the rate from 400 kHz to 75 kHz.
Events passing the L2 trigger are transferred to an event building system. The
EF then uses information from the entire detector, taking on average 4 s to process
each event in a large computing farm. The final readout rate is approximately
300 Hz, requiring 1.3 MB per event.
3.3 Luminosity
The expected rate R of events resulting from a process with a cross-section ,
given the instantaneous luminosity L, is
R = L. (3.8)
The instantaneous luminosity is given by
nN2b fr
4xy
, (3.9)
where n is the number of bunches per beam, Nb is the number of protons per
bunch, fr is the revolution frequency of the bunches, and x and y describe
the transverse beam size. To maximise luminosity, the bunches are compressed
in the transverse plane to 16 m at the IP. For a beam energy of 4 TeV both
ATLAS and CMS achieved a luminosity of order 1034 cm2 s1, LHCb achieved
1032 cm2 s1, and ALICE 1030 cm2 s1.
The LHC commenced proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of

ATLAS was capable of recording 5.25 fb1 of the 5.61 fb1 delivered integrated
luminosity, with a peak luminosity of 3.65 1033 cm2 s1
The centre of mass energy was increased to 8 TeV for the 2012 run, with
proton-proton collisions taking place from April to December. During this pe-
riod 21.7 fb1 of integrated luminosity was recorded by ATLAS of the 23.3 fb1
delivered, with a peak luminosity of 7.73  1033 cm2 s1. The evolution of the
data collection for both the 2011 and 2012 runs is shown in figure 3.9.
Object Reconstruction
The charged particle hits and energy depositions in ATLAS are reconstructed
into physics objects which are used in analyses. Interactions between the incident
particles and the ATLAS detector are simulated in MC using Geant4. The entire
detector is modelled, allowing for local anomalies such as detector alignment or
local inefficiencies to be accounted for. Figure 4.1 shows a depiction of the tracks
and showers recorded by ATLAS due to interactions with various particles.
4.1 Inner Detector Tracks
The trajectories of charged particles are reconstructed as tracks within the ID,
|| < 2.5 using the TRT, the SCT and the Pixel Detectors. These tracks are
parametrised by
 = (d0, z0, 0, 0, q/p) , (4.1)
where the transverse impact parameter, d0, and longitudinal impact parameter,
z0, are the coordinates of the perigee to the beamline. The ratio of the charge of
the track to its momentum is given by q/p, and the azimuthal and polar angles,
0 and 0, are the direction of the track at the perigee.
Tracks are reconstructed from recorded space points of hits within the silicon
Figure 4.1: Cross-sectional representation of the ATLAS detector with examples of
typical tracks and showers that lead to their identification [52]. Charged particles leave

interacting.

module hits.

space points to the track moving from the beamline outwards [33]. This inside-
out method resolves ambiguities by assigning tracks a score based on how likely
the track is to originate from a real particle trajectory. Hits that are used in
the reconstruction of multiple tracks are then removed from all but the highest
scoring track. The tracks are then extended through the TRT, refit, and the
track score recalculated. If the extended track score is lower than the silicon only
track score, the TRT information is ignored.
An outside-in method is also used, starting from hits recorded within the
TRT and extending back through the silicon layers towards the beamline. This
method is effective at identifying tracks originating from displaced vertices re-
sulting from photon conversion and other neutral particle decays that may be
overlooked by the inside-out method. Tracks reconstructed from the outside-in
method, but without complementary hits in the silicon detector, are referred to
as TRT-standalone tracks.
4.2 Primary Vertices
Proton-proton collisions occur within the beam spot, which extends for approx-
imately 5 cm along the beamline and 15 m perpendicular to it. Within this
region for each bunch crossing there are approximately 20 primary vertices (PV).
Reconstructed tracks are used to reconstruct a PV along the beamline, using the
longitudinal impact parameter of a track to seed an iterative 2 fit of nearby
tracks [54, 55]. The PVs are required to have a minimum of two tracks, but often
have in excess of 20. Tracks that do not align with the PV by more than 7  are
used to seed additional PVs.
4.3 Electrons
4.3.1 Reconstruction
Within the central region, electron objects are constructed from information
recorded in the ID and ECAL [56, 57]. The central region of these subdetec-
tors extend to || = 2.5, however to ensure that the entire shower of an electron
is contained within the ECAL, electron candidates are reconstructed only within
|| < 2.47.
Initial Cluster Reconstruction: Energy deposits within the ECAL are identi-
fied using a sliding-window algorithm and are used to initiate the electron recon-
struction. A window size of 3  5 units is used, where one unit is 0.025  0.025
in - space. The efficiency of this initial cluster is 97% for electrons with
ET = 7 GeV, increasing to almost 100% for ET > 20 GeV.
Track Association: Tracks reconstructed within the ID with pT > 0.5 GeV are
extrapolated, with the impact point defined as the intersection of the track with
the middle layer of the ECAL. Tracks are considered matched to an initial cluster
if the distance from the impact point to the cluster position is within || < 0.05
and || < 0.1. In the instance that multiple tracks are associated to a cluster,
priority is given to tracks that registered hits within the Pixel Detector and
SCT. Finally, the track with the smallest R between the impact point and
cluster position is selected. If the matched track is one of two originating from a
displaced vertex, then the cluster is tagged as a converted photon. If no track is
matched, then the cluster is tagged as an unconverted photon.
Reconstructed Candidate: Once an initial cluster has an associated track, the
electron inherits its position in - space from its matched track at the primary
vertex. Using the same unit size of 0.025  0.025 in - space, the cluster size
is increased from the initial 3  5 units to 3  7 units in the barrel, and 5  5
units in the end-caps. The total transverse energy of the electron is calculated
from the sum of the estimated energy lost prior to the ECAL, the energy deposit
in the cluster, and the lateral and longitudinal leakage. The estimated energy
lost traversing the region prior to the ECAL is calculated using the pre-sampler.
Lateral leakage is the energy deposited in the ECAL but outside of the cluster,
and longitudinal leakage is the energy deposited beyond the ECAL. Corrections
are calculated from MC simulations for the lateral and longitudinal leakage and
the cluster deposit sampling fraction of the calorimeter.
The absolute energy scale is calibrated to observations of Z  ee, J/ ee,
and W  e decays. The position of the ECAL relative to the ID is calibrated
by comparing the impact point of the extrapolated track with the cluster position
for electrons with ET > 20 GeV, originating from a W or Z boson.
In the forward region 2.5 < || < 4.9, no tracking is available, and so no
distinction between electrons and photons is possible. Due to the reduced de-
tector information, electron candidates reconstructed within this region are not
considered in the analyses presented here.
4.3.2 Identification
The electron candidates in the central region are required to pass identification
criteria in order to distinguish them from non-isolated electron background, and
misidentified hadronic activity. To satisfy the requirements of the range of anal-
yses performed within ATLAS, there are tiers of criteria ranging in efficiency and
background rejection. Three such sets of criteria shall be described; Loose++,
Medium++ and Tight++. The requirements placed on shower shape variables are
applied as functions of || and ET in order to optimise the identification criteria
for the detector geometry and a large range of energy [58]. For each identification
criterion, the efficiency to reconstruct an electron shown is calculated through
the tag and probe method using the decays of Z bosons [57].
Loose++ has an efficiency of 95%. It places requirements on shower shape
variables in the first two layers of the ECAL and the longitudinal leakage. It also
requires track quality hits in the Pixel Detector and SCT, and requires track-
cluster matching of || < 0.015.
Medium++ has an efficiency of 85%. Compared with Loose++, it places
tighter requirements on shower shape variables, requires more hits within the
Pixel Detector and B-Layer, and introduces a criteria based on the TRT HT frac-
tion, where HT is the scalar sum of the transverse energies in the cluster. A track-
cluster matching of || < 0.005 and transverse impact parameter d0 < 5 mm are
required.
Tight++ has an efficiency of 78%. The shower shape requirements are the
same or tighter than Medium++, and the transverse impact parameter of d0 < 1 mm
is required. Criteria are added to the ratio of cluster energy over track momen-
tum, and on the  between the matched track and cluster.
4.4 Muons
Muon candidates are reconstructed in the central region using both the ID, within
|| < 2.5, and MS, within || < 2.7. There are two main methods used for recon-
structing muon tracks, Muid and Staco [59]. The Muid method is not detailed
here as only the Staco method is used in the analyses described. Though the
methods utilise different reconstruction and matching techniques they have com-
parable resolution and efficiency.
Dependent on where the muon track is first identified, or what part of the
detector registers the track, the muon candidate falls into one of three categories,
Muonboy, Staco Combined, or MuTag.
Muonboy: This method is required to extrapolate muon tracks between the
various types of chamber, extrapolating the reconstructed track to the beam
spot. The large distances between the muon chambers in the inhomogeneous
magnetic field can lead to large extrapolation uncertainties. The algorithm is
initiated on the Region of Activity (ROA), where a TGC or RPC is triggered.
The ROA is approximately 0.4 0.4 in - space, centred on the triggering hit,
and all of the chambers which intersect this window are used to reconstruct track
segments. Adjacent MDTs are sufficiently close that a straight line can be used
to approximate the track segment. These segments are required to extrapolate
approximately to the beam spot. Due to the geometry of the drift tubes, there are
four possible trajectories which could result in the recorded MDT hits. All four
of these solutions are extrapolated through the remaining tubes within the MDT
chamber, and are only considered valid if their quality factor, which is based on
the 2 of their hits, is sufficiently high. The momentum of the valid track segments
is estimated from their direction and extrapolated accounting for the magnetic
field to the adjacent segments of the MS. If the track segment is matched, the
momentum is recalculated and the extrapolation procedure continued. A track
is considered valid if it is matched to at least one additional segment.
Staco Combined: By combining the Muonboy and ID tracks, the momen-
tum resolution can be improved. The momentum measurement of the Staco
Combined candidates is dominated by the MS for pT > 200 GeV, and the ID for
pT < 30 GeV, and benefits over the Muonboy candidates for 6 GeV < pT < 200 GeV.
The inclusion of track information from the ID also allows for the identification
of muons that originate from displaced vertices.
MuTag: This method is initiated from ID tracks which are extrapolated and
matched to track segments not associated to valid Staco tracks. This is particu-
larly effective at identifying low-pT muons, but is also capable of increasing the
efficiency over the full momentum range.
The muon candidates are considered to be of different qualities depending on
which method is used to reconstruct them [60]. Staco Combined muons are always
considered Tight. A MuTag muon is considered Tight if it has at least three
TGC  hits in tagging segments, or is matched in at least two segments. MuTag
candidates with || > 1.05, which are matched to only one tagging segment and
no TGC  hits in that segment, are considered Loose. The remaining MuTag
and Muonboy candidates have a Medium quality.
4.5 Jets
Particles that develop parton showers within the calorimeters deposit energy in
a large numbers of cells. The energy deposited is reconstructed using topolog-
ical clusters. These clusters are then merged using a combination algorithm to
reconstruct jets.
4.5.1 Topological Clustering
Topological clusters are reconstructed from groups of nearby calorimeter cells
with significant energy deposits. These do not have a fixed size, but can vary
depending on the energy deposition [61]. Each cell has noise associated to it,
which consists of the quadrature sum of the RMS of the electrical noise and the
expected pile-up. The noise varies from cell to cell and spans orders of magnitude.
Pile-up contributions originate from additional vertices in the event, as well as
neighbouring bunch crossings, due to the response time of the calorimeter exceed-
ing the spacing between said bunches. The topological clustering is performed
using a multi-stage algorithm.
Seed finding: Proto-clusters are initiated from cells that have a ratio of the
deposited energy signal to noise exceeding tseed.
Merging neighbours: A cell is classed as a neighbour if it has a signal to noise
ratio exceeding tneighbour and is adjacent to the proto-cluster. Neighbours are
iteratively added to the proto-cluster until all adjoining cells have a signal to
noise ratio less than tneighbour. If a cell is a neighbour to more than one proto-
cluster then the two clusters are merged.
Additional cells: Cells which are adjacent to a neighbour cell are merged if
their signal to noise ratio exceeds tcell. If a cell adjoins multiple neighbours from
different proto-clusters, the cell is merged with the neighbour which has the higher
signal to noise ratio. This final process is not iterative, and cells that are adjacent
to a proto-cluster only after the inclusion of additional cells remain apart.
The standard parameters for topological clustering used in ATLAS are tseed =
4, tneighbour = 2, and tcell = 0.
4.5.2 Jet Recombination Algorithms
Sequential recombination algorithms are used to combine the topological clusters
and combine them into jets in a manner that is collinear and infra-red safe,
meaning that the jet objects produced are stable under collinear splitting in
the shower and the presence of additional soft radiation. The algorithms use
the constituent-beam distance, diB, and the constituent-constituent distance, dij,
given by
diB = pT
i , (4.2)
dij = min
i , pT
) R2ij
, (4.3)
where R governs the radius of the reconstructed jets, and n governs the behaviour
of the algorithm.
To iteratively combine the constituents, the algorithm first calculates the val-
ues of dij for all constituent pairings. The smallest value of dij is found. If this
minimum value is less than diB, the constituents i and j are combined by sum-
ming their four-vectors. Otherwise, constituent i is classified as a jet and removed
from the list of constituents. This process is repeated until there are no remaining
constituents.
The parameter n changes the order in which the algorithm chooses to combine
the constituents. The standard value used in ATLAS is n = 1, and this is
referred to as anti-kT [62]. The behaviour of the algorithm is similar for all
negative values of n. Setting n = 0 removes the algorithms dependence on
momentum, and is called the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) method [63]. A third
method, which is not used in the analyses detailed here, is the kT method, for
which n = 1 [64]. The behaviour of the algorithm is similar to kT for all positive
values of n. The shape of the jets reconstructed with the anti-kT and C/A
methods are shown in figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2: Comparison of the anti-kT (left) and C/A (right) jet reconstruction algo-
rithms applied to the same multi-jet event in - space [62].
The behaviour of the anti-kT method ensures that the distance between two
soft constituents is much larger than the distance between the constituents of
a hard-soft pair. This ensures that hard-soft clustering happens before soft-soft
clustering is possible. This results in the jets having a uniform conical shape, with
soft radiation having only a small effect on the jet boundary. If there are two
hard constituents, a and b, such that R < R(a, b) < 2R, and pT a  pT b, then
jet a maintains its conical shape, and jet b is cropped from the overlap region, as
seen with the green and magenta jets in figure 4.2. If however pT a  pT b, both
jets are cropped, with the border between them dependent of their relative pT ,
as in the case of the red and grey jets. If there is a severe overlap, such that
Rab < R, then the two jets are combined into a single jet which typically has
an irregular border, as seen with the magenta jet.
The C/A method initially combines constituents which are in close proximity
regardless of pT . The intention is to reconstruct the jet by reversing the order of
the shower and hadronisation, under the assumption the parton splitting occur-
ring at larger r will be closer in - space. This physically motivated ordering
allows the jet to be decomposed and the substructure to be probed to determine
the interaction which generated the jet.
4.5.3 Merged Jets
The high centre of mass energy in the LHC allows for W and Z bosons to be
produced with very high momenta in excess of 1 TeV. As the momentum of a
boson increases, the separation of the decay products obeys
, (4.4)
where M and p are the mass and momentum of the incident boson. The standard
jet collection used within ATLAS applies the anti-kT method with R = 0.4. For
these parameters, the jets resulting from the decay begin to overlap when the
momentum of the boson exceeds  250 GeV, and become merged when the
momentum is twice this value. This means that reconstruction of the event
becomes increasingly difficult when highly boosted vector bosons are present. In
these instances it is advantageous to reconstruct the sum of the decay products
of the boson into a single merged jet utilising a larger jet radius.
A jet that is due to a hadronic background process typically has a single hard
core, with an even energy deposit in the surrounding cone, whereas a jet origi-
nating from a boosted boson has two hard cores in close proximity. The BDRS-A
method discriminates between these two types of jet by analysing the substruc-
ture of C/A jets with a radius parameter of R = 1.2. The jet is reconstructed
into smaller subjets and a mass drop filter technique applied [65].
The jet is initially decomposed by reversing the order of the initial C/A cluster
algorithm by one step, forming two subjets. The momentum balance of the
subjets is defined as
min (pT
1, pT
R212 
min (pT 1, pT 2)
max (pT 1, pT 2)
, (4.5)
where m0 is the mass of the parent jet, pT 1 and pT 2 are the transverse momenta
of the subjets, and R12 is the distance between the subjets. In the case that
the two subjets share the momentum equally yf = 1, and where one subjet
contains all of the momentum of the parent jet yf = 0. If
yf < 0.2, then the
subjet with the smaller mass is discarded, and the filter process repeated on the
remaining subjet. Once the momentum balance criterion is satisfied the remaining
constituents, which were not discarded during the filtering, are re-clustered using
C/A with a radius parameter of R = 0.3, and the leading three jets are kept.
After the filtering process the re-clustered subjets are used to recalculate the
momentum of the initial merged jet. Performing this grooming and re-clustering
improves the resolution of the energy and mass of the jet.
4.6 Missing Transverse Energy
The missing transverse energy, EmissT , is calculated from energy depositions in the
calorimeter systems, and hits in the MS. The total missing transverse energy is
calculated in the x and y directions, and combined using
EmissT =
(Emissx )
Emissy
. (4.6)
The components E, with  = x, y, are sums of contributions originating from
the range of reconstructed physics objects.

where the first five components account for reconstructed electrons, photons,
hadronically decaying tau leptons, hard jets and soft jets respectively [66, 67]. The
cell component accounts for calorimeter energy deposits that were not matched to
ID tracks. The final two components account for reconstructed muons, where the
calo  term considers calorimeter cells that reconstructed muons have passed
through.
Diboson Resonance Search in the
``qq Final State
5.1 Introduction
The naturalness problem suggests that a modification or extension to the SM
may be required. A consequence of this extension would be the existence of
new particles and interactions at the TeV scale. Detailed here is a search in the
semileptonic decay channel WV  ``qq, where V stands for a W or Z boson,
and ` for either an electron or muon.
The two benchmark models used in this search to probe for new physics are
the bulk RS gravitons G, with k/MPl = 1, and the EGM W
 boson with c = 1,
as described in section 2. Both signal models predict large branching ratios to
vector boson pairs.
The semileptonic final state achieves a greater suppression of background
events than the fully hadronic final state due to the requirement of two lep-
tons. Compared with the fully leptonic final state, the ``qq channel benefits from
the larger branching ratio of vector bosons to hadrons. In addition, the absence
of neutrinos in the final state allows the invariant mass of the diboson system to
be reconstructed.
Frequentist methods are used to quantify the agreement between the data
and the background only hypothesis, and limits are set at the 95% Confidence
Level (CL) on the product of the production cross-section and branching ratio
for the two benchmark models.
Previous searches for graviton models and W  bosons have been performed
using pp collisions at
s = 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron. The D0 Collaboration
performed searches for resonant WW and WZ production, excluding the RS1
graviton between 300 GeV and 754 GeV, and the SSMW  boson between 180 GeV
and 690 GeV, at the 95% CL [68, 69]. The CDF Collaboration performed searches
for resonant ZZ production in the ````, `` and ``qq decay channels, which
excluded the RS1 graviton between 300 GeV and 1000 GeV at the 95% CL [70].
Searches performed by ATLAS and CMS have excluded production of the
EGM W  boson at the 95% CL. Using the ``` final state, both ATLAS and
CMS collaborations excluded production below 1.52 TeV [71] and 1.55 TeV [72]
respectively. Production was also excluded by the ATLAS collaboration be-
low 1.49 TeV [73] using the `qq final state. Fully hadronic final states were
used by the ATLAS collaboration to exclude production between 1.3 TeV and
1.5 TeV [74], as well as by the CMS collaboration to exclude production below
1.7 TeV [75].
The ATLAS collaboration has excluded at the 95% CL the production of bulk
RS gravitons below 760 GeV using the `qq channel [73]. The CMS collabora-
tion, using the fully hadronic channel, has excluded G  WW and G  ZZ
production below a mass of 1.2 TeV [75].
5.2 Data Samples
The data used in the analysis were collected with the ATLAS detector during
the 2012 proton-proton run. The centre of mass energy is 8 TeV, and there is
an average of 21 interactions per bunch crossing. During 2012, ATLAS recorded
an integrated luminosity of 21.7 fb1. Portions of this dataset were removed due
to data corruption and offline subdetectors. A final dataset with an integrated
luminosity of 20.3 fb1 is used.
5.3 Trigger
The trigger criteria used to select candidate events are based on the identification
of the leptons resulting from a Z boson decay. Separate chains are used for events
containing electrons and muons.
For events containing electrons, a sliding window algorithm is used in the
L1 trigger. Showers within the ECAL are selected if the total energy contained
is above a noise threshold. The Regions of Interest (RoI) are passed to the L2
trigger, which uses information from the ID to ensure that the cluster has an
associated track. The EF then imposes criteria on the quality of the electron
object [57]. Events are selected if they pass at least one of the following sets of
requirements:
EF e60 medium1: At least one electron with ET > 60 GeV that passes a
medium quality criteria.
EF e24vhi medium1: At least one isolated electron with ET > 24 GeV that
passes a medium quality criteria
EF 2e12Tvh loose1: At least two electrons which each have ET > 12 GeV,
passing a loose quality criteria.
In the case that events contain muons, the L1 trigger identifies coinciding hits
in the MS and uses dedicated hardware to calculate the momentum of the muon
candidate [76]. The L2 and EF levels proceed similarly to the electron case, with
events being selected if they pass one of the following requirements:
EF mu36 tight: At least one muon with pT > 36 GeV that passes a tight
quality criteria.
EF mu24i tight: At least one isolated muon with pT > 24 GeV that passes
a tight quality criteria.
EF mu18 tight mu8 EFFS: A pair of muons, one with pT > 18 GeV, and one
with pT > 8 GeV, both passing a tight quality criteria.
For a given analysis the chosen trigger criteria should result in a looser set
of criteria than the final selection. A measure of this is the trigger efficiency,
defined as the ratio of the number of events that pass the trigger and the offline
selection, over the number of events that pass the offline selection regardless of
the trigger. The trigger efficiency is 99% (92%) for the electron (muon) events,
for all signal masses, and independent of lepton pT . The reduced efficiency in
the muon channel is due to the geometric acceptance of the L1 trigger caused by
services for the ID and ECAL.
5.4 Object Selection
Detailed here are the requirements used for selecting physics objects to be used in
the analysis. The signal hypothesis is simultaneously searched for in alternative
final states with the intention of combining the results. To facilitate this combi-
nation, a second category of leptons is defined that is common to each analysis,
with a looser selection than the signal leptons. Each analysis requires events to
have the exact number of signal leptons, with no additional veto leptons to ensure
the use of statistically independent datasets.
5.4.1 Electrons
Electron candidates that are reconstructed within the ID but not the calorimeter
are rejected. The electrons are required to pass the Medium++ electron identity
requirements and are vetoed if the cluster is categorised as bad quality.
To ensure that the electron candidate originates from the interaction re-
gion, the longitudinal impact parameter |z0 sin | from the PV must be less than
0.5 mm, and the transverse impact parameter |d0|, divided by its uncertainty
(d0), must be less than six.
The electron transverse energy is required to be > 25 GeV to guarantee a high
trigger efficiency, and the pseudorapidity is required to be in the range || < 1.37
or 1.52 < || < 2.47 to ensure that the shower is entirely within the acceptance
of the ECAL and avoids the transition region between the barrel and end-cap.
Isolation requirements are applied to the track pT and calorimeter ET sur-
rounding the electron candidate after corrections have been applied to account
for the pT and energy leakage from the electron core, and the number of PVs in
the event. Details on the application of the isolation requirements are given in
section 5.4.3.
The looser veto electrons share many of the selection criteria of the signal elec-
trons, and only differ in the following manner. There is no requirement placed on
the cluster quality, and the minimum transverse energy requirement is reduced to
20 GeV. The longitudinal impact parameter |z0 sin | is required to be < 2.0 mm,
and the calorimeter isolation is not applied.
5.4.2 Muons
The Staco Combined muon collection is used, as described in section 4.4. Re-
quirements are made of the track quality in order to remove events which would
otherwise contain fakemuons, and to ensure that the positions and momenta of
the muons are well measured. A hit is required in the inner most layer of the
ID if one is expected from the overall track fit. The sum of the number of hits
in the Pixel Detector and the number of dead pixels traversed is required to be
> 1. The sum of the number of SCT hits and the number of dead SCT sensors
traversed is required to be > 5. The sum of pixel and SCT track holes must be
A high quality TRT track is required if the muon track is within the  ac-
ceptance of the TRT. Defining NTRT as the sum of the number of TRT track
hits, and Noutliers as the number of track hit outliers, muon tracks in the region
0.1 < || < 1.9 are required to have NTRT > 5. Muon tracks in all parts of the
TRT are required to have Noutliers < 0.9 NTRT if NTRT > 5.
A good agreement between the measurements from the ID and MS is en-
sured by requiring that the charge over momentum measurements, q/p, satisfy
|(q/p)ID  (q/p)MS| < 5 C , where C is the combined q/p uncertainty.
To ensure that the muon candidate originates from the interaction region, the
longitudinal impact parameter |z0 sin | from the PV must be less than 0.5 mm,
and the transverse impact parameter |d0|, divided by its uncertainty (d0), must
be < 3.5.
The muon is required to have pT > 25 GeV to ensure a high trigger efficiency,
and || < 2.5 to ensure that the candidate is within the ID acceptance. Isolation
requirements are applied to the track pT and calorimeter ET surrounding the
muon candidate after pile-up corrections are applied by a muon isolation correc-
tion tool [77]. Details on the application of the isolation requirements are given
in section 5.4.3.
The looser veto muons share many of the selection criteria of the signal muons,
and only differ in the following manner. The transverse momentum is required
to be > 20 GeV, and the longitudinal impact parameter |z0 sin | is required to
be < 2.0 mm. No calorimeter isolation is applied.
It is possible that a muon with high pT could radiate a photon within the de-
tector volume, which could subsequently be reconstructed as an electron. For this
reason any electron candidates within R = 0.1 of a selected muon are removed.
This removal is applied equally to electron and veto electron candidates.
5.4.3 Lepton Isolation
For the leptons to be well measured, there must be minimal detector activity in
the region surrounding the candidate. This isolation is required separately in the
tracking and calorimetry subsystems.
The standard track isolation parameter used in ATLAS, Isolationtrack(R), is
the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks with pT > 1 GeV within R of the
candidate leptons track, excluding the lepton itself. The calorimeter isolation pa-
rameter Isolationcalo(R) is defined as the sum of transverse energy in calorimeter
cells within R of the candidate lepton, excluding the lepton itself.
Lepton candidates are required to have a track isolation of Isolationtrack(0.2) <
0.15 plT , where p
T is the transverse momentum of the lepton candidate. The
calorimeter isolation parameter Isolationcalo(0.2) must be less than 0.3 E
T (0.3 p
of the electron (muon) candidates.
The decay products of boosted bosons become increasingly close as the boson
momentum increases. As the boson pT exceeds approximately 1 TeV, the dis-
tance between the decay products reduces to within R = 0.2. Subsequently, the
isolation cone contains contributions from multiple leptons, causing signal events
to fail the lepton isolation criteria. To accommodate this, a modified dilepton
isolation variable is used, where a correction is made for the presence of a second
lepton candidate, l2, such that
Isolation
Dilepton
track (R) = Isolationtrack(R) p
T . (5.1)
Three scenarios are defined upon which the isolation criteria are dependent.
Standard Isolation: When R(l, l) > 0.25, the core of each lepton is com-
pletely removed from the isolation cone of its counterpart. Standard track isola-
tion criteria are applied to electron and muon candidates, with Isolationtrack(0.2) <
0.15 plT . Standard calorimeter isolation criteria are implemented for electrons with
Isolationcalo(0.2) < 0.3 E
T , and for muons with Isolationcalo(0.2) < 0.3 p
Overlap Region: When 0.2 < R(l, l) < 0.25, the track of the second lepton
candidate is outside the isolation cone of the first, so the standard track isolation
is applied, Isolationtrack(0.2) < 0.15 p
T . The calorimeter cluster of the counterpart
signal lepton will partially overlap, so no calorimeter isolation is applied.
Dilepton Isolation: Once R(l, l) < 0.2, the isolation cone around the lepton
candidate contains the track of the second lepton, so the dilepton isolation crite-
rion, Isolation
Dilepton
track (0.2) < 0.15 p
T is required. As with the overlap region, no
calorimeter isolation is applied.
The effect of these modified dilepton isolation criteria is demonstrated in fig-
ure 5.1 on a graviton MC sample with a pole mass of 2 TeV. In this case the
Isolationtrack criteria results in a very low acceptance for R(l, l) < 0.2. In contrast,
the dilepton isolation for the same sample achieves a much higher acceptance for
both lepton flavours.
A comparison of the acceptance of the nominal and dilepton isolation criteria
as a function of the bulk RS graviton pole mass is shown in figure 5.2. The stan-
dard isolation criteria are shown to lose efficiency above approximately 1.5 TeV,
rejecting a significant percentage of signal events for the highest mass signal sam-
ples. In contrast, the dilepton isolation criteria maintain a high signal efficiency

through the complete range of signal pole masses.
5.4.4 Jets
Two different jet collections are used in this analysis to facilitate the optimisation
to a wide range of resonant signal masses. The low mass jets, referred to as small-
R jets or j, use the anti-kT algorithm with a radius parameter of 0.4. For resonant
masses above approximately 1 TeV, C/A jets are used with a radius parameter
of 1.2, referred to as large-R jets or J .
The small-R jets are required to have |EM| < 2.1, where EM is the defined as
the pseudorapidity as measured by the ECAL prior to applications of any energy
corrections. After the full Local Cluster Weighting Jet Energy Scale (LCW+JES)
calibration is applied [78, 79], the jets are required to have pT > 30 GeV. The
jets are also required to satisfy a set of jet quality criteria which reject jets with
calorimeter noise [80]. The Jet Vertex Fraction (JVF) of jets with pT > 50 GeV

is required to be greater than 0.5, where JVF is defined as the ratio of the scalar
sum of pT of tracks associated to the jet and originate from the PV, over the
scalar sum of pT of all tracks associated with the jet.
The large-R jets are subject to the BDRS-A filtering described in section 4.5.3,
and are representative of hadronically decaying vector bosons. The highest pT
jet in this collection is required to have
yf > 0.45, and a mass mJ , satisfying
70 GeV < mJ < 110 GeV. This window is sufficiently wide as to accept jets
originating from both W or Z bosons.
The jet reconstruction algorithm does not distinguish between calorimeter
deposits originating from electrons or hadrons, and so electrons are also recon-
structed as jets. Small-R (large-R) jets which have an electron reconstructed
within a cone of 0.3 (0.8) are removed.
5.5 Event Selections
This analysis selects a final state with two high pT electrons or muons originating
from a Z boson, and at least one reconstructed jet from a W or Z boson decay.
To optimise the acceptance over the large range of signal masses, three regions,
the low-pT resolved region (LR), high-pT resolved region (HR), and merged region
(MR), are defined. Both the LR and HR require at least two small-R jets to be
reconstructed. At least one large-R jet is required in the MR.
For all three of these regions, at least one PV is required, and the vertex with
the highest
p2T of associated tracks is required to have at least three tracks
associated with it. The event must not have a data quality flag indicating the
presence of noise in the LAr calorimeter, and no jets with calibrated pT > 20 GeV
must have looser bad jet quality [80]. There must either be exactly two electrons,
or exactly two opposite charge muons, such that the dilepton mass mll, satisfies
66 GeV < mll < 116 GeV. In both cases there must be no additional veto leptons
of either flavour. At least one of the selected leptons must have pT > 25 GeV,
and match the trigger object.
The additional criteria specific to each of the three signal region selections are
as follows:
Low-pT resolved region: The transverse momentum of the dilepton system
is required to satisfy, pllT > 100 GeV. The two jets with the highest transverse
momenta are used to reconstruct the hadronically decaying boson candidate.
The dijet transverse momentum must satisfy, p
T > 100 GeV. The dijet mass is
required to be within the window, 70 GeV < mjj < 110 GeV. The distribution of
the dilepton transverse moment after the selection of two muons and two small-
R jets, and the associated Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) are shown
in figure 5.3. The dijet transverse momentum distribution for the LR after the
dilepton pT requirement is applied is shown in figure 5.4, with the associated
High-pT resolved region: Compared with the LR, the HR has higher dilepton
and dijet pT requirements. The transverse momentum of the dilepton system is
required to satisfy, pllT > 250 GeV. The dijet transverse momentum must satisfy,
T > 250 GeV. The dijet mass must be within the window, 70 GeV < mjj <

both the MR and HR selection criteria. The sensitivity of each signal region after
all selection criteria are applied is summarised in figure 5.7. The ratios S/B and

of background events. The signal regions are optimised to have good sensitivity

across a large range of signal masses. The LR is the most sensitive region for a
signal mass below 500 GeV and the MR is the most sensitive region for signal
mass above 800 GeV. The HR is the most sensitive region for intermediate signal
masses. The acceptance of the three selection regions and their union is shown in
figure 5.8 for both the electron and muon channels. A high acceptance is achieved
for signal masses above  600 GeV, and is maintained to high signal masses.
5.6 Signal Samples
Signal samples for both the bulk RS graviton and EGM W  boson are composed
of events generated through the Monte Carlo (MC) method. These are generated
for signal pole masses between 300 GeV and 2000 GeV.
The bulk RS graviton samples are generated using CalcHEP3.2 [81], with the
CTEQ6L1 PDF set. The decay of the graviton into two Z bosons is performed by
CalcHEP, keeping all spin information. The subsequent parton showering and
hadronisation are performed by Pythia8 [82]. Between 300 GeV and 1000 GeV,
samples are produced with 50 GeV mass steps. A mass step of 100 GeV is used

for samples produced between 1000 GeV and 2000 GeV.
The EGM W  boson samples are generated using Pythia8, including the
parton shower and hadronisation, with the MSTW20080LO PDF set. Samples are
generated through the entire 300 GeV to 2000 GeV range with 100 GeV mass
steps. The production is performed at Leading Order (LO), and an NNLO k-
factor is applied. The k-factor was originally derived for the W   l process
and was adapted to W   WZ by the ``` channel [83]. The effect of the
k-factor on the signal acceptance for the ``qq channel is negligible. Though the
k-factor is a function of resonance mass, the variation is sufficiently small to allow
the application of a single k-factor to the each signal distribution, rather than
applying the factor on an event by event case.
For both the bulk RS graviton and EGM W  boson samples, the factorisation
and renormalisation scales are set to the generated resonance mass. A summary

5.7 Background Estimation
The background is dominated by Z+jets events. There are additional contri-
butions from diboson and top quark production, with top quark backgrounds
becoming negligible at high mass. Contributions from W+jets and QCD multi-
jet backgrounds are shown to be negligible. All of the background samples are
generated using MC simulation, except for the QCD multi-jet sample, which uses
data driven methods. The MC samples are generated using ATLAS approved
generator settings, and the dominant Z+jets background is validated through
comparison to control regions.
The Z+jets background is simulated using the multi-leg LO perturbative QCD
matrix element generator, Sherpa [84] with the CT10 PDF set. This background
is further subdivided into events containing Z bosons and either light flavour,
charm or bottom quarks. These samples are simulated independently, but are
collectively referred to as the Z+jets sample. To reduce the processing time for
producing the Z+jets background, generator criteria are imposed, which sup-
press the production of events with mll < 40 GeV as this region is not used
in the analysis. The tt, Wt, and s-channel single top quark background pro-
cesses are generated using MC@NLO [85], with the CT10 PDF set. The subse-
quent hadronisation is performed by HERWIG [86], and the underlying events
by Jimmy [87]. For t-channel single top quark production, AcerMC [88] with
the CTEQ6L1 PDF set is used to generate the event, and Pythia performs the
hadronisation. Diboson events are simulated using HERWIG with the CTEQ6L1
PDF set, and W+jets events are simulated using Sherpa. A summary of the
generators and cross-sections used for the MC backgrounds is given in table 5.2.
The QCD multi-jet background is generated using a combination of MC and
data driven techniques. For the electron channels, the multi-jet control sample
is obtained from data by requiring two electrons that pass the Medium++ but

fail the Tight++ quality criteria. The multi-jet control sample for the muon
channel is obtained by inverting the requirement placed on the transverse impact
parameter. The MC background samples described above are used to verify
that the contributions of real leptons to these regions are small. These small
contributions are subtracted from the multi-jet samples.
The normalisation of the multi-jet control sample is obtained by performing
a Maximum Likelihood (ML) fit. The MC background and the multi-jet control
sample are fitted over the dilepton mass spectrum for 40 GeV < mll < 200 GeV.
The results of the fits, shown in figure 5.9, estimate the multi-jet background
within the dilepton mass region 66 GeV < mll < 116 GeV, to be much less than
1% for both lepton channels. The deficit in simulated events below 40 GeV is
the result of the criteria placed on Z+jet events to optimise processor time. The
sub-optimal residuals observed in the dilepton mass spectra are attributed to
the modelling of the Z+jets background. A correction is applied to the Z+jets
background, as described in section 5.9.1.
5.8 Background Validation
Control regions are defined for the purpose of validating the background estima-
tion. These are defined in order to duplicate the signal region kinematics as closely

as possible, while removing any signal contamination. This is performed by in-
verting the mass windows on the hadronically decaying boson, thus creating two
side band regions for each signal region, the high control region (mjj > 110 GeV
or mJ > 110 GeV) and the low control region (mjj < 70 GeV or mJ < 70 GeV).
Given the three selection regions, and the two lepton flavours, there are a total
of 12 control regions.
The control region for the reconstructed 3-body (MR), and 4-body (LR and
HR) mass spectra are compared in figure 5.10, where the high and low sideband
regions and the lepton flavours have been combined. The simulated background
models the data well; however, there are small disagreements in both normalisa-
tion and shape. Corrections are applied to the Z+jets backgrounds to account
for these discrepancies as described in section 5.9.1.

5.9 Systematic Uncertainty Estimations
Limited knowledge of both theoretical and experimental factors that affect the
differential distributions of final state objects and normalisations are accounted
for by the introduction of systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties
important to the analysis are discussed below; however, not all those discussed
were used in the search and limit setting procedures. The removal of negligibly
small systematics is discussed in section 5.13.
5.9.1 Z+jets Background Constraint
In order to account for the sub-optimal residuals present in figure 5.9 and 5.10,
normalisation and shape corrections are applied to the Z+jets background. All
of the MC background samples are subtracted from the control region data, with
the exception of the Z+jets background. The Z+jets background is subsequently
scaled to agree with this sample.
The normalisation correction is calculated from the low and high mass control
regions separately, and from their combination. The integral of the Z+jets is
scaled to that of the combined control region for each of the selection regions,
subdivided by lepton flavour. The uncertainty of the correction originates from
the finite statistics of the control regions. If the normalisation calculated from
the low and high mass control regions are consistent, then the uncertainty on
the normalisation applied to the Z+jets background derived purely from the
statistical uncertainty. This is the case for the HR and MR. In the instance that
the normalisation calculated from the low and high mass control regions differ
from each other significantly compared with their statistical uncertainties, the
uncertainty on the normalisation applied to the Z+jets sample is taken to be the
maximum difference between the applied correction and that derived from the
separate low and high mass control regions. This is the case for the LR. Through
these methods of estimating uncertainty, a conservative uncertainty is applied,
which is limited by the data statistics in the sideband regions.
The variation in shape is not associated to the leptonic components of the
event, so the shape is fitted in three control regions, where the low and high mass
sidebands and lepton flavours are combined. A linear shape correction is applied
to the invariant mass distribution with the constraint that the normalisation of
the Z+jets sample is fixed, so as to maintain independence between the shape
and normalisation corrections. The uncertainty of the shape correction is taken
to be the fit uncertainty resulting from the statistical uncertainties of the control
regions.
A summary of the normalisation and shape corrections applied to the Z+jets
samples in each region is given in figure 5.11. The uncertainties of the scaling
of the normalisation (referred to as ZjetsBGModelSlope) and shape (referred to
as ZjetsBGModel) of the Z+jets samples are the dominant uncertainties on the
background prediction. The fitting of the normalisation and shape of the Z+jets
background effectively constrain the background prediction, and so any potential
modelling uncertainties on this background are now not applicable. Subsequently,
the only remaining uncertainties applicable to the Z+jets background are those
derived from the process of fitting the background to the sideband regions.
5.9.2 Electrons
Correction factors are applied to the electron triggers and reconstruction efficien-
cies as functions of  and ET , derived from Z  ee events. Uncertainties are
derived for these correction factors (TRIG, RECO) using the method described in
reference [57]. The uncertainty of the energy scale and resolution of the electron
candidates is accounted for by applying a smearing to the energy of the electron
candidates as a function of . These scale (ElecLES) and resolution (ElecLER)
uncertainties are found to be 1% and less than 1%, respectively. These uncer-

tainties affect the signal and sub-dominant top and diboson background samples.
5.9.3 Muons
Correction factors are applied to the triggers, determined from Z   events as
a function of  and , as described in reference [90]. A correction factor is applied
to the muons reconstructed in MC to account for the reconstruction efficiencies,
and is derived from Z   events. The uncertainty on this correction factor
(MuonID) is given in reference [91]. The uncertainty on the transverse momen-
tum of the muons is accounted for by applying a smearing to the reconstructed
muons, separately in the ID and MS. The combined effect of these uncertain-
ties (MuonLES) is approximately 1%, and affects the signal and sub-dominant
background samples.
5.9.4 Small-R Jets
The uncertainties associated to the Jet Energy Scale (JES) of the small-R jets
used in the LR and HR are determined from the jet response using MC sam-
ples [92]. Conditions such as the hadronic shower model are varied, and uncer-
tainties calculated using +jets, Z+jets and multi-jet events. There are a large
number of systematic uncertainties, which are parametrised into terms that are
considered uncorrelated:
Closure: Required for MC samples with detector response modelled by
ATLFAST-II [93] to account for the non-closure of the simulation. Non-
closure of the sample is defined as the difference present at low pT between
the simulation and unity after JES corrections are applied. (1 parameter:
JESClosure)
Detector: The uncertainty in the model of the detector and its response. (3
parameters: JESDetector1, JESDetector2, JESDetector3)
 Intercalibration: The uncertainty derived from balancing the momenta
of jets recoiling from Z boson production. (2 parameters: JESEtaInter1,
JESEtaInter2)
Flavour Response: The uncertainty in flavour response and composition.
(2 parameters: JESFlavComp, JESFlavResp)
Mixed: The combination of detector, modelling and detector based uncer-
tainties. (2 parameters: JESMixed1, JESMixed2)
Modelling: The theoretical and modelling uncertainties in the MC. (4 pa-
rameters: JESModelling1, JESModelling2, JESModelling3, JESModelling4)
Pileup: The uncertainty on the effects of pileup on the jet response. (4
parameters: JESMuOff, JESNPVOff, JESPileupPt, JESRho)
Single-hadron: The uncertainty in the single-hadron response at high pT .
(1 parameter: JESSinglePart)
Statistical: Due to the statistical uncertainty on the derivation of the energy
scale. (3 parameters: JESStatMeth1, JESStatMeth2, JESStatMeth3)
Uncertainties on the Jet Energy Resolution (JER) (JER) are determined in-
situ using the dijet pT balance and bisector techniques, which both give consistent
results [94]. These uncertainties only affect the LR and HR, in which the small-R
jets are used. Due to the constraint placed on the Z+jets sample, the effect on
the background prediction is negligible, and the effects on the signal samples are
of order 1% or less.
5.9.5 Large-R Jets
Uncertainties on the large-R jets due to JES (RMDJES), Jet Mass Scale (JMS)
(RMDJMS), and momentum balance
yf (RMDYS), are derived through the use of a
double ratio method [65]. For a given quantity the average ratio of the track jet to
the calorimeter jet is calculated. The comparison of these ratios is made between
data and MC. Any deviation from unity is considered a systematic uncertainty.
This results in an uncertainty of 2% and 3% on the JES and JMS, and 2% on
the momentum balance.
Studies of the W boson mass peak in W+jets data indicate that both the peak
location and shape are well described by MC. A similar agreement is seen for the
momentum balance resolution in multi-jet events. A 20% uncertainty is applied to
the JER (RMDJER), Jet Mass Resolution (JMR) (RMDJMR) and momentum balance
resolution (RMDYR) in accordance with recommendations from the jet substructure
group [95].
5.9.6 Additional Uncertainties
There exist tile modules in the hadronic calorimeter that are intermittently or
permanently unusable due to a range of problems. Corrections are applied to jets
that are reconstructed close to these modules, but perform poorly for high pT
jets [96]. The effect is small in the HR, and negligible in the LR and MR. In the
HR a 2% uncertainty is applied to the signal acceptance (BCH).
The luminosity uncertainty for the 2012 data taking period is estimated to be
2.8% (Lumi).
The uncertainty of the signal acceptance due to the PDF (PDF) set is de-
termined through the generation of additional signal samples using modified
PDF models. The nominal EGM W  boson samples are generated using the
MSTW2008LO PDF set. The MSTW2008LO PDF set contains 20 error sets which
parametrise the uncertainty associated with its derivation. The acceptance is
compared between the nominal and fluctuated sets, and the maximum variation
taken as the acceptance uncertainty. The nominal bulk RS graviton samples are
generated using the CTEQ6L1 PDF, and compared against equivalent samples gen-
erated using MSTW2008LO, a more recent LO PDF set. The maximum variance of
the acceptance between the two PDFs is taken. The total acceptance uncertainty
due to the PDF set on the RS graviton samples is taken to be the quadrature
sum of the two recorded variances. Dependent on the mass of the signal samples,
the effect is found to be between 1% and 2%.
The quantity of Initial and Final State Radiation (ISR/FSR) (ISRFSR) is
tunable in MC by a number of parameters. Signal samples with varying levels
of ISR/FSR are generated using Pythia8. The acceptance of these samples is
compared with that of the nominal at truth level. The variation was found to be
approximately constant for all mass points and signal regions, and the maximum
variation of 5% is taken as a constant uncertainty applied to all signal samples.
At a centre of mass energy of
s = 8 TeV, the beam energy was measured to
be 3988 5(stat) 26(syst) GeV using p-Pb runs in January-February 2013 [97].
Signal samples are generated using a modified beam energy of 40 GeV. The
effect on the acceptance at truth level is found to be consistent with unity, and
an uncertainty of 1% is applied (LHCBeam).
5.10 Binning Optimisation
The statistical methods used to analyse the mass spectra are capable of devel-
oping instabilities if there are bins which contain no background prediction. In
addition, the presence of a large number of bins results in the requirement of large
amounts of processor time. To reduce the processor time required, and to avoid
the development of instabilities, wider bins may be used. This can be problematic
as it results in a reduction in sensitivity. To obtain a suitable binning, advantage
was taken of the the fact that, for both the bulk RS graviton model and the
EGM model, the resonance width increases with the pole mass. This effect is
amplified due to the energy and momentum dependence of the calorimeter and
tracker resolutions.
The invariant mass distributions were rebinned following an exponential func-
tion to ensure that the peak is always reconstructed within the same number of
bins. The reconstructed mlljj (LR and HR) and mllJ (MR) distributions for the
RS graviton and EGM W  boson are shown in figure 5.12 for a range of signal
pole masses.
To determine the binning, each signal sample is fitted with a Gaussian tem-
plate. The extracted signal widths are plotted against the resonance pole mass
in figure 5.13. From this the bin width w, for a given reconstructed mass m, is
given by
w = 1.5 GeV e0.0011m + 2.9, (5.2)
where the bin edges are rounded to the nearest 10 GeV.

At high reconstructed masses, the number of background MC events per bin
is very small. The exponential binning results in much larger bin widths in the
region with the fewest simulated events. In addition, the mass distribution for
each region is truncated at high mass and uses an overflow bin. The start of
the overflow bin is determined by integrating the mass spectra downwards from
5 TeV until the statistical uncertainty of the summed MC background is less than
60% of the overflow content. An underflow bin is also used, chosen such that the
turn on of the signal region is entirely contained within one bin.
This ensures that the bins are everywhere narrow enough to resolve a signal
peak, but wide enough the maintain a non-zero background prediction everywhere
and minimize the required processor time. Rebinning in this manner has minimal
effect on the sensitivity of the extracted results.
5.11 Statistical Procedure
The statistical analysis is performed using binned maximum-likelihood fits to
the diboson invariant mass spectra using the standard statistical fitting package
RooStats [98].
Systematic uncertainties on the signal and background are accounted for by
Nuisance Parameters (NP) in a likelihood function. For each background and
signal sample s, a histogram h0s, is provided. For a systematic uncertainty p, a
pair of histograms, h+sp and h
sp, represent the positive and negative systematic
fluctuations. The sample sp (p) is defined for the nuisance parameter p such
that sp (0) = h
s, and sp (1) = hsp. A Gaussian constraint with mean 0 and
width 1 is applied to each nuisance parameter.
The template histograms are based on finite-statistics MC samples, so NP to
account for the bin-by-bin statistical uncertainties on the template histograms are
introduced using the Barlow-Beeston lite method [99]. One nuisance parameter
is introduced for each bin in each channel, representing the statistical errors in
that bin from each of the components added in quadrature.
5.11.1 Template Morphing
The expected number of events for all values of the NP are interpolated and
extrapolated from the nominal and fluctuated histograms provided. A vertical
morphing technique is used [100]. The vertical morphing technique is a computa-
tionally simple method for interpolating between two binned distributions. Each
bin of the distribution is considered independently, and a parametrisation is cre-
ated to smoothly change the bin content between the extremal points provided.
The same parameter is used for all of the bins, which subsequently transforms
the entire distribution. The precise form of this parametrisation is chosen de-
pendent on the application, and can be used to extrapolate beyond the initial
distributions.

Figure 5.14: Illustration of the behaviour of the linear vertical (left) and integral (right)
morphing algorithms with a single nuisance parameter representing either a shape (top)
or scale (bottom) uncertainty. The magenta curves are the interpolated distributions
half way between the red and blue template distributions. The integral morphing
handles both cases correctly, whereas vertical interpolation fails in the instance of a
large scale variation.
Vertical morphing is valid for normalisation uncertainties, shape uncertain-
ties, and scale uncertainties with the condition that the scale variation must not
be large in comparison to the width of the peak. In the situation where the scale
variation is much larger than the peak width, the vertical morphing method is
not valid as shown in figure 5.14. In this instance more sophisticated morphing
techniques are necessary, such as integral morphing. Vertical morphing is com-
putationally much quicker than alternative techniques, and for this reason is the
preferred choice whenever possible. Within this analysis, all the applied system-
atic scale uncertainties fall within the region of validity, whereby the horizontal
movement is smaller than the reconstructed signal width.
The vertical interpolation method has four possible parametrisations for inter-
polating and extrapolating the templates: piecewise linear, piecewise exponential,
quadratic interpolation with linear extrapolation, and polynomial interpolation
with exponential extrapolation [101]. An ideal method for this application must
have two features. Firstly, the method must ensure that the expected number
of events in each bin is never negative. Secondly, the method must ensure that
there are no discontinuities in the first order derivative, as a kink can cause dif-
ficulties for certain minimisation packages such as Minuit [102]. Of the four
methods, piecewise linear and quadratic interpolation with linear extrapolation
both permit negative values for bin content, and piecewise linear and piecewise
exponential methods generally generate kinks at p = 0. The only remaining
method, polynomial interpolation with exponential extrapolation, satisfies both
criteria for any input.
Using the polynomial interpolation and exponential extrapolation parametri-
sation, the expected number of events taking all NP into account is given by

The ai terms are fixed by requiring sp (1) = hsp, continuity at dsp/dp|p=1,
and that d2sp/d
p|p=1.
5.11.2 Profile Likelihoods
The quantity of signal above the background prediction can be measured through
a test statistic which contains all information from the invariant mass spectra [4].
This discriminant is a likelihood ratio, and for a single bin j, from channel i, with
predicted signal sij, background estimation bij, and data xij, takes the form
(xij) =
L(sij + bij|xij)
L(bij|xij)
. (5.5)
Taking aij to represent the total number of expected events (either b or s + b),
the likelihood L is given by
L(aij|xij) =
. (5.6)
In order to take into account multiple bins within a channel, or multiple orthogo-
nal channels, it is possible to create a combined likelihood by taking the product
L(a |x ) =
channels
bins
L(aij|xij). (5.7)
To measure or set limits on a signal, it is necessary to know the probability
p, of a test statistic exceeding the observed value. This p-value can equivalently
be expressed as a significance, Z. Significance is defined such that a variable
distributed as a Gaussian function has a probability p of being greater than Z
standard deviations away from its mean. It can be calculated using
Z = 1(1 p), (5.8)
where 1 is the quantile of the Gaussian function. It is considered that Z  3 is
an indication of signal existence, and Z  5 constitutes a discovery. Exclusion of
signal hypotheses is performed using the threshold p  0.05, which for a one-sided
distribution corresponds to Z  1.64.
A profile likelihood is used to calculate limits on the product of the production
cross-section and the branching ratio [103]. A profile likelihood is a variation on
likelihood ratios, where the signal region data is used to constrain the systematic
uncertainties. To search for positive signal two binned likelihood fits are per-
formed, one in which the signal is allowed to float, and one in which the signal is
fixed to zero. The likelihood ratio
() =
())
L(, )
, (5.9)
is calculated. Here  is the signal strength with  = 0 corresponding to the
background only hypothesis, and  = 1 the nominal signal hypothesis. The
statistical and systematic uncertainties are accounted for by a vector of NP, .
The vector
() contains the values of the NP that maximises the likelihood L,
for the specified  (conditional likelihood),  and  are the signal strength and
nuisance parameter values that maximise L (unconditional likelihood). The fit
is performed simultaneously over multiple signal regions. Where a systematic
uncertainty affects multiple signal regions, a single nuisance parameter is used.
The value of () is used to calculate the test statistic
2 ln(0)   0,
0  < 0,
(5.10)
from which a p-value is calculated for each mass point to check for deviation from
the SM.
To extract limits a second pair of binned ML fits is performed, one in which
the signal is allowed to float and one in which the signal is fixed to zero. The
likelihood ratio
() =
())
L(,)
  0,

L(0,(0))
 < 0,
(5.11)
is used to calculate the test statistic q(), given by
q =
2 ln ()   ,
0  > ,
(5.12)
To extract limits on the signal, the CLs method is used [4].
For a given analysis, both of these test statistics are used, first measuring the
consistency between background only hypothesis and data using q0, and subse-
quently extracting exclusion limits using q. Understanding of these test statis-
tics can be furthered by considering the graphical interpretations of the likelihood
curves. Example curves are shown in figure 5.15, with varying values of . The
test statistic q0 is the value of the curve at the interception with the y-axis. The
test statistic q equals the shown curves for  > mu, and zero otherwise. Limits
extracted at the 95% CL correspond to the signal strength for which q exceeds
the value of four, as marked in the figure. Note that the definition of  ensures
that the signal strength required for exclusion is always greater than zero.

5.11.3 Asymptotic Method
In order to measure or set limits on a signal, it is necessary to know the proba-
bility of a test statistic exceeding the observed value. This p-value is calculated
using the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the statistic. This can be
calculated by creating a large number of toy datasets through randomly sam-
pling the NP. This method requires a large amount of computing time and is not
always necessary. Instead it is possible to used the Wald approximation
 2 ln() =
( )2
+ O(1/
N), (5.13)
where  follows a Gaussian distribution centred on , with standard deviation 
and data sample size N . In the large sample limit, it is possible to calculate the
distribution exactly, and the approximation holds for fairly small sample sizes.
5.11.3.1 Discovery
The Wald approximation given in equation 5.13 gives
( )2
. (5.14)
Given that for discovery  = 0 is tested, this simplifies to
, (5.15)
and the test statistic given in equation 5.10 reduces to
2/2   0,
0  < 0.
(5.16)
Using this approximation, the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of q0 has
the form
f(q0|0) =
(q0) +
2 , (5.17)
giving the CDF
F (q0|0) = (
q0). (5.18)
The p-value for the test statistic can thus be calculated using
p0 = 1 F (q0|0), (5.19)
or equivalently, converting to significance
Z0 = 
1(1 p0) =
q0. (5.20)
5.11.3.2 Exclusion
As in the case of the discovery test statistic, the Wald approximation in equa-
tion 5.13 gives
( )2
. (5.21)
Given that for exclusion,  = 0 is tested, this simplifies to
, (5.22)
and the test statistic given in 5.12 reduces to
q 


 2
 < 0,
()2
0    ,
0  > .
(5.23)
Using this approximation, the PDF of q has the form
f(q|) =
(q) +
2q
2 0 < q  2/2,
2(/)
(q+2/2)
8(/)2 q > 
2/2.
(5.24)
giving the CDF
F (q|) =
0 < q  2/2,
q+
q > 
2/2.
(5.25)
The p-value for the test statistic can thus be calculated using
p = 1 F (q|). (5.26)
To set limits at a confidence level of 1 , the substitution p =  is made, and
equation 5.26 is solved for , giving
up = + 
1(1 ). (5.27)
5.12 Signal Region Selection
The profile likelihood is performed simultaneously over multiple signal regions,
however not all of the regions are sensitive for each signal mass point. A signal
region is only used if it contributes more than 5% of the total signal acceptance.
The signal regions used for each mass point of the bulk RS graviton and the EGM
W  boson are shown in table 5.3.
The expected limits on cross-section for the low-pT , high-pT and merged selec-
tion regions and their contributions to the combined limit are shown in figure 5.16,
where only statistical uncertainties have been considered.
5.13 Nuisance Parameter Selection
Systematics that are deemed to have a negligible effect on the mass spectra are
removed from the statistical analysis. Removing surplus NP reduces the calcu-
lation complexity and increases the fit stability. To determine if an uncertainty
is significant, two tests are performed. A normalisation uncertainty, p, is only
kept for a sample if the normalisation of either h+sp or h
sp differs from that of the
nominal sample h0s, by greater than 0.5 , where  is the statistical uncertainty
of the nominal. For shape uncertainties a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [104]
is performed between the nominal and systematically shifted sample. A shape
uncertainty is kept for a particular sample if
h0s, h
h0s, h
< 0.1. (5.28)

A summary of the systematics that pass each of these selection criteria is given
in table 5.4.
5.14 Effects of Including Systematics
The introduction of systematics to the limit calculation leads to a decreased sen-
sitivity. The degradation in expected sensitivity due to the inclusion of a specific
systematic can be calculated in the following way. Initially the expected limit on
cross-section when all systematics are applied, all, is calculated. The calculation
is repeated, omitting the systematic of interest to obtain the expected cross-
Table 5.4: A summary of the systematic uncertainties used in the statistical analysis
after small uncertainties have been neglected. A systematic uncertainty that is used
as a normalisation uncertainty for at least one background or signal sample is labelled
with an N, and similarly shape uncertainties that are used for at least one signal or
background sample are labelled with an S. Systematic uncertainties that were found
to not contribute a significant shape or normalisation uncertainty to any signal or
background samples are omitted from the table.

when a new signal region becomes dominant, the sensitivity degradation due to
the inclusion of systematics increases. In particular this is due to the Z+jets

5.15 Results
5.15.1 Unblinded Signal Region
After using MC to optimise the analysis search strategy, the data in the signal
region are unblinded, and consistency is checked between the data and simulated
background. The comparison of the invariant mass spectra for the electron and
muon channels in the low-pT , high-pT and merged regions are shown in figure 5.18
and table 5.5. There are no significant deviations observed above the background
prediction that cannot be attributed to statistical or systematic fluctuations.

5.15.2 Validation of Statistical Analysis
The validity of the use of ML, and the treatment of the NP is tested. It is im-
portant that NP do not display large unexpected correlations to each other, as
this is an indication that the likelihood ratio is behaving poorly. The asymptotic
method chosen is more robust under correlations between NP than similar alter-
native techniques [103]. It is important that the NP are not drawn too far away
from their nominal values, as this is indicative of the data being poorly modelled;
and that they are not over constrained by the data, as this indicates that system-
atic uncertainties are over estimated. A small number of strong correlations, or
a large number of moderate correlations can lead to unexpected behaviour in the
mass distribution under simultaneous morphing of multiple parameters [100]. The
measured NP pulls and correlations for the conditional ML, performed simultane-
ously over all signal regions, are shown in figures 5.19 and 5.20, respectively. The
largest constraints and pulls on NP are present for the data driven uncertainties
on the normalisation and shape of the Z+jets background. These uncertainties
 = 0.00

are derived from the statistical uncertainty of the data in the control regions, and
are conservatively estimated. It is therefore to be expected that the signal regions
are capable of constraining these uncertainties. These pulls and constraints are
not sufficiently large as to raise major concerns and all correlations are small and
below 20%.
5.15.3 Results of Statistical Analysis
A good agreement is observed between the data and the background prediction.
The p-value ranges between 0.98 and 0.1 for both the bulk RS graviton and
EGM W  boson, as shown in figure 5.21. The local significance only exceeds one
standard deviation for a graviton with a pole mass of 350 GeV.
In the absence of a significant excess, upper limits are set at the 95% CL
on the product of the cross-section and branching ratio for both models, shown

Diboson Resonance Search
Combination
6.1 Introduction
The ATLAS Collaboration have performed a number of analyses searching for
the bulk RS graviton and EGM W  boson, decaying to V V , where V represents
either a W or Z boson. A summary of these analyses is given in table 6.1.
Table 6.1: A summary of the diboson resonance searches performed by ATLAS with
the Run 1 dataset. An X represents either a bulk RS graviton or EGM W  boson.

To improve the sensitivity to exotic resonances, the four analyses performed
with data collected with
s = 8 TeV, ```, ``qq, `qq and the qqqq, are com-
bined. The fully hadronic analysis is also referred to as the JJ analysis, as it
uses large-R jets exclusively. The result of the combination is interpreted using
the EGM W  boson with c = 1, and the bulk RS graviton with k/MPl = 1.0.
The diboson resonances have similar branching ratios to `qq, ``qq, and ```
as shown in figure 6.1. The leptonic and semi-leptonic analyses have similar
background sources present, and use similar MC techniques to model the back-
grounds. The fully hadronic analysis contends with a much higher level of QCD
background, and so uses a data driven technique to model the background dis-
tribution. Theses analyses have comparable sensitivities through a large mass
range.

6.2 Analysis Channels
The analyses which are used for this combination each select a different number
of leptons. In general the lepton selection criteria are different in each analysis.
In order to ensure that all of the signal regions used in the combination are
statistically independent, a common set of loose lepton selection criteria is defined
for the purposes of vetoing, as described in section 5.4.
6.2.1 Three Lepton
The three lepton analysis, ```, uses several signal regions in order to optimise
sensitivity over a large signal mass range [71]. The selection regions share the
same nomenclature as the ``qq channel, and are referred to as the LR and HR,
which are both subdivided into four selection regions based on how many of
the final state leptons are electrons. The background expectation is generated
from MC, and is dominated by SM WZ production. The theoretical uncertainty
for the prediction of the WZ background is the dominant systematic, and is
approximately 10%. For the HR, the background prediction is extrapolated to
very high mass by fitting two power-law functions to the simulated background.
The first fit is performed to the SM WZ background, and the second is fitted
to the remaining sub-dominant backgrounds. The predicted and observed mass
spectra for the two selection regions are shown in figure 6.2.

Figure 6.2: The predicted and observed ``` invariant mass spectra for the LR (left)
and HR (right), summed over all lepton flavour combinations. The uncertainty bands
shown account for the MC statistical uncertainties and all background systematic un-
certainties.
No significant excess is observed and mass limits are extracted using a profile
likelihood method using the q test statistic. For the production of the EGM
W  boson, expected and observed mass limits are set at 1.49 TeV and 1.52 TeV
respectively. The corresponding limit on the production times cross-section ob-
tained is shown in figure 6.3. Due to the limited amount of data, particularly
in the high mass tail, this analysis uses toys to extract limits in preference to
asymptotics. This method, coupled with the lack of events at high mass, results
in the absence of negative error bands on the expected limit. Due to the charged
final state, this search is not sensitive to the neutral RS graviton resonance.

theoretical uncertainty in the NNLO calculation.
6.2.2 One Lepton
The one lepton analysis for the `qq final state, uses several signal regions to
optimise the sensitivity over a large signal mass range [73]. These regions share
the same nomenclature as the ``qq channel, namely LR, HR and MR, with each
region being subdivided by lepton flavour. Both the LR and HR regions select
two resolved hadron jets, with more stringent pT requirements placed on both
the leptonic and hadronic sides of the event in the HR. The hadronic side of an
event in the MR comprises a single large-R jet which uses the BDRS-A filtering
algorithm. The dominant background is V+jets, and the dominant uncertainty
is due to the normalisation of this background. The normalisation of the V+jets
background in each selection region is derived from a fit to the EmissT distributions
in control region data, independently for both lepton flavours. The uncertainty
on this normalisation ranges from 3% to 4% in the LR and HR, and 15% to
18% in the MR. The expected and observed `jj and `J mass spectra for the
selection regions are shown in figure 6.4.
Figure 6.4: The predicted and observed `jj and `J invariant mass spectra for the
LR (top left), HR (top right) and MR (bottom).
No significant excess is observed, and mass limits are set using a profile like-
lihood method using the q test statistic. Mass limits for the production of the
EGM W  boson and bulk RS graviton are found to be 1490 GeV and 700 GeV
respectively. The corresponding limits on the production times cross-section ob-
tained is shown in figure 6.5.
Figure 6.5: The expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the product the of
production cross-section and branching ratio as a function of pole mass of the EGM
W  boson (left) and RS graviton (right) for the `qq channel. The band around the
EGM cross-section is due to the theoretical uncertainty in the NNLO calculation.
6.2.3 Fully Hadronic
The fully hadronic channel, qqqq, selects two large-R jets with BDRS-A filter-
ing [74]. These jets are required to have < 30 tracks associated to them, prior
to the application of the grooming process described in section 4.5.3. This re-
quirement is the source of the dominant uncertainty. The masses of the large-R
jets are required to satisfy |mJJ mV | < 13 TeV. This creates the three signal
regions, WW , WZ and ZZ, which are not statistically independent.
The background dijet mass distribution is modelled by the smoothly falling
function
= p1 (1 x)
p2p3 xp3 , (6.1)
where x = mJJ/
s, p1 is the normalisation, p2 and p3 are dimensionless shape
parameters, and  is a dimensionless quantity chosen after fitting which minimises
the correlation between p2 and p3. This functional form is chosen as it is capable
of modelling a wide range of smooth, monotonically decreasing distributions,
while being incapable of accommodating resonances. The ML fit is performed in
the range 1.05 TeV < mJJ < 3.55 TeV, which ensures that the trigger is fully
efficient for the boson tagged jets and that the entirety of the high energy tail is
included.
Figure 6.6: The data and fitted dijet mass spectra for the WW (top left), ZZ (top
right), and WZ (bottom) signal regions.
The mass distributions shown in figure 6.6 show an excess at 2 TeV. The
largest excess is found in the WZ signal region, with a significance of 3.4  as
shown in figure 6.7.
Figure 6.7: The observed p-value for the fully hadronic channel. The largest excess is
found for the WZ channel with a significance of 3.4 .
Limits are set on the product of the production cross-section and branching
ratio for W   WZ, G  WW and G  ZZ using a profile likelihood method
using the q test statistic as shown in figure 6.8.
6.3 Combination Strategy
This analysis is composed of a total of 21 signal regions when lepton flavour is
accounted for. All of the channels are ensured to be statistically independent
by vetoing on the number of leptons passing loose lepton requirements which
are common to all four analyses. Statistical independence is ensured between
the signal regions contained within each analysis, meaning that all of the signal
regions considered for the combination are in turn independent. This allows for
a search to be performed and limits set simultaneously over all of the signal
regions using q0 and q profile likelihood test statistics respectively as described
in section 5.11.
Figure 6.8: The expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the product of the
production cross-section and branching ratio as a function of pole mass for G WW
(top left), G  ZZ (top right) and W   WZ (bottom) for the qqqq channel. Note
that the cross-sections shown for the EGM W  use a LO calculation.
The leptonic and semi-leptonic analyses do not observe excesses comparable
to that seen in the fully hadronic analysis. For this reason, the combination is
initially performed for the EGM W  boson only, using the leptonic and semi-
leptonic final states.
6.4 Modifications to Analysis Channels
Where possible the analyses have remained unaltered from their published forms.
In some instances it is necessary to apply modifications in order to perform the
combination.
The analyses contained within the combination use two possible decay chan-
nels of the RS graviton; the lqq channel searches for G  WW decay, and the
``qq channels searches for G  ZZ decay. The qqqq channel searches separately
for the WW and ZZ decay channels, using statistically interdependent datasets.
The combination sets limits on the G  V V decay, and so the union of the WW
and ZZ selection criteria is taken in the fully hadronic channel.
Setting limits on the decay into V V introduces a model dependency due to
the relative branching ratio of the G  ZZ and G  WW decays. The values
of these branching ratios as a function of the graviton pole mass are shown in
figure 6.9.

Figure 6.9: The branching ratios of the four largest bulk RS graviton decay paths
against graviton pole mass.
In the leptonic and semi-leptonic analyses, a NNLO k-factor is applied to the
W  production cross-section. At high resonant mass the value of the k-factor
fluctuates greatly [83]. The fully hadronic analysis, which probes masses higher
than the other analyses, uses the LO cross-section. For the combination, the
cross-section is reverted to that of the LO calculation in all channels.
The signal pole mass range over which limits are set is changed to optimise the
effect of the combination. The mass ranges used for both the EGM W  boson and
the bulk RS graviton samples in the individual analyses are noted in table 6.2.
For the ``` and ``qq channels, the signal mass range is extended to 2500 GeV,
and signal masses above 2500 GeV used in the qqqq channel are discarded.

bination.

`qq 300 GeV 2500 GeV 300 GeV 2500 GeV
qqqq 1200 GeV 3000 GeV 1200 GeV 2500 GeV
The combination can only be performed for signal mass points which are com-
mon to all four analyses. The ``` channel uses the finest mass spacing 50 GeV,
and both the `qq and qqqq analyses used 100 GeV. The ``qq channel used a
combination of 50 GeV below 1000 GeV, and 100 GeV above. The combination
must use the coarsest granularity of the component analyses, and so 100 GeV is
used.
The ``` channel suffers with an instability in the limit setting procedure
caused by having very low numbers of expected background events in some bins
of the ``` mass distribution. This results in multiple mass points failing to
converge on a limit. None of the problematic mass points are adjacent, and so
the fine granularity allows an interpolation between the limits of the neighbouring
mass points to be performed. In the coarser granularity regime of the combination
this is not a feasible possibility. The background is rebinned, removing the low
event counts present in the background prediction. An exponential binning is
introduced to the LR, and the HR is truncated slightly to ensure the turn on is
contained within a single bin as shown in figure 6.10.

6.5 Systematic Uncertainties
In addition to the systematic uncertainties described in section 5.9, there are a
number of uncertainties introduced into the combination. In the `qq channel, an
uncertainty is applied to the b-tagging efficiency (BTAG EFF). Each of the back-
ground components of the `qq channel has two uncertainties applied accounting
for the normalisation and shape independently. The naming of these uncertainties
follows the for LVQQ sample region, where sample represents one of QCD (QCD),
top quark (TOP), V+jets (VJETS), or SM diboson (VV), and region represents the
LR (LRR), HR (HRR) or MR (MR).
The ``` channel introduces uncertainties on the predictions of the SM di-
boson background (WZShape, WZTheo, WZXSection, and ZZXSection), the top
quark background (TtbarvXSection) and the fake lepton background (Fake).
One further uncertainty is introduced due to the fit performed on the background
distribution in the HR (Fit).
Additional uncertainties are applied to account for the electron trigger and re-
construction (ElecTrig, ElecReco, ElecIDSF, ElecIsoIPSF and ElecLSF). The
electron energy scale is parametrised as three independent parameters: ElecLESPS,
ElecLESR12, and ElecLESZeeAll, the last of which replaces ElecLES, referred
to in the previous chapter.
Three additional scale factor uncertainties are applied to account for muon
reconstruction (MuonIsoIPSF, MuonReco and MuonTrig), and one uncertainty as
a result of the MS (MuonMS).
Two systematic uncertainties are introduced to model the Missing Transverse
Energy (MET) scale (METSoftScale) and resolution (METSoftReso).
Additional parameters are included in the `qq and ``` channels to account
for the small-R jet JES (JESBase0, JESBase1, JESBase2, JESBase3, JESBase4,
JESBase5, and JESBjet). This is not independent to the parametrisation used in
the ``qq analysis; however, correlations are sufficiently small between parameters
to not impact the analysis.
The qqqq analysis introduces an uncertainty on the number of tracks associ-
ated to large-R jets (trk).
Where possible systematics that are common to multiple channels are parametrised
by a single nuisance parameter. Table 6.3 shows the NP that are used in multiple
channels. Due to different parametrisations of the small-R JES, there are several
NP that are unique to the ``qq channel. These are intrinsically correlated to the
complementary set of NP used in the `qq and ``` channels; however, no two
parameters have sufficiently high correlation to impact the analysis.
The dominant background in the ``` channel is SMWZ diboson production.
The normalisation and shape uncertainties on this background are the dominant
systematics uncertainties in the combination for signal masses < 1 TeV. The
V +jets background is dominant in the `qq channel. For  1 TeV signal masses,
Table 6.3: Uncertainties that are applied to multiple channels in the combination.
These are considered fully correlated between channels, and share common parameters
in the likelihood fits. Systematics that are present only in one channel are omitted
from this table.

the uncertainty of the V + jets background normalisation in the MR of the `qq
channel is the dominant systematic uncertainty. In the combination for signal
masses > 2 TeV, the shape uncertainty of the V + jets background in the MR of
the `qq channel is the dominant systematic uncertainty. The systematics which
produce the largest sensitivity degradations are shown in figure 6.11.
6.6 Signal Region Selection
Not all of the signal regions are sensitive to all signal masses, in particular the
fully hadronic channel which uses only large-R jets has little sensitivity at low
mass. For this reason not all of the signal regions are used to set limits on each
signal mass point. The signal regions used for the EGM W  boson are shown in
table 6.4.
6.7 Validation of Statistical Analysis
The validity of the use of ML, and the treatment of the NP is tested. These checks
were previously performed in the respective analyses of the component channels,
and where large correlations or pulls were observed, the NP were investigated
and the cause understood. For this reason only correlations, strong pulls or
pull constraints arising from the combination of the analyses are considered as a
concern. There is no signal mass for which all signal regions are used, and so two
test signal masses, 600 GeV and 1200 GeV, are chosen to verify the validity of
the statistical analysis.
It is important that nuisance parameters do not display unexpected correla-
tions to each other, as this could lead to poor behaviour of the likelihood ratio.
The correlation matrices for the 600 GeV and 1200 GeV W  boson are shown in
figure 6.12 and 6.13, respectively. There are a small number of moderate corre-

modelling in the LR of the `qq channel. The systematics associated to these
NP affect only the `qq channel, and the correlation is understood in the respec-
tive analysis. No new large correlations are generated due to the combination
procedure.
The pulls of the nuisance parameters from the nominal values, and the con-
straints applied by the data are evaluated to ensure the systematics accurately
represent the data. In figure 6.14, large constraints are present for the Z + jets
normalisation uncertainty in the ``qq channel, and the top quark shape uncer-
tainty for the LR of the `qq channel. The systematics associated to these NP

6.8.1 Leptonic Combination
The test statistic q0 is used to quantify the deviation between the data and
background prediction for the combination of the leptonic and semi-leptonic final
states. The p-value for the test statistic has a maximum deviation of 2.2  at
300 GeV. At 2 TeV, where the fully hadronic analysis observed an excess, the
data are consistent with the background only hypothesis within 1 .
Limits are extracted at the 95% CL on the production of the EGM W  boson
for the combination of the leptonic and semi-leptonic channels, as shown in fig-
ure 6.16. Expected and observed mass limits are extracted to be 1770 GeV and
1830 GeV, respectively.

6.8.2 Full Combination
The p-values are derived from the q0 test statistic for the combination of the signal
regions from all four channels is shown in figure 6.17. The largest deviation from
the background only hypothesis is observed at 2 TeV. For the EGM W  boson and
RS graviton, the deviations are 2.5  and 1.8 , respectively. These deviations
significantly reduced from the 3.4  observed in the fully hadronic analysis.
The limits set at the 95% CL for the combination of all four channels for the
bulk RS graviton and the EGM W  boson are shown in figure 6.18. The EGM
W  boson has expected and observed mass limits set at 1800 GeV and 1810 GeV,
respectively, and the bulk RS graviton has expected and observed mass limits set
at 790 GeV and 810 GeV respectively.
6.8.3 Leptonic and Hadronic Result Consistency
The likelihood distributions for each of the analyses are shown in figure 6.19. To
quantify the consistency of the channels a new test statistic is defined. In this
statistic the unconditional ML allows the signal strength to be different in each
channel. The statistic is given as
q = 2 ln  () , (6.2)
where the likelihood ratio () is given by

The test statistic can thus be rewritten as

In the case of this combination the sets of NP applicable to the leptonic
and hadronic channels, lep and had are not independent. However, it has been
shown that there are no large pulls or correlations on the NP introduced due to
the combination, so the form of q given in equation 6.6 is a good approximation.
The new test statistic is shown in figure 6.20 for a 2 TeV signal mass, where
the signal strength has been scanned independently in the leptonic and hadronic
channels. The contours shown in this plot are given for one degree of freedom,
which means that they provide the correct coverage when a projection is taken,
for instance along lep = had which results in the combined likelihoods given in
figure 6.19 with the addition of a constant; or along the red curve, which results
in the likelihoods shown in figure 6.21.
The p-values for the hadronic and leptonic channels being consistent are 0.0047
and 0.0019 for the RS graviton and EGM W  boson respectively, as shown in
figure 6.21. The hadronic channel, which observes an excess with a local p-value of
0.00029 for a 2 TeV W  boson is thus displaying a level of tension with the leptonic
channels, though this tension is insufficient to indicate that a separate signal
parameter is required to describe the leptonic and hadronic channels separately.
There are several theories beyond the SM that predict the existence of reso-
nances at the TeV scale; however, these hypotheses cannot account for an excess
in a single channel. The tension seen between the leptonic and hadronic chan-
nels thus suggests that the excess observed in the hadronic channel is due to a
statistical fluctuation.

Conclusion
Several theories have been proposed to extend the Standard Model. Two such
models, the bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model and the Extended Gauge Model
(EGM), predict the production of narrow resonances with masses close to the
TeV scale. In this thesis, searches for such exotic diboson resonances close to the
TeV scale are performed, using the bulk RS graviton and the EGM W  boson as
benchmark models. The dataset used has an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb1,
collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass
energy of
s = 8 TeV.
New techniques for reconstructing the decay products of vector bosons in
boosted topologies are applied. The reconstruction efficiency of leptonically de-
caying Z bosons with transverse momenta pT > 1 TeV is significantly increased
with the development of dilepton isolation criteria. Merged jets are used to recon-
struct hadronically decaying vector bosons, increasing the acceptance significantly
for bosons with pT > 250 GeV.
A search is performed in the ``qq final state. The results have been published
in reference [2]. Backgrounds are modelled using MC techniques and control
regions are used to constrain the dominant background prediction. The dominant
uncertainties in this analysis are a result of this constraint. Profile likelihood
methods are employed to quantify the agreement of the data with the background
prediction, and no significant excess is observed. Limits are set at the 95% CL on
the product of cross-section and branching ratio for the production of the EGM
W  boson (NNLO) and bulk RS graviton. Observed mass limits are extracted,
excluding the W  boson and the graviton below a mass of 1590 GeV and 740 GeV,
respectively.
In addition, a combination of the ```, ``qq, `qq and qqqq final states is
performed. Preliminary results of this combination have been published [3]. The
combination of these channels leads to a significantly improved sensitivity as the
individual channels are similarly sensitive to the benchmark models. The analy-
ses are each statistically independent, and where systematic uncertainties affect
multiple channels, the effects are correlated. The dominant systematic uncer-
tainties affecting the combined sensitivity are those associated to the dominant
background predictions in the ``` channel for low signal masses, and the `qq
channel for high signal masses. The qqqq analysis observes a 3.4  excess at
a resonance mass of 2 TeV. No excess is observed in the one, two and three
lepton analyses. The combination of the leptonic and semi-leptonic channels is
performed, with no excess observed. The fully hadronic channel is shown to be
consistent with the combination of the leptonic and semi-leptonic channels within
3 . The leptonic, semi-leptonic and fully hadronic channels are combined to set
limits at the 95% CL on the product of the cross-section and branching ratio
for the EGM W  boson (LO) and bulk RS graviton. Mass limits are extracted,
excluding a W  boson below a mass of 1810 GeV and a graviton below a mass of
810 GeV.
The combination presented here concludes the searches for exotic diboson
resonance performed in ATLAS with the Run 1 dataset. The sensitivity to these
resonances can be expected to be increased with a combination of early Run 2
analyses due to the increased centre of mass energy of 13 TeV.
