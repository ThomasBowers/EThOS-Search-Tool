Abstract 
In order to increase the public approval of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels, 
developments in waste management of high-level liquid waste must be made. Fission 
products, such as 137Cs and 90Sr, are highly radiotoxic and principal heat generators in high-
level liquid waste. Removal of these fission products would reduce the radiotoxicity, the long-
term heat generation and the volume of high-level liquid waste enabling the simplification of 
storage design for nuclear waste. 127Cs and 90Sr are also environmental contaminants caused 
by past nuclear disasters. Removal of these contaminants from the environment would reduce 
the risk of health complications in both animals and humans. This thesis outlines the synthesis 
and extraction capabilities of caesium and strontium selective ligands on solid-supported 
extractants including magnetic nanoparticles and macroscopic silica gel for the selective 
separation of caesium and strontium from other group I and II elements. Recovery of 
fission/corrosion products using N-donor extractants is also reported.

1.1 Introduction 
Fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas contribute greatly to global warming and are becoming 
increasingly scarce as they are non-renewable. Cleaner methods of power generation, 
particularly renewable methodologies, need to be adopted to maintain the supply of energy 
in developed countries, to withstand increased future demand and provide supply resilience 
to avoid political and social upheaval. Nuclear power, along with sources of renewable energy, 
remains the main focus in energy production. In 2016, Nuclear power generated 11% of the 
worlds energy, despite crude oil, coal and natural gas still dominating the provision.13 
Developed countries have invested the most into nuclear power. For example, the UK 
generated 21% of its energy in 2016 from nuclear reactors. Today 65 nuclear reactors are 
under construction around the world which will contribute 64 GW of energy per annum.2 In 
many senses, nuclear energy is a clean energy source with  no emissions of CO2 or nitrogen 
and sulfur oxides, greenhouse gases associated with fossil fuel use. However, a major 
drawback with nuclear power is the toxic waste fuel that is produced and must be managed 
safely into the long distant future.4 In 2013 an estimated 370,000 tonnes of spent fuel had 
been produced by nuclear reactors around the world.5 Of the 370,000 tonnes of spent fuel, 
120,000 tonnes has been reprocessed with the remainder in storage awaiting reprocessing or 
long term disposal.5 Nuclear waste contains very low level waste (VLLW), low level waste 
(LLW), intermediate level waste (ILW) and high level waste (HLW). VLLW and LLW make up 
more than 95% of nuclear waste but more than 95% of the radioactivity is produced by ILW 
and HLW.5 With inventories of nuclear waste increasing each year, long-term management 
and safe disposal of waste needs to be established to combat this issue.6 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Figure 1.1 Fission of a nucleus 
Nuclear power is created during the fission of 235U92. Nuclear fission results from the action of 
thermal neutrons bombarding heavy nuclides leading to splitting of the original nucleus into 
fission products of smaller mass (Figure 1.1).7 In nuclear reactors 235U92 is bombarded with 
thermal neutrons, splitting the it into two smaller nuclides and more neutrons that continue 
the fission process.7 The number of neutrons released per nucleus is between 2-3, producing 
energy (2 x 1010 kJmol-1 of 235U)  about two million times that obtained by burning an equal 
mass of coal.7 Each neutron formed can initiate another nuclear reaction producing a 
branching chain reaction.7 Left uncontrolled, this branching chain reaction would lead to a 
violent explosion producing a massive amount of energy.7 Energy harnessed from the nuclear 
fission of 235U92 must be a controlled process. Neutrons released from the fission of 235U92 pass 
through a moderator (graphite or D2O) that causes a loss of their kinetic energy.7 The neutrons 
then either initiate further nuclear fission of 235U92 or are captured by 238U92. Of the uranium 
fuel source UF6, only 5% contains 235U92 after enrichment.8 238U92 is the most abundant isotope 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
of uranium, which is converted to 239U92 after neutron capture.7 239U92 can then be partly 
converted to 239Pu94 via  decay.7,9  
238U92 + 1n  239U92 +  
239U92 - -  239Np93  239Pu94 
Equation 1.1 Nuclear fission of 238U92 
239Pu94 is a secondary nuclear fuel that is used in mixed oxide (MOX) reactors, consisting of a 
mixture of uranium(IV) oxide and plutonium(IV) oxides.7,911 This process of isotope 
production is called bleeding.7 Poisoning of the nuclear fuel source occurs when the fission 
products begin to absorb neutrons rather than releasing them.7 This leads to a net decrease 
in neutron concentration leading to the need for replacement with new fuel.7 Spent fuel 
contains mainly 238U (94%) and short-lived fission products that constitute a low long-term 
hazard.12 However, 4-5 wt% of the spent fuel consists of fission products including strontium, 
caesium, iodine and technetium, 1 wt% of plutonium and 0.1 wt% minor actinides (Am, Cm, 
Np), the latter being  highly radiotoxic in the long-term (Figure 1.2).12,13 These highly radiotoxic 
fission products are found in ILW and HLW and are the main concern in the disposal of spent 
fuel. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel leads to reduction in the radiotoxicity and long term 
heat production and reduces the total volume of HLW.4 This would enable the simplification 
of storage design, increase the capacity of storage and increase public acceptance of nuclear 
power.4

1.2.1 PUREX Process 
The first  and currently only - stage in reprocessing is the Plutonium and URanium EXtraction 
(PUREX) process that is utilised in current reprocessing plants. The purpose of this stage is to 
partition plutonium and uranium from the minor actinides and other fission products. This is 
so that the plutonium and uranium can be recycled and converted into uranium oxide or 
mixed oxide (MOX) fuels for reuse in nuclear reactors.10,11 The PUREX process begins with the 
immersion of fuel rods in ponds of water for up to 3 months.10,14 Short-lived and highly 
radioactive fission products such as 131I decay during this time.14 The fuel rods are then 
dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (7 M) forming UO2(NO3)2, Pu(NO3)4 and other metal 
nitrates.10,14 The uranium and plutonium nitrates are then extracted using a 20-30% solution 
of tributyl phosphate (TBP)(Figure 1.3) in kerosene.10,14

Uranium (VI) and plutonium (IV) are extracted into the organic kerosene via the complexes 
[UO2(NO3)2(tbp)2] and [Pu(NO3)4(tbp)2], leaving lanthanides, minor actinides and fission 
products in the aqueous phase as they do not form strong complexes with TBP.10,14 Uranium 
is then partitioned from plutonium by redox chemistry. A suitable reducing agent, typically 
uranous nitrate (U(IV)) is used to reduce Pu(IV) to Pu(III).11,14

Equation 1.2 Redox reaction of Pu(IV) and U(IV) 
The reduction of Pu(IV) to Pu(III) facilitates the migration of plutonium into the aqueous phase 
as a result of  weak complexation between TBP and Pu(III).10,11,14 A possible complication is 
the re-oxidisation of Pu(III) to Pu(IV).11 This proceeds in the presence of nitrous acid from nitric 
acid (Equation 1.3).11 Hydrazine is added to the partitioning mixture to scavenge nitrous acid, 
which eliminates this issue.11

  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Once uranium and plutonium are separated, the uranyl nitrate is extracted into the aqueous 
phase and crystallised as the hydrate UO2(NO3)2.6H2O.14 The hydrate is thermally decomposed 
to UO3 followed by hydrogen reduction to regain UO2.14 The plutonium is re-oxidised to Pu(IV) 
with HNO3 and heated with oxalic acid, causing thermal decomposition to PuO2.14  
The current procedure for  dealing with the remaining fission products is evaporation and 
pyrolysis to convert the residue into a mixture of oxides.14 Fusion with silica and borax 
produces an inert borosilicate glass which encapsulates the radioactive materials, a process 
called vitrification.14   
However, the post-PUREX raffinate could be further reprocessed to allow for more 
manageable storage. Minor actinides, lanthanides and fission products all remain in the 
PUREX raffinate.6 Removal of the minor actinides from the raffinate would reduce storage 
time of the residual material from tens of thousands of years to a few hundred (Figure 1.5). If 
the minor actinides (americium and cerium) can be removed, the minor actinide oxides can 
be converted into shorter-lived (T1/2 = 101 years) or stable isotopes by transmutation.15,16 
Transmutation involves the bombardment of the minor actinides with neutrons, resulting in 
their conversion to shorter-lived isotopes.15,16 For transmutation to work, the minor actinides 
must be separated from the lanthanides.6 The lanthanides have high neutron capture cross-
sections and so will absorb neutrons preferentially, greatly reducing the efficiency of the 
transmutation of actinides. If it could be developed, a process of partitioning and 
transmutation would produce a more manageable waste form than that currently disposed.

1.2.2 DIAMEX Process 
The PUREX raffinate contains minor actinides, lanthanides and fission products. The first step 
of partitioning and transmutation is to co-extract both actinides and lanthanides using a non-
selective, diamide-based ligand.6,17 This process was developed by the French CEA 
(Commissariat  lEnergie Atomique) and is called DIAMide EXtraction (DIAMEX) process.6,17 
Diamide-based ligands (malonamide molecules) were first identified by Musikas et al. in 
1991.15,1820 Malonamide ligands have been reported to extract lanthanides (LnIII) and 
actinides (AnIII) efficiently from aqueous nitric acid.15,1820 The malonamide ligands also have 
the advantage of being solely composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (therefore 
subscribing to the CHON principle), allowing for calcination without the formation of sulfur 
or phosphorous-based acidic wastes.17 N, N-dimethyl-N,N- dioctyl[(hexyloxy)ethyl]-
malonamide (DMDOHEMA, 2) and N,N,N,N-tetraoctyldiglycolamide (TODGA, 3) are the 
benchmark ligands for the DIAMEX process, the latter showing high extraction efficiency for 
extraction of trivalent lanthanides and actinides, high solubility in paraffinic solvents (i.e. n-
dodecane) and poor solubility in aqueous media.2126  
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Figure 1.6 DMDOHEMA 2 and TODGA 3-5 
Improvements to TODGA have been made with the substitution of methyl groups - to the 
carbonyl in 3. Furthermore, Me-TODGA 4 and Me2-TODGA 5 display improved stability to 
high acidity and radiolytic flux in extraction processes.27 
1.2.3 SANEX Process 
The European approach to partitioning minor actinides from the lanthanides contained in 
DIAMEX raffinate is called the Selective ActiNide EXtraction (SANEX) process. Actinides and 
lanthanides share chemical similarities making separation difficult.28,29 The characteristic that 
has been targeted is the slightly greater spatial extension of the 5f orbitals compared to the 
6d orbitals in actinides than observed with the 4f  and 5d orbitals of the lanthanides as a result 
of a greater number of protons and electrons in the actinides series.30 The electrons donated 
by the ligand to the metal show a greater tendency to bind covalently in the actinide series 5f 
orbitals than in the 4f orbitals of the lanthanides.30 The 5f orbitals of actinides, being less 
shielded from the environment compared to 4f orbitals of the lanthanides, results in greater 
polarizability of the electrons that occupy the 5f orbitals.3033 This makes trivalent actinides 
more soft acceptors than the trivalent lanthanides.3033 Polydentate ligands containing 
soft N-donor sites have been found to exhibit good selectivity towards trivalent actinides. 
One of the first N-donor ligands investigated was 2,2:6,2-terpyridine 6 (TERPY). TERPY 6 was 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
studied with 2-bromodecanoic acid 12 as a synergist, which acts as a lipophilic anion source 
allowing TERPY 6 to selectively extract Am(III) from weakly acidic aqueous solutions with 
SF(Am/Eu) of 7.2.15 
Figure 1.7 Structure of TERPY 6-8, TPTZ 9-11 and 2-bromodecanoic acid 12 
However the D value for Am(III) decreases with increasing acidity because of protonation of 
the ligand causing solubility issues. Derivatives of TERPY with hydrophobic alkyl groups were 
investigated but lower distribution ratios for Am(III) were achieved. The increase of the 
basicity of the TERPY derivatives 7-8 led to competition between protonation of the donor 
atoms and metal ligation. Protonation of the ligands resulted in precipitation at the aqueous-
organic interface.6,15  
The central pyridine ring of TERPY was replaced with 1,3,5-triazine to reduce the basicity of 
the ligand leading to the formation of 2,4,6-tri-2-pyridyl-1,3,5-triazine 9 (TPTZ). TPTZs 
performed better than TERPY in solvent extraction studies. TPTZ 9, used with 2-
bromodecanoic acid 12 and hydrogenated tetrapropene (TPH) as the diluent, was one of the 
first N-donor ligands to achieve a SF(Am/Eu) of > 10. Despite the improved separation factor, 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
TPTZs were still protonated in highly acidic media greatly reducing the efficiency of the 
ligand.3436 
Introduction of a 1,2,4-triazine moiety allowed for extraction of both Am(III) and Eu(III) from 
highly concentrated solutions of HNO3 (1-4M) without the need for additional synergists or 
phase transfer agents. High SF(Am/Eu) of > 100 were reported for alkyl substituted 2,6-bis(1,2,4-
triazin-3-yl)pyridine (BTP) ligands 14-16.37,38  
Figure 1.8 Structure of BTP 13-18 
A key feature to this class of N-ligands is the -effect. The -effect occurs when atoms with 
non-bonding electron pairs are adjacent and accounts for strong nucleophilic donors when a 
nucleophile with an unshared pair of electrons is adjacent to the nucleophilic centre. 39,40 
Interactions between the unshared electrons on the adjacent atom raises its HOMO energy. 
This leads to N-donors having a decreased affinity for protons and increased affinity towards 
soft cations. The overlap between an adjacent non-bonding nitrogen lone pair with the 
bonding lone pair increases the covalent nature of the latter.41 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
The solubility of BTP was increased with tetra-iso-propyl 15 and tetra-propyl chains 16.38 In 
solvent extraction studies, the rate of extraction of Am(III) increased linearly as the 
concentration of BTP ligand increased. However, above 1M HNO3 the rate of extraction 
decreased because of protonation of the ligand. BTP ligands were tested on genuine PUREX 
raffinate; however, major radiolytic degradation was observed.18 
Harwood et al. hypothesised that the presence of benzylic hydrogen atoms on the side chains 
of BTP ligands were susceptible to degradation by reacting with hydroxyl radicals generated 
by radiolysis of water.6,15 Introduction of a side group with solubilising alkyl groups but no 
benzylic hydrogen atoms was proposed, leading to the formation of CyMe4 functionality. 
CyMe4-BTP 17 showed stability towards acid hydrolysis, survived boiling in 3M HNO3 and a 
benzannelated CyMe4 (BzCyMe4) derivative 18 was subject to -radiation up to 100 kGy 
showing good stability.42 Solvent extraction tests on CyMe4-BTP 17 produced high extraction 
efficiency (DAm  500) with a high SF(Am/Eu) of > 5000. The issue with CyMe4-BTP 17 is the high 
binding efficiency between the ligand and An(III) which doesnt allow for back extraction 
(stripping). CyMe4-BTP 17 binds in a 3:1 ratio with actinides, the metal centre being 9-
coordinate with 3 tridentate BTP ligands. This complex doesnt allow for external stripping 
agents to complex with the actinides.43,44  
6,6-Bis(1,2,4-trianz-3-yl)-2,2bipyridine ligands (BTBPs) have been investigated for use in the 
SANEX process. The tetradentate BTBP ligands allow for high affinity towards trivalent 
actinides in the presence of trivalent lanthanides and the ability for subsequent stripping. 
Having four N-donor groups induces a weaker ligand field resulting in 1:1 or 1:2 complexes 
and leaves room for a stripping species to interact.  
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
CyMe4-BTBP 25 is the current benchmark extractant for the SANEX process in Europe, 
synthesised by the Reading group from 2,2-bypyridine 19.16,45 In spiked solvent extraction 
experiments, 241Am(III) and 152Eu(III) radioisotopes are used to represent the actinides and 
lanthanides, respectively.6 An equilibrium ratio of metal concentration in the organic and 
aqueous phase (distribution ratio Dm) is used to quantify the effectiveness of a ligand.6 The 
ratio of the D values for Am and Eu (separation factor SF) can be used as a measure the 
selectivity of the ligand.6 CyMe4-BTBP 25 shows strong selectivity for Am(III) over Eu(III) 
(SFAm/Eu  150) but exhibits slow kinetics.36 Many BTBP analogues (Figure 1.7) have been 
investigated, but CyMe4-BTBP has displayed the most promise.16,36,43,44,46,47  
Figure 1.9 2,2bypyridine 19 and BTBP analogues 20-28 
The slow kinetics for extraction with CyMe4BTBP have been investigated, in particular looking 
closely at the conformations of the CyMe4-BTBP ligand. The favoured conformation of the 
uncomplexed ligand is trans; whereas the cis conformation needed for extraction is 5.7 kcal 
mol-1 higher in energy than the trans conformation, with an activation energy of 8.1 kcal mol-
1 causing the trans conformation to be favoured (Figure 1.9).48 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Figure 1.10 cis and trans conformation of CyMe4-BTBP 25 
To improve the kinetics of extraction by CyMe4-BTBP 25 the cis-locked 1,10-phenanthroline 
29 was utilised as the precursor rather than 2,2-bypyridine 19 used in the synthesis of BTBP. 
From neocuproine 30 the Harwood group developed a new class of ligands, the bis-triazine-
phenanthrolines (BTPhens).6,13,43    
Figure 1.11 Neocuproine 30 and CyMe4-BTPhen 31 
Extraction studies of CyMe4-BTPhen 30 in 1-octanol proved it to be more efficient than CyMe4-
BTBP 25. A high D value for Am(III) was obtained (DAm > 1000) while the D value for Eu(III) were 
approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower (DEu < 10).13 This resulted in high separation 
factors (SFAm/Eu  68 - 400) showing that CyMe4-PTPhen 30 extracts Am(III) in the presence of 
Eu(III) with high selectivity.13 The rate of extraction was also significantly improved (< 15 mins)

compared to CyMe4-BTBP 25 which displayed slow kinetics (> 60 mins) and, furthermore, no 
phase transfer agent DMDOHEMA was necessary.13,49   CyMe4-BTPhen 30 has been 
immobilised onto magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) where its extraction abilities were explored 
in different nitric acid concentrations.32 At 0.001M HNO3 both Am(III) and Eu(III) were 
observed to be extracted (DAm =  1162.8, DEu = 701.4, SFAm/Eu = 1.7) however at 4M HNO3 
separation was displayed (DAm =  55.4, DEu = 0.03, SFAm/Eu = 1675.6).32 This shows that it could 
be possible to first extract both actinides and lanthanides at low concentrations of nitric acid 
(DIAMEX) and then separate by increasing the concentration of nitric acid (SANEX).  
Figure 1.12 CyMe4-BTPhen functionalised MNPs 32 
If a DIAMEX/SANEX process were to be adopted, the SANEX raffinate storage time would be 
significantly lower at 300 years (Figure 1.5).12 However fission products such as 137Cs and 90Sr 
are still present in the SANEX raffinate. Both radionuclides are principal heat generators in 
HLW with long half lives (137Cs t1/2 = 30.2 years, 90Sr t1/2 = 28.8 years).50,51 137Cs and 90Sr undergo 
-decay producing energetic -particles (0.5 MeV), low energy recoil nuclei and -rays.51 The

-particles and -rays interact with solids producing defects.51 Removal of 137Cs and 90Sr before 
vitrification would both reduce the volume of HLW and reduce the risk of matrix deformation 
caused by -decay and heat generation.5056  
1.3 Environmental Impact 
137Caesium and 90strontium are also present in the environment. Disasters such as Chernobyl 
(1986) and Fukushima (2011) released a large volume of radionuclides into the environment 
that need to be removed to prevent long term radioactive hazard. The steam explosion that 
occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant resulted in the substantial release of 
radioactive materials into the atmosphere.57 The estimated activity of  the radionuclides 131I, 
134Cs and 137Cs released was 1760 PBq, 47 PBq and 85 PBq respectively (Table 1.1).57,58 
Radioactive contamination was found in every country in the northern hemisphere, with 
Europe most heavily affected.57 As most of the radionuclides were released as aerosols into 
the atmosphere, Chernobyl radioactivity was observed in rain and air samples as far as 
Japan.57 The highest 137Cs deposition densities, exceeding 555 KBq/m2, were found in Belarus 
(6400 Km2), the Russian Federation (2400 Km2) and the Ukraine (1500 Km2).5759 Over a period 
from June 1986 to January 1989, approximately 85.1 TBq of 137Cs and 51.8 TBq of 90Sr were 
deposited into the Kiev reservoir, as well as 2.2 TBq of 137Cs and 37 TBq of 90Sr into the Black 
Sea.60 From the overall radioactive contamination as a result of the Chernobyl incident, 237 
cases of acute radiation sickness were reported with 31 deaths.61  
Recently a large volume of radionuclides were released from the Fukushima nuclear power 
plant in 2011 after partial core melt-down of the nuclear fuel and hydrogen explosions caused 
by cooling systems failure. Approximately 21 PBq of 137Cs and 28 PBq of 134Cs were released 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
into the atmosphere, three times less than Chernobyl.57,62 Within the 20 km zone evacuated 
at the time of the accident, surface activities of 137Cs varied between less than 30 to 15000 
kBq/m2. Chernobyl saw contamination of 137Cs greater than 600,000 Bq/m2 over a surface area 
of 13,000 km2 while Fukushima saw only 600 km2. However, Fukushima is responsible for the 
largest one-off injection of artificial radionuclides into the marine environment estimated at 
27 x 1015 Bq.62  
Such releases of radionuclides from nuclear disasters must be addressed to decontaminate 
the surrounding environment. Humans and animals in contact with contaminated soil or water 
are more susceptible to radioactive health issues such thyroid cancer (131I) and bone cancer 
or leukaemia (90Sr).63 Selective extraction methods for caesium and strontium need to be 
developed in order to decontaminate the environment in the presence of other group I and 
group II metal ions and to provide safety measures in the event of another nuclear disaster.

1.4 Group I and II Chemistry  
1.4.1 Group I Chemistry 
Group I elements, known as alkali metals, contain a single s electron outside of a noble gas 
core. The single s electron in its outer shell allows for M+ cations and only M+ cations exist 
because of the high second ionisation potentials shown in Table 1.2.64 Group I elements mainly 
adopt ionic chemistry with a few covalent exceptions, for example: bonds to oxygen, carbon 
and nitrogen in chelates and organometallic compounds. Lithium shows the greatest tendency 
for covalent bonding, the least shown being from caesium because of the charge : radius 
ratio.64

on chemical and physical properties. For example, the hydrated radii and hydration energies 
decrease down the group. Reactivity of the group I metals increases with increasing 
electropositive nature (Li  Cs). M+ ions are easily hydrated or solvated, meaning that studies 
of extraction of group I ions must consider the hydrated radii rather than the naked radii. 
Due to the increase in charge : radius ratio down the group, the hydration radii decrease down 
the group. The larger the cation, the less it is able to bind additional outer layers of water 
molecules.64 For efficient extraction, high stability constants must be obtained with the active 
ligand. Complexes of the hydrated ions have reducing stability constants down the group (Li+ 
>> Cs+). Strength of absorption onto ion-exchange resins increases down the group (Li+ << Cs+) 
as the smallest hydrated radii will be held most strongly according to Coulombs Law.64 
1.4.2 Group II Chemistry 
The Group II elements possess smaller atomic radii than those of Group I because of the           
increased nuclear charge. Beryllium and magnesium both demonstrate more covalent 
chemistry while the heavier elements (Ca, Sr, Ba and Ra) are ionic in nature.7,64 Group II 
elements contain double the number of bonding electrons compared to group I, leading to 
their increased melting and boiling points and greater densities.7,64 Values of IE1 and IE2 
decrease down the group because of the increased size of the radius. This trend is broken in 
moving from Ba to Ra because of the thermodynamic 6s inert pair effect.7 High values of IE3 
impede the formation of M3+ cation species, with group II ions predominately adopting M2+ 
ions. The M2+ cations are smaller than the isoelectronic M+ group I species. Be2+ and Mg2+ and 
polarization of anions produces a degree of covalency for compounds of Be and Mg. The 
heavier group II elements follow similar trends to the group I elements with increasing size. 
For example, hydration tendencies of the crystalline salts increase, solubilities of sulfates, 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
nitrates and chlorides decrease, thermal stabilities of carbonates, nitrates and peroxides 
increase and rates of reaction with hydrogen increase.64   
aLadd radii  
Table 1.3  Properties of Group II elements.64  
Group II oxides react with water to form hydroxides; however, it is only the heavier element 
(Ca-Ra) hydroxides that are soluble in water. The heavier group II ions can accommodate six 
or more water molecules in the first coordination sphere of the hydrated species.7 Group II 
ions are hard acids and therefore coordinate with hard bases. O- or N-donor ligands are most 
suitable for coordination with cationic group II species, for example: [EDTA]4- and [P3O10]5- 
form water soluble complexes with group II ions and are sequestering agents used in water-
softening to remove Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions.7

1.5 Metal Complexes  
1.5.1 Crown ethers 
Crown ethers, synthesised by Pedersen in 1967 are popular metal cation chelators and viewed 
as a potential selective chelators due to the size fit principle within the interior cavity of the 
macrocycle.6567 The size fit principle relates to the different size cavities of crown ethers 
capable of binding to different sized metal cations. The main factors of crown ethers binding 
potential are preorganisation and complementarity, solvation and -significantly, - chelate ring 
size.6769 Flexibility of the crown ether can promote solubility in both aqueous and lipophilic 
solvents and rapid, reversible ion binding characteristics.67 The flexibility enables exposure of 
either the hydrophilic ether oxygen atoms or lipophilic ethylenic groups to the surrounding 
solvent. For example 18-crown-6, which can be hydrophilic or lipophilic.67 
Figure 1.13 18-crown-6 33  
Selectivity can be gained using the size fit criterion. The metal cations ionic radii must fit within 
the cavity of the crown ether. The crown ether 18-crown-6 33 favours potassium cations, 
creating a complex with a high stability constant (log K = 6.10) in methanol.67 Aqueous 
conditions cause solvation of the potassium cation, reducing the stability constant of the 
complex.67 18-Crown-6 33 is a two-dimensional ligand, meaning the interactions between 
ligand and metal cation occur about the equator and tropics.67 This leaves the North and 
South poles exposed, where water molecules can solvate the metal cation.67 With the North 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
and South poles exposed, crown ethers are inefficient at removing metal cations from 
aqueous solutions. Complexes of 18-crown-6 33 with the potassium cation often adopt a 
domed shape because of a conjugate anion pulling the potassium cation away from the most 
favourable intra-cavity site.67 An example of this is [K(18-crown-6)]NO3 34, where the nitrate 
anion binds to the cation as a bidentate ligand.  
Figure 1.14 [K(18-crown-6)]NO3 domed shape.  
Sodium also complexes with 18-crown-6 33 but there is a difference in behaviour because of 
the large non-complimentary macrocyclic ligand diameter.67,70 Dunitz et al. provided four 
possible responses for complexation between a metal cation and a large non-complimentary 
macrocyclic ligand.67,70 The four responses are: 
1. Non-optimal M-O bonds lengths are formed with the metal cation sitting in the centre 
of the macrocyclic ligand: e.g. for Na+ in 18-crown-6, the bond length is 2.8 .71 
2. Deviation of metal cation away from the centre. Shorter interactions with some donor 
atoms and longer with others: e.g. the NaBr.2H2O complex with dibenzo-18-crown-6 
adopts this behaviour.72 
3. The metal cation exhibits dynamic or static crystal disorder: e.g. [Na(H2O)2(18-crown-
6)]N3.73 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
4. Distortion of the crown ether occurs to form a more complimentary conformation for 
a metal cation: e.g. cis-anti-cis-dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 distorts to an elliptical shape 
to complex with NaBr.74 
These responses only apply when the crown ether is too large for the metal cation. Caesium 
has a larger ionic radius than sodium and potassium, requiring a larger crown ether than 18-
crown-6 33 to form a stable 1:1 complex. Caesium cations and 18-crown-6 33 form ML2 
complexes with the cation sandwiched in between two 18-crown-6 33 ligands. A domed ML 
complex for Cs+ with 18-crown-6 33 has been observed with [N(PPh3)2]- as the counter anion.67 
Caesium cations have a tendency to adopt cation- interactions which helps to stabilise the 
ML complex with 18-crown-6 33.67 Some degree of selectivity can be achieved utilising the 
size of the crown ether cavity. However, with the crown ethers flexibility, a crown ether with 
a cavity size perfect for caesium cations would still be able to wrap around potassium and 
sodium cations. As sodium and potassium are in excess in nuclear waste and the environment, 
crown ethers do not offer suitable selectivity towards caesium over potassium and sodium. 
The exposed North and South poles also allow solvation of the metal cation by water 
molecules, reducing the stability constant of the cation/crown ether complex. Therefore, 
crown ethers are not suitable for caesium extraction from an aqueous medium.  
1.5.2 Calixarenes  
Calixarenes were first discovered by Alois Zinke in 1942 while investigating the curing phase 
of the phenol-formaldehyde process in the formation of Bakelite.75,76 Zinke synthesised a 
crystalline product with a high melting point, proposing the product to be a cyclic tetramer.75
77 Cornforth repeated Zinkes synthesis isolating two products, both of which possessed 
characteristics of a cyclic oligomer.75,76,78 However, it was not until the 1970s when Gutsche 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
was able to utilise new spectroscopic methods, chromatography and X-ray capabilities to 
uncover the structures of cyclic oligomers.75,76 Gutsche developed procedures to acquire cyclic 
tetramers, cyclic hexamers and cyclic octamers in good yields using a base-induced reaction 
of p-tert-butylphenol and formaldehyde.75,79  
Figure 1.15 Structure of Calix[4]arene 35, Calix[6]arene 36 and Calix[8]arene 37  
Gutsche gave the cyclic oligomers the name calixarenes because of their structural similarities 
to a Greek vase, calix.75,76  The numerical prefix to the arene indicates the presence of aryl 
substituents in the macrocyclic compound. The structure of calixarenes is often depicted as 
having an annulus, an upper rim and a lower rim shown in Figure 1.15. The annulus 
corresponds to the aryl groups whilst the upper and lower rims are the hydroxide groups and 
the para-substituents of the calixarene respectively. The synthesis of pure calixarenes 
predominately follows a one step, base induced procedure. A mixture of p-tert-butylphenol, 
formalin (37% aq. formaldehyde) and sodium hydroxide is heated at 110-120 C for 2 hours, 
leading to formation of a precipitate.76,78 The precipitate is then heated to reflux in diphenyl 
ether for 2 hours, cooled and separated by filtration. The solid so formed is p-tert-
butylcalix[4]arene. However, the hexamer can be formed by changing the concentration of 
the base. Approximately 0.03-0.04 equivalents of base favours the formation of tetramers; 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
whereas 0.3-0.5 equivalents favours hexamers.76 Octamers can also be formed using the one 
step, based-induced procedure. A mixture of p-tert-butylphenol, paraformaldehyde and 0.03 
equivalents of sodium hydroxide, on heating to  reflux in xylene for 4 hours results in the 
octamer p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene.76  
Figure 1.16 Simplified structure of calix[4]arene 
Calixarenes can adopt several different conformations that either enhance or inhibit their 
extraction abilities. Calix[4]arenes 35 have four different conformations, observed in solid 
state and in solution. The four conformations are called 1,3-alternate 39, 1,2-alternate 40, 
partial cone 41 and cone 42.     
Figure 1.17 Conformations of calix[4]arene 35 
Annulus 
Upper Rim 
Lower Rim 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
The favoured conformation is the cone structure, due to the hydrogen bonding possible 
between each phenolic hydroxide group. However, the flexible nature of the calixarenes 
allows for inversion of the cone structure with two possible pathways of inversion. One 
pathway called the broken chain pathway utilises the 1,3-alternate conformation during 
inversion.76 Hydrogen bonding in the cone formation is disrupted during conversion to the 
1,3-alternate conformer, with some hydrogen bonding being restored.  
Figure 1.18 Broken chain pathway conversion.  
The other pathway is called continuous chain pathway where the aryl groups rotate 180 
around the annulus in tandem, resulting in a conformer resembling a skewed 1,2-alternate 
conformation.80  
Figure 1.19 Continuous chain pathway conversion.  
Calix[6]arene 36 can adopt eight up-down conformations but the increased flexibility of the 
hexamer allows for additional conformations where one or more aryl groups assume an out 
alignment.76 An out alignment is the positioning approximately in the average plane of the 
molecule.76 There are sixteen up-down conformations for calix[8]arene 37 with additional 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
forms adopting out alignments.76 Calix[8]arene 37 usually exists in a pleated loop structure 
where the eight OH groups lie in a circular array ideal for hydrogen bonding. 
Figure 1.20 Pleated loop structure of p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene.81 
Calix[4]arenes 35 have the ability to extract Group I cations from strongly basic aqueous 
solutions in a liquid-liquid extraction process, favouring caesium cations.82,83 Caesium cations 
have been observed to adopt stable complexes utilising cation- interactions with crown 
ethers and aromatic counter-anions.67 Cation- interactions with the aryl groups of calixarene 
stabilise the ML complex with caesium cations. The diameters of the calixarenes are  1  for 
cyclic tetramers,  2.4  for cyclic hexamers and  4.8  for cyclic octamers.76 Calix[4]arene is 
too small to fit the lithium cation and calix[8]arene is too large for the caesium cation. 
Therefore the calix[4]arene complex with caesium cations must adopt a domed structure, 
where the cation complexes with the hydroxyl groups in the lower rim and is stabilised by 
cation- interactions. However the ability of calix[4]arene 35 to extract is greatly affected by 
the solvation of the cations by water molecules. The calix[4]arene-cation complex can still be 
stripped by water molecules from the exposed upper and lower rim. Conversely, group II 
cations are not effectively extracted by calixarenes. Calix[4]arenes have become increasing 
popular ligands for the extraction of caesium and modifications to the calix[4]arene core 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
structure have been made to increase the binding with caesium cations. Conformation 
freezing has been utilised where substituents have been added to lock the calixarene into 
the 1,3-alternate conformation.  
Figure 1.21 Examples of calix[4]bis-crown-6 ligands8491 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Etherification of the calix[4]arene 35 can form a calix[4]bis-crown using a polyethylene glycol 
unit. A polyethylene glycol with 5 repeat units will form a calix[4]bis-crown-6 that has shown 
promise in extracting caesium. This combination of crown ether and calixarene enables strong 
complexes with caesium cations because of dative covalent bonds from the ether oxygen 
atoms and  interactions from the aryl groups of the calixarene. Calix[4]bis-crown-6 ligands 
have been explored in their ability to extract caesium via liquid-liquid extraction methods, 
yielding a highly selective ligand for caesium over sodium.8491 Examples of calix[4]bis-crown-
6 ligands are shown in Figure 1.17.  
Haverlock et al. compared crown ethers to calix[4]bis-crown-6 derivatives with the most 
selective crown ethers providing a Cs/Na separation factor of 102; whereas calix[4]bis-crown-
6 produced Cs/Na separation factors exceeding 104.89 Crown ethers are more flexible than 
calix[4]bis-crown-6 that have been locked into the 1,3-alternate conformation. This means 
that calix[4]bis-crown-6 compounds display a higher selectivity towards caesium over sodium 
because the compound is unable to distort around sodium cations.   
Calix[6]arene 36 and calix[8]arene 37 have been studied for their ability to extract strontium 
cations. Calix[6]arene derivatives with tertiary amide groups have shown promising results in 
selectively extracting strontium over sodium, resulting in 83% extraction of strontium using p-
tert-butylcalix[6]amide 57 ligand in a liquid-liquid method compared to 27% extraction for 
sodium.92  
  Chapter 1 - Introduction

The p-tert-butylcalix[6]amide 57 ligand demonstrates higher Sr/Na separation factors 
compared to dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 58, one of the more selective extractants for strontium 
cations.92 Development has been made to improve the Sr/Na separation factor further by 
modifying calix[8]arenes with tertiary amide groups. Casnati et al. compared various 
calix[6]arene and calix[8]arene derivatives in their ability to act as a strontium extractants 
achieving the highest Sr/Na separation factors of 51.3 from p-benzylcalix[8]amide.93 This is 
significantly higher than dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 58 (SPSr/Na = 12).

1.6 Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) 
1.6.1 Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs)  
Different methods for waste water management include chemical precipitation, liquid-liquid 
extraction, use of ion exchange, cementation and electro-dialysis.9498 The problem with these 
treatment methods is the high cost and complexity of the processes as well as the large 
amounts of secondary waste produced.98 Liquid-liquid extraction is predominantly used in the 
nuclear industry for reprocessing (PUREX process) but large volumes of solvent are needed 
with degradation of the solvent and extractant over time leading to loss of performance and 
efficiency.99 Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is being increasingly used in such separations. The 
advantages of SPE over liquid-liquid extraction processes are high enrichment factors, absence 
of emulsification, safety with respect to hazardous samples, minimal costs (due to low 
consumption of reagents), flexibility and ease of automation.100104 
The introduction of magnetic separation technology (MACS process  Magnetically Assisted 
Chemical Separation) was reported at the Argonne National Laboratory in 1995.105 A 
procedure utilising an extractant ligand immobilised onto magnetic particles was designed to 
reduce the complexity of waste treatment as the ligand immobilised magnetic particle is easily 
extracted using a weak external magnetic field.106 Synthesis of mono-dispersed magnetic 
nanoparticles (MNPs) with particles sizes of less than 40 nm means that these can offer a large 
surface area for functionalisation. Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 and -Fe2O3) have 
ferromagnetic and/or paramagnetic properties allowing for separation using a magnetic 
field.32,95,107109 Fe3O4 and -Fe2O3 nanoparticles can be generated using a co-precipitation 
method by mixing ferric and ferrous ions in a 1:2 molar ratio in highly basic solutions.107109 
However, iron oxide nanoparticles have the potential to aggregate in liquid and so coating of 
the nanoparticles is needed. Silica coating allows for chemical stability and helps prevent 
  Chapter 1 - Introduction 
aggregation. Furthermore, the silanol groups from the silica layer can be easily covalently 
functionalised, providing a means of modifying the iron oxide MNPs.107 The silica coating is 
produced using the Stber process, where the silica coating is formed in situ through the 
hydrolysis and condensation of a sol-gel precursor.107 In this protocol, iron oxide MNPs are 
homogenously dispersed in alcohol followed by addition of an appropriate silane and aqueous 
ammonia solution to produce the silica coating. Sonication allows even coating of the silane 
onto the homogenously dispersed iron oxide MNPs.

Figure 1.24 Synthesis of Iodoalkyl-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 67 
Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) is the most common silane used in silica coating, where the OH 
groups bind onto the iron oxide MNPs.107,110112 Surface modification with organosilanes 
allows for additional functionalisation with extractant ligands due to organosilanes 
bifunctional nature. The general formula for organosilanes is X-(CH2)n-Si(OR)3, where X 
represents the headgroup functionality, (CH2)n is the flexible spacer and Si(OR)3 is the anchor 
group that couples with free Si-OH groups on the surface of silica-coated MNPs. Modification 
of the silica-coated surface with 3-iodopropyltrimethoxysilane (3-IPTMS) allows for 
functionalisation via displacement of the iodine group. The Harwood group has functionalised 
iodoalkyl-functionalized SiO2-coated MNPs with different ligands: neocuproine for Cu(II) 
extraction, BTBP for An(III)/Ln(III) separation and BTPhen for An(III)/Ln(III) separation.32,108

Figure 1.25 Neocuproine functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs 68  
Neocuproine functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs resulted in a system capable of highly efficient 
extraction (99%) of Cu(II) at pH 2, while the precursor iodoalkyl-functionalised SiO2 coated

CyMe4-BTPhen-functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs have also been investigated for their ability 
to separate Am(III) from Eu(III) from HNO3 solutions.32 Extraction studies were carried out at 
nitric acid concentrations of 0.001, 0.1, 1 and 4M. At 0.001M HNO3 high distribution ratios (D 
> 700) were achieved for both Am(III) and Eu(III) showing no separation (SFAm/Eu = 1.7  0.1) 
for Am(III) over Eu(III). However, at 4M HNO3 a decrease in D value for both Am(III) (DAm = 55.4

 1.5) and Eu(III) (DEu = 0.03  0.4) resulted in only Am(III) being retained on the functionalised 
MNPs. The separation factor at 4M HNO3 (SFAm/Eu = estimated to be >1300) is much higher 
than that observed by CyMe4-BTPhen (SFAm/Eu = 400) in liquid-liquid extraction.13,32,113

MNPs as a function of nitric acid concentration.32 
This demonstrated that, while iodoalkyl-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs are not effective 
extractants, they can be utilised as solid-state supports when functionalised with selective 
extractant ligands. It was therefore proposed that functionalisation of SiO2-coated MNPs with 
demonstrated liquid-liquid caesium-selective ligands and strontium-selective ligands could 
provide a cheaper, more efficient alternative to liquid-liquid extraction. 
1.6.2 Functionalised Silica Gel  
Using selective chemisorption materials is another type of SPE that is becoming more popular 
in extraction processes. For an absorbing material to be efficient it should consist of a stable 
and insoluble porous matrix with suitable active groups that interact with a contaminant.114 
Silica gel has desirable characteristics for extraction and separation: for example silica gel is

stable under acidic conditions, is a non-swelling inorganic material and has high mass 
exchange characteristics and very high thermal resistance.104,114116 Functionalised silica gel 
can be utilised in a column separation protocol, extracting target species from eluents. The 
contaminant metal chelates to the selective ligand on the silica gel, while the eluent passes 
through the inert silica gel. This reduces the volume of secondary waste and allows for 
regeneration of the silica gel. Stripping of functionalised silica gel can provide a highly 
concentrated waste form that is easy to manage and permits recycling and reuse of the 
functionalised silica gel.  
The silica gel can be first functionalised with an appropriate organosilane, like the organic 
coating of MNPs described in section 1.5.1. The Si(OR)3 anchor group binds to the free Si-OH 
groups on the surface of the silica gel providing a good leaving headgroup (X) for further 
functionalisation. The Harwood group has immobilised BTBP and BTPhen onto silica gel to 
investigate extraction capabilities of such systems of minor actinides.115 BTBP immobilised 
onto silica gel has also been investigated in its ability to extract transition metals. The uptake 
of various metals (Sc(III), Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mo(IV), Ag(I), Cd(II), Sb(V), 
Pb(II), Pd(II), Os(IV), Ir(III), Pt(IV), Au(III), Zr(IV), Nb(V), Hf(IV), Ta(V), W(VI) and Re(IV)) at pH 0.5 
has shown > 80% extraction making BTBP-functionalised silica gel 69 a possible extractant for 
transition metals contaminants in nuclear waste or the environment.117

CyMe4-BTPhen functionalised silica gel produced a high SFAm/Eu >154 at 4M HNO3 and, at low 
HNO3 concentration, extracted both Am(III) and Eu(III) similar to CyMe4-BTPhen functionalised 
SiO2-coated MNPs.32,115,118

Just like SiO2-coated MNPs, silica gel could well be functionalised with caesium and strontium 
selective ligands to provide a SPE protocol more manageable and cheaper than the widely 
used liquid-liquid extraction method.

2.1 Synthesis of Calix[4]arene bis-[(4-carboxyl-1,2-phenylene)crown-6)] 
Spent nuclear fuel is currently being encapsulated in borosilicate glass in a process called 
vitrification.14 The encapsulated radioactive material can cause defects in the borosilicate 
glass by -particles and -rays interacting with the solid.51 Removal of the fission products 
before vitrification reduces the risk of matrix deformation caused by -decay and heat 
generation and reduces the volume of HLW.5052,54,55 137Cs is a significant heat generator in 
spent nuclear fuel and has a half life of 30.2 years, releasing -particles.50,51 Therefore, the 
removal of 137Cs is highly desirable to deliver a safer more manageable waste form.  
In this study, the synthesis of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs and calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised SiO2 gel and their ability to extract Cs(I) in the presence of other alkali metals 
was investigated, the calix[4]bis-crown structures being derived from systems shown to 
extract caesium selectively from aqueous solutions.

Scheme 2.1 Synthesis of Ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 7285 
The first step of the synthetic route requires a nucleophilic reaction between ethyl 3,4-
dihydroxybenzoate 70 and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 7185 to provide the precursor to the 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
crown ether unit. The ethylene glycol chains on the product, when linked to calix[4]arene via 
macrocyclisation, will adopt a crown-6 structure with a cavity size that is suitable for 
complexation with caesium.84,85,8791 The phenolic group para- to the ester due to the 
stabilisation effect of the carbonyl group as shown in Figure 2.2. Acetonitrile was used as a 
polar aprotic solvent.  
Figure 2.1 Polar aprotic solvents 73-76 
This allows the nucleophile to be un-solvated and free for nucleophilic substitution. Another 
benefit of using polar aprotic solvents is their ability to solvate cations. The base used to 
deprotonate the phenolic groups was potassium carbonate.  Using acetonitrile also meant 
that the reaction was could be heated to reflux to speed up the reaction, while maintaining 
ease of workup due to acetonitriles moderate boiling point (unlike DMF or DMSO).  
Figure 2.2 Acidifying effect of the ester group on the para- phenolic group.  
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 may undergo an SN1 pathway, losing the chlorine leaving group 
by neighbouring group participation of the central oxygen. The nucleophile then attacks the 
cationic epoxide species to form the ether bond. Labelling the adjacent carbon to the chlorine 
leaving group as 13C could prove whether a SN1 or SN2 pathway is preferred. A SN1 pathway 
would produce two products with different 13C locations. 
Figure 2.3 SN1 mechanism with 13C-labelling  
In our hands a yield of 40% was achieved compared to the literature where a 30% yield was 
reported.85 Changing the base to caesium carbonate improved the yield to 60%. However, 
introducing caesium to the synthetic route led to increases in Cs+ concentrations in the 
aqueous phase when the final immobilized material was tested, presumably as a result of 
caesium uptake by the intermediate and the caesium being retained throughout the synthetic 
route. Changing the leaving group in the 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 could improve the 
yield. 2-(2-iodoethoxy)ethanol 77 is not available from chemical suppliers but can be made in 
situ by a Finkelstein reaction.119  
Figure 2.4 Finkelstein reaction 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
The Finkelstein reaction is an equilibrium but, in acetonitrile, the equilibrium is pushed 
towards the alkyl iodide product because of the insolubility of KCl, which precipitates out of 
solution, driving the reaction to completion.120  When the Finkelstein reaction was carried out 
using 4.2 equivalents of KI, a yield of 93% was obtained after a period of reflux lasting 7 days 
(Scheme 2.2).

  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
The 1H NMR spectrum of the product (Figure 2.5) shows the presence of the diethylene glycol 
units. The multiplets between  4.25 and 3.60 correspond to the two diethylene glycol units, 
with a broad resonance at  3.99 corresponding to the hydroxyl protons. The complex nature 
of the diethylene glycol resonances is because the molecule is asymmetric. However, the 
diethylene glycol units could be distinguished using 2-D NMR techniques such as COSY, HMBC 
and HMQC.  
2.1.2 Synthesis of Ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-(tosyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 78 
Scheme 2.3 Synthesis of Ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-(tosyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 78 
The second step of the synthesis is to activate the hydroxyl groups and provide better leaving 
groups during nucleophilic substitution.121 Tosylation with toluenesulfonyl chloride in the 
presence of an amine gives a tosyl ester that can then be reacted further with the appropriate 
nucleophile122. Ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 72 was reacted with 
toluenesulfonyl chloride to provide the ditosylate product, ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-
(tosyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 78, which can then undergo nucleophilic substitution with 
calix[4]arene 35. The base used was triethylamine as previously reported by Lemaire et al. and 
the procedure resulted in a yield of 93% compared to a yield of 86% as reported in the 
literature.85 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
However, the rate of tosylation was slow resulting in a 6 day reaction. Therefore, the 
conditions were modified in an attempt to improve the kinetics. The base was changed to 
pyridine, which may act as a nucleophile, reacting with the toluenesulfonyl chloride, displacing 
the chlorine to provide a better leaving group. Excess pyridine will also remove HCl from the 
reaction.   
Unfortunately, incomplete consumption of tosyl chloride was observed after 6 days using 
pyridine as the base. As triethylamine has a higher pKa than pyridine it may complex with the 
hydrogen of the primary alcohol of the diol. This would stretch the OH bond creating a greater 
dipole between the bond thus increasing the nucleophilicity of the oxygen. To ensure fast 
conversion, triethylamine could be used as the base with a catalytic amount of pyridine. This 
could allow the pyridine to displace the chlorine while the triethylamine facilitates the 
deprotonation. In fact, the pyridine was replaced with the acylation catalyst, 4-
(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), which has been used in previous tosylations.123,124 DMAP is 
a more nucleophilic analogue of pyridine, activating the tosyl group, while triethylamine 
consumes the HCl by-product.     
Figure 2.6 Tosylation mechanism with DMAP 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
Using a catalytic amount of DMAP with triethylamine decreased the reaction time from 6 to 4 
days, while maintaining a high yield of 93% compared to the literature yield of 86%.85 The 
DMAP catalyst could be simply removed by washing with saturated aqueous CuSO4.  
Recent studies into ultrasound-promoted tosylation of oligo(ethylene glycols) have seen yields 
being greatly improved and reaction times decreased. Triethylene glycol was shown to be 
tosylated successfully by Danjou et al. using triethylamine and toluenesulfonyl chloride in 
DCM with a yield of 95% after 30 minutes of sonication125. A similar approach was adopted for 
the tosylation of diol 72, which contains two diethylene glycol units. Diol 72 and triethylamine 
were dissolved in DCM under nitrogen followed by the addition of 2 equivalence of 
toluenesulfonyl chloride. The mixture was subjected to sonication and completion of the 
reaction was achieved after 5 hours with a yield of 92%.125

The 1H NMR spectrum of product 78 shows the presence of the toluenesulfonyl groups, With 
resonances centred on  7.78 and 7.29 corresponding to the aromatic protons and the methyl

Scheme 2.4 Synthesis of calix[4]arene-bis-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-phenylene)crown-6] 79 
The successful formation of the bis-calix[4]arene crown ether is dependent on  the 
calix[4]arene adopting the 1,3-alternate conformation. Calix[4]arenes can adopt four different 
conformations shown in Figure 2.8. 
Figure 2.8 Conformations of calix[4]arene 35 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
To form the calix[4]bis-crown 79 the ditosylate 78 must undergo macrocyclisation with 
calix[4]arene 35.85 The ditosylate 78 was added with calix[4]arene 35 as a 1:1 ratio to prevent 
oligomerisation of the ditosylate. After 7 days calix[4]mono crown was shown to be present, 
at which point additional potassium carbonate base and a further equivalent of ditosylate was 
added to complete formation of calix[4]bis-crown 79. Acetonitrile was used as the solvent due 
to its polar aprotic nature, allowing solvation of the potassium cation from the carbonate base. 
It might be that the potassium cation also helps in templating the ditosylate to produce the 
calix[4]crown ether (Figure 2.9).   
Figure 2.9 Possible templating effect of potassium cations 
The base could be changed to Cs2CO3 allowing for better release of the carbonate anion. 
Caesium salts are far more dissociated than lithium, sodium and potassium salts because of 
their large ionic radius. Cs2CO3 is more soluble than other group I carbonates in aprotic organic 
solvents because the dissociated Cs+ cation more easily solvated by the aprotic organic 
solvent.  However, the Cs+ cation would form a strong complex with the diethylene glycol units 
reducing the extraction capabilities of the final ligand.  
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
The 1H NMR spectrum of calix[4]bis-crown 79 possesses a triplet at  6.67 and a doublet at  
7.07 corresponding to the aromatic protons of the calix[4]arene moiety. The ratio between 
the resonances corresponding to the ethyl ester and the calix[4]arene aromatic protons is 2:1 
which supports the formation of  the calix[4]bis-crown product and not calix[4]mono-crown.  
Figure 2.10 1H NMR spectrum of calix[4]arene-bis-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-
phenylene)crown-6] 79 
Calix[4]bis-crown is chiral by dissymmetric planes because of the position of the ester groups 
located on the crown ether units. In principle, this could be confirmed by the diastereotopic 
nature of any of the methylene resonances in the 1H NMR; however, the Ar-CH2-Ar linkages 
on the calixarene appear to have potentially the best defined magnetic environments. Upon 
closer inspection, the resonance for these methylene linkages is overlapped with other 
resonances from the molecule. A broad resonance at  3.75 could be consistent with either 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
with a singlet or a highly AB spin system. As the degree of diastereotopicity is variable between 
molecules and the solvent in which they are dissolved, whilst the appearance of diastereotopic 
resonances confirms the molecules chirality, the absence of such changes does not discount 
the chirality. 
Figure 2.11 Possible singlet within ethylene multiplet.  
Further investigation using a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer would be needed to distinguish 
whether the resonance at  3.75 is either a singlet or a diasterotopic environment.

Scheme 2.5 Synthesis of calix[4]arene-bis-[(4-hydroxymethyl-1,2-phenyl-ene)crown-6] 80  
In order to immobilise the ligand onto a solid support an appropriate functional group must 
produced on the calix[4]bis-crown. A primary alcohol was initially chosen as a means of 
immobilisation via an ether linkage. The use of lithium aluminium hydride as a reducing agent 
is a common method in the reduction of esters to primary alcohols126 and the reaction in 
Scheme 2.4 was reported by Lemaire et al. to occur with a yield of 80%.85 However, when the 
reaction was attempted no conversion was observed. The procedure was repeated at varying 
reaction times all producing no reaction. Furthermore, the workup led to emulsions, making 
separation of the organic and aqueous phases difficult.  Therefore, after quenching the 
reaction with water, the aluminium hydroxide emulsion was removed using an aqueous 
solution of Rochelle salt to form more soluble aluminium tartrate salts. However, while 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
improving the ease of workup, the reaction still yielded no product therefore the workup was 
not the issue with this reaction. 
The substrate contains crown ethers and these might complex with the lithium cation of the 
lithium aluminium hydride. Smith et al. studied the kinetics and mechanisms of lithium 
aluminium hydride reactions and observed that, in the presence of a crown ether, the rate of 
reduction was significantly reduced.127 The aluminium hydride anion without the lithium 
cation is a poor reducing agent causing no reduction of esters. Smith et al. found that, in THF, 
the lithium aluminium hydride in the presence of a crown ether was still able to act as a 
reducing agent but showed slower kinetics, suggesting that lithium aluminium hydride can 
reform from the lithium-crown ether complex, possibly by competition from the excess THF. 
However, when DME was replaced with THF for the reduction of calix[4]bis-crown 61 to a 
primary alcohol no reaction was observed. This may be because the complex between the 
calix[4]bis-crown and the lithium cation is too strong for the LiAlH4 to reform. The crown ether 
moiety of the calix[4]bis-crown, while selective to Cs+, is still a good complexing agent for 
other group I cations. Therefore Li+ cation from LiAlH4 coordinates to the calix[4]bis-crown 
stabilised by  electrons of calix[4]arene, a more stable complex than Li+ and THF. This greatly 
reduces the efficiency of the reducing agent as Li+ cation is less able to bind to the carbonyl of 
the ester during ester reduction.

Due to the unexpected failure of the attempted reduction of the ester, a hydrolysis reaction 
was chosen to form the carboxylic acid. Ester 79 was refluxed for 24 hours with potassium 
hydroxide to hydrolyse the ester. The carboxylate salt initially formed by alkaline hydrolysis of 
79 was soluble in water but, once the reaction mixture was acidified, the carboxylic acid 
precipitated out of solution. To remove any water remaining in the solid after filtration, the 
carboxylic acid was dissolved in chloroform and the solution dried with magnesium sulfate. 
The solvent was then removed via rotary evaporation to afford pure carboxylic acid 47. From 
the 1H NMR spectrum, the ethyl ester resonances at  1.40 and 4.37 in 79 had disappeared, 
being replaced by a broad a resonance at  12.73 corresponding to the carboxylic acid proton.

During the formation of the MNPs, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used 
to characterise the products of each step. Figure 2.14 displays the FT-IR spectra of uncoated 
(-Fe2O3) MNPs 65, silica-coated MNPs 66 and iodo-functionalised MNPs 67. The -Fe2O3 
MNPs 65 showed a strong absorption around 600 cm-1 caused by the Fe-O stretch. Coating 
the -Fe2O3 MNPs with silica resulted in appearance of absorptions at 3360 and 1070 cm-1 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
caused by the O-H and Si-O stretching respectively. The silica coated MNPs 66 were then 
functionalised with 3-IPTMS, causing bands at 2960 and 689 cm-1 to appear corresponding to 
the C-H and C-I stretching of the iodopropyl functionalities on the SiO2 coated MNPs. A small 
suppression of the O-H broad stretch at 3360 cm-1 was also observed, owing to the reduced 
number of Si-OH groups on the surface of the MNPs.

The iodoalkyl-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 67 were then functionalised with calix[4]bis-
crown 47 in DMF, using sodium hydride to deprotonate the carboxylic acid of calix[4]bis-crown 
47 initiating nucleophilic substitution to form an ester linkage. This resulted in suppression of 
the C-I stretching absorption at 689 cm-1 and the appearance of an absorption at 1716 cm-1 
assigned to the carbonyl stretching frequency of the ester linkages.

and calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs 81. Little difference is seen in their appearance 
from SEM; however using elemental analysis during SEM imaging gave evidence for the degree 
of immobilisation of the calix[4]bis-crown. Table 2.1 shows the percentage of C, O and I in the

the increase of carbon and oxygen (i.e. 39.29% carbon for iodoalkyl-functionalised MNPs and

MNPs [Figure 2.16 (b)] appear to show a greater thickness of organic coating around the 
darker -Fe2O3 cores.   
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) can display the degree of organic coating around the Fe2O3 
core by measuring the change in mass as a function of temperature. The changes of physical 
and chemical properties can be deduced from the change in mass at certain temperatures.

The MNPs were investigated using TGA under nitrogen. The TGA curve of iodoalkyl-
functionalised MNPs, shown in Figure 2.17, displayed a sharp loss of mass at 260-300 C, 
presumed to correspond to the loss of the aliphatic iodoalkyl coating. The TGA curve of 
calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs showed a three-step mass-loss (Figure 2.18). The loss 
in mass below 200 C is attributed to the loss of absorbed water, while the significant loss in 
mass seen at 300-450 C is proposed to correspond to decomposition of the largely aromatic

2.2.3 Extraction studies  
The calix[4]bis-crown functionalised  MNPs were first compared to the precursor, iodo-
functionalised MNPs to prove that the ligand was responsible for extracting the Cs+ rather 
than the nanoparticles themselves. Equal amounts (5 mg) of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised  
MNPs and iodo-functionalised MNPs were tested on 10 mL samples of Cs+ with a 
concentration of 10 ppb, with the analysis being carried out in triplicate. Before testing, 
samples were analysed using ICP-MS to measure the true starting concentration of Cs+ in the 
samples. Once the samples were mixed with MNPs an external magnet was used to remove 
the MNPs, decanting off the supernatant. 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
Figure 2.19 Extraction capabilities of iodoalkyl-functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs 67 and 
calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs 81.   
The supernatant was analysed by ICP-MS to measure the final concentration of Cs+. A 
percentage extraction was then calculated from the starting and final concentration. Figure 
2.19 shows that the iodo-functionalised only extracts 10% caesium; whereas the calix[4]bis-
crown functionalised MNPs achieved extraction of >37%. This demonstrates that the ligand is 
responsible for a significant amount of Cs+ extraction. To attempt to increase the percentage 
extraction of caesium, a higher dose of the functionalised nanoparticles was examined. 
However, the results from ICP-MS puzzlingly showed an increase in concentration of Cs+ after 
testing shown in Figure 2.20. This was firstly thought to have been due to a calibration error 
but, on repeating the experiments, the same results were obtained. The results showed a 
linear correlation between the increased dose of MNPs and an increased concentration of 
caesium after testing.

exposure to caesium carbonate   
It was proposed that the ligand was actually releasing caesium into the test samples rather 
than extracting due to retaining Cs+ caused by early precursors in the synthetic route being 
exposed to caesium carbonate in the first step in the synthetic route involving ethyl 3,4-
dihydroxybenzoate 70 and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71.  
Scheme 2.9 Modified synthesis of Ethyl 3,4-bis(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy)benzoate 
Caesium carbonate is highly dissociated which allows for solvation of Cs+ by acetonitrile. 
However, because of the ethylene glycol units of diol 72, Cs+ also coordinates with early 
precursors. Exposure to nitrate anions in 2% HNO3 solution used during extraction studies

leads to stripping of Cs+ causing the linear correlation between the increased dose of MNPs 
and an increased concentration of caesium after testing. Nitrate anions coordinate to Cs+, 
disrupting the dative bonds between the calix[4]bis-crown and Cs+. When reverting to 
potassium carbonate as the base in the first step of the synthesis to avoid exposure to 
caesium, an increase of caesium was still observed on carrying out the extraction analyses but 
at lower concentrations shown in Figure 2.21.  
The reason for the increase of caesium at lower concentrations is a trace amount of Cs+ is 
present in potassium carbonate. The trace caesium was again retained by early precursors in 
the synthetic route and stripped once exposed to nitrate anions from 2% HNO3 solution from 
extraction studies. This shows calix[4]bis-crown 47 and early precursors strong affinity to Cs+, 
and selectivity towards Cs+ in the presence of a large excess of K+. The stripping effect of 
nitrate anions could be a means of removing caesium from the calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs after extraction.

The capacity of the calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs to extract Cs+ was then 
investigated at pH 7, the sample size was increased to 100 mL as was the concentration from 
10 ppb to 100ppb to provide a greater range in dosage. Varying dose sizes (2 -100 mg) were 
tested, with 10 mL samples removed from each test run for ICP-MS analysis. Figure 2.22 shows 
the percentage extraction of Cs with increasing dosage of Cs ligand MNPs. From Figure 2.22 it 
is clear to see an increase in percentage extraction that correlates to an increase in the dose 
of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs. Between 10  50 mg there is a large increase in 
percentage extraction from 48% to 92%. Using the dose concentration of 0.5 mg mL-1, an 
extrapolation leads to the conclusion that 250 g of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs 
would be needed for 500 L of Cs contaminated water, for example. Compared to a liquid-liquid 
extraction method that would require several litres of solvent to achieve high extraction, this 
shows the vast reduction in secondary waste when using solid-state supports.

The kinetics of extraction were then tested to ensure extraction times appropriate for 
industrial application could be achieved. A 200 mL sample of caesium solution (100 ppb) was 
stirred with calix[4]bis-crown (100 mg). The dose of 0.5 mg/mL was chosen as high extraction 
had been achieved with the capacity assay. The extraction was left for a total of 24 hours, with 
small aliquots (10 mL) removed at various intervals to assess the level of extraction achieved 
at each stage. High extraction (>95%) was achieved after 2 hours of mixing (Figure 2.23). 
Presumably this could be improved with either increased loading of calix[4]bis-crown onto the 
magnetic nanoparticles or by increasing the dose used of the currently-prepared calix[4]bis-
crown functionalised MNPs.

Figure 2.24 Percentage extraction of Cs+ in the presence of competing ions. 
The selectivity for caesium against other group I cations, as would be encountered in 
environmental conditions  such as extraction from seawater - was also tested through a 
competing ion test. Extraction of caesium from nuclear waste or from contaminated 
environmental samples needs to be selective due to the potentially high concentrations of 
alkali metals (Li+, Na+, K+), group II metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and the transition metals such as Fe3+ 
and Cu2+. If the calix[4]bis-crown MNPs are not selective then their extraction capabilities will 
decrease in the presence of competing ions. The competing ions used in this assay were Al3+ , 
Sb3+, Ba2+, Pb2+, B3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Fe3+, K+, Cu2+, Li+ , Mg2+, Mo4+ , Na+ , Ni2+, P3+, Si, Ti4+, 
V3+ and Zn2+. Three model extraction samples were prepared with varying concentrations of 
the competing ions (10 ppb, 250 ppb and 1000 ppb). The concentration of caesium was kept 
constant at 100 ppb across all three samples. The amount of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised 
MNPs used was determined by the capacity test and so a ratio of 0.5 mg mL-1 was used as the 
dose concentration of extractant. Figure 2.24 presents the percentage extraction of caesium 
from the multi-element samples. Concentrations of multi-element mix below that of Cs+ show

high extraction of Cs (>98%). A percentage extraction of >99% was achieved with competing 
ions at the same concentration as caesium. The sample containing higher concentrations of 
competing ions (1000ppb) still showed high selectivity towards Cs+ with a level of extraction 
of 85%. To improve the level of extraction of Cs+, the extraction process could be left longer 
to ensure achievement of equilibrium or a second dose of fresh calix[4]bis-crown MNPs could 
be utilised to remove the remaining 15% of caesium. The latter possibility was tested with the 
same dose concentration (1 mg/mL) of calix[4]bis-crown MNPs when complete extraction of 
the remaining caesium was achieved.  
2.3 Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2 gel for extraction of Cs(I) 
2.3.1 Synthesis of Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2 gel 83 
Another possible solid-state supported extraction system is functionalised SiO2 gel that can be 
used in column separation, allowing for long contact time with the absorbent moiety. As with 
MNPs, the use of functionalised SiO2 gel reduces the amount of secondary waste and has the 
possibility for subsequent stripping of the loaded support to reduce the volume of waste 
further while recycling the absorbent material. Calix[4]arene-bis-[(4-carboxyl-1,2-phenylene)-
crown-6] was synthesised as previously described in Section 2.1 and then immobilised onto 
commercially available macroscopic chloropropyl-functionalised silica gel by stirring 
calix[4]arene-bis-[(4-carboxyl-1,2-phenylene)-crown-6] and sodium hydride in DMF. 
Chloropropyl-functionalized silica gel was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (particle size 230-400 
mesh and a pore size of 60 ) and used as supplied. The extent of chloropropyl labelling of the 
purchased substrate was ~ 2.5 % loading and the matrix active group was ~ 8 % functionalised.

2.3.2 Characterisation of Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel  
The degree of functionalisation of calix[4]bis-crown onto the surface of the silicagel was 
monitored using several analytical techniques. FT-IR was utilised to compare the commercial 
chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel with the calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silicagel. Both show 
the strong Si-O-Si stretch at 1059 cm-1 but only the calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2 gel 
shows a C=O stretch at 1717 cm-1. 
  Chapter 2 - Caesium Selective Ligand Studies 
Figure 2.25 FT-IR comparison of chloro-functionalised silica gel 82 and calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised silica gel 83.  
Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of both chloro-functionalised silica gel and 
calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel show an increase of O content as a result of 
incorporation of the oxygen rich calix[4]bis-crown and a decrease in Si and Cl (Table 2.2). 
Roughly half of the chlorine has been lost, correlating to circa 51% immobilisation of 
calix[4]bis-crown onto the available sites. The margin for error for EDX is 0.1% for uniform 
flat surfaces; however, here the error could be greater as the silica gel isnt uniformly flat. This 
reduces the reliability of EDX spectroscopy. TGA analysis of the chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 
shows a mass loss around 125 C, proposed to correspond to the loss of absorbed water, 
followed by a near-linear loss between 250-700 C relating to decomposition of organic 
matter. TGA analysis of calix[4]bis-crown silica gel (Appendix A2) shows a similar trend as the 
chloro-functionalised SiO2 (Appendix A1), with the greater near linear loss occurring at 300-
700 C relating to circa 10% w/w.

2.3.3 Extraction studies of Calix[4]bis -crown functionalised silica gel 83 
As previously reported in Section 2.2.3 the calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel was 
compared with the commercial chloro-functionalised silica gel to ensure that it was indeed 
the ligand that was responsible for the caesium extraction. A column extraction technique was 
simulated using both calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel and chloro-functionalised silica 
gel. The extraction efficiencies of chloro-functionalised silica gel and calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised silica gel were found to be 18% and 99% respectively (Table 2.3). This proves 
that the majority of the extraction capacity of calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica gel is due 
to the calix[4]bis-crown ligand and that calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica  gel is a viable 
option in removing caesium.  
Table 2.3 Extraction of Cs+ from aqueous solution at pH 7 by column extraction loaded with 
chloro-functionalised silica gel and calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica gel. 
The capacity of the calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel was investigated. A column was 
loaded with 500 mg of calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica gel and 5 mL samples of Cs+ (100 
ppb) at pH 7 were passed through at a rate of 5 mL min-1. After five runs, all saw >90% 
extraction of Cs+, however the extraction efficiency dramatically dropped to <20% on the 6th 
run. From the previous capacity test, comparison to chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel showed 
that standard silica was able to extract near 20% of Cs+ which is what is being observed after 
the fifth run. Therefore the capacity of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2 gel for caesium 
was approximately 5 g g-1.

Figure 2.27 Capacity test for calix[4]bis-crown functionalised SiO2 gel.  
With a flow rate of 5 mL min-1, the maximum capacity of the calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised 
silica gel was achieved after 5 minutes. This is a vast improvement compared to the calix[4]bis-
crown functionalised MNPs, where high extraction was only attained after 1 hour. This could 
be because the 5 mL samples were being actively forced through a higher concentration of 
functionalised solid-state support compared to the dispersion of MNPs in a sample. A possible 
improvement for calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica gel 83 is to improve immobilisation of 
the ligand onto the silica gel. Utilising a Finkelstein reaction with the addition of potassium 
iodide could greatly increase both the rate and yield of immobilisation by replacing the 
chlorine of chloro-functionalised silica gel 82 with iodine which is a far superior leaving group.

53,54,55,56-octahydroxycalix[8]arene 85  
The target molecule chosen as a potential strontium-selective ligand was a functionalised 
calix[8]arene. Calix[8]arenes have been shown to extract strontium selectively over sodium 
when possessing amide functionalisation on the lower rim.93 Therefore these octa-amides 
were chosen for investigation of their extraction abilities when immobilised onto solid 
supports.  
The first step of the synthesis was to produce the octamer as shown in Scheme 3.1.  
Scheme 3.1 Synthesis of 5,11,17,23,29,35,41,47-octakis(benzyloxy)-49,50,51,52, 53,54,55,56-
octahydroxycalix[8]arene 85 
  Chapter 3  Strontium Selective Ligand Studies  
A base-induced reaction was utilised for the synthesis of calix[8]arenes as the reaction can 
proceed in one pot. The precursor 4-benzyloxyphenol 84 was heated to reflux in p-xylene with 
potassium tert-butoxide as the base. This reaction produces a mixture of cyclic oligomers from 
the hexamer to the octamer. In this process, the potassium tert-butoxide initiates the 
formation of the phenoxide ion, which acting as a carbon nucleophile under the apolar 
conditions, attacks the formaldehyde.    
Figure 3.1 Mechanism for formation of 4-(benzyloxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenol 
Mild conditions allow the 4-(benzyloxy)-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenol to be isolated. However, 
heating to reflux in p-xylene pushes the reaction further via elimination to form as series of o-
quinonemethide intermediates. A phenoxide ion reacts with the o-quinonemethide 
intermediate to form the methylene bridge. These steps are repeated to form linear oligomers 
that, at the hexamer level, can also undergo an intramolecular cyclisation.  
  Chapter 3  Strontium Selective Ligand Studies  
Figure 3.2 Mechanism for the formation of linear oligomers. 
Linear octamers have not been detected during the synthesis of calix[8]arenes, with tetramers 
being the dominant linear oligomer identified. Therefore calix[8]arenes would appear to be 
formed via a pathway in which a pair of linear tetramers form an intermolecularly hydrogen-
bonded dimer termed a hemicalix[8]arene. Reaction of the termini links the tetramers to form 
the cyclic octamer. During the synthesis of calix[8]arenes, small proportions of calix[6]arenes 
and calix[7]arenes are produced but the desired calix[8]arene could be purified by heating the 
crude mixture to reflux in chloroform for 3 hours and hot filtering the homogeneous mixture. 
Calix[6]arene and calix[7]arene dissolve in hot chloroform, leaving insoluble calix[8]arene as 
the residue on the filter.

The 1H NMR spectrum shown in Figure 3.3 indicates the successful formation of the octamer 
by the appearance of the methylene bridge resonance at  3.77. Mass spectroscopy confirmed 
the cyclic octamer was formed displaying a [M-H]- peak at 1695.6626 corresponding to the

The amide functionality was then added onto the lower rim of the calix[8]arene to provide the 
N-donor moiety needed to complex with strontium cations. Reaction of the calix[8]arene 85 
with 2-chloro-N,N-diethylacetamide 86 provided the desired amide functionality.

The presence of the diethylacetamide groups is evident from the 1H NMR spectrum shown in 
Figure 3.4. The ethyl group protons appear as doubled multiplet resonances at  3.34  3.03 
and 1.09  0.84 as a result of hindered rotation around the amide bond.

Once the amide functionality had been appended the benzylated hydroxyl groups on the 
upper rim of the calixarene needed to be deprotected to allow for immobilisation onto solid-
state supports.  
The benzyl group was successfully cleaved via a palladium-catalysed hydrogenation. 
Cyclohexene was used as the hydrogen source with Pd(OH)2/C to produce the deprotected 
calix[8]amide 87.

successful. In addition, the CH3 resonances of the two diethyl groups showed greater

Calix[8]amide 87 was immobilised onto iodopropyl-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 67, 
synthesised as described in Section 2.2.1. Deprotonation of the hydroxyl groups of 
calix[8]amide 87 using sodium hydride allowed for nucleophilic substitution onto the iodo-

The success of the immobilisation of calix[8]amide 87 onto the iodo-functionalised SiO2-

calix[8]amide 87 onto iodopropyl-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 67 results in suppression 
of the C-I stretching absorption at 689 cm-1 and the appearance of an absorption at 1671 cm-

oxygen for iodopropyl-functionalised MNPs 67 and 28.33% oxygen for calix[8]amide

calix[8]amide 87 as 84% of the iodopropyl groups had been successfully displaced.

The organic coating on the MNPs was further investigated using thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA) under nitrogen. The loss in mass below 100 C can be attributed to the loss of absorbed 
water and the significant loss in mass at 200-600 C is most likely due to decomposition of the 
organic content. Comparison of the TGA analysis between 67 and 88 revealed the content of 
calix[8]amide 87 in the calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2-coated MNPs 88 to be 26% w/w.

Figure 3.10 shows the poor extraction of Sr2+ with both calix[8]amide functionalised MNPs 88

minimal improvement in extraction compared to iodopropyl-functionalised MNPs 67. The pH 
was changed to neutral to test whether the system was pH sensitive. The samples were 
subjected to the same conditions as the pH 2 samples, which resulted in a decrease in 
percentage extraction. The calix[8]amide functionalised MNPs 88 showed an average of 3% 
extraction in neutral pH, the same as the precursor. The amide functionality of the 
calix[8]amide provides the N-donor moiety needed to complex with the strontium cations, but 
this is limited to the lower rim of the calix[8]arene. This leaves the upper rim open for water 
molecules to solvate the strontium cation, limiting the calix[8]amides extraction ability.

3.3.1 Synthesis of Calix[8]amide functionalised SiO 2 gel 89  
Calix[8]amide 87 was immobilised onto SiO2 gel to investigate whether the solid-state support 
is the reason for the poor extraction observed with the functionalised MNPs. Calix[8]amide 87 
was synthesised as previously described in Section 3.1 and then immobilised onto 
commercially available macroscopic chloropropyl-functionalised SiO2 gel 82. Thus, 
calix[8]amide 87 was deprotonated with sodium hydride and then reacted with chloropropyl-
functionalised SiO2 gel 82.  
Scheme 3.5 Immobilisation of calix[8]amide onto chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 89. 
3.3.2 Characterisation of Calix[8]amide functionalised SiO 2 gel 89 
The degree of functionalisation of calix[8]amide 87 onto the surface of the SiO2 gel was 
monitored using several analytical techniques. FT-IR was utilised to compare chloro-
functionalised SiO2 gel 82 and calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 gel 89. Both spectra showed 
a strong Si-O-Si stretch at 1053 cm-1 but only calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 gel 89 showed 
a C=O stretch of the amide functionality at 1612 cm-1.

Figure 3.11 FT-IR of Chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 and calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 gel 
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to observe the percentage change of elements 
upon immobilisation. An increase of oxygen due to the calix[8]amide was observed as well as 
a decrease in Si and Cl (Table 3.2), which could indicate successful immobilisation of 
calix[8]amide into silica gel. However, as seen with calix[4]bis-crown-functionalised silica gel 
83, the percentage change in C doesnt correlate to ligand immobilisation and the margin of 
error for EDX (0.1 for uniformly flat surfaces) may negate the decrease in Cl. If the ligand has 
been immobilised then this shows that EDX spectroscopy is not sensitive enough to quantify 
the percentage change of elements.

TGA analysis of chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 showed an initial mass loss around 125 C, 
probably relating to the loss of absorbed water, followed by a near linear loss between 250-
700 C most likely relating to decomposition of organic matter (Appendix A3). TGA analysis of 
calix[8]amide SiO2 gel 89 showed a similar trend as the chloro-functionalised SiO2 82 
(Appendix A1), with the near linear loss occurring at 350-600 C relating to 7% w/w loading. 
Surface morphology of chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 and calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 
gel 89, shown in Figure 3.12, was examined by SEM. Comparison of the SEM images highlights 
the increased surface roughness caused by the possible incorporation of calix[8]amide 87 onto 
the surface of the SiO2.

3.3.3 Extraction studies of Calix[8]amide functionalised SiO 2 gel 89. 
The extraction capability of calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 gel 89 was investigated 
compared to chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82. A column extraction technique was trialled 
using both calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 gel 89 and chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 in 
separate columns. The columns were loaded with 500 mg of calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 
gel 89 or chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 and these were eluted with 5 mL samples of Sr2+ 
(100 ppb) at pH 2 at a rate of 5 mL min-1. However, as with the calix[8]amide functionalised 
SiO2 MNPs 88 in Section 3.2, extraction of Sr2+ was poor with calix[8]amide functionalised SiO2 
gel 89, while the chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel 82 displayed no extraction. This highlights that 
the solid-state support is not the issue with extraction capabilities and that the ligand itself 
needs modification to improve extraction. Addition of functionality on the upper rim could 
help to stabilise complexation with alkali metals. Calix[8]amides with the benzyl protecting 
groups on the upper rim have been investigated in a liquid-liquid extraction of Sr2+ by Casnati 
et al. showing a high selectivity for Sr over Na.93 The presence of the benzyl group could be 
crucial in providing additional electron density to stabilise complexation and prevent stripping 
from water molecules and other complexing anions. Another improvement, previously stated 
in Section 2.3.3, would be to improve immobilisation of calix[8]amide 87 to chloro-
functionalised SiO2 gel 82. Utilising the Finkelstein reaction with the addition of potassium 
iodide or sodium iodide would produce iodo-functionalised SiO2 gel which could improve the 
rate and yield of immobilisation as the iodo-functionalisation is a much better leaving group 
than the chloro-functionalisation.

4.1 Introduction 
The CyMe4-BTBP ligand 25, designed as a possible extractant of trivalent actinides in the 
presence of lanthanides and the current benchmark for the SANEX process in Europe was 
synthesised by the Harwood group from 2,2-bypyridine 19.16,45 Separation of the minor 
actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel allows for a process called transmutation 
where the minor actinides are bombarded with neutrons, facilitating their conversion to 
shorter-lived isotopes.15,16 The presence of lanthanides greatly inhibits transmutation because 
the lanthanides have high neutron capture cross sections that will absorb neutrons.6 While 
BTBP cannot significantly differentiate the minor actinides from lanthanides, it is able to 
extract certain corrosion and fission products that complicate the separation process.115 These 
corrosion and fission products could be removed utilising a two-column process involving 
BTBP immobilised SiO2 gel to co-extract the problematic corrosion and fission products, while 
BTPhen immobilised SiO2 gel could separate the minor actinides from lanthanides at 4M

4.1.1 Synthesis of tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 
The synthesis of BTBP involves a 4-step route starting from 2,2-bipyridine 19, that is bis-N-
oxidised using hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid resulting in bis-2,2-bipyridine N-oxide. The 
dinitrile is synthesised using a Reissert-Henze cyanidation reaction with trimethylsilyl cyanide 
and benzoyl chloride. The dinitrile is then reacted with hydrazine in ethanol to form the bis-
aminohydrazide.134 A condensation reaction with bromomethyl diketone yields tetra-
bromomethyl BTBP.

4.1.2 Extraction studies of tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69 
Harwood and Afsar et al. studied the extraction ability of tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP 
immobilised SiO2 gel 69 for transition metals in the presence of group I, II and III metals. BTBP 
functionalised SiO2 gel 69 was loaded into a column and standard solutions at pH 0.5 
containing a range of metals, each at 100 ppb concentration (100 mL) were passed through 
  Chapter 4  BTBP MNPs Studies  
the column.115 Figure 4.1 shows the percentage extraction of different metals with this BTBP 
functionalised SiO2 gel 69.

4.2.1 Synthesis of BTBP functionalised SiO 2 coated MNPs 96  
Extraction studies were carried out using previously immobilised tetra-bromomethyl BTBP 
onto SiO2 coated MNPs. Tetra-bromomethyl BTBP was directly immobilised using 
triethylamine in DMF onto aminopropyl-SiO2 coated MNPs.  
Scheme 4.3 Synthesis of BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96

4.2.2 Capacity Study of BTBP functionalised SiO 2 coated MNPs 96 
The capacity of tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 was 
investigated for comparison with BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69. Standard solutions at pH 0.5

each at 100 ppb concentration (100 mL) were used. The samples were mixed with BTBP 
functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 using a different dosage for each sample (10 mg, 100 mg, 
200 mg, 500 mg). Figure 4.3 shows the percentage extraction of various transition metals by 
tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96. Mn2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+ were not 
extracted by these tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 compared 
to >80% by the tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69. The main difference is the 
extraction technique used, with tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 
utilising a batch extraction method and tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69 
using a column extraction method. The column extraction technique actively forces metal ions 
through a higher concentration of functionalised solid-state support compared to the 
dispersion of MNPs in a sample However, the BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 have 
a high affinity for Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+ even at the lowest dose (10 mg) almost recreating the 
extraction percentages achieved using BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel.

While the overall extraction percentages are lower than those of the BTBP functionalised SiO2 
gel 69, specific selectivity was still observed, with the BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 
96 extracting Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+ >80% compared to the remaining transition metals showing 
<10% with the exception of Ni2+ and Co2+.  
4.2.3 Kinetic Study of BTBP functionalised SiO 2 coated MNPs 96 
The kinetics of extraction were then tested to compare with the fast kinetics achieved with 
BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69, where samples were passed through the column at a rate of 
10 mL min-1.115 The change in pH was also investigated, running kinetics tests at pH 0.5, 2 and 
7. Standard solutions at containing various transition metals  Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, 
Cd2+, V5+ and Cr3+ each at 100 ppb concentration (100 mL) were made up at pH 0.5, 2 and 7 
using nitric acid to achieve acidic conditions. The samples were mixed with BTBP 
functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 (10 mg) and mixed for 24 hours. Samples (5 mL) were 
taken at varying intervals (5 mins  24 hours) to be analysed using ICP-MS.  
Figure 4.4 shows the extraction kinetics of Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+ all of which showed high 
extraction in the capacity study. The extraction kinetics show Ag+ achieving maximum 
extraction after 4 hours; whereas Cu2+ and Cd2+ extraction plateaued after 8 hours. 
  Chapter 4  BTBP MNPs Studies  
Figure 4.4 Extraction data at pH 0.5 for Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+ 
The extraction kinetics observed with BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 were 
noticeably slower than those achieved using BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69. Despite the large 
surface area of MNPs, the functionalised SiO2 gel showed faster kinetics, while the less 
selectivity in the extraction could be because of the extraction technique used as the column 
method may be increasing contact time between the ligand and metal ions.  
Comparing with the other transition metals shown in Figure 4.5, a much lower overall 
extraction was achieved ranging between 40-50%.

The extraction of the remaining transition metals showed a near linear increase in extraction 
over time. However, V5+, Cr3+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ all showed a decrease in extraction between 480-
1440 minutes. 
With the samples at pH 2, similar results were found where Ag+ was extracted much faster 
than Cd2+ and Cu2+ as shown in Figure 4.6. However, compared to pH 0.5, Cd2+ and Cu2+ were 
extracted more slowly and resulted in a lower percentage extraction after 24 hours. This could 
be because the concentration of nitrate ion, which provides an effective counterion for the 
BTBP-metal ion complexes, is lower at pH 2 than pH 0.5.

The remaining transition metal extraction data for pH 2 are shown in Figure 4.7. The extraction 
kinetics were slower and could well need longer than 24 hours to achieve maximum capacity. 
This further highlights the importance of the nitrate counterion, which is needed to stabilise 
the BTBP-metal ion complex.   
At pH 7 Ag+ shows a slower rate of extraction but still achieves maximum extraction after 24 
hours as shown in Figure 4.8. The decrease after 8 hours for Ag+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ could be 
because of the precipitation of metal hydroxides.

comparable to Co2+ and Ni2+ extraction after 24 hours at pH 0.5, while V5+ showed higher 
extraction before decreasing after 8 hours which could be due to precipitation of vanadium 
hydroxide complexes.  
Figure 4.9 - Kinetic extraction data at pH 7 for V5+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ 
The concentration of nitrate counterion is the lowest in the samples at pH 7 compared to 
samples at pH 2 and 0.5. The low concentration of nitrate ions, an effective counterion for 
BTBP-metal ion complexes, causes the slow extraction kinetics observed at pH 7. 
4.3 Conclusion 
BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 show selectivity for Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+, which is not 
observed in the extraction data for BTBP functionalised SiO2 gel 69. High percentage extraction 
was achieved for Cu2+, Ag+ and Cd2+ (>80%) after 24 hours; whereas poor extraction was 
observed for Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, V5+ and Cr 3+. The batch technique involving mixing BTBP 
functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 in sample solutions may have a reduced contact time 
between the BTBP ligand and metal ions compared to the column technique. As the MNPs 
5 30 60 120 240 480 1440

V Cr Mn Co Ni Zn
  Chapter 4  BTBP MNPs Studies  
have a higher surface area and higher loading of BTBP onto the surface compared to the 
functionalised SiO2 gel, using the BTBP functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 96 in a column 
method may achieve high extraction for all the transition metals and fast extraction kinetics. 
Higher extraction was observed in pH 0.5 owing to the higher concentration of nitrate anions 
which stabilise the cation-BTBP complex. The importance of nitrate anion concentration was 
observed from the reduction in extraction capabilities and decreased kinetics in pH 2 and 7.

  Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work  
5.1 Conclusions 
The introduction to this thesis outlined a review into current proposed processes for nuclear 
decommissioning. The development of selective ligands for caesium and strontium in the 
presence of other group I and II elements was discussed for extraction of fission products from 
SNF and environmental contamination. Advancements in solid support extraction and 
immobilisation of selective ligands onto the surface of magnetic nanoparticles and 
macroscopic silica gel was covered. 
The reported synthesis of calix[4]bis-crown 47 was followed, with improved modifications 
developed for the synthesis of diol 72 and the tosylation reaction to afford ditosylate 78. 
Utilising a Finkelstein reaction in the synthesis of diol 72 achieved a yield of 93% compared to 
the literature, where a 30% yield was reported.85 The tosylation of diol 72 to ditosylate 78 was 
improved by means of sonication. The literature reported a yield of 86% after 6 days stirring 
in DCM with triethylamine and toluenesulfonyl chloride.85 Using the same reagents, the 
reaction was sonicated affording ditosylate 78 after 5 hours with a yield of 92%. Using these 
improved synthetic routes, calix[4]bis-crown 47, covalently bonded to silica-coated MNPs 81 
or incorporated onto the surface of macroscopic silica gel 83, was investigated for its ability 
to selectively extract Cs+ in the presence of alkali metals (Li+, Na+, K+), group II metals (Ca2+, 
Mg2+) and transition metals such as Fe3+ and Cu2+.  
Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica-coated MNPs 81 displayed high selectivity for Cs+ over 
alkali metals, group II metals and transition metals at pH 7. Stripping of Cs+ from calix[4]bis-
crown MNPs 81 was exhibited in 2% HNO3 solution allowing for recycling of calix[4]bis-crown 
MNPs 81. A dose concentration of 0.5 mg mL-1 achieved high extraction (> 90%) of 100 ppb 
Cs+, which upon extrapolation, infers that 250 g of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs 
  Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work  
would be needed for 500 L of Cs contaminated water at 100 ppb Cs+. This shows a potential 
for a vast reduction in secondary waste compared to liquid-liquid extraction methods. 
Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica gel 83 also exhibited high extraction (> 90%) of 100 ppb 
Cs+. Calix[4]bis-crown silica gel 83 displayed fast extraction kinetics, achieving maximum 
capacity after 5 minutes compared to calix[4]bis-crown MNPs 81 where high extraction was 
reached after 1 hour of mixing.  
Calix[8]amide 87 was synthesised for selective extraction of strontium from aqueous media 
present in PUREX raffinate or environmental contamination. The cyclic octamers were isolated 
from cyclic hexamers and heptamers by filtration from hot chloroform. Both cyclic hexamers 
and heptamers dissolved in hot chloroform, leaving insoluble cyclic octamer after filtration. 
An amide functionality was applied to the lower rim of the calix[8]arene, followed by 
deprotection of the benzoyl group to phenol in the upper rim. This functionalised 
calix[8]amide 87 was covalently bound to silica-coated MNPs 88 and immobilised onto the 
surface of macroscopic silica gel 89 for strontium extraction studies.  
Unfortunately, calix[8]amide functionalised silica-coated MNPs 88 displayed poor extraction 
capabilities for strontium, only extracting < 10% at pH 2 and < 5% at pH 7. Calix[8]amide 
functionalised silica gel 89 also exhibited poor extraction capabilities. Higher extractions 
observed at pH 2 may be due to the presence of nitrate counter anions, able to stabilise 
complexation between strontium cations and the calix[8]amide. The amide functionality on 
the lower rim of calix[8]amide provides N-donor moiety that complexes with the strontium 
cations. However, the lack of functionality on the upper rim leaves the strontium cation 
susceptible to solvation by water molecules. Functionalisation of the upper rim could supply 
  Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work  
addition electron density to stabilise the calix[8]amide-strontium cation complex and protect 
the strontium cation from stripping.  
Tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised silica-coated MNPs 96 were investigated and 
compared to tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised macroscopic silica gel 69 for uptake of 
problematic corrosion and fission products present in nuclear waste streams. Tetra-
bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised silica-coated MNPs 96 were found to be selective for Ag+, 
Cd2+ and Cu2+ achieving high extraction (> 80%) in batch studies at pH 0.5, 2 and 7. Increased 
extraction abilities and good kinetics of extraction were observed at pH 0.5, possibly because 
of the higher concentration of nitrate ions. The nitrate ions act as counter anions, stabilising 
the cation-BTBP complex. Better extraction kinetics and extraction efficiencies for all fission 
and corrosion products tested were observed with tetra-bromomethyl-BTBP functionalised 
silica gel 95 using a column extraction technique.  
5.2 Future Work 
Further investigation into ligand immobilised magnetic nanoparticles is necessary, particularly 
with regards to their use conditions in nuclear decommissioning. In such environments, 
magnetic separation must be examined in pipework of decommissioning process plants and 
nuclear plants. The use of solid supports over liquid-liquid techniques would allow for a vast 
decrease in secondary waste, allowing a more manageable process.  
Calix[4]bis-crown 47 immobilised onto solid supports have led to positive extraction results 
for caesium. The synthetic route to calix[4]bis-crown 47 requires a slow macrocyclisation that 
needs to be improved in order to make calix[4]bis-crown 47 a desirable option for caesium 
extraction. Mitsunobu reactions are regularly used to form ether bonds from alcohols.135137 
  Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work  
A modified Mitsunobu reaction, coupling diol 72 to calix[4]arene 35, could be beneficial to 
increase the overall yield of calix[4]bis-crown 47.  
Immobilisation of calix[4]bis-crown 47 onto silica gel displayed high extraction capabilities (> 
90%) for caesium. Further study into the selectivity of calix[4]bis-crown functionalised silica 
gel 83 for caesium over sodium is needed. A column loaded with calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised silica gel 83 would be subject to a multielement solution containing Cs+, alkali 
metals (Li+, Na+, K+), group II metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and the transition metals such as Fe3+ and 
Cu2+. ICP-MS analysis on samples before and after they are passed through the column would 
determine the selectivity of the functionalised silica gel 83.  
Incorporation of a vinyl functionality on calix[4]bis-crown 47 would allow for co-
polymerisation with styrene. Co-polymerisation with styrene allows for more control of ligand 
loading by changing the ratio of ligand to styrene. Electro-spinning the resulting co-polymer 
would produce a fibrous network with a very high surface area capable of passive 
extraction.138 The inert fibrous polymer network could be placed in a porous container into a 
contaminated sample, where the ligand immobilised onto the network could harvest the 
target contaminant. This is ideal for areas where aggressive mixing or column extraction is not 
appropriate, such as remote areas where electrical power is not available or where 
concentrations of the desired metal are so low that it would be economically unfeasible to 
expend energy in the extraction (eg. precious metals from seawater).  
Calix[8]amide 87 immobilised onto solid supports performed poorly in the extraction of 
strontium. Deprotection of the benzyl groups to phenols in the upper rim was employed to 
produce a means of immobilisation to solid supports. However this leaves the cavity of 
calix[8]amide exposed to stripping agents and solvating molecules such as ubiquitous water. 
  Chapter 5  Conclusions and Future Work  
Calix[8]amide with the benzyl protecting groups on the upper rim has previously been 
investigated in a liquid-liquid extraction of Sr2+ showing a high selectivity for Sr over Na.93 
Replacement of the benzyl group with a functionalised benzyl group (e.g. 4-
(chloromethyl)benzoic acid) would allow for immobilisation to solid supports and stabilise the 
cation-calix[8]amide complex. The presence of the benzyl group could be crucial in providing 
additional electron density to stabilise complexation and prevent stripping from water 
molecules and other complexing anions.

Potassium carbonate (31.5 g, 225 mmol) was added to a suspension of ethyl 3,4-
dihydroxybenzoate 7 (10.0 g, 54 mmol) and the mixture stirred at room temperature in 
acetonitrile (270 mL) for 2 hours. The mixture was then heated to reflux and 2-(2-
chloroethoxyl)ethanol 71 (13.4 mL, 127 mmol) was added. After 3 days, additional potassium 
carbonate (12.002 g, 86 mmol) and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 (7.0 mL, 66 mmol) were 
added and the mixture was returned to reflux for a further 4 days. The solvent was then 
removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) and 
washed successively with 1M HCl (2 x 50 mL), water (2 x 50 mL) and brine (2 x 50 mL). The 
mixture was then dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated via rotary evaporation to afford 
diol 72 (7.99 g, 41%) as a yellow oil.  
Method 2: 
Potassium carbonate (33.56 g, 243.2 mmol, 4 e.q) and potassium iodide (25.20 g, 151.8 mmol, 
2.5 e.q) were added to a suspension of ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate 70 (11.06 g, 60.7 mmol) 
in acetonitrile (250 mL). After stirring at RT for 2 hours, 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 (15.83 
mL, 151.8 mmol) was added to the suspension and the mixture heated to reflux under

(12.50g, 75 mmol) and 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 (7 mL, 66 mmol) were added to the 
suspension and reflux under nitrogen was maintained for a further 3 days. The suspension 
was then cooled to RT, deionised water (100 mL) was added and the product was extracted 
into dichloromethane (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with 1M HCl 
(200 mL), deionised water (200 mL) and brine (200 mL). The organic phase was dried over 
magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford diol 72 (20.23 g, 93%) as a 
brown oil. 
Method 3: 
Potassium carbonate (33.56 g, 243.2 mmol, 4 e.q) and potassium iodide (25.20 g, 151.8 mmol, 
2.5 e.q) were added to a suspension of ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate 70 (11.06 g, 60.7 mmol) 
in acetonitrile (250 mL). After stirring at RT for 2 hours, 2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethanol 71 (15.83

6.5 ICP-MS Extraction Studies 
6.5.1 ICP-MS General Procedure 
ICP-MS analysis was carried out using a Thermo-Fisher iCAP Q ICP-MS with Rh as the internal 
standard. A stock solution of 2% HNO3 spiked with 5 ppb Rh was prepared using ultra-pure 
water and HNO3 (70%, purified by redistillation,  99.999% trace metals basis). All standard 
solutions were prepared using the stock solution of 2% HNO3 spiked with 5 ppb Rh. Standards 
were prepared using metal mixes purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as TraceCERT (Traceable 
Certified Reference Materials). Standards used to calibrate the ICP-MS were at concentrations 
of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 ppb. All extraction samples were normalised to 2% HNO3 and spiked 
with 5 ppb Rh before testing. Samples (5 mL) were taken before and after extractions to 
provide true initial and end concentrations. An average of three readings was taken with all 
samples.  
6.5.2 Examination of Calix[4]bis-crown MNPs Extraction Ability  
Six samples of Cs solution (10 mL) were made to approx. 10 ppb using a stock Cs solution (1000 
ppm). Three samples were subjected to mixing with calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs 81 
(5 mg) and the other three with iodo-functionalised MNPs 67 (5 mg). Mixing was carried out 
for 24 hours and the mixtures were then placed onto neodymium magnets to ensure 
separation of nanoparticles. The samples were then centrifuged and passed through a 0.22 
micron filter to ensure all large particles had been removed before ICP-MS analysis. After 
filtration, 5 mL aliquots were subjected to ICP-MS analysis.  
6.5.3 Capacity study of Calix[4]bis-crown functionalised MNPs  
Five samples of Cs solution (100 mL) were made to approx. 100 ppb using a stock Cs solution 
(1000 ppm) at pH 7. The samples were mixed with calix[4]bis-crown MNPs 81 using different 
  Chapter 6  Experimental  
dosages for each sample (2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg). Mixing was carried out for 24 
hours and the samples were then placed onto neodymium magnets to ensure separation of 
nanoparticles. Small samples (10 mL) were then taken from each test and were subjected to 
centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure all solid particles had been 
removed. After filtration, 5 mL aliquots were subjected to ICP-MS analysis. 
6.5.4 Kinetics Study of calix[4]bis-crown MNPs 
A sample of Cs solution (200 mL) was made to approx. 100 ppb using a stock Cs solution (1000 
ppm) at pH 7. The sample was mixed with calix[4]bis-crown MNPs 81 (100 mg) for 24 hours. 
Small samples (10 mL) were taken at intervals (5, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 1440 mins) and 
placed onto neodymium magnets to ensure separation of nanoparticles. Samples were 
subjected to centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure all solid particles 
had been removed. After filtration, 5 mL aliquots were subjected to ICP-MS analysis. 
6.5.5 Competing Ion study of calix[4]bis -crown MNPs 
Three samples of Cs/multi-element solution (100 mL) were made to approx. 100 ppb using a 
stock Cs solution (1000 ppm) at pH 7. The multi-element stock contained Al, Sb, Ba, Pb, B, Ca, 
Cd, Cr, Co, Fe, K, Cu, Li, Mg, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Si, Ti, V and Zn (all at 100 ppm).  Each sample was 
made to a different concentration of multi-elements (10 ppb, 250 ppb and 1000 ppb) using 
the multi-element stock solution. The samples were mixed with calix[4]bis-crown 
functionalised MNPs 81 (50 mg) for 120 minutes and samples (100 mL) were placed onto 
neodymium magnets to ensure separation of nanoparticles from the samples. Small samples 
(10 mL) were then taken from each test and were subjected to centrifuging and passed 
through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure all solid particles had been removed. After filtration, 5 
mL aliquots were subjected to ICP-MS analysis. 
  Chapter 6  Experimental  
6.5.6 Examination of Calix[4]bis-crown SiO2 gel Extraction Ability 
A column was loaded with calix[4]bis-crown SiO2 gel 83 (500 mg). A sample of Cs solution (100 
ppb) at pH 7 (5 mL) was passed through the column with a flow rate of 5 mL min-1. The eluent 
was subjected to centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure no silica that 
may have passed through the column was in the eluent. A sample (5 mL) was then taken for 
ICP-MS analysis. Extraction was repeated with a new sample of Cs solution (100 ppb) which 
was passed through a chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel loaded column to compare extraction 
capabilities of the two solid phases.  
6.5.7 Capacity study of calix[4]bis-crown SiO2 gel 
Calix[4]bis-crown SiO2 gel 83 (500 mg) was loaded onto a column. Seven samples of Cs solution 
(100 ppb) at pH 7 (5 mL) were passed through the column with a flow rate of 5 mL min-1. Each 
5 mL sample was subjected to centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure 
no silica that may have passed through the column was in the eluent. The samples were then 
subjected to ICP-MS analysis.  
6.5.8 Examination of Calix[8]amide MNPs Extraction Ability  
Six samples of Sr solution (10 mL) were made to approx. 10 ppb using a stock Sr solution (1000 
ppm). Three samples were subjected to mixing with calix[8]amide functionalised MNPs 88 (5 
mg) and the final three with iodo-functionalised MNPs (5 mg). Mixing was carried out for 24 
hours and samples (10 mL) were placed onto neodymium magnets to ensure separation of 
nanoparticles. The samples were centrifuged and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to 
ensure all solid particles had been removed before ICP-MS analysis. After filtration, aliquots 
(5 mL) were subjected to ICP-MS analysis.  
  Chapter 6  Experimental

ppb) at pH 7 (5 mL) was passed through the column with a flow rate of 5 mL min-1. The eluent 
was subjected to centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron filter to ensure no silica that 
may have passed through the column was in the eluent. A sample (5 mL) was then subjected 
to ICP-MS analysis. Extraction was repeated with a new sample of Cs solution (100 ppb), which 
was passed through a chloro-functionalised SiO2 gel loaded column and treated in the same 
way to compare extraction capabilities.  
6.5.10 Capacity study of BTBP functionalised SiO 2 coated MNPs 
Four samples of 100 mL transition metal mix (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd) were made

mixed with different doses of BTBP-functionalised SiO2 coated MNPs 97 (10 mg, 100 mg, 200 
mg, 500 mg). Mixing was achieved for 8 hours and the samples were then placed onto 
neodymium magnets to ensure separation of nanoparticles. Small samples (10 mL) were then 
taken from each test and were subjected to centrifuging and passed through a 0.22 micron 
filter to ensure all solid particles had been removed. After filtration, 5 mL aliquots were 
subjected to ICP-MS analysis.
