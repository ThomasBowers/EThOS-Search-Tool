NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Abstract 
Rationale and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic  is thought  to be the greatest 
challenge the United Kingdom (UK)s intensive care units (ICUs) have faced. The 
literature on experiences of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly 
evolving. However, there appears to be a scarcity of research on how nurses who 
worked in ICUs during the pandemic construct their experiences and identities, 
within social, cultural and political contexts. 
Methodology: A qualitative approach, specifically narrative inquiry, was employed to 
explore the accounts of six nurses, all of whom worked in an ICU during the COVID- 
19 pandemic. The nurses were both ICU-trained nurses and redeployed nurses from 
other departments, recruited from a specialist cardiothoracic hospital. Nurses were 
interviewed individually using a semi-structured format. The content and structure of 
their narratives were analysed, with attention to performative and contextual aspects 
and the construction of narrative identity. 
Analysis: Nurses constructed rich, multi-layered narratives, enhancing the existing 
literature. Three broad stories were observed across the accounts: 1. It came with 
like a bang, 2. Working in the red zone, and 3. Looking back, looking forward. 
Nurses faced a multitude of morally challenging situations, including an inability to 
provide the usual standard of care, lack of adequate personal protective equipment 
(PPE), and faced the danger of contracting the virus and fears of infecting others. 
The analysis highlighted that the nurses worked to construct credible narratives that 
conveyed the difficulties they encountered. This particularly can be seen within the 
broader contention relating to the existence of the pandemic, despite being depicted 
as heroes by society, the Government and the media. Clinical implications and 
future research suggestions are proposed.

NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Chapter One: Introduction 
1.1 Chapter One: An Overview 
This research explored how nurses construct their narratives  of working in 
intensive care units (ICUs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the National Health 
Service (NHS) in England during 2020 - 2021. Within this chapter, I situate the 
research within a particular period of history, considering the broader research the 
current pandemic and the role of ICUs and healthcare workers (HCWs). Drawing on 
psychosocial and epistemological frameworks, I set out the relevance of the topic for 
the profession of clinical psychology and my own relationship to this and I provide a 
rationale for the particular approach I take in researching the topic now. 
1.2 Situating the Research 
This research, taking place between March 2020 to June 2021, was developed, 
conducted, and written amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses were recruited from a 
cardiothoracic hospital. The hospital began  treating  patients  with COVID-19 disease 
in April 2020. The project was developed between March and July 2020, during the 
first wave of the pandemic. Ethical approval was obtained in August 2020 when 
COVID-19 cases had reduced after the first wave. Recruitment began in October 
2020. Interviews took place between December 2020 and February 2021, during the 
resurgence of the second wave. 
1.3 Epistemological Position 
Epistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge, how it is acquired and 
how certain we can be about its validity (Willig, 2019). The epistemological stance 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
adopted for this project is social constructionism, which states that our understanding 
of the world is constructed through language (Burr & Dick, 2017). The approach 
assumes that knowledge is made rather than found (Rorty, 1989), for particular 
purposes (Chamberlain, 2015), and therefore endorses a critical stance towards 
taken for granted  knowledge (Burr, 2015).  It favours the view that knowledge 
should be viewed within the complex historical, cultural and political contexts through 
which it is generated (Burr & Dick, 2017). This research, therefore, does not seek to 
discover truth but rather explores how nurses who worked in an ICU during the 
COVID-19 pandemic construct their narratives within a particular time and context. 
I write in the first person, in line with my epistemological  position  to the project: 
that knowledge is contextually and interactionally constructed, and therefore, it is not 
possible to disentangle myself from the topic (Hinchman & Hinchman, 1997). 
1.4 Identity 
How identity is defined is dependent on ones epistemological lens. As this 
research takes a social constructionist stance, it is assumed that individuals have 
multiple, co-existing identities that are perpetually constructed in and through 
language (Bamberg et al., 2011; Bruner, 2003). Occupational choice is one such 
aspect of identity. Cowin et al. (2013) noted that for nurses, a strong professional 
identity is important for optimal job performance. 
Telling stories about ourselves is often referred to as a narrative identity 
(McAdams, 2011). It is proposed that narrative identities draw on broader social and 
cultural narratives, through interaction for the purposes of themselves and others 
(Cho, 2018). This also relates to the work of Neimeyer (2006) who writes that our 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
identities are established through the stories we tell of ourselves and others tell 
about us. 
1.4 Conceptualising Distress and Use of Language 
In exploring emotional responses to a pandemic, and witnessing  severe illness 
and death, it is expected that many will experience distress and traumatic reactions. 
Although the term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevails  in both  the 
literature and society, how emotional distress is conceptualised continues to be a 
moot point. 
Psychological and psychiatric perspectives  construct PTSD as purportedly 
resulting from disorganised  or incomplete processing  of emotions  and cognitions 
from the traumatic event(s) (Priya, 2015). This classification, however, evades layers 
of context (Zur, 1996). In addition to classifications such as PTSD, trauma can be 
viewed as an understandable, human response to a distressing situation. The Division 
of Clinical Psychology (2015) adopts this view, and therefore favours the terms 
emotional distress or distress response 
In line with the projects constructionist stance, it is important to question or 
deconstruct how knowledge and understanding take their form (Georgaca, 2013). A 
constructionist framework for trauma opens up space for alternative understandings 
for distress, and within their social, cultural, and historical contexts (Gergen, 2009) - 
which may or may not include dominant concepts such as PTSD symptoms (Priya, 
2015; Zur, 1996). In this thesis, trauma will be defined as difficult events that 
overwhelm our usual ways of coping (Johnstone, 2020a). This definition has been 
chosen because it frames suffering as understandable responses to socio-political, 
cultural, and relational contexts. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Whilst I critique some dominant language, I also use others. Specifically, this 
research holds a critical awareness to certain discourses and metaphors related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes metaphors of war, HCWs as heroes and 
saints, and the virus itself as a natural disaster such as a tsunami. However, I use 
other wartime language such as redeployed and waves of the pandemic. These 
will be used in order to easily convey a shared understanding. 
1.6 Situating Myself as the Researcher 
In early 2020, COVID-19 had reached the shores of the United Kingdom (UK), I 
was finalising my ethical approval for my original thesis. This was going to be on 
narratives of individuals living with a heart transplant. 
I never anticipated that my original research project would  collapse,  and  I certainly 
did not think  it would be due to a global  pandemic. The hospital I had planned to 
recruit from, as a specialist cardiothoracic centre with an ICU, began preparing for the 
influx of patients with severe disease caused by COVID-19. I soon learnt that research 
unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic would not be granted NHS ethical approval. My 
original topic had a great amount of personal significance to me, and the realisation  
that this would  no longer  be possible  was a loss.  However, it could be said that, at 
this moment, my new thesis  began.  It soon  became a topic that I would dedicate 
myself to for the next 15 months. 
I have felt connected to the ICU context since my childhood. Growing up, I spent 
time in ICUs when my youngest sister, Grace, had multiple surgeries for a congenital 
heart condition.  I remember spending  time around  Graces bed in the ICU, 
fascinated watching the nurses work. Grace never left the ICU, but if she had lived, 
she would have gone on to need further surgery, likely a heart transplant, and would 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
have spent more time in ICUs throughout her life. Perhaps I feel that by listening to 
nurses stories of a difficult time, I am sustaining them in some way. Maybe, then, in 
another world where Grace had gone on to live, they would help sustain her. 
1.7 Background Literature: Situating the Topic 
1.7.1 Pandemics and impact on health care workers. 
The World Health Organisation (WHO) (2010) define a pandemic as a global 
spread  of a new disease.  Key features of a pandemic  include a wide geographic 
area, disease movement, multiple cases appearing in a short period, minimal 
population immunity, novelty, infectiousness, and disease severity (Morens et al., 
2009). As the world has become increasingly connected through human mobility and 
global travel, infectious diseases can spread both faster and further from their origin 
(WHO, 2018). 
Healthcare systems have played a critical role in previous infectious disease 
outbreaks (WHO, n.d.), however, research has shown such work can have an impact 
on HCWs. Research on the psychological impact of the 2003 severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic report that HCWs experience stress (Bai et 
al., 2004), social stigmatisation (Bai et al., 2004; Koh et al.,  2005), burnout  (Maunder  
et al., 2006) and trauma (Styra et al., 2008). 
1.7.2 Faster, further and with more repercussions: The COVID-19 pandemic. 
COVID-19 disease, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is regarded as the first 
pandemic in a time of true globalisation (Yacoub & El-Zomor, 2020). Declared as a 
worldwide pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020 (WHO, 2020a), the COVID-19 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
pandemic has placed strain on many countries, exposing public health gaps and 
perpetuating inequities (Lal et al., 2020). 
1.7.3 ICUs. 
ICUs, also known as critical care (CC) or intensive treatment units (ITUs) 
are wards within hospitals that provide specialist treatment  for critically ill patients. 
They emerged as a speciality in Copenhagen in 1952 which allowed the most unwell 
patients to be separated to allow for intense nursing support (Carter & Notter, 2020). 
Globally, the number of ICU beds per million population  varies significantly,  with 292 
in Germany to one in Uganda (Schell et al., 2018). Patients may be treated in an ICU 
to support recovery following surgery if they are having difficulties with one or more 
organs, or if there is a high  risk of  medical complications (NHS, 2019).  These 
patients often require close monitoring and support for vital physiological functions. 
ICU teams encompass a diverse range of highly skilled specialist professionals 
(Kings Fund, 2020a), including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, surgeons, clinical 
pharmacists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, and 
psychologists. Despite the reward of helping unwell people recover (Alameddine et 
al., 2009), ICU work brings many challenges including facing complex and novel 
situations, critical decisions related to patient mortality, and ethical dilemmas within 
time-critical circumstances (Laurent et al., 2017). 
1.7.4 The role of the ICU nurse. 
According to the World Federation of Critical Care Nurses (2019), an ICU nurse is 
a 'registered practitioner who enhances the delivery of comprehensive  patient  care, 
for acutely ill patients who require complex interventions in a highly technical 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
environment. ICU nursing is a highly specialised area of nursing requiring additional 
training beyond a nursing qualification (Credland, 2020) and an understanding of the 
complex needs of each patient (Carter & Notter, 2020). Typically nursed on a one to 
ratio, although sometimes greater (Williams et al., 2006), nurses play a core and vital part 
in ICU care (Lord et al., 2021). 
1.7.5 Working in an ICU: The emotional toll. 
Outside of a pandemic, the challenges that come with ICU work has an emotional 
impact on nurses (Mealer et al., 2007). It is perhaps not surprising that quantitative 
studies have highlighted that ICU nurses report high levels of burnout (Poncet et al. 
2007) and reported PTSD when compared with general nurses (Mealer et al., 2007). 
This has both a personal cost to the individual, and an organisational cost (Intensive 
Care Unit Society, 2020). 
1.7.6 Existing ICU nursing shortages. 
The most challenging element in the provision of safe and high-quality  ICU 
services internationally is the workforce (Williams  et al., 2015). There have long  
been a shortage of nursing staff in the NHS (Finlayson et al., 2002; Meadows et al., 
2000). In 2018, one in 10 nursing posts across the NHS nursing workforce in England 
remained unfilled (Kings Fund, 2021). It is well documented that the recruitment and 
retention of ICU nurses is a difficulty. Factors include further training  requirements 
due to technology advancements (Cortese, 2012), working conditions (Stone et al., 
2006), work pressure (van Dam et al., 2013), traumatic experiences  (Khan et al., 
2018) and seeking out jobs which are less stressful (Hussain et al., 2012). Staff 
shortages of NHS ICU nurses have a negative impact on the wellbeing of nurses, and 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
the subsequent standards of care they deliver (Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, 
2018). Ulrich et al. (2010) state that supporting the retention of nurses is preferable, 
due to the costs and resources involved in recruitment. 
1.7.7 The COVID-19 pandemic and ICUs. 
At the time of writing, it is understood that current variants of the COVID-19 virus 
mostly cause mild to moderate illness in otherwise healthy individuals (WHO, 2021). 
However, in the UK, approximately two-thirds of patients who required ICU treatment 
were given mechanical ventilatory support within 24 hours of admission (Mahase, 
2020). A meta-analysis of international studies reported that from the start of the 
pandemic until 31 May 2020 the mortality rate for ICU patients with COVID-19 was 
41.6 percent (Armstrong et al., 2020). 
Although UK ICU teams often face complex and novel situations, the COVID-19 
crisis has presented the greatest challenge to date (Carter & Notter, 2020). In early 
2020, existing ICU staffing models were deemed unsustainable given the increased 
demand posed by COVID-related illness (Kings Fund, 2020a), therefore, staffing 
models were adapted. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) (2021a) highlights  that 
this included the upskilling and redeployment of non-ICU nurses and HCWs with 
transferrable skills into ICUs. Nurse-to-patient ratios were also temporarily changed 
from one-to-one to one-to-six (Kings  Fund,  2020a).  As Kherbache  et al. (2021) 
state, this left many nurses practising on the edge of or beyond their competencies. 
Further, an Austrian survey-based study (Hoedl et al., 2020) of nurses reported a 
significant association between nurses working hours  and their  reported  stress 
levels. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Nurses have been faced with many challenges during the COVID-19 (Lord et al., 
2021). Research has highlighted that nurses who work in high-risk contexts such as 
ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported high levels of psychological distress 
(Sayilan et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020).  It has also  been  proposed  that the 
challenges nurses encounter in the current pandemic include work long  hours  and 
high workload (Morgantini et al., 2020), challenges of wearing PPE (Kisely  et al., 
2020), inadequate PPE (Hignett et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 
2020), and the discrepancy between patient needs and ability to meet those needs 
(Greenberg et al., 2020). As nurses have more frequent and longer patient contact 
time, they themselves have greater potential exposure to COVID-19 pandemic 
(Bowdle & Munoz-Price, 2020), therefore fears of becoming infected and then 
infecting others are also reported to be a significant source of distress (Kang et al., 
2020; McConnell, 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). Further, a 
qualitative  study based  in Ireland (Feeley et al., 2020) that explored experiences of 
paediatric and adult ICU staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, discussed that 
uncertainty around  the trajectory  of the pandemic, and not knowing when normality 
will resume, is also a source of distress. 
The role of ICU nurses at the recruiting hospital site for this study includes 
management of medication, ventilation, cardiovascular and renal support, attending  
to personal care, communicating with family and friends of the patient via telephone 
call and videocalls, end of life care and supporting redeployed nurses. 
Manoeuvring patients into a proned position, where patients lie on their front to 
improve the patients blood oxygen levels - and therefore survival - also became a 
standard of care during the pandemic (Koeckerling et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2020). 
Although this has been a well-known treatment for acute respiratory distress 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
syndrome for decades (Paul et al., 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp 
increase in patients requiring proning (Sarma & Calfee, 2020). The intervention is 
labour intensive, requiring five to seven members of staff (Royal College of Nursing 
Magazines, 2021). A literature review has highlighted that proning patients can place 
staff at risk of both musculoskeletal injury and greater exposure to the virus 
(Wiggerman et al., 2020). As the minimum suggested duration of prone position is 12 
hours a day (Ghelichkhani & Esmaeili, 2020), it can become difficult to perform usual 
nursing care, which can lead to patients developing pressure sores (Moore et al., 
2020), facial bruising and swelling (Ghelichkhani & Esmaeili, 2020). It is also known 
that wearing full PPE makes the ability to prone a patient  increasingly  difficult 
(Houston et al., 2020). At the time of writing, there appears  to be little  to no literature 
on the emotional impact on nursing when caring for patient who is in a faced down 
(prone) position. 
The pressures on NHS nurses will continue long after the pandemic has ended. 
(Carr et al., 2021; Bhangu et al., 2020; NHS, 2021). As of February 2021, there has 
been a 153-fold increase of patients who are waiting more than a year for treatment 
within the NHS, compared to November 2019 (Carr et al., 2021). Recently, the NHS 
(2021) announced an increased 160 million to support the backlog of non-COVID- 
19 care. 
1.7.8 PPE. 
At the time of this research, the COVID-19 virus is understood to be transmitted 
through close contact, respiratory droplets, in poorly ventilated indoor settings, and 
through contaminated surfaces (WHO, 2020b). Close contact with infectious 
patients, along with the addition of respiratory droplet transmission during 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
procedures, lead to HCWs being at an increased and repeated risk of infection 
(Carter & Notter, 2020). Wearing PPE became essential for all HCWs during the 
pandemic (WHO, 2020c). It is recommended that HCWs wear masks, gloves, 
gowns, goggles, and visors when treating a patient with known or suspected of 
COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) 
In a qualitative, UK-based study (Hoernke et al., 2021), some HCWs who treated 
COVID-19 positive patients, reported inadequate PPE supplies, exhaustion, and a 
detrimental impact on communication impacted on stress. Hoernke et al. (2021) also 
noted that due to the gaps in PPE training and guidance, HCWs developed their own 
informal ways of sharing information, trained  each other,  and bought  their own PPE. 
It was also discussed that breaks were often not taken due to high workload and guilt 
over wasting PPE (Hoernke et a., 2021). Other studies report that PPE can impact 
breathlessness and dizziness (Cui et al., 2020), reduce work efficiency (Cui et al. 
2020),  and impacts communication with patients  (Fernndez-Castillo  et al., 2021; 
Goh et al., 2020). 
1.7.9 COVID-19 guidance on wellbeing needs for HCWs. 
In March 2020, the British Psychological Society (BPS) COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing 
Group (2020) developed guidance, adapted from an NHS England and NHS 
Improvement document (Wallbank, n.d.) for managers and leaders when considering 
the wellbeing needs of HCWs during the pandemic. This guidance proposes three 
psychological response phases (preparation stage, active phase, and recovery 
phase), although it is acknowledged that these stages may not be sequential. The first 
phase, the preparation phase involves anticipatory anxiety and feelings of 
unpreparedness. Within the active phase are two subphases. The first, heroics and 
surge to 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
solution, includes teamwork, rising to the challenge, witnessing  things  not seen 
before, and trying to adapt quickly. The proposed second aspect of the active phase, 
is disillusionment and exhaustion - the period of highest psychological risk. This 
component proposes that this is where HCWs may experience sudden  exhaustion 
and perceive that their wellbeing is not a priority. It is at this point that moral distress 
(discussed later) may become a risk. The final phase, the recovery phase  is 
proposed to be where HCWs may have time to reflect and may experience post- 
traumatic growth (PTG) (discussed later). Here, it is proposed that some HCWs may 
experience difficult emotions such as shame or guilt and dissonance with prevalent 
narratives such as the HCWs as heroes narrative (BPS COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing 
Group, 2020). 
1.8 Overview of Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks 
1.8.1 Conceptual  frameworks for occupational stress. 
The demand-control-support (DCS) model (Karasek & Theorell, 1990) has been 
influential regarding research in occupational stress. It asserts that wellbeing is low 
when workers are faced with high work demands and low control over their work. A 
qualitative study on ICU staff during the COVID-19 pandemic (Feeley et al., 2020), 
discuss that high workload and low control was highest in staff redeployed to ICU, 
and more junior ICU staff. 
A conceptual criticism of the DCS model is its oversimplicity (Bakker et al., 2010) 
and that it omits important factors such as the role of social support from colleagues 
or managers (Johnson & Hall, 1988). The model also appears to focus on workload 
as the main contributor to stress, rather than factors that may come into play in a 
pandemic such as compassion fatigue, uncertainty, or perceived threat of infection. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Therefore, although the DCS model is likely to be useful for the current study, where 
nurses have high workloads and demands, it may not capture a range  of other 
factors. 
In response to the criticisms of the DCS above, the job demands-resources (JD- 
R) model was developed (Demerouti et al., 2001). This model suggests that work 
stress is a response to the imbalance between the individuals demands and their 
resource to meet these demands (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; 2017). Demands are 
defined as aspects of work that can drain energy such as workload, complex tasks, 
emotionally demanding conversations, and conflict. Resources may include aspects 
such as social support, optimism, control, and positive feedback (Schaufeli, 2017). 
The model proposes that when demands are persistently high and not compensated 
by the motivational impact of resources, physical and psychological fatigue,  poorer 
job satisfaction, and poor job performance occur (Cho et al., 2020). 
Frequently applied in healthcare settings (Britt et al., 2021), the JD-R model has 
been used to explore demands and stress in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
particularly in the context of novel demands  and reduced resources.  HCWs 
emotional wellbeing is proposed to be impacted by an imbalance of increased novel 
demands (both work and personal) and reduced resources (Britt et al., 2021). The 
authors also state that during this pandemic, HCWs have been working long  hours 
and personal resources are not available as they usually are, such as support from 
friends and family (Britt et al., 2021). 
The person-environment fit (P-E fit) model (Caplan, 1987) is similar to the JD-R 
model, but asserts a more reciprocal relationship between an individual and their 
environment. It highlights that workers individual characteristics, such as personality, 
abilities, and values need to be matched with their job and work context for wellbeing 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
(Edwards & Cooper, 2013). The dissonance between these factors will subsequently 
impact ones physical and psychological wellbeing. Applying this model to the current 
pandemic, Feeley  et al. (2020)  suggested  that this  imbalance was particularly 
reported in HCWs who were redeployed to ICUs. 
1.8.2 Perceived threat of infection. 
In addition to resources and demands, it is documented that for HCWs, perceived 
threat of infection predicts emotional distress during infectious outbreaks. A 
questionnaire-based study during the SARS pandemic  in Hong Kong (Tam et al., 
2004)  proposed  that 70 percent of HCWs reported  that the most distressing  aspect 
of working during SARS was the fear of becoming infected, rather than direct 
exposure to infected patients. This was hampered by HCWs reported perception of 
having poor physical health, and therefore increased perceived vulnerability (Tam et 
al., 2020). 
This was also discussed by Garca and Calvo (2021), notably that the perceived 
threat of contracting COVID-19, as measured quantitatively,  along  with high 
workload, contributed to reported burnout in nurses. Puci et al. (2020) conducted a 
web-based quantitative survey exploring Italian HCWs worries and risk perception 
during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians and nurses reported 
significantly higher perceived risk compared to other HCWs, due to frequent and 
longer patient  contact time. Hoernke (2021)  also delineates  that  actual and 
perceived shortages of PPE contributed to HCWs stress. Furthermore, Ganz et al. 
(2019) concluded from a quantitative  questionnaire  study  that  that  perceived threat 
of infection may give rise to an inherent tension of morals, such as a conflict between 
providing patient care or increased risk of contracting the virus. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
For many HCWs, this perceived threat became a reality. Studies report that 
HCWs who worked during the current pandemic were at increased risk of infection 
compared with the general community, as reported on self -reported data from 
COVID-19 testing or a prediction of infection based on symptoms (Nguyen et al., 
2020). 
1.8.3 Moral distress. 
Existing, pre-pandemic research proposes that HCWs most likely to experience 
moral distress are those who work in ICUs, palliative  care units  and emergency 
wards (Dodek et al., 2016; Whitehead et al., 2015). This can be defined  as distress 
that occurs from actions, or lack of them, which violates ones ethical code and can 
contribute to emotions such as depression,  guilt,  shame,  and anger (Litz  et al., 
2009). Pre-pandemic, HCWs usually act within their professional standards (Nursing 
and Midwifery Council, n.d) which includes to protect anyone you have management 
responsibility for from any harm. Yet, with the arrival of the pandemic, and the high 
work load and reduced resources, this was required to shift (Kherbache et al., 2021). 
In a pandemic context, nurses may find themselves in situations where they do 
not have adequate experience or training to treat the patient (Greenberg, 2020; 
Watson et al., 2020) or if normative expectations are breached due to systemic 
constraints such as inadequate supplies  of PPE (Shale,  2020). Kok et al. (2020) 
state that due to the demand placed on ICUs in the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU staff 
reported disorientation, worry, and at times, feeling unable to help the patients and 
their families. Kherbache et al. (2021) propose that when HCWs experience moral 
distress, this can undermine ethical integrity, contributing to poorer job satisfaction 
and quality of patient care. Burston and Tucket (2012) propose internal factors, site 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
factors and external factors contribute to moral distress.  Cacchione (2020) applied 
this to HCWs in the COVID-19 pandemic, proposing that internal factors include role 
perception, perceived skill level to manage a pandemic, and ability to care for each 
other. Site factors involve adequate PPE supplies and medical equipment, whilst 
broader external factors include national  policies.  Therefore,  as a result  of the 
tension between ones professional duty of care to patients and personal duties of 
protecting their own health also appears  to contribute  to moral distress  (Kherbache 
et al., 2021; Stovall et al., 2020). An Australian based study (Lord et al., 2021) report 
that 90 percent of ICU nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their 
family. This distress is reported to intensify when working in health systems with 
frequently changing guidelines (Cacchione, 2020) and those unfamiliar to working in 
conditions of severely limited resources (Kherbache et al., 2021). 
1.8.4 Growth, meaning-making, and culturally preferred stories. 
Post-traumatic growth (PTG) (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1995) is a concept that 
suggests that struggles  with highly  challenging  life events can lead to positive 
change. This may include an increased appreciation for life, emotional resilience, 
deepened spirituality, a change in life priorities, and greater connection with others 
(Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1995; 2004). McAdams (1993) discusses how trauma offers 
opportunities for individuals to modify their narrative identities in positive  ways. It is 
also thought that traumatic responses and PTG are independent of each other  and 
can co-exist (Ragger et al., 2019). However, similar to the construct of PTSD, it can 
be argued that PTG also avoids context (Zur, 1996). A meta-analysis by Wu et al. 
(2019) reported  that approximately  50 percent of individuals  who experienced 
trauma experience some PTG. Regarding the impact of SARS on HCWs, 86 percent 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
reported a new appreciation for the meaning and importance of their profession 
(Tam et al., 2004). 
However, when people relate the stories or journeys of their experiences over 
time, particularly those that may include traumatic experiences, there are social 
conventions and imperatives that come into play, affecting what can acceptably be 
told, and how. For example, in relating stories  of personal  experience  of illness, 
Frank (1995), writing in the United States, notes cultural expectations for certain 
forms of story. Culturally preferred narratives are when one presents themselves as 
fully recovered from their experience of illness (a narrative of restitution) or of the 
quest, which is also similar to PTG (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1995). Frank also notes 
that chaotic narratives  which highlight the unpredictability and uncontrollability of 
traumatic events  are emotionally hard and uncomfortable for listeners to hear. It is 
argued that there may be social pressure on people to tell stories of quest or PTG 
rather than leaving listeners with the burden of knowing that life  a pandemic, for 
example  is simply cruel, unpredictable, and unresolvable. It is also of interest that 
cultural expectations may vary over time and place, something particularly  pertinent 
to a global pandemic. 
1.8.5 The COVID-19 Pandemic and Wartime Language 
Going to war or going to work? 
Naughton-Doe (2020) 
Wartime language has remained a constant linguistic tool throughout the COVID- 
19 pandemic: the virus as an enemy, and HCWs as heroes on the front line. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Whilst this rhetoric may have a certain appeal  in that it may mobilise a fight against 
a common threat (Chiang and Duann, 2007) and provide hope of conquering the 
enemy (Jetly et al., 2020), it may have other consequences (Brencio, 2020). War 
language may invite questions regarding  the impact it can have on HCWs' 
perception: that they must keep going, stay strong, keep their emotions at bay  
which can increase pressure further (Brencio, 2020). Freshwater (2020), a mental 
health nurse and Chair of the RCN Mental Health Forum, in a commentary for the 
Nursing Standard, states that the COVID-19 response calls for collaboration, not 
confrontation. 
The hero narrative appeared  to be  endorsed  through  the Clap for Carers was 
later renamed to Clap for Heroes to include all keyworkers (BBC News, 2021a). The 
public stood on their doorsteps to applaud and show appreciation to keyworkers from 
March to May 2020 (McAllister et al., 2020). 
1.9 Summary 
At the time of writing, as the pandemic continues globally, the COVID-19 
pandemic marks the worst international health crisis for a century (Singer,  2020). 
ICU nurses are faced with many challenges (Lord et al., 2021), which sits against a 
backdrop of the already known stress of such work (Mealer et al., 2007). 
While there has been a recent growth in literature into the COVID-19 pandemic, 
there is a need to take stock and critically appraise current understanding of the 
experiences of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, the 
following chapter explored the existing literature on this topic. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Chapter Two: Systematic Literature Review 
2.1 Chapter Overview 
This chapter outlines how I systematically identified, synthesised, and critically 
reviewed the relevant literature.  The systematic  review aimed to answer the 
question what is known about the experiences of nurses working in ICUs during the 
COVID-19 pandemic?. A separate quality evaluation of the literature will follow, 
before presenting the rationale for the current research. 
2.2 Literature Search Strategy 
This systematic review was first undertaken  in July 2020 and  then, due to the 
pace of the literature published on the topic during the pandemic, updated in January 
2021. In July 2020, the research was largely quantitative in design. By January 2021, 
the literature, including qualitative studies,  was becoming increasingly  vast. At the 
time of writing, the area continues to rapidly  evolve, and it is acknowledged  that 
further reviews will be needed over the coming years. 
Databases PubMed, Scopus, Internurse,  and Google  Scholar  were used. This 
first ranged from a generic search using key terms, in addition to more specific 
searches including variations on COVID-19, nurse, psychological impact and 
qualitative. Boolean operators  (AND, OR) were used and  relevant search terms 
were truncated (*) to ensure the inclusion of variations  on specific words (Table  1). 
As the volume of the published literature grew, it became feasible to focus in on 
qualitative literature involving nurses, rather than HCWs generally. To further narrow 
down the results, I also limited studies to those only qualitative in design in order to 
capture the lived experience and limited papers to those published in 2020 onwards. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
The search term intensive care unit was removed because this narrowed down 
results too far. 
In total, 1770 papers were initially identified. Using the search strategy detailed in 
Table 1 and the inclusion  in and exclusion  criteria in Table 2, this was narrowed 
down to 12 papers for full text review and critical evaluation. Figure 1 shows the 
process of study selection. Table 3 shows a summary of the results.

2.3 Systematic Literature Review: Critical Evaluation 
Below, each study will be discussed in turn to explore the question: What is 
known about the experiences of nurses treating patients with COVID-19 disease? 
Cui et al (2020) interviewed nurses  who voluntarily  travelled  to Hubei, the 
Chinese province which includes Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic  and  the 
focus of national and  international  attention.  The authors  noted five themes in 
nurses accounts (motivations; challenges faced; psychological experiences, 
psychological adjustments; personal and professional  growth).  Motivations involved 
a professional commitment and responsibility prompted by media publicity. The 
authors reported that nurses described an awareness of the value of their role which 
they reportedly integrated this into a stronger professional identity. The authors 
proposed that this highlighted the strong sense of duty and dedication. 
Similarly, Zhang et al. (2020) explored the experiences of nurses who voluntarily 
travelled to Wuhan, China. Focusing on the psychological change processes of 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
nurses, they argued that nurses  experienced  three stages  in coping with their 
work (ambivalence; emotional exhaustion; energy renewal) which, they proposed, 
occurred after working in the isolation unit for a month. Similar to Cui et al. (2020), 
Zhang et al. (2020) discuss  how  nationalism  during  the pandemic  played a key part 
in nurses sense of duty and responsibility. However, it appears that there was more 
cognitive dissonance for the nurses, and some reported  this to be an obligation 
(Zhang et al., 2020). They reported feeling excitement and pride alongside fear, 
reportedly due to the contagious nature of the virus and the dearth of knowledge. It is 
interesting to consider that it may be that those with less  nursing  experience  may 
have played a part in this ambivalence, as 65.2 percent of the participants  had 
between two to five years experience (Zhang et al., 2020).  By contrast,  in the study 
by Cui et al. (2020), 33 percent of nurses had six to 10 years experience, whilst 
another 33 percent had 11 to 15 years experience. Although the findings in the 
study by Zhang et al. (2020) are presented in three distinct categories, it may not 
capture possible nuances within the data. However, given the paucity of participant 
quotations presented in the paper, this is hard to decipher. Further, Chinese cultural 
values of family and community and collectivism may have also played a part in the 
reported sense of duty and responsibility, which may not be generalisable to other 
countries. 
A sense of duty was also reported strongly in the South Korean study  (Lee & Lee., 
2020), however, similar to Zhang et al. (2020),  this was also  reported  as an 
obligation and an unavoidable duty. So too, both Lee and Lee (2020) and Zhang  et 
al. (2020) also note  that nurses  reported  fear, particularly  at the start of the 
pandemic. Lee  and Lee (2020) reported  that  this stemmed from a lack of PPE 
training and knowledge about the route of transmission. Zhang et al. (2020), 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
however, discussed that the nurses worried about their familys safety, which was 
intensified by HCWs dying from COVID-19. Although the nurses reported struggles, 
they also reported positive changes when they reflected on the meaning of their 
experience (Lee & Lee, 2020). This alludes to the idea that PTG can occur when 
faced with challenges  during a pandemic. It is of note that Lee and Lee  (2020) 
heavily use wartime language in the several themes (pushed onto the battlefield 
without any preparation; struggling on the frontline; unexpectedly long war). This is 
disproportionate to the amount of war language apparent in the participant excerpts. 
The Singapore-based project (Goh et al., 2020) discussed three  themes 
(challenging moments; professional role; support for nurses). For some nurses in this 
sample, the reported sense of duty was stronger in that they felt a responsibility to 
circulate correct COVID-19 information to the public, as well as publicly adhering to 
preventative measures. Across the papers, the reported sense of duty  appears  to 
have difference nuances, from a pride and a professional commitment (Cui et al., 
2020; Goh et al., 2020), to an obligation (Lee & Lee, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The 
authors refer to self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), which is concerned 
with the motivation contributing to an individuals  decision.  Goh et  al.  (2020)  state 
that nurses are intrinsically  rather than extrinsically  motivated to explain  why they 
may have felt pride in contributing to the pandemic. Viewing nurses experiences 
through this framework, however, may be over-simplistic. Indeed, relying on the 
assumption that nurses are intrinsically motivated could be problematic particularly in 
the context of nurses who have been working in high-risk situations, long working 
hours, and with relatively low pay. It also ignores the role of broader military and hero 
discourses. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Tan et al. (2020) collected their data from nurses working in one of the main 
COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan. They  reported  that difficulties 
encountered by nurses included heavy workload and pressure, fear and anxiety, 
helplessness and frustration, shortage  of staff and PPE, and  lack of knowledge 
about COVID-19. Conducted between January to February 2020 at the epicentre of 
the pandemic, these conclusions are perhaps unsurprising. The authors  also 
explored reports of positive experiences (as did Zhang et al. 2020) and noted that 
nurses reported an improved sense of responsibility and professional identity. 
Notably, the authors framed the theme of most nurses did not complain as 
a positive professional value, which may be perceived differently in other cultures. 
Galehdar et al.s (2020) Iran-based study specifically explored nurses 
psychological distress. This contrasts with the other reviewed studies which contain 
aspects of positive experiences and growth, although to different degrees. There are 
different ways to view this. The absence of reported positive growth may be a 
reflection of their methodology (this was not a question asked in the interview). 
Therefore, this does not consider whether growth and distress can co-exist (Ragger 
et al., 2019). It is also important to consider that perhaps by the nurses not having 
been asked about growth, there may have been less  of a social pressure  for this 
type of talk (Frank, 1995). 
Galehdar et al. (2020) also discuss the multidimensional construct of death 
anxiety, including not feeling prepared to communicate with dying patients and their 
families and observing the death of patients. Nurses reported  that  many patients 
may have contracted COVID-19, despite adherence to preventative measures, and 
that patients were victims of others carelessness and authorities poor 
decisions. This narrative reportedly led to the death of patients being even more 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
difficult for the nurses, which perhaps reflected nurses compassion towards patients, 
but also how they may not have felt supported by the authorities and the public. This 
contrasts with Lee and Lees (2020) findings, who noted that some nurses lacked 
sympathy for patients and did  not  want  to understand  the patients  situation 
because they had not followed the basic prevention. Both these aspects of these 
studies (Galehdar et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020) may speak to a similar  point, 
regarding frustration at those not adhering to preventive measures to contain the 
spread of the virus. Another theme discussed by Galehdar et al. (2020) was fear of 
infecting the family. This is in line with conclusions from other reviewed studies  
(Sheng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). 
Similar to the other studies, Lapum et al. (2021),  described  that,  in Canada, 
nurses accounts were emotionally charged, with fear, uncertainty, helplessness, and 
anger prominent. However, Lapum et al. (2021) discuss how these emotional 
experiences are complex and enmeshed. The authors add an additional layer to the 
literature by discussing the agency of emotion and how this impacts nursing practice. 
For example, some nurses described how staff shortages,  exhaustion,  and the need 
to become task-orientated reduced capacity for empathy. Additionally, nurses found 
new ways to enhance the humanistic aspects of their role, resulting in a 
strengthened professional identity. This highlights the importance of identity and self - 
concept, especially in times of increased and novel work demands. However, the 
authors lack of transparency in the paper, including the vague description of their 
methodology and analysis, means that the findings should be viewed cautiously. 
Sheng et al. (2020) add a new angle to the literature as they specifically focus on 
exploring the professional identity of nurses who volunteered to work in hospitals in 
Wuhan. Alongside themes such as exhaustion and fear and perceived 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
incompetence, they also discuss the  theme of unexpected  professional 
benefits. Within this, nurses described the experience as a learning opportunity, 
specifically in that they developed skills in intensive care of infectious diseases, 
wearing PPE, and improved communication. The authors also discuss social identity 
theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986), where they state that nurses identities are tied to 
societal images and are strengthened  when nurses  perceive they  are being 
portrayed positively, for example, such as nurses as heroes and soldiers. 
Sheng et al. (2020) also report feelings of unfairness. As nurses were required to 
have closer and longer patient contact compared with other staff, there was a greater 
risk of infection. This was reported to be hampered by nurses medical colleagues 
being given a greater financial reward, despite nurses having increased and longer 
patient contact time. Reportedly, the nurses felt their contributions went 
unrecognised by the hospital and wider society. This appears to be one of the few 
studies, along with Jia et al. (2021), to discuss inequality  and unfairness  perceived 
by nurses. It appears that nurses perception of how they were perceived by society 
plays a core part in their experiences and offers suggestions for mangers on 
organisational justice. This offers an alternative view to some of the other studies, 
where although nurses reported fear (Cui et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020; Tan et al., 
2020), frustration and unfairness were not discussed. This may also  tie into the 
strong sense of professional duty and responsibility reported by Cui et al. (2020). 
Jia et al. (2021), another Chinese study, took a different approach and focused on 
exploring nurses encounters with ethical challenges. Due to the limited medical 
resources in Wuhan, nurses were required to neglect patient rights at times. Notably, 
the nurses reported that patients did not participate in their plan for treatment (due to 
being too unwell to talk and not being allowed because of pressures the Unit was 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
under). The nurses also reported feeling distressed if patients were not receiving a 
good standard of care, particularly if other staff were slow to support patients  in order 
to avoid contracting the virus from the patient. There are several similarities between 
Jia et al. (2021) and Sheng et al. (2020)  in terms of their  conclusions.  Both discuss 
the experience leading to a positive impact on professional identity and the 
development of nursing and management skills. 
Sun et al. (2020) discussed how despite the challenges, growth emerged under 
pressure - a key finding reported in other studies (Cui et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2021; 
Lapum et al., 2021; Lee & Lee, 2020; Sheng et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Zhang et 
al., 2020). Unlike these other studies, however, Sun et al. (2020) propose  that 
positive emotions can co-exist alongside distress, which fits the literature on PTG 
(Ragger et al., 2019). By contrast, Zhang et al. (2020) propose a 'change process, 
although this is arguably rigid. The exception is Lapum et al. (2021), who suggested 
emotions are enmeshed. This type of framework, rather than a stepwise, sequential 
model is more likely to capture the complexity of human emotion. 
Kackin et al. (2020) also highlighted the psychological and social  impact on 
nurses and working conditions. They propose that nurses have robust coping 
strategies existing before the pandemic. These strategies include normalisation, 
refusing to dwell on experiences, avoidance, expression of feelings, and distraction. 
Coping strategies were also discussed by Sun et al. (2020) where the  nurses 
reported using journaling, deep breathing, and mindfulness practice. Aspects of 
coping strategies were discussed in the other studies. This included an appreciation 
from patients and concerns from family/friends (Lee & Lee, 2020), containing and 
releasing emotions (Lapum et al., 2021),  social support,  counselling,  and diary 
writing (Cui et al., 2020) and planning, and staying focused (Jia et al., 2021). 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Fernndez-Castillo et al. (2021), another Spanish study, was the only reviewed 
study to discuss the role of the media. Nurses reported that it was difficult to 
disconnect which led to feeling a lack of control. This highlights the implications of a 
pandemic in a world where the internet and media are rife. It also points to how 
misinformation and information overload can impact experiences. 
Fernndez-Castillo et al. (2021) also noted that ICU nurses who worked with 
redeployed nurses reported increased levels of anxiety - a finding not noted in the 
other reviewed studies.  A key theme that also  sets  this study  apart is the theme 
of resources management and safety which discusses the management of the 
correct provision of PPE, adequate staffing and nurse-to-patient ratios. This study 
takes a broader, more systemic lens when considering factors contributing to 
distress and burnout in nurses, which offers implications for leaders within healthcare 
systems. 
Although not a research question for any of the studies, and therefore not a focus, 
many allude to the nurses identities. For example, across the studies the nurses 
appeared to construct identities of responsible, professional nurses with a duty to 
work during the pandemic (Cui et al., 2020; Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020;  Sun 
et al, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Despite this, the studies lack a fuller exploration of 
these identities. 
2.4 Quality evaluation 
Quality evaluation tools appraise the methodological  quality  and  rigour  of 
research (Elliott et al., 1999; Hammersley, 2008). I selected the guidelines set out by 
Tracy (2010) because it is an established quality standard that expands on previous 
work. It is also applicable to many forms of qualitative research. To reflect a more 
nuanced 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
rating scale, rather than a binary yes and no approach, I employed a three-tiered 
rating system of criteria met, criteria not met or partially met. Studies were given a 
high rating if they met five or more of the criteria and a low  rating  if they  met four 
or less (Appendix A). 
Worthy topic: This refers to whether  the research is novel,  timely, significant, 
and interesting. All the papers met this, which is perhaps unsurprising given that the 
topic is so current. Studies were novel and interesting based  on the country the 
project was based,  the methodology  employed,  the date it was conducted, or taking 
a specific angle  in terms of their aims. Specifically, some Chinese  studies 
interviewed nurses who volunteered to travel to Hubei (Cui et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 
2020; Tan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Some studies were conducted early on in 
the pandemic, such as January to February 2020 (Tan et al., 2002) and April to May 
2020 (Cui et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2020), however, explicitly focused on the 
psychological change process nurses go through, whilst Jia et al. (2021) explored 
specifically ethical challenges. 
Rich rigour: Rigorous research relates to appropriate participants, methodology, 
and analysis. Studies had poor  rigour  if they  did not state  the participant 
demographic details, if interviews were short in length, if the interview format was 
inappropriate, vague description of the recruitment strategy  or did not use field notes 
or a lack of transparency about the methodology (Cui et al., 2020; Galehdar et al, 
2020; Lapum et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020). Some studies  were deemed to have 
sound rigour (Goh et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2021; Kackin et al., 2020; Lee and  Lee., 
2020; Sheng et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020 & Zhang et al., 2020). Most of the papers 
provided much information about their sample, including the nurses work position, 
work experience, and qualifications. Goh et al (2020) went further and recorded 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
ethnicity and religion (Goh et al., 2020). However, these details were often not 
referred back to in the context of the findings. 
Sincerity: Researchers should state their epistemological and theoretical 
orientation to the topic, and be reflexive throughout. None of the papers shared their 
epistemology. However, two papers met this criterion as they stated their values, 
beliefs, and thoughts throughout (Goh et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 2020). Fernndez- 
Castillo et al. (2021) did not provide details of the research team and what they may 
have brought to the research, nor did they show any hint of reflexivity. Kackin et al. 
(2020) attempted to show sincerity by providing  details  about  the research team 
such as their training and qualifications, however, there was limited evidence of 
reflexivity. 
Credibility: Research high in credibility  will include triangulation,  member 
checking with participants, and offers rich detail within the paper. All but two of the 
studies (Cui et al., 2020; Lapum et al., 2021) meet this. No credibility checks were 
employed by Lapum et al. (2021), and the authors also do not state their 
epistemological or theoretical lens, it is difficult to know whether this  is deliberate  or 
not (for example, if member checking does not fit with their epistemology). Lapum et 
al. (2021) provided only a brief description of their methodology with only  two 
examples of interview questions. Cui et al. (2020) used member checking, but details 
on this are vague. There were no details on how a consensus was reached in the 
analysis or indeed how the interview  guide  was developed  or concrete details  on 
how the data was analysed. Some papers stated how they used established quality 
criteria such as that by Lincoln and Guba (1985) (Galehdar et al. 2020; Kackin et al., 
2020; Lee & Lee, 2020). Other studies developed their interview  guide by consulting 
the literature and experts (Sun et al., 2020). 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Resonance: This  takes into account whether the research  impacts the reader, 
and how it is presented.  It also  considers  generalisability,  although  research 
adopting a social constructionist lens - which views knowledge as dependent on 
context - would not seek to easily generalise to other populations. Given none of the 
papers shared their epistemology,  this  is hard to assess.  Lapum  et al.  (2021)  had 
low resonance as it lacked details such as the  date for when the study  was 
conducted, leaving the reader unclear as to at what point in the pandemic it was 
conducted, which is likely to heavily impact the data. However, Lapum et al. (2021) 
document the metaphors the participants used such as so the baggage  is, not only 
are you carrying whatever you had, but also trying to bottle it in which helps the 
reader resonate. Zhang et al. (2020) used language such as sacred mission without 
any critical evaluation, which may not resonate with readers. 
Significant contribution: This refers to the impact of the research, including 
theoretically, practically or methodologically. Nine of the  reviewed studies  met this 
(Cui et al., 2020; Galehdar et al., 2020;  Fernndez-Castillo  et al.,  2021; Jia et al., 
2021; Tan et al., 2020; Lapum et al., 2021;  Lee & Lee,  2020; Sheng et al., 2020; Sun 
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Tan et al.s (2020) study, conducted in January and 
February 2020, was one of the first qualitative studies to explore the experiences of 
nurses who worked in Wuhan. Galehdar et al. (2020) refer to death anxiety and 
discussed how this may impact communication with patients reaching the end of life. 
However, the authors do not offer specific practical recommendations. Further, 
although brief, the authors discuss  their findings  to previous epidemics  and 
pandemics (Galehdar et al., 2020). Two studies partially met this criterion (Goh et al., 
2020; Kackin et al., 2020). The findings presented by Goh et al. (2020) are not new 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
perhaps in part due to the methodology employed, thematic analysis, which lacks in- 
depth exploration and does not explore patterns within accounts. 
Ethical: This considers whether the research has been conducted ethically. This 
component proved difficult to assess as many of the studies lacked details in this 
regard. Only two studies made specific reference to how they would manage 
potential participant distress (Sheng et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Sheng et al., 
(2020), however, stated that when the participant showed signs  of distress  they 
would pause or change the topic. More detail on this is needed, as this could be 
perceived as closing down emotion and therefore more distress. Sun et al. (2020) 
met this criterion; they discussed employing certain therapeutic techniques such as 
acceptance and active listening. Further, the interview had a large focus on coping 
strategies, and the topic is likely to not be problem-saturated. None of the papers 
discussed whether they gave participants contacts for further support following the 
interviews. 
Meaningful coherence: This assesses whether the study appropriately achieves 
its aims and whether  the paper is meaningfully  connected. Some papers  did not 
meet this if their sample lacked generalisability and therefore does not achieve its 
aims. Lee and Lee (2020) only interviewed those who only volunteered to care for 
patients with COVID-19 patients, and they also note that some of the nurses in the 
sample had extremely limited nursing experience in caring for patients with COVID- 
19. Galehdar et al. (2020) also did not meet this as some aspects of the discussion 
lack coherence with the findings, in addition to methodological limitations in having 
short telephone interviews. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
2.5 Rationale    
     Although the literature on experiences of nurses working during the COVID-
19 pandemic is already a rapidly evolving area, this review highlights the scarcity of 
research exploring how nurses construct their narratives,  particularly  within  a UK 
NHS context. There also appears to be a dearth of research  that explores situated 
and contextualised understandings of accounts, for example, the power of discourse  
on narratives  and identities. This is important  given that the COVID-19 is the first 
large scale crisis in over a century, and given the existing shortages of NHS nurses. 
Whilst several  of the reviewed studies  allude  to an impact of the professional 
identities of nurses, they did not explore how this was told. Furthermore, much of the 
literature employed inclusion criteria that nurses were required to have a minimum 
amount of experience working during the pandemic. The redeployment of nurses is 
a distinct feature of nursing during a pandemic; excluding redeployed nurses may 
miss important aspects of experiences. It is also important to note that many of the 
reviewed studies were rated low in the quality assessment and therefore care should 
be taken when inferring too much from the findings of these studies. These limitations 
in quality of these studies also provides a further rationale for the current project. In 
summary, the literature on how nurses construct their experiences and the self 
within local and broader socio-cultural contexts remains sparse. To meet this need, 
narrative inquiry is an appropriate methodology. 
2.6 Research Aims 
This study explores the following questions: 
1. How do NHS nurses construct their narratives of working in ICUs during the 
COVID-19 pandemic? 
2. What identities are constructed in their narratives? 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Chapter Three: Methodology 
3.1 Chapter Overview 
Within this chapter, I outline the design, procedure and how I addressed ethical 
considerations. I will close this chapter by outlining how I have ensured quality 
throughout, and maintained a reflexive position. 
3.2 Design 
This research is a cross-sectional study, using retrospective individual interviews. 
Employing narrative inquiry, it aimed to gain an in-depth, rich understanding of how 
nurses construct their experience of working in an ICU during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
3.2.1 So, why stories? 
We are born into a world of stories (Bruner, 2003; Fisher, 1984; Murray & Sools, 
2015). Stories are how we come to know our world and our place in it (Oliver, 1998; 
Squire, 2008). Attempts to understand experiences in social science took a narrative 
turn in the 1980s (Pinnegar & Daynes, 2007), which considered how events and 
identities are constructed within particular contexts, how they unfold over time (Caine 
et al., 2013), and the impact of certain versions of stories over others. As such, 
narrative inquiry considers stories as a tool for constructing meaning, ordering 
experience, and constructing reality in an ever-changing and often chaotic world 
(Bruner, 1986). 
Narrative inquiry allows the researcher to make sense of stories at various levels, 
including structurally, contextually and performatively (Esin et al., 2014). Narrative 
also considers the multiple contexts, including the interview context itself (Wells, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
2011), and the broader social, historical, political, cultural and institutional contexts. 
These broader contexts often draw on wider societal  discourses  that inform 
narratives and the discursive resources available to the narrators. When a narrative 
can be told, or indeed whether it can be told at all, may relate to who is considered 
entitled to tell that story or whether it resists dominant societal discourses in some 
way (Bamberg & Andrews, 2004). For example, over the last century in Western 
culture, sharing stories of emotional distress would have resulted in different 
consequences at different times, which may have led to these being told in secret or 
silenced. 
Although there are some overlaps between narrative inquiry and other qualitative 
approaches, narratives preserve temporality and analyse individual accounts as a 
whole (Haydon & van der Riet, 2017; Riessman, 2008; 2010). This is useful with 
regards to considering transformation or change in stories  of adversity  (Squire, 
2008). 
A constructionist narrative analysis was used, which is consistent with the 
epistemological stance for the project. This views narratives as co-constructions, and 
recognises that individual identities are shaped through language. I also drew on 
aspects of discursive psychology to consider how identities may emerge from 
positioning in relation to societal discourses (Harr, 2012). 
It is important to briefly comment on the potential links with the term story and 
something being made up. Although the approach for this research views narratives 
as socially constructed, and therefore focuses of meaning over truth, this  is not to 
say stories are fictional accounts. 
3.2.2 Consultation. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Consultation can positively influence the research  at all stages. It offers 
opportunities  for feedback and advice on the design  of the study  (Morrow et al., 
2010) and can help inform methodological reflexivity (Treharne & Riggs, 2015). I was 
fortunate to have a senior matron at the hospital as the research consultant to the 
project. Consultation impacted the design from the outset, including recruitment, 
guidance on changing the interview guide and ways of managing potential emotional 
distress. 
3.3 Procedure 
3.3.1 Recruitment. 
I recruited nurses who worked in the ICU at specialist cardiothoracic  hospital 
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 4). Purposive sampling was employed, which 
is in line with the projects aims and methodological approach (Ames et al., 2019).

Inclusion 
criteria 
Aged 18 or above at the time of  
recruitment; 
Worked on the ICU at the hospital 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
This includes those who usually work 
in the ICU and those who were 
voluntarily redeployed from other 
hospital departments. 
A minimum length of time that 
participants needed to work in ICU 
during the pandemic for was not 
implemented, as the stories of those 
nurses who were unfamiliar with an 
ICU context is a unique feature of 
nursing during a pandemic.

Band 5 and 6 nurses 
The role of the Band 7 nurse involves 
a greater degree of responsibility, 
therefore only Band 5 and 6 nurses 
were recruited. 
Speaks sufficiently fluent English 
With narrative  inquirys emphasis on 
the nuances of language, and how this 
is both used and performed, it is not 
possible to complete interviews in 
languages other than English. This is 
not possible by my own limitations in 
only speaking English. This is also in 
line with the recommendations from 
Miczo (2003). 
Nurses must have access to a 
computer and internet access. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
Those with a significant history of 
mental health diff iculties. 
It was assumed that those who have 
been cleared by Occupational Health 
to work in an emotionally charged 
environment will not have existing 
significant emotional diff iculties. 
Low mood and anxiety will not be an 
exclusion criterion as these emotions 
are understandable and expected 
given the topic. 
Band 7 nurses  
There were three methods of recruitment led by the external supervisor for the 
project. The research consultant also advertised the study through email groups, 
WhatsApp groups, and displaying the participant information sheet in the ICU staff 
rooms. Recruitment was further supported by nursing managers from other 
departments in the hospital. 
3.3.2 Participants. 
Six nurses were recruited and interviewed, which is sufficient given the level of 
analysis involved in narrative inquiry (Wells, 2011). All participants who came 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
forward were female and there was a diversity of participants reported ethnic 
background (Table 5). The nurses ethnicities and age were assumed to be 
representative (gender is slightly less representative) of the nurses at the hospital. 
Changing or removing identifiable information was discussed with each of the 
participants. Whilst some details have been changed and removed for confidentiality 
purposes, some information has been kept in where it is important when 
understanding broader stories. Further communication with some of the nurses 
following the interviews was sought to clarify their consent for this, despite the risk of 
potentially identifying themselves.

3.4 Ethical Approval 
As recruitment took place through an NHS hospital, with NHS staff as 
participants, ethical approval was required from NHS Health Research Authority 
(HRA). IRAS project ID: 284812 (see Appendix B). 
The process of obtaining ethical approval involved considering solutions to 
anticipated ethical issues. Regarding NHS HRA ethics approval, for COVID-19 
related research, a fast-track system was in place. The approval, whereby the 
project was deemed ethically sound, was provided within several days. I received 
requests for five amendments and for further information to be provided (Appendix 
C-E). 
Following this, I sought research registration from the Hospital Trusts Research 
and Development (R&D) Department (Appendix F-G). Once this was approved, I 
requested full sponsorship from the University of Hertfordshires Ethics Board. 
Protocol number: LMS/PGT/UH/04269 (Appendix H-I) 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
3.4.1 Addressing ethical considerations. 
Ethical considerations were paramount to hold in mind through all stages of this 
research. These are informed consent, confidentiality, and potential participant 
distress. I also discuss the ethical issues that relate to conducting research during a 
pandemic. 
3.4.1.1 Informed consent. 
Informed consent is at the very core of ethical considerations in all psychological 
research. To assist the nurses in making an informed decision about participation, 
they were provided with the Participant Information Sheet (Appendix J), which 
provided clear and detailed information about the studys aims, what participation 
involves, potential risks, and confidentiality including its limits. It also stated that the 
interviews will be video and audio recorded in line with both the Universitys and 
Hospital Trusts policies. The research teams contact details were provided, if 
potential participants wished to seek further information. 
The nurses were also asked to complete the Expression of Interest  form 
(Appendix K). Once I received this, I added their details to a secure, confidential 
database where I checked that they met the inclusion criteria. Following this, they 
were emailed the Consent Form (Appendix L) to complete and return to me 
electronically before the interview. During the first part of the interview, I asked each 
the nurses whether they had any questions or concerns regarding  any  of the items 
on the Consent Form. 
3.4.1.2 Confidentiality. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Care was taken to ensure confidentiality and was maintained throughout  the 
process. At the end of each interview, I discussed with each participant which 
information they would like me to change or remove, for example, demographic  
details  or if they  had a unique role that could mean they may be easily identifiable.  
Participants  were invited to choose their own pseudonyms, which were used for 
sending the audio recording to an independent transcription company and in the write-
up of this thesis. Electronic data was kept secure by using password protection and 
then stored on an encrypted USB stick. The dictaphone was secured with the use of 
a pin code. When using the transcription company, a non-disclosure agreement  was 
used  (Appendix M). 
3.4.1.3 Potential emotional distress. 
Stories can help sustain people, even in challenging times (Bennett et al., 2020; 
Clandinin et al., 2018; Miczo, 2003). Yet, whilst the interview offers a discursive 
space, it remains paramount to consider that participants may be sharing these 
accounts whilst in a state of ongoing threat. Notably, not only are nurses telling 
their stories at a time of the ongoing physical threat of the virus, but also at a time 
of emotional threat. Sharing stories may be uncomfortable, and distressing for the 
participants, and therefore anticipating and preparing for this was essential. Advice 
was sought from a highly  experienced clinical psychologist in the field of trauma at 
the University, who provided advice on shaping the interview structure to reduce 
the chance of additional distress. Below, I detail the strategies employed to mitigate 
additional distress:  
 The recruitment strategy was designed to encourage individuals to have time 
and space to consider participation before expressing their interest. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 During the interview, participants were reminded that they could take breaks 
and that they can withdraw at any point during the interview. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 As with any research into sensitive topics, the establishment of rapport and 
helping participants feel comfortable is key (Dickson-Swift et al., 2009; 
Kleinman & Copp, 1993; Miczo, 2003). As a clinician with experience working 
therapeutically, I was well-placed to manage such situations. I maintained 
sensitivity to signs of distress from participants, specifically using a validating 
stance and not closing down signs of distress. This included  advice on 
reminding participants that  they  only need  to talk about  what they feel able 
and willing to talk about, and at a level of detail that they feel comfortable with. 
 I avoided probing questions regarding more detail about specific events that 
appear to be distressing for the participant. 
 Narrative inquiry gives the agency to the participant, allowing them to be in 
control of the pace, length, structure, and content covered. 
 It was anticipated that individuals may wish to seek out further emotional 
support following the interview. Therefore, each participant was emailed 
contact details of further support (Appendix N). 
Awareness of the emotional safety of the researcher, particularly trainee 
researchers in qualitative research, is increasingly  recognised  (Bowtell et al., 2013). 
It was important to consider the importance of the potential impact on my wellbeing. 
Regular supervision with the research team, peer supervision, use of a reflective 
journal and self-care strategies were helpful. 
3.4.1.4 The screen between us: Ethical issues relating to COVID-19. 
From the very start of this project, it was uncertain whether the interviews would 
be conducted in person or remotely. In line with this, my ethical applications stated 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that the interview setting will be subject to and in line with advice set out by the 
Government, NHS Trust, and the University of Hertfordshire at that point in time. Due 
to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, all interviews were conducted remotely. 
Further consideration around confidentiality was necessary such as asking the nurse 
whether they were somewhere where they would not be disturbed. I also informed 
them I was in a place where I would not be disturbed. 
I noticed I felt apprehensive about conducting  the interviews remotely. I wondered 
if the capacity to reflect, or emotional expression would be influenced by certain 
contexts, particularly in terms of what storylines or discourses are authorised. The 
literature, however, highlights that video interviews were emerging  as a way to 
conduct interviews, even outside of a world in a pandemic (Coomber, 1997; Seitz, 
2015; Sullivan, 2012). Other benefits of video calls include personal convenience 
(Heath et al., 2018) and being at an emotionally safe distance, whilst  also being face 
to face with the researcher (Dodds & Hess, 2020; Heath et al., 2018). I followed the 
Division of Clinical Psychologys guidelines on conducting remote therapy to help 
establish rapport (British Psychological Society, 2020). 
3.5 The Interview Structure 
At the start of the interview, I stated that the interview is anticipated to be 
approximately 90 minutes, although it can be shorter or longer than this. The 
Participant Information Sheet was reviewed, including reminders about the interview 
being video and audio recorded, and confidentiality. 
The interview guide was pre-developed in collaboration with the relevant 
literature, the epistemological underpinnings, and discussions with the research 
team, peers and the research consultant. In line with the stance that narratives are 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
co-constructed, my role will both limit and shape the story told (Mishler, 1986; 
Seidman, 2006) - the interviews were loosely structured and gently guided (Squire, 
2013). I began the interview with: 
I am interested in hearing about your experience of working in ICU during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. I will ask you to tell me your story; there are no rights or 
wrongs, I would just like to hear your story in your own words. So I will give you 
time and space to tell me about this as fully as you want to, or feel able to. I will 
sit back and listen, but I do have some areas that I would like cover 
To promote narrative production, I incorporated questions relating  to chronology 
and time (Appendix O). For example, Starting  from the beginning,  it would  be good 
to know about you, growing up, did you always see yourself being a nurse?, What 
was the turning point?, What led to that? and Looking ahead, how do you see you 
future as a nurse?. All interviews closed with an opportunity for participants to add 
anything they thought was important and to reflect on how the interview had been for 
them. 
3.6 Analysing Stories 
3.6.1 Transcription. 
The process of turning talk into text is not a neutral task (Lyons, 2015), however, 
the time limitations for the project meant it was only possible for me to transcribe one 
of the six interviews. An independent transcription company was used to support the 
initial stages of verbatim transcription of content. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
As immersing oneself in the data is paramount,  I read each transcript  in turn 
whilst listening back to the audio recording which allowed me to check accuracy 
and make necessary amendments. For all of the interviews, I further transcribed by 
listening to the audio and adding in communication that goes beyond words such as 
pauses, emphasis, tone, overlapping speech and changes in volume. This was 
adapted and simplified from Jefferson (2004) (Appendix P). 
3.6.2 Analysing stories. 
There is no one singular method for narrative analysis (Riessman, 1993) and 
summarising formal guidance is no straight-forward task. However, Riessman (2008) 
refers to three broad components to narrative analysis outline  which considers 
content, structure and performative aspects of narrative. This is summarised below 
(Table 6), informed by the work of Benwell and Stokoe (2006), Riessman (2003; 
2008), Murray and Sools (2015), and Wells (2011). Whilst the components below are 
presented in terms of discrete components, they were applied synergistically and 
flexibly to inform a broad analysis.

To immerse myself in the accounts, each narrative was first analysed  as a whole. 
I listened to the audio whilst reading the transcript, which helped prompt my memory 
of the tone of the interview. I then repeatedly read each narrative to consider the 
components outlined above. Once I had listened to and read the accounts several 
times, I wrote a narrative impression for each account. The qualitative data analysis 
software, NVivo and Microsoft Word were used as a tool to manage, organise and 
assist in analysis. I then considered  all accounts collectively, exploring  similarities 
and differences across accounts. Here, I focused on specific events and identities 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that appear to be privileged, with a focus on the performative and discursive aspects 
of narrative. See Appendix Q for the analysis process. 
3.7 Ensuring Quality 
Benchmarks of rigour and credibility in qualitative research can be ensured 
through quality criteria. These often consider concepts including transparency, 
reflexivity, and transferability of findings (Treharne & Riggs, 2015). Specific to 
narrative inquiry, and in line with a constructionist lens, the notion trustworthiness 
over truth is more appropriate (Riessman, 1993). The transcripts or analysis were 
not shared with the participants which is also in line with the constructionist stance. 
Moreover, there have been concerns about the impact of member checking on the 
emotional wellbeing of participants (Wells, 2011), particularly when the topic is 
potentially emotive. Therefore, as member checking was not appropriate for the 
current study, it was necessary to consider other approaches to support the 
credibility of my analysis. I used the quality criteria set out by Tracy (2010)1 
(discussed in the Chapter Five). 
3.8 The Reflexive Researcher 
Committing to the role of the reflexive researcher is imperative in high-quality, 
credible qualitative research (Treharne & Riggs, 2015). In the ensuing section, I 
describe how I employed both personal reflexivity and epistemological reflexivity 
throughout the research process. 
Personal reflexivity involves the researcher attending to the multitude of lenses 
through which the data is viewed (Bowtell et al., 2013). It is a research tool that 
Reasons for the selection of this quality assessment were outlined in Chapter Two. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
considers what is attended to, and what is not, involving an ongoing process of 
explicitly locating their experiences, assumptions, facets of identity, and values that 
influence the research. These are inevitably shaped by the socio-cultural context 
which, in turn, contextualises the interpretation of the data. It is necessary  to be 
aware of how my methodological decision-making encourages the participant to 
construct certain identities and meanings, for example, the use of narrative analysis, 
and certain questions and prompts. 
Using my research diary helped hone my reflexive thinking throughout (Appendix 
R-S). This included reflecting on what surprised me, emotions I experienced, 
language I was drawn to, and roles I found myself acting into or resisting (the 
therapist; the researcher; white, female, healthy, young, someone who did not have 
clinical contact with patients with COVID-19, and someone with health anxieties 
around contracting COVID-19). I also used my research diary to record unplanned 
reflections that occurred outside of my dedicated research time. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Chapter Four: Analysis and Discussion 
4.1 Chapter Overview 
In this chapter, I address the research questions: 
1. How do NHS nurses construct their narratives of working in ICUs during the 
COVID-19 pandemic? 
2. What identities are constructed in their narratives? 
In keeping with a constructionist narrative analysis, I provide a summary of each 
account, considering the main storylines. I consider content, structure and to some 
extent performance. I then consider the collective storylines across all six accounts. 
Here, I attend to the common and distinct threads, and relate these to performative, 
discursive and contextual aspects within different local and broader socio-political 
contexts. I also integrate a discussion of the stories in relation  to the existing 
literature, exploring how the nurses narratives speak to and beyond the existing 
discourse. 
All interviews took place between December 2020 and February 2021. The 
interviews lasted between 60 minutes and 111 minutes. As previously noted, 
pseudonyms have been used and some identifiable information has been changed 
for anonymity purposes. Some of the nurses stated that they were happy for 
identifiable information to be kept in, and so this has been done where certain 
information is important in understanding broader stories. In keeping with the 
constructionist stance to the project, I continue to write in the first person; this is 
based on the understanding that the analyses are co-constructions from my 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
perspective of participant accounts, with the meanings both fluid and contextual 
(Earthy & Cronin, 2008). 
4.2 Summary of Individual Stories 
4.2.1 Roses story. 
Rose is a 28-year-old, White British woman with seven years' nursing experience 
and five years ICU experience. This account was different to the others,  in that in 
she worked across two sites during the pandemic. In addition to working at the 
hospital site, Rose was voluntarily redeployed to another hospital ward for several 
shifts. 
Rose struck me as a compelling narrator. For the most part, her account followed 
a coherent and chronological sequence. Imbued with calmness, the account evolved 
gradually, which helped me develop a clear sense of time and place. She told  me 
how in February 2020 word was getting around about coronavirus but that nobody 
ever really thought it was going to happen, but when the surrounding hospitals 
was so overwhelmed, we couldnt not. Rose used vivid descriptions, for example 
she spoke of putting two patients in one-bed space and putting extra oxygen ports 
on the wall. Woven into Roses description was the use of technical, medical 
language (learning about how these patients behave; septic; 200 systolic to 
about 60; mucus bugs), which appeared to highlight her knowledgeable position in 
keeping with the highly specialised and technical but somewhat impersonal ICU 
setting. 
When talking of the impact of the pandemic, Rose spoke about how initially she 
thought it was just people scaremongering and that she underestimated 
it massively. This was a phrase she repeated (completely underestimated it) but 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
soon after moved on to her talk about other, and more positively evaluated aspects of 
her experience, that it was nice to be part of something that would go down in 
history. 
A turning point in the account occurred when Rose spoke of the hospital she was 
redeployed to during the pandemic. This appeared to provide Rose, and me through 
the construction of her story, with a contrast between the two sites. Speaking of the 
hospital she was redeployed to, she narrated that the standard of care was lower. 
Rose also spoke about how her role changed when she was working at the other 
hospital, and this talk helped position herself professionally.  She narrated  how  she 
had to support nurses who, unlike her, lacked previous  ICU experience: they saw 
me as the ITU nurse any time anyone had any problems and that she was really 
pleased that they felt they could come to me. She described that it was not just 
patients you were having to look after, it was all the staff as well. This talk appeared 
to construct how Rose, despite being an experienced and specialised ICU nurse, 
was pushed beyond her comfort zone. 
The narrative of quest (Frank, 1995) emerges towards the end of the account 
when Rose narrated how her experience during the pandemic had led her to want to 
have some sort of management experience but also that covid has sort of 
accentuated the fact that I want to remain by the bedside. 
4.2.2 Amelias story. 
Amelia is a 56-year-old Asian woman. Though with 13 years experience as a 
nurse in another department in the hospital, Amelia had no ICU experience before 
volunteering (her duty) to work for three days in the ICU during the pandemic. 
Amelia was at the hospital when the interview took place, and there were several 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
interruptions by her colleagues, something that may have contributed to the 
interrupted flow and tone of the account. 
Unlike Rose, Amelia did not set the scene (Labov, 1972). Although English  was 
not Amelias first language, I had the impression that it was difficult for her to tell her 
story, as indicated by the structure of her talk. For example, she marked her account 
in three distinct days in a list-style format and made temporal jumps between these 
days (so, the first day, I thought, so much fear, one thing is covid, because (2) but 
only  thing Im encouraged  the:: because the precautions  help,  so thats a strength for 
me to do, the work which was soon  followed by and then second one, then  the, 
erm, the night  shift, I have done only three days. But its first day, Im totally  confused 
like that because its new environment). With the absence of narrative detail, I felt 
distant from the narrative. 
Telling me why she volunteered, Amelia referred to her duty to make her 
contribution and she is a little bit strong actually, even though fear in ways that 
resonate with broader societal narratives about nursing as a vocation and 
responsibility. Amelia then told me that she has a health condition that may have 
put her at further risk of more serious COVID-19 illness (its risky but, I did the risk 
also, thank god nothing happened), which supports her earlier story of strength. 
Like Rose, Amelia also constructed an identity as a competent nurse, while 
simultaneously stressing the difficulties of this period (its challenging period 
actually, very challenging). A plot that appeared important for Amelia to convey was 
that she managed (I am just helping, but I manage a lot of things; even though 
difficulties,  because I learn something and then next I can face without fear  cos my 
fear gone).  Yet woven into these  stories were also  talk of fears, such as  feeling 
scared to breathe near her husband, swiftly followed by expressing her trust for the 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
PPE, describing it as a strength for me to do, the work. Amelias talk appeared to 
combine a sense of personal threat with organisational protection. 
Amelia discussed how many of the patients with COVID-19 that needed ICU care 
were of Asian ethnicity, and how this perpetuated more fear. She spoke of needing 
to be more careful and that her guard need to be strong. Amelia also discussed 
how her Buddhist faith and belief in karma played  a part in her volunteering to work 
in the ICU, stating that she believed she was part of the wider organisation (helping 
for good things). 
4.2.3 Leias story. 
Leia,  aged 30, is a White Italian  woman and was at the hospital  when the 
interview took place. With six years experience as an ICU nurse  prior to the 
pandemic, she had been specialising in another department within the hospital at the 
time. Leia returned to the ICU for six months during the height of the first wave of 
COVID-19 in April to September 2020. Leia spoke fast and switched between short 
stories quickly. For example, she moved from talking about  anxiety  about  the 
patients with COVID-19 to talking about concerns about PPE (the patients were 
totally different, so there was quite a lot of anxiety about, am I doing the right thing. 
Um, I wasnt sure that the PPE are protecting us). 
Although working in another department in the hospital  before the pandemic 
started,  she  positioned  herself  as a critical care nurse from early on. Throughout 
her narrative, Leia made relevant her values of compassionate and family-centred 
care. She told me how the hospital took the overflow from surrounding hospitals, 
very often families were not even aware that their loved one was with us and spoke 
of how it was very stressful and worrying for the patients family. She discussed 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
how she was required to have difficult conversations over the phone. Leia then 
spoke of having particularly struggled with not having the control or seeing how 
that person reacted to my words and not being able to offer them a drink, 
highlighting the way that usual ICU working was so dramatically different under 
conditions of infection control restrictions. But during a period of time in which news 
reports of the pandemics devastating impact in Italy, Leia also stressed wanting to 
treat my people back home in Italy, which, similar  to Rose and Amelia, pointed  to 
a sense of duty. 
Leia ended her narrative by talk of having realised the importance of 
communicating with people that you love and make them know that you love 
them, share with them 
what's important to you. Yet this narrative soon comes to a halt, as if to remind us 
both that the pandemic is not over yet, and further constructs a sense of professional 
duty: if the pandemic takes over, Im ready to go back to critical care. 
4.2.4 Annas story 
Anna, aged 41, is an Asian woman with 21 years experience as a nurse. She 
usually works in another department within the hospital but volunteered to be 
redeployed to ICU for four days during the first wave of the pandemic. The interview 
took place when Anna was at work. 
Many of Annas stories showed her wanting to put others before herself , and in 
volunteering to work in the ICU during the pandemic, for example (to help out). Like 
the other nurses, this pointed to a sense of duty. This was also constructed by her 
telling me why she wanted to participate  in the interview  (I want to help  you with 
your research), despite initially expressing feeling worried about taking part in the 
interview. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Structurally, Anna began with brief answers to my questions, leading to a 
somewhat question-and-answer style format. Annas answers became longer, 
however, when she told of the challenges of juggling work and childcare, and the 
difficult decision to send her children to school during  the first national  lockdown 
(we:: are sending you to school, not because we don't love you, we are sending you 
to school because mummy and daddy has to go to work). Positions of good parent 
and good nurse were therefore apparent in the dilemma, as her hesitant decision 
was narratively dismissed: we dont have a choice. 
Unlike Rose and Leia, the content and performance aspects of Annas talk drew 
attention to the emotionality vulnerability  of nurses  during  the pandemic. For 
example, when talking about working during the pandemic she said it's so hard to 
work in there because I am easily get attached to:: a patient. I noticed I felt moved  
by how distressed Anna was, and provided more validation than I did in other 
interviews. My response may have had an impact (or even disrupted) the depth of 
Annas stories because at this stage the account moved briskly onto say but we get 
through it. Thats what they say, were in this together and that she adopted a 
practical approach  (but you have to get on with it). This may also  point to not 
wanting to show too much emotion and uphold  professionality.  Annas  talk 
appeared to show a movement over time, away from the  emotional  vulnerability, 
when she storied I will volunteer to ITU again. Ending her interview, she affirmed I 
think the future will be good and looks forward to 2021 whatever it brings. I think we 
are stronger. Annas shifting between personal and collective pronouns (I and 
we) points to a corroboration with others, suggesting that a collective identity 
appeared to be protecting her somehow. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
4.2.5 Janes story. 
Jane, aged 26, is a White British woman with four and a half years nursing 
experience and three years in ICU. The interview took place when Jane was at 
home. Although at the start, Jane told me her memory was a bit of a blur, she 
appeared to retell stories as they came into her mind during the interview. I had the 
sense that this was a narrative not told until now. 
Jane spoke of how she was not given a choice on whether to work during the 
pandemic (we were just told to). Like Amelia, Jane highlighted the tension  between 
a professional duty and duty towards the health of themselves and their families 
(we're scared for ourselves, our families; you just do worry about passing it back 
onto your family)  the use of we constructing an understandable collective 
concern of professionals, rather than a personal weakness. 
Jane described how some nurses got to kind of rotate a bit and go to recovery or 
the ward, but that this was not the case for her as every single shift I was in that 
covid area), yet didn't feel like I could (2) voice my opinion.  Jane also  made 
relevant her position within the hierarchy  when she told me you're just a band 5 on 
the ward who: you just get told what to do effectively (2) from your seniors (1) and 
youve just got to trust that (1) obviously, its come from somewhere higher up. This 
may draw on broader discourses of lack of agency within a broader hierarchical 
system, and/or professional responsibility, but an awareness that higher up were 
responsible for decision making. Another key thread within her account was the clear 
shift away from normal ICU patient care and nursing practice. Jane then spoke about 
struggling with the dignity side and the care side of things and how nurses  were 
being required to perform duties we didnt have training on. Yet, despite this, Jane 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
narrated its kind of::: adapting to the times but still feeling (1) cautious and I guess 
like (1) worried about doing the wrong thing. 
The narrative shifted when Jane narrated how she used social media it was just 
a way of offloading. This suggests Jane was gradually feeling able to speak of her 
experiences - albeit in a virtual capacity - pointing to the veneer and distance of 
social media creating a safer space to share stories. 
Towards the end of the account, Jane constructed  the pandemic  as a disruption 
to her career progression as an ICU nurse. She told me how the next module for her 
ICU training was postponed again because of covid which, she said, is a bit 
frustrating. However, the tone shifted when Jane spoke feeling more confident and 
that she has placed less pressure on herself. Jane initially told me how she 
questioned her role as an ICU nurse: during the first wave she honestly thought:: I 
was going to give it up but  as with many of these nurses  accounts  concluded 
with a more hopeful note that things will eventually go back to some normality and 
that she now definitely wants to stay in ICU. 
4.2.6 Ellies story. 
Ellie is a 31-year-old, White British woman with four years experience as a nurse 
and one years experience in ICU. During the first wave of the pandemic, she was 
working in another department within the hospital. Ellies rotational post to ICU was 
delayed for several months due to the pandemic (because they didn't want to move 
staff and start like retraining them in the middle of the pandemic). Therefore, Ellie 
began working in ICU at the hospital site during the second wave. She was at home 
for the interview. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
As she had previously worked in a different department, Ellie first spoke about the 
shift to ICU work generally. She told me that one of the things she initially really 
struggled with was that ITU itself is a whole different world of nursing which, she 
said, was strange to get my head around. Ellie described how as people were 
sedated and ventilated, theyre a body in a bed, which like obviously, they're not, 
like people know theyre a person  highlighting the challenges of moving to work in 
ITU, even without a pandemic. 
Ellie explained that during the first wave of the pandemic when it was all kicking 
off, she had some annual leave and volunteered to work at another hospital to care 
for those with COVID-19. She spoke of how it was probably the worst week of my 
entire life. Ellie recalled a story of measuring a patients oxygen saturation and 
having never seen oxygen levels like it , trying a different finger and I was like, 
maybe the reading is not right. She spoke too about worry for the patients in other 
wards where she worked: I was so like scared of them covid getting on to that Unit 
and it would, from what Id seen, I was like it would just wipe out the Unit. Of note is 
that Ellie initially spoke more about fears for the patients who were very complex 
and so vulnerable, rather than worries for herself. It was only later in Ellies account 
that she spoke about the worries she had for herself. She discussed realising she 
had COVID-19 antibodies and that this led her to feel much safer. 
Ellie recalled the difficulties she faced when she received emails asking her about 
working extra shifts. Her talk pointed to a tension  between  an organisational  duty 
and self-care: finding that balance between wanting to go in and help but 
recognising that by continually working she could end  up going  off sick anyway, 
and so she decided to pull back from extra shifts. Ellie then negotiated her position 
on language propagated by the media, such as the use of the hero narrative, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
wartime language: we didn't sign up to go to war, we signed up to be nurses and 
have been dragged into this and we didn't sign up for a suicide mission. 
Ellie concluded we are privileged compared to some other, how some other 
people have had it. I wondered whether this was speaking to the protection that 
may have come with being a tertiary care centre, or pointing to a strong collective 
ICU identity narrated across the accounts. 
4.3 Collective Stories 
In considering the accounts collectively, I explore commonalities and differences 
between storylines, performance and discursive  aspects,  and draw on the contexts 
in which the narratives were produced. I also present this  alongside  existing 
literature. I weave in the nurses quotations. For the longer quotations, time markers 
will be included for clarity regarding at what point in the interview the talk occurred.

4.3.1.1 Nobody ever really thought it was going to happen: Tales of the 
unexpected. 
Across the accounts, although differing in level of detail, the arrival of the COVID- 
19 pandemic was depicted as a sudden disruption. All but two of the nurses (Amelia 
and Leia) set the scene (Labov, 1972): 
It was just- it was just normal [hospital site]. Um, yeah, it was just all very 
normal and what we were used to. Um, and then around about sort of February 
time (1) um, sort of word was getting around about coronavirus and nobody 
ever really thought it was going to happen, or we were gunna- it was gunna-, 
you know, have much of an impact on us. But then, in a matter of weeks, we'd 
been red-zoned. 
Rose (10m) 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Roses scripted a what could possibly go wrong? plot familiar to the beginning of 
many stories (it was just normal [hospital site]). Roses talk of nobody ever really 
thought it was going to happen speaks to the work of Wooffitt (1992). Specifically, 
how constructing scenes of normality  and thus the narrator themselves as normal 
and credible - are important for those who begin to tell stories of extraordinary 
experiences. Rose then said but then, in a matter of weeks, we'd been red-zoned, 
which constructed the arrival of the pandemic as an abrupt departure from the scene 
of normality told moments before. 
I remember  hearing,  I really vividly remember  like, there was a consultant in, 
um, and this  was when covid was kind of that thing  on the news happening  in 
Italy that no one really believed would happen here, and there was a consultant 
that had a friend working in Italy. It was in the doctors room talking to her 
colleagues, it was like, yeah, the, the hospitals in Italy are like running out of 
oxygen and it just sounded like this, this nuts thing. 
Ellie (17m) 
Ellie also sets the scene, narrating how she  remembered really  vividly the start 
of the pandemic. As in Wooffitts (1992) previous analyses of people talking about 
events that others may struggle to understand or even believe, Rose and Ellies 
accounts combine the hard-to-understand (this nuts thing events that no-one really 
believed would happen) with discursive devices such as detailed description and 
reminders to the listeners that the narrator remembers this really vividly (Ellie). This 
was then juxtaposed with it kind of came then quite suddenly, it came with like a 
bang). Again, with the use of onomatopoeia, highlights a departure from the norm 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
and the shock that came with this. Though incredible, these are first-hand, witness 
accounts that must be taken seriously (Edwards, 2005; 2007). 
the first thing  I remember  actually, was, um, when the matron  came round with 
(2) I can't remember who it was, but someone very senior in the hospital  and 
told the patients relatives that they were going to have to start cutting down to 
only one visitor. Um, so this was before,  you know, lockdown, social distancing. 
But I think government had given guidance that, you know, we were going to 
have to start (2) maybe potentially locking down, um, and trying to stop (1) the 
spread. 
Jane (19m) 
Jane also painted a vivid picture of how the arrival of the pandemic presented an 
interruption to the usual ICU activities. She also brought in the voice of someone 
higher in the hierarchy (someone very senior) to convey how from early on, difficult 
decisions were being made (cutting down to only one visitor). Again, the use of 
detailed description and narrative flow are widely understood by listeners as 
demonstrating plausible accounts of real events in constructing authentic accounts 
(Edwards & Potter, 2001). 
Janes words chime with the recent accounts of ICU nurses in Spain (Fernndez- 
Castillo et al. (2021), stressing  the difficulty of patient  isolation,  and how this 
impacted on the nurses emotionally. Notably, the nurses in this study reported that 
reducing patient contact impacted their workload and their stress levels (Fernndez- 
Castillo et al., 2021). Other studies discuss how the changes and ambiguities in 
protocols and guidelines around patient isolation led to reported confusion and 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
anxiety in nurses (Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020), although this did not feature in 
the nurses accounts in the present study. 
4.3.1.2 Wed been red-zoned: Stepping up as a professional. 
A strong theme across all of the nurses narratives was of their professional 
commitment as nurses, and the sometimes-contradictory impacts of their 
professional identities. The nurses described wanting  to help but at times narrated 
that they did not have a choice (due to their position in staff hierarchy, and feeling 
that they had a moral or professional obligation). This points to broader professional 
and cultural discourses as nursing as a vocation, and the dilemmas of this such as 
being torn between commitments to be a good nurse and a good mother (Anna). 
For Amelia, Anna, and Leia, who were working in other departments when the 
pandemic started, the professional commitment was more explicit. Anna narrated 
how, despite ICU work being a really different area, she wanted to help the ICU 
nurses (ITU nurses already have enough, you know, and then they need help. 
That's why I volunteer), which draws on broader professional nursing narratives 
about helping others in times of need. 
Rose volunteered to work several shifts at another hospital in April 2020.  Similar 
to Anna, Rose constructed a sense of professional duty and that she had skills to 
offer. Through her talk of surprise that more nurses did not jump at the opportunity 
to work at another hospital, Rose positioned herself as someone who was 
enthusiastic, despite the unknown. Rose further strengthened this when she 
explicitly narrated part of me was kind of excited (1) I know that sounds really 
awful. Here, she expressed awareness of how I may be perceiving her, and perhaps 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
a taken-for-granted assumption of experiencing only distressing emotions at the 
pandemic. This chimes with research that working in novel and risky contexts has 
reported to increase the motivation of HCWs, as reported from a quantitative study 
from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Imai et al., 2010). 
Leia, who was working in another department when the pandemic started, 
presented a story of concern for her colleagues working in the ICU. Leia pointed to a 
collective identity and sense of duty when she spoke of how she had really 
struggled with not being with her mates in ICU and that she knew from the 
beginning that she had to go back to help, adding it just felt right. Similar to Rose, 
Leias talk spoke to a nursing as a vocation narrative.  A sense  of duty  was apparent 
and strong, which may have stemmed not only from identity as an experienced and 
skilled ICU nurse but also as a friend. This echoes other recently emerging literature 
whereby nurses have reported a strong sense of duty and professional commitment to 
work during the pandemic (Cui et al., 2020; Goh et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2020), 
however, propose that the sense of duty is more complex  in that nurses reported  a 
responsibility  to the sacred  mission,  yet also  an obligation to work during the 
pandemic due to fears contagious nature of the virus. 
Jane, however, narrated how she was not given a choice: 
No:, it was never discussed. We, uh, we were just told to:: Well, it was just 
one day, right, its going to be a red zone and that was it. You just had to, you 
just had to go in and, and um, you know, I think maybe if you voiced concerns 
there would have been some support. 
Jane (48m) 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
I think I would have felt guilty not having a health problem and: being one of 
the younger members of the team, um, you know (1) if Id have said, oh no, I 
don't feel safe, I don't want to go in. Because at the end of the day, someone 
has to look after these patients. Theyre someone's family and:: I wouldn't, I 
think I, yeah, I wouldn't have felt right 
Jane (49m) 
Jane constructed a sense of doing what she was told by those more senior (we 
were just told to::). Here, she drew on her position with the staff hierarchy, and that 
this happened suddenly (it was just one day; and that was it). Jane reported that 
she worried about passing it back onto your family, which echoes the COVID-19 
literature that nurses encountered tension between  ones  professional  duty to 
patients, and to ones own health  and  that of their family (Kherbache  et al., 2021; 
Lord et al., 2021). Jane also  drew on a combination  of traditionally  held nursing 
values of compassion (theyre someones family) and professional  responsibility 
when she said that she would have felt guilty not to work during the pandemic, with 
reference to her age and health status as protective factors. 
It is of note that a sense of duty appears to have different nuances within the 
COVID-19 literature. Cui et al. (2020) and Zhang  et al (2020)  report  the sense  of 
duty as a badge of honour, showing allegiance to both the profession and country  
this also fits with the intrinsic motivation  aspect  within  self-determination  theory 
(Ryan & Deci, 2000). However, the present study highlights how the over reliance on 
nurses being either intrinsically or extrinsically motivated is too dichotomous and 
oversimplistic. Indeed, this framework is likely to not take into account the very real 
dangers that come with being a nurse during a pandemic, particularly in the context 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
of long working hours, broader narratives that deny the existence of the pandemic, 
and celebration of nurses, yet lack of appropriate pay for their skill. 
By contrast, the South-Korean study (Lee & Lee,  2020)  describe  a sense  of duty 
as unavoidable and an obligation, perhaps in fears of repercussions of not showing 
duty. The present study, by employing narrative analysis - and its focus on discursive 
elements and identity work  adds to the existing literature, notably the role of power 
within staff hierarchies and the juggling of competing identities (good nurse, good 
mother). 
It is also interesting to consider how able nurses may have felt to say they did not 
want to work, particularly as broader narratives of HCWs as saints and heroes was 
prevalent from the start of the pandemic. These narratives may have encouraged a 
sense of needing to rise to the challenge, despite anxieties. McDougall et al. (2021) 
discuss that although HCWs obligation  to care for patients  is central to the running 
of healthcare systems, working during such crises raises  questions  about duty  of 
care, due to the risks involved. As Ellie stated, we didn't sign up for a suicide 
mission. 
4.3.2 Working in the red zone. 
4.3.2.1 You deserve so much more than this: Moral distress about 
standards of care. 
Given the demand placed on the ICU capacity, all of the nurses reported 
encountering fraught and deeply challenging situations relating to patient care. 
These included not being able to provide the usual standard of care in order to 
prioritise life-saving treatment, and witnessing the death of many patients. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Rose talked of how her expectations of the pandemic were very different from the 
reality (I underestimated it massively) and that she didnt believe it at first. Rose 
then explained: 
but it wasn't until we started receiving these patients and seeing how sick they 
really were, I was like, oh my God, and this is just (2) and there were thousands of 
them all over the country. Just very weird (2) very weird. 
Rose (15m) 
Rose appears to draw on a normalising device (Jefferson, 1991) where speakers 
often initially say at first I thought X, then I realised Y to convey that their 
assumption is similar to others (didnt believe it at first), presenting themselves as a 
credible narrator. Rose then moved on to narrate the reality of the situation (seeing 
how sick they really were) and repetition of very weird (2) very weird. This too 
constructed a persuasive, first-hand witness account. 
Later, Rose went on to speak about the difference in standard of care at the other 
hospital she was redeployed to: 
patients were like getting pressure sores and they didn't have mouth care 
equipment, so you couldn't give patients mouth care. So they, they didn't even 
have a supply of running, hot water. Um, so you were basically having to just 
baby wipe patients down, which I thought was just disgusting. 
Rose (48m) 
Rose then drew on nursing values of compassion when she narrated how she felt 
really, really sad and I just thought, my God, you [the patients] deserve so much 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
more than this. This speaks  to what Chan et al. (2013)  calls an atrocity  story 
where one affirms their disapproval of such a situation to reinforce their views and 
boundaries, which, therefore,  draws the listener  in. This  talk reflected how Rose 
faced a tension between her identity a skilled ICU nurse within a specialist  hospital, 
and, due to lack of resources, a stark encounter with being unable to deliver patient 
care at the hospital she was redeployed to. Roses talk points to an impossible moral 
dilemma: in the face of so many unwell patients and low resources, the standards of 
care were not good enough. 
Jane spoke of how she struggled with the dignity  side and  the care side  of 
patient care. For example, she recounted how patients  were required  to be 
transferred around the hospital with a drape over their beds to stop aerosols  or 
things spreading. Jane then told me how this was slightly undignified, you would 
never do that normally with a patient. Jane also narrated we-we never really proned 
patients, it was kind of last resort but nearly every patient was being proned. Jane 
then moved on to talk about the shift in patient care and  tasks, we were never kind 
of told what you do if some, if someone goes to the toilet and they're lying on their 
front. Janes talk, again with continued vivid description (Edwards, 2005; 2007), 
helped to construct the scene as a clear departure from the usual activities. 
Jane reported feeling unable to do provide the care she usually would (I love(2) 
being able to wash my patients hair, play with, you know, play with their hair, hold 
their hand, things like that) in fear of becoming infected. A key concern for Jane was 
passing the virus on to her family (you just do worry about passing it back onto your 
family). Janes talk speaks to how nurses were faced with the complex tension 
between professional duty and personal duties to protect themselves and their family 
(Ganz et al., 2019; Kherbache et al., 2021; Lord et al., 2021), further highlighting 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
juggling demands of competing identities. This also highlights how the pandemic 
marked a crisis that undermined nurses capacity to treat patients whilst maintaining 
their own safety (Anders, 2020). 
Leia spoke of working with bodies rather than, rather than patients and that it 
didnt feel for a nurse that we were really nursing them. We were: (2) doing really our 
best but (1) we were not looking after them the way we would have done if we had  
the resources. Leia then narrated how although usually we like to get to know our 
patients but we had to choose to provide the, the life-saving treatment. This points 
to the inability to protect patients dignity at all times, in keeping  with the normal order 
of care, was distressing for the nurses, which aligns with the literature  on moral 
distress (Greenberg et al., 2020). This echoes the reported finding that ethical 
challenges related to patient care were a key source of distress for nurses (Fernndez-
Castillo et al., 2001; Galehdar et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2021;  Tan et al., 2020). 
you would have suddenly:: in a week, three, four deaths, one after the other, 
and then:: being always a bit worried, is there enough space in the mortuary. 
Would we have to move bodies somewhere else? And then, when you, when 
you had someone dying, we were very conscious that we were the last, the last 
ones to see that person, because once the body bag was sealed, there was no, 
no way that that could have been reopened. So the families were not able to do 
any visit and we were very conscious that that was us, the last, the last people 
that saw that, the poor person that died. 
Leia (12m) 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Above, Leia highlighted how, in addition to trying to keep as many patients as 
possible alive, there were practical implications of the high number of patient deaths 
(one after the other), such as mortuary space. Leia then narrated how this was 
something she had not prepared for, again highlighting how patient deaths were 
not being handled in the way they usually would. 
Mortuary space is not discussed in the reviewed studies, however, the NHS 
England (2020) stated that the pandemic placed increased demand on mortuary 
services nationally. Furthermore, Horton (2020) in a commentary in The Lancet, 
reported that during the first wave of the pandemic in some UK hospitals, emergency 
mortuary space was created in car parks, where bodies were moved at night to avoid 
attention from the media. 
     Ellie was working at another hospital when the pandemic started (before moving 
to ICU at the recruiting hospital site). She told me: 
they knew that they were going to run out of intensive care beds, so they made 
a lot of people not for resus or not for intensive care and I had one shift where I 
just had like three, or like two or three patients in a row just deteriorate, 
deteriorate, deteriorate  and like talking to the doctors who were really  busy and 
I was like, can, you know, this guy, he's got, his oxygen levels are like in his 
boots, like can he come and see him and they were like hes not for resus. 
and that was the answer, and I was like, need to come and see them and they 
were like, yeah, they're not for resus. 
Ellie (17m) 
Ellies active voicing (Wooffitt, 1992) to bring in the voice of the doctors and 
repetition (hes not for resus), help construct the drama and reality of this scene. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Her sense of powerlessness is conveyed as she continued:  but from your 
perspective as a nurse, when you're just watching that and you're like, what are we 
doing, like (2) this is mad. Ellies position in the hierarchy (nurse rather than the 
doctors: removed from decisions that others (they) make and passive positioning 
just watching) convey a sense of powerlessness in the face of such events. Ellie 
needing to adopt a bystander  position  chimes with nurses  reportings  in the 
Canadian study (Lapum et al., 2021). Ellies switches of pronoun also suggest a 
collective, shared experience amoung nurses, and an ongoing  struggle  to make 
sense of this. Wider narratives from Ellie and others highlight the significant pressure 
on ICUs and the need to make difficult decisions, which prevent them  fulfilling roles 
as they usually would. 
I had friends on the unit who, you know, one, she had to sit with the webcam 
on like while the patient was dying for the family to like watch the patient die, 
basically. 
Jane (68m) 
This is echoed in the COVID-19 literature, which highlights that nurses faced a 
multitude of morally challenging situations during the current pandemic  (Jia et al., 
2021; Lapum et al.,  2021; Tan et al, 2020),  including  patients  dying without their 
loved ones present (Cui et al., 2020; Fernndez-Castillo et al., 2021; Galehdar et al., 
2020; Lapum et al. 2021). As the nurses in the current study reported, much of this 
distress came from being unable to provide the usual standard of care, or having no 
choice but to take a passive, rather than an active role (Kok et al., 2020). Cui et al. 
(2020) discuss that nurses reported  they  were labelled  as carriers of the virus  by 
the public, which contributed to moral distress. The existing ICU, pre-COVID-19 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
literature highlights how end of life care, and preparation for this, is a moral 
imperative for ICU nurses (Peden-McAlpine et al., 2015), thus the COVID-19 
pandemic marked another clear disruption from the norm for the nurses. 
4.3.2.2 An extra pair of hands: Redeployed nurses to ICU. 
Amelia, a nurse redeployed from another department in the hospital, spoke about 
the initial challenges of working in ICU. Jane and  Leia (with ICU experience)  and 
Ellie (without ICU experience) recounted the experience of working with nurses who 
were redeployed to ICU, and all framed this as challenging. Rose, by contrast, was 
also redeployed to another hospital. However, unlike  other nurses  at the other 
hospital, Rose also supported  other  redeployed  nurses  from non-essential 
services: 
most of the registered nurses that were there, they'd been redeployed from 
sort of (1) non-essential services such as, um, ophthalmology, sexual health. 
So most of these nurses who were there, the-they hadnt really been working in 
the clinical area for years, um, so we were suddenly thrust back into this 
environment. Not only was it clinical they were being expected to look after, you 
know, one or two ITU patients, without any training um:: it must have been a lot 
worse for them than it was for me, but because:: I have to say they were 
amazing. 
Rose (32m) 
Rose used perspective-taking and empathy to construct her account of what it 
may have been like for the nurses who were redeployed. She also used the pronoun 
we, aligning herself with the redeployed nurses, which draws on broader 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
professional nursing narratives of not only  supporting  patients  but also  her 
colleagues. Rose then  narrated  how, as an experienced  ICU nurse,  she was 
required to take a leadership role.  This too points  to Roses  sense  of duty not only 
to patients but, as a skilled ICU nurse, as a duty to support the other nurses. Below, 
Rose spoke of doing the ITU-y stuff, which speaks to how ICU nurses are more 
familiar with performing technical procedures (Credland, 2021) and treating the most 
unwell patients (Park, 2020): 
I was kind of overseeing all six patients and all the staff, um (2) just to make 
sure that  all the sort of most important  things were being done. Um, yeah (2)  so 
they  were kind of bedside nursing,  but I was sort of doing  the more ITU-y stuff. 
Rose (32m) 
Jane also narrated what it was like to work with redeployed nurses, but with a 
different perspective: 
I actually think it (2) I know this sounds horrible because (1) of course, they 
wanted to do their bit and help out and like Im super grateful for that but I 
honestly think it added to our stress, um, instead of having an extra pair of 
hands to help, it was, it was kind of trying to, trying to teach them at the same 
time while trying to look after a patient, and youre not even familiar with this, 
um, illness. 
Jane (57m) 
Structurally, Jane preceded her story by saying I know this sounds horrible and 
Im super grateful  perhaps a hedge (Weatherall, 2011). Here, Jane appeared to 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
be putting in work to not be seen as a complainer or unprofessional at a time when 
there is broader controversy about the COVID-19 pandemic. This speaks to the 
dilemma that nurses were faced with  between upholding professionality, whilst 
still communicating the challenges she faced. Indeed, this is within a context of 
broader counter-narratives propagated by both the media and the government, 
which may undermine nurses stories in terms of what they say, and how  - 
including narratives that deny the existence of the pandemic. As such, the use of 
this hedge may speak to the nurses guarding against the risk of being seen as a 
complainer. Yet, despite  this, Jane  clearly conveyed the difficulties that came with 
working with redeployed staff. Her talk may also speak to the impact of there being  
newcomers at a time when a collective identity appeared to be protective, and 
supports the literature regarding  the importance of a sense of belonging during a 
crisis (Kings Fund, 2020b). 
Ellie also recounted the difficulties of working with redeployed staff. Although she 
reminded me that she was a new ITU nurse as well, the content and performance 
aspects of her talk positioned her otherwise (like you've got an extra pair of hands 
but then actually in other ways, then you're also trying to teach, which takes so much 
longer). Ellie then discussed the time pressures the unit  was under:  there  wasn't 
time to do that like nicey-nicey like this is, you know, welcome to intensive care like, 
you know, this is how this works and this is how this works. This supports  the 
literature around how a task-orientated approach can encourage silo working and the 
slipping of the usual niceties (BPS COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing Group, 2020). Ellie also 
described how the experience presented a disruption to her professional identity as a 
nurse (I became then quite like directive, which you don't like). Ellies shift in 
pronouns from I to you, may also signal something that was beyond her control. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
So there was also this burden for us with the critical care experience to be 
named a nurse A to supervise the nurse B whos a nurse that doesnt have ICU 
experience. And they were very scared and for them, it was so difficult. They, 
they would be crying every day and having really difficult times, um, but also for 
us as being experienced nurse, very often you would (2) find yourself the only one 
 experienced nurse with six very sick, sick patients to look after the patients 
and the nurses. It was very tough. 
Leia (9m) 
Leias story had similarities with Ellies in that she narrated the difficulty of working with 
redeployed nurses due to the many other challenges they faced, however, also has 
similarities with Roses by conveying empathy for the redeployed nurses. 
As a redeployed nurse from another department within the hospital, Amelia 
narrated her experience of working in ICU for three days: 
First day, good supporter, I think I didnt get good supporter first day, cos itu 
were so busy, thats the main thing you know, I had to familiarise  their 
computers, their places, you know (2) new place, I had to familiarise myself a 
little bit. I know I go there, come back, but I didnt work like, I feel like (2) if I saw 
the sea, but the sea I didnt go and swim, but I have swim before, but I havent:: 
you know, background:: everything together, thats why. I am not happy for the 
first day cos totally my mind not very good, because fear also, and workload 
also, and the people not (2), I think I got a bit new girl. 
Amelia (24m) 
The two stories above, from Leia (ICU-trained) and  Amelia (redeployed), highlights the 
emotional impact for redeployed nurses from different perspectives. Supporting Ellies 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
story, Amelia too points to the pressures on staff led to difficulties for the induction of 
redeployed staff (I think I didnt get good supporter first day, cos ITU were so busy). 
Amelia then spoke of the emotional experience (fear and my mind not very good) and 
draws on a school metaphor (I think I got a bit new girl), which may speak to the 
collective ICU identity of the ICU team. A systematic review of HCWs redeployed to ICUs 
during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high levels of anxiety and stress and this was 
largely attributed to a lack of adequate support (Juan et al., 2021). Further, in an online 
international study HCWs redeployed to ICU during the current pandemic reported higher 
levels of depression, and noted that they were dissatisfied with the quantity and quality of 
training they received (Khajuria et al., 2021). The challenges of working with redeployed 
staff echoes a theme in the study by Fernndez-Castillo et al. (2021). Other studies 
stated they required participants to have a minimum experience of working directly with 
COVID-19 positive patients such as two weeks (Galehdar et al., 2020) or seven days 
(Sheng et al., 2020). Despite the inclusion of redeployed nurses in their sample, 
however, neither explicitly discuss the experiences of the redeployment from nurses. Not 
only is this present study different in terms of the variation  of length  of time nurses 
worked in ICU for, but also offers stories from these different positions. 
The redeployment of nurses to ICU during the current pandemic  for both ICU 
nurses and those redeployed  highlights how working conditions influence 
psychological distress,  and therefore overlaps with the models  of occupational 
stress. The P-E Fit model (Caplan,1987) highlights that dissonance between a 
workers individual characteristics with work context impacts wellbeing, whereas the 
DCS model (Karasek & Theorell, 1990) proposes that wellbeing is most impacted 
when workers are faced with high demands and perceived low control. This is also 
supported by a qualitative study (Feeley et al., 2020) from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
where redeployed staff reported a greater disruption of the balance between the 
worker and the environment and higher levels of stress. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
4.3.2.3  You were wearing a plastic bag while trying to do your job: 
The physical, psychological and social challenges of PPE. 
With the exception of Anna, stories of PPE featured across the narratives. This 
included stories of depleting PPE supplies, concerns about whether the PPE would 
sufficiently protect them, the physical and psychological impact of wearing PPE, 
interwoven with stories of feeling let down by the system. 
Rose narrated how, during the first wave of the pandemic, she felt a bit angry 
about not having simple thing as to not having proper PPE. The use of simple 
thing points to feeling let down by the system, and adequate PPE being something 
they should have but did not, without explicitly attributing blame. This is further 
constructed through her talk of feeling a bit angry pointing to how she does not 
hope to be viewed as a complainer. She then spoke about how the senior nurses 
resorted to making their own PPE: 
all the band 7s, they just literally went to Hobby Craft, got some like clear 
plastic and made their own visors they bought some plastic, they bought some 
foam (1) like (2) fixed some elastic around the, around the, around the 
headpiece, so we just had these hand - these homemade visors. 
Rose (26m) 
This reflects a wider issue of the shortage of adequate PPE both nationally 
(Dean, 2020; Campbell, 2020; Mason, 2020) and internationally (Triggle, 2020; 
WHO, 2020), particularly during the early stages of the pandemic. Although this 
shortage was also echoed by some of the reviewed studies (Fernndez-Castillo et 
al., 2021; Lapum et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2020), none of them discuss  having to 
resort to making their own PPE, as was necessary in the UK (Ford, 2020; Marsh, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
2020). Further, the discursive elements of the analysis in the present study also 
points to feeling let down by the system 
Jia et al. (2021), however, report that due to insufficient PPE, such as splash- 
proof respirators, some of the medical staff reduced the frequency of exposing 
themselves to reduce the chance of transmission. They also reported  that some of 
the medics worked slowly to avoid aerosols and becoming infected (Jia et al., 2021). 
Jane narrated how they had gowns at one point that we were joking,  they look 
like shrouds, like they were just plastic like nighties  as this was whatever we could 
get. Jane then narrated  how It was like you were wearing  a plastic  bag while trying 
to do your job. Although Jane told this story through light tone and humour - and she 
is not strongly complaining - the description and content of her talk allowed me to get 
a good grasp of what this may have been like for the nurses. The use of we were 
joking, with collective pronouns pointed to a shared identity, and an inside joke with 
others. Jane then  narrated  a story  of how it was only when someone higher up 
would not wear the existing PPE due to fears it was not sufficiently protective, that 
new PPE supplies were delivered: 
we had one night where we had to: (1) we were running like really, really short 
in PPE and they had to call in, they had to call some site manager or I honestly 
don't know who it was, but someone higher up. And the man came in, saw the 
PPE and was like, I'm not going on the ward in that. Like that wouldn't protect 
me. And so he then, within half an hour, we suddenly had loads of new PPE 
delivered, and for us, I think it's outrageous that they're happy for nurses to, to 
put themselves on that, and doctors that, that were on the ward, wear that PPE 
for however long but the second someone higher up comes in and says, no, 
that's not good enough, suddenly more PPE arrives and I just think it's, it's 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
actually quite disgusting that we're not treated in the same way that they want 
to be treated effectively. 
Jane (79m) 
Janes story further built on Roses, that nurses were let down by the system at 
times. However, Janes account takes a different turn. Whereas Roses story pointed 
to the initial depleted PPE supplies, Jane highlighted how there was adequate  PPE, 
but only when someone higher up requests better PPE, was this actioned. These 
stories illustrate a point not referenced in the existing literature, notably the broader 
narratives about nurses not being valued or heard (Catton,  2020; McIlroy, 2020), 
whilst being depicted as heroes in the media (BBC news,  2021a;  Clarke, 2021).  As 
of January 2021, at least 850 UK HCWs are reported to have died due to known 
COVID-19 infection between March and December 2020 (Berger, 2021). Further, in 
July 2020, Ford (2020) reported that England  and Wales  had the second highest 
death rate of HCWs due to known COVID-19 infection globally. 
Both Jane and Ellie narrated the practical difficulties of wearing PPE. They 
discussed their worries  about drinking too much water and needing  the toilet,  thus 
the donning and doffing of PPE again. This is consistent with other research that 
many HCWs reported feeling guilty about wasting PPE (Hoernke et al., 2021; 
Vindrola-Padros et al., 2020). It also appeared  that Jane and Ellie  constructed a 
sense of taken-for-granted understanding that I am not expecting them to talk of the 
challenges of PPE. For example, Jane said she remembered PPE more than the 
care of the patients. This is also suggested in Ellies account when she frequently 
uses the word actually interspersed with laughter: 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
losing that freedom of like actually, I want to drink water and then be able to go 
to the toilet when I need to, haha its like (2) it sounds like a silly thing but 
actually, thats actually one of the biggest things that I've found really difficult 
haha. 
Ellie (29m) 
However, unlike the other narratives, Amelia spoke of how her trust for the 
protections were a strength for her to work: 
So, the first day, I thought, so much fear, one thing is covid, because (2) but 
only thing Im encouraged the:: because the precautions help, so thats a 
strength for me to do, the work, starting, without fear for the covid spreading 
like that, like, cos we are, too much erm:: like, like a trust for the protections. 
Amelia (8m) 
Concerns over whether the nurses were adequately protected by PPE and the 
physical challenges of wearing it was discussed  in several studies  in the literature 
(Cui et al., 2020; Galehdar et al., 2020; Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020; Sheng et 
al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Leias talk was also in line with this. She first narrated 
that she was unsure whether the PPE was going  to protect her (I wasnt sure that 
the PPE are protecting us). She then moved on to talk about the impact physically 
(causing pressure sores; you can't breathe with your nose, you have to breathe 
with your mouth). Leia briefly interwove the psychological impact of wearing PPE 
within her talk of the physical discomfort (Im a bit claustrophobic), however, this 
was immediately followed by turning attention to the patients (just look after the 
patients in front of you (1) patients that are super sick and they are alone and, uh, 
you always feel like you're not doing, um, enough). This highlights how, despite the 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
clear challenges that came with PPE, both physically and psychologically, it 
appeared important for Leia to maintain professionality by drawing on broader 
nursing narratives and relating her story back to patient care. 
Despite  the difficulties of wearing PPE, when asked about  whether  there were 
any positive aspects of working during the pandemic, Leia also discussed  how the 
PPE led to communication barriers  disappearing  (the barrier  is no longer there). 
She told me how all the staff were dressed the same, it was easier to speak to others 
who were more senior (we (2) were all scared and we looked at each other and we, 
we all felt the same.). Leias talk pointed to PPE adding to the collective identity of 
the staff team in a positive way, and is an alternative to earlier stories of the 
prevalent hierarchies, as narrated by Jane. This storyline is novel, and not discussed 
in the reviewed literature. 
4.3.2.4 Nurses just sit around playing on their phones all day: The impact 
of public misconceptions. 
Stories of public misconceptions were woven throughout some of the accounts, 
particularly Janes, Ellies, Roses, and Leias. Jane narrated how she used social 
media to just having a bit of moan, basically, yet, this was met with quite a lot of 
negative comments from the public. Jane explained how she was told hospital 
wards are empty, just like (2), stop lying and like get over yourself, you signed up 
for this and nurses just sit around playing on their phones all day. Jane then 
narrated how I don't know what they think what we're doing because they think it's 
empty [the hospitals] (2) and that it doesn't exist [the virus]. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
This chimes with the contention in the media about covid deniers (BBC News, 
2021b; Giles, 2021), a storyline that Jane developed through her account. Jane then 
used a reflexive comment - or a concession (Mulholland, 1994): I like to think I'm an 
understanding person and that it must be hard for people to understand something 
that they're not seeing. Jane showing awareness of all sides and 
empathy, and continuing to uphold professionality,  further strengthened  her 
account. This is often used in the face of resistance (Mueller & Whittle, 2011) - or 
specific to the pandemic - other narratives which undermine the credibility of nurses 
accounts. 
Jane and Leia narrated feeling unsatisfied with the documentaries that were 
made about the pandemic: even some of the documentaries that were made, they 
just don't give th- the real experience and you can't really film like raw footage of 
actual patients dying or like having their bowels open in prone position (Jane) and 
what the media has covered probably is not what I would have expected, what I 
would have wanted (Leia). 
Rose referred to the media surrounding the hospital she was redeployed to as a 
media circus and a publicity stunt and how it had not shown how things really 
were. Rose then went on to say: 
the way that things have been portrayed to the public, was just completely 
inaccurate and I don't think it- it had really shown how things really were. Um, 
Im not saying (1) yeah, I guess, it was (3) I- I don't know. Um, but, but then, 
from what I've sort of read from other sections of the media, from the people 
who worked there, theyve, you know, have praised the [other hospital], said 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that it's amazing. You've had such a great time here, but I just couldn't help but 
think, but what were we at the same place? 
Rose (57m) 
Ellie, however, spoke about how the pandemic has prompted a shift in public 
awareness of the NHS: 
I think for a long time the NHS has been completely unappreciated or just 
taken for granted by (1) people and the public, generally.  Um, for, yeah, for like 
a long, long time and then this happened and people, I dont know, suddenly 
seem to realise like actually, I think the NHS is the best thing about this country 
and it's like people (2) yeah, will work and also, you know, put themselves at 
risk 
Ellie (47m) 
this is great that people are appreciating it but I just think as a profession as 
well, its not paid well enough or some of the (3) like, yeah, benefits of being in 
it (1) arent enough. And it was like, ah, the clapping stopped and then they (1) 
what they didn't give, they gave a lot of the other public sector a pay  rise and 
not nursing and I was like, that hurts haha 
Ellie (48m) 
Ellies talk highlighted how although the pandemic has prompted awareness of 
the NHS, there is a sense of this appreciation being too little too late, particularly 
given people (assumed to be nurses) do not get paid enough and will put 
themselves at risk  possibly linked to a sense of duty and commitment to patient 
care. The use of laughter could be managing what may be perceived as an 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
overreaction (again, in the face of broader counter-narratives), which Edwards 
(2005) proposes can strengthen a complaints basis, or perhaps making an 
uncomfortable story easier to narrate. 
In contrast with the reviewed studies, this research discussed the role of public 
misconceptions related to covid deniers.  Whilst  two of the reviewed studies 
discussed the role of the public (Galehdar et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020), these were 
different themes to the ones in the current study. For example, Galehdar et al. (2020) 
discuss that nurses reported public ignorance of the preventative measures, and 
nurses reported that this led to anxiety. The nurses in this study reported  wanting 
media footage to scare the public into adhering  to measures  (Galehdar  et al., 
2020). Lee and Lee (2020), however, state that nurses were met with criticism when 
they became diagnosed with COVID-19, questioning whether they correctly removed 
their PPE, or criticism re whether  HCWs could go to places such as restaurants  or 
the gym. 
Of note is that storylines of frustration about the media coverage did not arise in 
Anna or Amelias accounts. It may be relevant that Anna and Amelia were the two 
redeployed, non-ICU trained nurses who, at the time of the interview, had worked 
several days in ICU. Although they both reported facing many challenges during their 
time on the ICU, it is likely that they were not  required  to sustain  the level of work 
over several months. Furthermore, it may be relevant to consider, due to being 
redeployed, whether  or not they feel entitled  or credible  to make claims about 
public misconceptions and the role of the media. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
4.3.2.5 If we call them heroes then that will fix everything: Grappling with 
discourses of war and heroes. 
Another thread throughout the accounts was a negotiation of positions  on the 
media discourses, such as the health care workers as heroes narratives and war 
metaphors. Whilst Rose and Jane drew on these metaphors in their talk, (it was just 
honestly like a war zone  Rose) and (you're walking into the enemy effectively but 
then it's a person that needs your care - Jane), Leia and Ellie grappled with their 
position in this regard. 
Although Leia first described that when people look at you with admiration it felt 
good, this shifted  as her narrative developed.  In addition  to the challenges 
reported, Leias talk pointed to social isolation. Using active voicing (Wooffitt, 1992), 
she told a story of being in a supermarket that told NHS workers whatever you 
touch, you need to buy, because you may be contagious. She then went on to 
say theyre saying that were heroes but actually, theyre looking at us now like 
were the ones spreading the disease. This is consistent with Lee and Lee (2020), 
where nurses reported discrimination in their daily lives and  that others  were 
avoiding them. This speaks to the broader narratives at the time around the public 
perception of HCWs, which are particularly important in a pandemic where 
community-centred care is reported to be necessary over the patient-centered care 
model which dominates in Western healthcare systems (Nacoti et al., 2020). A mixed 
methods study (Dye et al., 2020) noted that HCWs reported experiencing COVID-19 
related stigma in relation  to being  perceived as carriers  of the virus. Leia  then 
offered an alternative to the hero narrative: ideally, I would like us, all of us, to be 
recognised as professionals, highly skilled professionals more than heroes. Here, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
the use of ideally constructed a sense that she does not currently feel valued  at 
work or by society.  Soon after, Leia  discussed  the medias use  of military discourse: 
people  say they do the comparison with being  at, at war with covid or being at 
war, with a real war that we had with the veterans and stuff, but no, its not the 
same. Its a totally different scenario, its a very tricky situation. But now, 
personally, I dont  like to be called a hero, uh, at all. I, I like to be recognised as 
a professional with lots of skills and the ability to look after and care for these 
patients. All they would like is that we would be recognised and, uh, and valued 
for that more than just being celebrated, uh:: with clapping. Also, the NHS 
discount everywhere. Yes, its nice or when I just skipping the queue at the 
supermarket. I've, I've never felt comfortable doing it. 
Leia (29m) 
Ellie narrated a similar story: 
They used a lot of the like war language and it was like, even, you know, like 
the heroes in the frontline and I don't know, there was a lot of links to like the 
war. But it did just feel as well it was like(1) or, you know, a lot like, quite a lot of 
NHS staff died and then it was kind of, yeah, like linking back to a war and I 
was like, this is different though, like people didn't sign up to this. 
Ellie (50m) 
Ellie: I'm glad that then the NHS and nursing staff and like have that maybe 
newfound kind of respect, but actually calling people heroes doesn't fix  
anything if you're not then going to give them PPE, and (2) I don't know. So I 
guess tinged as well with there was kind of like, oh, but, you know, they, they're 
just nurses, so actually, if we call them heroes then that will fix everything?, and 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
it's like, no actually, you still need to provide the PPE and give people adequate 
breaks and decent like working conditions 
Ellie (51m) 
Leia and Ellies stories speak to the broader issue of how nurses were showed 
gratitude yet continued not to be valued. As Leia stated, she hoped to be valued for 
that more than just being celebrated. This relates to the work of Cox (2020) who 
writes that the HCWs as heroes narrative is inappropriate  as a nurses  duty  to treat 
is not limitless, and therefore proposes that a clumsy use of this rhetoric can stifle 
discussion on what this limit is. Further, Cox (2020) also states that heroism involves 
voluntary action and a degree of some sort of risk (Cox, 2020; Urmson, 1958)  
something which Ellie explicitly countered (people didnt sign up to this). This  too 
was echoed by Jane (we didn't sign up to fight a pandemic, like I signed up to be an 
ITU nurse). Mathers and Kitchen (2020) write how the hero narrative, endorsed by 
the Government, deflects responsibility of how the pandemic was handled. These 
stories continue to build on narratives previously told, particularly by Jane and Rose, 
related to how during the pandemic, nurses  had been  forgotten (Bettiza,  2020; 
Slavitt, 2020), silenced and exploited (Daly et al., 2020). A recent discourse analysis 
(Mohammed et al., 2021) states the hero discourse is not a neutral expression of 
recognition of gratitude, but rather a politically, culturally and socially  convenient 
device employed to normalise the dangers nurses were exposed to, in spite  of low 
pay (Clarke, 2021; Gunawan, 2020; Munn, 2020). Mohamed et al. (2021) also 
propose that the hero rhetoric positions  nurses  to make necessary  sacrifices 
without sufficient recognition of the emotional, physical and ethical challenges. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
By contrast, Lee and Lee (2020) argue that public support was a strong motivator 
for the nurses. However, the authors heavy use of war language for the title of the 
proposed themes such as pushed onto the battlefield without any preparation and 
unexpectedly long war is disproportionate  to the amount of war language  apparent  
in the participant excerpts, suggesting less contention related to this rhetoric. The 
storyline (and counter-narrative) in the present study, that nurses contended with the 
military and heroes discourses, adds a novel layer to the existing literature. 
4.3.2.6 No ones had a break: Unrelenting work and exhaustion. 
For the nurses, during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a relentlessness to the 
work as the nation embarked on the second wave. This was a particularly prominent 
story in the accounts of the ICU-trained nurse who sustained the level of work for 
many months. Exhaustion due to the intensity of the work was hampered not only by 
the repeated cancellation of annual leave, but also the restoration of routine hospital 
activities due to the earlier cancellation of routine work while COVID-19 treatment 
needed to be prioritised. 
Jane narrated how she felt angry as annual leave was being cancelled and 
that no ones had a break, she then explained: 
people are having time off because theyre sick, probably because theyre 
burnt out, theyre, you know, run down. Um, and you just think, well, what (2) I 
don't know, not- not forgotten but I think  at the beginning  everyone, you know, it 
was sort of the claps for the nurses and, or clap for carers, then (2) you know, all 
the donations and stuff and then suddenly, you're still working through it, 
through a pandemic and I think people forget almost and, um, and I'm not 
saying we've had it harder than other people (1) at all, but you do just think, 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
actually, do people realise like how long this has gone on for us and (2) we've 
actually not had a break and, and we've, you know, have, have we (3) been 
asked if we are OK? 
Jane (50m) 
Although Jane began this story  by narrating  how she did  not think the nurses 
were forgotten (not forgotten) and how at the start there were the claps for the 
nurses and all the donations and stuff, this then  shifted: you're still working 
through it, through a pandemic and I think people forget, pointing to her fatigue and 
weariness. Jane then narrated I'm not saying we've had it harder than other people, 
which is similar to Roses talk (I don't really like to moan; nobody really had 
a- cared about us, really and we were just expected to get on with it). Jane initially 
saying not forgotten and Roses I dont really like to moan may function as an 
another hedge (Weatherall, 2011), suggesting one is not fully committed to what 
follows in their talk. This points to the management of the anticipation of potential 
criticism (Edwards, 2005), particularly within the broader context of contention such  
as covid deniers and anti-science rhetoric (Miller, 2020) which may potentially 
undermine nurses accounts (Oliver, 2021a;  2021b).  Jane and Rose both 
constructed identities of professionals who do not complain, yet make a clear point: 
nurses are tired and need a break. 
In line with the demand-control support (DCS) model (Karasek & Theorell, 1990) 
and the job demands-resources (JD-R) model (Demerouti et al. 2001) which propose 
that high work demands contribute  to stress,  Ellie  discussed  the relentlessness  of 
the work: everyone is just going to burnout. This also mirrors that not having 
sufficient relaxation time can impact nurses health (Khan et al., 2018). Ellie also 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
highlighted how nurses were asked whether they wanted to work extra shifts for 
payment, which was nice, but led to many working an insane amount of hours 
and this could be a dangerous, slippery slope. Not only does Ellies story make 
relevant the high workload and low resources, but also her awareness of the impact 
the quantity and intensity of work were likely to have on nurses wellbeing. 
Heavy workload is echoed by much of the literature on nurses experiences 
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cui et al., 2020; Fernndez-Castillo et al.,  2021; 
Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020; Sun et al., 2020;  Tan et al., 2020). Notably, Sun 
et al. (2020) report that working hours increased up to two times normal work hours 
and workloads. Further, Britt et al. (2021) discusses how with social distancing 
restrictions in place, not only do nurses work longer working hours but personal 
resources, such as social support, were not as available as they usually would be, 
which further contributed to distress (Britt et al., 2021). This is also in line with the JD-
R model, which proposes that social support helps an individual manage stress. 
Fernndez-Castillo et al. (2021) discuss that nurses reported a particularly high 
increase in workload compared to other HCWs, such as doctors and nursing 
assistants, due to their training and ability to perform a broader range of tasks. This 
also speaks to Janes earlier comment about nurses acting beyond  their competency 
in terms of relatively unfamiliar tasks such as proning. 
Rose also talked about the unrelenting work that the nurses faced, which 
continued even after discharging the last COVID-19 patient: 
Everything has kind of gone back to normal. But if anything, I think people are 
now, theyre so knackered, um, because when I was saying about when we 
discharged our last covid patient sort of back in July, um (2) when we had that 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
weekend to deep clean the unit, on the Monday, they then just restarted all of 
the normal activities, um, but if anything, more intensely so. 
so, yeah, we are already knackered from like covid and then just:: ugh. Going 
back to what we normally do, but it was just a lot more intense because they 
were all operating  on more  patients that  were just much more sick. Um, yes, 
there was, there was just no reprieve and, and a lot of people have left, 
actually. Um, which was to be expected, you know. 
Rose (80m) 
Roses agentless (Hardt-Mautner, 1995) talk: everything has kind of gone back 
to normal) de-emphasises hers and others control, reflecting the broader fatigue 
following the intensity of the work. Rose  also highlighted  the impact the pandemic 
has had on the restoration of routine treatment in the NHS - that patients are just 
much more sick  a national issue (Carr et al., 2021; Bhangu et al., 2020; NHS, 
2021). This has led to reduced activity in light of continuing infection control 
measures (Edwards, 2020; British Medical Association, 2021), poor outcomes for 
patients and significant financial repercussions (Macdonald et al., 2020) in a 
chronically underfunded health system (Catton, 2020). 
Perhaps surprisingly, the psychological impact on nurses of returning to usual 
activities post-pandemic is not discussed in any of the reviewed studies. This may be 
linked to the time point at which many of the studies were conducted  all between 
January 2020 and September 2020 - likely in the active phase of the pandemic (as 
proposed by the BPS COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing Group, 2020) where perhaps the 
nurses focus was more focused on managing pandemic itself. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
By contrast, stories of the unrelenting nature of the work do not feature in the 
accounts of Amelia and Anna. This may be related to how, at the point of interview, 
they had worked several days in ICU during the pandemic, compared to the other 
nurses who were required to sustain this level of work for longer. 
4.4.3 Looking back, looking forward. 
4.4.3.1 Its shown me how strong I am: Stories of growth. 
To questions about whether anything positive came from the working the 
pandemic, and how they see themselves looking into the future, some of the nurses 
painted a picture of the experience as a turning point: one with many challenges, but 
also with growth. Rose and Anna discussed their professional identities: 
I feel like anything can happen and I'm sure I'll be able to deal with it. Because 
I feel like throughout covid, there were so many (1) you know, things that 
happened suddenly and unexpectedly that we just had to deal with. Um, so in 
that way, I feel like I'm much better equipped to sort of deal with emergency 
situations. Um, so I guess its, um, you know, Ive become a better nurse 
because of it. Um, um, and because I had to look after so many people at the 
[other hospital] and [hospital site], um, I guess my management skills are a lot 
better. Um, I feel much more comfortable in terms of like mentoring sort of 
junior nurses, um, because I had experience of doing it during covid. 
Rose (87m) 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
this time it's kind of like more closer because when someone gets sick, 
someone we know that's being isolated, someone we know being::, um- um, 
infected by this covid, we kind of like text them like, how are you? or call them 
if we have a chance and, um, you kind of wanted to help them out, bring food 
or, you know, deliver the groceries or whatever. So I think this covid give (1) 
most of us a sense of, um, like caring, you know, not only because we work 
together, we kinda::: It's like a kind of, a different kind of family, I would say 
Anna (55m) 
Anna also narrated valuing health and family over material things: 
material things now is nothing, you know, because you can't get, you can get 
out now to where you are very expensive things, but(1) yeah, health is number 
one and everyone in the family is OK, so yeah. 
Anna (57m) 
Jane and Leia discussed a shift in life priorities and an appreciation for life: 
I feel like proud that I've been part of it and Ive- I have learnt from it 100 
percent, and I think it's shown me how strong I am, like, um, to be able to get 
through this, um, and I guess just like an appreciation for life. 
Jane (97m) 
definitely to appreciate more that you are healthy and that you are not going 
through covid, em, being more conscious about:: wh-what, what are your 
priorities, what is really important in life for you. Um, so something material 
comes last, don't care much about having designer outfits or something that I 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
would have asked for Christmas before, for example haha. Um, I don't care 
about having the last iPhones or the last iPads. Uh, but if you-you focus a bit 
more about, on your, on the people, the person that are important for you in 
your life. 
Leia (46m) 
If, if we were to disappear in a couple a weeks time or a couple of months, 
would we be happy with our lives? So that's being brave to have those 
conversation, and also asking the other, the people they, that are important for 
me if theyre happy and if theyre not happy, OK, what can we do?. 
Leia (57m) 
Amelia narrated that she felt pride in being able to contribute to the pandemic: 
I think I proud actually because its been long time and I: one thing Im proud, 
one thing Im happy cos I can contribute my something like that, I 
feelsatisfaction, so I am not like negative feelings, If I do. I dont know I get a 
positive feeling, Im satisfied (3) thats why. Yeah. 
Amelia (65m) 
By contrast, Ellies response was different in that she appeared more unsure. To 
my question as to whether working in the pandemic has  brought  positive  change, 
she initially answered no, I don't, I don't think so. However, this was followed by I 
guess sometimes you don't like, you don't really know how youre going to cope with 
stuff or like, I don't know, do stuff until you're forced to. A briefer and vaguer answer 
than the others, my question may have been a difficult one to answer, given the 
ongoing nature of the pandemic. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
The stories  above reflect quest  narratives  (Frank, 1995), which is consistent 
with the literature on PTG (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1995) suggesting  that encounters 
with adversity can lead to personal growth. Yet it is important to hold  in mind the 
social conventions which may affect what stories are told, notably the social and 
cultural pressures to tell  stories  of quest  (Frank, 1995), particularly  when someone 
is being directly asked about positive change  in an interview context (and by 
someone unfamiliar). Furthermore, it is also worth considering that stories of 
restitution and quest may also be underpinned by working in a setting underpinned 
by a medical model  that there is a remedy for suffering. 
All but two of the reviewed studies (Galehdar et al., 2020; Kackin et al., 2020) 
report that nurses described positive growth or change from working during the 
pandemic, although this was to differing degrees. Of note is that Galehdar  et al. 
(2020) focused on psychological distress  whereas  Kackin et al. (2020) focused on 
the short term coping strategies employed by nurses. With much of the international 
literature reporting on elements of growth, this may reflect how compelling stories of 
quest are across cultures. 
4.4.3.2 There was this whole talk of the second wave: An ending out of 
reach. 
With the interviews taking place between December - February 2021, the 
pandemic was very much still live. Indeed, for many of the nurses, the accounts 
point to how a neat finale to the pandemic was still out of reach. 
For Rose, with the interview taking place in early December 2020, as the 
infections numbers were beginning to increase again: 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
people can't even be bothered to talk anymore. Um (3) yeah (2) I think people 
are just, are just really exhausted and just:: yeah, just a bit kind of over the 
whole, whole fucking covid thing. Sorry, I shouldnt have sworn haha. 
Rose (84m) 
If I (2) everyones just like, If I hear the words covid or coronavirus one more 
time, then Ill just (2) And there was this whole talk of the second wave and 
people are sort of, for Gods sake, please, no. Like, like wed barely just 
gotten over the first wave and then to, to have talk of it happening all over 
again,  people were just, Oh my God, please dont.  Like I dont  think I can deal 
with this. And even I thought, I don't want you to think Ive got the:: the 
strength(1) t- to do this again. Um, I don't think it will happen in quite the same 
scale, but um,  yeah, when things  were a bit, you know, there was just talk of it 
happening again and people just thought, oh my God, no, please (2). Yeah. 
Rose (85m) 
For Rose, there is a clear shift in her story throughout  the interview,  from her  
initial  motivation  and excitement (part of me was kind of excited) to, in the face of a 
looming threat of a further wave, later constructing  a story  of extreme exhaustion 
(oh my God, please dont. Like I dont think I can deal with this.). Despite this, 
however, it continued to be important for Rose to not be seen to complain, 
overwhelmed or in any way unprofessional: Sorry, I shouldnt have sworn haha. 
Roses tone briefly shifted slightly by embedding a glimmer of hope  (I don't think  it 
will happen  in quite  the same scale) within these  worries of a further wave. Perhaps 
with the hope of trying to make her story more hopeful for me as the listener, and for 
herself. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Janes interview took place in February 2021 as the second wave was beginning 
& g to ease off: 
I do feel stronger coming out, I'm saying coming out the other side, I know 
we're still in the pandemic,  um, and I'm not saying, you know, I have hope  that 
haha it's going to start to ease because it, it hasn't. [Hospital site] at the 
moment  its  starting to ease now, um, so I guess I'm hopeful  and if it goes back 
into a full-blown (2) you know, numbers raising again and maybe I'll feel a bit 
different because Ill, I'll start to lose hope again and feel like, how long is this 
going to go on for 
Jane (105m) 
Like Rose, Jane particularly pointed to there being no end in sight (how long is 
this going to gone on for). Laughter was also woven into her account, perhaps 
making an uncomfortable story easier to narrate (particularly as it was drawing to a 
close), or building on the storyline of not being seen to complain too much 
(Edwards, 2005). 
By contrast, Leia (ICU-trained but had returned to specialising in another 
department) and Anna (redeployed nurse who had returned to her usual department) 
narrated different stories. They both continued to draw on narratives of the heroic 
genre (Kelly, 1994) when they spoke about the prospect of returning to ICU to work 
during the pandemic: but then, if the pandemic takes over, Im ready to go back to 
critical care and do that (Leia) and yeah, I don't mind to help out. I know it's going 
to be a tough one again, but I think we are more ready for it than the first one 
(Anna). 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Future uncertainty, on individual, healthcare systems, national and international 
levels was a theme in the study by Feeley  et al. (2021).  As discussed  in Chapter 
One, uncertainty about the future is not explicitly captured in the models of 
occupational stress. However, stories of uncertainty draw parallels to the DCS model 
(Karasek & Theorell, 1990) that asserts that wellbeing is low when workers are faced 
with high work demands and low control over work. This storyline aligns with the 
psychological response phases (BPS COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing  Group), whereby 
the proposed recovery phase  and anticipatory  anxiety phases  may not be 
sequential depending on the course of the pandemic. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
5.1 Chapter Overview 
Chapter Five: Conclusions 
This chapter summarises the analysis, considers the strengths and limitations of 
the study, and discusses my reflections on conducting this research. I then discuss 
future research suggestions and recommendations for clinical practice. 
5.2 Summary of the Analysis 
This research explored the narratives of six nurses  to address  two questions: 
firstly, how nurses who worked in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic construct this 
experience,  and secondly, to explore what identities  are constructed in their 
narratives. 
Within the individual accounts, narratives included: initially underestimating the 
pandemic, changes in patient procedures, fear, duty, inability to provide the usual 
standard of care, juggling home and work life, use of social media as an outlet, 
negotiating positions on war and hero discourses, and personal growth. 
From considering the accounts collectively, three broad stories were observed: 1. 
It came with like a bang, 2. Working in the red zone, and 3. Looking back, looking 
forward. The substories are summarised below. 
5.3 Summary of The    Substories 
Stories of the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic were constructed as a sudden, 
unexpected disruption, with emotionally and morally fraught decisions that needed to 
be made early in the pandemic. The performance element of the analysis in this 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
study takes the existing literature further; in highlighting nurses use of discursive 
devices, they construct identities as plausible narrators with accounts that need to be 
taken seriously. 
Whilst the existing literature discusses nurses duty to work in the pandemic, this 
topic is explored more in-depth in the present study.  Similar to the literature,  duty 
had different nuances such as professional commitment (Cui et al., 2020; Goh et al., 
2020), and an obligation (Lee & Lee, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Exploring the 
construction of identities has drawn out more fully the sometimes-contradictory 
impacts of identities, such as ones duty professionally, and to ones own health and 
their family (Kherbache et al., 2021). This study also  illuminates  the role of 
hierarchies within healthcare teams, which also contributed to nurses sense of 
obligation and duty.  
This also may speak to psychological theory such as social identity theory 
(Tajfel & Turner, 1986), where ones sense of who they are is based on their group 
membership. For example, this is may suggested in the collective identity of the ITU 
trained nurses - which may have been protective - and those redeployed nurses, in 
turn, may have been positioned as the other. Another theory potentially relevant 
here is the narrative construction of identity. Hinchman and Hinchman (2001) state 
that all narratives involve positioning the self in relation to the other and, therefore, 
constructs ones identity, in the context of broader social discourses. For example, 
nurses narrating how they felt a duty to work during the pandemic may speak to 
broader discourses of nurses as heroes on the front line.  
As the accounts continued, stories of facing many challenging  situations  relating 
to patient care further drew out the tensions between identities and appeared to 
contribute to moral distress (Greenberg et al. 2020). These challenges echo the 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
literature (Fernndez-Castillo et al., 2021; Galehdar  et al., 2020;  Jia et al., 2021; Tan 
et al., 2020). However, exploring performance in the present study adds another 
dimension, notably how  the nurses  worked to present  themselves  as credible but 
not complainers in the face of broader contention. This speaks to how, although 
nurses appear calm and professional, we must not take this at face value. 
This study explored the redeployment of nurses from the perspective of both ICU- 
trained nurses and those non-ICU trained,  redeployed  nurses.  This  is not discussed 
in the literature. Lack of adequate support (for those  redeployed),  and not being  able 
to provide adequate support (for those ICU trained) contributed to distress. The 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
performance aspect also further builds on how it remained important for nurses to 
uphold professionality and to not complain. 
This study supports the COVID-19 literature on the physical and psychological 
challenges of wearing PPE and  fears about  whether it was protective (Cui et al., 
2020; Galehdar et al., 2020; Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020; Sheng et al., 2020; 
Zhang et al., 2020). However, this study  went further in illuminating  how depleted 
PPE led the nurses to be creative to make their own PPE to ensure their safety. This 
alluded to broader narratives that nurses felt let down by the system at times, and 
subsequently not valued. Another novel storyline that adds to the research was how 
PPE led to the disappearance of communication barriers,  which added  to the sense 
of collective identity. 
The present study brings attention to the impact of public misconceptions and 
media portrayals  something that goes beyond the existing literature. It appeared 
important for nurses to uphold professionality, despite their frustrations at other 
narratives undermining their accounts. This points to how the nurses were treading 
carefully when conveying the many challenging situations they encountered. 
Several nurses narrated frustration at the media for their portrayals, notably the 
military and heroes metaphors, which also is a novel contribution to the literature. 
This storyline ties into others - specifically public misconceptions and inadequate 
PPE  all of which speak to broader issues of nurses being exploited and ignored, 
despite being depicted as heroes (Catton, 2020; McIlroy, 2020; Slavitt, 2020). 
This study highlights that high workload contributed  to stress  for nurses  (Cui et 
al., 2020; Fernndez-Castillo et al., 2021; Goh et al., 2020; Lee & Lee, 2020; Sun et 
al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020). Stories of the repeated cancellation of annual leave 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
hampered the already demanding  work, further perpetuating  frustrations.  It also 
brings into focus the juggling of  identities  between  ones  professional  role and 
looking after ones own wellbeing. The present study also highlights the impact of the 
relentlessness of the work stemming from the immediate restoration  of non-COVID- 
19 patient care. 
Across the accounts were stories of personal growth (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1995) 
which supports  all but two of the reviewed studies  (Galehdar et al., 2020;  Kackin et 
al., 2020). Many described feeling more confident professionally, pride in making a 
contribution, and a stronger sense of teamwork. Others described an appreciation for 
life and a shift in life priorities such as valuing ones  family and health.  Yet this 
appears to be the only study that comments on the cultural pressures to tell stories 
of quest (Frank, 1995). 
In parallel to stories of growth, the nurses narrated  the perils  of a future wave of 
the pandemic. For those returning  to other  departments  within the hospital,  they 
again narrated a clear commitment to return to ICU if needed, reflecting a need to 
continue to construct a professional identity. Others, however, constructed stories of 
exhaustion and dread. This was highlighted through the studys focus on temporality, 
which focused on the nurses imagined future, and aligns  with Feeley  et al. (2021) 
that future uncertainty about the trajectory of the pandemic contributed to distress. 
5.4 Quality Assessment 
Consistent with the appraisal of the existing literature, I assessed the quality and 
rigour of this study using Tracys (2010) quality assessment (Appendix T). 
5.4.1 Strengths. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
By exploring how nurses, within a UK NHS context, construct their experiences of 
working in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic, this research adds  a new layer to 
the existing literature. The performative aspect of the analysis takes the literature 
further, notably that amid the broader contention, nurses appeared to present 
themselves as credible, professional  narrators,  who are not  complaining.  The 
study of performance also illuminates  the juggling  of competing  identities  not 
explored as fully in the literature, including the good nurse, good mother, and the 
skilled ICU nurse. The temporal dimension of narrative invited stories about how the 
nurses perceive their uncertain future. 
This study recruited from a specialist hospital. With expertise in cardiac and 
respiratory conditions, surgery, and ICU, the hospital cared for some of the most 
unwell patients with COVID-19 disease.  Yet, even despite  this expertise  in 
respiratory conditions, the nurses were faced with a novel virus. Nurses not only had 
to learn about COVID-19 disease and provide  complex care, but were also  faced 
with a sense of threat to themselves, and risk of infecting others. 
5.4.2 Limitations. 
A notable limitation relates to conducting the systematic literature review. Despite 
narrowing down my search with inclusion and exclusion criteria, the initial search 
results were large (n = 1770) and many unrelated papers were captured (n = 1715). 
This is likely a reflection of being a novice researcher, and in the future, I would re- 
think search terms to appropriately narrow down the literature. 
Whilst conducting a topic that is so current has many advantages, it also comes 
with its challenges. With the rapidly evolving literature, it was, at times, hard to keep 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
pace. It was important to put in place strict time boundaries for the literature review, 
however, this will inevitably mean the project will be limited in scope. 
     The initial difficulties with recruitment were a limitation. This may be linked to the 
stage of the pandemic in December 2020, during the resurgence of the second 
wave, when nurses basic safety needs were not being met. This may highlight how 
more basic safety needs need to be met first before they feel able to engage in 
wellbeing services. A further limitation relates to the demographics of the sample. In 
particular, all nurses were women, which may have influenced the content and 
performance aspect of the stories.  
5.5 Ethical Tensions 
Although there were initial recruitment difficulties, after a few months,  more 
nurses expressed an interest in the study. However, due to only having capacity to 
interview six nurses, I was unable to interview some nurses. Whilst  it was made 
explicit that not all those who express an interest will be interviewed, it felt 
uncomfortable to turn away nurses who offered to share their stories with me. Timing 
may be relevant here. As I began recruitment in October 2020, at the start of the 
resurgence of the second wave, it may be that at this point,  nurses  basic  physical 
and emotional safety needs were not met (Maslow, 1970), and therefore may have 
struggled to reflect on their experiences. A further tension has been related to the 
timing and socio-political context of this research, particularly between the nurses 
narratives and prevailing political  and public discourses. I have had to hold in mind 
the audience of this thesis, who will have their own lens which may be very different to 
the meaning behind the nurses narratives. However, I feel strongly of my ethical 
responsibility to honour (and not censor) the nurses stories. It is important to state 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that this dilemma arises  not through the content of the accounts, but through a highly 
emotive and politically sensitive climate, and the different interpretations that this gives 
rise to. This also speaks to how social constructionist approaches are inevitably 
political (Gergen, 1999). Relatedly, whilst every effort was taken to preserve 
anonymity of the nurses and third parties, some nurses did not want me to change 
certain aspects of narratives, although they were aware this may compromise their 
anonymity.  
5.6 Reflections 
The reader will notice from earlier chapters that I anticipated trauma to appear in 
the nurses stories (something which surprised me). This makes relevant the work of 
Johnstone (2020b; Johnstone & Hickox, 2021) that the trauma and PTSD narratives 
have been overstated. The interview may not have set up this type of talk. For 
example, perhaps  those  who were on the hospital site when the interview took place, 
emotional expression or certain narratives did not feel authorised in such contexts. It 
is also  worth considering whether nurses felt they could have included  this  in their  
talk, if they were experiencing more severe trauma reactions. Additionally, perhaps 
those that were experiencing more severe trauma experiences  were unlikely  to want 
(or able) to engage in interview. Another factor may be the importance for nurses to 
convey themselves as polite, professional, and not a complainer. That said,  
however, perhaps if the nurses were experiencing more severe trauma reactions, 
they would have conveyed this in the interview to convey the distress of the 
experience. Although it did not appear in the present study, many nurses may have 
been experiencing cumulative trauma (Khan, 1963, revisited by Martin et al., 2011) 
particularly given the ongoing nature of the pandemic  and the absence of an 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
ending - and the cumulative stressors this brings. Despite this, many of the nurses 
still narrated stories of quest (Frank, 1995), which may reflect the culture 
pressures to tell narratives of self-development and positive change. Frank (1995) 
originally developed his work for those living with long-term health conditions. Yet 
there appear to be parallels between living with a long-term condition and learning 
to live in world with a pandemic  adjustment to both involving a degree acceptance 
and long-term management.  
I have been aware of the authorial responsibility I hold in how I have chosen in 
how to present the analysis in this thesis. Striving towards credible research, it was 
important to ensure that I was not over-interpreting the data. Relatedly, although I 
explored distinct  features across accounts,  there was an element of grouping 
certain stories together. I wondered whether this may be perceived as though the 
meaning behind the stories were similar, which would be at odds with the projects 
constructionist lens. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
I notice that I found certain accounts and storylines more compelling than others, 
which raises the issue of there being stories I was not hearing. For the accounts that 
consisted of more fragmented, brief stories with little detail, I felt an urge to represent 
them in a way that would be easier to follow for the reader. This is linked to what 
Aarikka-Stenroos (2010) calls narrative smoothing. However, this would raise the 
issue of me imposing my voice on anothers more so than I did with the other 
accounts. 
Similar to the nurses I interviewed,  I have both  questioned  and drawn on 
dominant language. For example, whilst an important storyline from this analysis  in 
this research was the grappling with the use of military terminology and the heroes 
discourse, I have used wartime and natural disaster terminology  within this thesis. 
This includes the use of language redeployed and the tsunami metaphor of waves. 
Yet this is not without consideration;  I have used  war metaphors  where the nurses 
did not specifically critique this language in the interviews, and in order to convey 
meaning easily. In keeping with a reflexive approach, it has been important for me to 
reflect on my use of language, why I have felt attuned to some over others, and how 
my experiences may have shaped this. 
Conducting pandemic-related research whilst in a pandemic has at times been 
difficult. Particularly at the start of the pandemic, I experienced anxiety about myself 
and my family contracting the virus. This influenced the co-construction of the 
accounts. For example, I was aware that in some interviews I asked more questions 
about the demographics of the patients treated, checking whether I or my family fit 
the profile. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
5.7 What Now? Implications of This Research 
Given the constructionist lens to this research whereby knowledge is viewed as 
context-dependent (Burr & Dick, 2017), care needs to be taken when thinking about 
generalisability. However, this research has relevance and implications to consider. 
5.7.1 Basic safety needs. 
5.7.1.1 Unmasking the mask: The safety of PPE and beyond. 
Basic safety needs need to be considered to support nurses in feeling able to 
provide adequate patient care. As stated above, the initial recruitment difficulties 
encountered in this study highlight that basic physical and emotional safety needs 
should  be prioritised first, prior to wellbeing services (Maslow, 1970). This research 
has highlighted the importance of meeting nurses basic physical and emotional safety 
needs. This includes adequate and sufficient PPE, not only so that nurses are and feel 
protected, but also so they can stay hydrated and use the toilet without feeling guilty 
they are wasting PPE. 
PPE appeared to provide protection,  physically  and to some extent 
psychologically. At the time of writing, ICU nurses continue to wear full PPE and 
patient visitors are only permitted in extreme circumstances,  such as potentially  end 
of life care. However, with the easing of these restrictions  and although  visitors 
might reduce the burden of emotional support for patients on nurses - there is the 
benefit of emotional support with increased visitors - there  is potential  this may 
infiltrate nurses sense of physical safety. Nurses may benefit from emotional support 
for this. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
5.7.1.2 Protected time for breaks. 
Nurses require protected time for breaks and respite from the inevitably high 
workload. This would ensure nurses basic needs of toileting and rest are met, help 
support psychological wellbeing due to exposure to traumatic situations, and reduce 
physical exhaustion. Adequate staffing would also permit staff to take annual leave 
when needed (British Medical Association, 2021). 
5.7.1.3 Adequate training and clear information. 
In line with the DCS model (Karasek & Theorell, 1990) which proposed that 
wellbeing is most impacted when workers have high demands and perceived low 
control, adequate support and training needs should be made available to both ICU- 
trained and non-ICU-trained redeployed nurses, particularly for unfamiliar and novel 
tasks. Redeployed nurses may benefit from the implementation of a mentor system. 
Nurses also require clear and concise information to support  them  in feeling in 
control. This would also fit with the person-environment fit (P-E fit) model (Caplan, 
1987) that an individuals abilities  need  to be matched with their  abilities  for 
wellbeing. 
5.7.1.4 Emotional safety needs. 
This study has pointed to the protectiveness of a collective identity and the 
importance of nurses sense of belonging (Kings Fund, 2020b). Ongoing 
encouragement of supportive team working would be beneficial, particularly given 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that ICU nursing comes with emotional distress (Mealer et al., 2007; Poncet et al., 
2007). It is important to mitigate further distress, for example, handover meetings to 
check in with staff about whether they feel able return to the red zone. 
The narratives highlight the emotional toll of nurses. More spaces to support 
nurses emotional wellbeing within working hours are needed. This could include 
reflective rounds, safety huddles, reflective supervision, check-ins with peer 
mentors, or more informal spaces to decompress with colleagues. 
Hearing the voices of nurses needs to be balanced with recognising that due to 
physical and emotional exhaustion, they may not be able to tell others what they 
need. Therefore, it would be beneficial for psychologists and managers to adopt an 
active rather than passive approach of waiting for nurses to approach them. 
5.7.1.5 Longer-term community support. 
The nurses told stories of how they  valued donations  and deliveries  to the 
hospital, such as food, drink and toiletries. Whilst  this  was helpful in the short  term, 
as the second wave loomed, this appeared to stop suddenly despite the pandemic 
continuing, which contributed to the nurses stories of being forgotten. With the 
pandemic ongoing, and nurses facing the repercussions  of the pandemic in the form 
of intensely restoring routine treatments, donations could be spaced out over time to 
support the ongoing sense of feeling valued for their work. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
5.7.2 Wellbeing services: Spaces to share stories. 
Nurses were, and still are, playing a critical role in healthcare during  the 
pandemic, despite the dangers of doing so. This study has contributed to the 
conversations around how it may be possible to protect the wellbeing of nurses. The 
arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic sits against  a backdrop of a healthcare  system 
that has long been underfunded (Catton, 2020) with chronic difficulties with the 
recruitment and retention of ICU nurses (Khan et al., 2018; RCN, 2021b; NHS 
Employers, 2015). ICU services cannot run without ICU nurses; this is a workforce 
that we need to retain. 
Instead of gestures of appreciation and gratitude, nurses need to be genuinely 
valued by the Government and the public. Nurses require appropriate pay for the 
highly specialist skilled work they deliver. This is something they have always 
delivered, but the pandemic saw ICU nurses pushed to their limits. Better working 
conditions are needed through regular breaks and rotating staff on different areas 
when needed, especially during a pandemic. 
This research has highlighted the importance of opening up space for nurses to 
share their stories during and beyond such crises. Emotional responses need to be 
normalised and validated even in the midst of a crisis (Bennett et al., 2020). This 
needs to be appropriate for a range of presentations of distress. For example, for 
those where trauma work appears to be inappropriate, Compassion Focused 
Therapy (CFT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be 
considered. At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, further 
waves remain likely (Johns, 2021; Torjesen, 2021), as do future pandemics 
(Dodds, 2019; Gill, 2020). Alongside the organisational costs of recruitment and 
retention, particularly for specialist centres having invested in the nursing 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
workforce as highly skilled HCWs, there is a corporate responsibility to protect the 
wellbeing of these nurses.  
However, psychological interventions are not beneficial to all in crises, and so 
whilst they should not be mandated (BPS COVID-19 Wellbeing Group, 2020), they 
should be designed to ensure they are accessible. This research has illuminated that 
these wellbeing spaces can be virtual, for example, nurses can use their own homes 
for protected, confidential space. With the world becoming increasingly more 
connected through technology, remote research interviews are becoming more 
common and widely used (Dodds & Hess, 2020; Heath et al., 2018). This, therefore, 
may lead to nurses being  more likely  to access wellbeing  services. As ICU nurses 
are integral to ICU care, rotas need to be designed to ensure  there is sufficient staff 
on shift to allow for other nurses to attend wellbeing spaces  during  working hours 
(and avoid further workload). 
Related to the need to ensure therapeutic spaces are tailored to the individual,  it  
is important to consider novel therapeutic approaches. Mental Health Awareness 
Week 2021 focused on connecting with nature (Mental Health Foundation, 2021). 
This may involve grounding techniques to manage distress, or that connect with 
nature. A recent article has highlighted horse therapy has been helpful for an NHS 
nurse who cared for patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic (BBC news, 
2021c). 
This research has highlighted the challenges the ICU-trained nurses faced were 
often different from that of those redeployed. As such, wellbeing services need to be 
flexible to meet the needs of different nurses, for example, to be tailored  to 
individuals or teams. 
Consideration is needed of the longer-term psychological fall out of the pandemic. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Not only did nurses care for patients with a novel virus, they experienced personal 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
threat, with longer working hours, and disruption of usual  standards  of care. They also 
returned to high work pressures involved with the restoration of routine patient care 
(BPS Staff Wellbeing Group, 2020). Whilst this is just a snapshot in time, it is important 
to consider how we look back and reflect on this period, and consider preparation for the 
future (Highfield, n.d.). 
5.7.3 Heroes or highly skilled professionals? 
This study has highlighted that an alternative framework or discourse  is needed 
for those who do not see themselves as heroes but are given this identity by the 
mass media, the public, and the Government. One of the nurses, Leia, suggested in 
her interview: ideally, I would like us, all of us, to be recognised as professionals, 
highly skilled professionals more than heroes. This highlights the importance for 
nurses to feel valued and recognised for their skill. 
5.8 Future Research Suggestions 
This study explored the stories of six nurses, but many stories remain untold. 
Areas for further exploration might be the experiences of more redeployed, non-ICU- 
trained nurses, or other professions that were redeployed to ICU, for example as 
healthcare assistants. 
     This research explored narratives of nurses who are highly skilled and trained in 
respiratory conditions. It would be worth exploring  the narratives of nurses who work in 
district general hospitals.
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
It is apparent that the redeployed, non-ICU trained nurses did not need to sustain 
the level of work in ICU for as long as those ICU trained. This may contribute to why 
the ICU-trained nurses had more to say about working during the pandemic, as 
indicated by longer interview length. This also brings into question whether those 
redeployed felt entitled or legitimate to make certain claims, such as those related 
to the role of the media, public misconceptions, and insufficient PPE. This suggests 
that nurses from different backgrounds will need support in different ways, and is 
worth further exploration. 
A further area for research may include, how, with the easing of infection control 
restrictions how the protective collective identity narrative evolves. 
Given all participants in the present study were women, further research would 
benefit from exploring the stories of other genders. As the sample were also aged 
between ages 26 to 56,  it may also be helpful for future research to include nurses 
who are younger and older than this, as well as ethnicities other than White British, 
White Italian and Asian. It is also recommended that exploring the experiences of 
more nurses who were redeployed to an ICU during the pandemic. 
5.9 An Ending But Is It Really? 
Writing in May 2021, there is not yet an ending to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Whilst routine hospital activities have been restored, there continues  to be an 
impending threat for potential further waves of the virus and future pandemics. 
Listening, and hearing, the experiences of nurses remain paramount, particularly at a 
time where the nurses spoke of feeling forgotten and undervalued. Whilst one might 
describe the work of these nurses as heroic, in the words of Izhac (2020), actions 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
speak louder than words  - or in this  case, applause.  We must hear  our nurses 
stories and we must not take the appearance of calmness and professional at face 
value. This is not, and should not, be the end of the story.

Appendix B: Excerpts from IRAS form 
A6-1. Summary of the study. 
This study will explore the experiences of nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of a high number of deaths, pressures on resources, 
staff shortages, ethical dilemmas, unwell colleagues, and greater exposure to COVID-19, for 
nurses working in ICUs emotional distress is anticipated. There is already a known shortage 
of nursing staff in the NHS, particularly ICU nursing staff, even before COVID-19. It is 
therefore paramount that their experiences are explored to support the retention and future 
recruitment of nurses. There has been a considerable amount of quantitative research, 
mainly through surveys and questionnaires, regarding nurses emotional wellbeing during 
COVID-19. However, studies that only use self-reported questionnaires do not explore the 
experiences in depth. Largely absent from the literature is research that explores narratives. 
Approximately eight participants will be recruited from the hospital site, for in-depth analysis 
(see below). This study will take the form of an individual semi-structured interview (approx. 
90 minutes) with Hannah. Participants will be invited to talk about their experience of working 
in the ICU during the pandemic. The interview will either take place face to face, at the 
hospital or over remote video technology, such as Accurx or Webex, as per security and 
data protection measures provided by the University and the NHS Trust. This study is 
supported by the University of Hertfordshire in collaboration with the hospital. Provisional 
approval has been granted from the Trusts Research and Developmental Team. As this 
study is part of a Doctoral qualification, there are time limits to the project and therefore is 
anticipated to be completed by June 2021, and submitted for publication to peer-reviewed 
journals soon after. 
A6-2. Summary of main issues. Please summarise the main ethical, legal, or 
management issues arising from your study and say how you have addressed them. 
Recruitment and consent: A member of the research team who works at the hospital site 
will advertise the study through three main platforms: Band 7 WhatsApp group, email group 
for all ICU nurses, and in the weekly newsletter for ICU staff at the hospital site. Those who 
wish to express an interest in taking part will be asked to complete the Expression of Interest 
form and to email this to the Hannah. Only Hannah will have access to the names of 
participants who express an interest. It will be assumed that the email address potential 
participants email the Expression of Interest form is the email address they wish to be 
contacted on. 
Consent will be sought by Hannah, who has experience of assessing capacity in clinical 
practice. Within the interview, Hannah will discuss each item of the consent form with the 
participant. This will include stating that consent for the study includes an agreement for the 
conversation to be audio-recorded (or video recorded dependent on whether the interview is 
allowed to be conducted by face to face), an agreement that anonymise d extracts from their 
interview may be published in the final project paper and papers for an academic journal(s). 
If the interview is taking place at the hospital site, this consent form will either be in hard 
copy format and completed by hand. Alternatively, if the interview is taking place over 
remote technology then this will be completed electronically. 
It is important to acknowledge that informed consent is not a one-off event but rather an 
ongoing process; therefore, participants will be reminded that they can withdraw participation 
during or up to 14 days after the interview. If a participant becomes emotionally distressed 
during the interview, Hannah will remind them of this. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
It may be that more than the required number of nurses express an interest in the study. It 
will be made clear on the Participant Information Sheet that the research team cannot 
guarantee that all participants who register their interest will be interviewed. If more than the 
required number apply, it may be that a stratified sampling strategy will be used to select 
participants that are diverse in terms of race, gender, age and a mix of those who usually 
work in ICU, and those who do not but are doing so due to COVID-19. 
Participant wellbeing: It is not anticipated that this research will cause significant distress. 
However, the research team are aware that participants may have been distressed by their 
experiences of living and working through the pandemic, and that talking about this may be 
difficult. The interviewer and members of the research team all have experience of managing 
distress through their training as clinical psychologists and work with both clients and staff in 
the NHS. Additionally, the team is guided by specialist advice from a highly experienced 
clinical psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire in the field of trauma, on shaping the 
interview structure and management to reduce the chance of additional distress. Participants 
will be reminded that they only need to talk about what they feel able and willing to talk 
about, at a level of detail and a way that they feel comfortable with. Participants will also be 
reminded that they can take breaks if they need, or they can withdraw their participation at 
any point, without having to provide a reason. Hannah will use her clinical experience and 
judgment to monitor participant distress during the interview and to manage this. If Hannah 
has concerns at the end of the interview regarding the participants' emotional wellbeing, they 
will be reminded that they can speak to (psychologist at hospital site) in addition to a list of 
contact details for further support. 
Confidentiality: All data collected will be anonymized and kept confidential in compliance 
with the Data Protection Act 1998 and GDPR. Personal identifiable information about the 
participant and all third parties will be removed from the transcribed interview. As part of 
consent taking, participants will be invited to choose their pseudonym. All personal 
identifiable information will be password protected, anonymised, and stored in a locked 
cabinet that is only accessible by Hannah. 
Face-to-face contact in light of COVID-19 restrictions: In the context of the COVID-19, any 
face-to-face contact would be subject to and in line with restrictions set out by the 
Government, by the NHS Trust, and by the University at that point in time. This would 
include whether face to face contact was permitted at all (there are currently University 
restrictions on this for University members undertaking research, although this may change 
shortly). As such, it is not clear yet whether the interview will take place at the hospit al site  or 
over remote video technology. If the study is face to face, audio recordings will be encrypted, 
anonymised and password-protected and before being stored on a laptop till the end of the 
project. 
If the study is over remote technology, it will be video recorded. These recordings will be 
accessible by Hannah and the internal supervisor to the project. This is to enable them to 
return to recordings, should they need to, whilst reports are being written. Again, any 
electronic data will be anonymised, password-protected, and stored on an encrypted 
memory stick. At the end of the study, the recordings will be deleted securely. Transcripts 
will be anonymised and stored on an encrypted hard drive (128 bt encryption) for five years, 
in line with the University of Hertfordshire guidelines. After this time, it will be destroyed 
securely. Before the interview, confidentiality will be discussed with each participant. This will 
involve informing the participant that conversations will be confidential to the research team. 
This will also be outlined in the Participation Information Sheet. When completing the 
questionnaires or interviews, if a member of the research team feels concerned about 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
participant risk to themselves or others (these issues may be physical, sexual, verbal, or 
emotional abuse), they have a duty of care to raise these concerns. Hannah will always aim 
to discuss this breach of confidentiality with participants before sharing the information. 
A24. What is the potential for benefit to research participants? 
There are no direct benefits for taking part in this study, however, participants may 
experience some indirect benefits. This study endeavours to provide a space where they can 
share freely their individual experience of working in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic 
to someone impartial. The semi-structured nature of the interview may help the participants 
share their stories, which may be helpful in the meaning-making of their experience, as well 
as feeling heard and valued. Furthermore, contributing to a growing area of research, which 
may improve the provision of health care services and the support available for other health 
care staff is also likely to offer some psychological benefits. 
A26. What are the potential risks for the researchers themselves? (if any)  
In the context of the COVID-19, any face-to-face contact would be subject to and in line with 
restrictions set out by the Government, by the NHS Trust, and by the University at that point 
in time. This would include whether face to face contact was permitted at all (there are 
currently University restrictions on this for University members undertaking research, 
although this may change shortly), physical distancing guidelines, and advice on the use of 
PPE. Furthermore, Hannah does not have any underlying health conditions that would put 
her at risk of more severe illness if she were to contract the virus. It is also important to state 
though the hospital had COVID-19 positive patients at the end of March 2020, as the 
hospital was a designated pan London cardiac surgery hub. The hospital is continuously 
cleaned in line with infection control procedures. There are designated COVID-19 Protected 
Areas and COVID-19 Risk Managed Areas. All patient rooms are deep cleaned according to 
the guidance of infection control-not just for COVID-19, but also including MRSA, VRE, and 
CRE. However, these interviews would not take place in a patient area. Furthermore, the 
hospital staff are undertaking stringent monthly surveillance COVID-19 testing. It is not 
expected that the researchers will be exposed to many risks. It is anticipated that it is 
unlikely that the study will lead to emotional distress in the research team, however, if this 
were to occur, support from other members of the research team, as well as support from 
the University of Hertfordshire. The researchers will use self-care strategies for the duration 
of the project. Hannah will also make use of a reflective journal throughout. 
A38. How will you ensure the confidentiality of personal data? 
Every effort will be made to protect the identity of participants with personal details changed 
or removed where necessary to preserve their identity. Hannah will not have access to 
personal data of potential participants until she receives the expression of interest form by 
the potential participant themselves. Personal identifiable information, including the consent 
form and expression of interest form, will only be accessed by Hannah. All data collected will 
be anonymised and kept confidential in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and 
GDPR. Personal identifiable information will be removed or changed from the transcribed 
interview. Participants will be invited to choose a pseudonym. Transcripts will be given 
participant codes by Hannah. Furthermore, a non-disclosure agreement will be signed by the 
transcriber.

To whom it may concern, 
Many thanks for your feedback to the proposed research project. In response to your 
feedback, the following amendments have been made 
*additional comments/amendments in red italicised font 
 We would normally expect audio/video recordings to be deleted once they have ben 
transcribed, please clarify your decision to only do this at the end of the study. 
Audio recordings will be encrypted and the video recording platform will be one that is 
secure. Audio recordings and documents containing personal identif iable information will be 
password-protected and stored on an encrypted memory stick until the end of the project. 
After this, the audio recordings will be permanently deleted in a secure way. The recordings 
will be kept until the end of the project for several reasons. Firstly, this study will use a 
private transcription company for initial transcription. Ideally, the transcription will reflect the 
recording, although this is not always the case; relying solely on this transcription make 
compromise study validity. Qualitative research, specifically narrative inquiry, involves 
multiple layers of analysis, and so without original data, audit trail is obstructed which may 
impact the scientific rigour of the study. Furthermore, access to the recordings beyond the 
transcription stage helps the researchers return to recordings, should they need to, when 
analysing the data or when reports are being written. Although the data will not be deleted 
until the end of the study, it will be kept safe, which is explicitly stated on the participation  
information sheet and consent form. Additionally, audio/video records will only be accessible 
by Dr. Wendy Solomons and Hannah Cutler. As such, I am of the view that this is in line with 
the Data Protection Act (1998) that data is stored no longer than for initial purposes.  
 In order for your PIS to be GDPR compliant, please updated with HRA GDPR wording 
 available as a template here: 
PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET (please see PIS 1 and PIS 2) 
What will you do with the information I give you? 
All information collected is strictly confidential. Information will be stored in a locked filing 
cabinet that is only accessible by Hannah. Encrypted documents and on password protected 
folders on encrypted devices. Personal identifiable information will only be accessed by 
Hannah. Information that could identify you, such as your name and other details, will be 
removed or changed. We will ask  you to choose your own pseudonym so that your real 
name will not be used. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
If the interview happens face to face, it will need to be audio recorded. If it happens over 
technology, then the interview will be need to be video recorded. This is because it is then 
transcribed for analysis later on in the research. These recordings will be accessed by 
Hannah, Dr Wendy Solomons (University of Hertfordshire) and the independent transcribing 
company transcriber. The recordings will then be sent to the independent company to be 
transcribed into written form, but this will be using your pse udonym. People who do not need 
to know who you are will not be able to see your name or contact details. The transcriber will 
sign a non-disclosure agreement. The written transcript of your interview will be kept in a 
secure location for five years. After this time, it will be destroyed securely. We will keep all 
information about you safe and secure. 
What are your choices about how your information is used? 
 You can stop being part of the study at any time, without giving a reason, but we will 
keep information about you that we already have. 
 We need to manage your records in specific ways for the research to be reliable. This 
means that we wont be able to let you see or change the data we hold about you.

 Please clarify the recruitment method of using a Band 7 Whatsapp group when  
 Nurses of Band 7 level are excluded from the study 
A27-1 
*Despite recruiting for Band 5 and 6 nurses, a Band 7 WhatsApp will be used as one way of 
advertising the study. Band 7 nurses will be informed so that they can then pass on the 
information of this study i.e. in the team meeting. As Band 7 nurses are often in lead roles, 
they can cascade this information on to potential participants. This is to supplement the other 
methods of advertising. Furthermore, working in busy ICUs means that nurses do not have 
frequent access to emails, therefore, this additional platform to encourage talk about the 
potential study will be helpful in recruiting sufficient participants. It is important to note that 
there will not be any communication between the research team and the Band 7 nurses 
regarding who expresses interest/participates in the study unless the participant wishes to 
express this.

Appendix J: Participant information sheet 
Participant Information Sheet 
Are you a Band 5 or 6 nurse who worked on the intensive care unit (ICU) at 
XXX Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic? 
What are the aims of this research? 
We would like to understand better the experience of nurses who on the ICU at XXX Hospital during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes those who usually worked on ICU and in other departments. 
We are hoping that this understanding will help services to provide better emotional support for 
nurses in the future. 
What would this involve? 
The lead researcher for the project, Hannah, would arrange a time to meet with you for the interview. 
This would either be at XXX Hospital or over remote video technology (depending on COVID-19 
guidance). Hannah will interview you for about 90 minutes; this is to allow you time and space to talk 
about your experience. You will only be invited to talk about what you feel willing and able to. 
What will you do with the information I give you? 
All information collected is strictly confidential. Information will be stored in a locked fil ing cabinet that 
is only accessible by Hannah. Encrypted documents and on password protected folders on encrypted 
devices. Personal identifiable information will only be accessed by Hannah. Information that could 
identify you, such as your name and other details, will be removed or changed. We will ask you to 
choose your own pseudonym so that your real name will not be used. 
If  the interview happens face to face, it will need to be audio recorded. If it happens over technology, 
then the interview will be need to be video recorded. This is because it is then transcribed for analysis 
later on in the research. These recordings will be accessed by Hannah and Dr Wendy Solomons 
(supervisor on the research team, University of Hertfordshire). The interview recording will be sent to 
an independent transition company, using your pseudonym. They must follow our rules about keeping 
your information safe. No one other than Hannah will know your real name. Those who do not need to 
know who you are will not be able to see your name or contact details. We will keep all information 
about you safe and secure. Once we have f inished the study, we will keep some of the data so we 
can check the results. We will write our reports in a way that no-one can work out that you took part in 
the study. 
How will you use this information? 
The results of  the research will be written up in a report for Hannahs Doctorate in Clinical 
Psychology. This may contain anonymised quotes from the interview. The research will be written up 
f o r submission to peer-reviewed academic journals and conferences, so that other health 
professionals can learn f rom the research. 
Are there any situations when information I tell you will be shared? 
Disclosure of  any personal information f rom the interview would only occur in exceptional 
circumstances, such as if  you revealed information that may indicate a risk to yourselves or others. 
What are your choices about how your information is used? 
 You can stop being part of the study at any time, without giving a reason, but we will keep 
information about you that we already have.

Are there any potential benefits in taking part? 
There are not any direct benef its for taking part, but we hope to provide a space where you can share 
your story of  working in ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Talking about your experience with 
someone who is impartial may be helpful in making meaning from the experience. Also, contributing 
to a growing area of  research, which may have implications for nurses in the future, may offer some 
psychological benefits. 
Are there any potential risks in taking part? 
There are no known risks, however, there is a chance that the interview may be emotionally 
distressing for some (e.g., during or after the interview). Hannah has experience in providing 
emotional support to people who are experiencing distress, and will be sensitive to this in her 
interview technique and delivery. For example, if Hannah feels you are becoming distressed, she may 
ask you to pause for a moment and check you are not feeling too anxious. As stated above, Hannah 
may ask clarifying questions but not questions which will involve asking details about specifics of an 
event. You will be reminded that you should only talk about the experiences that feel you feel willing 
to talk about, and in a way that feels manageable for you. 
What happens after the interview? 
Following the interview, you will have no further involvement in the study. You will be offered a leaf let 
with some relevant support networks should participant like further support. 
Following the end of  the project, a summary of the f indings will be documented and made available at 
XXX Hospital to those who took part, if you would like. 
What happens if I agree to take part but then later change my mind? 
You can withdraw f rom the interview at any time point, including during the interview and up to 14 
days af ter the interview. You can withdraw for any reason, and you do not have to tell Hannah the 
reason you would like to withdraw. Withdrawal f rom the study would have no impact on your job role.

may be that not everyone who expresses an interest can take part in the research. We want to make 
sure we include nurses f rom a range of  backgrounds and different living situations. We hope that this 
will contribute to the literature and may inform better emotional support for nurses in the future.

 Any questions? 
I am interested in hearing about your experience of working in ITU during 
covid-19. I will ask you to tell me your story; there are no rights or wrongs, 
I would just like to hear your story in your own words. 
So I will give you time and space to tell me about this as fully as you want 
to, or feel able to. I will try to sit back and listen to what yo u say as much 
as I can without interrupting, I have some areas I would like to cover.

How did you manage 
that? What was that

Appendix Q: Interview transcript and analysis process 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Appendix R: Research diary extracts 
03/10/2020 - Following meeting with research consultant to the project 
During the meeting with the research consultant to the project, she told  me that ICU 
at the hospital site had a difficult year leading up to the pandemic, with many deaths. 
As such, when COVID-19 arrived, the ICU team may have already  been  facing 
threat and emotional stress to some degree. Therefore,  it is important  consider 
asking participants about their context before the outbreak, as this is likely to shape 
the narratives. 
Following supervision with Wendy, we discussed how it may be that nurses may say 
a lot very quickly, this may be linked to their role as a nurse, being used to 
communicating in highly pressured environments etc. To hold this in mind. 
08/10/2020  Following a narrative workshop 
Following the narrative workshop with some of my colleagues also using the same 
methodology, we discussed narrative inquiry as a method. We discussed how 
narrative inquiry is ethical as it allows people to have agency over what they share 
e.g., where they start, where they finish and what aspects of the account they  want 
to present. This has reminded me of the importance of stating this at the start of the 
interview e.g.,  how participants  only need to share what they feel willing and able to.  
I will also remind participants that if I ask them a question that they do not feel 
comfortable with, then they can let me know. 
We also had discussed identity within a social constructionist framework and ways to 
ask about this within the interview. We also spoke about the best way to explore 
identities is not to ask directly about this. This led me to change the wording of some 
questions in the interview such as asking how working through the pandemic has 
changed them in any ways. 
I have also been thinking more about the potential for chaos narratives, particularly 
with the recent increase in COVID-19 cases and starting  interviews  soon. Therefore, 
I am anticipating that stories may have aspects of a chaotic feel to them - with order 
and sequencing being difficult for the individual,  and  perhaps  a sense that there is 
little control or a sense of being swept along. Or perhaps this may show if the 
participant has difficulties speaking in the first person. I also need to be aware, 
however, of the role of culture and the impact this may have on the narratives, for 
example some cultures tell  stories in different  ways which may, in Western culture, 
be interpreted as a chaos narrative. 
15/11/2020  Following initial difficulties with recruitment 
I started advertising about two weeks ago and I have only received one response 
from a potential participant so far. This has surprised me; I had always anticipated 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
that nurses would been keen to take part. As advertising began just before the 
second national lockdown and with the second wave of infections emerging,  I 
began to wonder whether nurses were to exhausted and perhaps not in the right 
headspace to talk about their experience. I shared my concerns in supervision, and 
we discussed how humans, for millions of years, had told stories, even in hard and 
challenging times. Wendy also reminded me that initially we were concerned that if 
the interviews take place following the peak of the pandemic (we were not sure if 
there was to be a second peak at the time), and the reversion to normal then this 
may be a barrier to participation. Now we have a situation again where events are 
very much live currently. We discussed the importance of emphasising that this 
study offers a supportive listening space, which may be what some nurses require 
at this time. It is however, important to ensure that practical barriers are not present 
such as lack of time/exhaustion. Having thinking about these aspects, it is important 
for me to bear these in mind when liaising with potential participants. 
20/12/2020  Following several interviews 
It am aware that I have felt more attuned to certain storylines than others in the 
interviews. For example, when nurses discuss the media, I am interested in their 
experience of this (and certain discourses such as heroes and war). I have long 
been aware I am drawn to this type of language, likely because of my personal 
experiences of war language in medical settings. In being  attuned  to this  in 
particular, I wonder if there were other stories that I may have missed or not heard 
 this is uncomfortable but an inherent given everyone has different lenses.

Appendix S: Extract of interview field notes 
12/12/2020  Amelia 
At work, dressed in her scrubs, face mask and hair net, as well as being  in an office 
at the hospital; twice was disturbed  during  the interview; I wonder how much her 
being  in the context played a role in how much she told me, and whether  she felt 
she could be emotionally expressive; this may inform  why Amelia  appeared  to jump 
in quickly with the narrative, telling me about the several days she spent in ICU; 
language barrier between us; had to concentrate in order to follow narrative; felt 
nervous that I was going to miss something; I think my communication style changed 
 spoke clearer  I wonder how this impacted Amelias narrative  (possibly 
reinforcing her answering in short, brief answers).

Appendix T: Quality Assessment of this Research (Tracy, 2010) 
Worthy 
topic 
This research is worthy, novel, timely, and has  met a gap  within 
the literature. This research is important in considering how to 
prepare and support nurses better for future pandemics, which are 
thought to be likely (Gill, 2020). 
Rich rigour 
Throughout this research process, the various ways that narrative 
research can be conducted was explored. It became helpful to 
discuss with my colleagues and supervisor during this process. 
I also kept a reflective journal (Appendix X), and field notes 
throughout the analysis stage (Appendix X). 
The interview length was sufficient (between 1 hour - 1 hour, 51 
minutes) and led by the nurses, to allow for the collection of rich 
stories and the multiple layers of analysis required. 
Collection of rich participant demographic details (collected via the 
Expression of Interest form  Appendix K, and presented in Table 
Two, Chapter Three) helped situate the sample. 
A limitation is the heterogeneity of the sample (discussed in more 
depth below). 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Sincerity 
I shared with the reader my epistemological stance to the project, 
which I have aimed to hold in mind throughout (see Appendix X for 
my research diary). 
How this research was developed and conducted has allowed me 
to challenge my position and some of my decisions when 
necessary. For example, following meetings with the research 
consultant, I adapted the practicalities of the interview process and 
the recruitment process (see Appendix R for my research diary 
extracts). 
Credibility 
Meetings with my supervisory team ensured the credibility of the 
analysis and prompted me to consider other interpretations, and 
challenge some of my interpretations of certain stories within the 
accounts. 
Rich information related to the stages of data analysis is provided 
(Chapter Three). 
Throughout this research, I had bi-monthly meetings with a 
colleague also using narrative inquiry, where we discussed all 
stages of the research. 
With narrative research exploring accounts across time (Connelly 
& Clandinin, 1990), it would have been useful to conduct the 
interviews at multiple time points. Due to conducting the research 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 within the time boundaries of clinical psychology training, this was 
not possible. Future research may benefit from employing this. 
Resonance 
Given this research is so current and novel, it is likely to resonate 
with readers. Narrative inquiry, with its exploration of participant 
accounts in storied form, weaving in participants own words, and 
writing in the first person, is also like to support its ability to 
resonate. 
I have aimed to present this research in a clear, aesthetic manner 
with the use of subheadings, tables, and figures. 
The sample was recruited from a specialist cardiothoracic unit, so 
how far the analysis has implications for nurses in more general 
hospitals is questionable (a critical discussion on implications is 
discussed later in this chapter). 
All participants were women, however, there was a diversity in 
participants ethnicities and ages. From discussion with the 
research consultant to the project, this sample is assumed to be 
representative of the nurses at the hospital. 
Significant 
contribution 
Taking into account the reviewed studies, this research both 
supports other literature and offers alternative angles which have 
been discussed above. 
NURSES NARRATIVES OF WORKING IN ICUs DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 This research has clinical implications which will be discussed 
below. 
Ethical 
Ethical considerations were paramount to consider throughout all 
stages of this research. See Appendices X and X. Given this is a 
potentially sensitive area, extensive consideration was taken to 
mitigate any intended emotional distress for participants. This 
included ethical recruitment strategies, meetings with the research 
consultant, with a specific focus on the appropriateness of the 
interview questions. 
Care was also taken related to informed consent and ensuring 
confidentiality was maintained, particularly when conducting 
research during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Meaningful 
coherence 
This research achieved its aims. Similarities and differences 
across accounts were explored. 
The analysis is presented in a coherent, narrative format, aimed to 
preserve nuances in the data.
