Abstract 
Asclepius was worshipped in over 900 sanctuaries across the Graeco-Roman 
world. Although the cult had been disseminated across eastern Mediterranean from 
the 5th century onwards, it was only when the Romans took over the cult that it was 
dispersed all over the empire to become an empire-wide cult. This thesis looks at the 
impact of the Roman Empire on the cult, examining how Rome took over the 
existing cult, the ways in which Rome influenced it, and the relationship between the 
religion of Empire and local religion.  
The key questions that this thesis aims to ask are: How did the Roman 
Empire impact upon the cult of Asclepius? How were global and regional cult 
identities articulated in response to each other as a result of this impact? How did 
increased connectivity between areas play an important part in the creation and 
stimulation of cultic identities? Did Asclepius spheres of influence grow or adapt as 
a result of Roman benefactions? and What were provincial responses to Roman 
worship and dissemination of the cult? 
The timeframe for this thesis will be from 27 BC until Severus Alexanders 
death in AD 235. Chapter One will introduce the scope of this thesis as well as the 
general theories which underpin this research. A survey of the cult before the 
Augustan period will be presented in Chapter Two. Further chapters will each 
examine a different aspect of the Roman impact on the cult, with the third focussing 
on imperial influences and the worship of the god by Roman and provincial elites; 
the fourth on how the Roman army influenced the cult; the fifth how multiple forms 
of the god were worshipped side-by-side in North Africa.

Chapter 1: Mobility and Connectivity in the Cult of Asclepius 
1.0 Introduction 
Originating in Greece in the 5th century BC, worship of Asclepius continued 
until the late 4th century AD by which time the god had been worshipped at over 900 
cult sites across the Graeco-Roman world.1 The cult was introduced to Rome in 293 
BC and a temple was dedicated to Asclepius in 291 BC on Tiber Island.2 Although 
the cult had been disseminated across the Mediterranean world by the Greeks, it was 
only when the Romans took over the cult that it was dispersed widely across the 
empire, with worship of Asclepius occurring to some extent in most of the 
provinces.3 The cult was spread by various groups, including the Roman army, and 
this thesis will examine how this occurred and the reasons for this dissemination. 
Increased mobility during the Roman Empire played an important role in the spread 
of the cult. As put by Adams: Travel and communication are dynamics which were 
central to the Roman Empire.4 The empires size and diversity demanded that there 
was an efficient communication system in place for government. This infrastructure 
was made safe by the pax Romana, making the dangerous days of travelling during 
the Classical and Hellenistic periods a thing of the past.5 Travel by land was a lot 
slower than voyages by sea but had the benefit of being a far safer mode of

3 Within this work, where the term Empire is used with a capital E it indicates the socio-political 
entity which was the Roman Empire. When empire is used with a small e this means the geographical 
entity. This is done to illustrate the difference between these two as the geographical empire was 
already being formed via Roman conquests prior to the creation of the principate.

transport.6 Travel and communication permeated all levels of state bureaucracy, the 
fiscal sphere and military logistics and organisations and also facilitated the 
dissemination and changes of a cult.7 This thesis aims to look at the impact of the 
Roman Empire on the cult, examining how Rome took over the Greek cult, and the 
ways in which Rome influenced it.8 It will also look at the ways in which the cult 
varied in the city of Rome and the Roman provinces as the cult apparently had scope 
for strong regional tendencies within its worship. In order to establish this, the 
religion of empire versus the religion of the local will be researched, showing global 
and regional characteristics of the cult. The impact of the Roman Empire on the cult 
of Asclepius will be explored via a number of factors. These elements by which the 
cult adapted and changed as a result of the new reality of Empire have been singled 
out in this work and are: the emperors, courtiers, the creation of a professional army, 
and cross-provincial mobility and movements. The institution of emperor and a 
permanent army were created by the advent of Empire and the other factors also 
changed or became more prominent at this time, such as the court. By doing so, this 
work will address a shortcoming in Asclepieian scholarship, where great emphasis is 
placed upon the cult in the Classical and Hellenistic world but is overlooked by most 
in the Roman period as it was believed that there were few important changes which 
took place during this time.9 This thesis will show that the cult in the Roman era had 
a rich and varied history and that it had to adapt to the new reality of Empire, as did 
the world around the cult. This thesis will explore how this took place, laying out a 
number of theories in this chapter and then examining how the cult of Asclepius 
adapted to the Roman Empire in subsequent chapters. Cult spaces are one of the best

areas in which to perform such research, as they reflect the beliefs of the people 
around them and they did not just have religious meaning but also had socio-political 
connotations.10 It is important to examine these matters on a site-to-site basis or via 
the differing elements which impacted upon a cult.  
Why Asclepius is a suitable paradigm for such a study will first be examined 
here and this chapter will move on to explore the various theories argued by modern 
scholars which explain the phenomenon researched in this study.  
1.1 Asclepius as Paradigm 
 Generally, the cult of Asclepius in the Roman period has been given less 
attention than that in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, leaving much scope for 
innovative study. There are a number of factors which set Asclepius apart from other 
gods and make him an excellent case-study for an examination into the impact of the 
Roman Empire on a cult and also into how global and regional cults interacted. 
Firstly, Asclepius cult was open to people from all socio-economic backgrounds 
and genders, meaning that no group was excluded, and this study can include 
evidence from people from all standings. While this means that the poor worshipped 
Asclepius, which has long been pointed out as a notable feature of his worship, this 
has also sometimes been taken as an indication that the elites would not worship the 
god.11 This is not the case as from early on Asclepius was worshipped by civic units 
such as the Boule in Athens and it will be explored in Chapter 3 how imperial and 
elite patronage of the cult boosted and adapted worship. Most people become ill at 
some point in their lives and Asclepius, therefore, would have been a universal god

whom people would want to worship and supplicate. His cult, as case-study for the 
impact of empire, would, thus, offer a good cross-section of all members of society, 
from all socio-economic backgrounds and statuses. The cult was introduced in the 5th 
century BC and had continuous worship until the 4th century AD, providing a rich 
and long time period for this study. The cult did not diminish in popularity but 
actually grew during the Roman period with many new cult-sites being founded 
across the empire and at various stages, for example, in the Balkan and Danube 
regions and in North Africa (see Chapters 4 and 5). This thesis examines the cult in 
areas where it was already established before the advent of the Roman Empire and 
also  in sites which were established in newly conquered provinces to understand 
how Rome impacted upon both of these and how the cult adapted to each individual 
circumstance. The wide geographical spread of the cult gives a good regional scope 
for research into the impact of empire as each province had distinctive characteristics 
which could have influenced the cult. The imperial period saw an increase in 
mobility due to better infrastructure and as a result the cult could spread further than 
ever before, especially when worship of the god was taken up by the Roman army 
who had a definite impact upon the cult as will be examined in Chapters 4 and 5. 
With this dissemination, it seems that Asclepius also actually grew in power and 
status as will be shown from a study of the gods epithets. A further point which sets 
Asclepius apart is the relative fluidity of his nature, since, once he had been 
introduced into a region, local people were free to pick and choose which elements 
of the cult they wished to observe there. It is also noteworthy that this flexibility took 
place for the most part without syncretism, though this does occur within the cult and 
which will be examined in Chapter 5. All of these features make Asclepius stand out 
from the other gods but he was a member of the Graeco-Roman religious world, with 
sanctuaries or cults appearing in most locations, making him an appropriate study for 
cults and impact in general, as the factors singled out here to illustrate the impact of 
Empire (see below) can be applied to other cults. This also paves the way for future 
parallel studies. 
1.1.1 Globalism and Regionalism in Antiquity 
In order to detect the influence of Rome globally on the cult of Asclepius the 
local characteristics of the cult must also be studied as it is only when the regional is 
compared with the global, that it truly becomes distinct and vice-versa. Globalism 
allows scholars to move past outdated ideas about centre and periphery, past the 
opposites of Roman and native by seeing the Empire as a connected whole.12 
Global as a term is relatively vague and can be taken to mean the whole world or 
the perception of a world, depending on the context in which it occurs. Here, the 
term will not be used to refer to the whole world as it is known in the modern world 
but means the whole of the Roman Empire and its provinces.13 For Pitts and 
Versluys globalisation can be described as: [] processes by which localities and 
people become increasingly interconnected and interdependent.14 The term global is 
not as applicable to the Greek world as a result of the fragmented nature of the Greek 
12 Pitts and Versluys (2015) 6. 
13 Hodos (2015) 240 notes that critics of the application of globalisation theories to the ancient world 
argue that this process did not span the entire globe and, therefore, does not refer so much to 
globalisation as it does to Westernisation. However, she negates this argument by stating that it is 
accepted that globalism was an uneven and unequal process which did not affect all peoples, 
communities, and individuals. She sees globalism as an indicator of increased connectivity which 
would make the term one which can be applied to the Graeco-Roman world: Hodos (2015) 241-2. 
14 Pitts and Versluys (2015) 11. They also state that denominators of globalisation are connectivity 
and de-territorialisation and that it is an uneven process, meaning that it does not happen the same in 
every place, and that the process reconfigures socio-political relations and instructions while fostering 
cultural diversity but also social inequalities: Pitts and Versluys (2015) 11, 14. 
city states while the unity of empire facilitated global cults.15 It is also important to 
state that while Romans might have perceived their world as global, globalism was 
not created by Rome, as the heart of the Empire, but Roman globalism was the 
product of both Rome and the provinces, something which resulted in different 
versions of something which can be called Roman globalism.16 Something can be 
global but take on differing forms in various places. This results in a cross-provincial 
exchange of ideas, iconographies, and rites, some occurrences of which will be 
explored in this thesis (see sections 3.3.1, 4.4 and 5.3.2). As a result of this process, 
Rome itself was both globalising and globalised. In fact, Nederveen Pieterse argues 
that by being globalised, Rome was globalising.17 The peripheries of Empire define 
the centre as much as the centre defines the peripheries. Even this was not static as 
when areas were newly conquered, and, thus, became new peripheries, Rome 
brought its culture but also that of other peripheral regions to the new periphery:18  
[] pericentric theory of empire, in which peripheries play a central, not just a 
marginal role, and multicentric and network understandings of empire. This 
generates multiple and layered understandings of the Roman world including the 
diversity, polyphony and dynamics of Romanness [].19 
The ways in which this cross-provincial connectivity happened within the cult of 
Asclepius will be shown in various contexts in this thesis. Like globalism, region is 
15 This is not to say that there was no connectivity in the Greek world, on the contrary. However, as 
Pitts and Versluys (2015) 17 point out, this connectivity was always present but there were certain 
time periods when there was a particular flare up of connectivity. The Roman Empire with its vast 
provinces and connecting infrastructure was one of these periods and this increased connectivity is 
expected to have impacted upon the religious world of the Empire, among which the cult of 
Asclepius.

19 Nederveen Pieterse (2015) 234. It is not just Nederveen Pieterse who stresses the important of 
viewing ritual transfer from a provincial perspective but this is also stated by Chaniotis (2009) 5 who 
examines ritual dynamics from the perspective of the provinces and not via that of Rome. He also 
argues that Rome was confronted with provincial rituals, both those of their allies and their enemies, 
from the beginning and, in turn, confronted the others with their own rituals.  
a contested term. However, it is generally taken to mean a grouping of territorial 
units which are in close geographical proximity to each other and which constitute a 
spatially cohesive and connected area.20 The term regionalism is not just concerned 
with geographical space but also has political and administrative dimensions, as 
regions are socially constructed spatial concepts which follow notions of community 
and society. As such, they have a shared cultural identity which includes religion and 
language. These communal characteristics form and nurture a common socio-cultural 
understanding of an area.21 Each region would, thus, be distinct and possess elements 
which were specific to that area. For the cult of Asclepius, this would mean that 
there were certain cultic elements such as rites and iconographies which were 
specific to one area or acquired new or different meanings in each region. In fact, 
this does seem to occur in the cult of Asclepius as there is evidence for regionalism 
from early on; there were many rites and rituals which were performed at only a 
single sanctuary. At Cos there was an annual ritual which was called the renewing of 
the staff which entailed a procession to the sacred grove of Asclepius.22 These 
regional characteristics could also have been incorporated within wider global 
features. The need for purity within the cult was well known but took a different 
form in each sanctuary. Sacred laws informed supplicants how to achieve ritual 
purity in each specific sanctuary. Supplicants travelling to a sanctuary may not have 
been aware of the specific cultic regulations of that particular cult-site, but only of 
the global need for purity, and a law could have informed them of these prior to 
entry which would prevent pollution.23 These locally individual rites were set within 
a larger macro-identity of purity within the cult.

23 See a comparison between SEG 20. 759 (2nd or 3rd-4th century AD) and ILAfr 225 (AD 113-138). 
There were also rites which occurred globally and the larger macro-identity 
of the cult manifested itself as rites were shared across the board such as incubation 
which seemingly occurred in many sanctuaries and the formula on account of a 
dream was often inscribed on votive dedications.24 There were also strong 
iconographic and dedicatory similarities across the Graeco-Roman world such as 
anatomical ex-votos which were commonly dedicated to Asclepius, indicating that 
the material culture of the cult showed uniform tendencies. These ex-votos stopped 
being commonly dedicated from the late 2nd century BC onwards and do not factor 
much into the discussion here.25 The main focus will be on literary, epigraphic, and 
numismatic material which provides clearer evidence for the impact of Empire. The 
main body of evidence for this examination into the impact of the Roman Empire on 
the cult of Asclepius will be epigraphic. This material is rich and varied but does 
present certain problems in its use. Many inscriptions are fragmented in nature and, 
therefore, various and differing readings of the same inscription are often possible. 
This can lead to multiple interpretations of the inscriptions meaning. Even when the 
text is clear and undamaged the inscriptions meaning can still be vague or open to 
numerous interpretations. A further point of caution in the use of inscriptions is the 
way in which they are accessed. Inscriptions from certain regions are better 
published than others or done so in more accessible ways. Online corpora such as the 
PHI/ERGA and the EDCS databases greatly facilitate and ease the use of 
inscriptions, with useful search options which allow for a broad overview of the 
available inscriptions containing a keyword or from a region.26 This allows for easy 
24 IG IV2 1.470; Ferngren and Amundsen (1993) 2959 note that incubation, the ritual where a 
supplicant spent the night in a sanctuary, hoping that the god would appear to him in a dream, was the 
most common form of divine healing in antiquity and that it was a part of many cults, among them 
many oriental ones, and not just the cult of Asclepius.

comparative parallel study. However, these online corpora often only list the text 
itself and offer no interpretation. The PHI/ERGA database also often provides a date 
for the text where possible but the EDCS does not do that. For a comprehensive 
understanding of the inscriptions context, hardcopy corpora such as IG, CIL, AE, 
and SEG must be consulted. Yet, even these are not without their issues as many do 
not comment on the physical appearance of the inscription and often do not provide 
plates or photos of the reliefs which are present on the stone, if these are mentioned 
at all in corpora which focus exclusively on inscriptions.27 Knowledge of the layout 
of the inscription, its relief, and how these two worked together is vital for 
understanding the possible meaning of an inscription (see section 4.4). To properly 
study an inscription from the various corpora, it is important to access all of the 
available sources for the fullest understanding. 
Apart from the theories which will be discussed below, Stek has edited a 
volume examining how Rome impacted upon cult in Italy, especially after its 
conquest, and the Impact of Empire research network has been prolific in 
examining how Rome affected various parts of the Graeco-Roman world, for 
example political, religious, and economic.28 However, no conclusive study has been 
(http://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi_de.php).  
27 The IGBulg corpora are one of the notable earlier exceptions to this as the editors aimed to add as 
many accompanying photo plates for each inscription as possible. Online versions of corpora such as 
RIB http://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/ and Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania 
http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/ are addressing this issue.

undertaken on a single cult in the Roman Imperial period, something which this 
thesis aims to rectify. Stek has singled out certain factors which need to be 
considered for the study of this impact and also stresses the importance of moving 
away from the abstract concept of Rome and looking instead at the individual actors 
in these situations.29 This thesis aims to present a study of the impact of the Roman 
Empire on religion in the ancient world via the case-study of Asclepius, filling in the 
gap in current scholarship. It does so by isolating various factors by which the 
Empire changed the cult, namely the emperors, courtiers, the army, and cross-
provincial mobility and movements. The pre-Augustan cult will be considered in 
more detail in the second chapter and other chapters will show the effects of the 
Roman Empire on the cult by focussing on specific factors and examining to what 
extent this caused global or regional characteristics in the cult of Asclepius. This 
thesis aims to explore how the increased mobility and connectivity of the Roman 
Empire actually increased choice within a cult: local people came into contact with 
more options and picked which were suited for them. As a cult spread further, it 
came into contact with more people and locals. New cultic elements were introduced

29 Stek (2015) 11; see also Collar (2013) 19 who states that ideas adopted by these individual actors 
were done so due to either vulnerability, which is a part of the individuals identity if he was quick 
and early to adapt to new influences, or connectedness, where he had the ability to transmit this new 
information to more individuals. It is near impossible to state whether an individual took on an 
innovation as a result of either connectedness or vulnerability. 
http://www.ru.nl/impactofempire/
as a result of this expansion and older elements, which were perhaps only relevant to 
a certain local, were discarded. Supplicants determined which parts of the cult were 
relevant to their needs and which were extraneous. The diffusion of elements of a 
cult through the provinces and to Rome and back, made possible by an improved 
infrastructure, meant that the cult became more global but at the same also more 
regional. By coming into contact with the global cult and by meeting other cultures, 
their own cult became more defined (see Whitmarsh, section 1.1.2). 
1.1.2 Identity and Regionalism 
This thesis will then examine the regional and global features of the cults of 
Asclepius. This work is underpinned by other current research as scholars have been 
addressing these issues in the classical world. A variety of theories have been offered 
but none of these by itself seemingly offers an all-inclusive explanation for the cults 
regional and global characteristics. It is only when all of these elements are 
combined that a cohesive image of the nature of the cult of Asclepius is created. The 
first of these theories is offered by Whitmarsh who argues that the idea of the local is 
created by a global perception of the world. People do not view themselves as local 
until they come into contact with the wider world, and globalism, therefore, causes 
an intensified view of regionalism.30 This realisation leads to an adaptation of ones 
identity as self-awareness and a consciousness of other identities are at the core of 
regional identity, which is not static but is in constant dialogue with global 
identities.31 This local distinctiveness, in fact, needed another identity, a panhellenic, 
30 Whitmarsh (2010) 2. 
31 Goldhill (2010) 49; Whitmarsh (2010) 3; Broodbank (2013) 506. 
national, imperial, or cosmopolitan one, to define itself against.32 For the cult of 
Asclepius this would mean that regional characteristics would gain prominence when 
confronted with the advent of Empire. Thus, a strong provincial or civic cult identity 
could in theory be expected, at least at the larger cult-sites. The awareness of local 
and trans-regional distinctiveness was already present in antiquity as is illustrated by 
comparing two authors, namely Aelius Aristides, who celebrated the unified culture 
of the Roman empire and implied that all conquered people were happy to give up 
their local culture for Rome, and Pausanias, whose travel accounts celebrated local 
culture and indicated how varied and diverse it was.33  However, the differences 
between these two authors are perhaps not as clear-cut as just this. As Whitmarsh 
states: 
Clearly, local culture  - particularly cult, art, architecture and inscription  is at the 
heart of Pausanias construction of Greekness. But for all its dependence on 
localism, Greekness is for Pausanias not reducible to it: Greece is the panta, the all 
things, the translocal umbrella that unites the different locales.34 
Pausanias seems to have a dual perspective where he examines the local and 
translocal at the same time.35 Both of these authors offer particular evidence for the 
cult of Asclepius and it is notable that they are the ones Whitmarsh uses as 
paradigms. These authors are emblematic of the multi-faceted worship of Asclepius 
as they offer examples of both regional versions of the cult and of the global cult. 
Whitmarsh argues that there was a general trend towards a pan-imperial culture, 
especially with the expansion of citizenship, but this did not mean that regional 
identity vanished. In fact, centralisation actually strengthened regional diversity and

would have caused an inter-reliance of Pausanian regionalism and Aristidean global 
unity.36 Regional Asclepieian micro-identities would have been buried within 
Asclepieian global macro-identities, with a high degree of interconnection.37 
1.1.3 Competition and Connectivity 
A second explanation for regionalism in the cult of Asclepius lies in civic 
competition, which was especially rife among the poleis of Asia Minor. An example 
of this is on homonoia coins minted by these cities, many featuring Asclepius as the 
polis-deity of Pergamum, are visible testimonies to the constant competition to be 
the first city in Asia as well as the high level of connectivity between these poleis 
(see section 3.4.5).38 Rpke has undertaken extensive research on connectivity in 
ancient religion. He understands religious and cultic actions as communication 
where spatial and temporal limitations are overcome by the act of reporting actions 
via inscriptions and dedications.39 When religion is interpreted as a communicative 
system, it creates a framework in which dedications and inscriptions can be 
analysed.40 Most religious actions are regional actions which become obsolete over 
time unless specifically recorded. Inscriptions and dedications are tangible reminders 
of a successful communication between god and human placed in surroundings 
where such communication constantly takes place.41 The Imperial period stands out 
for Rpke as it was then that a grid of regional networks, in the form of dedications

and inscriptions, developed, of which there is only fragmentary evidence now.42 This 
religious infrastructure is integral to Graeco-Roman religion.43 This development of 
regional networks underlines the Roman Imperial era as a vital period in the study of 
the cult of Asclepius as only then can a cohesive picture of the cult be created. 
Rpke stresses, like Chaniotis (see section 1.1.4), that the defining characteristic of 
these networks was not that there was a global uniformity but that active competition 
between local cities existed which created regional interpretations of cults. He states 
Competition among communities not only caused emulation, and consequently 
dissemination of rituals; it also caused differentiation, that is, the development of a 
particular local profile of a cult. It will be shown that this also happened within the 
cult of Asclepius, especially in Asia Minor (see section 3.4.5).44 This is in contrast 
but also complementary to what Whitmarsh has argued (see above). Civic 
competition should therefore be seen as a second explanation for regionalism, 
corresponding to the theory that people only viewed themselves as local when 
confronted with another, global, identity. This regional context does not leave much 
room for an empire-wide religion but this did exist in the form of pro salute 
dedications on behalf of the emperor which are found throughout the empire and 
perhaps also in the form of emperor worship.45  Rpkes work is very influential for 
this thesis as he stresses that in order to establish whether or not there was a regional 
variant of a cult, one must analyse the extent to which certain cultic forms managed 
to take hold in an area.46 The factors listed above show the various ways in which the 
cults of Asclepius adapted to the reality of the Roman Empire. Rpke argues that 
42 Rpke (2011) 23; Rpke (2015) 333 states that the Empire allowed for a diffusion of ideas and 
media.

study of provincial religions allows a scholar to connect a geographically regional 
perspective of a cult with the global one of the empire as a whole. It is then possible 
to examine the religions of groups such as the army but also the expansion of certain 
cultic elements and organisations which are not limited by region, as well as those 
which are bound to a specific place.47 He also stresses the role of provincial elites in 
the importation and adaptation of new cults (see section 3.1) and notes the pivotal 
phase which preceded the actual conquest, namely the period of trading between 
Romans and locals.48 
1.1.4 Conquest and Regionalism 
These theories offer a framework for innovative study of the cult of 
Asclepius and also new perspectives on antiquity. Chaniotis stresses the importance 
of non-Classical theories for Classical scholarship. He states that: 
It is usually expected that classicists import interpretative approaches and theoretical 
models from other disciplines  the social sciences, literary theory, religious theory 
etc. Such imports have indeed been fruitful, as long as those who apply them do not 
forget that the foundation of classical studies is the sources and as long as they are 
aware of the limitations of theory transfer.49 
The Imperial period forms an interesting starting point for research on the cult of 
Asclepius and can show the adaptation of a cult to a new world at the centre of 
which was the emperor. This is underlined by Chaniotis in a second article where he 
argues that the establishment of the principate meant that new ritual forms of 
communication between emperor and subjects were introduced which affected 
47 Rpke (2011) 31. 
48 Rpke (2001) 71, 79. 
49 Chaniotis (2012) 319. 
religion. An example of this is the celebration of the emperors advent to a city (see 
section 3.4.4).50 
Roman conquest and the formation of Roman provinces furthermore meant 
that the nature of religious authority changed. Before the coming of Rome, the 
governance of rituals was an internal affair. After the conquest, Romans first took up 
the role of arbitrators in such affairs and later became the ultimate authority over 
what kind of ritual was appropriate.51 In the Greek cult it was enough to simply erect 
a votive but in the Roman worship of Asclepius, public thanks-giving was an 
important part of the cult as is demonstrated by a 3rd-century AD inscription from 
Rome: 
[]       - 
             -  
             
    .52  
Yet, even when a new god was introduced into an area of Roman rule, this did not 
mean that a new ritual was also introduced. People could worship a new god, or an 
old god with a new epithet, in old ways.53 A third explanation for supra-regionalism 
and regionalism in the cult of Asclepius is that in some cases, cities resisted the 
homogenisation of religion by reviving ancient local rites and traditions (see section 
5.4.5).54 Ritual transfer did take place and this was heavily influenced by local

rituals but also very importantly it effected differentiation in rites.55 Thus, it is to be 
expected that if the emperor or other influential officials showed a strong preference 
for a particular god or rite, neighbouring cities would seek to raise their own status 
by also laying claim to this god or rite as seemingly happened when Caracalla 
patronised the cult of Asclepius at Pergamum (see Chapter 3), but also that they 
would seek to develop their own cultic version in order to compete with and triumph 
over their neighbours. 
1.1.5 Connectivity and the Mediterranean 
Communication is one of the key elements of connectivity. Horden and 
Purcell examine the central role of the sea in antiquity and how it influenced and 
shaped the Mediterranean world via its communicatory function.56 The sea signals 
the place from where a new region starts: it is a clear and distinct geographical 
marker which defined the world.57 This demarcation goes hand in hand with the 
notion that the sea creates a single entity.58 Broodbank notes that the centrality of the 
Mediterranean was already observed in antiquity, as can be seen from ancient 
maps.59 
Fragmentation and connectivity were the characteristics of the 
Mediterranean.60 Horden and Purcell argue that the sea was a vital tool for 
communication and that Rome especially depended on the sea for nautical

communication with all the far corners of the empire.61 They note that past scholars 
already observed that antiquity was continuously ruled by a series of 
Thalassocracies: whoever governed the sea, controlled communication, and in doing 
so ruled the Mediterranean.62 Shaw, who reviewed the work, notes that the authors 
never explain how and why the sea both isolates and links. He argues that it is 
probably because the sea allows for more extensive communication but that this 
would only be available to a few and not to the majority of people.63 This 
communication and mobility also affects religious patterns and behaviour as locality 
is determined by exchanges between people and a mutable group of environmental 
conditions. Sanctuaries form foci in this system of exchanges and their density and 
connections give a basic concept of religious geography.64 The sea once again plays 
a vital part in this as it is the medium of religious differentiation and the vehicle for 
divine transformation.65 However, while the sea can facilitate horizontal transmission 
of these changes, it can also form a barrier against them.66 The sea as a blockade then 
actually promotes cultural differences and works against a Pan-Mediterranean unity.  
Voyages and communication played an important role in ancient religion. 
Travel linked the various sanctuaries and the flexible nature of sacred journeys 
played a big part in this (see section 3.2.2). These sacred travels involved a 
discontinuation of normal social life and every journey could turn into a religious 
one, even if it did not start out that way.67 In the same fashion, any and every place 
could turn into a place of contact with the divine.68  Religious travel played an

important part in most cults but was present especially in healing cults and oracles, 
which often went hand-in-hand.69 Travel was a common part in the cult of Asclepius, 
with supplicants journeying great distances to be healed in a particular shrine and 
individuals importing the cult from far-away mother-sanctuaries. En masse group 
travel is largely unknown, with the exception of the army, and supplicants were 
largely motivated by their personal concerns.70 As Asclepius was mainly concerned 
with the health of the individual, this would have made him especially suited as a 
god to whom worshippers travelled to supplicate. However, he was also remarkable 
as the army was one of the main factors in his later dissemination across the Roman 
provinces. Travel and movement will be key themes of this thesis with every factor 
for the impact of Empire relying heavily on mobility and connectivity.  
Malkin furthers Horden and Purcells idea of a Mediterranean connectedness. 
He argues that the Greeks spread across the Mediterranean, founding colonies whose 
links with their mother-cities reduced the metaphysical distances between these 
poleis and turned the Mediterranean into a Small World.71 The sea plays a key role 
in the creation of a small world. It is the factor which allows these connections and 
migration to take place as it was this seaborne and coastal existence which allowed 
for the creation of lateral connections.72 Geographical distance worked the same as 
temporal distance and awakened the desire to affirm a sameness or koine.73 Through 
colonisation, the Greeks became aware of their shared culture but also of what their 
regional idiosyncrasies were. Malkins theory echoes Whitmarshs ideas of how the 
regional is created by the global and that people do not view themselves as being

local until they come into contact with the wider world.74 Globalism causes an 
intensified view of localism. These identities were not static and local identity would 
not have been the same for an individual living at the end of the 1st century BC as it 
would have been for someone living two centuries earlier.75 The issues of static 
versus dynamic identities will be addressed in the third chapter, where the influence 
of imperial patronage on the cult, and the effects this had on individual sanctuaries 
will be shown. 
1.1.6 Impact of Empire 
Thus, there are seemingly three factors which could have facilitated regional 
characteristics in the cult of Asclepius. This thesis aims to examine how these 
Asclepieian identities were formed by examining the cult in various regions, where 
the god was worshipped by various groups of people or individuals and seeing how 
the cult was altered by contact with the Empire in these regions.  Only when this is 
clear will the interconnectedness between these cults become clear. The timeframe 
for this thesis will extend from 27 BC until Severus Alexanders death in AD 235. 
The Empire has also been chosen as a time period as during this period many of the 
factors which may have influenced the cult were created or evolved further, notably 
emperors and a professional army. It is possible that when the cult of Asclepius came 
into contact with the Roman Empire, it was transformed in certain ways. Each 
sanctuary could show distinct rites which were specific to that one locality alone. It 
also seems imaginable that increased mobility in this period resulted in a global cult 
74 Whitmarsh (2010) 2. 
75 Wallace-Hadrill (2012) 375. 
which would have facilitated transference and dissemination of the cult.76 Mobility 
and movement will be the key themes for this thesis as the factors analysed here 
relied on mobility to reach other areas. This will be shown predominantly via 
travelling emperors and by the movements of the army. Both of these influenced the 
cult in the areas they reached but in different ways. Emperors visited and altered 
existing sanctuaries whereas the army brought the god with them and facilitated the 
creation of new cult places. Mobility facilitated the creation of cultic choice. 
The language of dedication constantly changed during antiquity: for example 
during the 4th century BC dedications started to be called thank-offerings, 
signalling a closer relationship with the god. An interesting development occurred 
during the Empire as there is evidence that during the Imperial period, gods became 
more heedful of their dedicators offerings but that they also became more 
demanding by sending instructions via dreams and oracles, which was shown in 
inscribed dedications by the term hearing/.77 This term also occurred in 
many Asclepieian inscriptions such as this 2nd-3rd-century BC dedication from 
Attica:

.78  
This indicates that there is scope for research into the impact of the Roman Empire 
on the cult of Asclepius. This period, furthermore, has been chosen, as the cult in the 
Roman era, especially in the provinces, has been overlooked by most research of the 
cult of Asclepius. Emblematic of this are Jurgen Riethmller who focuses mainly on

the sanctuaries of mainland Greece in the Classical and Hellenistic eras and Milena 
Melfi whose excellent work does examine the cult in the Roman era but focuses on 
the mainland and Greek islands.79 
1.1.7 Dissemination 
It is, therefore, clear that an awareness of a cults dissemination is vital for 
understanding how regional and global elements functioned and in what ways they 
were connected. Davies offers an excellent case-study in his work on the spread of 
the Apollonian cult titles Pythios and Pythion of why understanding dissemination 
matters. These were originally locational epithets and it was unusual for these to 
spread beyond their sanctuary.80 As they did do so, there must be an explanation for 
this, one understood in terms of geography, human need, and cult transferral.81 
Although, Davies did not find a reason for the dispersal of these epithets, he makes 
several valuable observations about dissemination of cults in general. Davies sets out 
methods of cultic movement which are shown in column one in the table below. The 
second column shows how they relate to the cult of Asclepius:82

Table 1: Reasons for the dissemination of a cult and its application to the cult of Asclepius with data 
from Davies (2005). 
The cult of Asclepius was disseminated in seven out of the eight stated methods, 
demonstrating the diversity of reasons behind the cults spread. Davies states that 
these approaches show the commonest factors behind a communitys decision to 
import a cult and bind a gods powers.83 The spread of the cult is very important for 
this thesis as its purpose is to show the influence of Rome on the cult through its 
global and regional characteristics. These can only be fully understood if the 
connections between these sanctuaries can be traced and related to one another. The 
cult has a further reason for being a good case-study for this as it promoted both 
kinds of religious travel. Individuals travelled great distances to worship the god in a 
specific place but group travel, in the only form in which it really took place namely 
the army, also took place and was especially influential in the cults spread in the 
Roman era. Davies research into Apollonian epithets, a god closely related to 
Asclepius, therefore, offers vital insights into parallels for the dissemination of 
divine cults in antiquity. 
1.1.8 Religious Change in the Provinces 
83 Davies (2005) 62. 
Having examined various methodologies which will be adopted in this thesis, 
this section will look at the impact of Rome on a number of non-Asclepieian 
religions and cult. This is done in order to place Asclepius within his proper religious 
context and to illustrate parallel effects in other, non-Asclepieian, cults, which 
indicates the further scope on the impact of the Roman Empire on cults. Most studies 
concerned with associations between native gods and Romans focus on interpretatio 
Romana. This is mainly taken to mean that similar ideas of the deities involved 
showed links between Roman and native deities and that the Romans introduced 
these connections (see Chapter 5).84 However, the development of religion should be 
seen as being ruled by an intricate negotiation between external and internal devices 
and desires, i.e. via contact between the goals and wishes of Imperial government 
and those of the native population with their regional variations.85 Derks cautions 
against the use of the term interpretatio Romana as it implies that the Roman and 
native deity are identical and implies that the native gods have the same capabilities 
as those of the Roman gods.86 However, as a tool for understanding the impact of 
Rome on cults it is of vital importance and also a good descriptive term. It is also 
important to understand the difference in Roman attitudes towards the east and the 
west. Their ethic of civilisation meant that in the Greek world Rome claimed to 
restore discipline after the conquest whereas in the barbarian west Rome created 
order.87 
The cult of Jupiter Dolichenus is a good example of the impact of empire on 
a cult. Nothing is known about the cults theology; it is only identified from about 
84 Derks (1991) 236. 
85 Alcock (1997) 105 also notes the great differences in the development of the provinces which 
resulted in greatly varied landscapes in each individual province.

87 Whittaker (1997) 144. 
430 dedications which reveal the cults distribution pattern.88 Dolichenus was a 
Hittite deity assimilated with Jupiter, but nothing is reported about the god from 
between the late Hittite period and 64 BC when Rome annexed Syria.89 Religious 
syncretism is especially noteworthy as it concerns an essential aspect of cultic 
change.90 The cult boomed in popularity between AD 125 and 230 particularly 
among the northern frontiers and was especially popular with the army but was also 
worshipped by civilians.91 In Rome itself there were three probable cult sites: a 
civilian cult on the Aventine; a mixed civilian and military cult on the Esquiline; and 
probably a cult for cavalrymen on the Caelian.92 The god also does not seem to have 
been particularly worshipped by Syrian units but was worshipped by soldiers from 
all over the empire.93 Depictions of the god were fairly homogeneous which, 
together with a relatively short period of transmission, Collar takes to mean that the 
cult travelled in a coherent and unified form though established social networks.94 
She argues that people who worshipped this god were already in place and formed an 
open system of communication, namely Roman army officers.95 This was because 
peoples social ties would facilitate the spread of ideas.96 The officers would have 
had close ties with comrades-in-arms and the spread of the cult would have been 
facilitated by the frequent movement of officers between legions and across the

90 Haynes (1993) 141. 
91 Collar (2013) 79. Collar (2013) 93-4 connects the cult especially with the army as she states that of 
the 430 known inscriptions fifty-nine are uninscribed but of the rest 121 can be linked with the 
military. She also adds that a further forty-eight inscriptions can be connected with the army through 
geographical proximity to army sites. This would mean that 257 dedications are not connected to the 
military in any way (i.e. the majority). For a similar discussion for military involvement in the early 
spread of the cult of Mithras see section 4.1.1. 
92 Speidel (1978) 12.

94 He is generally depicted in the west wearing military dress consisting of a leather kilt, cloak, 
breastplate, greaves and sword which was a common representation for eastern deities. The god was 
also usually accompanied by a bull: Collar (2013) 88-9, see Collar p.88, Fig. 3.2. 
95 Collar (2011) 226. 
96 Collar (2013) 3. 
empire. There would then have been a trickle-down effect which is indicated by a 
larger number of officer than soldier dedications.97 These religious innovations 
would have moved through receptive social space.98 Evidence also suggests that 
people worshipped the god as he came and supplemented their dedications as they 
were accustomed to.99 A local interpretation of a cult is, thus, shown by the case-
study of Jupiter Dolichenus.  
In this case, the regional version was taken up by the army and spread across 
the Roman Empire. Worship of this god was introduced by the army to the civilian 
population, who then took up this worship. It is possible that Asclepius too was 
transported into various regions of the empire via the army and was introduced to 
local populations, most notably to the Balkan and Danube provinces (see Chapter 4), 
in a way which may have been similar to that of Jupiter Dolichenus. The soldiers, for 
whom Asclepius was a natural god to worship on account of his healing powers, may 
have imported the god and introduced his worship to locals. 
Woolfs article on The Religion of the Roman Diaspora also raises a 
number of interesting points. He notes the phenomenon of religious change when a 
cult is introduced into a new territory. Some cultic elements were less portable than 
others, some less important or more, and sometimes substitution or syncretism took 
place.100 He notes that many of the Roman priesthoods, such as the flamen dialis, are 
not found anywhere other than Rome and are, thus, an example of cultic elements 
which did not travel well and were bound to a single place. For the cult of Asclepius, 
this means that scholars should expect a high degree of regionalism in each cultic 
97 Collar (2011) 227. Collar (2013) 113 states that there was an increase in dedications to the god after 
AD 160 which could be explained by the epigraphic habit but she sees this as an information cascade 
which was the result of the activation of an a priori established military network. 
98 Collar (2011) 236. 
99 Collar (2011) 220.

centre. Woolf also notes that soldiers freed from the restraints of the city were free to 
take with them whichever cultic elements they wished, facilitating the creation of a 
regional cult.101 As will be argued in Chapters 4 and 5, soldiers played an important 
role in the Roman dissemination of the cult of Asclepius and as a result it is perhaps 
possible to expect a cult which was tailored to military needs. 
This chapter has shown why the cult of Asclepius is such an excellent case-
study for showing the impact of Empire and has also examined various theories in 
religious scholarship. When people and sanctuaries became cognisant of their place 
within the Empire, they also gained an interest in their regional version of the cult. 
This increased interest in a regional character of the cult could have one of three 
reasons behind it: firstly that for the local cult to exist, it needed to have a global cult 
to define itself against; secondly, that there existed an active competition between 
cities and cults in which the regional characteristics were stressed in order to make 
one particular cult appear supreme; thirdly, that cities actually resisted 
homogenisation and globalism by reviving ancient local rites and traditions in order 
to preserve their regional character. There was, thus, interreliance between regional 
and global cultic identities. When examining cultic aspects in the various 
sanctuaries, it will be interesting to note which aspects of the god these shrines chose 
to incorporate. The avoidance of unsuitable rites or the incorporation of new, 
specifically regional, elements will be a determining factor in showing to what extent 
there was a regional cult of Asclepius and also the impact of Rome on the cult. 
This thesis, then, will offer new insight into the cult of Asclepius as 
scholarship has generally mainly focussed on either the cult in the Classical period or 
examined the cult in specific sanctuaries without looking at how a shrine fitted into 
101 Woolf (2009) 251. 
the global net of Asclepieia. This work aims to research the impact of the Roman 
Empire on the cult of Asclepius by looking at the global and regional cult in the 
Roman provinces. The advent of the Empire may have augmented the global nature 
of Asclepieian cults and this thesis aims to explore this and the ways in which 
regionalism in the cult also changed and increased under the principate. Sanctuaries 
would have perceived themselves as being interconnected to some extent due to the 
competition which seemingly existed between them, where they were all vying to be 
the number one Asclepieion in the Mediterranean. 
Based on the various theories offered by scholars above, it would, therefore, 
be possible to expect that the Roman cult of Asclepius had both a global and a 
regional character in each cult site and that it should be possible to show the impact 
of Empire on the nature of Asclepieian cults. The creation of distinct characters 
should be more vivid in this period than in the previous Classical and Hellenistic 
eras. This thesis aims to bring new depth into studies on Asclepius by addressing the 
issue of the effect of Rome on the cult, especially in the Roman provinces. The 
geographical scope for this work will be North Africa, Egypt, Asia Minor, Italy, 
Greece, and the Balkan and Danube regions.

1.2 Impact of Rome on Asclepius 
This thesis aims to examine the impact of Rome on the cult of Asclepius. 
Even though the cult had flourished in the classical and Hellenistic eras, a secondary 
dissemination took place during the Roman Empire when the cult moved into the 
Roman provinces via, among others, the army. The Roman Imperial era has often 
been overlooked by Asclepieian scholars who prefer to focus on the Classical Greek 
cult. However, Asclepieian worship became more multifaceted over time and the 
Empire is a highly important period for understanding the nature of the cult. It is 
only when the global and regional aspects of the cult are examined that it will be 
possible to show whether Rome did have an impact on the cult, changing it in 
various ways and expanding worship. As a result of increased mobility in this period 
the creation of a global cult would have been more possible than before and this 
movement would have also facilitated transference and dissemination of the cult.  
Various factors have been isolated as vital for research into the impact of Rome on 
the cult and they will be discussed in the following chapters. 
The second chapter will examine the cult of Asclepius prior to the Roman era 
as it is only possible to understand the impact of the Roman Empire and the effects 
and changes it brought with it when the history and nature of the cult in the 
preceding period are known. A survey of major cult-sites before 27 BC will be 
presented as well as a case-study on the occurrence of epithets within the cult. Statue 
iconography will also be discussed here which is the main art form relevant to 
uncovering the impact of Empire on the cult as anatomical ex-votives ceased to be 
dedicated after the end of the 2nd century BC. 
The third chapter of this thesis will focus specifically on Roman imperial 
worship of the cult. Emperors in general had a resounding impact on the cults of the 
empire and their influence on the cult of Asclepius will also be shown. Not all 
emperors worshipped Asclepius to the same extent: Hadrian and Caracalla especially 
patronised the cult, whereas others such as Vespasian and Titus interacted with the 
cult on a lesser scale. However, Asclepius as guarantor of the empires wellbeing 
and the health of the emperor made him an attractive deity for them to worship. A 
sub-theme of connection and competition between sanctuaries will also be addressed 
here. This theme, and that of mobility, will also occur in other chapters. 
The fourth chapter will examine the Roman army and how it worshipped the 
god. The influence of the army on other cults in the empire will also be explored. 
Asclepius in his role as a healing deity was a logical choice for soldiers to worship 
due to the perilous nature of their profession. This chapter focuses specifically on the 
cult in the Balkan and Danube provinces and examines issues of mobility and 
dedicatory identity within the cult there. It will examine the effects of army 
movements around the empire and how this facilitated multi-directional religious 
transfer between Rome and the provinces. 
The fifth chapter looks at syncretism in the cult especially in Roman North 
Africa. It will first examine what is precisely understood by the term syncretism and 
then how this occurs within the cult of Asclepius. The worship of the syncretic god 
Eshmun-Asclepius will then be compared with that of the regular god Asclepius and 
it will be shown how it was possible to have multiple versions of the same god in 
one area and how these different gods were supplicated by and appropriate for 
different groups of worshippers. Mobility and increased choice through mobility will 
be key themes for this chapter. The army was especially influential in the 
dissemination of the cult in Roman North Africa and it will be possible to examine 
how the cult flourished in military circumstances. 
The key questions that this thesis aims to ask are: How did the Roman 
Empire impact upon the cult of Asclepius? By which factors did this impact take 
place? How are global and regional cult identities articulated in response to each 
other as a result of this impact? How did increased connectivity between areas play 
an important part in the creation and stimulation of cultic identities? Did Asclepius 
spheres of influence grow or adapt as a result of Roman benefactions? How did 
increased mobility influence the impact of Empire? and What were the provincial 
responses to Roman worship and dissemination of the cult? 
Chapter 2: Asclepius before the Roman Imperial Period 
2.0 Introduction: The Pre-Imperial Cult 
The cult of the god Asclepius is believed to have originated in either Tricca 
in Thessaly or in Epidaurus at some time during the 5th century BC. Worship of 
Asclepius continued and flourished throughout antiquity; by the end of the 4th 
century AD the cult of Asclepius had been disseminated all over the ancient Graeco-
Roman world. The god was known in different guises before the 5th century BC and 
the physician Asclepius is mentioned a number of times in Homer.104 Myth relates 
that Apollo, who was also worshipped as a healing deity, was believed to be 
Asclepius father.105 In many locations, such as Corinth, the cult of Asclepius was 
introduced to a sanctuary previously dedicated to Apollo. Over time, Asclepius 
worship eclipsed that of his father as a healing god and worship of Apollo became 
secondary to that of Asclepius, something which happened, for example, at 
Epidaurus.106 At some point the Delphic oracle ratified the cult of Asclepius, which 
had numerous important effects on the cult such as recommending the founding of a 
number of Asclepieia; legitimising him as the son of Apollo and Coronis; confirming 
Epidaurus as the gods birth-place; and also sanctioning his position as a healer.107 
This approval mattered greatly for the spread of the cult, with sanctuaries being 
established in most Greek cities, including Delphi, where a sacred precinct was 
granted to Asclepius at the end of the 5th century BC, something which furthered

connections with Apollo.108 Delphi ratified a number of Asclepieia and played an 
important role in the early history of the cult (see below). However, under the 
Roman Empire the role of Delphi changed and the oracle stopped playing a 
significant part in the cult. The early emperors did not consult the oracle as much as 
Hellenic kings and cities had.109 The number of dedications declined and while there 
was a level of interest from some of the emperors in Delphi, over time the sanctuary 
changed from an important consultation data-hub to a tourist attraction which 
engaged with memory and history (see also section 3.3).110 
This chapter will examine Asclepieian cults in the Classical and Hellenistic 
eras up to the age of Augustus. As the Roman Imperial era from 27 BC to the death 
of Severus Alexander is the time-period for this thesis, it is necessary first to provide 
an overview of the cult up to that point in order to be able to explore how matters 
within the cult changed during the Roman Empire. This chapter will, therefore, 
explore the dissemination of the cult and the methods by which this happened within 
the pre-Augustan cult. Regional and more generic characteristics of the cult will be 
examined and also how external factors, such as the patronage of Hellenistic kings, 
influenced the cult. This chapter will start by examining the earliest available source 
on Asclepius, namely Homer, and the view he presented of the god and the later 
ramifications of this. The general dissemination of the cult will then be discussed and 
the four main cult-sites of Asclepius, namely Epidaurus, Athens, Cos, and 
Pergamum, and the sanctuaries in Italy will also be examined in more detail. These 
cult-sites will each be discussed further for the Roman period in the subsequent

of a polis but should rather be seen as another way of adding prestige to a cult.

chapters. A general discussion on epithets and their use within the cult will follow 
this and the chapter will conclude with a survey of Asclepieian iconography.  
2.1 Homeric Origins 
Homer is the earliest source who mentions Asclepius but he does so only 
very briefly: 
      ,  
      ,  
     ,   
,   .111 
This passage is very important as it lies at the core of a long-standing debate in 
Asclepieian scholarship as to the birth-place of the god. Epidaurus claimed that 
Asclepius was born on Mount Kynortion which overlooked the sanctuary. The 
sanctuary had the Delphic oracle pronounce it to be the true birthplace over rival 
claims.112 However, the earlier Homeric passages, and also those in Hesiod and 
Pindar, led to some debate already in antiquity about whether or not Asclepius 
originated in Tricca in Thessaly.113 The earliest Asclepieian material from Epidaurus 
dates to the 5th century BC although there is some earlier material from the site 
which was originally dedicated to Apollo Maleatas.114 The sanctuary at Tricca has 
not yet been found or excavated, making it impossible to state with certainty which 
111 Hom. Il. 2.729-33: And they held Tricca and rocky Ithome, and Oechalia, the city of Oechalian 
Eurytus, and these were led by the two sons of Asclepius, good physicians, Podaleirus and Machaon. 
Willcock uses  and not  which is in the MSS as he notes that this does not scan correctly as the 
second syllable is short. He believes that at some point there was a genitive of the  declension in 
oo, intermediate between  and . See Willcock (2004) 207, n.518.

of the two was the older shrine. Riethmller notes that all of the major cities in 
Thessaly, such as Larisa and Pharsalus, had Asclepieia. He states that there are 
twenty-one sanctuaries which can be definitely be ascribed to Asclepius and four to 
six which are possible sites of the god.115 There is a clear concentration of Asclepieia 
in the east of the region, Pelasgiotis, the area where Asclepius is said to have 
originated. None of the excavated sanctuaries can be dated before the 5th century BC. 
The Homeric Hymn to Asclepius adds to the Thessalian connection as it 
claims that the god was born on the Dotian plain.116 This version of events is taken 
up by later authors such as Ovid who states that Asclepius mother, Coronis, was the 
most beautiful girl in all of Thessaly, and Strabo who calls the god the Triccan 
Asclepius, stating that Tricca was the gods first sanctuary.117 Aston comments on 
the fact that for Homer, Asclepius is nothing but a mortal healer and that he makes 
no reference to any Asclepieian hero-cult. She argues that Homer in general shows 
little awareness of the cult-aspect of heroes as for him they are just superhumanly 
good fighters. However, if by Homers time Tricca was an important sanctuary of 
the god, it would make sense for the poet to make reference to it in order to 
acknowledge its pre-eminent status.118 Homer generally eschewed magical elements 
and no reference was made to any later cult of other heroes such as Achilles or 
Menelaus.119 The absence of any mention of an Asclepieian cult in Homer could, 
115 Riethmller (2005) 1.78. 
116 Hom. Hymn Asc; Strabo 9.5.22 states that the plain is located in the centre of Thessaly and is 
surrounded by hills. It is located near the Perrhaebia, Ossa, and Lake Boebeis.  
117 Ov. Met. 2.542-632; Strabo 9.5.17. 
118 Aston (2004) 25; Edelstein and Edelstein (1998) 2.17 state that in historical times Tricca was a 
renowned town in Thessaly. 
119 Griffin (2001) 44-5: Griffin points out how Homer focuses on the death of a hero and his 
subsequent descent to the gloom and dark of Hades. In this scenario there was no posthumous light or 
blessing for the hero in Homer. The notable exception to this is the episode of Achilles horses see 
Iliad 19.392ff. The cult of Achilles at the tumulus at Troy is mainly known from literary sources and 
drew worshippers such as Alexander the Great and Caracalla but the cult was found in a number of 
places across the ancient world: Hedreen (1991) 313-4; Strabo 13.1.32. Menelaus was worshipped 
therefore, be more a reflection on Homers attitude towards gods, heroes, and men 
than on the cult of Asclepius at the time of composition. By the time the cult of 
Asclepius gained importance in the Greek world in the 5th century BC, it was not of a 
hero but of a god. If Asclepius was a hero for Homer, the transition between hero 
and god had to have happened before the 5th century. Another reference to Asclepius 
makes clear that Homer viewed Asclepius as a hero as he is called the  
/blameless physician (see sections 3.1 and 4.2 for Asclepius relations with 
doctors.120 Other Homeric kings healed wounds but none was ever designated as a 
physician; only heroes received this epithet.121 This appellation makes clear that 
Asclepius was not just a mortal king but was, in some form or other, suprahuman. 
Asclepius son Machaon is elevated above all other heroes with regards to healing as 
it is he whom Agamemnon summoned to heal Menelaus when he was grievously 
wounded in battle.122 Only a hero would have been capable of this feat of healing in 
Homer.123 
2.2 Dissemination 
Despite his presence in Homer, the cult of the god only spread throughout 
Greece in the 5th century BC and the first datable mention of an Asclepieion is that 
on Aegina as Aristophanes Wasps, staged in 422 BC, mentions this shrine.124 The 
cult was introduced at Athens in 420 BC (see below). Asclepius reached Olympia at 
this time, as Pausanias comments on a couple of statues dedicated to him and Hygeia 
near Sparta: see the Menelaion shrine which is located east of Sparta in the plain of the Eurotas: see 
Catling (1975) for an excavation report on the site.

by a Micythus of Rhegium, and also Corinth, where he was housed in a sanctuary of 
Apollo.125 He was housed here until the 4th century BC when the whole sanctuary 
was rebuilt in his name.126 Other sanctuaries such as at Mantinea, Sicyon, and 
Cyllene were also founded in the 5th century, indicating that the Peloponnese was 
quickly becoming a focal point for Asclepieia, as is shown by Riethmller who 
states that there were twenty-three sanctuaries in total there.127 The other listed 
sanctuaries show that Asclepius was spreading quickly to most other areas of the 
Greek world. During the 4th century BC more than 200 Asclepieia were founded. In 
the Peloponnese the cult spread to such poleis as Troezen, Halieis, and Gortys.128 
Messene, which grew to be an important centre for healing with its own version of 
the Asclepieian origin-myth, was also founded in the 4th century.129 Sanctuaries were 
also founded in Euboea, Lebena, Locris, Naupactus, and even Epirus.130 The cult also 
spread to Greek colonies such as Balagrae in North Africa, which was an Epidaurian 
offshoot, Tarentum in Southern Italy, and Akragras in Sicily (see below).131 Other 
important sanctuaries which were founded at this time were Cos and Pergamum, 
both at around 350 BC, and Rome in 293 BC (see below).132 
The sites mentioned here show that Asclepius did not reach all areas of 
Greece, with Boeotia not having any sanctuaries at this time. In his catalogue, 
Riethmller lists only five sanctuaries in this area, indicating that the cult never

became very popular here.133 This was perhaps because the Boeotians had no need 
for Asclepius at this time as they had their own healing divinity, Trophonius, and 
Amphiaraus was also close at hand.134 The cult spread to the Cycladic Islands such as 
Delos, where the connection between Asclepius and Apollo is once again shown. 
The Delian Asclepieion is especially interesting as, like Athens, it inscribed a 
number of temple inventories which indicate the types of items which were 
dedicated to the god here.135 
2.2.1 Epidaurus 
Origin myths name Epidaurus as the gods birthplace, something which was 
confirmed by the Delphic oracle, thus making it the principal sanctuary to the god in 
the Graeco-Roman world.136 The sanctuary is located southwest of the polis of 
Epidaurus and the cult of Asclepius was established here in the 5th century and was 
added to the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas whose cult had existed from the 8th 
century onwards.137 The cults development was slow in its early days as Epidaurus-
town suffered from political rivalries with other poleis and was not in a position to 
flourish.138 
133 Riethmller (2005) 1.79. He also notes that only Roman statuettes were found in Plataea, 
Sorosberg, and in Tanagra which could also have been dedicated to Amphiaraus.  
134 Amphiaraus was located in Oropus and Trophonius cult centre was at Lebadeia in Boeotia; Paus. 
1.34; Edelstein and Edelstein (1998) 2.248. 
135 The sanctuary was built here at the end of the 4th century BC. See IDelos 223.B39 and IDelos 
226.B7 for early mentions of the cult. IDelos 1417B102 for the Inventories dated to 155 BC. See also

is an inscribed patera from the 5th century BC which states: Mikylos dedicated this to Asclepius/ 
  : IG IV2 1.136. This was written in an early form of the Argive Greek 
script.  
138 Tomlinson (1983) 23. 
http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/Delian/minor%20Delian%20treasures/Asklepieion.pdf
Tomlinson argues that it was the Athenian plague which advanced the gods 
worship. The town was attacked during the Peloponnesian war by Athenian soldiers 
who could have carried the plague with them.139 The Epidaurians would have sought 
healing but it would also have been an opportunity for the Athenians to come into 
contact with this healing deity. The sanctuary attained international status in the 4th 
century BC as is attested by a grand rebuilding programme. Many theoriai were sent 
out to other poleis in order to seek affirmation of the new position which Epidaurus 
held.140 Epidaurus new status is also shown in the fact that many people travelled 
great distances to attend the festival and that many poleis also sent embassies to 
attend these rites. 
There is evidence that Epidaurus was the mother-sanctuary of many other 
foundations. The Athenian Asclepieion is arguably the most important daughter-
sanctuary (see section 2.2.2), but Pergamum was also connected to Epidaurus in this 
way. Pausanias reports that the Asclepieion at Balagrae was also an Epidaurian off-
shoot, as was the sanctuary at Cyrene, which in turn spawned the sanctuary at 
Lebena.141 This passage from Pausanias indicates how connected the Mediterranean 
Asclepieia were with Epidaurus and how this cult was at the centre of the web of 
sanctuaries. 
From the 3rd century onwards Epidaurus depended on the support of 
Hellenistic kings, which it received, in turn erecting statues to honour kings such as 
Antigonos Doson and Philip V.142 Fewer inscriptions and dedications were erected 
during the 2nd century BC as the political situation between the Achaean League and 
Rome degenerated, although there was some contact between Epidaurus and Rome

evidenced by the transportation of the cult from one city to the other. Even so, this 
did not seem to profit the sanctuary as its treasures were confiscated by Sulla and 
some physical damage occurred to the sanctuary during the Roman civil wars.143 
The miracle healings inscribed in the iamata are one of the best sources of 
evidence for how the cult functioned at this time. They show that supplicants 
travelled to the sanctuary, made preliminary purifications and sacrifices, and then 
incubated in the sanctuary, waiting for the god to appear to them in a dream.144 If 
they were pure, then they would be cured and in return would then make a thank-
offering which varied according to the supplicants socioeconomic status.145 Even 
though the experiences and healing which these testimonies describe were personal 
events, they became public via the act of inscribing them on stone.146 The iamata 
aptly show Asclepius double nature; on the one hand he performs surgery and other 
medical practices; on the other they show his divine/magical cures which indicated 
to the viewer that there was no limit to the gods power.147

Fig. 1: Plan of the Athenian Asclepieion. 
The Athenian Asclepieion (Fig. 1) is one of the best known excavated 
sanctuaries of the god despite probably only ever being of local importance. 
Asclepius advent in Athens is recorded in the so-called Telemachus monument (Fig. 
2) which records that the cult was founded in 419/8 BC.148 The incredibly detailed 
inscription gives an account of the gods arrival in the Zea in 420 BC. He was 
housed in the city Eleusinion whilst his sanctuary on the south slope of the Acropolis 
was constructed.149 Although the monument is very fragmentary it has been restored 
as a tablet carved with reliefs on both sides, which was supported by an inscribed 
pillar with reliefs on four sides.150 The monument is dated to 400 BC on basis of its 
148 SEG 25.226/IG II2 4960, 4960b; Riethmller (2005) 1.79: The city Asclepieion is one of nine 
certain and four probable sanctuaries for the god located in Attica. See Aleshire (1992) 87-90 for 
analysis of the Athenian dedicators. For the reconstruction of the monument see Beschi (1967/8) 381-

The gods arrival stands out as it is one of the earliest disseminations of the cult and 
it is also one of the best documented.153 The connections between Athens and 
152 SEG 25.226a: Telemachus set up the sanctuary and the altar to Asclepius and Hygeia first, and to 
the Asclepiadai and the daughters of Asclepius and  Asclepius at Epidaurus came from 
the Zea during the Great Mysteries and was led to the Eleusinion and Telemachus having sent for a 
snake from the gods house, led the god here on a chariot following an oracle. Hygeia came at the 
same time and this whole sanctuary was founded in the archonship of Astyphilus of Cudantidae. 
When Archeas was archon the Ceryces disputed the land and caused some disturbances. When 
Antiphon was archonprospered. When Euphemus was archon.he paid in full.and he 
fully equipped. When Charias was archon a peribolos was built away from the wooden gateway. 
When Teisandrus was archon the wooden gateway was rebuilt and the rest of the sanctuary was also 
set up. When Cleocritus was archon he planted a sacred grove and set down and decorated the whole 
sanctuary at his own expense. When Callias of Skambonidai was archon..Astyphilus was archon in 
420/19, Archeas in 419/18, Antiphon in 418/17, Euphemos in 417/16, Arimnestos in 416/15, Charias

Epidaurus were shown in various ways; for example one of the two festivals of the 
Athenian Asclepius was called the Epidauria and the other the Asclepieia.154 A red-
figure plate dated to 420-400 BC by the Meidias painter is one of the most striking 
expressions of the connections between Epidaurus and Athens. The Meidias painter 
was active in Athens between c.420-400 BC. The plate is believed to be one of the 
first representations of the god in Athens and shows the child Asclepius in the arms 
of the personified Epidaurus (Fig. 3).155 These identifications are confirmed by 
inscriptions painted on the plate which has [] above the woman holding 
the child and [] to right of the child.  is written above the 
seated woman.156 The tripod depicted and wreath suggest that the plate should be 
connected with a dithyrambic victory, the subject of which was the birth of the god 
and his childhood at Epidaurus, as well as commemorating and celebrating 
Asclepius arrival in Athens.157

No reason was given in antiquity for the cults importation but there are several 
possibilities. The most likely is the plague which ravaged Athens in 430-26 BC.158 
Concern for healing would have been at the forefront of the citizens minds, but it 
should also be noted that it took six years for Asclepius to arrive in Athens after the 
end of the plague.159 Most disasters in antiquity were not occasional but were regular 
events such as food shortages and these generally only had a local impact. However, 
they could also be taken as divine disagreement with human political actions. Such 
events showed that the gods were not on the side of the people, generally 
temporarily, and this could shake belief in the gods.160 It was generally up to local 
people themselves to deal with the aftermath of such events and in the aftermath of 
disasters there was a social expectation that the rich would help the poor in such 
158 Thuc. 2.47-54.

times.161 The Peloponnesian war would have made it harder for Athens to import the 
cult from Epidaurus but other sanctuaries, such as at Aegina, were closer at hand if 
the Athenians wished to import the god.162 The Athenians chose to import the 
Epidaurian god presumably because they did not rate the Aeginetan god highly 
enough due to the long lasting rivalry and tension between the two poleis.163 Aegina 
was in constant challenge with Athens during the 5th century BC and was seen as a 
considerable threat. The island was progressively marginalised and later suppressed 
by the Athenians who deported the Aeginetans, who were almost completely wiped 
out at the battle of Thyrea in 424 BC.164 By waiting for the right time, the Athenians 
made a deliberate choice to import the Epidaurian Asclepius, and, it should be noted, 
not the Thessalian one. 
There is no evidence for the boule or demos having been involved in the 
cults importation but the cult did come under state control at some time between 
c.360 and 340 BC.165 This cult was only ever a local cult and attracted supplicants 
from Athens and Attica and never reached importance beyond the Athenian 
empire.166 
The Asclepieian Inventories list the dedications given to the sanctuary from 
350 BC to the late 2nd century BC.167 The inventories list 1,347 dedications with most 
of the dedications falling into one of three categories, namely: anatomical ex-votos, 
coins, or typoi.168 The ex-votos rarely show signs of disease, which was more

165 Aleshire (1989) 14. Aleshire (1989) 14, n.5 stresses that it is necessary to define what is meant by 
state-cult and she outlines this as a cult where demos or boule, directly or indirectly, supervised the 
presence and character of the votives dedicated within a sanctuary. She argues for these dates as the 
annual rotations of priesthoods first suggest state-influence at this time; Melfi (2007a) 331.

common in later Roman votives.169 One of the more remarkable things which was 
noted from the study of these lists was the preponderance of eyes in the anatomical 
ex-votos, with over 150 listed, which has led scholars to argue that there was a 
specialisation at Athens for the healing of ocular illnesses.170 However, there is no 
direct evidence for this and Aleshire has clearly shown the biases in the available 
evidence.171 The majority of the eye-dedications come from Inventory V, one of the 
best preserved, listing 127 of these votives. These are more than double the number 
of the next most common votives which are bodies, of which there are sixty-five 
listed. Unless ocular diseases were suddenly very common in 250 BC, another 
explanation should be sought and a lack of votives listed in the other inventories 
should be taken into account.172 The rest of the ex-votos show that healing was 
sought for all types of body-parts at Athens. Noteworthy in the Athenian Asclepieion 
is the higher proportion of female dedicants than males.173 Women dedicated 
anatomical ex-votos more commonly than men, while men offered coins more 
frequently.174 There is a number of objects dedicated which are stated to belong 
specifically to women but jewellery was also commonly offered, the majority of 
which would have been dedicated by women. A number of physicians instruments 
were also dedicated at the Athenian Asclepieion which indicate continuing relations 
between the god and doctors here as at Cos and Epidaurus (see sections 2.2.3-2.2.4).

171 Aleshire (1989) 38: Some of the Inventories are better preserved than others and some are more 
loquacious than other inventories, reducing the number of dedications which could be listed. It is only 
for the years 349/39 and 399/8 BC that something resembling a complete list of all dedications can be 
presented, as Inventory IV lists all of the dedications located on half of the roof, the side walls, and 
one end wall of the temple. Yet, so much of the inscription is missing that even this presents a 
distorted image of the dedicatory habits of the supplicants. The evidence from the inventories is 
heavily biased towards the 3rd century as nearly eighty percent of the dedications listed are dated to 
this period.

The inventories show that a wide variety of objects were dedicated, from various 
materials, including gold and silver.  
2.2.3 Cos 
The exact foundation date of the Coan sanctuary is not known as there are no 
foundation myths or any other evidence which would suggest an individual 
transporting the cult to Cos. However, the cult is not attested in inscriptions before 
the 3rd century BC nor on coins before the 2nd century BC.175 It was during this period 
that the cult rose to prominence on the island and became one of the most important 
centres for healing in the Mediterranean, causing it to be named as one of the three 
main Asclepieia by Strabo.176 The sites excavators dated the sanctuary to around 
350 BC on basis of the architecture but Sherwin-White argues for the late quarter of 
the 4th century and Guarducci believes it was introduced in the second half of the 4th 
century.177 However, Interdonato argues that there is evidence for a prior cult on the 
site of the later Hellenistic temple complex, which can be dated to the 5th century 
BC. Her main evidence for this is are two inscriptions, one dedication to Paian and 
one sacred law, can be dated to this period.178 Interdonato notes that Paian is an 
epithet found with both Apollo and Asclepius.179 However, it is more commonly 
found in the former cult than in the latter which makes using this inscription to prove 
that there was an early cult of Asclepius on site here impossible. The sacred law 
mentions a temenos which according to her signals a cult organisation. She also 
refers to two testimonies in Pliny and Strabo who claim that Hippocrates used

iamata inscriptions to learn his art.180 However, no clear foundation date can be 
provided at this point. Later evidence offers some clues as to how people believed 
Asclepius came to Cos. A 2nd- or 3rd-century AD mosaic was found in a Coan house 
depicting the gods arrival (Fig. 4). 
Fig. 4: Coan Mosaic showing Asclepius advent. 
The seated man on the left is thought to be Hippocrates, indicating the connections 
between the god and doctors which flourished on Cos.181  The Hippocratic School 
thrived side-by-side with the cult and physicians claimed that they were descended 
from Asclepius, calling themselves Asclepiads. This mosaic shows Asclepius in his 
human guise, whereas Pausanias states that Asclepius in snake-form escaped from 
the ship that was transporting him from Epidaurus and went ashore here. The people, 
thus, took that as a sign that this is where the god wished his sanctuary to be 
located.182 Pausanias recounts that the god arrived in snake-form, just as he did in 
180 Plin. HN 29.2; Strabo 14.2.19; Interdonato (2013) 108. 
181 Hippocrates was believed to have been born on Cos in the 5th century BC. 
182 Paus. 3.23.7. 
Rome later on. He also believes that Cos was a daughter-sanctuary of Epidaurus. 
Yet, Herodas in his Fourth Mimiambic obfuscates matters by referring to the gods 
Triccan origins, implying that the Coan cult may have been a Thessalian offshoot: 
,  ,    
     
      
 []183 
Even in antiquity then, the Coan cults origins were unclear. The archaeological 
remains indicate that the sanctuary was built as a unified whole as part of a wider 
building programme in the 3rd century BC, which was ratified by the Delphic oracle 
before construction began.184 
The sanctuary prospered throughout the Hellenistic era as the island pursued 
a policy of neutrality where possible and often switched sides between the various 
Hellenistic monarchs fighting for supremacy in the Aegean.185 Cos stands out from 
the other Asclepieia as it was granted the right of asylia in 242 BC, and the Coans 
sent theoroi to the Greek poleis and Macedonian courts asking them to recognize this 
right for their festival.186 Panhellenic festivals enjoyed this right and by asking for 
recognition of the festivals right of asylia, the Coans were asking for recognition of 
183 Herod. 4.95. Greetings Lord Paion, who rules over Tricca and lives in pleasant Cos and 
Epidaurus. Greetings to Coronis who gave birth to you, and to Apollo. The manuscript containing the 
eight mimiambics and fragments of a ninth dates to the 2nd century AD. Almost nothing is known 
about Herodas himself, even the definite spelling of his name is uncertain. The Doric form Herodas 
would fit in with the few locations known from the texts which are mainly on the island of Cos: 
Zanker (2009) 1. He states that the location of the fourth Mimiambic should be taken as the Coan 
Asclepieion and the setting is Temple B on the second terrace of the sanctuary (see below). Herodas 
appeared to have lived during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphos (285-247 BC) and the fourth poem 
can be dated to between 285 and 265 BC: Zanker (2009) 105. The fourth poem describes the 
experiences of two women, Coccale and Cynno, and Cynnos slave Cydilla, who visit the sanctuary 
of Asclepius and offer a sacrifice (lines 88-95).

the Panhellenic status of their right.187 Out of the circa fifty letters concerning the 
recognition of asylia, there are six inscribed letters from royal courts ratifying this 
request which were found in the Coan Asclepieion (see also section 3.1).188 The 
sanctuary enjoyed good relations with most of the Hellenistic dynasties, with one 
king, Eumenes II, being honoured in an inscription located in the Asclepieion.189 A 
festival called the Attaleia was held in Cos-town, celebrating another of the 
Hellenistic kings.190 One of the site excavators, Schazmann, suggests that both 
Ptolemy VI and Eumenes II donated money towards the rebuilding of the sanctuary 
especially the new temple, stoas on the upper levels and monumental staircase.191 
Royal relations with the cult were, thus, thriving and influenced the running of the 
sanctuary. Elite involvement in the cult at Cos will be examined in further detail in 
section 3.1 and it will be shown how there was a degree of continuity in the practice 
with the emperors, but that this took a different form in that the Kings here seemed 
to deal more directly with the island through the Coan ambassadors, whereas later 
this happened through the mediation of important figures at court such as Xenophon, 
Claudius court physician. The Coans sent embassies to Hellenistic Kings to ask for 
their support but later on, with Xenophon being established at court, the Coans 
seemed to prefer acting through him or those related to him, as a more direct and, 
more than likely, swift and efficient way of achieving their goals.

2.2.4 Pergamum 
The cult of the Pergamene Asclepius was of only local importance up to and 
during the Roman Republican era.192 It was not yet the globally popular sanctuary it 
would later become (see section 3.4.4) and Athena was the main civic deity at this 
time.193 The Pergamene sanctuary of Asclepius was founded in the 4th century BC by 
Archias son of Aristaichmos. Pausanias informs us that whilst hunting, Archias had 
sprained his foot and went to the Epidaurian Asclepieion in order to be healed. Then, 
in order to thank and honour Asclepius, Archias brought the cult to Pergamum.194 IG 
IV 12 60 confirms Archias as the founder of the Pergamene cult: it states that a priest 
called Archias had been sent by Eumenes II as a theoros and that he was granted 
proxenia and other honours as his ancestors had introduced the cult to Pergamum 
from Epidaurus. The cult, thus, began as a private cult which was taken over by the 
polis in the middle of the third century, during the reign of Attalus I, mirroring the 
foundation of the Athenian Asclepieion.195 A temple was built and a cult-statue 
erected to the god at this point.196 Coins with images of this cult-statue and ones of a 
seated Asclepius with the legend   appear from c.240 BC 
(For example, see Fig. 44).197 The cult is not mentioned in any sources for a few 
centuries after its foundation yet there seems to have been an instant royal interest as 
from the first inception of the state cult, a member of the royal household served as a 
priest.198

The city and all of its territories came under Roman rule in 133 BC, when the 
last Attalid king, Attalus III, bequeathed the city to Rome in his will but the 
sanctuary fell into disfavour at the end of the Republican era when Mithridates 
ordered the death of all Roman inhabitants of Asia and the Pergamenes were all too 
keen to obey, killing the Romans who had fled to the Asclepieion for sanctuary.199 
After Sulla defeated Mithridates, Pergamum had to pay for its transgressions and lost 
its right of asylia, one of nine poleis in Asia Minor to do so.200  A further desecration 
of the sanctuary occurred in 85 BC when the Roman general Gaius Flavius Fimbra 
was murdered by his own slave, who then committed suicide in the Asclepieion.201 
These events caused a decline in worship at the Asclepieion which continued into the 
Imperial period and the city and sanctuary had a marginal and precarious role in the 
empire until the right of asylia was restored by Caesar in 47 BC after the proconsul 
Publius Servilius Isauricus had petitioned him for it.202 
Not many Hellenistic votives are extant although this could partially be the 
result of Prusias sack in 156 BC and also of an earthquake which hit the city 
between AD 253 and 260.203 Unlike at Epidaurus, no miracle healings were recorded 
at Pergamum and the healings which are recorded have their basis in daily treatments 
of fasting and bathing and not in supernatural miracles.

The cult of Asclepius is poorly attested in Hellenistic Italy.204 The god was 
transported to Rome in 293 BC and Livy states that the people sent an embassy to 
Epidaurus in order to bring Asclepius to the city on account of a plague.205 The god 
was transported via a ship in snake form but he escaped and went ashore at Tiber 
Island, which was taken as a sign that the god wished his temple to be founded 
there.206 The gods arrival was commemorated with a relief still extant on the island 
(Fig. 5). The sanctuary was located extra-pomerium at the time of foundation. Little 
is known about the temple here as little is extant; for example, it is not known if 
there was an abaton on site. Many of the Epidaurian daughter-sanctuaries imported 
the god in snake form, just as it happened here.207

A few sources comment on the gods arrival into the city but remain quiet on the 
subject after this until the age of Augustus.208 A festival to Asclepius is recorded in 
the Fasti Praenestini on the Kalends of January, which is a noteworthy date as other 
festivals celebrated around this time were concerned with the well-being of the state, 
implying that Asclepius also had a protective and healing function in Roman 
society.209 It is not explicitly stated that the Tiber Island sanctuary founded other 
sanctuaries, but by the end of Asclepieian worship there were four probable temples 
to Asclepius in Rome; it is likely that there was another sanctuary to Asclepius near 
the Baths on Trajan on the Esquiline (see Figs. 6-7).210 Further epigraphic evidence 
indicates that there might have been another cult site outside the Porta Flaminia and 
maybe another in the northern suburbs of Rome, past the Pons Milvius.211 An 
inscription was also found in which the schola of a funerary association was 
dedicated to Asclepius and Hygeia.212 Cult also occurred in sanctuaries of other gods 
and also in various commercial complexes and military sites (see section 4.2.1).213

In Latium itself there were only the Asclepieia in Rome, Ostia, Antium, and 
Fregellae.214 It is possible that the god was not popular in Etruria as native deities 
already fulfilled his role as healer, just as in Boeotia.215 Fregellae was a Latin colony 
founded probably in 328 BC and destroyed by the Romans in 125 BC after the town

revolted against them. No origin myths are given for the temple at Fregellae but it is 
possible that this was a Roman foundation as its foundation is dated to the second 
half of the 2nd century BC and a terminus ante quem is given for the foundation date 
on the basis of the letters of an inscription found on site (Fig. 8):216 
Fig. 8: Inscription from Fregellae showing dedication to Asclepius. 
The original excavators argued that Lucius Mummius could have been the possible 
founder of the cult and reasoned that the cult could have followed the model of the 
Coan cult.217 Over 4000 dedications were found at Fregellae with a great many of 
these being terracotta anatomical ex-votos, dated to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.218 
There is an unusually large preponderance of large votive heads deposited at this site 
but there is also a uniformity of material on site very similar to other votive deposits 
in Latium, Mid-Etruria, and Campania.219 At the Campetti deposit at Veii, sexual 
organs were more commonly found dedicated to an unknown healing god but in 
Fregellae they only make up four per cent of the total number of anatomical votives.

There were also a few cults of Asclepius in Sicily. Of these, the sanctuary at 
Agrigento is the best preserved extant structure (Fig. 9) and lies in the valley below 
the acropolis on which the three main temples were built. The temple was probably 
built in the second half of the 4th century BC. No foundation myths are known and 
there are no dedicatory inscriptions and only a few ex-votos extant which might shed 
light on the sanctuarys history.221

Fig. 10: Monumental Statue Head of Asclepius Fig. 11: Monumental Torso of Asclepius 
from Syracuse, 1st century BC.   from Syracuse. 
The monumental torso is made of luna marble and forms part of a colossal statue of 
Asclepius. Its dimensions are 154x90x37 cm and it was probably a copy of a late 
2nd-century BC original. It was found in Ortygia during excavations to build the 
foundations of Spanish fortifications. It was inscribed with a celebratory text in 
Spanish during the 19th century across the torso.222 The statue is noteworthy as it 
includes a dog next to the god, a very Epidaurian element (see section 2.4). The only 
real mention of the cult in any literary source is in Ciceros Verrines where he 
accuses Verres, the governor of Sicily, of stealing a statue of Apollo from the temple 
of Asclepius in Syracuse.223  
It is important to understand from and to where the cult spread as this forms 
the base of research into the later global character of the cult. Only by tracing the 
connections between sanctuaries, starting with their foundations, is it possible to 
make sense of similarities between various sanctuaries. It is logical to assume that if 
two sanctuaries shared the same place of origin, they then would also have rites and 
rituals in common. It is by exploring this communality that regionalism and 
globalism in the cult becomes clear. The Edelsteins believed that the Hellenistic era 
was the most important period when the cult of Asclepius grew in importance and 
became universally recognised.224 This belief is shared by Riethmller who believes 
that the cult spread to three-quarters of the Greek world in the Classical and 
Hellenistic eras.225 By comparing the cult in the pre-Imperial and the Imperial eras, 
this aims to show what the influence of Rome on the cult of Asclepius was and that, 
during the Roman era, the cult of Asclepius was disseminated even further and grew 
in popularity. Even though special attention will be paid in this thesis to the 
Asclepieia in the Roman provinces, it has been necessary to examine firstly the four

religiosum, non sustulisti? See also Cic. Verr. 4.43.93.

best-known and influential sanctuaries of Asclepius, namely Epidaurus, Athens, Cos, 
and Pergamum. The latter three are all daughter-sanctuaries of the former, indicating 
the focal nature of Epidaurus in the Mediterranean Asclepeieia and also the highly 
connected nature of these sanctuaries.226 
2.3 Epithets 
Each major Asclepieion, thus, had a unique history and it will be shown in 
subsequent chapters how this continued in the Roman period. It is important to 
understand the pre-Roman history of these sanctuaries as only then can the impact of 
the Roman Empire on these cult places be properly understood. However, there are 
also two other factors in which the impact of Empire is clearly shown, namely 
epithets and in the iconographical representations of the god. Both of these elements 
seem to have been fairly homogeneous and static in the pre-imperial period and 
greatly increased in variety and diversity under the Roman Empire. Therefore, both 
epithets and iconography in the pre-Roman period will now be examined so that the 
changes under the Empire can be fully appreciated.  
When Greeks and Romans spoke of a god, they often added an epithet to the 
gods name.227 These epithets described various powers and functions of the god in 
question.228 Almost anything could be used as an epithet. Divine epithets were 
already present in the time of Homer and they existed in Graeco-Roman religion 
right down to Late Antiquity.229 The Greeks and Romans believed in a polytheistic 
226 Although Cos could also have been a Thessalian off-shoot (see above).

229 Parker (2003) 173. 
world and the main problem with this plurality was choice.230 As Versnel points out, 
people dislike doubt and uncertainties which is why it was so important for them to 
make sure that they were addressing the right god.231 One needed to know the gods 
correct name in order to be able to pray to him. This section will look at the reasons 
behind the giving of epithets to Greek and Roman gods and the implication this has 
for the Graeco-Roman cult of Asclepius. As it appears that Asclepius had no epithets 
in the Classical period (see below), and that the practice only became habitual in the 
Roman period, this can be seen as an articulation of both the increased global and 
regional nature of the cult at this point. Coming into contact with the global cult of 
Asclepius, local sanctuaries and people wished to differentiate themselves, or the 
god they were praying to, by ascribing an epithet to this god. This follows the theory 
espoused by Chaniotis where cities resisted the homogenisation of religion by 
reviving ancient local rites and traditions (see section 1.1.4). Here, it could be 
possible that homogenisation was resisted by focusing on specific elements of the 
gods worship or topographical significance and, thereby, setting that version of the 
god apart from the global Asclepius found everywhere. Epithets will be discussed 
further in subsequent chapters, namely sections 4.4 and 5.1.3. 
Two very different approaches to ancient polytheism were taken by Vernant 
and Burkert. For Vernant and the other French Structuralists, the polytheistic system 
was created to classify divine capacities and powers. The pantheon was then a 
method to impose structure on the divinities.232 For Burkert, the polytheistic world 
was one of potential chaos.233 Even though their arguments seem diametrically 
opposed, they both agreed on one thing: it is impossible to define one god separately 
230 Versnel (2011) 25. 
231 Versnel (2011) 25. 
232 Vernant (1990) 94-5. 
233 Burkert (1985) 119. 
from the others. Vernant believed that no god could exist without the others and 
Burkert argued that each god was made up out of a number of characteristics, which 
were defined by their relationship with the other gods. Versnel calls it the difference 
between kosmos and chaos.234 Epithets could be used as a way to either organise the 
pantheon or to express the chaos that existed in the guise of a single deity bearing 
multiple names. 
2.3.1 Function 
For a supplicant, knowing a gods name was essential for addressing him, as 
without this knowledge a god could ignore the supplicants prayers.235 A worshipper 
needed to address the aspect of the god which was active in the sphere of influence 
in which he needed help. The cult epithet functioned as a focussing device, picking 
out the relevant function of the god.236 The various functions of the god could 
operate separately from each other. Even though one aspect of the god was pleased 
with a supplicants actions, another aspect could be displeased and Xenophons 
failure to sacrifice to Zeus Meilichios even though he had offered to Zeus Basileus is 
often quoted as evidence supporting this.237 The divine epithets seem almost to 
indicate here not just two aspects of the same god but two different gods. Each Zeus 
was perceived to be a different Zeus, much in the same way as modern saints are 
believed to be different in various places, which is important for the discussion of 
syncretism in Chapter 5.238 Versnel argues that Graeco-Roman gods bearing the 
same name but different epithets may, but need not, have been perceived as one and

237 Xen. An. 7.8.3-4. 
238 Versnel (2011) 67. 
the same deity, depending on the supplicants perceptions.239 The most important 
function of the epithet, then, was differentiation.240 Topographical and functional 
epithets both isolate specific elements of the god. In Hellenistic times, topographical 
epithets were also used as a way to express competition between cities, especially in 
Asia Minor.241 By attaching the citys name to that of the god, the city claimed 
ownership of the god.  
An epithet could be used by only one god or by multiple gods, either 
independently of each other or as a way to indicate a connection between the deities 
in question. Parker calls the former Trans-god epithets and states that these were 
often the vaguer epithets such as soter and hegemon whose use often became more 
frequent in Hellenistic times.242 In fact, the use of epithets in inscriptions and literary 
sources seems to have become more common in the historical era and continued to 
flourish well into the Roman period.243 Stallsmith argues that in Greek religion, 
divine epithets had a tendency to increase over time and it also seems that the 
number of epithets held by a god was seen as an indication of his importance as:244 
   , , ,  ,     
 [].245 
In Callimachus Hymn to Artemis, Artemis asks Zeus to give her many names. In 
doing so she is, in fact, asking to be powerful in multiple areas.246 Minor gods and 
heroes were often only ever called by their name and the more epithets a deity had,

the more powerful he was perceived to be. Aphrodite is thought to have had over 350 
epithets. These divine epithets could refer to specific functions, qualities, rituals, 
genealogy, places of origin and residence.247 By listing the various epithets of a deity 
one would ward off his anger at being wrongly addressed but also honour him by 
showing how powerful he was thought to be.248  
Even though some epithets were only used locally, they still reflected aspects 
of the god in question. As Parker states: 
Gods are like honey, or water: like them, they are in a sense the same everywhere, 
but in another noticeably different in every place.249 
The most common and the earliest epithets were toponymic, as cult centres were 
visible testimonies of the gods power. When a supplicant called a god by such an 
epithet, he honoured the god as well as indicating his power.250 Brul highlights 
some important features of epithets, namely that there was an uneven spread of 
epithets among gods. Not all gods had the same number of epithets as, for example, 
Artemis had many and Ares almost none. Various factors were in play for this, 
including a paucity of cult. Epithets were an expression of a gods success. Shared 
spheres of influence between gods were expressed by a communal epithet. However, 
there was no homogeneous spread of epithets.251 Pausanias distinguishes in his work 
between cultic and poetic epithets but also between local and Panhellenic ones: 
247 Versnel (2011) 61. 
248 Pulleyn (1997) 111. Pulleyn also noted that the idea that names were powerful was a phenomenon 
of post-classical syncretism. 
249 Parker (2003) 177.

      ,     
 ,      .252 
Thus, already in antiquity people paid close attention to the function of epithets and 
also differentiated their functions.  
Supplicants had a choice when addressing a god. They could either call him 
just by his divine name, just by his epithet or by a combination of the two. In 
everyday speech the former would probably be used but in more formal oaths an 
epithet would more often be added to the gods name.253 All three forms occurred on 
dedications. 
2.3.2 Asclepius 
Parker states that: 
[] the respectable list of epithets that can be assembled for Asclepius is an 
indication of how far he grew from the hero as which he began.254 
The numerous epithets ascribed later on to Asclepius were, thus, a statement of his 
power. Yet, perhaps with the early cult of Asclepius there was less need for a 
differentiation between the gods various functions: he was above all a healing god 
and active in that sphere. His activities were limited to this in the Classical era, 
although his spheres of action grew in the Hellenistic and Roman eras. While it was 
important for a mortal to correctly identify a god when he appeared to him, in the 
252 Paus. 7.21.7: And besides the many names given to Poseidon by the poets to fashion their works 
and those given to him of each place, all people give these epithets to him: Pelasgios and Asphaleios 
(Securer) and also Hippos. 
253 Parker (2003) 180. 
254 Parker (2003) 175. 
case of Asclepius this was probably not as difficult as in other cases.255 He usually 
appeared in a dream while the supplicant was incubating in the sanctuary, making 
worshippers predisposed to expect Asclepius. 
The cult of Asclepius grew more powerful in the Hellenistic period and it is 
from this time that the number of epithets ascribed to the god increased but even so 
the vast majority is dated to the Roman Imperial era.256 Most early inscriptions are 
simply to Asklepios.257  
   
 
 .258 
During the Roman Empire, the number of epithets which occurred within the cult 
dramatically increased. The above discussion shows that the more epithets a god had, 
the more areas he was involved in and, thus, the more powerful he was, Therefore, 
the increase in the number of epithets during the Roman era shows that Asclepius 
grew in power at this time and that his worship became more multifaceted. This was 
in contrast to other cults such as those of Aphrodite and Zeus, who enjoyed a large 
number of epithets from early periods of worship onwards.  
In the Hellenistic and Roman periods soter became one of the more common 
epithets given to Asclepius: 
[]    
255 See, for example, Odysseus identifying Nausicaa as Artemis at first: Hom. Od. 6.149-153. 
256 Versnel (2011) 412-3. 
257 See, for example, IG II2 3187 
258 IG II2 4372: Praxias, praying, on behalf of his wife. To Asclepius. 
[] v    
 .259 
This was part of a common trend where the epithet was given to many gods at this 
time but also indicates an increase in Asclepius power as the soteria which was 
sought from the god was not eternal salvation but was salvation from a specific 
situation.260 It mainly indicated bodily salvation which included physical and 
psychological healing, but also safety, protection and deliverance.261 It could also be 
used for salvation from the sea but did not have any theological implications.262 The 
fact that the Pergamene Asclepius (see Chapter 3) was called Soter is an indication 
of the increase of his powers. He was no longer believed just to provide healing but 
could also save individuals in other spheres of action.263 Chapter 5 will discuss some 
of the epithets which occur in the cults in North Africa. 
One aspect which is also interesting is the way in which epithets spread into 
new regions where Graeco-Roman gods had not traditionally been worshipped. The 
interaction between these gods and the native ones produced numerous new titles.264 
In the case of Asclepius this appears to have happened in Egypt, where Egyptian 
aversion to change forced the cult to adapt and caused the syncretic god Asclepius-
Imhotep to be created. Another important syncretism happened with Asclepius 
Zimidrenus or Sindrinus who appears to have been a local Thracian god. Another 
case of possible syncretism may have been Asclepius Culculsenus who also 
appeared in the Eastern part of the empire (see section 4.4).265 Epithets are a way of 
259 IG II2 4501: To Asclepius Soter and Hygeia, Tertianos on behalf of his son Kornoutos, a votive. 
260 Moralee (2004) 1. Moralee (2004) 17 states that there are a variety of meanings and translations 
for this term but he uses salvation as a translation throughout his work for consistencys sake. 
261 Moralee (2004) 17. 
262 Moralee (2004) 19. 
263 See, for example, inscriptions were Asclepius has saved sailors: IvP VIII 3.63. 
264 Parker (2003) 174. 
265 See, for example, IGBulg 3 1.1229, 1230.  
showing new regional characteristics of a cult and also the elements which a region 
believed were important about that version of the god, or elements which tied that 
cult to a specific locality. The Zimidrenus discussion will also aim to show the 
dedicators notions of identity and the way they perceived themselves to be a part of 
the Empire. Epithets used in Roman North Africa will also show the regional nature 
of the cult of Asclepius there, especially in contrast to other versions of the cult of 
the god in the same geographical area. 
2.4 Iconography 
As well as epithets, iconography is a way of showing the global and regional 
nature of the god Asclepius as there were both generic and very local representations 
of the god, both of which will be discussed in this thesis. LIMC lists seventeen 
different generic statue-types of Asclepius which could be found across the Graeco-
Roman world. For the most part these are variations on a generic Classical 
representation of the god, making him easily recognisable such as with the 
Chiaramonti type (Fig. 12).266 There is a complete lack of a narrative in Asclepius 
representations as none of his early mythology is present in his representations and 
he is rarely depicted undertaking any form of action.267 The god is generally depicted 
standing, bearded and wearing a chiton which is draped across his torso leaving one 
shoulder bare. He holds a staff in one hand around which a snake, a symbol of 
revitalisation and healing, is coiled.  
266 LIMC Asklepios nos 115-392. 
267 For example his death at Zeus hands: Holtzmann (1981) 865. 
Fig. 12: Asclepius depicted in the Chiaramonti Type, 2nd century AD, Rome. 
The other statue types are all listed in LIMC as variations of the Chiaramonti type. 
Three of these other types are the Campana and Este types. In the Campana statue 
type Asclepius has an athletic, muscular, look and leans on his right leg which makes 
his hip jut out. He holds his snake-staff in his right hand while his chiton leaves his 
chest bare to his stomach, which is covered by drapery.268 In the Este type the hip 
bone is more accentuated and Asclepius body leans on his staff which is fixed 
underneath his armpit. The drapery is distinctive by lying diagonally across his chest 
and there is a triangular fold on his thigh.269 In the Giustiani Type, Asclepius right 
leg is flexed and his staff is placed under his armpit while his left fist lies on his hip. 
His mantel covers his entire body except his torso and his right shoulder. The edge 
of this mantel forms a bulge starting at his right armpit, runs down his torso to his 
268 Holtzmann (1981) 884. 
269 Holtzmann (1981) 886. 
left elbow.270 While these statues are visibly recognisable as Asclepius, they differ in 
details such as the drapery or positioning of the body from the Chiaramonti type.  
The most notable exception to the standing cult statue type is the cult-statue 
at Epidaurus, sculpted by Thrasymedes, depicts the god seated and a dog sits next to 
the chair. The statue is no longer extant, but is known to us from coins and possibly 
one Antonine copy.271 The god rarely appears on ceramics, most notably on the Attic 
plate discussed above (Fig. 3) and also rarely occurs in paintings.272 Asclepius does 
appear on a number of reliefs in Athens but these seem to have been made only for a 
brief period at the end of the 5th century BC and have an irregular iconography.273  
 However, there are some variations to the standard representation of 
Asclepius. He is depicted as a baby on the plate discussed above and is also 
represented as a young man without a beard, which occurs on a Hadrianic medallion 
and also one dating to the reign of Marcus Aurelius.274 Most statues of this type are 
dated to the Roman imperial period. Further variations on the standard statue-type all 
seem to date to the Roman imperial period and will be discussed in other chapters; a 
statue-type particular to Pergamum, the Asclepius-Amelung, will be discussed in 
Chapter 3 and the cult iconography in Africa will be examined in Chapter 5. A 
representation of Asclepius, unique to Thrace, where Asclepius was depicted on 
horseback will also discussed in Chapter 4. Each of the types explored will show the 
impact of the Roman Empire on the cult in these places and will show that there 
were some further variations to the stock type.

This chapter has aimed to highlight some key points of the pre-Augustan cult 
of Asclepius. The early dissemination of the cult is vital for understanding the later 
patterns and nature of the cult. This thesis aims to examine the regional and global 
nature of the cult of Asclepius and it is only by understanding how the various 
sanctuaries were connected that it is possible to gain an idea of local cults. It has 
been shown how Epidaurus was at the centre of the Mediterranean Asclepieia, being 
the mother-sanctuary of many of the other important cult-sites, which in turn 
spawned other sanctuaries which were then connected to Epidaurus. The global 
Asclepieian culture was probably, therefore, predominantly an Epidaurian one, 
despite other claims that the cult originated in Tricca. It is, of course, always possible 
that the cult was transported from Tricca to Epidaurus but as the sanctuary has not 
been excavated, it is not possible to state how much of the Epidaurian cult was 
Triccan. Each individual cult could use the flexible nature of the cults core to adapt 
it to suit local wishes and needs, picking and choosing which cultic characteristics 
and rites they wished to incorporate into their particular cult. It was seemingly felt to 
be important to stress the Epidaurian connections, as happened at Athens, 
presumably because it was thought to be more prestigious if ones sanctuary came 
directly from Epidaurus, the birth-place of the god, than from some other shrine. 
This was possibly also the case with the cult of Asclepius in Roman North Africa 
which will be explored in Chapter 5. Even though Tricca might have been the 
original sanctuary, for the dissemination of the cult, Epidaurus was the sanctuary that 
really mattered as it was commonly perceived to be the gods place of origin. 
The individual cults examined in more detail also highlight some interesting 
points. Not all of the Epidaurian daughter-sanctuaries gained the same level of status 
as others but local cults could become pan-Hellenic ones and vice-versa depending 
on external circumstances such as the patronage of kings or political happenings of 
the polis. Asclepieian cults and their nature were, then, not set in stone but flexible 
and open to change. It is possible that this trend continued under the Roman Empire, 
with imperial patronage being vital for the success of a sanctuary. 
Furthermore, it seems that if there was no need for Asclepius, like in Boeotia 
due to the prior presence of Trophonius, then the cult would not be imported, no 
matter how important it became in the rest of the Mediterranean. This choice would 
have been undertaken on a regional or a polis-level so it is possible to expect that 
some areas are more heavily populated with Asclepieia than others. The 
dissemination of the cult was a regional choice and preference. Another element 
which will be shown in the following chapters to be distinctive to the Roman cult, is 
the role of external agents who impacted upon the cult, such as physicians and army 
officers.  
Chapter 3: Friends in High Places: Imperial Relations with 
Asclepius 
3.0 Introduction 
 Already in antiquity it was reported that Asclepius was open to worship from 
all people, regardless of gender or socio-economic status. The Athenian Inventories 
are often used as an example to illustrate this openness and also the variety of people 
who worshipped the god.275 The lists show that women outnumbered men in 
supplications to Asclepius here and also that professionals, priests, families, and the 
demos worshipped the god. The composition of dedicants to Asclepius was, thus, 
wide and multifaceted. This material has been used in the past to stress the 
accessibility of the god to the poorer people in ancient society.276 While this is 
undoubtedly true, it has then sometimes been taken that it was either predominantly 
or even exclusively the poor who worshipped the god.277 This was not the case, 
though, since Asclepius was also worshipped by the elites and cities. The Athenian 
demos supplicated the god for the wellbeing of the city, something which also 
occurred in Rome, where the god was imported as the result of a plague.278 In both 
cities, Asclepius festivals were held in between other civic festivals which were 
concerned with civic wellbeing and health. Municipal elites worshipped the god and

with all of these diverse groups supplicating Asclepius, it is unsurprising that Roman 
emperors were also attested worshipping the god.  
The aim of this chapter is to examine the impact of Roman emperors on the 
cult of Asclepius and also to research the provincial response to these supplications 
and actions undertaken by emperors. Emperors worshipped and honoured the god in 
different ways and with various levels of intensity, with Claudius, Hadrian, and 
Caracalla being the most influential whilst others seemingly did not patronise the 
god at all. The ways in which emperors supplicated Asclepius were also varied. 
Augustus is only connected to the god via his personal physician, Antonius Musa, of 
whom Augustus erected a statue next to that of Asclepius, presumably in the Tiber 
Island sanctuary in Rome, in honour and thanks for Musa saving his life in 23 BC: 
Medico Antonio Musae, cuius opera ex ancipiti morbo convaluerat, statuam aere 
conlato iuxta signum Aesculapi statuerunt.279  
Musa had served as Augustus physician from the time of Actium onwards but it is 
not known how long he served Augustus after 23 BC.280 The emperor had suffered 
ill health from birth but this reached its nadir at this time. Musa prescribed dietary 
remedies and cold baths for the emperor in order to heal him from his illness.281 
These cures saved Augustus life and he extended the honours given to doctors by 
his adoptive father Julius Caesar who had given Roman citizenship to all physicians, 
and granted immunitas to all doctors practising in Rome in AD 10.282  
279 Sue. Aug. 59.1; Michler (1993) 764: For the doctor Antonius Musa, through whose work he was 
able to recover from an illness, money was raised and a statue of him was placed next to a statue of 
Asclepius. Wardle (2014) 396 notes that Musa (PIR2 A853) and his brother had either been slaves of 
Marcus Antonius or his family and had been freed or that they had been members of distinguished 
families from the east who had been given citizenship by Antonius.

281 Michler (1993) 764-6; Sue. Aug. 81; Cass. Dio 53.30.3-4. Wardle (2014) 396 notes that Dios 
attitude towards Musa is generally hostile. 
282 Michler (1993) 783. 
Tiberius was represented as worshipping the syncretic deity Imhotep-
Asclepius on a relief on Ptolemy IIs gate on the temple island of Philae even though 
Tiberius never visited Egypt and is not known to have worshipped Asclepius 
anywhere else.283 This illustrates regional perceptions of the emperor and the 
standing of the cult there. People took an imperial supplication to a god and used it 
as a way of promoting and aggrandising a city or sanctuary. The imperial 
interactions with Asclepius, thus, took place across a wide geographical space. How 
these emperors worshipped Asclepius and which rights they gave to specific 
sanctuaries will be examined but also the wider effects of an imperial visit which 
could lead, for example, to building programmes or to a change within the regional 
dynamics by boosting the status of a particular city through a sanctuary. In certain 
cases the direct actions undertaken by the emperor are clear but in many instances it 
was the regional response to this visit which is the more striking. This chapter will 
examine the ways in which this was done and how provincial responses to an 
imperial visit might alter an Asclepieion. 
This chapter will examine three themes in relation to imperial worship of 
Asclepius and will focus in particular on three emperors, namely Claudius, Hadrian, 
and Caracalla. The first theme examined here will be the impact of influential people 
at court. Emperors did not always have an innate urge to worship Asclepius but their 
giving of honours to the god or a sanctuary could have been prompted by a member 
of their court or household who had strong ties to the cult. This is particularly clear 
in the case of Claudius grants to the Coan Asclepieion which were the result of the 
283 Hurry (1928) 84: the emperor offers incense to the god and is wearing the pharaohs white crown.  
influence of his personal physician, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon.284 Xenophon was a 
Coan who had studied medicine there. As an Asclepiad, he had strong ties with the 
cult and he used his imperial connections to increase the cult and the island in 
prominence. Xenophons self-representation on Cos, and the language utilised in his 
dedications there, emphasised his Roman past and this relationship will be examined 
in depth here.  
The second theme of this chapter will be that of the impact of imperial visits 
and travel. This fits in well with general research both into sacred travel, which was 
especially important and prominent within the cult of Asclepius, and into 
regionalism. An imperial visit would greatly boost the standing and economy of a 
city or sanctuary but only a few emperors travelled and only some visited Asia 
Minor, most notably, Hadrian and Caracalla who worshipped Asclepius at 
Pergamum.285 It was precisely these travelling emperors who patronised Asclepius 
and it is interesting that their greatest impact was not upon the sanctuaries at Rome 
but on those located within the Roman provinces. When a ruler sacrificed at a 
sanctuary, he created a bond between himself and the local gods; the emperor would 
give benefactions to the god and the city would bestow honours upon him in return. 
The sanctuaries at Epidaurus, Pergamum, and the other shrines in Asia Minor linked 
to the Pergamene temple via civic competition will provide the main body of 
evidence for this discussion.  
The last theme here is that of imperial rights and honours granted and how 
these factored into civic and cultic competition. This theme will not be discussed 
separately but features in the discussions of the other themes. New rights given to a 
sanctuary changed civic dynamics and relationships between rival cities. Both Cos

285 Dignas (2002) 134. 
and Pergamum gained the right of asylia and Caracalla granted a third neocorate to 
the Pergamene sanctuary after his visit to the city.286 A neocorate was the title used 
by poleis in Asia Minor to indicate that the city had been granted the right to host a 
provincial temple to a specific emperor. It originally meant temple warden and often 
emperors shared their temple with a polis deity.287 These honours had been granted 
before, though only in Asia Minor, but Pergamum was the first polis to be granted 
this right three times. This kind of right, thus, had both regional and also directly 
local meaning. These rights changed the cultic and civic dynamics between a group 
of sanctuaries or poleis and led to competition or emulation of events in other 
sanctuaries. A study of Macrinus actions in Pergamum after Caracallas death will 
also show how these rites could be tied to a specific emperor in popular perception 
and how later emperors reacted to the granting of these honours, such as the 
neocorate. 
 The main questions this chapter aims to examine then are: How did emperors 
influence and have an impact on the cults of Asclepius? How did people with close 
imperial ties cause benefactions to be made to the god? How did imperial (sacred) 
travel affect the cult of Asclepius? What were the provincial responses to imperial 
benefactions and how did these influence local dynamics? Pergamum will be the 
main focus of this chapter but the sanctuaries at Cos, Epidaurus, and Egypt will also 
provide evidence, forming a cohesive overview of imperial actions within the cult of 
Asclepius and both provincial and imperial responses to this.288 
286 Caracalla is unique as he is reported to have visited the Pergamene sanctuary with the explicit 
purpose of seeking healing from the god: Cass. Dio 78.15. This was unlike Hadrian who visited the 
sanctuary as part of his travels or other emperors who gave honours from afar.

This chapter aims to bring a new dimension to Asclepieian scholarship: when 
imperial influence upon the cults has been researched in the past, this has mainly 
been done for either one emperor or one specific sanctuary. This research will take a 
novel approach to the subject by examining imperial impact not by individual 
emperor or sanctuary but by studying the topic thematically, which will show both 
the similarities of imperial Asclepieian cultic benefactions, although for some 
themes there will be more evidence for the actions of certain emperors than for 
others. This, in turn, will allow for the overall impact of emperors on the cult and 
how imperial benefactions and regional responses to these changed a cult to be 
shown and also how these alterations would have affected other sanctuaries, which 
were all connected to a great degree. Each change would have caused emulation and 
competition within a region; imperial benefactions modified the cultic dynamics and 
the predominance of certain sanctuaries. This study will then also show the ways in 
which there was an imperial influence on the global and regional versions of a cult, 
acknowledging that there may have been both a universal cultic nature, which could 
also adapt as a result of imperial influence, and also a strictly regional version of 
each cult, upon which emperors visits and the provincials responses to these had a 
definite impact.

3.1.1. Introduction 
This section aims to explore the impact which influential people at court and 
elites had on the cult of Asclepius. These individuals were connected with both the 
emperor and a cult of Asclepius in some form and used their influence with the 
former to boost the standing of the latter. The person who had the greatest impact 
upon the cult as a result of his imperial connections was a doctor called Gaius 
Stertinius Xenophon. He was born on the island of Cos (See Fig. 13) around 10 BC 
and studied medicine there, making him consider himself an Asclepiad, indicating 
his close connections with Asclepius, something which is echoed in Tacitus who also 
has Claudius mention Xenophons connection.289 This section aims to research 
imperial impact on the Coan cult and to what extent elites such as Xenophon 
influenced this. First, the early imperial history of the island will briefly be examined 
as it will be shown that Claudius benefactions were part of a long-term 
development, culminating in the grant of immunitas. Then, Xenophons influence on 
Claudius will be researched and it will be shown how his presence at court prompted 
Claudius to bestow honours on the Coan Asclepieion (see Fig. 14). Study of 
inscriptions relating to Xenophon, either set up by the physician himself, or by 
people close to him and the demos, will show how Xenophon continuously referred 
to his Roman past and used it as a basis for continuing his privileged position on 
Fig. 14: Plan of the Coan Asclepieion.

his maternal grandfather and there was another doctor Xenophon, a student of Praxagoras, who 
practised medicine in the 4th/3rd centuries BC: Buraselis (2000) 76. 
3.1.2 The Coan Cult 
As was mentioned in section 2.2.3, no foundation myths are known for the 
Coan sanctuary but the cult was founded there some time before the 3rd century BC 
as it is from this point on that the sanctuary rose to prominence.290 The cult grew to 
be the most important one on the island partially as a result of its connection with the 
Hippocratic School and it was the presence of this school which set the sanctuary 
apart from other Asclepieia in the Mediterranean. Before the advent of Roman rule 
over the island, both the island and the sanctuary enjoyed the patronage of various 
Hellenistic kings, as is indicated by the various grants of asylia to Cos, which 
included the right of inviolability for the Asclepieion. Rigsby argues that asylia 
should predominantly be seen as a religious gesture, one honouring a god. Buraselis 
agrees, as he states that most of the rulers ratifying the right would be too far away to 
be of any practical use if the island was threatened.291 However, Cos also 
experienced the drawbacks of becoming embroiled in Mediterranean politics.292 For 
example, in 88 BC they enthusiastically welcomed Mithridates into Cos and allowed 
him to take from them the son of Ptolemy IX, Alexander I, who had been entrusted 
to the Coans by his mother Cleopatra III in 102 BC, together with Jewish treasures 
which had been given into their safekeeping.293 
This precariousness continued during the last years of the Republic as 
together with most of the Aegean islands, Cos sided with Pompey against Caesar. 
290 Herzog and Schazmann (1932) x. Excavations led by Herzog and his German team took place in 
1902, 1903, and 1904, during which the Asclepieion was discovered. More excavations took place in 
the 1920s, this time undertaken by Italian scholars.

However, after Caesars victory over Pompey the island quickly transferred its 
allegiance. A Coan, Theopompus of Cnidos, had to intercede on the islands behalf 
with Caesar, with whom he was befriended.294 The island was firmly under Roman 
control by 30 BC as is shown by events which took place in the Coan Asclepieion.295 
Cos was allied with Marcus Antonius during the civil wars but this did not work in 
its favour.296 Turullius, one of Antonius generals, required timber to build ships in 
preparation for the battle at Actium. Even though the Asclepieian sacred grove had 
been protected by sacred laws since the late 4th century BC, he cut down part of the 
grove to provide shipbuilding materials. After Actium, Augustus handed Turullius 
over to the Coans who executed him in the grove as ancient laws demanded that he 
suffer the same penalty as the uprooted grove.297 This incident shows Augustus 
willingness to adhere to ancient sacred laws and also appease the god and the 
Coans.298 However, Dio states that Augustus punished the cities allied with Antonius 
by levying money and taking away the authority of their assemblies.299 Therefore, 
Cos had lost its libertas and also its immunitas at the start of Augustus reign.300 This 
loss of freedom continued until well into the Julio-Claudian period but did not 
compromise the inviolability of the sanctuary of Asclepius which had been sought

298 Of course, this was also a good way to get rid of a troublesome enemy general and take revenge on 
Turullius as he was one of Caesars assassins. Augustus wish to placate Asclepius only went so far, 
however, as he took the painting of Aphrodite Anadyomene from the sanctuary as part of the fines 
which had been levied and dedicated it to the deified Caesar in Rome: Strabo 14.2.19. 
299 Strabo 14.2.19 mentions that the Coans had to pay a fine of one hundred talents, although this was 
remitted in repayment for the painting of Aphrodite.

by the Coans in 242 BC.301 The Coans were compelled to pay tribute to Rome until 
the time of Claudius and the general prosperity of the area diminished greatly from 
the Augustan age onwards as a result of this taxation and also the great frequency of 
earthquakes which plagued the island.302 However, even though the island continued 
in a diminished state, there was a relative state of stability under the early Julio-
Claudians for Cos. The island flourished under Claudius as a result of Gaius 
Stertinius Xenophons position at court. This case-study will demonstrate the impact 
upon a sanctuary which could be achieved by mediations performed by a Greek of 
high born status and influence.303 
Matters for both the Asclepieion and the island of Cos started to change from 
about AD 23 and Xenophon played an important role in this. Xenophon was born in 
Cos  and he is the first known doctor and priest, and is also the only known patron of 
the Coan Asclepieion.304 He became strongly connected to the imperial court and 
was personal physician to Claudius, archiatros, and monarchos, which was a type of 
Coan magistracy.305 During his time in Rome, he also assumed a lifelong priesthood 
in Cos of the cult of the Sebastos, which was likely Claudius in this case, the 
Sebastoi, and also the triad of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Epione.306 Xenophon went to 
Rome in AD 23, heading an embassy, in order to petition the emperor Tiberius so 
that he would reconfirm the right of asylia for the Asclepieion:  
301 Rigsby (1996) 106, 110. At this time the Coans had the Hellenistic kings ratify their declaration of 
asylia for the cult of Asclepius and also had them sanction that the Games held in his honour were 
Panhellenic and that his temple was inviolable.

his other roles. Xenophon was Claudius personal physician but other doctors were available to treat 
members of the imperial household such as Scribonius Largus, see the Compositiones.  
306 Buraselis (2000) 97. Epione was Asclepius wife.

urbes trucidarentur.307  
Tiberius did endorse this right and Tacitus claims that it was the antiquity of the cult 
which prompted him to do so. Before this embassy, Xenophon did not seem to have 
enjoyed an exceptionally high status in Cos and it seems that he remained in Rome 
and practised medicine there after the embassy.308 It was likely in AD 23 that 
Xenophon gained his Roman citizenship as one of the consul for this year was Gaius 
Stertinius Maximus who would have dealt with the embassy.309 Xenophon was the 
only member of his family to bear the nomen Stertinius and all of his relatives who 
gained citizenship were called Tiberii Claudii.310 It is possible that he served as the 
personal physician of Tiberius, whom he would have met as ambassador, and 
Caligula, but there is no evidence for this.311 However, it is certain that he did serve 
Claudius in this capacity. Claudian times called for a degree of conservatism and 
traditionalism in religion but Claudius also showed a great deal of toleration for 
foreign cults; for example he legitimised the cult of Attis in Rome, mixing religious 
307 Tac. Ann. 4.14.1-2; Martin and Woodman (1989) 44: In this year, there were embassies from 
Greek communities, the Samians and the Coans who petitioned for a reaffirmation of the ancient right 
of asylia for the sanctuaries of Juno and Asclepius. The Samians drew support from an Amphictyonic 
decree, which was the main body concerning all matters which at the time when the Greeks founded 
colonies in Asia and mastered the sea. The Coans had similar antiquity and approached their merit 
from this place, that they had sheltered Roman citizens in the temple of Asclepius when, by order of 
king Mithridates, these were being massacred in every island and town of Asia. App. B. Civ. 12.31.1;

conservatism and innovation.312 Claudius suffered constantly from a variety of 
illnesses.313 It is interesting, however, that no dedications by Claudius to Asclepius 
are known, other than his regulations concerning Tiber Island, and Asclepius also 
does not seem to appear on any Claudian coins. Suetonius states that it had become 
the norm for Romans to bring their sick slaves to the Tiber Island sanctuary in 
Claudian times, and leave them there to die. Claudius decreed that when this took 
place, the slaves were to be freed and that if they regained their health they did not 
have to return to their former masters.314  
Tacitus relates that Claudius, probably before he became emperor, asked 
Xenophon to serve as his physician but Xenophon refused as he earned more as a 
private doctor than he would as imperial physician. When Claudius increased his 
offer, Xenophon relented. It is possible that Claudius pursuit and Xenophons 
refusal could be evidence that Xenophon had not been an imperial physician; it was 
not a given that he would become Claudius doctor. In other words, that Claudius 
had not inherited him from his predecessors. He then accompanied Claudius on his 
British campaigns, for which the Coan received many honours, some of which were 
listed above.315 Importantly, Xenophon used his influence at court to prompt 
Claudius to petition the senate to grant immunitas to Cos, an event which the Coans 
had been working towards for some time, as: 
Rettulit dein de immunitate Cois tribuenda, multaque super antiquitate eorum 
memoravit: Argivos vel C<oe>um Latonae parentem vetustissimos insulae cultores; 
mox adventu Aesculapii artem medendi inlatam maximeque inter posteros eius 
celebrem fuisse, nomina singulorum referens et quibus quisque aetatibus viguissent. 
quin etiam dixit Xenophontem, cuius scientia ipse uteretur, eadem familia ortum, 
312 Sue. Claud. 22; Huzar (1984) 648-9. Tac. Ann. 11.14 also mentions that Claudius proposed the 
establishment of a Board of Soothsayers to the senate, following ancient Etruscan traditions. 
313 See, for example, Sue. Claud. 2.1, 3.1, 31. 
314 Sue. Claud. 25.2. 
315 Plin. HN 29.5. 
precibusque eius dandum, ut omni tributo vacui in posterum Coi sacram et tantum 
dei ministram insulam colerent. neque dubium habetur multa eorundem in populum 
Romanum merita sociasque victorias potuisse tradi: set Claudius facilitate solita 
quod uni concesserat nullis extrinsecus adiumentis velavit.316  
It was Xenophons influence with Claudius which caused him to bestow this right 
upon Cos and it was his close connections with the cult of Asclepius, as physician 
and priest, which encouraged Claudius to recognise the importance of the cult of 
Asclepius here, the benefits of which he had personally reaped through Xenophon. 
Xenophon would have probably generally acted as an intermediary between the 
Coans and Claudius; if the Coans had a problem, they would approach Xenophon to 
petition the emperor.317 The personal nature of the physicians relationship with the 
monarch must have made him an ideal messenger and advisor. If the emperor could 
trust him with his body and life then he could trust him with his political affairs.318 
Benario has argued that there is a dichotomy to Tacitus representation of Claudius 
in Books eleven and twelve of the Annals. The emperor is presented on the one hand 
as a fool who is not suited for his position and is controlled by his wife and advisors 
as a result. If viewed in this light, Claudius grants to Cos could have been part of a 
grander theme of important people at court taking advantage of a weak emperor. 
Nevertheless, Tacitus also shows that Claudius was more than this and was a first-
316 Tac. Ann. 12.61; Benario (1983) 213: Then he proposed to give freedom from taxation to the 
Coans and he spoke of their great antiquity: The Argives or Coeus, the father of Latona, were the 
most ancient inhabitants of the island. Soon with the arrival of Asclepius, the medical arts were 
introduced and performed with much fame by his descendants. Calling them all by name and with age 
when they flourished. Then he also said that as Xenophon, whose skills he himself had utilised, came 
from the same family, he ought to grant this request, that from now on the Coans would live free from 
all tribute on their sacred island, which would allow them to care for their god. Without doubt, the 
many kindnesses they did for the population of Rome and joint victories could have been recounted. 
But Claudius, with accustomed readiness, did not cover up by means of external aids, a grant which 
he made for an individual. Koestermann (1967) 215 states that, as a senator, Tacitus was offended 
that personal affairs such as this Coan one, would have been given so much attention in the senate.  
317 Buraselis (2004) 141. 
318 Though this was not always the case as, in fact, Tac. Ann. 12.67 accuses Xenophon of conspiring 
with Agrippina in order to poison Claudius. While it is not certain that Xenophon had played any part 
in this affair, the physician was the easiest person to blame in such cases. 
class administrator.319 For a sickly man, Asclepius was the most natural god to 
worship so the benefits of honouring the god would probably have seemed clear to 
Claudius. It would have been Xenophons influence which drew Claudius attention 
to Cos particularly. Claudius closeness with Xenophon is shown in three letters 
which the emperor wrote to Cos. These letters were concerned solely with Coan 
internal affairs and Claudius calls Xenophon his doctor and friend, a man of endless 
piety in the first letter and also states that Xenophon saved him.320 Cos and the Coan 
Asclepieion then slowly regained the rights they had lost at the end of the Republic 
through imperial grants, which were connected to the Coan cult of Asclepius. It was 
Xenophons influence with Claudius that caused him to grant immunitas to the 
island, an honour which Cos had sought for a long time. As a Coan physician, 
Xenophon was strongly linked to the cult here. It was because of these connections 
that Xenophon was able to gain his position at court, which in turn allowed him to 
wield influence on Claudius which, then, furthered both Cos and the Asclepieion.  
3.1.3 Claudius Death 
After Claudius death, Xenophon returned to Cos and assumed several local 
priesthoods. The events surrounding Claudius death are unclear and ambiguous. He 
died quite suddenly and under suspicious circumstances, leading most ancient 
authors to argue that he was murdered by Agrippina so that her son Nero might 
become emperor.321 The emperors death was announced on 13th October AD 54 and 
was claimed to be the result of an illness, as it had been an unhealthy year with

plague occurring in the city.322 However, later historians claimed that the emperor 
had been poisoned with mushrooms. Poisoning was always a danger in the imperial 
court, as is attested by epitaphs of imperial food-tasters.323 However, in Tacitus 
version of Claudius death, Xenophon is said to have played an active role in the 
emperors death by poisoning him for a second time with a feather after Agrippina 
had poisoned him the first time with mushrooms.324 The sources are quite clear that 
poison was thought to be the cause for Claudius death.325 However, it is not clear if 
this was an accidental ingestion, something which might occur, or if the mushroom 
was deliberately given to the emperor. If the latter case was so then Xenophon could 
have played an active part in the emperors death and would have been Agrippinas 
accomplice as Barrett believes, following Tacitus.326 Dios version of Claudius 
death had Agrippina feed Claudius poisonous mushrooms while eating good ones 
herself.327 Mushrooms were considered a delicacy by the Romans but they were also 
aware that eating these fungi could be very dangerous.328 Pliny reports that entire 
households could die from accidentally ingesting the wrong mushroom.329 These 
deaths could only be connected with the mushrooms because the people became very 
sick soon after eating the fungi. The ancient sources concerning Claudius death 
relate that the whole process was drawn-out and that while he did not take a long 
time to die, it was not immediate either.

After Claudius death, Xenophon returned to Cos where he dedicated a 
second temple to Asclepius in the Asclepieion and made other improvements to the 
sanctuary such as installing a piped water course for the wells located in the lower 
levels of the Asclepieion and he also built a library.330 Xenophon is also depicted on 
a coin-type (Fig. 15) struck by the Coan mint with Hygeia on the reverse and another 
one with Asclepius snake-staff, clearly indicating deep connections between the 
physician and the cult on Cos:331  
Fig. 15: BMC (Caria) 18.215.211 and 214. 
These coins are also remarkable as the only other individual, other than the Roman 
emperors, to appear on the obverse on Coan coins was a Nikias who ruled Cos 
during the late Republic, making Xenophons appearance on these coins even more 
striking.332

332 Nikias was a well-known grammaticus in Rome where he had arrived around 60 BC. He was 
friends with, amongst others, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Dolabella and gained his Roman 
citizenship at some point between 48 and 44 BC from Caesar through the agency of Curtius 
Postumus. Nikias was a client and friend of Dolabella and it was in this capacity that he returned to 
Cos. He ruled the island for about eight years, probably with Antonius approval and Hghammer 
(1993) 31 believes that he must have died before Actium, after which his grave was desecrated.  
Buraselis has argued that in his dedications Xenophon emphasised his Coan 
associations while downplaying his Roman connections as a result of his 
involvement in Claudius death: 
In both texts [PH 92 and BMusImp 3 (1932) 22.19, see below], Xenophon has 
silenced his Roman career. In the shorter self-presentation he is simply the 
benefactor of his home city and priest of Asklepios Caesar Agathos Theos. In the 
longer one a closely similar priesthood and his quality as euergetes appear again 
respectively as the introduction and the end of a larger group of titles [...].333  
However, it will be shown here that Xenophon did not downplay his Roman past at 
all but that he constantly displayed it as an indicator of continued influence at the 
imperial court. Other interpretations have also been given to Xenophons titulature, 
with Sherwin-White stating that his titles reflect the dynastic character of his position 
as most of these epithets were given to the rulers of client kingdoms. She concludes 
that their use indicates that Xenophon was virtually a king of Cos.334 Combinations 
of imperial titles, as are listed in BMusImp 3 (1932) 22.19, elsewhere tend to be 
attested for client kingdoms and kings and this combined with Xenophons wealth 
and influence in Rome would lend him a status similar to that of a client king of 
Rome.335 Sherwin-White notes that other important members of the Coan elites had 
acquired the title philokaisar but that no other individual had received the group of 
titles which Xenophon had, which all indicated his close connection with the 
imperial household and indicate the regard in which Xenophon was held in Cos.336 
Sherwin-White makes another interesting point which fits in with the themes 
discussed here of relations with Rome and the representation thereof. She mentions 
333 Buraselis (2000) 94.

that medicus was the title given in Rome for imperial physicians and the title iatros 
was not used for people fulfilling this role. Xenophon was called medicus Augusti in 
Rome.337 However, in a Greek dedication set up for Xenophon from the deme in 
Calymna, presumably erected during Claudius lifetime, he is called archiatros.338 
Another decree dated to Neros reign calls Xenophon archiatros, a title used by the 
physicians of Hellenistic kings.339 The earliest occurrence of this title comes from 
Ptolemaic Egypt.340 This title then could have been used by the Coans to signal 
Xenophons priviledged position as an private physician to Claudius.341 This too 
shows the interplay between Roman and Greek perceptions of Xenophons position. 
The title only appears twice in Coan inscriptions honouring Xenophon and his 
family.342 On one of these, philoneron is inscribed over an erased philoclaudius 
signalling that the latter title may have first been granted to Xenophon in Claudius 
reign but the emperor died before the inscription was completed, making the 
inscriber alter the inscription half way through.343 This would be even more 
interesting than if the title was first given under Claudius, as Xenophon was no 
longer an imperial physician during Neros reign and the new use of this title then 
would be a way in which to stress his Roman connections, a theme which will be 
explored further in this section. The use of this title soon became popular and was

commonly found on inscriptions at the end of the second century.344 The title was 
also used to signal civic physicians.345  
The following inscriptions will be examined in a roughly chronological 
order, starting from a letter written by Claudius while Xenophon was still at court 
and then inscriptions erected by Xenophon after Claudius death, during the reign of 
Nero, when he had returned to Cos. By examining the inscriptions in this order, this 
will show the shifts in the representations of the relationship between Rome, the 
emperor, Cos, and Xenophon.  
Emperors did not always directly interfere with provincial affairs and left 
most of the daily decisions to the governors, if for no other reason than the purely 
practical one that depending on where a city was located in the empire, the journey 
to Rome could be thousands of miles away and could take weeks or even months.346 
However, emperors could act if they so wished and when matters were brought to 
their attention. This usually needed an intermediary, someone close to the emperor, a 
role which Xenophon obviously fulfilled for Cos. Claudius was also aware of the 
benefits of ensuring the loyalty of his servants and provincials and in a letter written 
by Claudius (Fig. 16), Xenophon is hailed as his physician and friend:347  
344 Nutton (1977) 196. 
345 Nutton (1977) 198. Nutton lists a total of ninety-nine inscriptions in which the physician was 
called archiatros. Most of these are for civic and not regal physicians, namely eighty-eight to eleven.

commonplace in antiquity. He states that travel and especially travel to Rome was a fundamental 
feature of ancient society.

the third of a series of three inscribed together on the back of a stele of white marble currently held in 
the Ephorie Inv. E376. The stone is badly damaged, affecting mainly the first and third letters. 
It is clear that Xenophon had some degree of influence with the emperor which he 
then used to bring Coan matters to his attention as Xenophon would still have been 
in Rome at Claudius court when this letter was sent. The letter mentions stasis 
which was taking place in Cos at that time. Bosnakis and Hallof mention that this 
was a disagreement within the city itself which jeopardises the peace of the city 
which is why they called upon Xenophons philopatria, which resulted in an 
imperial intervention. The forms which this took and also the nature of the stasis 
remain unclear, though it may have had economic motivations.348 A parallel for this 
is an inscription which was found in the sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samothrace 
even though it concerns purely Maroneian local affairs and there is no indication that 
this inscription was meant to be read by foreigners at all.349 The document is

concerned with a successful embassy to Claudius in which the Maroneians sought to 
regain rights which they had lost before.350 The document tells us that the city of 
Maroneia was completely destroyed, probably as a result of its allegiance to Rome 
during the Mithridatic Wars. This inscription refers to purely Maroneian affairs and 
the relations between Rome and Maroneia. The emperor here is addressed in order to 
regain lost rights and there was also some form of crisis in the past. Thus, it offers a 
useful parallel for the Coan inscription as it is concerned with similar matters: 
internal affairs and some kind of strife. A second inscription from Maroneia takes 
great care to outline to the ambassadors how they should behave in the emperors 
presence.351 The second part of the first decree is concerned with sending an 
embassy off to Rome as quickly as possible without spending too much time having 
to debate in the boule who to send and having them approved.352  
The Coans utilised Xenophons position in the imperial court to bring purely 
local Coan problems to the attention of the emperor. His close position was also used 
to bring Coan matters to the emperors attention as quickly as possible. With him 
there, there was no need to go through the time-consuming process of appointing 
ambassadors, which the Maroneians also sought to curtail. Xenophon is also called 
philopatris here, a quality which the emperor seemed to think important to stress as 
it bridged the distance between imperial centre and periphery.353 The emperor 
utilised the term to indicate Xenophons patria, by which he means Cos. In 
Xenophons dedications, erected when he was back in Cos, Xenophon is also called 
philopatris.354 However, it seems that he meant it to indicate his loyalty and love for 
Rome, whereas it is possible that when Claudius utilised the term in his letter to the

Coans, he used it to mean Xenophons love and loyalty for Cos. Xenophons actions 
brought about the greatest improvement in both the standing of Cos and the 
Asclepieion, and the grant of immunitas must have been vital for his being able to 
represent himself in this fashion. 
Xenophon is hailed as philoromaios, philoneron, philokaisar, and 
philosebastos in an inscription from Cos dated to the reign of Nero, all of which 
emphasise his service to the emperor:355

The use of these precise titles is very interesting and actually draws attention to 
Xenophons Roman connections. However, Buraselis has argued that Xenophon 
actually downplayed mentions of his Roman career (see above).357 It will be shown 
here that this was not the case and that he actually actively referred to it and brought 
it to the forefront. The use of all four titles together is quite rare (See Table 3): 
355 For another example see I.Cos EV 241 etc.

Unsurprisingly, from the data from the PHI database in Table 3, the more generic 
titles are the most common ones in the Empire, whereas philoneron only occurs five 
times.358 In the Coan inscription, philoneron was erased with damnatio memoriae 
performed on Neros name. This signals an awareness of events taking place in 
Rome, although, of course, it is not possible to state when precisely this act was 
undertaken as the inscription itself is dated to the reign of Nero.359 The titles listed in 
the inscription above are most commonly used in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd century 
AD, with no extant inscriptions mentioning these titles from the 4th century AD, 
though there is a re-occurrence of these titles in the 5th century AD.360 Philoneron 
occurs on Cos four times, and once on Calymna. The title philokaisar occurs fifty-
six times on Cos in the reign of Claudius alone. There seems to be a very Coan, 
regional, element to the use of the titles. Another inscription erected by Xenophon 
mentions the fact that he was philoclaudius, showing that the physician was making 
the most of his imperial connections.361 The inscription erected on Calymna also 
contains a variety of titles, namely philokaisar, philoneron, philoclaudius, 
philosebastos, philoromaios, and philopatris:362

Here too attention is drawn to Xenophons Roman past though in a slightly different 
way. No mention is made of the voting tribe to which the physician belonged (see 
below), but more emphasis is placed upon his connections with specific emperors as 
he is called both philoneron and philoclaudius. Nero, being the living emperor, is 
mentioned before Claudius and also, interestingly, no erasure of Neros name took 
place here, unlike at Cos. Xenophon is also again called hero. In fact Xenophons 
titulature here strongly echoes the language used in the Coan inscription. The PHI 
database lists fifty-three occurrences of this philoclaudius, fifty-two of which occur 
Calymnan citizens to swear an oath to abide by the democracy and ancestral institutions of Cos. This 
makes clear that Calymna formed part of the Coan state as the Calymnans have to swear to follow the 
Coan patrioi nomoi: Tit.Calymnii 9; Thompson (1971) 618.  
363 Tit.Calymnii 111. The people of Calymna and / those who settled / and all who had property / 
erected this altar, / praying to the god Apollo / for the health and safety / of the koine of the fatherland 
/ and for each man individually / benefactor Gaius Stertinius / Xenophon, son of Heracleitus, / 
philokaisar, philoneron, / philoclaudius, philosebastos, / philoromaios, philopatris, / son of the 
fatherland, pious man, / hero, benefactor of the fatherland, by agency of the damarchos in office, 
on Cos and only one from Calymna, which is the inscription mentioned above.364 
Many of these are dedications by Xenophon, and philoclaudius occurs within lists of 
other titles, as also occurs here. These inscriptions are dated to the reign of Claudius. 
It is possible, then, that as the dedication to Asclepius was erected during the reign of 
Nero the demos was interested in showing Xenophons continuing connections with 
the imperial court and emperor rather than showing his past relationship with 
Claudius. In other words, it was desirable for Xenophon to be presented as having 
continued imperial influence, which was the basis of Xenophons power on Cos and 
the reason for his being granted many honours and priesthoods.  
Philokaisar and philosebastos were common titles, with philokaisar being a 
very early use of such a title which indicated people who were in some way 
connected to the emperor. Buraselis argued that this title signalled devotion to the 
emperor as a person and less to the emperor as an institution as people who gained 
this title early on seemed generally to play a part in the cult of the emperor.365 Kaisar 
was the standard Greek way of referring to an emperor, whereas Sebastos was more 
commonly used to indicate the founder of the principate, namely Augustus or the 
emperor as a living institution.366 He also notes that philosebastos was more 
commonly used by larger bodies, such as the demos, rather than an individual.367 Its 
usage here by Xenophon is, thus, noteworthy though not exceptional. It does seem 
that Xenophon was covering all of his bases and was expressing his devotion to and 
connections with the imperial court and emperor in all the forms available to him. A 
further point of note is that philoromaios is placed before philopatria, showing that 
loyalty to Rome is placed before loyalty to the fatherland. The dedication was set up

by the Calymnians who wanted to stress Xenophons Coan background which is 
why they used philopatria. Of all of the above, this was the most common epithet 
and was used in a variety of ways. Here it is especially remarkable as generally this 
title was placed first in inscriptions, above those indicating loyalty to ones family. 
However here it occurs last and Xenophon has already stated that he was 
philoromaios so its use here could once again show that Xenophon wished to add as 
many epithets as possible and stress above all his connections with Rome. It is 
possible that the Calymnians sought to stress Xenophons Roman connections over 
his Coan ones as they were the source of his power and prestige in Cos. A balance 
had to be found in this inscription between Xenophons Roman and Coan identities. 
In this way it fits in with the other titles used here, as they all sought to emphasize 
Xenophons Roman connections and past but did not seek to downplay these 
associations at all, yet they also did not downplay his Coan links. 
Xenophon drew further attention to his Roman past and also his present 
connections by including <> in the dedication. As he was on Cos, there 
was no reason for him to draw attention to the fact that he was a member of a Roman 
voting-tribe, other than to emphasize and remind people of his Roman citizenship. 
Roman voting-tribes are mentioned in seven inscriptions on Cos, including the one 
mentioned above. Six of these were written in Greek and one in Latin. The Latin 
inscription mentions the Esquiline tribe, whereas the Greek inscriptions refer to the 
Palatina (two), Fabia, Falerna, and Quirina tribes. These inscriptions are generally 
dated to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.368 One inscription is noteworthy as it was 
erected by Claudia Phoebe, Tiberius Claudius Cleonymus wife, who was 
368 Latin: I.Cos EV 276 (1st century AD). Greek: I.Cos EV 233 (1st century AD), I.Cos EV 219 
(Claudian), I.Cos EV 147 (2nd century AD), I.Cos (Fun.) EF 53 (1st century BC).

belonged, namely the Quirina (see Fig. 17):

Germania, having been monarchos twice and ambassador often on behalf of the fatherland to the 
emperors, Claudia Phoebe set up this, her husband, benefactor of the fatherland on account of arte

version of the text as it should be  and not , as is clearly legible on the stone (line 
5). A monarchos was a type of Coan magistrate: SIG 1012.13. I.Cos EV 233 re-edited the inscription 
to connect  with the tribunate rather than with his monarchia as Paton and Hicks had preferred 
before. This was based upon Segres inspection of the stone. However, Buraselis too examined the 
inscription and found the dash in question to be of a decorative nature. He, therefore, argued that 
Cleonymus was not tribune twice, which would have been slightly odd, but had been a monarchos 
twice instead: Buraselis (2000) 75n45. 
embassies on behalf of the Coans.  The Coans, then, were keen to exploit the 
intimate relationship between Xenophon and Cos, and sending Xenophons brother 
would be an easy way to ensure that their concerns would be put to the emperor.370 
By referring to Cleonymus brother Xenophon, Claudia Phoebe probably refers to 
the source of his status, namely his more famous brother and, by mentioning his 
Roman tribe here, Claudia did the same as Xenophon in the previous inscription and 
explicitly mentioned the Roman connections which were the source of Cleonymus 
prestige and power in Cos. Thus, contrary to Buraselis argument, Xenophons 
Roman career was not silenced at all but equal importance was given to his Roman 
past and his Coan connections. 
3.1.5 Xenophon and the Roman Court 
The inscriptions analysed here and the titles utilised in them illustrate the 
close relationship between emperor and members of his court. The Roman court was 
undefined in its nature and membership was determined by close relationships with 
the emperor and not socio-economic factors or birth.371 The primary function of the 
court was to provide access to the emperor and it was this contact which formed the 
basis for a courtiers power. An ancient court can be visualised as a series of 
concentric circles with an individuals power lessening the further he moved away 
from the emperor.372 Cut off from the emperor, the courtier was powerless and 
without standing in society.373 As a result, the bestowal or withholding of favours 
370 Syll.3 805; Millar (1992) 86. 
371 Wallace-Hadrill (1996) 285. 
372 Levick (1993) 53. 
373 See the Apelles incident in the court of Philip V of Macedon: Polyb. 4.76ff; Wallace-Hadrill 
(1996) 288. 
was a way for the emperor to divide and control his upper classes.374 An emperor 
could never completely be assured of the loyalty of his subjects and had only two 
methods of control at his disposal: repression or reward.375 In the case of the Coans, 
Claudius chose reward and this is probably why he granted the rights to the 
Asclepieion in AD 54 when Xenophon petitioned him for them. By granting favours 
to Cos, Claudius increased Xenophons prestige in his home town and hoped to be 
assured of his physicians loyalty. Gift giving was a normal way of stimulating 
loyalty by emperors as it was a way of creating obligations on the recipients part.376 
Roman courts were influenced by the Hellenistic ones but there were also significant 
differences in both and it was imperial favour that was key in a courtiers position at 
court.377 This is perhaps why Xenophon, and also Cleonymus, put such emphasis on 
their Roman connections. Xenophon was no longer at court and did not have access 
to either the living or the dead emperor. As a courtiers power derived from his 
access to the emperor and the favours the ruler could bestow upon him, when 
separated from the emperor, the courtier was without power. Xenophon was no 
longer at court so he did not have access to imperial power any more. The inscription 
from Calymna shows that Xenophon was perceived to be close to both Claudius and 
Nero even though he departed for Cos not long into Neros reign. The fact that the 
title philoneron is also used on the Coan inscription and that he placed such 
emphasis on his Roman titles and his closeness with the imperial household both 
past and present, show that Xenophon was trying to preserve the illusion of the 
continuity of this privileged position so that he would not lose any power in Cos 
itself.

To prevent the Coans from ever forgetting his actions and the benefit they 
brought to Cos, Xenophon dedicated a monument to Asclepius Kaisar Agathos 
Theos which identifies Asclepius with the emperor:378

Paton and Hicks argue that it was likely Xenophons own initiative to identify the 
emperor with Asclepius.380 The emperor is connected here with local traditions as 
Agathos Theos seems to have been a very popular deity on the island and Asclepius 
was the patron deity of Cos.381 The emperor had, of course, patronised the 
Asclepieion but this dedication could be read as another way of promoting 
Xenophons closeness with the emperor. This indicates that for Xenophon, there was 
a direct link between Asclepius, himself, and the emperor. Another inscription, dated 
to the 1st century AD, illustrates continued connections between the emperor and 
Asclepius:

It was through the prompting of Xenophon, connected by his birth and profession to 
Asclepius, that the Coan sanctuary gained honours and increased its standing in the 
network of Asclepieia. After Claudius grant, Asclepius was associated with the 
emperor through titulature which indicates his enhanced status after Claudius grant. 
This is also reflected in the title of Asclepius festival on Cos: in the Hellenistic 
period this festival was called the Asklapieia megala but by Claudius reign this had 
been changed to sebasta Asklapieia megala.383 The former title, which would have 
taken place every five years, is attested in victory lists, asylia decrees and also 
foreign decrees mentioning the festival.384 The establishment of this festival formed 
part of the Coans desire to gain the right of asylia for their sanctuary. The festival 
was recognised as Panhellenic in 242 BC and there are about fifty recognitions of 
this right from various kings and poleis which were erected in the sanctuary.385 Coan 
theoroi were sent out every four years to announce the coming festival at the 
Hellenistic courts, whose kings would then send their own ambassadors in turn to 
attend.386 The additional title sebasta, which was commonly given to festivals in the 
imperial period, is attested in a decree erected on Cos probably shortly after 
Bassus, son of Lucius, of the deme of Lerianus, son of the fatherland, philokaisar, priest of Asclepius 
Kaisar, Lucius Cossinius Gnorimos, philokaisar, erected this out of the memory of her raising him 
and thanks for her.   is an honorific title.

Claudius death.387 The decree is an honorific decree set up by the demos of Cos for 
Lucius Nonius Aristocles, son of Aristocles, member of the Cornelian voting-tribe, 
and he is also called philokaisar.388 Nonius participated in numerous embassies to 
Cos during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius, and Maiuri argues that he also 
participated in those embassies seeking the affirmation of the right of asylia and the 
embassy seeking to gain the right of immunitas for Cos. He also states that Nonius 
probably accompanied Cleonymus on the other embassies. He would, thus, have 
been familiar with both brothers and also the emperor himself.389  It is the timing of 
when this title was added to the festival which is interesting as it signals that there 
might have been a connection between the cult of the emperor, namely Claudius, and 
Asclepius.390 
3.1.6 Conclusion 
Without Xenophons services to him, Claudius may not have been so willing 
to grant immunitas to Cos or to order the Coans to dedicate themselves to the service 
of Asclepius. Claudius was also the source of Xenophons power and position, both 
in Cos and Rome, and the physician carefully referred to his past imperial 
connections by constantly referring to both the emperor and also other Roman 
elements such as his voting tribe. Through his agency, the cult of Asclepius and the 
emperor became more and more entwined as with Asclepius panhellenic festival the 
Sebasta Megala Asklepieia. Patronage of Asclepius could be seen as a bridge in the 
relationship between emperor and courtier. Asclepius was used as a vehicle for the

articulation of imperial favour and was suited for this purpose both by his role as 
patron god of the island and also as Claudius had granted special honours to this god. 
Thus, political changes at Rome, specifically the development of the imperial court 
under Claudius and his succession to the imperial throne, had lasting effects upon 
Cos and the Coan Asclepieion and resulted in direct Roman interference in Coan 
affairs and those of the Asclepieion. However, this was not a mono-directional 
change in affairs; it has also been shown here how local elites in Cos responded to 
Rome in their cultic interventions. Local responses to Rome within cults of 
Asclepius will be examined further in the next section, which looks at Hadrianic and 
Caracallan Asclepieian sacred travel. 
3.2 The Impact of Imperial Sacred Travel on the Cult of Asclepius 
3.2.1 Introduction 
While Claudius never visited the Coan Asclepieion in person, he did have a 
definite impact on the cult of Asclepius there. However, travel played an important 
role in imperial patronage of the god as Xenophon originally travelled to Rome as 
part of an embassy to petition Tiberius, which put him in a position to increase his 
reputation in Rome and gain his place at Claudius court. In this section, the impact 
of imperial sacred travel on the cult will be examined. An imperial visit to a 
sanctuary would have boosted the standing and economy of a city or sanctuary and 
Hadrian and Caracalla are known to have toured extensively through their empires. It 
was precisely these emperors who had lasting effects on the cult of Asclepius, 
especially in the Panhellenic sanctuaries of Epidaurus and Pergamum, although not 
directly on any of the Italic ones. There is no iconography relating to the Tiber Island 
sanctuary found on their coinage; this is in contrast to Pergamene iconography, 
which this chapter will show to have been prevalent not just on provincial Caracallan 
coinage but also to have occurred in Rome itself.391 This section will first explore 
sacred travel in general, after which Hadrianic impact on Asclepius will be 
examined. Lastly, Caracallas interactions with the cult will be researched. With both 
of these emperors, their greatest direct impact was on the Pergamene cult, but 
Hadrian also visited Epidaurus and revived ancient rites there. The provincial 
response to these dedications, of equal importance in terms of impact, will also be 
explored here. Caracallas visit to Pergamum had lasting effects on other cults of 
Asclepius in Asia Minor with other cities following the Pergamene example and 
breathing new life into cults of Asclepius in order to honour both the emperor and a 
god he favoured.  
3.2.2 Sacred Travel 
Festivals were one of the main reasons for sacred travel in antiquity but there 
were many other motives why an individual could choose to travel, for example to 
consult an oracle, to participate in a mystery cult or in order to seek healing.392 
Medical sacred travel was especially well attested from the 4th century BC onwards 
and particularly during the Hellenistic period.393 In Greek there were two terms used 
to describe sacred travellers: theoros and hikestes with the latter being the scarcer 
391 Antoninus Pius did issue a medallion showing Asclepius arrival in Rome: Gnecchi (1912) Vol. 2,

term.394 The term theoros is not used in the context of a healing sanctuary. The term 
used in this context to indicate a supplicant was hiketes, signalling an awareness that 
healing travel differed from sacred travel to other sanctuaries.395 Ancient sacred 
journeys emphasised ritual travel to sacred centres often far away from where the 
supplicant lived.396 This travel and the act of supplicating a god created social 
cohesion; the worshippers at a sanctuary formed a sacrificial group with shared 
experiences and goals.397 Supplicants were mainly motivated by individual concerns, 
which is part of the reason why sacred travel was so predominant in the cult of 
Asclepius, as he was known to be a deity particularly interested in healing and 
helping individuals. However, the most conspicuous form of ancient sacred travel 
were the sacred embassies, theoria, where cities would send out ambassadors to 
other poleis in order to announce an upcoming festival. These cities generally would 
send their own ambassadors to attend these rites in their name.398 A number of letters 
collected by Rigsby show how theoria also occurred in the cult of Asclepius, for 
example at Cos, where the sanctuary had been granted the right of asylia in 242 BC. 
These letters attest that Coan ambassadors were sent to various poleis and Hellenistic 
courts in order to invite them to attend the quadrennial festival of Asclepius in Cos 
and also to acknowledge and guarantee the right of asylia.399 Other sanctuaries also 
sent out similar embassies, inviting cities to send their own ambassadors to attend 
the various Asclepiadic festivals.

In the ancient world there was no clear demarcation between the sacred and 
secular, and sacred activities pervaded daily life in many ways.400 Greek does 
nevertheless have two distinctive terms separating the two, namely sacred, hieros, 
and profane, hosia.401 This distinction in terminology is reflected by the physical 
layout of a sanctuary as the temple and altar were often situated within a temenos 
whereas stadia and theatres could be situated outside the demarcated sacred area.402 
Despite these demarcations, any trip could turn into a sacred journey at any point 
simply by the supplication of a deity. Connor argues that the terms hieros and hosia 
do not relate precisely to our modern terms of sacred and profane but actually 
express the relationship between the two which is parallel to and co-ordinated with 
each other; sacred and secular go hand-in-hand.403 However, sacred travel for the 
purpose of healing seems distinct from this. Any journey could transform into sacred 
travel but a certain level of predetermination can be presumed for those travelling for 
the purpose of healing. Epigraphic evidence such as the Epidaurian Iamata (see 
below) indicate that people set out with the intention of being healed, and that this 
was not a secondary purpose of their voyage or even something which they had 
decided while travelling.404 Supplications were more commonly made for current 
illnesses rather than future illness, though this did also occur. In this way sacred 
travel in the cult of Asclepius differs from other kinds of sacred travel. 
For the Greeks it was possible to acknowledge the pre-eminence of a 
panhellenic healing cult while not feeling that their local shrine was lesser in terms 
of healing.405 A later 4th-century AD source articulated this:

If we had bodily ailments and needed the help of the god [Asclepius], and he were 
present here in his temple on the acropolis and revealed himself to the sick, as they 
say he does, would we have to go to Tricca or sail to Epidaurus because of its ancient 
renown, or could we be relieved of our ailment merely by taking a short walk [to 
your acropolis]?406 
Epigraphic evidence, in the form of many dedications found in virtually all of 
the Asclepieia, indicates that a need for sacred healing travel was still felt in Roman 
times and remained popular and Roman patterns of this travel were based upon the 
Greek and Hellenistic ones.407 The creation of the Roman Empire facilitated travel in 
part due to the new infrastructure but also as a result of the pax romana and the 
systematic removal of pirates and brigands.408 Travel and communication were very 
important for the governing of the Roman army, whose vast geographical diffusion 
and cultural diversity demanded that an efficient infrastructure be in place for this.409  
Many towns had local Asclepieia but the Panhellenic sanctuaries of Cos, 
Pergamum, and Epidaurus were also very popular with Greeks and Romans. 
Previous scholars have argued that supplicants chose to travel to a specific sanctuary 
on account of specialised healing which took place there.410 In Athens, a great many 
eye ex-votos were found, which was used to corroborate this claim. Evidence from 
Corinth was also used to support this, as many arms and hands were found there. The 
largest caches of votive deposits were excavated at these two sanctuaries and they

who had been educated in traditional Hellenistic paideia yet he still gained imperial favour 
following a speech given to Constantine in AD 350. The emperor first gave Themistius an official 
teaching post in Constantinople and then a place in the Senate in AD 355. Themistius remained in 
favour with the emperor up to his death and was also patronised by the emperors Jovian, Valens, and 
Theodosius: Heather and Moncur (2001) ix. The oration sees Themistius addressing a young man, 
using both religious and literary examples to illustrate that he should honour local places and objects 
as well as those from other places as they are not any lesser for being close to home. Eloquence was 
honoured everywhere (335) and the young man should apply this principle to all things.

provided the greatest number of ex-votos in the Greek world. However, later 
excavations at Corinth also found body parts of every description, indicating that 
there was no specialisation here.411 The ex-votos from Fregellae were also very 
diverse (see Chapter 2), showing that there is no reason to suspect specialisation in 
the Italian healing sanctuaries either. The Epidaurian Iamata list a wide variety of 
cures and healings, both medical and miraculous.412 Further claims were made that 
there was a difference in the cures effected in Epidaurus and those in Cos and 
Pergamum, the former being more divine and supernatural and the latter being more 
medical.413 However, this was probably not the case. The basis for the claim that the 
Coan Asclepieion had more medical grounding than the other shrines was based 
upon the excavation of medical instruments at this site. However, the find-spots have 
never been recorded for these and the equipment could have been found 
elsewhere.414 Supernatural cures were also found at other sanctuaries, among them 
Rome, so this division between medical and divine need not be the reason behind the 
choice of sanctuary.415 If there was no specialisation, then this would mean that 
people could seek healing at their local shrine but also if they felt that the need 
strongly enough, they could travel to a larger sanctuary.416 It was the supplicants 
own choice then, no doubt influenced by wealth and ability to travel, which 
determined the selection of sanctuary.417 Sacred travel was distinct from travel for 
economic purposes, as there is evidence that people did travel considerable distances 
in search of employment.418 Travel for the purpose of gathering knowledge, which

was an elite habit especially during the so-called Second Sophistic, should also be 
treated as different from sacred travel, though healing supplicatory travel touched 
upon elements which were central to the Second Sophistic, namely broader themes 
of travel, tourism, and supplication, and should not wholly be seen as a fringe 
activity.419 Most ancient Asclepieian testimonies indicate that the supplicants came 
of their own volition but others state that the god ordered them to come to the 
sanctuary, something which is also claimed by Aelius Aristides, who, on one 
occasion states: When the god sent me to the Aesepus [].420 Aristides was, of 
course, a unique supplicant and goes further than most to indicate his personal 
relationship with the god.421 This is also shown by a 2nd-century AD dedicatory 
inscription from Epidaurus in which the dedicant states that: 
I, Marcus Iulius Appeles, from Idrias [a suburb of Mylasa], was summoned by the 
god, for I was often falling into illnesses and suffering from indigestion. During my 
journey by boat he told me, in Aegina, not to be so irritable all the time.422  
The close and individual relationship with the god was, thus, felt by another 
supplicant, dating to roughly the same period, and occurring during the Second 
Sophistic. These sources aptly indicate the individual nature of a supplicants 
relationship with the god, something also likely felt by the emperors.

 Of all the emperors, Hadrian is best known as a travelling emperor. He had 
what could be called a tourists interest in viewing all of the spectacles of his empire. 
This section will first examine Hadrians travels in general, then will look at his visit 
to the Pergamene and the Epidaurian sanctuaries and then the impact his 
benefactions had on the cult there. Special attention will be given to the so-called 
Asclepius Amelung type (see below) which grew in importance in Pergamum and 
was assigned to the new syncretic god Zeus-Asclepius. This became associated with 
Hadrian and the position of emperor. A statue from Eleusis will be discussed lastly, 
before moving on to Caracalla, who became connected with the Amelung statue-type 
and who worshipped extensively at Pergamum.  
Hadrian spent more than half of his reign away from Rome, travelling around 
the provinces.423 Before him, emperors had mainly travelled either with the goal of 
expanding their empire, to keep their existing provinces under control, such as 
Augustus or Trajan. While these reasons also played a part in Hadrians travels, he 
may also have been motivated by hellenophilia and a love of travel.424 Being 
physically present in the provinces and, thus, accessible to provincials was a highly 
successful way of consolidating the empire: travel served as a unifying method.425 
Hadrian wished for the equalisation and unification of all of the provinces.426 This 
unity of empire allowed Hadrian to be in a stronger position to deal with the 
provincials.427 The Historia Augusta and Dio remark that no other emperor travelled 
more than Hadrian did.428 His presence is documented in over thirty provinces and

even in those where it is uncertain that he visited, it is likely that he did actually 
travel there, with the notable exception of Sardinia-Corsica.429 Hadrian travelled 
relatively quickly and managed to visit all of the western parts of his empire in the 
first five years of his reign, during which he visited all of the Northern provinces and 
then went to Spain via Gaul.430 His main interest lay in the east and it was in this 
area that most of Hadrians numerous rebuilding projects took place, something 
which is not explicitly mentioned in any ancient source, which simply state that he 
built in every city and everywhere, giving the impression that vast rebuilding also 
took place in the west.431 The Historia Augusta presents Hadrian as having a great 
disdain for foreign religion and a great love for traditional Roman rites but while the 
emperor used religion as a way to portray himself as a traditional emperor, he was 
also a religious innovator and rebuilder.432 He restored and built numerous temples 
and added many amenities to sanctuaries such as at Tarraco, Athens, Cyzicus, 
Nicomedia, and Antiocheia.433 He also made many dedications and established new 
rites and regulations in many sanctuaries or revived forgotten ancient ones, among 
them Epidaurus.434 On coinage, provincial aspects were stressed which were thought 
Dio came from Nicaea in Bithynia and was probably born sometime around AD 163/4: Millar (1964) 
5, 13. He came to Rome around AD 180, although he was not a member of the senate at that point. He 
received many honours under Pertinax and was appointed to be praetor in the following year. When 
Septimius Severus came to Rome, he wrote a pamphlet containing divine auspices for Severus 
accession and, thus, curried favour with the emperor, holding onto his position: Millar (1964) 14, 16.  
Millar states that Dio started his work shortly after Commodus death and his Roman History took 
him almost thirty years to complete, but Sidebottom (2007) 74 mentions that it was also possible that 
Dio did not start collating his evidence until Septimius Severus death. The Roman History spanned 
the period from the foundation of Rome to the reign of Severus Alexander, at which point Dio died. 
Dio held important positions at court and was an amicus to both Severus, whom he treats with respect, 
and Caracalla, who is treated with open hostility in the History: Millar (1964) 17-18.

to be of the greatest importance to the empire.435 Hadrian acted as a traditional 
emperor in order to secure and legitimise his rule but also made significant religious 
innovations such as the introduction of the cult of Venus and Roma to Rome.436 In 
this instance, Hadrian seemed to wish to create a deity who was universally 
acceptable and could be seen as a unifying force for all the provincials.437 The 
temple was constructed on land which had formerly been part of Neros domus 
aurea, making it very visible and also virtually making it a counterpoint to the 
temple of Jupiter Capitolinus which stood at the other end of the Forum 
Romanum.438 This was the first temple dedicated to Roma in the city of Rome itself 
and can, therefore, be seen as a considerable religious innovation.439 By choosing to 
employ a Greek visual language for the depiction of Roma and also her temple, 
Hadrian was creating a Roman counterpoint to Athena Parthenos in Athens. Both of 
these goddesses were developed as a way of unifying the empire, and allowing them 
to be goddesses for the whole empire.440 It is possible that Hadrian fostered the 
development and creation of the god Zeus-Asclepius in the same way, fashioning a 
universal deity whose worship would be open for and acceptable to all people in the 
provinces (see below). 
Hadrians travels were generally well documented and the seminal modern 
work on imperial travel is Helmut Halfmanns work Itinera Principum in which he 
compiles lists of the places, dates, and available evidence for the travelling 
emperors.441 Cassius Dio and the Historia Augusta both comment upon Hadrians

travels, yet the latter source which is already notably unreliable is especially poor 
when it comes to documenting Hadrians travels from the west to the east. All the 
source says is that Hadrian negotiated with the Parthians on the banks of the 
Euphrates but does not give any indication of how Hadrian reached that area.442 
Birley states that these negotiations were a matter of some urgency, but that this still 
does not mean that a direct route through Syria would have been necessary; the 
emperor could have gone through Africa or Cyrenaica.443 From Cyrene he could 
have gone to Crete and then on to Bithynia, from where he went into Asia, where his 
presence was well-documented in AD 124, from Cyzicus to Ephesus. Polemo, a 
contemporary of Hadrian, states that Hadrian went to Thrace before going into 
Asia.444 He travelled through Asia visiting all of the main cities and giving 
benefactions to these. After spending the summer in Asia, Hadrian travelled from 
Ephesus to Rhodes in September or October 124 and then further to the Greek 
mainland.445 In October he was in Eleusis and then he spent the winter of 124/5 in 
Athens. At some point, possibly at the end of AD 124, although it is not precisely 
clear when, Hadrian travelled through the Peloponnese. He likely visited Megara, 
Corinth, Epidaurus, Troizen, Argolis, Mantineia, and Sparta, although no exact dates 
can be provided.446 The emperor travelled further through Greece, possibly through 
the mainland in the spring of AD 125 before he returned to Rome in the summer,

3.3.1 Hadrian and Pergamum 
Hoffman states that it is likely Hadrian visited Pergamum in AD 123, 
favouring the city and upgrading its status from polis to megalopolis.447 There is no 
definitive evidence that Hadrian actually visited the sanctuary. It is very likely that 
he did so, however, given the antiquity of the polis, the fact that there were plenty of 
religious sites to draw the emperors attention and his presence in the general area.448 
Hadrian was given the title Hadrian Soter Olympios, Epiphanestatos Neos Asklepios 
in Pergamum, which fits in with titulature granted to Hadrian by other cities after an 
imperial visit, as a thanks in return for his benefactions (Fig. 18):

This inscription is quite rare as there is a shift from the dative to the nominative. 
Neos is used to describe the manifestation of Hadrian in the guise of a deity. The 
term is used various times in a Hadrianic context, connecting him with Zeus, 
Dionysus, and Helios.450 The use of the term epiphanestatos makes Hadrians 
presence in Pergamum very likely.451 Epidaurus, which Hadrian visited in the 
autumn of AD 124, also calls the emperor its saviour and benefactor.452  
There was a remodelling of the Pergamene sanctuary in Hadrianic times, 
which was the result of a boom in the cults popularity at that time.453 The rebuilding 
(Fig. 19) was more a redesign of current structures than an enlargement of the 
sanctuary, although a temple to the new god Zeus-Asclepius as well as a 
monumental courtyard, theatre, library, propylon, forecourt, and the rotunda were 
built then in a Roman style.

453 Hoffman (1998) 41: this can be shown by an increase in the number of dedications made at this 
time and the pre-eminence of the Pergamene version of the god Asclepius is also shown by Martial 
9.16.2 who calls him Pergameus deus.  
Fig. 19: Plan of the Pergamene Asclepieion, 2nd century AD. 
The rebuilding programme amalgamated the cultural and architectural traditions of 
the Hellenistic and Roman age, preserving a feeling of continuity but also updating 
the sanctuary as a whole.454 Hoffman suggested that the plans for this rebuilding had 
perhaps first been made at the end of the 1st century AD, following a boom in the 
popularity of the Asclepieion from Domitianic times onwards.455 It has been pointed 
out that Antoninus Pius followed the example of Hadrian in his benefactions and that 
both emperors were responding to the pre-eminence of Asclepius during the Roman

known to have been an adherent of Asclepius. He dedicated a lock of hair to the god and may have

era.456 From the end of the 1st century onwards there was also an increase in the 
number of dedications to Asclepius on site.457  
The inclusion of the new secular buildings, such as the theatre and library, 
meant that the Pergamene Asclepieion became a centre of learning along the lines of 
Hadrians library in Athens. There are further architectural connections with Rome 
in the courtyard, which shared the design of its exedrae with the colonnades in the 
Forum Transitorium.458 The cult of Zeus-Asclepius seems to have been an elite 
invention, on account of Aelius Aristides Sacred Tales and also an inscription, the 
expense of which suggests that it may have been set up by those of greater socio-
economic status.459 Only two dedications to Zeus-Asclepius are known, with the rest 
all being dedicated to Asclepius Soter, which could indicate that the cult did not 
achieve popularity among the worshippers of Asclepius at Pergamum.460

Fig. 20: Nude Statue of Hadrian. 
This statue was linked to emperor worship here on account of the divine nudity and 
inscription to theos Hadrianos.461 The Pergamanes had petitioned Hadrian to set up a 
new cult to the emperor which was dedicated to him but he declined and only 
allowed them to erect a statue of himself in Trajans temple.462 Hadrians response to 
this petition is set out in a letter from him to the Pergamenes which Helmut Mller 
has reconstructed from twenty-seven fragments found around the temple of Trajan 
and Zeus Philios on the Acropolis, dating the letter to after AD 135 and likely to the 
beginning of AD 136.463 Hadrian praises the Pergamenes in his letter but states that 
the temples already in situ meet Pergamene needs and, therefore, he consents instead 
to the placement of his statue in the temple of his adoptive father Trajan.464

Theos in numerous other inscriptions from around the empire, for example see ILS 2.28802a. Hallett 
(2005) 237 argues that nudity does not have divine connotations by itself as deified emperors are 
mostly depicted togate. Here, the combination of the nudity and the inscription which refers to theos 
Hadrianos should be taken as an indication of divinity, although the military attributes also indicate 
the emperors military and political prowess: Petsalis-Diomidis (2010) 213.

It would seem that Hadrian had a definite impact upon the Pergamene 
sanctuary and this is best articulated in the creation of a new god here, the syncretic 
universal deity Zeus-Asclepius to whom a temple was built on site. This new god 
was supposed to be an ideological counterpart to traditional deities such as Asclepius 
Soter. The temple plan was based upon the Pantheon in Rome which had just 
finished being restored by Hadrian.465 As Petsalis-Diomidis explains: 
The internal diameter of the temple of Zeus-Asklepios was just over half the size of 
the Pantheon (24 meters compared to 42 meters). The architectural choice may be 
understood as an articulation of a general Pergamene desire for a close relationship 
with the emperor and Roman metropolis [].466 
As with the pantheon, here there was the innovative combination of cella with a 
pronaos.467 Petsalis-Diomidis points out that while the Pantheon combined 
traditional religious associations with radical aesthetic originality, the traditional 
element was missing from the temple of Zeus-Asclepius in Pergamum as here a cult 
statue of the new syncretic deity Zeus Asclepius was housed.468 As Petsalis-
Diomidis points out, there were many buildings connected to the emperor and 
imperial family in Rome but in Pergamum this was highly unusual. The temple 
should be seen as being explicitly connected to Hadrian and his visit to the city, 
which was reinforced by the presence of Hadrians statue in the library.469 Hoffman 
states, the only conceivable intermediary for this could have been the emperor 
himself as the pantheon was closely linked to the imperial family and because of 
Hadrians visit to Pergamum and the presence of his statue in the library.470 As the 
temple of Zeus-Asclepius was based upon the Pantheon plan, ideological

470 Hoffman (1998) 50; Petsalis-Diomidis (2010) 198. 
connections can be made between the two buildings. The Pantheon was imbued with 
ideals of universality and perfection, and Petsalis-Diomidis has suggested that this 
meant that Zeus-Asclepius here was a syncretic deity in whom the universal god of 
healing and the god of the universe were combined and fused.471 Asclepius would 
have been chosen as he was one of the main gods in Pergamum and was also a god 
who appealed to virtually everyone as a result of the open nature of his worship. 
Asclepius ensured the emperors good health and that of the empire and Zeus was a 
universal god who sanctioned the emperor as ruler of the oikoumene.472 Hadrian was, 
of course, especially connected with Olympian Zeus in Athens but also elsewhere as 
the above inscription, IvP 2.365, shows.473 Patron deities belonged to a polis and as a 
result they were both local and universal; Zeus-Asclepius embodied this ideal in 
more ways than a regular polis deity.474 This idea of universality in the cult of Zeus-
Asclepius is also found in Aelius Aristides orations where he states that the temple 
here had many cult-statues, which was befitting of it as a mini-Pantheon: 
[]  <>      ,   ,   
   <>    []475  
In another oration he describes the god as the supreme deity of the universe, as Zeus 
was, and also connects the two gods through a mythical genealogy.476 This 
universality comes forth again in the fourth Sacred Tale where Aristides does not 
identify the god by name but connects him to the soul of the universe/

.477 The introduction of this new universal syncretic deity had lasting effects 
on the cult, and his presence in Pergamum and also in the empire was furthered by 
Caracalla (see below). In fact: 
The cosmic universalism and epiphanic transformation articulated in the 
architectural design of the temple can be connected with the encyclopaedic, all-
inclusive aspect of the Asklepieion as it collected, reordered, and transformed the 
whole range of pilgrim bodies.478 
Asclepius, here, had become a universal god who would, in theory, appeal to all. 
This could then fit in with other religious events during the Hadrianic period, where 
there seemed to be a trend towards creating universal deities which would be 
pleasing to all peoples.  
However, the fact that elites introduced a new cult to a site did not always 
mean that an older cult would be supplanted by it. Despite the new cult of Zeus-
Asclepius being established here, the old cult of Asclepius Soter seems to have 
continued to be the more popular cult. A similar event happened within the cult of 
Asclepius in Ptolemaic Egypt, to provide a parallel for his. Asclepius was 
assimilated with the Egyptian god Imhotep.479At Deir el-Bahari, elite priests 
introduced Asclepius to the site and syncretised him with the existing god on site, 
Amenhotep, in order to boost Amenhoteps popularity and standing so that the cult 
would attract more worshippers. Asclepius name does not appear here until the 
reign of Ptolemy VI, where he was presented as Amenhoteps equal in the 
477 Aristid. Or. 50.55-6. 
478 Petsalis-Diomidis (2010) 203. 
479 Asclepius also enjoyed royal patronage in Egypt as the Ptolemies were known adherents of the 
cult. They are depicted on many reliefs, sacrificing to Imhotep-Asclepius and the temple of Imhotep-

Philadelphos: Hurry (1928) 94. 
inscriptions and on reliefs.480 In the same period, in the second half of the 2nd century 
BC, the sanctuary was drastically rebuilt and a new temple was constructed on site 
for the two gods, probably by Ptolemy VIII.481 The rebuilding followed a single plan 
and happened simultaneously. It completely changed the appearance of the 
sanctuary, which fitted with its change in ideology; the temple interior was also 
transformed, with a strict parallelism of scenes of Imhotep and Amenhotep now 
occurring in the cult rooms.482 While the immediate goal of wider worship seems to 
have worked, as an increase in dedicatory graffiti reveals, most of these are 
addressed to both gods together or only Amenhotep but never Asclepius on his 
own.483 The original god seems to have remained the more popular with local 
worshippers and this could have also been the case with the cults of Asclepius at 
Pergamum. Yet, even if the cult of Zeus-Asclepius did not reach the same level of 
popularity as that of Asclepius Soter, his introduction to the site had lasting effects 
on the worshippers experience of being in the sanctuary due to the presence of a 
second temple on site.

482 ajtar (2006) 41. 
483 Around 300 BC the healing deity Amenhotep was introduced into the upper levels of 
Hatshepshuts temple in Deir el-Bahari, although no reference to Asclepius-Imhotep is made in any of 
the inscriptions, which occurred both in Greek and Demotic, during the 3rd century and the first half 
of the 2nd century BC: ajtar (2006) 30. Therefore, it is possible that the god did not enjoy a cult in 
Deir el-Bahari at this time. ajtar (2006) 34 suggests that it was the priests of Amenhotep who were 
behind this revamping of the sanctuary and that they were also responsible for the introduction of 
Asclepius-Imhotep. Amenhotep was not yet worshipped as a full god at that time and, in order to 
strengthen and increase his standing and worship, the priestly elites introduced Asclepius into the cult. 
Asclepius-Imhotep was a fully-fledged member of the Memphite pantheon at this time and was 
worshipped by many people, including mainly local elites: ajtar (2006) 35. Through his association 
with Asclepius, Amenhotep became more widely worshipped. The priests plan to increase worship 
seems to have worked as there was a drastic increase in the number of supplicants inscriptions in the 
late Ptolemaic to early Roman period, suggesting an increase in the cults popularity. The pinnacle of 
cult activity seems to fall in the first two centuries of Roman rule over Egypt. In the second half of the 
2nd century AD the inscriptions rapidly stop, with the last one being dated to AD 162.   
The new god does not appear on any Hadrianic coins and Pergamum does not 
seem to have minted any coins commemorating these events.484 Asclepius does 
appear on some Hadrianic cistophori from the imperial mint, all of which are 
uniform in appearance.485 These coins depict Asclepius in his standardised form. 
Asclepius is only listed on eight Hadrianic coin types in the BMC Greek corpora, 
although before this he rarely occurs on Roman imperial coinage (see Table 4).486 
The majority of Hadrians coinage depicted personifications and virtues on the 
reverse, and only a small percentage showed actual deities.487 Asclepius was rarely 
depicted on the coinage of the western part of the Roman empire but was represented 
in multiple guises on both the coinage and especially statuary in Asia Minor from the 
late Hellenistic period onwards.488 He is mostly depicted in the so-called Este type or 
variations thereof (Fig. 21):489  
484 Metcalf (1980) 11. 
485 See Metcalf (1980) for a full exploration of Hadrianic cistophori. The issue of these coins was 
more an economic measure than a religious one and was not per se intended to promote universal 
deities. 
486 The term Roman Imperial Coins is used to indicate coins as listed in the RIC volumes and which 
were struck in Rome. Provincial Coinage is used as a term to mean coins which were issued in the 
provinces and do not occur in RIC but in other corpora: see Butcher (1988) 11.

and the body leans upon a staff which is placed under the gods armpit. The himation is draped 
diagonally across the torso and crosses the leg in a triangle shape above the knee. The right hand rests 
on the hip. 
489 Holtzmann (1981) 886: LIMC lists sixteen statues or torsos of this type. 
Fig. 21: Asclepius Este Statue Type. 
Little changed until the late Trajanic period but a new statuary type appears on the 
coinage of Asia Minor, namely the Asclepius Amelung type. This statue of 
Asclepius stands barefoot on a round base and is wearing a himation, drawn over his 
left shoulder and loins, which leaves his chest, right shoulder, and right arm bare. He 
holds his snake-staff in his right hand, supporting his right shoulder. A round object, 
the omphalos, is on the ground next to his left foot (Figs. 22-24).490 LIMC does not 
actually list this type as a separate one but lists it under the Este type and only an 
examination of the photo plates shows certain statues to be of the Amelung type and 
not the Este one (Fig. 21).491 
490 Grimm (1988) 168. See also LIMC nos. 155 and 157 for futher representations of Asclepius with 
the omphalos. Kampmann (1992/3) 39-40 states that the round object has been referred to as a globe 
by some scholars, see Lacroix (1951) 17. However, as there were no connections between the cult of 
Asclepius and a globe this cannot be the case and, therefore, it must be an omphalos. Kampmann 
describes the depiction of the omphalos on coinage as either egg-shaped or hemispherical. 
491 Holtzmann (1981) 886-887. 
Figs. 22-24: Asclepius Amelung Statues.  
The similarities with the Este type are striking but Grimm states that the Amelung 
type is actually a variation of the standard Giustiani/Epidaurian type.492 In this 
iconographical type Asclepius is standing with his right leg slightly bent. His right 
arm dangles along a long snake-staff which is fixed under his armpit and his fist is 
on his hip. His mantle covers his entire body apart from his torso and his right 
shoulder. The edges of the mantle form a bulge which parts for the right shoulder but 
traverses the torso and forms a circle around the left elbow.493  
The Amelung iconographic type is strongly present on numismatic 
iconography and is first represented on coinage of Amisos in the early 2nd century 
AD.494 However, Kranz notices something noteworthy: that this type, which became 
the emblem of Pergamum, virtually does not appear on Pergamene coinage such as 
the homonia coins (see below) though it does appear on Pergamene coinage issued 
492 Grimm (1988) 168.  
493 Holtzmann (1981) 879: LIMC lists forty statues or torsos of this type. See for example Rome 
Museo Nuovo Capitolino Inv. No. 1846. This type is dated to the 4th century BC.  
494 Kranz (1990) 131. 
by Lucius Aelius Verus.495. The homonoia issues still use the older types such as the 
Epidaurian one. The cistophori represent Asclepius in yet another type.496 It is likely 
that this was a local version of the god who was present before the remodelling of 
the sanctuary. Kranz believes that the Asclepius Amelung was the god who was 
connected to the Pantheon, and was one which fitted in with Hadrians religious 
policies.497 This combined with the Hadrianic date of his introduction indicates that 
it is likely that this type represented the new Hadrianic god Zeus-Asclepius. The new 
Amelung type and the round temple were both bound to the person of the emperor, 
namely Hadrian.498 This type was of lasting importance and was represented on a 
medallion issued by Antoninius Pius commemorating Asclepius advent to Rome 
and also by Caracalla on his imperial coinage.499  
A statue type similar to the Amelung one is known from Nea Paphos in 
which Asclepius holds an egg in his right hand. Grimm connects this to the prophet 
Alexander from Abouteichos and his version of the god, Asclepius-Glycon, where 
the god, in snake form, was made to hatch from an egg as a result of the prophets 
duplicitous workings.500 However, Mazzuca following Sirano argues that the statue 
type of Asclepius with an egg actually comes from the Coan Asclepieion.501 Sirano 
believed that the statue type came from Temple C on Cos sometime in the 2nd 
century AD.502 Mazzuca explains the egg iconography as being a symbol for the 
Universe and he states that In this way, the iconography states that the entire

Universe, represented by the egg, needs the medicine of Asclepius.503 However, the 
Coan cult did not seem to have any universal character but it has been shown here 
that this was more a feature of the Pergamene cult of Zeus-Asclepius as a result of 
Hadrians patronage of the cult. 
3.3.2 The Emperor at Epidaurus 
Fig. 25: Plan of the Asclepieion in Epidaurus in the 3rd century BC. 
The sanctuary at Epidaurus enjoyed its peak in cultic activity in the 4th and 
3rd centuries BC (Fig. 25). The sanctuary was rebuilt in the 4th century BC, after 
which the cult went into a period of stasis and decline, not unlike many other 
sanctuaries at this time.504 The number of inscriptions and dedications drastically 
diminished from the 2nd century BC onwards and was mainly linked to political

events in the 1st century BC, such as the sack of the city by Sulla and by the Cilician 
pirates.505 Excavations have shown destruction and abandonment in the hostel, 
gymnasium and the water-supply system, dating to the 1st century BC. This decline 
is also shown by a lack of dedications and healing testimonies from this period.506  
Melfi states that the sanctuary was only preserved by traditional benefactions 
from local elites.507 During the last quarter of the 1st century BC the sanctuary 
suddenly became the focus of these elites who erected many dedications and also 
statues of the imperial family.508 This is especially shown by the inscriptions as they 
document a move away from a cult which was only concerned with religious duties, 
to one which also had a more public and civic function, as from this period only one 
dedication was found, but fifty-three honorific inscriptions were erected in the 
sanctuary.509  
A new festival called the Kaisarea in the imperial period, was founded in AD 
32/3.510 A series of inscriptions suggests that a statue group was set up to members 
of the imperial family with statues erected of Livia, Drusus, Lucius Caesar, Tiberius, 
Agrippina Major, Drusilla, Claudius, Agrippina Minor, and Messalina.511 It is likely 
that this was an initiative on the part of the sanctuary itself, trying to connect itself 
with the imperial household and, thus, boosting its status and prestige and perhaps 
even hoping that imperial honours would be bestowed on them. Melfi states that the

1st century AD was a period of crisis but also of rebirth for the sanctuary, which was 
the result of imperial interest.512 
 Even though the sanctuary managed to keep on existing and as the result of 
mainly local interest in the cult, boosted by imperial interest, its decline continued 
until the Hadrianic period. Hadrian visited Epidaurus in AD 124 and had a definite 
effect upon the sanctuary as the emperor enforced new regulations concerning the 
appointment of religious staff. From the second quarter of the 2nd century AD a new 
dating system appeared on most of the inscriptions, indicating that at some point 
during this century, and very likely as a result of Hadrians visit, the priesthood had 
become an annual post and was probably assigned by allotment.513 A hiereus and a 
pyrphoros were elected together, sometimes consisting of a combination of a father 
and son.  
As a result of Hadrians visit the festival and games of Asclepius were 
reorganised as most Hadrianic Epidaurian coins bear Asklepieia as part of the reverse 
legend.514 The coins also suggest an identification between the emperor and 
Asclepius, perhaps in a way not dissimilar to what happened at Cos, where the title 
Sebasta was added to the festival name during the Claudian period (see section 
3.1.5). Coins depicting Asclepius head on the obverse were substituted by Hadrians 
head, suggesting an interchangeability between the god and the emperor.515  
Hadrians visit did not just result in the reorganisation of the sanctuary and 
revival of the rites but also altered the nature of the worship of Asclepius at 
Epidaurus. From the Hadrianic period onwards, dedications to All Gods or the 
Pantheon were found in the sanctuary, indicating that here too Hadrians new

universal and syncretic religion had been imported.516 This importation and 
syncretism with Asclepius is also shown by the identification from this time onwards 
of Asclepius and Zeus, just as at Pergamum. Hadrian had visited Pergamum before 
he travelled to Epidaurus and there were further Pergamene influences on the cult 
here as the figure of Telesphorus appeared for the first time at this point.517  
 The sanctuary at Epidaurus also shows both the lasting impact of an imperial 
visit and the provincial response to this. Hadrian made the first step in the 
rehabilitation of the sanctuary by reorganising its administration and rights. 
However, these acts alone did not completely change the fortunes of the sanctuary as 
the emperor did not instigate a rebuilding programme here, as he likely did at 
Pergamum. This in itself is noteworthy if the sanctuary was in as bad a state of 
disrepair as the archaeology indicates. It was only in the second half of the 2nd 
century AD that the sanctuary was rebuilt and modernised (Fig. 26) by the senator 
Sextus Iulius Maior Antoninus Pythodorus, as is related in Pausanias.518 Antoninus 
came from Nysa and added baths, the so-called portico of Kortys, and the temple of 
the Egyptian Apollo, Asclepius, and Hygeia to the sanctuary. The structures which 
he rebuilt had an original superstructure of unbaked mud-brick, which would 
inevitably have collapsed over time. Tomlinson suggests that the decay of the 
sanctuary was, therefore, more likely to have been caused by a shortage of funds, 
rather than as a result of general neglect.519 Hadrians interest in the cult instigated a 
provincial response which then furthered and completed the rehabilitation of the cult. 
By showing interest in the cult, Hadrian set an example for other elites to follow. 
The Roman senator Antoninus could have followed Hadrians lead and carried on his

momentum. Imperial supplications of a god, therefore, had more lasting and also 
further reaching effects than just the immediate benefaction.

3.3.3 Pergamum, Epidaurus, and Eleusis 
 If Hadrians visit to Pergamum inspired him to adapt the cult at Epidaurus via 
the introduction of the syncretic, universal deity Zeus-Asclepius, then it is likely that 
Hadrian was also influenced by the Pergamene version of the god when he visited 
Eleusis. Divine connections between the Eleusinian goddesses, their Mysteries, and 
Asclepius were well known already in antiquity, as Asclepius was initiated into the 
Mysteries upon his arrival in Athens.520 However, a statue from Eleusis reveals even 
further connections between the emperor and the two cults (Fig. 27): 
Fig. 27: Antinous and the Omphalos. 
The statue depicts Antinous in an unusual iconography, wearing a himation leaving 
the right shoulder bare and there is a globe at his left foot, which is the omphalos. 
Antinous had been initiated into the Mysteries together with Hadrian in AD 128.521 
The statue was found in the courtyard in front of the Greater Propylon and past 
scholars believed that the statue was of Antinous in the guise of either Dionysus, as 
he was associated elsewhere with this god, or Apollo, because of the presence of the 
omphalos.522 However, the statue looks nothing like either of these gods and the 
omphalos actually does provide the key to identifying the statue as Antinous 
depicted in the guise of a young Asclepius. Other imagery of Asclepius was found

with the omphalos in exactly the same position, especially on numismatic emissions 
(see below). The statues right arm is missing where he would normally have held 
the snake-staff but the garment is draped in typical Asclepieian style.523 Antinous is 
depicted as some kind of Neos Asclepius, perhaps echoing Hadrian as he was 
granted this title in Pergamum.524 The iconography of the statue is Pergamene, which 
travelled to Epidaurus and also Eleusis along with the emperor as a result of his 
patronage, showing the impact the emperor on the dissemination of his new version 
of the god in Greece but also, and of equal importance, the local response to imperial 
benefactions.  
3.4 The Impact of Imperial Sacred Travel on the Cult of Asclepius: Caracalla 
3.4.1 Introduction 
Like Hadrian, Caracalla travelled through his empire. Of all of the emperors, 
Caracalla seemingly worshipped Asclepius the most directly and extensively, and 
perhaps had the most lasting impact on the cult, despite his successor Macrinus best 
attempts to change this (see section 3.4.6). Asclepius was most frequently 
represented on Caracallas coinage, more so than for any other emperor, and 
numismatic evidence will form a large part of the material discussed here. This 
section will examine his visit to the Pergamene Asclepieion and the benefactions 
which he gave there. The impact this patronage had on other cults of Asclepius in 
Asia Minor will then be researched, as well as other Caracallan worship of the god 
523 Galli (2001) 66. 
524 Clinton (1989) 1525: he states that there is no doubt that this is some form of neos Asclepius. 
and the interaction between Rome and the provinces. Provincial responses to 
Caracallas grants will also be explored.  
3.4.2 Caracallas Path 
Around AD 213-214 Caracalla visited the Pergamene Asclepieion in order to 
supplicate the god there. This visit was part of a grander tour of Asia Minor. 
Unfortunately the route which the emperor took on this journey is unknown due to 
mutilation of some sources and lack of interest by others.525 Literary sources do not 
mention the period between Caracallas departure from Nicomedia in April of AD 
215 until his arrival in Antioch later in that year.526 The main sources of evidence for 
Caracallas visit are, therefore, numismatic, epigraphic, and iconographic. Neocorate 
grants also show poleis visited by Caracalla at this time.527 Various modern scholars 
have tried to provide a definite route for Caracalla and Levick provides an overview 
of his path, arguing that Caracalla wished to emulate Alexander the Greats travels 
through Asia Minor. She argues that Caracalla travelled through western Pisidia 
from south to north, following Alexanders route. Also in the spirit of emulating 
Alexander, Caracalla sacrificed at Troy, before moving on to Pergamum.528 Johnston 
has more recently argued that Levick made several errors in creating this route and 
that the early numismatic catalogues used by Levick tend to be inaccurate.529 
Johnstons study argues that twenty-five of the seventy-seven places suggested by 
Levick have proven to be inaccurate and that many others are doubtful.530 It is,

therefore, impossible to state with any certainty which path Caracalla took through 
Asia Minor, leading him to and from Pergamum. Halfmann, again, provides the best 
overview of Caracallas travels, and Levick in a more recent publication follows him 
in this.531  
Halfmann reconstructs Caracallas path as follows: he left Rome at the end of 
AD 212 or early 213, leaving his mother, Julia Domna, in charge of correspondence 
and petitions.532 He moved through Gaul to Upper Germania and Raetia. At the end 
of AD 213 the emperor travelled to Pannonia, where he possibly overwintered in 
Sirmium before continuing through the Balkans in AD 214, going through Dacia, 
Moesia, Thrace, Marcianopolis, and Perinthos until he reached the Hellespont. In the 
second half of 214, Caracalla travelled through Asia and Bithynia, visiting Ilium, 
Pergamum, and Thyateira before moving on to Ionia, Lydia, and Bithynia. He 
overwintered in Nicomedia in AD 214/5 until the middle of April. Caracalla spent 
AD 215 in Asia Minor, visiting Prusias ad Hypium, Tyana, and Tarsos, before 
spending the summer of that year in Antiocheia. Laodikeia and Peleusion were also 
visited in 215 but he spent the winter in Alexandria before returning to Antiocheia in 
the spring of AD 216. 216/7 was spent on the Parthian campaigns, before he 
overwintered in Edessa. Caracalla was assassinated on the road between Edessa and 
Carrhae on April 8th 217, putting a definite end to his travels.533 
3.4.3 Caracalla and the Need for Healing

inscriptions and literary sources. 
The ancient sources may not explicitly state which route Caracalla took to get 
to Pergamum but two literary sources do explain why the emperor travelled there, 
with Cassius Dio stating that: 
             , 
       ,       
        . []

  ,         : 
         ,      
   ,       .534  
Herodian informs us that:  
  ,        v,    
 ,     .   , 
      ,   .535  
534 Cass. Dio 78.15.3-7: For he was sick not only in body, both from visible and also from unspoken 
illnesses, but he was sick in his mind, seeing distressing visions, and it seemed to him that he was 
often chased by his father and brother armed with swords [] but he received no help from either 
from Apollo Grannus, nor from Asclepius, nor Sarapis, despite making many supplications to them 
and his persistence. For he sent them prayers and sacrifices and votives even from abroad and many 
couriers ran about every day carrying something of this kind. And he went to them as he wished to 
succeed in person, and he went through all the motions which supplicants make but he gained nothing 
which strengthened his health. Dios account of Caracallas life was written eight years after the 
emperors accession and two years after his death. Caracalla is consistently depicted in the worst 
light, and stated to be cowardly, deceitful and stupid: Cass. Dio 77.14. Dio also shows no pity or 
mercy towards Caracalla in the passage quoted above. 
535 Herodian 4.8.3: And then having done this, he made what administrative arrangements were 
possible in the cities, he went to Pergamum in Asia, proclaiming that he wanted treatments from 
Asclepius. When he arrived there, he incubated as much as he wanted, and then he went to Ilium. 
Nothing is known about Herodians life other than what he mentions in his writings. He could have 
been a senator but was more likely an equestrian: Whittaker (1969) xix-xxi. Whittaker (1969) xiv 
argues that the work was likely composed sometime after AD 244. One of the main problems with his 
work are the many omissions. Sidebottom (1998) 2813 argues that the work is extant in an unrevised 
and incomplete form.  In the past, Herodian has been depicted as an ignorant, careless, fraudulent, and 
trite source, whose work was based upon that of Dio. However, Sidebottom (1998) 2786 has shown 
that while Herodian did have access to Dio, this was not his only source as Herodian uses material, 
both artistic and literary, which does not occur in Dio. Herodian claimed to have been a contemporary 
of the events about which he writes but this does not have to be the case and Sidebottom (2007) 79 
argues that some evidence indicates that he may have lived during Gallienus reign. Herodian also 
contrasts Geta and Caracalla, although both are portrayed in a negative light from the start. Severus 
trained both in self-control (3.10.2) but both were corrupted by luxury and their mutual antagonism 
(3.10.3-4). Their portrayal alters during the British campaign, when Herodian begins to portray Geta 
in a better light, showing Caracalla to be the worse of the two. 
Shortly after Getas assassination, Caracalla fell ill and dreamt that he was being 
pursued by his father and brother who were intent upon murdering him. His travels 
around the empire, and supplication of Asclepius, were connected partially to his 
need to find a cure for this malady.536 Dio also mentions that Caracalla sought the 
help of Apollo Grannus and Sarapis; Caracalla met Apollo Grannus on his northern 
campaigns in Phoebiana, modern Faimingen.537 However, while Dio mentions 
Caracalla also supplicating Apollo Grannus and Serapis, Herodian only lists 
Asclepius and also does not mention that healing was denied to Caracalla as Dio 
does. The Historia Augusta does not mention Caracallas visit to Pergamum at all. 
Literary freedom and bias should be taken into account here and even though the 
ancient sources state that there were medical reasons for Caracalla supplicating these 
gods, it is possible that one should seek more reasons for these supplications than 
just those provided on the surface. Caracalla could have utilised their locally 
important deities to connect with cities in order to legitimise his reign and ensure 
their loyalty.538 The emperor specifically chose to go to Pergamum and not to 
patronise another cult, such as Epidaurus. It is also at this time, during the 2nd 
century AD that meetings between gods and emperors start to become widespread on 
civic coinages of the Roman east.539 The rite of adventus was the most conspicuous 
of these and Caracallas advent to Pergamum in order to worship Asclepius and the 
lasting effects it had on the cults of Asclepius in Asia Minor will be explored 
extensively here. 
536 Fowden (2005) 545. As Levick (2007) 90 points out, though, an open assassination of Geta seems 
improbable as there were far more subtle ways available for Caracalla to have Geta murdered, such as 
poison.

538 Rowan (2012) 136. It could also be a combination of both these reasons. 
539 Harl (1987) 52: this started during Commodus reign. 
Emperors generally needed to legitimise their reigns, and Caracalla was no 
different. In fact, it was probably even more vital for him to do so after Getas death 
and he sought an imperial identity other than that of a fratricide. Asclepius as a 
soteriological deity would have been a logical god to worship in both cases: that of 
physical healing and of salvation. There were three main groups to whom an 
emperor had to appeal to in order to remain in power, namely the senate, the army, 
and the populus.540 Mennen mentions that one way of cultivating feelings of 
goodwill was by handing out donatives but that these would probably end when the 
gifts stopped. It would be more fruitful to display personal images of the emperor, 
showing his power and legitimacy, stressing three aspects, namely military, dynastic, 
or religious.541 It was not possible for Caracalla to portray dynastic imagery as he 
had both his brother and his wife, Plautilla, assassinated, thus literally killing his 
hopes for any heirs.542 He, therefore, had to focus on the other two aspects. Many 
coin reverses show traditional military themes and Caracalla is also often represented 
in a military fashion, dressed in military garb (see Fig. 34 for an example). Divine 
military figures such as Victoria, Fides, Pax, and Mars all occur on Caracallan 
coins.543 Religious representations played an important role on coins during 
Caracallas reign and Rowan has shown how numismatic iconography changed 
under Caracalla. When he ruled jointly with Septimius Severus, there had been a 
strong emphasis on personifications and virtues, yet the coinage minted under 
Caracallas sole rule focussed more on gods.544 Asclepius also appears on Severan

coins from the Roman mint, struck in AD 207, which Mennen links to a possible 
sickness of Severus (Fig. 28):545  
Fig. 28: Coin showing Severus on the obverse and Asclepius on the reverse from Irenopolis in Cilicia,

Under Severus, Liber Pater and Hercules were closely connected to the emperor but 
shortly after Caracallas accession Liber Pater completely disappeared from the 
coinage and Hercules also vanished two years into Caracallas rule.546 Rowans 
quantitative study of Severan coin hoards reveals that a large number of the coins 
struck in Caracallas reign show Apollo, Sarapis, or Asclepius, the three gods 
mentioned in the passage in Dio.547 She offers two explanations for Caracallas 
worship of healing deities and cautions that the motivations given by Dio for 
imperial worship should not be taken at face value; Caracalla could explicitly have 
set out with the intention of worshipping these gods, or he could just have 
worshipped the locally important deities which he encountered on his travels.548 In 
both cases the end result was the same. Caracalla publicly worshipped Asclepius and 
the ways in which he did this and also the lasting effects of this supplication will be 
shown here. Coinage was a way to connect the emperor and the divine basis of his

power with a local god. For a city, a god was a way to connect itself with an 
emperor.549 Many divine motifs appear on Caracallan coins from AD 214 onwards, 
which was also the last time when Hercules appears on his coins.550 Asclepius 
appears more commonly from this year on, probably linked to Caracallas visit to 
Pergamum. The god appeared on all types of Caracallan coins, firstly on aurei in AD 
214 and then on other denominations from 215 onwards.551 
3.4.4 The Cult at Pergamum 
In the Julio-Claudian period Pergamene coinage was dominated by the 
granting of its first neocorate to the city and the imperial succession.552 In AD 50 the 
citys output of coinage ceased for about twenty years until it resumed under 
Domitian, from which point onwards the iconography focussed on new imagery such 
as divine figures, architecture, and rites. These motifs were continuously struck until 
Caracallas reign, after which the city focussed on a select few images such as the 
emperor or Asclepius. These iconographic themes continued until Gallienus.553  
Asclepius was one of the main polis deities of Pergamum and, thus, was 
commonly depicted on Pergamene coinage. The first coin depicting Asclepius from 
Pergamum is dated to between 211-130 BC. The god only starts to appear frequently 
on coins from 133 BC to the Augustan age where he appears on bronze issues.554

555 These tables do not intend to provide a quantitative overview of all the coins issued by Pergamum 
and other cities in the Roman empire depicting Asclepius, but wish to offer an indication of the 
increased depiction of Asclepius on coins issued from the time of Caracalla onwards. 
Fig. 29: Members of Imperial Household Depicted on Coins from Pergamum with Asclepius. 
These table and graph (Table 5 and Fig. 29) show that the largest number of coins, as 
listed in BMC Mysia, with Asclepius on the reverse were minted under Caracalla, 
showing the cults popularity at the time. This was probably the result of Caracallas 
public supplications of the god and people reacting to this worship. Williamson 
makes an important point when stating that the reverse of provincial coin types 
shows a locus of communal identity and one which has been publicly sanctioned; 
these representations of local identity were always those which did not threaten 
Rome, such as religious cults and heroes and other local geographic or geological 
features.556  
As a polis deity, Asclepius had long been depicted as on the homonia coins 
issued by Pergamum, Ephesus, and Smyrna.557 These three cities were constantly 
battling for the title  /first of Asia, which was granted to the leading

city on the basis of tradition, beauty, age, origins, culture, and cults.558 Based upon 
these criteria, any change in the status of a city, for example due to imperial 
benefactions, could change these dynamics and cause the title to shift to another city. 
These coins commemorated these changes in status and also alliances between the 
cities. It seems that the city whose status had changed, the dominant partner in the 
alliance, was the one who issued these coins.559 Antoninus Pius sought to end this 
internal competition and gave the title first of Asia to Ephesus, which issued two 
coin series. The other cities were greatly offended so Pius instead called Ephesus  
      , Pergamum    
      , and Smyrna The First Capital 
of Asia Concerning her Beauty.560

Under Commodus, Pergamum issued its biggest series of homonia coins (Fig. 30), 
showing Asclepius, but it was under Caracalla that Smyrna issued its largest series, 
giving the Pergamene Asclepius the place of honour on the centre or left-hand side 
on six of its coins.561 This reflects the increase in Pergamums status as a result of his

visit and benefactions to Asclepius as represented on the coin series discussed here. 
However, Smyrna also received an additional neocorate which may have promoted 
this coin series. Commodus is not known to have patronised Asclepius in any way 
but during his reign Asclepius occurs frequently on Roman provincial coin issues, 
where the god was struck on the reverse of sixty coin types, this in contrast to 
coinage of Lucius Verus, where Asclepius occurs on twenty-eight types and that of 
Marcus Aurelius where there are fifty-two Asclepieian emissions. However, on 
provincial emissions struck under Antoninus Pius, the god appears on eighty-five 
types making Commodus the second-most prolific emperor depicted with the god on 
provincial coins. 
Pergamum gained its third neocorate in AD 214. Coins of Geta, in the guise 
of Augustus, dated to AD 209 mention that Pergamum was only twice neokoros and 
it is only after Caracallas visit that this new inscription appears on coins and the 
grant should be dated to this time.562 The first two neocoraes were of Augustus, who 
shared a temple with Roma, and Trajan, sharing with Zeus Philios. Two statue-bases 
of Caracalla and Julia Domna, who accompanied her son into Asia Minor, have been 
found in Pergamum, one dated to 214, confirming that he travelled there in that 
year.563 In fact, the empress appears together with Asclepius on thirteen different 
coin types listed in the Catalogue of Greek Coins in the British Museum corpora

It is at this time that Caracalla visited the city and Caracallas movements in 
Pergamum are well documented on a series of medallions struck by the city after his 
visit.565 These medallions were issued by the Pergamene local mint and not the 
Roman imperial one.566 They were miniature monuments, documenting the 
emperors patronage of Asclepius and Pergamum.567 The first issuing magistrate of 
these medallions was Marcus Caerelius Attalus, as indicated by the inscription on the 
medallions. Two other magistrates names also occur, namely Julius Anthimos and 
Marcus Aurelius Alexandros. There are slight differences between these issues as, 
for example, Caracalla appears both in military and civilian garb on Attalus coins 
but only in military dress on Anthimos in order to emphasise Caracallas triumph.568 
All of these were annual magistracies and indicate that series of medallions was 
significant enough to Pergamum to be restruck on two more occassions.569 
Anthimos series was probably released in AD 217-8, showing Caracallas adventus 
in order to recall it. Presumably they were reissued before Caracallas death as 
Macrinus would not have been keen to see medallions honouring his predecessor

330, which are all variations of the same coin, show Nike crowning Tyche. All the other coins issued 
during Caracallas reign depict the emperor worshipping Asclepius. 
566 The range of their circulation cannot be stated with any certainty nor can Caracallas approval or 
authority behind these designs. Butcher (1988) 30 stated that while in the past it was taken that 
emperors granted permission for cities to strike coins there is no evidence to support this. Poleis were 
not likely to design coins which would have been displeasing to the emperor, especially in cases like 
these coin series as they were designed to commemorate the emperors visit and benefactions.  As 
they were to honour the emperor, and also to promote the increased standing these benefactions gave 
to Pergamum, it would be possible that Caracalla was aware of their existence. The volumes of 
Roman Provincial Coinage dealing with the Severans have not been published yet in hardcopy but are

(see below).570 As the medallions were struck as part of a series and individually, it 
is more likely that the events they show actually took place in some form.571 Imperial 
coinage was issued by the mints several times a year, making it possible to connect 
specific iconography with events, while medallions were generally issued at the start 
of each year.572 Provincial coinage gives an insight into the ideologies and cultures 
of local cities, identifying events and matters which they thought important.573 The 
medallions were not solely concerned with Caracallas worship of Asclepius, though 
the god does appear on the majority of the medallions, but also show Caracalla 
interacting with other civic gods. All of the medallions show a bust of Caracalla 
wearing a cuirass on the obverse. They depict Asclepius and Caracalla as equals, 
showing both Asclepius as a symbol of the healing the emperor received in 
Pergamum, but also his personal devotion to the god and his relations with the 
city.574 Albinana argues that Pergamum took advantage of Caracalla and his desire to 
be healed in order to gain a third neocorate and to have the Pergamene temples 
restored, among other things (see below).575  
The reverse of the first Asclepieian medallion of the series as listed in BMC 
Mysia (Fig. 31) shows an equestrian Caracalla wearing military dress standing in 
front of a turreted female figure, the Tyche of Pergamum, who holds a statue of 
570 There is some debate as to whether these issues should be referred to as coins or medallions. 
Medallions differ from coins as they generally were presentation pieces which were larger than 
regular coins in circulation, and also did not have the legend SC on them: Rowan (2014) 109. They 
differed in size and weight from regular coins. Rowan (2014) 110 notes that early medallions were 
struck using the same dies as coins but on larger surfaces. However, from the 2nd century AD onwards 
special dies were made for the production of medallions. The largest number of medallions were 
struck during Hadrians reign. Medallions were  a way of showing the owners close relationship 
with the emperor: Rowan (2014) 111. Rowan (2014) 115, analyzing medallions struck under 
Antoninus Pius, states that the audience for these medallions would have been the elite inner circle, 
who would have had knowledge of the events which were depicted. As such, the term medallion 
seems more befitting the Caracallan issue and will, therefore, be referred to as a series of medallions.

Asclepius in her hand.576 Harl describes an adventus as a dramatic event, where the 
emperor, coming into the city was greeted by the citys magistrates, populus, and, 
most importantly, its gods, who were carried in the form of statues from their 
sanctuaries to greet the emperor. This was aimed at fostering a positive feeling in the 
population towards the emperor and, thus, legitimising his rule.577 The emperor then 
worshipped at a sanctuary and gave benefactions. Often festivals and games were 
also held. Here, by connecting Asclepius and Tyche, the chief protective deity of a 
city, from the outset it was clear that Asclepius was a polis-deity, something which is 
reinforced by the gods presence at Caracallas adventus:

The emperor holds his hand up in greeting, which was a typical image of an advent 
from the time of Trajan onwards.578 By greeting these local gods, the emperor was 
seen as emulating both Germanicus and Hadrian, who had toured the provinces.579

of a statue of Asclepius on a tall pedestal.581 A soldier follows the emperor. There 
are, thus, strong military iconographic themes here:

sometimes with the specific god to whom he sacrificed omitted, became one of the 
more popular depictions of the emperor on coinage issued throughout the 3rd century

stands on the left, striking at the bull who is tied to a ring by his nose.584 Caracalla is 
wearing a toga in his capacity as sacrificant. Similar iconography had been present 
on coins from the Julio-Claudian period onwards.585

The ninth medallion in the series (Fig. 39) depicts three temples. Asclepius is shown 
seated, holding a snake in the central temple.589 Other deities were placed in the two 
adjacent temples:

589 BMC Mysia 156.327. 
Minute letters on the temple pediments identify the temples as those of Augustus on 
the left, Trajan on the right, and Caracalla in the middle.590 These three temples 
housed a cult of the emperor as well as that of a deity. The neocorate title was 
inscribed on all of these medallions such as on the eighth coin, whose inscription 
reads: 
[EI CTP M KAIP]E ATTAOV/EPAMH/NN/  /
This inscription indicates that Pergamum now had three neocorate temples.592 By 
depicting himself as a protector and rebuilder of sanctuaries, Caracalla is placed in 
the heavenly company of the emperors who predeceased him.593 Fig. 38 shows 
Caracalla worshipping in front of a temple; Burrell notes that it does not make sense 
that Caracalla would worship at his own temple and that it is more logical to believe 
that he shared a temple with another deity and it is to that god whom he sacrifices.594 
This iconography of the three temples continued on Pergamene coins until the reign 
of Gallienus.595 Temple sharing was the norm in Pergamum so it would not be 
unusual for Caracalla also to share his temple. It is possible, then, that Caracalla was 
incorporated into Asclepius temple at Pergamum during his lifetime.596 A 
monumental statue-head of Caracalla was also found at Pergamum (Figs. 40-41):597 
590 Burrell (2004) 31. Smyrna also minted coins at this time depicting Caracallas worship of the three 
main temples there: BMC Ionia 288.402.

An inscription found with this head refers to the emperor as domino indulgentissimo 
indicating that Caracalla had likely already made benefactions to the city, such as the 
neocorate, by then.598 None of the medallions depict the honour of placing this 
colossal statue in the temple. The fact that the cult-statue of Asclepius is depicted 
seated here is remarkable as the more common pose for Asclepieian cult-statues, and 
the one which most frequently appears on coins as well as statuary, is the standing 
god who leans on his staff (see above) (Fig. 42):

The most famous seated cult-statue of Asclepius was that of Epidaurus (Fig. 43) but 
the Pergamene cult statue (Fig. 44) may have been based upon the famous 
Epidaurian one:599

from Tricca: SNG Cop 266; SNG Cop 267 and on Pergamene coins: BMC Mysia 121.73. 
The medallions, thus, have a rich iconography dedicated to showing the 
viewer all of the actions undertaken by Caracalla when he was in the city and 
demonstrate the high regard in which he held the cult.600 They show that he followed 
both religious and therapeutic rituals in search of healing and give a detailed 
synopsis of the emperors actions within the city, namely his advent, the sacrifices, 
an oracular visit, culminating with the grant of the third neocorate. Rowan suggests 
that it could be possible that these medallions were meant to be viewed together as a 
record of events which would show the increased status of Pergamum as a result of 
the imperial visit.601  
3.4.5 Caracalla and Asia Minor 
Caracallas further travels around Asia Minor are noteworthy as the cities 
which he visited on this tour were obviously aware of his supplicating Asclepius at 
the Pergamene sanctuary as there was a surge in coinage depicting Asclepius and 
other Pergamene deities after this, as well as a rise in festivals and competitions of 
Asclepius, which will be further explored in this section.602 The other cities of Asia 
Minor wished to please the emperor by appearing to honour a god he favoured and 
also wished to emulate and copy the pre-eminence of the Pergamene shrine. Coinage 
was one of the most deliberate symbols of public identity, with Roman provincial 
coinage being especially rich in iconographic types with over a hundred thousand 
600 Caracalla was depicting honouring a number of other gods on provincial coin emissions, see Harl 
(1987) 59 for a list. However, here the literary evidence of Caracalla favouring Asclepius in Dio and 
Herodian should be taken into account.  His worship of Asclepius fits into, but also transcends the 
pattern of imperial worship in the Roman east. 
601 Rowan (2012) 134. 
602 Noll (2003) 414-416. See below. 
coin types from over 500 cities.603 Religion, in the form of polis deities and local 
temples and shrines, was a common way of expressing identity on these coins.604 
The other poleis in Asia Minor witnessed Caracallas extensive benefactions to 
Asclepius in Pergamum and wished to honour both the emperor and the god he 
favoured in order to gain their own imperial patronage. Asclepius occurred 
frequently on their coinage at this point and the poleis either gave new rites, or 
restored forgotten ones to local cults of Asclepius.605 Bearing in mind that 
Caracallas exact route through Asia Minor is unknown, it is impossible to state 
which city started this emulation or give a time-scale in which this occurred. 
However, Pergamum was one of the earliest stops on Caracallas tour and it is 
possible to estimate which emulations followed Caracallas worship of Asclepius at 
Pergamum, showing the results of imperial worship of a cult and also the provincial 
response to such supplications and favour. It will also be explored here how it was 
not just provincials who responded to imperial benefactions but that Rome itself, and 
the whole empire through this city, altered its perceptions of the god due to imperial 
worship. 
Caracalla spent the rest of AD 214 travelling around other parts of Asia 
Minor where he visited other poleis and Asclepieia. This can roughly be traced by 
coin emissions and inscriptions. Noll argues that Caracalla actually returned to 
Pergamum after 23rd September of this year as this is when the second series of these 
coins was issued by Iulius Anthimos, showing a simpler version of Caracallas 
advent to the city.606 However, this seems unlikely as there was no reason for

Caracalla to have returned to the city. There was a surge in the worship of Asclepius 
in Asia Minor at this time: in Laodikeia a festival in honour of Asclepius and 
Caracalla was founded called the Antonina Asklepieia. This was first held in 215/6 
AD and was commemorated by coin issues bearing the legend Pythia Asklepieia.607 
This shows the adoption of imperial supplication and ideology on a local, regional 
level and illustrates the provincial response to an emperors actions. In Ancyra the 
equestrian and priest of the koinon, Titus Flavius Gaianus, honoured the emperor and 
petitioned him for the right to commemorate the healing gained at the hands of 
Asclepius by founding a festival. Caracalla granted this right and the Asklepieia 
Soteria Antonineia Isopythia was founded. A temple to Asclepius Soter, the popular 
Pergamene version of the god, was built. The festival included athletic competitions 
which were probably first held in Caracallas presence. A coin series was again 
struck to commemorate this.608  
Caracalla also travelled to Cappadocia and Cilicia after Pergamum. The city 
of Aigeai in Cilicia had developed as a philosophical and religious centre as a result 
of its Asclepieion in the imperial era.609 The emperor visited the famous temple of 
the god at some time after his visit to Pergamum and the city added the name 
Antoninupolis [sic] to its name and commemorated the emperors visit by issuing a 
silver coin showing a statue of Asclepius on the reverse and a bust of the emperor on 
the obverse.610 The city issued a new tetradrachm in AD 216/7 which depicts a bust 
of Asclepius on the obverse and the temple of Asclepius on the reverse.611 This is the 
607 Auktion Egger 49 (1914) 1782; Noll (2003) 415; Rowan (2012) 156; Burrell (2004) 121. The 
Antonina Asklepieia must have been named thus in honour of Caracalla, whereas Pythia Asklepieia 
perhaps occurs on account of Asclepius being the son of Apollo.

first time that the temple of Asclepius was depicted on civic coinage from Aigeai.612 
It is noteworthy that this tetradrachm was inscribed with theophilous in its legend. 
This should be read as the beloved of the god which illustrates the emperors pietas 
but also his close relationship with Asclepius.613 Caracalla was now closely 
associated with the god, which had its basis in his worship of the god at Pergamum. 
Further Caracallan coins depicting Asclepius and Telesphorus were issued in Aigeai 
between November 215 and November 216.614 Severus Alexander and Valerian are 
also depicted on coins from Aigeai (Fig. 45) worshipping Asclepius and both 
emperors likely visited the city.615 The case of Severus Alexander at Aigeai is very 
interesting as the city starts to call itself Alexandroupolis after the emperor, a not 
uncommon way of honouring an emperor, as it had previously called itself 
Antoninupolis for Caracalla. The obverses of coin-type struck here show the emperor 
in his usual guise, wearing a military costume, but there is also an Asclepieian snake-
staff hovering in front of Severus Alexander.616 This is the same staff that occurs on 
the Caracallan silver issue discussed above and on the coin struck under Valerian.

The legend of Severus Alexanders coin reads: Imperator Severus Alexander the 
architect of the newly repaired temple of Asclepius.617 The legend on the obverses 
of four coin-types struck here, including the one showing the snake-staff, honour the 
emperor and call him greatest chief priest of the world and of Asklepios [sic]. 
Burrell suggests that it is likely that the city of Aigeai made Severus Alexander chief 
priest of Asclepius and that it received a neocorate, its first, in return for this 
honour.618 It is possible that Valerian, like Severus Alexander, received a priesthood 
of Asclepius at Aigeai.619 Bloesch argues that the snake-staff iconography used on 
these coins would make Severus Alexander a kind of neos Asclepius here, similar 
perhaps to Hadrian who was neos Asclepius in Pergamum.620 The second coin in the 
series shows the emperor sacrificing in front of the temple of Asclepius in an 
iconography, resembling that of Caracalla worshiping at the temple of Asclepius in 
Pergamum.621 On the other two coin-types struck here, Severus Alexander holds the 
snake-staff with an eagle on top, combining Asclepieian iconography with that of the 
imperial triumph, perhaps indicating that here the cult of the emperor and that of the 
god had become intertwined.622 This case is remarkable as it shows that there was a 
certain level of continuity in the cult here with imperial patronage and that in both 
cases the emperors visited the sanctuary and the locals actively sought to connect the 
emperor with the god here. In a way there was a dynastic link between Asclepius, 
Caracalla, and Severus Alexander. This dynastic connection between the office of 
emperor, Severans, and Asclepius is also shown by an inscription from Aigeai:

The inscription is dated to AD 238 on the basis of Gordian IIIs titulature and is 
noteworthy that it is not erected just for the emperor for himself but to a group of six 
emperors.624 The presence of the Severans here is remarkable but should be seen as a 
reflection of the strong connections the city had with these emperors, especially 
Severus Alexander, and the neocorate he granted the city. This grant would have 
elevated the city to be on equal standing to its rival poleis of Tarsos and Anazarbos 
who had already been granted neocorates.625 
Soloi-Pompeiopolis, also in Cilicia, struck coins depicting Caracalla standing 
in Asclepius presence.626 Nicaea also issued coins depicting Caracalla sacrificing to 
Asclepius and Hadrianotherai in Mysia shows Caracalla shaking hands with 
Asclepius while being crowned by Tyche.627 This iconography again shows 
Caracalla and Asclepius as equals, as also occurred on the Pergamene coins. A 
decision was taken by all of these cities specifically to link this god, Asclepius, and 
this emperor, Caracalla.628

It was not just provincial mints in Asia Minor whose worship of Asclepius 
was adapted and boosted by Caracallan patronage but also in Rome itself. As 
mentioned above, Caracalla did not represent the Tiber Island sanctuary on his coins. 
However, Asclepius had been depicted on both provincial coinage, including on that 
of many Greek poleis before the Roman era, and also on issues struck by the Roman 
mint. However, from the time of Caracalla onwards a new Asclepieian iconography 
was introduced on coins, namely a globe and often also Telesphorus (Figs. 46-49):  
Fig. 46: Silver Denarius Showing Asclepius, Teleshorus, and the Globe from the Roman Mint, AD 
215. RIC 253.

215. RIC 253. 
Fig. 49: Bronze As showing Asclepius with the Globe from the Roman Mint, AD 215. RIC 553a.629 
This iconography was probably based upon the Asclepius Amelung type discussed 
above, the cult-statue of which had been introduced by Hadrian to Pergamum and 
placed in the new temple of Zeus-Asclepius there, fitting in with his ideology of a 
panhellenic universal religion.630 The globe was a representation of the omphalos, 
which had been connected to the Pergamene cult since the pre-imperial era as 2nd-
and 1st-centuries BC coins depict Asclepius standing with his snake-staff and the 
omphalos which is dated to 133-16 BC (Fig. 50):631

The legend of the coin reads:  . The omphalos was also a 
symbol of Apollo and it is possible that due to the familial relations between Apollo 
and Asclepius the symbol also became linked with Asclepius and was commonly 
629 This coin was struck between AD 198 and 217 and does not show Telesphorus but only a globe. 
However, another version of the same denomination, an as, RIC 538a does show Telesphorus.

depicted on coins from the 2nd half of the 5th century BC onwards.632 Lacroix 
suggests that this iconography may have been chosen by the Attalid kings in the 2nd 
century BC as part of their campaign to be on friendly terms with Delphi and Pythian 
Apollo.633 Asclepius as the gods son would have been the logical method to stress 
these connections. The symbol was clearly connected with Asclepius in Pergamum, 
though, as a homonia coin with Ephesus, representing the civic deities of both poleis, 
from Commodus time depicts the omphalos at Asclepius feet (Fig. 51):634

It was important for the inhabitants of the empire to know that Caracalla had been 
healed by the Pergamene Asclepius and the emperor was, therefore, represented on 
the coinage together with an Asclepieian iconography which was specific to 
Pergamum, namely the omphalos and also the figure of Telesphorus.635 Caracalla 
would also have wanted to legitimise his reign by divine association. Having 
obtained this divine sanction, it was portrayed on Caracallan numismatic 
iconography, as coinage was a very public way of disseminating ideology. This is

very remarkable as normally local iconography takes over the empire-wide one but 
here exactly the opposite happened. The orb iconography seems to have become a 
standardised part of Asclepieian iconography on coins at this point and was found 
across the empire. This iconographic change outlasted Caracallas reign and still 
occurred on Pergamene coins decades later, as well as on Roman imperial coin 
issues (Fig. 52):636

This Antoninianus was struck in the Cologne mint between AD 260 and 269 and 
depicts the radiate emperor Postumus. It clearly shows the Pergamene omphalos 
lying next to Asclepius right foot. While not all Roman imperial coins depicted the 
omphalos and Telesphorus, the fact that a proportion of them did shows the lasting 
impact of Caracallas supplication of the Pergamene Asclepius (Table 6).

The origins of Telesphorus are unclear but he was a particular Pergamene deity and, 
in one version of events, was the founder of the city.637 His cult is not attested much 
before the time of Trajan, although he did spread to Epidaurus and Athens in the 2nd 
and 3rd centuries AD.638 He is also found as far away from Pergamum as Batkun in 
Thrace, where there was a major sanctuary of Asclepius.639 The earliest 
representation of Telesphorus is on a Hadrianic coin from Pergamum (see section 
3.3.2).640 However, his main area of influence was in the eastern part of the empire, 
his place of origin.641 This god only gained prominence on coins from the time of 
Caracalla onwards. His name means end-bringer and could, thus, indicate an end to 
Caracallas crises.642 His presence is also a reoccurring motif on imperial coins (Figs. 
53-55):

All these coins come from Phrygia, one of the regions visited by Caracalla after his 
supplication of Asclepius in Pergamum.

Coins were issued in various provinces depicting Caracallas successor 
Macrinus on the reverse and a standing Asclepius on the obverse (Fig. 56). However, 
only a few coin types are known and all of these were found in the Roman provinces 
of Phrygia and Moesia Inferior:643

This use of the gods iconography on his coinage is surprising as Macrinus was 
particularly harsh in his measures against Pergamum and the cult of Asclepius after

Caracallas death and his own ascendancy to the imperial throne. The emperor 
withdrew some of the favours which Caracalla had granted to the city, to which 
Pergamum responded by openly insulting Macrinus. He in turn stripped the city of 
honours, as is narrated by Dio.644 Due to Caracallas patronage of Asclepius and 
Pergamum, which were very publicly commemorated by the coin series, the city, the 
cult, and the emperor had become connected in the public eye. By taking harsh 
measures against Pergamum, Macrinus was publicly working against Caracallas 
precedent, although in subtle ways, as he did not wish to anger the army and people, 
which is why he was cautious in his treatment of Caracallas mother, Julia Domna.645 
He presented himself as Caracallas successor while subtly undermining his 
image.646 One of the honours which was taken away by Macrinus was the third 
neocorate but after his death and erasure, this honour reappears on Pergamene coins, 
although only a few coins recall the specific temples they were associated with.647 
This coin legend continued in use until the reign of Valerian and Gallienus. 
Pergamum was the first city to have received a koinon temple of the ruling emperor, 
as well as the first to receive a second and third temple.648 The positive aspects of 
such imperial benefactions are, thus, quite clear, as are the negative side-effects.

 There was a great imperial impact on the cult of Asclepius and this happened 
in a variety of ways. As was outlined in the introduction, there was no standard rule 
to which emperors adhered when worshipping Asclepius. Many are not even 
reported to have supplicated the god at all, which was especially the case in the early 
empire. However, from Hadrianic times onwards, the god became more popular with 
emperors and they continued worshipping him until the late empire, something 
which is likely connected to the then prevalent idea that the health of the emperor 
was connected to the wellbeing of the empire. The impact these emperors had on the 
cults of Asclepius was also in part due to the role provincials played in either 
motivating imperial worship, as happened with Xenophon on Cos, or in taking up the 
act of supplication and broadcasting it to the wider world, as Pergamum and other 
cities in Asia Minor did. Provincial elites played an important role in bringing the 
god to the attention of the emperor or depicting the emperors adherence to the cult, 
increasing its standing and prestige. 
 Xenophon was a member of Claudius court and served him until his death in 
AD 54. Shortly thereafter the Asclepiad returned to Cos where he assumed a number 
of local priesthoods, among them that of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Epione. Xenophon 
had previously played a vital role in prompting Claudius to ask the senate to bestow 
the right of immunitas to the Asclepieion and the island. As Tacitus relates, the 
Coans were ordered to dedicate themselves to serving the god. Xenophon spent the 
remainder of his time in Cos actively reminding the Coans of his role as imperial 
courtier and the prestige he had gained for the island. No other Coan or Asclepiead 
was given the same number of honorific decrees as Xenophon was in Cos and the 
surrounding islands, and the number of titles given to the physician is also 
unparalleled. The epigraphical data is overwhelming and shows that Xenophon gave 
as much importance to his Coan connections as to his Roman imperial ones. He 
would have been aware that a courtiers power derived from his access to the 
emperor and his ability to intercede with him on behalf of his polis. However, living 
in Cos he no longer had access to that power but he was represented as still having a 
good relationship with Nero by being called himself philoneron. The honorific 
decrees were used as a way to further his self-representation as an imperial courtier 
in Cos. Asclepius was the conduit by which he could articulate this imperial 
closeness. 
The case of Xenophon illustrates the relationship which he had with the 
emperor and Asclepius, which had strong regional elements. As well as courtiers, 
another factor which had considerable impact upon the cult of Asclepius during the 
empire was the phenomenon of travelling emperors. This chapter has argued that 
while any journey could turn into a sacred journey, sacred travel for the purpose of 
healing must have had some degree of predetermination. Therefore, while Caracalla 
may have worshipped Asclepius because he was the main deity of Pergamum, this 
does not mean he did not set out with the purpose of worshipping the god. In doing 
so he was following a precedent set by Hadrian who had worshipped Asclepius at 
Pergamum. This visit had lasting effects on the sanctuary there as it prompted a 
rebuilding and also the introduction of a new universal deity, Zeus-Asclepius, whose 
worship and creation fits in with the unifying ideologies of Hadrians reign. 
Something similar occurred at Epidaurus, another sanctuary which was visited by 
Hadrian. Here, he reorganised the priesthoods and festivals of Asclepius and again 
this initial imperial worship was then taken up by local and also non-local elites who 
followed the example of their emperor and gave further benefactions to the cult. In 
the case of Epidaurus this also meant a grand rebuilding of the sanctuary. Imperial 
benefactions had the further result of creating links and connections between these 
sanctuaries. This is best shown via the iconography of the new Pergamene god Zeus-
Asclepius which had a distinctive round object, the omphalos, placed at the gods 
foot. This iconography also occurred in a statue of Antinous at Eleusis and played a 
great part in Caracallas stimulation of the cult.  
Caracalla is depicted on a series of medallions extensively worshipping the 
Pergamene god. Herodian and Dio inform their readers that he worshiped the god as 
he was being haunted by his murdered brother Geta. However, Caracalla visited the 
shrine as part of his wider tour of Asia Minor and his supplication may have been a 
way to legitimise his reign and create goodwill in his population. Nevertheless these 
supplications had lasting impact on the cult as other cities in the area were aware of 
his worship of Asclepius, which caused them to revive their own local sanctuaries, 
such as at Epidaurus. Caracalla is depicted in a number of places together with 
Asclepius. One of the most notable occurrences of this is at Aigeai, where the city 
issued a silver tetradrachm depicting Asclepius. Caracallas successor Severus 
Alexander also visited Aigeai where he was given the high priesthood of Asclepius 
and gave a neocorate in return for this honour. Severus Alexanders actions must 
have been prompted by a desire to follow Caracallas precedent, creating dynastic 
links between the Severans and Asclepius here. This is also shown by coins and 
inscriptions of later emperors which explicitly refer to the Severans in connection 
with Asclepius. Asclepius at Aigeai had, thus, become a Severan dynastic god. 
Further imperial impact upon Asclepius across the empire is shown by the 
adoption of the Asclepius Amelung type, the standing Asclepius with the omphalos 
at his foot, by the Roman imperial mint, which caused the dissemination of this 
image across the empire. Other specifically Pergamene Asclepieian iconography, 
such as Telesphorus, is also found in other poleis and provinces after Caracallas 
worship of the Pergamene god. Something remarkable had occurred with his worship 
here as, unusually, there had been a shift in iconography which had come from the 
provinces to Rome and not vice versa as usually occurred. Caracallas Roman 
coinage showed this shift as did all coins struck by the Roman mint after his healing 
at Pergamum, which showed Asclepius with the globe at his foot, the iconography of 
the Pergamene Zeus-Asclepius. While not all depictions of Asclepius post-Caracalla 
adhered to this iconography, it became a favoured and standard iconographic theme 
across the empire. The representation of the Pergamene Telesphorus together with 
Asclepius also became popular, indicating that post-Caracalla the Asclepius who was 
depicted and worshipped across the empire had in part become the Pergamene 
Asclepius. There was, thus, a lasting imperial impact upon the cult of Asclepius. 
Each individual emperor had an impact upon the god and his cults but connections 
between these benefactions can be traced across time and the various Asclepieia. 
While many of the sanctuaries discussed in this chapter existed and were also 
popular in the pre-imperial era, they seem to flourish during the Empire, and the 
emperor was one of the major factors in this. The Roman army also played an 
important role in boosting worship of the god and also disseminating his worship 
further across the provinces. The impact of the Roman army upon the cult of 
Asclepius in the Danube and Balkan regions will be examined in the next chapter. 
Chapter 4: Asclepius and the Army  
4.0 Introduction 
Already in the archaic Greek world there was a strong relationship between 
war and religion, as gods of battle were worshipped, war booty was dedicated in 
sanctuaries, and warships named after gods. Soldiers asked deities for protection and 
oracles, and offered sacrifices in return.649 There was also a strong belief that the 
outcomes of battle and wars were determined by the gods. In the Hellenistic period, 
gods appear as saviours in perilous situations and soteriology, rescue in this life and 
the next, gained in importance, as is shown by new festivals called soteria and the 
widespread use of the epithet soter.650 In the Roman world there was just as strong a 
connection between the army and religion and two aspects of this are frequently 
commented on, namely emperor worship and the worship of healing deities, as 
inscriptions to these gods are often found both intra castra and in close proximity to 
military camps.651 The dangers of a soldiers profession meant that he went in search 
of extra protection and from as many gods as possible to cover all his bases.652 
Dedications were set up both in thanks for healing or prophylactically, to prevent any 
future harm.653 The military worshipped the same gods as civilians but paid extra 
attention to those who could protect them. A number of sacella dedicated to healing 
gods have been found in alleged valetudinaria, or hospitals, across the empire. A

sacellum to Asclepius and Hygeia at Novae in Moesia Inferior is the most important 
and will be discussed below (section 4.2.1). 
This chapter aims to examine the impact of the Roman army on the cult of 
Asclepius, as the army was one of the most visible symbols of Roman power.654 It 
will focus on the cult of Asclepius in the Balkan and Danube provinces and will 
explore how the army shaped the cult in this area. This region has been chosen as the 
impact of the military is especially visible near the Danube and Rhine because of the 
number of legions and auxiliaries stationed there.655 With the exception of Thrace, 
none of these provinces seemingly had any cultic worship of Asclepius prior to the 
Roman conquest and the cult was only transported there with the army after the 
conquest. As such, this region is an excellent case-study to explore the impact of the 
Roman army on the cult of Asclepius. The legionary and auxiliary presence was also 
especially strong here as by the end of the 3rd century AD almost half of the Roman 
legions were stationed in this region and nearly a third of auxiliary units.656  
After establishing himself as Augustus, the emperor made significant 
changes to the Roman military by creating an official army with a hierarchy of units 
with himself as supreme commander, ensuring that the legions were loyal to him.657 
He also placed most of the legions in the provinces, on the frontiers, keeping only 
about 5% of legions near Rome.658 In the city of Rome there were two separate 
military forces: the praetorians and the urban cohorts. There were nine praetorian 
cohorts, whose task it was to guard the emperor, while the urban cohorts were tasked 
with the security of the city, making them a kind of police force.659 From a political

perspective the praetorians was perfectly placed to impact directly upon events in 
Rome but, as Le Bohec points out, the military nature and the large numbers of 
provincial units gave them a leading position.660 One of the main characteristics of 
the Roman army was its relatively small size, consisting of only c.5-7.5% of the 
population of the empire, which then had to cover a large geographic area.661 
Tiberius did little to alter what Augustus put in place and the structure of the army 
remained virtually the same throughout the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The military 
remained the exclusive domain of the emperor, as can be seen from Augustus will 
where he detailed the numbers of soldiers and where they were stationed at the end 
of his reign.662  
The Roman army worshipped a variety of gods and divinities. Foremost 
among these was the cult of emperor, which formed an official part of the religion 
of the army, and all units, no matter where they were stationed, participated in 
this.663 This is best shown by the calendar from Dura-Europos, a frontier town on the

663 Imperial cult or emperor worship has been the subject of much recent scholarly interest, with the 
latter being the preferred term as the former implies a cohesive religious system which was not the 
case: Gradel (2002) 7. Notable publications in the field of the cult of the emperor are S.R.F. Price 
(1984) Rituals and Power; the Imperial Cult in Asia Minor, D. Fishwicks series on The Imperial Cult 
in the Latin West (1992-2005) and most recently I. Gradel (2002) Emperor Worship and Roman 
Religion. Gradel (2002) 4 emperor worship should not be treated separately from other forms of 
ancient religion as it was not treated as distinct at that point either. This practice had its origins in the 
ruler cults of Hellenistic kings in the east, where they had been given isotheoi timai, honours equal to 
those granted to the gods: Fishwick (1993) 21. There was no such thing as the cult of the emperor as it 
was not a centrally administered phenomenon and also had no dogma but was made up of a variety of 
local practices: Galinsky (2011) 3. Price (1984) 53 states that the standard view concerning emperor 
worship was that the Greeks were the sole initiators of the ruler cult and that the Romans only adapted 
and modified this practice. The high degree of communal organisation and the dominance of Greek 
culture in the cults in the east are an explanation for the relatively uniform nature of the cult in this 
part of the world and its difficulty at disseminating into the wider empire: Fishwick (1986) 227. The 
Greeks were trying to find a way in which to accept and place the reality of subjugation to Rome in 
their world; they were coping with being under the dominance of an external power which was 
outside of their traditional civic structures: Price (1984) 1; Fujii (2013) 157. The uniformity of the cult 
forms part of this adaption to a changed world. The cults of the emperor were housed in temples 
which followed plans for those of traditional deities and their priesthoods were also based upon those 
of the Greek gods: Gradel (2002) 81. Provincials were able to place the emperor in their world, 
Euphrates. Religion could have bridged the gap between civilians and soldiers, if 
both groups had participated in the same cults. However, if they worshipped separate 
cults, the gap could actually be increased.664 The main questions this chapter aims to 
examine are: What was the impact of the Roman army on the cult of Asclepius? 
What role did mobility play in this? How did the cult differ in the Balkans from the 
other provinces? And why was Thrace so different from the other Balkan provinces? 
The main case-studies will be sanctuaries located in the Balkans and Danube 
regions, namely in the provinces of Pannonia, Moesia, Thrace and, Dacia. Those in 
Germania and Britannia will be used for comparative material. The questions will be 
answered via an examination of several factors in the military worship of Asclepius, 
namely the relationship between army medicine and the god, vows, the Thracian 
Rider, and religious mobility. Each of these will be studied in turn. The impact of 
Empire on the cult will be shown via the army, as with Augustus the nature of the 
army changed and transformed from a situation where units were mobilised only for 
specific campaigns to a permanent army with an officer class which was constantly 
moving across the empire. The creation of the permanent army changed the nature of 
its mobility and it will be shown here how this also changed how soldiers 
worshipped Asclepius. 
4.1 Asclepius and the Army in the Balkan and Danube Provinces; Pannonia, Moesia, 
Dacia, and Thrace 
between gods and humans, according to their own wants and needs, resulting in highly individual 
cults which had traditional elements: Fujii (2013) 157. 
664 Pollard (2003) 142, 149: Pollard notes that there is little evidence for civilians and soldiers sharing 
religious habits in Syria and Mesopotamia. 
 The previous chapters have shown the diverse groups by whom Asclepius 
was worshipped, reinforcing the point that his cult was open to all. The god was 
worshipped in different ways, to varying extents, and by diverse military groups in 
each of the provinces. This is not surprising seeing as the army was so large and 
diverse that multiple local communities existed within the army as a whole. There 
was a close relationship between community and identity which was expressed in the 
holding of certain types of equipment such as swords and sword belts.665 
 This chapter aims to examine the impact of the Roman army on the cult of 
Asclepius in the Balkan and Danube provinces and how the army shaped the cult. 
While it is impossible to state for certain that the army brought the cult with it to 
these regions, this is quite likely as before the Roman conquest no evidence for the 
cult was found in these areas, with the exception of Thrace, and the cult, therefore, 
seems to have been brought here by the Romans. Dissemination of other cults to 
various provinces by the army is known, for example the Dii Campestres (see 
below), making it possible that the army transported the cult of Asclepius with them. 
The fact that there was no Asclepieian cultic activity in these regions before the 
conquest makes them a good place to study how a fresh cult of Asclepius was 
transported here and then adapted to suit local needs. In examining this, this chapter 
aims to look at how collective and individual military identities are expressed via 
supplication of Asclepius.  
4.1.1 Other Military Cults 
665 Haynes (1999) 7, 9-10. 
In order to understand better the relationship between soldiers and gods, two 
case studies will now be presented, briefly examining these relations. One of the 
most popular cults with the army was that of the military genii (see also section 4.5). 
The origins of this cult are unknown but probably started as a private cult which then 
became a state cult at some point. Many places within a camp had a genius such as 
the armoury or granary.666 Off-duty soldiers were free to worship whatever gods they 
wished, so long as this did not interfere with their tasks and the epigraphic evidence 
reflects both the private and public religious acts of the soldiers.667 Provincial units, 
due to their contact with a civilian population and influenced by local cults, created 
their own unique regional religious world, where they did not just worship Roman 
gods but they also supplicated eastern gods and local deities, evidence for which is 
mostly epigraphic.668 These cults and rituals could distinguish the various ethnic 
backgrounds and identities of army units.669 The Roman army was vital for the 
dissemination of cults and, especially as more and more provincials were admitted to 
the army, more regional deities were spread to places far from where they originated.  
One of these private cults was that of the Campestres. These deities were 
always worshipped in their plural form and were originally Celtic goddesses whose 
worship spread across the empire via Gallic cavalrymen who were enlisted in the 
Roman army. Most votives are found in Lower Germany, implying that this was 
their place of origin.670 These goddesses were also occasionally called Matres, 
linking these deities to other Celtic triads and their belief in the trifold power of 
gods, namely war, fertility, and healing.671 Their worship became strongly linked 
666 Speidel and Dimitrova-Mileva (1978) 1542-3, 1553.

with the equites singulares in Rome and were commonly listed as one of their patron 
deities.672 Here, they were also associated with Epona who was the patron goddess of 
horses and cavalrymen. Outside Rome, the dedications are completely different in 
nature. In Rome, the equites worshipped these goddesses as a unit and they are also 
often mentioned on discharge papers, but out in the provinces, the dedications are 
strictly personal in nature.673 Their worship was disseminated as far away as Africa 
where they were called the Dii Campestres and altars to these gods have been found 
at Lambaesis and Gemellae.674 This is a specifically African version of their name 
and these goddesses are worshipped under variations of their names in other 
provinces.675 
Another god commonly connected to the military is Mithras. Early scholars, 
such as Cumont, explicitly linked the dissemination of the gods cult with the 
military, especially since, as Gordon points out, Cumonts theory of oriental 
religions depended on this.676 Clauss states that: 
As members of Mithraic congregations we find rather soldiers, members of the 
imperial administration in the clerical and sub-clerical grades, slaves and freedmen 
belonging to the domus Caesaris and private households, and ordinary citizens.677 
The earliest evidence for Mithraic worship comes from the Roman provinces but, 
according to Clauss, was connected to people who were originally from Italy, such 
as a dedication by a centurion from the cohors XXXII voluntariorum civium

Romanorum which came from Nida.678 Members of this unit had been recruited from 
among Roman citizens, something unlike what happened with most auxiliary units. 
Legions worshipped the god extensively in Britannia, Germania, Rome, Ostia, and 
Numidia but the cult made little headway with the military in the provinces of 
Noricum, Dalmatia, Raetia, Moesia Superior, the Pannonias, most of Hispania, and 
the Gauls. The idea that Mithras was an almost exclusively military deity has been 
shown not to be the case as in the aforementioned provinces the cult mainly drew 
civilian worshippers while in Britannia and Numidia civilians virtually did not 
supplicate Mithras at all.679 In Numidia the provincial governors were entered into 
the cult.680 Auxiliaries almost never worshipped Mithras, with the exception of those 
stationed in Britannia.681 On the other hand they did worship gods such as Jupiter 
Optimus Maximus extensively.682 Parallels with the cult of Asclepius can be drawn 
as it will be shown in this chapter that there was also a high degree of regional 
differentiation in his cults.  
4.1.2 Provincal Background and Religions 
As well as understanding the religious background of the army, a knowledge 
of the history of each province is also vital for understanding military background 
and the differences between provinces. Moesia had not yet been established as a 
province in the second half of Augustus reign but when the province was formed it 
678 Clauss (2000) 21. This is in contrast to what is now being argued by Gordon (2009) 394 who 
suggests  that the earliest evidence for the cults spread is via trade routes and of the four inscriptions 
often used to indicate military involvement in the cult only one actually shows this, namely CIL 
3.4416.

was more a process of consolidation than conquest as Crassus had already brought 
much of the region under Roman control.683 With its long Danubian border a large 
military presence in the province was needed and, as in Pannonia, one legion was 
stationed on the Danube and two inland during Tiberius reign. However, some 
changes were made during the Claudian period when the III Scythica was 
permanently replaced by the VII Claudia.684 Vespasian added to the troops already 
stationed in Moesia by transferring the V Alaudae there. Following a number of 
serious military defeats, Domitian separated the province into two in AD 86 creating 
Moesia Inferior and Superior.685 Emperor cult was found across Moesia and the 
Capitoline triad was second in importance with 18% of the known votives erected by 
soldiers. Of the military dedications, only 2% were to Mars, this in contrast to 
Germania where he was very popular, and 5% of the dedications were to Hercules.686 
A disproportionately large percentage of the dedications, namely 18%, were erected 
to Diana and Apollo. However, this concerns just the official cults from Rome, 
whose votives were mainly found clustered around military camps. Many unofficial, 
private, cults also had sanctuaries close to camps and the most popular of these 
deities were the Thracian Rider with 17% of dedications, Asclepius and Hygeia with 
7%, 4% to Silvanus, and 2% to Liber Pater, who was very popular in Pannonia.687 
Dedications to the Rider, Asclepius and Hygeia were mainly found away from 
camps and cities, despite numerous military worshippers. Important cult sites of 
Asclepius were at Lilyache, Gaganitsa, Glava Panega, Lyublen and Draganovets.688 
A sanctuary was also probably located near Dorf Tueniza, one to Asclepius Heros

at Dorf Kalnovo, and possibly another near Nicopolis ad Istrum which was to the 
theoi soteres.689 In his catalogue, Riethmller lists fourteen sites for which there is 
cult evidence, two of which are shrines of Asclepius located in sanctuaries of the 
Thracian Rider.690 All of the cult evidence here is dated to the Roman period. 
Dacia was one of the last areas to be added to the empire and only became a 
province in AD 106. The precise borders of this province are not known and they 
were redefined under Hadrian following a number of Sarmatian attacks in AD 117-
8.691 At the end of Trajans campaigns in the region there were two legions stationed 
in Dacia, namely the XIII Gemina and the IV Flavia Felix but the latter was moved 
to Moesia by Hadrian.692 The province was split into three parts, namely Superior, 
Inferior, and Porolissensis sometime around AD 120 but the Marcomannic wars 
which took place some fifty years later prompted another reorganisation.693 During 
these wars the V Macedonica was permanently transferred from Moesia to Dacia but 
the vast majority of units stationed in Dacia were auxiliary units with military 
diplomas mentioning fifty-eight different units.694 It is not possible to comment on 
the religious habits of the Dacians before the conquest as there is little evidence for 
this. After the conquest Liber Pater was one of the most popular gods in the area.695 
Various cults, namely those of the emperor, Liber Pater, Silvanus, Mithras, Apollo, 
Diana, and Nemesis, were located in Sarmizegetusa Ulpica. An inscription to 
Aesculapius Pergamenus shows that there was cult here.696 Riethmller lists 
seventeen cult sites, all of which are dated to the Roman period. About seventy

inscriptions to Asclepius and Hygeia have been found in Dacia, of which twenty-
three do not have epithets. They are mainly to Asclepius or Asclepius Augustus but 
the gods name is sometimes joined with numen or deus but dominus and kurios also 
occur.697  
Pre-conquest religion in Pannonia had Celtic and Illyrian elements. However, 
very few traces of this remain, and where they do they are mainly names which give 
no indication of the nature of the god worshipped. Fertility deities were supplicated 
widely across the province and Pan was the main god of the native Illyrian 
population.698 During the Julio-Claudian period there was one legion stationed in 
Pannonia on the Danube and two within the province.699 The events of AD 69 
prompted a revision of the placement of legions in the area even though this did not 
occur until the time of Vespasian and Trajan. The former transferred a number of 
auxiliary forces from Pannonia to the Rhine region and the latter divided the 
province into Pannonia Superior and Inferior.700 Riethmller lists six places in 
Pannonia Superior and five in Inferior where there is evidence for worship of 
Asclepius.701 
Thrace became an official Roman province under Claudius in AD 46, 
although prior to this it had already been a client state from around 20 BC onwards. 
The military nature of the province was very different from those around it. Regular 
units were only infrequently stationed in this region and there were no legions there 
on a permanent basis. However, the province was very important for providing 
troops for the army and there were in total thirty-one auxiliary units which had the

name Thracum and who must have come from Thrace and not Moesia.702 Gods such 
as Ares, Dionysus, Artemis, and Hermes enjoyed cult in this area. However, as 
Hercules was not worshipped extensively here prior to the conquest, it is assumed 
that he was introduced by the Romans.703  
It is important to understand the movements of legions in each of these 
regions as the creation of a permanent army under Augustus altered the nature of the 
mobility of the army. Units were mobilised not for a specific campaign but were a 
fixed part of the landscape. They were no longer disbanded at the end of a period of 
conflict but were either kept in an area to ensure a continuation of the peace or were 
moved to another area where there was a pressing need for extra military forces due 
to conflict. This thesis aims to show that the now permanent nature of the army had 
an impact on the cult of Asclepius as soldiers changed the way they worshipped this 
god and also disseminated his worship. Collar has argued for the cult of Jupiter 
Dolichenus (see section 1.1.8) that this cult was disseminated via army officer 
networks as these officers were more mobile than the infantry. The inscriptions 
presented in this chapter will be shown to have predominantly been dedicated by 
members of the officer class. To show the impact of Empire on the cult, the 
following sections will each examine the factors mentioned above which illustrate 
the relationship between the army and Asclepius. First, the creation of a medical 
corps as part of the new permanent standing army will be examined and how this 
stimulated the worship of Asclepius in new contexts and geographical regions. The 
connections between sacred and secular healthcare for the army will be looked at, 
and how both the military and physicians helped disseminate the cult due to high 
levels of mobility within these two groups. This will be followed by a section on 
702 Haynes (2011) 8.

that cultic transferal via the military was possible.  
vows and one on worship in Thrace, where the cult of Asclepius was joined with that 
of the Thracian Rider. These two sections will show the interplay between religion 
and identity and how supplicants sought to articulate the latter within a dedicatory 
context and how both regional and global identities were shaped to reflect a 
dedicators image of themselves. The final section will examine religious mobility 
and connectivity and will also focus on the articulation of identity within a cult 
context. 
4.2 Sacred and Secular Healthcare for the Roman Army 
Together with the general army reforms (see above), it seems that some kind 
of health care system for the army was created under Augustus.704 In the Republican 
period there were no official army doctors and soldiers had to take care of wounds 
themselves. This health care was rather ad hoc with tents erected where and when 
they were needed.705 However, this did not mean that there were no individuals who 
took care of wounded soldiers but rather signals that there were no members of the 
army who had the official and specifically appointed position as doctor.706 Cicero 
does mention army medics in his work, indicating that soldiers were not completely 
abandoned when they were in need of health care.707 The first named army medic 
was Sextius Titus Alexander who belonged to the V Praetoria in AD 82.708 The 
army was expensive in its upkeep so it made sense to create a corps dedicated to its 
704 Israelowitz (2015) 87 argues that the army was the most important place where medicine was 
practised outside of the household because of its scale, connectivity, and geographical reach. 
Israelowitz (2015) 93 also states that it is possible that Augustus dedicated a section of his Disciplina 
Augusti to the administration of the health care for the army; Suet. Aug. 49.2; Cass. Dio 52.27. 
705 Nutton (2005) 524.

708 CIL 6.20. 
wellbeing, part of whose job was also preventative medicine such as preventing and 
controlling infectious diseases and finding salubrious places to found army camps.709 
The first distinct army medical units appeared from the time of Caesar onwards.710  
Army medicine differed from the civilian version as these doctors would 
have wanted to avoid surgery at all costs whereas this was not possible for army 
physicians who would have had to treat battle wounds.711 Most of these wounds 
would have been flesh wounds caused by arrows and other projectiles, for which the 
chances of healing were relatively great. Celsus devotes a number of chapters to 
explaining how to treat these using specialised equipment and it is likely that many 
army physicians would have had access to such texts.712  
It is unclear exactly to what extent health care was available for soldiers, as 
no literary text actually discusses this, but it has now been generally accepted that 
this was better for the legionaries than it was for auxiliaries.713 Wilmanns has done 
an in-depth study of the spread of doctors across the troops, leading her to conclude 
that there were more doctors among the legions while there might only be one doctor 
or some minor health care workers for a whole auxiliary unit.714 She argues that if 
there was one doctor per 500 troops that would mean that in the middle of the 2nd 
century AD there would have been some 800 doctors in the army, though it might be 
safer to estimate a figure of between 500 and 800.715 The actual number and 
experience of the medical staff assigned to a unit would have depended on the size 
and prestige of the unit in question, for example the cohors IV praetoria had both a 
medicus chirurgus and a medicus clinicus, as it was one of the most prestigious

units.716 It is possible that each fort or fortress would have had a medicus ordinarius 
who had a rank equal to that of a centurion and would serve under a medicus 
castrensis/castrorum. However, in auxiliary camps it is possible that the ordinarius 
would have been the highest medical officer, highlighting the difference between 
legionary and auxiliary medicine.717 Dedications concerning medici were generally 
either set up by someone else for the medicus, or by the medicus for another person; 
for example an inscription from Vinovia (Binchester) (Fig. 57) shows a medicus 
dedicating for the wellbeing of the wing he belongs to, one of the most prestigious 
army units. This illustrates collective army mentality which apparently included the 
medical staff as well. The date of the inscription is unknown.

An inscription from Novae, on the other hand, shows a physician setting up a 
dedication for his own health: 
Aesc(u)la/p(i)o et Hy/giae Ae(lius) / Macedo / med(icus) p(ro) s(alute) s(ua) 
p(osuit?)719 
None of the lower medical ranks, such as capsarii, are attested epigraphically, which 
would fit in with general army epigraphic trends where mainly men of officer rank, 
namely centurion and above, made dedications.720 This chapter aims to explore how 
the increased mobility of army officers, made possible due to the infrastructure of the 
Roman empire, aided the transmission of cults and elements of cults of Asclepius, 
following ideas laid out by Collar (see section 1.1.8). 
Further inscriptions were set up by physicians across the Balkan and Danube 
provinces, for example at Emona in Pannonia. Asclepius and Hygeia were 
worshipped here from early on and three altars were found dedicated to them. 
However, only one of these can be dated and was set up by a medicus who probably 
came from Aquileia and possessed Roman citizenship (Fig. 58): 
Sacr(um) / Aesculapio / L(ucius) Peticius Techni(cus) / med(icus)721 
719 AE 2003 1541: To Asclepius and Hygeia, Aelius Macedo, medicus, erected this for his own

720 Allason-Jones (1999) 134. 
721 CIL 3.3834: Sacred to Asclepius, Lucius Peticius Technicus, medicus, [erected this]. It is not 
clear exactly when the colony of Emona was founded but ael Kos (2008) 687 argues that it was 
sometime shortly after the battle of Actium.  
Fig. 58: CIL 3.3834. 
The altar was found in situ, in an area which corresponded to the north-east area of 
the ancient city, immediately east of the forum.722 The nomen Peticius signals that 
the dedicator could originally have been from Aquileia. An inscription from the area 
of Fucino mentions a Titus Peticius chirurgus which could indicate that this was a 
medical family as Tiussi points out that many of the old families from Emona 
originated from Aquileia and the North-Adriatic region.723 The religious world of 
Emona, however, did not resemble that of Aquileia at all but was a blend of Roman 
and local cults. Aecorna, Asclepius, Ceres, Diana, Hercules, Hygeia, Jupiter, Jupiter 
Depulsor, Laburus, Lares, Mater Magna and Oraea, Mercurius, Mithras, Nemesis, 
Neptune, the Nymphs, Silvanus, and Victoria are all attested to have been 
worshipped here, with Jupiter receiving the most cult with eight extant altars, 
followed by Aecorna with five, Victoria with four and then Asclepius with three, 
indicating the importance of the cult here.724 In this way, religious life at Emona 
might actually echo that of Aquileia as it had the second largest cult centre of 
722 Tiussi (1999) 89.

ordinary. 
Asclepius in Italy apart from Rome.725 Other evidence of military adherence to the 
cult comes from Vindobona where a centurion from the legio X Gemina, Publius 
Aelius Lucius dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Asclepius, Sirona and Apollo, 
and also from Aquincum where two altars to Asclepius and Hygeia were found in the 
Roman baths, the second of which was dedicated by a junior decurio called Marcus 
Foviacius Verus.726 It is possible that the baths were connected to the valetudinarium 
and that soldiers used the facilities as a result. Aquicum has the most inscriptions set 
up by doctors of any site in the North-Western provinces, among which is a 
dedication to Asclepius by Tiberius Martius Castrensis who was a medicus (Fig. 59):  
Aesculapio / Ti(berius) Martius / Castrensis / med(icus) leg(ionis) II A(diutricis) /

727 AE 1937 180. To Asclepius, Tiberius Martius Castrensis, medicus of the legion II Adiutrix under 
Quintus Fuficius Cornutus, consul designate, set this up. 
Here Asclepius is dedicated to by a medicus again. The inscriptions shown here 
indicate conclusively that there was no competition between Asclepius and 
physicians but that even the latter asked the former for aid. Likewise, the Athenian 
Asclepieion Inventories list dedications made by physicians.728 This shows that this 
cooperation was not a feature of the military nor the Roman period, but that it was in 
place from the start. However, these inscriptions clearly illustrate the various forms 
in which doctors could supplicate the god, namely that they could ask for their own 
health, that of an individual, but also for the health of an entire unit. There is no 
tension here between secular and sacred healing and these inscriptions should be 
taken as evidence that doctors and the gods worked side by side. This very lack of 
tension between groups would make worship of the gods within military camps and 
hospitals possible as they would not have been excluded from these places by 
physicians jealously guarding their healing prerogatives. The inscriptions dedicated 
by medici are not uniform in nature at all but follow the dedicators own preferences 
in terms of physical appearance and inscribed text, with some being very succinct 
and others providing far more details (Fig. 60):  
Aesculapio et Hygi/ae Aug(ustis) sacrum / T(itus) Venusius T(iti) f(ilius) Mene(nia)

729 AE 1937 181: Sacred to Asclepius Augustus and Hygeia Augusta, Titus Venusius son of Titus 
Aper, tribe Menenia, head of the valetudinarium at Praeneste happily, freely and deservedly fulfilled 
his vow and placed it on 27th September. 
Fig. 60: AE 1937 181. 
This inscription is remarkable for a number of reasons. First, it mentions that the 
dedicator, Titus Venusius, was the head of the valetudinarium at Praeneste.730 
Secondly, the inscription was set up in Aquincum in Pannonia but the dedicator held 
his position in Praeneste. This is a good example of the increased mobility which 
was a result of the creation of a permanent army and units of medical personnel 
which moved around the empire, further examples of which will be shown below. 
Titus Venusius does not mention which legion he belonged to so it is not possible to 
730 It is known that these structures definitely existed as valetudinaria are mentioned in a number of 
ancient texts and there are archaeological traces as well, for example see CIL 3.14537, 6.175, 8.8099, 
13.8099; AE 1987 951; Pseudo-Hyginus Liber de Munitionibus Castrorum; SHA Hadr. 10.6; SHA 
Alex. Sev. 47.2; Tac. Hist. 2.45. However, there has been some recent debate as to whether 
valetudinaria actually existed as the structures we believe them to be, with Baker (2002) 74 arguing 
that these structures are not hospitals but were more likely to be storage rooms, fabrica, and that the 
original excavators based their interpretations on the 19th and 20th century ideal of a hospital. She 
also notes that while ancient texts do comment on the existence of valetudinaria, none of them give 
an actual description of the layout of this structure. She also comments on the fact that during 
excavation little attention was generally paid to the find-spot of any medical equipment which was 
found on site. However, the hospital at Neuss was well-documented and instruments were found in 
the valetudinarium but also in other areas. She then states that it was possible that these medical 
instruments did not in fact have a medical use. Baker (2013) 122-4 argues that a lot of the small finds 
found in situ do not point towards a hospital: lamps, animal bones and tableware could suggest a 
domestic space. However, even the sick needed to eat and see so this seems not to be a likely 
explanation for this, especially as Room 48 of the building contained broken probes and physicians 
boxes.  On the basis of the literary evidence she admits to the existence of military hospitals but is just 
arguing against current identifications. However, it is now generally still accepted that these structures 
were military hospitals for a number of reasons, as listed by Knzl (2005) 59, namely firstly horrea 
and fabrica are archaeologically easily recognisable and the structures believed to be valetudinaria do 
not resemble these and are also too big to be scholae. Secondly, one of the literary sources, Pseudo-
Hyginus Liber de Munitionibus Castrorum 4, states that a legion had a valetudinarium next to the 
veternarium which could be found among the courtyard rooms. Israelowitz (2015) 100 does believe in 
the existence of these structures and states that Bakers arguments are focused solely on the physical 
shape of the valetudinarium and not their existence. He also argues that the hospital at Haltern was the 
oldest as it is possible to date it to between 7-5 BC and AD 9: Israelowitz (2015) 102. 
state with certainty whether he moved to Pannonia with his legion, or more likely, 
that he was transferred from one legion to another. Ordinary soldiers could expect to 
stay with one legion and possibly in one geographical area for their whole lives, but 
officers had a far greater mobility and could expect to move between legions (see 
section 1.1.8). The head of the valetudinarium would have had a rank equivalent to 
that of an officer so increased mobility among these men could also be expected (see 
above). It may be possible that Titus also held the post of head of the hospital in 
Aquincum but there is no evidence for this. The valetudinarium in Aquincum 
seemingly had a cult room of Asclepius and Hygeia where cult is visible from the 
time of Trajan. Another similar room was found in the hospital at Vindobona and 
there is also evidence for cult at Novae (see below). An altar to Asclepius dedicated 
by an Iulius Iulianus was found near the valetudinarium and statues of Asclepius 
were also found here.731 Kdr argues that it is likely that Asclepius had multiple 
sanctuaries in Pannonia but none was found.732 
4.2.1 Camp Medicine 
There has been some debate whether military camps had specialised medical 
facilities called valetudinaria, ancient hospitals.733 The inscriptions mentioning these 
infirmaries are only found in the imperial period, which could either coincide with 
Augustan reforms to the army health corps or could just be a result of changes in the 
epigraphic habit. The hospital at Neuss, Novaesium, was the first one to be 
731 AE 1937 182. 
732 Kdr (1989) 1059; he states that it is remarkable that the cult was concentrated along the Amber 
Route and also along the limes. 
733 See above note 717. The word valetudinarium is also found in civilian context and must just mean 
a place for sick people: Knzl (2005) 56. The word is not used to indicate a public civilian hospital 
before the 4th century AD but is found indicating a private house for the sick from about AD 100: 
Nutton (2005) 523. Infirmaries were found on the estates of wealthy Romans from about the 1st 
century BC onwards, see Celsus, Med. prooemium 65, but they vanish here around AD 100, possibly 
as a result of the prices of slaves: Nutton (2005) 524. 
discovered but the one in the Teutoburger Wald is the oldest known, dating to AD 
9.734 They are generally thought to have consisted of two rectangular hallways with a 
courtyard in the middle (See Fig. 61).735 
Fig. 61: Plan of the hospital at Vetera I. 
A number of inscriptions were found dedicated to Asclepius in and around the site of 
the alleged valetudinarium at Novae, which would indicate the existence of a 
sacellum in the hospital, just as at Vindobona (see above). The presence of a cult of 
Asclepius in the sacellum at the valetudinarium at Novae shows that the cult of the 
god had been introduced into a new context for worship. These military hospitals 
were created as part of the new medical corps; within this new secular context, 
sacred space was demarcated for the worship of the god, illustrating the connections 
and cooperation between sacred and secular healthcare. Worship of the god in this 
new context illustrates the impact of Empire on the cult, where existing practices 
were adapted to suit the reality of Empire. The Empire and its provinces necessitated

735 Baker (2002) 71. 
the foundation of a permanent army, both for future conquests and for the 
preservation of peace in existing provinces. This is turn caused the creation of a 
medical corps dedicated to the wellbeing of its soldiers. Historically, physicians had 
a strong relationship with Asclepius (see section 3.1), which makes it unsurprising to 
find military doctors also worshipping the god. This prior relationship was then 
incorporated within the structure of the army and the new buildings, which were 
constructed as a result of it. Military worship of Asclepius, therefore, brought cult to 
new contexts but also built upon and adapted existing relationships with the god. 
A dedicatory inscription was found here which formed part of an architrave 
inscription and is concerned with the foundation of a temple or shrine to Hygeia and 
Asclepius by the legatus Augusti pro praetore Titus Vitrasius Pollio, which can be 
dated to around AD 157 (Fig. 62):736

This is significant because it is a building inscription which indicates that the legion 
went to the effort to dedicate a temple on site and the cult here did, therefore, not just

consist of an altar where offerings could be made but was more elaborate. The very 
fragmentary inscription is linked to the cult of Asclepius and the inscription is set up by 
the imperial legate making the connection with the legio I Italica very probable. The 
corpus editors state that there is no doubt about Asclepius reconstructed name here 
because of the presence of Hygeias name and she generally did not receive cult by 
herself.738 The inscription indicates that there was either a temple somewhere in Novae 
close to the fort or that there was a sacellum inside the valetudinarium.739 Vitrasius 
Pollio is known to have made another dedication to Asclepius and Hygeia in Varna: 
Aesculapio et / [Hy]giae T(itus) Vitra/sius Pollio co(n)s(ul) pon/tifex, proco(n)sul 
[Asiae]/leg(atus) Aug(usti) pr(o) pr(aetore) e[x voto posuit].740  
If the reconstructed dedicatory inscription from the architrave is indeed correct, the 
temple can be dated to AD 156-9 when Titus Pomponius Proculus Vitrasius Pollio 
was legate of the province and would mean that the dedication of the shrine would 
coincide with the Marcomannic wars and the Antonine plague.741 Due to the timing 
of when these inscriptions were erected and when the provincial expansion took 
place, it is possible that the increased interest in the cult coincided with the Antonine 
Plague.742 However, the extent to which this plague truly had such devastating 
effects, as has been claimed in primary sources, both contemporary and later, has 
now been called into question.743 Jerome states that the nearly 10,000 people died at 
Rome alone, the plague was that severe.744 Bruun has conducted an investigation into 
the source material and methodology used by scholars to make these claims and has

shown them to be faulty.745 He argues that while there was definitely an epidemic, no 
one knows how bad it really was and its impact. Duncan-Jones states that it was a 
literary trope to call each plague the worst ever.746 The existence of the plague is not 
in doubt, just its extent. It should, therefore, not be taken as a definite reason for why 
soldiers at this time erected a dedication to Asclepius and, in fact, its presence in the 
Balkan provinces cannot be definitely concluded.747 
The connection with the legio I Italica seems very likely here, which would 
mean that the cult was linked to the military from the start. Another inscription (Fig. 
63) from the site links it conclusively to the military, as it is a collective dedication 
set up from the legion to the god. In cases like this, where there is a joint dedication 
from the whole legion, a commander generally erected such a dedication on behalf of 
the whole unit or legion:

Asclepius was worshipped here for the health and safety of the entire legion. This 
type of collective dedication also occurs, for example, in the Asclepieion in

The valetudinarium at Novae was built in the Trajanic period and was located 
in the north-west area of the praetenatura of the fortress of the I Italica.749 It was 
located on top of another structure, probably a bathing complex, which dated to 
Vespasians time and the sacellum is located directly in line with the main entrance 
to the hospital.750 The hospitals plan is similar to those of the valetudinaria 
mentioned above (Fig. 64): 
Fig. 64: Plan of the valetudinarium at Novae. 
This hospital is one of the largest excavated, with only those at Bonn and Lotschitz 
being bigger.751 A small building was discovered here in 1985 which was unearthed 
completely in 1992 and it seems that this structure had been deliberately demolished 
to make place for a villa, the so-called Building of the Porticoes, and had been

abandoned at the same time as the hospital and fort during Caracallas reign at which 
point the locals reused materials.752 Dyczek suggests that it was a small shrine or 
temple to Asclepius which was placed within the camp, something which is 
supported by epigraphic evidence as inscriptions to Asclepius and Hygeia were 
found in three places in the Building with Porticoes.753 One is a dedication of a silver 
statuette of Hygeia made by the legate Marcus Clodius Laetas, which has been dated 
to the 2nd century AD and is possibly connected to the Marcomannic wars:754 
Hygiam / ex donis arg(enti) / p(ondo) IIII unc(iis) VII[3] / M(arcus) Clodius / Laetus 
leg(atus) / Aug(usti) f(aciendum) c(uravit)755 
An inscription to Asclepius was found in Greek:

This inscription was found reused in the walls of the structure built on top of the 
valetudinarium and is dated to between AD 212 and 230. As one of the other 
inscriptions found in the hospital was by a physician it has been suggested, 
especially given the fact that this inscription was set up in Greek, that Aurelius 
Diodorus was also a physician.757 
Another dedication was erected to Asclepius Saorus:

The editors for LAnne Epigraphique state that that there is no clear explanation for 
this epithet. They state that it could possibly be an unknown toponymic epithet or 
that it could be a Latinised version of the name of the son of Horus which was 
Saor.759 There is another explanation from Pausanias, who mentions that there was a 
shrine to Asclepius in Arcadia 40 stades from Saurus.760 These inscriptions were all 
found close to the building. All of the inscriptions from this site are dated to the 2nd 
half of the 2nd century and the early 3rd century.  
In total there were ten dedications to healing deities from this area and only 
two to other gods. The inscriptions to Asclepius and Hygeia were placed in the 
sacellum or within ten meters of it, while the other inscriptions were dotted around 
the courtyard. Of the thirteen objects found on the site, eight are bases, four altars (of 
which one uninscribed) and three votive slabs. Of the inscriptions, one was dedicated 
by the legion as a whole, two by legates, and one each by a primus pilus, centurion, 
veteran, medicus and hastatus:  
[A]esculapium / ex donis arg(enteum) / p(ondo) V unc(iis) V / C(aius) Mansuanius / 
Severus leg(atus) Aug(usti) f(aciendum) c(uravit)761  
It is noteworthy here that both this inscription and that to Hygeia (see above) place 
so much emphasis on the weight and value of the object as this rarely occurs within 
an Asclepieian context, with the most notable exception being the Athenian 
758 AE 1998, 1133: To Asclepius Saorus, Lucius Appius ..ani tesserarius of the I Italic legion gave as

Asclepieion inventories. It is possible that this could be a trend, the epigraphic habit, 
at the time of dedication as inscriptions dating to the AD 200s from Ostia similarly 
mention the weight and value of the dedication.762 
Thus, there is definite evidence for a cult of Asclepius and Hygeia within the 
site of the army camp at Novae. The close proximity of these inscriptions and their 
content link the cult to the army here. It has also been convincingly argued that the 
location in which the shrine was located was a military hospital, a valetudinarium. 
For Knzl the existence of the sacellum in the valetudinarium at Novae also proves 
the existence of valetudinaria.763 It would make sense for a specially demarcated 
area to have been dedicated to healing the sick to prevent contamination but also to 
promote healing.  
This section has aimed to show the various ways in which the Roman army 
dedicated to and worshipped Asclepius. It has firstly shown that there was no 
competition between healing gods and physicians and that in fact the opposite took 
place, with medici supplicating the gods for their own health and for that of others. 
This lack of competition then made it possible for a cult of Asclepius to be located 
within a military camp so that soldiers could worship the god there directly for their 
wellbeing. While there is some discussion about the correct application of the term 
valetudinarium to certain structures, the location of the shrine of Asclepius in certain 
parts of the camp at Novae indicates that this is where it would be most logical to 
have such a military hospital as it would not make sense for wounded soldiers to 
have to cross the camp to worship at an altar a long distance away from where they

were laid up. The location of the valetudinaria was generally in a relatively secluded 
spot away from the healthy soldiers. This could be for a reason not dissimilar to the 
relative isolation of the Tiber Island Asclepieion, namely to prevent cross-
contamination with healthy soldiers, in the case of infectious diseases. There was 
definitely a cult of Asclepius on the site of Novae and from a practical perspective it 
would make sense for this to have taken place in the valetudinarium.  
The military health care system changed under Augustus and it is from this 
period onwards that military doctors are also attested epigraphically. The 
relationship between doctors and Asclepius was already well known in antiquity (see 
section 3.1) but now the cult was spread further across the empire and was 
worshipped in new contexts such as the valetudinarium. The presence of the cult of 
Asclepius and Hygeia on the site of Novae adds to the possibility of identifying this 
structure as a valetudinarium as this section has shown that there was no competition 
between doctors and the god, but rather the opposite took place with doctors 
extensively worshipping the god. The new Augustan health care system led to the 
construction of new buildings concerned solely with the health of the soldiers and 
this became a new context for the god to work. The next section will briefly look at 
the occurrence of vows to Asclepius in military dedications from the Balkan and 
Danube provinces as there are a remarkable number of inscriptions where these are 
mentioned. Notions of identity and how they were portrayed in these inscriptions 
will be examined in this section, a theme which section 4.4 will build upon.   
4.3 Vows 
The process of supplicating a god involved a bargain being struck, the do ut 
des principle. A human would pray to a god and make a sacrifice in order to gain the 
gods attention. Then he would ask the god to fulfil his wish: in the case of Asclepius 
this would most likely be healing of some kind, and then when this was achieved the 
supplicant promised to set up a dedication so that everyone could know that the god 
had been merciful and how powerful the god was that he could have cured the 
supplicant. The length of the contract which was undertaken by making a vow could 
differ vastly and depended on each individual case.764 Fulfilment of vows occurs in 
many of the military inscriptions from the Danube and Balkan regions, such as:  
Aesculapio / et Hygiae / Publ(ius) Ael/i(us) Fronto |(centurio) / leg(ionis) XI Cl(audiae) / 
v(otum) s(olvit)765 
Many of the inscriptions discussed in this chapter were dedicated as the result of a 
vow, far more so than generally occurs in other contexts discussed within this thesis. 
Roman religion placed great importance on vows where in return for divine help or 
benefit a supplicant promised offerings, sacrifices, games, temples, and many other 
things in return. They were quite contractual and while gods were seen to be bound 
just by the taking of the vow, they were only obliged to do exactly as the vow 
stipulated, no more and no less.766 It should also be noted that often a sacrifice 
preceded the erection of an inscription and that this sacrifice was often the actual 
votive offering, which was then followed by a lasting monument for the votive.767 
This public display of the fact that a vow had been fulfilled and a votive given could

then become an object for competition.768 Vows could be made under special 
circumstances or annually depending on the situation. In the context of the cult of 
Asclepius, it was more likely to have been the former reason:  
Aesculapio et Hy/giae M(arcus) Ulpius Ho/noratus dec(urio) / eq(uitum) 
sing(ularium) Imp(eratoris) n(ostri) / pro salute sua / suorumque et / L(uci) Iuli 
Helicis me/dici qui curam / mei diligenter egit / secundum deos / v(otum) s(olvi) 
l(ibenter) l(ibens) m(erito)769 
The inscription was set up by a decurion on behalf of a medicus who, together with 
Asclepius and Hygeia, cured him from either an illness or a wound, the inscription 
does not specify which. The VSLLM shows that the Decurion was healed.  
It has been suggested that the use of the formula VSLM suggested that the 
vow became mechanical and was not understood by its users.770 However, Scheid 
does not believe this and points out that study of trilingual inscriptions shows 
otherwise, as the dedicators chose not to translate the formula into Aramaic as it only 
occurs within the Greek and Latin text, indicating that this kind of contract was not 
deemed suitable for these native gods.771  The Roman vow had specific vocabulary 
and phrases which would make it unsuitable for use in a non Graeco-Roman divine 
context. The remarkably frequent occurrence of the formula here then might indicate 
the highly Roman nature of the context in the dedications which were set up. The 
army was a very Roman institution and that was reflected in these dedications. This 
will also be shown in the next section where Thracian praetorians went to great 
768 Derks (1998) 231: this was due to the size or material of the votive.

inscription is dated to around AD 153 on the basis of another dedication set up by Honoratus: AE

lengths to portray themselves as Roman as possible while still keeping Thracian 
dedicatory elements. This inscription shows dialogues in religion between Rome and 
the provinces, which were possible via movement across the Empire.  
A superficially less Roman cult was that of the Thracian Rider which 
originated in Thrace but had important connections with the military and Asclepius 
and will be examined next.  
4.4 The Thracian Rider 
Fig. 65: Map of the area of Philippopolis. 
Fig. 66: The Thracian Rider, IGBulg 5.5806. 
The Thracian Rider was one of the most important gods in Thrace. Both 
Apollo and Asclepius were identified with this god (Fig. 66); the earliest of the 
dedications to the Rider are dated to the Hellenistic period, but most come from the 
Roman era.772 In the south-eastern area of modern Bulgaria the Rider is mainly 
assimilated with Apollo but in the western Philippopolitan area the Rider is twinned 
more often with Asclepius.773 In the area controlled by Philippopolis (Fig. 65), the 
sanctuary at Batkun was the most important and about 250 reliefs and statues were 
found in this area.774 The rider is commonly depicted as Asclepius and bears the 
epithet Zimidrenus, or a variation of this name.775 An inscription from Rome set up 
by Thracian members of the praetorian cohorts to Asclepius Zimidrenus (discussed 
below) will illustrate the impact of Empire on the cult via increased mobility which 
772 Dimitrova (2002) 210. The type is called the Thracian rider as some 2,000 reliefs were found from 
about 350 locations in Thrace. Circa one-third of these are inscribed, mostly very simply. Of this 
third, two-thirds are votive in nature and the last third is funerary. Apart from Asclepius and Apollo, 
Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Ailvanus, Hades, Hephaistos, and the Dioskouroi were also represented in 
this type. 
773 Oppermann (2005) 351. 
774 Most inscriptions here are to the god plus an epithet and dedications to just Asclepius are in the 
minority. There are also many dedications to Asclepius Kurios, or a combination of Kurios and 
Zimidrenus, namely: IGBulg 3.1118; 1122; 1132; 1145; 1157; 1159; 1167; 1171; 1175; 1180-1; 1188-
9; 1203; 1223-5; 1227-8; 1232-3; 1236-43; 1246; 1249 (?); 1257; 1259; 1264-5; 1268-70; 1281. 
Kurios is a typical Thracian epithet and commonly occurs on votive plaques: Boteva (2011) 86. 
775 Oppermann (2005) 351. 
resulted from the creation of a permanent army. This cult is generally not directly 
associated with the army in Thrace though there are also dedications erected by 
soldiers. However, in order to understand fully the differing nature of these 
inscriptions, the cult in Thrace, its nature and dedicatory habits must be fully 
understood and will, therefore, be discussed first. 
 Inscriptions in Thrace were mainly set up by people of local origin and at the 
sanctuary in Glava Panega in Moesia twenty-one of the statues were of Asclepius 
alone or with Hygeia or Telesphorus in the Classical style but forty-one were in the 
style of the Thracian rider. At the sanctuary at Batkun 95% of the statuary of 
Asclepius was in the guise of the Thracian rider.776 This was a new religious creation 
and a response to the penetration of Hellenic culture in the area. Dimitrova argues 
that the Rider was an advanced sign of religious syncretism as it merged with every 
Greek, Roman, Thracian, and Eastern god it came across.777 There was a joint 
sanctuary of Asclepius and the Rider at Dolna Dikanja.778 In the territory belonging 
to Philippopolis, the city from which the praetorian dedicators to Asclepius 
Zimidrenus in Rome came (see below), there were five sanctuaries of both the 
Thracian Rider and Asclepius, namely Malko Belovo, Malo Konare, Novosel, 
Pastua, and Perustica.779 Boteva states that there are fifty-two dedications in total to 
the Rider which are known to have been made by soldiers, most of which come from 
the area between the Danube and the Haemus mountain range.780 Of these, seven 
were dedicated to Asclepius, all in Greek, and were erected by soldiers holding a

variety of military posts, namely one equestrian, two beneficarii, one praetorian, two 
soldiers, and one unknown post.781  
Recent excavations and discoveries have shown that Asclepius was 
worshipped all across Thrace, often together with Hygeia and Telesphorus. All the 
cult evidence for the forty-four sites in Thrace dates from the Roman period. There 
seems to have been another sanctuary of Asclepius Keilaidenos in Pernik, where 122 
votives to the Thracian Rider have been found and twenty-two to Asclepius, Hygeia, 
and Telemachos.782 Near Dorf Varvara there was a sanctuary of Asclepius Heros, 
who could also have been Asclepius Zimidrenus/Zydenos.783 One inscription here 
was set up by a soldier called Aurelius Moukatralis: 
()    
.
The inscription is simple and was dedicated in Greek, indicating that the dedicator 
could have been of local origin as, even though Latin was the dominant language 
along the Danube, only Greek occurs in Thrace and in the area belonging to 
Hellenistic Macedonia.785 With the widespread recruitment of Thracians into the 
Roman army, a local origin is even more likely.786 It is remarkable that Asclepius 
was worshipped under so many epithets in Thrace, which were likely the names of 
local gods such as Zimdrenus, Koulkoussenos, and Zudeono.787 The best preserved 
sanctuary is the one at Pernik but all seem to have a similar architecture which is

Greek and seem to have mainly a civilian nature, as for example at Batkun no 
military ranks or offices are mentioned. There are two inscriptions (Figs 67-69)

Mihailov also points out that the word Leistologein is a novelty for the Greek lexicon 
and may be an abbreviated term with leistai which would indicate an administrative 
position in the army.791 The editor again points to a connection with the 
Marcomannic wars and the Antonine plague here, which coincide with the date of 
dedication and which could have prompted a boost in dedications, not just by 
soldiers but also by civilians. 
The Rider was not just worshipped in Thrace but was also supplicated in 
Moesia and there was an important cult site at Glava Panega. A shrine of Asclepius 
occurred near a spring here. A number of unique epithets occur in this cult, namely 
 and  which correspond to the Latin Saldaecaputenus and 
Saltecaputenus, which also occur in the cults of Silvanus and Heros here.792 These

epithets are very different from the ones discussed before (see section 2.3). A 
number of offerings were dedicated here by soldiers (Figs. 70-71):

The formulae used in these inscriptions are very simple and generally only state the 
fact that these men were strategoi but do not give their rank or any further hints as to 
their status. No collective dedications occur here, only individual ones. With a 
number of the inscriptions, the text itself only refers to the epithet, or is damaged and 
does not lend itself to identification of the deity in question. However, the IGBulg 
volumes also include extensive photo plates and examination of the iconography of 
these dedications leaves no doubt that there were set up to Asclepius as they show 
the god holding his snake-staff, depicted in his traditional iconographic pose,

accompanied by Hygeia.796 The second inscription also uses a particular Pergamene 
iconography as it shows an orb.797 Text and image here work hand in hand to convey 
which god was dedicated to here. 
The dedications to the Rider and Asclepius in Thrace and Moesia are very 
different in nature from those in the other provinces discussed in this chapter. First of 
all they were set up in Greek and are concerned solely with individuals who are 
dedicating on their own behalf. In the Latin inscriptions, these were either set up by 
individuals for themselves or for others, and collective dedications also occur. There 
was, thus, a lot more variety and differentiation within the Latin inscriptions. The 
dedicants are also less likely to give their military rank in the Greek inscriptions 
where only ordinatus and strategos seem to appear. This was in contrast to the wide 
range of military ranks found in the Latin dedications which range from miles to 
legate. However, the god worshipped in Thrace seems to have been, for the most 
part, the syncretic god Asclepius Zimidrenus who clearly differed in nature from the 
straightforward Asclepius, something which will be examined in greater detail in 
Chapter 5. Another difference between the cult in Thrace and that of the other 
provinces was that it is likely that the majority if not all of the supplicants were 
auxiliaries due to the fact that no legions were stationed in Thrace (see section 4.1.2).  
In Rome a number of dedications were erected by members of the praetorian 
and urban cohorts to Asclepius. Renberg points out that a relatively sizeable portion 
of the extant inscriptions to Asclepius from Rome, at least those which can be 
ascribed to the god with some certainty, were set up by members of the military and 
that while some of these dedications were placed in the temples to the god which 
796 See section 2.4. 
797 See section 3.3.2.  
were located in the city, most actually were dedicated in shrines located within 
military camps and stations which were scattered around Rome, or in valetudinaria 
in forts in the provinces.798 One of the most remarkable dedications in Rome was to 
the syncretic god Asclepius Zimidrenus which was erected by Thracian members of 
the cohors I praetoria (Fig. 72): 
Fig. 72: CIL 6.2799. 
798 Renberg (2006/7) 115-6. In his catalogue he lists 41 dedications which he believes come from 
various sites in Rome and of these nine were set up by soldiers.

In contrast to all the other inscriptions found to this god in Thrace, this dedication 
used Latin and not Greek as the dedicating language. Even the physical layout of the 
inscription differs greatly from the inscriptions back in Thrace where they are often 
found with a relief depicting either the Thracian Rider or some combination of the 
triad of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Telesphorus (see Figs. 73-74). Here, there is only the 
Latin text.  
Apart from the name of the god and those of the dedicators together with 
their places of origin, there is little to link this inscription to the Thracian dedications 
to the god. However, these Thracian elements must have been considered very 
important to the dedicators as they went to great care to mention the place and also 
the vici where they came from. The Digest states that all inhabitants of a vicus should 
be registered in their civitas. Some extramural settlements attached to a fort, but not 
all, were deemed to be vici.800  
It is also very remarkable that seemingly most military dedications to 
Asclepius in Thrace were set up by individuals who only made a generic reference to 
the fact that they were soldiers, something which also occurs in the Thracian-
influenced dedications set up in Moesia. However, here precisely the opposite has 
occurred. The inscription was set up by a collective group who carefully specify at 
the start of the inscription that they are praetorians. In fact, larger letters were used at 
the top of the inscription to draw attention to the fact that this inscription was set up 
in honour of the imperial household, that it was to Asclepius Zimidrenus, and that 
vicus Stairesis. Marcus Aurelius son of Marcus, [from the tribe] Flavia, Ota[]is, of Philippopolis, 
vicus Stairesis. Centuria Augustus Marcus Aurelius son of Marcus, [from the tribe] Flavia, Bithus, of 
Philippopolis, vicus Diiesure. From the centuria of Quintianus, Marcus Aurelius son of Marcus, [from 
the tribe] Flavia, Mucianus, of Philippopolis, vicus Lisenon, set this up on 26th of June. When Albinus 
and Maximus were consuls. Salway (1994) 134 dates this inscription to June 227.  See aso Tsontchev 
(1941) 11-12. 
800 Dig. 50.1.30 
the dedicators were members of the first praetorian cohort who were all originally 
from Philippopolis.  
The nature of the inscription as well as its physical form differs, thus, greatly 
from the inscriptions to Asclepius Zimidrenus in Thrace. It is also interesting that 
while the praetorians were keen to include their Thracian origins by listing both the 
city where they came from as well as all the vici, they also clearly showcased their 
Roman citizenship by citing their names, which are all Marcus Aurelius bar one, and 
by listing them underneath each other, drawing attention to the universal citizenship 
grant under Caracalla. Salway has noted that in the eastern empire Aurelius is the 
most common nomen while in the west this was Iulius, though Aurelius is a close 
second.801 The text is so uniform that all the separate cohesive elements occur 
underneath each other in the inscription. The word Flavia is included with every 
name in this inscription. It is located in the place where normally the voting tribe 
would be found. However, there was no tribe Flavia in Rome. This is apparently a 
fictitious voting-tribe and Salway states that such tribes are found widespread across 
praetorians who were recruited from the Danubian provinces after AD 212.802 He 
further notes that in the east, away from Latin models, people often kept their native 
patronymics which were placed at the end of the name but still added Aurelius 
before their given name, following Latin fashion.803 This must also be the case here 
as every occurrence of a name is also followed by a Thracian name, for example the 
first listed name: M(arcus) Aur(elius) M(arci) f(ilius) Fl(avia) Diza Philippopoli 
801 Salway (1994) 134. 
802 Salway (1994) 134. He also mentions the existence of Aelia, Aurelia, Antonia, Augusta, Iulia, 
Septimia, and Ulpia as other fictitious voting tribes: Salway (1994) 134n60; CIL 6.2832, 2833; EE 
4.891-5. There were thirty-five tribes in Rome and their purpose was to organize the citizen-body for 
the purpose of voting in the assembly. Every male citizen belonged to such a tribe and it was a part of 
their formal name: Rives (1995) 22. During the imperial period the tribe no longer had any practical 
significance but was still retained as a part of a Romans name. Its use here, therefore, served no 
practical purpose and must solely have been assumed by the Thracians to appear more Roman.  
803 Salway (1994) 134. 
vico Cuntiegerum. This inscription, thus, stands out from others as it differs greatly 
in physical form from dedications to Asclepius Zimidrenus which were found in 
Moesia and Thrace. It is also unique as such an effort was made to present the 
inscription in a very Roman style, including the use of Latin, but still local Thracian 
elements occur throughout. The fake voting tribes indicate a desire to be Roman and 
also to be perceived as Roman and fit in with a general trend followed by praetorian 
soldiers from the Danube lands. This inscription, therefore, illustrates both the global 
and regional cult of Asclepius as it shows a local response to the fact that the 
dedicators have come into contact with the Empire, a changed situation as a result of 
the universal citizenship law, and had to decide how they would respond to this (see 
Whitmarsh in section 1.1.2). The soldiers did so in a way in which they appeared 
Roman superficially but kept strong local elements through names and places of 
origin but also by worshipping their regional version of the god, who is not found 
anywhere else outside of Moesia and Thrace apart from in Rome, and not the 
standardised Roman version. This choosing of one version of a god over another will 
be explored in greater detail in Chapter 5.  
Another inscription to the same god, though with a slightly different spelling 
of the gods name, namely Sindrinus, was found in two fragments, both west of the 
Castra Praetoria in Rome and likely originated from the same place as the previous 
inscription to Asclepius Zimidrenus804: 
804 Three more inscriptions to Asclepius were found in Rome which can be linked to the military and 
have rough find spots, namely CIL 6.20, 370 from near the Castra Praetoria and CIL 6.13 from 
Trastevere, possibly near the Castra Ravennatium. One was set up by a medicus for the wellbeing of 
his fellow soldiers: CIL 6.20: Asclepio et / Saluti / commilitonum / Sex(tus) Titius Alexander / medicus 
c(o)ho(rtis) V pr(aetoriae) / donum dedit / [Imp(eratore) Domitiano] / Aug(usto) VIII / T(ito) Flavio 
Sabino co(n)s(ulibus): To Asclepius and Salus, Sextus Titius Alexander, medicus of the V pratorian 
cohort gave as a gift of his fellow soldiers, when the emperor Domitian Augustus was consul for the 
VIII time and Titus Flavius Sabinus was consul. CIL 6.2, 9, 14 are also military inscriptions which 
were found in Rome but no find spot for these has been recorded.

The city of Philippopolis was located in an area where votives to the Thracian rider 
were especially numerous.806 The inscription from Rome explicitly mentions the 
region of Sindrina, connecting worship with the sanctuary in Thrace, just as the 
previous inscription took great care to do with the city of Philippopolis. The epithet 
does not seem to occur anywhere else other than in Thrace and in Rome.  
In the above inscription, Asclepius is dedicated to by Thracian members of 
the cohors X praetoria and praetorians actually formed the largest military body 
dedicating to Asclepius in Rome as can also be seen from CIL 6.2799 (see above). 
Here again there is a combination of Roman and Thracian elements which can be 
taken as local people reacting to a new reality of Empire.  
This is of vital importance as these inscriptions show that religious mobility 
was a multi-directional phenomenon and that this did not just occur from Rome to 
the provinces but also vice versa. Global and regional cult identities worked together 
and these elements could travel both ways, showing that old ideas that centre and 
periphery were a one-way cultural exchange are outdated: Rome and the provinces 
were instead part of a highly dynamic religious mobile web. This fits what was 
argued in Chapter 1, section 1.1.1, following Nedereen Pieterse, where the Roman 
805 CIL 6.30685+16: To the numen of the sacred god Asclepius and Sindrina Regina, of 
Philippopolis, Aurelius Mucianus priest, soldier of the X praetorian cohort, Pious Defender Gordian, 
member of the Severan centuria, fulfilled the vow he had undertaken with his fellow citizens and 
fellow soldiers on the 11th of May when the Emperor Gordian Augustus II and Pompeianus were 
consuls.  
806 It was originally a Thracian settlement which was conquered by Philip II of Macedon and 
subsequently renamed. All the evidence for Asclepieian cult is dated to the Roman period, among 
which there was a relief, statue fragment, and a dedication to Asclepius and the Thracian Rider: 
IGBulg 3.967. 
Empire was globalised by globalising and that the Romans brought their culture, 
along with that of other peripheries, to the newly conquered regions.807 This meant 
that there was a constant exchange of cultures between Rome and the provinces, 
which was a dynamic and multi-directional process. This cross-provincial mobility 
also appears in different military contexts in the cult of Asclepius and will be 
discussed further in the next section. 
4.5 Religious Mobility 
With the case of Asclepius Zimidrenus there, thus, seems to have been a 
multi-directional religious mobility where cultic elements were not just transferred to 
the provinces from Rome but also from the provinces to Rome, something which 
was also shown in Chapter 3 with the Pergamene orb iconography. The concept of 
mobility in the cult of Asclepius will be examined further here.  
In Dacia, Asclepius is frequently found worshipped in conjunction with other 
gods. Many people, including soldiers, often supplicated as many gods as they could 
at the same time, covering all of their bases, to ensure that they had the best divine 
protection from all the deities they could get to keep them safe. An example of this 
comes from Apulum where only a temple to Liber Pater and one to Mithras have 
been identified but there is some evidence of other cults, including that of Asclepius 
(Fig. 73):808

Asclepius, Diana, Apollo, Hercules, Spes, Favor, Publius Catius Sabinus military tribune of the legion 
XIII Gemina freely fulfilled his vow. The Lares Viales were the Lares of the roads and the 
commentators state that the inscription is remarkable for mentioning an enlarged family as normally 
only the nuclear family is listed. 
810 CIL 3.987: To Asclepius and Hygeia and to the other salubrious gods and goddesses of this place, 
Gaius Julius Frontonianus veteran, from the beneficiarii of the consul, of the legio V Macedonica Pia, 
the light having been restored to him and thanking [the god], out of a vision, on behalf of himself and 
his wife Carteia Maxima and daughter Julia Frontina, freely and gladly fulfilled his vow. It is 
possible that as this inscription refers to a return of light that the healing sought and gained here was a 
return of sight. 
811 CIL 3.993: To Caelestis Augusta and Asclepius Augustus and the Carthaginian Genius and the 
Dacian Genius, Olus Terentius Pudens Uttedianus, Augustan legate, of the XIII legion Gemina, 
Augustan propraetorian legate of the province of Raetia [set this up]. The dedication was set up in 
Apulum. 
Fig. 74: CIL 3.993. 
The genii were some of the most important military cults (see section 4.1.2) and the 
connection between Carthage and Dacia is also interesting as there was an important 
cult of Eshmun and Caelestis in Carthage. Eshmun was twinned with Asclepius and 
the pairing here could be as a result of that as Asclepius was worshipped extensively 
in North Africa by the army.812 In Africa Asclepius appears to have been twinned 
with Eshmun who was sometimes worshipped in conjunction with Caelestis (see 
section 5.3.3) which could explain the presence of the goddess here. The main 
African cult centre of Eshmun was in Carthage which could clarify the presence of 
the Genius of Carthage here (see Chapter 5 for more detail). However, it is not clear 
why the genii of Carthage and Dacia would be twinned here as the legion to which 
the dedicator belonged was never stationed anywhere near Africa. It would appear 
that the connection between the two genii only makes sense if examined from an 
Asclepieian context where the place where the dedication was erected was in Dacia 
812 Cadotte (2006) 170, n.30. 
yet there are elements which were specific to the cult in Africa. It is possible that the 
dedicator, Olus Terentius Pudens Uttedianus, was of African origin.813 If this was the 
case then, like with the Thracians and Asclepius Zimidrenus, Terentius took 
elements of his local version of the god with him to the new place where he was 
stationed, namely Apulum, and combined elements of his local god with the god 
which he found there. It seems that these strongly regional dedications, which take a 
different shape depending on where they are dedicated, (as in the case of the 
Thracian Rider dedications in both Thrace and Rome), were a result of the increased 
connectivity of the Empire where cultic elements were linked across provinces as a 
result of individual dedicators. The form of these inscriptions varies from the 
Thracian inscriptions as here religious connectivity is achieved through other related 
gods and deities and not directly through syncretism, although this also plays an 
important part. 
Many Germanic gods such as Apollo Grannus and Sirona, Mercury and 
Rosmerta, Mars Camulus, Hercules Magusanus, and the Matronae were also found 
in Dacia. Migration was an important factor in this and Schfer argues that it was 
soldiers who originated from the Rhineland but who were stationed in Dacia who 
were responsible for the introduction of these cults.814 Immigration to Dacia was 
fostered post-conquest and many immigrants placed a high importance on their place 
of origin. A relevant inscription comes from the camp of the legio XIII Gemina in 
Apulum (Fig. 75): 
813 Condurachi (1975) 190; Rives (1995) 70. Olus would be Aulus. 
814 Schfer (2001) 259, 261, 268. 
Glyconi / M(arcus) Ant(onius) / Onesas / iusso dei / l(ibens) p(osuit)815 
Fig. 75: CIL 3.1021. 
The god is mentioned in another inscription, now lost.816 Both these dedicators have 
Greek cognomina and were likely from Asia Minor.817 Glykon here shows one of the 
clearest examples of the impact of the Roman army on the cult of Asclepius, namely 
cross-provincial contacts, just as the inscription concerning the genii does. The cult 
of Glykon was established in Abonoteichos in Paphlagonia in the middle of the 2nd 
AD by the prophet Alexander. The god was depicted as a snake with an 
anthropomorphic head, who was worshipped as an epiphany of Asclepius together 
with Apollo and was called neos Asklepios Glykon. The cult suffers from a lack of 
literary sources as the only extant one, Lucians Alexander or the False Prophet, 
offering a mocking view of the cult, depicting it as vulgar and barbarous, has 
influenced scholarship on the cult, despite it being a serious and real cult. Lucians 
815 CIL 3.1021. To Glykon, Marcus Antonius Onesas, by command of the god, freely placed this.

817 Schfer (2004) 183. 
work aims to ridicule epiphany and pilgrimage and the cult of Glykon bore the brunt 
of that.818 Officers were highly mobile and while soldiers in the lower ranks might 
expect to serve with the same cohort for their entire military career and to belong to 
the same unit for that whole period, officers were often transferred and moved across 
the empire.819 This inscription, CIL 3.1021, shows how mobility affects a cult of 
Asclepius with an ex-procurator from Cilicia dedicating to Asclepius in Germania 
Inferior and Onesas dedicating to Glykon(-Asclepius) in Dacia. These men were 
highly mobile and moved across the empire, taking their gods with them but also 
adhering to regional religious practices in their new place of residence or work.  
This connectivity is also shown by locational epithets where the god in one 
place is given the name place of another as an epithet such as this inscription from 
Sarmizegetusa Ulpica in Dacia which refers to Asclepius Pergamenos: 
Aesculapio Pergam(eno) / et Hygiae / sacrum / C(aius) Spedius Hermias / flamen 
col(oniae) Sarm(izegetusae) / pos(uit).820 
This in itself is remarkable, as locational epithets such as these, and others like 
Apollo Didymeus or Klaros, did not spread far from their primary sanctuary in 
general.821 These were the earliest and commonest epithets given to deities but 
Asclepius does not seem to have had many of these in inscriptions, although some do 
occur in Pausanias (see section 2.3).822 Another example of adherence to a god from 
another location occurs in an inscription from Bad Gotesburg (Fig. 76):

The dedicator used to be propraetorian legate for the province of Cilicia where 
sixteen cult sites of Asclepius were known, the most of important of which was at 
Aigeai.824 Caracalla visited the sanctuary there after his worship of Asclepius at 
Pergamum and Severus Alexander and Valerian were also depicted as supplicating 
Asclepius here (see Section 3.4.5). It is possible that the dedicator had come into 
contact with the cult there and then continued to worship the god despite moving 
across the empire.  
4.6 Conclusion 
 This chapter has aimed to show the impact of the Roman army on the cult of 
Asclepius, especially in the Balkan and Danube provinces of Pannonia, Moesia, 
823 CIL 13.7994 from Bad Godesburg in Germania Inferior. To the Salutares Fortunes, Asclepius and 
Hygeia, Quintus Venidius Rufus Marius Maximus Lucius Calvinianus legate of the legio I Minerva, 
propraetorian Augustan legate of the province Cilicia gave as a gift.

Dacia, and Thrace. This area was chosen as, with the exception of Thrace, no cults of 
Asclepius were known from before the conquest and the god must have been 
introduced by the Romans, possibly the army, here. This region, thus, offers a good 
area to examine the introduction and dissemination of the cult in a previously 
untouched region. This study has uncovered a number of elements which stand out 
and, thus, show the impact of empire on the cult here. Firstly, the small number of 
actual sanctuaries stands out. Although Asclepius was worshipped extensively here 
by a large body of worshippers, relatively few sanctuaries to the god are known.825 
Thrace possibly has the largest number of sanctuaries, where Asclepius was 
commonly twinned with the Thracian Rider.   
 As was pointed out at the start of this chapter, soldiers were keen to worship 
Asclepius in order to keep them safe, in whatever form this might take, and there 
was a military habit of worshipping as many gods as possible at once in order to 
procure as much protection as they could. Regarding the former, it is possible that 
Asclepius was especially worshipped at times of crisis by the military, such as 
during the Antonine Plague and also the Marcomannic Wars, for example at Novae 
and in Thrace. Movement of troops and an increased military presence in the 
provinces embroiled with the wars could also partially explain the boom in 
dedications at these times. Asclepius was also often worshipped here in conjunction 
with other gods and not just Hygeia and Telesphorus, but with Jupiter, Venus, and 
Neptune to name but a few. In civilian dedications, the god is generally only 
worshipped together with family members or gods connected to him in that specific 
location, such as Silvanus at Lambaesis (see Chapter 5).  
825 This appears to have been a regional phenomenon as Laurence and Trifil (2015) 110 (see section 
1.1.1) comment that there was a strong emphasis in the province of Africa on temple building and 
also on the construction of arches, far more than in Italy. The small number of sanctuaries could, 
therefore, be the result of regional preference for another form of cult or just because they have not 
been excavated yet. 
 Another important factor in military worship of Asclepius is the role of 
officers and their increased mobility. The majority of Asclepieian dedicators were 
officials and while low-rank soldiers could expect to serve with the same unit for 
their entire career, officers had a much higher level of mobility and were often 
transferred to other provinces and parts of the empire. They took with them the gods 
they had worshipped previously and supplicated them anew in their new province. 
This would have boosted the dissemination of the cult and it also shows how certain 
cultic elements were taken up in new places, such as the addition of the Pergamene 
orb on the Thracian reliefs, or how dedications were adapted to their new 
environment such as the praetorian dedication to Asclepius Zimidrenus in Rome.  
 Worship of Asclepius in Thrace differs greatly from supplication in the other 
provinces discussed here. A number of factors can explain this phenomenon, 
foremost among which is that Asclepius was already present before the creation of 
the province of Thracia and was twinned with the Thracian Rider. Yet, there was 
greater variation on the dedications erected outside Thrace than within, with most 
not giving a great deal of information about the dedicator. An explanation for this 
could be that the majority of military worshippers in Thrace were likely to have been 
auxiliaries due to the lack of legions stationed in this region. As the inscription from 
Rome indicates, legionary Thracians could depict themselves in a very different way 
if they so chose. The section on vows also shows a desire to appear as Roman as 
possible in the dedicatory material. 
Military worship of Asclepius was not uniform across the provinces but took 
different forms in each region, which is not surprising as no global culture is uniform 
in every locality.826 This global culture shared similar characteristics but had a 
826 Hodos (2015) 242. 
different identity in each locality as it took on forms which were significant to that 
locality (see section 1.1.1).827 There were connecting factors between the cults such 
as a large number of medici who worshipped the god and praetorian mobility which 
transferred the god across. Differences in rank such as auxiliary and legionary, and 
also place of origin could determine the regional variations in dedications. There 
was, thus, a considerable impact of the Roman army on the cult here.

Chapter 5: The Cult(s) of Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis and 
Numidia 
5.0 Introduction 
Worship of Asclepius was spread to the provinces via a variety of methods 
which boosted and altered his worship. Asclepius popularity with the army caused 
the spread of his worship to most of the provinces with even some scarce traces of 
cult in Syria and Arabia.828 In Africa legionaries also played an important role in the 
cult, as Asclepius was apparently so popular with the Third Augustan Legion that it 
built and dedicated the temple at Lambaesis to him. There had originally been a 
small cult on site but the Legions involvement advanced it as it built a temple on 
site. This temple was built in the name of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, and 
was called an Asclepieion.829 This dedication, thus, had a dual purpose. On the one 
hand the legionaries wished to honour Asclepius for their own health and safety. On 
the other, they also wished him to bestow good health upon the emperors as the fate 
of the empire was dependant on their well-being. Dedications from this site show 
that worship took place until the 4th century AD.830 Most inscriptions were erected in 
Latin with the most common spelling of the gods name being Aesculapius but other 
forms such as Escolapius also occurred. The Greek spelling Asklepios, which does 
occur in other Latin provinces, is rarely found in Africa. It is not clear why this was 
the case but is especially striking as Epidaurus was claimed to be the cult site from 
828 Benseddik (2010a) 1.49. 
829 CIL 8.2579a-c (p 954); Benseddik (2010a) 1.93.  
830 Benseddik (2010a) 1.148. 
which the cults in Africa came, which would make it logical for the Epidaurian and 
Greek spelling of Asclepius name also to be transferred across.  
The majority of Asclepius supplicants in Africa were officials and 
administrators. In fact, Benseddik has singled out certain groups of supplicants in 
Roman Africa, the most important of which are government officials and military 
men.831 This category is dominated by the governors and forms a kind of official and 
elitist group, especially in Numidia, where the Third Augustan Legion worshipped 
Asclepius (see section 5.4). The second group is the local aristocracy who served as 
priests of the god; many of the Asclepieian priests also served as priests of the cults 
of the emperor.832 A more modest group of worshippers were slaves and freedmen 
who would have aided in the cults diffusion. Connections with the imperial 
household (see Chapter 3) were also present in Africa because three cities also 
dedicated to Asclepius for the emperors good health; Musti dedicated statues to 
Asclepius for Hadrians health; Thibicaae dedicated a temple for Antoninus and his 
heirs; Caesarea offered land for the Severan dynastys well-being.833 As well as 
being an indication of the cities concerns, this is also an indication of the political 
role which the cult of Asclepius played in Africa, as a method by which a city could 
honour an emperor and seek his favour. The final group of influential supplicants 
were the legionaries of the Third Augustan Legion, whose worship of Asclepius will 
be examined extensively here. 
 Benseddik has argued that the evidence indicates that the cult of Asclepius 
and Hygeia spread from east to west: there were eighteen temples dedicated to the 
gods in Proconsular Africa and three in Numidia, three in Mauretania Caesariensis 
and none in Mauretania Tingitana. It also seems that Asclepius was mostly

832 Benseddik (2010a) 1.196.  
833 Benseddik (2010a) 1.194; Musti: AE 1968 586; Thibicaae CIL 8.765; Caesarea: CIL 8.9320. 
worshipped alone in Proconsular Africa but was often supplicated in conjunction 
with Hygeia in Numidia. According to her, sixty-eight inscriptions relating directly 
to the cult were found in Africa and twenty-nine in Numidia.834 Benseddik states that 
there is a clearly decreasing number in the testimonies moving from east to west, 
indicating the popularity of the cult in the provinces, and that it was likely that the 
army was one of the main factors behind the dissemination. As the Third Augustan 
Legion moved from east to west, so did the god.835 This is an important point as 
whoever introduced the cult strongly influenced its nature. However, this statement 
will be explored in this chapter and it will aim to show that this was not completely 
the case as it passes over regional differences which occurred within the cult in the 
various provinces. It will be explored here how the cult of Asclepius in Numidia 
varied in nature from that in Proconsularis. This chapter will explore different groups 
of worshippers as it will examine the ways in which the military and officials 
worshipped Asclepius, but also how civilians such as merchants worshipped a 
version of the god here. This chapter aims to explore how the increased mobility 
which occurred as a result of the Roman Empire allowed for increased religious 
diversity in an area. This will be done via the case study of Asclepius: analysis of the 
various cult paraphernalia, such as iconography and inscriptions, will illustrate how 
Roman mobility diversified religious life in Africa.  
In order to be able to show how the Roman Empire influenced the cult, it is 
necessary to first understand what is meant by the term syncretism, a history of the 
cult of Eshmun-Asclepius and also that of the Third Augustan Legion in Africa. 
Only when all of the above is known can the syncretic cult of Asclepius be compared 
with others cults of Asclepius and conclusions as to their nature be drawn. This will 
834 Benseddik (2010a) 1.120. 
835 Benseddik (2010a) 1.120-1, 123. 
be done in section 5. 5. Therefore, this chapter will first examine what is meant by 
the term syncretism and the history of the scholarly use of this term. Then epithets 
will be briefly studied, followed by a study of syncretism in the non-African 
provinces. Then, the Asclepieian syncretism in North Africa, namely that of 
Eshmun-Asclepius will be looked at. It is necessary to explore Benseddiks 
statement (see above) and it will be examined here if this is actually the case in 
North Africa as Eshmun-Asclepius was already present here from the Hellenistic 
period onwards and his cult was, thus, imported prior to the coming of the Roman 
army. This will then be followed by a study of the history of the legio III Augusta in 
this area, which will explore whether the army brought its own version of the god 
with it, a god separate from Eshmun-Asclepius. This chapter will, then, examine 
whether syncretism formed another way of disseminating the worship of the god 
Asclepius and also whether there were two distinct and separate Asclepieian gods in 
North Africa, namely the civilian god Eshmun-Asclepius and the military god 
Asclepius. It will be shown that the Third Augustan Legion was especially 
instrumental in disseminating the god in the province of Numidia and influencing the 
nature of the cult there. This chapter aims to show that the cult here grew in diversity 
through increased mobility which was the result of the creation of the Roman 
Empire. The main questions for this chapter are: What is syncretism? How was 
Asclepius syncretised with other gods? and In which ways did the military god 
Asclepius exist side-by-side and differ from the civilian god Eshmun-Asclepius?  
5.1 Syncretism 
5.1.1 A History of the Term Syncretism 
It is necessary to examine first the history and then the meaning of the term 
syncretism before an exploration of the phenomenon within the cult of Asclepius is 
possible.  
In antiquity, Herodotus lists the chief deities of the Scythians first by their 
Greek names and then by their local ones which seems to be a description of the 
process of syncretism without actually using the term itself.836 Plutarch used the 
word syngkretismos in his Moralia to indicate that a person should be friends with 
his brothers friends, and be hostile to the enemies of his brother, following the 
example of the Cretans who put aside their internal quarrels when faced with an 
external enemy.837 This process is what they called syncretism. The term does not 
really reappear until the Renaissance where Erasmus utilised the term and was 
pleased with its effects as he believed that Christian theology had absorbed Classical 
elements which he thought strengthened and enriched the Christian faith.838 
Theologians in the 16th and 17th centuries reversed this positive stance in relation to 
the term. During this period there was a movement led by Georg Calixtus which 
aimed to reconcile and join the various Protestant denominations. These debates 
were called the syncretistic controversies and its opponents argued that they were 
trying to jumble together various religions. This disapproval remained and 
syncretism was used to denote the confusing mixing of religions.839 In the second 
half of the 19th century scholars used this term in relation to antiquity to mean 
disorder and confusion. It was also believed to be an imperialist strategy used by the 
836 Herodotus 4.59. 
837 Plut. De. Frat. Amor. 490b. The text is concerned with interactions between brothers and mentions 
that brothers should not let slander come between them.

Epitome theologiae. 
Roman emperors who appropriated the local cults of conquered lands.840 This 
reversed the terms meaning in Plutarch where it was used to indicate common 
solidarity and it had now become a weapon in the emperors arsenal and was used to 
indicate the Other.841 This makes clear that syncretism is a term whose meaning has 
been constantly renegotiated and altered throughout history. 
Franz Cumont was not the first to use this term in Classical scholarship but 
he was the earliest to do so consistently and extensively. However, there was no 
discussion of what he meant or conceived by the use of this term.842 His usage was 
varied but lacking in any critical reflection. Cumont paid more attention to 
syncretism in the Roman period than in the Hellenstic one but did not refer to this as 
Graeco-Roman syncretism as previous scholars had done, but called it imperial 
syncretism.843 It is from the ways in which many 19th-century scholars utilised the 
term that many of the modern problems with its usage stem. Thus, issues must have 
arisen more from the historical use of this term.844 Other terms have been suggested 
to describe this phenomenon and postmodern anthropologists prefer the term 
Creolisation.845 Chirassi Colombo has suggested that perhaps the term acculturation 
is preferable as it indicates an unequal contact between two civilisations.846 
However, Shaw and Stewart rightly point out that it seems limiting not to use a term 
because of 19th-century connotations.847 The history of the usage of the term should 
be explored and understood for the correct usage of this word.

Webster, looking at the phenomenon in the Romano-Celtic world defines the 
term as: 
By syncretism I mean the interaction of two systems of belief and practice in the 
development of Romano-Celtic religion.848 
Websters particular focus is on the Celtic world but her definition is equally 
applicable to other provinces and areas of the Graeco-Roman world. Syncretisms 
took many different forms.849 This is not surprising as the process occurred in a 
variety of different places and contexts. Tacitus described syncretism as Interpretatio 
Romana where:  
Apud Nahanarvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur. Praesidet sacerdos muliebri 
ornatu, sed deos interpretatione Romana Castorem Pollucemque memorant. Ea vis 
numini, nomen Alcis. Nulla simulacra, nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium; 
ut fratres tamen, ut iuvenes venerantur.850  
The process described by Tacitus is the Roman interpretation of deities and the rites 
associated with them. As such, the available evidence shows predominantly the 
Roman perspective on this phenomenon. This took many forms but, in essence, it 
entailed an equation between a non-Graeco-Roman deity and one from the Graeco-
Roman religious world.851 A clear example of what is generally conceived by the 
term syncretism comes from the summit of Nemrud Da in Commagene where a 
hilltop sanctuary was built by Antiochus I who ruled from 70-36 BC. This sanctuary 
was a royal tomb and shows the king sitting side-by-side with Zeus Oromasdes

850 Tac. Germ. 43.4: Among the Nahanarvali a sacred grove is shown of ancient holiness. A priest in 
female dress runs it but the gods are spoken of in Roman fashion as Castor and Pollux. Such are the 
powers of the god, called Alcis. There are no images, no traces of foreign superstition; that as brothers 
together, as young men they are worshipped. See also Rives (1999) 306-7.

Apollo Mithras Helios Hermes, and Artagnes Heracles Ares. Syncretism indicates 
composite deities who have both Graeco-Roman and Persian elements in their 
nomenclature and worship.852 The god is what the king and worshipper say he is; he 
is not Zeus but he is Zeus Oromasdes.853 Webster argues that most studies believe 
that syncretism was a happy marriage between the two deities but often ignore the 
role of indigenous actors. This makes the hybridisation of gods a natural and 
practical process which does not need much explanation.854 
Syncretism is a contentious term which has sometimes been taken to mean 
either a contamination of an original pure religion or an inauthenticity thereof.855 It 
implies that an original religion was penetrated by symbols and rites from another.856 
Yet, it was an inevitable phenomenon of ancient religion and was present in all 
ancient societies as polytheistic societies were especially open to new gods.857 There 
was a permeability in the Roman pantheon especially due to its lack of dogma.858 
Religious transfers between variant systems depended on similarities between 
themselves and new cults were often created from a bricolage of older, existing 
cults.859 This process was driven by expansion which created new opportunities and 
pressures but also competition.860 The Roman imperial period was, thus, a time in 
which this phenomenon particularly occurred.  
852 Kaizer (2013) 113. Oromasdes appears to have been another name for Ahura Mazda, the chief god 
in Persian religion which would make him a suitable choice for syncretism with Zeus. This god seems 
also to have been another form of Jupiter Dolichenus.

It is important to stress that syncretism was a natural happenstance which 
occurred frequently in antiquity.861 As Versluys has pointed out, it is far less useful 
just to name something as Roman, than it is to examine the role it plays within the 
Roman cultural system and what it means in a particular context. Versluys uses the 
examples of the cults of Isis, Mithras, and Magna Mater to explain why this is 
relevant. He argues that these gods frequently occurred in a context where their 
eastern origins were brought to the forefront, sometimes more so than in their 
original cult place.862 This was especially clear in the case of Mithras (see also 
section 4.1.1) as direct connections between the Iranian Mithra and Mithras cannot 
be proven. Mithra was closely associated with the Persian ruling household and his 
cult vanished when this Empire fell. The cult of Mithras, on the other hand, is not 
attested before the Flavian period. This long period of time between the two cults 
indicated that at best it is possible to state that a Persian cult concept was taken up 
and reinterpreted for a Roman context but there is no evidence for any direct 
connections between the two cults.863 This Roman cult, thus, chose to present itself 
in an oriental fashion.  
Marcel Le Glay argues that there are three different types or degrees of 
syncretism. However, a great deal of overlap and fluidity between these modern 
catagories can still be expected. Le Glay examines the phenomenon in North Africa 
as there were an especially large number of assimilations which occurred there.864 
This was due to its unique location between east and west and there were numerous 
assimilations between Graeco-Roman gods and the most important gods of Africa, 
861 Cadotte (2006) 9. 
862 Versluys (2013) 242. 
863 Versluys (2013) 249. 
864 Le Glay (1975) 123. 
which is also what makes study of the cult of Asclepius in this area so interesting 
and fruitful.865 The three types are: 
 Interpretatio romana, where there was a direct assimilation 
 Assimilation where the deities were adapted from their original cultic 
nature, leading to an enrichment of their character and worship 
 A cumulative assimilation866 
In the first case the worship of a deity was joined to that of another. This direction 
connection is often indicated by epithets or double names. Other occurrences of this 
direct syncretism were with Silvanus who joined with Pegasus in Lambaesis, after 
the standard of the Third Augustan Legion.867 The second definition of syncretism, 
according to Le Glay, encompassed deities which possessed certain characteristics or 
attributes which they did not have prior to being syncretised. There were three gods 
in whose worship this happened the most, namely Mercury, Neptune, and Venus. 
Mercury/Hermes occurred across the Graeco-Roman world and in Punic Africa he 
generally cropped up in this more traditional form. However, an inscription from 
Lambaesis calls him Mercurius Silvanus and he is depicted in local guise.868 Le Glay 
argues that from this point onwards he appeared in a more African form and was 
commonly found depicted with Silvanus scorpion.869 Neptune/Poseidon was 
syncretised with the African god Yam but was mainly worshipped inland, far away 
from the sea. He was supplicated more near water sources and fountains, showing a

867 CIL 8.2585. 
868 AE 1968 645. 
869 Le Glay (1975) 140-1.  
clear adaptation of his worship.870 Venus was worshipped all across Africa in various 
guises such as victrix and adquistrix.871 The latter is the remarkable one as it occurs 
in Lepcis Magna where she had taken over tasks and iconography which generally 
belonged to Mercury as Venus, was the protectress of the customs officers of the IIII 
publica Africae here.872 Le Glays third category encompasses the cumulative 
process where a deity gathers a number of epithets and attributes. The most obvious 
is Jupiter who apart from being Optimus Maximus was also valens, stator, dilectator, 
and depulsorius, for example.873 Another form which this took was new groupings of 
gods such as at Lambaesis with Asclepius, Jupiter Valens, and Silvanus 
Pegasianus.874 The more epithets a god had, the more power he was thought to have 
had. Syncretism happened between gods who were similar but they need not have 
been alike in every single way. Each god, therefore, gained more spheres of 
influence as a result of syncretism and, thus, could have also grown in power (see 
section 2.3). 
5.1.2 Syncretism in the Provinces 
 Before continuing the examination of syncretism in North Africa, it is useful 
to look at the phenomenon in the Northern provinces first as the process also 
commonly happened there. Caesar, in his Bellum Gallicum, stated that the Gauls 
worshipped Mercury the most, followed by Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva.875 
He does not mention any local gods and as the area had only been recently

conquered it is unlikely that there had been time for these gods to be influenced by 
Rome already.876 However, as a Roman commenting on local religious practices, it is 
perhaps unsurprising that he phrases this in a way which would be easily accessible 
and familiar to both himself and his reader.  
The Roman soldiers were the ones who introduced votive practices to Gaul, 
especially the act of inscribing on stone.877 Derks has studied the transformation of 
religious systems in Gaul and states that there were no known myths extant from 
Roman Gaul. For an understanding of the Celtic religious world, it is, therefore, 
necessary to examine the epigraphic and archaeological evidence.878  
The earliest known altar was likely dedicated to Mars Halamardus as it is 
dated to AD 10-43 at the earliest and was erected by legionaries.879 The first non-
military altar comes from Ruimel and is dedicated to Magusanus Hercules by the 
summus magistratus of the Batavi.880 Derks argues that there were general 
tendencies which governed the twinning of gods where only a small number of 
Roman gods were linked to a large number of regional deities. Mars and Mercury 
were assimilated the most and the only other gods chosen were Apollo, Hercules, 
and Silvanus.881 Many Celtic deities were mentioned only once and there was likely 
a high degree of localism within their worship.882  
Within this there was also a regional difference as Mars was linked to civic 
deities in the south and Hercules with those in the north. There is a large degree of 
votive clustering and also onomastic groups, especially with Mars. However, this did 
not happen with Mercury and his dedications were spread all over the Central and

Lower Rhine areas but most of his sanctuaries were simple and modest, leading 
Derks to conclude that he was merely a local god of limited importance.883 Apollo 
was mostly linked to Grannus but there were no dedications set up by magistrates or 
priests, indicating that this was again, probably only a non-official, local, cult.884 
Silvanus was similarly linked to only two local gods, namely Sinquates in Gerouville 
and Vosegus in Busenberg.885 This would mean that Mars and Hercules were linked 
to public and civic cult but that Apollo, Mercury, and Silvanus only had localised 
and private cult.886  
These associations would have likely been made by local people as Rome 
only tended to involve itself in religious matters when they were a danger to Rome. 
Nothing much is known about the gods twinned with the Roman deities and only 
known from this epigraphic data, yet the gods associated with Mars and Hercules 
must have been the gods who were important at the time of the conquest, as principal 
local deities would have been linked with the main Roman gods associated with 
war.887  
This interpretatio shows how the indigenous elites considered the Roman 
gods and it did not only take the form of name-twinning two gods but also occurred 
in divine marriages between a Roman male deity and a female Celtic one.888 The 
most famous of these is between Mercury and Rosmerta, the great giver goddess, but 
there was also one between Apollo Grannus and Sirona. Almost all iconographic 
images of these two gods together were made by local artists.889 Therefore, it was

also not just epigraphically that a god could be syncretised but also iconographically. 
This also occurred in Thrace where both Apollo and Asclepius were identified with 
the Thracian rider (see section 4.4) and were represented in the guise of the Rider 
and not in the traditional Asclepeieian iconographical pose, for example the 
Chiaramonti type (see section 2.4). This all indicates that syncretism could take a 
variety of forms within one context and there can be multiple reasons and 
explanations for connecting two gods.  
5.1.3 Epithets  
This study of syncretism in the Northern provinces shows its multi-faceted 
nature and how it can differ in each region. The contact between cultures creates a 
new situation where a god was created to whom both locals and Romans could 
relate. This contact created religious diversity. Asclepius was worshipped under 
numerous epithets in Africa (see section 2.3 for general discussion). He is called 
Augustus in numerous inscriptions from Africa and a few from Numidia:890   
Aesculapio / Augusto / sacrum / M(arcus) Orbius / Felix / votum / solvit / cum 
suis891 
Another epithet which occurs is Dominus; it occurs three times, once in Carthage, 
Thisduo, and Thuburbo Maius892:

This stele was set up by a Lucius Numisius Vitalis and is dated between AD 117 and 
138.894 The Numisii were known civic benefactors and also erected a temple to 
Mercurius Augustus.895 As the inscription states that the podium was built by order 
of the god, this could indicate that Vitalis had previously been a supplicant of 
Asclepius and may have been cured of an illness.896 An inscription from Thisduo 
also contains an invocation for the health of Marcus Aurelius and his family so the 
use of the epithet dominus might imply that Asclepius is master of health.897 The title 
Dominus is equivalent to the Phoenician Adon which is an epithet found with 
numerous gods, for example Baal. It identified gods and rulers of cities, signalling 
the holders power.898 Sanctus is only found in Numidia in a dedication by Marcus 
Porcius Iustus, an officer of the Third Augustan Legion (Fig. 77):

The term is similar to the Greek Agios, which rarely occurs, but a similar term is 
found in Africa with Baal-Hammon, namely the semitic qds.900 The similarity 
between the epithets used by Asclepius and Baal is notable and signals the important 
position and power held by Asclepius in Africa. Baal was a civic god similar to 
Eshmun, whose worship will be discussed in the next section. Asclepius is also 
called Soter in an inscription from Lepcis Magna (see below).901 The use of this 
epithet is perhaps unsurprising in the military context of the cult. The legion, more 
than anyone else, had a need for a saviour-god and, over time, Asclepius became the 
healing god for the legion as well as a guarantor of the safety and security of the 
empire.902 In Belalis Maior in Africa, Asclepius is hailed as Repentinus:  
Deo / Aesculapio / Repentino / C(aius) Cornelius / Afranius / Felix posuit.903 
900 Benseddik (2010a) 1.60: in Semitic sr qds means holy prince.  
901 IRT 265. 
902 Benseddik (2010a) 1.167. 
903 AE 2010 1804: To the God Asclepius Repentinus, Gaius Cornelius Afranius Felix erected this. 
There is no explanation for Repentinus but it could have been the name of a deity, 
making this a case of interpretatio romana or syncretism.904 Asclepius was 
worshipped here not only as a healing god but also as a saviour god. Thus, while 
Roman terminology is used to describe the various aspects of Asclepius cult and 
many of these epithets are found elsewhere, there is also a local meaning to the 
chosen epithets. 
5.2 Eshmun-Asclepius 
In Africa, Asclepius was assimilated with the god Eshmun. Eshmun was also 
identified with Apollo but this was the Apollo Medicus of Rome and not the later 
mantic version of the god.905 As stated above, Benseddik argued that the cult of 
Asclepius moved from east to west Africa, with the Roman army being one of the 
main vehicles of the cults dissemination. However, the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius 
was already present in what would later become the province of Africa 
Proconsularis, focussed especially around Carthage and the Carthaginian lands. 
Therefore, this section will first explore the cult of Eshmun and then the syncretism 
between Eshmun and Asclepius as it is necessary to understand this cult and its 
nature before moving on to the cult focussed in Numidia and around Lambaesis, 
which appears to have been different in various ways.  
5.2.1 Eshmun and the Cult at Sidon 
904 Benseddik (2010a) 1.62. 
905 Lipinski (1994) 20. 
The cult of Eshmun was first attested in the 8th century BC when the god 
stood as guarantor in pacts between Matiel, king of Arpad, and king Assurnirari V 
of Assyria in 754 BC.906 There are two likely explanations for the origin of the name 
Eshmun; the first is that it was some derivation from the number eight or as one 
who was derived from the life-giving warmth, which came from Hebrew.907 There 
is a paucity of ancient evidence relating to the cult of Eshmun. What is available puts 
the gods earliest cult centres in the kingdom of Ebla and in the port-city of Ugarit.908 
In Ebla the cult was aimed more at individuals, whereas at Ugarit the cult fell under 
royal protection, making it an official cult. It seems that Eshmun was associated with 
fertility and healing from the start and he appears to have been credited with 
introducing olive oil to the Mesopotamian world, which was viewed as a kind of 
panacea, capable of curing virtually any disease and reviving the moribund.909 In 
texts, Eshmun appears as one of the greater gods of the Phoenician pantheon. Royal 
inscriptions from Sidon from the end of the 6th to 5th centuries BC call the god Holy 
Prince and they also show the nature and placement of the Sidonian gods: Eshmun 
was the healer, helpful and close to people and was worshipped in a temple located 
outside the town in Bostan esh-Sheikh, while Baal, protector of the city had an urban 
temple.910 In Sidon and Tyre inscriptions suggest a joint healing cult of Eshmun and 
Melqart. The corpora show a continuous royal devotion to the cult.911  
The main temple of Eshmun was in Bostan esh-Sheikh near Sidon which was 
discovered in 1901. More than 660 objects were found on site but 600 of these have

Agrigento where the temple was located in the plains (see section 2.2.5).

been lost in the Lebanese civil wars.912 Eshmun was worshipped as healing god here 
and in Amrit from the 5th century BC onwards as they were thought to be especially 
salubrious places due to their water sources.913 The temple at Sidon can be dated by 
an inscription which states that king Eshmunazar and his mother built the temple of 
Eshmun.914 The temple was expanded between the 6th and 4th centuries BC and some 
inscriptions to Asclepius were found here.915 This temple is generally considered to 
be the cultic centre of the cult of Eshmun and also Eshmun-Asclepius.916  
However, two main friezes in the temple at Sidon depict Apollo and personal 
names with derivations of Apollo were also common in Sidon.917 These are of an 
earlier date than the earliest mention of Asclepius, which did not occur until 44/3 
BC, where the god appears on a series of inscribed urns, which were victory 
commemorations of contests:

Rigsby points out that the evidence indicates that the Sidonians first believed 
Eshmun to be a version of the Greek Apollo, and not originally of Asclepius.919 
There are some Hellenistic dedications to Asclepius in Phoenicia which indicate that

Heavens and it was we who built the temple for Eshmun, holy prince of the sacred spring YDLL, and 
enthroned him. And it was we who built the temples for the gods of the Sidonians at Sidon of the 
Coast, the temple of the Baal-Sidon and the temple of Ashtart-Name-of-Baal." Eshmunazar lived 
around the 5th century BC.

some Sidonian worshippers had started to call the god Asclepius by then, preferring 
him over Apollo, but the local festival was called the Apolloneia until the Flavian 
period, which could indicate a local preference for an identification with Apollo over 
Asclepius until then, not dissimilar to what occurred at Deir el-Bahari in Egypt (see 
section 3.3.1).920  
Other reliefs were found at the temple of Eshmun in Sidon, probably dating 
from after a fire which destroyed the original temple in 343-342 BC, showing 
hunting scenes but also a cock, a bird generally associated with Asclepius.921 A large 
number of Hellenistic statues were found in Sidon, among them many statuettes of 
boys, which fits in with dedicatory patterns to Asclepius from Epidaurus, Athens, 
Corinth, Skopelos, Thespiae, Lissos, and also Lebena where similar statues were 
dedicated.922 
In Sidon, Eshmun was never represented as a Phoenician god but he is found 
in the Greek guise of Asclepius. A fragmentary head of a statue shows a distinct, 
though simplified, Asclepieian iconography (Figs. 78-79):923

The hair style indicates that this was of the Giustini type (see sections 2.4 and 
3.3.1).924 A torso belonging to the Asclepius Este or Epidaurus type was also found 
here, showing typical Asclepieian drapery of the himation (Fig. 21).925 A 
fragmentary votive relief depicting Asclepius and Hygeia was also found on the site, 
indicating that Eshmun had not just taken over Asclepius name but also his most 
important Greek iconographic types.926 Stucky argues that the small dimensions of 
these statues indicate that they must be from the late Hellenistic period as it was only 
from the start of the Roman period that the Phoenicians started to import marble in 
enough quantities for life-size statuary. This dating is also more likely seeing as the 
Phoenicians took up the well-known iconographic types but did not blindly copy 
them but made small changes to all of them.927 This, combined with the evidence 
from an inscription from Sardinia discussed below and iconographic evidence, make 
the connections between the two gods clear.928  
Stuckys excavation report of the sanctuary lists some previously 
unpublished Phoenician inscriptions and also a corpus of Greek inscriptions from the 
site.929 Amongst these are four dedicatory inscriptions which are clearly set up to 
Asclepius.930 Apart from a single inscription to Dionysus Kademeios, Asclepius is 
the only god mentioned in the Greek inscriptions. One was erected by a priest of 
Mithras, indicating that the cult must have continued to prosper for a long time here:

930 Twenty-two Greek inscriptions are listed in total. Most are very fragmentary and of these four, two 
are to Asclepius: Gr6-Gr9, and one to Dionysus Kadmeios: Gr5. These two are the only two gods 
clearly mentioned here: Stucky (2005) 321-330, Gr1-Gr22.

Roman coins were found in Sidon depicting Eshmun-Asclepius on the reverse, 
wearing a himation and boots (Fig. 80):

In his left hand Asclepius holds the snake-staff and in his right there is a phiale 
containing a round object which he holds over a tripod altar. Left above the god there 
is the chariot of Astarte with two palm branches and the coin is inscribed COL AVR 
PIA METR and there is a bust of Severus Alexander on the obverse.932 The cult of 
Astarte was linked to that of Eshmun as they were worshipped together at Sidon and 
her cult was syncretised with Cybele (see below).933 The river close to the sanctuary 
at Bostan esh-Sheikh, the Nahr el-Awali, was also called the Asclepius fluvius.934 
931 Stucky (2005) 324 Gr6: To the god Asclepius, Theodotus, priest of Mithras erected this in the 
year 251. The year 251 is AD 141. The Roman cult of Mithras was only created in the Flavian period 
(see section 4.1.1). 
932 This indicates that the city was a colony, founded under Antonines or Severans and was a 
metropolis. BMC Phoenicia 199.321; SNG Cop. 151-152. Further coins with Asclepius-Eshmun 
appear in Sidon with a bust of Elagabalus: AMS 1944.100.71775, 1944.100.71776 which have a 
similar iconography to the coin of Severus Alexander. There are also coins from Carne: AMS

Eshmun holding the snake staff on the reverse.

Strabo also mentions a sacred grove of Asclepius here, one of the few ancient 
sources to comment on the sanctuary.935 
5.2.2 Assimilation  
It is likely that Asclepius and Eshmun were assimilated in the 5th BC in Carthage as 
there was a temple to the god there. Here he formed a triad with Baal Hammin, and 
Tanit Pene Baal and was one of the main protective deities of Carthage where he was 
hailed as brother showing his extraordinary protective force.936 The cult was 
seemingly very popular as the name Eshmun occurs a lot in Carthaginian 
onomastics.937 However, only a few inscriptions to Eshmun were found around 
Carthage, one of which mentions his priest and another which mentions a priest of 
Eshmun-Astarte. The god appears in Carthage with various epithets, most of which 
refer to saving and preserving, emphasising his role as a healing deity and the 
individual dimension of his cult, but also his role as a fertility deity, making him a 
good fit for syncretisation with either Apollo or Asclepius.938 Apuleius also refers to 
Asclepius role as protector: 
935 Strabo 16.2.22. Strabo only mentions Sidon and the grove of Asclepius in passing and is more 
interested in moving on to Tyre.

937 Priest of Eshmun: CIS 1.2362; Priest of Eshmun-Astarte CIS 1.245; Cadotte (2006) 165. Carthage 
was one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the Roman Empire during the 2nd century AD, second 
perhaps only to Rome in the West: Rives (1995) 27. It had been refounded as a Roman colony about 
one hundred years after the Punic city had been destroyed in the Second Punic war: Rives (1995) 28. 
The Capitoline triad was installed on the Byrsa: Rives (1995) 42 and other popular gods here were 
Venus and Ceres. Caelestis was worshipped as one of the main deities of Carthage and is seen as 
being the Roman version of the Punic goddess Tanit. Tanit had been the main protective goddess of 
Punic Carthage and this protective role continued with Caelestis who was also by the Roman 
emperors precisely for this reason: Rives (1995) 65, 69. 
938 Benseddik (2010a) 1.35. 
Nunc quoque igitur principium mihi apud vestras auris auspicatissimum ab 
Aesculapio deo capiam, qui arcem nostrae Carthaginis indubitabili numine propitius 
respicit.939 
The temple of Eshmun in Carthage was circular in shape and located on the 
Acropolis, showing the important place this god held in the civic pantheon. The 
temple was on the acropolis/Byrsa and was, according to Appian, the richest and 
most important of all.940 It was notorious as when Scipio took Carthage in 146 BC, 
Hasdrubal took refuge on the Acropolis with his wife and sons but the temple was 
burnt down while Hasdrubals wife was still in it.941 Some sources refer to this 
temple as that of Eshmun and some as that of Asclepius, confirming the twinning of 
these two gods.942 Benseddik argues that there was also a circular temple to 
Asclepius-Eshmun in Thugga.943 From Carthage, the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius 
spread across the Carthaginian lands and accompanied the Phoenicians on their 
conquests. His cult was found across the Orient to Cyprus, North Africa, the Italian 
Islands, and also Iberia.944 
The connections between Eshmun and Asclepius transcend the immediate 
region of Africa and are found elsewhere in the empire. Damascius in his Vita Isidori 
identifies Asclepius as Eshmun, whom he calls a native Phoenician.945 He is also the 
only literary author who mentions the cult. However, there are a number of 
939 Apul. Flor. 18: Even now, therefore, I shall make a beginning most pleasing to your ears by 
starting with the god Asclepius, who protects the citadel of our Carthage propitiously with his 
undoubtable divine power.

inscription from Sardinia which shows the assimilation between the two gods:946  
Fig. 81: SEG 50.1030. Trilingual Inscription to Eshmun-Asclepius from Sardinia. 
This inscription was found in the area of Santuiaci, northeast of Cagliari in 
Sardinia.947 It is now thought to date to the 1st century BC and not the 2nd as was 
previously thought.948 The Greek and Latin texts have a similar context and are 
dedicated to Asclepius but the Punic text is dedicated to Eshmun949:  
Cleon salari(orum) soc(iorum) s(ervus) Aescolapio Merre donum dedit lubens 
merito merente vacat     - 
        
946 SEG 50.1030. The inscription is dedicated to Eshmun Merre of which the origin is unclear. 
947 Bulla (2004):  The inscription was found in February 1861 in the vicinity of the well of Santuiaci 
which is located about four kilometres outside of the city. The excavations were performed on behalf 
of the Savoy dynasty, who were based in Turin, where the inscription is now located in the Museo di 
antichit. The inscribed side is forty centimetres long and seven centimetres high. The temple of 
Santuaici is believed to be to a Sardinian healing deity.  
948 Chaniotis, Stroud and Strubbe (2014) argue for the 1st century; Xella (1993) 482 for the 2nd 
century. 
949 SEG 50.1030. 
The Latin version is the most concise while the Greek text is an individual 
expression from a slave. The Phoenician includes details from both the Greek and 
Latin but adds extra details such as the weight of the object and also that the god 
answered Cleons prayers. However, in the Latin text this could be implicit in 
merito.951 Adams states that the Greek and Latin are nothing more than simple lip-
service as they say nothing about the nature of the dedication, unlike the detailed 
Punic text.952 The use of Punic is widely attested in Sardinia together with Latin and 
this is also not the only occurrence of a multilingual inscription from this area.953 
There were connections between Phoenicians and Sardinia as the Carthaginians were 
settled here from about 500 BC and controlled trade here and as such especially 
settled in coastal towns.954 Even after the Roman occupation of the island Phoenician 
religion maintained a strong hold of the island as is attested by numerous Punic and 
Neo-Punic inscriptions to numerous Punic gods such as Baal and Astarte.955 
Inscriptions in Phoenician and Punic were erected here from the end of the 9th 
century BC to the 2nd century AD.956 Unfortunately, there is no explanation for the 
epithet Merre. The dedicator is a servuus sociorum and salt mining was an important 
industry in the local area. A votive terracotta hand with the inscription Eshmun 
950 Cleon a slave of a salt association, willingly, deservedly and rightly gave a gift to Asclepius 
Merre.

listens was found near Cagliari. Xella suggests that this could be an ex-voto similar 
to those found within the cult of Asclepius.957 Inscriptions set up to Asclepius 
Epekoos were also relatively common in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, 
suggesting further possible connections between the gods here.958  
From Carthage the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius seemed to spread to the 
immediate area under Carthaginian influence, especially Thugga and Thuburbo 
Maius.959 There were a lot of similarities between the cults there and the one at 
Carthage, as Asclepius-Eshmun is associated with Caelestis and the god is called 
dominus in both Carthage and Thuburbo Maius.960 The presence of this god in 
Carthage explains the presence of Eshmun-Asclepius in the Carthaginian lands and 
his prominence on the hill of Byrsa.961 A further point of note is that Asclepius was 
connected with Cybele sometimes in Africa, something which rarely occurs 
elsewhere. This connection can be explained by syncretic links as Eshmun and 
Astarte were gods worshipped side-by-side at Sidon and Eshmun was assimilated 
with Asclepius and Astarte with Cybele. The identification of Eshmun and Asclepius 
appears not to have been popular in Phoenicia, which would explain its scarcity in 
the epigraphic sources and absence on coinage from Berytus which depicted 
Elagabalus.962 
The cult of Eshmun, thus, had a rich history of its own, dating back to the 8th 
century BC. At some point, maybe during the Hellenistic period, the cult of 
Asclepius was joined with that of Eshmun. This happened probably at Carthage as 
the sources there refer to both a temple of Eshmun and that of Asclepius on the

Byrsa and also this seems to have been the point from which the cult was 
disseminated further. The cult at Sidon shows clear traces of Asclepieian cult in its 
iconography and also the dedications. There are no clear military connections with 
this cult. The inscription from Sardinia shows that the cult spread and was popular in 
lands controlled by the Carthaginians and this seems to have been the cults 
stronghold in Carthaginian lands. If the gods were indeed connected at Carthage, it is 
probable that the Asclepius which Eshmun came into contact with had been imported 
from Sicily, simply due to its close geographical proximity and the presence of a cult 
of Asclepius at Agrigento (see section 2.2.5). The next section will examine the cult 
of Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis and Numidia generally, including a study of an 
iconographic type which was specific to Africa. Thereafter, the cult after the Roman 
conquest will be examined and specific cultic elements will be highlighted which 
seem to differ from those of the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius. 
5.3 Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis and Numidia 
The cult of Eshmun-Asclepius has been examined above and it appears to 
have had a distinct cultic identity. However, this chapter aims to explore the cults of 
Asclepius in Roman North Africa and whether people from this region all worshiped 
the same god. Sometime after the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius gained in strength in 
Carthage, the legio III Augusta was settled in this region and it also supplicated the 
god Asclepius. Section 5.4 will examine the worship of Asclepius by members of the 
legion, but before a comprehensive study of the two cults can be undertaken and 
compared, it is necessary to first make some general comments on the cult of 
Asclepius in the provinces of Africa Proconsularis and Numidia to properly 
understand the nature of the cults in this region.  
5.3.1 Asclepius in Africa 
Fig. 82: Evidence for Cult of Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis. 
Benseddik makes several important points in relation to the cults of 
Asclepius in both the Latin provinces and in North Africa. She points out that 
Asclepius has almost no military-related presence in certain Latin provinces such as 
Dacia but was strongly associated in others such as Africa, Spain, Britain, Dalmatia, 
and Pannonia, with many garrison towns also having important centres, such as 
Lambaesis and Bracara Augusta in Spain.963 However, Chapter 4 of this thesis has 
shown this statement to now be erroneous as Dacia did have an important military-
related cult of Asclepius as did the other Balkan and Danube provinces. She also 
points out that cult of Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis (see Figs. 82-83 and Table 
7) had three aspects; the first was where solely Asclepius was worshipped, the 
second where he was worshipped as a protector of thermal complexes, and the third 
as the tutelary deity of the Third Augustan legion.964 While not always mutually 
exclusive, this did mean that there are certain cult-centres in Africa which had more 
of a civilian connection than a military one, for example at Timgad, Cuicul, and 
Rusicade.965  
Fig. 83: Evidence for Cult from Sites in Africa Proconsularis. 
963 Benseddik (1995) 16: she states that Firstly (concerning mainly Dacia and Apulum in particular) 
those documents where the military aspect of the cult plays a diminished role, no doubt explicable as 
due to the influence of Greek and oriental immigrant colonists in the area. Secondly (concerning 
Africa, Spain, Britain, Norica, Dalmatia and Pannonia) those documents which are, by contrast, of an 
almost exclusively military character. She also notes that there has been a lack of scholarly interest in 
the cult of Asclepius in North Africa. Her two volume monograph, Benseddik (2010a) has done a lot 
to rectify this but apart from her excellent work there is still a distinct scholarly lack of interest in the 
cult here.

Table 7: Evidence for Cult from Sites in Africa Proconsularis. 
An especially large number of statues of Asclepius and Hygeia were found in 
bathing complexes in Africa as twenty-one statues were found from twenty-four bath 
complexes here, whereas in Italy and Asia Minor combined, only eleven statues were 
recovered from twenty-three complexes.966 Most of these statues belong to either the 
Tunis or Campana type.967 Asclepius and Hygeia were commonly associated with 
bathing and their iconography in thermal complexes served to underscore the 
healthiness of the act of bathing.968 A colossal gilded statue of Asclepius stood in the 
Baths of Caracalla in Rome and an altar to Asclepius was also found in Aquae 
Sulis.969 Baths were also places to refresh the body and attain good health. Statues of 
healing gods such as Asclepius and Hygeia, and also gods who could be involved 
with healing such as Venus and Cupid, Bacchus and Hercules, were common.970 
Health-related inscriptions and statues of these healing deities would complement the 
message that bathing was good for a person.971 The god found in these bathing 
centres had a strong Graeco-Roman iconography and cultic nature and, therefore, the 
god depicted by the military here was probably not the syncretic deity of Eshmun-
Asclepius but one which they had brought to Africa themselves. This can also be 
seen from the gods name as the syncretic version of the god is generally called 
Eshmun-Asklepios whereas all the dedications in military context were to 
Aesculapius, following the Latinised spelling of the gods name.

It is clear that Asclepius was worshipped in different ways and to varying 
degrees in each of the African provinces. His main military cult-centre in Africa was 
at Lambaesis in Numidia (Fig. 84) but there was also a temple at Castellum 
Tidditanorum where there are ruins of a rectangular complex and a bearded head of 
Asclepius was found. Another temple was built in Timgad, which was constructed 
during Commodus reign and expanded in AD 213 by the local town. Asclepius was 
worshipped here together with Dea Africa (see Table 8/Fig. 85).972

The tables and graphs show a varying spread of cult paraphernalia across the two 
provinces. In Proconsularis there were generally more cult sites including a large 
number of temples.973 After all, temples were not a prerequisite for cult on a site and 
all that was needed was an altar. In some cases only a statue may have been found in 
bathing complexes, which were especially numerous in Proconsularis. In this case it 
is not possible to state with certainty that this was a cult site as the statue could 
merely have served as decoration on the one hand or a reminder of the salubrious 
nature of the environs on the other. In Numidia most cult sites seem to be clustered 
around military sites even though civilian settlements did also grow out of these 
places. The gap between the military and civilian religious lives are, therefore, not 
completely clear and there must have been a certain level of contact between these 
groups. However, the military camp at Dura Europos was drastically rebuilt in AD 
180-190 and the walls now encircled three temples which had been used by civilians 
before, namely those of Bel, Mithras, and Artemis Azzanathkona and it seems that 
from this point onwards they were solely used by soldiers.974 This could imply that a 
cult located within an army camp would have been for the sole use of members of 
the military. This in turn could mean that every cult located within an army camp 
was, in fact, a so-called official cult. There seem to have, thus, been elements of the 
cult which occurred more strongly in one of the two provinces. An Asclepieian 
iconography specific to Africa will be examined next and it will be shown that this 
too occurred more frequently in Proconsularis. 
5.3.2 African Iconography  
973 Laurence and Trifil (2015) 110. 
974 Downey (2007) 109; Fink, Hoey and Snyder (1940) 11. 
It has been shown that the syncretism between Eshmun and Asclepius had a 
rich history in Africa which was connected with Carthage specifically and the lands 
under Carthaginian control. The African version of the god also had his own 
iconography. In Africa, Mercury was represented in a more regional guise with a 
scorpion as a result of his twinning with Silvanus. Something similar apparently 
occurred with Asclepius, although, as shown above, Eshmun was represented in the 
guise of Asclepius, so it is hard to state that this differing iconography was as a result 
of syncretism. However, the god does appear in a very local guise which occurred 
only in Africa, indicating that some local elements must have been in play here. This 
statue is called the Tunis type (Figs. 86-87): 
Fig. 86: Statue of Asclepius from Lambaesis. Fig. 87: Asclepius depicted in the Tunis Type 
A statue of Asclepius excavated in the sanctuary of Apollo in Bulla Regia was the 
first version of this type to be found.975 LIMC lists five occurrences of this statue, 
four of which come from Africa and the fifth is held in Florence.976 No other statues 
from Africa are listed in any of the other iconographic categories, with the exception 
of statuary from Lepcis Magna. The Tunis type is a variation of the Campana type. 
The latter type has both arms separate from the torso and Asclepius holds a short 
snake-staff in his right hand. The himation leaves his stomach and left shoulder bare 
and folds to the knee. This type is based upon the Hellenic iconography of the 
standing Asclepius and follows the generic and standardised representations of the 
god found across the Graeco-Roman world (see section 2.4).977 The Tunis type, 
according to LIMC, has the same drapery and attitude but Asclepius holds his short 
snake-staff in his left hand.978 Benseddik adds to this description in an article in 
which she explores the Asclepieian African iconography in detail. She states that 
there are forty statues of Asclepius and Hygeia known in Africa. Only in the east of 
Africa Proconsularis was there any variety in iconographic types of Asclepius but 
not so much in those of Hygeia.979 The provinces of Proconsularis and Numidia 
yield twenty-three statues of the Asclepieian Tunis type with the distribution being 
as follows: 
 Africa Proconsularis:  
Carthage 1, Gammarth 1, Hamman Djedid 1, Khanget 1, Hadrumentum 2, 
Thugga 2, Hippo Regius 1, Calama 1, Madaure 1, Thubursicu Numidarum 2.

Aquae Flavianae 1, Timgad 4, Lambaesis 2.980 
In general, fewer statues were found in Numidia than in Proconsularis (see below). 
Benseddik notes that in addition to the variations noted in LIMC, there is another 
difference which was not mentioned as most of these statues also have a vegetative 
crown, generally made of laurels, although the statue from Hammam Djedid has a 
crown made of ears of wheat instead.981 Both this statue and one from Carthage are 
also accompanied by a statue of Telesphorus. Telesphorus gained prominence in 
Pergamum and his worship was disseminated from there and grew in popularity 
from the Trajanic period onwards. Hadrian visited the province of Africa in AD 128 
after he had visited Pergamum in AD 124 and, thus, it may be that this iconographic 
addition was added to the Asclepieian iconography after Hadrians visit, an after 
effect of the emperors worship of the Pergamene Asclepius. 
 Asclepieian iconography was standardised across the empire and LIMC lists 
seventeen types from across the Graeco-Roman world which were slight variations 
upon the core Asclepieian representation.982 This makes the Tunis variant all the 
more striking, especially as LIMC does not comment on the major differences of this 
type, namely the crown. The crown and the styling of the hair, which was long and 
arranged in curls, seems to have been a local preference. The origin of this could be 
from the local deities Eshmun and Marcurgum. The connection with Eshmun is hard 
to prove as no statue from Africa can be ascribed to this god with any certainty. 
However, a relief from Beja, badly damaged, depicts a local healing deity called 
Marcurgum in a group of other such gods. He sits facing the viewer and wears a long 
tunic and a cape around his right shoulder which leaves the arm bare. He holds a

short staff around which a snake coils in his left hand and the right lies on his knee 
shaking a volumen.983 The two gods may have been twinned and their iconographies 
merged here. It is also possible that the vegetative crown iconography comes from 
Dionysus via Eshmun. Eshmun was also twinned with Dionysus, statues of whom 
were also found in Sidon and who was commonly depicted wearing such crowns. 
There are further connections between the three gods as a relief from Lepcis Magna 
depicts two pillars and a pediment, possibly indicating the temple of Asclepius as 
this is to whom the dedication is erected. A bearded man, presumably Asclepius, 
looks on from the pediment and in the centre there is a curled snake and a pine-cone 
on a stick. This staff is possibly Dionysus Thyrsus, which was always topped with a 
pine cone and was a symbol of prosperity and fertility (Fig. 88):984

Asclepius is worshipped here by a marble merchant. One word stands out in 
particular from the inscription, which is aretes. The word is Greek but has been 
code-switched to Latin here.986 This was perhaps done as the dedicator felt that the 
meaning of the word had no suitable equivalent to the meaning he wishes to 
convey.987 Code-switching often expresses social meanings where the dedicator 
seeks to present a specific image of himself to the reader.988 
Only three other inscriptions mentioning Asclepius come from Roman 
Tripolitania, all of which come from Lepcis Magna and are dated to the 2nd-3rd 
centuries AD. These inscriptions mention a priest and statues of Asclepius which 
would imply a cult here but none of the dedicators mention a rank of any sort. They 
were probably of a non-military origin like Asclepiades the marble-merchant from 
985 A. For the good fortune of our lords. Asclepiades, (set up) a thank offering to the god Asclepius.

986 Code-switching is a switch from one language into another within one persons utterance or piece 
of writing: Adams (2003) 19. When an author or dedicator did so, he could either use the word in its 
original alphabet or could switch the characters as well, something which occurs here: Pelttari (2011)

the above inscription.989 This matters as it shows the non-military nature of the cult 
in Roman Tripolitania as none of the worshippers were connected with the army in 
any way. The epigraphic material shows that the cult in Proconsularis was mainly a 
civilian cult. Whereas in Numidia (see below) most Asclepieian dedications were 
erected by people connected to the military, especially legati, in Proconsularis there 
were only two, one a dedication set up by a propraetor in Carthage and the other an 
inscription which mentions a decurion who was also a priest of Asclepius from 
Tibaris.990 The cult seems to have been civilian in nature and to have had its own 
iconography which was connected to various local gods. The cults of the god 
discussed thus far have a strong civilian nature and the military version of Asclepius 
and his worship will now be explored, starting with an overview of the history of the 
Third Augustan legion and its movements in Africa, followed by an examination of 
its religions in general. When the cult of Asclepius in Numidia has been explored 
extensively, it will be possible to compare the two cults and see whether there were 
two distinct cults in Africa.  
5.4 The Roman Army in Numidia 
 The previous section (5.2) has shown that the gods Eshmun and Asclepius 
were syncretised during the classical era and that their joint cult was present in North 
Africa from this period. From Carthage the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius spread to the 
rest of Africa Proconsularis and also other lands which were under Carthaginian 
control. Section 5.3.2 has explored an Asclepieian iconography which was unique to 
Africa and has highlighted several aspects of the cult which were seemingly 
989 IRT 263, 265, 396. IRT 396 is a building inscription from the baths at Lepcis and mentions the 
erection of a statue of Asclepius there. 
990 CIL 8.24535, 8.26185. 
distinctive to this area. As such, it cannot be doubted that there was a cult of this god 
in North Africa. However, the aim of this chapter is to explore whether there was 
only one cult of the god in Roman North Africa or if there was a higher degree of 
religious differentiation in this region via the existence of multiple cults. The Roman 
army, which had been garrisoned in the province of Proconsularis, also worshipped a 
god Asclepius and this section will examine whether this was the same god as 
Eshmun-Asclepius or if this was a god which the legion had brought with them to 
Numidia. In order to understand this properly, the history and movements of the 
Third Augustan Legion will first be explored, followed by a brief examination of the 
religion of the legion before moving on to its interactions with Asclepius. 
Fig. 89: Map of Roman North Africa. 
5.4.1 The legio III Augusta in Africa991 
 For most of the imperial era the only legion which was stationed in North 
Africa (Fig. 89) was the Third Augustan. It is not known when this legion was 
created but Le Bohec suggests that it is probable that the Third Augustan had been a 
part of Lepidus army and that the legion had performed some kind of service to 
Augustus which made him grant the honour of the use of his name at some time 
between 27 and 19 BC.992 However, there is no evidence relating to the Third 
Augustan before AD 5.993 It is also not known with any certainty when the legio III 
arrived in Africa, although it was first attested when the legion participated in the 
African wars which lasted from 6 BC to 9 AD.994 The earliest garrison of the Third 
Augustan legion was previously thought to have been at Ammaedara but recent 
scholarship has now called this into doubt, stating that this camp could have housed 
only part of the legion.995 An army was present in Africa from 19 BC and Tacitus 
mentions that two legions were stationed there, of which the Third Augustan must 
have been one and the XII Fulminata probably the other.996 However, from AD 6 the 
legio III Augusta was the only one in Africa. Its main task appears to have been 
surveying the Tunisian mountain ridge from the Tell Atlas to the Oued Medjerda, 
991 The seminal work on the legio III Augusta is Y. le Bohec (1989a) La Troisime Lgion Auguste. 
He has published numerous other articles on the legion and its history in Africa as well as another 
publication on the auxiliaries stationed in Africa: Le Bohec (1989c) Les unites auxiliaires de larme 
romaine en Afrique Proconsulaire et Numidie sous le Haut-Empire. As he himself notes, see Le 
Bohec (2000) 373, this legion has been greatly overlooked by scholars, with the exception of M.P.

evidence connected to the Third Augustan, victory commemorations, dates to the 
Augustan era and the latest is dated to 244/5, namely religious dedications.998  
The legio III Augusta was first stationed about two and a half kilometres 
from Vaga from where two strategic routes through Africa were created in the 
Tiberian period, one from Tacape to Ammaedara and one to Lepcis Magna further 
inland.999 Caligula transferred control of the legion from the proconsul to a legate 
and also established a defensive system around Cirta, with the main emphasis on the 
camp at Ain Phua and other local garrisons.1000  The legion was possibly moved to 
Ammaedara where it was garrisoned up to AD 75, leading to a revolt by the local 
population.1001 From there the Third Augustan was moved to Theveste in AD 75, 
where the legion remained until the late Trajanic or early Hadrianic period. 
Ammaedara became a colony in AD 76 which may have been linked to the legions 
move.1002 The move led to the creation of further defensive lines around the army 
headquarters, with new outposts being founded. Carthage and Cuicul were the main 
posts of the Ammaedara defensive system and garrisons were installed at Mascula, 
Henchir el-Hammam, and Lambaesis around Theveste.1003  
The legion moved to Lambaesis where it remained until the end of the 3rd 
century AD.1004 It is not known when exactly the legion moved here but Le Bohec 
suggests between AD 115 and 120.1005 Theveste also became a colony at the end of 
Trajans reign and, as with Ammaedara, this may have been connected to the

prefers the usage of the term defensive system. The Oued Medjerda was also referred to as Bagradas.

legions departure.1006 Hadrian himself visited Africa and Lambaesis, the then 
general quarters of the legion, in AD 128.1007 During its period in Africa the legion 
had to deal with numerous local revolts but also vastly expanded Roman territory, 
eventually controlling most of the north of the African continent, consisting of four 
provinces: Africa Proconsularis, Numidia, Mauretania Caesariensis, and Mauretania 
Tingitana via numerous forts and garrisons stationed across these frontiers.1008 From 
the Trajanic era the Aurasian defensive systems were in place and did not need to 
develop much further. This included the legions headquarters at Lambaesis and 
outposts at Tfilzi, Vazaivi, Mascula, Aquae Flavinanae (?), Casae, Vazubi, Zarai, ad 
Calceum Herculis, two burgii speculatorii, Zebaret et Tir, Mchaieb, Henchir 
Sellaouine, the camp at Montagne de Sel, the one at Confluent and Gemellae, and an 
unknown post.1009 Also at this time, the defensive lines from the Sahara to Numidia 
were in place which included six new forts at Ad Maiores, El-Gahra, An Rich, 
Castellum Dimmidi, Gemellae, and Hammam du Charef.1010  
The legion only slowly expanded out of Numidia and defensive systems are 
found in Tripolitania from the time of Commodus onwards with outposts at Henchir 
Mgarine, Vezereos, Tisawar, Henchir Medeina, Remada, and Si Aoun. The military 
frontiers moved further into Africa under Severus and garrisons were established at 
Zella, Waddan, Tagrifit, Bu Njem, Gasr Zerzi, the two Gheriats, An el-Avenia, and 
Ghademes.1011 In the Hadrianic period, there were numerous posts occupied by 
soldiers, but only a few are now known and only two with any certainty, namely

in the pre-Hadrianic period.1012 The expansion, especially to the south and into 
Tripolitania, reached its apogee under the Severans, and Septimius Severus also 
created the official province of Numidia.1013 As Le Bohec points out, the legio III 
Augusta was the army belonging to a province which had not officially been created 
yet, although the legion was referred to in various ways such as exercitus Africae.1014 
The legion was disbanded for political reasons in AD 238 and re-founded in AD 
253.1015 
5.4.2 The Religion of the legio III Augusta 
Thus, Roman North Africa was garrisoned for the most part only by the legio 
III Augusta, stationed at Lambaesis in AD 128/9.1016 In the course of the 2nd century 
AD other localities sprang up around Lambaesis, adapting to the presence of the 
legion in the area. Originally the legion may have comprised men primarily of Italian 
origin but later on the legion would have probably recruited locally. The army was 
created for the purpose of war and in order to adapt to a peacetime and more settled 
situation, the legion changed both the secular and the sacred space around it to suit 
its purposes, outlining its territory, which included an infrastructure and hydraulic 
system.1017 From the moment of settlement, religious space was created for the 
1012 Le Bohec (2003) 42. A cohort was stationed in Carthage and there was a fort in Gemellae. 
1013 Le Bohec (1989a) 395; Le Bohec (2000) 375n40: a Commodan date may be preferred for the 
installation of the legion in Tripolitania but the greatest expansion and advance into the area happened 
under Severus as Tertullian and the foundation of forts at Bu Njem (see above), Gheriat, and 
Ghadames show.

1016 CIL 8.2534; Benseddik (2009) 239 has noted that scholars have mainly paid attention in the past 
to the placing of the military and the defensive lines, paying little attention to the religious life in 
Africa. Lambaesis is modern Tazzoult in Algeria.

traditional military Roman gods, such as Disciplina, the military genii, and the cult 
of the emperor. The Graeco-Roman gods Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Mercury, Demeter, 
Diana, Cybele, Hercules, Asclepius, Hygeia, Venus, Mars, Isis, and Serapis were all 
worshipped in Africa.1018  
Pro Salute dedications were also very common and are attested from the 
early principate to the late 2nd-early 3rd century AD.1019 These are found together 
with most deities, for example Jupiter Dolichenus, and Asclepius and Victory.1020 
However, they are most commonly found in conjunction with Jupiter Optimus 
Maximus and Fishwick states that its use could either be of a general or a specific 
nature. In the latter case, this was usually as a result of conspiracies and other 
calamitous events which threaten the emperor and, therefore, the stability of the 
Empire.1021 Fishwick also comments that pro salute dedications in Roman Africa 
often invoke gods with an African character, for example Pluto Augustus, together 
with gods such as Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which he states shows a realisation on 
the dedicators part that he was a member of an Empire who should express loyalty 
to the emperor, as the stability of the orbis Romanus depended on the emperors 
wellbeing.1022 Dedicators were here, thus, combining regional with global religious 
elements. 
From the moment of settlement, the Third Augustan legion defined their 
religious space. There was a religious communality within the camp focussed on 
traditional beliefs but oriental gods such as Jupiter Dolichenus and Mithras were also

god in North Africa between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD where they are possible to date.  
worshipped by the legion.1023 Deities with connections to Africa such as Neptune, 
Ceres, and Saturn (see above) were also supplicated by the legio, which consisted, 
later on, mainly of locally recruited troops.1024 However, the officers were mainly of 
a non-African origin and it was precisely this group which was the most mobile and 
facilitated the spread of cults.1025 Archaeological and epigraphic evidence indicates 
that Lambaesis grew to be the administrative, military, and religious centre of North 
Africa.1026 Benseddik states that Asclepius and Hygeia dominated the pantheon here 
because of the importance of the sanctuary and the number of dedications.1027 
Dedications were made to the gods here by legates and provincial governors, 
amongst others, further attesting to their prominence.1028 The Asclepieion became an 
important healing centre with soldiers from all across the province dedicating there 
and seeking the gods help.1029 
A vexillium was sent from Lambaesis to Bu Njem, where dedications were 
found within the camp to traditional Roman deities such as Fortuna, Salus, Jupiter 
and the genius of the place. Dedications found outside the camp proper were solely 
to Libyan syncretic gods, namely Mars Canaphar and Jupiter Hammon, indicating 
that they were probably also supplicated by the local population.1030 These deities 
1023 Benseddik (2009) 239; Hilali (2007) 482-5. There was also a public cult of Caelestis to whom a 
temple had been built by the legate Claudius Gallus in AD 202-5: AE 2010.1834. For more on 
Mithras see Chapter 4. 
1024 These are gods who were either worshipped from early on in Africa or enjoyed extensive cult 
here. Dio. Sic. 11.21.4 mentions a sacrifice made to Neptune in North Africa and Cadotte (2007) 312-
314 table 16 lists 51 inscriptions dedicated to the god. The cult of the Cereres was founded early on in 
Africa in the 4th century BC as Dio. Sic. 14.70.77 narrates, who states that the Carthaginians 
introduced the cult to Carthage in order to atone to the goddesses after they sacked their sanctuary in 
Syracus in 396 BC. Cadotte (2007) 348-352 table 18 lists 88 inscriptions erected to the goddesses in 
Africa. Cadotte (2007) 25 states that Baal Hammon was twinned with Cronos, the Greek version of 
Saturn, in the 5th century BC in Africa. In table 1, p. 30-37, Cadotte lists 129 inscriptions dedicated to 
Saturn dating to between the 1st century BC to the 4th AD; Benseddik (2009) 253.

were not chosen by chance as Jupiter Hammon protected travellers and caravans, 
upon whom Bu Njem was dependant for economy and trade.1031 Not much is known 
about Canaphar, other than that he was probably another version of the god Sinipher, 
who was a god of war and shared many characteristics with Canaphar and Mars.1032 
Here there was a combination of traditional and local gods, chosen for their 
suitability for the indigenous and also military population. African architecture was 
also introduced and Libyan temples erected on the camp peripheries. Seventeen 
dedications were made by soldiers from the legion in Tripolitania, which were a 
mixture of private and group, and also to both Roman and oriental gods.1033  
Having examined religion in the Roman army generally (see section 4.1.1), 
and also the religion of the legio III Augusta, the rest of the chapter will now focus 
on the impact of the Roman army on the cult of Asclepius in Roman North Africa.  
5.4.3 The legio III Augusta and Asclepius 
Soldiers followed their set hierarchical, collective way of life in many aspects 
of their off-duty existence, including religion, which meant that many dedications 
erected by soldiers were not always done by individuals but by groups (see Chapter 
4).1034 Asclepius would have been a natural deity for soldiers to worship but they 
also supplicated long lists of deities, and often dedicated to All the Gods, adding to

Apollo and Diana provided a divine health service during the early empire but 
Asclepius soon took over from them and was quite popular, in military as in civilian 
life, and was favoured by soldiers, for example at Lambaesis where there was a large 
Asclepieion built onto the camp walls.1036  
5.4.4 Lambaesis  
Lambaesis is located in a small valley, and was probably chosen for its 
strategic position, abundance of water sources and forests, as well as a good 
climate.1037 The legio III Augusta moved its headquarters from Theveste to 
Lambaesis. It is not known precisely when this transfer took place but Le Bohec

1036 Benseddik (2005) 275. Two altars to Apollo dating to AD 121-3 were found at Lambaesis making 
Benseddik argue that there was originally a temple to Apollo on site as was the case with other 
sanctuaries such as at Epidaurus. However, given the late date of the foundation of the temple here 
this seems unlikely as by this time Asclepius was already well established as the healing god of the 
Graeco-Roman world and had already been worshipped by the military for some time as well. Two 
altars also does not seem enough to argue for the existence of a temple as they could have been 
dedicated within the Asclepieian context, due to the familial relations between the two gods: AE 1920 
37; AE 1913 24.

suggests sometime between AD 115 and 117, as is indicated by numismatic evidence 
and a mention in Claudius Ptolemys Geography about a legion stationed at 
Lambaesis.1038 There was already a military outpost in place in Lambaesis prior to 
the official move of the headquarters, as the camp here, the so-called camp of Titus, 
was built between 1st July and 13th September AD 81 and the camp site was chosen 
by the propraetorian legate Lucius Tettius Iulianus.1039 The original excavations of 
the site were badly documented, leading scholars to be uncertain whether there had 
been any prior settlement before the foundation of the camp and the legions arrival 
as there was no evidence for this apart from a few coins featuring Numidian kings 
found in the area.1040 Janon states that the place name Lambaesis is not of Latin 
origin but belongs to a group of names in central Numidia which start with Lam-, for 
example Lambiodi, Lamsorti, and Lamigig. In fact, 80% of the cities in Numidia had 
a Libyan origin.1041 However, after a recent series of excavations, a vast ensemble of 
protohistorical funerary ware has been discovered in the highlands of Ain Drinn 
confirming that the site of Lambaesis was settled prior to the arrival of the Third 
Augustan Legion.1042

The city of Lambaesis grew around the camp and became a municipium at 
the end of the 2nd century AD before it became a colonia between AD 246 and 252 
(Fig. 90).1043 It was divided into the upper and lower city with the grand camp 
located in the lower city. The camp was 500 meters long and 420 meters wide and 
had a wall constructed around it, separating it from the city.1044 The best known 
structures in the upper city were the Capitoline temple and a temple to an unknown 
god, which Janon states can be securely identified as a temple of the cult of the 
1043 Janon (1977) 9.  
1044 Janon (1977) 5. 
emperor on the basis of an unpublished inscription.1045 Other sanctuaries in the city 
were a nymphaeum, a temple to Isis and Serapis, a Mithraeum, a temple to Dea 
Africa, and the Asclepieion.1046 The Asclepieion was built against the southern wall 
of the camp of Titus and is demarcated by a wadi in the west and the Via Septimiana 
in the east.1047 Surprisingly, the earliest evidence for a healing cult in Lambaesis is 
not for that of Asclepius, but two altars which were dedicated to Apollo Salutifer, 
dated to AD 123.1048 Between AD 143 and 146 Asclepius replaced his father as 
healing god on this site. The first evidence for the cult of Asclepius on site was a 
dedication by a Gaius Prastina Messalinus who dedicated a pool to Asclepius and 
Hygeia between AD 143 and 146 (Figs. 91-92):

1049 AE 1989.870: Gaius Prastina Messalinus and associates consecrated a pool to Asclepius and

Messalinus was a legatus who was attested in Lambaesis, Timgad, and Aquae 
Flavianae where he dedicated to the nymphs.1050 This inscription has long been taken 
as a sign of the introduction of the cult here.1051 The nature of this dedication is 
private and there is no architectural evidence which points to a temple or sanctuary 
of the god at this point. Temples were common cultic accessories as they were 
houses of the gods and also acted as treasuries but they were expensive to build so, 
as a cult developed, more cultic amenities could be added later on. Therefore, it is 
possible that a cult of Asclepius was already present on site prior to the building of 
the temple but that there is no evidence for it.  
The temple of Asclepius was not built until AD 162 and it had a very unusual 
floor plan (Figs. 93-94): 
1050 CIL 8.2535-2541, 18044, 17851, 17893, 17723.

Fig. 93: Reconstructed drawing of the Asclepieion. 
Fig. 94: Aerial Photo of the Lambaesis Asclepieion. 
The temple is divided into three parts, of which the central structure was dedicated to 
Asclepius and Salus, the Latin version of Hygeia. The two side chapels were 
dedicated to Jupiter Valens and Silvanus Pegasianus.1052 These two side structures 
used the Corinthian order but the temple of Asclepius used the Doric order, which 
rarely occurs in North Africa. It seems that this order was used to signal something 
about Asclepius and not about the legion per se as at Bu Njem, where a vexillium 
had been sent, other orders combined with African elements were used for temple 
architecture (see section 5.4.2).1053 This order could have been used to either connect 
the god here to the Epidaurian version of Asclepius, or maybe to distinguish 
Asclepius from local healing gods.1054 Janon suggests that the Doric order was also 
linked with, and refers to, the tradition of Greek medicine, as numerous healing 
temples such as the Asclepieia in Athens, Cos, Epidaurus, and Messene, and also the 
temple of Apollo Epicures at Bassae, used this order.1055 Greek gods had been 
present in Africa, especially in Carthage, since the Hellenistic ages, either brought 
there directly from Greece or indirectly via Magna Graecia and Alexandria.1056  
 The temple has four columns which supported an inscribed architrave, 
identifying the temple (Figs. 95-96):

As the co-rule of Marcus and Verus is mentioned in the inscription, the temple can 
be dated to between AD 161 and 169. Two dedications to Jupiter Valens and 
Silvanus were placed in the foundation mouldings which reduces the possible 
construction period to between AD 161-2 as the dedicator Decimus Fonteius 
Frontianus Lucius Stertinius Refinus was legatus of the legion between 160 and 
161.1058 Janon believes that the temple was built for use by the legionaries here. 
Benseddik argues that the profound attachment of Marcus to Asclepius was probably 
reason enough to erect the sanctuary here but it could also be tentatively placed in 
the context of the plague which spread through the empire at this time.1059 The order 
in which the gods are named here is significant as Jupiters name occurs above the 
entrance to his chapel. The inscriptions were structured and created thus, that the 
names of the gods appeared above the entrances to their respective temples and it 
also allowed for the association between Asclepius, Salus, and the emperors.1060 
Janon gives the following schema to understand the layout of the inscription with 
regard to the temple1061: 
IOVI VALENTI  AESCULAPIO ET SALUTI    SILVANO 
  IMP.CAES.M.AURELIUS AUG.PONT.MAX.ET 
  IMP. CAES.L.AURELIUS VERUS AUGUSTUS 
HAS AEDES       PER LEG III FECERUNT 
The name of the god would thus correspond to the physical placement of his temple. 
1058 CIL 8.18089; Janon (1985) 83; PIR2 A.472 p.199. He was perhaps consul in AD 162 or 163. 
1059 Benseddik (2010a) 2.109: she does not explain why Marcus Aurelius should have such an 
attachment to Asclepius, apart from the plague which occurred during his reign. Renberg (2006/7) 
125 mentions that Aurelius also went to the Pergamene shrine: Fronto Ep. 3.10.2. See also M. Aur. 
Med. 1.17.20 which could refer to dreams sent by Asclepius. 
1060 Benseddik (2010a) 2.121. 
1061 Janon (1985) 69. 
North of the Asclepieion were eight sacella dedicated to various gods, for 
example the dii patrii, Medaurus, Iarhibl, the genius of Colonia Cirta, and Jupiter 
Bazocenus, and to the south, next to the chapel of Jupiter Valens there was a small 
temple to Aquae Silnuessaniae.1062 Why this temple was placed here is unclear but 
Pliny mentions that the waters there were thought to be especially good for curing 
women from infertility and men from madness. Imhotep-Asclepius specialised in 
fertility and was thanked by Ptolemy VI Philopater and Cleopatra for granting them 
a son (see section 3.1.2).1063 This could be the connecting factor between the two 
localities. Inscriptions found in the camp attest to a second Mithraeum and a cult of 
the genius Vici. In the smaller camp at Djebel Asker there was a temple to Minerva 
and in other places in the area there were cults to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Jupiter 
Heliopolitanus, Caelestis, Mercury, Dii Mauri, Neptune and many others.1064 Saturn 
was the main African deity worshipped in the region of Lambaesis where there were 
three sanctuaries to him. 
The collective nature of military dedications (see Chapter 4) also occurs here 
as it aptly shown in an inscription from the Asclepieion at Lambaesis (Fig. 97): 
Religiosi / qui stipem / ad Aescula/pium pone/re volunt / in thes/aurarium / mittant / 
ex quibus / aliquod / donum / Aescula/pio fiat.1065 
1062 Medaurus was Dalmatian, Iarhibl came from Palmyra, the genius of Colonia Cirta, now 
Constantine in Algeria: Janon (1977) 15-6. Silnuessa was a famous bathing complex near Naples. See 
Le Bohec (1989a) 566-7 for a tabulated list of dedications to these gods.

collection bowl and we will make some sort of offering to Aesculapius with it.; Le Bohec (1989b) 
Fig. 97: AE 2003 2021. 
This inscription was found in a cistern in the camp and is undated. The inscription 
concerns the erection of a future dedication to Asclepius, calling upon any soldiers 
who want to, to put money into a bowl, which will provide the funds for the 
dedications. Le Bohec imagines the thesaurus to be a bowl but it is unknown what 
form this actually took, as it is no longer extant.1066 It concerns a collective military 
dedication. The terminology used in this dedication is important and Christol and 
Janon have pointed out that the term stips was also used in a dedication to Asclepius 
from Rome.1067 They argue that religiosi indicates not a general invitation for anyone 
to give money, but that this is aimed at donors from a specific and closely defined 
group of people. The inscription points these people in the direction of Asclepius and 
indicates that as the act is voluntary so those who dedicate funds are the most 
religious of this delineated group of potential worshippers. It is because they are the 
most religious that they are mentioned by the inscription.1068 The inscription, thus, 
shows a very exclusive group of worshippers in this case.  
1066 Le Bohec (1989b) 237.  
1067 CIL 6.7; AE 1987 53; Christol and Janon (2002) 77.  
1068 Christol and Janon (2002) 78; Cicero De Nat 2.72 states that the religiosi are the most pious of 
worshippers. 
At Lambaesis the majority of the inscriptions erected in the Asclepieion were 
dedicated by individuals who were members of the military. Yet, it seems that in 
general the collective nature of military life prompted soldiers to make dedications 
together. Examples of this within the cult of Asclepius are inscriptions, such as the 
one mentioned above and the foundation inscription of the cult at Lambaesis. Yet, an 
inscription has also been found in Lambaesis which fits in with other collective 
dedications such as one from Rome, where a group of Thracian soldiers who were 
part of the praetorian cohort erected a dedication to the syncretic god Asclepius 
Zimidrenus together (see section 4.4).1069 This dedication does not mention a specific 
god to whom the soldiers dedicated it, making it possible that they were worshipping 
Asclepius, due to its location in the temple of Asclepius, or as Fishwick has argued 
that it was set up for the domus divina, which seems the more likely option:1070 
1069 CIL 6.2799. 
1070 Fishwick (1990) 336-337. The inscription was found in situ in the temple and was not taken to 
either the temple or the camp of Titus as was long thought: Benseddik (2010a) 2.136 no.45.

Further parallels with the worship of other gods often found around military sites, 
such as Mithras to whom there was a sanctuary in the Lambaesis camp, can also be 
made. With regards to officers making dedications, it is useful to examine the cult of 
Jupiter Dolichenus (see section 1.1.8) as Collar has argued that officers were the 
main disseminators of the cult, as they were the most mobile, and that the lower 
ranks then picked up this worship from them. It is possible that the same happened 
here with Asclepius, as most of the dedicators listed in the Table 10 below were 
officers or officials. However, Asclepius openness to worship from the lower socio-
economic strata should not be forgotten either. This emphasises why it is important 
to examine the global nature of Asclepius as well as his regional and sanctuary-based 
aspects.  
At Lambaesis, there seems to have been a room to incubate in, prior to which 
supplicants would purify themselves, and would also sacrifice to the god.1072 The 
temple was used frequently and for a long period of time as is attested by the great 
number of epigraphic sources, by legionaries, officers, and legati.1073 No medical 
instruments, ex-votos, or inscriptions similar to the Epidaurian iamata were found 
here, although there is a relatively rich cache of epigraphic dedications.1074 There is a 
strong military element to the dedications to Asclepius at Lambaesis. Most of the 
inscriptions to Asclepius and other gods, erected in or near the Asclepieion, had a 
soldier or an official as their dedicator, where this is mentioned (see Table 12). 
Legati most frequently dedicated to the gods but other titles also occur. It is 
1072 Benseddik (2010a) 2.113.  
1073 Christol and Janon (2002) 73.  
1074 Benseddik (2010a) 2.115: the lack of anatomical ex-votos is unsurprising as this dedicatory habit 
fell out of practice in the late 2nd century BC.  
sometimes hard to identify which structures were civilian and which military in 
Lambaesis. However, the cult here had strong military overtones:

Table 10: Inscriptions found in the area of the Asclepieion. 
One dedication from the above Table 10 stands out from the others as the spelling 
Escolapio is used, something very rare and seemingly unique (Fig. 98):1075 
Di{i}s Salutari/bus Escolapio / et Hygiae quo/rum ope adver/sae valetudines / 
propelluntur Domi/tius Zenofilus() v(ir) c(larissimus) / cons(ularis) sexfascalis 
p(rovinciae) N(umidiae) sacrum reli/gionis suae iux/ta eos indici/um dedit / 
Curetii.1076 
1075 This spelling has been ignored/corrected by corpora editors in the past who change it to fit with 
the traditional spelling of Asclepius name, namely: (A)esc<u=O>lapio.  
1076AE 2003 2022/AE 2010 88: To the healing gods Asclepius and Hygeia through whose help the 
enemies of the healthy were defeated, Domitius Zenofilus, vir clarissimus, consul sexfascalis of the 
province of Numidia, gave a sacred sign of his own religious observances among them. The people 
from Cures [dedicated this]. Sexfascalis does not occur in literary sources but is found in numerous 
inscriptions from North Africa in the second half of the 4th century AD. Here, they state that the 
govenor holds this title as part of the formula consularis sexfascalis provinciae Numidiae: Cotton 
(2000) 230 n. 48; AE 1888.30, 1885.108, 1902.166, 1909.220, 1911.110, 1913.23, 1913.35; 
1917/18.58, 1936.30, 1946.107, 1946.110, 1987.1062, 1987.1082, 1987.1083; CIL 8.7015, 8.7034, 
8.7975, 8.10870, 8.17896, 8.19502.  
Fig. 98: AE 2003 2022. 
A clear explanation for why this spelling was used is not clear but it was perhaps an 
error or perhaps a deliberate attempt at archaising Asclepius name. The inscription 
was set up by a Domitius Zenofilus whose career is well known as he was corrector 
provincae Siciliae.1077 Zenofilus is also attested as proconsul of Africa, signalling the 
high status of this dedicator.1078 Curetius possibly comes from Cures, a Sabine city 
where Zenofilus was governor in AD 320. The word Cureti also occurs on another 
inscription which mentions Zenofilus from Lilybaeum:  
Cureti vivas / pro meritis eximiae lenitatis et benignae administrationis / strenuo ac 
praedicabili iudici / Domitio Zenofilo / v(iro) c(larissimo) corr(ectori) prov(inciae) 
Sicil(iae) / 1079  
1077 CIL 10.7234. 
1078 CIL 8.1408; Christol and Janon (2002) 81-82.  
1079 CIL 10.7234. The man from Cures, for services of extraordinary leniency and obliging 
administration, vigorous and praiseworthy judge, Domitius Zenofilus, illustrious man and corrector of 
the province of Sicily. 
The Curetii were trying to honour their erstwhile administrator Zenofilus. Perhaps 
with the inscription to Asclepius they added these gods as Asclepius was locally the 
most popular god in Lambaesis, or he had suffered from an illness from which the 
Curetii hoped he would recover or were honouring the gods as he had already 
recovered. This inscription shows the interconnected nature of mobility and 
communication. Zenofilus, as a high ranking official, was highly mobile and held 
various offices across the empire. Zenofilus must have been stationed at Cures first, 
which was then probably followed by his post in Sicily and then lastly in Africa.1080 
In doing so, he illustrates the high levels of mobility, similar to what was argued by 
Collar with regards to officers (see section 1.1.8) and which played such an 
important role in the dissemination of Asclepius through the Balkan and Danube 
provinces by the army (see Chapter 4). In keeping the connections between 
themselves and Zenofilus alive, the Curetii both honoured him but also promoted 
themselves as being connected with Zenofilus, perhaps in a way not dissimilar to 
Xenophon and Claudius. If so then the Curetii would have probably chosen 
Asclepius as he was a locally important god. There was no direct connection 
between Zenofilus and Asclepius as the god is not mentioned in the inscription from 
Lilybaeum. However, the inscription set up by the Curetii from Lambaesis makes it 
clear that Zenofilus was ill and then recovered due to the intercession of Asclepius 
and Hygeia, which is conveyed by the quorum ope in the inscription. The Curetii 
then erected a dedication in thanks for this cure at Lambaesis as that is where 
Zenofilus must have been stationed at that time.  
5.4.5 Lambaesis and Epidaurus 
1080 PLRE 1.993. 
Despite the fact that the legio III Augusta probably had an Italian origin, 
Benseddik draws attention to the possible connections between Epidaurus and 
Lambaesis. Lambaesis was, according to her, the epicentre of the dissemination of 
the cult of Asclepius in Africa.1081 This was probably the case for the cult in Numidia 
but maybe not so for the cult in Proconsularis. Benseddik uses the fact that at 
Lambaesis, in the south portico of the Asclepieion, a statue group of Asclepius and a 
dog was found, the only such representation to be found in Africa.1082 This 
Asclepieian iconography was especially linked to the Epidaurian cult-statue of the 
god by Phrasymedes (see Fig. 43).1083 However, this statue was lost soon after it was 
found and no images of it remain.1084 There is only a short note of it in the original 
excavation notes, which compare it to the statue at Epidaurus, which is also lost but 
known from numismatic evidence. There was also an inscription on the entrance to 
Chapel C bonus intra, melior exi (Fig. 99) which she believes echoes the 
inscription over the entrance to the Epidaurian sanctuary: Pure must be he who 
enters the fragrant temple; purity means to think nothing but holy thoughts.1085

Fig. 99: Mosaic from Lambaesis. CIL 8.2584. 
The mosaic and inscription would connect the two sanctuaries across the 
Mediterranean with their express messages of purity. While the inscriptions 
definitely echo each others message, there was such a stress on purity within the 
cult in general that this was perhaps simply part of the cults general nature. It is 
curious that there would be such an emphasis on the Epidaurian origins of the cult 
here, as was stated in an inscription from Carthage, when the legion came from 
Rome. It would have been far simpler to state that the legion took the Roman version 
of the god with them to Africa. The Roman cult was an off-shoot of the Epidaurian 
cult so perhaps they did take the Roman god with them but had an awareness of the 
mythological past of the cult and, therefore, called it an Epidaurian cult which could 
have also given it an extra sense of authenticity. As stated above, when the legion 
first came to Africa, it was probably made up of Italian soldiers though later the 
lower ranks were recruited locally while the officers would still have come from 
other parts of the empire, which might provide a possible explanation for the 
Epidaurian connections.1086 Whitmarsh has argued that provincials reacted to the 
global Roman Empire by becoming more regional.1087 However, this would assume 
that it was only people in the provinces who had to adapt to the new reality of 
Empire and the culture and customs of the Romans. Yet, for the original legionaries 
Africa would also have been a foreign place and they in turn could have reacted to 
this new reality of Empire by reviving ancient rites of their own. The cult of 
Asclepius at Rome was an off-shoot of the Epidaurian cult, as was stated in 
numerous sources (see section 2.2.5).1088 It is possible that the legionaries sought to 
come to terms with their new reality of Empire by resuscitating ancient customs. In 
doing so, they reached back into the past, further back than the creation of the cult at 
Rome, and sought to import the cult from Epidaurus which was thought to be the 
oldest and one of the most powerful cults of Asclepius. The soldiers themselves 
would be reacting to the new Empire and their foreign surroundings by connecting 
with the ancient past. This would fit in with theories on the pericentric Empire which 
were presented in Chapter One, where Nederveen Pieterse argued that Romans were 
both globalising and globalised and that the latter was a result of the former. During 
this process the cultures and religions of the provinces were taken up by the Romans 
and were then, in turn, transported to new provinces.1089 The Roman socio-religious 
and cultural identities which came to the provinces were, therefore, not purely 
Roman, but were those which had already come into contact with other provincial 
cultures before they were then again taken to new lands. Thus, in Africa, the claimed 
Epidaurian origins of the cult of Asclepius could be a combination of the identity and 
nature of the cult in Rome combined with elements from Greece. This would 
1086 Le Bohec (2000) 378; Collar (2011) 228; Mattingly (1987) 8. The Italian origins can be surmised 
from the fact that the legion was first attested under Lepidus: Le Bohec (1989a) 337.

1088 See, for example, Livy Per. 11. 
1089 Nederveen Pieterse (2015) 233. 
indicate a more multi-faceted and layered approach to the cult in the Roman world 
that was previously explored and combines various strands of current theories on 
globalism in antiquity to show a possible actual application of these in antiquity.   
Benseddik states that the army and its officials introduced the cult to Africa 
but did not have the power or desire to force its dissemination there. This is why the 
cult differed in nature in each province. She argues that the cult was the most diverse 
in Africa Proconsularis, where the god was worshipped in Carthage by officials, 
slaves, priests, and freedmen alike, similar to the province of Narbonensis, which 
was a bulwark of Roman and Hellenistic culture. This indicates that the cult in 
Proconsularis perhaps had a wider socio-economic cross-section of worshippers, 
whereas the cult in Numidia was mostly frequented by soldiers and officials. A cult 
of Asclepius was introduced to a locality but then this cult adapted to suit local needs 
and preferences. This cult would keep the global aspects which made Asclepius who 
he was but they were free to choose which elements of the cult were best suited for 
that region. Following Whitmarsh (see section 1.1.2), it was the introduction of the 
global god Asclepius which seems to have prompted the creation of a regional 
version of this god, as he argues that regionalism needs globalism to define itself 
against. Even though the Roman army allegedly introduced the cult to this area, the 
flexibility of the cult to the worshippers needs would have remained the same. This 
is perhaps even more so if the cult of Eshmun-Asclepius was already present in 
Africa, and the Roman cult of Asclepius was introduced at a later stage, making 
Numidia a stronghold of the military Asclepius and Proconsularis one of Eshmun-
Asclepius. 
5.5 The Cultic Differences between Proconsularis and Numidia 
 This chapter has explored the cults of Asclepius in Roman North Africa, both 
in Africa Proconsularis and in Numidia. It explored the history of both the cult of 
Eshmun-Asclepius and the god who was worshipped by the soldiers of the legio III 
Augusta in Numidia and Lambaesis. It has become clear that both these cults had 
very different histories and characters. Eshmun-Asclepiuss strong-hold was 
Carthage and the Carthaginian lands, whereas the military Asclepius was located 
more in Numidia. The former cult seems to have been brought over from Sicily 
whereas the latter was said to have come from Epidaurus. 
There are further elements which set the two apart. The two deities were 
associated with different gods, Eshmun-Asclepius with Cybele and Dionysus and 
Asclepius mainly with Salus, Jupiter Valens and Silvanus Pegasianus. The 
dedications erected to the gods differ as those in Numidia were predominantly set up 
by members of the military, including many legati, and there is also a strong 
collective element to these which was lacking in the more individualistic dedications 
from Proconsularis. The temples belonged to different styles, with those in 
Proconsularis in general being more frequent in number but also being round in 
shape in Carthage and Thugga. The temple at Lambaesis had a unique tri-part plan 
and was apparently the only temple in Africa which used the Doric order, an order 
which was strongly connected with healing deities and also Epidaurus. The 
connection between Epidaurus and Lambaesis also shown by a statue iconography of 
the seated god which directly recalls the Epidaurian cult-statue and also the strong 
emphasis on purity with two inscriptions which seemingly echo each others 
message.  
It would, therefore, appear that there were two distinct cults of Asclepius in 
Roman North Africa. One which was more civilian in nature, located in Africa 
Proconsularis and which had its roots in the syncretism between Eshmun and 
Asclepius. The other was brought to Africa along with the Third Augustan legion 
and had strong military connections as well as links to Epidaurus. The increased 
mobility of the Roman Empire facilitated the introduction of this second god. 
Therefore, it would seem, that the Roman Empire aided the creation of religious 
diversity in a region via its high levels of mobility. 
5.6 Conclusion 
This chapter has examined the cults of Asclepius in Roman North Africa and has 
aimed to show that there was a duality in the worship of the god here. On the one 
hand there was the god Eshmun-Asclepius who was one of the most important gods 
of the future province of Africa Proconsularis. The centre of this gods worship was 
in Carthage, from where he was disseminated across the areas under Carthaginian 
control. This god was both a healer and a protector of the city, as is shown especially 
by the location of his temple on the Acropolis of Carthage. Asclepius had been 
brought here during the classical era and assimilated with Eshmun as is shown by 
iconographical, architectural, and numismatic evidence. These also indicate the non-
military nature of later dedications and inscriptions relating to Asclepius. There is 
only one inscription erected in Proconsularis which can be directly connected to a 
member of the Roman army. This was in contrast to Numidia where these are far 
more numerous, indicating that the cult of Asclepius in Africa Proconsularis likely 
was of a civilian nature. At Lambaesis in Numidia the inscriptions to Asclepius all 
clearly state the military post occupied by the dedicator. Only one dedication to 
Hygeia alone does not give any name or occupation. The inscriptions, thus, clearly 
indicate the military connections with the cult here, in contrast to Carthage and 
Africa Proconsularis where these barely occur or are not mentioned in the 
dedications. Benseddik claimed that the Roman army was one of the main factors 
behind Asclepius dissemination across Africa. The available evidence indicates that 
the cult in Numidia was dominated by military worshippers. This does not seem to 
have been the case in Proconsularis, where the Asclepius worshipped was Eshmun-
Asclepius and not the military Asclepius.  
There are also further aspects which set the gods apart from each other. In 
Numidia, Asclepius was worshipped alone or with Hygeia but is not found 
worshipped with other gods. Even in Lambaesis where a temple was set up to 
Asclepius and Hygeia, Jupiter Valens, and Silvanus Pegasianus, the latter two gods 
were worshipped in separate chapels which were differentiated architecturally from 
the temple of Asclepius by their use of another order. In Africa Proconsularis 
Asclepius was found together with a number of other gods such as Cybele, a 
partnership which rarely occurs outside Africa. The syncretism with Eshmun 
explains this as these two gods were twinned, as were Cybele and Astarte, and 
Astarte and Eshmun were commonly worshipped together. There was also a 
difference in the dedicatory habits of the worshippers in the two provinces as there 
was a far greater percentage of temples dedicated to Asclepius in Africa 
Proconsularis than there were in Numidia.1090 This was perhaps because the military 
supplicants were smaller in number in general than the civilian worshippers of the 
god.  There were also more inscriptions dedicated to Asclepius in Proconsularis but 
1090 Laurence and Trifil (2015) 110. 
more statues set up in Numidia, indicating further regional differences between the 
two provinces. This also would argue against Benseddiks statement as it is it does 
not fully take the regional differences within the cult into account. The cult of 
Asclepius in general in Africa differs from those in other parts of the Roman Empire. 
This is in part due to its distinct iconography in the form of the Tunis type, but also 
the fact that Apollo was worshipped at a number of sites prior to the introduction of 
Asclepius, despite Asclepius already being firmly established as the healing god of 
the Graeco-Roman world. The large number of bathing complexes in Africa and the 
number of statues of Asclepius, represented in the Tunis or Campana type, and 
Hygeia found here are also noteworthy.  
The study of epithets indicates that it was possible for the various functions of 
the god to operate separately from each other and that, even though one aspect of the 
god was pleased with a supplicants actions, another aspect could be displeased. 
Xenophons failure to sacrifice to Zeus Meilichios even though he had offered to 
Zeus Basileus is often quoted as evidence supporting this.1091 Each Zeus was 
perceived to be a different Zeus.1092 Applying this theory to the cults of Asclepius, 
this would indicate that not all versions of the god had to be the same god. Section 
2.3 has argued that Asclepius only started to receive epithets from the Hellenistic 
period and that this practice boomed under the Roman Empire. The nature of the 
worshippers in Africa seems to indicate not just two aspects of the same god but two 
different gods. Whoever introduced a god to an area would have had a significant 
impact upon the nature of that cult and military worshippers had very different needs 
from civilian supplicants. Versnel argues that Graeco-Roman gods bearing the same 
1091 Xen. An. 7.8.3-4. 
1092 A contemporary example of this phenomenon comes from Greece where Versnel (2011) 67 
describes a Greek stating that the Hagios Georgios is not the same as those from other places as those 
Georges are from Cappodocia but the Hagios Georgios is from a local place. 
name but different epithets may, but need not, have been perceived as one and the 
same deity depending on the supplicants perceptions.1093 The most important 
function of the name or epithet was then differentiation.1094 This indicates that it was 
possible to have multiple versions of the same god in one place at the same time.  
This chapter has argued that there were not one but two versions of the god 
present in Roman North Africa. The cults of Asclepius and Eshmun-Asclepius 
differed in a number of ways, encompassing the dedicatory habits of worshipers, the 
gods they were associated with, and also the type of dedications offered to them. 
Syncretism was, thus, another way of disseminating the god to the provinces but it 
also shows the impact of the Roman Empire upon the cult in the area, as without the 
expansion of empire, the Third Augustan Legion would have never been transferred 
to Africa and there would have been only one version of Asclepius, Asclepius-
Eshmun. It seems that, in this instance, improved mobility resulted in increased 
religious choice.

Chapter 6: The Impact of the Roman Empire on the Cult of 
Asclepius. Conclusions. 
This study has sought to examine the impact of the Roman Empire on the 
cult of Asclepius. The key questions asked in order to ascertain the extent of this 
impact were: How did the Roman Empire impact upon the cult of Asclepius? By 
which factors did this impact take place? How are global and regional cult identities 
articulated in response to each other as a result of this impact? Did Asclepius 
spheres of influence grow or adapt as a result of Roman benefactions? How did 
increased mobility influence the impact of Empire? and What were the provincial 
responses to Roman worship and dissemination of the cult? Answering these 
questions has been done by the analysis of several factors which were carefully 
analysed and chosen as they showed the greatest impact on the cult, namely Roman 
emperors, courtiers, and the creation of a permanent army. Emperors and the army 
were a direct effect of the creation of the Empire as before the founding of the 
principate these did not exist. This work has aimed to show the ways in which Rome 
took over a Greek cult and adapted it to suit the needs of people both in Rome and in 
the provinces. An examination into regional and global characteristics of the cult 
offers a general overview of how Rome influenced the cult. The first aim of this 
work has been to focus on the cult in the Roman provinces. While it cannot be 
doubted that worship of Asclepius enjoyed a rich and varied history in Greece during 
the Classical and Hellenistic periods, his worship continued for four more centuries 
under the Roman Empire and was disseminated further across the known world than 
before. This broad timespan and vast geographical space must have also created an 
atmosphere in which the cult could flourish. The second and third aims of this thesis 
build on the first as this thesis seeks also to move away from studies which have 
focussed solely on one sanctuary or on one region but has addressed global themes in 
the cult and show the high level of connectivity and mobility within the cult of 
Asclepius. In doing so, it also has examined geographical areas which have 
previously been overlooked or rejected as being irrelevant to study of Asclepius, 
such as the Balkan and Danube provinces. By thematically examining the cult, new 
conclusions can be drawn about how the cult changed over time and how it adapted 
and was changed during the Roman imperial period. A fourth aim is to further reject 
outdated notions of the Empire as a centre and periphery and that culture and religion 
were imposed on the provinces by Rome in a one-directional cultural process. This 
work has shown the multi-directional and cross-provincial nature of socio-cultural 
exchanges and has illustrated that a pericentric model of Empire is preferred and far 
better reflects the exchanges of culture between Rome and the provinces. This is 
done by illustrating the high level of connectivity within the cult and also the ways in 
which cultic elements travelled from one locality to another. This religious influence 
did not just happen in the provinces, but the core cult in Rome and the image of the 
cult of Asclepius, disseminated from Rome, was also changed by coming into 
contact with the cults in the provinces, which, in turn, had changed because of 
contact with Rome. The final aim of this work is to show the role which individual 
choice and agency played within the cult and how individual actors could have a 
great impact on the cult.  
Chapter One has shown why Asclepius is such a suitable paradigm for a 
study into mobility and connectivity. The cult attracted worshippers from all socio-
economic backgrounds and flourished until the 4th century AD. This provides a rich 
cache of evidence from which studies into the cult can be done. The cult also 
enjoyed a wide geographical dissemination. The chapter, furthermore, provided the 
theoretical framework in which this examination has been set. It offered three main 
theoretical arguments as to how the impact of Empire can de detected, via both 
global and regional characteristics in the cult. This thesis aims to examine how the 
cult reacted to coming into contact with the global Roman Empire and it is by 
exploring and identifying these characteristics that this is possible. Three main 
theories as to why regionalism occurred were analysed in this chapter. The first, 
following Whitmarsh (section 1.1.2), argues that the idea of the local was only 
created when people come into contact with the global; that one only became aware 
of their regional identity when a global one had become clear. This contact with 
global identity then led to a readdressing of regional identity. A second explanation 
for globalism comes from Chaniotis (see section 1.1.3) who suggests that civic 
competition was another reason for this as cities strove to create their own identity in 
order to be superior to their neighbouring cities. By coming into contact with their 
neighbours cultures, their own became more important and prominent. A third 
explanation, following Chaniotis again (see section 1.1.4) is that people deliberately 
revived ancient rites, or created those which they claimed were ancient, as a result of 
coming into contact with a global phenomenon. Rpkes emphasis on religion as a 
communicative framework fits in well with these theories as it stresses the 
connectivity which is vital for these regional elements to become visible. It was only 
when people connected with a global culture, such as that from Rome, that they 
questioned and adapted their own regional identities and cultures. Communication, 
connectivity, and mobility are key themes for this thesis as only when one culture 
comes into contact with another are these elements shown. The chapters in this thesis 
have shown how cults of Asclepius reacted and adapted after coming into contact 
with the global Roman Empire but also how new cults, when disseminated to regions 
where the god had not been worshipped previously, changed to suit their new 
surroundings. This spread of cults was not a one-directional religious dialogue and 
the high level of interconnectedness of the Asclepieia has been shown. The cult of 
Asclepius in its core sanctuaries did not remain unaffected by the founding of new 
cult-sites and the adaption of others (see Chapter 2) but the nature of these sites also 
changed as a result of increased mobility. This multi-directional religious mobility is 
articulated by Nederveen Pieterse (see section 1.1.1) who argues that the Roman 
Empire was globalised by globalising and that the Empire should be seen as being 
pericentric, where the outer regions influenced the inner ones and where there was a 
continuous cultural exchange between Rome and the provinces. The Roman culture 
brought to new provinces was one which had already been influenced by the socio-
cultural identity of other provinces. For the cult of Asclepius, this means that we 
should expect to find aspects of the cult transcending one locality and when new 
cults were founded, these contained elements of various Asclepieia and not just those 
of the mother-sanctuary. 
It is only possible to appreciate how the cult of Asclepius changed under the 
Roman Empire if one also has a strong understanding of the nature of the cult in the 
Classical and Hellenistic periods. Chapter Two, therefore, explored the cult from the 
earliest mention up until the age of Caesar. It was shown that while Asclepius was 
mentioned in Homer, he was only a mortal healer at that point and that the cult of the 
god Asclepius did not flourish until the 5th century BC. His main sanctuary was that 
of Epidaurus, although his true place of origin may have been Tricca in Thrace. 
However, as this has not been excavated this cannot be ascertained for certain. The 
Delphic oracle proclaimed Epidaurus to be the birth-place of Asclepius, which 
cemented its position as one of the main Asclepieia in the ancient world and one 
from which many other sanctuaries, such as the ones at Athens, Rome, and 
Pergamum, were founded. This also shows the high degree of connectivity in the 
cult, which is one of the main themes of this work. It also showed the early 
dissemination of the cult, as provided from analysis of Riethmllers work, which 
showed that Asclepius spread to most areas of the Greek world, but that the main 
heartland of his cult lay in the Peloponnese, with the largest number of sanctuaries 
being present there.  
The chapter focussed on providing a brief history of the main sanctuaries of 
the god, providing a foundation for research presented in Chapters Three, Four, and 
Five. The same was done with a brief analysis of the iconography of Asclepius and 
also the use of epithets. It was ascertained that the latter did not occur in the 
Classical period within the cult, and that their use only really took off from the 
Roman period onwards. This shows a clear adaptation of the cult to needs which 
were only perceived in that era as Asclepius appears to grown more powerful at that 
time and have become more active in further spheres of influence. Another important 
point which was made from the analysis of the early dissemination of the cult was 
that it seems that if no need was felt by local people for a healing cult, Asclepius did 
not penetrate a region. This happened in Boeotia where there were no sanctuaries of 
the god, despite the presence of numerous other cult sites in other areas of Greece, 
especially the Peloponnese. This was probably due to the presence of the healing god 
Trophonius in this region which negated the need for a new healing god here. 
Asclepius was only imported if people felt a need for the god. 
Building on the preliminary information provided in Chapter Two, Chapter 
Three examined the impact of emperors on the cult, focussing particularly on three 
emperors, namely Claudius, Hadrian, and Caracalla. The earlier emperors did not 
seem to have a great interest in the cult but did supplicate Asclepius on occasion. 
However, things greatly changed with Claudius who gave honours and rights to the 
Coan Asclepieion as the result of the intervention of his personal physician, Gaius 
Stertinius Xenophon. Xenophon had trained as a doctor on Cos and come to Rome as 
part of an embassy which petitioned Tiberius for a reconfirmation of the right of 
asylia for Cos. After this embassy Xenophon stayed in Rome and became Claudius 
personal physician at some point. After Claudius became emperor, the Coans seem 
to have used Xenophon as an intermediary between them and the emperor, taking 
advantage of the direct connection they had with the imperial court in order to 
achieve their aims. Instead of sending embassies which took time to put together and 
get matters sorted, the Coans took advantage of Xenophons position at court in 
order to further their own affairs. Xenophon secured the grant of immunitas for the 
Asclepieion from Claudius, exempting the sanctuary from taxation. Xenophon, as an 
Asclepiad, was connected to Asclepius and his intercession was a large part of the 
reason why Claudius granted this right, according to Tacitus.1095 Xenophon was 
trained in the arts of Asclepius, which gave him his position at court, and he used 
this position to gain favours for both his people and the god whom he served. 
Claudius interest in Cos continued as he took an interest in Coan affairs, which can 
be seen from inscribed letters which refer to some form of stasis which took place on 
the island. This perceived status and influence on Xenophons behalf continues to be 
1095 Tac. Ann. 12.61. 
shown in inscriptions which were set up by and for Xenophon, which continuously 
mention his position at the Roman court via a number of titles, despite Xenophon 
being back in Cos following Claudius death. Xenophons power, and, via him, the 
Coans ability to gain favours from the emperor, were at the forefront of these 
inscriptions set up in the Coan Asclepieion and referring to the god Asclepius. The 
impact of the Roman Empire on the cult here is clear as the sanctuary gained prestige 
and extra rights as the result of an emperors direct intercession. This interest in the 
region continued as Claudius continued to take part, to a certain extent, in Coan 
regional affairs. The importance of this imperial connection is visible from titles in 
dedications set up for Xenophon as his Roman connections are continuously allude 
to, as are his Coan ones, leading to the creation of both a global and regional identity 
on his part in which both illustrate different roles which Xenophon played. 
The strong relationship between a city, an emperor, and the god is also shown 
in the second part of the chapter via the study of travelling emperors. Hadrians visit 
to the Pergamene Asclepieion promoted the cult and prompted a drastic rebuilding of 
the sanctuary there with many amenities being added to the site. The visit had 
another lasting result as a new god was introduced, the syncretic deity Zeus-
Asclepius, who fitted in with Hadrianic ideologies concerning universal deities. 
However, there is little evidence of the actual worship of this god, with only two 
dedications known, showing that where there was no actual need for a god, as in 
Boeotia, he would not be worshipped.  
An imperial visit would have a direct impact upon a cult as was shown with 
Hadrians visit to Epidaurus which prompted a rebuilding of the site and also a 
revival of ancient rituals, which is in accordance with what was argued in Chapter 
One. Zeus-Asclepius was introduced into Pergamum as the result of Hadrians visit 
and the iconography of this syncretic god travelled with the emperor to Greece 
where the omphalos, which was part of Zeus-Asclepius iconographic scheme, was 
found in Eleusis. This iconography played a further role in the history of Asclepius 
and emperors in antiquity as it formed an important part of Caracallas worship of 
Asclepius. This emperor supplicated Asclepius in either AD 213 or 214, possibly 
because of a need for healing or from a desire to legitimise his reign by worshipping 
locally important gods. Caracallas worship of Asclepius was documented on a series 
of medallions which depict his actions as he moved through the city and from secular 
to sacred space. The cities of Asia Minor had long been in constant competition with 
each other and Pergamum took this visit as another method for self-aggrandisement. 
Pergamum itself greatly benefited from it as the city gained many honours such as a 
third neocorate. Other cities in Asia Minor saw that Caracalla had sought out 
Asclepius and, as a result, revived their own ancient Asclepieian rites, following 
Whitmarshs and Chaniotis theories (as set out in Chapter One), and new rites such 
as festivals were also held for the god. 
Asclepius was more commonly depicted on the coinages of Asia Minor and 
his newfound popularity continued past the reign of Caracalla as Severus Alexander 
was also shown to worship Asclepius on coinage of Aigeai. Alexander had visited 
Aigeai and had been given a priesthood of Asclepius and granted a neocorate in 
return. This worship could have been part of creating dynastic links between him and 
Caracalla via the worship of the same god, as part of the strategy to legitimise his 
rule was to claim that he was Caracallas son. Wider ramifications of Caracallas 
worship of Asclepius at Pergamum were the adoption of the iconography of the god 
Zeus-Asclepius by the mint of Rome and also others across the empire. From the 
time of Caracalla onwards, Asclepius become depicted on coinages across the 
provinces but also those issued by the mint in Rome showing the omphalos at his 
feet. The Pergamene iconography was adopted as a way to show Caracallas worship 
of the god at this place across the empire. While not all depictions of Asclepius show 
the omphalos, it occurred frequently showing that, in part, the image of Asclepius 
presented across the empire after Caracallas supplication of the god, was that of the 
Pergamene Asclepius and not another local variation.  
This is highly important as it shows that there was a multi-directional 
religious mobility and connectivity between Rome and the provinces where it was 
not just Rome which imposed its culture on the peripherally situated areas but that 
the cultures of the provinces were also assimilated by Rome and then disseminated 
further. This does away with outdated ideas of centre and periphery in the Empire 
and shows the actual application of Nederveen Pieterses argument in which he 
states that the Empire should be viewed through a pericentric model where elements 
from the outer regions were taken up by Rome and then spread to new frontiers. The 
Roman culture which was disseminated to the provinces was, therefore, not a purely 
Roman one but one which had already been influenced by the cultures of other 
provinces. The iconography of Asclepius of Pergamum which occurs on coinage 
issued by the Roman and other provincial mints is a direct example of this.   
This cross-provincial multi-directional connectivity is also shown in Chapter 
Four, which looked at the Roman army and how it worshipped and disseminated the 
cult in the Balkan and Danubian provinces. By examining the cult of Asclepius here, 
this study is contributing to a relatively new but flourishing field in classics in an 
area which is rich in epigraphic evidence. As mentioned above, the army was one of 
the clearest factors by which to show the impact of the Empire, as a permanent 
standing army was only created under Augustus, together with a medical corps, and 
is, therefore, a direct product of Empire. This region also clearly shows this impact 
as, with the exception of Thrace, no pre-Roman traces of any cult of Asclepius have 
been found in these regions. There is, thus, great scope for innovative study here. 
Collar (see section 1.1.8) has argued that it was army officers who were the most 
highly mobile members of the military and that they were responsible for the 
dissemination of cults. Infantry men were the more static group and could often 
expect to be stationed in the same location for their entire term of service but officers 
were transferred often enough to ensure the transmission of cults across the empire 
with them. Worship of these gods was then taken up by the lower ranks, following 
their officers example.  
This cross-provincial mobility is shown in this work by inscriptions set up by 
military worshippers of Asclepius and also officials as, for example, a former 
propraetorian legate from Cilicia and current legate of the legio I Minerva, Quintus 
Venedius Rufus, set up a dedication to Asclepius in Bad Gotesburg in Germania 
Inferior.1096 As was shown in Chapter Three, there was a flourishing cult of 
Asclepius in Cilicia, especially at Aigeai, and it is not impossible to imagine that this 
legate encountered and worshipped the cult there and decided to continue worship of 
Asclepius even after he had been posted to another province. Other examples of this 
phenomenon have been presented in this chapter but they show that the god could be 
continuously worshipped by an individual in different areas.  
This mobility is also shown by medical officers and their worship of 
Asclepius. A medical corps was created as part of the Augustan permanent army and 
numerous dedications to Asclepius by army physicians are known. These doctors 
1096 CIL 13.7994. 
worshipped the god either for their own health or, and also commonly, for the 
restoration of health or the continued well-being of members of their cohort or their 
superiors. There was no competition between sacred and secular healing. The god 
travelled with these doctors to the forts and fortresses where they were stationed and 
it is in this context that an entirely new place of worship for Asclepius is found. The 
existence of the valetudinarium is not in question and debate is solely concerned 
with the form which these structures took, and in the hospital at Novae inscriptions 
and dedicatory evidence were found concerning worship of the god here. The 
inscriptions attested to a sacellum which was erected by the legion which was 
stationed there, within the hospital. Military worship of Asclepius did not just 
introduce him to new regions but also brought him into new contexts in which the 
god was worshipped. A dedication to Asclepius was set up in Aquincum by a former 
head of the valetudinarium at Praeneste, illustrating both the new context for 
worship but also the continued existence of the high degree of religious connectivity 
within the cult of Asclepius.  
A second example of Asclepius mobility within a military context is that of 
Asclepius Zimidrenus. The Thracian Rider was a locally popular god in Thrace who 
was associated with Asclepius at some point. Numerous dedications, some bearing 
the epithet Zimidrenus, were erected to this god in various sanctuaries across Thrace 
and also some in Moesia. These dedications were all set up in Greek, were often 
accompanied by a relief which actually helped to identify the god to whom the 
dedication was set up, as the text was generally brief and lacking in many details 
beyond the dedicators name. These dedications were also set up by individuals, 
whilst group dedications are not found. However, one inscription from Rome tells a 
completely different story; it was set up by Thracian members of the praetorian 
cohorts to the god Asclepius Zimidrenus. These cohorts brought their version of the 
god Asclepius with them to Rome, preferring him over the already present Asclepius 
of Tiber Island, which illustrates dissemination of cults via the army. Yet, in this 
inscription the praetorians tried their hardest to present themselves as Roman as 
possible by using Latin and not Greek as the dedicating language and inscribing it in 
a uniform Roman style without accompanying relief. They also included fictitious 
Roman voting tribes to further this Roman illusion. Thracian elements do also come 
through as the Thracian vicus to which they belonged is continuously mentioned. 
These soldiers wished to appear Roman but also kept core elements from their place 
of origin, mixing their culture with that of Rome. 
Chapter Five has shown how the cult can be further spread when 
disseminated by legions and also the role choice played in this. With Asclepius 
Zimidrenus the praetorians chose to worship him rather than the Tiber Island 
Asclepius. Caracalla also did not chose to visit the Tiber Island sanctuary or any 
other one but selected the Pergamene shrine as the place to supplicate Asclepius. 
Choice played an important part in the dissemination and worship of Asclepius. A 
cult of Asclepius had long been present in North Africa before the Roman period. 
However, this was the syncretic cult of Eshmun-Asclepius which had its stronghold 
in Carthage and the later province of Africa Proconsularis. From Carthage this god 
was disseminated to other lands under Carthaginian control, such as Sardinia, where 
an inscription allows for a conclusive identification of this syncretic pairing. 
However, it seems that there was also a second Asclepius in North Africa whose 
worship was focused mainly in Numidia with its cult centre at Lambaesis, and, in 
contrast to the cult in Proconsularis, was worshipped mainly by soldiers.  
This duality is possible, as study of epithets shows. The use of an epithet 
signalled that a god had a different function from the god whose name was 
connected to another epithet. This means that Asclepius Soter was not necessarily 
seen as being the same god as Asclepius Kurios. The Pergamene sanctuary also 
shows that it was possible for multiple versions of the same god to coexist peacefully 
in the same locality, with supplicants free to choose which of the gods they 
worshipped. Choice and religious diversity, thus, were a strong characteristic of the 
cults here. A number of elements set the cults of Eshmun-Asclepius and Asclepius 
apart from each other, such as the differences in worshippers, where the dedications 
in Numidia were dominated by soldiers and people associated with the legion, 
whereas in Proconsularis worshippers were mainly civilians such as traders. In 
Numidia, Asclepius was associated predominantly with Hygeia but many different 
gods and deities, including Caelestis, were associated with the cult of Eshmun-
Asclepius. The gods had differing iconographies and there were also differences in 
the cultic attributes, such as temples, in both cults and provinces. All this gives a 
clear impression of two distinct cults, one of which had probably been established in 
Africa some time during the Hellenistic period, and the other which had come to 
Africa with the legion.  
No reasons are given why this second god was imported with the legion, 
although Asclepius importance should not be underestimated as it was the legions 
legate who introduced the cult the god at Lambaesis and the temple was built here by 
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus for the wellbeing of the legion.1097 Parallels with 
the praetorian worship of Asclepius-Zimidrenus should be drawn here and it was the 
legions choice to prefer one version of the god over another. This version would

have had elements which the legion thought suited it better than the other version of 
the god. It seems then that the direct impact of the Roman army upon the cult here 
was to increase the religious diversity of the area as a result of improved choice. The 
agency of the legion should, therefore, not be underestimated. A surprising aspect of 
the cult here was its emphasis on its Epidaurian origins. This connectivity between 
the two sanctuaries is shown via the extra emphasis on purity in these places and also 
via the cult-statue iconography. If a more pericentric model of Empire is accepted 
then this is perhaps another way of viewing these connections. Firstly, the socio-
religious culture of one of the provinces was transported to another region via the 
agency of Rome, which fits in exactly with this theory. Yet, further explanations 
need to be sought. Therefore, secondly, a revival of ancient rites in this region is 
found, which fits in with the theory argued by Chaniotis (see section 1.1.4). These 
Epidaurian origins would, therefore, combine some of the possible theories of why 
globalism and regionalism happened. It is possible that the members of the Third 
Augustan legion were themselves reacting to the reality of Empire. These men were 
originally probably of an Italian origin who then were transported to a foreign land. 
They, like provincials who reacted when coming into contact with the Roman 
Empire, responded to this new world by focussing on old and familiar rites. The cult 
of Asclepius was one of the ways in which this occurred. Nederveen Pieterse also 
argued that by globalising, the Roman Empire became globalised in turn. By 
travelling to foreign lands the legion exported its culture to these provinces but also 
took on new aspects of this provincial culture as its own. The legionaries could have 
reacted to the new reality of Empire by reaching back into their own culture and 
reviving old and familiar rites and by worshipping a god whom they thought would 
adequately protect them in this new world.  
It is, furthermore, possible that there was something about the Tiber Island 
sanctuary which supplicants did not like, once again factoring in choice. No Roman 
emperor seems to have supplicated Asclepius there, though they did do so in various 
other Asclepieia in the provinces (see Chapter Three) and soldiers also seem to have 
distinct lack of interest in this cult, worshipping Asclepius at other sites in Rome or 
even supplicating different versions of this god rather than the Tiber Island one. 
Perhaps it was because this sanctuary was frequented by people of lower socio-
economic status, such as slaves, but this would not readily provide an answer as to 
why this sanctuary seemed to be less popular then others, despite its favoured 
position in Rome.1098  
The impact of Rome on the cult of Asclepius has been shown via a number of factors 
which all tie in with each other. The cult-sites examined in this work were 
geographically far apart, yet they shared a level of connectivity with each other 
which had not been present in the pre-Roman era. These connections were 
articulated by the exchange of religious elements between cult-sites and also by the 
creation of highly local and regional cultic nature as a result of exposure to the 
global Roman Empire. Parallel studies into other cults would be able to show 
whether this was a phenomenon limited to the cult of Asclepius, a certain type of 
god, or whether this was widespread for all Graeco-Roman deities. Under Roman 
rule, the cult of Asclepius changed, adapted and also flourished, reaching new areas, 
founding new cult sites, and also gaining worship in new contexts and from new 
groups of worshippers.  
1098 Sue. Claud. 25.2. 
 In conclusion, this study has shown that the cult of Asclepius enjoyed a rich 
and varied history under the Roman Empire. The cult adapted to the new reality of 
Empire and was directly influenced by the institutions which were newly created as a 
result of the creation of the Empire, namely emperors and the army. Existing 
sanctuaries were patronised by emperors and, as a result, saw their standing 
increased and an amplified interest from other parties which led to the enrichment 
and rebuilding of these sites and a revival of old rites. However, the foundation of 
new sites was also affected as, because of the increased mobility and connectivity of 
the empire, the cult spread further than before and gained access to new kinds of 
places of worship such as valetudinaria. Elements of particular cults were taken up 
and disseminated to other parts of the empire, influencing and shaping the cults there 
and in Rome, showing the multi-directional connectivity which dominated the cult in 
the Roman era. As a result, the heightened mobility and connectivity of the Roman 
Empire ensured that cults of Asclepius during this period were both global and 
regional.
