Acknowledgements
The past few years have been immensely enjoyable and for that I must thank, first and foremost,
my supervisor, Nick Rawlinson, for taking a chance on me, for allowing me the latitude to pursue
that to which I found myself to be drawn, and for applying the necessary course corrections to keep
me on track. Though I am sure I at times elicited fears to the otherwise, the process of writing
this thesis was overall an enjoyable and positive one. I must also thank Bob White, for giving me
the opportunity to fall in love with all things Iceland and volcanic, and for filling the gaps in my
knowledge of the "geo" side of geophysics. A special thanks must also go to Jess Johnson, for
generously providing me with help and assistance along the way in understanding many of the
ideas that form the foundations of much of the work presented herein. Thanks to my examiners,
Sanne Cottaar and Mike Kendall, for giving me an enjoyable grilling and helping to improve this
thesis. No acknowledgements would be complete if I didnt also thank the people, who ultimately
funded this work and many like it.
Once everything is all said and done, this PhD will survive as 242 pages of text and figures.
But these fail to capture the memories, the ups, the downs, and the experiences along the way that
have infused and invigorated me in my work from start to finish. Day to day, my life has been
immeasurably enriched by many people I am grateful to be able to call, above all, friends. Omry,
my PhD brother, taught me the benefits of pragmatism over perfectionismthat a direct, get shit
done mindset is necessary at timesand to enjoy the field and all that it offers. Tom encouraged
mefor better or for worseto take the time to boil a problem down to its fundamentals and
carefully consider the merits and demerits of an approach, and to "measure twice, cut once" so
to speak. A fellow night owl, we invested a great deal of time and effort to build what we hope
will be a valuable tool for the wider community, during which time we saw the arrival of far too
many sunrises. Simone and Nienke provided elder/post-doc wisdom and guidance throughout,
which has helped me to shed many of my romantic idealisations of academia and research and
view things in a more measured and pragmaticyet still positivelight. Debby, Harry, and Esme
have all provided excellent company and entertainment (particularly musical) in the field and the
office and I am grateful for all of them. My experiences in the field were only as good as they were
thanks to the efforts of Brynds and Sveinbjrn in Iceland, and Felix and Epip in Borneo, for which
I am most grateful. And to everyone else in the Bullard over the years, a huge thank you.
None of this would have been possible were it not for the support and encouragement afforded
to me by my family and to whom I am indebted. No one more so than my mum, Jo, and big brother,
Kieran, who have kept me grounded and on track, and were always there to support me by any
means necessary. Without them, I would not be who or where I am today. To my dad, Mark, for
introducing me to the great outdoors and helping to cut away some of the mystery of undertaking a
PhD. To Catriona, for being there through the ups and downs, the mouldy flats and illnesses, our
journey into the Russian language and other adventures, your persistent pestering to play Catan,
and, of course, for your words of encouragement and support that never failed to buoy my spirits.
To my grandparents, Janet and Don, who always had a newspaper cutting or two of "things I might
find interesting" and who always liked to know what I had been up to, however esoteric. And,
lastly, to my Grandma Woofwoof, Auriol, for passing on to me your ability to see the beauty and
adventure in anything in this world, big or small.
Seismic anisotropy and microseismicity: from crustal
formation to subduction termination
Conor Andrew Bacon
The plate tectonic cycle is fundamental to our dynamic Earth, encompassing the formation and
evolution of new lithosphere at divergent, mid-ocean ridges, all the way to its eventual return to,
and re-equilibration with, the mantle in subduction zones. I investigate the structure of the crust
and upper mantle of the Earth in two regions that represent different endmembers in this cycle
through the analysis of microseismicity and seismic anisotropy, seeking to learn more about the
stresses in these environments and how they are manifest in the structure of the subsurface. In
Iceland, new oceanic crust is accreted episodically within the volcanic rift zones that delineate the
subaerial portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the divergent margin between the North American and
the Eurasian plates. Northern Borneo, conversely, exhibits the tectonic signatures of not one but
two terminated subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere was once being actively recycled into
the Earths mantle. As part of this work, I have helped to deploy and service two passive seismic
experimentsthe Cambridge Volcano Seismology network in Iceland and the northern Borneo
Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) network in Sabahfrom which I have derived my results.
Seismic anisotropy is manifest on a vast range of scales, from swathes of the crust and mantle, all
the way down to the scale of single mineral crystals. It has the potential to inform on the dynamic
state of the mantle, the structural fabric of fault zones, layering in sedimentary basins, and the
distribution of partial melt in the subsurface, to name a few applications. Here, I seek new insights
into the stress state and structure of nascent oceanic crust as it is accreted at a mid-ocean ridge, and
the volcanic systems found therein, in Iceland. I also look to piece together the interplay between
past tectonic events, subduction termination, and the present-day state of the mantle in northern
Borneo.
In the first part of my dissertation, I apply shear-wave splitting analysis to a microseismic catalogue
(spanning the period 20082018) in the Northern Volcanic Zone of Iceland in order to investigate
the relationship between seismic anisotropy and the tectonic stresses arising from extension and
plate spreading, microseismicity, and the presence of melt. I find the upper 34 km of the Icelandic
crust to be seismically anisotropic. Modelling of the stresses in the upper crust arising due to
plate spreading and active deformation around Askja volcano, I find this anisotropic layer can be
explained through a mechanism of stress-aligned microcracks within the porous crust. I then use
earthquakes that occur within the lower, ductile crustassociated with the movement of melt within
the volcanic plumbing systemand effective elastic media modelling to explore the role of melt
in the generation of seismic anisotropy below 10 km depth, finding a strong correlation between
my observations and the presence of melt as inferred from seismic tomography. I synthesise these
observations with recent works examining the seismic anisotropic structure of the Icelandic crust
from ambient noise observations to construct a conceptual model for the mechanisms generating
anisotropy throughout the Icelandic crust.
In the second part of my dissertation, I step back in terms of scale to investigate how tectonic
processes related to subduction (and post-subduction) are manifest in the form of seismic anisotropy
by applying shear-wave splitting analysis to teleseismic core-refracted seismic phases. My results,
in conjunction with a recent tomographic model of the region, constrain the seismic anisotropy to
the lithosphere and reflect recent (past 20 Myr) events in the tectonic history of northern Borneo.
In north-west Sabah, my observations of seismic anisotropy are aligned with the orogenic belt
running down the north-west coast (the Crocker Range), which formed during the termination
of subduction of the proto-South China Sea. Conversely, in south-west Sabah my observations
suggest extension has played an important role in the subsequent tectonic evolution of northern
Borneo following subduction of the Celebes Sea and the opening of the Sulu Sea. I supplement this
work with the first detailed study of seismic activity on a network of faults around Mount Kinabalu,
a 4100 m tall mountain within the Crocker Range of northern Borneo. For this, I developed and
used QuakeMigrate, a new Python package for the automatic detection and location of earthquakes
using waveform migration and stacking. These new observations indicate ongoing extension in the
region around Mount Kinabalu and allow, for the first time, for this network of faults to be mapped
and explored in detail.

Chapter 1
Overview
1.1 Motivation
The surface of the Earth has existed in a state of flux since its formation in the early solar system,
around 4.6 Ga (Dalrymple, 1994). Gradually, through the radiation of heat into space, the roiling
molten magma ocean surface of the early Earth (Elkins-Tanton, 2008) cooled, forming a rigid
and, importantly, unbroken layer known as the lithosphere, perhaps similar to the surface of Venus
(Phillips et al., 1981). In time, the early lithosphere began to fracture (exactly when is still subject
to debate, with estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3 Ga), giving rise to a mosaic of tectonic plates and
kick starting the slow recycling of old, and formation of new, lithosphereknown as the Wilson
cycle, or simply plate tectonicsthat still dominates the observed surface motions today (Stern,
2018). The principal driver behind this global process is the steady and inexorable thermodynamic
equilibration of the Earth with the cold vacuum of space. The transfer of residual heat from the
formation of the hot Earth, along with additional heat generated by radioactive decay, is facilitated
through convection of ductile rocks in the mantle, which constitutes the bulk of the Earth spanning
from the crust to the outer core. Cool, dense material sinking into the mantle is thought to be the
primary driver of circulation (Stern and Gerya, 2018), whereas the return of hotter, less dense mate-
rial from deep inside the Earth is thought to be responsible for mantle plumes and upwelling. As
these convective cells turn over, the rigid plates are dragged along at rates of a few centimetres per
yearthus, plate motions are the surface expression of thermodynamic equilibration via convection
in the Earths interior.
The boundaries between tectonic plates fall into three broad classes, depending on the relative
motion between them, and form loci for much of the Earths volcanism, seismic activity, oceanic
basins, and mountain belts: 1) divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart; 2) transform
boundaries, where two plates slide past one another; and 3) convergent boundaries, where two
plates come together. The 60,000 km long mid-ocean ridge system delineates much of the mature
divergent boundaries, where new oceanic lithosphere is accretedaccommodating the spreading
2 Overview
between platesto form the major oceanic basins. At the other end of the cycle, many convergent
boundaries are delineated by subduction zones, wherein one plate moves under another and slowly
sinks into, and re-equilibrates with, the mantle. It is expected that subduction must eventually
terminate, but beyond numerical modelling, there are very few localities wherein this important
phase of the plate tectonic cycle can be investigated. Understanding these processes, and the
tectonic stresses involved, forms a fundamental part of understanding the plate tectonic cycle as a
whole.
I have employed observations of microseismicity and seismic anisotropythe directional depen-
dence of seismic wavespeedsto explore the roles of structure and stress in two endmember
states of the plate tectonic cycle. Seismic anisotropy is manifest on a vast range of scales, from
swathes of the mantle all the way down to the scale of single mineral crystals. It has the poten-
tial to inform on the dynamic state of the mantle, the structural fabric of fault zones, layering in
sedimentary basins, and the distribution of partial melt in the subsurface, to name a few applications.
In the first part of this thesis, I seek new insights into the stress state and structure of nascent oceanic
crust as it is accreted at a mid-ocean ridge, and the volcanic systems found therein, in Iceland. The
aim here is construct a cohesive model for the anisotropic structure of the Icelandic-type oceanic
crust that explains the observations of seismic anisotropy in body waves and surface waves. This
model will form the basis from which to explore the impact of processes associated with volcanic
centres along the Icelandic rift zones on seismic anisotropy, which would provide a new avenue
along which to explore transient volcanic processes, such as the intrusion of sills and dykes.
In the second part of this thesis, I look to piece together the interplay between past tectonic events,
subduction termination, and the present-day state of the mantle in northern Borneo. To date, there
has been a significant amount of research focussing on the tectonics of northern Borneo within the
wider setting of Southeast Asia from the perspectives of geology, geomorphology, geodesy, and
geochemistry, but there is a notable dearth of seismological data for the region. There is significant
debate (covered in Chapter 7) as to the tectonic stress regime across northern Borneo over the last 20
million years or so, during which time it is believed there has been two episodes of subduction that
have since terminated. Various models have been proposed to explain a number of the geological
observations, which appeal to both compressional and extensional tectonic arguments. I use
microseismicity and observations of seismic anisotropy to provide new illumination on this debate
from a seismological perspective.
1.2 Scope of dissertation 3
1.2 Scope of dissertation
This dissertation is divided into two primary parts. In the first part (Chapters 36), I describe
the analysis of seismic data collected at the nascent oceanic crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone,
Iceland, in order to better understand the stress conditions in the crust around Askja volcano, as well
as explore the role of melt in such volcanic systems, before synthesising these results with recent
studies of seismic anisotropy from ambient noise in Iceland. In the second part (Chapters 711),
I apply seismic imaging techniques to data from a temporary passive network of seismometers
deployed across Sabah, northern Borneo, with the aim of better understanding tectonic stresses at
the other end of the tectonic cyclethe termination of subduction.
In Chapter 2, I provide an overview of the methods and underlying theory that I have used in
my research. A significant proportion of this chapter is dedicated to the discussion of the ideas
behind and development of QuakeMigrate, an open-source Python package that I have been a core
developer of during my PhD.
In Chapter 3, I introduce Iceland with a review of the relevant literature, with a focus on the
structure of the crust and the seismic characteristics of the volcanic systems found along the rift
zone.
In Chapters 4 and 5, I present the results of the studies of seismic anisotropy on a local scale in the
Northern Volcanic Zone of Iceland. Chapter 4 focusses on observations of shear-wave splitting
from shallow (< 10 km b.s.l.) earthquakes and what the spatial (both laterally and as a function
of depth) variations in the mapped seismic anisotropy reveal about the stress state of the upper,
nascent oceanic crust. In Chapter 5 I instead use a unique set of earthquakes that occur in clusters
in the lower, ductile crust (> 10 km b.s.l.) to further our understanding of the structure of the deep
crust and the volcanic system of Askja. In Chapter 6, I synthesise the results presented in Chapters
4 and 5 and develop a model for the anisotropic structure of the nascent crust and the mechanisms
responsible for generating this seismic anisotropy, before discussing some of the future directions
for this work.
In Chapter 7, I introduce northern Borneo with a review of the relevant literature, covering the
tectonic evolution of northern Borneo over the past 2030 Myr, followed by a detailed description
of the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) network in Chapter 8, in which I
describe the fieldwork, data post-processing and overall success of the deployment phase of the
seismic experiment. Extensive details of the data collection stage of this experiment are provided
here as a record for posterity as well as a discussion of the achievements and hurdles faced during
the 2 year deployment.
4 Overview
In Chapter 9, I analyse the splitting of teleseismic shear phase arrivals observed across the nBOSS
network. These provide crucial evidence for the dynamic (and historic) state of the upper mantle
beneath Sabah, revealing much about what happens with seismic anisotropy when subduction
terminates. This work helps to tie together the observations made using other seismic imaging
techniques, such as body-wave and ambient noise tomography and receiver function analysis.
In Chapter 10, seismicity on a network of faults around the Mount Kinabalu massif is mapped
in exceptional detail for the first time. This earthquake catalogue gives us unique insight into the
tectonic setting, as well as providing a much needed overview of the seismic activity and associated
hazard in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu. Local magnitudes are calculated and used to estimate
seismicity rates (based on the b-value measure) and evidence is provided for the seismogenic
thickness of the crust in this region. Focal mechanism solutions are used to place the seismicity in
the context of northern Borneos recent tectonic history. In all, this work both highlights the effec-
tiveness of new, automatic techniques I have developed and provides a wealth of new information
regarding the tectonic regime in which the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network is found.
And finally, in Chapter 11 I briefly summarise how the results presented in Chapters 9 and 10 fit
in to the puzzle that is the post-subduction setting of Sabah, northern Borneo and briefly discuss
some of the future directions this work could take.
Chapter 2
Theory and Methods
In this chapter, I describe the techniques that I have applied to the seismic data recorded in both
Iceland and Borneo. There is significant overlap in the concepts explored and techniques used in
these two regions. I have benefitted extensively from software created and made openly available by
many other groups and individualse.g. ObsPy, a Python framework for processing seismological
data (Beyreuther et al., 2010; Krischer et al., 2015; Megies et al., 2011)though, where indicated,
I have also developed a number of toolkits that further augment these existing works, which I
have endeavoured to make available through my public GitHub account. Much of my analyses
were carried out using Python, a widely used, interpreted, high-level programming language for
which a number of general purpose packages have been created. The most important among
them to my work have been: SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020); NumPy (Harris et al., 2020); Pandas
(pandas development team, 2021); and PyProj (Snow et al., 2021). All data visualisations in
this dissertation were initially made using Matplotlib (Hunter, 2007) and Generic Mapping Tools
(Wessel et al., 2019), with some adjustments made using Affinity Designer.
In Section 2.2, I describe QuakeMigrate, a Python package for automatic earthquake detection and
location using waveform migration and stacking. This work, undertaken in collaboration with a
number of others, has been prepared for publication in Geophysical Journal International.
2.1 Earthquake detection and location
Earthquakes have long been the principal source of data used by seismologists to learn about
the interior of Earth (Iyer and Hirahara, 1993; Nolet, 2012; Stein and Wysession, 2009). These
(predominantly) natural events generate seismic waves that travel through the Earth, the veloci-
ties and amplitudes of which are an inherent function of the (an)elastic properties of the media
encountered along the way. In addition to the information encoded into these seismic waveforms,
even simply the number of earthquakes to occur within a region over a fixed period of timethe
seismicitycan provide significant insight into the present-day tectonic processes at play. On a
6 Theory and Methods
global scale, the accurate location of earthquakes played a significant role in the development of
plate tectonics as a means of explaining the observation that the vast majority of seismic activity is
concentrated within narrow regions, now known to delineate the major plate boundaries. On a local
scale, as the number of instruments deployed and the volume of seismic data recorded increases
annually, earthquake catalogues are revealing ever more about the fine-scale structure of the crust.
Consequently, the construction of robust and highly complete earthquake cataloguesfor example,
the ISC-EHB bulletin (Storchak et al., 2013, 2015)detailing the origin times and locations of
earthquakes is a fundamental step for seismological research at any scale. Traditionally, earthquakes
are identified manually from seismic phase arrivals in the seismic record, which were subsequently
associated with an event. Provided the phase arrivals were observed in the records of at least three
seismometers, they could be used to locate the event either through triangulation (e.g. Milne, 1886)
or using the iterative, linearised inversion of Geiger (1912). Later developments came in the form
of gradient-based approaches such as that implemented in the HYPOINVERSE program (Klein,
1978). This phase association task is reasonably simple on regional (hundreds of kilometres)
to teleseismic (thousands of kilometres) scales, where network sensitivity is relatively low and
there is little ambiguity due to the lower rate at which large earthquakes occur globally. But the
combination of high-density networks and the increased rate at which small earthquakes occur act
to significantly complicate the problem. Thus, while manual phase arrival time picking continues
to be important for the production of highly precise earthquake locations, it is a labour-intensive
and time-consuming task and more automated techniques are becoming increasingly favoured.
As the achievable magnitude of completeness has reduced in step with the deployment of more
and more local and national networks with increased density, so too, necessarily, has the typical
inter-event period. During periods of intense seismic activity, it is not uncommon for multiple
earthquakes to occur almost simultaneously within a volume, which makes phase association a
far more complicated task. For example, during the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dyke intrusion
and eruption, thousands of earthquakes were being generated every day (e.g. gstsdttir et al.,
2019; Sigmundsson et al., 2014), which rendered manual methods prohibitively impractical. These
challenges have fuelled the development of a number of techniques dedicated to the automatic
detection and location of earthquakes in continuous records of seismic data. Such automatic
techniques are invaluable tools for the production of high-fidelity earthquake catalogues, often
with few artefacts, that can be used as a springboard for subsequent analyses. One such family of
methods are matched-filtered techniques (Chamberlain et al., 2018; Shelly et al., 2007), in which
previously identified events are used as templates to identify more events with similar waveforms in
the same area. This class of technique can produce excellent results in regions with high levels of
repeating seismicity (e.g. Chamberlain et al., 2021; Greenfield, 2015), but lack sensitivity to events
that have not previously been picked. Consequently, they are primarily suitable for the expansion of
existing earthquake catalogues to lower magnitudes of completion (e.g. Chamberlain et al., 2021).
2.1 Earthquake detection and location 7
2.1.1 Waveform migration and stacking techniques
A method of earthquake detection and location that has gained traction in recent years, inspired by
long-established active seismology techniques used in industry, is partial waveform stacking (Li
et al., 2020). Here, the logical flow of the problem is reversed; the paradigm shifts from one of
pick-then-locate to locate-then-pick. Instead of focussing on discrete phase arrival times, the
goal is instead to reduce the waveform recordings to continuous representations of the probability
of a phase arrival, via some function known as a characteristic function. These characteristic
functions, which are designed to peak around the arrival of seismic phases, are then migrated back
into a given 3-D search volume using pre-computed traveltime lookup tables and stacked. Points in
space and time where these functions stack coherently indicate the presence of a source of seismic
energythat is (most commonly), an earthquake. This technique neatly bypasses several of the
limitations inherent to pick-based techniques and is suitable for automation. It is also possible to
use the full information available in the raw waveforms, but one would need to account for things
like the source mechanism and instrument responses, which adds an additional layer of complexity
and computational cost.
One of the first examples of this used the envelope function (Hilbert transform), implemented in
the Source Scanning Algorithm (SSA) of Kao and Shan (2004). With the increase in computing
power available to users, and thus the ability to handle larger volumes of data, more quickly, a
number of different implementations of this technique have appeared in the last fifteen or so years.
Each implementation employs a particular characteristic function, such as the ratio between the
short-term-average and the long-term-average (STA/LTA), e.g. the Coalescence Microseismic
Mapping (CMM) algorithm of Drew et al. (2013) or the waveform stacking detection and location
(WSDL) method of Grigoli et al. (2018), or high-order statistics such as kurtosis (e.g. Langet et al.,
2014; Poiata et al., 2016). Another class of algorithm seeks to migrate the coherency between wave-
forms across multiple stations (Shi et al., 2019), though this comes at a higher computational cost.
However, the core stacking algorithm is broadly the same between each implementationidentify
a representation of the raw input data such that the information in the waveforms is reduced to a
simple characteristic that can be migrated into the search volume and stacked. For a recent review
of the field, read Li et al. (2020).
In Section 2.2, I describe QuakeMigrate, a Python package that has been designed to not only
implement and improve on the CMM method outlined by Drew et al. (2013), but to also act as a
general framework for partial waveform stacking problems.
8 Theory and Methods
2.1.2 NonLinLoc
NonLinLoc (Non-Linear Location) is a collection of programs that uses the probabilistic framework
established by Tarantola (1987) to invert for earthquake hypocentres via a grid (i.e. non-linear)
search within some volume. Tarantola and Valette (1982) demonstrated that if one were to rep-
resent data and model parameters as probability density functions (PDFs), assuming Gaussian
uncertainties, then it was possible to construct a posterior PDF for the location problem, including
uncertainties. The maximum likelihood point of the complete non-linear location PDF is designated
as the optimal hypocentre. The PDF can then be visualised as scatter plot of x, y, z locations of
samples in the PDF with a non-zero probability. The uncertainties associated with the phase arrival
time picks are assigned a priori using a system of weightings obtained from the manual picking
process.
The misfit can be calculated using the L2 norm (Tarantola and Valette, 1982), but this can be
heavily impacted by a single outlier. Instead, NonLinLoc uses the Equal Differential Time (EDT)
likelihood function, which is less sensitive to outliers. In this formulation, which behaves like
, the contribution of outliers (i.e. large x) tend to zero and thus do not bias the final solution.
Rather than comparing the observed travel times with model predictions, the function compares
differential travel times between all pairs of stations, making the EDT misfit independent of origin
time. It is expressed as
pd f (x)  k
2a +
tobsa (x) tobsb (x)
tcalca (x) tcalcb (x)
2a +
)N , (2.1)
where a and b are two stations and tobs and tcalc are the observed and model travel times, respec-
tively, a,b are the uncertainties on the observed travel times to stations a and b, N is the number of
observations, and k is a normalisation factor.
NonLinLoc systematically evaluates the posterior PDF across a 3-D spatial grid using one of
three sampling methods: nested grid search, Metropolis-Gibbs random walk, or Oct-Tree directed
importance sampling. I use the EDT misfit function along with the Oct-Tree sampling method to
sample the spatial model. This importance sampling method initially samples the PDF on a coarse
grid of spatial locations, and then recursively divides and subsamples ever smaller cells. Cells with
the highest probability are recursively subsampled. The method serves to heavily sample the area
where the location probability is high, and avoids sampling areas of low importance. The search
method is efficient, but will still allow the resolution of multiple solution possibilities in the PDF.
The volume of sampling is a trade-off between computational efficiency and precision of the PDF.
I halt the Oct-Tree sampling when the minimum cell size becomes less than 0.1 km, or when the
2.1 Earthquake detection and location 9
maximum number of cells exceeds 200,000. Generating hypocentral locations for earthquakes
located within both the Iceland and the northern Borneo networks used in this dissertation with
these methods results in spatial errors from the PDF which are typically on the order of 1 km.
I have used NonLinLoc to refine the locations of a number of earthquakes in Chapter 10, following
the manual refinement of phase picks. I have also made use of an additional program included with
NonLinLoc that calculates take-off angles for a given event that are subsequently fed into MTfit in
order to calculate the moment tensor solutions presented in Chapter 10.

(2004). Blue lines (panels a and b) and sheets (panels c and d) represent the EDT surface for a pair

10 Theory and Methods
2.2 QuakeMigrate
Here, I discuss the theoretical ideas that underpin QuakeMigrate: a modular, open-source Python
package that provides a framework to efficiently, automatically, and robustly detect and locate
seismicity. I also include some aspects of its development and testing that I believe warrant
recording, but perhaps do not warrant a dedicated chapter in this dissertation. The origins of
QuakeMigrate lie in a proprietary software package called Coalescence Microseismic Mapping
(CMM), developed by Julian Drew (Drew et al., 2013). The motivation for this endeavour was to
create a modern tool, written in Python and C rather than MATLAB, that was transparent and freely
available to the wider research community. This seemingly straightforward task has amounted to
a significant amount of work, with contributions made by a number of individuals. Julian Drew
provided the foundations for the project by translating parts of his closed-source code into a library
of functions. This library was then taken up by Jonathan Smith and Tom Hudson, who re-worked it
into something that could actually process seismic data and produce results. I joined the project
in March 2019 to help realise the ambition to turn what was, at the time, a functioning piece of
in-house code into a true framework that could be shared widely with the research community,
working in close collaboration with Tom Winder. The work has been prepared for publication,
towards which I have contributed text and figures. My involvement with the QuakeMigrate project
has been an incredibly formative and enjoyable experience. It has been a truly collaborative effort
and I am indebted to everyone that have been involved, both the developers and those people that
used the earlier versions of the code. These early adopters gave invaluable feedback on what we
could do better and kept us on our toes
Package structure
Much of my contribution to the project has been an effective rewrite1 of QuakeMigrate, with the
ultimate aim being to take the code from its status as a functioning in-house tool to a true software
framework2 for the family of partial waveform stacking techniques. This involved redesigning the
architecture of the package, refactoring3 the code where appropriate, and reviewing the theory and
its implementation. In doing so, I uncovered a crucial difference between the theory and how it
had been implemented. After rectifying this issue, the performance (and, crucially, validity) of the
package was vastly improved. The package structure is summarised in Figure 2.2.
1A rewrite of computer code specifically refers to the process of re-implementing a large portion of the existing
functionality without re-use of the original source code.
2A framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by
additional user-written code.
3Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing software code, without changing the overall user-facing
functionality.

sections of the code that have been isolated from the basic machinery of the package. Here, the base
code can be substituted for custom methods without impacting the behaviour or basic functioning
of the code.
One of the core aims of the project was to produce a piece of software that could not only solve the
waveform migration and backprojection problem using the method laid out by Drew et al. (2013),
but also be extended to solve similar problems. In order to achieve this, I identified and separated
the project into elements that were core machinery and those that fulfilled a role in a specific, but
non-unique, way. By ensuring that these core and peripheral parts of the code were entirely isolated
from one another, and the interfaces between them were simple and well-documented, I was able to
accomplish this modularisation task. The peripheral sections of the code, highlighted in Figure 2.2,
can be altered or completely replaced, without impacting the basic functionality of the package.
An example case for the Onset module is presented and discussed in Section 2.2.1.
A suite of dedicated export functions are included with QuakeMigrate to convert the locate outputs
of QuakeMigrate to various input formats required for other types of analyses, including Snuffler
(manual pick refinement), MFAST (shear-wave splitting analysis), NonLinLoc (event location
refinement), and ObsPy (miscellaneous analyses).
Computational complexity analysis
Further to these modifications, I also dedicated time to a review of the computational complexity of
the core algorithms, which were written in C, and the Python machinery wrapping them. Both time
(core hours) and space (memory usage) complexity were analysed. Through this analysis, I was
able to identify and address the significant bottlenecks, achieving roughly an order of magnitude
12 Theory and Methods
improvement in the runtime efficiency. In Figure 2.3, I present an overview of the computational
costs incurred when running QuakeMigrate for a sample of the waveform data recorded in northern
Borneo, which is presented in full in Chapter 10. This effort has been rewarded not only by an
improvement in the efficiency of the code, which is often overlooked in scientific endeavours
despite the environmental impact of inefficient code, but also with a tangible improvement in the
results QuakeMigrate is capable of producing. With the reduction in the spatial and temporal
costs, it has been possible to increase the resolution (both spatially and temporally) for a given run,
without incurring prohibitive costs. This has been highlighted with the reanalysis of data presented
in Smith et al. (2015), in which a tenfold increase in the number of cryoseismic events detected
was achieved (Winder, 2021).
In addition to the profiling presented in Figure 2.3, I have also analysed the computational resource
consumption of the Iceland icequake example that is available in the project GitHub. In this analysis,
I looked at the memory costs incurred during each stage (building the LUT, Detect, Trigger, and
Locate) and also broke down the profiles through time. Figures 2.42.7 show the memory usage
through time for each stage. For the Locate stage, the principal bottleneck currently is the (optional)
production of the phase pick and final summary plots. These are important to check when tuning
the run parameters, but appear to increase the time cost for each event by 300%where possible,
these plotting features can be disabled to make significant computational savings.
The server used to perform this profiling consists of 20 Intel Xeon E5-2630 central processing units
(CPUs, clock speed of 2.2 GHz) and 126 GB of random access memory (RAM).
Installation
The package source code is available for download from the public GitHub repository4. The
source code has been meticulously documented throughout, providing full details of the classes and
functions that comprise QuakeMigrate. It was my belief that this was not a mere enhancement of the
package, but a fundamental requirement for it to be truly open and robust under peer review. This
documentation, along with installation instructions and a number of tutorials covering the basics
of using QuakeMigrate are hosted online5. In January 2021, version 1.0.0 (under the semantic
versioning scheme) was released and a DOI was registered at Zenodo (QuakeMigrate, 2021). This
release represents the culmination of over 3 years of work, but a number of future improvements
and extensions are already in the works.

Fig. 2.3 Spatial and temporal profiling of the Detect stage of QuakeMigrate. Waveform data were
recorded from 00:0001:00 UTC on 2018-05-08 at 17 stations in northern Borneo. The stations
used were identical to those described in Chapter 10. Panels a and b show the behaviour in temporal
and spatial complexity, respectively, for variations in the decimation factor (in x, y, and z) used to
resample the traveltime lookup tables (and hence the migration grid). Purple squares indicate the
peak memory usage, whereas the blue diamonds show the average memory usage over the course
of the run (with memory usage measured every 0.1 s). This clearly illustrates the key trade-off
between a higher resolution grid (lower decimation factor), which in turn leads to better results,
and increased resource consumption. Panels c and d show the same profiling as a and b, except the
timestep is the parameter that is being varied. Panels e and f again show the same profiling, but for
the number of threads used. The server used to perform this profiling consists of 20 Intel Xeon
E5-2630 CPUs (clock speed of 2.2 GHz) and 126 GB of RAM.

16 Theory and Methods
2.2.1 Input
QuakeMigrate operates with a minimal amount of required inputs. For a simple run, one only needs
an archive of continuous waveform data, a list of stations, and a velocity model.
Traveltime lookup tables
Besides the raw waveform data, the primary input is a collection of traveltime lookup tables (LUTs),
which specify the P- and S-wave traveltimes from each instrument to every point in a 3-D grid.
These LUTs are pre-computed, bypassing the need to solve the wave equation for each station at
every time increment, turning the runtime problem into one of simple indexing (hence the name
lookup). The 3-D grid should span the volume of interest (with a small spatial buffer to reduce the
number of artefactssee 2.2.3), hereafter called the coalescence volume, over which QuakeMigrate
will search for events. The geographical location and spatial extent of the grid are specified by
five pieces of information: an input projection, typically some reference ellipsoid (e.g. WGS84); a
grid projection, which specifies how spherical longitude/latitude coordinates are transformed to
Cartesian x/y; a pair of coordinates that specify two corners of the grid in the input space; and
a cell size. The axes are configured in a left-handed coordinate system (i.e. positive down) and
the curvature of the earth is assumed to be negligible across the region of interest. The spatial
extent should be chosen to encompass the expected seismicity and the cell size should be a realistic
estimate of the achievable resolution, balanced against the computational cost. For a model with
dimensions on the order of 10s of kilometres (see Chapter 10), a 500 m grid spacing is a good
balance between computation time and resolution, as the accuracy of the earthquake locations is
not likely to be better than 1 km. However, for small regions, such as that used in the Iceland
icequake example (available on the project GitHub), a higher resolution is needed.
There are a number of methods that can be used to calculate the phase traveltimes. For most
applications, a simple 1-D velocity model is appropriate. Users can use the fast-marching method
(Rawlinson and Sambridge, 2004, 2005) or the finite-difference technique of Podvin and Lecomte
(1991) implemented in NonLinLoc earthquake location tools (Lomax et al., 2000). The advantage
of the NonLinLoc method (despite its requirements for users to install NonLinLoc) is that stations
can be included that lie outside the earthquake location grid. This avoids significant computation
determining traveltimes for parts of the grid which are unlikely to record any earthquakes. For more
complex settings where a 3-D velocity structure is available (such as in the context of industrial
applications), pre-calculated traveltime grids can be imported directly into QuakeMigrate. Details
regarding the computation of these traveltime lookup tables are available online6.
6https://quakemigrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/lut.html
2.2 QuakeMigrate 17
The choice of velocity model has a relatively low impact on the overall performance of the method.
A coarse 1-D model is usually sufficient to detect earthquakes and locate them to an accuracy of
better than one or two km even in regions with significant velocity heterogeneities (see Chapter 10).
This is because the onset function used (STA/LTA) results in relatively broad peaks in response
to phase arrivals, so energy still coalesces coherently despite errors in the traveltime lookup table.
This makes it possible to use QuakeMigrate in a region where little work has been done and only a
basic velocity model is available.
Waveform data
The raw, continuous seismic data are read from an archive using the ObsPy (Beyreuther et al.,
2010; Krischer et al., 2015; Megies et al., 2011) package, which provides parsers for numerous
standard seismic data formats (e.g. miniSEED, SAC, etc.). QuakeMigrate can, in theory, handle
data stored in any form of archive, provided the data files have been stored in a regular format.
Careful quality control (QC) of the raw waveform data in the archive is highly recommended
before using QuakeMigrate (and in general). Sharp signal offsets, such as in the case of instrument
failures, can propagate into false event triggers and changes in station availability can lead to
variable detection rates.
Raw waveform streams are loaded from the data archive at each padded timestep. Any stations
with data gaps (>1 sample) are removed for that specific timestep. Where necessary, the data is
resampled to match the user-specified coalescence scan sampling rate (CSSR). If the data sampling
rate is an integer multiple of the CSSR, it is decimated. A lowpass filter at the Nyquist frequency is
applied prior to decimation as an anti-aliasing safeguard. If the data sampling rate is not an integer
multiple of the CSSR, the user can choose to upsample the data using a simple linear interpolation
scheme, before decimation to the CSSR.
Onset functions
These partial waveform methods occupy a space somewhere between discrete traveltime pick
(the past?) and full-waveform (the future?) techniques. As with methods based on traveltimes
alone, they revolve around the reduction of the information contained in the full waveform to some
intermediate stage wherein a particular characteristic quality is emphasised e.g. the arrival of the
direct P and S seismic phases. There exists a growing body of work dedicated to the development
of ever more sophisticated algorithms for the calculation of these "characteristic" functions (Grigoli
et al., 2018; Guidarelli et al., 2020; Hendriyana et al., 2018; Kao and Shan, 2004; Li et al., 2020),
but we have chosen to use the STA/LTA onset function (so named because it emphasises the onset
of a phase arrival) for its computational simplicity and the ease by which it can be shown to possess
Gaussian properties (Drew et al., 2013). Additionally, when migrated and stacked it provides good
18 Theory and Methods
resolution, is only weakly sensitive to errors in the velocity model, and is robust in the presence of
noise. This function creates a continuous representation of the probability density function for a
phase arrival by taking the ratio between the averages in a pair of sequentially positioned windows
with two different lengths (thus the Short-Term Average / Long-Term Average name). Provided
an appropriate choice of window lengths is made, the width of the peaks in the corresponding
onset functions is a reasonable estimate of the timing error in the identified phase arrival and the
amplitude is directly tied to the SNR of the recorded phase arrival. One further benefit is that any
differences in the response functions between instruments is implicitly negated. It can be expressed
mathematically as
O(t) =
0 |s(t + )|d
0 |s(t  )|d
, (2.2)
where WS and WL are the lengths (in samples) of the short- and long-term windows, respectively,
and s(t) is the analytic signal. This function has Gaussian properties around a phase arrival peak,
providing the first derivative term of the Taylor expansion goes to zero at the phase arrival. This
is equivalent to saying the function peaks at the phase arrival, which it does, give or take some
small time lag. An example of the application of this characteristic function to real data is shown in
Figure 2.8.

2.2 QuakeMigrate 19
There exist a number of other published methods which use different characteristic functions. The
Onset module of QuakeMigrate was thus designed to act as a plug-inthe base option remains the
STA/LTA, but the interface between the onset calculation stage and the rest of the machinery has
been designed such that any continuous function can be migrated and stacked. I have implemented
plug-ins for, and explored, two such alternative functions: the gradient kurtosis algorithm, a
statistical measure of the fourth standardised moment (e.g. Poiata et al., 2016); and an onset
function based on the Generalized Phase Detection algorithm of Ross et al. (2018), which uses a
deep learning technique from the field of artificial intelligence. The theory outlined by Drew et al.
(2013) remains appropriate, provided that the mapping between the arrival time uncertainty and the
arrival time height to the width and height of the peaks in the corresponding onset function holds
approximately.

Panels c and d show the corresponding STA/LTA and kurtosis gradient onset functions for each

Figure 2.9 shows a comparison of the STA/LTA and kurtosis gradient onset functions applied to a
synthetic phase arrival with two different levels of Gaussian noise. The synthetic is generated by
applying a 420 Hz bandpass filter (order 4) to a Heaviside-step function, sampled at 200 Hz. It is
clear from the resulting onset functions presented in Figure 2.9c-d that they both produce peaks in
response to the phase arrival, with some degree of variation between them that is a function of both
20 Theory and Methods
the method and the level of noise. STA/LTA window lengths of 0.15/1.0 s were used, respectively,
and the decay time constant of 0.2 s was used for the recursive kurtosis algorithm. The peak of the
STA/LTA onset functions (shown as the blue curves) in both noise scenarios capture the true phase
onset time well, which is important when seeking accurate migrations. On the other hand, while the
kurtosis gradient onset functions (shown as the pink curves) have sharper peaks, they are somewhat
time lagged from the true arrival. These errors will propagate cumulatively for each station used in
the migration and stacking, resulting a lower degree of resolution in the final location. Errors in
the velocity model, or sampling the search volume too coarsely, can lead to over-/under-migration,
which may mean the peaks are too narrow to stack coherently and some events may go undetected.
Both, however, are robust in the presence of Gaussian noise, though the kurtosis gradient onset
peak remains sharper, with a higher amplitude. The important point, however, is that both functions
still produce strong peaks relative to periods of time with no phase arrivals.
The adaptability of the Onset module has thus been established and provides an excellent platform
on which to develop and implement new algorithms within the migration and stacking field.
2.2.2 Detect
The principal goal of the Detect stage of is to generate a time series, in which peaks correspond to
an earthquake somewhere within the search volume. Since there is no strict requirement in this
stage for the function to be fundamentally grounded in a framework that is a direct representation
of the physical problem, it can be treated more as pragmatic exercise. This allows for a degree of
freedom when choosing how to calculate the continuous imaging function and subsequently extract
candidate events from it (see Section 2.2.3).
In this stage, the waveform data are continuously migrated into the search volume using the pre-
calculated traveltime lookup tables (LUTs). At each timestep and at every node, the coalescence
function is calculated as the time-shifted stack of the onset functions using the stacking (or imaging)
operator. The basic core stacking function, fC(x, t), in QuakeMigrate is defined as the geometric
mean of the individual onset functions, Oi(t), for each station, expressed mathematically as
fC(x, t) =
Oi (t + i(x)), (2.3)
where x is the spatial location of the node, t is the timestep, i is the relative shift determined
using the corresponding traveltime LUT, and N is the total number of stations. The use of
the geometric mean is strictly required to satisfy the construction of the continuous posterior
probability distribution function for event origins from the continuous onset functions (which are
representations of the probability distribution function for the arrival of a seismic phase). This
2.2 QuakeMigrate 21
expression is converted from a product (which can be a significantly more expensive floating point
operation than addition) to a summation using the basic logarithm rule log(ab) = log(a)+ log(b).
Thus, Equation 2.3 becomes
fC(x, t) = exp
i=1 ln [Oi (t + i(x))]
. (2.4)
The strength of this technique lies in the use of the geometric mean, which is significantly less
sensitive to outliers. This makes the problem inherently sensitive to earthquakes with a range of
source magnitudes without having to perform extensive tuning, as well as remaining robust in the
presence of stochastic noise. Efforts have been made, however, to ensure that the stacking operator
can be changed without impacting the machinery of the rest of the package, in order to facilitate
the incorporation of other methods (e.g. Grigoli et al., 2013).
For each instantaneous 3-D coalescence map, the peak coalescence value (and corresponding
position within search volume) is picked and is output for further analysis. This differs from the
treatment of the 4-D coalescence function in Locate, in which it is used to form the posterior
probability distribution function of the hypocentral parameters. In addition to this continuous
coalescence, a normalised coalescence function is calculated, in which the peak value is normalised
by the mean coalescence value in the 3-D coalescence map at that instantaneous timestamp
fNC(x, t) =
fC(x, t)
ni,n j,nk
i, j,k=1 fC(x, t)
, (2.5)
where fNC(x, t) and fC(x, t) represent the continuous location of the coalescence function peak
within the 3-D search volume with dimensions (ni,n j,nk). This can be used to help smooth out
changes in the background level of coalescence values, such as during the coda of a large event.
The outputs of this stage are: 5 continuous time series recording the peak coalescence value, the
peak normalised coalescence, and the corresponding x/y/z coordinates of the peak coalescence
values at each timestamp, stored using the miniSEED file format; and files containing an assessment
of the waveform data availability at each timestep, which can be useful for diagnosing periods of
reduced network sensitivity before triggering.
2.2.3 Trigger
With an initial, continuous scan of the data archive performed, the next step is to identify a list of
candidate events from the output coalescence traces. These candidate events will then be used to
re-migrate and stack the original waveform data, typically on a higher resolution grid, and calculate
accurate origin times and locations, along with the associated uncertainties. This exercise is

and green shaded regions. For instances where the MEI of one candidate event overlaps with the
MW of another, the two events are consolidated, with the largest amplitude peak retained. The red

essentially one of peak finding, though it is often complicated by the dependence of the continuous
coalescence streams on a number of factors, including (but not limited to) network geometry, the
availability of waveform data at stations in the network through time, ambient noise levels, and
the source properties of the earthquakes. This has been addressed by the development of multiple
options for the determination of the triggering threshold, with the dynamic options (detailed below)
capable of minimising the number of false triggers with minimal manual interference. Candidate
earthquakes are triggered from the (normalised) continuous maximum coalescence amplitude
(CMCA) trace. Three pieces of information are required by the peak finding algorithm: a threshold
value above which to trigger candidate earthquakes; a marginal window around the peakused
to marginalise the probability distribution function over the time variablewhich captures the
uncertainty in the origin time, in itself a function of uncertainties in the velocity model; and a mini-
mum event interval, which is used to avoid multiple triggers for a single event while it converges
on the true maximum. These parameters and the general triggering process are summarised in
Figure 2.10. In addition to this basic procedure, it is also possible to apply a Gaussian filter to the
2.2 QuakeMigrate 23
input coalescence time series before triggering, which strongly suppresses short-lived, noise-related
spikes in the coalescence value without adversely impacting longer duration peaks.
The triggering of candidate earthquakes is sensitive to the threshold value. Too low a threshold
value results in many false candidate event triggers, while with too high a threshold value one
risks missing real events. A simple static threshold is often sufficient to capture the majority of
the detectable events, but the base level of coalescence (essentially a measure of coherent energy
sources) within the system (the search volume) can change through time, as described above. In
such cases, the user can choose to use a dynamic trigger threshold that is determined as some scalar
multiple of a measure of the continuous coalescence that is insensitive to changes in the absolute
coalescence values. Two metrics are providedthe median absolute deviation (MAD) and the
median ratioboth of which are designed to detect outliers (i.e. peaks) in the peak coalescence
value time series and implicitly deal with systematic changes in the background coalescence value.

24 Theory and Methods
The MAD method defines the threshold, T , as
TMAD = Mmedian(|xi  x|) , (2.6)
where x is the median of the CMCA over some user-defined time window and M is the user-defined
MAD multiplier, representing the number of standard deviations from the background that is
required for a detection.
The median ratio, on the other hand, is simply defined as some multiple, M, of the median value of
the coalescence time series over some user-defined time window
TMR = Mmedian(x). (2.7)
Unlike the MAD threshold function, this threshold function is capable of responding to changes in
the background coalescence related to station dropout or changes in the background noise profile,
while still being sensitive to intense, swarm-like periods of seismic activity.
The outputs of this stage are: a set of files containing a list of triggered events within each
24-hour period of input coalescence data; and a corresponding set of summary figures showing
the coalescence through time, the trigger threshold, and the triggered event locations, which are
invaluable for assessing and tuning the trigger parameters. An example of the Trigger summary
plots created by QuakeMigrate using a dynamic trigger threshold is shown in Figure 2.11.
2.2.4 Locate
With an initial catalogue of candidate events identified from the coarse first pass, the goal now is to
compute accurate origin parameters for each event. This is performed in a near-identical fashion
to the Detect stage, but using short windows of continuous waveform recordingsequal to four
times the user-defined marginal windowcut according to the triggered origin time. By using
fewer input data, one can greatly increase the grid resolution without prohibitively increasing the
computational resource costs. The resulting 4-D coalescence map is marginalised over some time
window (representative of the origin time uncertainty), which results in a 3-D coalescence map that
can be treated as the posterior probability distribution function describing the best estimate of the
source location and, critically, its spatial uncertainty. A sub-gridded estimate for the location of the
peak in the PDF is returned from a sub-sampled 3-D spline function fitted locally to the coalescence
map around its maximum. Separately, a 3-D Gaussian function is also fitted locallyafter applying
modest Gaussian smoothingin order to characterise the shape of the peak and a (parameterised)
quantitative estimate of the location uncertainty.
2.2 QuakeMigrate 25
The principal outputs of this stage are: an event file for each successfully located event detailing
the origin time, location, and a number of statistical measures related to the location uncertainty;
and a corresponding set of summary figures for each event showing 2-D slices through the peak of
the marginalised coalescence map, a station gather, and the coalescence function through time. In
addition, a number of optional outputs have been tacked on to the Locate stage which can be used
for analysis in later parts of the complete seismic workflow, including automatic phase picking,
trimmed event miniSEED files, and local magnitude estimations. Some of these optional outputs
have been described below. There is scope to further expand the optional outputs with plug-ins,
should there be a need.

Fig. 2.12 Example automatic phase picking summary plot from QuakeMigrate. General information
regarding the pick times and related statistics are reported in the top left. The upper and middle
panels show pre-processed waveform data (on the vertical and horizontal components at the left
and right, respectively), and the bottom panels show onset functions computed from them. Red
and blue windows indicate the picking windows, within which a Gaussian function (blue curve) is
fitted to the maximum amplitude peak in the onset function, if it exceeds the user-defined, adaptive
threshold (blue horizontal line). Vertical red and blue lines indicate the time of the P and S phase
picks, respectively, and dashed lines denote 1 uncertainty. This example is taken from the full
earthquake catalogue presented in Chapter 10.
Automatic phase picking
One of the optional outputs from the Locate stage is automatic phase picks. The inbuilt algorithm is
based on the premise that the STA/LTA onset function is a reliable representation of the probability
density function for a phase arrival with Gaussian properties. An initial phase arrival time prediction
is determined using the optimal hypocentral location and origin time and the traveltime lookup
26 Theory and Methods
tables. A search window is defined around this predicted arrival time with a half-width equal to a
user-defined fraction of the phase traveltime plus the marginal window, which allows for errors in
the velocity model. A pick threshold is then determined using the onset data outside of these pick
windows. The MAD threshold calculation from the Trigger stage is then utilised here in order to
determine whether or not to make a phase pick, which helps to remove the identification of peaks
in the onset functions that do not exceed the background noise. Finally, a Gaussian function is fit to
the onset function data that exceeds the determined threshold, with an initial half-width equal to
half the short-term average window. An example of this applied to data presented in Chapter 10 is
shown in Figure 2.12.
As indicated in Figure 2.2, the phase picking step has been isolated and a clean interface between
the core QuakeMigrate package has been created in order to enable users to implement custom
phase picking algorithms e.g. the Generalised Phase Detection method (Ross et al., 2018). It can
also be run independently after an initial run of the Locate stage using the basic outputs, which
facilitates efficiently tuning the phase picking parameters.
Local magnitude estimation
It is also possible to calculate local magnitude estimates automatically using QuakeMigrate
specific details of the implementation are available in Winder (2021). This module can be run
concurrently with the Locate stage, or as a stand-alone function using the base information output
by the Locate stage. The implementation follows the method for local magnitude estimation
outlined in Section 2.3 and is used in Chapter 10.
2.3 Earthquake magnitudes
Earthquake magnitude scales attempt to objectively quantify the size of an earthquake based on
instrumental recordings, with the aim being to relate some measure of the waveforms to the amount
of energy radiated from the source. However, we are limited by our ability to only sparsely sample
the wavefield using seismometers at the Earths surface. A number of different magnitude scales
have been developed, such as the well-known and generic Richter scale, which focus on different
aspects of the waveform data to produce a magnitude. The first magnitude scale, developed by
Richter (Richter, 1935), was based on the maximum amplitude of displacement measured on a
Wood-Anderson seismograph. The scale, known as the local magnitude (ML) scale (or more widely
as simply the Richter scale), is logarithmic in nature and a magnitude zero earthquake is defined as
one which produces 1 micron of displacement on a Wood-Anderson seismometer at a distance of
100 km. Each unit increment represents a 10-fold increase in the amplitude of the displacements,
or a roughly 32-fold increase in the seismic energy released by an earthquake.
2.3 Earthquake magnitudes 27
Using this scale, the local magnitude, ML,i j, at a given station i measured on component j, can be
summarised as the equation
ML,i j = log10 Ai j  log10 A0(r)+Si j, (2.8)
where Ai j is one-half the maximum displacement observed on a Wood-Anderson seismograph i on
component j (in mm), A0 is an empirical relationship that depends only on the distance, r, between
the source and the receiver (in km), and Si j is a station-component specific correction term. The
function, A0, encapsulates information on the attenuation properties of the crust, meaning it must
be calibrated specifically for the study region. The modern formulation of the scale is defined
such that a reference event of magnitude 3 recorded at 17 km distance should produce 10 mm of
displacement (Hutton and Boore, 1987). The change in definition was motivated by the observation
that should the attenuation profile of the earth within the first 100 km exhibit large geographic
variation, then earthquakes in two regions with the same ML may have different ground motions
near the source. The correction term, A0(r), is hence defined as
 log10 A0(r) = n log10(ri j/17)+K(ri j 17)+2.0, (2.9)
where n and K are region-specific constants to be determined from regression analysis (Hutton and
Boore, 1987). In modern applications, using data recorded on non-Wood-Anderon seismographs,
one must first deconvolve the instrument-specific response function from the waveform data
to produce the true ground motion, then convolve this with the Wood-Anderson seismograph
response function (poles and zeroes are provided in Table 2.1). This simulates the expected ground
motion for a Wood-Anderson seismograph. From this, the maximum peak-to-trough amplitude can
then be picked on all components in a window around the P and S phase arrivals (as predicted by
the automatic picking routine detailed in Section 2.2.4).

The moment magnitude scale was introduced by Kanamori (1977) in order to avoid the problem of
saturation that afflicts the local magnitude scale at high magnitudes. The scalar seismic moment of
an earthquakemeasured from amplitude spectra at low frequencies or observations of fault areas
and amount of slippageis a useful quantification of the size of an earthquake that is inherently
tied to the dimensions and elastic shear stiffness of the source fault. The moment magnitude scale
coincides with the empirical relationship between the seismic moment and local magnitudes, as
28 Theory and Methods
defined by Thatcher and Hanks (1973), while naturally extending to much larger earthquakes.
In Chapter 10, the methods outlined here are used to calculate local magnitudes for the seismically
active region around the Mount Kinabalu massif, northern Borneo.
2.4 Seismic moment tensors
The focal mechanism of an earthquake describes the origin of the rupture that was responsible for
the event, and how it propagated. Earthquakes are primarilythough not exclusivelyassociated
with the release of elastic strain between two bodies of rock, with this delineation commonly

Fig. 2.13 An overview of the different seismic moments that comprise the 33 matrix description
of the seismic moment tensor. The elements on the diagonal (e.g. Mxx) are linear vector dipoles,
while the off-diagonal elements are moments defined by force couples. For example, Mxy represents
a couple where the forces act along the x-axis, separated by some distance along the y-axis.
2.4 Seismic moment tensors 29
referred to as a fault. Faults can be broadly classified by the direction of motion (or slip) relative
to the fault plane, falling into two main categories: strike-slip faults, such as the North Anatolian
Fault, are commonly associated with transformational plate boundaries, wherein tectonic stresses
are accommodated by lateral motion between two plates; and dip-slip faults, either normal or
reverse, which are commonly associated with extensional (divergent) or compressional (convergent)
tectonics, respectively. Hence there is much to be learned about the tectonic regime of a seismically
active region through the determination and interpretation of focal mechanisms.
The seismic moment tensor, from which the focal mechanism can be derived, is a general and
useful representation of the source mechanism of a point-source earthquake (valid for microseismic
events) in a closed system. In this formulation, any given earthquake can be described as the linear
combination of the 9 base seismic moments (represented by force couples) that make up the second-
order, 33 seismic moment tensor, Mi j (see Figure 2.13). Angular momentum is conserved by
constraining this tensor to being symmetric, which reduces the number of independent components
from 9 to 6. While there exist source descriptions that include an asymmetrical component, they
are not commonly considered and often correspond to unique problems. The seismic moment
tensor of an earthquake can be estimated using waveform data recorded at seismic instruments in
the far field. The derivation of focal mechanisms of microseismic earthquakes is complicated by
uncertainties in the velocity model and other near-source heterogeneities, which rules out the use
of full-waveform methods based on pre-calculated Green functions. Instead, one must use other
observables, such as P- and S-wave polarities and amplitude ratios, which are far more robust in
these regimes (Reasenberg and Oppenheimer, 1985). Naturally, there are still uncertainties arising
from imperfect knowledge of the velocity model, which is required for the calculation of azimuths
and take-off angles of the rays from the source to the instruments, but these can be incorporated
into the inversion scheme. Moment tensor solutions are commonly represented graphically on
lower-hemisphere projection plots (beachball" diagrams, Figure 2.14), from which one can often

visually ascertain the mechanism.
In Chapter 10, I generate (purely double-couple) fault plane solutions using the program MTfit
(Pugh and White, 2018; Pugh et al., 2016a,b), to investigate the source mechanisms of earthquakes
around the Mount Kinabalu massif. MTfit probabilistically solves for the seismic moment tensor
within a Bayesian framework, providing a natural means of incorporating the measurement uncer-
tainties associated with moment tensor estimation (e.g. location and velocity model uncertainties)
into the inversion, which can be significant in the case of microseismicity. I have used P phase
polarities as my input data, which are incorporated into the source probability density function
using Bayesian marginalisation, assuming the uncertainties follow a Gaussian distribution. These
new observations are supplemented by the centroid moment tensor (CMT) solutions (Dziewonski
et al., 1981) for a number of previously identified and catalogued events, retrieved from the global
CMT catalogue (Ekstrm et al., 2012), and are used to explore how present-day seismic activity in
the region is related to the various models for the tectonic history of Sabah.
2.5 Seismic anisotropy
Seismic anisotropy, the directional dependence of seismic wavespeeds, is evident within the earth
across a wide range of scalesfrom the crust (Bastow et al., 2010; Boness and Zoback, 2006;
Crampin, 1994; Holtzman et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2011; Keir et al., 2005) and upper mantle
(Silver and Chan, 1988, 1991; Vinnik et al., 1984), through the mantle transition zone and even
the deepest part of the mantle at the core-mantle boundary (CMB; Kendall and Silver, 1996;
McNamara et al., 2002), and even within the core (Morelli et al., 1986; Poupinet et al., 1983).
Seismic anisotropy can arise either as an intrinsic property of the mediuma direct result of
the constitutive materials crystalline structureotherwise known as intrinsic anisotropy, or an
apparent, bulk property of a medium (e.g. compositional layering), known as extrinsic anisotropy.
The anisotropic structure of a rock reflects the anisotropic field, such as the stress field, in which
the rock was formed or has been deformed. As a seismic wave propagates through the Earth, an
history of the anisotropic structures it encounters is encoded into the waveforms that are recorded
at the surface. Imaging is also complicated by the band-limited nature of recordings of the seismic
wavefield. Due to the fact that the waveform signals generated by earthquakes possess a dominant
period, the Fresnel zones (the spatial region to which a finite-frequency waveform is sensitive) of
these signals may encompass multiple anisotropic sub-regions. Seismic waves are thus sensitive
to the "bulk" anisotropic properties along the path, making them an indicator of long-range order
within the bulk medium, where features smaller than the seismic wavelength (e.g. crystals, cracks,
pores, layers, or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. While it is impossible to fully decode
this history from recorded waveforms, there exist a number of simplifying schemes through which
it is possible to measure the anisotropic structures within the Earth. Primary among them is
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 31
the inversion of records of shear-wave splitting for the orientation and strength/thickness of an
anisotropic layer situated beneath the seismic instrument (see Section 2.5.2). In the following
section, I briefly outline the physics underpinning the shear-wave splitting phenomenon before
discussing the mechanisms responsible for generating seismic anisotropy within the Earth.
2.5.1 Elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media
For detailed discussions of the theory of seismic wave propagation in anisotropic media, on which
this section is based, see e.g. Babuka and Cara (1991); Silver (1996).
Within the linear elastic theory of continuum mechanics, seismic anisotropy enters the elastody-
namic equations of motion through the fourth-order stiffness tensor, composed of 81 independent
elastic moduli. This tensor formally relates the applied stress, i j, to the resulting deformation of
an elastic body, kl , via Hookes law
i j =Ci jklkl. (2.10)
The 81 independent elastic moduli can be reduced to 36 through a number of symmetry arguments.
Firstly
Ci jkl =C jikl, (2.11)
due to the symmetry of i j. Secondly
Ci jkl =Ci jlk, (2.12)
due to the symmetry of kl . And finally, these 36 independent moduli can be reduced further by
Ci jkl =Ckli j, (2.13)
the hyperelastic symmetry, which is derived by thermodynamic arguments (e.g. Nye, 1985). As-
suming a perfectly elastic material, all of the energy put in while deforming it can be recovered by
allowing the material to return to its equilibrium position. This means that the integral of the strain
energy density associated with a given strain is path independent, which is only true if Equation
2.13 is true. Overall, the number of independent elastic moduli is reduced from 81 to 21. Hence,
the 3333 stiffness tensor can be expressed in Voigts representation as the symmetric 66

For an anisotropic body, the required number of independent elastic parameters depends on the form
of material symmetry the body possesses. For seismological problems, it is generally appropriate
to assume the form of symmetry as either hexagonal or orthorhombic (Babuka and Cara, 1991).
Anisotropy with a hexagonal symmetry is fully characterised by five independent elastic parameters.
This form of symmetry, sometimes called transverse isotropy, has a single plane of isotropy and a
principal axis of rotational symmetry i.e. the material appears isotropic in any direction normal to
this principal axis. Taking this axis of rotational symmetry to lie along x3, the stiffness matrix can
be expressed, without loss of generality, as

Orthorhombic media are characterised by three mutually orthogonal axes of symmetry. The
crystalline lattice structure of olivine, an intrinsically anisotropic mineral, belongs to this symmetry
group, which can be fully characterised by nine independent elastic parameters. Assuming the
symmetry axes coincide with the coordinate axes, the stiffness matrix takes the form

Stiffness matrices for a number of constitutive minerals, which can belong to one of nine possible
symmetry systems, have been determined experimentally. These matrices can be used to establish
the theoretical anisotropic properties of aggregates of minerals possessing a certain degree of
preferential alignment or being composed of various minerals in different proportions (e.g. Hill,
1952; Reu, 1929; Voigt, 1928). For an aggregate of different minerals, Voigt (1928) proposed the
averagingover all possible lattice orientationof the relations expressing the stress in a single
crystal in terms of the given strain, assuming that the strain is uniform throughout the aggregate.
The Voigt average elastic moduli for a composite material comprised of i different minerals are
described mathematically by
fiMi, (2.18)
where Mi and fi are the elastic moduli and fractional proportion for each constitutive mineral,
respectively. Conversely, Reu (1929) proposed the averaging of the relations expressing the strain
in terms of the given stress, assuming that the stress is uniform throughout an aggregate. Thus,
the Reuss average elastic moduli for a composite material comprised of i different minerals are
described mathematically by
, (2.19)
where again Mi and fi are the elastic moduli and fractional proportion for each constitutive mineral,
respectively. Hill (1952) subsequently demonstrated, by appealing to conservation of energy
arguments, that these to aggregate averages are in fact the maximum and minimum bounds on
the elastic moduli of the composite material, respectively. In the same work, they proposed the
arithmetic mean of the two, MV RH =
MV+MR
2 , as an approximation that more closely matched the
experimental observations, known as the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average.
In a homogeneous anisotropic medium, the elastodynamic equations of motion can be written as
j,k,l
Ci jkl
x jxl
, (2.20)
34 Theory and Methods
for i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3, where  is density, ui is displacement, t is time, x is the spatial coordinate,
and Ci jkl is the elastic tensor.
Without loss of generality, we can restrict our analysis to waves propagating in the direction x1 and
derive equations of motion for waves polarised against x1, x2, and x3. A harmonic plane wave has
the form
ui() = Aiw()exp[iwt], (2.21)
where Ai is the complex vector amplitude, and w() is the wavelet function that is composed from
the source time function, the instrument response, and the attenuation operator. Inserting this into
Equation 2.20, we arrive at the Christoffel equation
(Mi j c2i j)a j = 0, (2.22)
where i j is Kronecker delta, a j is the amplitude (incorporating the polarisation) vector, c is the
phase velocity, and Mi j are the components of the 33 Christoffel matrix, which is a function of
the elastic properties of the medium and direction of wave propagation
Mi j =Ci jklnknl. (2.23)
The eigenpair solutions to Equation 2.22 correspond to the direction of displacement (the po-
larisation, given by the eigenvectors) and the respective wavespeeds squared (the eigenvalues)
for the 3 wavesthe quasi-P wave, which is polarised sub-parallel to the propagation direction;
and the two quasi-S waves, which lie in the plane normal to the quasi-P wave polarisation. The
terminology quasi is adopted because the polarisations of the waves in an anisotropic medium
are no longer strictly parallel or perpendicular to the direction of propagation. A key implication
is that a body wave that is polarised in the direction of one of these three eigenvectors does not
experience a polarisation change. A body wave entering the medium that is not polarised in one
of these directions, however, will be split into a P wave and two quasi-S waves, which are often
called the fast and slow S waves. This phenomenon is called shear-wave splitting (see Section 2.5.2).
In order to interpret observations of seismic anisotropy in the context of geodynamic processes,
one must understand the process of anisotropic structure formation. Material anisotropy arises at a
range of depths and in a number of settings. Here, I will provide a short summary of the principal
mechanisms that underpin the formation of seismic anisotropy.
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 35
Lattice-preferred orientation (LPO)
The structures of crystalline materials are described by regular, periodic arrangements of atoms,
otherwise known as lattices. These lattice structures possess some form of material symmetry (e.g.
orthorhombic or hexagonal, the two most important for most studies of seismic anisotropy), which
plays a fundamental role in determining the physical properties of the mineral, such as the degree
of elastic anisotropy. Most crystalline rocks, however, commonly comprise numerous independent
crystalline sub-regions (or grains), separated by grain boundaries (or, indeed, are an aggregate of
many different minerals). If these grains are completely randomly oriented with respect to one other,
the bulk properties of the material will be isotropic (if viewed at a sufficiently long wavelength),
irrespective of the fact that the base mineral is anisotropic. The non-random distribution of this
crystallographic orientation, on the other hand, can give rise to the macroscopic manifestation
of the underlying symmetry and thus physical properties, particularly elastic anisotropy. This
phenomenonknown as both lattice- or crystallographic-preferred orientation (LPO or CPO)
anisotropy, or simply fabricis one of the principal mechanisms responsible for seismic anisotropy
in a range of settings, particularly the upper mantle. The formation of LPO is controlled by the field
in which a rock was either formed and/or deformed. When caused by deformation, LPO depends on
both the deformation mechanism as well as the geometry of deformation. In fact, the geometry of
deformation plays a more critical and direct role in controlling LPO than the orientation of applied
stress (Karato, 2008). LPO can form in a material composed of anisotropic minerals through
several distinct processes, but the primary mechanism in the upper mantle is plastic flow, which is
principally accommodated by dislocation slip (i.e. inter-crystalline slip of atoms) (Mainprice and
Nicolas, 1989).
Olivine, the most abundant mineral in the Earths upper mantle (constituting over 50%), is strongly
anisotropic25% in VP and 12% in VS (Nicolas and Christensen, 1987). It has been shown experi-
mentally to form LPO under both simple shear, wherein the a-axis is preferentially aligned in the
direction of shear, and uniaxial strain (i.e. compression or extension), wherein the a-axis is rotated
towards the direction of elongation. Figure 2.15 shows the pole figures for this form of fabric,
known as A-type olivine fabric. These two mechanisms are thought to be responsible for the major-
ity of the anisotropy observed in the upper mantle. In the asthenosphere, the mechanically weak
and ductile portion of the upper mantle, simple shear (i.e. simple asthenospheric flow) generated by
the relative motion of the overriding lithospheric plate is commonly invoked to explain observations
of anisotropic fabric beneath (often oceanic) lithosphere that is sub-parallel to the Absolute Plate
Motion (APM). In continental regions, particularly where there is strong evidence of past tectonic
compression (e.g. orogenic belts) or extension (e.g. slab rollback or rifting), shear-wave splitting
results have revealed a prevalence of anisotropic fabric aligned with lithospheric structures left
behind by deformational events (Silver and Chan, 1991). The fabric formed in such events is
commonly termed fossil anisotropy, as it is formed during active deformation and frozen into
36 Theory and Methods

the lithosphere during post-tectonic thermal relaxation (Barruol et al., 1998; Vauchez and Nicolas,
1991). Complex patterns of anisotropy, both laterally and as a function source-receiver geometry,
are often seen in active subduction zones (e.g. Audoine et al., 2004; Eakin et al., 2015; Russo
and Silver, 1994), with some authors invoking complex, 3-D mantle flow around the subducting
lithosphere as the mechanism responsible for the observations (e.g. Levin et al., 2004).
Changes in the dominant stress regime can quickly (a few Myr) overprint LPO in the asthenosphere
via recrystallisation (e.g. Mainprice and Silver, 1993; Nicolas et al., 1973). Diffusional creepan
important mechanism of plastic deformation in low-stress and high-temperature settings, such as
the mid- to lower mantledoes not have any rotational component and, consequently, does not
result in significant LPO. In fact, it has been reported that a pre-existing fabric can be destroyed by
diffusional creep (Edington et al., 1976), which is likely why the lower-mantle does not appear
to be significantly anisotropic (e.g. Montagner and Kennett, 1996), despite the large regions of
coherent flow generated by mantle convection.
The picture is complicated somewhat by the fact that olivine can form different deformation fabrics,
depending on the deformation geometry and the physical and chemical conditions under which
deformation takes place. The dominant deformation fabrics for olivine are mapped out in the
stress/water content parameter space fabric diagram shown in Figure 2.16. The most common
form of olivine fabric, A-type, occupies the low-to-mid stress regime and low water content region
of the parameter spacefor this fabric, the polarisation of the fast shear wave is parallel to the
direction of flow/extension/compression. This is also true for C- and E-type fabric, but not for
B-type (Karato, 2008). Conversely, for B-type fabric the fast shear wave is polarised normal to
the direction flow. Not only that, but the different types of fabric also affect the VSH/VSV ratio in

different ways (Karato, 2008). It is thus critical that these factors are considered when interpreting
measurements of seismic anisotropy in terms of the underlying geodynamic processes.
Shape-preferred orientation (SPO)
The other principal mechanism capable of generating seismic anisotropy on an observable scale is
shape-preferred orientation (SPO) anisotropy, which is a form of extrinsic anisotropy. There exist
a number of different underlying mechanisms capable of generating SPO anisotropy, including
(but not limited to): the preferential alignment of macroscopic fractures, commonly related to the
damage zones around fault systems; sequential layering of isotropic elastic materials (e.g. sedi-
mentary basins); the presence of pockets of melt within the rock medium; and, most importantly
for the work presented in Chapter 4, the preferential closure of fluid-saturated micro-cracks in
response to the maximum compressive stress. As is evident from the name, the common theme
between each of these mechanisms is the presence of non-random structural or geometrical ordering
of features within an elastic body. The strength of the apparent anisotropy is a function of the
degree of orderinga higher degree of non-random ordering leads to a higher aggregate degree
of anisotropyas well as the elastic properties of the constitutive materials (e.g. the underlying
strength of anisotropy at the crystal level), if appropriate. It has been shown that a number of these
mechanisms will have a hexagonal symmetry system (Backus, 1962), which enables one to use the
same approximating methods for the determination of the anisotropic parameters, such as those
38 Theory and Methods
measurable from shear-wave splitting. Below, I briefly discuss the bodies of work supporting each
mechanism.
Backus (1962) provides a review of the body of work treating the problem of elastic wave propaga-
tion in finely layered media. The work then goes on to demonstrate that for a horizontally layered,
inhomogeneous medium, whose properties are constant over some vertical height l, the medium
will appear to behave like a homogeneous transversely isotropic (TI) medium at wavelengths longer
than l. A system of analytical equations are presented relating the elastic coefficients of the two
composite materials to the five elastic coefficients of this TI medium, from which an effective
stiffness tensor can be constructed. This mechanism is important when considering settings with
horizontal layers of material, such as in sedimentary basins (e.g. Valcke et al., 2006), but the vertical
orientation of the axis of transverse isotropy means such layers predominantly affect surface waves
(i.e. VSV and VSH ) and are ineffective at producing significant shear-wave splitting. However, it
may play a small role in generating anisotropy in the middle layers of oceanic crust, which are
composed of sheeted dykesif the difference in elastic properties between each dyke intrusion
is significant enough, this may result in weak anisotropy. This seems unlikely, however, to be
distinguishable globally given the relative strength and thickness of such a layer.
Macroscopic fracture systems associated with large-scale faulting within a region (i.e. the damage
zone around the fault) can also induce significant SPO anisotropy (Boness and Zoback, 2006).
The presence of cracks and pore space within an elastic medium will impact seismic wave speeds,
particularly for shear waves. If these fractures are randomly oriented, then the medium will appear
homogeneous at long wavelengths. However, as with the preferential alignment of crystalline
grains in LPO anisotropy, should the orientation of fractures be non-random then this will manifest
as seismic anisotropy. Shear waves polarised in the plane of the aligned fractures are less inhibited
than those polarised perpendicular to them. Boness and Zoback (2006) observed a significant
deviation in the orientation of the fast axis of seismic anisotropy around the San Andreas fault,
California. Stations deployed directly on top of the fault displayed  values that were aligned with
the fault strike. Away from the damage zone, the observations are controlled by the background
maximum compressive stress, SHmax, which is, in general, at a high angle to the fault. These results
are illustrated in Figure 2.17. Consequently, it can be useful to consider the presence of faults
and the associated damage zones when trying to distinguish between structural and stress-induced
anisotropy (discussed below). However, it is likely that the fault (and hence the associated damage
zone) has to be fairly substantial in scale for such structurally induced SPO anisotropy to be
manifest in the observations of shear-wave splitting.
The presence of meltsas might be expected in, for example, volcanic environments and in the
upper mantlecan also play a significant role in the generation of seismic anisotropy (Kendall,
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 39

1994). The preferred alignment of melt inclusions (oriented melt pocket, OMP, anisotropy) is a
very effective way of generating anisotropy, with the shape of such melt inclusions being a key
control on the strength of anisotropy. The azimuthal behaviour of surface wave velocities (i.e. VSH
and VSV ) produced by OMP anisotropy is indistinguishable from that produced by LPO anisotropy,
both of which vary as  cos(2) for VSV and  cos(4) for VSH . The absolute magnitudes of the
velocities, however, can be used as a diagnostic, because the presence of melt also acts to reduce
shear wave velocities (e.g. Bastow et al., 2010). Shear-wave splitting occurs when waves propagate
in the same plane as the flat faces of the inclusions, which is likely to reflect the mode by which the
melt has been incorporated into the crust and the dominant stresses in the region. This mechanism
has been shown to play an important role in generation of seismic anisotropy observed in the East
African Rift (Ayele et al., 2004; Bastow et al., 2010; Keir et al., 2005; Kendall et al., 2006, 2005)
and is thus likely to be important in other regions with high melt volumes, such as the Icelandic rift.
The final relevant mechanism of generating seismic anisotropy in the brittle crust, which is par-
ticularly important for the work presented in Chapter 4, is stress-induced anisotropy arising from
the preferential closure of cracks. Pore spaces and small cracks within a medium are held open
by pore pressure and close gradually with depth as the lithostatic overburden pressure exceeds the
pore pressure. However, in the shallow portion of the brittle crust for which the crack density is
non-zero, anisotropy can arise through the preferential opening (closing) of these cracks. Shear
waves polarised in (or normal to) the plane will thus be insensitive (or sensitive) to the cracks, which
40 Theory and Methods
act to reduce the shear wave speed. This mechanism presents an opportunity to make inferences
on the state of the stress field in the shallow crust from observations of shear-wave splitting. This
is particularly valuable when considering the impact of transient changes to the stress field, for
example when a dyke intrudes into the crust (gstsdttir et al., 2016; Illsley-Kemp et al., 2018;
Sigmundsson et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2019).
Expressions for the effective stiffness tensor for a medium hosting aligned inclusions (both dry
and fluid-filled) have been derived in a number of works (Hudson, 1980, 1981, 1986; Tandon
and Weng, 1984), which can be used to analytically model the degree of seismic anisotropy and,
subsequently, shear-wave splitting as a function of the crack density and aspect ratio. In addition
to these parameters, the impact of whether the cracks are empty or contain a fluid (such as melt)
or some other material were considered, as well as the effective stiffness tensor for a medium
hosting multiple families of cracks with different orientations. As with most efforts to describe
natural phenomena with a set of analytical expressions, such modelling comes with a number of
caveats. For example, it is commonly assumed that the inclusions possess a particular shape an are
uniformly distributed throughout the medium under investigation. Despite this, such modelling can
provide useful bounds on the potential for a particular mechanism to explain a set of observations.
Effective media modelling is used in Chapter 5 to explore the potential for melt inclusions in
the crust around Askja volcano to explain observations of elevated VP/VS ratios and shear wave
anisotropy derived from shear-wave splitting measurements.
2.5.2 Shear-wave splitting
Shear-wave splitting is one of the most unambiguous indicators of seismic anisotropy. When a
linearly polarised shear wave impinges on an anisotropic medium it is partitioned into two quasi-S
waves, which propagate with different wavespeeds. The polarisation of these two waves, commonly
called fast (denoted  hereafter) and slow, is determined by the symmetry and orientation of the
anisotropic elastic tensor. A time lag,  t, accrues between the polarised waves as they propagate
through the region, with the final integrated value proportional to both the path length and the
strength of anisotropy. Providing the degree of splitting is sufficiently small ( t  the period of
the shear wave), then the particle motion of the two components that lie in the plane tangential to
the ray direction will appear elliptical. Figure 2.18 shows a schematic summary of this phenomenon.
Following on from the mathematical description of elastic wave propagation in homogeneous,
anisotropic media (Section 2.5.1), the phenomenon of shear-wave splitting can be represented
as the application of a series of geometric operations to the components of the shear phase in
the horizontal plane. First, the (initially) linearly polarised phase is projected into the coordinate
system spanned by the fast and slow polarisation directions, f and s (which correspond to two of
the eigenvectors of the polarisation matrix defined as Vil Ci jkln jnk). Second, a "de-phasing"
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 41
operator, which time shifts the two components by  t/2, is applied. Finally, the de-phased
components are projected back into the original coordinate system. This representation assumes
that the splitting results from a single, horizontally oriented anisotropic layer. Collectively, this
sequence of transformations can be expressed as
 = ()( t)(), (2.24)
where  and  are the rotation and de-phasing operators, respectively. Consequently, in this,
perhaps simplistic, model scenario it is possible to identify the two anisotropic splitting parameters
by seeking the inverse operator, 1, that minimises the difference between the resultant waveform
(or some characteristic thereof) and the expected initial waveform.
A number of techniques for identifying these two parameterswhich encapsulate the orientation
and degree of anisotropy in the Earthfrom observations of shear-wave splitting have been
developed. These techniques can be broadly categorised as: multi-channel techniques, which
analyse a set of records coming from different azimuths concurrently (Chevrot, 2000; Vinnik et al.,
1989); and single channel techniques, which determine the splitting parameters on a per-event basis
(Bowman and Ando, 1987; Menke and Levin, 2003; Silver and Chan, 1988, 1991). It is the latter
group that has been used most over the past 30 years, in part due to their simplicity. At their core,
these methods entail a grid search over  and  t, seeking the pair that best removes the effect of
splitting i.e. the inverse of  in Equation 2.24. The key difference between the various published
methods is simply the metric by which the "best pair" is identified. In this dissertation, I have
made use of a number of these different techniques, because they all have different advantages
in different settings. Below I briefly cover the underlying principles for each of the published
techniques, followed by a discussion of some of the caveats that must also be considered when
interpreting shear-wave splitting results.
Cross-correlation rotation
Bowman and Ando (1987) postulated that the waveforms of the two quasi-S phases are identical
and sought the maximum cross-correlation between between the two horizontal components for a
range of coordinate system rotations. The delay time is determined from the measured phase lag
between the two peaks. I have not used this method in my work, so will not discuss it further, but it
can be useful as an additional confirmation of the ( ,  t) identified by other means.
Minimum transverse component energy
First proposed by Silver and Chan (1988), this metric relies on a priori knowledge of the polarisation
of the S wave before it is split. The energy of a linearly polarised wave is limited to the plane of
polarisation, with no energy in the transverse plane. Thus any observed energy on the transverse
42 Theory and Methods

(green) axes of anisotropy.
component after rotation into the ray frame generally reflects some degree of anisotropy (or
heterogeneity) along the path. The initial polarisation of the family of core-refracted and -reflected
phases (e.g. SKS, SKKS, PKS) is determined by the source-receiver geometrye.g. for the
core-refracted phases, the core-traversing P phase is converted to an S phase polarised in the radial
plane at the core-mantle boundary. This makes them particularly useful for studying anisotropy
between the core-mantle boundary and the surface.
Linearisation of particle motion
Silver and Chan (1991) follow on from their earlier work with an additional metric by which to
determine the optimal ( ,  t) pair, as well as a technique for examining the uncertainties associated
with these measurements of shear-wave splitting parameters. They demonstrate that the inverse
operator 1 can be found by computing the two dimensional time-domain covariance matrix of
particle motion in the horizontal plane, as its eigenvalues may then be used as a measure of linearity
(Vidale, 1986). The covariance between any two orthogonal components is defined as
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 43
ci j ( , t) =
ui(t)u j(t  t)dt, (2.25)
for time lag  t. In the absence of anisotropy, this matrix is singular. In the presence of anisotropy,
however, it will possess two non-zero eigenvalues (unless  is aligned with one of either the fast
or slow axis of anisotropy or  t is zero). Thus, the best-fitting ( ,  t) pair is that for which the
corresponding covariance matrix for the corrected components is singular (or most nearly singular,
given the presence of noise). The various eigenvalue-based methods for assessing the linearity are
all equivalent, which allows for a number of other methods to be interpreted in the context of this
covariance matrix technique (for further details, see Silver and Chan, 1991). Essentially, the method
boils down to the minimisation of the second eigenvalue, 2, of the covariance matrix. Unlike
previous methods, this particular technique is independent of the initial polarisation, which makes
it a powerful and robust tool for the analysis of shear-wave splitting in local and regional direct
body phases, for which the initial polarisation may not be known. I have made extensive use of this
technique, which has been written into a number of software packages that greatly facilitate the
rapid analysis of shear-wave splitting (e.g. Savage et al., 2010; Teanby et al., 2004). The collection
of programs that form SPLIT (Teanby et al., 2004) are used to perform the shear-wave splitting anal-
ysis, which greatly facilitates the automatic analysis of SWS by trialling multiple different windows
around the shear phase arrival. Cluster analysis is then used to assess whether a stable result is found
across all trialled windows. The MFAST programs (Savage et al., 2010) develop this further by
trialling a number of different waveform filters in order to maximally boost the signal-to-noise ratio.
Silver and Chan (1991) also elicit a means of calculating uncertainties associated with the measure-
ment of shear-wave splitting parameters in terms of the error surfaces on the grid search over  and
 t. Walsh et al. (2013) subsequently identified a minor correction to the equations laid out in the
appendix of Silver and Chan (1991). Put simply, assuming the minimum of the grid-search surface
(e.g. Et( , t) or 2( , t)) is a 2 variable with n degrees of freedom, the uncertainties can be
estimated from the confidence region around the best-fitting ( , t) pair at the 95% confidence
level. Mathematically, this is represented as
fk,nk(1), (2.26)
where f is the inverse of the F probability distribution, k is the number of parameters (2), and
 = 0.05 represents the confidence level.
Error surface stacking
Outwith stable continental interiors (where ambient noise levels are relatively low), it can often be
difficult to record a sufficient number of XKS phase arrivals with good signal-to-noise ratios to
produce a reliable picture of the anisotropy beneath stations deployed in such regions. The ocean
44 Theory and Methods
produces two classes of microseism (the primary and secondary microseisms) that are dominant
in the period band of around 4 to 30 seconds and can strongly degrade the quality of XKS phase
arrivals. To counter this, a number of stacking methods have been developed (e.g. Vinnik et al.,
1989). In this work, I have used the multi-channel method laid out in Wolfe and Silver (1998),
which is summarised below.
For a suite of records, the grid-search surface is calculated using either the second eigenvalue of
the covariance or transverse energy minimisation techniques described earlier. In order to give
relatively equal weighting to all measurements in the set, each error surface is normalised by its
minimum value, which reflects the base level of noise in the seismogram. They are subsequently
additively stacked and the best-fitting ( ,  t) pair are estimated using the minimum of the stacked
surface and the associated uncertainties are calculated per the method laid out in Silver and Chan
(1991), adjusted to account for the increased number of degrees of freedom.
Splitting intensity
An independent method of measuring shear-wave splitting parameters from a suite of waveform
records was developed in Chevrot (2000), starting from the equations for the radial and transverse
components for a split shear arrival, described in Silver and Chan (1991)
R(t) = w(t + t/2)cos2  +w(t  t/2)sin2  , (2.27)
T (t) =
[w(t + t/2)w(t  t/2)]sin2 , (2.28)
where w(t) is the incoming wavelet and  is the angle between the fast velocity axis and the radial
axis. For  t  the dominant period of the signal, these equations simplify to
R(t) w(t), (2.29)
T (t)
( t sin2 )w(t), (2.30)
where w(t) is the time derivate of w(t). Therefore the transverse component is simply the time
derivative of the radial component multiplied by a sinusoidal factor whose amplitude depends on
 t and whose phase depends on the fast axis orientation. In other words, the M N matrix T,
generated from the transverse components of M records with N data points, can be expressed as
the tensor product of the splitting vector, swhich is related to the amplitude variations of the
transverse components with azimuthwith the derivatives of the radial components, r
T = as r, (2.31)
2.5 Seismic anisotropy 45
where a =0.5 is a constant. Thus the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix T
provides a natural and simple means of extracting the splitting parameters.
The splitting vector is defined as
s =2
, (2.32)
where r2 = rtr is the squared norm of r. After normalisation, the resulting splitting vector for a
horizontal anisotropic layer should have the form  t sin[2( 0)] with  t the delay time and 0
the azimuth of the fast axis. The azimuthal dependence of the splitting intensity is known as the
splitting function.
Unlike the method described in Section 2.5.2, the splitting intensity method implicitly incorporates
azimuthal information. Indeed, it is somewhat dependent on a good azimuthal distribution of
sources in order to produce a well-constrained SVD fit. It is thus possible to determine whether the
underlying anisotropy is dipping, which leads to a relative change in the amplitudes of the two peaks
in the sin2 sinusoid. Overall, this method provides a good complement to the single-channel
techniques, as well as the error surface stacking technique, as it is an independent measure of the
splitting parameters.
Shear-wave window
The identification of shear-wave splitting is not without complications. In fact, the interaction
of the incident wave with the free surface can lead to non-rectilinear particle motions, similar
to those resulting from a split shear wave. Nuttli (1961) showed that the particle motion of a
linearly-polarised plane shear wave incident at a free surface would no longer appear linear if the
angle of incidence exceeded some critical angle, ic, given by
ic = sin
1(VS/VP), (2.33)
where VP and VS are the P- and S-wave velocities, respectively. However, in the case of local
earthquakes, the wavefronts are typically curved when they reach the free surface. Booth and
Crampin (1985) tabulated the hodograms (particle motion diagrams) of synthetic seismograms at a
range of incident angles. They found that the particle motions became non-rectilinear for incidence
angles a few degrees beyond the critical angle. In local shear-wave splitting studies in volcanic
environments, a critical angle of 50 is commonly used (Nowacki et al., 2018), as the shallow
crust is often characterised by very low seismic velocities (Lesage et al., 2018), which bring rays
sharply towards the vertical.
46 Theory and Methods
Null measurements
A null measurementan observation for which there is no evidence of shear-wave splitting
indicates either that the wave has propagated through an isotropic medium, or that the initial
polarisation was coincident with the fast or slow axis (Savage, 1999). The former scenario can
often be neglected if there is evidence of shear-wave splitting in other observations. The latter,
hereafter referred to as geometric null measurements, provide no constraint of the strength of
anisotropy (as inferred from  t), but can be useful for assessing the orientation of anisotropy,
though with a 90 ambiguity. In the case of core-refracted phases, wherein the initial polarisation
corresponds to the backazimuth, a truly isotropic medium is characterised by null observations
distributed uniformly with backazimuth. It is also difficult to distinguish between a true null
and weak splitting, which may arise as a result of a weakly anisotropic medium or some more
complicated, layered scenario (Saltzer et al., 2000). Consequently, the identification of nulls is
often a subjective task for the seismologist, based on a number of criteria such as the ellipticity of
particle motion before correction and linearity of particle motion after correction.
2.5.3 Directional statistics
The measurements of the fast polarisation axis,  , from shear-wave splitting analysis are a form
of directional data. Due to the modular nature of such data (whereby 0 and 360 are identical),
standard methods of calculating statistical measures (such as the arithmetic mean) are ill-suited
for determining the ensemble behaviour of a sample7. Instead, one must use specific statistical
measures that account for the directional nature of the data. More specifically,  is a form of
orientation datait is periodic over 180, rather than 360. However, one can use the same
statistical tools to obtain the circular mean and standard deviation by transforming the orientation
data into directional by simply doubling the input angles. The final statistical measures then must
be halved to recover the orientation mean or standard deviation.
To calculate the mean orientation from a sample of  data, one first rexpresses each observation,
i, as the Cartesian coordinates of the unit vector that makes an angle  to the x-axis
Xi = cosi, (2.34)
Yi = sini. (2.35)
7Consider the extreme case consisting of the two observations1 and 359. The arithmetic mean of these two
observations is 180, though it is clear that the true mean is in fact 0/360.
2.6 Stress modelling 47
The Cartesian coordinates representing the resultant vector, R, are computed by summing the sines
and cosines of each observation
XR = 
ncosi, (2.36)
YR = 
nsini, (2.37)
where n is the number of observations. Hence, the angle made by this resultant vector with the
x-axis gives us the mean direction of the observations
 = arctan
. (2.38)
The normalised magnitude of the resultant vector, R, is a measure of the dispersion of the data.
For an entirely random sample of orientation data, one would expect R to be 0. Conversely, for
perfectly consistent data, one expects R to be 1. This behaviour is inversely related to the variance
of the data, leading to a common expression of the variance to be the complement of R
s20 = 1 R. (2.39)
The circular standard deviation follows as
scircular =
2ln(R). (2.40)
2.6 Stress modelling
In order to explore the relationship between seismic anisotropy and stress, it is necessary to have
some way of ascertaining the expected stress state of the crust. The open-source Coulomb 3.3
software package (Toda et al., 2011) provides a spatial framework within which to perform such
stress modelling in an homogeneous elastic half-space (given some fixed Youngs modulus). The
package is primarily designed (as the name suggests) for the calculation of the Coulomb Failure
Stress, which can be used to determine whether the stress field induced by, for example, movement
on a fault will cause a subsidiary fault to fail. It also provides a means of resolving the stress
and strain fields induced by magmatic processessuch as opening induced by dyke intrusions or
inflation/deflation of magma storage systemsthrough the analytical equations of Okada (1992).
Factors such as dynamic stresses, pore-fluid diffusion, visco-elastic rebound, and anisotropic elastic
parameters are not taken into account, but it is sufficient for the exploration of the first-order stress
field arising due to regional processes (e.g. plate spreading) and more transient events, such as the
2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dyke intrusion (Sigmundsson et al., 2014).
48 Theory and Methods
Coulomb 3.3 uses a suite of analytical equations to solve for the displacement field (and hence
strain field) induced by the input deformation model at each node in a uniform 2-D grid at some
depth within the elastic half-space. Given an elastic stiffness (or Youngs modulus), the stress tensor
at each node in the grid can then be derived from the calculated strain field, from which one can
extract the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress using the method of Lund and Townend
(2007). This maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) plays an important role in the generation of
seismic anisotropy, both directly and indirectly. In the case of stress-induced closure of microcracks
within the crust (i.e. Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy, EDA; Crampin, 1987; Crampin et al., 1984),
the orientation of SHmax determines which microcracks are closed, and which are left preferentially
open. The stress field can also indirectly impact structures that form seismic anisotropy through the
generation of larger scale fractures within the crust (e.g. the damage zone around faults), or even,
as recent work supports, having an indirect effect on how dyke intrusions propagate through the
crust (Woods et al., 2019).
In order to generate these models, however, one does require an input deformation model. These
are often, by necessity, simplified representations of the underlying physical process of interest
and fail to capture the full complexity of the setting. For example, Coulomb 3.3 is not capable
of incorporating the displacement field induced by gravitational loading of the crust from bodies
such as Vatnajkull (the main glacial cap of Iceland). Consequently, the resulting stress model
will fail to capture the full picture, possibly impacting our ability to interpret measurements of
seismic anisotropy in the context of the stress field. Indeed, even those deformation models
that are derived from observational data (e.g. displacements measured by GPS stations)hence
necessarily incorporating all factors present implicitlyare limited by the fact that one must specify
the potential sources of displacement in order to evaluate their relative contributions. Given the
assumptions required to invert, for example, GPS displacement observations for strain are similar
to those used by Coulomb to calculate the analytical strain field, I propose it would be more valid
in future to bypass this stage and simply derive the strain field directly from the GPS observations.
It may even be possible to go a step further and also incorporate additional streams of data, such
as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images, which are capable of capturing
ground deformation on a much finer spatial scale than sparse networks of GPS antennas. With this
workflow, one would in a sense then be comparing data with data, allow for robust calculation of
the statistical significance between the trends observed in SHmax and observations of shear-wave
splitting. As it stands, the absolute values for the orientation of the SHmax vectors derived from
Coulomb 3.3 are more a reflection of the orientation of the features in the input deformation model
than they are of the true field. Some initial exploration of this problem has indicated that it may be
possible to reproduce the same observed rotation in the fast axis of seismic anisotropy seen when
moving from south-to-north in the region around Askja volcano (as shown in Chapter 4).

Introduction to Iceland
3.1 Geological setting, tectonics, and seismicity of Iceland
Iceland is situated in the North Atlantic, lying at the confluence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridgethe di-
vergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian platesand the Iceland plume (White
and McKenzie, 1995). The island, and the accompanying 2000 km wide topographic swell, are the
product of long-lived hotspot volcanism in the North Atlantic which initiated concurrently with the
opening of the North Atlantic Ocean (White and McKenzie, 1989), with erupted products along the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge showing a broad geochemical anomaly over the same scale (Schilling, 1973;
Shorttle and Maclennan, 2011). The elevated volumes of melt produced as a result of the combined
presence of the mid-ocean ridge and Iceland plume (Maclennan et al., 2001) has allowed Iceland to
steadily grow over the last 20 Ma, resulting in anomalously thickened oceanic-type crust (up to
around 40 km, e.g. Allen, 2002; Darbyshire et al., 2000) and subaerial exposure of the spreading
ridge. Unlike typical spreading centresparticularly relatively fast-spreading ridgesrifting across
Iceland is accommodated across a broad (tens of kilometres), complex network of en-chelon axial
rift zones and transform faults (Figure 3.1). The neo-volcanic zones (shown as the red shaded band
in Figure 3.1) are broadly divided into three significant segments: the Western, Eastern, and North-
ern Volcanic Zones (WVZ, EVZ, and NVZ, respectively). The Northern and Eastern zones have
been offset by over 100 km from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by a series of eastward ridge jumps around
88.5 Ma (Garcia et al., 2003). The South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) and Tjrnes Fracture Zone
(TFZ) link the WVZ with the EVZ, and the NVZ to the Kolbeinsey Ridge (the continuation of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge into the Arctic Ocean), respectively. It is likely that these ridge jumps enabled
the rifting to remain over the plume head (Smundsson, 1974). Within each of these volcanic
zones, plate spreading is accommodated in smaller rift systems that typically comprise a central
volcano and an elongated fissure swarm (Einarsson, 1991), which are distinguished and formally
classified based on the extent of surface fracturing, faults, and geochemistry of the erupted products.
52 Introduction to Iceland
The NVZ is subdivided into five distinct, mature volcanic systems, namely (from south to north):
Kverkfjll, Askja, Fremrinmur, Krafla, and eistareykir (all labelled in Figure 3.1). It is within
these volcanic rift zones that plate spreading is accommodated through faulting and episodic
accretion of new crust in volcanic intrusions and eruptions (e.g. Sigmundsson et al., 2014). Each
distinct volcanic system is defined by a surface fissure swarm and an associated central volcano
(Einarsson, 2008). These fissure swarmswhich are typically about 15 km wide and 40100
km longare characterised by a high density of normal faulting, surface fractures, and fissures.
Volcanic products erupted or emplaced within the fissure swarm are geochemically associated with
the systems central volcano, and are often compositionally distinct from neighbouring volcanic
systems. From this, it can be inferred that the magma that feeds these systems is supplied into the
crust in discrete regions. Some of the central volcanoes exhibit developed calderas, marking loci of
repeated melt storage and differentiation within the crust. Deep and persistent seismicity around
Askja volcano suggests that magma is being supplied to this region in multiple locations, not only
beneath the central volcano but also at other points along the fissure swarm (Greenfield, 2015; Key
et al., 2011; Soosalu et al., 2010). This is in contrast to other areas of Iceland, where observations
of deep seismicity are more limited to conduits beneath central volcanoes (e.g. Hudson et al., 2017;
Schuler et al., 2015; Tarasewicz et al., 2012; Winder, 2021).
Accretion and extension of the nascent, brittle upper crust within these rift systems is highly
episodic. The crust below around 8 km is ductile (e.g. Drouin et al., 2017), accommodating exten-
sional plate spreading stresses through continuous creep. In contrast, the shallow crust is brittle
and thus cannot flowinstead, elastic strain accumulates gradually over long periods of extension
before being dramatically relieved during short periods of intensive dyking and extensional faulting,
known as a rifting episode. Between such episodes, the spreading centres are largely amagmatic
and aseismic in the upper crust (Einarsson and Brandsdttir, 2021). Seismic activity that does
occur is often limited to the regions around central volcanoes, where the majority of earthquakes
are the result of hydrothermal processes, or individual eruptive episodes. Such volcano-tectonic
earthquakes have been attributed to the movement of melt within the crust, though the observed high
frequency content is indicative of brittle failure of the rock. For the most part, the fissure swarms
associated with each central volcano, however, are markedly seismically quiet. The southern end
of the Northern Volcanic Zone stands out in that intense seismicitywhich has been ongoing since
records began in 1974 (Einarsson, 1991)is observed between the fissure swarms of the Askja and
the Kverkfjll volcanic systems. This seismicity has been explored in detail (e.g. Green et al., 2014;
Greenfield, 2015; Soosalu et al., 2010), most recently in Winder (2021), wherein it is suggested that
the anomalous levels of seismic activity may be a result of the combined effects of fluids migrating
from depth, groundwater flow away from the hydrothermally active regions around Askja, and,
consequently, the deposition of unusually high concentrations of clays, weakening the faults.

lines) comes on land it is separated into a branched system of volcanic zones, shown by the red
region in the bottom panel. These zones, sometimes also referred to as neo-volcanic zones or rift
zones, are subdivided into the Northern, Eastern, and Western Volcanic Zones (NVZ, EVZ, and
WVZ, respectively). These EVZ and NVZ are connected to the WVZ and Kolbeinsey Ridge by
the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) and Tjrnes Fracture Zone (TFZ), respectively. Central
volcanoes within the NVZ are annotated (see main text).
54 Introduction to Iceland
3.1.1 Icelandic-type crust
The thickness of the Icelandic crust has been the subject of debate since the first seismic measure-
ments were made in the 1960s (e.g. Bth, 1960; Tryggvason, 1962). While the imaged crustal
structure has been broadly similar between studies, the debate has been split into whether the
Icelandic crust is "thin" (20 km) and underlain by mantle with unusually low velocities, or
"thick" (40 km), with the lower 20 km being anomalously high velocity crustal material. Recent
works have tended to support the thick crust model, including a high-resolution receiver function
imaging study (Jenkins et al., 2018). The thickness of the crust varies across Iceland, with the
thickest crust around the north-west corner of Vatnajkull, coincident with the proposed head of the
Iceland mantle plume. As crustal thickness is the end product of mantle melting, the evidence of
anomalously thick crust supports a model of increased melt fractions from passive decompression
melting at elevated mantle temperatures. Thermal models for this (White and McKenzie, 1989)
demonstrate that an increase in mantle potential temperature of 50100C would produce the 2030
km thick crust seen across most of Iceland. With so much additional melt supply it is likely that the
crust-mantle transition is gradational with layers of melt and mantle cumulates, and that there is an
extensive lower crustal plumbing system feeding the spreading centres. However, the thickness of
the crust is not uniform along the spreading centre, with crustal thicknesses of 20 km around the
Krafla and eistareykir volcanic systems in the north (Jenkins et al., 2018). Figure 3.2 shows a
comparison between the lithological models for Icelandic-type and typical oceanic crust.
3.2 Seismic anisotropy in Iceland
Anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath Iceland has been previously investigated using data from
the ICEMELT and HOTSPOT experimentstwo studies looking at shear-wave splitting of tele-
seismic core-refracted waves sought to constrain the impact of the interaction of the spreading
ridge and the mantle plume on seismic anisotropy, which can inform on the dynamic state of the
mantle (Bjarnason et al., 2002; Xue and Allen, 2005). While the observations did show some
coherency between stations in certain regions, they were inconclusive in deciphering the state of
flow in the upper mantle, in part due to the station spacing (70 km) only sparsely sampling the
mantle beneath Iceland. These studies were supplemented by an analysis of radial anisotropy from
two-plane wave tomography (Li and Detrick, 2003), which suggested that the proximity of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge does indeed strongly influence the pattern of mantle flow associated with the
Iceland plume. No anisotropy that might be associated with radial flow away from the plume centre
in Iceland is observedif radial flow exists, it must be very weak, or in a small area close to the
plume stem, or at depths greater than 100 km (the depth resolution limit of the study). Surface
wave anisotropy has also been observed in the mid-lower crust (Bjarnason and Schmeling, 2009),
with suggested mechanisms that include sills, dykes, and LPO, but insufficient azimuthal coverage
has prevented a definitive interpretation. This has been subsequently revisited through the analysis

56 Introduction to Iceland
of azimuthal anisotropy in phase velocities derived from ambient noise analyses, from which it is
concluded that the observed seismic anisotropy is a result of LPO induced by flow in the lower
crust (Volk et al., 2021).
Prior to the studies presented in the proceeding chapters, local shear-wave splitting has been used
to characterise seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust in south-west Iceland (Menke et al., 1994),
where the observed splitting is attributed to fractures and cracks in the shallow crust, constrained
by surface observations and focal mechanisms across the South Iceland seismic zone. Temporal
variations in shear-wave splitting observations have also been linked with changes in the stress
state in the crust leading up to earthquakes and eruptions in Iceland (Volti and Crampin, 2003a,b).
While it is clear that large earthquakes and eruptions can alter and redistribute stress in the crust, it
is a far more difficult task to decode such variations ahead of time and cannot be solely relied on as
a forecasting tool. Shear-wave splitting as a proxy for the stress state of the crust does promise
to be a useful tool in the monitoring of volcanoes, but has as yet not been fully realised. This is
primarily because in order to understand temporal variations in splitting, one must first have a good,
and well understood, baseline against which to make robust comparisons. Even with this, the stress
state of the crust is a complex function with many variables, including (but not limited to) plate
spreading rates, mass loading (either by icecaps, glaciers, sharp changes in elevation, and even
seasonal changes such as snow cover and meltwater), and the storage and movement of magma
throughout the crust (Donaldson et al., 2019; Drouin et al., 2017; Sigmundsson et al., 2014).
Chapter 4
Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of
the Northern Volcanic Zone
In this chapter I present the results of a study of seismic anisotropy in the shallow, nascent crust of
the Northern Volcanic Zone, Iceland. Specifically, I use observations of shear-wave splitting from
local earthquake sources to analyse the variations in the geometry and strength of anisotropy both
laterally and as a function of depth. This work is currently in revision following the first round of
reviews in Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, from which much of the text has been
adapted. I have benefitted from, and am deeply grateful for, the work of Tim Greenfield and Tom
Winder, who created the earthquake catalogue that was used as the basis of this study.
4.1 Introduction
Iceland lies in the North Atlantic, at the confluence of the divergent plate boundary between the
Eurasian and North American plates (delineated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and the Iceland plume
(White and McKenzie, 1995). The island, and the accompanying 2000 km wide topographic swell,
are the product of long-lived hotspot volcanism in the North Atlantic which initiated concurrently
with the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean (White and McKenzie, 1989), with erupted products
along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge showing a broad geochemical anomaly over the same scale (Schilling,
1973; Shorttle and Maclennan, 2011). The elevated volumes of melt produced as a result of the
combined presence of the mid-ocean ridge and Iceland plume (Maclennan et al., 2001) has led to
the formation and development of Iceland over the last 20 Myr, resulting in anomalously thickened
oceanic-type crustup to around 40 km (e.g. Allen, 2002; Darbyshire et al., 2000)and subaerial
exposure of the spreading ridge. Rifting across Iceland is accommodated across a broad (tens of
kilometres), complex network of en-chelon axial rift zones and transform faults (Figure 4.1). The
neo-volcanic zones are broadly divided into three significant segments: the Western, Eastern, and
Northern Volcanic Zones (WVZ, EVZ, and NVZ, respectively). Within each of these volcanic
58 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
zones, plate spreading is accommodated in smaller rift systems that typically each comprise a
central volcano and an elongated fissure swarm (Einarsson, 1991). They are distinguished and
formally classified based on the extent of surface fracturing, faults, and geochemistry of the erupted
products. The NVZ is subdivided into five distinct, mature volcanic systems, namely: Kverkfjll,
Askja, Fremrinmur, Krafla, and eistareykir. It is within these volcanic rift zones that plate spread-
ing is accommodated through faulting and episodic accretion of new crust in volcanic intrusions
and eruptions (e.g. gstsdttir et al., 2019; Sigmundsson et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2019).
Askja is a large, active central volcano located at the southern end of the NVZ (see Figure 4.1).
A complex, nested sequence of at least three calderaspanning 20 kmconstitutes the main
volcanic edifice, which is composed primarily of hyaloclastite and pillow lavas erupted during the
last glacial maximum (Sigvaldason et al., 1992). The last eruption of Askja was in 1961, when a 2
km-long fissure opened up, with lava breaching the eastern side of the main caldera wall. Surface
mapping around Askja has revealed a complex pattern of both caldera-concentric and rift-parallel
features, including faults and surface fractures, which deviate in orientation from those observed
elsewhere in the associated rift zone (Graettinger et al., 2019; Hjartardttir et al., 2016).
Deformation around Askja has been monitored since 1961, at first with a tilt line within the caldera
(Sturkell et al., 2006; Tryggvason, 1989), but more recently using satellite-based GPS and InSAR
measurements (de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2012; Pagli et al., 2006; Sturkell et al., 2006). The
long-term trend since 1961 is one of deflation, albeit at a decaying rate1. Forward modelling based
on geodetic observations suggest a shallow (3.5 km depth) Mogi-type source beneath the Askja
caldera can explain the observed deflation, though most studies have assumed an isotropic, elastic
half-space, which may be inappropriate around Askja (Drouin et al., 2017; Heimisson and Segall,
2020). For instance, rheological models based on a visco-elastic ridge appear to be key in the
interpretation of geodetic data (Pedersen et al., 2009). Nonetheless, the derivation of such models
from geodetic data provides insight into the contemporary stress state of the crust, wherein strain is
gradually accumulated between rifting episodes. This complements the available seismic dataset.
Large systems of fissures and faults are widespread across the rift segments associated with Askja
and another central volcano, Kverkfjll, situated to the south-east (see Figure 4.1). Broadly speak-
ing, the fissure swarms associated with each central volcano are markedly seismically quiet in
between rifting episodes. This part of the NVZ, however, stands out in that intense seismicity
which has been ongoing since records began in 1974 (Einarsson, 1991)is observed between the
fissure swarms of the Askja and the Kverkfjll volcanic systems, extending north-east towards
Herubrei (a tuya formed during the last glacial periodFigure 4.1b). This seismicity has been
explored in detail (e.g. Green et al., 2014; Greenfield et al., 2020; Soosalu et al., 2010), most

60 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
recently by Winder (2021), who suggests that the anomalous levels of seismic activity may be a
result of the combined effects of fluids migrating from depth, groundwater flow away from the
hydrothermally active regions around Askja, and, consequently, the deposition of unusually high
concentrations of clays, weakening the faults. These faults form a network of conjugate strike-slip
faults that are bisected by the strike of the rift, suggesting some relation to plate spreading as well
as a degree of interplay between the faults and pre-existing structures that are controlled by the
stress field (Green et al., 2014; Winder, 2021). This seismicity tends to occur in swarms (where
the earthquakes are clustered in both space and time), located primarily above the well-mapped
brittle-ductile transition at around 68 km depth (Soosalu et al., 2010). There is also significant
seismic activity in the skjuvatn caldera, which lies within Askja, associated with the migration of
geothermally heated fluids, as well as a number of deep clusters of earthquakes thought to be associ-
ated with the migration of melt within the trans-crustal melt storage system (Greenfield et al., 2020).
Seismic anisotropy, the directional dependence of seismic wave-speed, has been observed in the
crust across a range of environments (Boness and Zoback, 2006; Illsley-Kemp et al., 2018; Johnson
et al., 2011). The nature of anisotropy can be broadly classified as either effective (i.e. a long-
wavelength, bulk property of an otherwise heterogeneous medium) or intrinsic, arising from the
anisotropic elastic structure at the crystal lattice level. The lattercommonly known as Lattice
Preferred Orientation (LPO)is often invoked to explain observations of anisotropy in the upper
mantle, which is dominantly composed of the anisotropic minerals olivine and orthopyroxene.
When deformed under strain, these minerals preferentially align, giving rise to anisotropy on a
macroscopic scale. It has also been proposed as a mechanism to explain observations of Love and
Rayleigh wave anisotropy in the lower crust of Iceland from ambient noise analysis (Volk et al.,
2021). Effective anisotropy, however, is typically invoked as the primary mechanism by which
seismic anisotropy is generated in the shallow, brittle crust. Here, mechanisms are typically related
to either stress, through preferential closure of micro-cracks (or Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy,
EDA; Crampin, 1994), oriented melt pockets (OMP; Bastow et al., 2010; Holtzman et al., 2003;
Keir et al., 2005), structure, such as repeating isotropic layers (Backus, 1962) or structurally
controlled anisotropy, related to damage zones around faults (Boness and Zoback, 2006). I seek
here to determine the mechanisms responsible for generating seismic anisotropy in the crust around
Askja in order to understand better the present-day state and anisotropic structure of nascent crust
formed at a mid-ocean ridge, as well as how large-scale stress fields (e.g. due to plate spreading)
can be disrupted by local perturbations, such as the inflation or deflation of shallow magma storage
systems or magmatic intrusions. Spatially mapping the seismic anisotropy in the crust around
Askja, and other volcanoes, provides important context in which to study how the crust in volcanic
environments responds to such transient perturbations to the local stress field, whichif well
understoodmay lead to real-time insights into the state of active volcanic systems (Johnson et al.,
2011).
4.2 Data and Methods 61
Shear-wave splitting is one of the most unambiguous indicators of seismic anisotropy. When
a linearly polarised shear wave impinges on an anisotropic medium, it is partitioned into two
quasi-S waves, which propagate with different wavespeeds. The polarisations of these two waves,
commonly referred to as the fast (hereafter denoted  ) and slow axes, are controlled by the
symmetry and orientation of the anisotropic elastic tensor. A time lag,  t, accrues between the
polarised waves as they propagate through the region, with the final integrated value proportional
to both the path length and the strength of anisotropy. Significant work has been done to establish
methods that can distinguish between structural and stress-induced anisotropy (Boness and Zoback,
2006; Johnson et al., 2011). Being able to distinguish these causes is critical for the potential
application of time-series analysis to shear-wave splitting observations as a means of monitoring
the evolution of the stress field in volcanic environments in response to seasonal signals, long-term
temporal signals (such as deflation and inflation), and stress transients resulting from volcanic
processes such as caldera collapse and dyke intrusions (e.g. Johnson and Poland, 2013).
Here, I perform local earthquake shear-wave splitting analysis in the neighbourhood of Askja
volcano, in order to relate observed anisotropy to the underlying processes responsible for the
accretion of new crust at a mid-ocean ridge and the development of associated volcanic systems.
The results provide a new perspective on a region that is already well studied using complementary
geophysical methods (de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2012; Drouin et al., 2017; Greenfield et al.,
2016, 2020; Sturkell et al., 2006).
4.2 Data and Methods
4.2.1 Data
I use continuous seismic data recorded by a network of 3-component seismometers operated by
the University of Cambridge since 2008, with additional data from one instrument operated by the
Icelandic Meteorological Office (MKO, denoted by the purple square in Figure 4.1). Over time,
the network has consisted of between 30 and 70 broadband instruments, primarily Gralp 6TDs
(30 s corner frequency). All data used in this study were recorded using Gralp 6TDs. For the
shear-wave splitting analysis, I use the earthquake catalogue of Greenfield et al. (2020) which spans
20092015, updated (using the same methodology outlined in their paper) to include data recorded
between 2015 and 2018 (Winder et al., 2018). These earthquakes were detected and located using
the automatic Coalescence Microseismic Mapping algorithm (CMM: Drew et al., 2013). The
details of pre-processing applied to the data to generate this catalogue are available in Greenfield
et al. (2020). The CMM algorithm produces automatic arrival time picks for P- and S-phases
that were used, along with some manually picked phase arrivals, to relocate the events using the
probabilistic, non-linear earthquake location method implemented in NonLinLoc (Lomax et al.,
62 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
2000). The final catalogue consists of 58,143 individual earthquakes spanning a local magnitude
range of -0.64.0, with a magnitude of completeness of approximately 1.
The majority of earthquakes (52,141, or 89.7%) occur in the brittle, upper 7 km of the crust,
generated primarily by a network of cross-cutting conjugate strike-slip faults oriented approximately
N-S and NE-SW, located to the northeast of Askja volcano and to the south of Herubrei. The
remaining shallow seismicity is related to geothermal processes at Askja volcano. The depths of
these shallow events are well-distributed throughout the brittle crust. The final 10.3% (6,002) of
events in the catalogue occur in pockets at depths between 7 and 25 km in the typically aseismic
lower, ductile crust. These are thought to be associated with magmatic processes (Greenfield et al.,
2020; Martens and White, 2013) and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. I limit my analyses
to splitting observed from earthquakes originating in the upper 10 km of crust in order to focus
specifically on anisotropy in the shallow crust. Finally, I exclude any events that occurred between
August 2014 and February 2015 in order to remove the possible effect of stress transients related to
the 201415 eruption of Brarbunga. Figure 4.1 illustrates the spatial distribution of earthquakes
and seismic stations between 2009 and 2018 that have been used in this study.
4.2.2 Shear-wave splitting
I measure the shear-wave splitting parameters ( , t) using the Multiple Filter Automatic Splitting
Technique package (MFAST version 2.2 Savage et al., 2010; Teanby et al., 2004), which uses the
eigenvalue minimisation algorithm of Silver and Chan (1991). Figure 4.2 illustrates the output from
MFAST for a good quality event. Unlike other methods, this does not require any knowledge of the
initial polarisation, which is often difficult to assess a priori in local earthquake datasets, though at
the cost of being more prone to cycle skipping. A grid search over  t and  is used to find the pair
of values that best remove the observed splitting, determined by measuring the linearity of particle
motion on the horizontal components within a window around the S-phase arrival. This is further
automated by trialling multiple windows around the S-phase arrival and applying cluster analysis
to the ensemble of results in order to identify stable solutions. This is a particularly effective means
of identifying cycle skipping. Errors for individual measurements are calculated by conducting an
F-test and finding the 95% confidence interval on the optimal ( , t) (Walsh et al., 2013). Each
measurement is automatically graded based on the distribution of clusters and the tightness of the
misfit contours from the grid search (Savage et al., 2010). MFAST also trials a suite of filters over
the S-phase pick in order to determine the filter that most effectively boosts the signal-to-noise
ratio. Table B.1 in Appendix B provides an overview of the final parameters used for MFAST.

64 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
I limit my analyses to the subset of measurements that satisfy the following criteria: a signal-to-
noise ratio (as defined in Savage et al., 2010) greater than 4; clusters graded ACl (a measure of
the number of clusters identified and how tight they are); errors in  < 10 in order to mitigate
erroneous observations resulting from cycle skipping; values of  t < 0.48s, equal to 0.8 times
the maximum delay time of the search; and errors in  t < 0.05s as an additional filter against
null measurements and poorly constrained results. A null measurement can occur when there
is no anisotropy in the plane of the shear wave particle motion, or when the source polarisation
of the shear wave is along the fast or slow orientation of the medium. Source polarisations are
determined from the corrected horizontal particle motion. Measurements of  within 20 of the
source polarisation are considered too ambiguous in that they cannot be definitively distinguished
from nulls, and are subsequently excluded from further analysis. After applying these criteria, I
am left with 69,119 measurements of shear-wave splitting. I further remove measurements for
which the angle-of-incidence of the shear wave at the surface falls outside the shear-wave window
(Nuttli, 1961). This window, defined by sin1(Vs/Vp), is the angle to the vertical at which there
will be non-negligible interactions with the free surface that would alter the phase and amplitude
information on the horizontal components (Crampin, 1984). A Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78 corresponds
to a shear-wave window of  34 from the vertical. However, volcanic environments typically
exhibit very low velocities in the topmost layers (Lesage et al., 2018), which will cause significant
deflection of the ray towards the vertical. Therefore, I limit my analysis to event-station pairs
with a straight-line angle-of-incidence at the surface of < 50 (Nowacki et al., 2018). Finally, all
remaining splitting measurements are visually inspected to filter out any poor results, with over 90%
of the measurements being retained; the primary cause of a poor result was either cycle skipping or
a poor initial S-phase pick. This leaves 9,974 high-quality measurements of shear-wave splitting.
4.2.3 Shear wave anisotropy
The delay time,  t, is an integrated measure of the strength of anisotropy along the raypath, making
it an unsuitable metric for direct comparison between different event-station pairs. This is overcome
by converting the observed delay times to shear wave anisotropy (SWA: Thomas and Kendall,
2002), which is a measure of the strength of anisotropy as defined by the fractional perturbation, a,
from the average shear wave speed, v,
 t = tslow  t f ast =
v 12av
v+ 12av
 a =
 tv

(4.1)
where tslow and t f ast are the slow and fast traveltimes, respectively. SWA is also a function of
both the path length, d, and the velocity structure along the ray, therefore representing a more
4.3 Results 65
appropriate metric to compare between individual observations. I assume straight-line raypaths and
use an optimal 1-D velocity model determined by inverting microseismic arrival times (Mitchell
et al., 2013). Nowacki et al. (2018) demonstrated that the errors introduced by the straight-line
raypath assumption are negligible for shallow events, for which the raypaths do not deviate far from
a straight line, with up to around 1% overestimation in SWA for the deepest events. Additionally,
they show that the uncertainty in SWA arising from inaccuracy in the velocity model is estimated
to be less than 1% from bootstrap modelling. The geological setting of Afar and the corresponding
seismic dataset are markedly similar to that of Iceland in a number of ways. While the erupted
products at Aluto, in Afar, are more silicic in composition, the velocity structures in both regions
exhibit low velocities in the shallow crust that cause rays to turn sharply towards the vertical.
Furthermore, the seismicity used in Aluto spans a similar depth range as the dataset presented here,
with the majority of events occurring above 10 km depth. Given these similarities, I think it likely
that this uncertainty analysis remains appropriate for the Iceland dataset.
4.3 Results
4.3.1 Regional averages
Delay times
From the entire catalogue of shear-wave splitting measurements, I recover an average delay time of
 t = 0.10  0.05 s. This value is consistent with similar datasets elsewhere, e.g. 0.2 s around
Soufrire Hills volcano, Montserrat (Baird et al., 2015); 0.10.2 s in the Western Volcanic Zone,
Iceland (Menke et al., 1994); and 0.11  0.06 s around Aluto volcano, Ethiopia (Nowacki et al.,
2018). I find the distribution of delay time observations to be sufficiently normal to justify the
extraction of a regional 1-D depth profile as the central tendency of the data via the application
of a rolling arithmetic mean (Figure 4.3). I use a 1.5 km rolling window, spaced every 0.75 km,
which is chosen to reflect the uncertainty in hypocentral depth for shallow events (Greenfield
et al., 2020). I observe a constant delay time at depths > 3 km. Between 3 km depth and the
surface, there is a suggestion that the delay time begins to trend towards 0, which is consistent
with a finite-thickness anisotropic layer in the very shallow crust, a common observation across
volcanic environments (Johnson et al., 2011; Menke et al., 1994; Nowacki et al., 2018). This
does not preclude structural control on anisotropy, but it is a key requirement for stress-induced
anisotropy due to the preferential closure of microcracks. In oceanic-type crust, most pore space
has been closed by lithostatic pressure at around 45 km below the surface (Christensen, 1984).
The relationship between crustal porosity and depth can be expressed as the exponential function
(e.g. Athy, 1930; Audet and McConnell, 1992)
(r) = 1exp
cP(r)
, (4.2)
66 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
where c is a constant ( 6.15), 1 is the surface porosity, P(r) is the lithostatic overburden pressure
(= (r)gd, where  is the density, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and d is the depth), and Pc
is the characteristic closing pressure of the material (Han et al., 2014). I perform a simple fit of a
similar exponential function to the depth profile, shown in Figure 4.3, which suggests that the 1-D
behaviour of the delay time is consistent with the presence of crustal cracks that gradually close
with increasing depth.
Fast axis orientation
I observe an average orientation of  =N014E 27 for the fast axis of anisotropy, though I
recommend caution in drawing too much from the exact value of, and the uncertainty on, this
measure as the circular statistics used are only appropriate if the observations are drawn from
a unimodal distribution. Small variations in fast polarizations across the region, such as those
expected in response to, for example, a rotation in the stress field, may be contributing to the
large spread in observed  values. The average orientation correlates well with the normal to the
plate-spreading direction, as shown in Figure 4.4, as well as the mapped surface structures which
likely reflect the long-term regional stress field (Hjartardttir and Einarsson, 2012; Hjartardttir
et al., 2016). This is consistent with observations made at other spreading centres, such as the
northern Main Ethiopian Rift (Keir et al., 2005). Exactly how the orientation of the fast axis of
anisotropy varies across the region is investigated further in Section 4.3.2.
4.3.2 Lateral variations in observed anisotropy
Shear wave anisotropy
Measurements of delay time are converted to SWA using Equation 4.1, as described in section 4.2.3.
I constrain the shallow anisotropic layer to be entirely above 3 km b.s.l. (i.e. a 4-km thick layer),
inferred from the constant delay time below this depth observed in the 1-D profile (Figure 4.3).
Assuming that the mechanism generating seismic anisotropy is aligned fractures in the shallow
crust, this value is consistent with measures of fracture density from other independent measures,
such as radial anisotropy constrained by surface waves extracted from ambient noise (Volk, 2021),
response of velocity changes, dv/v, to seasonal changes in load (Donaldson et al., 2019), and
general profiles of pore space as a function of depth in oceanic crust (e.g. Carlson and Herrick,
1990). While there is an element of bias in assigning the splitting observation to a single point in
space, I follow precedent and use the mid-point of the raypath (Figure 4.5) between the source and
receiver before re-gridding the data. For near-vertical raypaths, as is the case for the majority of
the dataset due to the shear-wave window constraint, this introduces negligible systematic error
in the pattern of lateral variations. The application of a symmetric 2-D Gaussian spatial filter to
the re-gridded observations further reduces the impact of this assumption on the observed lateral
patterns. Here, I present the results for a grid with 0.5 x 0.5 km2 cells and a minimum observation

of the lateral variation in anisotropy strength are robust to perturbations to both the grid parameters
and the smoothing radius. I trialled cell sizes varying from 0.25 x 0.25 km2  1 x 1 km2, minimum
number of observations per bin between 3 and 15, and a smoothing radius of 13 km, and found
that the results did not vary significantly. I acknowledge that the process of re-gridding the data in
this way means that some azimuthal information is lost, but I deem it acceptable for the purpose of
identifying trends in the strength of anisotropy across the rift segment. I measure an anisotropic
strength of 5%, with values ranging between 212 %, which spans the appropriate range expected
for mechanisms proposed for elastic anisotropy of the crust.

there is a higher density of observations. The minimum cell size used is on the same order as the
uncertainties in the epicentral locations for the earthquakes in the catalogue. Starting from a single
cell spanning the entire study region, this process recursively subdivides a cell into four sub-cells

vector is evaluated from which both the average orientation and the mean resultant length, R, is
determined. R is a measure of dispersion analogous to the variance (in the opposite sense)values
close to 0 imply near uniform dispersion, whereas values close to 1 suggest that the orientations
are tightly bunched around a particular orientation (e.g. Davis and Sampson, 1973). This allows
me to observe the lateral trends in the orientation of anisotropy, without constraining the source of
anisotropy to be in the vicinity of the source or the receiver.

72 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
4.4 Discussion
4.4.1 Anisotropy orientation and strength
My analysis of shear-wave splitting from earthquakes in the brittle, upper 10 km of crust around
Askja has constrained the primary source of anisotropy to be in the top 34 km of crust, with the
dominant orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy correlating strongly with the strike of the rift
(Figure 4.4). Together, these two observations provide compelling evidence for extensional stress
related to plate spreading as the underlying driver generating the observed seismic anisotropy. This
is consistent with other studies of local shear-wave splitting in similar environments, such as the
East African Rift (Illsley-Kemp et al., 2017, 2019; Keir et al., 2005; Nowacki et al., 2018). The
average delay times of shear-wave splitting observations ( t = 0.10  0.05 s) is also consistent
with these studies.
Although I attribute my observations of shear wave anisotropy to fractures or cracks in the shallow
crust, there are other causes of anisotropy that may be a factor. For instance, aligned melt pockets
could produce a signature of effective anisotropy with ridge-parallel orientation of the fast axis,
as has been suggested in the upper mantle and lower crust of the Main Ethiopian Rift (Hammond
et al., 2014; Kendall et al., 2005). However, there is no evidence for the presence of melt in large
volumes in the shallow crust beneath the NVZ, outside of the central volcanic systems, and ambient
noise studies that constrain azimuthal variations of radial anisotropy are not consistent with such a
mechanism (Volk, 2021). Furthermore, it is difficult to propose a physically coherent reason as
to why melt pockets would be focussed in the very shallow crust, yet be absent at greater depth,
which would need to be the case to explain the trend shown in Figure 4.3. Another possibility is
LPO associated with deformation, lava flows, or depositional processes. Recent measurements of
radial anisotropy from ambient seismic noise (Volk et al., 2021) support the presence of LPO in the
crust resulting from internal deformation or flow, but this appears to be largely restricted to depths
below about 15 km, and therefore is unlikely to influence the results. Lava flows can align minerals
such as plagioclase and clinopyroxene (Boiron et al., 2013), but this tends to occur at very short
scale lengths horizontally and in depth, and consequently are unlikely to substantially contribute to
the pattern of anisotropy over what is a relatively large study area.
When interpreting the map of SWA (Figure 4.6), I recommend that a greater importance be placed
on the relative values, as opposed to the absolute values, which can be tuned by varying the
thickness chosen for the anisotropic layer. I primarily see elevated values of SWA in regions with
elevated rates of seismicity, which is consistent with the idea that stress is the primary control on
the mechanism generating anisotropy. There is a region of elevated SWA to the south of Herubrei
(Figure 4.6), which corresponds with a region of elevated seismic activity on the network of
cross-cutting conjugate strike-slip faults, which have been extensively studied (Green et al., 2014;
4.4 Discussion 73
Winder, 2021). Consequently, we can infer that this section of crust is heavily fractured and highly
stressed, two conditions under which one would expect to see a higher anisotropic signal. This may,
however, also be an artefact of the assumption that the anisotropic layer has a uniform thickness
across the region. For example, elevated volumes of fluids within the crust may hold pore spaces
open at greater depths. There is indeed some suggestion from the distribution of seismicity that the
thickness of the brittle layer within the crust does exhibit some variability over the region (Soosalu
et al., 2010), the impact of which could be explored in the future. The relatively low values of SWA
to the north-east of Herubrei correspond to a region of elevated Vp/Vs observed in a tomographic
study of the region (Greenfield et al., 2016), which was interpreted to be a sign of elevated fluid
content. This is consistent with the suggestion from Nowacki et al. (2018) that a higher Vp/Vs may
indicate that there are more fluids present, which in turn causes lower effective anisotropy, and may
also explain the relatively low SWA values below the Askja geothermal field, on the eastern edge
of the skjuvatn caldera. However, I should note that elevated Vp/Vs need not necessarily imply
lower anisotropy; for instance, Wang et al. (2012) made laboratory observations of cracked samples
and carried out effective media modelling, which suggested that the presence of high Vp/Vs ratios is
indicative of significant crack-induced anisotropy. Consequently, it may prove beneficial to explore
models for the effective elastic stiffness of a medium hosting cracks with varying aspect ratios and
fluids and compare these to the anisotropic response (if any) of the crust to stress transients, such as
the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dyke intrusion, which triggered seismicity on these faults Winder
(2021).
The spatial trends in the orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy are broadly consistent with both
the observed surface features from geological mapping and the plate-spreading direction (Figure
4.4). This is consistent with findings from other rift environments (Illsley-Kemp et al., 2017; Menke
et al., 1994; Nowacki et al., 2018), where the fast axis of anisotropy was found to be aligned to the
present-day minimum compressive stress i.e. rift parallel. In these studies, the source of anisotropy
is also attributed to aligned cracks in the top 34 km of the crust. Such crack alignment in the very
shallow crust is also present in other tectonic environments, including fold and thrust belts. For
example, de Lorenzo and Trabace (2011) investigate local earthquake shear-wave splitting using
data recorded in the central Appenines, and attribute anisotropy in the top 45 km of the crust to
fault-parallel fluid-filled crack systems.
As Figure 4.7 illustrates, the orientations of the fast axis of anisotropy are not uniformly rift-parallel;
for instance, in the very south they have a stronger easterly component compared to those in the
north. It is likely that the regional stress field in the south of the area is overprinted by the ongoing
deformation that is taking place around Askja, as well as potentially being affected by the loading
of the crust due to the presence of Vatnajkull to the south. Subsidence of the main caldera has
been ongoing since 1983 (de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2012), possibly due to the cooling and
74 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
contraction of an underlying magma body, although recent micro-gravity increases may be due to
magma flow into a shallow magma chamber (de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2013). Such local stress
changes and associated deformation may be responsible for scattered horizontal velocity vectors
measured by GPS stations in the vicinity of Askja (rnadttir et al., 2009; Drouin et al., 2017);
consequently, the disruption to the pattern of anisotropy around Askja is perhaps not surprising. In
the presence of a deflating source, the orientation of the maximum horizontal stresses within the
crust tends to be concentric to the centre of deflation (e.g. Johnson and Poland, 2013). In contrast,
the maximum horizontal stresses induced by an inflating source tend to be radial to the centre of
inflation. In the next section, I use stress modelling to investigate the relationship between the
stresses associated with the deflation of Askja and plate spreading, and the measured orientations
of the fast axis of anisotropy across the region.
4.4.2 Stress modelling
Numerous studies have concluded that the orientation of anisotropy in the crust is generally con-
trolled by the regional stress field and/or the alignment of structures, such as fissures and faults
(Illsley-Kemp et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2011; Savage et al., 2010). Distinguishing between
stress-induced and structural anisotropy in the Northern Volcanic Zone is made somewhat more
complex by the fact that the regional stress field is also the primary control on the orientation
of structural features. It is observed, however, that the system of faults between the Askja and
Kverkfjll rift segments (responsible for a large proportion of the tectonic seismicity in the region)
is composed of conjugate strike-slip faults oblique to the strike of the plate margin (see Figure
4.1). This suggests that I can rule out fabric resulting from the damage zones around faults as a
mechanism generating (significant) anisotropy, based on the regional averages. This observation
may have implications as to the nature of faults that can influence the surrounding anisotropic field
and the spatial extent over which they are capable of doing so. The strike-slip faults in question
do not exhibit typical mainshock-aftershock behaviou, instead relieving strain accumulated in the
brittle crust via swarms of earthquakes that migrate along the fault surface. Since records began, no
earthquakes with a local magnitude greater than 4 have been observed on these faults, despite a
number of them being sufficiently long to do so.
I explored the role of stress in the generation of anisotropy by modelling the regional stress field
around Askja using the Coulomb v3.3 software package (Toda et al., 2011). Whereas the ductile
lower crust (deeper than around 68 km, based on the depth extent of the seismic catalogue (Soosalu
et al., 2010)) is able to deform by continuous creep under the extensional stresses, accretion and
extension of the brittle upper crust is episodic in nature. Over time, elastic strain accumulates in the
brittle crust, before being released over short, intense periods of dyking and extensional faulting, as
seen during the 201415 eruption of Brarbunga (e.g. gstsdttir et al., 2019; Sigmundsson et al.,
2014; Woods et al., 2019). I model this process using a buried dislocation, which has previously

been used to model plate boundary deformation in the rift zones of Iceland (rnadttir et al., 2006;
LaFemina et al., 2005). This model assumes that spreading below the brittle-ductile boundary is
constant and equal to the full-spreading rate, represented by an opening Okada dislocation (Okada,
1992) extending from the locking depth to infinite depth. The stress singularity at the upper edge of
the buried dislocation is eliminated from the model by tapering the dislocation such that the opening
gradient goes to 0 at the topmost edge (Heimisson and Segall, 2020). The spreading boundary
is taken to pass through Askja, striking along the rift segment at N015E. A small component
of spreading is assigned to the Kverkfjll rift segment, though it is debatable whether any active
spreading is occurring in this region. However, this inclusion does not significantly impact the
modelled stress field. The ongoing deflation beneath Askja is incorporated using the best-fitting
76 Seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust of the Northern Volcanic Zone
(analytical) solution from forward modelling of GPS data (Drouin et al., 2017). This results in a
point Mogi source at 3.5 km depth beneath the Askja caldera (see Figure 4.8), with a volumetric
change of 0.0013 km3 / year. While both models are highly simplified, neglecting visco-elasticity
in particular, they are sufficient to capture, to first order, the tectonic stress state of the crust. The
input files for this modelling are available in Appendix B.
Using the method of Lund and Townend (2007), I extract the maximum horizontal stress vectors
(SHmax) from the final model at a depth of 0 km b.s.l., where I expect the impact of the stress field
to have the most significant effect on the opening/closure of cracks. I observe a strong correlation
between the orientations of fast directions and SHmax across the region, including a similar rotation
moving from south to north. This provides a strong link between the stress field and the anisotropy,
as would be expected for the EDA mechanism. The differences, particularly at the southern end
of the region, are likely to be due to the component of strain imparted by the presence of the
Vatnajkull ice cap, which is not included in the modelling. Interpolating the strain field directly
from the available GPS data may prove valuable in assessing how much of the observed rotation is
due to the unmodelled components. Around Askja, the modelled strain field shows a similar level
of scatter to what is observed in Figure 4.7, though there is no particular coherency in alignment.
This is likely to be due to the limited spatial resolution of the splitting measurements, coupled with
the simplifying assumptions made in the stress modelling. Careful analysis of the temporal changes
in the anisotropic signal in response to stress transients, such as the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun
dyke intrusion, may provide more supporting evidence for the EDA mechanism dominating the
generation of anisotropy in the upper crust in the Northern Volcanic Zone.
4.5 Conclusions 77
4.5 Conclusions
I have presented shear-wave splitting results from the Northern Volcanic Zone, Iceland, based on
a large dataset of local earthquakes that span a period of more than 7 years. The dense, stable
network has allowed me to image the anisotropic properties of the Icelandic crust with a high spatial
resolution. These observations have allowed me to investigate the likely mechanisms generating
this anisotropy, whether controlled by the stress state, or structural features in the nascent oceanic
crust in the region around Askja. The main findings of this chapter include:
1. Based on earthquakes that occur between the surface and 10 km depth, anisotropy is largely
restricted to the top 34 km of the crust
2. Delay time variations in the shallow anisotropic layer are consistent with the presence of
cracks that gradually close with depth
3. SWA is strongest in regions of elevated seismicity, particularly in the zone between the Askja
and Kverkfjll rift segments, which appears to be heavily fractured
4. The dominant orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy is almost perpendicular to the
spreading direction, which indicates that regional stress is the dominant control on anisotropy
5. In the neighbourhood of Askja, the orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy becomes
scattered, which is consistent with stress modelling results that use a Mogi source located
3.5 km beneath the main caldera.
In the next chapter, I will focus on a catalogue of earthquakes that occur in the lower, typically
ductile and aseismic, crust in the region around Askja, and the constraints they may be able to
supply on anisotropy in the lower crust, which has previously been imaged by ambient noise
tomography.
Chapter 5
Exploring the role of melt in generating
seismic anisotropy in the lower crust
around Askja
This chapter is a continuation of the work presented in Chapter 4. Here, I have used the deeper
(> 10 km) seismicity in the Askja region, related to melt and associated transport processes, to
explore the anisotropic structure of the lower, ductile crust. I seek to relate observations of shear-
wave splitting to the spatial distribution of seismic anisotropy in the lower crust and explore what
this can reveal about melt and the active volcanic system of Askja.
5.1 Introduction
There is a significant body of work dedicated to the study of seismic anisotropythe directional
dependence of seismic wavespeedin the oceanic crust (e.g. Hess, 1964; Stephen, 1981; White and
Whitmarsh, 1984). Collectively, these works suggest that the formation of elastic anisotropy in the
oceanic crust is primarily controlled by processes and conditions at mid-ocean ridges, where new
material is accreted. So far, however, these works have predominantly focussed on the upper, brittle
portion of the crust, which has been found, nearly ubiquitously, to be anisotropic to some degree
(e.g. Stephen, 1981). The lower portion of the crust has proven more difficult to image successfully
on anything but a large scale, due in part to both the difficulty in instrumenting the oceanic crust,
the available earthquake sources, and the inherent limitations of the methods by which seismic
anisotropy can be determined. Surface (e.g. Love and Rayleigh) waves are sensitive to both az-
imuthal and radial anisotropy (in terms of differences in VSH and VSV ) as a function of depth, but do
not provide a high degree of lateral resolution. Studies seeking to illuminate sub-surface structures
from passive source surface wave velocities are commonly limited to periods of 1 s or greater,
due principally to the trade-off between the dominant period of the surface waves and their depth
80 Exploring the role of melt in generating seismic anisotropy in the lower crust around Askja
sensitivity. In addition to this, it is common in the analysis of surface wave velocities that make
use of ambient noise to require a minimum inter-station distance that is 23 times the dominant
wavelength of interest (e.g. Arroucau et al., 2010; Pilia et al., 2015; Volk et al., 2021; Yao et al.,
2006), in order to satisfy the far-field approximation of the effective surface-wave Greens function.
Consequently, this creates a strong and implicit inverse relationship between the attainable lateral
and vertical resolutions. Short periods can be used to achieve higher degrees of lateral resolution,
but are only sensitive to shallow structure, and vice-versa. This is before even considering the
network coverage, which is often sparse and non-uniform. Together, this means that small-scale (
10 km) lateral variations in the anisotropic properties of the lower crust (e.g. deeper than 10 km) are
difficult to resolve. Conversely, body waves from local earthquakes within the region of interest can
provide a much finer scale picture of the sub-surface, but again can be limited by the event coverage
(both laterally and with depth). Shear-wave splitting (another phenomenon arising due to seismic
anisotropy) in vertically propagating shear phases can be used to attain excellent lateral resolution,
butas is often the case in seismologythe anisotropic observables are an integrated function
of the elastic properties of the medium over the entire path. This can be remedied somewhat by
using earthquake sources distributed over a range of depths, preferably uniformly and starting at
the base of the anisotropic layer of interest. Thus, when seeking to measure the anisotropic proper-
ties of the crust it is important do so in light of results from both surface wave and body wave studies.
Iceland encompasses a subaerial section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it has been elevated as a
result of the confluence of the divergent margin between the North American and Eurasian plates
and the anomalous upwelling of hot mantle material known as the Iceland mantle plume (Schilling,
1973). Consequently, it provides an excellent opportunity to densely instrument a mid-ocean
ridge and study seismic anisotropy in-situ as the nascent crust is accreted. The vertical structure
of the oceanic crust formed along the rift zones in Iceland is believed to closely mirror that of
generic oceanic crust, but an elevated volume of melta direct result of the presence of the mantle
plumehas led to a varying degree of thickening of the various layers within the crust (Jenkins
et al., 2018; White and McKenzie, 1989, 1995) across the Iceland-Greenland plateau (see Figure
3.2). Rifting across Iceland is confined to banded volcanic systems which delineate the on-land
position of the mid-ocean ridge. These systems are characterised by varying volcanic and seismic
signatures (e.g. Einarsson, 2008; Einarsson and Brandsdttir, 2021), suggesting some degree of
non-uniformity between them. For example, the volcanic system around Askja, a volcano in the
Northern Volcanic Zone (see Figure 5.1) which last erupted in 1962, exhibits persistent seismicity
in the lower, ductile crust. This phenomenon is uncommon in Icelandic volcanoes (Jnsdttir et al.,
2007; Schuler et al., 2015), with seismicity typically confined to the upper, brittle crust (< 8 km
depth). Emerging evidence, however, suggests that similar pockets of deep earthquakes do occur
elsewhere in Iceland, where it has also been related to the transit of melt up through the trans-crustal
melt storage system sills to feed volcanic systems, including Brarbunga, Eyjafjallajkull, and

eistareykir (Hudson et al., 2017; Schuler et al., 2015; Soosalu et al., 2010; Tarasewicz et al., 2012;
Winder, 2021).
The lower crust in Iceland has been shown to be anisotropic on the scale of 100s of km using
ambient noise imaging (Volk et al., 2021), but the knowledge of any small-scale features is lost since
surface wave techniques are simply incapable of resolving them. Studies of shear-wave splitting
in teleseismic, core-refracted phases have revealed a pattern of splitting not easily explained by
simple mantle flow models (Bjarnason et al., 2002; Xue and Allen, 2005), but these phases are
sensitive to anisotropy anywhere between the core-mantle boundary and the surface, making the
discernment of any crustal contribution difficult. A shallow layer of anisotropy has been observed in
the crust around Askja and has been attributed to the presence of small cracks in the brittle crust that
preferentially close in accordance with the regional stress field (Bacon et al., 2021). However, the
porosity of oceanic crust is believed to tend to zero by depths of around 34 km (Christensen, 1984),
meaning additional mechanisms of generating seismic anisotropy are likely to be needed to explain
any observations that cannot simply be attributed to the shallow layer. Collectively, these works and
their limitations warrant an investigation of seismic anisotropy in the mid- to lower oceanic crust,
which is facilitated in the region around Askja by the persistent seismicity in the lower, ductile crust.
The presence of melt can also strongly influence the elastic properties of the crust. Indeed, a number
of studies focussing on the East African Rift Valley system have invoked oriented melt pockets
(OMP) to explain observations of shear-wave splitting in a continental rift setting (Bastow et al.,
2010; Holtzman and Kendall, 2010; Keir et al., 2005; Kendall et al., 2006, 2005). The theoretical
basis of this mechanism is identical to that of fluid-saturated cracks in the shallow crust (Kendall,
1994), wherein the stark contrast in the elastic properties of the host body and the inclusion generate
effective seismic anisotropy at sufficiently long wavelengths. Evidence from Icelandic volcanic
systems points to a trans-crustal model wherein melts are stored over a range of depths in the crust
(e.g. Maclennan, 2019). The consensus is that the storage of melt is predominantly in the form of
stacked sills (which may have a vertical thickness of about 10 m), connected by narrow conduits,
within a largely solid rock that likely has thin mushy1 layers on their margins. As melt percolates
up through the crust under buoyancy, it is likely to occupy vertically oriented pockets, which may
lead to anisotropy if distributed over a sufficiently large area. On the scale of the basic building
block of the Icelandic volcanic zonesa central volcano and an associated fissure swarmit
is likely that the distribution and, consequently, the volume of melt is heterogeneous, to which
measurements of shear-wave splitting may be sensitive. As with other seismic imaging techniques,
however, shear-wave splitting produces path-integrated measures of the anisotropy of the medium
on a far longer length scale than any of the proposed models for melt storage ( 10 m for stacked
sills or  101 m for mush models) and thus is unlikely to be able to provide any clear evidence by

which to differentiate between them.
Besides melt, the mid-to-lower crust in Iceland is expected to be composed of gabbroic and olivine-
rich cumulates (e.g. Jenkins et al., 2018), which are principally made up of highly intrinsically
anisotropic minerals (e.g. olivine). Flow in the ductile crust can lead to the development of LPO
type anisotropy and has been used to explain the large degree of positive radial anisotropy observed
in the lower crust in a recent ambient noise study (Volk et al., 2021). This mechanism may factor
into any seismic anisotropy in the mid-to-lower crust observed using shear waves originating from
earthquakes in the lower, ductile crust.

5.2 Data and Methods 83
In this chapter, I use the deep earthquakes present in the ductile crust beneath Askja to explore how
seismic anisotropy in the mid-to-lower crust varies spatially, both laterally and as a function of
depth. These results are interpreted in the context of two recent ambient noise studies in Iceland
(Volk, 2021; Volk et al., 2021) and local earthquake tomography of Askja (Greenfield et al., 2016).
5.2 Data and Methods
Continuous seismic data were recorded by a network of 3-component, broadband seismometers
operated by the University of Cambridge since 2008. I have used the highly complete and robust
earthquake catalogue of Greenfield et al. (2020), generated using the Coalescence Microseismic
Mapping algorithm (Drew et al., 2013), which spans the period 20092015. This catalogue was
subsequently extended using the same processing technique to include data from 20152018
(Winder et al., 2018). The final catalogue consists of a total of 58,143 earthquakes. The majority of
these earthquakes (52,141, or 89.7%) are related to volcano-tectonic processes, which have been
treated in Chapter 4. The final 10.3% (6,002) of earthquakes occur in the lower crust; it is these
earthquakes that are the focus of this chapter.
The deep seismicity of Askja is focussed in three areas: there are multiple distinct clusters beneath
the layered caldera complex of Askja; to the north-east of Askja, beneath the shield volcano Kollt-
tadyngja; and east of Askja, beneath the shield volcano Vaalda. The latter two shield volcanoes
last erupted at the beginning of the current interglacial period and during the last interglacial
period, respectively (Sigvaldason et al., 1992). These earthquakes exhibit both cluster- (spatially
coherent, but over a period of many years) and swarm-like (occurring closely in both space and
time) behaviour. There is scant evidence of any systematic spatial or temporal migration of the
seismicity, suggesting the mechanism by which these earthquakes are generated is static, and does
not follow the propagating front of melt, as is commonly seen during the intrusion of melt in the
crust. The repetitive nature of the earthquakes (i.e. recordings for different events exhibit nearly
identical waveforms) in the Vaalda cluster is also indicative of a non-destructive mechanism.
A very high b-value of 3.4 is measured for this cluster, which suggests that the mechanism is
likely related to the presence of fluids and/or high thermal gradients, either of which is capable of
producing seismicity in the typically aseismic ductile lower crust (e.g. Drouin et al., 2017; Soosalu
et al., 2010). Greenfield et al. (2016) produced a tomographic image of the crust around Askja
volcano, in which large low shear wave velocity anomalies (with a higher than background VP/VS)
were found around each of the regions exhibiting clusters of deep earthquakes (see Figure 5.2).
Such properties are associated with high temperatures and possibly the presence of melt, which
provides an additional strand of evidence to support the hypothesis that these earthquakes are
generated by high strain rates due to the movement of fluids through the crust.

The deep earthquakes used in this study were spatially partitioned into clusters using the k-means
clustering algorithm. The number of target clusters, k, was varied between 5 and 8 (guided by the
number of clusters visually identified in Greenfield (2015) and Greenfield et al. (2020)). The final
number of clusters chosen was 8, which produced the best visual separation of the earthquakes
in 7 distinct clusters, with the final cluster handling a number of earthquakes associated with the
tectonic faulting around Herubrei that were likely mislocated below 8 km depth. This distinction
was confirmed by looking at the mean peak frequency for the events in each cluster. In all but the
cluster centred around Herubrei, the peak frequency was  3.5 Hz which is consistent with the
observation that the deeper earthquakes tend to have a lower frequency content (Greenfield, 2015).
5.3 Results and discussion 85
Conversely, the final cluster had a mean peak frequency of 6.2 Hz, which is more characteristic of
the tectonic faulting in the brittle part of the crust. This cluster was disregarded in further analysis
and the average centres, peak frequencies, and measured delay times for the remaining 7 deep
clusters are provided in Table 5.1.
The subsequent measurement of the shear-wave splitting parameters,  and  t, is performed in an
identical manner to that laid out in Section 4.2.
5.2.1 Shear wave anisotropy
In order to explore the spatial distribution of the presence, and strength, of seismic anisotropy
within the lower crust, it is first necessary to convert  t into a measure that is independent of
the path length between the source and the receiver. For this, I use the shear wave anisotropy
(SWA; Thomas and Kendall, 2002), a, which characterises the strength of anisotropy as a fractional
perturbation of the average shear wave speed, v:
 t = tslow  t f ast =
v 12av
v+ 12av
 a =
 tv
 tv
)2 (5.1)
where tslow and t f ast are the slow and fast traveltimes, respectively. This non-path-integrated
measure of seismic anisotropy enables me to make genuine comparisons between measurements
made for different event-station pairs. Following the results presented in Chapter 4, static correction
of 0.1 s was applied to all of the measurements of  t for the deep source events, as a means of
correcting for the shallow crustal component of splitting. This does make the (possibly invalid)
assumption that the seismic anisotropy present in the lower crust is aligned with the component of
seismic anisotropy in the shallow crust. However, this static correction does not impact the patterns
of lateral variations in seismic anisotropy.
5.3 Results and discussion
The full set of shear-wave splitting observations exhibits a mean  t of 0.19  0.11 s, which is
higher than the 0.100.05 s calculated in Chapter 4 for the shallow crust. Lateral variations in the
strength of anisotropy and the large range of source-receiver paths is most likely responsible for the
degree of spread in the  t measurements. In Chapter 4, I concluded that the shear-wave splitting
observations were best explained by the presence of a shallow, 34 km thick layer of porous and
fractured crust. Accordingly, the elevated value of  t observed from the set of measurements from
earthquakes between 1525 km depth suggests the presence of an additional mechanism producing
86 Exploring the role of melt in generating seismic anisotropy in the lower crust around Askja
the observed seismic anisotropy. It is not clear, however, where exactly at depth such a layer lies, or
whether the observations are reflective of seismic anisotropy distributed along the path or focussed
around the sources of the earthquakes.

The arithmetic means of the  t measurements for each cluster increase in a near monotonic
fashion with respect to cluster centroid depth (Figure 5.3). This points towards a source of seismic
anisotropy that is distributed across the same range of depths as the seismicitythat is, there is
a layer of the mid-to-lower crust that is anisotropic, unlike in Chapter 4 where it was concluded
the source of seismic anisotropy lay shallower than the sources used in the study. The deep events
to the north-east of Vaalda, which originate in the deep Upptyppingar dyke intrusion (cluster 5
in Table 5.1, shown in green in Figures 5.3 and 5.1), exhibit an average  t more similar to the
shallower clusters around Askja. This intrusion, which occurred in 2007, was accompanied by
a large amount of seismicity distributed along a dipping plane corresponding to the body of the
magmatic intrusion, rather than in the discrete spatial clusters observed elsewhere (Martens and
White, 2013; Martens et al., 2010). Consequently, the observations from earthquakes associated
with this magmatic intrusion are not discussed further and may in fact be suited for a dedicated
study.
5.3.1 Frequency dependence
As mentioned previously, the typical frequency content of the signals from these deep earthquakes
differs from that of the shallower seismicity discussed in Chapter 4, falling in the range of 34 Hz,
as opposed to 68 Hz. The MFAST software performs a sweep over a range of bandpass filter
parameters, seeking to maximise the product of the signal-to-noise ratio for the shear phase arrival
within the bandwidth of the filter. Shear-wave splitting has been shown to possess some depen-
dence on the frequency (e.g. Marson-Pidgeon and Savage, 1997)waves with different periods
are sensitive to different spatial regions around the ray path, which in turn changes the effective
anisotropic structure "seen" by the wave.

88 Exploring the role of melt in generating seismic anisotropy in the lower crust around Askja
The map in Figure 5.4 shows the lateral distribution of the peak frequency, as a means of assessing
the potential for a spatial biasing of the lateral variations in SWA discussed in Section 5.3.2. For
each event-station pair, the peak frequency measured in a window around the shear phase arrival
has been re-gridded in the same way as for observations of SWA. Each observation is attributed to
the mid-point between the source and receiverin order to remain consistent with the assignment
of SWA measurementsbefore being gridded. Grid cells with fewer than 3 observations are
disregarded and a Gaussian filter is applied with a 1  width of 2 km. As has been previously
observed, there does appear to be an attenuation of signals passing through the region beneath
Askja, which has been tentatively attributed to the presence of shallow melt storage (Greenfield,
2015). While this form of data representation does not produce as robust an indication of the
attenuative properties of the crust as a formal attenuation tomography study, I believe it is sufficient
to support the suggestion that the regions of elevated SWA are not simply artefacts arising from
frequency-dependent anisotropic structure and sampling bias.

5.3 Results and discussion 89
I have also explored the frequency dependence of  t as a function of earthquake depth across a
range of filter options, shown in Figure 5.5. For depths greater than 15 km, there is a correlation
between the highpass (lowcut) of the bandpass filter and the delay time. This correlation broadly
holds between 1015 km depth, though there are fewer earthquakes in this depth range to properly
constrain the results. This is in contrast to the shallow splitting presented in Chapter 4, for which
there is no strong frequency dependence. Longer period waves sample a larger volume of rock,
which perhaps indicates that the source of anisotropy is fairly heterogeneously distributed on
a similar scale to which waves with peak frequencies between 0.58 Hz are sensitive. As the
wavelength increases, the medium appears more homogeneously anisotropic, and thus the strength
of anisotropy increases (assuming it still possesses some degree of ordering at a larger scale).

5.3.2 Lateral variations in shear wave anisotropy
Measurements of  t were converted to SWA using Equation 5.1, as described in Section 5.2.1,
before the lateral variations were mapped out. This was carried out by assigning each measurement
to the mid-point of the straight-line ray connecting the source to the receiver and mapping the
resultant dataset onto a regular 2-D grid with cell dimensions of 0.5 x 0.5 km2 (values of 0.25 x
0.25 km2 and 1 x 1 km2 were also used, with little impact on the result). A symmetric 2-D Gaussian
spatial filter was then applied to this re-gridded dataset to account for the lateral uncertainties in

Fig. 5.6 Map of the lateral variation in percentage shear wave anisotropy from the deep clusters of
earthquakes (denoted by small black dots) overlaid on the local topography. Stations from which
data have been used are denoted by grey triangles.
Two regions of elevated SWA stand out in the region (Figure 5.6), both of which are co-located
with regions of the lower crust that host the deep clusters of earthquakes. The first (and largest
amplitude) anomaly is situated just to the north of the main Askja caldera. However, such an
elevated anomaly is notably absent in the lower crust around the Vaalda cluster. Comparison with
a study of the lateral variations in shear wave anisotropy in the shallow crust beneath the caldera
complex of Askja (Bacon et al., 2021) suggests that the source of anisotropy is at least deeper
than 5 km. Elsewhere, the level of SWA is fairly low (24%) and appears to be uncorrelated
with the lateral variations in SWA observed in the shallow crust (Bacon et al., 2021). In fact, the
5.3 Results and discussion 91
regions of elevated SWA in the deep and shallow crust roughly tessellatethat is, the lateral extent
of the regions showing elevated shear wave anisotropy do not strongly overlapa feature that
is also apparent in the seismicity (Winder, 2021). It remains unclear quite why this relationship
might exist, and indeed why the crust in this particular region exhibits deep seismicity that is so
anomalous to that observed elsewhere in Iceland.
By comparison with observations of shear wave anisotropy beneath the caldera complex of Askja
obtained from shallow (<10 km) earthquakes (see Figure 4.6), it is reasonable to suggest that the
observed high in SWA observed to the north of the main Askja caldera (see Figure 5.6) is not solely
attributable to a shallow source. Local body wave tomography also places a region of elevated
VP/VS (1.81.9) in this region. While it is a difficult task to demonstrably detect melt using
seismic imaging techniques, both due to the way in which melt is thought to be stored in volcanic
plumbing systems and due to resolvability limitations, the presence of fluids (i.e. melt) in a body
will reduce VS and thus lead to elevated VP/VS values (though this is also a function of pore fluid
pressure, as well as a number of other factors).
Through a process of elimination, as well as the close correlation between the spatial distribution
of elevated SWA, seismicity, and surface manifestations of these subterranean melt networks (i.e.
calderas, cones, lava fields etc.), it is possible to conclude that melt must play some role in the
seismic anisotropic structure of the mid-to-lower crust. However, it is worth seeking a means of
putting reasonable numerical bounds on this conclusion, at least to first order. For this, I turn
to effective media modelling, whereby I can calculate the effective elastic stiffness tensor for an
isotropic medium hosting aligned melt inclusions.
5.3.3 Effective media modelling
The seismic properties of a body hosting melt vary strongly as a function of the shape and orienta-
tion of melt inclusions; in order to generate significant seismic anisotropy, melt pockets must be
oriented in such a way as to produce a larger reduction in the shear velocity along one horizontal
axis than the other e.g. vertically aligned, ellipsoidal melt inclusions (e.g. Kendall, 1994). This can
be reasonably expected in such a setting, as melt migrates up through the crust, ponding in sills
beneath permeability barriers. Here, I follow the method outlined in Hammond and Kendall (2016)
to establish a mapping from the percent volume of melt in the host body (the melt fraction) and
the aspect ratio of the inclusions to an effective elastic stiffness tensor describing the composite
medium (formed from an isotropic medium hosting isolated, aligned melt inclusions), from which
one can extract seismic velocities using the Christoffel equation (see Section 2.5.1). This mapping
is made using the theory of Tandon and Weng (1984), which is based on the assumption that
an applied stress is perturbed by inclusions, building on the formalism of Eshelby (1957), who
determined the strain perturbation due to an ellipsoidal inclusion that may be either prolate/oblate
92 Exploring the role of melt in generating seismic anisotropy in the lower crust around Askja
or tubular in shape. Tandon and Weng (1984) generalised this theory to determine the effects of
multiple aligned inclusions and inclusion aspect ratio on the composite elastic moduli. This is,
naturally, an idealised view of the effect of melt on seismic properties. In reality, melt is likely
distributed heterogeneously throughout a volcanic system and inclusions may interactneither of
which are implicitly accounted forand there is no implicit means of factoring in the frequency
dependent behaviour observed in the shear-wave splitting measurements. However, I believe this
approximation is sufficient to provide an answer to how the shear wave anisotropy and VP/VS ratio
will behave in the presence of melt, to first order.

the grey lines. The 1.8 and 1.9 VP/VS ratio contours are shown by the white lines.
For the isotropic host medium, I have used P- and S-wave velocities of 7.05 and 3.94 km s1,
respectivelyderived from an optimised 1-D velocity model at 15 km depth (Greenfield, 2015)
and a density of 2890 kg m3 (Carlson and Raskin, 1984; Carlson and Herrick, 1990), which
are 10% lower than those used in Hammond and Kendall (2016). For the melt, I use the same
coefficients as Hammond and Kendall (2016), that is 2.7 and 0.0 km s1 for the P- and S-wave
5.3 Results and discussion 93
velocities, respectively, and a density of 2700 kg m3 (Stolper and Walker, 1980). I limit my
analyses to vertically oriented, prolate inclusions (aspect ratio,  < 1), vertically propagating
waves, and melt fractions of up to 20%. The percent shear wave anisotropy and VP/VS ratio are
calculated after extracting the 3 solutions to the Christoffel equation using the effective anisotropic
stiffness tensor, which correspond to VP, VS1 , and VS2 . The results of the search over the aspect ratio
and melt fraction are shown in Figure 5.7. Contours through the resultant parameter spaces for
SWA and VP/VS, corresponding to upper and lower bounds based on the observations presented
in this chapter and Greenfield et al. (2016), respectively, are shown in order to provide a visual
constraint on the values of  and the melt fraction capable of satisfying both datasets.
As is noted in Hammond and Kendall (2016), the impact of melt on seismic wavespeeds is likely
overestimated in this modelling (and, thus, so too are the required melt fractions), since it does not
account for a number of additional effects related to the presence of melt on the seismic properties
of the crust, such as the cuspate nature of melt inclusions (Hammond and Humphreys, 2000).
However, based on the results of the modelling, aspect ratios of 0.10.3 and melt fractions up
to 10% can explain both the anomalies in shear wave anisotropy and VP/VS, while remaining
physically reasonable bounds. Consequently, I believe it is plausible that the shear-wave splitting
observations can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of melt within the volcanic plumbing
system of Askja.
The highly localised, strong signal of seismic anisotropy observed at depth below Askja may have
important implications for observations of seismic anisotropy, and subsequent conclusions, in
surface wave studies which, as opposed to shear-wave splitting, have good depth resolution but
poor lateral resolution. Highly anisotropic regions at depth will likely manifest as much more
diffuse anomalies over a wider spatial region in the lower crust. At sufficiently large scales, these
anomalies may be overprinted by more macroscopic anisotropic domains, such as LPO anisotropy
due to lower crustal flow (Volk et al., 2021) and become completely invisible in surface wave
studies. This highlights the importance of a multi-faceted approach for building a complete picture
of seismic anisotropy, and thus structure and stress, throughout the crust.
94 Exploring the role of melt in generating seismic anisotropy in the lower crust around Askja
5.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, I have explored the anisotropic structure of the lower, ductile crust in the region
around Askja volcano using a catalogue of earthquakes that are thought to result from the movement
of magma through the crustal melt storage system. A strong correlation is drawn between regions
expected to host elevated volumes of melt, particularly around Askja volcano and Kollttadyngja,
suggesting the melt is somewhat organised at long wavelengths and gives rise to seismic anisotropy.
The region around the Vaalda cluster, however, stands out in contrast to these two regions insofar
as there does not appear to be an elevated SWA signal. This does not appear to be related to how
well the network geometry samples the region since there are stations nearly directly above the
earthquake cluster centroid. With the development of an updated and extended catalogue for the
entire region around Askja (created using QuakeMigrate), which reveals that the deep seismicity is
even more concentrated than originally thought, it might prove valuable to make further shear-wave
splitting measurements and investigate the differences between clusters in finer detail (Winder,
2021).
With seismic anisotropy being an aggregate property of the rock along the path between the source
and the receiver, it is inherently challenging to differentiate between the proposed mechanisms of
melt storage in volcanic systems such as Askja. However, this work does suggest that there exists
some degree of heterogeneity in the distribution of melt within a given volcanic system and that
shear-wave splitting provides an additional means of constraint to this problem. Hammond and
Kendall (2016) perform melt segregation inversions from P- and S-wave velocity data, which may
be extended to the incorporation of shear-wave splitting data, such as that presented in this chapter,
thus providing a means of investigating the distribution of melt in the plumbing system feeding
Askja volcano.
These results warrant further exploration of shear-wave splitting in other regions that exhibit
seismicity in the otherwise ductile lower crust in order to fully explore the potential relationship
between seismicity, melt storage, and, subsequently, melt-induced seismic anisotropy. A number of
volcanic systems in Iceland are appropriate for this class of study, from which it would be possible
to compare and contrast the observations of seismic anisotropy, drawing on additional geophysical
and geochemical datasets to try and better understand these complex and fascinating systems.
Chapter 6
Seismic anisotropy in the nascent Icelandic
crust: synthesis and future directions
The results presented in Chapters 4 and 5 are derived solely from the analysis of body waves. As
discussed in Chapter 2, however, seismic anisotropy also has a quantifiable impact on the velocities
of Rayleigh and Love waves, due to different sensitivities to horizontal and vertical structures.
Two recent works have examined phase velocities at different scales across Iceland, by means of
ambient noise analysis, and specifically explore the anisotropic structures to which surface waves
are sensitive. Here, I synthesise my results with these observations and draw some conclusions on
the anisotropic structure of the Icelandic crust, then discuss some future directions for this work.
6.1 Synthesis with surface wave observations
As has been noted, studies of seismic anisotropy based purely on either body waves or surface waves
are inherently limited in scope. In order to build a complete picture, it is helpful to incorporate
information from multiple, independent strands of analysis.
In the region around Askja (e.g. on a local scale), differences in VSH and VSV are resolvable from
Rayleigh and Love waves (Volk, 2021). These observations, which primarily constrain the upper
56 km of the crust, are shown in Figure 6.1. The observed radial anisotropy in the crust shallower
than 4 km below sea level (Figure 6.1ac) is negative (i.e. VSH <VSV ), with higher amplitudes in
the shallower crust. This is consistent with subvertical aligned microcracks in the brittle, porous
crust which gradually close as a function of depth. By 4 km below sea level, the sign of the radial
anisotropy has nearly ubiquitously switched from negative to weakly positive (though this is near
the limit of the achievable depth resolution). Lateral variations are less well constrained by this
surface wave technique. Overall, these results back up the conclusions of Chapter 4, supporting the
inference that seismic anisotropy is predominantly constrained to a shallow layer of the crust.

of Askja is delineated by the black lines and the edge of Vatnajkull can be seen at the south-east
edge of the region.
6.1 Synthesis with surface wave observations 97
On the wider scale, measurements of seismic anisotropy extracted from a pan-Iceland ambient noise
study show a positive peak in radial anisotropy at a depth of between 15 and 30 km (Volk et al.,
2021). The mechanism responsible for this peak is constrained using observations of azimuthal
anisotropy, which exhibit the 2 variation diagnostic of LPO anisotropy.
Through consideration of the results I have presented in Chapters 4 and 5 in conjunction with those
in Volk (2021); Volk et al. (2021), I have developed a conceptual model of the likely mechanisms
that are responsible for the observed seismic anisotropy throughout the Icelandic crust (Figure
6.2). This model would benefit from additional studies focussing on regions around other central
volcanoes (e.g. Krafla, at the northern end of the Northern Volcanic Zone), as well as the aseismic
segments of the spreading ridge between volcanic systems.

98 Seismic anisotropy in the nascent Icelandic crust: synthesis and future directions
6.2 Future directions
With the establishment, from both body wave and surface wave analyses, of a conceptual model for
the anisotropic structure of the Icelandic crust in the vicinity of an active volcanic rift system, it
is now possible to begin to consider the impact of dynamic, transient events such as the 201415
Brarbunga-Holuhraun rifting event and, more recently, the ongoing (since March 2021) eruption
on the Reykjanes Peninsula. If, as is demonstrated in Chapter 4, the principal control on seismic
anisotropy in the shallow, brittle crust is the preferential closure of fractures in response to the stress
field, then it stands to reason that transient changes to the stress field should induce corresponding
and potentially observable changes in the anisotropic properties of the crust. Indeed, some works
have shown this to be possible (e.g. Illsley-Kemp et al., 2018), but only a handful of dyke intrusions
have been sufficiently densely instrumentedboth in terms of seismometers and GPS ground
stationsto enable the exploration of the dynamic response of the crust in fine detail. Initial results
suggest that the orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy does correspond well with the far-field
stress induced by the dyke intrusion, but that this starts to break down for stations within a few
kilometres of the leading edge of the dyke (Baltas, 2021). This highlights the need to develop more
detailed models for the near-field stress induced by the advancing dyke intrusion, both for studying
the relationship between stress and seismic anisotropy and to improve our understanding of the
dynamics of dyke propagation more generally. The ongoing eruption on Reykjanes Peninsula,
Iceland, goes even further, with an exceptionally dense network of instruments recording the dyke
intrusion and eruption on an even finer scale as was achieved in 201415 (gstsdttir et al., 2019,
2016; Sigmundsson et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2019). It has also been shown that there is a strong
relationship between seasonal variations in loading on crustal velocities (Donaldson et al., 2019),
which have been tied to changes in fracture density and changing pore pressures throughout the
yearessentially the same mechanism responsible for the preferential alignment of micro-fractures
in the shallow crust.
The long-term deployment of the Cambridge Iceland network across the Northern Volcanic Zone,
including dense deployments around Askja, Brarbunga, Krafla, and Torfajkull (all central
volcanoes), also presents an opportunity to reappraise seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle
through the analysis of teleseismic shear-wave splitting. Two studies of shear-wave splitting at
2-year, temporary networks spanning Iceland (ICEMELT and HOTSPOT) provided evidence of
some degree of ridge-plume interaction in the upper mantle, but the lateral resolution was limited
by the 50100 km station separations and any transition from vertical to horizontal flow between
the mantle plume and the surrounding mantle could not be resolved. This wealth of datawhich
densely sample the region around the head of the Iceland plume and the spreading ridgemay
provide insights into ridge-plume interactions in the upper mantle, particularly in light of recent
methodological advances in shear-wave splitting tomography (Mondal and Long, 2019, 2020).
6.2 Future directions 99
While the methods used for shear-wave splitting analysis have remained largely unchanged in the
last few decades, such studies still stand to gain from improvements elsewhere in geophysics. For
example, as the field of microearthquake detection and location advances, analysts get access to
far greater catalogues of better located events, which in turn improves the fidelity of shear-wave
splitting studies such as those presented in the preceding chapters. With the gradual establishment
of techniques from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence within geophysics, such
as signal de-noising and probabilistic phase arrival detection (Mousavi et al., 2020; Ross et al.,
2018), the study of seismic anisotropy stands to gain from an appraisal (and, if suitable, inclusion)
of these advances.
And, finally. As discussed in Chapter 4, Askja has for a long time been deflating, subsiding at a
rate of around 2 mm year1 for the past 40 years or so (e.g. de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2012). In
early August, 2021, uplift was detected at a GPS station deployed just to the east of skjuvatn,
within the caldera complex of Askja. As of 17 September 2021, there has been around 10 cm
of uplift, confirmed by recent InSAR acquisitions. There are a number of repeating earthquake
sets that occur within the geothermal region within Askja which, should they continue during the
inflation period, would make an ideal dataset to investigate how the crust responds, if at all, to this
transition from deflation to inflation. I am excited to see how it develops.

Northern Borneo
Chapter 7
Introduction to northern Borneo
In this chapter, I describe the tectonic setting of Southeast Asia, with a focus on Sabah, northern
Borneo. One of the principal aims of the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) is to
better understand the tectonic evolution of Sabah during the Neogene and Quaternary through the
use of seismic imaging techniques, and assess the validity of various models that have been put
forward to explain its post-subduction setting.
I am particularly grateful to Professor Felix Tongkul from the Universiti Malaysia Sabah, whose
conversations on the road in Sabah were as entertaining as they were informative.
7.1 Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia presents one of the finest natural laboratories in which to study the processes of
plate tectonics, having evolved through various phases of continental accretion, orogeny, and rifting.
In particular, the geophysical consequences of subductionthe process by which old lithosphere is
recycled at a convergent boundary between two tectonic platesare well-recorded throughout the
region. The collision of the Indo-Australian, Pacific, and Philippines Sea plates with the Eurasian
plate has created a near-continuous ring of subduction zones around the entire region, from the
Philippines in the north-east, through the Banda, Java, and Sumatra arcs, to Myanmar in the north-
west. These active plate margins exhibit all of the common subduction zone featuresshallow
to deep seismicity, well-developed Benioff-Wadati zones, trenches, accretionary complexes, and
volcanic arcs. Much of present-day Southeast Asia is composed of thousands of islands surrounded
by shallow shelf seas, with water depths of 200 m or less. The western region, from Myanmar to
western Borneo, is underlain by a pre-Cenozoic continental core known as the Sundaland block.
GPS data suggest that this block is moving relatively slowly with respect to the Eurasian plate
(Simons et al., 2007), leading some to advocate that it is a southern appendage of the Eurasian
plate welded to, and sandwiched between, India and South China (Madon et al., 1999). In contrast,
eastern Southeast Asia is geologically younger, evolving during the Cenozoic, and more oceanic in
104 Introduction to northern Borneo
character. The landmass is dominated by an amalgamation of accreted island-arcs interdispersed
with numerous microcontinental blocks of diverse origins and obducted ophiolites.
Some of the notable islands are New Guinea, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Java, Luzon, Mindanao, and
Borneo. Borneo, situated in the geographical centre of Southeast Asia, is the third-largest island
in the world, famed for its ancient rainforest and incredibly diverse flora and fauna. Political
governance of the island is divided between three sovereign nations: Indonesia, which controls
much of southern Borneo (where the island is known as Kalimantan); Brunei, a small nation on the
northern coast; and Malaysia. The Malaysian region of Borneo is divided into two statesSarawak
to the north-west, and Sabah to the north-east. To the north of Borneo lies the South China Sea,
which opened during the Eocene with the rifting of the Dangerous Grounds from southern China,
with extension and seafloor spreading forming the deep V-shaped basin from around 30 Ma, before
terminating in the Early Miocene (Hall, 1997). To the west, south-west, and south lie shallow
continental shelf areas that were subaerial during the Pleistocene glaciation, connecting Borneo
to mainland Southeast Asia (e.g. Voris, 2000). In the south-east, the Makassar Strait separates
Borneo from Sulawesi. To the east and north-east lie two oceanic basinsthe Celebes and Sulu
Seas, respectively. The Sulu Sea is a small, elongated basin, 650 km long and 400 km wide,
bisected by the Cagayan Ridge. Hall (2013) proposed that northward subduction of the Celebes
Sea initiated formation of the Sulu Sea backarc basin, followed by subduction rollback to the
south-east. Details of the tectonic evolution of northern Borneo, Sabah in particular, through the
Neogene and Quaternary is subject to much debate, with both extensional and compressional
regimes being proposed as the primary mechanisms responsible for the major geomorphological
features (e.g. Cullen, 2010; Hall, 2013; Hesse et al., 2009; Morley, 2007). Emerging evidence
from geochronology has tipped the balance in favour of extension dominating the formation and
support of many of the landforms observed across northern Borneo (Lai et al., 2021; Pilia et al.,
2021a; Tsikouras et al., 2021). However, much work is still needed to refine our understanding
of the tectonic history of the region, with a clear dearth of geophysical imaging work in on-shore
regions compared to other parts of Southeast Asia. In the rest of this chapter I explore the current
state of our knowledge and understanding of the region and provide an overview of the principal
geomorphological and tectonic features whose origins are yet to be satisfactorily explained. In
particular, I seek to try provide seismic evidence to the debate on the debate as to whether Sabahs
recent tectonic history has been dominated by extensional or compressional tectonic forces, by
exploring the anisotropic properties of the upper mantle beneath northern Borneo. It is thought that
the lithosphere can record significant information on the tectonic history of a region in the form of
fabric. Measuring this fabric, and supplementing these results with a small scale case study on the
present-day seismic activity, should provide significant evidence, one way or the other.

106 Introduction to northern Borneo
7.2 Tectonic evolution of Sabah
Sabah is one of the two Malaysian states that occupy the northern part of Borneo (the other be-
ing Sarawak) and is situated in a relatively aseismic region near the north-eastern edge of the
present-day Sundaland block in Southeast Asia. This block, bounded by the incredibly active
Sunda and Philippines subduction zones, is moving slowly with respect to the Eurasian plate
(Simons et al., 1999). Like much of eastern Borneo, Sabah was accreted onto the eastern margin
of Mesozoic Sundaland during the Late Cretaceous to Early Miocene (Hall, 2009). During the
Paleogene, the proto-South China Sea was subducted beneath the north-west continental margin
of northern Borneo, terminating in the Early Miocene with the collision of the extended South
China continental margin crust/North Palawan block with the active continental margin of Sabah
and the Cagayan Arc (Hall, 1996, 2013; Hall and Wilson, 2000; Hinz et al., 1994; Hutchison et al.,
2000; Rangin et al., 1990; Tan and Lamy, 1990). At this time, most of Sabah was underwater, as
evidenced by the extensive marine sediments and turbidites that dominate much of the surface
geology (see Figure 7.2). Mountain building along this active continent-continent margin led to the
emergence of the Crocker and Trusmadi Ranges, which was followed by a rapid period of uplift.
Subsequent subsidence and weathering fed many of the sedimentary basins that now surround
Sabah, including what would later become the Maliau Basin and other circular basins of Sabah.
Spreading of the Sulu Sea, north-east of Sabah, is believed to have been initiated by the northward
subduction of the Celebes Sea from the Early Miocene, as indicated by calc-alkaline volcanism in
the Dent and Semporna peninsulas (Bergman et al., 2000). It is believed that trench retreat, driven
by slab rollback beneath the Celebes Sea, has induced significant extension across northern Borneo
(Hall, 2013), with recent chronological dating of peridotites from around Telupid, in central Sabah,
suggesting that the spreading of the Sulu Sea likely extended through what is now Sandakan Bay
onshore to central Sabah (Tsikouras et al., 2021). Subduction of the Celebes Sea is thought to
have terminated at 9 Ma, based on depletion of arc magmatism, which transitioned to intra-plate
volcanism bearing the signature of passive decompression upwelling of the underlying mantle (Lai
et al., 2021).
After the termination of both phases of subduction, the granite laccolith that forms Mount Kinabalu
was emplaced in a north-westsouth-east extensional setting, before being rapidly uplifted and
exhumed (Cottam et al., 2010, 2013). This is further discussed in Section 7.2.3. The exact timing
and rates of both subsidence and uplift across northern Borneo remain unknown, though several
lines of evidence suggest Neogene (232.5 Ma) uplift of 0.3 mm/year for western Sabah (Morley
and Back, 2008), and subsidence (possibly starting at 14 Ma) followed by rapid uplift in eastern
Sabah, making it fully emergent in the early Pliocene.
Figure 7.3 shows a rough timeline of the major tectonic events that have contributed to the formation
and evolution of Sabah. The timings of the events in this timeline are not definitive; in fact whether

references therein.
or not a number of elements occurred (and if so, the mechanism responsible) are still debated. In
the following sections, I discuss some of the major events and geomorphological features found in
the region.
7.2.1 Offshore north-west Sabah
The region of the South China Sea offshore of Sabah is characterised by a deep linear trough,
commonly known as the North-West Borneo Trough (Hutchison, 2010). Other names have included
the Palawan Trough (Hamilton, 1979), the North Borneo Trough (Clift et al., 2008), or simply the
Sabah Trough (Madon et al., 1999). With an average width of 80 km, it extends from Philippines
waters in the north-east, along the north-west coast of Sabah and into the waters offshore of Brunei
Darussalam and eastern Sarawak. The trough was first interpreted as an extinct convergent plate
margin (former trench) between the extended South China Sea continental margin (the Dangerous
Grounds) and onshore Sabah (Hamilton, 1979). Indeed, seismic lines, provided by PETRONAS
(and other oil companies) and from data acquired during Malaysian Law of the Sea investigations,
perpendicular to the Borneo margin show that the trough and fold-and-thrust belt resemble a
subduction trench and accretionary complex (Hutchison, 2010). There is little doubt that the
proto-South China Sea did subduct in this region prior to 20 Ma, yet there is no seismicity
associated with any would-be subducting slab, a ubiquitous feature of subduction zones around the
world. Since then, the accretionary prism model proposed by Hamilton (1979) has been challenged,
with the trough and belt instead being interpreted as a result of rapid and young uplift and extension
7.2 Tectonic evolution of Sabah 109
onland, balanced offshore by compression and subsidence (Hall, 2013). Hall (2013) goes on to
interpret the trough as a flexural depression due to loading by the fold-and-thrust belt onto the
thinned continental crust of the Dangerous Grounds to the north-west of the trough.
7.2.2 The Western Cordillera
The Western Cordillera is an orogenic belt that encompasses a number of ranges, including the
Meligan and Witti ranges in south-western Sabah, and the Crocker and Trusmadi Ranges that run
parallel to the north-west coastline, with an average elevation of 1500 m. The Early Miocene
collision of the extended South China Sea continental margin (the Dangerous Grounds) with
onshore Sabah resulted in the termination of the southward-directed subduction of the proto-South
China Sea (Hall, 2013). At about the same time there was deformation and uplift of the Crocker
and Trusmadi Group sediments on Sabah, yet much of the elevation of the orogenic belt results
from Neogene deformation post-dating the Early Miocene collision (Hall, 2013). The question
of what was responsible for this later deformation and uplift has been the subject of much debate,
with authors proposing solutions based on both compressional (Cullen, 2010; Hesse et al., 2009;
Morley, 2007) and extensional (Hall, 2013) tectonic regimes. The northern end of the Crocker
Range is terminated by Gunung (Mount) Kinabalu, an imposing mass of granite with a height of
4100 m, significantly taller than the next highest peak in Sabah (Gunung Trusmadi, 2642 m).
Fig. 7.4 Mount Kinabalu as seen from park headquarters. The transition from forest cover to bare
granite is visible on the flanks.
110 Introduction to northern Borneo
7.2.3 Mount Kinabalu
Mount Kinabalu (Figure 7.4), located at the northern terminus of the Crocker Range, is a c. 4100
m high mountain formed by the Kinabalu laccolith, a granitic body that was intruded into the
deformed rocks of the Crocker Range. High-precision U-Pb dating suggests the granite is a sheeted
laccolith-like body comprising dyke-fed granitic units which crystallised between 8 and 7 Ma
(Cottam et al., 2010) and young downwards. Geobarometry of amphibole samples suggests an
emplacement depth of between 3 and 10 km (Vogt and Flower, 1989). This range is independently
supported by thermochronological analyses of 40Ar/39Ar in biotite and Zircon/Apatite fission-track
dating, which put the emplacement depth to be between 7 and 12 km (Cottam et al., 2013). Cottam
et al. (2013) also went on to interpret the Zircon/Apatite fission-track ages to reflect rapid cooling
due to exhumation, regional uplift, and erosion, estimating an average exhumation rate of c. 7.1 km
Ma1. It is noted, however, that this rate does not factor in advection or topographic deflection, and
thus reflects the extreme upper end of the likely range. The exact source of the melt that formed
this intrusion remains unknown, though there is evidence to suggest a continental source (Cottam
et al., 2010), pointing towards thickening of the crust from the Dangerous Grounds underthrusting
as a potential mechanism for, and origin of, the melt.
Earthquakes related to a network of faults around the Kinabalu massif are studied in detail for the
first time, with the results presented in Chapter 10. Understanding the relationship between these
earthquakes and the emplacement, uplift, and exhumation of the Kinabalu pluton may provide
additional evidence for the tectonic stress regime in Sabah, as well as representing a significant
advance in the understanding of seismic hazard in the region.
7.2.4 Circular basins
A number of sub-circular sedimentary basins can be found across Central and Southeast Sabah,
the most notable of which is the Maliau Basin, which hosts a protected ecological region of
virgin rainforest. The precise geological mechanism responsible for the shape and existence
of these unique features is, however, poorly understood, though they show characteristics of
tectonic, sedimentary, and diapiric origin. Believed to have formed in the Early Miocene (Clennell,
1991), they were uplifted in the Late Early Miocene and shallow water sediments were deposited
unconformably on the pre-Neogene rocks which are more intensely deformed (Balaguru et al.,
2003; Tongkul, 1993). The Neogene sediments are mostly shallow marine to fluvio-deltaic and
contain beds of coal. The northern rim of the Maliau Basin reaches a height of almost 2 km a.s.l.
(see Figure 7.5). Balaguru et al. (2003) proposed that the Tidung, Malibau, and Maliau basins
are the remnants of a single large basin modified by post-depositional deformation and enhanced
by erosion into near-circular to elliptical structures, suggesting that these remnant outliers are
structurally controlled large synclines. Transpressional movement since the Late Pliocene has
7.2 Tectonic evolution of Sabah 111
caused major structural inversion and uplift, with renewed extension during the Plio-Pleistocene
causing sequence repetition, modifying and widening the original synclines.
Similar structures can be observed in the offshore eastern Sabah area (Clennell, 1996), onshore
Brunei (Morley et al., 1998), and in the Kutai Basin of Kalimantan (Chambers and Daley, 1997).
The formation of the sedimentary basins of the Sundaland Block are discussed at length in Hall
and Morley (2004).

112 Introduction to northern Borneo
7.3 Seismicity of Sabah
Sabah, in comparison to much of Southeast Asia, is a seismically quiet region. However, this does
not mean it is devoid of seismic hazardin fact, it is the most seismically hazardous region in
Malaysia. The bulk of this seismicity occurs in two regions: in the north-west, around the Mount
Kinabalu massif; and in the southeast, around the Darvel Bay area. While the region has seen some
fault mapping (Tongkul, 2017), the vegetation and climate makes it difficult to constrain the faults
that are responsible for this seismicity, which makes the interpretation of seismic data even more
critical. Focal mechanisms provide a means of classifying the tectonic regime (e.g. extensional) in
which they occur. Bar the rare occurrence of earthquakes with MW > 5.0, seismicity in the region
is poorly documented. The installation of a number of new, permanent seismic stations in the
aftermath of the 2015 Ranau earthquake has improved this situation, but work remains to be done.

below, are outlined by the black boxes.

network is shown on the y-axis as a function of the distance between the station location and the
earthquake epicentre reported in the ISC-GEM catalogue. Panels a and b show the recordings on
the Z (vertical) and North (horizontal) components, respectively.
Ranau
In 2015, the Ranau area was hit by a MW 6.0 earthquake that caused the loss of 18 lives on Mount
Kinabalu as well as significant damage to infrastructure in and around Ranau. This earthquake
resulted from the rupture of a north-west-dipping normal fault that did not breach the surface
(Wang et al., 2017). A subsequent MW 5.2 earthquake occurred on 8 March 2018, coinciding with
the first day an instrument in the nBOSS network was deployed. Efforts to quantify the seismic
hazard posed by this fault (or faults) is of vital importance for the mitigation of the impacts of
future earthquakes in the region. This area is explored in detail in Chapter 10.
Darvel Bay
The Darvel Bay area is relatively active, with earthquakes occurring throughout the bay, which
appear to correspond with faults that have been mapped onshore Tongkul (2017). These faults are
thought to accommodate transpressional deformation propagating from Sulawesi to the south-east
(Balaguru and Hall, 2008), but seismicity in this region is yet to be investigated in detail.
114 Introduction to northern Borneo
Deep seismicity
One of the more intriguing observations for northern Borneo is the dearth of deep seismicity,
despite the suggestion that lithosphere has been subducted beneath the region from both the proto-
South China Sea and the Celebes Sea. Subduction zones around the world are characterised by
seismicity that occurs within the down-going slab, reaching depths of over 600 km. The absence of
any equivalent seismicity may help inform the debate about what mechanism is responsible for
generating such deep-focus earthquakes.
On 3 August 2019, a single event at 670 km beneath north-east Sabah appeared in a number
of bulletins, including MetMalaysias and the ISC bulletin. The veracity of this event has been
subsequently confirmed by ISC. Another event occurred on 30 June 2020 off the north-west of
Sabah, unfortunately after the nBOSS network had been recovered. The epicentres of these two
earthquakes are shown as the white stars in Figure 7.6. The waveforms recorded across the nBOSS
network for the 2019 event are shown in Figure 7.7, in which the P and S phase arrivals are clearly
visible. The near-uniform P arrival times suggest the source is indeed directly beneath the network,
and the SP arrival time difference is also of the right order to suggest a source depth > 600
km. A valuable piece of future work would be to use these events as templates to seek more deep
earthquakes beneath Sabah. The presence of these events at such a depth, with no intermediate
seismicity, presents a challenging conundrum, the solution to which may inform us on both the
mantle beneath Sabah and deep seismicity in general. Similarly enigmatic earthquakes have been
observed in the region beneath the Betic orogen in southern Spain, which have been attributed to
the existence of a detached block of lithospheric material, sufficiently cold to generate earthquakes,
that has sunk to a depth of > 600 km (Buforn et al., 2011; Hodgson and Cock, 1956). A number of
similarities in the tectonic settings of these two regions suggests that one may inform on the other,
and vice versa.
7.4 Seismic tomography of the upper mantle beneath Sabah
Seismic tomography provides a means of imaging the Earths interior using waveform data recorded
at the surface. Most commonly, this involves the inversion of seismic phase traveltimes for 2-D or
3-D structures (e.g. Rawlinson et al., 2010). The mantle contains a record of subduction that can be
directly imaged using seismic body wave tomography, because the subducted lithosphere is cooler
than the surrounding mantle and appears as regions of relatively high seismic velocity. Interpreting
tectonic history from seismic tomography is not straightforward, even for the upper mantle, and
even if subduction is the dominant process. Velocity anomalies at the same depth may correspond
to the subduction of lithosphere of different ages at different rates, subduction oblique to the trench,
or slabs may deform during subduction. Furthermore, we cannot exclude seismic heterogeneities
resulting from other processes and some anomalies may simply reflect artefacts in the tomographic
7.4 Seismic tomography of the upper mantle beneath Sabah 115
imaging (Hall and Spakman, 2015).
A number of regional tomographic models show a high-velocity anomaly beneath northern Borneo
(Amaru, 2007; Hall and Spakman, 2015; Zenonos et al., 2019), though it has been suggested that
dVs (km/s)

Fig. 7.8 Existing tomographic models for Southeast Asia consistently show a high-velocity anomaly
at 200 km beneath northern Borneo, though it has been suggested that it may be an artefact of the
historically poor data coverage (Hall and Spakman, 2015). Panel a is a slice through the S-wave
tomographic model of Zenonos et al. (2019) at 200 km depth. Panel b is another slice through the
P-wave UU-P07 model (Amaru, 2007), as presented in Hall and Spakman (2015). High-velocity
anomalies clearly delineate material subducted in the Indonesian and Philippines subduction zones
in both models.
116 Introduction to northern Borneo
this is simply an artefact of the relatively poor data coverage in the region. The resolution tests
performed by Zenonos et al. (2019), however, suggest that such an anomaly could be recovered.
Considering the possibility that the anomaly is real, Hall and Spakman (2015) propose it may be
remnant slab material from either the northward subduction of the Celebes Sea, or the southward
subduction of the proto-South China Sea. One aim of the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey
(nBOSS) project was to fill this data gap and produce a high-resolution traveltime tomography
model for northern Borneo. It is hoped that this model will elucidate whether this high-velocity
anomaly is a genuine feature in the mantle and, if so, what it represents. Initial chequerboard
recovery tests based on the nBOSS network configuration suggest that velocity anomalies are well
recovered down to 350 km depth (Pilia et al., 2021a). Since the high velocity anomaly seen
in regional tomographic studies does not exceed 300 km depth, it is expected that a teleseismic
tomography model will image it in full with an 810 times improvement in resolution.
Understanding the structure of the mantle beneath Sabah is an important step in developing models
to explain observations of shear-wave splitting of teleseismic, core-refracted phases because, as
discussed in Chapters 2 and 9, these phases are sensitive to anisotropyand thus structures,
including downwelling lithospheric materialbetween the core-mantle boundary and the surface.
Chapter 8
The northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic
Survey
In this chapter I detail the deployment of the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS)
network, its servicing and recovery, and the post-processing of the recovered waveform data (in-
cluding a detailed summary of the various issues encountered along the way). This information
regarding the field practicalities and data collection are recorded here for posterity. A great deal
was learnt about what to do and what not to do when operating a seismic network in the challenging
tropical climate of Sabah, which differs in a number of ways from the challenges faced in Iceland.
We also had to deal with a number of (un)expected complications that arose due to instrument
faults, animals, and integer overflow.
This chapter represents an effort to bring together and consolidate all the information regarding
the nBOSS deployment, which has not been done before. I have invested a considerable amount
of time and effort into the preparation and deployment of the nBOSS seismometers, including
testing them before deployment. Once the network had been dismantled, it was my responsibility
to extract, process, and archive the recorded waveform data.
8.1 The nBOSS network
The nBOSS network, comprising 46 seismometers, was initially configured in a regular grid,
alternating chequerboard-style between the two instrument models in the poolthe 3ESPCD
and the 6TD, both of which are manufactured by Gralp Systems Ltd (see Section 8.2 for a full
description of these instruments). With the assistance of collaborators at Universiti Malaysia Sabah,
a list of potential sites (situated as close as possible to the proposed configuration) were identified,
with field reconnaissance carried out in May and August of 2017. The instruments were deployed
over the course of 3 weeks in March 2018, starting in Kota Kinabalu on the north-west coast and
118 The northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey
proceeding in a roughly clockwise fashion around the state. The final configuration, shown in
Figure 8.1, had an average station separation of 37.5 km (Figure 8.2). The first service took place
in August 2018, with the primary aim being to address any issues with the site design that may
have arisen in the first few months, in order to maximise the overall data recovery. A second
service took place in March 2019, the aim again being to ensure the rainy season had not caused
any additional problems with the sites. The instruments were then left until they were recovered in
January 2020. Some of the common issues encountered during the course of the deployment are
detailed in Section 8.4.

The instruments were deployed in a variety of locations, though most commonly on palm oil
plantations and in schools. In choosing these sites, there was a trade-off between field practicalities
whether or not a site could be accessedand the amount of potential anthropogenic noise, with
instrument safety also being an important factor. The eastern lowlands host the highest concentration

of industrial palm oil plantations in Sabah; while a boon for us in terms of identifying suitable (and
accessible) deployment sites, they also exhibit a much greater degree of anthropogenic noise.
Maliau Basin
The Maliau Basin, as described in the previous chapter (see Figure 7.5), is a striking topographic
feature located in southern-central Sabah. This conservation area is home to a range of pristine
and ancient biomes. In 2011, the Maliau Basin Studies Centre was opened to serve as a base
for naturalists and biologists. Two instruments were deployed at existing weather stations in and
around the Maliau Basin: one (a 3ESPCD) just outside the studies centre, outwith the basin proper;
and the other (a 6TD) several kilometres into the basin. This latter instrument was hiked up the
outer rim of the basin and deployed near the Nepenthes camp. The circular basins of northern
Borneo remain little understood, with most research focussing on their geological structure from
outcrop studies (Balaguru et al., 2003; Tjia et al., 1990; Tongkul and Chang, 2003). These two
stations present an opportunity to understand more about the structure of the Maliau Basin using
seismic techniques, such as receiver function analysis, though this has not been explored in this
dissertation.
Mount Kinabalu
The Kinabalu Park, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, is home to the stunning
Mount (Gunung) Kinabalu. The mountain, situated at the northern terminus of the Crocker range,
towers over 4000 m above the north-west coast of Sabah, making it the highest point on Borneo.
120 The northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey
The national park authorities operate a hiking trail up the heavily forested sides of the mountain and
across the exposed granite to the summit. In 2015, a MW 6.0 earthquake struck the region around
the park, causing rockfall and landslides that sadly led to the deaths of 18 climbers and guides on
the mountain. With assistance from the park authorities, an instrument (a 6TD) was deployed on
the mountain, just outside the Laban Rata resthouse at 3200 m, in March 2018. On our return to
Sabah in the summer of 2018, the instrument was configured to telemeter data down to a computer
in the main office of the park headquarters, where a livestream of the waveforms could be shown.
This was accompanied by a poster display giving a summary of what an earthquake is and why
they might be occurring in the region. It was while setting up this system that I noticed a number
of signals that appeared to indicate microseismic activity in the region, which led me to getting
involved with the QuakeMigrate project and producing the work discussed in Chapter 10. As it
stands, the instrument will remain on the mountain until 2024.
8.2 Instruments
The instrument pool contained a total of 47 instruments: 29 Gralp 6TDs (of which 20 belonged
to the University of Cambridge and 9 to the University of Aberdeen); and 18 Gralp 3ESPCDs
(8 Cambridge and 10 on loan from SEIS-UK). SEIS-UK is the seismic arm of the Natural Envi-
ronmental Research Council (NERC) Geophysical Equipment Facility, based at the University of
Leicester. It also provided software for extracting the data from the instruments and processing
it into an archivable state, as well as being on call to provide their exceptional knowledge and
trouble-shooting assistance throughout the deployment. This instrument pool was supplemented by
the provision of continuous data from the permanent monitoring network operated by MetMalaysia.
This network consists primarily of Streckeisen STS-2.5s, with the two older sites (KKM and LDM)
housing its predecessor, the Streckeisen STS-2. In some cases, a strong motion instrument is also
co-deployed to record ground acceleration at these permanent stations.
Gralp 6TD
A total of 28 Gralp 6TDs, with 16 GB of on-board flash memory, were used in the nBOSS network.
The 6TD is a three-component, broadband instrument with an integrated 24-bit digitiser, with a
response range of 30 seconds to 100 Hz. The CD24 digitiser natively samples at 2000 Hz, though
the recorded sampling rate can be controlled through a series of taps (Finite Impulse Response
filters). Ground velocity was sampled at 50 Hz (resulting in a Nyquist frequency of 25 Hz), which
would allow data from the entire 22-month deployment period to fit into the on-board storage.
These units have a low power consumption (<1W) and are built to be durable and easy to use. The
masses do not need to be locked when the instrument is in transit and the overall weight of the unit
made them ideal for the more remote deployments (such as the instruments in the Maliau Basin
and on Mount Kinabalu, which had to be hiked in). The trade-off made for these conveniences is a
8.3 Site design 121
higher degree of internal instrument noise, making the true sensitivity closer to 10 seconds than the
quoted 30 seconds. This is illustrated in panel a of Figure 8.3, which shows the probabilistic power
spectral density of the 6TD at SBA9.
Gralp 3ESPCD
A total of 18 Gralp 3ESPCDs, again with 16 GB of on-board flash memory, were used in the
nBOSS network. The 3ESPCD is also a three-component, broadband instrument with an integrated
24-bit digitiser, though it is more sensitive to longer periods than the 6TD, with a nominal response
range of 60 seconds to 100 Hz. This comes at the cost of more delicate masses (or, more specifically,
more delicate pivots to which the masses are attached) and as such they must be locked/unlocked
when being transported/deployed. In addition to this, the instrument is more sensitive to tilt, which
meant extra care had to be taken to ensure the ground was well-compacted and the plinth well set
before deployment. However, the improved sensitivity makes a marked difference in the quality of
recordings of the long period signals typical of teleseismic phase arrivals. The internal noise levels
are much lower compared to the 6TD, resulting in a true upper response limit much closer to the
nominal 60 seconds (Figure 8.3).
Streckeisen STS-2/2.5
The Streckeisen STS-2, often used for permanent vault deployments by monitoring agencies, is the
gold standard for seismic instrumentation. The STS-2 model was superseded by the STS-2.5 after
the former was discontinued in 2010, though they are in effect identical. It is a three-component,
broadband instrument that requires a separate digitiser, with a nominal response range of 120
seconds to 50 Hz. Despite being capable of recording at sampling rates in excess of 100 Hz, the
instruments only telemeter data to the MetMalaysia data centre at 20 Hz, which limits the upper
bound on the frequency of seismic energy that can be reliably recorded to below 10 Hz. The data
from these instruments were provided to us in miniSEED format, having been archived using the
SeisComp3 software. I checked the data timestamping and station metadata before cutting the
waveform data into 24 hour chunks and archiving it locally alongside the nBOSS data.
8.3 Site design
Each deployment site consisted of: a seismometer, typically buried between 0.5 - 1 m below the
surface; a GPS antenna, deployed with a good view of the sky; a breakout box that sat at the
surface, through which we could communicate with the instrument and deliver it power; and a
power system, composed of a 12 V car battery, a 50 W solar panel, a solar regulator, and a metal
frame and box to which the system was mounted. These sites had a small footprint and could be

8.3 Site design 123
deployed rapidly (< 1 hour). Example site photographs are shown in Figure 8.4.
The ground at the majority of sites was composed of a thick clay which, once the instrument was
buried, provided a solid coupling between the instrument and the subsurface. To further improve
this coupling, (where possible) a pre-prepared concrete plinth was set into fresh cement at the
bottom of the hole, taking care to ensure that the plinth remained level as the cement set. The
instrument was then deployed onto the plinth, levelled, and tested, before finally capping the
hole with an upturned plastic bin. The idea behind this was to form a diving bell, which would
minimise the amount of water that could reach the instrument, even during the rainy season when
the ground could be completely waterlogged. All instruments were deployed inside plastic bags as
an additional measure to protect them from water, dirt, and animals. A small number of stations
had to be deployed using a direct burial method, usually because the ground conditions precluded
digging a hole deep enough to use the deployment method described above. Instead of being
deployed on a plinth and covered with a bucket, they were simply placed directly in the ground
(inside a plastic bag) and earth was packed in directly around them. This can have the benefit of
giving fantastic instrument-ground coupling, but was only really an option for the 6TDs, which are
more robust to tilt.
We employed a range of precautions to protect the sites from damage:
 Especially vulnerable and/or exposed sites were encased in a metal cage, preventing access
to the panel/battery box
 Cables were sealed inside sections of plastic hosing to discourage curious critters from
chewing through them
 The instrument and breakout box were covering with plastic buckets to protect from the
elements (and animals)
 Batteries were locked inside a metal box, elevated above the ground on a metal frame
Prior to burial (and after the masses on the 3ESPCDs had been unlocked), the mass streams were
viewed and a stomp test was performed to make sure they had all unlocked and were behaving as
expected. The FireWire cable was tested by downloading (flushing) a small sample of the data
recorded during the deploymentthis also had the added benefit of setting the pointer demarcating
the data recorded since the last flush. Details, such as the GPS, sensor, and digitiser serial numbers,
the time of arrival, and the weather conditions (and more) were all recorded in detail on deployment
sheets, which were scanned and archived (both physically and digitally) on return to Cambridge.
Additional comments, such as potential noise sources (e.g. a nearby road), were recorded and are a
good place to start when first getting familiar with the dataset.

8.4 Common issues 125
At a number of sites, a cage was set up around the deployed instrument and solar panel stand in
order to protect it from wildlife and curious passersby. For the most part, these did a good job,
though at a handful of sites (such as SBA4) the cages were filled with plant matter that had shot up
and covered the solar panel in the time between the deployment and the services, causing some
minor power issues.
8.4 Common issues
Despite our best efforts, no deployment is perfect, especially when having to simultaneously protect
each site against animals, humans, and, of course, the excessive heat, humidity, and rainfall of the
tropical environment. In spite of all the protections built into the site design (as detailed in 8.3),
we did not achieve perfect data recoverynonetheless, the final data recovery of > 97% is very
impressive.
8.4.1 A faulty batch...
As noted in 8.2, the masses in the Gralp 3ESPCD instruments are particularly delicate. So much
so that they must be locked when being transported and only unlocked once the instrument has
been deployed. For the batch of 3ESPCDs purchased by the University of Cambridge (a total of 8
instruments), the mass lock/unlock mechanism appeared to be faulty, which made the process of
locking and unlocking the instrument very frustrating. During the deployment, we were able to
eventually get each instrument to unlock (often after sending multiple lock/unlock commands and
turning the instrument off and on again). For the most part, once unlocked these instruments worked
well and there are no issues with the recorded data. However, it was also observed that should the
3ESPCDs automatic re-centring function be triggered, the instrument could end up caught in a loop
that at times took up to a week to resolve itself. The instrument would send a re-centre command
to the mass control system, which would attempt to sweep the masses across the full range of
positions before centring them. Should the initial request fail, the instrument would try again every
20 minutes until the process terminated successfully. Data recorded during this time was unlikely
to be suitable for use in any seismic data processing. For those instruments affected, full details
are available in the instrument quality control reports, which have been archived alongside the
deployment, recovery, and retrieval sheets.
8.4.2 The 2019 GPS week number rollover
The GPS Week Number Rollover (WNR) is a phenomenon that occurs every 210 (1024) weeks, or
roughly once every 19.6 years, when the 10-bit week counter (for the NAV Navigation Message)
rolls over from 1111111111 back to 0000000000. Any software receiving the broadcast GPS
datetime not configured to handle the WNR event may be adversely affected, which, in the case of
126 The northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey
seismic data timestamping, presents a considerable problem. It just so happened this was due to
happen at midnight (UTC) between 67 April 2019, right in the middle of the nBOSS deployment1.
Despite initial assurances to the contrary, older models of GPS antennas (specifically those contain-
ing the Trimble Lassen iQ and SQ modules) would indeed be affected by the WNR event. Internally,
these modules had set the 0th week (i.e. the pivot week) to a date after the true rollover date (28
August 1999)13 December 1999 (SQ) and 13 October 2001, (iQ)which would mean, unless
replaced, that the antennas would fail in July 2019 and May 2021, respectively. Due to the military
origin and nature of the Global Positioning System, it was not possible to conduct trials of how the
WNR would impact the instruments. As only a small number of instruments were affected (5 total -
A2, A4, B4, D1, and D2), the decision was taken to leave the antennas in place and hope for the best.
When the instruments were recovered in January 2020, it was noted that some of the potentially
affected sites had completely reset to the factory settings, losing their system IDs as well as the
pointer to the last flush. It was determined this was a result of an obscure part of the CD24 firmware,
believed to help facilitate manufacturing. A completely uninitialised CD24 will boot up with a
clock reading 01/01/2000, which is used as a signal to the firmware to set all configuration settings
to a sensible default condition. It was also not possible to get a GPS fix, which did not bode well for
our hopes of recovering well-timestamped data. However, the amount of data extracted did indicate
that the instruments had continued to record beyond the July rollover date. Back in Cambridge, the
data were extracted from the instruments and processed. As expected (or at least hoped), the data up
until the rollover date were all present and correct. For a 20 day window following the rollover the
instruments continued to operate as usual, synchronised to the Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) signal from
the antenna and the unusual dates in 1999 were ignored. So long as instrument and antenna were
continuously powered, there would be no issues. If, however, power had been lost, the digitiser
would have begun to refuse the timestamps. Fortunately, all instruments remained continuously
powered and the GPS was set to continuous power mode. On 17 August 2019, (corresponding
to 1 January 2000 in rollover time), the digitiser would no longer see the timestamps as "weird"
and resynchronise. After this date, so long as the instrument did not lose power, the data would
continue to be timestamped and could be corrected by simply adding on the missing 1024 weeks.
1Rollover dates are hereafter designated by the second date, e.g. 67 April 2019  7 April 2019.
8.5 Data processing 127
8.5 Data processing
The data recorded by the instruments were flushed in the field to LaCie drives, which were trans-
ported back to Cambridge for quality control (QC) and archiving on the Bullard data servers. The
data were archived after each service trip, but in the interests of a single, uniformly processed
archive, I re-extracted and processed all 22 months of data in one go after the network had been
decommissioned. The extracted waveform data were stored in the Gralp Compressed Format
(GCF), which contains information in file headers that can be used to identify corrupted data chunks.
Any process that involves the transmission of digital data, particularly one that needs to operate
at low power, is prone to communication errors, which would commonly manifest as corrupted
metadata in the header. Thankfully, data are stored in 10 second blocks and the occurrence rate of
these communication errors is low. With these corrupted blocks removed, the GCF files were con-
verted to miniSEED files using tools provided by Gralp and SEIS-UK. Along with the waveform
data, we can extract streams containing the mass positions, useful for tracking instrument tilt and,
for the 3ESPCDs, the occurrence of automatic re-centrings and log files recording the State of
Health (SOH) of the instrument. These log files detail much useful information on the instrument,
including the GPS offset (the difference between the internal clock time and the timestamp received
from the GPS antenna) and the time of any GPS syncs that occurred (step-like corrections to the
internal clock based on the GPS-derived timestamp). Taken together, this information can be used
to assess how well the site performed over the deployment period, as well as to identify any periods
of time for which the data should be carefully considered, e.g. if the mass positions exceed the
recommended tolerance.
For each instrument, these log files were plotted and any issues identified were investigated. On
top of this, the waveforms for a selection of regional and teleseismic events across the deployment
period were visually inspected to ensure nothing looked out of the ordinary. A final summary report
was compiled for each site, detailing all issues identified during QC.
Data affected by the issues detailed in Section 8.4.1 were carefully processed and poor data were
removed. Once completed, I used a SEIS-UK tool to ensure that all the header information was
correct, a vital step required to ensure that the data can eventually be uploaded to the IRIS archive.
Finally, a SEED dataless file for the network, which contains general station information such
as location, deployment/retrieval dates, and the instrument channel responses, was generated
using a SEIS-UK tool. The channel responses for each instrument were compiled from the
calibration documentation provided by the manufacturer, Gralp. Together with the data volumes
(the miniSEED files), these make up a complete IRIS SEED volume, which can be transmitted to
the IRIS Data Management Centre (DMC) for permanent archiving.

8.6 Review
Overall, the experiment was a great success, in no small part due to the fantastic knowledge and
expertise of our collaborators in Borneo and at SEIS-UK, as well as the extensive field experience
of those that took part in the field campaigns. The full archived data availabilities for the nBOSS
and MetMalaysia networks have been visualised in Figures 8.5 and 8.6, respectively. A data
recovery rate in excess of 97% was achieved for the nBOSS network, which is a great achievement,
particularly considering the challenges faced over the course of the deployment.
Chapter 9
Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle
beneath northern Borneo
In this chapter, I present the first extensive study of teleseismic shear-wave splitting (SWS) in
northern Borneo. Prior to this work, a small number of SWS measurements had been made at
two stations in Sabah with publicly available data. These two stationsKKM (Kota Kinabalu)
and LDM (Lahad Datu)have been in continuous operation since around 2006. The deployment
of the 46-seismometer strong northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) network in
March 2018 presented an excellent opportunity to explore the anisotropic properties of the man-
tle in this tectonically complex region. A number of new permanent stations were installed by
MetMalaysia in 2017, after the 2015 MW 6.0 Ranau earthquake, supplementing the nBOSS network.
The primary objective of this study was to use observations of the presence and orientation of
seismic anisotropy to validate (or invalidate) the various models that have been proposed for the
dynamic state of the mantle beneath Sabah. It has been suggested that the region has seen two
opposing phases of subduction, both now terminated, in its recent (late Miocene) tectonic history.
Whether this is true, and what impact they may have had on the geomorphology of Sabah, is
still open for debate, but seismic imaging techniques, such as SWS, can help to reconstruct some
of this history. Although there is a large body of work dedicated to the investigation of seismic
anisotropy in active subduction zones, the limited number of post-subduction settings (e.g. the
Betic-Rif orogen) has hindered significant progress in understanding the processes in such areas.
The subducted material of the Celebes and proto-South China Seas, should it exist, appears to be
entirely aseismic at present, which further limits our ability to constrain the depth distribution of
seismic anisotropy (e.g. is it focussed in the mantle below the slab, the slab itself, or the mantle
above the slab?). Instead, the degree of lateral variation in shear-wave splitting measurements is
used to infer the possible depth of the anisotropic layer.
132 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
Waveform data from the permanent network of instruments operated by MetMalaysia, generously
shared with the nBOSS group, has helped to supplement the data from the temporary nBOSS
network. This work has been prepared for submission to Earth and Planetary Science Letters.
9.1 Introduction
Sabah, a state of Malaysia in northern Borneo, is situated near the north-eastern edge of the present-
day Sundaland block, in Southeast Asia. This block, bounded by the seismically active Sunda and
Philippines subduction zones, is the southern extent of the slow-moving (20 mm year1) Eurasian
plate (Argus et al., 2011; Simons et al., 1999). Like much of eastern Borneo, Sabah was accreted
onto the eastern margin of Mesozoic Sundaland between the Late Cretaceous and the Early Miocene
(Hall, 2009). Though it now exhibits the characteristics of an intraplate setting, there is evidence in
the geological record to suggest that it has been host to two opposing subduction systems since
the start of the Neogene, both now terminated. It is widely thought that the proto-South China
Sea was subducted beneath the north-west continental margin of northern Borneocontinuing
north-west along what is now the northern margin of the Sulu Sea basinduring the Paleogene,
before terminating in the Early Miocene with continent-continent collision between the Dangerous
Grounds and the north-western margin of Sabah (Hall, 1996, 2013; Hall and Wilson, 2000; Hutchi-
son et al., 2000; Rangin et al., 1990; Tan and Lamy, 1990). The lithosphere in this region was
probably thickened by underthrusting of the Dangerous Grounds beneath northern Borneo, leading
to the formation of the arcuate Rajang-Crocker orogenic belt that runs down the north-west coast
of Borneo (Hall and Wilson, 2000; Hutchison et al., 2000). This orogenic event was accompanied
by a period of rapid uplift across northern Borneo (Morley and Back, 2008), with erosion of this
newly uplifted surface subsequently feeding the numerous offshore sedimentary basins (Hall and
Morley, 2004; Morley and Back, 2008). At around the same time (21 Ma), the Sulu Sea began to
open, likely due to back-arc spreading driven by slab rollback from the northward subduction of the
Celebes Sea (Hall, 2009). Recent geochemical analyses have indicated that an exposed ophiolitic
complex around Telupid (central Sabah, see Figure 9.1a) bears the signature of oceanic rifting, with
radiometric U-Pb ages dating these basalts to around 9 Ma (Tsikouras et al., 2021). Furthermore,
receiver function analyses have also revealed a degree of thinning in the crust that coincides with
the exposed ophiolite, extending in from the Sulu Sea through the Sandakan bay towards Telupid
(Pilia et al., 2021a). Together, these suggest that the Sulu Sea rifting propagated into what is now
Sabah, but ultimately failed to initiate extensive seafloor spreading. Sabah continued to undergo
extension, possibly up until the Late Miocene, before it was subsequently uplifted in the Late
Miocene to Early Pliocene, becoming fully emerged above sea level by around 5 Ma (Hall, 2013).
The exact cause of this uplift has not yet been clearly identified, but it is likely to be different
between western and eastern Sabah. Possible explanations include slab detachment (Hall, 2013)
or the development of a gravitational instability with subsequent formation of a lithospheric drip
9.1 Introduction 133
(Pilia et al., 2021a) for eastern Sabah, and lithospheric delamination from the thickened region
beneath the Crocker range for western Sabah (Hall, 2013). The emplacement of the Kinabalu
granite, which forms the bulk of the 4100 m tall Mount Kinabalu, has also been dated to the Late
Miocene (between 7 and 8 Ma; Cottam et al., 2010), before it was rapidly exhumed (Cottam et al.,
2013). The subsequent tectonic evolution of Sabah from the late Miocene, and exactly how each
tectonic event since the Neogene is related, remains a puzzle, with published models focussing on
the crust due to limited constraints on mantle structure and dynamics. Consequently, there exist a
number of possible scenarios for variations in the thickness of the lithosphere across Sabah and the
dynamic state of the asthenosphere below. The region has seen little seismic instrumentation, lead-
ing to a lack of constraints on the structure of the mantle and crust from seismic imaging techniques.
The presence of seismic anisotropy, the directional dependence of seismic wavespeeds, has long
been linked to deformational processes within the Earth (Hess, 1964; Silver and Chan, 1988; Vinnik
et al., 1984). Provided there exists a relationship between this deformation and the orientation of the
induced anisotropic fabric, observations of seismic anisotropy can be used to make inferences on
the dynamic state of the mantle (Vinnik et al., 1989), as well as instances of large-scale lithospheric
deformation (Nicolas, 1993; Silver and Chan, 1991). Under finite strain, intrinsically anisotropic
minerals, such as olivine (the primary constituent of the upper mantle), form a preferential align-
ment with respect to the flow geometry. This allows the intrinsic, grain-level anisotropy to manifest
on a macroscopic scale, a phenomenon known as lattice preferred orientation (LPO) anisotropy
(Nicolas and Christensen, 1987; Zhang and Karato, 1995). Under typical mantle conditions, olivine
forms A-type LPO, whereby the a-axis of the olivine crystals are aligned parallel to the mantle flow
direction. It has been shown, however, that when deformation proceeds by dislocation creep, the
resultant LPO is also a function of the physical and chemical conditions (e.g. fluid content, pressure,
and temperature) of deformation, which can complicate the connection between observations of
seismic anisotropy and the inferred state of the mantle (e.g. Jung et al., 2006; Katayama et al., 2004).
Subduction zones, where lithospheric material is recycled into the mantle, are an important part
of the tectonic cycle. The geometry of mantle flow in active subduction zones has primarily been
constrained by measurements of shear-wave splitting in subvertically propagating core-refracted
phases, due to their superior lateral resolution compared to surface wave inversions. It is difficult,
however, to identify the exact depth of the source of any observed anisotropy, because there may
be contributions from different parts of the subduction system, including the overriding lithosphere,
the mantle wedge, the slab itself, and the sub-slab mantle. Local S phases originating within
the slab can provide useful constraints on the depth distribution of anisotropy (Abt et al., 2009;
Bowman and Ando, 1987; Eakin et al., 2015; Fischer and Wiens, 1996; Long and van der Hilst,
2005). However, in the case of Sabah, any remnant lithospheric material in the underlying mantle

Sabah. Panel a shows a map of the surface geology information (Hall, 2013) and geochemical data
(Lai et al., 2021) from the study area (modified after Pilia et al. (2021a)). Inset: Regional setting

appears to be entirely aseismic, perhaps as a result of subduction termination and slab breakoff.
In general, the anisotropy beneath the mantle wedge in active subduction zones appears to be ori-
ented parallel to the trench (e.g. Audoine et al., 2004; Russo and Silver, 1994). In the mantle wedge,
however, it is often a more complex picture, with fast orientations tending to be trench-parallel
close to the trench and rotating to trench-perpendicular in the back-arc of many systems (Fischer
et al., 2000; Karato, 1995).
It has also been suggested that vertical mantle flow, such as that associated with lithospheric down-
wellings, can be inferred from the presence of low delay times and/or null measurements (West
et al., 2009). Vertical flow induces LPO with a vertical axis of symmetry, to which the vertically
travelling core-refracted phases are insensitive. Care must be taken, however, to differentiate
between geometric nulls and true nulls.
In regions undergoing lithospheric shortening, such as northern Tibet, the fast directions of seismic
anisotropy tend to parallel the orogenic belts (e.g. Kaviani et al., 2021; McNamara et al., 1994;
Nicolas, 1993; Silver and Chan, 1988, 1991), likely as a result of the formation of fabric during the
collision that is subsequently frozen into the lithosphere. Observations of shear-wave splitting are
therefore useful for not only decoding modern-day mantle flow geometry, but also constraining the
tectonic history of continental regions (Gilligan et al., 2016; Liddell et al., 2017). One question
that I would like to address in this study is what this might mean for seismic anisotropy in systems
transitioning from the subduction of oceanic lithosphere to continent-continent collisions and then
orogen collapse in a post-subduction environment?
Here I present the first broad-scale study of teleseismic shear-wave splitting at a network of instru-
ments across Sabah, with the goal being to understand the present-day dynamics and historical
deformation of the region. The results are interpreted in the context of the proposed models for
the tectonic evolution of Sabah and provide new constraints on the dynamic state of the mantle,
136 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
particularly the lithospheric mantle.
9.1.1 Shear-wave splitting
Shear-wave splitting is a key and near-unambiguous indication of the presence of seismic anisotropy.
When a linearly polarised shear wave impinges on an anisotropic medium, it is partitioned into
two quasi-S waves, which propagate at different velocities. A time lag,  t, develops between
these two waves as they travel through the anisotropic medium, with the final integrated value
proportional to both the path length and strength of anisotropy. The polarisations of these two
waves, commonly called fast (denoted  hereafter) and slow, are controlled by the symmetry
and orientation of the anisotropic elastic tensor. The orientation of the fast axis of anisotropy,  ,
can be related to both present-day asthenospheric flow or historic lithospheric deformation, with
the dominant mechanism being LPO of intrinsically anisotropic minerals such as olivine. The delay
time,  t, is an integrated measure of anisotropy along the raypath, with a strong trade-off between
the thickness of an anisotropic layer and the strength of anisotropy. Studies of azimuthal anisotropy
in the upper mantle commonly make use of the family of core-refracted phases that involve a
P-to-S conversion at the receiver-side core-mantle boundary, hereafter collectively referred to as
XKS phases. These converted phases are polarised in the radial plane and retain no information
on source-side anisotropythus, energy observed on the transverse component is diagnostic of
anisotropy or lateral heterogeneity beneath the receiver. Consequently, shear-wave splitting mea-
surements provide excellent lateral resolution of seismic anisotropy, but lack significant vertical
resolution.
Though straightforward in theory, the measurement of shear wave splitting parameters,  and  t,
from seismic recordings is made non-trivial by the presence of seismic noise. It is also complicated
by the fact that most techniques assume a simple model of anisotropy e.g. a single, horizontal
layer. Complex anisotropy, such as multiple anisotropic layers, along a raypath can result in very
complicated patterns of shear-wave splitting, though it is possible to tease some of this apart by
studying how  and  t vary as a function of back azimuth and incident angle (Silver and Savage,
1994). Null measurements are measurements that suggest that there has been no splitting of the
wave between the CMB and the receiver. It is possible that these observations indicate that there
is no radial anisotropy along the raypath, either due to the Earth being isotropic or because the
axis of anisotropy is oriented vertically, which can be the case if there is vertical flow beneath
the station (e.g. Merry et al., 2021; West et al., 2009). In this instance, one would expect to
observe nulls at any azimuth. However, null observations may also arise if the initial polarisation
of the core-refracted phase is aligned with either the fast or slow axes of anisotropy. The latter
case is hereafter referred to as a geometric null and is commonly indicated by null observations
being limited to two azimuths, 90 apart. Geometric nulls can still be useful for constraining the

orientation of anisotropy, though they (naturally) lack any information on the strength of anisotropy.
9.2 Data and Methods
The seismic waveform data used in this study were recorded by two networks of seismic instruments
(Figure 9.1c): the temporary nBOSS (northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey) network (Pilia
et al., 2019); and the permanent monitoring network operated by the Malaysian meteorological
office, MetMalaysia. The nBOSS network, operated between March 2018 and January 2020, con-
sisted of 46 seismic stations with a mean station separation of 38 km. Two instruments types were
used: the Gralp 6TD, a three-component broadband instrument with a flat response between 30
s100 Hz; and the Gralp 3ESPCD, a three-component broadband instrument with a flat response
between 60 s100 Hz. The MetMalaysia permanent network consists of Streckeisen STS-2/2.5s,
also three-component broadband instruments with a flat response between 120 s100 Hz, with their
deployment focussing on the seismically active regions around Mount Kinabalu in the north-west
and Darvel Bay in the south-east (Figure 9.1c). Data recorded at this network between January
2018 and January 2020 were made available by MetMalaysia.
138 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
A catalogue of viable events fulfilling the criteria Mb  5.8 and epicentral distance  85 was
produced, containing a total of 129 earthquakes. A list of the events used in this study is available
in Appendix C. Model phase arrival times for the XKS phases were calculated using a traveltime
lookup table for each event/station pair. Sabah is not optimally situated relative to the regions
that typically produce suitable events (e.g. the Sunda/Tonga-Kermadec/Japan subduction zones).
Coupled with the short deployment period, there are notable gaps in the back-azimuthal data cover-
age, which has implications for how the shear-wave splitting data can be utilised for interpreting
anisotropic structure. Figure 9.2a shows the distribution of the 129 events used in this study.
The MetMalaysia site KKM has been in continuous operation since 2005, with continuous wave-
form data archived at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Manage-
ment Center (DMC). A separate catalogue of viable events, using the same criteria, was created, in
order to produce a long-term benchmark to help validate the observations at the temporary/more
recent networks. The distribution of the 1030 events that are suitable for analysis are shown in
Figure 9.2b. The azimuthal coverage at this site is far greater than what is possible at any of the
other stations in the network, which also enables us to investigate the possibility of more complex
anisotropy, such as dipping and/or multiple layers, features that might be expected given what is
known of the regions tectonic history.
The shear-wave splitting analysis was performed using the SplitRacer code package (Reiss and
Rmpker, 2017). All waveform data were bandpass filtered between 3 and 25 s before a signal-to-
noise ratio was calculated in a window around the predicted arrival. Only those phase arrivals with
a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 1.5 were retained for splitting analysis. The waveform data were
then inspected and the automatically assigned analysis windows were visually assessed. Where
necessary, these time windows were adjusted to best capture the phase arrival and exclude any non-
XKS arrivals. Poor quality, noisy waveforms were also removed at this stage. The initial splitting
analysis was performed using the single channel transverse energy minimisation method of Silver
and Chan (1988, 1991), assuming a horizontal layer of anisotropic medium. This technique consists
of a grid search over the two splitting parameters, the fast direction ( ) and delay time ( t), seeking
the pair that best removes splitting. The uncertainties in the measurements were assessed using the
inverse F-test technique laid out in Silver and Chan (1991), with the corrections identified in Walsh
et al. (2013). The resulting splitting measurements were then visually inspected and classified
as good (clear and well-constrained splitting), fair (clear evidence of splitting, but less well-
constrained), null (clear absence of splitting), and poor (indeterminable result). Measurements
classified as poor were disregarded in further analysis. A measurement was classified as good
or fair if it exhibited the following three characteristics: 1) distinct energy on the transverse
component prior to correction; 2) elliptical particle motion for the horizontal components before
correction, which became rectilinear after correction; and 3) the 95% confidence contour was
9.3 Results 139
narrower than 60 along the  axis and 0.25 s along the  t axis. Additional estimates of  and
 t were calculated using the joint analysis method of Wolfe and Silver (1998) and the splitting
intensity technique of Chevrot (2000). For the joint analysis, error grids for the good and null
observations at each site were stacked and the global minimum extracted. This technique assumes
a single layer of anisotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry, making it prone to inaccuracy in
the case of more complex anisotropy, as well as being biased towards event clusters that contribute
a large number of good observations. To combat this, the multi-channel splitting intensity method
(Chevrot, 2000) is also used as a means of cross-validating the measured splitting parameters. This
technique solves for  and  t at a single station using multiple records from different azimuths
simultaneously.
9.3 Results
9.3.1 20182020
A total of 1437 phase arrivals were analysed, resulting in 686 splitting measurements ranked as
good (150), fair (319), or null (217). Examples of good and null observations are shown in
Figure 9.3 and 9.4, respectively. From these 686 observations, 268 are from SKS phase arrivals,
354 from SKKS, 38 from PKS, 8 from SKIKS, and 18 from PKIKS. The average delay time for
the good and fair splitting measurements is 1.41  0.76 s, which is greater than the global
average of 1.0 s for continents. However, this average value may be biased by a small number of
stations for which there are a large number of observations. Station misalignments were assessed
by comparing the orientation of the first eigenvector of the XKS horizontal particle motion with the
back azimuth to the earthquake (e.g. Eakin et al., 2018). The average station misalignment was
calculated to be -2  5, which is below the uncertainties of the measured  values for every station
(see Table 9.1) and is in line with the assessment of instrument orientations taken in the field during
deployment and retrieval. Stacked results were possible at 42 stations, shown in Figure 9.5 and
listed in Table 9.1. Taking the average of the joint measurements of  t results in an average delay
time of 0.90  0.33 s, which is below the continental average. Two trends in  emerge from the
stacked observations. Stations in the west and north-west of Sabah show an average fast orientation
of N063E  14, sub-parallel to the Crocker range and the north-west Borneo trough. In contrast,
stations in the east and south-east have an average fast polarisation of N112E  19, which is
sub-parallel to both the Absolute Plate Motion (APM, N120E; Argus et al., 2011) and direction of
spreading in the Sulu Sea. A small number of stations, located primarily to the south-east of Mount
Kinabalu (see Figure 9.1c), exhibit  values that are perturbed from both the dominant NE-SW and
NW-SE trends. Elsewhere, the transition between the two trends appears to be sharp, occurring
over . 40 km.

142 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
There are notably fewer measurements in eastern Sabah, despite the uniform network coverage
(Figure 9.1c), which may reflect the complex sedimentary successions observed in this area (e.g.
Tongkul, 1991, 1993), as well as an elevated level of noise degrading the phase arrivals. Indeed,
the low-lying regions of eastern Sabah are significantly more densely populated than central and
southern Sabah. A similar deterioration of results is observed in receiver function analysis at these
sites. A number of stations exhibit nulls (represented by crosses in Figure 9.5)on inspection,
it is likely that these are geometric in nature (the observations typically come from a limited
back-azimuthal band), as opposed to them indicating the Earth beneath the stations is isotropic.
That aside, there is evidence from mapping of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary across Sabah
that the lithosphere is thinned around Tawau in the south-east of Sabah (Greenfield et al., 2022),
which is coincident with a number of stations that exhibit nulls (see Figure 9.5) and intraplate
volcanism on the Semporna Peninsula (Macpherson et al., 2010). Thinning of the lithosphere and
subsequent upwelling of mantle could induce vertical flow in the upper mantle, resulting in nulls
and, at the very least, disrupting any fossil anisotropy in the lithosphere.

9.3 Results 143
There is some variation in  t across Sabah, most notably in the south-central region around the
Maliau Basin, where there is a notable reduction compared to measurements at nearby stations. This
correlates somewhat with the edge of the orogenic belt, but may also be a result of more complex
anisotropy as a function of depth beneath this region. However, without sufficient back-azimuthal
coverage, it is difficult to be conclusive. Overall, however, there appears to be little variation in 
as a function of back azimuth, suggesting that a single dominant horizontal layer of anisotropy is
sufficient to explain the shear-wave splitting observations (Silver and Savage, 1994). While this
is consistent with the conclusions of Song et al. (2021), who looked at teleseismic shear-wave
splitting at a handful of permanent stations with publicly available data across the Sundaland Block,
the back-azimuthal coverage is fairly limited for the period between 2018 to 2020 (see Figure 9.2).
This is explored further at the permanent MetMalaysia station, KKM, in Section 9.3.2.

144 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
9.3.2 KKM: 20062020
Variations in shear-wave splitting parameters as a function of back azimuth are a key indicator
of complex, multi-layered and/or dipping anisotropic fabrics. Identification of such patterns,
however, is often hampered by the temporary nature of many passive seismic experiments. KKM,
a permanent station operated by MetMalaysia, is situated on the north-west coast of Sabah and
has been in continuous operation since at least 2006, with waveform data made publicly available
through the IRIS DMC. Figure 9.6 shows the misfit grid resulting from the joint splitting analysis
performed at KKM using all single-channel measurements that were previously graded as good or
null, which returned a best-fitting ( ,  t) pair of (N068E  4, 0.92  0.10 s). There appears to
be little to no variation in  as a function of back azimuth (see Figure 9.7a), which suggests there is
a single dominant horizontal layer of anisotropic material responsible for the shear-wave splitting
observed at KKM. In addition to this, the splitting intensity technique was applied to independently
measure the splitting parameters, the results of which are shown in Figure 9.7b. The method
returned a strong fit to the data and a best-fitting ( ,  t) pair of (N066E  3, 0.71  0.08 s),
which closely agrees with the result of the joint splitting analysis. Together with the limited
evidence of back-azimuthal variation, I can confidently treat the anisotropy beneath KKM as simple
and likely as representative of the shear-wave splitting observed at most of the stations along the
north-west coast of Sabah.
9.4 Discussion
The observed patterns of shear-wave splitting exhibit the signatures of some of the major tectonic
events that have occurred in the last 20 My. While the contribution to the observed delay time from
the crust cannot be constrained, it has been shown that it typically amounts to around 0.10.5 s
(Barruol and Mainprice, 1993; Silver, 1996), thus making a mantle contribution necessary to
explain my observations. It is possible to estimate the thickness of the anisotropic layer, L, from
 t, using the expression L  ( t VS)/dVS (where VS is the shear velocity and dVS is the average
percent anisotropy). Using a VS of 4.48 km s1 (ak135; Kennett et al., 1995) and a dVS of 4% (an
upper limit of the degree of anisotropy in the upper 200 km; Savage, 1999), the mean delay time
of 0.9  0.33 s corresponds to a layer thickness of 100  40 km. An estimate for the lithosphere-
asthenosphere boundary beneath the nBOSS network was recently extracted from a shear-wave
velocity model, calculated through the inversion for phase velocities at periods between 25 and
200 s (Greenfield et al., 2022; Pilia et al., 2021a). This study used a two-plane-wave approach
and converted from VS to temperature, before taking the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to
be the 1333 C contour (see Figure 9.5; Greenfield et al., 2022). This model exhibits an average
lithospheric thickness of 100 km, with notable thinning (50 km) around the Semporna Peninsula.

146 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
My results are supplemented by a small number of observations from three previous studies (Cao
et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2013), which measure  at the permanent MetMalaysia
stations KKM and LDM. The  values measured in these studies are consistent with my value
at KKM and with the stations in the vicinity of LDM (see Figure 9.5). Xue et al. (2013) only
published a single result at KKM, with a  t significantly larger than that observed in this study or
elsewhere (Cao et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021).
The orogen-parallel trend observed across western and north-western Sabah is strong evidence that
the observed seismic anisotropy reflects the continent-continent collision between the extended
South China continental margin and the continental margin of Sabah which occurred roughly 21 Ma.
This is consistent with the conceptual framework of vertically coherent deformation (Silver and
Chan, 1988, 1991), in which continental plates deform coherently over their depth extent and can
play a significant role in mantle anisotropy. This trend spans the entire area known as the Western
Cordillera in Sabah (dashed white line in Figure 9.1c), extends into the offshore fold-and-thrust
belt, and also appears to continue off the northern tip of Sabah towards Palawan. This continuation
of the trend is notable, insofar as it is what would be expected from the fact that Palawan shares
several tectonic events with western Sabahfor example, the subduction of the proto-South China
Sea and the subsequent continent-continent collision. Fast orientations of seismic anisotropy are
commonly observed to trend parallel to orogenic belts in continental collision zones, both in the
crust (e.g. Fry et al., 2010; Pilia et al., 2021b) and in the lithospheric mantle (e.g. Bastow et al.,
2007; Gilligan et al., 2016; Helffrich, 1995; Kaviani et al., 2021; Liddell et al., 2017; McNamara
et al., 1994; Silver and Chan, 1988, 1991), with transpression being proposed as the source of strain
(through which LPO anisotropy is induced) normal to the relative motion between the two plates
(Nicolas, 1993). Any fabric within the upper mantle relating to subduction of the proto-South
China Sea has likely been overprinted by the continent-continent collision. This has implications
for the lifespan of anisotropic fabrics within the ductile asthenosphere, suggesting they are much
more transient than fabrics left in the lithosphere during large-scale tectonic deformation events.
The mean fast orientation in the east of Sabah is sub-parallel to the APM of the Eurasian plate,
though the slow-moving nature of this plate might mean that the relative motion between the
plate and the underlying asthenosphere is insufficient to organise the flow within the mantle. In
this case, one could discount the dominance of simple asthenospheric flow in controlling the
large-scale coherence and alignment of shear-wave splitting observations (Silver, 1996) in favour
of an alternative mechanism. While the orientation inferred from my observations of shear-wave
splitting is not incompatible with APM-induced LPO anisotropy, the plate velocity is only around
2 cm yr1 (Argus et al., 2011), which is less than the 4 cm yr1 proposed by Debayle and Ricard
(2013) as necessary for a plate to organise the flow in its underlying asthenosphere. Hence, it is
worth also considering other potential sources for the observed trend, the most prominent among
those being the extension and rifting of the nearby Sulu Sea. Until recently, it was believed that
9.4 Discussion 147
northern Borneo was, and still is, under a compressional tectonic regime. However, geochemical
analysis of a suite of samples from an ophiolitic complex near Telupid, central Sabah, provided
evidence for the continuation of rifting in the Sulu Sea inland, dated to around 9 Ma (Figure 9.1a
Tsikouras et al., 2021). This inference is supported by crustal thickness measurements made across
Sabah using the nBOSS dataset (Pilia et al., 2021a), which show thinning of the crust (30 km),
extending from the Sulu Sea, through Sandakan Bay, towards central Sabah, coinciding with the
exposed ophiolite complex. From these observations, it is also possible to conclude that the mean
fast orientation across eastern Sabah is sub-parallel to the direction of the extension that would be
expected due to rollback of the subducting Celebes Sea slab and extension across the Sulu Sea. In
such extensional and/or rifting environments, stretching lineation, and hence  , is expected to be
parallel to the extension direction (Silver, 1996).
The lack of evidence for back-azimuthal variations in fast polarizations at KKM provides an
additional line of evidence for horizontally layered anisotropy that is vertically coherent. It re-
mains possible that there are multiple layers with similar orientations, though without earthquakes
within this layer the vertical integration of  t makes this indistinguishable from a single layer.
Additionally, it only provides such a constraint for a small region around KKM, corresponding
roughly with the width of the first Fresnel zone for the XKS phase arrivals. There may be multiple
layers of anisotropy beyond this region that I am unable to sufficiently identify due to the limited
back-azimuthal coverage of my shear-wave splitting observations.
A small number of stations, located primarily to the south-east of Mount Kinabalu (see Figure
9.5), exhibit  values that lie between the two dominant NE-SW and NW-SE trends. The surface
geology in the region around Ranau exhibits an exposed suite of peridotites, dated to 10 Mathus
post-dating the formation of the Crocker Range. Geochemical analysis of zircons found within
these peridotites points towards a subcontinental lithospheric mantle origin for these rocks, meaning
they must have been uplifted and exposed within the last 10 Ma. A recent P-wave tomographic
model for the mantle beneath Sabah has revealed a narrow, fast anomaly extending from the
region of thinned lithosphere around the Semporna Peninsula (south-east Sabah), towards Ranau,
interpreted to represent a lithospheric drip that formed from the root of the Sulu Arc (Pilia et al.,
2021a). Thermo-mechanical modelling of a Rayleigh-Taylor gravitational stability, seeded by a
small density perturbation representing the root of the volcanic arc, has been found to provide
a reasonable explanation for the observed extension, and lithospheric thinning, across Mount
Kinabalu and around Ranau (Pilia et al., 2021a). Consequently, these observations may be an
indication of a gradual overprinting of the orogen-parallel trend by localised extension related to
the formation of a lithospheric instability from the root of the Sulu Arc.
148 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
Regional-scale tomographic models of Southeast Asia exhibit a high-velocity anomaly at between
200300 km depth beneath northern Borneo (Amaru, 2007; Hall and Spakman, 2015; Zenonos
et al., 2019), which is attributed to cold, subducted lithospheric material from either the Celebes
Sea or the proto-South China Sea. Song et al. (2021) attribute the fast orientation measured at
KKM to LPO anisotropy induced by the deflection of mantle flow around the fossil slab segment
of the proto-South China Sea subduction (inferred from tomographic studies, e.g. Zenonos et al.,
2019) or a thick lithospheric keel. Pilia et al. (2021a) have demonstrated the absence, however,
of any strong anomaly in the mantle above 200 km that could potentially suggest that the imaged
slab material has broken off and begun to sink into the lower mantle, the minimum depth of which
is thought to be 250 km. Consequently, there is unlikely to be any remnant of 3-D mantle
flow around the down-going slab or within the former mantle wedge, as is commonly seen in
active subduction zones. For simple asthenospheric flow, the common model by which strain
is localised in the asthenosphere, the memory of this flow direction is thought to be only a few
million years (Silver et al., 1999) based on the amount of strain required to completely reorient
olivine aggregates (Nicolas et al., 1973). This interpretation also neglects the possible contribution
due to fossil anisotropic fabric induced during the collision between the South China Sea conti-
nental margin and northern Borneo, which has since been frozen into the lithosphere. There is a
strong correlation between the lateral extent of this trend and the region showing a thickened litho-
sphere in Greenfield et al. (2022), likely a result of the aforementioned continent-continent collision.
The proposed slab imaged beneath Sabah, however, appears to be entirely aseismic. This may
indicate that the stress imparted to the material during subduction is a key component of the
mechanism(s) behind deep-focus seismicity, though it is somewhat in contrast with observation,
and explanation, of some deep earthquakes in the Tonga-Vanuatu region thought to be associated
with detached slab segments around 4 Ma (Richards et al., 2011). Without local, deep earthquakes
beneath the study region, it is difficult to build any strong constraints on the depth distribution of
seismic anisotropy. The short length scales (. 40 km) over which there are observed changes in the
fast orientation of anisotropy, however, does indicate that some degree of the observed shear-wave
splitting is likely lithospheric in origin, so as to avoid a significant overlap in the first Fresnel zones
of the phase arrivals at the network, which have a width of 150 km at the base of the lithosphere.
Future work could make use of P-to-S conversions at significant boundaries, such as the Moho,
or deep regional earthquakes from the Philippines and Sunda subduction zones (though the latter
would primarily be useful for improving the azimuthal coverage, rather than the depth resolution).
9.4.1 Radial anisotropy
Radial anisotropy within the Earth can be constrained by the extraction of laterally averaged VSV
and VSH from Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocities, where VSV and VSH are the wave speeds for
horizontally and vertically polarised shear waves, respectively. The ratio of these two averaged
9.4 Discussion 149
velocities can be used as a measure of the degree of radial anisotropy as a function of depth, which
can in turn be related to the tectonic processes that generate seismic anisotropy. In contrast to
shear-wave splitting measurements, this technique has good vertical resolution, but at the cost of
poorer lateral resolution. For A-type olivine fabric (the dominant fabric formed under standard
mantle conditions), VSH/VSV > 1 (positive radial anisotropy) indicates horizontal flow or simple
shear, and VSH/VSV < 1 (negative radial anisotropy) indicates vertical flow or pure shear shortening.
Deformation by pure shear shortening may be an important factor in the generation of anisotropy
in regions undergoing lithospheric shortening and thickening, proposed as an important stage in the
generation of stable continental roots (Priestley et al., 2021). A key feature one would expect to
see if there were significant anisotropy generated by simple asthenospheric flow is positive radial
anisotropy below the lithosphere (&100 km).

I extracted 1-D depth profiles of the radial anisotropy parameter,  = (VSH/VSV )

SASSY21 model, a recent 3-D full-waveform inversion tomographic model of Southeast Asia
(Wehner et al., 2022, in review). This model included waveform data down to a period of 20 s.
Consequently, the velocities (and hence anisotropic structure) of the upper 50100 km of the Earth
150 Exploring seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath northern Borneo
are smoothed somewhat over this depth range, though the observed trend and sign in  remains
valid. The starting model for this inversion was the Collaborative Seismic Earth Model (CSEM)
introduced by (Fichtner et al., 2018), which is a modified version of the 1-D anisotropic PREM
(Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981). This starting model exhibits positive radial anisotropy down to
200 km. The averages of VSH and VSV were calculated at each depth slice within a small region of
the model centred on northern Borneo. In addition, this region was subdivided into two sub-regions
encompassing the two trends observed in the teleseismic shear-wave splitting dataset and 1-D
profiles of the radial anisotropy were calculated (box coordinates listed in Appendix C, results
shown in Figure 9.8).
The radial anisotropic structure of the upper 5075 km appears to be positive ( > 1), indicating an
anisotropic fabric with a primarily horizontal orientation that is consistent with LPO induced by
both shortening and transpression at convergent boundaries (the orogen-parallel trend in the north-
west of Sabah) and extension of continental material (Sulu Sea spreading trend in the south-east of
Sabah). There is no indication of positive radial anisotropy at asthenospheric depths, which supports
the conclusion that the observed seismic anisotropy is principally attributable to the lithosphere and
corresponding mechanisms of deformation. There is some difference in the amplitude of negative
radial anisotropy between 125250 km depth, which may indicate some differences in the dynamic
state of the mantle in these two regions, but this is beyond the scope of this study. The thickness
of this observed layer is roughly consistent with the thickness of the lithosphere observed in both
Greenfield et al. (2022) and Pasyanos (2010).
9.5 Conclusions 151
9.5 Conclusions
I have investigated seismic anisotropy across northern Borneo using shear-wave splitting analysis
of XKS phases recorded between March 2018 and January 2020. This has been supplemented by
shear-wave splitting measurements at KKM, a permanent station operated by MetMalaysia, between
January 2006 and January 2020. Across western Sabah, most notably beneath the Crocker Range, I
find orogen parallel anisotropy striking at N063E  14, likely reflecting fossil anisotropy in the
lithosphere formed during the collision of the continental Dangerous Grounds with the continental
margin of northern Sabah. Indeed, the observed delay times of 0.61.8 s are consistent with a 100 
40 km thick layer with 4% anisotropy (or, conversely, a 100 km thick layer with 2.58% anisotropy).
There are insufficient data to indicate complex anisotropy, such as multiple or dipping layers, which
suggests the sub-lithospheric mantle is either isotropic, weakly anisotropic, or possesses the same
anisotropic fabric as the lithosphere. In eastern Sabah, the orientation of anisotropy is nearly
orthogonal to the trend observed in the west and is sub-parallel to both the absolute plate motion
and the direction of spreading of the Sulu Sea, striking at N112E  19. This trend extends inland
to central Sabah, where it terminates, correlating well with the extent of onshore spreading inferred
from recent U-Pb dating. The rapid transition between these two dominant trends (over . 40 km)
suggests that the anisotropic source is shallow, though without a means of constraining this further
(e.g. direct S phases from intermediate-focus earthquakes originating beneath Sabah), it is hard to
be conclusive. A reduction in the observed delay times seen in south-central Sabah, including a
number of null stations, may indicate the presence of vertical mantle flow, such as that induced
by a lithospheric drip. A number of stations in the Ranau region exhibit fast orientations that lie
between the two main trends, possibly indicating the gradual overprinting of the fossil fabric in
response to localised extension and thinning of the lithosphere. These results constitute strong
evidence for a system of mechanisms focussed predominantly within the lithosphere as the primary
controls on seismic anisotropy in post-subduction continental settings, with little influence from
present-day mantle flow.
Chapter 10
Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault
network
In this chapter, I present a new, robust, and comprehensive catalogue of the seismicity of the
Kinabalu-Ranau fault network. At c. 4100 m, Mount (Gunung) Kinabalu is one of the tallest
mountains in Southeast Asia (and the tallest on Borneo), an imposing massif that dominates the
skyline of the north-west coast of Sabah. How this mountain fits within the tectonic puzzle of
Sabah remains an open question. Getting a better view of the seismicity of the region can help
to address this question, and also has a direct impact on our understanding of the seismic hazard
posed, the need for which was thrown into sharp relief in 2015 with the occurrence of the MW 6.0
Ranau earthquake, which led to the tragic deaths of 18 people on the mountain.
I make extensive use of waveform data made available to the nBOSS project by MetMalaysia.
Without this data, which significantly improves the density of stations around Kinabalu, this work
would not have been possible. This study was conceived during the deployment of a telemetry
system for an instrument deployed near the Laban Rata guesthouse near the summit of Mount
Kinabalu. Waveform data were being streamed from the instrument to a computer I was installing
at the park entrance, where a display would show the live recording of ground velocity on the
three-component 6TD. While working on this through the morning, I noticed a number of events
that reminded me of the microseismic signals I had been analysing in Iceland at the time. This,
coupled with the ML 5.2 earthquake in March 2018 (during the deployment of the nBOSS network),
motivated me to further explore the seismic activity around the mountain.
One aspect of this particular setup that I have not explored, yet could potentially be of interest,
would be to use the waveform recordings to seek out signals associated with rockfalls and landslides.
The region is prone to these gravity-driven phenomena, which can cause significant damage to
infrastructure (such as roads and power lines) e.g. a landslide in December 2019 took out a portion
of the route connecting Kota Kinabalu to south-east Sabah through Ranau.
154 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
10.1 Introduction
The 2015 MW 6.0 Ranau earthquake was the second largest earthquake to occur in Sabah, northern
Borneo, since records began. This earthquake caused significant damage to infrastructure in the
region and triggered extensive landslides on the flanks of the nearby Mount Kinabalu (c. 4100 m)
(Wang et al., 2017). However, with only around 100200 earthquakes with magnitudes >2
recorded across all of Sabah from 19902018, the exact rate of seismicity and how it relates to
ongoing tectonic processes around Mount Kinabalu remains unclear. Following the 2015 earth-
quake, a number of permanent stations were deployed around Ranau by MetMalayia in order to
improve the overall network coverage and sensitivity to seismic activity on the Kinabalu-Ranau
fault network. The deployment of the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) network
in 2018 further facilitated the detailed exploration of the seismicity on these faults. The benefits
of such a study are severalfold: 1) improving our understanding of the faults on which future
earthquakes may occurtheir location and extent, and potentially the seismogenic thickness of
the crust around Ranau; 2) existing analyses of the seismic hazard in the region have employed
probabilistic models with a priori constraints based only on the current earthquake catalogue,
which is very limited; and 3) providing information on the current dominant tectonic stress regime
in northern Borneo, a topic that is still debated (e.g. Cullen, 2010; Hall, 2013; Hesse et al., 2009;
Morley, 2007; Pilia et al., 2021a; Tsikouras et al., 2021).
Mount Kinabalu lies at the northern terminus of the Crocker Range (Figure 10.1), an orogenic belt
formed during the collision of the extended continental Dangerous Grounds with the continental
margin of northern Borneo. This continent-continent collision occurred contemporaneously with
the termination of subduction of the proto-South China Sea at around 21 Ma, one of a number of
important events in the recent tectonic history of Sabah (see Hall, 2013, for an overview). With
the cessation of convergenceresponsible for the compressive, orogen-forming tectonic force
orogenic belts tend to gradually collapse, extend, and spread under body forces resulting from
isostatically compensated elevation and sharp elevation gradients (with extension occurring normal
to the orogenic belt) (e.g. Dewey, 1988). This is evidenced in Sabah by the existence of a number
of still active normal (extensional) faults that strike along the NE-SW trending inland valleys of the
Crocker and Trusmadi Ranges. These faults have principally been mapped using high-resolution
radar and satellite images coupled with field observations (Tongkul, 2017; Wang et al., 2017).
In addition to these mapped normal faults, trends observed across a number of temporary GPS
stations deployed along the Crocker Range indicate the ongoing gravitational collapse (Mustafar
et al., 2017; Sapin et al., 2013). In contrast, the granitic massif of Mount Kinabalu appears to be
going up at a rate of 12 mm/year (Mustafar et al., 2017). The main body of Mount Kinabalu
is comprised of a granitic sheeted laccolith, intruded into the deformed Crocker Range around
78 Ma, based on high-precision U-Pb dating (Cottam et al., 2010). Geobarometry of amphibole
samples suggest an emplacement depth of between 3 and 10 km (Vogt and Flower, 1989). This

depth range is independently supported by thermochronological analyses of 40Ar/39Ar in biotite
and Zircon/Apatite fission-track dating, which put the emplacement depth to be between 7 and 12
km (Cottam et al., 2013). Cottam et al. (2013) also interpreted the Zircon/Apatite fission-track
ages to reflect rapid cooling due to exhumation, regional uplift, and erosion, recovering an average
exhumation rate of c. 7.1 km Ma1. The exact source of the melt that formed this intrusion remains
unknown, though there is evidence to suggest a continental affinity, suggesting thickening and
heating of underthrusted Dangerous Grounds crust as a potential melt source (Cottam et al., 2010).
Here, I use QuakeMigratea Python package for automatic earthquake detection and location
using waveform migration and stackingto construct the most complete catalogue of earthquakes
for the period March 2018January 2020 to date, which reveals the ongoing seismicity of a network
of faults in the Kinabalu-Ranau region. Local magnitudes are calculated for the events, with which
I measure the regional b-value. Manual phase arrival time picks are used to refine the hypocentres
with NonLinLoc (Lomax et al., 2000) for 101 events with local magnitudes greater than ML 2.0,
which are compared to the hypocentres estimated by QuakeMigrate. Finally, fault plane solutions
are computed for the same subset of the earthquake catalogue. These results are used to interpret
the fault network in the context of the post-subduction tectonic setting of Sabah.
156 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
10.2 Data and Methods
The data used in this study were recorded at a composite network made up of instruments from
the temporary nBOSS project and the permanent Malaysian national meteorological agency (Met-
Malaysia) networks (Figure 10.1). The nBOSS network, which spans Sabah in a grid-like fashion,
was deployed in March 2018 and recovered in January 2020, thereby operating for a total of 22
months. At the time of the 2015 Ranau earthquake, only a single seismometer and a strong-motion
instrument were deployed in the region. In 2017, a number of permanent stations were installed by
MetMalaysia to monitor the area around Mount Kinabalu, significantly increasing the potential to
study the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network. A number of different models of seismometer are used in
this study, including: the Gralp 6TD (30 s100 Hz instruments); the Gralp 3ESPCD (60 s100
Hz instruments); and the Streckeisen STS2/2.5 (120 s100 Hz instruments). All waveform data
were high-pass filtered at 1 Hz, well above the corner frequency of any of the instruments in either
network. The locations of the stations used in this study are listed in Table 10.1, along with the
respective instrument model.

10.2 Data and Methods 157
10.2.1 Velocity model
Besides the raw waveform data, some velocity structure is required to calculate the traveltime
lookup tables used by QuakeMigrate. Due to the limited quantity of seismic data availability in
the region (until 2017, there were only two 3-component, broadband seismometers in the entirety
of Sabah), there are no publicly available 1-D velocity models specific to the study region. A
generic crustal model is sufficient for the initial detection of earthquakes using QuakeMigrate,
but the more accurate the velocity model, the better the final calculated locations. I created an
average 1-D S-wave velocity model by stacking the 1-D S-velocity profiles recovered from a joint
inversion of receiver functions and surface waves (Pilia et al., 2021a) at each station being used for
QuakeMigrate. A fixed VP/VS ratio of 1.74 was used to calculate the 1-D P-wave velocity model.
While this will not capture the degree of geological (and thus velocity) heterogeneity in the region,
it provides more locale specific information than a generic model, or the 1-D profile from the joint
analysis at a single station. The final velocity model used is shown in Figure 10.2.

VP/VS ratio of 1.74 was used to calculate the P-wave velocity model.
158 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
10.2.2 Initial catalogue generation
I use QuakeMigrate to build the catalogue of earthquakes that forms the basis of this study. This
method eschews the traditional philosophy of "pick-then-locate" in favour of a direct location
method based on continuous seismic waveform data, rather than discrete traveltime picks. Con-
tinuous seismic waveform data recorded at each station in the network are first transformed into
continuous representations of the probability of a phase arrival (referred to hereafter as onset
functions). At each time increment, the onset functions for each station are migrated into a search
volume according to the pre-calculated traveltime lookup tables, and stacked at each grid node.
Points in space and time here peaks in onset functions from stations across the network stack
coherently are treated as sources of seismic energy (i.e. earthquakes). Hypocentre uncertainties for
each candidate event identified in this manner are estimated using the implicit probabilistic nature
of the waveform stacking technique used within QuakeMigrate (Drew et al., 2013). Below, I discuss
the choices of input parameters used in this study to generate the initial earthquake catalogue.
Traveltime lookup tables
Traveltime lookup tables for both P- and S-waves were calculated using the method of Podvin
and Lecomte (1991) provided by the NonLinLoc package (Lomax et al., 2000). These traveltime
tables are used to migrate the onset functions back into the search volume. The core migration
and stacking algorithm searches for events over a regular 3-D spatial grid of nodes, the extent and
inter-node spacing of which can significantly impact the number of events detected, their spatial
distribution, and the systems sensitivity to low magnitude earthquakes.

The number and distribution of seismic stations used for the migration and stacking stages can also
impact the final results. In a sense, each station will return a vote (in the form of a continuous
probability distribution function) as to whether or not it has seen a specific phase arrival originating
from a particular point within the volume of interest. As such, an increasing density of stations acts
to make earthquakes within the volume appear more prominently in the continuous coalescence
function (the stack of votes). However, the inclusion of more stations that are further from the

expected source of seismicity can in fact reduce the overall sensitivity of the technique to smaller
earthquakes, impacting the magnitude of completeness of the resulting earthquake catalogue. A
number of station and grid configurations were trialled using a short sample (1 week) of continuous
data in order to maximise the number earthquakes identified. The final configuration, including the
lateral extent of the volume used, is shown in Figure 10.3. A spatial buffer is built into this search
volume as a means of reducing the number of false triggers from regional events and noise. The
energy tends to coalesce near the edges of the grid (regardless of where these are placed) and can
be straightforwardly removed by using this spatial filter (the dashed rectangle in Figure 10.3). The
extent of this region was chosen to encompass the main faults mapped by Wang et al. (2017) from
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. All parameters used to generate the traveltime
160 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
lookup tables are listed in Table 10.2.
For each stage, a number of parameter trials were run in order to explore the parameter space and
identify those parameters that optimised the various competing factors, namely the computational
costs and the number of events identified (including the number of false triggers).
Detect
The Detect stage was run at 20 Hz (that is, the coalescence value at every node in the grid was
calculated at intervals of 0.05 s) on a regular grid with a node spacing of 1 km in each dimension.
No significant gains in positive event detection rate were achieved by using a grid with smaller
node spacing (e.g. 0.5/0.25 km), which would have incurred additional computational costs (in
terms of both time and memory) by a factor of 8/16, respectively. Larger node spacings, however,
lead to a reduction in the number of events detected, as events with true locations that fall between
nodes do not coalesce as strongly as those with true locations near to nodes, resulting in peaks
in the coalescence that do not exceed the level of background noise within the grid. This can
be ameliorated through the application of a boxcar filter to the onset functions prior to stacking,
which acts to correct spatial aliasing arising from the discrete sampling of the continuous location
probability function of the search grid. However, this feature has not yet been implemented in
QuakeMigrate, and can impact the precision of the calculated locations.

For the Detect stage, I used the overlapping STA/LTA onset function, which produces a smooth ap-
proximation of the phase arrival PDF even in the presence of extremely sharp changes in amplitude.
In the overlapping window configuration, the rightmost end of both windows are coincident and
the calculated ratio is assigned to this position. The lengths of the short and long windows were
chosen to be 0.2 s and 1.5 s, respectively, which are tuned to pick out the onsets of phase arrivals
with dominant frequencies ranging from 110 Hz.
10.2 Data and Methods 161
Only data which were continuous throughout a timestepincluding the pre-and post-pad required
for migration to the most distant corner of the search volume, STA/LTA calculation, tapering, and
filteringwere used. All parameters used for Detect are listed in Table 10.3.
Trigger
The goal of the Trigger stage of QuakeMigrate is to extract candidate events from the continuous
coalescence timeseries computed in Detect. Peaks in this continuous timeseries correspond to
coherent stacking of phase arrivals, detected at a number of stations in the network, stacking above
the background noise. In general, smaller events, which are seen on fewer stations in the network,
produce smaller peaks in the continuous coalescence timeseries. Eventually, these become too hard
to distinguish from the background noise. Regional events, diurnal noise cycles, and changes in the
network configuration through time can also impact the overall sensitivity to candidate events by
altering the background coalescence levelsee Figures 2.10 and 10.4.

Large magnitude events within the search volume can also impact the effective signal-to-noise
ratio between peaks in the coalescence and the background noise. This can result in small
events being masked by the coda of the larger event. This can be mitigated by instead consider-
ing the normalised continuous coalescence timeseries, whereby the maximum coalescence value
is normalised by the arithmetic mean of the coalescence through the search volume at each timestep.

10.2 Data and Methods 163
The task of triggering events is essentially one of peak finding. Before triggering, the continuous
normalised coalescence time series was filtered using a Gaussian filter with a 0.5 s (10 samples)
standard deviation. This is an effective way to suppress short spikes caused by stochastically coher-
ent stacking of noise within the search volume, without eliminating peaks due to true events, which
tend to be wider and build-up and tail-off more gradually (Winder, 2021). To address the issues
highlighted above, a dynamic threshold was used based on the "median ratio" method described
in Winder (2021). This technique sets the trigger threshold as some user-defined multiple of the
median value of the coalescence trace over some fixed time interval, allowing it to rapidly adjust to
changes in the background coalescence value through time. I chose the scaling value such that the
final trigger threshold was just at the typical level of background noiseresulting in a reasonably
high number of false triggersin order to ensure that as many small events were detected as
possible. This would require significant filtering, butas discussed later on in this sectiona suit-
able metric has already been identified by which true events can be discriminated from false triggers.
The MetMalaysia network experienced a number of  2 day long outages, during which time only
the nBOSS stations contributed to the coalescence value (see Figure 10.5). For these time periods,
the median ratio trigger threshold multiplier was adjusted to better reflect the level of background
coalescence in the search volume and greatly reduce the number of false triggers.
Once the full complement of candidate events has been triggered, a spatial filter is applied to
remove triggers that were likely noise or possibly related to regional events beyond the search
volume, which typically coalesce strongly at the edge of the search volume, regardless of its spatial
extent. This spatial filter zone was built into the search volume with this step in mind (see Section
10.2.2). A total of 9425 candidate events were triggered over 673 days, shown in Figure 10.6.
Locate
The Locate stage is the last step of a QuakeMigrate run, in which the final event locations and the
associated uncertainty statistics are computed, along with a number of optional extra outputs. For
each of the candidate events identified in the Trigger stage, short windows around the candidate
origin time are re-migrated using a (commonly) higher resolution grid.
Locations were computed for all 9425 candidate events. For 1062 of these candidate events, the
computed locations corresponded to an event origin time outside the 1.5 s marginal window around
the triggered event origin time. This indicates that there exists a significant difference between
the triggered location and the final event location, which is often a sign of either an artefact or an
event constrained by few genuine phase arrivals e.g. small magnitude events. Consequently, these
candidate events were excluded from further analysis.

A representative sample (2000, or 25%) of the remaining 8363 located events were manually
inspected and labelled as either a real event or an artefact. This labelled subset was then used
to identify a suitable metric against which to filter the remaining unlabelled events in order to
streamline the process of creating a robust, refined final catalogue. Following the steps laid out in
Winder (2021), the peak coalescence value, the Gaussian uncertainty, and the global covariance
values were analysed. In line with the conclusions of Winder (2021), the global covariance was
found to be an exceptionally strong means of discriminating between real events and artefacts in
the unlabelled portion of the event catalogue (see Figure 10.7), whereas the Gaussian uncertainty
and the coalescence value were not sufficiently strong discriminators. The remaining 6363 located
events were subsequently filtered using a global covariance value cut-off of 12.5chosen to max-
imise the number of real events in the cataloguebefore being manually inspected and labelled.
The final catalogue consists of 5175 well-located events, shown in Figure 10.10, with roughly 55%
of all candidate events ending up in the final located catalogue. This may seem low, but it is merely
a function of the trigger thresholdI chose a low median ratio threshold multiplier in order to
ensure the maximum number of small, but real, events were detected.
In addition to event locations and the associated location uncertainties, I also chose to use both
the automatic phase picking and local magnitude estimation functionalities of QuakeMigrate.
Automatic phase picks are made by fitting a Gaussian to the onset function above some dynamic
threshold for each phase within some pre-calculated window around the modelled phase arrival
times derived from the traveltime lookup tables. These were found to do a good job, particularly
for the stations in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu, at which the modelled times were often poor
representations of the true phase arrivals. This is likely, and perhaps unsurprisingly, a result of the
average 1-D velocity model being a poor representation of the true velocity structure around the
Mount Kinabalu granite. For a number of stations in the very near vicinity of the active area, P
phase arrivals were occasionally misidentified as S phase arrivals, likely as a result of an incorrectly
identified hypocentral location.

10.2.3 Earthquake magnitudes
Local earthquake magnitudes were calculated automatically within QuakeMigrate following the
method laid out in Greenfield et al. (2020). Waveform data were converted to raw ground velocity
waveforms by deconvolution of the instrument response, before being convolved with the response
of a Wood-Anderson seismograph. The maximum zero-to-peak amplitudes (typically corresponding
to the S-phase arrival) were measured on each component within a signal window, determined in a
10.2 Data and Methods 167
Fig. 10.8 Magnitude residuals calculated for all events using the Hutton and Boore (1987) attenua-
tion curve. Dots are coloured by the corresponding event magnitude
similar manner to the pick windows, plus an additional 1 second. Noise measurements were made
by taking the amplitude of the envelope of the signal in a 5 second window preceding the P-wave
arrival window. Only S-wave amplitudes exceeding 3 times the noise amplitude were retained.
Local magnitude estimates for each component at each station in the network were subsequently
initially calculated from the corresponding amplitudes using the attenuation curve of Hutton and
Boore (1987), with no station corrections. For each event, the final ML value was calculated as
the arithmetic mean of the station/component magnitude estimates. Magnitude residualsthe
difference between the magnitude estimates on each component at every station on the network and
the average event magnitudewere calculated in order to assess how appropriate the Hutton and
Boore (1987) attenuation curve was for this region (Figure 10.8). Any departure from a uniform
distribution of residuals around 0 as a function of hypocentral distance is either indicative of
a poor fit to the attenuation curve, or the need for station-specific corrections (likely reflecting
local site effects, such as the influence of sedimentary structures). However, it should be noted
that magnitude uncertainties are implicitly tied to location uncertainties through the hypocentral
distance. For very local stations, where uncertainty estimates are similar to the source-receiver
distance, this can translate into large magnitude residuals.
Seismic b-value
The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) relation is an empirical law that encapsulates the observation that the
distribution of earthquake magnitudes is related in a log-linear fashion to the frequency of their
168 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
occurrence within a region (Gutenberg and Richter, 1942, 1944; Ishimoto, 1936). This relationship
takes the form:
log10 N = abM (10.1)
where N is the number of events larger than magnitude, M; a (the intercept) represents the pro-
ductivity of the region; and b (the gradient) represents the frequency decay of relative earthquake
magnitudes. The b-value is a useful estimate of the relative abundance of smaller to larger
earthquakesa large b-value implies that smaller earthquakes are more prevalent within a region.
This empirical relationship primarily holds only for magnitudes in a certain range. At small magni-
tudes, earthquakes become harder and harder to distinguish above the level of background noise
and are often simply not picked up by earthquake detection routines (a problem known as catalogue
incompleteness), though there may also exist some physical limit on the smallest earthquake that
can occur. Conversely, at large magnitudes the length of available earthquake catalogues are simply
too short to have captured a statistically significant number of potentially catastrophic events, which
typically have recurrence times on the order of tens to hundreds of years. Figure 10.9 illustrates the
G-R relation and its aforementioned shortcomings.

triangle denotes the magnitude of completeness, MC. The purple and pink dashed line sections
correspond to the magnitude ranges affected by the low- and high-end issues discussed in the main
text, respectively.
10.2 Data and Methods 169
For the global earthquake catalogue, the b-value is roughly equal to 1 (El-Isa and Eaton, 2014;
Gutenberg and Richter, 1944). This means, for example, that for every 10 magnitude 5 earthquakes,
there is 1 magnitude 6 earthquake. b > 1 indicates a higher abundance of small magnitude earth-
quakes, and vice-versa for b < 1. By establishing the b-value for a region, one can extrapolate the
recurrence rate ofor the length of time betweenevents of a given magnitude. Of course, there
are more variables, such as the seismogenic crustal thickness, that control the maximum possible
magnitude within a region, but knowledge of historical events of a given magnitude can be used
as a guide. b-values in excess of 1 indicate a propensity for smaller earthquakes, which has been
inferred to indicate heavily fractured regions of low strengthwith many possible fault planes,
excess stress can be relieved before having sufficient time to accumulate to the levels required to
generate large amounts of slip (i.e. larger magnitude earthquakes).
There exist a number of methods for obtaining the b-value for an earthquake catalogue, which
constitutes the fitting of a straight line to the earthquake frequency plot, truncated at the magnitude
of completeness (MC, see Figure 10.9). A simple least-squares technique has been shown to
possibly lead to underestimates in the b-value (Bengoubou-Valerius and Gibert, 2013), so instead a
maximum-likelihood method developed concurrently by Aki (1965) and Utsu (1965) is commonly
used. This is expressed as:
bMLE =
ln(10)( MC)
(10.2)
with an associated error given by:
MLE =
bMLE
(10.3)
where  is the average magnitude above the magnitude of completeness, MC, and N is the number
of earthquakes. This does, however, assume that the earthquake magnitudes are continuously
distributed, while in fact it is common for earthquake magnitudes to be discretely binned (to
make up for the often small number of earthquakes in a given catalogue and limitations on the
measurement of earthquake magnitude). In order to account for the possible asymmetric distribution
of magnitudes within each bin, Equation 10.2 is adjusted to:
bMLE,ad j =
ln(10)[  (MC  M2 )]
(10.4)
where M is the width of the bins used.

10.3 Seismicity around Mount Kinabalu, 20182020
The final catalogue, which consists of 5175 well-located events (55% of the raw QuakeMigrate
catalogue, after filtering), is shown in Figure 10.10. Nearly all of the observed seismicity is limited
to a 1010 km region ESE of the peak of Mount Kinabalu, within which there is some indication
of a NNE-SSW lineation. This is in contrast to the existing catalogues, such as the USGS catalogue,
which show a much more diffuse distribution of seismicity in the region, likely reflecting the
limitations in teleseismic location methods. The observed lineation is consistent with the trend of
normal fault scarps visible in the nearby topography (Wang et al., 2017), as well as the best-fitting
strike of the 2015 MW 6.0 earthquake (N209E). This strike was constrained using a finite fault
inversion of broadband teleseismic body waves, because at the time there were very few permanent
stations in Sabah. There are a number of earthquakes outside this central cluster that appear to
be robustly located when manually inspected, most notably to the east of Mount Kinabalu, with
two earthquakes exceeding ML 2.0. Interestingly, there is a notable dearth of seismicity around
the Poring Hot Springs (white diamond in Figure 10.10), which may be fed by geothermally
heated water percolating along the large normal fault running N-S through the region. The lowest
covariance values, shown previously to be a strong indicator of a true event, are seen within the
main locus of seismicity. Within this locus, there is a tight cluster of earthquakes between 48
km depthincluding a number of events with relatively high ML valuesthat may be delineating
a fault plane, but the scatter precludes a definitive conclusion. This might be resolved through the
application of relative relocation, which has been shown to be highly effective when used with the
automatic outputs from QuakeMigrate (Winder, 2021), but has not been undertaken here.
Over 99% of the located earthquakes have hypocentral depths shallower than 12 km (99th per-
centile at 11.4 km), which may be indicative of the seismogenic thickness of this region, though it
is difficult to say with certainty. It might, for example, instead be indicative of the extent of the
contact between the Kinabalu laccolith, the underlying serpentinite, and the surrounding country
rock (Cottam et al., 2010). Relative relocation of the earthquake hypocentres in the catalogue
could also help to delineate the strike and dip of this contact. The coarse gridding in space for
very shallow earthquakes, best seen in the vertical cross-sections of Figure 10.10, are due to the
proximity of the initial hypocentres (calculated on the 0.5 km-spaced grid) to the top of the search
volume. Since topographical information was not used in calculating the lookup tables, the Z
limit was chosen to incorporate as much of the Kinabalu granite as possible, without negatively
impacting the rest of the search volume by allowing the algorithm to migrate and stack energy
above the surface.
Figure 10.11 shows the distribution of Gaussian uncertainties in X, Y, and Z for the final earthquake
catalogue, as calculated by QuakeMigrate. This is achieved by fitting a 3-D Gaussian function
to a small region around the peak in the marginalised coalescence volume. The distributions of

Fig. 10.11 Distribution of Gaussian uncertainties in X, Y, and Z (from left to right) for the Mount
Kinabalu earthquake catalogue.
uncertainties in X and Y are unimodal, with peaks (determined using a kernel density estimate
to the data) around 2 km. The X locations appear slightly better constrained than Y, displaying
a sharper peak at 1.9 km in X than the 2.4 km for Y, and a smaller tail to higher values of
Gaussian uncertainty. This discrepancy between the constraints on X and Y likely arises due to
the network geometry, with more local stations to the east and west than to the north and south
of the centre of activity. Land access is the primary constraint on the deployment of additional
stations to fill the existing azimuthal gaps, but a knowledge of how the seismicity is distributed
could be used to help determine the location of any new sites that may be commissioned in the
future. The distribution of uncertainties in Z, however, appears to be multimodal with peaks around
0.5, 2, 3, and 5 km. This is also likely due, in part, to the network geometry, but on inspection of
some of the events with larger uncertainties, another possible source of this spread in uncertainties
was identified. A number of events around ML 13 were inspected and found that for the very local
stations, the high amplitude S-phase arrivals were appearing strongly on the vertical component
and resulting in a high onset function value that was dominating the stacked coalescence. This is
seen clearly for the subset of events that were manually picked and relocated using NonLinLoc
(see Section 10.3.2), for which there were large shifts in the depths, from very shallow (wrong) to
around 5 km depth. It is likely that this is due, in part, to local errors in the velocity model, which
fail to capture the heterogeneity produced by the Kinabalu graniteallowing S-phase arrivals to
reasonably stack with P- and S-phase arrivals at more distal stationswhich is not unreasonable
considering the 1-D starting model is simply a stack average of 1-D models for all stations within
the search volume. This is compounded by the relatively dense sampling of the near-field, with 3
stations within 10 km of the locus of seismicity located to the south-east of Mount Kinabalu.

of completeness, calculated in Section 10.3.1.
The seismic moment release for each earthquake is calculated using the empirical relationships of
Thatcher and Hanks (1973) and Hanks and Kanamori (1979). Roughly a third (0.4107 erg) of
the cumulative seismic moment release throughout the deployment period (Figure 10.12) occurs
within the first month of the deployment, related to the ML 5.2 March 2018 Ranau earthquake and
the associated aftershock sequence. The moment release continues to decay exponentially until
around July 2018, after which it appears to show a near-linear behaviour until January 2020. This
suggests that the fault network exhibits persistent seismicity through time with intermittent large
magnitude events, rather than cycling through periods of rupture, aftershock, and quiescence. This
may arise due to the continuous uplift that has been observed in vertical GPS data (Mustafar et al.,
2017) and warrants a close inspection and comparison of the available GPS and satellite data with
the seismic observations.
Diurnal detection variability
While tuning the parameters for the Trigger stage, it was noted that there could be significant
variations in the coalescence level over the course of a day. This corresponded with the day/night
cycle of human activity, with a higher average coalescence value during the day indicating an
increased level in the ambient seismic noise. This is predominantly due to the fact that many
of the permanent MetMalaysia stations are installed in vaults in or near towns and highways. I

investigated the impact this had on the detection rates and the magnitude of completeness of the
catalogue by dividing the events roughly into "daytime" (23:0010:00 UTC/07:0018:00 local
time) and "nighttime" (10:0023:00 UTC/18:0007:00 local time). Figure 10.13 shows clearly
the difference in detection rates, with around 150% more events detected during the night (3727)
than during the day (1448). The stacked histogram in Figure 10.14 shows that this difference in
the number of events detected corresponds to a change in the magnitude of completeness of the
catalogue on the order of about 0.5 ML.
This is a clear indication that, if there is an interest in studying microseismic activity, one should
consider trying to find the best balance between ease of provision (e.g. power, telemetry, servicing)
and the levels of anthropogenic noise when choosing sites for permanent stations. This may be
obvious, but the impact seen here is quite stark.

VP/VS ratio from automatic phase picks
QuakeMigrate provides automatic phase arrival time estimations, which I have used here to evaluate
a VP/VS ratio of 1.67 by making a linear fit to the scatter between the P-phase traveltimes and the P-
and S-phase differential traveltimes. This value is lower than the 1.74 used to create the initial 1-D
velocity model, though it may be biased by the heterogeneous distribution of stations with respect
to the seismicity. Estimation of an optimal 1-D velocity model may prove beneficial, including
station corrections which could help to account for the fact that the true velocity structure of the
crust around Mount Kinabalu is almost certainly highly heterogeneous.
10.3.1 Magnitude of completeness and b-value
Using the methods laid out in Section 10.2.3, I calculated a linear fit to the magnitude-frequency
distribution (shown in Figure 10.16), extracting a b-value of 1.2 and a magnitude of completeness
for the entire catalogue of 0.82. This corresponds well with the magnitude at which the detection
rates during the day and night appear to diverge, as seen in the stacked histogram of Figure 10.14.
The b-value of 1.2 is higher than the globally observed value of 1.0. Values of b > 1 indicate a
propensity for smaller magnitude earthquakes, usually a sign of higher stresses and more fractured
crust. However, this does not take into account the relative dearth of higher magnitude events that
arises due to the short time period over which the catalogue has been constructed. The repeat

times for larger earthquakes are longerthe longer a catalogue has existed, the better the observed
magnitude-frequency distribution will reflect the true underlying distribution that is being sampled.
Due to the logarithmic nature of the y-scale, the addition of earthquakes with high magnitudes can
have a relatively strong effect on the measured gradient (that is, the b-value). Consequently, the
b-value of 1.2 is more an indication of the upper bound on b.
10.3.2 Location refinement
I manually inspected and refined the P- and S-phase arrival times using the Snuffler tool in the
PyRocko library for the 101 earthquakes in the catalogue with a magnitude greater than ML 2.0,
before using the non-linear location programs provided by NonLinLoc (Lomax et al., 2000) to
recalculate the earthquake hypocentres. This process of manual phase arrival time picking and
location is widely seen as the "gold standard" of earthquake location. I have used the same velocity
model as with QuakeMigrate, shown in Figure 10.2. Figure 10.17 shows the results of this process,
with the original QuakeMigrate locations and the refined NonLinLoc locations represented by the
purple and green circles, respectively. The primary feature seen in the relocations is a significant
depth shift (78 km) of a number of shallow earthquakes (as calculated by QuakeMigrate). After
refinement, the hypocentres appear more tightly clustered spatially, with the originally shallow
earthquakes also preferentially shifted to the north. A number of events in the north-west of the

cluster exhibit a starkly vertical trend, which also appears to act to delineate the maximum western
and northern extents of seismicity. Notably, the 2018 ML 5.2 earthquake was relocated from very
shallow (0 km) to a depth of 6 km. In general, the relocated events indicate that ongoing slip
on the fault system is confined to a narrow segment of the fault surface at around 57 km depth,
located to the north-east of the region that was thought to have slipped in the 2015 earthquake
(Wang et al., 2017). This may suggest the gradual transfer of stresses along the existing faults, but
a longer time period of monitoring is required for any definitive conclusions to be made.
Those events that were already located with the deeper cluster, between 58 km, do not appear
to have been shifted much by the relocation process. This observation is supported when looking
at the distribution of X, Y, and Z shifts for each event, shown in Figure 10.18. The earthquakes
are best constrained in X, as was observed for the automatic QuakeMigrate locations in Figure
10.11, showing a unimodal distribution for all 101 manually picked and relocated earthquakes in
the subset. The distributions for the shifts in Y and Z, however, are bimodal in nature. This reflects
the two classes of automatic locationsthose that are deemed to be accurate reflections of the

were discussed in Section 10.3. I manually inspected the location and automatic phase picking

Each distribution is effectively unimodal, with kernel density estimates indicating each parameter
is distributed roughly around 0 with a Gaussian standard deviation of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.4 km in X, Y,

the automatic locations produced by QuakeMigrate are just as good as those produced by manual

phase picking and location, for a fraction of the effort. This obviously comes with the caveat that
QuakeMigrate is clearly vulnerable to some aspect of the network geometry and velocity model,
resulting in the aforementioned mislocations. The production of earthquake catalogues is clearly a
process that can benefit strongly from an iterative approach. This initial catalogue contains a vast
wealth of information, with which it would be possible to greatly improve the parameter choices
and input information given to an algorithm such as QuakeMigrate. For example, there are now
sufficient earthquakes for which manual phase arrival times can be made and fed into software such
as VELEST (Kissling et al., 1995) in order to produce an optimal 1-D velocity model, including
station corrections.
180 Seismicity of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network

picked polarities are self-consistent, but the solution is ambiguous; in contrast the moment tensor
in panel b is exceptionally tightly constrained. P-wave first motion polarity observations (red
circle = compressional; blue triangle = dilatational) and nodal planes for a subset of the explored
double-couple solutions are plotted on lower hemisphere projections. Nodal planes are coloured
by posterior probability (darker colours are better fitting), with the maximum probability solution
coloured purple. Only tightly constrained solutions (e.g. b) are used here.
10.3.3 Moment tensor solutions
Moment tensor solutions were calculated for a subset of 101 earthquakes with ML > 2.0 for which
P-phase first arrival polarities had been manually identified. These polarity observations are used
as the input data for the Bayesian moment tensor inversion software MTfit (Pugh and White, 2018),
with take-off angles calculated based on the hypocentres calculated using NonLinLoc. The moment
tensor solutions were constrained to be purely double-couple. The Markov-chain Monte-Carlo
approach implemented in MTfit is designed to explore the posterior probability space, which comes
with the benefit of not only identifying the best-fitting solution, but also providing a natural means
of assessing how well the input observations constrained the solution space. Of the 101 earthquakes
analysed, 26 were deemed sufficiently well constrained and are shown in map view in Figure 10.20.
Nearly every mechanism is found to be normal or exhibit a significant extensional component (see
ternary diagram in Figure 10.21), indicating ongoing extension along a fault or faults at depth.
The majority of these mechanisms strike roughly NE-SW, including both of the solutions from
the global Centroid Moment Tensor (gCMT) catalogue (Dziewonski et al., 1981). The coverage
of the focal sphere is suboptimal, which reduces the strength of the constraints on the solutions,
making it difficult to draw much more from the observations. These observations are, however, in

keeping with the idea that this region is undergoing extension, likely as a result of orogen collapse.
A single earthquake, located to the east of the primary locus of seismicity around Mount Kinabalu,
is located beneath an outcropping of Kinabalu granite. Without a larger catalogue, it is difficult to
fully interpret this earthquake or how it might be related to the surface geology, if at all.
10.4 Summary and further work
In this chapter, I have presented the first phase of analysis towards better understanding the network
of faults around Mount Kinabalu and Ranau. The new earthquake catalogue, consisting of 5175
well-located events, exhibits persistent seismicity over the time period March 2018January 2020,
including an ML 5.2 earthquake and associated aftershock sequence in March 2018. The fault
network exhibits far more seismic activity than previously indicated by existing global catalogues,
such as the USGS catalogue (see Figure 7.6), or the bulletin put together by MetMalaysia. In
addition to this, the seismicity in the new catalogue is more tightly constrained to one region

around Mount Kinabalu than was previously expected based on the prior earthquake catalogue,
likely reflecting the higher epicentral uncertainties associated with teleseismic location methods.
However, why exactly this seismicity is constrained to one side of the Kinabalu massif is still
unclear, with effectively no events detected to the south-west, west, or north of the exposed granite.
Focal mechanisms suggest ongoing extension in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu, with the seismicity
appearing to fall along a lineation oriented NNE-SSW, in fitting with a number of normal faults
mapped in the region. The 101 events with an ML > 2.0which account for a large proportion of
the seismic moment releasewere mostly focussed within a small volume at a depth of around
57 km depth, suggesting that ongoing slip on the fault system is confined to a narrow segment of
the fault surface. Continued monitoring of the region may provide further insights here.
10.4 Summary and further work 183
It is clear from the period of time in early March 2018, when the nBOSS network was being de-
ployed and only MetMalaysia data were available, that it would still be possible to detect and locate
a large proportion of the ongoing seismicity with the existing permanent seismic infrastructure.
This could help in the routine day-to-day monitoring efforts of the Kinabalu-Ranau fault network
and across northern Borneo in general.
While interesting in and of itself, this new catalogue has by no means been fully explored. These
first results indicate that it is worth exploring at least the following:
1. Developing an optimal 1-D velocity model through the inversion of a subset of events for
which high quality, manually refined phase arrivals can be made across the available stations.
The proximity of the seismicity to the Kinabalu granite and the underlying serpentinised
rocks may have a strong effect on the velocity model (and thus traveltimes and raypaths) in
the vicinity of the earthquake sources.
2. Performing relative relocations using cross-correlation to try to delineate the fault structures
on which the seismicity is occurring. This has proven to be an exceptionally powerful
technique when using the automatic phase arrival picks generated by QuakeMigrate (Winder,
2021), and may reveal as yet unseen features in the seismicity.
3. Recalculating local magnitudes using new locations and check whether the magnitude
residuals warrant the inversion of amplitude observations for a set of local magnitude
coefficients defining a Ranau-specific local magnitude scale.
4. Looking at the aftershock sequence captured by the MetMalaysia network following the
March 2018 ML 5.2 Ranau earthquake.
5. Applying shear-wave splitting analysis to the catalogue in order to investigate the structure
of the crust around the fault network.
Chapter 11
Perspectives on northern Borneo
The tectonics of northern Borneo have been the subject of research and debate for many decades.
The nBOSS project represents the first concerted effort to bring evidence from seismology (beyond
the active seismics used for exploration in the offshore region) to the table. The nearly two years of
continuous data recorded across Sabah have already begun to provide critical new answers to a
number of fundamental geophysical questions, such as How thick are the crust and lithosphere of
northern Borneo? (Greenfield et al., 2022; Linang et al., 2022; Pilia et al., 2021a) and Is there
seismic evidence for the subduction of the proto-South China and Celebes Seas? (Pilia et al.,
2021a). The first phase of results from this project have been summarised in Pilia et al. (2021a),
which draws together a number of strands of geophysical research and postulates the development
of a lithospheric drip as a means of explaining a number of enigmatic seismic observations and
several key features in the tectonic evolution of northern Borneo.
On the debate on the tectonic setting of northern Borneo, Hall (2013) wrote:
The history of research shows that there are many regions where the conventional
wisdom of regional compression has been replaced by interpretations involving ex-
tensional faulting and core complexes, but even in well-exposed areas, such as the
western United States, it has taken many years of painstaking observations to con-
vince doubters. This will undoubtedly be the case in the rainforest and inaccessible
mountains and valleys of northern Borneo.
While only small pieces of the puzzle, the results presented in Chapters 9 and 10 provide some
key lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that extensional forces have played an important
role in the historical, and ongoing, tectonics of northern Borneo. Namely, seismic anisotropy in
the lithosphere records and preserves large-scale deformation relating to phases of continental
convergence in the north-west and the opening and extension of an oceanic basin in the south-east,
while extensional faulting around Mount Kinabalu points to the gradual collapse of the orogenic
belt formed during the termination of the proto-South China Sea subduction. These observations
186 Perspectives on northern Borneo
align well with the current understanding of the tectonic evolution of northern Borneo (see timeline
in Figure 7.3) and highlight the need to consider all lines of evidencebe that geochemical,
geophysical, or geologicalwhen developing tectonic models.
With regards to other measures of the success of the nBOSS network, the high data recovery rate
(>97%, detailed in Chapter 8) is an impressive feat. This was only possible with the knowledge
and local expertise of our partners at the Universiti Malaysia Sabah and should be treated as a
framework for future seismic network deployments. The location of northern Borneo with respect
to global loci of seismicity means that the results presented here, particularly the teleseismic
shear-wave splitting study in Chapter 9, would benefit greatly from a deployment over a longer
timespan. The results from the long-deployed KKM station support this conclusion, as I am able to
explore further the potentially complex anisotropic structure beneath north-west Sabah. In addition
to this, I demonstrate in Chapter 10 that an even denser, targeted, and permanent network around
Mount Kinabalu has the potential to greatly improve the monitoring capabilities of MetMalaysia.
Indeed, there is still a great deal of information that can be learned about Mount Kinabalu, using my
earthquake catalogue as a starting point. A search for seismicity elsewhere in Sabah is underway,
with a preliminary catalogue produced for the Darvel Bay region (see Figure 7.6) that contains a
greater number of well-located earthquakes than in existing catalogues.
While a number of key seismic imaging techniques have been applied to the nBOSS dataset
alreadyincluding body wave tomography, receiver function analysis, two-plane wave tomogra-
phy, and teleseismic shear-wave splitting analysisthere remains plenty to explore. For example,
the determination of azimuthal and radial anisotropy through ambient noise imaging and surface
wave tomography could help tie together the observations presented in Chapter 9 and illuminate
the anisotropic structure of the lithosphere as a function of depth. Additionally, P-to-S receiver
functions can be analysed for evidence of seismic anisotropy within the portion of the Earth that
lies above the discontinuity at which the conversion occurs. The seismicity around Darvel Bay
and the curiously deep earthquakes beneath Sabah, as discussed in Chapter 7, also warrant further
exploration. For example, it would be interesting to see whether discontinuities within the mantle,
in particular the one at around 660 km depth, provide any evidence for cold material at similar
depths and locations to the deep earthquakes beneath northern Sabah. It is important to consider
and interpret not only different seismic observations concurrently, but also to integrate these ob-
servations with other geophysical, geochemical, and geological datasets, such as gravity, InSAR,
surface geology, and rock samples collected in the field. In particular, integration of the seismic
observations presented here with GPS observations would be an excellent way to better constrain
current deformation and develop a more holistic understanding of the modern day tectonics of the
post-subduction environment of northern Borneo.
This dataset has provided a step forward in our understanding of not just northern Borneo, but also
for our understanding of the termination phase of subduction. Given the relative paucity of such
settings, compared to active subduction zones, it is vital that we take this opportunity to assess and
take stock of the open questions before seeking to mine the data for answers.

A.3 Iceland network
The Iceland network has been in continuous operation since 2008, at times comprising over 70
instruments. The focus of the network has shifted over time, with the station locations shifting in
response. Below is a list of only those stations used in the studies presented in Chapters 4 and 5,
which does not cover those stations used to produce the original earthquake catalogue used. For
this, I refer the reader to Greenfield et al. (2020).

C.2 Event catalogue - 20062020
The additional catalogue used to make measurements of shear-wave splitting at the MetMalaysia
station KKM is also recorded here. However, as the original included over 1000 events (and thus
would take up approximately 24 pages), I have chosen to only reproduce here the catalogue of
events that produced usable measurements.
