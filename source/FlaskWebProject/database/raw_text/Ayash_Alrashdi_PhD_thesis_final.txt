Abstract
The next generation of particle colliders after the LHC (Large Hadron Collider)
at CERN are likely to be high-precision electron positron colliders such as the
ILC (International Linear Collider) or CLIC (Compact Linear Collider). This next
generation of colliders will give new scope to explore particle interactions in more
detail than in current accelerators. However, producing a sufficient numbers of
positrons is a significant challenge. One of the most difficult problems associated
with the production of positrons is designing a production target that will survive
in an intense photon beam while rotating at high speeds to spread out the energy
from the beam. In the first part of this thesis I present a solution to a torque
problem affecting the positron production target of high-energy electron-positrons
colliders. Typically, the target experiences a braking force due to immersing the
wheel inside a strong magnetic field to improve the capture efficiency for positrons.
Using OPERA 3D software, a large number of simulations were performed to
explore the movement of the target wheel inside the field. I developed a new
magnet design which could help to reduce the torque effects. I show that a decrease
in the torque parallel to the drive shaft from 500 Nm to 20 Nm is possible in
principle, while a torque of 10 Nm perpendicular to the drive shaft is predicted.
Also, the baseline design of the ILC (International Linear Collider) positron source
requires the production of an intense flux of gamma rays. In the second part of
this thesis I present an investigation of different magnetic field maps and the tra-
jectories of electrons passing through the undulator. I present an investigation of
using the spent gamma ray beam of the ILC for additional applications, including
nuclear physics. As a result of changing the collimator shape, as well as the pa-
rameters of the undulator magnets, I obtain spectra from numerical simulations
using the HUSR/GSR software package. I show that a narrow bandwidth energy
spectrum of 5% and photon flux of 1013 photon/s is possible in principle.

Introduction
1.1 International Linear Collider (ILC)
If it is built then the future International Linear Collider (ILC) will make a major
contribution to particle physics as a higgs factory and search for new physics.
The future International Linear Collider (ILC) will have a 200-500 GeV centre of
mass energy [1]. The ILC will be working with the Large Hadron Collider LHC [2]
(proton-proton collider) at (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland in a complementary
way to explore the deepest puzzles in this world. The planned design for ILC is
shown in Fig. 1.1.
As shown in Fig.1.1, there will be two linear accelerators facing each other with
a small crossing angle. The ILC will collide electron and positron beams each
carrying 1014 particles per second with a peak luminosity of 21034cm2s1. The
beams will gain energy from superconducting RF accelerator cavities, which work
at a very low temperature of  2 K, before they collide with each other at the
centre of the ILC. The RF cavities nominal accelerating gradient is 31.5 MV/m.
For each linac, 15 km of accelerating structures are required to accelerate the
particles to 250 GeV. The beams will have a width of 640 nm and a height of 5.7
nm at the collision point [3].
Chapter 1 Introduction 2
The electron linac contains a helical undulator insertion at the 150 GeV point for
positron production as described in more detail is section 1.5. After the electron
beam passes through the undulator, it will be accelerated again up to the beam
collision energy. For beam collision energies less than 150 GeV the electron beam
energy is alternated between 150 GeV for positron production and lower value for
collision. Then the electrons will pass through the beam delivery system (BDS),
which is a process of collimation and focussing of the beam to the small size need
at the interaction point(IP). The positrons from the positron source pass through
a transfer line to the start of the the positron linac to be accelerated.
The proposed parameters for the ILC are shown in table 1.1. The ILC should be
sensitive to new physics processes from supersymmetry or other extensions to
the Standard Model [1].

1.2 Gamma-Ray Sources
1.2.1 Introduction
Dedicated gamma-ray sources play an important role in nuclear physics and low-
energy particle physics experiments. Gamma-rays were discovered in 1900 when
Paul Villard investigated the radiation emitted from radium [4]. Gamma rays
are high-energy photons. Gamma decay from radioisotopes is a natural source of
gamma rays which also come from cosmic rays.
Man-made sources of gamma rays are widely used in many applications around
the world. The two most common sources will be explained briefly in the follow-
ing sections with a focus on the gamma-ray source based on undulators; current
gamma-ray sources will also be discussed in terms of photon flux and energy band-
width and I compare them later to the gamma rays which would be produced from
the ILC source.

1.2.2 Type of Gamma-Ray Sources
1.2.2.1 Synchrotron Radiation Sources
When charged particles go through a periodically varying magnetic field (undu-
lator) synchrotron radiation is emitted. This type of source is commonly used in
x-ray sources and there are several facilities around the world where this tech-
nique is used to produce an x-ray beam such as at the Diamond Light Source [5].
However, there has also been a demonstration of high-energy (gamma-ray) photon
production in a crystalline undulator [6]. The ILC, will use the first source of
gamma-rays produced directly by an undulator.
On the other hand, undulators already play an important role in current gamma-
ray sources such as the SPring-8 (Japan) gamma-ray source where they use an
undulator to produce x-rays. These x-rays are reflected back by a single crystal
and are scattered from an 8 GeV electron beam to produce the gamma rays. This
technique is called Backward Compton Scattering (BCS) [7]. Also, an undulator
is used in the HIS facility (USA) where the undulator is used to produce x-rays
from a Free Electron Laser (FEL); this is used later in Compton Scattering [8].
1.2.2.2 Compton Scattering Source
Gamma rays can be produced due to the interaction between an electron beam
and a laser at a certain angle. The first observation of Compton Scattering was
by Arthur H. Compton [9]. In 1963 inverse Compton Scattering was proposed by
Milburn [10]. The first experimental demonstration of inverse Compton Scattering
was accomplished one year later by O.F. Kulikov [11].
Since that time different Compton scattering sources using either x-rays or gamma-
rays have been designed and operated around the world. The most powerful
Chapter 1 Introduction 6
Compton source up to now is the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source HIS at
Duke University, USA. HIS has a total photon flux of 3  109 photon/s with
energy bandwidth (E/E) 5% [12].
A new Compton scattering gamma-ray source called Extreme Light Infrastructure
- Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) is being designed by an international collaboration
based in Romania. ELI-NP will have a narrow bandwidth . 0.5% with a total
photon flux of 8.3 108 photon/s [13].
1.3 Positron Sources
1.3.1 Introduction
Positrons can be produced by different sources naturally or experimentally. Naturally-
occurring positrons are produced in (+) decay, for example, the decay of magnesium-
23 into sodium-23,
12Mg 
11Na + e
+ + e. (1.1)
Another natural source is cosmic rays, which can produce positrons with very high
energy, but the flux is too low to be used in high energy physics experiments [14,
15]. For example, the flux of electrons and positrons with 10 MeV is approximately
30 m2s1sr1 [16].
Experimentally, in 1928 there was an article published by Paul Dirac [17] which
suggested that electrons have a positively charged partner. This led to the Bethe-
Heitler pair-production theory in which a photon converts to a e+/e pair [18].
The photon must have sufficient energy to produce the mass of the electron and
positron which have masses of 0.511 MeV/c2 each. Therefore, the photon must
Chapter 1 Introduction 7
have an energy higher than 1.022 MeV/c2 to produce a e+/e pair. Fig. 1.2 shows
the cross sections of a photon interacting in carbon and lead as a function of energy
[19]. This interaction takes place in the positron production process which will be
described in more detail in section 1.4.
Figure 1.2: The total cross sections of photon in carbon and lead as a function
of energy. The diagrams have been reproduced from [19].
Chapter 1 Introduction 8
1.4 Methods for Positron Production
1.4.1 Conventional Method
In these types of sources, an electron beam strikes a large Z target such as tungsten.
A bremsstrahlung photon is emitted by the electron. The photon converts to a
e+/e pair. Positrons are separated from electrons using a magnetic field. The
lifetime of the materials used in the target is limited by the injected amount of
energy. In 1998, the target of the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) failed due to the
large amount of energy which caused thermal stresses [20]. However, there has
been a recent study which may make this design feasible for the ILC by changing
the pulse rate of the electron beam striking on the target and with the addition
of an advanced cooling system for the target [21]. However, this method only
fulfils the requirement of an unpolarized positron source for the ILC, and more
investigations are needed into this method, including experimental work. I have
carried out a case study of the torque affecting the target of this method which is
described in appendix B.
1.4.2 Laser-Compton sources Method
In this method, a polarized positron is produced from a polarized photon. The
polarized photon is produced by the Compton scattering of an electron beam with
an energy of 1-3 GeV with a circularly polarized laser beam at a certain angle [22].
Then, this photon interacts with the target to undergo pair-production to produce
the positrons. A simple schematic representation of the Compton scattering for
the ILC is shown in Fig 1.3 [22].
Chapter 1 Introduction 9

source. This figure has been reproduced from [22].
1.4.3 Undulator Based Source Method
In this method, charged particles e.g electrons with high energy, go through an
undulator insertion device to produce high energy photons with high intensity
[23]. In order to obtain a polarized photon beam to produce a polarized positron,
a helical undulator is used [24]. This type of source was presented and explained
in 1977 [25]. The undulator based source was selected and investigated in more
detail for the TeV-Energy Super-conducting Linear Accelerator (TESLA) collider
project [26, 27]. A simple schematic diagram of this method is shown in Fig. 1.4
[28].
Chapter 1 Introduction 10
Figure 1.4: Layout of the method of producing polarised positrons from high-
energy electrons passing through helical undulator. This figure has been repro-
duced from [28].
A proof of principle experiment Experiment-166 [29] was performed in 2009 at
SLAC, where they used a 1 m long helical undulator to produce polarized positrons.
An electron beam with an energy of 50 GeV went through the helical undulator,
which produced circular polarized photons. Electrons and positrons are produced,
when the photons impinge on a metal target. This type of positron source is used
to produce polarized positrons and is planned to be used at the ILC [1].
1.5 The International Linear Collider Positron
Source
In conventional positron sources, such as the positron source of the Stanford Linear
Collider (SLC) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC) [30], they used
an electron beam striking on a thick high Z target as described in the previous
section. In 2005 [31], there was a study comparing the required flux for the ILC
and SLC positron sources, which found that the SLC positron flux is less than
what is required for the ILC positron source by a factor of 60, and the pulse
intensity is less than what is required for the ILC positron source by a factor of
Chapter 1 Introduction 11
1500 [31]. The required positron flux for the ILC is  3 1014 and the produced
positron flux at the SLC is  5 1012.
The lifetime of the target wheel is limited in conventional positron sources by
the heating caused by the large amount of injected energy into the target from
the beam. In addition to this beam-induced heating, there is eddy current heating
caused by the rotation of the target wheel in the magnetic field of the capture optics
[32]. The target wheel needs to be rotated to reduce thermal and radiation damage.
The use of this technology in the ILC positron may be possible by changing the
beam timing structure as mentioned in section 1.3, but this is potentially expensive
and still leads to an unpolarised positron beam. Therefore, it is generally believed
that designing a new positron source is required. The planned design for the ILC
positron source is shown in Fig. 1.5. The aim of the ILC positron source is to:
 Produce a photon beam with a high power from a helical undulator
 Create the necessary positron bunches in the Ti-6%Al-4%V target
 Guide and accelerate the beam up to 5 GeV
 Inject the beam into the damping ring. Try to minimize beam loss, decrease
the energy spread, and spin rotation before injection [33]
In Fig. 1.5, an electron beam with an energy of 150 GeV coming from the main
Linac is used in the positron source. This beam is sent through a helical undulator.
A helical undulator of 147 m length produces photons with energies of order MeV
when an electron beam with energy of 150 GeV passed though it; the average
energy of the gamma rays is approximately 10 MeV [3]. These photons hit a
rotating titanium target wheel. This produces positrons, electrons, and photons,
which go through a magnetic field; this is described as OMD (Optical Matching
Device) in Fig. 1.5 to focus the beam. This beam enters the capture rf (rf cavity
in a solenoid magnetic field). Later, positrons are accelerated, and detached from
Chapter 1 Introduction 12
the beam, while the photons and electrons are dumped. Finally, the positrons are
injected into the damping ring. A benefit of this design is producing a positron
beam with a polarization of 30%, as the ILC specification only needs unpolarized
positrons, but polarized beams increase the effective luminosity of the machine.
One of the difficult parts in the ILC positron source is the titanium target wheel,
which will be described in more detail in Chapters 3 and 4.

1.6 Thesis Outline
There are two main topics in this thesis; in the first part, the eddy current affecting
the movement of the ILC positron target wheel is investigated in more detail. In
the second part, the possibility of using the ILC gamma ray beam for additional
applications is investigated by studying the specification and characteristics of the
helical undulator magnetic field.
In chapter 2, the theoretical background of the eddy current brake is described
starting from Maxwells equations, as well as synchrotron radiation from an un-
dulator.
In Chapter 3 experimental validation work is presented which explores the genera-
tion of eddy currents in rotating discs and benchmarks the OPERA 3D simulation.
Chapter 4 covers the investigations of a new magnet design for the ILC positron
target wheel, which will help to reduce the torque affecting the movement of the
current design.
In Chapter 5, realistic simulations of the errors of the magnetic field of the ILC
helical undulator are presented. Also, their effects on the electron trajectory inside
the helical undulator and the resulting photon energy spectrum are discussed.
Chapter 6 covers the investigations of using the ILC gamma-ray beam for addi-
tional applications, including nuclear physics applications. This study involved
two different techniques to select useful energy spectra for different applications.
Finally, Chapter 7 gives the conclusions of this work and summarises possible
future work.
Chapter 2
Background Theory
In this chapter, I present an introduction to the theoretical background of two main
components of the ILC undulator-based positron source. Section 2.1 will describe
the physics behind a problem for the current baseline design of the ILC positron
source which is eddy current breaking. Section 2.2 will describe the background
physics behind the undulator.
2.1 Maxwells Equations
Maxwell proposed equations can be used for calculating electric and magnetic field
distributions. Maxwells equations are [34]:
~  ~E =
Gausss law for electric field (2.1)
~  ~B = 0 Gausss law for magnetic field (2.2)
~ ~E = 
Faradays law (2.3)
~ ~B = 0
~J + 0
Amperes law (2.4)
Chapter 2 Background Theory 16
Where, ~E is the electric field in volts/metre, ~B is the magnetic flux density, 0=
free space permittivity =8.85  1012 Fm1, and 0= free space permeability =
4  107 NA2.
2.2 Eddy Current
In my work, I am most interested in Faradays law which says : A changing
magnetic field induces an electric field [35]. According to Faradays Law, if any
conducting metal experiences any change of a magnetic field a voltage (emf) will be
induced in the conductor. There is no difference if the magnetic field is changing or
if the conductor is moving; the voltage will be induced generating eddy currents.
Also, there is a connection between Faradays law and Amperes law as an induced
eddy current loop will itself produce a magnetic field which will oppose the original
magnetic field and have effects towards reducing the torque when the conductor is
moving at higher speed as observed in [36]. This was confirmed in the simulation
which will be discussed in Chapter 4.
2.2.1 Eddy Current and Lorentz force
Here, we will derive the force due to changing the magnetic field. If we have a
conductor experiencing a change of a magnetic field, the voltage (emf) induced in
the conductor given by:
E = 
, (2.5)
where
d ~A  ~B(~r, t).
Chapter 2 Background Theory 17
is the flux of the magnetic field through the conductor, ~B is the magnetic flux
density,  is the total area and d ~A is the differential area vector of the loop.
Faradays law showed that, when magnetic flux changes with time, an induced
current starts to flow. Now, how did the charge move? The answer is due to the
induced (emf) which is defined as the work done per unit charge. We know that
work cannot be done by a magnetic field [35], so the work done must be due to
the electric field and as the electric field cannot be conservative in this case there
is a non-conservative electric field linked with an induced (emf) and given by:
(t)
d`  ~F/q, (2.6)
where
~E = ~F/q
is the electric field and the d` is a differential length element.
Now, we can compare Equation (2.5) and (2.6) to Equation (2.3).
The force is then given by the Lorentz force law:
~F = q ~E(~r, t) + q~v  ~B(~r, t). (2.7)
In Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2 I show examples of the eddy currents produced on the
current ILC positron source design due to immersing the target rim in a magnetic
field while the target is moving. This is discussed in more details in Chapter 3
and 4.
Chapter 2 Background Theory 18
Figure 2.1: The OPERA 3D model that I used for investigating the eddy
current problem. The solenoid magnet is shown in red, and the target is shown
in green.
Figure 2.2: The OPERA 3D simulation showing eddy current loops (in purple)
generated by movement of the target wheel (in blue) inside a constant solenoidal
magnetic field.
In the case of the eddy current brake the force is provided by the Lorentz force
which supplies a torque. The torque for a rotating solid disc experiencing a mag-
netic field parallel to the angular velocity vector has been derived in the literature
and is given by [37, 36]:
Chapter 2 Background Theory 19
 = 2D, (2.8)
where  is the angular speed,  is conductivity,  is the magnetic field total flux,
and D describes the affected area of the disc. A full treatment of this derivation
can be found in [36].
2.3 Undulator
The undulator is one of the main parts of the current design of the ILC positron
source. An undulator by definition produces a magnetic field which varies period-
ically. There are different types of undulator such as a planar undulator or helical
undulator. In a planar undulator the magnetic field is acting perpendicular to
the direction of the particle beam and forces the beam to oscillate in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field, which then radiates synchrotron radiation. In
a helical undulator there is a rotating dipole magnetic field. The strength of the
magnetic field is fixed. The motion of particles passing through the undulator is
also helical. The synchrotron radiation emitted is circularly polarised.
In this section, we will describe the radiation from the undulator, especially from
helical undulators. The physics behind classical electromagnetism and synchrotron
radiation can be found in [34, 38]. Full derivations of undulator synchrotron
radiation can be found in [23, 39, 40].
2.3.1 Synchrotron Radiation
From basic laws of classic electrodynamics, when relativistic charged particles
undergo acceleration they will emit electromagnetic radiation [34, 38]. Also, when
Chapter 2 Background Theory 20
the path of a relativistic charged particle is bent in a magnetic field synchrotron
radiation will be produced.
Charged particles lose power due to synchrotron radiation and this varies as:
2m40
. (2.9)
Here, m0 the particles rest mass, and  is the radius of the particles trajectory.
Lets consider a relativistic charged particle passing through an undulator with
period u. In the case of the co-moving frame, the electron will see the magnet
period as u/ because of Lorentz contraction where  is the relativistic Lorentz
factor given by:
, (2.10)
,  = v/c (2.11)
here, c is the speed of light, v is the speed of the electron,  is the electrons
relative velocity, E is the electron energy, and E0 is the electron rest energy.
The Doppler shift effect will change the frequency of light seen by an observer at
an angle  to the beam direction to:
f = f
1 +  cos 
. (2.12)
Here the observer is seeing the radiation at frequency f and f
is the frequency
emitted by the source. Converting f to wavelength , we have:
Chapter 2 Background Theory 21
 (1 + )
. (2.13)
The observed wavelength of radiation in the rest frame of the undulator is
Energy of a few GeV is achievable nowadays, therefore, the relativistic factor 
for electrons will reach a few thousands. For example, the wavelength of a few
nanometers can be achieved if an undulator with a period of 0.1 m was used.
Another feature of synchrotron radiation is that when  is of the order of few
thousands, the radiation will be emitted into a very narrow cone. When undulator
is used, additional narrowing of the cone will be added by a factor
N , where
N is the undulators period numbers and this is due to interference effects. This
implies that intense radiation with very short wavelength (few nanometers) can
be produced when an undulator is used in high energy accelerators.
2.3.2 Electric and Magnetic Fields Calculations
The Lienard-Wiechert potentials  and ~A for moving charges are: given by the
Lienard-Wiechert potentials:
 (t) =
1 ~  ~n

~A (t) =

) . (2.15)
Where:
q is the particles charge
r is the distance between the observation point and particles position
~n is the unit vector between the observation point and particles position
Chapter 2 Background Theory 22
~ is the particles velocity: ~ (t) =
R(t)
t is the retarded time where: t = t +
r(t)
To obtain the correct values of the potentials at time t, we need to evaluate
the particles velocity at a retarded time t. The electromagnetic potentials will
increase when a particle is traveling straight towards an observer, and is reduced
when the particle is traveling away from an observer.
Now, from Maxwells equations (2.2) and (2.3) we have:
~B =  ~A, (2.16)
~E = 
. (2.17)
where equations (2.16) and (2.17) represent the electric and magnetic fields in
terms of the potentials.
The derivations required to determine the electric field and magnetic field for a
particle moving along an arbitrary trajectory require manipulation of the formula
and standard algebra steps which can be found in [23, 39, 40]. The electric field
result is:
(1 2)
~n ~

)3 + ~n
~n ~

 , (2.18)
and the magnetic field result is:
~n ~E. (2.19)
Chapter 2 Background Theory 23
In Equation (2.18), in the case of no acceleration the second term will be zero, and
the contribution will be from the first term only. This is called the velocity field
and varies with the distance from the source as r2. The second term is called
the far field and varies with the distance from the source as r1. In the case of
accelerating particles, far from the particles, the second term will dominate over
the first term.
2.3.2.1 Poynting Vector
The rate of energy transferred per unit area by an electromagnetic field travelling
through space is given by the Poynting vector ~S:
~S = 0c
~E  ~B
. (2.20)
Now, by using (2.19), we can express the Poynting vector in term of the electric
field:
~n ~E
, (2.21)
~E2~n
~E  ~n
. (2.22)
As described earlier, in Equation (2.18), in the case of accelerating particles, far
from the particles, the second term will dominate over the first term. The far-field

~n ~
 ~
1 ~n  ~
 . (2.23)
By considering the far-field, we can rewrite the Poynting vector as:
~S (t) =
 ~E (t)2~n. (2.24)
because ~E is always perpendicular to ~n for the acceleration field:
E  ~n
~n ~
 ~
(2.25)
and therefore ~E  ~n = 0.
2.3.2.2 Radiated Energy Spectrum
The Poynting vector for the power flux is given by:
. (2.26)
Using Parsevals theorem [41] to solve for energy U radiated into unit solid angle:
Sdt =
|E (t)|2dt =
|E ()|2d. (2.27)
With respect to , we can differentiate (2.27) to find the angular spectral energy
distribution:
|E ()|2. (2.28)
Chapter 2 Background Theory 25
The factor of two comes from only considering positive frequencies.
The spectrum (frequency spectrum) of radiation can be calculated from the Fourier
transform of the electric field in the time domain. The frequency spectrum of the
~E(t) is therefore given by:
E () =
~E (t) eitdt. (2.29)
In order to find the Fourier transform of the electric field we substitute Equation
(2.23) into Equation (2.29) remembering that the integration must be evaluated
over dt as the fields are produced from the charge density at retarded time we
E () =
~n
~n ~
 ~
1 ~n  ~
)3 ei(t+ rc) (1 ~n  ~) dt

Supposing that the observer is far enough from the source, we can work in the
radiation region. By integrating Equation (2.30) by parts we get:
E () =
~n ~
ei(t

To find the energy radiated per unit angular frequency per unit solid angle, we
substitute Equation (2.31) into Equation (2.28) to get:

Chapter 2 Background Theory 26
2.3.3 Motion of electron in a helical Undulator
An electron is forced to oscillate and radiate if it passes through an undulator
(which is a magnetic field varying spatially periodically). The equation of force
for an electron is:
~E + ~v  ~B
, (2.33)
where ~p = m~v is the momentum,  is the relativistic factor, m is the mass of the
particle, and v is the velocity of the particle. Now, the radiated electric fields are
approximately weak so:
~v  ~B
. (2.34)
In the following we consider the magnetic field in the planes transverse to the elec-
trons initial velocity which I take to be z which vary sinusoidally. The magnetic
field in the z direction is zero, and we can define the magnetic field in the x and
y planes as:
Bx = B0 cos
, (2.35)
By = B0 sin
. (2.36)
Now, for the first order v ' vz, the Equation (2.34) for the x-directions motion
becomes:
= qvzBy, (2.37)
Chapter 2 Background Theory 27
B0 cos
, (2.38)
mdvx = qdzB0 cos
. (2.39)
Integrating both side with respect to dz = u
d(2z
mvx = qB0
. (2.40)
Therefore, the velocity of the particle is:
qB0u
, (2.41)
. (2.42)
where K is the undulator deflection parameter and given by:
qB0u
= 0.9337B0 (T )u (cm) . (2.43)
Now, to find the particles co-coordinate we integrate Equation (2.42):
x = 
. (2.44)
The velocity and coordinate of y can be derived in a similar way and the results
will be:
Chapter 2 Background Theory 28
vy = 
, (2.45)
. (2.46)
Now, the deflection angle  is given by:
, (2.47)
. (2.48)
The motion of the electron inside a helical undulator has been derived. In the next
section we combine the results from last two sections to calculate the radiation
emitted by an electron travelling through a helical undulator.
2.3.4 Radiation of the Helical Undulator
Using Equation (2.32) we can calculate the distribution of spectral energy of syn-
chrotron radiation from a given particles trajectory. In this case we are interested
in the helical undulator where the trajectory of the particles is a helix. The inte-
gration of Equation (2.32) requires more steps which have been performed in the
literature [42]. The result for the helical undulator is:

other terms in the expression are:

Eddy Current Experiment
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we introduce a simple, low-cost experimental setup that can be
used to study and demonstrate a principle to minimise eddy current braking, as
well as validating the OPERA 3D [43] software, which is a finite element electro-
magnetic simulation. In this experiment I considered the motion of a conducting
disc inside a magnetic field. I studied the effects of the magnetic field on the
movement of the disc as a function of different physical parameters. The disc was
made from aluminium.
3.1.1 Equipment
Fig. 3.1 is a photograph of the experiment setup. A list of all necessary elements
follows:

ground with aluminium disc behind it. The blocks on the left of the image act

3.1.2 Experimental procedure
 The disc was attached to the motor and rotated.
 The magnetic field is mostly perpendicular to the disc movement.
 First, I powered the motor to measure the maximum speed, then we discon-
nected the power supply to the motor and measured the speed (the 2-second
intervals are determined by the software) until the disc stopped moving.
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 35
 Then I added magnets into the magnet support structure one at a time and
repeated the measurements.
 I calculated the torque from the measured moment of inertia of the disc and
the measured deceleration.
3.1.3 Goals and Expectations
In order to find the torque produced by friction in the motor and air resistance, I
calculated the moment of inertia using:
MR2, (3.1)
where, I is the moment of inertia, M is the mass of the disc, and R is the radius
of the disc. Then, we can calculate the torque using:
 = I, (3.2)
where  is the angular acceleration and estimated using
. (3.3)
where t is the time between consecutive measurements and  is the corre-
sponding difference in the measured angular speed.
I repeated these steps when I added the magnets around the disc and then calcu-
lated the total torque  total. Later on, I subtracted the frictional component of the
torque from the total torque to find the torque produced by the magnetic field.
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 36
3.1.3.1 Stopping Time
I compared the time it takes for the disc to stop after reaching the maximum
speed when the motor is turned off with adding 1 magnet, 4 magnets, 5 magnets,
8 magnets, and no magnets. In Fig. 3.4, in particular we see the speed and time
increase when we add the fifth magnet, as a result of the cancellation of the eddy
current loops when they became close to each other.

Previous analytical studies (Smythe 1942, and Schiber 1974 [36, 45]) predict that
the torque should be proportional to the angular speed of the disc. Assuming this
and starting from Eq. (3.2) and Eq. (3.3) it follows that:
= b, (3.4)
from which it follows that

Fig. 3.5 shows good agreement with Eq. (3.8) in the case of 1, 4 and 5 magnets
and the relationship is linear. The fit of a linear slope which fitted to a function
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 38
of the form A+Bx shows that the 
/doF is close to 1. In the case of no magnets
and 8 magnets when the wheel feels less torque, we can see there is less agreement
with Eq. (3.8) (the 
/doF is approximately 1.8).
3.1.3.2 Braking Torque
Here I show the effects of the torque generated by the movement of the disc inside
the magnetic field. I used Eq. 3.2 to calculate the torque, and plot it against
the speed as shown in Fig. 3.6. We can see clearly how the torque increases
approximately linearly as a function of speed.
Figure 3.6: Torque plotted against speed for 4 magnets, 6 magnets, 8 mag-
nets, and no magnets as calculated from the rotating disc experiment. The
error bars show the statistical uncertainty and were calculated by repeating the
measurement 3 to 5 times.
Fig. 3.6 shows the best fit for the torque using this equation:
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 39
 = A2 +B + C (3.9)
where  is the speed, and from this slope we found the parameters of A, B, and
C. The parameters are shown in table 3.1.

Now, these parameters will help us to extrapolate the torque for different speeds
as shown in Fig. 3.7. However, the maximum speed when I started adding the
magnets was limited due to the eddy current effects. For example when we added
four magnets the maximum speed obtainable was 29.4 rad/s. By using Eq. 3.9 for
different speeds, and using the values of A, B, and C for each number of magnets
I obtained the results shown in Fig. 3.7.

sets.
According to the results in Fig. 3.7, Fig. 3.8, and Fig. 3.9, we can clearly see that
the torque reduces when we obtain a more uniform magnetic field (small magnetic
field flutter). This experiment demonstrates the general principle predicted in
previous theoretical studies. We can clearly see that when the magnets become
close to each others, the eddy current loops start to cancel each other. That leads
to a reduction in the torque acting against the movement of the disc.
3.2 Comparison between experiment results and
OPERA 3D Simulations Results
3.2.1 Solid Disc
Simulations were performed using the OPERA 3D software to test the results of
this experiment. An approximate model was designed to be similar to the one in
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 42
the experiment using OPERA 3D. Measurements of the magnet sizes, magnet dis-
tance from disc, magnetic field strength, etc were used in OPERA 3D model. The
aim of doing these simulations was to test how good the OPERA 3D simulation is
in these calculations, and up to what extent we are confident in our calculations.
The OPERA 3D approximate model used to simulate the experiment is shown in
Fig. 3.10. Fig. 3.11 shows the eddy current loops generated by the movement of
the disc inside the magnetic field.

Figure 3.11: Eddy current loops (in purple arrows) generated by movement

In the Fig. 3.12 I show the comparison between the results from the experiment
and the results from the OPERA 3D software simulations. Red dots represent
the simulated results and the black dots represent the experimental results. As
we can see, there is good agreement in general at a level of approximately 3%. I
think the small differences are mostly due to the results from the experiment as
the stability of the disc is less when the disc feel more force during its movement.
There is a visible vibration of the disc, especially, when the force became strong,
due to the large magnetic field. From the figures, the maximum torque achieved
was when we introduced the third and fourth magnet. The maximum torque was
0.0634 Nm when we introduced the third magnet and was 0.0746 Nm when the
fourth magnet was introduced. The reduction of the torque starts when the fifth
magnet was introduced and continues when we add more. Table 3.2 summarizes
the values of the slopes in the figures.

The largest

sented by the linear function.
3.2.2 Thickness of the Target Wheel
The thickness of the target wheel is an important factor in the eddy current prob-
lem. In this study, I used the model shown in Fig. 3.10 with a fixed magnetic
field with peak value  0.20 T, and fixed speed of 300 rpm. I set the thickness
of the target to 6 mm, 7.5 mm, 9 mm, 10.5 mm, and 12 mm to study the effects.
Fig. 3.13 shows how the torque increased as a function of thickness. The torque
increased linearly as expected which again confirmed previous studies [36, 45].

3.2.3 Spoked Wheel
In this section I present a small scale spoked wheel similar to the target wheel
designed for the ILC which will be discussed in more detail in section 4.2. I tested
the torque effects on the wheel experimentally and I compared the results to the
OPERA 3d simulations. Finally I related the results to simulations of the real
positron target wheel. The mini target wheel is shown in Fig. 3.14, and the
corresponding OPERA 3D model is shown in Fig. 3.15.

ground with the mini target wheel behind it. The blocks on the left of the image

simulation and the rim shown in light green, and the magnet showing in dark

blue, and the magnetic field is shown in purple.
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 48
In OPERA 3D software, I could not simulate the full model of the spoked wheel
due to the limitation of the licence. The results from the experiment are shown in
Fig. 3.16. It is clear that the rim wheel has a small torque compared to the solid
disc, and this is due to the small size of the eddy current acting on the rim wheel
compared with the solid disc.

On the other side, with no magnet, the rim wheel has a large measured friction

Now, by comparing these results to the OPERA 3D simulations for the model in
Fig. 3.15, we find large difference between them and the experimental results for
the spoked wheel  80%. This difference is due to the effect of the five spokes
in the actual experiment design, which we cannot simulate using OPERA 3D
software due to the limitation in our user licence as mentioned earlier. However, I
increased the rim size by 50%, 75%, and 90% to take this effect into account, and
to see whether we can get better results [46]. The results are shown in Fig. 3.18.

3.3 Conclusion
In this chapter I have developed a low-cost experiment to demonstrate the principle
of eddy current generation and validate the OPERA simulations. The torque
acting on the movement of the disc and the level of the accuracy of OPERA 3D
software are well understood. Good agreement and consistency with the previous
studies and theory of the torque problem is demonstrated.
I reduced the torque experimentally by making the magnetic field more uniform as
expected. When I compared the results from the experiment and the simulations,
there was good agreement (approximately 3%) between the experiment results and
Chapter 3 Eddy Current Experiment 51
the OPERA 3D software simulations. This give me the ability to carry out simula-
tions for the required parameters of the ILC target wheel with more understanding
of the simulation tool and their limitations.
I have investigated the relationship between the torque and the thickness of the
target, which was a linear relationship. Finally, I investigated the spoked target
wheel experimentally and it is clear that the torque acting on the movement of
the spoked target is very small compare to the torque acting on the movement of
the solid disc. Due to the limitations of the licence, I could not simulate the full
model of the spoked target wheel, but I increased the size of the rim to take into
account the effect of the five spokes.
Chapter 4
ILC baseline target wheel
4.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, I carried out a proof of principle experiment and a number
of simulations to study the eddy current effect on a rotating solid disc and a
spoked wheel. Experimentally, and using OPERA 3D software[43], I calculated
the torque produced from a magnetic field which affects the disc and the spoked
wheel movement. I added a number of magnets around the wheel to study the
effect of eddy currents. As expected I found that we measured less torque when
the magnetic field became uniform around the wheel. In this chapter I apply these
principles to the ILC baseline target.
4.2 ILC Target Wheel
As described early in the description of the ILC positron source, there will be a ro-
tating target wheel in which gamma rays are converted to electrons and positrons.
The target wheel will be a circular rim with 1 m diameter, approximately a thick-
ness of 0.4 radiation lengths, and 30 mm in a radial width. The target rim needs
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 53
to be rotated at a speed of 100 m/s  (2000 rpm) to reduce the thermal effects due
to the beam energy deposition, and make sure this target can survive for a long
time as the target is intended to last for two years. Titanium alloy Ti-6%Al-4%V
will be used to make the target wheel. The previous prototype constructed at
Daresbury Laboratory for the target wheel is shown in Fig. 4.1 [47]. In Table 4.1
the proposed parameters for the ILC target wheel are shown. The target wheel
will have a cooling system which will help to reduce the heating effects. This could
be done by providing an internal water- cooling channel inside the target wheel
[48].
Figure 4.1: ILC target wheel prototype. Target rim (yellow) immersed in pole
caps H-frame dipole magnet (two gray cylinders with the target wheel between
them). The motor used to rotate the wheel is shown on left (gray). The yellow
cylinder on the drive shaft is a torque transducer which was used to measured
the torque. This figure was reproduced from [47].
Any positrons produced will need to be focused by a solenoidal magnetic field,
otherwise we will end up with losing most of them, and this could lead to damage
to other equipment. Therefore, we need to introduce a solenoid magnet with a high
peak field approximately 6 Tesla just before the target and another one after the
target to allow us to have a continuous magnetic field to guide the positrons. This

solenoid magnetic field should reach 0.5 Tesla after the target to match the capture
section field when the beam reaches there. Introducing a solenoidal magnet will
increase the efficiency of capture more than 40% [46]. However, in the current ILC
TDR design [3] the solenoidal magnet has a peak field of 3.2 T which will not give
better capture efficiency than what is introduced here. There are problems raised
with this design due to the eddy current effects when the target wheel rotates and
is partially immersed in the field of the matching device. The force acts to stop the
target movement, and the corresponding heating effect can become a problem with
this design. Therefore, we must find a solution to solve these problems, otherwise
we have to change the entire design of the target wheel. Later in this chapter I
introduce the problems and solutions in details.
4.3 Target Simulations
Back in 2009 when the prototype experiment at Daresbury Laboratory took place
they used the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 4.2. We can clearly see that a
part of the target is immersed in a magnetic field. The target wheel was connected
to a torque transducer to calculate the torque acting on the wheel. A number of
simulations using the OPERA 3D code [43] were done, and a semi-analytical model
was used to calculate the estimated torque. The Opera model which was used is
shown in Fig. 4.3 [46].
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 55
Figure 4.2: Target prototype setup at Daresbury Lab [46].
Figure 4.3: Opera model which used for the comparison in the Daresbury
studies. The solenoid magnet is shown in red, and the rim is shown in green
[46].
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 56
A 10% agreement was found between the experimental results, analytical estimate,
and Opera calculations as shown in Fig. 4.4. The blue dots are the result from
Opera, red dots are the result from a semi-analytical estimate described later, and
the solid line is the results from experimental test (a quadratic fit to the data).
The results from these studies showed that there is a torque between 5 Nm to
13 Nm effect trying to stop the wheel due to eddy currents. Also, the simulations
showed the torque has a strong dependence on the radial width of the wheel. In
the experimental design there are five spokes. As in the studies shown in chapter
3 of the thesis, OPERA 3D can not test the full geometry, therefore, in the semi-
analytical estimate and OPERA 3D simulation, the radial width of the rim was
increased by 50% to give a good approximation to take in account the five spokes
which appeared in the experimental design. The target was rotated at speeds of
100 - 2000 rpm in a magnetic field with strength  0.485 T [46]. Also, several
immersions depths were tested showing that the torque increased from 5 Nm to
13 Nm as the wheel immersed between 20.25 mm and 50.25 mm [49]. I reproduced
the same model using OPERA 3D and the agreement is in a level of  5%. The
result is shown in Fig. 4.4.
Figure 4.4: The figure on the left is torque data results collected from the
Daresbury experiment (solid line), semi-analytical estimate (red dots), and
Opera simulation (blue dots) [46].The figure on the right is torque data from
my model reproducing the Daresbury work.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 57
I ran this model using the Opera simulation for the real parameters required for
the ILC target wheel. I increased the peak magnetic field up to  6 T, let the
target rotate at different speeds (  250 2000 rpm), and tested the radial width
of the rim for 30 mm and 45 mm. The magnetic field variation around the rim is
shown in Fig. 4.5. There is a big variation of the magnetic field around the wheel,
hence we will have eddy current loops. Results are shown in Fig. 4.6. According
to these results, we know for sure its not possible to have this design in ILC
target wheel, unless the value of B is very low (less than 1 T) where the torque is
 40 Nm.

4.4 New Simulation Results
4.4.1 Comparison between C Model dipole Magnet and
Solenoid Magnet
To validate my simulations, I started with a single C-magnet model. In this model
the target wheel will be immersed partially as it is in the solenoid magnet model.
I compared it with the previous solenoid simulations. Simulations were done for
both solenoid and C-model with a peak magnetic field  1.5 T and different ro-
tation speeds. The single C-magnet model and the eddy current generated from
it are shown in Fig. 4.7. I found a 5% agreement applies to the torque between
the result which I got from C magnet model simulation and the solenoid mag-
netic simulation, in terms of producing same eddy current loops and a torque of
 21 Nm acting against the target movement. The result is shown in Fig. 4.8.

red) and solenoid model (in black) at a peak magnetic field  1.5 T.
4.4.2 Torque vs. Increasing The Number Of C Magnets
Around The Target Wheel
From the results in chapter 3 we can see that if we make a uniform magnetic field
around the wheel then that will reduce the eddy current loops. In other word,
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 60
when there are two close magnetic field parallel to each others, the eddy current
loops will start to cancel each other and the net current will be zero. I did a
number of simulations to test this principle. I started to add C-magnets to the
model one at a time around the wheel, as shown in Fig. 4.9. Simulations were
carried out for rotating the target wheel at a speed of 300 rpm and magnetic
strength  0.97 T. The results from these simulations are shown in Fig. 4.10.
Figure 4.9: Target wheel immersed in 12 C-magnetic model. The numbers
around the outside of the image show the order of adding the magnets in each
simulation.

Figure 4.10: Torque effects, while we increase the number of C-magnet models
around the target wheel. The magnetic field strength  0.97 T, and the wheel
is rotated at 300 rpm.
Now, according to these results, we can clearly see that when the magnetic field
become more uniform, the torque in the z direction reduces to 1.3 Nm from a peak
value of  16 Nm.
I improved this model by connecting the C-magnets together by a thick iron ring as
shown in Fig. 4.11, which is my final design. Connecting the C-magnets with each
other leads to improving the magnetic field in terms of field variation. After joining
the C-models together, the torque in the z direction reduced to 0.09814 Nm from a
peak value of 0.99 Nm. The magnetic variation for the 12 C-magnet models before
joining each other, and the magnetic field variation after joining the C-magnet
models together, is shown in Fig. 4.12.

the wheel movement.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 63
4.4.3 Torque vs. Velocity
I used the model shown in Fig. 4.9, in a magnetic field with peak value  2.7 T,
and I increased the speed each time by 300 rpm. Results are shown in Fig. 4.13.
Figure 4.13: Torque behavior in a uniform magnetic field with peak value
 2.7 T, when the speed was increased by 300 rpm each time.
As we can see, if we have a more uniform magnetic field, when the target speed
increased each time, the eddy currents start to produce a magnetic field against
the main magnetic field. That leads to a reduction in the torque when the speed
keeps increasing. In 1942, a paper discussed a disc rotating in a non-uniform
magnetic field, and proved that, the torque reduced at high speeds [36]. In this
case, the wheel is rotating in a magnetic field with small differences, and we can
see this effect clearly.
4.4.4 Torque vs. Size of the rim
In this section, I am going to study the change of the rim size and whether this
has effects on the torque or not. In this study, I used the model shown in Fig.
4.11, a fixed magnetic field with peak value  1.5 T, and fixed speed 2000 rpm. I
changed the radial width of the rim for a different size ( 30 mm, 40 mm, 50 mm,
60 mm, and 70 mm ) to study the effects. Results are shown in Fig. 4.14.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 64
Figure 4.14: Torque in the z direction when the rims radial width size change.
As we saw the torque keeps increasing when the size of the rim is increased. This
agrees with the results from the previous Daresbury studies [36].
4.5 Final Model
4.5.1 Introducing The Solenoid Field To The Model
In the ILC positron design, we mentioned that there must be a magnetic field
to focus the positrons when they are produced from the target. So, we need to
introduce a solenoid field to our final C-magnet design to allow focusing of the
positrons. An OPERA model with a solenoidal magnet and the simulated field
variation after introducing the solenoidal magnet are shown in Fig. 4.15 and 4.16
respectively.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 65

magnetic introduced. The magnets are shown (in red), target rim (in light

at a fixed radius of 0.485 m, with the wheel, when solenoid magnetic introduced.
Where z is the direction perpendicular to the wheel movement.
4.5.2 Semi-analytical Model
Now, I use a semi-analytical model of the target to compare it with my simulation
results. The aim of this semi-analytical model is to give an understanding of the
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 66
physics and to see if the results from the simulations are correct or not. Following
the same argument as used in reference [46] I assume that there is a metal bar
with a cross-section immersed in a magnetic field (parallel to the z direction)
and moving at constant velocity (in the x direction) as shown in Fig. 4.17. The
direction of movement is parallel to the bars length. The magnetic field strength
varies as a function of position. The edges in z and y directions have lengths az
and ay respectively.
Figure 4.17: Targets semi-analytical model moving in a magnetic field.
The targets rim is represented by this bar. I am ignoring the circular motion in
this model, as the radius of the target wheel is much larger than the dimensions
of the rims cross-section. In this model I calculate the force acting against the
wheel movement, but in order to find the force, the eddy currents produced in this
bar must be calculated. Because of the movement of the metal bar in a magnetic
field, there will be a voltage induced in y direction as shown in Fig. 4.17. The
induced voltage will vary as a function of x, because the magnetic field strength
varies as a function of x. The voltages shown in Fig. 4.18 are:
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 67
E.dl = 
Blvdt
= Blv. (4.1)
Just set l = ay here, and B = Bz.
By taking the difference between the voltage at two points in the x direction, and
y = ay , and a small distance dx in the x direction, we will have:
dxay. (4.2)
Because the voltage varies linearly with y, we can find the current density J as a
function of y through :
J(y) = 
y. (4.3)
The total current dI in a thin slice in this bar with height dy along the full width
az of the bar is given by:
dI(y) = J(y)azdy = v
azydy. (4.4)
There will be a closed current loop. So, consider the current flowing in the y direc-
tion, and the magnetic field in the z direction acting on this current. According to
the Lorentz equation, there will be a magnetic force in the x direction as a result
of this, given by:
d2Fx = (Bz)xdI(y)2y  (Bz)x+dxdI(y)2y = 2
dI(y)ydx. (4.5)
Substituting from Eq. (4.4) this becomes:
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 68
d2Fx = 2v
2dydx. (4.6)
To find the total force acting on a small distance of the bar with a length of dx, I
sum over the force produced by currents at all y positions of the bar:
dFx = 2v
 ay/2
y2dy = 
ydx, (4.7)
and integrate over the remaining length of the bar to find the total force:
Fx = 
vaza
dx. (4.8)
If there is uniform field in the z and y directions, az and ay can be combined to
get the volume integral:
Fx = 
va2y
dV. (4.9)
Finally, the torque is given by:
 = rFx = 
r2a2y
dV. (4.10)
Where  is the conductivity of the material, and =v
. Note that Fx is in an
opposite direction to the targets movement [46, 50].
Now I apply in Eq. (4.10) to the model used in the OPERA 3D simulation, to
see if it does give the same result. In our case the conductivity of the Ti-6%Al-
4%V is 5.8 105 1m1 [46]. The rim has a width ay of 30 mm, and revolution
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 69
frequency of 2000 rpm  100 m/s. I did the integral using the simulated magnetic
field shown in Fig. 4.18, and obtained:
 0.009496 T2m. (4.11)
Using this result in Eq. (4.10) gives   20.65 Nm, which is within  2% of the
result from OPERA 3D.
Figure 4.18: The simulated magnetic field variation as a function of angle
around a specific area where there are differences in the field. The angular
speed of the wheel was 2000 rpm.
4.5.3 Matching solenoid field
The solenoid magnetic field should reach 0.5 Tesla after the target to match the
capture section field. In the proposed design, we need the magnetic field to start
from the targets downstream face at approximately 5 Tesla and decrease to 0.5
Tesla at a distance around 40 cm from the targets downstream face. In this case,
it is a matter of changing the distance of the solenoid magnet from the target
wheel and changing the strength of the magnetic field. The dependence of the
magnetic flux density in the z direction is shown in Fig. 4.19.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 70
Figure 4.19: Magnetic flux density curve in the z direction in the region
between the target rim, and capture rf cavity.
4.6 Torque transverse to the drive shaft
Torque transverse to the drive shaft could cause stress on bearings or feedthroughs.
Our initial studies indicate that there is a torque around x and y because of the
fringe field of the C-model pole cap. In the C-magnet model without the solenoid
magnet, I increased the size of the pole caps, and observed that the torques around
x and y both reduced. So, the torque around x and y can be removed either by
increasing the size of the pole cap or by shaping the edge of the pole cap [51].
When I introduce the solenoid magnetic field, there is no way of reducing the
torque transverse to the drive shaft without having gaps between magnets and
some changes of the field. In my final design shown in Fig. 4.15, the simulations
give the torques in table 4.2.
Table 4.2: Torque from final design [Nm]
Direction Torque [Nm]
X 13.063
Y 10.751
Z 20.416
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 71
As we know the definition of the torque is :
~ = ~r  ~F , (4.12)
which implies that
x = (Fzry  Fyrz )i. (4.13)
The force is given by
~F = Q( ~E + ~v  ~B) = ~I  ~B, (4.14)
Fz = (ByIx BxIy)k. (4.15)
In Fig. 4.20 I show a closer picture of the current flowing inside the target wheel.
Figure 4.20: Direction of current flowing inside the target wheel. Explain
what we seeing of torque
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 72
From Eq. (4.13) a torque in the x direction is due to a force in the z or the
y directions. Because rz is very small I ignore the second part in Eq. (4.13).
Now, from the definition of the force acting in the z direction in Eq. (4.15), there
must be either magnetic flux in the y direction and current in the x direction or
magnetic flux in the x direction and current in the y direction.
Figure 4.21: Magnetic flux in the x direction shown on the left, and current
flux in the y direction shown on the right. Blue indicates the -ve sign, and
purple indicates the +ve sign. The orange line shows where the magnetic flux
and currents flux were measured as described below.
As can be seen from Fig. 4.21 there is a small area on the target rim where the
magnetic flux and current flux are both large. I measured the strength of the
magnetic field and current flowing in this small area by getting the average value
along a line as shown in Fig. 4.21. The results are shown in Fig. 4.22.
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 73
Figure 4.22: Magnetic flux strength in the x direction shown on the left, and
current flux strength in the y direction shown on the right.
x = Fzry  21.8 0.5  10.9 Nm
Do similar to Fz on the left we get:
x = Fzry  22.6 Nm
x = 11.3 Nm, Which is close to the result from OPERA 3D (the difference between
them is less than  5%).
Figure 4.23: Magnetic flux in the y direction showing on the left, and current
flux in the x direction showing on the right. Blue indicates the -ve sign, and
the purple indicates the +ve sign.
y = 11.67 Nm. Which is close to the result from OPERA 3D (the difference
between them is less than  5%).

4.7 New proposed prototype
I produced a new design for the target wheel prototype using solidworks 3D soft-
ware [44]. In this model, I am trying to show the final design for the positron
target wheel with the C-magnet model in a realistic layout. It seems achievable
and is not complicated. In this design, I havent considered the infrastructure
needed to support, power, and cool the magnets. Which, of course, need some
participation from engineering groups. The proposed new prototype is shown in
Fig. 4.24.
Figure 4.24: The proposed new prototype for the ILC positron target wheel.
As shown in the picture, the light brown is the motor used to rotate the target
wheel, the two big cylinders are solenoidal magnets (in dark red), the C magnets
with coils (red) and a connected yoke (light grey) are shown surrounding the
wheel (green).
4.8 Conclusion
The target wheel is on the critical path for producing a viable positron source for
the ILC. As the positron flux needs to be high, this target needs to be rotated
at a speed of 2000 rpm to reduce the thermal effects coming from the photon
beam. Also, this target needs to be immersed in a strong magnetic field to focus
Chapter 4 ILC baseline target wheel 75
the produced positrons. Due to the movement of the target wheel in a strong
magnetic field there are eddy currents providing a strong force against the wheels
movement. In this study I explored the torque effects in detail, and using OPERA
3D simulations I found an alternative arrangement of magnets to minimise the
braking torque.
The torque in the previous prototype was approximately 500 Nm, when the wheel
rotates at a speed of 2000 rpm, with rim radial width of 30 mm, and is par-
tially immersed in a strong magnetic field with a peak of approximately 6 T. I
introduced C-magnets around the target wheel to make the magnetic field more
uniform. When the C-magnets were introduced around the wheel, the torque was
approximately 20 Nm corresponding to a power loss of 4.19 kW. However, as men-
tioned earlier this is not the TDR design. The immersed high-field capture optics
give an improved capture efficiency for the positrons, but the TDR design uses a
lower field, with less immersion and a pulsed magnetic field.
Also, I studied the torque transverse to the draft shaft. I found that the torque
around the x and y directions are caused by the fringe field of the solenoid magnet.
The torque around x was 13 Nm, and around y was 10 Nm.
This is not a fully engineered design, but shows that this approach to reducing
the eddy currents while increasing the positron capture is worth pursuing in the
future.
Of course, in this design the C-magnets would need to be compact superconducting
magnets. Also, I have not considered the infrastructure needed to support, power,
and cool the magnets.

Undulator Magnetic Field and
Electron Trajectory
In section 2.3.3 the ideal magnetic field of the helical undulator was described
theoretically. The trajectory of the electron beam inside the undulator determines
the details of the gamma ray spectrum. Errors in the magnetic field cause the
electron trajectory to be off-axis and could in an extreme case lead to beam loss. I
developed a code using Mathematica [52] to generate a magnetic field map based
on the Fourier power spectrum of any measured field map to investigate this effect.
In the ILC case to achieve the required gamma-ray flux from the ILC helical
undulator, the electron beam needs to pass through a long helical undulator (ap-
proximately 147 m) successfully. This undulator contains 84 modules of length
1.7825 m. A dipole magnet can be used to correct the beam in between the mod-
ules to redirect the beam to the center of axis. Errors in the field can alter the
flux, energy distribution and polarisation of the gamma rays.
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 77
5.1 ILC Helical Undulator
There are different design for the positron sources of future electron positron col-
liders [53]. As described in the introduction the undulator source has been chosen
as the ILC baseline. The undulator baseline source will produce more positron flux
than a conventional source. For example, the SLC positron flux is a factor of 60
less than the flux required in the ILC positron source, and the pulse intensity is a
factor of 1500 less [31]. Moreover, in the conventional source there are limitations
of thermal stress as explained in previous chapters. Another benefit of using the
undulator baseline source is the possibility of producing polarised positrons.
In this section we will describe the helical undulator which is an important com-
ponent of the ILC positron source baseline. The parameters of the ILC helical
undulator from the ILC design report and constructed prototype are showing in
5.1 [3, 54].
Table 5.1: ILC helical undulator parameters [3, 54].
Parameters Values
Undulator period 11.5 mm
Number of Periods 155
Magnetic field 0.88 T
Value of K 0.92
Average energy of photon 10.5 MeV
Total length 147 m

An electron beam with energy of 150 GeV will travel through the 147 m long helical
undulator and has a period of 11.5 mm [3, 54]. The magnetic field strength of the
undulator is  0.88 T on axis [54]. The beam of the electron will travel in a
helical path along the undulator central axis. An intense gamma-ray beam will be
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 78
produced with  10 MeV at the 1st harmonic. The gamma-ray beam produced by
the ILC helical undulator will have  131 kW average power.
5.2 Helical Undulator Magnetic Field Map
In this section, I will investigate the magnetic field map of the helical undulator
in three types of maps: ideal map, measured map, and simulated map.
5.2.1 Ideal magnetic field map
As stated in section 3.3.3, equations (5.1) and (5.2) describe the magnetic field
inside an ideal helical undulator,
Bx = B0 sin
(5.1)
By = B0 cos
(5.2)
where B0 is the field strength, z is the distance along the primary axis of the
undulator, and u is the period size. In HUSR/GSR software [55, 56] which will
be discussed in more details in section 6.2, the electron is injected at an angle of
3.2 106 rad in the y plane to ensure the electron exits the undulator on axis.
5.2.2 Measured magnetic field map
There were two field maps measured from the ILC prototype undulator modules
using a Hall probe on-axis [54]. Imperfections in the magnet winding or deforma-
tion of the magnet former lead to errors in the field. The measured field map
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 79
is tapered to ensure that the electron will stay on the centre of the undulator if
injected along the centre.
5.2.3 Simulated magnetic field map
In order to produce a magnetic field map based on a measured field map. I
introduced error in the magnetic field strength as well as in the period size over
the length of the undulator along the z direction.
I added the errors shown in equations (5.3) and (5.4) to the value of the period
size and well as to the field strength respectively in equations (5.1) and (5.2).
(z) =
Ai cos
Bi sin
, (5.3)
B(z) =
Ci cos
Di sin
. (5.4)
I vary the n, which is the number of fourier component until we obtain good agree-
ment with the measured data. Ai, Bi, Ci, and Di are pseudo-random numbers,
uniformly distributed between (ptop) where p is also varied to obtain a good
agreement. The best agreement was found when n = 200, and p = 7.14 108. I
used u + (z) and B0 + B(z) in equations (5.1) and (5.2) instead of u and B0
and we have new equations:
Bx = (B0 + B(z)) sin
(u + (z))
, (5.5)
By = (B0 + B(z)) cos
(u + (z))
. (5.6)
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 80
The model ensures the simulated map will not have a discontinuity. I compared
the Discrete Fourier Transform of the x-projection of the magnetic field within the
undulator for the measured data and simulated data to tune the model.
Fig. 5.1 shows a comparison between the Discrete Fourier Transform of the x-
projection and y-projection of the measured field map and the simulated field
map. The B(z) and (z) used in Eq. (5.5) are identical to the the B(z) and
(z) used in Eq. (5.6) for both the x and y projections. From the peak which is
around 155 periods, we can determine the period length to be 0.0115 m.

5.3 Tracking the electron inside the Undulator
5.3.1 Ideal field map Tracking
In the ideal case, the electron will feel an average magnetic field strength of zero
and will transported through the undulator with a total deflection of zero. For an
electron injected on axis the movement of the electron will be helical according
to Kincaid equation (2.49). Fig. 5.2 show the position of the electron on x and
y axes. The average radius is 3.21907  106 m and the standard deviation is
8 1012 m.

deviation in x is 2.5 106 m and in y is 3.7 106 m. Fig. 5.4 shows the full

5.3.3 Simulated Field Map Tracking
In the simulated field map case, when we used equations (5.5) and (5.6) after
introducing the optimized errors in magnetic strength and period the electron will
experience similar errors to the types of error in the measured magnetic field map.

To cover all possible trajectories of the electron inside the undulator, we simulated
20 different modules of undulator. The plot of all their position in the x direction
is shown in Fig. 5.7, and Fig. 5.8 shows a band representing +/- 1 standard

viation as calculated from 20 simulated field maps.
The standard deviation in x at the end of a module is estimated to be 1.75106 m.
The standard deviation in y at the end of a module is estimated to be 1.5106 m.
Next I introduced a new situation where B(z) and (z) used in Eq. (5.5) are
not identical to the the B(z) and (z) used in Eq. (5.6) for both the x and y
projections, which will be the worst scenario as the errors are not correlated. The
modules have same values of n = 200, and p = 7.14  108 but different random
number sequences. Fig. 5.11 shows a comparison between the Discrete Fourier
Transform of the x-projection of the measured field map and the simulated field
map. Fig. 5.12 shows a comparison between the Discrete Fourier Transform of
the y-projection of the measured field map and the simulated field map.

In this case, where B(z) and (z) used in Eq. (5.5) are not identical to the the
B(z) and (z) used in Eq. (5.6) for both the x and y projections, the deviation
of the electron is still in the acceptable range and is consistent with the previous
trajectories. Therefore, the effect can be neglected in these simulations.
5.3.4 Realistic Beam Spot Size and Divergence
In this section, I simulate tracking a beam with a realistic beam size. To simulate
the beam spread I generated pseudo-random initial position and divergences in x
and y using a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation given by the values:
x = 3.7 105 m, y = 2.4 106 m, x = 0.9 106 rad and y = 0.06 106
rad [57]. I used tapering in both, the ideal and measured field maps. I used 5
different sets of initial coordinates to get an indication of the size of this effect.
In the case of the ideal field map, the standard deviation due to including a realistic
beam distribution in x at the end of a module is estimated to be 2.9 105 m and
2.8106 m in y which is consistent with the starting beam spot size. In addition,
the standard deviation in x at the end of a module is estimated to be 2.6105 m
and 3 106 m in y for the measured field map case which is consistent with the
starting beam spot size.
5.4 Conclusion
In this chapter, I have discussed the possible types of undulator magnetic field
as well as the trajectories of the electron beam inside them. Specifically, there
are concerns about the errors in the magnetic field and how these can affect the
transportation of an electron beam through the undulator. Errors in the magnetic
field cause the electron trajectory to be off-axis and in an extreme case the beam
could be lost.
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 91
To deal with these concerns, we simulated the trajectory of the electron beam
inside the measured magnetic field of the ILC helical undulator prototype and
developed a software tool using Mathematica to generate a magnetic field map
based on the error from any measured field map.
Based on these simulations, the trajectory of the electron inside the measured
field and simulated maps will have maximum deviations from axis of the order of
tens of microns. Since the deflection of the beam size is less than the real beam
spot size, this deflection should be controllable. There was a good agreement
between the simulated field maps with errors and measured field map in terms
of the calculated electron trajectory. The maximum spread in x at the end of
the simulated modules is 6.7  106 m, and in y is 5  106 m. The standard
deviation at the end of simulated modules is estimated to be 1.75  106 m in x
and 1.5 106 m in y.
In addition, I investigated the worst-case scenario when the errors in the magnetic
field in x and y are not correlated. I found that the trajectory did not change much
and the effect is negligible. Moreover, I injected the particles randomly in different
angles and positions using the real parameters of the beam size to study the effect
on the trajectory of the beam. For the ideal field map case, the standard deviation
in x at the end of a module is estimated to be 2.9 105 m and 2.8 106 m in y
which is consistent with the starting beam spot size. In the case of the measured
field map, the standard deviation in x at the end of a module is estimated to be
2.6 105 m and 3 106 m in y which is consistent with the starting beam spot
size.
Carrying out prototype experiments to evaluate the trajectory of the electron
and spectrum is very expensive. By evaluating the trajectory of the electron and
spectrum using a numerical code with a high accuracy and realistic simulated data
I hope to turn this initial study into a rigorous investigation [58]. The spectra from
Chapter 5 Undulator Magnetic Field and Electron Trajectory 92
ideal, measured, and simulated field maps will be presented in the next Chapter
and will be discussed in more detail.
Chapter 6
Gamma-rays Studies at Future
Intense Positron Sources
6.1 Introduction
Gamma rays sources such as HIS [12] and ELI-NP [59] are used to investigate
different research topics such as nuclear physics. The baseline design of the ILC
positron source requires the production of an intense flux of gamma rays, but only
7% [28] or less of these gamma rays will be used to produce positrons, and the
rest will pass to the photon beam dump.
Modern gamma ray facilities try to obtain a high photon flux with a narrow
energy bandwidth, and the ILC baseline design already has a much higher flux of
7.8  1016 photon/s but the bandwidth is broad as the spectrum contains many
harmonics. To match the dedicated gamma ray facilities in terms of bandwidth,
I developed two techniques to optimize the bandwidth by designing a collimator
aperture for a collimator that would appear downstream of the positron production
target. Simulations for an idealised undulator show that the beam could exceed
the current flux produced from HIS (Duke University) [60, 61] by several orders
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 94
of magnitude reaching 1013 photon/second with a bandwidth of 5% where the
bandwidth of HIS is in a range of 4% to 10%.
Moreover, I used the HUSR/GSR [55, 56] described in section 6.2 to investigate
the gamma-ray energy spectrum coming from simulated and measured helical un-
dulator magnetic fields with errors as described in the previous chapter.
The study of the energy spectrum from the undulator is a very important char-
acteristic in my case as I am trying to use this beam for additional applications,
for example, nuclear physics applications. However, it is not critical for positron
production as only the flux is needed for the positron production. Therefore, I
can make some changes to the spectrum whose effects are fairly small as shown
from previous studies where the number of captured positrons does depend on
high energy gamma rays in the higher harmonics [62, 63].
6.2 HUSR/GSR Software
The HUSR/GSR software packages were originally developed at the Cockcroft
Institute of accelerator science and technology by David Newton [55, 56] to calcu-
late the synchrotron radiation output from a helical undulator as included in the
ILC baseline design but GSR can be applied to a much wider range of magnets.
The code tracks particles trajectories inside the undulator system using Lie maps,
which are produced by numerically integrating the Hamiltonian of an electron in
the magnetic field [64, 56]. Each Lie map represents a small step in the undu-
lator period i.e. a Lie map is a transfer map where each map will give the new
coordinates of a particle in phase space. In this thesis each Lie map used 106
integration steps. This allows us to track particles inside any magnet system with
high accuracy. In HUSR/GSR software after tracking the electron(s), we set ob-
servation points at the end of the undulator. HUSR/GSR calculates the retarded
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 95
potential from the electron(s). Then, from the retarded potential it calculates the
electric field at each observation point as a function of time. Finally, the frequency
spectrum of the observed radiation is obtained by Fourier transforming the field.
The HUSR/GSR software gives us the ability of including errors in the undulator
magnetic field as well as tapering as shown in Fig. 6.1. Tapering the field is
important to ensure that the electron beam will be injected in the centre of the
undulator. The accuracy of HUSR/GSR software has been tested by comparing
the results of the energy spectra of HUSR/GSR to the energy spectra of the
Kincaid equation (2.49) [42], and the result is shown in Fig. 6.2 where they agree
at the level of 1%. Simulations of the ideal helical undulator were calculated using
100 equal sampling steps along the trajectory using the Lie map, and the radiation
spectrum was calculated in 1000 energy bins of equal size over the range 0.2 MeV
to 200 MeV. The beam was injected on axis at an angle which ensured that the
beam exits the undulator on axis and there is no tapering in the ideal field map in
this case. However, both ways are equivalent and ensure that the beam will travel
along the central axis of the undulator.
In the ideal case, the Lie map for one period was generated and then used 155 times
to give the total length of the undulator. In the realistic case, which will be used
in my investigations later in this chapter, I increased the steps in the Lie Map to
15000 steps to obtain higher accuracy, as well as increasing the observation points.
The increase in sampling points and observation points was needed because in a
real undulator each period is different than the other in terms of the magnetic
strength and the length.
Fig. 6.3 shows the accuracy for tracking of the electron through the ideal helical
undulator using 10, 100, and 1000 steps along the trajectory.

10 steps are used along the trajectory the energy spectrum is clearly inaccurate
after the first harmonic peak.
6.2.1 HUSR/GSR Observation Points
The default positions of HUSR/GSR software observation points are shown in
Fig. 6.4 for low resolution. It possible to increase the points to have a higher
resolution. The black points are the actual points at which the electric field is
calculated, when HUSR/GSR calculates the total flux. Each point represents a
ring of equal area as shown in the diagram. This technique is accurate as long as
the photon flux is produced azimuthally symmetrically.
I tested the accuracy of this method to obtain the highest accuracy for the ideal
case. Fig. 6.5 show the total flux as a function of the number of observation points.
We can see that the calculated flux saturates after 3000 points and the total flux
was 1.2851031 photon/s. Also, I tested the code for a full square aperture where
each sampling point represents square on a square grid, and increased the points
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 98
until the calculated flux saturates after 9000 points and the total flux was 1.291
1031 photon/s. Both of these analyses were done for the ideal case, and there is a
small difference in the total flux between the two methods  0.006 1031, which
is probably due to the extra area which is covered by the square aperture.
However, the assumption of azimuthal symmetry does not hold when I use the
realistic magnetic field. The result of simulating the spectrum from a realistic
(measured) magnetic field is shown in Fig. 6.7. From Fig. 6.7, we can see clearly,
that the photon distribution is not symmetric, therefore, I have used the the full
square aperture with 10000 points for all the remaining simulations presented in
this chapter.

6.2.2 Additional Features to HUSR/GSR Observation Points
Following on from previous work [63] I have extended the observation point algo-
rithm as shown in Fig. 6.8. For this new feature each point represents a segment.
This segmented pattern will give more accurate results from photon distributions
which are not azimuthally symmetric. The number of points in the radial and
azimuthal directions can be configured.

In addition it is possible to simulate an annular aperture using the same idea as
above but excluding a central circular region.
6.3 Spectra from Measured and Simulated Mag-
netic Field Map
In this section, we will calculate the energy spectrum from the three types of
undulators, which were discussed in more detail in chapter 5. Fig. 6.9 shows the
output of the energy spectrum from an ideal undulator system and the measured
undulator system as previously described in chapter 5. Table 6.1 show a summary
of the important differences between the energy spectrum from the ideal field map
and the energy spectrum from the measured field map. I have used the parameters
of the magnet system shown in table 5.1 to evaluate the spectra. These parameters
were used in my calculations for the simulated model as well.

Measured (no beam spot) 2.486 1033 7.011 1016 /s
From table 6.1, we can clearly see that the total flux has reduced by  9% overall
but only by  2% on the first harmonic. These reductions are due to the errors
in the measured field map.
I used the simulated field map in the HUSR/GSR software to investigate the
output spectra and compare the results to the results from the measured field

As we can see there is a very good agreement between the two spectra at a level
of 2%. Based on this result, I simulated 20 models to produce a range of realistic
spectra. Fig. 6.11 shows the average photon energy spectra with a band repre-
senting +/- 1 standard deviation obtained from the 20 models from our simulated
field maps. This gives an estimate of the range of the deviation of the spectra
which is at a level of 3% compared to the ideal spectrum.

6.3.1 Realistic Beam Spot Size and Divergence
Here I calculated the spectrum from injection of the particles with realistic beam
spot size and divergence. For the ideal map, Fig. 6.13 shows a band representing
+/- 1 standard deviation of the spectrum from 5 particles injected at random
positions in phase space into the ideal field map.

Ideal (with beam spot) 2.426 1033 7.281 1016 /s
Simulated (no beam spot) 2.317 1033 7.085 1016 /s
By comparing these values to the ideal spectrum with no beam spot, I found a
reduction by  4% of the peak height on the first harmonic and by  6% for the
total flux in the case of the ideal field map. By comparison there is a reduction
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 108
by  8% of the peak height on the first harmonic and by  9% for the total flux
in the case of the simulated field map.
Table 6.3 show a summary of the important differences between the energy spec-
trum from the ideal field map shown in Fig. 6.13 and the energy spectrum from
the measured field map shown in Fig. 6.14 using a realistic beam spot size in both
cases.
Table 6.3: Summarized table of important difference between the measured
and ideal energy spectrum using a realistic beam spot size.
Parameters Average peak height Average total flux
(1stharmonic) (A.U.)
Ideal (with beam spot) 2.426 1033 7.281 1016 /s
Measured (with beam spot) 2.381 1033 6.929 1016 /s
By comparing these values to the ideal spectrum with no beam spot as before, I
found a reduction by  4% of the average peak height on the first harmonic and by
 6% for the average total flux in the case of the ideal field map. By comparison
there is a reduction by  6% of the average peak height on the first harmonic and
by  11% for the average total flux in the case of the measured field map. Overall,
the injection of the particles with realistic beam spot size has smaller effects than
the errors in the magnetic field on the energy spectrum and the total flux.
Previous studies of earlier designs of the ILC undulator [62, 63] showed that the
number of positrons captured and injected into the positron damping ring strongly
varies depending upon which harmonic of the undulator spectrum is being con-
sidered. For example, the first harmonic contributes only 7% of the total positron
yield, whereas the second, third and fourth each contribute around 18%. Using
this data along with the modified energy spectra from this work suggests a drop
in positron yield of  7% compared to the ideal case.
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 109
6.4 Possible Use of the ILC Gamma-ray In Ad-
ditional Applications
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, only 7% or less of the gamma rays beam
for the ILC positron source will be used to produce the positrons. Therefore,
we could consider introducing a small secondary facility as shown in Fig. 6.15.
This small facility can be placed in the region of the photon beam dump of the
current baseline design for the ILC positron source to utilise the otherwise wasted
photons for additional applications, e.g nuclear physics or a facility for testing
particle detectors using gamma ray.
To utilize this beam, there are different applications for the high intensity gamma-
ray beam from different scientific fields such as nuclear physics or industrial appli-
cations [65]. One of the most important fields is nuclear physics and they required
narrow bandwidth energy spectrum to carry out their experiment such as Nuclear
Resonance Fluorescence (NRF) technique [66]. However, even if the spectrum at
the ILC cannot be made to be very narrow by collimation the gamma-ray beam
could still be an important facility to be used for additional applications rather
than the production of positrons only; as there are different useful gamma-ray
facilities around the world which still have a very large bandwidth such as the
bremsstrahlung spectrum of the Stuttgart Dynamitron [67]. Fig. 6.16 shows the
high-energy gamma-ray beam sources ( 10 MeV) around the world with the
improvement of their energy bandwidth over the years [68]. As a result of this
investigation two general techniques were developed to obtain a useful energy
spectrum from the ILC spectrum by defining a collimator aperture. More details
of these two techniques will follow in the next section.

Figure 6.16: High-energy gamma-ray beam source ( 10 MeV) around the
world with the improvement of their energy bandwidth over the years. This
figure was reproduced from [68].
Possible additional applications for the ILC gamma-ray beam could include:
Industrial Applications Using the ILC gamma-ray in industrial applications
such as to treat and manage nuclear waste [69].
Instrumentation A gamma-ray beam with this high flux can be used as a testing
facility to test detectors, dosimeters, gamma-ray lenses, etc [65].
Nuclear Physics Photon induced particle emission at high energy can provide
important details of the collective Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) structure
and damping [65].
Medical Isotopes Production Gamma-ray can be used to produce radioiso-
topes for nuclear medical applications through e.g photonuclear reactions or
photoexcitation reactions. The beam does not need to be narrow to pro-
duce useful isotopes [70], but a beam with a high flux and narrow energy
bandwidth could open the door to produce new isotopes [71].
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 112
Second Production Target A recent study showed that in principle this beam
could be used to produce more positrons to increase the total positrons flux
[72]. I could propose using this gamma-ray beam to strike on additional
target to produce positrons for different applications e.g positron-positron
colliders.
6.5 Obtaining the Required Energy Spectra From
the Undulator System
In this section I discuss two techniques to help to automatically detect the posi-
tions of the observation points which give spectra in accordance with the users
requirements. The adapted HUSR/GSR software produces the location, shape,
and size of the collimator aperture which will give spectra close to the required
spectra. We can produce the required spectra from any field map. In this study,
the ILC electron beam with 150 GeV travelling through the measured field map of
the ILC helical undulator is used as an example to evaluate these new techniques
and see the possibility of having a narrow beam from the ILC gamma-ray beam.
There is no guarantee that the resulting collimator aperture can be physically
constructed.
6.5.1 First Technique
I have used the measured field map in calculations to find a narrow bandwidth
spectrum. The method of this technique is explained in the following steps:
1. Design the required spectra (from user).
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 113
2. Select those observation points which have a spectra which lies fully under-
neath the design spectra or is exactly equal to the designed spectra in every
energy bin.
3. Based on the selected observation points a collimator aperture can be de-
fined, which gives the spectrum which is close as possible to the required
spectra.
Fig. 6.17 shows the comparison between a narrow design spectrum peaked at the
first harmonic energy and the resulting spectrum.

6.5.2 Second Technique
The following steps were used in this technique:
1. Design the required spectra from users requirements.
2. Calculate the chi-squared for each individual observation point spectra com-
pared to the required spectra using Eq 6.1:
 (OS  ARS)2
(6.1)
where, OS is the observed spectra, RS is the required spectra, and A is the
normalization (the total flux of the required spectrum divided by the total
flux of the observed spectrum).
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 115
3. From chi-squared one can tune the selections of points and control the band-
width e.g choosing the points which have small chi-squared is useful, because
the difference between the required spectra and the produced spectra is very
small, but choosing the points with large chi-squared will increase the band-
width of the energy spectrum.
4. Based on the selected observation points a collimator aperture can be de-
fined, which gives the spectrum which is close as possible to the required
spectra.
Fig. 6.19 shows the comparison between the design spectrum and the result spec-
trum. Fig. 6.20 show the distributions of the observations points based on the chi
square results, where closer to zero is better. I varied the value of chi-squared till
I found good match with the design spectrum. I selected the values of chi-squared
which is less than 0.15. I can choose smaller chi-squared which will result to a
narrower bandwidth.

A comparison between the two collimated energy spectrums is shown in Fig. 6.22.
As we can see the first technique has a narrow bandwidth 5% which is better than
the second technique  7%. But the flux peak height from the second technique
is  1.9 1033 photon/s which is better than the first technique  1.35 1033

6.6. The possibility of construction the required collimator will be discussed in
section 6.7.

6.6 Obtaining a Narrow Bandwidth From The
ILC Gamma-ray Beam
In this section, by using the two techniques which are described earlier, I inves-
tigate the possibility of obtaining a narrow bandwidth spectrum from the high
intensity gamma-ray beam which is required for the positron source production.
In the previous section one module of the helical undulator was used. As de-
scribed earlier, 84 modules will be used for the ILC helical undulator. Therefore,
each module will have a different spectrum due to the error in the magnetic field.
These techniques will produce different collimator shapes for each module, so de-
signing a single collimator which is optimal for every module is not possible.
In order to investigate this in systematic way, I used 20 simulated magnetic field
maps of the helical undulator which has the required parameters of the ILC. I
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 119
simulated the output from an electron beam with a 150 GeV energy travelling
inside each of these 20 maps. The two techniques described in section 6.5 were
used to obtain the required collimator shape for the narrow bandwidth spectrum.
The description of the method will be described in the next steps:
1. Produced 20 different collimator apertures which will fulfil and give the re-
quired spectrum.
2. Each aperture is described by a list of observation points. I used 0 to indicate
an observation point selected as a hole in the collimator and 1 to indicate
that it will be solid material.
3. I sum over all the 20 apertures for each observation point. For example for
a specific observation point if the sum is zero that means this is a hole for
all the 20 simulated models.
4. I plot a histogram of the results showing the number of times each observa-
tion point fails the condition.
A histogram of the results from the first technique showing the number of times
each observation point fails the condition in is shown Fig. 6.23. Selected observa-
tion points which fail the criteria less than fifteen times are shown in Fig. 6.24.
Fig. 6.25 shows the collimated narrow bandwidth spectra which is obtained.

In the second technique I followed these steps to select the aperture shape:
1. Produced 20 different collimator shape which will fulfil and give the required
spectra individually for each of the 20 simulated undulator modules.
2. For each module, each observation point is assigned a value between 0 to
1 of chi-squared as described earlier. In our case, smaller values meet the
condition and larger values near to 1 indicate not meeting the condition.
3. I sum over all the conditions status, for example a specific observation point
if the sum is small or close to zero thats mean this is a common area for all
the 20 simulated modules or most of them.
4. I plot a histogram of the results showing the number of times each observa-
tion point fails the condition.

values which will result in a narrower bandwidth. Fig. 6.28 shows the collimated

From comparison we can see the second technique has more flux than the first one
while the first technique has a narrower energy bandwidth. From the comparison
between these two techniques we can see there is a common area in both of them.
Using these two techniques, I have been able to determine the an idealised colli-
mator shape corresponding to the required spectrum. The possibility of designing
a similar shape in a real experiment is of course very challenging. The code gives
us the ability to choose any required energy bandwidth, but the values chosen in
this initial study are comparable with other nuclear/gamma-ray facilities.
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 125
6.7 Possibility of Constructing The Required Col-
limator
From the parameters of the ILC, the helical undulator magnetic field is 0.88 T.
A high energy photon with an average energy of 10 MeV will be produced for
the first harmonic from the electron beam which passes through this helical un-
dulator. This electron beam will have 5 pulses per a second and each pulse will
have 2625 bunches. There will be approximately 2 1010 electrons in each bunch.
7.8  1016 photons per second will be produced when this electron beam travels
through the 84 modules of the undulator, where each module is 1.7825 m long.
Therefore, the ILC helical undulator will produce an average photon beam power
of approximately 131 kW.
The average power which will be deposited in the collimator produced from the
first technique is about 108 kW, and in the collimator produced from the second
technique is about 69 kW. The current ILC collimator design showing that the
power deposition in the collimator is in a range of 70 KW to 90 KW [73]. The
current ILC collimator made from pyrolytic graphite, titanium, iron and tungsten
and has an aperture of 1.4 mm radius with a length of 190 cm [73]. Therefore,
the power which deposited in the second collimator is reasonable compared to
the power which is deposited in the photon collimator which is in the current
ILC design and sits before the positron-production target in order to protect the
target station and control the polarisation of the positrons [73]. One could consider
designing a collimator with contain different stages, for example, at the first stage
the outer beam could be collimated then the collimator could be narrowed in the
second stage to select a narrower beam, and so on. In this way we could spread
the power of the beam and minimize the effect on the collimator. The radius of
the proposed collimators is in a range of 0.8 mm to 1.2 mm which is a challenging
and would required more investigations.
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 126
6.8 Conclusion
In this chapter, I have explained the HUSR/GSR software and discussed the new
features which I added to it. I investigated the energy spectrum produced from
three types of helical undulator magnetic field: ideal, measured, and simulated.
The photon flux produced from the measured map is less than that produced from
the ideal map by  9%, which is due to the errors in the magnetic field. There
was good agreement between the spectrum produced from the measured field map
and the spectrum produced from the simulated field map at a level of 2%. Also, I
studied the energy spectrum produced from 20 simulated maps and the deviation
was at a level of 3%.
Moreover, I studied the deviation of the energy spectrum produced from injecting
the particles randomly in different angles and positions according to the expected
spread of the beam in the undulator, where I found that in the ideal field map case,
the average peak height on the first harmonic reduced by 4% and by 6% for the
average total flux. In the measured field map case, the average peak height on the
first harmonic reduced by 6% and by 11% for the average total flux. Therefore,
the effects of using the realistic beam spot size is fairly small compare to the errors
in the magnetic field map. The expected reduction in flux from considering the
effects of finite beam size and realistic errors in the undulator magnetic field could
be compensated for by optimising the beam trajectory through the undulator or
if required increasing the undulator length to approximately 160 m.
In addition, I have discussed the possible additional applications of the ILC gamma
ray source to use the otherwise-wasted beam. Two general techniques were de-
veloped to produce the collimator shape which fulfills the required spectra from
users. Although, it is still not clear where it is possible to build such collimator
and further investigations are required.
Chapter 6 Gamma-rays Studies at Future Intense Positron Sources 127
Based on these results, I believe there is a good chance that the spent ILC gamma-
ray beam could be put to good use. ILC gamma-ray beam produces a flux which
could exceed the best current flux produced from HIS (Duke University) [60, 61]
by several orders of magnitude reaching 1013 photon/second with a bandwidth of
Chapter 7
Conclusion and Further Study
The ILC positron source requires a high-intensity gamma ray beam in order to
produce the required positron flux. The target will need to rotate to spread out
the heat coming from the beam. The torque generated by eddy currents affects
the movement of the target due to the AMD optic which is a major challenge for
the ILC current baseline design. To overcome this problem, experiment and simu-
lations using the OPERA 3D software were performed to validate the OPERA 3D
software, investigate this problem and to test a proof-of-principle magnet design.
I obtained good agreement between the results from the eddy current experiment
and the OPERA 3D software at the level of 3%.
A novel magnet design was designed to reduce the torque acting on the target
movement. A solution for the torque was performed experimentally and by simu-
lations. This new magnet design is a big improvement and has shown a significant
reduction of the torque. If this novel magnet design is to be built in the future, fur-
ther study is required towards the infrastructure including, powering, and cooling
the magnets.
The trajectory of the electron beam inside a perfect ILC helical undulator was well
understood and studied in more detail. In order to understand the effects of the
errors inside the ILC helical undulator, a general semi-analytical model was used
Chapter 7 Conclusion and Further Study 129
to generate a realistic magnetic field and to evaluate the electron trajectory inside
the ILC helical undulator as well as the energy spectrum. After investigating
more than 20 simulated helical undulator field maps, the deviation of the electron
is predicted to be of the order of ten microns 4.0106 m, and has  10% of effects
overall the energy spectrum. Therefore, this is reasonable and in acceptable range.
The ILC photon beam has a flux of 7  1016 m. Most of this beam will not
be absorbed by the target. Therefore there is a demand to utilize the otherwise
wasted beam. In order to investigate the possibility of using this beam, I presented
possible additional applications for this beam, which will not require any addition
modifications towards the beam. Moreover, I included an investigation which
resulted in the development of two general techniques to calculate a collimator
aperture from the user requirements. For example, a narrow bandwidth energy
beam might be required. There is good output from those techniques regarding
producing the required energy bandwidth of 5%, but further investigations to
study the possibility of building such collimators are required.
Investigating the track of many particles through the undulator by injecting the
particles using the realistic beam spot and size to estimate the effect of the en-
ergy spectrum would be an open field for future research. Also, the errors in
the magnetic field caused a spread in the electron beam trajectory, therefore the
polarizations of the beam will also be affected and could be investigated.
Appendix A
Simulations for the ILC
conventional source
As mentioned earlier in the introduction, there is a recent study which makes
the conventional positron source feasible for the ILC by changing the pulse time
structure of the electron beam striking on the target and induces an advanced
cooling system for the target [21]. Here I present a simulation to study the effect
of the torque on the target due to immersing the target partially while rotating at
the proposed speed of 250 rpm.
The slowly rotating target consists of a 30 mm rim of tungsten and a 170 mm
radius disc of copper. The thickness of the target is 14 mm. I used a solenoidal
magnetic field with a peak field on the target of approximately 0.55 T. Due to the
difficulties of simulating the two parts of the target with different conductivities
in the OPERA 3D software, I simulated each part separately. To arrive at an
estimate I simulated:
 A W rim with 30 mm width
 A solid W disc with a radius of 170 mm
 A solid W disc with a radius of 200 mm
I then simulated the same 3 scenarios for Cu. Table A.1 shows the results:
Based on these numbers I estimate the torque acting on the W-Cu target to be
in the range 10.8 Nm to 18.8 Nm (calculated from firstly a 200 mm solid disc of W

0.28 kW and 0.49 kW.
I have checked the results of the torque in the two rim simulations against the
simplified semi-analytical model Equation 4.10, and the results agree at the level
of 10%.

Gamma-ray Flux and Energy
Distributions on Target
In this section, I present the flux distribution and the average energy distribution
on the target from three types of helical undulator magnetic field: ideal, measured,
and simulated realistic field, which was explained in chapter 5. It is very useful to
know how flux and the energy distribute on the target. This will help to know how
much energy will be deposited in the target or the collimator and the locations of
this energy.
Fig. B.1 shows the flux distribution from the ideal helical undulator magnetic
field, and Fig. B.2 show the average energy distribution on target from the ideal

From table B.1, we can clearly see that the total flux for both measured and
simulated field maps have reduced by  10% overall. In addition, the average
energy has reduced by  10% in the case of the measured field map and by  6%
in the case of the simulated field map. These reductions are due to the errors in
the measured and simulated field maps.
