Abstract
This thesis presents the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section using
data collected in 2010 by the ATLAS detector, with a particular focus on the
reconstruction and calibration techniques used for jets in this measurement
and on the estimate of the systematic uncertainty on their energy scale. The
inclusive jet cross section measurement is used as input to fits of parton
distribution functions. Although the PDF analysis in this thesis is preliminary
and its main purpose is to serve as a proof of principle for future studies,
improvements in the knowledge of the gluon density are observed thanks to
the inclusion of ATLAS data.

There are many people to whom I am indebted. First of these is my supervisor, Amanda Cooper-
Sarkar. She has been incredibly supportive when I have needed it, and at the same time has given me
the freedom to pursue work of my own choosing. Much of the work in this thesis was influenced by
Tancredi Carli, whose encouragement, guidance and approachability during my time at CERN made
much of this thesis write itself.

Personal contributions
Due to the large nature of particle physics experimental collaborations, the work
in this thesis relies on the results of a large number of individual researchers and
analysis subgroups. Leading contributions by the author presented in this thesis are
outlined below, subdivided by thesis chapter.
Chapter 4: Jet reconstruction performance The author has performed jet en-
ergy resolution studies for low pT jets and validation of calibration constants
in Monte Carlo before central processing of data for various software releases.
These studies have been performed using the JetPerformance software,
written and deployed over the course of the first year of this D. Phil. program.
Chapter 5: Jet Energy Scale Uncertainty The author has been the main author
of the Monte-Carlo based analysis for the estimate of the jet energy scale
uncertainty, and has combined the final results and delivered them to the
collaboration using a centralised software tool.
Chapter 6: Inclusive Jet Cross Section The author has performed cross-checks
of Monte Carlo and data spectrum (for selected data runs), validated the final
data and theory spectra and uncertainty values, and partecipated actively to
the discussion on the correlation of uncertainties to be treated as nuisance
parameters.
Chapter 7: Impact of ATLAS jet data in PDF fits The author has adapted
the ZEUS PDF fitting code to include ATLAS data, and has performed
a PDF analysis for the evaluation of the impact of ATLAS jet data on the
PDF. Cross-checks with the fitting code from the H1 experiment have also
been performed.

Introduction
The first months of proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV delivered by
the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS experiment have provided data to
probe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at scales never reached before. While precision tests
of strong interactions are interesting in their own right, QCD also provides one of the main
backgrounds to many New Physics measurements; furthermore, it is also through tests of QCD
that New Physics may be discovered. Hadronic jets are a fundamental ingredient for precision
tests of QCD: understanding and measuring their performance starting from the very first data
is crucial in the LHC environment. This thesis presents the measurement of the inclusive jet
cross section using data collected in 2010 by the ATLAS detector, with a particular focus on the
reconstruction and calibration techniques used for jets in this measurement and on the estimate
of the systematic uncertainty on their energy scale. PDF fits have been performed comparing
the inclusive jet cross section data to theory. Although the PDF analysis performed within this
thesis is preliminary and its main purpose is to serve as a proof of principle for future studies,
improvements in the knowledge of the gluon density are observed thanks to the inclusion of
ATLAS data.
After a brief introduction on the theoretical framework of the Standard Model of Particle
Physics and QCD in Chapter 1, the ATLAS detector is described in Chapter 2. Chapters 3
and 4 are devoted to understanding the treatment of jets and measuring the performance of
their reconstruction in the Monte Carlo simulation and in data. A correct estimate of the energy
of jets (jet energy scale) is input to many physics analyses, and the uncertainty on this estimate
is the dominant experimental systematic for many QCD measurements and for the inclusive
jet cross section measurement. The estimate of the jet energy scale uncertainty for the first
ATLAS data is described in Chapter 5. As detailed in Chapter 7, the inclusive jet cross section
measurement described in Chapter 6 is used as input to fits of parton distribution functions
to improve the knowledge of the gluon PDF and estimate the value of the strong coupling
constant.
Chapter 1.
Theory framework: QCD
The theoretical framework of particle physics is called the Standard Model (SM). The SM is a
SU(3) SU(2)U(1) gauge theory, describing the strong (QCD), weak and electromagnetic
interactions respectively. It describes the interactions of the fundamental components of matter,
quarks, leptons and gauge bosons, according to three of the four forces in nature. Measurements
of the Standard Model parameters have confirmed the theoretical predictions to increasing
precision, but evidence that new physics phenomena are needed to extend the knowledge of the
fundamental components of matter could be found at the LHC.
This chapter outlines the theoretical framework that underlies the measurement described in
this thesis, and the tools used to simulate hadron interactions for the theoretical predictions
used for comparison with the measurement. An overview of the Standard Model in terms
of the electroweak interactions is given in Section 1.1. A brief description of the Quantum
Chromodynamics concepts used in this thesis follows in Section 1.2. Section 1.3 introduces the
concept of jets as tools to obtain predictable and measurable quantities and the motivations
to measure the inclusive jet cross section. Finally Section 1.4 outlines the theoretical and
computational tools used for the simulation of hadronic interactions.
1.1. Introduction to the Standard Model
The Standard Model is the theoretical framework that describes strong, weak and electromagnetic
interactions between fundamental particles (see [1,2] for a concise introduction and further
references). It is a non-abelian gauge theory: the transformations of the symmetry group do not
commute in the case of the QCD and weak groups. Gauge invariance, defined as the invariance
of the theory under local transformations, is a fundamental property of the theory. Gauge
invariance defines the particle content of the Standard Model (as shown in Figure 1.1), as the

and mass. Figure from [5].
quanta of the gauge invariant fields are identified with the five gauge bosons. These are the
photon, the gluon, the W+/ and Z and they act as mediators of the forces. A consequence of
the non-abelian character of the theory is that the gauge bosons for the QCD and weak forces
enjoy self-interactions. In addition to the gauge bosons, the Standard Model is composed of 12
fermions of spin 1/2, grouped in three lepton and three quark families. These are considered
point-like, as there is no evidence of any internal structure of leptons or quarks to date. The
mass of the Standard Model particles can be introduced using the Higgs mechanism [3, 4]
through spontaneous symmetry breaking that leads to the appearance of a new boson. The
Higgs boson has not yet been observed, and its discovery is sought by the general purpose
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.
1.2. Key concepts in Quantum Chromodynamics
Quantum chromodynamics is the theory of strong interactions. Its fundamental actors are
quarks and gluons, which are confined in the nucleon but act as free at sufficiently small scales
(and high energies). The latter behaviour is called asymptotic freedom. The direct consequence
of confinement is that free quarks and gluons are never observed experimentally, and their final
state is a collimated shower of hadrons.
The development of QCD was posterior to that of QED: while the latter was highly successful
in the mid-Sixties, no information about the components of the nucleons was available, and
strong interactions were commonly described using general principles and the exchange of
mesons [6] although the basis for theories that could eventually accommodate QCD had also been
developed [7]. A framework called Eightfold Way [8] had been developed to organize subatomic
baryons and mesons into octets. Its connection to an underlying pointlike structure of hadrons
came after the so-called heroic age of deep inelastic scattering measurements interpreted using
the parton model [9]. These experiments and subsequent interpretations showed that the probes
scattered against pointlike, spin 1/2 constituents of the nucleons that are the quarks (some
relevant papers are collected in Reference [10]). The presence of spin 1 gluons was also inferred
using kinematic considerations in terms of the total momentum shared by the quarks. The
QCD equivalent of the electromagnetic charge for QCD is the colour charge: (anti)quarks can
take three (anti)colours (red, green and blue and their counterparts) while the eight interacting
gluons exist in a superposition of colour and anticolour states.
SU(3) QCD was established as a theoretical framework for strong interactions only following
the discovery of asymptotic freedom as a consequence of the theorys renormalisability [11].
These concepts will be explored further in the following section. Only a brief overview of the
concepts and formulas directly used in this thesis is given, while more material is available in
the references quoted.
1.2.1. Asymptotic freedom and confinement
Gluons in QCD are massless, therefore the theory contains divergences that manifest themselves
as infinite results in theoretical cross section calculations. A renormalisation procedure is
necessary in order to allow the theory to give meaningful (non infinite) results that can be
compared to the experimental measurements. This is achieved by effectively subtracting these
infinities through counterterms embedded in so-called bare parameters that are not measurable.
The renormalisation procedure introduces a correction to the renormalised parameter depending
on the renormalisation scale R (that can be interpreted as the scale at which the subtraction
is made) and on the physical scale at which the measurement is made, taken as the squared
momentum transfer Q2 in the following. Imposing the independence of the final result (all
orders of perturbation theory) from the renormalisation scale allows one to derive an explicit
form for the renormalised parameter1. As an example of a renormalised parameter, the strong
coupling constant is shown in Equation 1.1:
1The dependence on R is still present when truncating the theoretical calculation at a given order: this
introduces an uncertainty on the theory predictions.
1 + s(
R)0 ln(Q
2/2R)
. (1.1)
The coupling constant, initially scale-invariant, becomes a function of the scale of the process:
the common terminology used is that the coupling constant runs with energy. The theoretical
and experimental results for the running coupling constant s as of 2009 are shown in Figure 1.2.
Contrary to QED, where the coupling constant increases with the scale of the process (Q2 in
Figure 1.2), gluon self interactions lead the 0 function to be negative. The coupling constant
therefore is sizeable at low Q2 (leading to confined partons) and decreases as a function of Q2
(leading to asymptotic freedom).
Asymptotic freedom and confinement are therefore deeply linked to the gauge structure of
QCD that leads to gluon self interactions. This was demonstrated by Gross and Wilczek in
1973 [12,13], and recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2004.
Figure 1.2.:2009 world average of running coupling s (from [14]).
Confinement and asymptotic freedom have relevant experimental consequences: quarks and
gluons require interactions with high energy probes to be ejected from the nucleon, and they
cannot be observed directly. What one detects instead of quarks and gluons are collimated
showers of particles. These particles are the product of a series of steps, summarised as follows
in the case of a hadronic collision event following Reference [15]:
1. Two hadrons (that can be seen as bags of partons as in the parton model) collide with a
large momentum transfer;
2. Two partons (called incoming partons) from the hadrons collide and produce the hard
process, leaving behind other partons (outgoing hadron remnants) and the products of
other secondary collisions (multiple interactions).
3. Since electromagnetic and color charges interact, the incoming and outgoing partons
can radiate (e.g. a quark can radiate a gluon). These processes can be described using
perturbative QCD as outlined in Section 1.2.2.
4. When partons are sufficiently far from each other, the coupling becomes strong and
confinement plays a part. Being a non-perturbative process, the behaviour of the color
force in this situation cannot be described using first principles in QCD. A simplified
picture models the color force as that in a string with a linearly rising potential as charges
become separated. The two extremities of the string are the opposite color charges. If
the string is extended too much, it will break and create two additional color charges
at the endpoints. If two opposite color charges are found close to each other, they will
recombine and create a hadron that is observed in the final state. The creation of hadrons
as a consequence of confinement is called hadronisation.
The products of the collision that are not directly identified with the hard products of the
collision (hadron remnants, products of multiple parton interactions, radiation) are conventionally
defined as underlying event. Further details on the simulation of these processes are given in
Section 1.4.2.
1.2.2. Renormalisation, scale violations and parton distribution
functions
Asymptotic freedom allows QCD to be described using point-like constituents at sufficiently
large energies. The first evidence of this behaviour was given by the SLAC-MIT experiments
and interpreted by Feynman and Field using the so-called parton model [9]. On the other hand,
the momentum scale introduced by renormalisation needed to be accommodated: the improved
parton model was developed [16,17]. Starting from these ideas, the perturbative evolution of the
quark and gluon behaviour can be predicted separately from the soft, non-perturbative physics,
allowing for theoretical calculation of QCD processes.
The differential cross section for lepton-hadron (lh) inelastic scattering (as in the SLAC
experiments) can be parameterised starting from that of elastic scattering of fundamental
particles. Equation 1.2 makes use of structure functions F that encapsulate the lack of knowledge
on the nucleon behaviour, the kinematics of the scattering (in terms of the momentum transfer
Q2 and of the functions f(y) and g(y) that depend on the kinematics of the scattering). It also
introduces the variable x that (at leading order) represents the fraction of hadron momentum
taken by the struck quark:
d2(lh)
dxdQ2
(f(y)xF1(x,Q
2) + g(y)F2(x,Q
2)) (1.2)
In comparison with the formula of the cross section for incoherent scattering, where each
quark composing the hadron can be struck independently from the others, one finds that:
1. the structure function F2 can be identified with the sum of the products of the quark
charge squared e2i and momentum distribution xqi(x) for all the quarks in the hadron.
The qi(x) functions can be interpreted (at leading order of perturbation theory) as the
probability densities of finding a quark with flavour i carrying a fraction x of the hadron
momentum. The momentum distribution for a given quark or gluon is also called parton
distribution function, or PDF.
F lh2 =
e2ixqi(x) (1.3)
The independence of the structure function from momentum transfer Q2 at fixed values of
x is known as Bjorken scaling.
2. the two structure functions are not independent if quarks have spin 1/2 (Callan-Gross
equation).
The experimental verification of both approximate Bjorken scaling and the Callan-Gross
relation in the measurement of the structure functions performed at SLAC shows that quarks
in hadrons can be treated as quasi-free spin 1/2 particles. This forms the basis of the quark
parton model. Other structure functions, defined as combinations of the quark PDFs, have
been derived and measured in data (for a review, see Chapter 5 of Reference [18]).
When integrating F2 over all possible momentum fractions, only about half of the total
hadron momentum is carried by quarks. Probability conservation requires that the area of the
total momentum distributions in the proton is equal to unity (this requirement is also called
momentum sum rule). This calls for the presence of gluons, later observed at the PETRA
collider [19]. Gluons are responsible for quark interactions, since they are the carriers of strong
force.
Conventionally, partons composing a hadron are divided between gluons, valence quarks and
sea quarks. Valence quarks are responsible for the hadrons quantum numbers, while sea quarks
are quark/antiquark pairs that can be generated thanks to quantum fluctuations.

Figure 1.3.:Measurement of the structure function F2 from the HERA experiments (Figure from [20]).
Interactions among the partons lead to deviation from the naive parton model in terms of
scaling violations, as shown in Figure 1.3 where experimental points at the same value of x do
depend on Q2. Intuitively, an increase in Q2 can be seen as an increase in the resolving power
of the probe: if the internal structure of the hadron can be probed at smaller distances, then
the number of partons seen increases given that gluons can produce quark/antiquark pairs and
quarks or antiquarks can radiate gluons. The DGLAP formalism [21] models these interactions
through splitting functions and uses them to evolve perturbatively the renormalised parton
densities that contain the Q2 dependence. Given that quarks and gluons interact, the DGLAP
equations that describe the change in quark, antiquark and gluon densities with Q2 are coupled.
The DGLAP formalism only gives information on the the evolution of the PDF, not on their
shape, which is derived using a combination of the experimental data on the structure functions
and an initial analytical form, as discussed in the next section.
PDF parameterisations
Structure functions such as F2, introduced in the previous section, can be measured experimen-
tally. Parton distribution functions are not observable, but instead they are extracted using
combinations of measurements for independent structure functions. Sum rules that constrain
groups of PDF (e.g. on the consistency of the quantum numbers of the hadron) can also be
used to infer information on parton distribution functions. Details on the extraction of PDF
parameters are given in Chapter 7.
One essential ingredient for the extraction of parton distribution functions is the parameterisa-
tion of the PDFs at a starting scale. Since such a parameterisation is not predictable from first
principles in QCD, simple considerations on the behaviour of the functions and assumptions on
their shapes need to be introduced. For nucleons, the valence quark PDFs should be allowed to
peak around 1/3 (in the assumption that the three valence quarks will share equal fractions of
the hadron momentum), with an additional smearing due to the intrinsic parton momentum
and the presence of sea quarks. One also expects that sea quarks will grow for lower values of
x because of the divergent nature of QCD radiation and because gluons branch into qq pairs.
Valence quarks will not have this behaviour because gluon interactions will not change the quark
flavour. Furthermore, the parameterisations must respect the kinematic of the x variable: 0
< x < 1. This leads to the following basic parameterisations for the PDFs:
xV (x) = AxB(1 x)C (1.4)
The behaviour at high x can also be predicted using what is called the spectator model [22],
while the the power-law behaviour for x0 can be predicted using Regge trajectories [23].
The exact starting scale parameterisations used by the different groups that extract parton
distribution functions vary, and those used for this thesis are detailed in Chapter 7.
1.2.3. QCD Factorisation
One of the reasons of the success of QCD as a predictive theory is that the short-distance
component of the scattering process described by perturbative QCD can be separated from the
non-perturbative long-distance component: this result is known as the factorisation theorem [24].
Factorisation implies that perturbation theory can be used to calculate the hard scattering cross
section, while universal functions such as the PDFs can be included a posteriori to obtain the
full theoretical prediction. This is shown in Equation 1.5 using the quantities in Figure 1.4 for a
hard hadronic process:
dhard(pA, pB,Q
dxadxbfa/A(xa, 
F )fb/B(xb, 
dabcd(s(2R),Q
2/2R). (1.5)
fa/A and fb/B are the parton momentum densities for the two interacting partons a, b with
respect to hadrons A,B. Since factorisation is a byproduct of a procedure that absorbs
singularities into physical quantities in the same fashion as renormalisation, a new scale 2F is
introduced. When truncating calculations at a given order, the uncertainties due to the choice
of scale need to be calculated in order to account for higher order terms.
Factorisation is related to the connection of inclusive hadronic observables to the underlying
kinematics of the hard scattering of quarks and gluons, even when the final signature is influenced
by parton distribution functions, fragmentation and hadronisation.
fa/ A xa
fb/ B
Figure 1.4.:Schematic illustration of hard hadronic process.
Factorisation and the comparison of experimental data from different processes indicate
that the parton distribution functions are universal (i.e. they do not depend on the physics
process). They can be derived from different physics processes and then used to derive full
theoretical predictions independently from the calculation of the hard scattering cross section.
The universality of parton distribution functions is confirmed by the comparison of the extraction
of the structure functions from different processes as mentioned in Section 1.2.2.
1.3. Infrared safety in inclusive processes: jets
QCD cross sections diverge when calculating processes that involve the radiation of infinitely
soft particles (infrared divergencies) and when radiation happens at small angle (collinear
divergences). However, infrared divergences cancel by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg
theorem [25,26]. The practical consequence of this theorem is that observables that are inclusive
enough to be insensitive to processes that distinguish between different numbers of partons are
infrared safe and are not affected by infrared divergences. This is mirrored by the behaviour of
experimental measurements: detectors have a finite spatial resolution and will not be able to
resolve the products of separate partons.
If the objects that represent partons in the final state have a well defined behaviour both
in theory and experiments, then the parton kinematics will be reflected in the kinematic of
the final state object. This is where the definition of jets becomes indispensable for QCD
measurements. A jet can be navely seen as a group of collimated particles generated by the
hadronisation of a parton in the scattering process, as shown schematically in Fig. 1.5.
Figure 1.5.:Development of a jet: collimated particles from the hadronisation of quarks and gluons
deposit energy in the ATLAS calorimeters, as described in Chapter 2.
The concept of jets was introduced even before QCD was formalised (see for example
Reference [27]). A rigorous definition of jets for use as a connection between perturbative QCD
and observable hadronic final state was introduced by Sternman and Weinberg [28]. Given that
thanks to momentum conservation two partons with sufficiently high transverse momenta will
be produced back to back, one can define a jet cross section by including all partons and their
radiation if they are found in two cones of opening angle . These cones will only leave out a
finite amount of energy . The definition of boundaries for the integration in terms of  and 
allows for a finite cross section. A similar algorithm can also be used when dealing with the two
collimated sprays of particles produced by the hadronisation of the partons. Different infrared
and collinear safe algorithms have since been introduced, but what remains of this interpretation
is the requirement of using the same jet finding algorithm in theory and experiment to be
able to compare theoretical prediction to data. More details on the definition of jets and the
algorithms used for jet finding are given in Chapter 3.
1.3.1. Inclusive jet production
The inclusive jet cross section is a standard tool to test perturbative QCD at hadron colliders,
spanning over numerous orders of magnitude in terms of the jet transverse momentum. The
experimental measurement does not present particular difficulties in terms of background
subtraction given that jets are the predominant hard process produced in the hadron-hadron
collisions.
Jets are dominantly produced through scattering of two partons (gluon-gluon, quark-gluon
or quark-antiquark) leading to two partons in the final state. As mentioned in Section 1.2,
asymptotic freedom and factorisation allow the calculation of theoretical predictions for QCD
processes using perturbation theory. The difficulty of theoretical calculations increases with
the order of perturbation, corresponding to the number of partons involved. At leading order
only two initial and final state partons are involved. For each increasing order of perturbation
theory, one parton needs to be added to the 22 process, either as a leg or as a loop, and
the diagrams will interfere in the calculation. The theoretical prediction for the inclusive jet
cross section is known at next to leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory.
1.3.2. Motivations to measure the inclusive jet cross section
Jets are a necessary ingredient for many analyses at a hadron collider. Measuring the inclusive
cross section requires a detailed understanding of jets and the related systematic uncertainties.
Since the theory/data comparison for the inclusive jet cross section in measurements prior to
the one detailed in this thesis showed excellent agreement, as in References [29] and [30], an
early data/theory comparison can be performed in a kinematic region where agreement has
been previously found to ensure that jets in ATLAS are well understood.
Furthermore, a measurement of the jet cross section with the data collected by the ATLAS
detector in the first year of operation of the Large Hadron Collider spans kinematic regions that
were previously unexplored, and it can be used as a more stringent test of perturbative QCD
over phase space. If the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are small enough and well
understood, the measurement can also be used to constrain the parton distribution functions
exploiting the extended kinematic range, especially the gluon distribution at values of x up to
0.2. This topic will be developed further in Chapter 7.
1.4. Theoretical tools
A theoretical prediction is fully comparable to data when corrections are applied to the calculation
to simulate additional orders in perturbation theory and non perturbative effects, and after all
detector-specific effects have been removed from the experimental measurement. The tools used
to calculate the NLO theoretical prediction, for the extraction of jet calibration parameters and
for the theory/data comparison of the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section detailed in
this thesis are listed in the following paragraphs.
1.4.1. NLO calculation software and convolution with PDFs
The next to leading order calculation for the hard process is performed using the NLOJET++
4.1.2 [31] software. This result needs to be convoluted with the parton distribution functions at
given renormalisation and factorisation scales: this is achieved with the APPLGrid software [32].
APPLGrid allows for a posteriori inclusion of PDF and process scales, so that the time-consuming
calculation of the next to leading order coefficients only need to be evaluated once. This is
particularly useful when systematic uncertainties derived from variations of the PDFs, scales
and strong coupling constant need to be estimated.
1.4.2. Parton shower Monte Carlo generators
Monte Carlo event generators such as Pythia [33] and Alpgen [34] are employed to simulate
inclusive QCD jet events from proton-proton collisions when the information on the particles
entering the detector after hadronisation is needed.
These generators simulate the entire QCD event, using various models to simulate the
non-perturbative steps mentioned in Section 1.2.1. No full calculation beyond leading order is
employed in the generators that are normally used, although the Alpgen generator is able
to provide matrix elements for up to 6 additional partons as legs of the diagram. After the
hard scattering (22, or 2n) is simulated starting from the matrix element calculation that
includes the convolution with a PDF of choice, subsequent radiation is simulated using a series
of probabilities for partons to split. This approach is called parton shower, and it needs to be
matched to the matrix element calculation to avoid double counting of radiation generated by
both the hard scattering and by the parton shower. The splittings are iterated until a cut-off
scale is reached (usually 1 GeV), and at that point hadronisation will start. These generators
will have specific models (or employ external plug-ins) for hadronisation and multiple parton
interactions, whose parameters can be tuned using specific data.
The Monte Carlo generators used in the inclusive jet analysis are listed below, together with
their main characteristics and choices of PDF and tunes.
Pythia simulates non-diffractive proton-proton collisions using a 22 matrix element at
leading-order of the strong coupling to model the hard subprocess, and use parton
showers to model additional radiation in the leading-logarithmic approximation using
pT -ordering [35]. The hadronisation model used is an evolution of the string model
described in Section 1.2.1 (Lund string model [36]). Multiple parton interactions are also
simulated within Pythia [35]. The PDF used for the Pythia samples is the modified
leading order set MRST LO* [37]. Modified leading order PDFs can be used in combination
with a leading order generator to obtain a result qualitatively similar to what one would
obtain with a next to leading order calculation 2.
Alpgen is a leading order matrix-element generator for hard multi-parton processes in hadronic
collisions [34]. It is interfaced to the Herwig generator to produce angular-ordered parton
showers in leading-logarithmic approximation [38]. Parton showers are matched to the
matrix element with the MLM matching scheme [39]. The hadronization is simulated in
Herwig [38] using the cluster model [40] where gluons split in qq pairs that are subsequently
regrouped into colorless clusters to produce hadrons. Multiple parton interactions are
modelled using Jimmy [41]. The PDF used for the Alpgen samples is CTEQ6L1 [42].
Herwig++ [43] is a multipurpose event generator built on the experience of Herwig. It
simulates the full hadronic interaction in a similar fashion as Pythia, but using angular
ordering in the generation of the parton shower and specific hadronisation and multiparton
interactions models [44]. The MRST LO* PDF set is used in combination with the
Herwig++ generator.
The parameters used for tuning the underlying event models in the Pythia and Herwig
event generators have been derived from minimum bias measurement in ATLAS data [45,46]
and are denoted as ATLAS MC10 tune.
2This statement is currently being tested in a number of measurements at LHC energies.
Nominal Monte Carlo sample
The baseline Monte Carlo sample used in this analysis for the calibration and derivation of the
jet energy scale and its uncertainty is generated with Pythia and will be referred to as nominal
sample in the following. The full sample3 is composed of 12.6 million simulated Pythia QCD
jet events. Due to the steeply falling jet cross section, the samples have been generated in 9
bins of transverse momentum of the outgoing partons in the 22 hard scattering process
(pT ), covering the range 8 GeV - 3.5 TeV. Each sub-sample is weighted according to its cross
section to form the final event sample. The sample used for the theory/data comparisons and
for the derivation of the non perturbative corrections that need to be applied to the NLO
calculation includes the nominal Pythia sample, complemented by a minimum bias sample of
approximately 20 million events for jets with pT below 8 GeV. Events with pT below 17 GeV
are taken from the minimum bias sample, while events above this threshold are taken from the
nominal sample mentioned above.

Chapter 2.
The ATLAS Experiment
The study of new phenomena in particle physics at the Terascale, the discovery of the Higgs
boson and further measurements of Standard Model quantities are among the main goals of
the experiments located on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva. At the
LHC, proton beams with a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV collide up to every 50 ns at the
four interaction points, where the experiments are installed. The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC
ApparatuS) experiment is a general purpose detector located at the Interaction Point 1 on the
French-Swiss border, and has been recording collision data at 7 TeV starting from the Spring of
2010.
This Chapter outlines the layout of the ATLAS detector (Section 2.2) and its subsystems
(Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Given their relevance for the measurements described in this thesis,
the ATLAS calorimeters are described in more detail in Section 2.5. Section 2.6 describes the
simulation infrastructure of the ATLAS detector, with a particular focus on hadronic interactions
within the calorimeters. Finally, the computing infrastructure, the data used for the measurement
and the trigger system used to select relevant events are described in Sections 2.7 - 2.9.
2.1. CERN and the Large Hadron Collider
CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the largest international particle
physics laboratory in the world. It is located near Geneva, at the border between Switzerland
and France. The current flagship project at CERN is a particle accelerator called the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC accelerates and collides proton beams at a centre of mass
energy of 7 TeV. It has taken almost 20 years of design, development, construction and testing,
and it delivered its first collisions in November 2009, achieving the world-record energy of 7 TeV
in March 2010. The products of the LHC collisions are detected by four large scale experiments
situated at the collision points, as shown in Figure 2.1.
Figure 2.1.:The four main experiments located around the LHC ring. The SPS, the final link in the
pre-acceleration chain, and its connection tunnels to the LHC are also shown. From [55].
2.1.1. Running conditions of the LHC accelerator
The ATLAS detector records proton-proton collision events delivered by the Large Hadron
Collider. Bunches of protons circulate in separate vacuum tubes in opposite directions within the
beam pipe, and are brought together to collide by quadrupole magnets in the four interaction
points. One of the figures of merit of the accelerator is the luminosity, since it connects the
number of events per unit of time dN/dt to the cross section  of a given process: dN/dt = L.
The physics program at the Large Hadron Collider includes searches for rare physics processes
(with a small cross section) such as the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles: it is therefore
important to maximise the delivered luminosity in order to be able to observe such events.
An increase in the luminosity can be achieved by squeezing the beams and reducing their
transverse size, or by increasing the number of colliding protons per bunch or the number of
circulating bunches. The first two effects lead to an increase of proton-proton interactions
within the same bunch (in-time pile-up), while the latter two lead to multiple interactions from
different bunches during the time taken for the detector to process a single event (out-of-time
pile-up). Out-of-time pile-up can also be produced by the circulation of multiple subsequent
bunches (bunch train). The very first data delivered by the LHC had a negligible number of
multiple interactions until May 2010, when the accelerator optics was optimised to decrease the
size of the beams at the interaction point: this lead to an increase in the number of events
with more than a single proton-proton interaction to about 10%. The number of protons per
bunch was increased throughout the course of the summer, leading to a rise in the fraction of
events with in-time pile-up that continued up to November 2010, when the average number of
interactions was more than three [56]. This is shown in Figure 2.2.
The instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC is estimated using ATLAS subdetectors
built for this purpose, as described in detail in References [57,58]. The systematic error on the
integrated luminosity for the full 2010 dataset is 3.4%.
Figure 2.2.:The number of interactions per bunch crossing (BX) as measured online by the ATLAS
luminosity detectors. In order to calculate the equivalent mean number of interactions,
an inelastic cross-section of inel=71.5 mb is assumed. Figure from [56].
The LHC design luminosity is  1034 cm2 s1, leading to 22 simultaneous proton-proton
interactions and to more than 1000 particles being produced within one event in the central
detector region, and the maximum instantaneous luminosity obtained in 2010 is  2 1032
cm2 s1. These conditions impose strong requirements on the radiation hardness and granularity
of the detectors: the design of the ATLAS detector that can withstand these is described in
Section 2.2. The high luminosity combined with the proton-proton inelastic cross section of 71.5
mb [57] requires a fast system for the selection of interesting events: the ATLAS trigger system
is described in Section 2.9.
2.2. Overview of the ATLAS detector and coordinate
system
The ATLAS experiment is located at Point 1 of the LHC ring, and it is a collaboration consisting
of more than 2900 physicists from 172 different Institutes and Universities throughout the world.
Its layout is shown in Figure 2.3. The ATLAS detector is a general purpose experiment that has
been built to perform well in the high-intensity and high energy hadronic environment of the
Large Hadron Collider and have a wide physics program that includes precise Standard Model
measurements, searches for the Higgs boson, for supersymmetric signatures and for physics
beyond the Standard Model.
The ATLAS detector consists of a tracking system (inner detector, or ID in the following) in
a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field up to a pseudorapidity || < 2.5, sampling electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters up to || < 4.9, and muon chambers in a toroidal magnetic field provided
by air-core toroids. A detailed description of the ATLAS experiment can be found in [59] and
its subsystems are described in the sections below.
Figure 2.3.:A detailed computer-generated image of the ATLAS detector and its subsystems. Figure
from [60].
The ATLAS Coordinate System is a right-handed system with the x-axis pointing to the
centre of the LHC ring, the z-axis following the beam direction and the y-axis pointing upwards.
The azimuthal angle  = 0 corresponds to the positive x-axis and  increases clock-wise looking
into the positive z direction. The pseudorapidity  is an approximation for the rapidity y in the
high energy limit, and it is related to the polar angle  as  =  ln tan 
. The R coordinate is a
measure of the radial distance with respect to the interaction point and it follows the direction
of the y-axis. In the following, the central detector region (generally up to  <1.5) is referred to
as barrel, the more forward region (up to  <2.5 unless otherwise noted) as endcap and the
forwardmost pseudorapidities are simply called forward region.
2.3. The ATLAS inner detector system
The ATLAS Inner Detector system consists of high-resolution silicon detectors (pixels and strips)
surrounding the interaction point to locate the interaction vertex, measuring displaced vertices
from long-lived particles and measuring precisely the track momentum. The tracking detectors
are arranged in concentric cylinders around the beam axis in the barrel region, while disks are
used in the endcap region, and they are located within a 2 T magnetic field generated by a
superconducting solenoidal magnet. The coverage of the tracking detectors is up to || <2.5.
Figure 2.4 (a) displays the layout of the inner detector system.
(a) (b)
Figure 2.4.:Computer-generated images of the ATLAS inner detector system (a) and muon detectors
(b). Figures from [60].
The core components of the ATLAS pixel detector are semiconducting pixels, assembled in
silicon wafers called sensors. The SemiConductor Tracker (SCT) consists of modules formed by
microstrip semiconductor strips arranged parallel to the beam pipe in the barrel region and
radially in the endcaps, providing a measurement in the R  coordinate. Pairs of sensors
are glued together at a 40 mrad stereo angle to allow for a measurement of the z coordinate.
The ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) is comprised of straw tubes filled with a
Xenon-based gas mixture to provide continuous R  information and particle identification.
The tracking algorithms use information from all the inner detector subsystems. The raw
data are first converted into three dimensional space points in the pixel and SCT, and into drift
circles1 in the case of the TRT. The track finding and vertexing software [61] is then employed
to find prompt tracks that originate from vertices near the interaction point. Track candidates
are built from space points in the silicon layers, fitted and then extended to the TRT using the

as estimated from the time needed for drift electrons to reach the wire.
full ID information. A dedicated vertex finder identifies the primary vertex as that with the
highest sum of pT of the tracks pointing to it, normalized by the number of tracks.
2.4. The ATLAS muon system
Muons are deflected by the large air core toroids placed outside the calorimeter system, three in
the barrel and two in the endcap. The toroids provide a magnetic field generally orthogonal
to the muon direction, and their air core minimises the deflections due to multiple scattering.
The ATLAS muon system triggers on and measures the muon momentum: chambers with
higher precision (Monitored Drift Tubes and Cathode Strip Chambers) are employed for precise
measurements of muons up to || < 2.7 and coarser chambers (Resistive Plate Chambers and
Thin Gap Chambers) are used for selecting interesting events containing muon candidates.
2.5. The ATLAS calorimeter system
Figure 2.5.:A computer-generated image of the ATLAS calorimeter system. Figure from [60].
The ATLAS calorimeter system (Figure 2.5) aims to measure the energy and position of
particles through the absorption of their energy deposits in the calorimeter material. Particle
cascades (showers) are produced in this process. The ATLAS calorimetry system employs a
sampling technique (sandwiching active and passive material) that separates the absorption
from the energy measurement and allows for a more compact design with an almost complete
containment of the showers. ATLAS includes an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter,
with different characteristics in order to account for the different properties of electromagnetic
and hadronic showers.
ATLAS calorimeters are non compensating: the hadron response is lower than the response
to electromagnetically interacting particles. While the energy of an electromagnetic shower
is usually fully detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter, not all the energy of a hadronic
shower can be detected in the calorimeters: this is mainly due to invisible energy from the
nuclear breakdowns and excitation, and partly to invisible particles escaping detection (, ) [62].
Techniques to restore the correct energy scale for hadronic particles are described in Section 3.2.
The starting point for the calibration of all energy deposits, hadronic or electromagnetic, is
a measurement of the energy deposited in the single readout cell at the electromagnetic scale
(also called EM-scale in the following). The ATLAS calorimeters and the procedure to set the
electromagnetic scale are described in the following sections.
2.5.1. Electromagnetic calorimeters
The ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter (also called LAr calorimeter) employs liquid argon as
the active material and lead as absorber. Charged particles traversing the calorimeter ionise
the liquid argon, and the resulting electrons drift towards the copper electrodes in the read
out cells thanks to the presence of an electric field. The two LAr calorimeter barrels span up
to || = 1.475, while the coverage of the endcaps is 1.375  || < 3.2 in two coaxial wheels
(1.375  || < 2.5 and 2.5  || < 3.2). The crack region between 1.375  || < 1.52 is
affected by additional material needed to instrument and cool the inner detector, and it is
normally excluded from analyses that require a precise measurement of electrons.
The LAr calorimeter barrel has an accordion structure as shown in Figure 2.6, designed to
avoid azimuthal cracks, provide full  symmetry for particles traversing it and allow for a fast
readout. The liquid argon is located in the gaps between the 1024 accordion absorbers, leading
to a drift time of approximately 450 ns under the influence of the 2 kV electric field. Since
the drift velocity enters the energy measurement2, the detector conditions that influence it
such as high voltage and liquid argon temperature and density need to be continuously kept
under control to reduce the fluctuations in the energy measurement. The width of the gap is
2.1 mm in the barrel and varies with pseudorapidity in the endcap, so the high voltage needs
to vary accordingly to obtain a calorimeter response independent from pseudorapidity. The
2The drift time Tdrift is connected to the width of the gap wgap and the drift velocity vdrift as Tdrift =
wgap/vdrift. In turn, the time dependence of the ionisation current I that is input to the energy measurement
can be described using a baseline current I0 that again depends on the drift velocity: I(t) = I0(1 t/Tdrift).

electromagnetic calorimeters are located in cryostats, since liquid argon needs to be kept at a
temperature of about 88 K.
The LAr calorimeter barrel is divided into three layers, as shown in Figure 2.6. The first
layer, finely segmented in strips of  = 0.0031  0.098, is used to reconstruct the 
position of the electromagnetic shower and provide information on particle identification. The
second layer collects the largest fraction of energy deposited by the shower in its  16 X0, and
the third layer only collects the shower tail. The electrodes in the second and third layer are
grouped in towers of =0.0245  0.025 and 0.0245  0.05 respectively. The total
number of radiation lengths traversed by a particle in the electromagnetic calorimeter ranges
from 22 to 33. The first wheel of the LAr endcaps is segmented in three layers with a granularity
equal to that of the barrel, while the second wheel (for larger pseudorapidities) has a coarser
granularity that varies a function pseudorapidity.
The distribution of material upstream of the calorimeters in terms of radiation lengths is
shown in Figure 2.7. In order to correct for the energy lost by incident particles traversing this
material, a presampler detector is used for || <1.8. The presampler is composed of an active
layer of LAr with 1.1 (0.5) cm thickness in the barrel (endcap). A scintillator slab is also placed
in the gap between barrel and endcap in the boundary between the barrel and endcap cryostat
(1.0  || < 1.6).

Liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter calibration and uncertainty on the EM energy scale
The analog signal produced by the ionisation of charged particles is amplified, shaped and
sampled every 25 ns. If the event is retained by the trigger signal (see Section 2.9), a number of
samples (5 or 7) are digitised and sent to the off-detector electronics for calibration. The full
electronic calibration procedure to convert the raw signal to a pulse shape in ADC counts such
as the one in Figure 2.8 and to extract the visible energy deposited in each cell is described in
detail in References [6365].
Electron and photon candidates are reconstructed gathering calorimeter cells in clusters, using
a sliding window algorithm [68] and combining energies deposited in each layer. The cluster
energy and position needs to be determined precisely starting from the visible energy deposited
in the cells and taking into account the shower development in the sampling calorimeters, the
energy deposited upstream the calorimeter (using information from the presampler), the leakage
outside the calorimeters and the modulations of the energy in  and  due to the accordion
geometry. These factors and the calibration constants for the electronics (including corrections
for known high voltage problems) have been derived and validated using electron and muon test
beams and Monte Carlo simulation [64,6975].

calorimeter (from [66]). Figure (b): sample pulse shape from the Tile calorimeter from
a collision run, with the expected pulse shape used for reconstruction overlaid in red

The systematic uncertainty on the electron energy scale after this calibration procedure
amounts to 3%. The main sources of uncertainties are:
 The difference in the electromagnetic scale between the test-beam setup and the full
ATLAS detector due to the uncertainty in the liquid argon temperature in the test-beam,
derived from comparison of different test-beam measurements [64,71];
 The difference in pulse reconstruction methods and calibration corrections between the
test-beam and ATLAS setup [71,76];
 The time stability of the electromagnetic scale from variations in the calibration of the
electronics, and in the detector and environmental conditions monitored in test-beam and
with collision data [76].
The final energy scale for the electromagnetic calorimeters needs to be determined with a
higher precision with respect to that obtained with the calibration outlined above. For this
purpose, correction factors are derived using Z  ee events, taking advantage of the well known
mass of the Z boson to set the absolute energy scale and intercalibrate the various regions of
the detector. If the measured energy for an electron Emeas contains a residual miscalibration
factor  compared with the true electron energy Etrue as Emeas = Etrue(1 + ), the effect on
the measured Z mass MmeasZ can be parameterised as:

where Lij is a probability density function that quantifies the compatibility of the event with
the Z lineshape based on the Breit-Wigner distribution. It has been obtained from simulated
events to take into account all theoretical and experimental effects that can influence the ideal Z
mass distribution.
Preliminary scale factors on the electromagnetic scale derived from Z  ee events were
applied to the full 2010 dataset used in this thesis. These were derived using roughly 10000 events
where both electrons were found in the central region (|| < 2.47, excluding the crack region)
and 3100 events where one central and one forward electron (2.47  || < 4.9) were found.
The available statistics only allowed to obtain preliminary scale factors for five pseudorapidity
regions, listed in Table 2.1. The scale factors are applied to all cells in the  region considered,
by scaling the cells measured energy by (1 + ).
The residual uncertainty on the LAr electromagnetic scale amounts to 1.5% for the electro-
magnetic energy deposited in the LAr calorimeters and 5% for the energy deposited in the
presampler. This accounts for the systematic uncertainties in the Z  ee analysis (that are
detailed in the full 2010 analysis [77]) and differences in the electron shower shape between data
and simulation.
2.5.2. Hadronic calorimeters
The hadronic calorimeters make use of plastic scintillator tiles and steel for the barrel and
extended barrels (covering 0 < || < 0.8 and 0.8 < || < 1.7, respectively, and they are called
Tile calorimeter in the following. The 3 mm tiles are placed perpendicular to the colliding beams,
as shown in Figure 2.9. Particles interact with the active medium producing scintillation light
proportional to the deposited energy, which is in turn collected using wavelength-shifting fibers.
Readout cells are built by grouping fibres together in projective towers in , and the scintillation
light is collected by photomultiplier tubes at each end of the tiles. The Tile calorimeter consists
of three layers in both barrel and extended barrel. The cell granularity varies according to
pseudorapidity and distance from the interaction point: the granularity is =0.10.1
in the first two layers and 0.10.2 in the third layer.

tiles and of the readout components. Figure from [60].
Tile calorimeter calibration and uncertainty on the EM energy scale
The measurement of scintillation light by the photomultipliers produces a pulse with a 50 ns
width with amplitude proportional to the energy deposited in the cell, as shown in Figure 2.8
(b). The pulse shape is sampled 7 times and sent to the read out electronics in case the event is
selected by the trigger system. An optimal filtering algorithm is used to extract the amplitude,
timing and pedestal from the pulse shape [78]. The ADC counts that are the output of the
photomultipliers are converted into an energy measurement using correction constants derived
from test beam measurements [64,7072,79] and propagated to the full ATLAS setup using a
charge injection calibration system [78]. The absolute calorimeter response to energy deposited
via electromagnetic processes has also been validated in the hadronic calorimeters using muons,
both from test-beams [79] and produced by cosmic-rays in-situ [80].
The uncertainty on the electromagnetic scale is estimated considering the ratio of the
electromagnetic scale response of minimum ionizing low-energy muons in test-beam data and in
Monte Carlo and comparing it with the same ratio between data and simulation of cosmic ray
muons in the full ATLAS setup, as outlined in Reference [81]. No significant shift in the response
between test-beam data and data taken with the full ATLAS detector has been observed. A
3% uncertainty on the measurement of the response ratio (due to the analysis method, the
discrepancies in the behaviour of data and Monte-Carlo as a function of the muon momentum
in cosmic data and the different conditions between the test-beam and ATLAS setups) has been
given as the estimated uncertainty on the hadronic calorimeter EM scale [82,83].
Hadronic endcap (HEC) and forward (FCal) calorimeters
The larger particle flux and the high energies reached in the forward region leads to the design
of a calorimeter system that is able to fully contain hadronic showers and is radiation hard, at a
limited cost. Liquid argon is employed as active material in the endcap and forward ATLAS
calorimeters.
In the hadronic endcaps (1.5 < || < 3.2 placed at 2.03 m from the interaction point, called
HEC ), 8.5 mm active gaps are sandwiched between copper plates. Each hadronic endcap
consistes of two wheels, with different widths for the copper plates (25 and 50 mm for inner
and outer wheel respectively). Each active gap is split in four drift spaces of about 1.8 mm by
the presence of three electrodes, avoiding ion build-up and allowing a lower HV configuration
with respect to a single electrode configuration. Readout cells are pseudo-projective in  and
projective in .
The forward calorimeter (FCal) is a liquid argon and tungsten/copper detector placed 4.7
m away from the interaction point on each side, and extends the ATLAS calorimeter system
up to || < 4.9. In order to reduce the neutron flux, the front face of the FCal is placed 1.2
m away from the EM calorimeter front face: to allow for shower containment, the absorber
must be dense. In addition, the gaps must be narrow to avoid ion build-up and have a fast
readout time. To fulfill these design requirements, tungsten and copper are chosen as passive
material, in a matrix that contains concentric tubular electrodes parallel to the beam pipe. The
electrodes contain the liquid argon in gaps that can be as small as 270 m.
The pulse shape, signal reconstruction and calibration for the endcap and forward calorimeters
are similar to those of the LAr electromagnetic calorimeters, described in Section 2.5.1.
2.6. Simulation of particle interactions in the ATLAS
detector
The Geant4 software toolkit [84] within the ATLAS simulation framework [85] propagates
the particles generated as explained in 1.4.2 through the ATLAS detector and simulates their
interactions with the detector material. The energy deposited by particles in the active detector
material is converted into detector signals with the same format as the ATLAS detector read-out.
The detector signals are in turn reconstructed with the same reconstruction software as used for
the data [85].
For the simulation of hadronic interactions in the detector, the Geant4 set of processes
called QGSP BERT is chosen [86]. In this set of processes, the Quark Gluon String model [87] is
used for the fragmentation of the nucleus, and the Bertini cascade model [88] for the description
of the interactions of hadrons in the medium of the nucleus.
The Geant4 simulation and in particular the hadronic interaction model have been validated
with test-beam measurements for the barrel [79,8992] and the endcap [73,74,93] calorimeters.
Further tests have been carried out in-situ using identified single particles from kaon and lambda
decays produced in proton-proton collisions, as described in Reference [94]. Excellent agreement
between simulation and data has been found for pions and protons in the range of a few hundred
MeV to 6 GeV, while the response of anti-protons is underestimated by about 10%.
Studies of the material of the inner detector upstream the calorimeters have been performed
using secondary hadronic interactions [95, 96]. The ATLAS detector geometry used in the
simulation of the nominal sample reflects the geometry of the detector3 as best known at the
time of the Autumn 2010 data reprocessing that was used for this thesis.
2.7. Software, computing and data analysis
An efficient distributed computing system is required to collect, process and store the data
recorded by the ATLAS detector. Monte Carlo simulations that mirror data as mentioned in
the previous section need to be produced at regular intervals, using information from the recent
data taking to improve the description of the physics processes and of the detector geometry and
conditions. The software employed in ATLAS is called Athena, and it is a C++ framework
based on the Gaudi project [97].
2.8. Data used in this thesis
The data used for the inclusive jet cross section measurement presented in this thesis comprises
the full 2010 ATLAS dataset (up to November 2010), corresponding to a total integrated
luminosity of 37.3  1.2) pb1.
The data taken by the ATLAS detector is divided in data periods, runs and luminosity blocks.
A luminosity block corresponds to the data accumulated in a small period of time (2-3 minutes
of data taking), and a run is a collection of luminosity blocks corresponding to continuous data
taking. The division of a run in smaller portions allows the exclusion of single problematic data
taking periods with minimal impact on the overall data taking efficiency. Data periods are
collections of runs that have similar overall conditions in terms of detector and trigger conditions,
and are named from A to I for the data considered in this thesis.
2.9. Trigger system
The data rate delivered by the LHC (up to 1 GHz in nominal conditions) largely exceeds the
current capabilities for recording events offline, both in terms of recording speed and storage
space. It is therefore necessary to have a system (called trigger) that selects the interesting
collision events based on the presence of high transverse momentum objects (muons, electrons,
photons, jets and tau leptons). The trigger system needs to reject the background without
biasing the selection of the rare signals.
3The geometry tag is ATLAS-GEO-16-11-00.
The trigger system is subdivided in three levels: L1, L2 and the Event Filter. The first
selection is made using coarse detector information from the calorimeter, muon and forward
(MBTS) subsystems in the first level trigger. The logic for the L1 trigger is mostly hardwired in
the readout electronics, given that the decision needs to be made in less than 2.5 s.
Since the rate for certain signatures (e.g. low pT QCD jets) would saturate the limited
bandwidth that needs to be shared by all triggers, some triggers are pre-scaled. This means
that only a fraction of the events accepted are effectively passed onto the next level, using a
random reset of the passed trigger and allowing the event to fail the requirements. A prescale
of 1 means that all events selected by the trigger are accepted, while larger prescales mean
that only a fraction 1/prescale is accepted. The trigger menu is chosen taking into account the
current LHC luminosity and the physics program for each data taking period.
The events that are accepted by the L1 trigger are passed on to the L2 trigger, which further
unpacks the information passed from the L1 trigger and increases the level of detail available for
the decision. Both the L2 and the Event Filter are part of the software trigger subsystem called
High Level Trigger (HLT). The L2 trigger has an average latency of 40ms and reduces the
rate to 2.5 kHz. If the event is accepted, it is passed to the Event Filter which runs a physics
reconstruction close to the offline software in about 4 seconds/event and selects events up to a
rate of 200 Hz.
The trigger systems used in the measurement described in this thesis are the Minimum Bias
Trigger Scintillators (MBTS) to select minimum bias collision events in the first data periods
(with a low data rate) and the jet4 triggers in the calorimeters.
The Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators are described in more detail in [98,99]. They consist
of plastic scintillator counters placed at 3.5 m away from each side of the interaction point,
covering the pseudorapidity range of 2.09  || < 3.84. The MBTS provide the least biased
trigger configuration to select collision events by selecting events where either one or both the
counters to have detected the passage of particles. They are used both to select events in the
very first data taking periods and to measure efficiencies for other triggers.
Jet triggers are used to select events the main experimental signature considered in the
measurement in this thesis: jets of collimated particles at high transverse momentum. The
functioning and performance of the jet triggers in the first 2010 data is described in Reference [100].
The measurement of the raw calorimeter energy (calibrated to the electromagnetic scale) in a
region of =0.2 0.2 in the calorimeter system (called trigger tower) is the baseline for

the Level 1 decision. A sliding window algorithm is used to select local maxima in transverse
energy, and if the measured ET is above the trigger threshold the event is retained and the raw
data within a Region Of Interest (ROI) is passed to the Level 2 trigger. The Level 2 jet trigger
reconstructs a jet by drawing a cone of radius R=
=0.7 and centered on the ROI,
including the energy of all the trigger towers within the cone and moving iteratively (up to
three times) the energy-weighted barycentre as to include the maximum local energy deposition.
The jet trigger is divided in two independent subsystems: the central jet trigger (|| < 3.2)
and the forward jet trigger (3.2  || < 4.9).
Chapter 3.
Jet reconstruction in ATLAS
Confined quarks and gluons from the proton-proton scattering manifest themselves as groups of
collimated particles in the final state, as described in Section 1.3. The particles are clustered
into physically measurable objects at hadron colliders: these objects are called jets.
The concept of a jet is not meaningful without a full specification of its definition. Defining
a jet requires a procedure to associate either particles or energy deposits to a single jet (jet
algorithm) and a recombination scheme that specifies how to combine the four-momenta of
the jet constituents. The jet definition, the main jet algorithms and the inputs to jets in the
ATLAS detector are described in Section 3.1.
Jets measured in the ATLAS detector need to be fully reconstructed in order to reconnect
the the energy measured in the calorimeter to the kinematics of the particles or partons that
generated the jets. First, the calorimeter energy deposits need to be associated to a single jet
with a jet finding algorithm. Subsequently, a calibration procedure is needed to translate the
signals read out from the calorimeters into a measurement of the energy of the particles forming
the jet. Section 3.2 motivates the jet calibration procedures and and outlines the calibration
scheme used in the 2010 ATLAS dataset. Techniques undergoing commissioning are briefly
mentioned.
3.1. Jet algorithms and inputs to jet reconstruction
Jets are connected to the underlying hard parton process. Since partons are not physically
observable objects, there is no unique jet definition. Nevertheless, in order to provide common
grounds of interpretation for jet physics between theory and experiments, a common definition
needs to be used to uniquely map a set of four-momenta (partons, particles or calorimeter
objects) into a jet. A jet definition, as suggested in the 2007 Les Houches accord [101], comprises:
 a jet algorithm that defines how to group the four-momenta into jets;
 the full specification of the jet algorithm parameters;
 the recombination scheme: a set of a rules for obtaining the four-momentum of a jet
from its constituents.
The specification of the truth level (Monte Carlo) particles that are inputs to jets used for the
theory/experiment comparison is also needed, for example in the case where where detector
effects are corrected by an unfolding technique as in the inclusive jet measurement presented in
this thesis (Chapter 6).
The following sections are dedicated to an overview of the properties required in a jet algorithm
(Section 3.1.1) and to the details of the jet definition used in ATLAS (Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3).
3.1.1. Theoretical requirements for a jet algorithm
A jet algorithm is required to be well behaved when confronted with possible QCD divergences,
such as infrared and collinear emissions, detailed in Chapter 1. Both infrared and collinear
emissions manifest themselves as soft particles, and the jet algorithm needs to be resilient to
these by reconstructing the same set of jets regardless of their presence or absence. Theoretically
well behaved jets give finite perturbative results at all orders, and allow meaningful comparisons
of data with the most recent theoretical predictions.
A theoretically well behaved jet algorithm needs to be infrared and collinear safe: The
presence or absence of additional infinitely soft particles radiated by the primary partons should
not modify the result of jet finding (e.g. the number of jets). Furthermore, jets should not
be sensitive to particles radiated at very small angle with respect to the original parton. An
example of the behaviour of an algorithm that does not behave well in presence of soft QCD
radiation is shown in Figure 3.1.
In addition to infrared and collinear safety, a jet algorithm should reproduce the same physics
in the final state regardless of the input type: jets can be reconstructed from partons, particles
and calorimeter objects.
In order to be successfully used in a high energy physics experiment, a jet algorithm needs to
have a computationally fast and fully specified implementation. Many modern jet algorithms
are implemented in the FastJet software [102, 103] either natively or as plug-ins. The jet
reconstruction software in ATHENA employs the FastJet classes for jet finding.

3.1.2. Jet definition in ATLAS
Jet algorithms can be divided in two classes: cone algorithms and successive recombination
algorithms.
Cone algorithms define jets based on the dominant direction of energy flow. The ATLAS
Cone algorithm, employed before data taking, starts from jet inputs with energy above a certain
threshold (seeds) and sums the four-momenta of all particles in a surrounding cone in ,
space with a radius R to obtain the initial proto-jet direction. A cone of radius R is then
redrawn starting from the proto-jet direction and four-momenta summed to obtain a new jet
direction. The procedure is iterated until the jet direction is stable (does not change significantly
in successive iterations). A split-merge step is performed to assign overlapping constituents to
the closest jet or merge two overlapping jets depending on the fraction of constituents shared by
the two jets.
Successive recombination algorithms iteratively merge pairs of objects according to a definition
of distance that typically involves the physical distance between the objects and their transverse
momentum, and in certain cases effectively undoing the QCD parton shower. The jet algorithm
employed in ATLAS data taking and for the measurement described in this thesis is the anti-kt
algorithm. This jet algorithm is based on the comparison for all possible pairs of objects between
the distances di,j = min(p
T,i, p
and di,Beam = p
T,i, where pT is the transverse momentum
of the particle considered, R is the spatial distance of the two objects in   space and R is
a parameter of the algorithm which can be considered as a weight to the spatial distance of the
two objects - the larger R, the wider the jets. In the following, R will be referred to as the jet
algorithm distance parameter. If the minimum between all di,j and di,Beam is a di,j, objects i
and j will be recombined, otherwise object i is considered a jet and not considered in the next
iteration. With this algorithm, soft radiation is effectively clustered around the harder core of
the process. Anti-kt jets have a regular, conical shape, experimentally desirable since it allows
for a well defined jet area that can be used for e.g. pile-up subtraction [104].
The ATLAS Cone algorithm is not theoretically well behaved due to the presence of a seed
with which to start the jet finding and to the split/merge step: soft particles originating from the
hard parton might influence whether the parton passes the threshold to form a proto-jet, and
influence whether the final jet is split into two separate jets. The anti-kt algorithm described
below does not suffer from any theoretical problems. This, and the better performance before
and after calibration [105] (including a better trigger matching performance), are the reasons why
the ATLAS collaboration adopted the anti-kt algorithm for data taking. Two different distance
parameters of R=0.4 and R=0.6 are employed for the measurements in this thesis, as detailed
in Chapter 6, as jets with different areas will be impacted differently by non perturbative effects
such as hadronisation and underlying event.
The final four-momentum of the jet is obtained from summing the four-momenta of its
constituents in the four-vector recombination scheme. This scheme conserves energy and
momentum, and allows a meaningful definition for the jet mass.
3.1.3. Inputs to jet reconstruction
Jets in ATLAS are reconstructed starting from different physics objects [106,107]. The most
widely used inputs to jet finding are topological clusters, or topoclusters [68], groups of calorimeter
cells clustered into three-dimensional energy deposits exploiting the longitudinal and transverse
calorimeter segmentation. Calorimeter cells are included in topoclusters using a noise suppression
scheme. Jets built from topological clusters will be referred to as topocluster jets in the following.
Jets can also be built using groups of geometrically delimited groups of calorimeter cells (towers),
that can also take advantage of the noise suppression scheme; these jets will be called tower jets
in the following. Both topoclusters and towers are reconstructed as massless pseudo-particles,
and are described in more detail below. Other inputs to jet reconstruction can be reconstructed
tracks (track jets) or stable 1 particles generated by the Monte Carlo event generator (Monte
Carlo truth jets). Truth jets used for the calibration and performance studies do not include
muon and neutrinos, while truth jets used for unfolding detector effects in the inclusive jet cross
section measurement do.
1A stable particle is defined to have a lifetime longer than 10 ps.
Topological clusters
Topological clusters are groups of calorimeter cells that are designed to follow the shower
development taking advantage of the fine segmentation of the ATLAS calorimeters. The
topocluster formation algorithm starts from a seed cell, whose signal-to-noise ratio (estimated as
the energy deposited in the calorimeter cell over the RMS of the energy distribution measured
in randomly triggered events) is above a threshold of 4. Cells neighboring the seed that have a
signal-to-noise ratio of at least 2 are included iteratively, and finally all neighboring cells are
added to the topocluster. The topoclustering algorithm also includes a splitting step: all cells in
a cluster are searched for local maxima in terms of energy content, and the local maxima are
then used as seeds for a new iteration of topological clustering, which will split the original
cluster in more topoclusters. A topocluster is defined to have an energy equal to the energy
sum of all the included cells, zero mass and a reconstructed direction as that of a unit vector
originating from the centre of the ATLAS coordinate system pointing to the energy-weighted
topocluster barycentre. The energy scale of topoclusters can also be calibrated starting from the
baseline energy scale measured by the calorimeters, as explained in section 3.2.2.
Calorimeter towers
Towers are defined as groups of calorimeter cells that are delimited by a projective fixed
two-dimensional grid in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle. The chosen grid element size
is  = 0.10.1; this choice divides the calorimeter into approximately 6400 geometrical
towers of fixed size in detector (,) space 2. The energy of a tower is given by the sum of the
energies of the single calorimeter cells as measured by the calorimeters. This definition allows
a fixed delimitation of the energy that contributes to a jet, and therefore allows for a clear
definition of the jet area to be employed when subtracting additional baseline energy that does
not belong to the jet (e.g. due to multiple proton-proton interactions within the same bunch
crossing) is performed.
Cells contributing to a tower can have a positive or a negative signal; the latter happens in
the case of noisy cells or cells integrating energy from more than one proton-proton interaction.
Summing all contributions indiscriminately allows for a natural average noise suppression,
but it also leads to negative towers in the case of large negative cell energies. Since negative
energy constituents have no clear meaning in four-vector algebra, unphysical results can be
obtained when reconstructing jets. For this reason, jets formed by towers with no explicit noise
2For non-projective calorimeter cells (e.g. in the FCal) or for cells larger than the tower grid element size, the
energy contribution of the cell to the tower is weighted by the ratio of the tower bin area over the cell area in

suppression are only used for specific studies, and the default tower definition only includes cells
that are contained in topoclusters, automatically discarding negative energy constituents. The
noise-suppressed towers are called topological towers or topotowers.
Figure 3.2 shows drawings of the different types of jet inputs: topoclusters (with the different
signal/noise contributions in shades of red), towers and topotowers. Topoclusters have been
drawn as composed by the shaded cells passing the noise suppression threshold. Dotted cells are
the ones that are effectively input to jet finding.
3.2. Jet energy scale calibration in ATLAS
In non-compensating calorimeters such as the ones in the ATLAS experiment, the response to
hadrons is lower than the response to particles interacting electromagnetically. This Section
describes the calibration schemes that have been developed in ATLAS to restore the correct
hadronic energy scale starting from the electromagnetic scale. The conversion of the raw
calorimeter signal into a EM-scale calibrated energy measurement has been described in
Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. A correction for calorimeter non-compensation is needed to restore
the final hadronic energy scale (jet energy scale), together with further corrections to take into
account effects related to the detector, such as:
1. energy losses in inactive regions of the detector (dead material),
2. energy deposits from particles not contained in the calorimeter (leakage),
3. energy deposits of particles not included in the reconstructed jet because e.g. they have
been deviated by the magnetic field (out of cone),
4. signal losses in calorimeter clustering and jet reconstruction.
Presently, the default ATLAS calibration scheme applies calibration corrections as a function
of the jet energy and pseudorapidity to jets reconstructed at the electromagnetic scale. The
hadronic jet energy scale is on average restored using calibration constants derived from the
comparison of the reconstructed jet kinematics to that of the corresponding truth level jet in
Monte Carlo studies. The additional energy due to multiple proton-proton interactions within
the same bunch crossings (pile-up) is corrected for before the hadronic energy scale is restored
using data-derived factors, so that the derivation of the jet energy scale calibration constants
is factorised and does not depend on the number of additional interactions measured. This
calibration scheme (called EM+JES) has been validated with in-situ techniques. It also allows a
direct evaluation of the systematic uncertainty, being therefore suitable for the very first physics
analyses.
The baseline (nominal) Monte Carlo sample used to derive the jet energy scale and to estimate
the sources of its systematic uncertainty is composed of inclusive QCD jet events generated
with the Pythia event generator tuned to the first ATLAS data [45] and passed through the
full ATLAS detector simulation. The nominal sample has been described in more detail in
Section 1.4.2. The reliability of the application of this Monte Carlo-based JES calibration to
data requires that reconstructed jets in this Monte Carlo sample are in good agreement with
jets in data. The Pythia Monte Carlo simulation has been shown to describe data reasonably
well, as shown in Figure 1.6.
3.2.1. EM+JES calibration scheme
The EM+JES calibration scheme is applied to both topocluster and tower jets after jet finding
has been performed at the electromagnetic scale, as a series of subsequent steps shown in figure
3.3 and detailed in the following paragraphs.
Figure 3.3.:Schematic representation of the jet reconstruction procedure for EM+JES jets.
Pile-up correction
The energy of jets can include energy that does not come from the interaction of interest, but
is instead produced by multiple proton-proton interactions within the same bunch crossing.
A correction is derived from minimum bias data as a function of number of reconstructed
primary vertices NPV
3 and jet pseudorapidity , and takes into account the average additional
energy deposited in a fixed grid of 0.1 0.1 in the (,)-plane (non-noise suppressed calorimeter
towers). To derive the correction, the average additional energy is then multiplied by the number
of towers in jets built from towers, or the average number of towers in the case of topocluster
jets, as a function of jet pseudorapidity. This correction is applied at the electromagnetic scale
as the first step of the calibration scheme. Further details on the pile-up offset correction can be
found in in Ref. [56].
Jet origin correction
Calorimeter jets are reconstructed using the geometrical centre of the ATLAS detector as
reference to calculate the direction of jets and their constituents (see Section 3.1.3). The direction
of each topocluster or tower included in a jet is corrected to point back to the primary vertex
with the highest associated sum of track transverse momenta squared (
p2T,track) in the event.
The kinematics of each jet constituent is recalculated using the vector from the primary vertex
to the topocluster or tower centroid as its direction. The raw jet four-momentum is thereafter
redefined as the vector sum of the constituent four-momenta, and its pseudorapidity is defined
origin in contrast to the raw detector pseudorapidity measured in the calorimeters det. The
origin correction improves the angular resolution, while the jet energy is unaffected.
3Vertices are counted using a criterion of having at least 5 associated tracks.
Final JES correction
In the final step of the EM+JES scheme, calibration constants derived from the comparison
of the simulated calorimeter jet kinematics to the kinematics of the corresponding Monte
Carlo truth jet are applied. Since pile-up effects have already been corrected for, the Monte
Carlo sample used to derive the calibration constant does not include multiple proton-proton
interactions within the same bunch crossing.
Only isolated jets are used for the calibration: an isolated jet is defined as a jet that has no
other calorimeter (truth) jet with EM-scale (truth) pT > 7 GeV within R = 2.5R, where R is
the distance parameter of the jet algorithm. The choice of using a specific Monte Carlo sample
with an isolation requirement leads to the calibration to be tailored to the specific jet flavour
composition (e.g. quark jets vs gluon jets) and topology used to derive the calibration constants.
Effects related to close-by jets and flavour composition need to be taken into account at the
analysis level and are discussed in Section 5.6. Only calorimeter jets that are geometrically
matched to truth jets within a cone of R =
()2 + ()2 = 0.3 around the jet axis are
used for the calibration.
For each pair of matched calorimeter/truth jet, the energy response R is defined as the ratio
of the jet energy measured in the calorimeters at a given scale Ecalo and the energy of the
matched truth jet Etruth:
R = Ecalo/Etruth. (3.1)
To derive the JES correction, the first step is to calculate the jet energy response at the
electromagnetic scale REM using the calorimeter energy as measured by the calorimeter E
calo.
For each (Etruth, det)-bin considered, two histograms for REM and E
calo are filled. For each bin
of det, the mean of a Gaussian fit to the REM distribution defines the average EM-scale energy
response R, as a function of the average EEMcalo corresponding to the Etruth bin considered.
R(EEMcalo)
is then fitted for each det bin k with an empirical function parameterised as:
Fcalib,k(E
calo) =
Nmax
lnEEMcalo
, (3.2)
where ai are free parameters, and Nmax is chosen between 1 and 6 depending on the goodness of
the fit. In the case of jets calibrated starting from the electromagnetic scale, the fit is constrained
to pass through three points lying on a curve that follows an approximate expression by Groom
et al. [108,109]. This helps convergence at very high energies where the Monte Carlo statistics is
limited. Grooms function exploits the consideration that at high energies bremsstrahlung and
0   dominate the hadronic shower, and therefore the electromagnetic fraction (that does
not need an additional correction due to non-compensation) increases with energy.
The final jet energy scale correction that relates the measured calorimeter jet energy scale to
the hadronic scale for each separate det-bin is then defined as 1/Fcalib,k(E
calo) in the following:
EEM+JEScalo =
EEMcalo
Fcalib(E
calo)|det
, (3.3)
The average jet energy scale correction
1/Fcalib,k(E
calo)
is shown as a function of calibrated
jet transverse momentum p
T for three jet -intervals in Figure 3.4. The value of the correction
factor ranges from about 2.1 at low jet transverse momentum to less than 1.2 for high energy
jets in the most forward region. The correction is only shown over the accessible kinematic
range, i.e. values for jets above the kinematic limit are not shown. This is also the case for the
following figures in this thesis. The calorimeter jet response at the electromagnetic scale REM is
shown for various energy- and det-bins in Figure 3.5.
After the jet origin and energy corrections, a small -dependent correction is applied to
remove a bias in the reconstructed  of jets that occurs when the jet falls into a poorly
instrumented region of the calorimeter. In these regions topoclusters are reconstructed with a
lower electromagnetic scale energy with respect to better instrumented regions (see Figure 3.5).
When clustered with a jet algorithm, the energy of each topocluster is used as a weight in the
calculation of the jet direction: the jet direction will therefore be biased towards the better
instrumented calorimeter regions. The size of this bias is illustrated as a function of uncorrected
detector pseudorapidity |det| and EM+JES calibrated jet energy in Figure 3.6.
The -correction is derived as the average  = truth  origin in (Etruth, det)-bins, and is
parameterised as a function of the jet EEM+JEScalo and det. It is very small ( < 0.01) for most
regions of the calorimeter but larger in the transition regions (up to  = 0.05 for low pT jets
in the HEC-FCal transition region around det = 3.2).

3.2.2. Other calibration schemes
In addition to the EM+JES scheme, other calibration schemes are undergoing commissioning in
ATLAS. The different characteristics of electromagnetic and hadronic showers are exploited as
cluster-by-cluster and/or jet-by-jet information. This reduces some of the sources of fluctuations

in the jet energy response (as described in Section 4.1) that are still present when applying an
overall scale factor to calibrate jets, and thereby improves the jet energy resolution. Hadronic
cascades are more extended and less dense than the electromagnetic ones. Cell energy densities
and specific jet properties can be measured thanks to the high granularity of the calorimeters
and used to parameterise the correction factors that compensate for the different response of
hadronic and electromagnetic showers.
Hadronic calibration methods in ATLAS can be classified in two categories:
1. Global calibrations, in which the jet finding is performed on either topocluster or towers at
the electromagnetic scale and then the energy of the whole jet or of the cells belonging to
a jet is corrected to the final jet energy scale;
2. Local calibrations, in which the jet finding is performed on topological clusters which have
already undergone a reweighting based on the properties of the cluster.
The EM+JES scheme described above, the Global Sequential Calibration [53] and Global
Cell Weighting [53,111] schemes belong to the first category, while the Local Cluster Weighting
scheme [112] belongs to the second. A brief description of these calibration schemes is given in
the following.
Global Cell Weighting In the Global Cell Weighting scheme (GCW), jets are grouped from
calorimeter objects calibrated at the electromagnetic scale, and subsequently the cells that
form the calorimeter objects belonging to the jet are resummed with a correction weight

applied. The weights are parameterised according to the energy density and position of
the cell. In order to have a reference jet from which to obtain the calibration weights, jet
finding is performed on simulated particles (at the true level before entering the detector)
and the reconstructed energy is compared to the true energy: the weights are then obtained
via 2 minimization on a simulated dijet sample with a specific jet finding algorithm.
Global Sequential Calibration The Global Sequential Calibration (GS) uses correction factors
that depend on the longitudinal and transverse jet structure properties. It is applied as an
additional correction on top of EM+JES calibrated jets and aims to improve the jet energy
resolution without modifying the average jet response. The variables used to parameterise
the correction are:
 the fraction of energy in a given layer flayer = EEMlayer/E
jet for one or more calorimeter
layers depending on the jet pseudorapidity
 the jet width calculated as the average distance of a jet constituent to the jet direction,
weighted with the energy of the constituent.
The correction is derived as a multiplicative factor to be applied to the full four-vector by
inverting the jet response at the EM+JES scale as a function of each of the variables listed
above. Different variables are used sequentially: jets corrected with the n-1th variable
factor are used as input to calculate the jet response as a function of the nth variable and
so forth. The dependence of the jet energy scale from the jet longitudinal and transverse
properties is removed, therefore reducing the width of the jet energy distribution, but the
average response is left unchanged.
Local Cluster Weighting In the Local Cluster Weighting calibration scheme (LC, or LCW)
the energy of topological clusters is corrected first, and jet finding is then performed on
the calibrated objects. The corrections are modular, and only topological clusters that are
classified as hadronic from their characteristics are corrected with a weight that depends on
the position and the energy density of the constituent cells. In this case the weights have
been derived from simulation of single pions and verified in test beam measurements [113].
Jet level corrections are then applied after the jet finding in order to account for unclustered
energy and dead material. Thanks to the cluster classification, the scaling factors applied
to the electromagnetic energy deposits can be as close as possible to unity.
Methods that apply corrections directly to jets are physics dependent, since the cell weights
have been obtained by comparing the reconstructed jet energy to the energy of particle jets from
Monte-Carlo for a specific sample (the nominal dijet sample described in Section 1.4.2) and a
specific jet finding procedure. The advantage of the Local Cell Weighting scheme is that the
corrections applied to the calorimeter objects are modular and have been derived from simulation
of single particle, and do not depend on the physics sample or on the jet finding algorithm. All
inputs to the various jet calibration schemes in Monte Carlo simulations (e.g. longitudinal and
transverse jet properties for the Global Sequential Calibration, cell energy densities for Global
Cell Weighting) have been compared to measurements using the first ATLAS data, and shown
to be in reasonable agreement [53]. In the case of the jet width, where data and Monte Carlo
discrepancies are not fully understood, the relative Global Sequential Calibration correction is
not applied.
These refined calibrations can be employed in precision analyses where jet resolution effects
need to be reduced to a minimum. The Local Cluster Weighting scheme has been particularly
relevant in the very first ATLAS data when calculating the sum of all energy deposited in the
calorimeter (ET ) or the missing transverse momentum, since single calibrated topoclusters
have been used before jets were fully commissioned.
Additional corrections for alternative calibration schemes
The offset correction for pile-up is only used in combination with the EM+JES and Global
Sequential calibration schemes; event by event and jet by jet correction techniques to account
for the average increase of the jet energy due to pile-up have been studied in Monte Carlo and
are undergoing commissioning with data.
The correction to the jet origin is commissioned for the Global Cell Weighting scheme in
addition to the EM+JES and Global Sequential calibrations, and corrects the energy of each
single cell belonging to the jet to point to the primary interaction vertex before the energy
weighting step. Locally calibrated topoclusters included in a jet also have an origin correction
applied to their direction.
Both the Local and Global Cell Weighting schemes need an additional JES correction similar
to the last step of Section 3.2.1, to fully restore the jet energy scale. The final JES correction is
applied to these calibrations with the following differences:
1. The starting scale for the derivation and application of the correction is the calibrated
scale, not the electromagnetic scale;
2. The correction function is not forced to pass through the three points derived from a
Groom distribution, since the non-compensation is partially recovered by the previous
calibration step.
In the following, the Local Cluster Weighting and Global Cell Weighting after this correction
has been applied will be denoted as LC+JES and GCW+JES, while the Global Sequential
Calibration will be denoted as GS.
The full jet reconstruction procedure for jets calibrated with the Global Sequential Calibration,
Global Cell Weighting and Local Cell Weighting schemes is pictured in Fig. 3.7.
Chapter 4.
Jet reconstruction performance
Since jets are key ingredients for measurements at hadron colliders, the evaluation of their
performance is particularly relevant for physics analyses.
The two key quantities that are input to physics analyses are the jet energy and transverse
momentum response and resolution. The jet energy response and resolution are respectively
connected to the mean and the width of the distribution of the energies of a jet originating from
an object whose true energy is within a given (narrow) range. Jet calibration techniques such
as those described in Chapter 5 are designed to restore the jet energy scale and could help to
reduce the fluctuation in the reconstructed jet energy. The performance of jet reconstruction
can be tested using Monte Carlo simulation by comparing reconstructed jets to truth particle
jets, but it is particularly important that the performance of Monte Carlo based jet energy
calibrations applied to data is tested using the data itself, using in-situ techniques.
This chapter is concerned with the methods used to quantify the performance of jet re-
construction and calibration in terms of the jet energy and pT response and resolution. It
starts with a brief description of the jet energy resolution and its measurement in ATLAS in
Section 4.1. Techniques that make use of data taken in 2010 to evaluate the jet energy scale
in-situ are described in Section 4.2 (these two sections are complemented by Appendix A, where
additional details on the various techniques can be found). The full evaluation of the jet energy
scale uncertainty is described in the next chapter.
The various jet reconstruction steps also need to be validated before the full procedure is
deployed in the software used for data taking. For the full 2010 data taking period, this has been
done using Monte Carlo simulation. The tools used for this purpose (the JetPerformance
package) are described in Appendix B, and the figures of merit and plots are reported in
Section 4.3
4.1. Jet energy resolution
The energy of a reconstructed jet can fluctuate with respect to the initial energy of the originating
object for a number of reasons, related to the behaviour of partons and jets dictated by the
underlying QCD theory or connected to instrumental effects. Among these are particles escaping
the finite jet area or additional particles not from the hard scatter being collected within
the jet, the statistical fluctuations inherent to the energy measurement in calorimeters, the
inhomogeneous energy losses between active and passive material, calorimeter non uniformities
and non linearities...
Quantifying the magnitude of these fluctuations in terms of the width of the jet response
distribution1 is essential in order to recover correspondence between the jet energy measured
in the calorimeter and the energy of the underlying physics object. The knowledge of the jet
resolution has an impact on the jet cross section measurement described in this thesis: knowing
how well the Monte Carlo simulation describes jet energy resolution in the data is necessary in
order to unfold all detector effects and compare the measurement to theory.
The two different methods to measure the jet energy resolution in data are employed by
ATLAS are briefly described in Section 4.1.1 and more detail is given in Appendix A.1. The jet
energy resolution can also be measured in Monte Carlo (Section 4.3.3), by taking the width of
the jet response distribution (where the jet response is defined as in Section 3.2.1) and dividing
it by its mean2. This quantity will be named truth resolution in the following.
Comparing the resolution evaluated with in-situ methods that are applied to data and Monte
Carlo can give confidence that the truth resolution is a good representation of the jet resolution
in data. In the following, the jet energy resolution will be replaced by the transverse momentum
resolution since the jet pT is the most commonly employed variable in physics analysis, and the
fractional resolution (
) will be used as benchmark quantity.
4.1.1. In-situ determination of the jet energy resolution
ATLAS employs two different techniques to measure the jet energy resolution using calorimeter
observables: the dijet balance method and the bisector method, described in References [114,115].
1Most effects mentioned here lead to a Gaussian distribution of the jet response, but some contribute to its
tails. As a first iteration, most techniques used to estimate the jet energy resolution are mainly directed
towards the measurement of the Gaussian width of the jet response distribution.
2It can be shown that the fractional jet pT resolution in Monte Carlo can be approximated by the Gaussian
width of the pT response distribution R as in a given (p
T , ) bin and dividing it by the mean response
using the assumption of narrow ptrueT bins.
The two techniques rely on different assumptions and have different systematic uncertainties:
two independent measurements of the jet energy resolution can be compared and they can
provide separate cross-checks to the Monte Carlo simulation.
Fluctuations in the jet energy can be due to both physics effects (e.g. radiation that is not
captured in the jet or the underlying assumption in the methods that events have a pure dijet
topology) and to calibration and detector effects. The techniques used in ATLAS aim to only
account for the calorimeter-related jet energy fluctuations in the evaluation of the jet energy
resolution, and verify in data the assumptions that involve the fluctuations of the jet energy due
to physics effects as simulated in Monte Carlo.
Dijet balance method
The dijet balance method [116] relies on energy conservation in the transverse plane in the case
of dijet events. Events with such topology are selected by applying a cut on the azimuthal angle
between the two leading jets  so that they are back to back, and limiting the presence of
significant third jet radiation. Further details on this technique can be found in Appendix A.1.
The total systematic uncertainty for the dijet balance method amounts to 4-6% in the p
T range
of 20-500 GeV.
Bisector method
The bisector method [117] uses the decomposition of the vector sum of the two leading jet four
momenta PT to estimate the jet energy resolution. The jet transverse momentum resolution
is estimated using the variances of the projections of PT, one on the axis that bisects the
angle between the two jets and the other on the axis orthogonal to it. This estimate uses the
underlying assumption that at particle level, the two components of the imbalance vector will
have equal fluctuations, and further imbalances are due to fluctuations from calorimeter effects.
The event selection follows that of the dijet balance method to select good dijet topologies, but
removing the cut on the angle between the two jets. Further details on this technique can be
found in Appendix A.1. The total systematic uncertainty for the bisector method amounts to
3-4% in the p
T range of 20-500 GeV.
4.1.2. Results from in-situ methods and comparison to Monte Carlo
The fractional jet transverse momentum resolution can be parameterised as:
 c (4.1)
where the first term includes the stochastic sources of fluctuations that are independent of
the energy but whose relative impact decreases linearly with energy (e.g. electronics noise,
remaining offset from pile-up), the second term includes all all sources that are of statistical
nature and follow Poisson statistics (e.g. signal sampling), and the constant term is related to
detector effects that are a constant fraction of energy.
The fractional resolution derived from the Monte Carlo simulation with each of the two
methods can be fitted using the parameterisation above, and compared to the fractional
resolution in data. The result is shown for the bisector method in Figure 4.1 for the calibration
schemes described in Section 3.2.2: the Local Cluster Weighting (LCW), Global Cell Weighting
(GCW), the Global Sequential calibration (GS) and the EM+JES scheme.

and the EM+JES scheme. The lower ratio plot shows the relative difference between the
Monte Carlo parameterisation and the data points. Figure from [115].
The results for both methods in data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulations within
the given systematic and statistical uncertainties of about 10%. The final systematic uncertainty
on the jet resolution for each rapidity region is assigned from the weighted average of the
systematic errors on the relative data/Monte Carlo difference, and it is flat as a function of pT .
Choice of jet energy resolution parameterisation and its uncertainties
The agreement for the in-situ results in data and Monte Carlo gives confidence that the truth
Monte Carlo resolution can be trusted to represent the resolution in data. The parameterisation
of the Monte Carlo resolution from [115] (also shown as the blue line of Figure 4.8 in the
case of anti-kt jets with R=0.6) is taken as a baseline for all ATLAS analyses and it will be
referred in the following as the default ATLAS jet energy resolution. In this analysis no isolation
cut is applied on the jet, only the leading jets are considered and the fitting range for the
parameterisation is 30< p
T <500 GeV since this is the range where in-situ data is available.
In the kinematic range covered by the in-situ data (jets with 30  pT < 500 GeV and |y| <
2.8), the comparison of the jet resolution measured with in-situ techniques in data and Monte
Carlo shows agreement within the systematic uncertainties of less than 10%, as mentioned
above. Outside the kinematic range of in-situ measurements, the Monte Carlo parameterization
is kept but the uncertainty is conservatively increased as follows:
 Jets with pT=10 GeV are assigned an uncertainty that is three times that of jets with
pT=30 GeV. This covers the differences in the jet resolution when the Monte Carlo
parameterization is derived taking into account resolution values starting from 15 GeV
with respect to the default starting value of 30 GeV (as detailed in Section 4.3.3). The
uncertainty varies smoothly from its value at 10 GeV to the value at 30 GeV, as a function
of pT .
 Jets with pT <1000 GeV are assigned an uncertainty that is twice as much that of jets
with pT=500 GeV, with a linearly varying uncertainty between the two values.
 Jets with pT >1000 GeV are assigned the uncertainty of jets with pT=1000 GeV.
4.2. In-situ validation of the jet energy scale calibration
Jet reconstruction, and in particular the jet energy scale calibration based on Monte Carlo, can
be validated using in-situ techniques comparing the first 35-38 pb1 of 2010 ATLAS data and
the Monte Carlo simulation results. In-situ techniques use well measured benchmark objects
that balance the jet to evaluate the relative and absolute jet energy scale. The transverse
momentum balance in two-jet QCD events is used to check the uniformity of the calibration
in pseudorapidity with the  intercalibration method. The absolute energy scale at low jet
pT is validated exploiting the pT balance of the jet with well-measured photons in the direct
balance and missing-ET projection fraction (MPF) methods [118], while the balance between
the leading jet and the recoil system is used as a probe for high-pT jets [119]. Jets made of
tracks measured in the inner detector can also be compared to the corresponding jet measured
from calorimeter energy deposits [120].
This section describes in detail the method to evaluate the relative intercalibration in data, as
it is an important ingredient in the evaluation of the jet energy scale uncertainty. More details
and data/Monte Carlo comparison plots to validate the jet energy scale calibration using the
other in-situ techniques can be found in the references mentioned above and in Appendix A.2.
4.2.1. Dijet balance
As shown in Fig. 3.5, the calorimeter response at the electromagnetic scale is not uniform
in pseudorapidity due to different material upstream of the calorimeters and to the varying
calorimeter technology. The EM+JES calibration equalizes the jet response in both energy and
pseudorapidity as shown in Section 4.3, but the complex calorimeter geometry of the ATLAS
detector and shifts in the baseline electromagnetic scale that are the starting point for the
EM+JES calibration might not be reflected perfectly in the Monte Carlo simulation. For this
reason, the relative intercalibration of jets in different pseudorapidity regions needs to be studied
in data.
The relative response of endcap to central jets is evaluated using the pT balance techniques
described in [54,121]. These techniques employ di-jet events to balance the transverse momentum
of a probe jet with the p
T of a reference jet, exploiting the momentum balance due to transverse
momentum conservation. In such events, the response of the forward jets is measured relative to
that of the better measured central jets. The measurement is performed using the 2010 ATLAS
dataset, as well as for several MC generator event samples.
In the standard intercalibration method, a fixed reference region is chosen in the central
calorimeter region (|| <0.8). Jets falling within this pseudorapidity range are treated as the
reference jets, while jets outside this region are considered as probe jets. Figure 4.2 (a) shows a
schematic representation of the jet topology studied in the intercalibration method.
The asymmetry A is defined as twice the ratio between the difference and the sum of the

The asymmetry distribution is then used to measure the average response of the probe jets

Only events where the two leading jets have a p

jet transverse momentum and on the angle between the two leading jets used in the analysis are
applied in order to reject topologies with relevant third jet radiation.
The so-called Matrix method employs a similar technique to evaluate the relative jet response
but overcomes the necessity of having a jet in the reference region, therefore increasing the
available statistics. The definition of probe and reference jets is replaced by left and right jets
depending on the relative pseudorapidity (where left > right), as shown in Figure 4.2 (b).

Equations 4.3 and 4.2 still hold for the Matrix method when replacing the reference jet

is evaluated for each bin of left (called bin i in the following),
right (bin j) and for each p
T bin (bin k). A system of linear equations for each of the p
bins is minimized to obtain the relative correction factors cik, cjk in each of the , p
T bins,
taking into account the statistical uncertainty on the relative response Rijk:
S(c1k, ..., cNk) =
Rijk
(cikRijk  cjk))2 +X(cik), (4.4)
The function X(cik) is used to suppress deviations from unity of the average corrections as
explained in [121]. Each correction factor is then rescaled so that the reference region || <0.8
has a unitary response.
Dijet balance in MC samples
The relative jet response is also measured in the nominal Pythia sample and for three other
Monte Carlo samples: QCD jet events simulated in Pythia with the Perugia2010 Pythia tune,
events simulated using the combination of the Alpgen generator interfaced to Herwig and
Jimmy (Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy) and events simulated using the Herwig++ generator.
Details on the nominal sample and on the other generators can be found in Section 1.4.2.
The Perugia2010 Pythia tune is an independent set of parameters for the Pythia generator,
derived using mainly hadron collider data with an increased final state radiation to better
reproduce the jet shapes and hadronic event shapes using LEP and Tevatron data [122]. In this
tune, parameters sensitive to the production of particles with strangeness and related to jet
fragmentation have also been adjusted. The Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy and Herwig++
samples are used to test the effects of a different modelling of the hard subprocess and soft
processes with respect to the nominal Pythia sample used to derive the calibration.
Results
The data/Monte Carlo comparison of the relative response shows that the relative calibration
of jets in the ATLAS calorimeters is fairly well understood for the whole calorimeter region
for p
T > 60 GeV: data and the various Monte Carlo simulations agree to better than 2%
in the central and endcap region (|| < 2.8) and to 5% in the forward region, as shown in
the two example plots in Fig.4.3. For lower average transverse momenta, the different Monte
Carlo samples show a larger deviation with respect to data: the MC predictions for the relative
jet response diverge for low-pT forward jets, while the data lie between the predictions. This
effect has been investigated and attributed to residual low-pT effects, modeled differently by the
different generators, and further studies are ongoing at the time of writing this thesis.

4.3. Monte Carlo based performance studies
Since the start of data taking, the JetPerformance software package in the Athena ATLAS
framework has been employed for assessing the performance of the jet reconstruction. Plots
produced with the JetPerformance package have been used to validate the correction
constants for the various step of the EM+JES calibration scheme that is used as default in both
the ATLAS datasets considered in this thesis. More details on this software package are given
in Appendix B.
The JetPerformance package aims to provide the standard infrastructure for physicists in
the ATLAS experiment to evaluate the performance of the jet reconstruction. This software
compares the reconstructed jets from a chosen sample to a collection of reference objects that can
provide Monte Carlo truth benchmarks (such as particle jets built from Monte Carlo simulation),
or in-situ energy balance (such as recoiling jets or photons in the same event). The performance
of the jet reconstruction is then measured in kinematic and spatial bins in terms of benchmark
quantities such as:
 jet response, defined in Equation 3.1 when energy is the chosen kinematic variable;
 jet resolution, defined as the ratio of the width of the distribution of the chosen kinematic
variable and its average;
 jet purity3, defined as the ratio between the number of calorimeter jets with a spatially
matched Monte Carlo truth jet and the total number of calorimeter jets;
 jet efficiency3, defined as the ratio between the number of Monte Carlo truth jets with a
spatially matched calorimeter jet and the total number of Monte Carlo truth jets.
A selection of plots produced with the JetPerformance package for the validation of the
jet reconstruction for 2010 data is shown in the following. Only plots for anti-kt with distance
parameter 0.6 are shown in the following, with similar results obtained for a distance parameter
of 0.4. The jet selection and matching criteria are the same as detailed in Section 3.2.1, unless
the plot is labeled as inclusive jets: in that case, no jet isolation cut is applied.
4.3.1. Energy and pT response
Figure 4.4,the energy and pT response are shown for jets after the EM+JES calibration in the
nominal Monte Carlo sample. In the barrel region 0.3 < || < 0.8 the jet response is restored
to about 2% at low p
T and to better than 1% for p
T > 30 GeV. In the endcap and forward
region, the closure to unity is better than 1% for p
T > 20 GeV, while the energy response is
within 1% for jets with transverse momentum above 30 GeV. The residual non-closure is taken
as a source of systematic uncertainty, as described in Chapter 5.
In Figure 4.5 the pT response for jets built from either topocluster or topotower inputs (the
latter are called simply Tower) and calibrated with the various ATLAS calibration schemes is
shown in the case of the nominal Monte Carlo sample, for jets measured in the whole detector
pseudorapidity (|| <4.5). The average response for all calibrations is restored to the hadronic
scale to better than 1%.
4.3.2. Effect of pile-up on the jet response
The effect of the pile-up offset correction is shown in Figure 4.6. Here the response for pile-up
in a Monte Carlo sample with an average of 5 additional interactions per event is shown, with
and without the offset correction. Since truth jets do not contain particles from any additional
interaction, the comparison of the EM+JES-calibrated jets with and without the offset correction
shows that the correction reduces the pile-up contribution to the jet energy by about 10% for
both topocluster and tower jets. The better performance of the offset correction in the case
of tower jets with respect to topocluster jets is due to the averaging of the number of towers
present a in topocluster jet for the jet-level correction, while the actual number of towers is used

4.3.3. Jet energy resolution from Monte Carlo
The fractional pT resolution for isolated jets in the nominal Pythia Monte Carlo sample for
anti-kt R=0.6 jets is shown in figure 4.7. This plot reflects how the transverse momentum
resolution decreases with higher jet pseudorapidities, since  determines the energy of a jet
of a given pT (E  pTcosh||). Since the dominant terms in the fractional resolution at low
pT are divided by the energy or by its square root, the jet resolution improves at higher jet
pseudorapidities.

These results can be fitted with the parameterisation of Equation 4.1 and compared with
those obtained in Monte Carlo using the standard jet resolution analysis and described in
Section 4.1.2. The main differences between the way the two parameterisations were derived are:
1. Isolated jets are used to estimate the resolution of Figure 4.7, no isolation cut is applied in
the standard analysis;
2. All isolated jets in the events are used for Figure 4.7, while only the two leading jets are
considered in the standard analysis;
3. The fit range used in the parameterisation is 15< p
T <500 GeV while 30< p
T <500
GeV is used for the standard analysis.
For these reasons, the parameterisation derived using the JetPerformance analysis will
not coincide with the default parameterisation, as shown in Figure 4.8. The disagreement is
particularly evident at low jet pT since no information below p
T =30 GeV is used in the default
fit, and in the endcap and forward region where the number of available points is reduced
because of the kinematic limit and the fit is more constrained by the low pT points that are
not used in the default fit. To cover this discrepancy and possible systematics due to different
event topologies and limited fit range, the error for the default jet resolution parameterisation
below p
T =30 GeV is increased to cover the Monte Carlo parameterisation as mentioned in
Section 4.1.2.
4.3.4. Monte Carlo purity and efficiency
Figure 4.9 shows the reconstruction purity and efficiency of EM+JES calibrated topocluster jets
in the nominal Monte Carlo sample in the central, endcap and forward detector regions. The
isolation cut has been removed for these plots, and the 15 GeV pT cut on truth jets has been
lowered to 7 GeV for the purity plot to avoid biasing the matching for reconstructed jets at low
pT . The jet reconstruction efficiency in the Monte Carlo simulation is above 95% for the whole
kinematic range used in the measurement, while the purity of the reconstructed jet sample is
above 94%. Both efficiency and purity grow to unity as the energy of the jets increases for
higher pseudorapidities.

Chapter 5.
Jet Energy Scale Uncertainty
The uncertainty of the measurement of the jet kinematics after the calibration (jet energy scale
uncertainty, or JES uncertainty) is the dominant experimental uncertainty for numerous physics
results and for the inclusive jet cross section measurement discussed in this thesis.
A first estimate of the JES uncertainty in the ATLAS detector was provided as described in
Reference [124] and summarised in Appendix D. Its evaluation was largely based on information
available before the first LHC collisions and it exploited transverse momentum balance in di-jet
events. The calibration and the JES uncertainty were updated for the full 2010 dataset, as
described in References [110,125]. The EM+JES calibration scheme described in Section 3.2.1
has been used to calibrate jets. Data-derived techniques have been employed to correct the
calorimeter response and estimate its uncertainty. These include the calibration of the absolute
electromagnetic energy scale of the calorimeters from the analysis of Z-boson decays in the
electron channel (Z  ee) [77] as described in Section 2.5.1, precise in-situ measurements of
the single hadron response [47,48] and measurements of the calorimeter cell noise suppression
uncertainty from data. Employing in-situ techniques allows a significant reduction of the JES
uncertainty in the central detector region with respect to the previous estimate. Confidence in a
reduced JES uncertainty is gained from the increased knowledge of the detector performance
obtained during the analysis of the first year of ATLAS data [4754] and from the results from
the JES validation using in-situ techniques detailed in Section 4.2.
This chapter is concerned with the full 2010 calibration and JES uncertainty analysis and will
only show results for EM+JES calibrated jets built with a distance parameter of R=0.6, unless
otherwise noted. The outline of this chapter is as follows: Section 5.1 describes the details
of the analysis employed for the estimate of the jet energy scale uncertainty, such as the jet
selections applied to the Monte Carlo simulation and data samples. The sources of systematic
uncertainties for the jet energy scale and their derivation using simulated and collision data are
detailed in Section 5.2. The effect of pile-up on the jet energy scale and its related uncertainty
is discussed in Section 5.3. The combination of the individual uncertainty contributions is
described in Section 5.4. Results, and their validation using in-situ techniques, are in Section 5.5.
Considerations on the applicability of the estimate of the JES uncertainty to different event
topologies and flavour compositions are reported in Section 5.6.
5.1. Analysis details
The JES systematic uncertainty is derived combining information from in-situ and single pion
test-beam measurements, uncertainties on the material budget of the ATLAS detector, the
description of the electronic noise, and the Monte Carlo modelling used in the event generation.
Test samples with differing conditions with respect to the the nominal Pythia QCD Monte
Carlo sample described in Section 3.2 are employed to provide an estimate of the systematic
effects contributing to the JES uncertainty. The energy scale of jets for the nominal and the
systematic Monte Carlo samples is calibrated using the EM+JES scheme (3.2.1).
The JES uncertainty is provided for jets with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV
and in the full pseudorapidity range of || < 4.5 in which jets are measured in ATLAS. The
JES uncertainty is estimated as a function of calibrated jet transverse momentum (p
T ) and
pseudorapidity . The pT binning follows the choices made for the inclusive jet cross section
measurement of Chapter 6. The pseudorapidity bins used for the estimate of the JES uncertainty
divide the ATLAS detector in the seven  regions specified in Table 5.1 and following the
nomenclature used in Fig. 3.5.

uncertainty.

3.2 < ||  3.6

The JES systematic uncertainty for all jets with pseudorapidity beyond || = 0.8 is determined
using the JES uncertainty for the central barrel region (0.3 < || < 0.8) as a baseline1, and
adding a contribution from the relative calibration of the jets with respect to the central barrel
region. This choice is motivated by the better knowledge of the detector geometry in the central
region, and by the use of test-beam measurements only extending to the Tile calorimeter barrel
for the estimate of the calorimeter response uncertainties.
5.1.1. Selection of jets for systematic studies in Monte Carlo studies
For the JES uncertainty studies the jet energy response at the calibrated energy scale is obtained
for the nominal and each of the alternative Monte Carlo samples using reconstructed calorimeter
jets matched to MC truth particle jets within a cone of R = 0.3. Only MC truth jets with
ptruthT > 15 GeV and calorimeter jets with a p
T > 7 GeV after calibration are considered.
The JES uncertainty components derived from simulation are obtained by studying the
average calorimeter energy response of calibrated jets for the nominal and each of the alternative
Monte Carlo samples. This average response, defined as R =
EEM+JEScalo /Etruth
or R =
truth
, is obtained by matching isolated calorimeter jets to MC truth jets as described in
Section 3.2.1, but excluding the isolation cut for truth jets2. The JES systematic uncertainty is
derived for isolated jets in the full 2010 dataset, so that the topology dependence of the jet
energy scale in the presence of close-by jets can be factorised and the uncertainty considered
separately, as explained further in Section 5.6.
The calibrated response R is studied in bins of truth jet transverse momentum ptruthT . The
ptruthT corresponding to the bin centre is transformed on average to the calibrated p
T value using
a simple inversion procedure 3. The shifts between the Monte Carlo truth level ptruthT bin centres
and the reconstructed p
T bin centres are negligible with respect to the chosen pT bin widths.
Hence the average jet response can be obtained to good approximation as a function of p
1This is the largest fully instrumented region where test-beam information is available, as detailed in Section 5.2.2.
2The truth isolation cut has a negligible impact on the average jet response given that truth jets are matched
to isolated reconstructed jets.
3This means that one multiplies the value of the centre of the bin (in terms of truth jet pT ) by the average
response so to transform the coordinate of the x axis into p
T . This procedure is described in detail in
Reference [126].
5.2. Sources of jet energy scale uncertainty
This section focuses on the description of the sources of systematic uncertainties and their effect
on the response of EM+JES calibrated jets. The contributions to the JES systematics can be
divided in the categories below:
1. the uncertainty due to the JES calibration method (as described in Section 5.2.1);
2. the uncertainty due to the calorimeter response (Section 5.2.2);
3. the uncertainty due to the detector simulation (Section 5.2.3);
4. the uncertainty due to the physics model and parameters employed in the Monte Carlo
event generator (Section 5.2.4);
5. the uncertainty due to the relative calibration for jets with || > 0.8 (Section 5.2.5).
5.2.1. Uncertainty due to the JES calibration
After the nominal inclusive jet Monte Carlo simulation sample is calibrated with the JES
correction constants that were derived from the sample itself, the jet energy and pT response
still shows slight deviations from unity at low pT (non-closure). Figure 4.4 in Section 3.2.1 shows
the jet response for pT and energy as a function of p
T for the nominal Monte Carlo sample in
the barrel and endcap regions for anti-kt jets with R=0.6.
Any deviation from unity (non-closure) in p
T and energy response after the application
of the JES to the nominal Monte Carlo sample implies that the kinematics of the calibrated
calorimeter jet are not restored to that of the corresponding particle jets. This is mostly due
to using the same correction factor for energy and transverse momentum. In the case of a
non-zero jet mass that does not reflect the truth jet mass, restoring only the jet energy and
pseudorapidity will lead to a bias in the pT calibration. Further biases in the energy response at
low pT can be due to the jet thresholds used to derive and to apply the constants, respectively 7
GeV at a JES calibrated with previously obtained calibration constants4 and 10 GeV at the
electromagnetic scale. The use of cross section weights for the separate samples, considered only
4This is a bootstrapping problem since jets that are used to derive new calibration constants still must satisfy
the pT >7 GeV reconstruction threshold. A solution to this could be to decrease the reconstruction threshold
and/or use two iterations for deriving the calibration so that all jets with pT >7 GeV used for physics
analysis are correctly calibrated, but it wasnt considered practical in the timescale needed to provide the
calibration constants for the reprocessing.
in the JES uncertainty analysis, also influences the results of the fit to the response distribution
and can lead to non closure at low pT .
The systematic uncertainty due to the non-closure of the nominal JES calibration is taken as
the largest deviation of the response from unity between energy and pT.
Given that the same JES calibration constants are applied to all samples with systematic
variations used for the derivation of the JES uncertainty, the correlation of the non-closure term
with the other uncertainty components needs to be considered. The non-closure uncertainty is
considered uncorrelated to the other JES uncertainty components, given that:
1. the JES calibration constants vary slowly within the pT bins used for the estimate of the
JES uncertainty;
2. the systematic variations produce only small effects on the jet pT spectrum within a bin.
For these reasons, the variation of the calibration constants due to systematic effects can be
factorized from the variation of the jet energy. This variation will effectively cancel when taking
the ratio of the jet response for any of the systematic samples and the jet response in the nominal
sample. The non-closure term becomes then the only uncertainty source where the variation of
the calibration constants is accounted for: it can therefore be considered uncorrelated to the
other uncertainty contributions and added in quadrature to evaluate the total JES systematic
uncertainty.
5.2.2. Uncertainty on the calorimeter response
The response and corresponding uncertainties for single particles interacting in the ATLAS
calorimeters can be propagated to the energy deposits comprised by jets. This can then be
used to derive the calorimeter jet energy scale uncertainty in the central calorimeter region, as
detailed in References [47,48,127].
Test-beam data and ATLAS data at 900 GeV and 7 TeV are employed to evaluate the
uncertainties on the calorimeter response for single particles. The insitu measurement of the
single particle response reduces significantly the uncertainties due to the limited knowledge of
the exact detector geometry, in particular those due to the presence of additional dead material,
and the modeling of the hadronic interactions of particles in the detector.
Calorimeter response uncertainty from single hadron response studies
The ATLAS simulation infrastructure is able to link the true calorimeter energy deposits in
each calorimeter cell to the generated particles. The jet calorimeter response uncertainty can be
obtained from the uncertainty on the response of each particle in the jet in simulated events. In
this way the jet response can be deconvoluted from the response of the individual particles
forming jets and the JES uncertainty can be determined using the single particle response
uncertainties.
The following single particle response measurements are used to estimate the single particle
uncertainties:
 the single hadron energy measured in the ATLAS detector for a cone around an isolated track
with respect to the track momentum (E/p) in the momentum range from 0.5 < p < 20 GeV,
 the pion response measurements performed in the 2004 combined ATLAS test-beam,
where a full slice of the ATLAS detector has been exposed to pion beams with momenta
between 20 and 350 GeV [128].
Uncertainty contributions for single particle energy deposits
The contributions to the uncertainties of the single particle energy deposits used in the
pseudoexperiments are listed below. The names in bold in the following list will be used to
characterise the single subcomponents of the calorimeter uncertainty in the following.
E/p E/p studies in the ATLAS detector evaluate the calorimeter response for single isolated
hadrons. For particles below 20 GeV, the discrepancy between data and Monte Carlo
simulation from the E/p analysis of 7 TeV data observed in Reference [127] is taken as
the systematic uncertainty for the energy deposit of each charged particle composing the
jet, and the statistical error on the measurement is considered as an input for the pseudo
experiments. The bottom panel of Figure 5.1 shows the E/p data/Monte Carlo ratio in a
sample  and pT bin and the systematic uncertainties as the grey band.
E/p acceptance, cluster thresholds Additional uncertainties that could affect the combina-
tion of the responses for the single particles within the jet are also taken into account.
These effects include energy deposits outside the chosen inclusion radius around the track
(leading to a negligible contribution), calorimeter acceptance due to material upstream of
the calorimeters and topological cluster threshold effects.

Combined Test Beam (CTB) Test-beam measurements of pions described in Reference [128]
are used to estimate the ratio between data and Monte Carlo simulation for charged pions
between 20 and 350 GeV, with the addition of systematic uncertainties that take into
account the difference in the setup of the test-beam and the full ATLAS detector where
the single particle analysis is performed.
Neutral particles and antiprotons No test-beam measurements are available for neutral
hadronic particles and antiprotons. Specific data and Monte Carlo comparisons and
Geant4 studies have been performed to derive an uncertainty on these particles [94]
(K0s have not been considered since they mostly decay into pions before reaching the
calorimeters).
High momentum particles At high transverse momentum, the dominating contribution to the
calorimeter response uncertainties is due to particles with p >400 GeV. The uncertainty for
these particles has been conservatively estimated as 10% to take into account calorimeter
non linearities and longitudinal leakage.
Electromagnetic energy scale (LAr) The uncertainty on the electromagnetic energy scale of
the Liquid Argon calorimeter amounts to 1.5% after the in-situ Z  ee calibration as
described in Section 2.5.1. This uncertainty is applied to particles not included in the
single particle analysis, e.g. photons from 0 decays and electrons.
Electromagnetic energy scale (Tile) For the hadronic calorimeter, the electromagnetic scale
uncertainty is estimated considering the ratio of the electromagnetic scale response of
minimum ionizing low-energy muons in test-beam data and in Monte Carlo as described in
Section 2.5.2. This uncertainty amounts to 3%, and it is applied to all particles interacting
in the Tile calorimeter not included in the single particle analysis, e.g. hadrons with
momentum above 20 GeV.
The systematic effects due to the presence of additional material in front of the calorimeters
are only constrained for particles included in in-situ measurements (hadrons with momenta
p < 20 GeV, electrons and photons). The remaining uncertainty due to additional material is
estimated using dedicated Monte Carlo simulation samples detailed in 5.2.3 where the detector
material is systematically varied within the current uncertainty on the detector geometry
knowledge.
Evaluation of the calorimeter jet energy scale uncertainty
The starting point for the evaluation of the calorimeter jet energy scale uncertainty through
single particle studies is a series of pseudo experiments. In each pseudo experiment the energy
deposits for each single particle included in a jet are varied within statistical and systematic
uncertainties depending on the nature and momentum of the particle as mentioned above. Each
pseudo experiment contributes to a spread of possible jet energies, where the energy deposits
that constitute every jet have been varied within the uncertainties estimated as described in
the previous section. The mean relative energy shift, defined as the ratio between the jet
energy estimated from the variations on the energy deposits and that obtained from the central
value of each energy deposit, is estimated for each pseudo experiment as shown in Figure 5.2
(a). The overall uncertainty from single particle studies is derived from a Gaussian fit of the
distribution of the mean energy shifts for all pseudoexperiments, for each p
T and  bin, as
shown in Figure 5.2 (b).
Figure 5.3 shows the contribution to the JES uncertainty from the calorimeter response,

relative jet energy scale (also called bias in the following) is up to  1 %, and the uncertainty
on the shift is from 1 to 3 %. The total envelope (the shift added linearly to the uncertainty) of
about 1.5-4% depending on the jet transverse momentum is taken as the relative JES calorimeter
uncertainty.
Correlations in the calorimeter uncertainty sources
The pseudo experiment approach adopted to derive the calorimeter uncertainty also provides
the tools to derive the correlation matrix, shown for anti-kt R=0.6 in Figure 5.4. Neighboring
bins where particles of the same momentum enter the jets have almost full correlation, but
decorrelations are present between low and high pT bins.

5.2.3. Uncertainties due to the detector simulation
The effects related to the detector and calorimeter simulation and to the experimental conditions
that could contribute to the jet energy scale uncertainty are listed below, and described in more
detail in this Section.
1. The electronic noise in data could differ from the noise description used in the Monte
Carlo simulation, and these differences propagated to the Monte Carlo based calibration
constants. The effect on the jet energy scale is accounted for in the topocluster noise
thresholds uncertainty.
2. The jet energy scale is affected by an increased amount of inactive material for particles
not included in in-situ measurements. The energy deposited by particles in the material
that is not included in the simulation is neither accounted for in the present calibration
procedure and it is only partially included in the uncertainty on the calorimeter response.
The full effect of additional dead material on the jet energy scale is estimated within the
additional detector material uncertainty.
Calorimeter cell noise thresholds
As described in Section 3.1.3, topoclusters constitute the input to the jet reconstruction. They
are constructed based on the signal-to-noise ratio of calorimeter cells, where the noise refers to
the RMS of the measured cell energy distribution in events with no energy depositions from
collision events from dedicated runs (e.g. random triggers or empty bunches). In the case of
data, the noise can change over time5, while the noise RMS used in the simulation are fixed at
the time of the production of the simulated data. This, and the underlying assumptions used for
the noise modelling in the Monte Carlo simulation, can lead to differences in the cluster shapes
and to the presence of fake clusters, which in turn affect the jet reconstruction and calibration.
Noise modeling enters the Monte Carlo simulation in the following ways, as schematically
pictured in Figure 5.5:
1. the simulated electronic noise (dark red area) is superimposed to the signal of particles
passing through active material of the calorimeters (blue curve);
2. cell-level constants for the RMS of the energy distribution from random events are stored
in the database and applied during the topocluster reconstruction (light red curve and
magenta lines).
The timescale required for the final JES uncertainty estimate did not allow the production
of dedicated Monte Carlo samples where the noise injected in the Monte Carlo simulation
was modified for selected cells. Instead, the topocluster thresholds were varied according to
noise in data, using noise constants taken from a cell noise table of a selected data run in the
reconstruction of Monte Carlo jets. This means that the actual energy and noise simulated in
the MC are left unchanged, but the values of the thresholds used to include a given calorimeter
cell in a topocluster are based on the noise RMS for the cell as measured in data. Pictorially,
this implies that the light red curve in Figure 5.5 is substituted with the noise distribution in
data, since the threshold constants are obtained from the parameterization of the data-derived
noise distribution.
5Time-dependent noise changes for single cells in data are accounted for using periodic measurements of the
cell noise.

The noise recorded in data could be increased with respect to what is assumed by the
constants in the database for the topocluster thresholds, as shown in Figure 5.6 (a), and lead to
the creation of fake topoclusters or the inclusion of noisy cells in the topoclusters. The opposite
situation in Figure 5.6 (b) could happen if the cell has a narrower noise distribution with respect
to what predicted by the Monte Carlo. However, the cell noise constants extracted from data
only contain an average snapshot of the cells that are affected by non-nominal noise conditions
at any point in time.
To fully bracket both situations of Figure 5.6 and take into account possible variations in the
cell noise extracted from data with time, the case in which all topocluster thresholds are shifted
upwards and downwards is used as a cross check. Different Monte Carlo samples have been
reconstructed with signal-to-noise thresholds for all topocluster seed and neighbor cells modified
to be 10% and 7% higher and lower than the respective nominal values of 4 and 2.
The less conservative value of 7% is still found to fully bracket the shift in the jet response
to using the noise RMS from data in the low p
T region where the effect of varying the cell
noise thresholds is larger. Raising and lowering the cell thresholds by 7% leads to a roughly
symmetric effect on the jet response. This allows the use of the calorimeter cell noise thresholds
derived from data as a symmetric uncertainty that covers both the case when more and less
noise is present in data with respect to the simulation, and complements the estimate of the

calorimeter cell noise threshold uncertainty where data-derived thresholds are applied to Monte
Carlo simulation.
The response of jets reconstructed with the data-derived noise thresholds is compared to
the response of the jets reconstructed in exactly the same sample using the default MC noise
thresholds. The maximal observed change between the two samples is used to estimate the
uncertainty on the jet energy measurement due to the calorimeter cell noise modelling. As
shown for two example p
T bins in Figure 5.7, the uncertainty is found to be below 2% for the
whole pseudorapidity range, and negligible for jets with transverse momenta above 45 GeV. The
uncertainties assigned to jets with transverse momenta below 45 GeV are:
 1% and 2% for 20 GeV  pjetT < 30 GeV for anti-kt with distance parameters R=0.4 and
R=0.6 jets respectively,
 1% for 30 GeV  pjetT < 45 GeV.
Additional detector material
The jet energy scale is affected by possible deviations in the material description: its calibration
has been derived to correct for the energy lost under the assumption of the geometry simulated
in the nominal Monte Carlo sample. Simulated detector geometries that include systematic
variations to the material budget have been designed using test-beam measurements [71], in

addition to studies in 900 GeV and 7 TeV data [95,96,129,130]. Specific Monte Carlo samples
have been reconstructed using these distorted geometries.
In the case of uncertainties derived with in-situ techniques, such as those coming from the
E/p measurements detailed in Section 5.2.2, most of the effects on the jet response due to
additional dead material are already taken into account because the measurement is performed
directly on the ATLAS detector. However, the quality criteria on the track selection for the E/p
measurement effectively only allow particles that have not interacted in the inner detector to be
included in the measurement. Therefore the effect of dead material in the inner detector needs
to be taken into account for particles in the momentum range of the E/p measurement. This is
achieved using a specific Monte Carlo sample where the material budget is systematically varied
by adding 5% of material to the existing inner detector services. The uncertainty derived from
the comparison of the distorted material response to the nominal response is then scaled by the
fraction of particles within the E/p momentum range. This uncertainty is shown in Figure 5.8.
Electrons, photons and hadrons with momenta p > 20 GeV are not included in the E/p
measurements and therefore there is no in-situ estimate on the effect of any additional material
in front of the calorimeters. This uncertainty is estimated using a dedicated Monte Carlo
simulation sample where the overall detector material is systematically varied within the current
uncertainties of the detector geometry knowledge. The overall changes in the detector geometry
include:
 the 5% increase of inner detector material mentioned above;
 an extra 0.1 radiation length (X0) placed in the cryostat in front of the barrel of the
electromagnetic calorimeter (|| < 1.5);
 an extra 0.05 X0 placed between the presampler and the first layer of the electromagnetic
calorimeter;
 an extra 0.1 X0 placed in the cryostat after the barrel of the electromagnetic calorimeter;
 extra material is also present in the barrel-endcap transition region in the electromagnetic
calorimeter (1.37 < || < 1.52), corresponding to 1.5 times the amount of nominal material.
The uncertainty contribution due to the overall additional detector material is estimated by
comparing the calibrated EM+JES jet response in the Monte Carlo sample with the distorted
geometry with the nominal jet response (see Figure 5.8), and scaled by the average fraction of
electrons, photons and high transverse momentum hadrons within a jet as a function of pT .
In the endcap and forward calorimeter regions, a proper assessment of the detector material
in front of the calorimeters is difficult, and no estimate of the dead material uncertainty has
been attempted. The dead material uncertainty contribution in the endcap region is included in
the JES uncertainty from the measurement of the relative di-jet p
T imbalance between central
and endcap jets in data and Monte Carlo simulation that is described in Section 5.2.5.

5.2.4. Uncertainties due to the event modelling in the Monte Carlo
generators
The contributions to the JES uncertainty due to the modelling of the fragmentation, underlying
event and to the parameters of the Monte Carlo event generator are obtained using the
Perugia2010 Pythia tune and Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy Monte Carlo samples introduced
in Section 4.2.1. By comparing the nominal Pythia Monte Carlo sample to that simulated
with the Pythia Perugia2010 tune, the effects of soft physics modelling (e.g. underlying event)
are tested. The Perugia2010 tune provides in particular a better description of the internal jet
structure recently measured in ATLAS [131]. The Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy simulation
sample differs with respect to the nominal Pythia sample in many respects, namely:
 the Alpgen generator differs from Pythia in the leading order matrix element calculation
of multiple partons (legs) in the final state: 2 2 to 2 5 legs are simulated for Alpgen
compared to 22 only for Pythia
 the matrix element matching to the parton shower is done with the MLM algorithm in
the Alpgen sample,
 the CTEQ6L1 parton distribution function used for Alpgen, compared to the MRST
LO* set used for Pythia,
 the angular-ordered parton shower in Herwig, compared with the pT ordered shower in
Pythia,
 the cluster model for fragmentation implemented in Herwig, compared to the Pythia
string model,
 the underlying event as implemented in Jimmy, compared to the Pythia model.
The Alpgen Monte Carlo uses different models for all phases of the event generation
and therefore gives a reasonable estimate of the systematic variations. However, the possible
compensation of effects that shift the jet response in opposite directions cannot be excluded.
Figure 5.9 shows the calibrated jet kinematic response for the two Monte Carlo generators
and tunes used to estimate the effect of Monte Carlo theoretical model on the jet energy scale
uncertainty, together with the kinematic response for the nominal sample shown for comparison,
for the evaluation of the JES uncertainty for the full 2010 dataset.

5.2.5. Uncertainties due to the relative calibration (endcap/forward
regions)
The JES uncertainty, determined in the central detector region using the single particle response
and systematic variations of the Monte Carlo simulations, is transferred to the forward regions
by exploiting the transverse momentum balance of a central and a forward jet in events with
dijet topologies as detailed in Section 4.2.1. This choice is motivated by the better knowledge of
the material budget for the barrel region with respect to the endcap region.
The jet energy scale uncertainty for jets with || > 0.8 is estimated as follows:
 the total JES uncertainty in the central region 0.3 < || < 0.8 is kept as a baseline. This is
the largest fully instrumented || region considered where the combined test-beam results
used to estimate the calorimeter uncertainty are available for the entire pseudorapidity
range.
 the uncertainty from the relative intercalibration, taken as the RMS deviation of the MC
predictions from the data, is added in quadrature to the baseline uncertainty.
The intercalibration uncertainty is measured in bins of the average pT of the two leading jets,
labelled p
T . Due to momentum balance, this quantity is on average similar to the average
transverse momenta of any of the two jets. The measurements are performed for transverse
momenta in the range 20  pavgT < 110 GeV. The uncertainty for jets with pT > 100 GeV is
taken as the uncertainty of the last available pT-bin. This is justified by the decrease of the
intercalibration uncertainty with pT, but cannot completely exclude the presence of calorimeter
non linearities for jet energies above those used for the intercalibration.
The uncertainties are evaluated separately for jets reconstructed with distance parameters
R=0.4 and R=0.6, and are in general found to be slightly larger for R=0.4.

5.3. Uncertainty due to multiple interactions
Particles produced by multiple soft proton-proton interactions in the same bunch crossing
additional to the event of interest (in-time pile-up) can produce additional energy deposits that
are reconstructed within the jet. As briefly described in Section 3.2.1, and fully detailed in
Ref. [56], an average offset correction is applied to account for the average increase of the jet
energy due to pile-up. This correction is parameterised as a function of the number of measured
primary vertices NPV.
The estimate of the remaining uncertainty on the jet energy scale after applying the pile-up
correction is based on the studies described in Section 5 of Ref. [56]. The contributions to the
uncertainty are estimated from studies that account for:
 the variation of the average offset-corrected calorimeter jet energy for calorimeter jets
matched to track-jets as a function of the number of primary vertices,
 the effects of the variation of the trigger selection on the measured tower energy distribution
that is input to the offset correction,
 the mapping of the tower-based offset correction to jets built from topoclusters using the
average number of towers,
 the non-closure of the tower-based offset correction as evaluated by the dependence of the
corrected calorimeter jet energy for calorimeter jets matched to track-jets.
The uncertainty on the jet energy scale is conservatively estimated by adding all uncertainties
above in quadrature. Since the track-jet method can be used only up to || < 1.9 due to the
limited coverage of the tracking detector, the di-jet balance method detailed in Section 4.2.1 has
been used to estimate the uncertainty for || > 1.9. In this case, the relative jet response in
events with only one reconstructed vertex was compared with the response measured in events
with several reconstructed vertices. The dijet balance method yields uncertainties similar to
those detailed above also in the case of || > 1.9.
The offset correction and its uncertainty are derived as a function of the number of reconstructed
vertices. This allows the correction and its uncertainty to be valid also for data periods where
the number of reconstructed primary vertices is higher than the period where the correction is
derived.
Figure 5.11 shows the relative uncertainty due to pile-up in the case of two measured primary
vertices for jets with anti-kt R=0.6. In this case, the uncertainty due to pile-up for central jets

with pT=20 GeV and pseudorapidity ||  0.8 is about 1%, while it amounts to about 2%
for jets with pseudorapidity 2.1 < || < 2.8 and to less than 2.5% for all jets with ||  4.5.
In the case of more primary vertices, the pile-up uncertainty is summarised in Table 5.2 for
jets of pT =20 and 200 GeV for the three example  regions (0.3  || <0.8, 2.1  || <2.8
and 3.6  || <4.5). Jets with anti-kt R=0.4 show a similar trend, albeit with slightly smaller
uncertainties due to the reduced jet area.
The pile-up uncertainty needs to be added separately to the estimate of the total jet energy
scale uncertainty detailed in Section 5.4.
The effect of additional proton-proton interactions from different bunch crossings that can be
caused by trains of consecutive bunches (out-of-time pile-up) has been studied separately. The
effect of out-of-time pile-up on jet reconstruction has been studied matching calorimeter jets
and track jets (unaffected by the integration time of the calorimeters) and has been found to be
negligible in the 2010 dataset considered for the measurement in this thesis.
5.4. Combination of JES uncertainty sources
The total jet energy scale uncertainty has been derived by considering all the individual
contributions described in Section 5.2. In the central region (|| < 0.8), the estimate proceeds
as follows:
1. For each p
T and  bin, the uncertainty due to the calibration procedure is calculated as
described in Section 5.2.1 for both jet energy and pT response. For each bin, the maximum
deviation from unity between the energy and pT response is taken as the final non-closure
uncertainty.
2. The calorimeter response uncertainty is estimated as a function of jet  and pT from the
propagation of single particle uncertainties to the jets, as detailed in Section 5.2.2.
3. Sources of uncertainties estimated using Monte Carlo samples with a systematic variation
are accounted as follows:
a) the response in the test sample Rvar and the response in the nominal sample Rnom is
considered as a starting point for the estimate of the JES uncertainty. The deviation
of this ratio from unity is defined as:
JES(p
T , ) = |1
Rvar(p
T , )
Rnom(p
T , )
|. (5.1)
This deviation is calculated from both the energy and pT response, leading to
EJES(p
T , ) for the deviation in the energy response, and to 
JES(p
T , ) for the
deviation in the transverse momentum response.
b) The largest JES in each bin derived from the jet energy (E) or transverse momentum
(pT ) response is considered as the contribution to the final JES systematic uncertainty
due to the specific systematic effect:

JES(p

above. These uncertainties are then scaled by the average fraction of particles forming
the jet that are within p < 20 GeV (for the inner detector distorted geometry) and by
the average fraction of particles outside the E/p in-situ measurements (for the overall
distorted geometry), as mentioned in Section 5.2.3.
For each p
T ,  bin, the contributions from the calibration non-closure, calorimeter response,
Monte Carlo variations and additional inactive material listed above are added in quadrature.
For pseudorapidities beyond || > 0.8, the  intercalibration contribution is estimated for
each pseudorapidity bin in the endcap region as detailed in Section 5.2.5. The intercalibration
contribution is added in quadrature to the total JES uncertainty determined in the 0.3  || < 0.8
region to estimate the JES uncertainty for jets with || > 0.8, with the exception of the non-
closure term that is retained for the specific  region. For low jet pT , this choice leads to partially
double count the contribution from the dead material uncertainty, but it is considered as a
conservative estimate in a region where it is difficult to estimate the accuracy of the material
description.
The contribution to the uncertainty due to additional proton-proton interactions described in
Section 5.3 needs to be added separately, depending on the number of primary vertices in the
event. In the following, only the uncertainty in the case of a single proton-proton interaction is
shown in detail.
5.5. Results
Figures 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14 show the final fractional jet energy scale systematic uncertainty and
its individual contributions as a function of jet p
T for three selected  regions. Plots for all
pseudorapidity bins and both jet distance parameters can be found in Appendix C.
The fractional JES uncertainty in the central region amounts to 2 to 4% for p
T < 60 GeV,
and it is between 2 and 2.5% for 60 GeV  pjetT < 800 GeV. For jets with p
T > 800 GeV, the
uncertainty ranges from 2.5 to 4%, due to the larger uncertainties for particles with momentum
beyond 400 GeV comprised in these jets. The uncertainty amounts to up to 7% and 3%,
respectively, for p
T < 60 GeV and p
T > 60 GeV in the endcap region, where the central
uncertainty is taken as a baseline and the uncertainty due to the relative calibration is added.
In the forward region, a 13% uncertainty is present for p
T < 60 GeV: the increase in the

uncertainty is dominated by the modelling of the soft physics in the forward region that is
accounted for in the intercalibration contribution.
The dominant contribution to the uncertainty for jets with the highest transverse momenta
measurable in ATLAS is the calorimeter uncertainty, and more specifically the uncertainty due
to particles in jets with p >400 GeV. As stated in Section 5.2.2 and in [127], this uncertainty
contribution is estimated conservatively.
Table 5.3 presents a summary of the maximum uncertainties in the different  regions for
anti-kt jets with distance parameter of R=0.6 and with p
T of 20 GeV, 200 GeV and 1.5 TeV
as an example.
The same study has been repeated for anti-kt jets with distance parameter R=0.4, and the
estimate of the JES uncertainty is comparable to anti-kt jets with R=0.6. The JES uncertainty
for anti-kt jets with R=0.4 is between  4% (8%, 14%) at low jet p
T and  2.5-3% (2.5-3.5%,
5%) for jets with pT > 60 GeV in the central (endcap, forward) region, and it is summarised in
Table 5.4.
5.5.1. Validation of the JES uncertainty with in-situ techniques
A JES uncertainty that relies on Monte Carlo simulation for a certain number of terms benefits
from validation of the jet energy scale with in-situ techniques that can exploit the full 2010
dataset. These techniques have been detailed in Section 4.2 and Appendix A. The comparison
of data to Monte Carlo simulation for all in-situ techniques is shown in Figure 5.15, together
with the JES uncertainty for the 0  || < 1.2 region as estimated from the single hadrons
response and systematic variations of the Monte Carlo simulations. For the track-jet results the
 range used for the comparison in the figure is restricted to 0  || < 0.3. The results of the
in-situ techniques provide independent support to the estimate of the JES uncertainty adopted
by ATLAS.

energy scale exploiting photon jet balance (direct balance or using the missing transverse
momentum projection technique), the balance of a leading jet with a recoil system of
two or more jets at lower transverse momentum (multi-jets) or using the momentum
measurement of tracks in jets.
5.6. Flavour and topology considerations
The jet energy scale and its uncertainty have been derived using the nominal simulated sample
of QCD jets. The calibration of the jet energy scale is constructed such that it restores the
average jet response to unity for jets with the particular quark and gluon mixture and topologies
predicted by the Monte Carlo simulation in di-jet QCD events. Therefore, differences in
fragmentation between quark and gluon initiated jets and effect of close-by jets give rise to a
particular topology and flavour dependence of the energy scale. Since the event topology and
flavour composition (quark and gluon fractions) may be different in final states other than the
QCD jets considered, the dependence of the jet energy response on jet flavour and topology has
to be accounted for in physics analyses.
The effect of close-by jets on the jet energy response for a Monte Carlo sample with
characteristics similar to the nominal sample of Section 1.4.2, but with an older ATLAS tune
called MC09 [132], is shown in Figure 5.16 for anti-kt jets with distance parameter R
jet algo =
0.6. The response of non-isolated jets (R(jet, closest jet) > 1.5) is lower than the response
of isolated jets, and strongly depends on the distance to the closest reconstructed jet. When
R(jet, closest jet) < 1.0, the calibrated jet energy response is underestimated by 5% to 10%.
This same effect is observed in all  regions. Isolated jets with R(jet, closest jet) < 1.5 have, by
construction, a uniform response consistent with one: only isolated jets with R < 2.5 Rjet algo
were used to derive the JES.

jet in the event for jets in the central barrel (solid circles) region and all jets (open
circles), from Monte Carlo simulation of the nominal sample.
The effect on the jet energy scale uncertainty due to close-by jets needs to be estimated
separately, since the jet response depends on the angular distance to the closest jet. The
response of jets as a function of the distance to the closest reconstructed jet needs to be studied
and corrected for separately if the measurement relies on the absolute jet energy scale. The
additional uncertainty can be estimated from the Monte Carlo to data comparison of the pT
ratio between calorimeter jets and matched track jets in inclusive dijet events as a function of
the isolation radius. The derivation of such uncertainty is described in Reference [133]: it is
found that simulated events reproduce the response of close-by-jets to within 1-3% as a function
of the distance to the nearest jet.
Figure 5.17 shows the dependence of the jet energy response on the jet flavour in the nominal
QCD jet sample. Gluon initiated jets have a lower response than quark jets because gluon jets
fragment into more and softer particles than quark jets. Softer particles have a lower energy
response and are more likely to fail to reach the calorimeters or be included in topological
clusters.
The pT dependence of the jet response for quark and gluon jets reflects the flavour composition
of the QCD dijet sample used to derived the JES. At low pT , QCD di-jet production is dominated
by gluon initiated jets. Hence, the response of gluon jets is consistent with unity. As the jet
pT increases, there is a higher fraction of quark initiated jets in the QCD sample, resulting in
relatively lower response for gluon jets. The maximum difference between the response of quark
and gluon jets is about 6% at low p
T and less than 3% for p
T > 100GeV.
As in the case of the topology dependence of the jet energy scale, specific flavour dependent
corrections should be derived separately by different physics analysis. The JES systematic
uncertainty for each analysis depends on the difference in the fraction of quark and gluon jets
and on the flavour dependence of the jet energy response between data and simulation. This
uncertainty has to be evaluated for each individual physics analysis, as detailed in Reference [134].
5.7. JES uncertainty correlations
The treatment of correlated systematic uncertainties is of particular relevance for the comparison
of experimental measurements with theory using statistical techniques. The JES uncertainty is
composed of a number of uncorrelated sources, but no information has yet been given on the
bin-to-bin correlations. This section focuses on the evaluation of the bin-to-bin correlations
across pT bins.
In the approach taken for the inclusive jet cross section measurement described in this thesis,
the full JES uncertainty covariance matrix is reproduced by treating each source as a nuisance
parameter fully correlated across pT . Each element of the covariance matrix cij is given by:

where i, j are the indices of the pT bins considered, s is the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties
that are considered uncorrelated and  are the individual sources of systematic uncertainties.
In order to adopt this treatment, the decomposition of the uncertainty sources needs to be
revisited so that each uncertainty component can be treated as fully correlated in pT . This
assumption is made in the case of the uncertainties due to theoretical modeling, additional
dead material 6, noise thresholds, pile-up, non-closure of the calibration and relative calibration.
On the other hand, the calorimeter component presents non trivial decorrelations between
the pT bins, as derived from the analysis and shown in Figure 5.4. The decomposition of this
uncertainty source into fully correlated components is described in the following section.
5.7.1. Calorimeter uncertainty
The technique adopted to reproduce the covariance matrix of the calorimeter uncertainty
component using fully correlated subcomponents requires a revision of the seven uncertainty
subcomponents listed in Section 5.2.2, as described below.
6Preliminary studies have been performed to estimate the bin-to-bin correlations for the dead material
component using separate subsamples. These are not reported here, but they can be found in the presentation
given in [135].
Treatment of bias components
As described in Section 5.2.2, the full envelope of the bias and the deviation from unity is taken
as the calorimeter uncertainty: the same technique is used when considering each separate
source. The E/p and Combined Test Beam uncertainty sources have a significant bias term
that dominates at high transverse momenta and needs to be treated separately from the term
derived from the statistical and systematic error on the average JES (called error term in the
following). Two separate subcomponents for the bias and error terms are constructed for each
of these two sources using the total magnitude of the uncertainty tot and the size of the error
term err:
bias =
2tot  2err
so that they can be summed in quadrature and treated as fully correlated across pT .
Further decomposition of calorimeter subcomponents
While the uncertainties from the E/p acceptance, Neutral particles, cluster thresh-
olds, E/p, High momentum particles sources can be treated as fully correlated, the Global
energy scale and Combined Test Beam components have internal decorrelations. Their
covariance matrix can be used to split them further in subcomponents using an iterative method
that at each step subtracts a fully correlated part to the total uncertainty. By construction,
the sum in quadrature of the subcomponent results in the total uncertainty for the original
component. This is done as follows:
1. The first subcomponent for bin i is derived using the elements of the covariance matrix
clm, with l,m bin indices. One bin (denoted with index k) is taken as reference
7. The
values of the new uncertainty component is derived using the covariance with respect to
the reference bin as 
i = cik/
7The reference bin is chosen where the uncertainty is largest to keep the correlations as faithful as possible in
the neighboring bins.
2. The modified covariance matrix with elements c
ij where the n 1-th subcomponent has
been subtracted is used to generate the other subcomponents:
ij = c
(n1)
ij  
(n1)
(n1)
i = c
ik /
3. The two steps above are iterated until significant decorrelations are seen in the modified
covariance matrix, and finally the last uncertainty component is built:
cii 
This procedure leads to splitting the global energy scale component in two subcomponents.
For convenience, these will be called in the following LAr E-scale and Tile E-scale, even
though they are a mixture of uncertainties due to both the LAr and the Tile energy scales.
The Combined Test Beam component is split into three subcomponents: CTB low pT, CTB
medium pT and CTB high pT . Again, the names only indicate the pT range where the
subcomponent is sizeable with respect to the others.
The correlation matrix for these two sources can be built using the new subcomponents and
compared with that obtained from pseudoexperiments: the correlations are preserved within a
few percent, and they are well reproduced at high pT where the two components are relevant in
the total calorimeter uncertainty.
Final calorimeter subcomponents
As a result of this analysis, the calorimeter component is split into 12 subcomponents: 5 fully
correlated original components, 2 bias terms and 5 generated terms. The E/p acceptance
and cluster thresholds components have a similar shape and they are merged in a single
component. The same is done with the LAr E-scale, CTB low pT and neutral particles
components and with the CTB high pT and high momentum particle components. A total
of 7 uncertainty components are kept to be used as separate nuisance parameters for physics
analyses: E/p, Cluster thresholds and E/p acceptance (called only Cluster thresholds in the
following), LAr E-scale/neutrals and CTB low pT (called only LAr E-scale in the following),
Tile E-scale and CTB mid pT (called only Tile E-scale in the following), CTB High pT and
high momentum particles (called only CTB High pT in the following), E/p bias, CTB bias.
The correlation matrix obtained using these components is compared to those obtained in the
full single particle analysis of Reference [127], and found in agreement up to 2% for pT >20
GeV, and 4% for the first bin.

Inclusive Jet Cross Section
QCD jets are the most common hard objects observed at hadron colliders, with their cross
section exceeding any other physics process by orders of magnitude.
The measurement of the inclusive jet cross section with the ATLAS detector has been one of
the first measurements performed with the initial 7 TeV data delivered by the Large Hadron
Collider. Its first iteration used 17 nb1 of data collected between March 2010 and June 2010
including jets with transverse momentum from 60 GeV to around 600 GeV in a rapidity range of
y <2.8, and it has been published in EPJC [52]. The comparison of the measurement data with
the theoretical prediction served the purpose of both verifying Quantum Chromodynamics in an
unexplored kinematic region and confirming the status of the performance of jets as estimated
over the course of the experiment commissioning and with the data from the LHC startup.
The inclusive jet cross section measurement has been updated using the full 2010 dataset
(37.3 1.2 pb1) and it is the focus of this chapter. This analysis takes advantage of the reduced
jet energy scale uncertainty and the estimate of its correlations described in Chapter 5: its
systematic uncertainties are considerably reduced compared to the first iteration. The kinematic
range for the measurement has been extended to include jets from transverse momentum as low
as 20 GeV and up to 1.5 TeV, and measuring the jet cross section in the forward calorimeter
region (y <4.4). The comparison of the kinematic reach of the measurement for the full 2010
dataset compared to that of the previous measurement is shown in Figure 6.1.
This extension makes the measurement truly unique with respect to previous analyses [29,30]
since it probes QCD at distances never reached before. The extension to the forward region
provides insight in the small-x QCD dynamics, while high pT jets allow constraints of the gluon
density at high x. Low transverse momentum jets measured with two different jet distance
parameters can be used to probe non perturbative effects such as hadronisation and underlying
event.

This chapter describes the details of the inclusive jet cross section analysis. The overview of
the analysis and the datasets used are described in Section 6.1. The selection of interesting
events and of the jets included in the measurement can be found in Section 6.2. The procedure
needed to unfold the experimental effects from the measurement in order to compare to theory
is outlined in Section 6.3, and the systematic uncertainties and their correlations are evaluated
in Section 6.4. Section 6.5 briefly describes the theoretical prediction of the inclusive jet cross
section. The comparison of data and theory and a brief discussion of the results are given in
Section 6.6.
6.1. Analysis overview and datasets used
Jets are reconstructed with two different jet distance parameters (R=0.4 and R=0.6) and
calibrated with the EM+JES scheme described in Chapter 3. The measurement uses jets with
a transverse momentum of 20 <p
T < 1500 GeV and rapidities of y <4.4. The measurement is
performed in bins of p
T and |y|. The rapidity bins follow closely those used for the jet energy
scale uncertainty, given that the these bins reflect the geometry of the ATLAS calorimeters.
The differences with respect to Table 5.1 are that:
 pseudorapidity is replaced with rapidity;
 the transition region is extended to include the first forward bin, leading to a transition
region bin of 2.8< |y| <3.6 to increase the statistics in a kinematic region where the
spectrum falls steeply;
 the forwardmost bin is limited to |y| <4.4 instead of 4.5.
The jet cross section jet is defined as the number of jets Njets falling in a given pT , y bin
after trigger and quality selection, fully corrected for experimental inefficiencies  (as detailed in
the following sections), and finally divided by the integrated luminosity Lint delivered by the
Large Hadron Collider that takes into consideration any prescaling in the triggers used. The
basic formula for the cross section measurement is shown in Equation 6.1.
jet =
Njets
 Lint
(6.1)
All experimental effects (for example the smearing due to resolution) are corrected for using
using a procedure (unfolding) that employs the Monte Carlo truth jets that are described in
Section 3.1.3, but this time including muons and neutrinos from hadronic decays as specified in
Reference [101].
The unfolded measurement is compared to Next to Leading Order (NLO) pQCD predictions
corrected for non-perturbative effects and to NLO calculation that includes the simulation of
the parton shower.
The measurement uses the full 2010 dataset with two exceptions:
 Since the forward jet triggers were not commissioned until August 10, 2010, only the latter
data periods were used in the forward region (|y| >2.8) and for pjetT >30 GeV;
 To minimize the effect of additional energy in jets due to in-time pile-up, only the first
data periods (up to the beginning of June 2011) are used for jets with 20 < p
T < 60 GeV;
The total integrated luminosity used for this measurement is (37.3  1.2) pb1.
6.2. Event and jet selection
The Data Quality framework [137,138] ensures that quality criteria for the subdetectors and
the physics objects used in ATLAS analyses are met. Unrecoverable problems that affect the
relevant detector components for a significant period of time and that can be observed at the
luminosity block (defined in Section 2.8) level lead to the exclusion of the full range of events
within the luminosity block from the analysis. Less frequent problems (such as sporadically
noisy channels in the calorimeters) are instead dealt with at the analysis level, as detailed in
Section 6.2.2. The quality selection performed at the event level for this measurement is detailed
in Reference [139] and outlined below.
Events that are included in the analysis are required to belong to runs taken over periods of
stable LHC beams. To ensure that the physics objects needed for the analysis are correctly
measured, a further selection on the good functioning of the relevant detector components and
reconstruction procedures is applied.
The subsystems that are required to measure the jets and the primary vertex used in the
calibration procedure are the processors for the first level (L1) and second level (L2) triggers,
the solenoid magnet, all components of the inner detector, and the LAr and Tile calorimeters.
The reconstruction of physics objects needed in the analysis is also monitored: tracks (for the
reconstruction of the primary vertex of the collision), jets and missing energy (to monitor the
overall energy reconstruction) are required to be well reconstructed. A given luminosity block is
excluded from the analysis if the distributions of significant quantities for the object in question
are in disagreement with the expected reference distribution coming from a known good data
taking period.
In addition to these requirements, cosmic muons and beam background (non-collision events)
need to be rejected. To ensure that the event is a collision candidate, events are required to
have at least one primary vertex (formed by at least five tracks) whose position is consistent
with the beamspot.
6.2.1. Triggers
Three different trigger systems (described in more detail in Section 2.9) have been used to select
the events used in the inclusive jet cross section analysis.
For the first data period (up to the 10th of April 2011), only the Minimum Bias Trigger
Scintillators were used. This trigger is fully efficient for low pT jets in the whole calorimeter
coverage, thanks to the particles radiated by the jets or by the proton remnants in the forward
direction that cross either of the scintillator counters, as described in [140]. The MBTS trigger
is also used to trigger low pT jets in the transition and forward calorimeter region. The central
and forward jet trigger systems were also used: the Level 1 trigger was commissioned first, and
subsequently (starting from August 2010) the Level 2 trigger was also used to reject events.
The Level 1 jet trigger decision is based on whether the electromagnetic scale energy of any
jet in the event is above a certain threshold. These thresholds are used because of the steep jet
cross section: since the trigger system has a limited bandwidth as described in Section 2.9, the
rate of events with low pT jets needs to be prescaled to ensure the less frequent high pT jets
are recorded as well. 8 thresholds are available for the central jet trigger (5, 10, 15, 30, 55, 75,
95 and 115 GeV) and 4 thresholds for the forward jet trigger (10, 30, 55 and 75 GeV). Level
2 triggers need to be seeded by a Level 1 trigger, which means that the event needs to have
successfully passed the corresponding Level 1 trigger selection. Level 2 jet triggers also accept
events based on EM-scale thresholds, which are 15 GeV higher than their corresponding L1
threshold with the exception of the L1 central jet trigger with a 5 GeV threshold that seeds a
L2 trigger with a threshold of 10 GeV. A higher threshold at L2 with respect to L1 is used
because the L1 trigger is slower at becoming fully efficient in the jet selection with respect to
the L2 trigger, and this choice allows both trigger levels to become fully efficient at the same jet
pT value.
The available bandwidth of about 200 Hz needs to be distributed among the various physics
streams, so the jet triggers have been increasingly prescaled: only a fraction of the events
that would be selected are saved, based on a probabilistic, unbiased selection. The prescale is
accounted for when calculating the equivalent luminosity from a given trigger, by weighting the
event by the inverse of the prescale factor.
The trigger strategy for the inclusive jet measurement is to accept any jets in events where
at least one jet passed a trigger. The definition of trigger efficiency follows this choice: it is
calculated as the ratio between all jets in an event where at least one of the jets fired the trigger
and all jets in all events considered, where the latter jets are counted using a trigger chain with
a lower threshold. This definition requires no matching between jets triggered online and jets
recorded offline, since there might be no connection between the jet that caused the event to be
selected and the jet that enters the measurement. The efficiency of a L2 trigger needs to be
combined with the efficiency of the seeding L1 trigger. A trigger is considered fully efficient at
the calibrated pT where its efficiency reaches the 99% plateau. A sample of trigger efficiency
curves are shown in Figure 6.2 for the central region and for the forward region1.
An association between trigger passed and calibrated jet momentum is made in order to
minimize statistical uncertainties due to trigger efficiency: each p
T bin only contains jets coming
1Due to a known problem that caused a trigger tower to be unusable in the FCal, the efficiency of some chains
does not reach 100% efficiency. Since the effect of the dead trigger tower on the trigger efficiency is below 1%
because jets in that region can still be recorded thanks to other jets triggering the event, no offline cuts are
applied, and this effect is considered as a systematic uncertainty.

from events selected by a trigger that is fully efficient at that value of calibrated pT . When
multiple triggers satisfy this criterion, the trigger with the lowest pT threshold is selected, in
order to maximise the available statistics. For the endcap/forward transition region, the OR of
a central and forward trigger is taken to obtain a fully efficient trigger combination. A full list
of the bin-trigger association is shown in Reference [141].
To account for the equivalent luminosity and avoid double counting in the case when a jet
is in an event that has been triggered by both the central and the forward jet trigger, jets
are divided in three categories: triggered by a central jet trigger only, triggered by a forward
jet trigger only, and triggered by a central and a forward jet trigger. The final luminosity is
calculated taking into account the integrated luminosity recorded for the trigger and the prescale
of each trigger for the three categories, according to the prescription in Reference [142].
Impact of events in the trigger debug stream
Any events for which the trigger is unable to make a decision because either the processing
time was too long (trigger time-out) or they caused a failure in the online software are redirected
to a special stream called debug stream. In the case of the inclusive jet measurement these events
are particularly relevant since they could be high-pT jets in poorly instrumented calorimeter
regions (e.g. barrel/endcap crack): even if their number is negligible (less than 1 per mille)
they could cause a bias in the final jet spectrum. These jets are not fully contained within
the calorimeters and punch-through to the muon system, causing the muon reconstruction
(present in the L2 trigger) to reach the maximum allowed processing time. A separate study of
punch-through events has been performed and it is detailed in Reference [143], showing that
these occurrences are present and reasonably well modeled in Monte Carlo. Nevertheless, in
order not to bias the measured jet spectrum (debug stream events usually contain jets that
would populate the high pT tails of the spectrum), these jets have been included in the standard
analysis and passed through the standard jet identification cuts mentioned below. A subset of
these events were further checked using the ATLANTIS event display [144] and they were all
found to contain real jets. 530 jets over 2.1 million jets
6.2.2. Jet identification
After jets have passed the trigger, fake jets are rejected from the sample used in the measurement
using a series of jet-by-jet cleaning cuts. Fake jets include energy deposits coming from groups
of noisy cells in the calorimeters and cosmic muons traversing the calorimeters in the same time
window allowed for a collision event.
The basic cleaning cuts performed in analyses using jets are detailed in [139]. Specific studies
have been performed for the inclusive jet measurement, also given that the reprocessing of the
data used for the measurement allowed use of discriminating variables that were not available at
the time of the first studies. Only the discriminating variables used in jet cleaning are mentioned
in this section, while the specific cuts can be found in the full analysis documentation [141].
Cleaning cuts are targeting three main category of fake jets, and the discriminating variables to
remove each category are listed in the following.
Jets from noise bursts occurring in the HEC :
 the fraction of energy deposited in the HEC (HECf ),
 the HEC quality variable, defined as the fraction of cells in the HEC that present a
pulse shape with large discrepancies with respect to a healthy reference shape,
 the sum of all negative cell energies (in absolute value): cells with negative total
energy are more likely to be coming from noise fluctuations, since the reconstruction
of the pulse shape will not have recognized its shape correctly.
Jets from coherent noise in the LAr calorimeter :
 the fraction of energy deposited in the LAr (EMf ),
 the LAr quality variable, defined in the same fashion as the HEC quality variable.
Jets from non-collision background, e.g. beam background or cosmic rays :
 the fraction of energy deposited in the LAr (EMf ),
 the sum of the pT associated to charged tracks divided by the total jet pT (chf ),
 the difference in the timing of the jet (obtained as the average time of all cells weighted
by the cell energy) with respect to the global event timing,
 the maximum fraction of energy deposited in any of the layers of the calorimeters.
Cleaning cuts were optimised using jets with a distance parameter of R=0.6, and the choices
were tested with R=0.4 with no significant differences in the results. The optimisation of the
cleaning cuts was performed on samples of real and fake jets, and by looking at the missing
energy distributions before and after applying the cleaning cuts. Fake jets are not likely to
have a counterpart that balances them in tranverse momentum, and therefore produce tails in
the missing energy distributions. An example of the effect of the cleaning cuts on the missing
transverse energy distribution in the case of the cuts mentioned in Reference [139] is shown in

The efficiency of the set of cleaning cuts is estimated using a tag and probe approach. Tag jets
(considered to a good approximation to correspond to a sample of real jets) are selected with a
series of cuts that are tighter with respect to the standard cleaning selection. The analysis looks
for well balanced probe jets corresponding to tag jets before and after applying the cleaning
selection, and measures the probability of the cleaning cuts to reject a real jet. The systematic
uncertainty is derived applying a looser or harder tag selection.
Inefficiencies of >1% (that can happen in the lowest pT bins since cleaning cuts are harder
for low pT jets) are corrected for at the analysis level after unfolding
2. An additional cross check
of the cleaning efficiency was given by checking the fraction of jets rejected in Monte Carlo,
where the problems that cause fake jets as are not present.
6.2.3. Stability cross checks and effect of pile-up
The conditions of the LHC varied considerably over the course of the 2010 data taking: both
the instantaneous luminosity and the number of bunches per fill were increased. The jet yield
after the cleaning and trigger selection was checked over all the runs used for the measurement.
This study showed that the jet yield is generally stable within uncertainties across the data
taking period, with the exception of a few isolated runs. It was also noticed that in the lowest
T bin (20-30 GeV) the jet yield increased starting from the end of June 2011. Starting from
this period, the number of protons for each bunch was increased to the nominal LHC value
of 0.9  1011 and the luminous region  decreased to 3.5 m: this lead to an average of 1.3
interactions per event compared to a value of <0.15 before these changes. In order to avoid an
increased impact of pile-up in the measurement, it was decided to only use the first collision
data (March/April 2010 to the 24th of June 2010) for the first three bin of the measurement, up
to 60 GeV. This decision is also supported by the large amount of statistics for low pT jets
collected in this data period.
6.3. Data corrections for detector effects (unfolding)
A number of detector-related factors can distort the distribution of observables that are measured
experimentally with respect to an ideal detector and infinite event statistics within the phase
space of the measurement. Among these factors are the resolution of the detector, detector
inefficiencies and the limited acceptance of the subdetectors used for the measurement. A
meaningful comparison to theory, e.g. pQCD-corrected NLO calculations where no detector
effects are present, is possible after a correction accounting for these effects has been applied.
The procedure where these corrections are derived and applied is called unfolding. Unfolded
2As explained in Section 6.3.1, the unfolding procedure is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, where the
number of fake jets is negligible.
distributions are detector-independent, and can be used for theoretical comparisons, comparisons
to results of other experiments and PDF fits.
A review of unfolding methods can be found in [145] and [146] in the specific case of the
ATLAS experiment as of Winter 2010. In the following a summary of the unfolding methods
employed for the inclusive jet measurement is given. The issues that could arise from background
subtraction are not mentioned since the measurement has effectively a negligible background
that is removed with the jet cleaning procedures detailed in Section 6.2.2.
The problem of unfolding an experimental measurement can be seen as trying to retrieve the
probability distribution function of a given observable y, given a series of measurements y1...yN
in N bins. The goal of the unfolding procedure is to construct estimators for the number of
entries in each bin, free from any detector effects (called i in the following, i if referring to
the estimator). The number of events smeared by detector effects is indicated with i, and the
connection between the smeared and unsmeared number of events is a response matrix that
reflects the bin migrations:
Rijj.
The response matrix can then be inverted to revert to the number of events before any
detector smearing. In practice, one only has the number of events measured in each bin ni, that
can be taken as estimators for . Therefore, an unbiased estimator for i can be constructed
using ni
3. The estimator for the number of entries in a given bin i can be obtained as:
 = R1n.
Since only limited statistics is available in experimental measurements, this direct matrix
inversion procedure is unfeasible. The reason is that R does not differentiate between real
structures and statistical fluctuations, and it can lead to large fluctuations and large negative
correlations in the values of j that are not physical.
A simple method to prevent these large variances is the so-called bin by bin unfolding, where
the ratio of the number truth Monte Carlo objects Ntruth to the reconstructed Monte Carlo
objects Nreco is used to obtain i in each bin:
3This if the ni are independent and follow Poisson statistics with mean i.
N itruth
N ireco
The inclusive jet cross section measurement with 17 nb1 and the first iteration of the analysis
on the full 2010 dataset employ this unfolding method, using as unfolding correction coefficients
the ratio between the number of truth (particle-level) jets derived from the Pythia nominal
Monte Carlo sample described in Section 1.4.2 and the number of reconstructed jets.
The bin by bin unfolding method is the most widely used in ATLAS for its simplicity, but it
biases the final measurement towards the Monte Carlo prediction. If the truth level spectrum is
different from the real truth spectrum (in nature), then the measurement will not necessarily
reflect the true nature of QCD but will instead be biased towards the modelling of QCD that is
embedded in the Monte Carlo generation.
Another unfolding technique that reduces the large variances induced by the use of estimators
based on the inversion of the response matrix is the regularized unfolding. In this technique,
the log-likelihood that represents the distance between the measured and true values of the
observable (in terms of ) is constrained to be within a certain value from its maximum:
lnL()  lnL(max) lnL(),
which is equivalent to redefining the log-likelihood using a regularisation function f multiplied
by a parameter :
lnL() = lnL() + f(). (6.2)
The regularisation function f and the value of the parameter  need to be determined, and
the choices used in the inclusive jet cross section measurement presented in this thesis follows
those of the Iterative Dynamically Stabilized (IDS) unfolding method [147,148], described in
the next section. The use of an unfolding method based on the inversion of the Monte Carlo
transfer matrix is justified by the good modelling of the trigger efficiencies in the simulation and
the good description of the energy and momentum flow around the jet core (jet shapes) for the
full coverage of the calorimeters used in the measurement, as shown in References [52,131].
6.3.1. Iterative Dynamically Stabilized (IDS) unfolding
The IDS method [147,148] is an unfolding technique that takes advantage of a series of iterations
to improve the description of the Monte Carlo simulation according to data. In each step the
method uses the information on the size of the experimental errors in the data to stabilize
the inversion of the transfer matrix. This technique allows the Monte Carlo normalisation to
be improved so that the final result is not biased, and keeps information on new structures
that might not be simulated in the Monte Carlo without at the same time being affected by
fluctuations. Its result is consistent with that derived using the bin-by-bin unfolding mentioned
above, and has been cross checked using the SVD unfolding technique [141].
Regularisation function and parameter
The regularisation function used in the IDS unfolding technique uses the significance of the
absolute deviation between data and the Monte Carlo to prevent spurious fluctuations (e.g.
due to statistics) in the unfolded spectrum when iterating. This quantity is defined as x/,
where x is the deviation between data and Monte Carlo and  is the statistical error on
the data point. The regularisation function is smooth and monotonic, and its value goes from
zero to unity when the data/Monte Carlo difference is larger than the statistical error. The
parameter  is included in the regularisation function, and chosen depending on the unfolding
step: whenever the Monte Carlo shape needs to be taken as a reference, e.g. when computing
the data/Monte Carlo normalisation factor,  is set to zero, while it takes larger values when
the Monte Carlo needs to be improved taking into account the shape of the data.
Unfolding procedure for the inclusive jet cross section
The main ingredient for the unfolding procedure is the transfer matrix Aij, which is derived
from Monte Carlo and contains the number of jets that have been reconstructed in bin i with a
matched truth jet that was generated in bin j. A reconstructed and true jet are considered
matched if their centers lie within R <0.3 of each other, and the matching is unique. The
transfer matrix does not include unmatched jets, so an equivalent fraction of jets in data needs
to be removed from the unfolding procedure: a multiplicative inefficiency equal to the fraction of
unmatched jets is applied to data before the start of the unfolding procedure, and the equivalent
number of jets is restored after the unfolding.
To improve the initial data/Monte Carlo agreement, the Monte Carlo spectrum is reweighted
according to the distribution of the spectrum generated using a NLO PDF instead of the current
LO*. This step improves the stability of the method, given that the regularisation function in
the IDS unfolding accounts for the significance of the data/MC difference.
The matrix of unfolding probabilities is calculated from the transfer matrix in Monte Carlo as:
Pij =
NBins
The data/Monte Carlo normalisation coefficient is also calculated counting the number of
events in data. The use of the regularisation function for this step avoids inclusion of any new
structures that are not simulated in the Monte Carlo (which are anyway not present in the
inclusive jet cross section data spectrum) to calculate the normalisation.
In the case of negligible background as in the inclusive jet cross section measurement, the
number of unfolded events for each bin is calculated from the sum of three contributions:
1. the normalized number of jets in the bin from the true spectrum,
2. the fractions of events that migrate from other bins according to their unfolding probabilities,
3. the fraction of events that remain in that same bin (these events are not unfolded).
The size of the last two contributions is controlled by the regularisation function and by the 
parameter: the choice of function and the value of the parameter are determined using pseudo
experiment (toy) studies. The optimisation is performed using a closure testof the unfolding
procedure: the parameter  is chosen to be the one that minimizes the bias in a test of the
unfolding where the true Monte Carlo spectrum is reweighted to data and unfolded, and finally
compared to the original true Monte Carlo spectrum.
The unfolding procedure for the inclusive jet measurement is iterated once. The agreement
between the truth distribution in the transfer matrix and the intermediate unfolded spectrum is
improved using a fraction of events dictated by the regularisation function and parameter, and
the final number of unfolded events is derived using the new transfer matrix.
Treatment of statistical uncertainties
The statistical uncertainties are propagated through the unfolding using a series of pseudo
experiments in which the content of the bins of the transfer matrix from the Monte Carlo
simulation are fluctuated according to a Poisson distribution. Correlations due to the production
of jets within the same event are also considered: for example, in a dijet event the transverse
momenta of the two jets entering the measurement are fully correlated, and using only the
Poissonian error would lead to an underestimate of the statistical uncertainty. Each element of
the covariance matrix covi,j for bins i and j of the jet spectrum is calculated from data taking
into account correlations between jets in the same event:
cov(i, j) =
events
(Njetsi Njetsj)
The covariance matrix is calculated for both data and Monte Carlo, and it is used to fluctuate
the number of jets in 100 different pseudo experiments. For each fluctuated data spectrum and
transfer matrix, the unfolding procedure is repeated, and the final statistical errors are derived
from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix derived from all pseudo experiments.
6.4. Systematic uncertainties
This section outlines the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties for the inclusive jet cross
section measurement, source by source. Every single source of uncertainty is considered separately
in order to be input either as a nuisance parameter for PDF fits or as a completely uncorrelated
source, as described in Section 6.4.8.
6.4.1. Jet energy scale uncertainty
The evaluation of the jet energy scale uncertainty and its separate components has been detailed
in Chapter 5. Each of the thirteen uncertainty sources mentioned in Section 5.7 (excluding the
pile-up which is estimated separately) can be applied as a separate shift to the energy scale of
each jet in the Monte Carlo spectrum that is used in the data unfolding. Since the uncertainty
for each of the sources is considered fully correlated in p
T , all jets are shifted upwards and
downwards in two separate steps. Given that the number of uncertainty components is large, a
jet spectrum that is finely binned in jet transverse momentum is used for each rapidity region
instead of shifting each jet in order to reduce the processing time. For each i-th jet energy scale
uncertainty component, the fractional JES uncertainty JES,i for the pT bin centre (p
bin centre
is used to move all jets in a given bin to the bin corresponding to:
jet,up
T = p
bin centre
T + p
bin centre
T  JES,i
in the case of the positive fluctuation, and to:
jet,down
T = p
bin centre
T  p
bin centre
T  JES,i
in the case of the negative fluctuation. The procedure is repeated for all bin centers and the
shifted spectrum is rebinned to the binning used in the measurement. The unfolding procedure
described in Section 6.3.1 is used to propagate the uncertainty to the final measurement: the
upwards/downwards shifted Monte Carlo spectrum are unfolded using the nominal transfer
matrix, and compared to the nominal Monte Carlo spectrum after unfolding. The relative
difference between the two spectra is taken as uncertainty. The relative upwards and downwards
uncertainty at this stage are called 
xsec,up
JES,i and 
xsec,down
JES,i . Since statistical fluctuations in the
unfolding procedure might lead the spectrum to present a downwards fluctuation when shifted
upwards (or vice versa), the final uncertainty is asymmetric and calculated in its upwards 
JES,i
and downwards components downJES,i as:
JES,i = max((max(
xsec,up
JES,i , 
xsec,down
JES,i ),0)
downJES,i = min((min(
xsec,up
JES,i , 
xsec,down
JES,i ),0)
The uncertainty on the measurement due to pile-up is estimated using the average vertex
distribution in data for each p
T bin in the measurement, where vertices are counted using the
standard track selection described in Section 3.2.1. First the fractional uncertainty due to pile-up
shown in Table 5.2 is averaged for a given pT , y bin over all values of NPV. The uncertainty
applied to the measurement is calculated multiplying this average pile-up uncertainty by the
fraction of events with a given number of NPV.
As shown previously in Figure 5.11, this uncertainty is most relevant at low p
T . Given that
the jets in the transverse momentum bins with pT <60 GeV have been chosen to exclusively
come from periods in which the machine was running at a reduced luminosity, the impact of
pile-up on the measurement is reduced, and it amounts to generally less than 1%.
6.4.2. Jet energy resolution uncertainty
The data/Monte Carlo studies detailed in Section 4.1 showed that the jet resolution is well
described in Monte Carlo with respect to data, to within an uncertainty of the order of 5-10%.
Fluctuations of the jet energy due to resolution effects are corrected for in the unfolding
procedure, but a worse resolution with respect to what is modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation
used for the unfolding can still lead to biases in the measurement, especially at low jet pT . Low
pT jets whose energy fluctuates above the nominal value will fall to higher pT bins, and this flux
will not be compensated by jets in higher pT bins because of the steeply falling jet cross section.
In order to evaluate the systematic uncertainty due to a potentially worse resolution with
respect to the Monte Carlo simulation, the nominal energy resolution is worsened to within its
uncertainty. The p
T of each Monte Carlo jet is smeared by the factor smear, calculated as:
2smear  
nominal = (1 + ) nominal
where nominal is the nominal fractional resolution as derived from Monte Carlo studies in
Section 4.3.3, and  the fractional uncertainty on the nominal resolution.
The smeared spectrum is used to derive a smeared transfer matrix with which the data is
unfolded. The relative difference of the data spectrum unfolded with the smeared transfer matrix
and the data spectrum unfolded with the nominal transfer matrix is taken as a symmetric
systematic uncertainty. The maximum uncertainty on the inclusive jet measurement due to
resolution effects amounts to up to 10% in the forwardmost, low pT bins.
6.4.3. Jet identification and trigger
The jet identification efficiency after jet cleaning is obtained with the tag and probe method
described in Section 6.2.2, and the systematic uncertainty on the method is estimated by varying
the tag selection to be tighter or looser with respect to what is used for the efficiency estimate.
The systematic uncertainty due to jet identification is generally less than 1%. The systematic
uncertainty on the trigger selection is estimated from the difference in the trigger efficiencies
measured in data and Monte Carlo, which is well reproduced over the full kinematic range of
the measurement to 1% thanks to the strategy of employing jets from fully efficient triggers for
the measurement. A flat systematic uncertainty of 1% due to trigger is assigned to the final
inclusive jet cross section.
6.4.4. Jet angular resolution uncertainty
The uncertainty on the angular resolution is obtained by smearing the angle with respect to the
beam axis  for each jet by 10% of the width of the distribution of the difference of the truth
and reconstructed  in Monte Carlo. The final uncertainty on the measurement is estimated
comparing the nominal inclusive jet spectrum and the spectrum built from smeared jets. The
uncertainty on the final measurement due to the angular resolution is always less than 1%.
6.4.5. Reconstruction efficiency
The unfolding procedure will restore inefficiencies for jet reconstruction (e.g. due to the noise-
suppression thresholds of topological clusters) based on the Monte Carlo simulation. A systematic
uncertainty needs to be assigned only in the case of data/Monte Carlo disagreement in the
reconstruction efficiency. This has been evaluated using track jets as detailed in Reference [143]:
the efficiency of reconstructing calorimeter jets using track jets as reference objects has been
measured in data and Monte Carlo, and the data/Monte Carlo have been found in agreement
to 2% for jets in the lowest p
T bin and to less than 1% elsewhere. A systematic uncertainty
of 2% for jets from 20 to 30 GeV and 1% for jets with p
T >30 GeV has been assigned. The
uncertainty estimated with this method has been found to be a conservative envelope for the
inefficiencies observed when using truth jets as reference objects over the whole rapidity range,
as shown in Section 4.3.4, and it is therefore extended to the whole rapidity coverage of the
measurement.
6.4.6. Unfolding
The contributions to the systematic uncertainties related to the unfolding procedure come
from the differences in shape between data and Monte Carlo and from varying the criteria for
matching reconstructed and truth jets to derive the transfer matrix.
The systematic uncertainty due to shape differences is evaluated by performing a reweighting
of the true and reconstructed Monte Carlo spectra to be closer to the data. The modified
reconstructed Monte Carlo is then unfolded using the same procedure that is applied to data,
using the nominal unfolding matrix. The relative difference of this unfolding result with respect
to the reweighted true Monte Carlo is taken as systematic uncertainty. This check also effectively
provides a closure test for the unfolding procedure, and the limited size of the systematic
uncertainty (<2.5% for the whole range) shows that the method used is stable.
The transfer matrix is also recalculated using different values for the reconstructed/true jet
matching (R = 0.4 and 0.2 instead of 0.3). The data is unfolded using the new transfer
matrices and the relative difference with respect to the nominal unfolded data spectrum taken
as a systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is more relevant at low pT due to the lower
matching efficiency, but since a fraction of the jets in data corresponding to unmatched jets is
also corrected using the multiplicative reweighting mentioned in Section 6.3.1, the final impact
on the measurement is always less than 1.5%.
6.4.7. Luminosity measurement
The uncertainty on the LHC luminosity measurement has been estimated using scans of the
LHC beam position from October 2010 [58], and it amounts to 3.4%.
6.4.8. Overall systematic uncertainties and correlations
The overall systematic uncertainty for three sample rapidity bins is shown as the shaded blue
area in Figure 6.4 for jets with distance parameter R=0.6 (similar results are found for R=0.4).
The blue line in the figures corresponds to the total JES systematic uncertainty, and it is the
dominating component in the overall uncertainty due to the steeply falling jet spectrum. The
uncertainty due to the jet energy resolution (red line) is relevant especially at low pT where
the knowledge of the simulated resolution is poorer (as explained in Section 4.1), while the
luminosity uncertainty dominates among the other uncertainty sources (orange line).
Bin-to-bin correlations
The largest uncertainty in the measurement is due to the JES uncertainty. As previously
shown in Figures 5.12- 5.14, the dominant JES uncertainty components are the JES calorimeter
uncertainty, the JES intercalibration uncertainty in the forward region and the jet energy
resolution uncertainties: knowledge on the bin-to-bin correlation of these sources is particularly
important to allow the use of this data in fits that compare data to theory and/or use this
comparison to extract theory parameters. The pT and  bin-to-bin correlations of the systematic
uncertainty sources are estimated as in the following, and their treatment is summarised in
Table 6.1.
JES: calorimeter uncertainties These sources are treated as fully correlated in pT and in y up
to y <0.8. In the central region, the breakdown of the calorimeter uncertainty into separate
sources (described in Section 5.7.1) has been constructed to reproduce the correlation
matrix obtained when deriving the uncertainty itself when each source is treated as fully
correlated in both pT and rapidity.
JES: noise thresholds Given that the technique to form topoclusters is the same for all
calorimeters and the calorimeter technologies are similar in the central region, this source
is treated as fully correlated in pT and in y in the central region (y <0.8).
JES: theoretical uncertainty These sources are treated as fully correlated in pT and y in the
central region. This uncertainty source is most relevant at low pT , and there it is assumed
(a) (b)

measurement for R=0.6 in three sample rapidity bins (central in Figure (a), endcap in
Figure (b) and forward in Figure (c)).
that the different soft physics modeling of the Monte Carlo generators used will produce
coherent shifts in the jet energy scale of neighboring bins.
JES: dead material The central region (|y| < 0.8) is composed of similar calorimeter technolo-
gies, therefore this source is treated as fully correlated in pT and y.
All JES uncertainties used as a baseline The calorimeter uncertainty and the previous three
sources (theoretical uncertainty, noise thresholds, dead material - not included in the
calorimeter uncertainty) do not have a direct correspondence for rapidities above y =0.8
where they have been estimated. These sources will affect the bins above y =0.8 because
the central region is used as reference in the intercalibration procedure employed to obtain
the endcap and forward uncertainty. The correlations in pT need to be mantained within
each of the rapidity regions, but there is no indication that the baseline uncertainty in
different rapidity bins will be correlated, given that jets were not calibrated using the
information in the intercalibration analysis and that different calorimeter technologies are
employed to measure jets in the different rapidity bins.
JES: intercalibration since the largest contribution to the intercalibration uncertainty is that
on the physics modelling of radiation in the forward region, assumed to vary coherently in
pT and , this source is treated as fully correlated in pT and y.
Calibration non closure This source is treated as fully correlated in pT but uncorrelated
between central and forward  bins (above |y| < 0.8). This uncertainty component is
derived separately for each  bin (so it is not propagated from the central to the forward
region). It is dominant at low pT , where mass effects lead to non-closure in the calibration
procedure that restores energy - for this reason neighboring bins of similar pT are considered
fully correlated. Another source of non closure are effects due to poor resolution in the
calibration procedure in difficult calorimeter regions (e.g. the 2.8  |y| < 3.6 bin located in
the transition between the HEC and the FCal) that lead to increased statistical fluctuations
when deriving the calibration. If the mean energy at the electromagnetic scale is not well
determined from a Gaussian fit, the constants will not be optimal leading to an imperfect
closure. For this reason this source is considered uncorrelated between bins with different
calorimeter technologies.
Unfolding uncertainty (closure test) This sources is treated as fully correlated in pT and y
bins. It is obtained through a closure test that connects coherently neighboring pT bins
by varying the shape of the spectrum used for the unfolding. Each y bin is unfolded
independently but there is a similar trend observed in all y regions when testing the closure
of the method, and this justifies the rapidity correlation.
Jet matching uncertainty Since the matching uncertainty is derived applying the same change
in matching radius for all y and pT bins, it is considered fully correlated.
Jet energy resolution This source is treated as fully correlated in pT . The consequence of
the steepness of the jet spectrum is that the flux of jets fluctuating to higher pT bins
dominates over jets fluctuating to lower pT bins. Therefore all bins in the spectrum will
fluctuate coherently upwards if the resolution is worse than the one described in the
Monte Carlo, as estimated with this uncertainty source. The resolution uncertainty is
considered uncorrelated between central and forward y bins, due to the different calorimeter
technologies and increasing energies of jets at increasing pseudorapidities. The resolution
uncertainty is fully correlated between the first two y bins because the dijet balance
technique used for the estimate of the resolution analyses them as a single y region.
Angular resolution The angular resolution is influenced by the jet calibration, namely by the
origin and  correction. These have been derived in Monte Carlo from simulation of the
different ATLAS calorimeter technologies, and it is therefore expected that the smearing
of the jet position and its uncertainty will not be correlated between y regions. This
uncertainty is considered as fully correlated in pT because a shift in the jet position will
have a coherent impact on the pT spectrum regardless of the jet transverse momentum.
Trigger This uncertainty source should be treated as completely correlated in pT and y bins
where the same jet trigger or threshold is used. Given that this is a small uncertainty
source, that two different trigger systems are used for central and forward jets and that
there are a number of trigger combinations almost as high as the number of bins used, it
is approximated as completely uncorrelated for the analysis in this thesis.
Jet identification This uncertainty is treated as completely uncorrelated in pT and in y. The
probability of a real jets flagged as fake by the different cuts depends on the jet pT : for
example at very high pT calorimeter saturation could cause an abnormal calorimeter pulse
shape that is then flagged as low quality. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainties on the
cleaning include the statistical fluctuations given that the estimate of the jet identification
efficiency and its uncertainties is performed on the same sample used for the cross section
measurement. The efficiency of the cuts depends also on the calorimeter technology,
and different values for the cuts are used in different rapidity regions, introducing y
decorrelations.
Reconstruction efficiency : This source is treated as completely correlated in pT and partially
correlated in y. The decorrelation in y reflects the different techniques used to estimate the
reconstruction efficiency for || <2.1 (in-situ using track jets) and || >2.1 (using Monte
Carlo truth jets). Correlation in pT is assumed given that a systematic underestimate of
the reconstruction efficiency in data would affect all bins coherently.
Pile-up Given that the correlations in the extra jet energy due to additional soft physics
interactions are on average removed by the pile-up offset correction and that the remaining
pile-up uncertainty depends on effects that dont show obvious correlations in y and pT
(e.g. discrepancy with track jet validation, approximation on the average number of towers
per jet), the pile-up uncertainty is considered as completely uncorrelated. Furthermore,
any correlations introduced by potential bias affecting e.g. the number of primary vertices
used to derive and apply the correction are mitigated by the mixing of different primary
vertices and triggers used in the various pT and y bins of the measurement.
Luminosity This source is treated as fully correlated in pT and y since a change in the estimated
luminosity will shift coherently all bins.
6.5. Theoretical calculations for comparison to data
After having been corrected for detector effects as explained in Section 6.3.1, the inclusive jet
cross section measured in data is compared to the next to leading order theoretical prediction,
which either is corrected for or includes4 non perturbative QCD effects.
The configuration used for the baseline theoretical prediction is the NLOJET++ 4.1.2 [31]
software, which provides the next to leading order prediction for the inclusive jet cross section,
together with the CT10 next to leading order PDF [150].
The renormalisation (R) and factorisation (F ) scales (as introduced in Section 1.2) for the
inclusive jet measurement are fixed to the transverse momentum of the jet.
Since partons are not observable physics objects, the next to leading order prediction needs
to be corrected for non-perturbative effects the partons would be subject to (hadronisation,
underlying event), in order to obtain a theoretical prediction that is comparable to data.
The non-perturbative correction is obtained as a multiplicative factor in each bin of the
theoretical prediction by turning off hadronisation (had) and underlying event and multiple
parton interactions (denoted as UE) in a leading order + parton shower Monte Carlo generator.
The correction is equal to the ratio of the Monte Carlo prediction for the number of jets with
and without the non perturbative effects:
CUE/had =
UE/had
no UE/no had
where the product of CUE and Chad is taken to form the final multiplicative correction.
4The data has also been compared to POWHEG [149], a NLO ME generator that can include parton shower
effects coherently employing other generators such as Pythiaor Herwig.
Different non perturbative effects have different impact on narrower or wider jets:
 The correction for low-pT anti-kt R=0.4 jets is dominated by the effect of hadronisation
particles falling outside the jet. It becomes unity at high p
T , where the hadronized
daughters of the boosted parton will be more collimated. For anti-kt R=0.6 jets the
correction is less important, and still goes to unity at high transverse momentum.
 The correction for low-pT anti-kt R=0.6 jets is dominated by the effect of the underlying
event adding particles to the jet. Its importance decreases with transverse momentum
since underlying event effects are to first order uncorrelated to the hard scatter.
The non perturbative corrections are derived in bins of y using the newest tune to the 2010
ATLAS data for the Pythia generator (called AUET2B and described in [151]), using the
CTEQ6L1 PDF [42]. For low-pT anti-kt R=0.6 jets the total correction can reach values of 1.6
at low pT in the central rapidity regions, while for anti-kt R=0.4 jets the largest deviation of the
correction from unity (0.9) is found at low-pT in the forward region. Since the estimate of these
corrections enters PDF fits when comparing data to theory in the 2 minimisation (as explained
in the next chapter), the appropriate uncertainties should be considered when using theoretical
prediction where the NLO cross section is mostly influenced by non-perturbative physics.
6.5.1. Theoretical uncertainties and uncertainties on non perturbative
corrections
In order to compare the theoretical prediction with the measurement, the theoretical uncertainties
due to the choices made in the NLO calculation, the PDF convolution and in the derivation of
the non perturbative correction need to be evaluated.
The uncertainties on the theoretical prediction are due to the systematic uncertainties on the
parton distribution function used for the convolution, to the renormalisation and factorisation
scales and to the value of the strong coupling constant s used for the QCD evolution. In
order to reduce the time necessary to evaluate the effect of the systematic uncertainties, the
APPLGRID [32] software is interfaced with NLOJET++ as described in Section 1.4.
The theoretical uncertainties are estimated as follows and added in quadrature to form the
total theoretical uncertainty:
Renormalisation and factorisation scales : the sensitivity to the pQCD scales is evaluated
by varying the two values independently by twice and half their nominal value5 and
re-evaluating the theoretical prediction using each combination. The envelope of all
variations is taken as systematic uncertainty, and it amounts to less than 5%, with the
largest uncertainties at low pT for anti-kt R=0.6.
Uncertainties on the chosen PDF : the inclusive jet cross section is calculated using the
parameters corresponding to the positive and negative variations of the eigenvectors of
the Hessian matrix of the CT10 PDF fit (as detailed in Section 7.2) The uncertainty is
estimated as the deviation of the predictions with the systematically shifted parameters
with respect to the nominal theoretical prediction, and normalised to a one-sigma confidence
estimate6. The total PDF uncertainty amounts to 3% at low p
T and increases with
transverse momentum until it dominates the theoretical uncertainty at 200 GeV.
Strong coupling constant : following the CTEQ prescription [152], the cross section is re-
evaluated using special PDF sets with s values that are varied within its best estimate.
The theoretical prediction is then compared to that obtained with the central PDF set (with
the nominal value of s). This uncertainty, together with the baseline PDF uncertainty,
covers the full effect of the variation of the strong coupling constant. The uncertainty due
to s is 2-3% for low p
T and increases to 4-5%.
Non perturbative corrections : The uncertainty on the theoretical prediction is calculated
by estimating the effect of non perturbative effects using different tunes and generators.
Alternative non perturbative correction factors are estimated using a variety of tunes for
both Pythia 6.5, its newest version Pythia 8.150) and for Herwig++ 2.5.1. These
generators have been tuned to ATLAS data and are described in Reference [153]. The
Pythia 6 tunes employed are the AMBT2B tune with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set, the AUET2
tune which uses the modified leading order PDF LO from the MRST collaboration [154]
and the AMBT1 tune (with the MRST LO* PDF) that corresponds to that used for the
nominal sample described in Section. The UE7000-2 tune is employed for the Herwig++
generator, while the tune used for Pythia 8 is called 4C. The maximum spread of
the alternative correction factors around the nominal correction is taken as systematic
uncertainty on the theoretical prediction. This uncertainty dominates the theoretical
uncertainty wherever the correction is larger and driven by the differences in the soft
5The two scales are not both varied in opposite directions to avoid the unphysical situation in which large
logarithms appear in the calculation.
6The values provided by the CTEQ collaboration correspond to a 90% confidence level interval.
physics models of the various tunes and generators: it amounts to up to 26% for anti-kt
R=0.6 and up to 10% for R=0.4.
6.6. Experimental Results and comparison to theory
Figure 6.5 shows the measured inclusive jet cross section and the theoretical prediction as a
function of the jet pT in the different rapidity bins. The cross section for jets with distance
parameter R=0.4 is shown in Figure 6.5 (a), while the result for jets with R=0.6 is shown in
Figure 6.5 (b). Both measurement and predictions have been scaled by a factor to enhance
the legibility of the plot. The ratio of the data to the theoretical prediction is displayed in
Figures 6.6 and 6.7 for R=0.4, and in Figures 6.8 and 6.9 for R=0.6. The kinematic range of
the measurement spans more than 1 TeV in the central bins, and the jet cross sections falls by
more than seven orders of magnitude in this range. The data and theoretical prediction are in
agreement within uncertainties for the whole kinematic range. Some tension can be seen in
the two forwardmost bin, where a trend for data to be lower than the theoretical prediction is
present in the highest pT bins. However, the systematic uncertainties in both data and theory
are too large to be able to discern any significant effect, and to use this specific information
as input to theory. The cross section results after all corrections, the theoretical prediction
and the breakdown of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties for three sample rapidity
regions can also be found in Appendix E, while the full set of results will be made available on
HEPData [155].

Chapter 7.
Impact of ATLAS jet data on PDF fits
The knowledge of parton distribution functions is a fundamental input to theoretical predictions
in hadronic collisions. The uncertainty on the PDFs feeds into the theoretical uncertainty on
the inclusive jet cross section, as shown in the previous chapter. It also impacts new physics
measurements in terms of e.g. the QCD background model used and expected production cross
sections.
It is therefore important to use all available data to constrain the PDFs and minimise their
uncertainties. Measurements of electroweak and QCD physics at the LHC span a kinematic
region in the Q2 and x plane that was not yet covered by previous experiments whose data was
used as input to PDF fits, as shown in Figures 7.1 (a) and (b). The inclusive jet cross section
measurement span an approximate x range of 7  105 < x <0.8, and the highest value for the
dijet mass with the current data is approximately 5 TeV.
The knowledge of the gluon PDF is of particular relevance since gluon-gluon scattering
dominates at the Large Hadron Collider. The gluon PDF can be constrained in deep inelastic
scattering measurements by using scaling violations as mentioned in Section 1.2.2, and by using
jet data in DIS for values of x from  0.01 to 0.1. DIS data therefore do not provide much
information at high x. Furthermore, the only sum rule that constrains the gluon distribution in
deep inelastic scattering is the momentum sum rule mentioned in Section 1.2.2. Using only
this sum rule to constrain the gluon PDF would require an integral over the experimentally
unmeasurable x extremes of 0 and 1, together with a very good knowledge of all the other quark
and antiquark distributions. For these reason QCD processes where gluons directly enter the
non perturbative evolution at leading order (such as the inclusive jet cross section measurement)
are an important input to improve the gluon PDF.

The aim of the study in this chapter is to evaluate the impact of ATLAS jet data on the
PDF parameters and their uncertainties when included in a PDF fit that uses data from the
HERA collider [157] as a baseline. These results need to be taken as a proof of principle that
ATLAS data can have a non-negligible impact on PDF fits even though the dominant JES
uncertainty has not yet reached the desired 1% precision. They will also serve as a stepping
stone for future work given that a more detailed knowledge on the fitting techniques, treatment
of correlated uncertainties and on the details of the code has been reached through this work.
This chapter reviews in more detail the procedure to extract the parton density functions
from experimental data (Section 7.1), describing the strategy for PDF fits. The treatment
of experimental errors and the propagation of the uncertainties from the PDF parameters to
observables is outlined in Section 7.2. The HERA PDF parametrisation and fitting method are
described in more detail in Section 7.3. Finally, the effect of including ATLAS inclusive jet cross
section data in PDF fits together with the HERA data is shown in Section 7.4.
7.1. Extraction of parton distribution functions
Parton distribution functions cannot be predicted from first principles in QCD, but they can be
extracted from the comparison of experimental measurements and theoretical predictions as
detailed in the following.
As a preliminary step to the fitting procedure, an arbitrary input shape for the gluon and
quark PDF is needed at a starting scale Q20 (again arbitrarily chosen). The choice of the basic
input shape for the gluon and quark PDF has been described in Section 1.2.2, but usually more
flexibility is given by adding an extra multiplicative polynomial term P (x, f) to Equation 1.4:
xf(x) = AxB(1 x)CP(x, f) (7.1)
Most experimental measurements do not have a high enough Q2 to probe the top quark scale
in the proton, and the top PDF is therefore neglected in PDF fits. Therefore, PDFs for 11
partons need to be extracted: 10 for the different flavours of quarks and antiquarks plus one for
the gluon. However the charm and bottom PDFs can be calculated in perturbative QCD taking
into account their mass and their production thresholds1 so this leaves a total of 7 PDFs, each
with its parameters, to be determined. The choice of parametrisation and which parameters are
left free in the fit varies between the different PDF fits, and they are outlined in the case of the
HERAPDF fit in the following section.
Once the initial parametrisation at the starting scale has been chosen, the DGLAP equations
are used to evolve the PDFs to the Q2 scale of the measurement. Specific software packages
(e.g. APPLGRID in the case of the inclusive jet cross section) are used to convolve the
PDFs with the QCD coefficient functions, as outlined in Section 1.2. If needed (as in the
case of electroweak/DIS measurements), the PDFs are then combined into the appropriate
structure functions to form the full theoretical prediction. Minimisation of the 2 built from the
comparison of theoretical predictions to experimental data allows the extraction of the best fit
PDF parameters. The explicit 2 definition and techniques to handle experimental uncertainties
and provide uncertainties on the PDF parameters are given in Section 7.2.
1This is generally done exploiting external programs.
7.1.1. PDF fits
The large (10-20) number of parameters needed for a full determination of the chosen PDF
combination require constraints from a number of different sources. Different processes can
be combined in PDF fits, with each of the processes contributing to constraining a PDF
or a combination of PDFs. A recent review of data included in PDF fits can be found in
Reference [158]. Sets of PDFs are used as input to theoretical predictions, and they are
updated regularly whenever new data is available. PDF sets that have been used in the ATLAS
inclusive jet cross section measurement are MSTW08 [37,159], CTEQ [42] and CT10 [150],
NNPDF2.1 [160] and HERAPDF1.5 [157]. Comparison of theoretical predictions for the inclusive
jet cross section using other available PDF sets can be found in Reference [161].
7.2. Treatment of uncertainties
Uncertainties on the fitted PDF parameters can be propagated to the PDFs themselves and
thus to predictions for the measurable structure functions and cross sections. The main sources
of uncertainty on PDF parameters are:
Experimental statistical errors This uncertainty can generally be considered uncorrelated
among the various data points2.
Experimental systematic uncertainties Bin-to-bin correlations of the systematic uncertainties
need to be treated in the fit, as detailed in Section 7.2.1.
Model and parametrisation uncertainties These uncertainties orginate from model assump-
tions and the choice of parametrisation at the starting scale.
Theoretical uncertainties These uncertainties follow from the use of the DGLAP framework
and include the dependence on renormalisation/factorisation scale for higher order correc-
tions and uncertainties on the non-perturbative corrections that need to be applied for the
comparison to data.
Systematic uncertainties often do not have a well-defined one-sigma interpretation, since they
might involve assumptions and they can be affected by limited knowledge of the experimenters.
The question then arises whether estimating the parameter error boundaries using a variation
2This assumption does not necessarily hold in the inclusive jet cross section, where jets in different bins come
from the same event. Even though correlations can be relevant in bins with low statistics (as in the case
of high pT/high rapidity bins) and have been estimated after the unfolding procedure, the treatment of
correlated statistical uncertainties in PDF fits is left for future studies.
2 of unity around the minimum is sufficient to cover one-sigma systematic uncertainties on the
PDF, since this assumes Gaussian errors with their correlations correctly treated. Furthermore,
the inclusion of many different data sets in PDF fits can lead to large values of the fitted 2
due to marginal compatibility of different data sets. In order to ensure that the uncertainties
on the PDF parameters are not underestimated, some PDF fits use a so-called 2 tolerance,
and increase the 2 used for the evaluation of errors to values that can be up to 40-50 (these
figures are largely based on experience and vary depending on the PDF analysis).
Another issue that is present in the propagation of PDF errors to experimental quantities is
that the errors on the PDF fit parameters are correlated since the error matrix for the PDF fit
parameters is not diagonal (this follows from the correlations between the PDF parameters
themselves). The Hessian matrix 3 can be diagonalised and its eigenvectors are used for the
propagation of the errors on the PDF parameters to the measurement. Each eigenvector will
correspond to a combination of parameters, and the eigenvalue to the square of the error on this
combination. For each eigenvalue, two sets of PDFs are provided, accounting for the upwards
and downward shift of the chosen 2 tolerance on the corresponding eigenvector. The error on
a physical quantity X can then be calculated using the following prescription (in the case of
asymmetric errors):
X+ =
Nvect
X+i X0,X
i X0,0
(7.2)
X =
Nvect
X0 X+i ,X0 X
, (7.3)
where X is calculated using the PDF set corresponding to the upwards shifted (X+),
downwards shifted (X+) and central X0 PDF sets and i is an index that runs on the Nvect
eigenvectors.
7.2.1. Treatment of correlated experimental errors in PDF fitting
When the dominant uncertainties in a measurement are the experimental systematic uncertainties,
as in the case of the inclusive jet cross section measurement detailed in Chapter 6, it is
3The Hessian matrix represents the error on a measurement X due to the different parameters i and j
(2X = (ij
min)(ijX), where k represents the partial derivative of a quantity with respect to the k-th
PDF parameter. The underlying assumption that linear error propagation holds is made).
particularly important to treat the correlated systematic errors correctly in fits that make use
of the data/theory comparison to extract QCD parameters. In this study, the prescription of
References [42,162,163] is used and summarised below. The treatment of theoretical errors also
requires care for a correct inclusion in the fits, but it is outside the scope of the study performed
in this thesis, and theoretical errors are not accounted for in the following.
The simplest 2 that can be used (in the case of a single experiment providing the N data
points Di) neglects the correlations between systematic errors and is of the form:
2(p) =

(7.4)
where Ti is the point to point theoretical prediction that depends on the minimisation
parameters p, i,stat and i,uncorr the statistical and experimental errors respectively, considered
as uncorrelated between the different data points. In a more realistic case, each of the data
points can have K sources of correlated systematic errors k. The effect of correlated systematic
errors can be parametrised using a series of parameters rk that are extracted from a Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and unit width, and included in the fit as nuisance parameters:
2(p, r) =
2i,stat + 
i,uncorr
[(Di  Ti(p)
rkik)
r2k (7.5)
The minimisation can then be performed with respect to both the fit parameters and the
systematic parameters, therefore including the effect of the systematic fluctuations to the
measurement in the fit result. When multiple experiments are included in PDF fits, the number
of parameters to minimise becomes large and the simultaneous minimisation of all of them
might not be desirable. The equivalent approach of using a 2 that includes the covariance
matrix Vij as in Equations 7.7
2(p) =
i,j=1
(Di  Ti(p))V 1ij (Di  Ti(p)) (7.6)
Vij = (
i,stat + 
i,uncorr)ij +
kikj (7.7)
presents an equivalent practical difficulty since it involves the inversion of a large matrix that
could have a singular behaviour if the correlated systematic uncertainties dominate.
A solution that is mathematically equivalent to these two methods is to minimise the 2 in
Equation 7.5 analytically with respect to the systematic shifts r, as shown in Reference [163]
. The actual fit minimisation then only needs to be performed with respect to the theory
parameters p, while the best values of the systematic shifts are given by the analytic minimisation.
The form of the 2 used in the fit is:
2(p) = 2(p, r(p)) =
(Di  Ti(p))2
2i,stat + 
i,uncorr
k,l=1
kl Bl (7.8)
Bk(p) =
ik(Ti(p)Di)
2i,stat + 
i,uncorr
(7.9)
Akl(p) = kl +
ikil
2i,stat + 
i,uncorr
(7.10)
where the indices k and l run on the number of systematic sources K. The advantage of this
procedure is that in a PDF fit where the errors from different datasets coming from different
experiments are generally uncorrelated the matrix A can be inverted in blocks for each separate
experiment. Furthermore, the procedure gives an estimate of the best values of the systematic
shifts using the A and B matrices as:
rk(a) =
(A1kl )Bl (7.11)
In this treatment, systematic (nuisance) parameters are effectively allowed to vary in the fit,
and the theoretical prediction will move coherently according to the correlations of each source.
Another improvement to the 2 in terms of treatment of errors is the separate treatment of
the statistical uncertainties that are proportional to
N and of the systematic uncertainties
that are generally multiplicative errors, as described in References [20,164].
7.3. Details on PDF analysis with ATLAS and HERA data
The baseline for the tests that include ATLAS data is the HERAPDF analysis, used to derive the
set of PDF numbered with 1.5 [157]. The same DIS data as used in the HERAPDF fits is used
as a starting point for the analysis in this thesis. The choice of the PDF parametrisation used for
this analysis at the starting scale Q20 is the same as the HERAPDF 1.5, with further flexibility
in the parameters fitted, as reported in Section 7.3.2. There are 134 sources of systematic
uncertainties for the 674 points included in the HERAPDF 1.5 analysis, but only the last three
need to be treated as correlated. HERA PDF fits only use a consistent dataset (described in
Section 7.3.1) with well understood systematic uncertainties, and the 2 tolerance can be set
to unity. The specific software used for this study is the ZEUS PDF fitting package [165]. A
further note on the model and parametrisation uncertainties included in the HERAPDF 1.5 set
is found in Section 7.3.3, although these are not determined for the analysis in this thesis.
7.3.1. HERAPDF dataset
The HERAPDF dataset includes a combination of HERA-I and HERA-II data taken at a
proton beam energy of 820 and 920 GeV. The measurements included are the ZEUS and H1
combination of the neutral current and charged current for both e+p and ep scattering (the
measurement is a preliminary update of [20]). The kinematic range of the full set of data point
spans 6 107 < x < 0.65 and 0.045 < Q2 < 30000 GeV2, although only data points with
Q2 > Qmin =3.5 GeV
2 are used so that the PDF analysis is performed in a valid region for the
perturbative DGLAP evolution. The charged current measurements provide information on the
high x valence PDFs for both up and down flavours, while the neutral current constrains the
low x sea. The difference between the NC e+ and e- cross-sections at high Q2 gives information
on the valence quark PDF for x & 102. Information on the gluon PDF are obtained via scaling
violations of the structure functions.
7.3.2. Starting scale parametrisation and parameter fitted
The PDFs parametrised in the HERAPDF analysis are chosen based on the structure functions
that appear in deep inelastic scattering cross sections. These are:
 the up and down valence quark PDFs (uv, dv),
 the total sea up-type and down-type antiquark PDFs (U, D, where the up-type includes
antiup and anticharm and the down-type includes antidown, antistrange and antibottom),
 the gluon PDF,
 the strange quark PDF, derived from the down-type antiquark PDF.
The initial PDF parametrisation used in this analysis for the quark and antiquark PDF, at
the starting scale Q20=1.9 GeV
2, are of the form:
xf(x) = AxB(1 x)C(1 +Dx+Ex2 + 
x), (7.12)
where in the following the coefficients for the specific parton PDFs will be denoted with the
parton subscript.
The D, E and  coefficients are introduced one by one in the fit and only kept if the 2 is
improved. In this analysis (and in the HERAPDF 1.5 one) the only non-zero coefficient is Euv for
the up valence quark PDF. The B coefficients for both sea up- and down-types are the same, in
order to keep a single coefficient for the sea. In the ZEUS fitting code, the U and D are combined
in a single sea PDF that is twice their sum. The normalisation for the down-type antiquarks is
defined in terms of that for the whole sea (Asea). The conversion between the normalisation for
the down-type antiquarks and that for the sea is AD = (Asea/2)  (1 fc)/(2 fs fc), where
the fraction of charm quark at the starting scale (below the charm threshold) is fc=0 and the
fraction of strange quark is fs=0.31 (from Reference [166]).
The DGLAP evolution of the gluon PDF is very fast: even with a flat distribution as input
at Q20, it quickly becomes very steeply rising at low x for Q
2 > Q20. Conversely, for Q
2 < Q20
the gluon PDF turns over, becoming valence-like in shape or even becoming negative at low x
and Q2. Since the choice of Q20 and of the initial PDF parameterisation is arbitrary, some of the
PDF analyses add a term to the gluon parametrisation so that it has the freedom to become
negative at values below the starting scale 4. This follows the behaviour observed by the ZEUS
and MRST PDF analyses when evolving down the analytic forms to low Q2. An extra term is
added to Equation 7.12 for the parametrisation of the gluon density:
xg(x) = Agx
g (1 x)
Cg  |Ag|x
Bg(1 x)C
g (7.13)
The coefficient C is fixed to the value of 25, high enough to avoid contributions from this term
at large values of x.
4This is not necessarily worrisome because the gluon density is not an observable quantity and it has to be
convoluted with coefficient functions. On the other hand if the structure function related to the gluon PDF
were predicted to have the same negative behaviour, it would indicate a breakdown of the DGLAP formalism
at these scales. This is also hinted at by the values of the B coefficients for gluon and sea: at low Q2,
Bg > Bsea, contradicting the common idea that sea quarks are produced mainly from gluon splitting.
The normalisation coefficients A for the valence quark and gluon PDFs are constrained by the
proton sum rules (the number of up and down valence quarks is fixed to 2 and 1 respectively)
and the momentum sum rule.
The strange quark PDF xs(x) is obtained using the estimated fraction of strange quarks in
the sea fs as:
xs(x) = fsD(x) (7.14)
The normalisation of the sea-type up and down quarks is also constrained using the fraction of
strange quarks as Au = Ad(1 fs), so that if x 0 anti-up and anti-down PDFs have the
same behaviour. A total of 13 parameters are left free in the fits performed in this study: they
are shown in Table 7.1 together with their starting value.

The differences with respect to the publicly available parametrisation of HERAPDF 1.5 are
the negative gluon term (Ag, B
g are not fixed to zero) and separate B parameters for the up-
and down-type valence quarks.
The chosen value of s(Mz) in this analysis and in the HERAPDF 1.5 fit is 0.1176, as
determined independently from deep inelastic scattering data [167]. The value of s(Mz) is
particularly important for the gluon PDF that always enters the DGLAP evolution with factors
of s. The treatment of heavy quarks takes into account their mass using the Global Mass
Variable Flavor Number Scheme (GM-VFNS [168,169]), with the charm and bottom quark
masses set to 1.4GeV and 4.75 GeV respectively. The starting scale Q20 for the HERAPDF fit
is 1.9 GeV2, chosen to be below the charm mass threshold. The DGLAP evolution is performed
using the QCDNUM [170] program for the DIS data and APPLGrid for the ATLAS jet data,
using Q2 as renormalisation and factorisation scales, in the MS renormalisation scheme [171].
7.3.3. HERAPDF: model and parametrisation uncertainties
HERAPDF sets also provide model and parametrisation uncertainties through varying some of
the above assumptions, scales and quark masses, as described in [20]. The model uncertainties
include the variation of:
 the threshold for the inclusion of DIS data Q2min;
 the charm and bottom masses mc,mb;
 the fraction of strange quarks fs at the starting scale.
The parametrisation uncertainties are estimated allowing the D parameter in Equation 7.12 to
be non-zero for the uv and gluon PDFs, and taking the envelope of the maximum deviation of
the PDFs at each value of x. Furthermore, the starting scale Q20 is varied to evaluate the effect
of the evolution of the parametrisation starting from a different scale.
7.4. Results: HERAPDF1.5 and ATLAS data
The ATLAS jet data from the inclusive jet cross section was added to the HERAPDF 1.5 data,
leading to a total of 764 data points included in the PDF analysis. The number of data points
minus the number of parameters will be treated as the number of degrees of freedom NDoF in
the following. Separate analyses have been performed for the two jet distance parameters.
The correlations of systematic uncertainties in the jet data detailed in Section 6.4.8 have
been treated using the method that analytically minimises the 2 in terms of the nuisance
parameters rk. The positive and negative uncertainties on each data point 
+, + for each
source have been symmetrised using the following formula:
sign(+)  (|+|+ ||)/2.
The unsigned average acquires the sign of the positive uncertainty, to take into account the
cases when the positive error is a downwards one and negative error is an upwards one (to
preserve anticorrelations).
For the analysis including anti-kt jets with distance parameter R=0.4, the total 
2 is 782,
leading to a reduced 2/NDoF of 1.04. The breakdown of the 
2 for the two datasets is 734 for
the 674 HERA data points and 48 for the 90 ATLAS data points. The total 2 for anti-kt
R=0.6 jets is 795 (2/NDoF=1.06), of which 736 from HERA data and 59 from ATLAS jet
data. In the treatment of the systematic uncertainties outlined in Section 7.2.1, the nuisance
parameters rk are shifted by no more than 1.1 sigma.
7.4.1. Impact of ATLAS jet data on PDF fits
The results of the PDF analysis including ATLAS jet data for a number of selected PDFs at
the starting value of Q20=1.9 are shown in Figures 7.2- 7.5, while the best fit parameters for the
chosen PDFs are shown in Table 7.1. The layout of the plots shows the PDFs extracted from a
fit to HERA data only (in red) with the PDFs extracted from a fit to HERA+ATLAS jet data
superimposed (in dark blue). The bottom panel shows the relative uncertainty in the shaded
areas (in yellow shading for the HERA-only analysis and in blue lines for the HERA+ATLAS
analysis and the ratio between the central PDF values (HERA/HERA+ATLAS) as the blue
line.
The inclusion of the ATLAS jet data has the following effects on the parton distribution
functions:
 The shape of the gluon distribution hardens from x 0.02, and its relative uncertainty is
reduced. The change is significant with respect to the uncertainties for x >0.1. Further
tests (by excluding in turn high-pT jets and forward  bins from the fit) show that this
effect is mostly due to the forward pseudorapidity bins.
 The q/q sea is influenced by the changes in the gluon distribution, and shows a slightly
less steep shape starting from x =0.1.
 Including the ATLAS jet data does not make a relevant difference for the up valence
quark, since it is already well constrained by HERA data. Some improvement in the PDF

uncertainty and a slightly harder shape can be noticed for the down-type valence quark at
high x.
The DGLAP evolution leads the gluon to rise steeply at low x , and the changes at high x at
the starting scale propagate to lower x, as shown in Figure 7.6.
7.4.2. Determination of s(M
Z) with ATLAS jet data
The strong coupling constant s enters the DGLAP equations, and its value at the Z mass can
therefore be determined from a PDF fit if it is considered as a free parameter instead of fixing it
to a given value as it had been done in the PDF analysis of Section 7.4.1. Furthermore, if s is
left free the strong correlations with the gluon parameters can be accounted for in the fit.
When a fit is performed with the same starting parameters as those in Table 7.1 and s(M
is left free starting from a value of 0.1176, its value after the minimisation when the ATLAS jet
data with distance parameter R=0.4 is included in the fit is
ATLAS jetss (M
Z) = 0.12090.0019. (7.15)
If only HERA data is fitted, the final value of s(M
Z) does not vary as much from its starting
value, and its error is larger:
No jetss (M
Z) = 0.11640.0031. (7.16)
Even though there are no estimates of the model or parametrisation uncertainties, the values of
Z) from both analyses above are compatible with the value 
GFitter
Z) = 0.1193 0.0028
from the global Standard Model fit by the GFitter collaboration [172,173] within the current
uncertainties. The observation of a higher s value with respect to the default of 0.1176
when including jet data is also consistent with that noted in the HERA determination in
Reference [174] (HERA jetss (M
Z) = 0.1202 0.0013, where only the experimental uncertainties
have been mentioned).
The gluon distribution at Q2 =10 GeV2 that is output of the PDF fits with s(M
Z) left
as a free parameter is shown in Figure 7.7: a higher value of s(M
Z) leads to a softer gluon
distribution at low x.

7.4.3. Impact of reduced JES uncertainty
A further test of the impact of ATLAS jet data on the gluon distribution can be performed
assuming a rough reduction of the existing jet energy scale uncertainties. Given that the ATLAS
design goal is to reduce the jet energy scale to values of approximately 1%, every component of
the jet energy scale is reduced to one third of its value, while the correlations are mantained.
This is by no means a test with a precise physical meaning for future LHC data taking: the
jet energy scale uncertainties will not be estimated using the calorimeter and Monte Carlo
response as described in Chapter 5 but using in-situ techniques instead. In addition to this, the
pile-up conditions are much harder in the 2011 LHC running than in the 2010 dataset, so the
composition and correlations of the JES uncertainty is going to change substantially from the
current estimate. Nevertheless, the results of a PDF analysis with reduced JES uncertainties
can offer qualitative information on the amount of gluon density uncertainty that is driven by
the uncertainty on the jet energy scale.
Only the gluon distribution is shown in Figure 7.8, where one can see that the relative
uncertainty is further reduced, and the shape change becomes significant from a slightly lower
value of x. The 2/NDoF in the case of inclusion of the ATLAS jet data increases to 76 and 92
for the 90 data points of anti-kt R=0.4 and R=0.6 respectively, and the total 
2 for the whole
dataset is 820 and 838 respectively, showing some tension with the HERA data.
7.4.4. Conclusions on the PDF analysis
The analysis performed for this thesis shows that the inclusion of the ATLAS inclusive jet
cross section data in the HERAPDF analysis leads to an improvement in the knowledge of
gluon distribution at high x. The value of the strong coupling constant at the Z mass peak
is evaluated as a parameter of the PDF fit: the PDF analysis with the inclusion of ATLAS
jet data fits it to a value of ATLAS jetss (M
Z) = 0.1209  0.0019, where the error quoted is
only that on the fitted value. The uncertainty on the gluon PDF can be further reduced if
the systematic uncertainty on the jet energy scale is reduced according to the ATLAS goals of
1%. These results are a preliminary proof of principle that ATLAS jet data can contribute
to constraining the parton distribution functions: and the theoretical/model uncertainty still
need to be estimated. These results need to be integrated in an overall fit to HERA/Tevatron
jets, and work is in progress to perform a combined fit together with the LHC W asymmetry
data [175].

Conclusions and outlook
The analysis of the first ATLAS data collected from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of
s = 7 TeV at the LHC is an opportunity to test the Standard Model of particle
physics to scales never reached before. The energy scale of the LHC is beyond any other particle
accelerator: The theory has not yet been verified at these energies and the experiments will
require tuning and calibration before being fully understood. With the beginning of data taking,
processes which have previously been measured will serve as standard candles in order to test the
Standard Model predictions with the new detectors. The inclusive jet cross section belongs to
this category: analysis of the first data is needed to test the cutting edge technologies employed
for the experiment, validate and improve jet reconstruction techniques that had previously
been tested in Monte Carlo simulation and rediscover QCD. It is also through tests of the
Standard Model and QCD that we may discover new physics: significant deviations from the
Standard Model predictions in unexplored regions of phase space could be a sign of of new, as
yet undiscovered processes.
In order to compare data and theory, the experimental and theoretical uncertainties need to
be reduced as much as possible with detailed studies of the jet reconstruction and calibration
techniques and of the inputs to the theoretical predictions. It is precisely this context in which
this thesis has been developed.
The experimental uncertainty on the inclusive jet cross section measurement is dominated
by the systematic uncertainty on the jet energy scale: the first part of this thesis focuses on
the understanding of the performance of jets using using 35 pb1 of ATLAS data collected in
2010. The JES systematic uncertainty has been evaluated for calorimeter jets reconstructed
with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 and R = 0.6, calibrated to
the hadronic energy scale using the EM+JES calibration scheme, with calibrated transverse
momenta p
T > 20 GeV and pseudorapidities || < 4.5. It has been estimated using a
combination of in-situ techniques and an analysis of systematic variations in Monte Carlo
simulations, and it is found to be of similar size for both jet distance parameters studied.
The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 2.5% is found in the central calorimeter region
(|| < 0.8) for jets with 60 GeV  pjetT < 800 GeV. The JES uncertainty is the largest for
low-pT (20 GeV  p
T < 30 GeV) jets in the most forward region 3.2  || < 4.5 where it
amounts to 14%. The additional energy due to multiple proton-proton interactions is corrected
for and the remaining uncertainty in this data taking period is less than 1.5% per additional
interaction for jets with p
T > 50 GeV and decreases with pT. The JES is validated up to
T = 1 TeV using several in-situ methods.
The measurement of the inclusive jet cross section is reviewed and compared to theory
for both jet distance parameters of 0.4 and 0.6. The kinematic range of this measurement
spans more than 1 TeV in the central bins, and the jet cross sections falls by more than seven
orders of magnitude in this range. The data and theoretical prediction are in agreement within
uncertainties for the whole kinematic range.
The ATLAS inclusive jet cross section measurement has been used as input to the determination
of the parton distribution functions using the ZEUS PDF fitting code in a proof of principle
analysis to show that ATLAS data can have a non-negligible impact on PDF fits, even when
the dominant JES uncertainty has not yet reached the desired 1% precision. The inclusion of
ATLAS jet data together with data from the HERA collider as a baseline leads to a harder
gluon PDF with reduced uncertainties. It also allows to estimate the strong coupling constant
at the Z mass peak as a parameter of the PDF fit, leading to a value of ATLAS jetss (M
0.1209  0.0019, where the error quoted is only that on the fitted value. The conclusions
from this preliminary study need completion in the estimate of the theoretical, model and
parameterisation uncertainties, but they can serve as a starting point for the inclusion of ATLAS
jet data in a full global fit that also includes HERA and Tevatron jet data, and where the
recent Tevatron, ATLAS and CMS electroweak data on the W asymmetry is included as well to
constrain the slope of the d/u PDFs at low x.
The measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in ATLAS can be further exploited in PDF
fits, given that a large number of ingredients have been readied for the analysis of the full 2010
dataset. A detailed analysis of correlated uncertainties between the two jet distance parameters
would allow cancellation of a number of components related to the jet energy scale uncertainties
when the ratio between jet cross sections with different radii is taken. Given that this quantity
can be calculated analytically to next to leading order [176,177], it could be a powerful input
for PDF fits. Furthermore, the jet cross section ratio could provide useful information on non
perturbative effects in jets. Ratios could also be taken for jet cross sections at different LHC
centre of mass energy, profiting from the 2.76 TeV run of the beginning of 2011 [178].

Appendix A.
In-situ validation of the jet energy scale
and resolution
This appendix contains additional details on the techniques used to validate the jet energy
scale and jet energy resolution in-situ. The jet energy resolution techniques are described in
Section A.1, while the techniques to validate the Monte Carlo based jet energy scale are in
Section A.2.
A.1. Estimate of the jet energy resolution with data
Dijet balance method
The dijet balance method [116] relies on the energy conservation in the transverse plane in the
case of dijet events. Events with such topology are selected applying a cut on the azimuthal
angle between the two leading jets  so that they are back to back ( < 2.8) and limiting
the presence of significant third jet radiation by imposing pEMT,3 < 10 GeV, where p
T,3 is the
third jet EM-scale transverse momentum. The two jets are required to be in the same rapidity
region so that their energy will be comparable and they will be traversing similar calorimeter
technologies1. The asymmetry A between the two jets is defined as:
p1T  p
p1T + p
. (A.1)
Taking the variance of the asymmetry and assuming that the transverse momenta of the two
jets are balanced (p1T  p
T ) leads to a direct connection between the width of the asymmetry
distribution and that of the jet transverse momentum:
1A similar procedure can also be used to estimate the resolution of jets in different rapidity regions, if the
resolution for one of the two rapidity regions is known.
2A. (A.2)
Since the cut on the pT of the third jet cut does not exclude the presence of additional jets
with pEMT,3 <10 GeV that could imbalance the event, a soft radiation correction Ksoft is derived
by extrapolating the fractional resolution to a value of pEMT,3 <0. This is done employing a series
of steps in the pEMT,3 cut and using a linear fit for the extrapolation, as shown in Figure A.1.
The correction is taken as the ratio of the extrapolated fractional resolution with respect to the
fractional resolution with the pEMT,3 <10 GeV cut:

with the linear fit (solid line) and extrapolation (dashed line) to pEMT,3 =0 in a sample
T bin. Figure from [114]
The correction is then fitted as a function of pT using the empirical parameterisation
Ksoft(pT ) = a+b/ log
2(pT ), which has the desired property of becoming unity for large values of
pT (where radiation is negligible with respect to the jet momenta). Additional parameterisations
were employed, and the variation of the corrected resolution is taken as a systematic uncertainty
of the method of up to 5%.
The imbalance between calorimeter jets due to physics effects is also removed in order to only
include calorimeter effects in the evaluation of the fractional resolution. For this reason, the
particle-level imbalance is derived using Monte Carlo truth jets using the method above and
subtracted in quadrature from the in-situ resolution after the soft radiation correction.
The total systematic uncertainty for the dijet balance method amounts to 4-6% in the p
range of 20-500 GeV.
Bisector method
The bisector method [117] uses the decomposition of the vector sum of the two leading jet four
momenta PT to estimate the jet energy resolution. As shown in Figure A.2, PT is projected on
the  axis (which bisects the angle 1,2 between the two jets) and the orthogonal  axis. PT
represents the imbalance between the transverse momenta of the two jets. Its two projections on
the , axes are called pT, and pT, and their variance is used to estimate the jet resolution.
Figure A.2.:Schematic representation of the decomposition of the vector sum of the two leading jet
four momenta used to estimate the jet resolution using the bisector method. Figure
from [114].
The underlying assumption is that at particle level, the two components of the imbalance
vector will have equal fluctuations, and the imbalances are due to fluctuations from calorimeter
effects. Using this assumption, the fractional resolution can be expressed in terms of the
variances of the two imbalance components induced by calorimeter effects (2,calo and 
2,calo
and the angle between the two jets:
2,calo
  2,calo
2 cos(1,2)
The variances 2,calo and 
2,calo
 are extracted from the distribution of the projections of PT
in bins of the average p
T ) of the two leading jets.
The event selection follows that of the dijet balance method, but removing the cut on the
angle between the two jets. The assumption of isotropy of the soft radiation is tested by
changing the value of the third jet cut and checking 2,calo , 
2,calo
 and their difference. As shown
in Figure A.3, the increase of the soft radiation contribution cancels in the squared difference
within 3-4% for the 30-40 GeV p
T bin. The precision to which this assumption holds is taken
as a systematic uncertainty of the method.

A.2. In-situ validation of the jet energy scale
A.2.1. Photon-jet balance
The transverse momentum balance between a photon and the hadronic recoil is used to probe
the jet energy scale in two methods with different systematic uncertainties and sensitivities [118].
The direct gamma-jet balance exploits the balance between photon and jet transverse momenta
that is found at leading order of perturbation theory. The jet response is defined as the ratio
of the photon and jet transverse momenta: p
T . Cuts on the azimuthal distance between
the photon and the jet and on the subleading jet are applied to to suppress soft radiation
and multi-jet configurations. Good photons and matching jets are selected within a fiducial
calorimeter region. Jet faking photons are rejected using an isolation cut.
The Missing-energy Projection Fraction (MPF) method probes the hadronic response using
the leading-order transverse momentum conservation between the photon (p
T ) and its full
hadronic recoil (p
T ): p
T + p
T = 0.
This method assumes that the imbalance between the jet and photon transverse momenta
measured in the calorimeters is generated by calorimeter non compensation, noise suppression
effects and inactive material in front of the calorimeters (dead material). The imbalance vector
can written in terms of the missing energy estimated from the calorimeter measurement EmissT
and it can be written in terms of the jet and photon calorimeter responses Rjet and R
T + Rjetp
T = E
If the photon is well calibrated, its response will be unitary: exploiting momentum balance
and projecting the missing energy vector along the photon direction, the above equation can be
rewritten as:
Rjet = 1 +
n EmissT
|pT|
(A.3)
In Equation A.3, the jet response is written in terms of calorimeter observables, and does not
depend directly on the jet transverse momentum: it is therefore roughly independent of the
jet algorithm used for jet reconstruction. The same kinematic cuts mentioned for the direct
gamma-jet balance are also used in the MPF analysis.
The jet energy scale is validated using the jet response with respect to the photon in data and
Monte Carlo before and after the EM+JES calibration. The MPF method does not depend
directly on the jet transverse momentum. Therefore a simple shift of the energy scale, as in the
case of the EM+JES calibration, will not affect the data/Monte Carlo ratio. Therefore the
validation of the EM+JES calibration can be performed using jets at the electromagnetic scale.
Results for the EM+JES calibration are shown in Figures A.4 (a) and (b) for the direct
balance method and the MPF method respectively, and results for Global and Local Cell
Weighting can be found in Reference [118].
The jet energy scale is validated with the photon-jet balance method for all calibrations
considered to within 5% for p
T <45 GeV and to within 3% for 45 < p
T <250 GeV. The major
systematics, related to the photon energy scale, the presence of jets faking photons, the soft
radiation and the in-time pile-up have also been considered in Reference [118] and found to be
less than 1.6% for p
T >45 GeV.
A.2.2. Balance between a high-pT jet recoiling against lower-pT jets
The calibration of very high transverse momentum jets is a particularly challenging topic for
the first ATLAS data due to the limited statistics available for in-situ validations with -jet
methods. A well understood energy scale is necessary for highly energetic jets, since they are
among the signatures for early New Physics searches. When jets at low transverse momentum
are reasonably well calibrated (e.g. using the photon-jet balance methods), they can be used
to assess the calibration of the recoiling, high-pT jet using transverse momentum balance, as

detailed in [119]. The Multi-Jet Balance (MJB in the following) is defined as the ratio between
the leading jet p
Leading
T and the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all recoiling jets p
Recoil
The data/Monte Carlo ratio of MJB is used to validate the jet energy scale in 2010 data up to
the Terascale. A selection of events with a leading jet and a well defined recoil system that
is not dominated by a single jet are selected using cuts on the azimuthal angle between the
jet and the recoil system, the isolation of the leading jet and the transverse momentum of the
subleading jet in the recoil system.
The Multi-Jet Balance method validates the energy scale to within 3%, as shown in Fig. A.5.
The systematics of the method are estimated in [119]: they take into account the jet energy
scale uncertainty, the dependence of the jet response on the jet flavour and on the presence of
close-by jets in the recoil system (discussed in detail in Chapter 5), the analysis cuts, soft QCD
effects and pile-up. These effects and are estimated to lead to a systematic uncertainty of about
A.2.3. Comparison of calorimeter to track jet transverse momentum
Another method of validating the jet energy scale is the comparison of the transverse momentum
of the calibrated jets measured with the calorimeter to associated jets measured in an independent
subsystem, as in the case of the track-jet measurement presented in [120]. Track-jets are composed
by all charged tracks measured in the ATLAS inner detector within an , cone equal to the
distance parameter of the jet considered. The transverse momentum of track-jets is compared
to the pT of calibrated calorimeter jets. The double ratio Rrtrk of the track-jet and calorimeter
jet transverse momenta in data and Monte Carlo is used for the validation of the jet energy
scale uncertainty. Only jets with with a transverse above a pT dependent cut are used in the

measurement, to ensure close to full efficiency for the trigger used for measuring the jet. A
cut on the jet pseudorapidity of less than 2.1 is needed to ensure that the majority of tracks
belonging to the track-jet is found in the fiducial volume of the inner detector. Furthermore, in
configurations where two jets are separated by a distance R less than twice the jet distance
parameter, only the hardest jets are used in order to minimize effects due to nearby jets on the
measurement. The track selections are detailed in Section 4 of [120].
The double ratio Rrtrk for EM+JES calibrated jets in the central region is shown in Fig. A.6:
data and simulation agree to better than 2% for jets in the pT range of 25 to 1000 GeV. The
systematic uncertainties as estimated in [120] are related to the generator model dependence,
the description of the material and the alignment in the inner detector, the tracking efficiency,
and the calorimeter jet resolution, and they amount to less than 4%.

Appendix B.
Jet performance analysis tools
The goal of the JetPerformance package [179,180] is to provide a common set of definitions
and algorithms to measure quantities relevant to the performance of jet reconstruction through
a series of standardised validation plots. Comparison and cross checking of jet reconstruction
procedures on different samples are more effective if the individual users adopt a coherent
approach, through code which is available within the ATHENA framework. While providing
standardised ways for measuring the jet performance, this package is still easily extensible by
the addition of user-defined tools and plots.
The design of the package and its use in combination with the JetFrameworkTools
allows to perform cuts on the signal sample and define the benchmark quantities to be plotted at
run-time. This is particularly convenient when the same analysis needs to be repeated multiple
times with similar parameters, as in the case of the derivation of the JES uncertainty.
This Appendix starts with an overview of the JetFrameworkTools package in Section B.1.
The JetPerformance package, together with the workflow of a typical performance analysis
is briefly described in Section B.2. Cases where the JetPerformance package has been
employed are discussed in Section B.3.
B.1. The JetFrameworkTools package
A typical jet performance analysis takes as input a jet collection. Different analyses need to
perform similar cuts, but with variable cut ranges: the need of a flexible framework with a
uniform behaviour has been met with the design of the JetFrameworkTools package in the
ATHENA software framework.
i have sth to confuse yumis language learning process, are you at cern tomorrow?
The JetFrameworkTools package provides the underlying infrastructure to steer workflows
in the form of a Data Flow Graph (DFG). Each node of the graph, performs a specific action
such as the retrieval of the object from memory, a selection cut or a plotting task. Graph nodes
are called filters and selectors depending on their behaviour, and they can be concatenated.
The graph then takes care of executing the actions (e.g. cuts, plotting) in each node in the
correct order specified by the user.
Filters receive one or more collections of objects as input, and deliver a copy of one of
the collections or a subset of it as output, while selectors perform a selection on the whole
event. The most common use of the filters is to perform a selection on the input collections -
for example, a JetFilter will remove from the input collection all the jets that do not pass a
user-defined kinematic cut.
The JetFrameworkTools package makes use of an external parser called muParser [181]
to allow definition of the selection variables and cut ranges at run time.
B.2. The JetPerformance package
The JetPerformance package is part of the ATHENA framework and it aims to provide a
common infrastructure to evaluate the performance of the jet reconstruction (comparing e.g.
calibrations, jet algorithms, different datasets).This is achieved by comparing the reconstructed
jets to a collection of reference objects that can provide either in-situ balance or provide a
truth benchmark such as particle jets built from MonteCarlo. The performance of the jet
reconstruction is then measured in term of linearity, resolution, spatial resolution, purity and
efficiency (where the latter three are available only for MC comparison) in kinematic and spatial
bins.
This package aims to provide a common set of definitions and algorithms to measure quantities
relevant to the performance of jet reconstruction through a series of standardised validation
plots, compiled with the help the different JetPerformanceTools that take as input different
collections of reference objects. Comparison and cross checking of jet reconstruction procedures
on different samples are more effective if the individual users adopt a coherent approach, through
code which is available within the ATHENA framework and commonly agreed algorithms which
are customizable at run-time. At the same time, this package is still easily extensible by adding
new user-defined Tools or performance plots.
The code structure has been developed to provide a common interface for performing the cuts
for all the JetPerfTools, increased flexibility in the plotting from an intermediate data format
and reduced code duplication (all the common characteristics and functions for the single tools
are either abstracted in a base class or taken from centralised helper classes in the package).
B.2.1. Jet Performance workflow
The workflow of the JetPerformance software is composed of three steps:
1. the calculation of the relevant performance quantities on the selected signal is obtained by
running the various JetPerformance tools on the input data. These tools extract basic
quantities for measuring the jet performance and make them available for further analysis
through a basic ROOT ntuple (intermediate data);
2. the intermediate data can be merged - this can be the case when the code is run in
parallel with a distributed analysis framework or when output from different energy/trigger
samples needs to be weighted and merged;
3. the desired performance plots are obtained by running standardised algorithms on the
(merged) output of the tools - calculations of the quantities relevant to the evaluation
of the jet performance are performed and the quantities are plotted against the desired
kinematic or spatial variable.
A performance plotting tool is a filter as described in Section B.1, since it takes as input a
collection of reconstructed jets and a collection of reference objects. While leaving the input
collections untouched, it will retrieve the relevant variables and save them into the intermediate
data format for subsequent plotting. This is how the JetPerformance code structure fits in
the JetFrameworkTools framework.
An example of the workflow of a typical performance analysis that compares the kinematic
properties of reconstructed jets to those of true jets is shown in figure B.1. Filters are used to
perform the selection of the jets that will be used in the specific JetPerformance algorithm, in
this case called JetPerfToolTruth. As a first step, both the true and the reconstructed jet
collections are retrieved from the transient data storage through SourceFilters. A number of
JetFilters can then be used to select only the jets of interest from the two jet collections, and
only these jets will proceed to be analysed by the performance algorithm of choice. The output
of the jet performance algorithm is an intermediate data structure (JetPerfDataStructure).
The JetPerfDataStructure is subsequently read in another algorithm, called JetPerfPlot-
tingAlg, where the final performance plots are produced.
B.3. Use cases
The performance of the jet reconstruction is evaluated in the JetPerformance package using
in-situ energy balance techniques, as well as comparison to truth jets built from Monte-Carlo
particles. The jet reconstruction performance is measured in terms of linearity, resolution,
purity and efficiency in kinematic and spatial bins. Typical use cases are the comparison of
different jet algorithms or calibrations, the validation of calibration constants and weights. The
JetPerformance package is used in the ATLAS Jet-EtMiss working group for these purposes.
B.3.1. Use case: validation of the jet energy scale calibrations
The results presented in this section have been obtained using the JetPerfToolTruth tool:
this tool evaluates the response of reconstructed jets by comparison with true jets, formed by
applying the same jet algorithm to stable particles in Monte-Carlo data. This tool can be used
for evaluating the energy response after the calibration and detector corrections. In order to
consider a reconstructed and a true jet as generated by the same parton, a geometrical matching
is performed - if the   distance between the two jets is below a cut value specified by the
user, the jets will be considered matched. If two jets are matched, their energies Ereco and Etrue
will be compared as a ratio in the response plot. A gaussian fit of the reconstructed energies of
matched jets in a given phase space bin gives a mean value and spread for the reconstructed
energy that is entered in the resolution plot.

B.3.2. Use case: jet energy scale uncertainty in ATLAS
It is through the JetPerformance software, and the underlying DFG based framework, that
the first estimate of the uncertainty on the jet energy scale for ATLAS has been derived [124].
This analysis fully exploited the flexibility of the software: The estimate of the jet response,
performed in a similar manner as outlined above, needed to be repeated with the same cut flow
for a number of Monte Carlo simulated samples with systematic variations applied in order to
estimate the effects of those variations on the jet energy calibration.

Appendix D.
First estimate of the JES uncertainty
(June 2010)
This appendix describes the first estimate of the JES uncertainty used in early 2010 analyses
(presented at the ICHEP international conference in July 2010), as in Reference [124]. It follows
the structure of Chapter 5, and only the relevant differences with respect to the JES uncertainty
analysis for the whole 2010 dataset are mentioned.
The first JES uncertainty is largely based on Monte Carlo studies, employing the di-jet
balance method only to evaluate the JES uncertainty in the endcap region. The calorimeter
contribution to the JES uncertainty is verified with a method that propagates to the jets the
uncertainties on the single energy deposits from in-situ and test beam measurements. The
energy contribution of multiple proton-proton interactions to calorimeter jets is not accounted
for in the JES calibration; it is included as a separate contribution to the systematic uncertainty.
D.1. Analysis details
The first estimate of the JES uncertainty is provided for jets with transverse momentum greater
than 20 GeV and pseudo-rapidity smaller than 2.8, following the binning reported in Table 5.1.
The JES systematic uncertainty for all jets with pseudorapidity beyond  = 1.2 in the first
estimate is determined using the JES uncertainty for the central barrel region (0.3 < || < 0.8)
as a baseline, and adding a contribution from the relative calibration of the jets with respect to
the central barrel region.
The nominal and systematic Monte Carlo samples used for the analysis of the JES uncertainty
have been generated and simulated as described in Section 1.4.2, but use a set of parameters
tuned to experimental data taken before the start of the LHC denoted with MC09. These
parameters are described in Reference [132].
D.1.1. Jet calibration for the first 17 nb1 of ATLAS data
In the very first ATLAS data up to Summer 2010 (roughly 17 nb1), only the global energy
correction step of the calibration described in Chapter 3 is applied. In this case, the jet
energy response is determined as a function of jet ptruthT and . Instead of using the average
reconstructed jet p
jet,EM
T for each p
truth
T bin, an inversion technique [126] is used to transform
the dependence of the jet response from a function of the truth jet energy to a function of
the reconstructed jet energy at the EM-scale, to ensure that the calibration depends solely on
reconstructed quantities and can therefore be applied on data. In the first 17 nb1, the peak
number of reconstructed vertices varied between ranges from 0.5 to 2.1, as shown in Figure 2.2,
compared to the maximum value of 3-4 for the latter data periods. As described in Section 5.3,
the additional energy due to multiple interactions is not been taken into account in the jet
energy scale and a pile-up induced systematic uncertainty is provided instead. The ATHENA
jet software only retains jets with a calibrated p
T above 7 GeV in the standard data format.
D.1.2. Selection of jets for systematic studies in Monte Carlo studies
The jet selection for the Monte Carlo studies for the first estimate of the JES uncertainty follows
that of Section 5.1.1, but does not include any isolation criteria: the uncertainty had been
provided for inclusive QCD jets. Additional studies on jet flavour composition, response and
topology that differ with respect to what was used in the derivation of the JES corrections and
on the estimate of the JES uncertainty were left to the individual analysis.
D.2. Sources of jet energy scale uncertainty
Five broad uncertainty categories have been used to characterize the components of the first
estimate of the JES uncertainty.
1. the uncertainty due to the JES calibration method is described in Section D.2.1;
2. the uncertainty due to the calorimeter response and to the simulation of the material
budget (Section D.2.2);
3. the uncertainty due to the detector simulation (Section D.2.3);
4. the uncertainty due to the physics model and parameters employed in the Monte Carlo
event generator (Section D.2.4);
5. the uncertainty due to the relative calibration for jets with  > 1.2 (Section D.2.5).
The relevant differences with respect to the estimates in Section 5.2 are detailed in the
following Sections.
D.2.1. Uncertainty due to the JES calibration
The deviation from unity of the average jet response after the simple EM+JES calibration
described in Section D.1.1 in the same sample where the calibration constants were derived is
considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. In addition to the motivations reported in
Section 5.2.1, the jet selection does not reflect that used to derive the calibration constant due
to the absence of a jet isolation cut. The lower response of close-by jets is therefore partly taken
into account in the non-closure uncertainty component.
Figure D.1 shows the jet response for pT and energy as a function of p
T for the nominal
Monte Carlo sample in the barrel and endcap regions. The systematic uncertainty due to the
non-closure of the nominal JES calibration is taken as the largest deviation of the response from
unity between energy and pT . In the barrel region 0.3 < || < 0.8 this contribution amounts to
about 2% at low p
T and smaller than 1% for p
T > 50 GeV. In the endcap region, the closure is
better than 1% for p
T > 20 GeV, while the energy response is within 1% for jets with transverse
momentum above 30 GeV.

The non-closure uncertainty was conservatively considered fully correlated to the other
components in the first JES uncertainty analysis and added linearly to the other uncertainty
components.
D.2.2. Calorimeter response and dead material uncertainty
In the first JES uncertainty analysis, the uncertainty on the calorimeter response was derived
using Monte Carlo simulation samples. The calorimeter response uncertainty estimated using
the single particle analysis was available, but it was only used as a cross-check.
The uncertainties on the single particle response used to cross-check the calorimeter component
for the first JES analysis differ from those detailed in Section 5.2.2 in the following:
 The uncertainty on the response of neutral hadrons was conservatively estimated to
amount to an additional 20% uncertainty on top of the uncertainty for charged particles is
considered.
 The absolute electromagnetic scale of the Liquid Argon calorimeter does not benefit by
any in-situ calibration, and it amounts to 3% [76]. Similarly, the first analysis of the Tile
electromagnetic scale lead to an uncertainty of 4% [80].
The uncertainty sources related to the calorimeter response used in the first JES uncertainty
analysis are:
Uncertainties due to the hadronic shower model:The properties of the hadronic
showering of particles interacting in the calorimeter influence the shape and extent of the energy
deposits and therefore the jet energy scale. The contributions to the JES uncertainty from the
hadronic shower model are evaluated using the following Monte Carlo samples:
 QGSP the QGSP set of parameters for hadronic interactions in the detector simulated by
Geant4 follows the QGSP BERT details described in Section 2.6 and used in the nominal
simulation sample, but with the Bertini nucleon cascades not simulated.
 FTFP BERT the Quark Gluon String fragmentation model from the QGSP BERT is
substituted with the Fritiof model [182]. In this model, the low energy treatment of
quasi-elastic nucleon scattering and nuclear diffraction process is improved at low eneergies
with respect to the Quark Gluon String model.
ATLAS test-beam data for single pions with energies ranging from 2 to 180 GeV have been
compared to simulations using the two set of parameters for the description of hadronic showers
above. In this study, described in [90], the measured mean single pion response has been shown
to lie within these two descriptions. Below 2 GeV, QGSP BERT and FTFP BERT follow the
Bertini cascades model, while the QGSP follows the Low Energy Parameterized (LEP). Monte
Carlo simulations of single particles that make use of the QGSP BERT model and analysis of
isolated tracks matched to energy deposits [48] agree within 5%, while the LEP description
has a much lower response with respect to the Bertini model at low energies [86]. Therefore,
the choice of these two simulation samples provides a safe range for the uncertainty due to the
hadronic showering model over the whole pT range of particles in jets.
The Monte Carlo simulation confirms the expectations from the test beam results: the
FTFP BERT description predicts hadronic showers in the detector that are longer and narrower
than in the data, whereas the absence of Bertini cascades make the showers shorter. The effect
of the different hadronic shower models on the jet response is shown in figure D.2. A 4% lower
jet response is observed in the central (barrel) region when the nominal calibration, derived
using the QGSP BERT hadronic shower model, is applied to the QGSP hadronic shower model
sample. This difference is approximately independent of p
T . In the FTFP BERT shower model
sample, the jet response is between 2% and 4% higher than unity.

Uncertainties on the material budget in the simulation:
In the case of the first JES uncertainty estimate, no in-situ measurement that could constrain
the material budget uncertainty was used. Therefore, the contribution from additional inactive
material was entirely derived from Monte Carlo studies.
The distorted detector geometry used for the first JES uncertainty estimated includes:
 an extra 0.05 radiation length (X0) has been placed radially between the barrel pre-sampler
and the calorimeter itself (|| < 1.45);
 an extra 0.2 X0 of dead material has been placed radially in the cryostat before the
electromagnetic calorimeter (|| < 1.5), motivated by the largest possible change in the
material budget in test-beam measurements [72];
 an extra 0.2 X0 has been placed radially in the cryostat between the barrel of the
electromagnetic calorimeter and the hadronic calorimeter, motivated by the comparison of
900 GeV data to Monte Carlo;
 the density of the material of the barrel-endcap cryostat gap (covering the space between
electromagnetic barrel and electromagnetic/hadronic endcaps for 1 < || < 1.4 and in
front of the electromagnetic endcap up to || < 1.8) has been increased by a factor 1.5.
The uncertainty on the jet energy scale due to the the dead material description for the first
iteration of the JES uncertainty is shown in Figure D.4. The response in the dead material
sample shows a 2% downward shift on the jet response, almost independent of p
Uncertainties on the energy scale of the ATLAS calorimeter: As mentioned above,
the uncertainties on the absolute electromagnetic scale of the Liquid Argon and Tile calorimeters
amount respectively to 3% and 4%, flat in  and p
T . The Liquid Argon uncertainty is scaled
by the average jet energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a function of p
while the Tile uncertainty is scaled by the jet energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter. The
two uncertainties are finally combined to form the uncertainty on the absolute electromagnetic
energy scale.
Comparison of calorimeter uncertainty used in the first JES uncertainty estimate and
single particle calorimeter uncertainties
In the central calorimeter region (0 < || < 0.3 and 0.3 < || < 0.8), the convolution of the
response and uncertainty of single particles within a jet [48] can be used to obtain a cross check
for the Monte Carlo based estimate of the JES uncertainty contributions from the calorimeter
measurement.
The contributions to the calorimeter uncertainty used in the first JES uncertainty estimate
are combined as follows:
1. For each p
T bin in the pseudorapidity bin considered, the ratio between the response in the
Monte Carlo test sample with a systematic variation Rvar and the response in the nominal
sample Rnom is considered as a starting point for the estimate of the JES uncertainty. The
deviation of this ratio from unity is defined as JES(p
T , ). This maximum deviation
between the energy and pT response is retained for each bin.
2. The bin by bin contribution had. shower modelJES to the JES uncertainty is calculated for the

had. shower modelJES (p
T , ) = max(
JES (p

FTFP BERT
JES (p
T , )), (D.1)
3. The uncertainty due to additional material upstream the calorimeters is estimated using
the jet response in dedicated samples described in 5.2.3 in a way similar to the hadronic
shower model contribution.
4. The absolute electromagnetic energy scale contribution from the electromagnetic (3%) and
hadronic calorimeter (4%) is weighted by the average electromagnetic and hadronic energy
content for jets in a given pT ,  bin.
5. The three components mentioned above are added in quadrature to obtain the Monte Carlo
based estimate of the calorimeter response uncertainty used in the first JES uncertainty
estimate.
As explained in Section 5.2.3, single particle studies do not fully account for the uncertainty
due to additional material before the calorimeters. To allow a fair comparison between the
single particle and the Monte Carlo based estimates, the contribution of the Monte Carlo
additional material uncertainty is scaled by the simulated particle content of the jet in electrons,
photons and charged hadrons in the combined test beam and added to the estimate of the JES
uncertainty from single particle studies.
The calorimeter JES uncertainty derived from single particle studies is compared to the JES
uncertainty related to the calorimeter measurement derived from Monte Carlo studies in the
central region (up to || <0.8) in Figure D.3.
The estimate of the calorimeter-related JES uncertainty from Monte Carlo studies is 2-3%
higher with respect to the single particle studies. This can be explained by the conservative
choices made in the parameters of the Geant4 simulation used for the estimate of the hadronic
shower uncertainty in the Monte Carlo-based study. Furthermore, the uncertainty on the energy
deposits for particles below 20 GeV is estimated through E/p studies with
s = 7 TeV data in
the ATLAS detector: the uncertainty in this case is constrained by the in-situ study and the
overall uncertainty on jets composed by these particles is reduced with respect to the Monte
Carlo study.
D.2.3. Uncertainties due to the detector simulation
Calorimeter cell noise thresholds
In order to estimate the uncertainty due to discrepancies in the noise modelling between the
data and in the simulation that could affect jet reconstruction through the topocluster noise
thresholds, all topocluster thresholds in the simulation are shifted upwards and downwards
during jet reconstruction. A Monte Carlo sample has been reconstructed with signal-to-noise
thresholds for all topocluster seed and neighbor cells modified to be 10% higher and lower
than the respective nominal values of 4 and 2. Seed thresholds of 4.4 and 3.6 and neighbors
thresholds of 2.2 and 1.8 have been used. The 10% variation provides a conservative estimate of
the uncertainty on the noise description that takes into account the stability of the noise spread
in dedicated noise runs and the comparison of the noise distribution in data and Monte Carlo.
As shown in Figure D.4, the uncertainty from topoclusters thresholds contributed to the
largest and most non-linear contribution to the JES uncertainty, up to 4% at low p
T . In the
case of lowering the topocluster thresholds, the topoclusters will include more cells containing a
prevalence of noise; at low p
T jets are composed by a larger number of topoclusters so the

effect will be more prominent. Therefore in this region jets are more energetic with respect to
the nominal Monte Carlo sample which was used to derive the JES correction constants.
Beam spot
In the first 2010 data reprocessing, the calibration scheme did not include the correction to the
jet origin mentioned in Section 3.2.1. The jet reconstruction therefore uses (x, y, z) = (0,0,0)
(the centre of the detector and origin of the ATLAS coordinate system) as reference to calculate
the direction and pT of the input jet constituents. If the beam spot is shifted with respect to the
detector center, the origin of the jet could differ from the one assumed by the reconstruction,
and the jet pT could be biased as a consequence. Monte Carlo truth jets are not affected by this,
since the origin of their four-vectors are the simulated vertices. The jet energy scale could still
be affected by differences between the beam spot position with respect to the detector centre
between data and the nominal MC sample1, and this is taken into account as an additional source
of systematic uncertainty. The variation on the jet energy scale from differences in the beam
spot position between data and Monte Carlo simulation is evaluated using a sample generated
with a shifted beam-spot based on early LHC parameter estimates of (x, y, z) = (1.5,2.5,9)
mm. These parameters cover the shift in the current average coordinates observed from data
collected by ATLAS from LHC collisions: (x, y, z) = (0.4,0.62,1.3) mm.
Figure D.4 shows the individual effects of the shifted beam spot position on the jet p
response for the first estimate of the JES uncertainty, together with the effects of the dead
material description in the simulation, and the topocluster thresholds. The shifted beam spot
mostly affects the jet response at low p
T . For p
T > 30 GeV, the beam spot variation only
contributes less than 1% to the overall JES uncertainty.

D.2.4. Uncertainties due to the event modelling in the Monte Carlo
generators
The contributions to the JES uncertainty from the modelling of the fragmentation and underlying
event and other parameters of the Monte Carlo event generator are obtained using the following
Monte Carlo samples:
 Alpgen + Herwig + Jimmy: the combination of the Alpgen generator interfaced
to Herwig and Jimmy is used to test the effects of a different modelling of the hard

subprocess and soft processes. In the case of the JES uncertainty for the full 2010 dataset,
this configuration is tuned to pre-LHC collider data in a manner similar to the Pythia
MC09 tune.
 Pythia MC09 tune with Perugia fragmentation: this set of parameters for the
Pythia generator uses a different underlying-event model with respect to the nominal
sample. In this tune, the soft-QCD part is tuned using only minimum-bias data from the
Tevatron and CERN pp colliders [183].
 Pythia MC09 tune with Professor fragmentation: the set of parameters used
for the Pythiagenerator has been tuned to LEP data with the Professor software [184]
and differs from the nominal ATLAS MC09 tune in the shape and parameters of the
fragmentation function.
The effect on the jet response from the different sources of theoretical uncertainties is
shown in Figure D.5. The maximum deviation of the response from unity is observed for
Ejet/EMC particle jet in the Alpgen sample with a downward shift of about 4% for pT < 50GeV.
D.2.5. Endcap uncertainty due to relative calibration
In the first iteration of the JES uncertainty, the strategy used to estimate the JES uncertainty
in the endcap region (starting from || > 1.2 since dead material samples were available up to
that pseudorapidity) was to consider two sources of uncorrelated JES systematic uncertainties
from the eta intercalibration measurement from transverse momentum balance (Section 4.2.1):
 the difference between data and Monte Carlo in the relative energy scale (up to 2.4% for
jets in 2.1 < || < 2.8).
 the deviation from one of the relative energy scale in the data (up to 2% in 2.1 < || < 2.8).
The relative  inter-calibration uncertainty is determined for jets where the average p
T ) of
the two leading jets is between 50 GeV and 110 GeV and the resulting uncertainty is applied to
all p
T . This choice is made on the basis that this uncertainty includes jets from the lower p
considered in this study; for higher p
T than what is considered in the intercalibration study the
main sources of uncertainties had been shown to decrease. The dead material uncertainty is
also expected to decrease with increasing energy. Therefore this choice leads to a conservative
estimate of the uncertainty in the endcap region.
Figure D.6 shows the relative jet response measured in both data and simulation as a function
of jet || used for the first estimate of the JES uncertainty.
D.3. Uncertainty due to multiple interactions
Over the course of the first data taking period up to July 2010, the LHC beam intensity has
been increased and the size of the interaction region reduced in order to increase the LHC
luminosity. Therefore, even the very first LHC data is affected by in-time pile-up, albeit to a
reduced extent with respect to further data taking periods.

The offset correction described in Section 3.2.1 was not applied, but instead used as the basis
for estimating an uncertainty due to the additional energy from pile-up interactions affecting
the jet response.
The average impact of pile-up is considered as an additional source of systematic uncertainty
and it is estimated directly from data, assuming that all jets and events are affected equally
regardless of the number of primary vertices2. This provides an upper bound on the uncertainty
due to pile-up effects for this early data taking period, and is added to the baseline jet energy
scale uncertainty.
2This is motivated by the average fraction of events having only one additional primary vertex in the dataset
considered.

of interactions (Nvtx) is denoted as
A Nvtx () and it is evaluated counting the number of
reconstructed vertices Nvtx. It is measured from events selected by the calorimeter trigger as
follows:
 For events with N additional interactions the mean tower energy is measured as a function
of .
 The additional energy per tower and number of additional interactions is determined by
subtracting out the average tower energy for events with exactly one interaction from the
average tower energy for events with N additional interactions; for example, for a 2-vertex
event:
ET = ET (NPV = 2)ET (NPV = 1). (D.3)
This subtraction removes the contribution from the underlying event, which is not part of
the pile-up systematic uncertainty. Approximately the same ET is observed for ET (NPV =
3)ET (NPV = 2).
A() is the average number of towers in jets (Ntower), as a function of jet , and Npileup
is the average number of additional interactions, conservatively estimated as the mean value plus
one standard deviation of the distribution of the number of reconstructed additional primary
vertices (N = Nvtx  1):
Npileup = [N+RMS(N)]. (D.4)
The relative JES uncertainty is then obtained by a luminosity-weighted average of p
in each  region. Figure D.7 shows the estimated JES systematic uncertainty contribution from
pile-up as a function of p
T and for several  regions.

Figure D.7.:Relative JES systematic uncertainty from pile-up as a function of p
T in various  regions,
estimated as an average from all ATLAS runs up to May 17th, 2010.
The estimate of the pile-up relative systematic uncertainty using this method considers all
ATLAS runs up to May 17th, 2010, and corresponds to 7 nb1 of integrated luminosity. For
jets with 20 < p
T < 50 GeV, the pile-up relative systematic uncertainty is about 1% in the
barrel and 1 2% in the endcaps. For pjetT > 50 GeV, the pile-up uncertainty is only significant
for || > 2.1 and it is smaller than 1%.
D.4. Combination of JES uncertainty sources
The combination of the contributions described in section D.2 to form the first estimate of the
JES uncertainty follows the method outlined in Section 5.4. The two differences with respect to
that method are:
 Since th contributions to the JES uncertainty due to increasing or lowering the topocluster
noise thresholds are not fully independent, the largest deviation from either of the two
effects in each p
T bin is taken as the source of uncertainty. This is also the case for the
uncertainty due to the two hadronic shower models. Taking these as an example, the bin
by bin contribution had. shower modelJES to the JES uncertainty is calculated for the individual
deviations for the two different hadronic shower models (
JES and 
FTFP BERT
JES ) as in
Equation 2.
 The contribution from the deviation from unity of the JES closure test described in section
D.2.3 is conservatively considered fully correlated and added linearly.
 The absolute electromagnetic energy scale contribution from the electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter is weighted by the average electromagnetic and hadronic energy
content for jets in a given pT ,  bin and added in quadrature to the other JES(p
T , )
contributions.
 The  intercalibration contribution is estimated for each pseudorapidity bin in the endcap
region from the plot in figure D.6. It is considered flat over the whole p
T range, and
added in quadrature to the total JES uncertainty determined in the 0.3  ||  0.8 region
to estimate the JES uncertainty for jets with ||  1.2.
 At large pjetT , the number of events in the Monte Carlo samples becomes insufficient for an
estimate of the uncertainty. The uncertainty from the last p
T bin is then used, on the
grounds that at higher p
T the largest systematics (noise description, dead material) will
be reduced since the measured calorimeter energy is larger.
D.5. Results
Figures D.8 and D.9 show the final relative jet energy scale systematic uncertainty as a function
of jet p
T for the central an endcap regions in the case of no pile-up. Both the total uncertainty
(light blue area) and the individual contributions are shown, with statistical errors from the
fitting procedure if applicable. On the right hand side of the figures the plots for the final JES
uncertainty of Section 5.5 are shown, drawn using the same scale to show the improvement
achieved with the new estimate.
The relative JES uncertainty in the central region amounts to approximately 9.4% for jet
T < 60 GeV, and 7% for p
T > 60 GeV. The uncertainty is increased to up to 10% and
7.6% respectively for p
T < 60 GeV and p
T > 60 GeV in the endcap region, where the central
uncertainty is taken as a baseline and the uncertainty due to the relative calibration is added.
The dominant contributions to the uncertainty are those due to the detector geometry,
the noise description, and the hadronic shower model. Table D.1 presents a summary of the
maximum uncertainties in the different  regions for anti-kt jets with distance parameter of 0.6
and with p
T above 20 GeV and 60 GeV.
The same study has been repeated for anti-kt jets with distance parameter R = 0.4, and the
estimate of the relative JES uncertainty is comparable to that for anti-kt jets with R = 0.6,
albeit slightly smaller because of the reduced effect of the dead material variation and the
change in topocluster thresholds due to the smaller jet radius. The JES uncertainty for anti-kt
