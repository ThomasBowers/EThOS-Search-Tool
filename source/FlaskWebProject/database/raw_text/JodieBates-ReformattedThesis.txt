Abstract
Background. Zoonotic diseases can impart devastating consequences on social,
medical, ecological and economical levels. An important driver of zoonotic disease
is the pet trade; however, little is known about the presence of bacterial species
across publicly accessible surfaces within pet shops. Furthermore, the increasing
popularity of exotic pets can disproportionately affect some species over others; for
example, Python regius, colloquially known as the Ball Python, is the most traded
pet python species globally. The extent of the trade, along with the practice of
ranching, is potentially unsustainable. Aims/Objectives. This project aimed to i)
develop a DNA extraction method suitable for retrieving data from low-biomass
samples; ii) identify key bacterial zoonotic pathogens, referred to as target genera,
within the literature to provide a foundation for microbial community analysis; iii)
characterise bacterial communities associated with a range of surfaces - primarily
publicly accessible - within a pet shop; iv) characterise bacterial microbiota asso-
ciated with Python regius and feeder rodents within breeding farms in Africa; and
v) use the information gathered from the wider literature to infer the presence of
target genera within the pet shop and animal samples. Results. Phenol-chloroform
extraction was found to be the most sensitive DNA extraction method, with a limit
of detection of 28 cells. The systematic literature review found that: i) there were
research biases at the genus and animal level, with Salmonella and fish and birds
investigated the most respectively. Overall, nearly 10 % of genera isolated from the
pet shop samples were target genera. Samples clustered based on animal type, in-
ferring the presence of distinct animal-associated microbiomes. However, with one
exception, these relationships became less distinct when clustering the target gen-
era only. Multiple target genera were present across at least half of the samples, in
addition to those accounting for more than 1 % of the sequencing reads. Finally, all
of the sample types from Python regius and feeder rodents contained target genera,
although feeder rodents contained a greater number of target genera for oral and
rectal samples relative to the corresponding snake samples. Summary. The results
are indicative of the presence of multiple potentially pathogenic genera within pet
shops and the key animal species. More research is required using techniques ca-
pable of identification at the species and strain level to confirm the pathogenicity
potential.

I remember, as an undergraduate, thinking that a PhD was impossibly out of reach
for me. The main reason for this was my experience within my third year project,
where both my project supervisor and the postdoc assigned to look over me made
me feel like I was a burden to them. Subsequently, I hated the lab work and could
not imagine why someone would want to spend three plus years doing it. A year
in an industrial food processing lab led me to reconsider research as a career route,
and I am so glad I did. I completed a Masters by research at Lancaster University
loved the independence and excitement that gave me. Fast forward a few years,
and the ideal PhD project presented itself in the form of a certain Dr Megson invit-
ing me for interview The subject matter terrified me and excited me in equal parts.
I knew that studying zoonotic pathogens from other countries would be a chal-
lenge for my anxiety, but I had this amazing feeling about the project, so I went
for it anyway. Ill never forget the adrenaline rush I got when receiving the news
that I had been selected (in the middle of a screening of the Jumanji remake at the
cinema). From that point it was all go. I hit the ground running with the leading
and organisation and leading of a training workshop for World Animal Protection,
my industrial partner, within a month from starting. And the first year presented
many fieldwork obstacles and organisational challenges, but we got there eventu-
ally through working together as a team. The sampling from Togo would not have
been possible without Neil, my industrial supervisor, who has an impressive net-
work of colleagues and made it possible for sampling to go ahead via Delphine
Ronfot. Not to mention that time that Jenny flew to Germany to pick up some
samples that got stuck there There isnt a great deal I could say about my PhD
experience in general that wouldnt be a clich. There have been ups and downs,
and it has made me a more resilient person. However, the people I have been so
privileged to work with have brought uniqueness to my experience. All my su-
pervisors have been fantastic and have contributed in their own ways, but as my
principle supervisor, Dave has been my right hand man. He has been a constant
support and sounding board. I suffer with extreme anxiety and Dave not only
guided me through the triggers that arose during my project, he taught me ways
of thinking that will stay with me forever. I could not have wished for a better
mentor. My biggest fear is that I will never again be so fortunate to work alongside
such a supportive colleague. It would also be remiss of me to write this section
without mentioning Dr Damian Rivett, who passed down so much lab knowledge
and whom without I would probably remain dispensing tiny glass beads into tubes
to this day. More importantly, he facilitated my introduction to the magical world
of R, which has had such a profound impact on me that I am now pursuing a career
change in the form of Data Science My experience would also not have been the
same without the fantastic technical staff - what would a start to the day be with-
out some Gill and Paul banter, or acquiring a shirt-based nickname from Stu? I
will also be eternally grateful to both lab Daves and Sue for allowing me to take
over their lab on second floor - it was my safe space, and the best months of my
PhD were spent there. Writing my thesis through a global pandemic has been re-
ally challenging, but I think some of that came from subconsciously not wanting
this to end. Its been the most transformative period of my life, and I will not be
leaving as the same person that embarked on this adventure. Finally, thank you
so much to my wonderful husband for being by my side throughout all of the en-
ergy extractions (my term for DNA extractions) and swearing at R code and LaTeX
templates.

Introduction
Overview
The global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which began in 2019, has been a
stark reminder of the health, societal and economic impacts imparted by zoonotic
disease. The pandemic has illustrated that despite the far-reaching consequences of
ill-management of zoonotic disease, a greater awareness of this area is warranted.
Although the origin for 2019-nCoV - the virus behind COVID-19 - has yet to be
fully determined, it has been proposed that a wildlife market that took place in the
epicenter of the pandemic could be responsible (Callaway and Cyranoski, 2020).
Following on from this, snakes are among some of the proposed intermediate host
species that enabled spillover to humans, although this is a much debated topic
(Callaway and Cyranoski, 2020). This project addresses the role of the exotic pet
trade in the potential dissemination of zoonotic disease by characterising bacterial
communities associated with key species in addition to the pet shop environment.
The techniques employed within this project lay the foundation for more focused
research through exploration at the bacterial community level.
Chapter 1. Introduction 2
1.1 Zoonotic Pathogens
1.1.1 Introduction
Zoonotic pathogens are capable of infecting humans and animals, a trait that has
been identified as a factor for heightened potential for disease emergence or re-
emergence (Christou, 2011; Taylor, Latham, and Mark, 2001; Cantas and Suer,
2014). The number of zoonotic pathogens is estimated to exceed 900 (Cantas and
Suer, 2014); these can be grouped in accordance with their biological classification
as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminths or fungi. This project focuses on bacterial
zoonotic pathogens; therefore, going forward, only this subdivision will be dis-
cussed. Bacteria were chosen for a variety of reasons, including i) the fact that the
main reptile-associated zoonoses - which are most relevant to the key species - are
caused by bacteria (Care and Committee, 2016); ii) the progression of antimicro-
bial resistance within bacteria contributes to the morbidity and mortality of bacte-
rial zoonotic infections (Angulo, Nunnery, and Bair, 2004); iii) there is insufficient
awareness, surveillance and reporting of multiple bacterial zoonotic pathogens;
and iv) the universal presence of the 16S rRNA gene within bacteria makes them a
good candidate for comprehensive community characterisation (Hugerth and An-
dersson, 2017).
Regardless of classification, all zoonoses present public health burden, causing mil-
lions of deaths per year (Karesh et al., 2012), in addition to having detrimental
effects on biodiversity via habitat destruction and invasion of new hosts; there are
therefore health, ecological, environmental and economic consequences of zoonotic
disease (Slingenbergh et al., 2004). Although the economic impact of zoonotic dis-
ease is widely appreciated, the global nature of the pandemic amplifies this. It has
been speculated that a return to pre-covid global economy may not be achieved
until 4 years from the commencement of the pandemic (Harari and Keep, 2021).
1.1.2 Drivers of Zoonotic Disease and Transmission Routes
Several human-driven causal factors have been implicated in zoonotic pathogen
emergence, re-emergence and spread. Changes to global travel and trade, leisure
Chapter 1. Introduction 3
activities, agriculture, land use and relationships with animals are examples of
drivers for zoonotic disease (Overgaauw et al., 2020; Liverani et al., 2013; Bengis et
al., 2004; Voyles et al., 2015; Karesh et al., 2012; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Can, DCruze,
and Macdonald, 2018). Global trade and relationships with animals are the drivers
most relevant to this project. The capacity for animals to be shipped worldwide has
altered the horizons in the pet industry; therefore, the importance of determining
the zoonotic risks presented by the pet trade cannot be underestimated. Knowl-
edge of the risks, and subsequent mitigation through informed policy decisions,
could be the difference between establishment of an emerging infectious disease
(EID) and subsequent enzootic status within new areas, or being contained - and
therefore managed - as much as possible.
Transmission of a zoonotic pathogen may occur via injuries that break the skin
(such as bites and scratches), vectors (e.g. ticks) and inhalation or absorption of
disease agents, via aerosols or animal bodily fluids respectively (Stull, Brophy, and
Weese, 2015). The impact that these have on risk of disease transmission in the pet
shop environment will be explored within Chapter 3, in addition to identification of
individuals most at risk from zoonotic infections and the impact of these infections,
discussed in the following section.
1.2 Companion Animals and Zoonotic Disease
The UK is among the top pet-ownership countries, which is reflected in the 12 mil-
lion UK households reported to own pets in 2020 (Hui Gan et al., 2020; PMFA,
N.D.). Pet ownership has increased over time; over the past five decades, popula-
tions of some UK pets have grown by up to 76 % (PMFA, N.D.). This trend may be
a result of studies proclaiming the numerous physical, emotional, social and men-
tal health benefits of pet ownership across all ages (Ng et al., 2021; Hui Gan et al.,
2020; Stull, Brophy, and Weese, 2015).
Following on from this, there is also a proportional increase in the popularity of so-
called exotic pets, such as reptiles (Corrente et al., 2017). The effectiveness of control
measures targeted at mitigating pet-associated zoonotic health risks depends on
Chapter 1. Introduction 4
the level of awareness of medical professionals, the public and veterinarians (Stull,
Brophy, and Weese, 2015). The impact of pet-associated zoonotic diseases arising
from the pet shop environment is investigated within Chapter 3 of this thesis via a
systematic literature review. The information gained from the review will be used
as a foundation for the analysis of sequencing data corresponding to a collection of
pet shop samples.
1.3 Molecular Techniques: 16S Amplicon Sequencing
Whereas in the past, studies into bacteria and their communities were restricted
to traditional culture-based methods, there is now a wealth of molecular tech-
niques available to researchers in the field of microbiology (Zhu and Al-Moniee,
2017). Nucleic acids are the basis for these techniques, affording researchers higher
sensitivity in relation to traditional culture-based methods as they do not require
organism-specific growth conditions, giving them the potential to detect entire mi-
crobial communities using a universal approach (Adzitey, Huda, and Ali, 2013).
Over time, accessibility of sequencing has increased as the cost of the sequencers
themselves, along with the repertoire of techniques that can be applied to these,
have decreased and expanded respectively (Janda and Abbott, 2007; Caporaso et
al., 2011; Caporaso et al., 2012). The technique used in this work is 16S ampli-
con sequencing, a high-throughput assay that enables characterisation of bacterial
communities through targeting of the bacterial housekeeping gene, 16S rRNA (Ca-
poraso et al., 2011) (Fig. 1.1). This gene encodes the 30S small subunit (SSU) of
the bacterial ribosome and is almost universally present across the majority of bac-
teria, enabling taxonomy assignment for most isolates (Fadrosh et al., 2014; Janda
and Abbott, 2007). Up to three of the nine hypervariable regions of this gene may
be targeted using amplicon sequencing (Johnson et al., 2019). The regions chosen
depend on the bacteria that are likely to be in the sample, since the different regions
vary in their ability to distinguish between certain taxonomic groups (Chakravorty
et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2019). The primers used in this project target the V4
region of the 16S rRNA gene. They were designed through the Earth Microbiome
Project (EMP), which was founded in 2010, and has resulted in the synthesis of
Chapter 1. Introduction 5
a database containing in excess of 100, 000 amplicon datasets that were acquired
using a standardised protocol (Gilbert, Jansson, and Knight, 2018).

1.3.1 Limitations of 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing
Although there are many strengths of amplicon sequencing, there are also limita-
tions that must be considered. The characteristics that make the 16S rRNA gene an
excellent candidate as a marker gene also impinge its capability to offer high tax-
onomic resolution; the conserved nature of the gene translates to high homology,
with high inter- and intra-species sequence similarity (Osawa et al., 2015). This is-
sue is compounded by the fact that amplicon sequencing targets only part of the
gene, further reducing the likelihood of detecting base differences within the short
sequence reads generated (Bulman et al., 2018; Osawa et al., 2015). This was il-
lustrated within the study by Gupta et al., (2019), which showed that when solely
using the V4 region, it was not possible to discern between Staphylococcus epider-
midis and Staphylococcus aureus because the sequence was identical for both species.
Consequently, the justification of amplicon sequencing has come under scrutiny
with the advancement of third generation sequencing technologies capable of se-
quencing the entire 16S rRNA gene (Johnson et al., 2019).
Despite these criticisms, the benefits of amplicon sequencing over traditional cul-
ture methods (TCMs) remain unchanged. These were illustrated by a study that
compared the performance of these two approaches for bacterial community char-
acterisation of faecal and hypopharyngeal samples (Gupta et al., 2019). Amplicon
sequencing was able to identify significantly more species per sample than TCM,
with the maximum number of species identified from a sample using amplicon
sequencing 17.5-fold higher than the equivalent value for TCM. The secondary se-
quencing analysis consisted of creating a non-redundant reference database for the
Chapter 1. Introduction 6
purpose of closed-reference OTU picking. This was performed by using the type-
strain sequencing, acquired from the RDP database, for all species that had been
cultured in the study. Even with this system, amplicon sequencing displayed sig-
nificantly higher sensitivity than TCM. The latter were shown to be biased towards
species with a high relative abundance.
With the above limitations in mind, caveats will be applied to the results obtained
in this project accordingly. The primary caveat is that the sequencing data will not
be used to assign species identification to the amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs).
Instead, presumptive genera will be assigned, with the understanding that these
have not been confirmed. Rather than overtly identifying bacterial pathogens, the
aim of this work is to obtain a broad insight into the bacterial microbiota associated
with key species and environments, setting the foundation for more focused and
targeted identification of bacteria at the species level.
1.4 Target Species
1.4.1 Python regius
The primary species of interest to this project is Python regius, a species of python
commonly referred to as Ball Python or Royal Python (Cope et al., 2014; Ayin-
mode et al., 2010). Python regius is a popular pet choice due to its docile temper-
ament and desirable physiological characteristics (Cope et al., 2014). As a result,
Python regius represent both the most heavily traded pet python species globally
along with Africas most exported live species (DCruze et al., 2020b; DCruze et
al., 2020; Auliya et al., 2020).
Chapter 1. Introduction 7
FIGURE 1.2: Python regius. Image free for commercial use with no
attribution necessary.
Python regius are one of nearly a thousand reptile species that are protected by the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (CITES, 2019).
Under the CITES classification system, species are assigned to one of three ap-
pendix levels, in accordance with the extinction threat imposed by international
trade. Python regius is an Appendix II species, meaning that the levels of trade of
these species has the potential to present future extinction threats in the absence of
appropriate levels of control (CITES, N.D.).
Trade of Python regius has historically taken place almost exclusively from Africa
(Luiselli et al., 2012; CITES, 2015). With previous average annual export figures of
160, 000 Ball Pythons globally, it represents the most frequently traded live species
within the legal trade sector in Africa (Waller et al., 2006). Over half of live reptile
exports from Togo between 1978 and 2017 were Python regius, amounting to around
one million individuals (DCruze et al., 2020b). Investigation into the import and
export figures, in conjunction with annual trade quotas for Togo, revealed that the
number of exports was frequently underestimated by Togo, and regularly exceed
quotas (DCruze et al., 2020b).

criteria of year range: 2018 - 2018, all countries, sources, purposes,
terms and Python regius.
By visualising information on the global trade of Ball Pythons during 2013, it is
clear that although there are a variety of trade routes, the most significant of these
is held between West Africa and the USA (Fig. 1.3). The significance of the trade is
further reflected by its CITES status (Appendix II)(CITES, n.d.). For these reasons,
it is therefore a good candidate species for the investigation of the zoonotic risks
posed by the exotic pet trade.
1.4.2 Feeder Rodents
In addition to Python regius, the associated feeder mice are a target species within
this project. This is due to documented zoonotic implications of this animal group
within the literature, including several multi-state and even international Salmonella
outbreaks that occurred over a short period of time (2006 - 2010) (Fuller et al., 2008;
Cartwright et al., 2016; Swanson et al., 2007). These outbreaks varied in geograph-
ical disease incidence, with the most severe affecting 17 states and more than 500

zoonotic pathogens associated with the pet shop environment
4. Characterise pet shop-associated bacterial communities from swab samples
and determine the presence of genera identified from the corresponding sys-
tematic literature review
5. Characterise bacterial communities associated with:
(a) Different body sites belonging to ball pythons and feeder rodents, across:
i. Different farms
ii. Different points in the breeding season

Method Development and
Validation
Chapter Overview
This chapter details the method development and optimisation experiments that
were necessary to conduct prior to sample processing. It includes a series of exper-
iments that were designed with the intention to: i) first determine the feasibility of
DNA extraction on low-abundance swab samples, in addition to the optimal DNA
extraction method, via limit of detection experiments for manual solvent-based and
commercial kit extraction; before ii) progressing to determine amplifiability of dif-
ferent sample types in PCR assays, using swab samples taken from the premises;
and finally iii) optimising both PCR assays used in the 2-step 16S library prepara-
tion (Illumina, N.D.).
2.1 Introduction
2.1.1 Impact of contamination on Low-Abundance Samples
The increased popularity of highly sensitive molecular techniques has been accom-
panied by counter studies cautioning interpretation of results, with particular em-
phasis on studies featuring low microbial biomass samples, such as those within
this project, which present multiple challenges (Barton et al., 2006; Eisenhofer et al.,
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 11
2019; Lauder et al., 2016; Douglas et al., 2020). The primary concern with this sam-
ple type is the challenge of discerning between DNA genuinely originating from
the sample, as opposed to that introduced via contamination (Lauder et al., 2016;
Eisenhofer et al., 2019), which may be mistakenly reported as a novel finding. Al-
ternatively, contaminants introduced temporally could lead to false conclusions if
they coincide with the processing of separate sample groups (Fig. 2.1). Discerning
the origin of DNA in these samples is hindered by the signal-to-noise ratio, which
is more pronounced in low-biomass samples compared to high-biomass counter-
parts. This was showcased in a study specifically addressing the differential impact
of contamination relative to input target concentration. A strong negative correla-
tion between sample biomass as proportion of target sequences was clearly demon-
strated, while the inverse was true for proportion of contaminant taxa (Salter et al.,
2014). The challenge of interpreting sequencing data from low-biomass samples is
further confounded in samples that are likely to contain genera frequently identi-
fied as contaminants.

FIGURE 2.1: The influence of contaminant DNA on principle com-
ponents analysis (PCA). Both low-biomass samples contain the
same DNA, however the contaminant DNA is different for both
samples, leading to false conclusions regarding sample community
composition. Note. Reprinted from "Contamination in Low Micro-

Weyrich, L. S. (2019), Trends in microbiology, 27(2), p. 109.
The extent of contamination could be influenced by the DNA extraction technique
applied. Whilst the probability of introducing exogenous contamination is increased
by techniques that feature multiple steps, such as phenol-chloroform (Kramvis,
Bukofzer, and Kew, 1996), kit contamination is also a recognised phenomenon
(Salter et al., 2014; Eisenhofer et al., 2019; Lauder et al., 2016; Glassing et al., 2016).
Contamination of reagents is not only widespread, but also a challenge to remove,
despite multiple approaches having been investigated (Glassing et al., 2016). These
include physical and chemical treatments, such as UV irradiation and application
of enzymes - including DNAse and restriction endonucleases - respectively. How-
ever, in addition to limited success, the application of treatments designed to re-
duce contaminating DNA can interfere with downstream processes, such as PCR,
negatively impacting the results in a different way. Subsequently, the importance
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 13
of including negative controls at every step in the sequencing pipeline cannot be
overstated. Despite this, contamination limitation, acknowledgement and subse-
quent processing are not always addressed in research papers (Eisenhofer et al.,
2019; Douglas et al., 2020).
2.1.2 DNA Extraction Method
DNA can be extracted from samples either using a solvent- or column-based ap-
proach, as with traditional extraction and modern commercial kits respectively
(Tan and Yiap, 2009). In either case, the principles are the same: cell lysis, DNA pu-
rification through the removal of other cell components (e.g. proteins) and isolation
of the DNA (Tan and Yiap, 2009; Butler, 2011; Douglas et al., 2020). The approach
chosen should be given careful consideration when handling low-abundance sam-
ples, since this can have a significant impact on DNA purity, yield and sequencing
outputs (Douglas et al., 2020). This was illustrated by (Douglas et al., 2020), who
compared five DNA extraction approaches on mock bacterial communities. These
consisted of three different commercial DNA extraction kits, one of the kits in com-
bination with bead-beating and traditional phenol-chloroform extraction.

Both DNA yield and purity were affected to a statistically significant level by DNA
extraction method (Fig. 2.2), with the highest DNA concentrations achieved by
phenol-chloroform. By maximising the yield, the impact of background noise is
reduced, as demonstrated by the subsequent negative correlation between DNA
yield and spurious sequencing results (Douglas et al., 2020). The knock-on effect
of higher starting DNA concentrations was a higher qPCR output (Douglas et al.,
2020), since PCR is logarithmic and therefore scales accordingly.
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 15
Although the core fundamental aims across DNA extraction techniques are the
same, there are multiple cell lysis approaches; these can be categorized as chem-
ical, mechanical or physical (Tan and Yiap, 2009; Fujimoto, Nakagami, and Kojima,
2004). Methods that only use one type of lysis method may be at a disadvantage,
due to the non-uniform effectiveness of lysis across bacterial species. It is therefore
advisable to include multiple lysis approaches in a DNA extraction protocol (Gill
et al., 2016), thereby reducing subsequent bias that could otherwise be introduced
during this step.
2.1.3 Amplifiability of DNA
In theory, only one copy of DNA is required for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
to take place. However, in practice, this is not the case. For example, 32 copies
per microlitre was the limit of detection for standard PCR in a study targeting a
gene from Bacteroides fragilis (Purcell et al., 2016). Subsequently, some sources rec-
ommend relatively high copy numbers for optimal results, starting at 1000 copies
(Lorenz, 2012). This is mainly due to the fact that spurious results may occur
at lower template concentrations. This is especially important where universal
primers, such as those targeting part of the 16S rRNA gene within this project,
are used (Yang and Rothman, 2004); a greater template concentration is more likely
to produce target amplicons outweighing any erogenous sequences resulting from
contamination (Eisenhofer et al., 2019). Furthermore, sample type can influence
how successful subsequent PCR reactions are, since the PCR inhibitors may vary
accordingly.
2.2 Materials and Methods
Overview
Limit of detection (LoD) experiments were conducted to determine the most appro-
priate DNA extraction approach for the sample type in this study (i.e. low biomass
swab samples) following the workflow in Fig. 2.3. The two extraction methods as-
sessed were 1) kit extraction using the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit (QIAGEN)
and 2) a solvent-based extraction using phenol-chloroform.

ods to be assessed under Step 1 were phenol-chloroform and a com-
mercial DNA extraction kit.
The LoD was determined independently for each method using serial dilutions of
known concentrations of a bacterial suspension (Fig. 2.3, Step 1). The method able
to produce a visible band on an electrophoresis gel following PCR of the extracted
DNA for the lowest bacterial concentration would be selected (Fig. 2.3, Step 2).
Finally, application of the chosen method to intermediate environmental swab
samples was performed for validation of the suitability of the method (Fig. 2.3,
Step 3).
Following the limit of detection experiments, it was necessary to perform PCR op-
timisation using the polymerase that would be used for sequencing library prepa-
ration.
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 17
2.2.1 Negative Controls
Negative controls were included for all assays. These were no-template controls
and molecular biology grade water for DNA extractions and PCR reactions respec-
tively.
2.2.2 Limit of Detection Experiments using Phenol-Chloroform and DNeasy
UltraClean Microbial Kit
Culture Preparation
Overnight E. coli cultures (strain NCTC 11560) were prepared by suspending a
colony in 200 L of filter-sterilised phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and transferring
the resultant suspension into 10 ml nutrient broth. Incubation was shaking at 37C
overnight. To prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the overnight culture (OVNC), a
2 mL aliquot was centrifuged at 13, 500 x g for 5 min, in addition to a the PBS neg-
ative control. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 1.8 mL
fresh PBS, before repeating the centrifuge step once more. Seven 10-fold serial dilu-
tions (final volume 1.8 mL, the volume specified by the commercial extraction kit)
were performed, prior to processing with either the kit (DNeasy UltraClean Micro-
bial Kit, QIAGEN) or a modified phenol-chloroform extraction (Rogers et al., 2013).
Miles misra plates were performed in triplicate to allow enumeration.
DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit
The serial dilutions were prepared as described above and processed following kit
instructions. Briefly, this involved centrifuging the bacterial culture and discarding
the supernatant before processing manually (Appendix A). The only modification
made concerned the initial pelleting of bacterial suspension prior to discarding the
growth media; the conditions suggested by the kit did not result in a sufficiently
firm pellet. The duration of centrifugation was therefore increased from 30 S to 5
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 18
Phenol-Chloroform
This approach applied the prepared serial dilutions to swabs. Inoculation was per-
formed in triplicate by dispensing 50 L droplets of each serial dilution into a ster-
ile petri dish and swabbing for approximately 10 s, or until absorption occurred.
Swab heads were then transferred into individual sample tubes containing 600 L
DNA/RNA shield. Processing was performed using one of two approaches, in
which the experimental variable was the bead-beating step. This step was per-
formed either with the bead-beating tubes containing the swab tip (Method 1), or
in its absence (Method 2) (Fig. 2.4 ). For the latter method, sample tubes containing
the swab tip and DNA/RNA Shield were vortexed at maximum speed (approx. 3,
200 RPM) on the Vortex Genie for two 30 s bursts, prior to removal of the swab tip
and transferal of the DNA/RNA Shield to the bead-beating tube, where it was pro-
cessed using the same vortexing conditions as Method 1 (processed at maximum
speed on the Vortex Genie for two 30 s bursts).

2.2.3 PCR Amplification
Extracted DNA was amplified using the primers and thermocycler conditions spec-
ified in the Earth Microbiome Project (Caporaso et al., 2011) (Tables 2.1 & 2.2). PCR
reaction volume was 25 L, using Biomix (Bioline, London), which contained ev-
erything other than the template DNA, primers and water. PCR reactions were
conducted in either duplicate (kit) or triplicate (phenol-chloroform) for each se-
rial dilution. DNA concentration was initially quantified using the Nanodrop One
(ThermoFisher Scientific), before moving to the Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific) in
conjunction with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). For gel elec-
trophoresis, 20 L (out of 25 L) of each amplicon was run on a 1 % agarose gel
(TAE).

from a toilet. Swab heads were transferred into 2 mL screwcap centrifuge tubes
containing 600 mL DNA/RNA Shield shortly after collection and processed using
the phenol-chloroform method, prior to PCR amplification using the EMP primer
pair (Table 2.1).
Following on from this, samples were taken from a pet shop for the work in Chap-
ter 3. A subset of these samples, representing high, low-average and non-detectable
levels of DNA was processed as a final check that the methods had been fully opti-
mised.
2.2.5 Optimization of Amplicon PCR for 16S Library Preparation
For sequencing library preparation, the polymerase used in the limit of detection
experiments was replaced with the high-fidelity polymerase recommended by the
Illumina 16S Library Preparation Guide (Illumina, N.D.), 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart
ReadyMix (Roche, Germany). Gradient PCRs were conducted to determine the
optimal annealing temperature.
Gradient PCR Conditions
An initially broad gradient PCR was first conducted to determine the temperatures
closest to the optimal annealing temperature, followed by a more refined gradient
range accordingly (Table 2.3). The number of cycles was set to 30 for both.

DNeasy Commercial Extraction Kit
The last visible band for the kit LoD experiments corresponded to the 105 dilu-
tion (Fig. 2.5). Although it was not possible to determine the exact number of CFU
for each dilution due to contamination of the enumeration plates, previous con-
centrations of E. coli OVNC were in the order of magnitude of 108 - 109 CFU/ml;
therefore, the LoD was approximately 1.8 x 103 - 104 CFU.

Phenol-Chloroform
The LoD for phenol-chloroform differed depending on the bead-beating method
used. Bands could be seen for all six serial dilutions for Method 1, compared to
the first two dilutions for Method 2 (Fig. 2.6). No bands were present in either
of the negative controls, except for those corresponding to primer-dimers (lower
band). The initial bacterial concentration was retrospectively calculated to be 5.55
x 108 CFU/ml using the Miles Misra plates. The final concentration therefore cor-
responds to 5.55 x 102; however, since only 50 L of each dilution was used in the
extractions, this translates to a LoD of 28 cells (rounded to the nearest integer).

2.3.2 Intermediate Samples
Bands were visible for at least one replicate across all surface types of the interme-
diate samples (Fig. 2.7). This validated that the process was sensitive enough to
apply to sampling of comparable surfaces in the project.

Bands were also produced for the entire subset of the pet shop samples.
2.3.3 Optimization of Amplicon PCR for 16S Library Preparation
The results of the intial broad-gradient PCR were indicative that higher anneal-
ing temperatures produced optimal results (Fig. 2.8); this was in agreement with
the technical data sheet (KAPABIOSYSTEMS, 2019). Bands were visible starting at
53C, and increased in intensity with an increase in annealing temperature. Subse-
quently, the following gradient PCR focused on the higher end of the range (Fig.
2.9). However, although the same pattern was technically repeated, with the bright-
est band occuring at 71.3C, the bands for the second gradient PCR were not as
strong. As a result, two more independent PCR assays were conducted; one at
59C and the other at 71C. Reactions were carried out in triplicate and run on the
same gel as the amplicons from the narrow-gradient PCR for comparison (Fig. 2.9).
No bands could be seen for the 71C annealing temperature, compared to consis-
tent bands for 59C. This was therefore the chosen annealing temperature for all
subsequent 16S step 1 amplicon PCRs.

2.4 Discussion
2.4.1 Low-biomass Samples
Impact of Contamination
There are multiple routes and opportunities for contamination to occur from sam-
ple collection through to sequencing. Some studies have published guidelines on
how to minimise contamination when working with low-biomass samples, which
were taken into account (Eisenhofer et al., 2019). The following sections detail the
actions taken to mitigate the influence of contamination within the project.
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 26
Work was conducted within a class II safety cabinet where this was appropriate and
an available option, enabling sample and personal protection via the HEPA-filtered
air, in addition to superior two-pronged chemical and UV disinfection between
uses to minimise cross-contamination. The disinfectant used was Distel High Level
Medical Surface Disinfectant (Tristel Solutions Ltd, UK). The product specification
states that at a working concentration, Distel destroys DNA and RNA. Therefore,
the combined approach of using the two disinfection methods should greatly re-
duce exogenous contamination potential.
Regarding endogenous contamination, steps taken to address this include aliquot-
ing of reagents into smaller volumes (20 - 100 ml), frequent application of sterilisa-
tion procedures (such as autoclaving, filter-sterilisation and UV irradiation) where
appropriate and the inclusion of process controls. The effectiveness of the measures
taken is illustrated by the absence of bands in the gels produced in this chapter, for
which the samples were processed outside of the safety cabinet. Since ultrapure
water was shown to harbour sequences belonging to multiple contaminant taxa in
a previous study (Salter et al., 2014), in additional to using small aliquots of water
during sample processing, these aliquots were irradiated daily.
Interpretation of Results
The list of genera reported to be commonly classified as contaminants by Eisen-
hofer et al. (2019) is not restricted to genera known to contain many ubiquitously-
occurring species, such as Pseudomonas, but also those containing notable pathogenic
species, such as Staphylococci (Eisenhofer et al., 2019). This poses an additional
layer of challenges associated with analysing amplicon sequencing data. There-
fore, it is essential to maintain a balanced and standardised approach for how to
separate out potential contaminants in the data generated within this project.
This characteristic can be problematic when it comes to data analysis. This is be-
cause the impact of contamination is far greater in this sample type, compared to
high-biomass samples (Greathouse, Sinha, and Vogtmann, 2019), where the results
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 27
are less likely to be skewed as a result (Eisenhofer et al., 2019). This was show-
cased by the study performed by (Lauder et al., 2016), in which low-biomass sam-
ples (placental) were indistinguishable from the control samples, in contrast to the
high-biomass samples (oral and vaginal), which both possessed distinct composi-
tions independent of the controls.
2.4.2 DNA Extraction Method
The LoD experiments revealed that phenol-chloroform extraction was superior in
sensitivity compared to the extraction kit. Previous studies have drawn the same
conclusion (Douglas et al., 2020; Kramvis, Bukofzer, and Kew, 1996), reinforcing
the suitability of this approach. The lysis buffer used in this case was DNA/RNA
Shield. The exact formulation of this is unknown for commercial reasons; however,
it has been reported to inactivate a plethora of microorganisms, including Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Bead-beating was incorporated to
further reduce any lysis-derived bias, using 0.1 mm glass-silica beads, since smaller
bead diameters have previously been reported to be more effective at mechanical
cell lysis (Fujimoto, Nakagami, and Kojima, 2004). To ensure a standardised ap-
proach during the DNA extractions, the bead-beating tubes were prepared in ad-
vance: approximately 60 mg were dispensed into 2 mL screwcap microcentrifuge
tubes prior to autoclaving at 120C for 20 minutes. Tubes were thoroughly dried in
a drying cabinet and UV-irradiated for 30 minutes before use.
2.5 Conclusions
Challenges of the PhD project include low biomass samples and limitations on the
level of taxonomic resolution offered by the primary technique used (16S ampli-
con sequencing). Accordingly, a robust method for the isolation of amplifiable
DNA from low-biomass samples was developed through a series of experiments
and optimised accordingly. Limit of detection experiments confirmed the limit of
detection, which was calculated to be approximately 28 bacteria, to be appropriate
for low-biomass samples. The reliability of this method was proven twice - first
Chapter 2. Method Development and Validation 28
through successful application to multiple low-biomass samples taken from a va-
riety of surfaces, before moving on to a subset of the samples corresponding to
Chapter 3. The methods developed were able to successfully amplify DNA from
samples with an undetectable template DNA concentration, illustrating the high
performance of the DNA extraction and PCR amplification steps. Finally, the lim-
itations of 16S amplicon sequencing were respected by the avoidance of classifica-
tion to species level, along with acknowledgement that genus identities were puta-
tive. Subsequently, analyses or conclusions that were solely based on the identity
were either avoided or treated with caution.

Systematic Quantitative Literature
Review
3.1 Chapter Overview
This chapter consists of a systematic quantitative literature review, which was con-
ducted using previously developed methodology. There were two principle chap-
ter objectives: i) generation of a broad overview of the literature surrounding zoonotic
disease in relation to one of the environments later sampled within this project, pet
shops; and ii) compilation of a list of bacterial genera previously isolated in relation
to pet shops (the environment or animals within), to be used to inform the analysis
of the pet shop sample set featured in Chapter 4.
3.2 Introduction
The physical and mental benefits of owning a pet are accessible to people of all ages,
from children to older adults (Pickering et al., 2008; Hui Gan et al., 2020; Friedmann
and Son, 2009). This is reflected by the number of households that own a pet;
the figure was 85m for Europe and 12m in the UK in 2019 and 2020 respectively
(Industry, 2019; Association, 2020). Regarding the proportion of adults that possess
pets, the latest figure for the UK is 51 % (PDSA, 2020). Many of the most popular
pet types across Europe can be purchased at pet shops (Fig. 3.1), the number of
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 30
which has increased in response to the boom in popularity of pets (Jo and Kang,
2006).
FIGURE 3.1: Ranking of pet popularity in the UK (A, (PMFA, N.D.))
and Europe (B, (FEDIAF, 2019)).
Although cats and dogs remain the top two most abundant pet types across the
UK and Europe, exotic pets - including turtles, snakes and lizards - now fea-
ture among the most popular pet choices (Fig. 3.1, (PMFA, N.D.; FEDIAF, 2019)).
However, these introduce unique zoonotic health risks. Although there is grow-
ing recognition of reptile-associated salmonellosis, this knowledge does not extend
to feeder rodents; while these are also a source of Salmonella, 87 % of individuals
affected by an international feeder rodent-associated Salmonella outbreak were un-
aware of the association (Cartwright et al., 2016). Such incidences have prompted
recommendations for actions that can be taken to help mitigate the health risks
associated with animals and associated products, such as the inclusion of health
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 31
warnings on packaging and the supplying of information leaflets addressing zoonotic
health risks posed by pets and their food in pet stores (Cartwright et al., 2016).
Aside from the risks posed directly by animals themselves, what are the risks posed
indirectly by animals in the pet shop setting? A study conducted in Korea found
that a maximum of 2.04 x 103 CFU/m3 and 2.12 x 103 CFU/m3 viable bacteria
in indoor pet shop air during winter and summer respectively; this significantly
exceeds the recommended maximum value of 8 x 102 CFU/m3 specified by Korean
national guidelines (Jo and Kang, 2006). The primary aim of this chapter was to use
an established methodology to compile an in-depth literature review to close the
knowledge gap surrounding the zoonotic risks imposed by pet shop environmental
surfaces.
3.3 Materials and Methods
A systematic quantitative literature review was compiled based on previously de-
scribed methodology (Moher et al., 2009; Pickering and Byrne, 2014)(Fig. 3.2).
FIGURE 3.2: Steps to perform a systematic literature review, devel-
oped by Pickering & Byrne (2014).
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 32
Under the theme of bacterial zoonotic risks within the context of pet shops (Step 1),
the following research objectives were devised (Step 2):
1. What were the categories included in the final personal database?
2. What was the breadth of the existing literature?
3. What was the relative performance of the:
(a) databases
(b) search strings
4. What were the publication trends?
5. With regards to the case reports1:
(a) What was the etiological agent?
(b) What pet types2 are associated with the etiological agent?
(c) What were the patient3 demographics?
(d) What was the disease severity and outcome?
6. With regards to the research papers:
(a) What was the geographical spread of the research?
(b) Which pet types were studied?
(c) What bacterial genera were identified by the research?
(d) What was the associated pet type range for the isolated genera4?
(e) Which genera were most frequently isolated or identified by the research?
1case reports refer to short communications detailing an incident that involved one or more indi-
viduals acquiring a zoonosis. They were generally stated as being case reports.

Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 33
(f) Which of the isolated genera were present in the top two most researched
pet types, and what was the health status of the animals these genera
were isolated from?
To answer the above questions, the following key words were individually used in
conjunction with pet shop, using the Boolean operator AND: bacterial zoonoses,
bacterial zoonotic disease, zoonotic disease, infection risk, zoonotic potential,
associated bacteria, bacteria, zoonotic infection, bacterial infection and bac-
terial pathogen (Step 3). These search terms were applied in the PubMed, Sco-
pus and Web of Science databases (Step 4). All publications were downloaded per
search, per database. Duplicates were later removed using the program R (R Core
Team, 2020) in conjunction with the tidyverse package (Wickham et al., 2019a). The
papers were assessed in relation to the following exclusion criteria (Step 5): i) men-
tion of pet shop; ii) mention of bacteria and iii) the paper was a primary research
article. Papers were further excluded if they were not deemed appropriate on the
basis of the methods used or the research aims. A personal database was designed
to extract useful information from the remaining publications (Step 6). A subset of
the papers was processed using the database parameters (Step 7), to allow category
revision and refinement, before entering the rest of the papers (Step 9). Summary
tables were produced from the database to determine the appropriateness of the
categories (Step 10), with further categories added where necessary (Step 8). Once
satisfactory, progression onto the remaining steps in the pipeline outlined by Pick-
eringn & Byrne (2014) took place.
3.4 Results
This results section initially provides a broad overview of the performance of the
systematic literature review, addressing objectives 1 and 2, before honing in on the
data corresponding to case reports and research papers respectively. Information
was extracted from the case reports in line with objective 3 to ascertain the etiolog-
ical agents responsible, along with the associated pet types, patient demographics
and outcome. Multiple aspects of the research publications were characterised, in-
cluding the geographical breadth, pet types included and bacterial genera isolated

and identified. The presence of these genera was evaluated by noting which pet
types were the source of the isolated genera, in addition to quantifying the number
of research papers corresponding to each genus. Finally, the profile of genera asso-
ciated with the two most investigated pet types was investigated in more detail.
3.4.1 Database Categories
The constructed database had 25 categories in total. These corresponded with the
two publication types: research paper and case report. The common categories
consisted of Paper Title, Year (of publication), Access (full, abstract-only or for-
eign body), Journal, Geographical Location, Bacteria Mentioned, Bacteria Identified
Physically, Methods (of bacterial identification), Sample Number, Pet Shop Num-
ber, Recommendations, Associated Human Diseases, Study Type and Publication
Type. For the case studies, there were the additional categories of Number of In-
dividuals Affected, Patient Minimum Age, Patient Maximum Age, Patient Gender,
Patient Health, Transmission Route, Infection Outcome and Bacterial Source. The
only additional category for research papers was Diseased/Healthy (status of ani-
mals tested). The remaining steps were completed accordingly.
3.4.2 Systematic Review Performance
The search strings selected, in combination with the three databases, returned 458
publications (Fig. 3.3). Following processing, including duplicate removal and
application of inclusion criteria, 74 papers remained. A further 20 papers were dis-
carded for various reasons; for example, the paper Risk Factors of Leptospirosis
in Rice Cultivators as Compared to non Rice Cultivators in Punjab, Pakistan men-
tioned pet shops, featured a bacterial zoonotic pathogen and was original research;
however, the focus of the paper was irrelevant.

Publication Trends
Two main publication trends can be observed: the number of publications per year
regarding zoonotic disease in the context of pet shops has increased over time; and
there has been a shift from predominantly case reports to research papers (Fig. 3.6).

FIGURE 3.6: Publications by year and type.
Case reports were published between 1969 and 2016, while research papers were
published between 1976 and 2020, with the majority from 2000 onwards. The most
publications within a year was 3 and 6 for case reports and research papers re-
spectively (Fig. 3.6). Full publications were available for at least half of both the
case reports and research papers, although publications that were abstract-only or
had an English abstract but foreign body of text were present for case reports and
research papers (Fig. B.1, Appendix B).
3.4.3 Case Reports
Etiological Agents
Eight potential etiological agents were identified from 13 case reports published
between 1969 and 2016. One of the case reports did not involve any human casu-
alties, but a case of Salmonella infection of existing livestock via the introduction of
new livestock (Oros et al., 1998). From this point on, only case reports involving
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 39
human patients will be discussed. There were three diseases corresponding to the
etiological agents featured across the remaining 12 case reports: psittacosis (n = 8),
rat bite fever (RBF, n = 3) and leptospirosis (n = 1).
Animal Species Associated with Etiological Agents
The animal type attributed to Chlamydia, the causal agent of psittacosis, was almost
exclusively birds, with the only other animal species category, mixed, constituting
a minority. Streptobacillus moniliformis, the etiological agent corresponding to RBF
in these case reports, was solely associated with rats. Finally, it was not possible to
determine the animal species associated with the case of leptospirosis, as the case
involved a pet shop worker reporting long-term illness in the absence of a specific
event or injury (Finsterer et al., 2005).
Patient Demographics
There was insufficient information on gender and health of individuals prior to in-
fection to draw any solid conclusions regarding psittacosis, since over half of these
were abstract-only access, and those that were full access did not make reference to
prior health status. In the cases of RBF, the three individuals were all reported to be
in good health prior to infection. Finally, the individual infected with leptospirosis
reported a wide range of symptoms with varying timelines prior to medical inves-
tigation. These included vision impairment, respiratory infection, flu symptoms
and  sensitivity to light and noise, personality change, disturbed speech and short-
term memory, head-ache, easy fatiguability, and increased sleep along with en-
larged and painful lymph nodes, palpitations, exertional dyspnoea, and myalgia
(Finsterer et al., 2005). Case reports involving psittacosis and RBF involved a wide
age range of patients, spanning pre-teens to those in their late seventies and early
sixties respectively (Table 3.1). The sole individual reported to have leptospirosis
was 45 years of age (Table 3.1). Finally, the zoonosis to cause the most infections
was psittacosis, which outnumbered the cases reporting RBF and leptospirosis by
27-fold and 82-fold respectively (Table 3.1).

RBF 13 60 3
Leptospirosis 45 45 1
Disease Severity and Outcome
The outcomes were also investigated for each of the three zoonoses featured in
the case reports. A hallmark of psittacosis was respiratory infection, which was
reported as Pneumonia, Respiratory Infection, Lung Infiltration and Cough.
Whilst the majority of cases resolved with antibiotic treatment, more severe out-
comes were reported, including encephalitis and death, the latter also occurring
due to a case of RBF.
Hospital admission was a universal outcome for all case reports involving rat bite
fever (Legout et al., 2005; Downing, Dewnany, and Radford, 2001; Shvartsblat et
al., 2004). Although infection was enabled via compromised integrity of the skin
barrier, direct and indirect transmission occurred, via bites (in two of the cases) and
injury inflicted by the cage respectively. The disease progression varied on an in-
dividual patient basis, although there were commonalities. These include the incu-
bation period, which was universally less than a week, and the wound site, which
was the hand. Joint infection and symptoms of arthralgia also occurred in both the
60-year-old woman and 13-year-old boy. Whilst numerous joints were affected by
the former, impact was restricted to the right hip of the latter. Neither experienced
any cardiac abnormalities. The infection mimicked rheumatoid arthritis. Both pa-
tients received both intravenous and oral antibiotics over the course of a few weeks.
Conversely, the final patient - a 24-year-old male pet shop worker - died as a re-
sult of the infection. Prior to his death, a range of symptoms were experienced,
including fever, aches, chills, shoulder pain, vomiting and dyspnea (shortness of
breath). Unlike the other cases, hospitalisation did not occur until two weeks after
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 41
development of symptoms. Symptoms progressed into pulmonary edema, bacte-
rial endocarditis, hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and finally, multi-organ systems
failure. Throughout the course of the infection, the patient underwent multiple
hospital visits (including a transfer to enable access to specialist surgery), a range
of intravenous and oral antibiotics and two invasive surgical procedures.
Over the duration of infection in the leptospirosis case, the patient experienced a
range of pathologies. These responded well to antibiotic and conservative therapy
(Finsterer et al., 2005).
3.4.4 Research Papers
Geographical Distribution of Research
Research conforming to the criteria was conducted across 25 countries, spanning
five of the seven continents (Fig. 3.7). The country assigned to the most research
papers was Iran (n = 5), followed by Japan, Korea and Turkey, all of which were
assigned to four papers. Three publications did not state the geographical loca-
tion of the research, and the remainder of countries were assigned to two or less
publications.

Animals included in research papers
There were 12 animal categories in total (Fig. 3.8). Of these, fish were the most
commonly investigated pet species, accounting for 23.4 % of the research papers,
whilst the fruit bat, mixed and rabbit categories were joint least investigated, with
a single associated publication each.

all species, such as a study involving the sampling of 970 animals belonging to
various taxa (Seepersadsingh and Adesiyun, 2003).
Bacterial Pathogens Identified in Research

there is a corresponding over-estimate for number of publications in
these cases.
The top 10 most frequently identified genera were Salmonella, Escherichia, Aeromonas,
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 45
Citrobacter, Chlamydia, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Acinetobacter and
Edwardsiella. These genera represent enteric bacteria and bacteria known to be
ubiquitous within the environment. Three of these 10 genera were isolated from
a single pet type. Conversely, Salmonella was isolated from multiple pet types. Fo-
cus will now be given to those genera identified from the two most investigated
pet types, fish and birds.
Bacteria Isolated from Fish A range of bacterial genera were reported in fish;
however, those containing the most detected species were Mycobacterium, Salmonella,
Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Vibrio (Fig. 3.11).
A variety of laboratory methods were used in the fish studies. Stated sampling
duration ranged from 2 days to 2 years. Sampled fish were healthy, diseased or a
mixture of both.
Fifteen Mycobacterium fish-associated isolates were identified to the species level
within the literature (Fig. 3.11B). All of these species are capable of causing dis-
eases in humans, ranging from occasional infections in immunocompromised in-
dividuals to opportunistic infections regardless of immune status (Johnston, Chi-
ang, and Elwood, 2017; Hashish et al., 2018; Lazo-Vasquez and Gonzales-Zamora,
2020; Mastroianni, 2003). The two most prevalent Mycobacterium species isolated
from fish were Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium marinum, collectively
accounting for 26 % of reported mycobacteria identified to the species level. My-
cobacterium arupense, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium gordonae and Mycobac-
terium peregrinum each accounted for 8 % of reported mycobacteria identified to
the species level. Thirty-two % of studies involving fish reported identification of
the three NTM species predominantly implicated in fish mycobacteriosis: Mycobac-
terium fortuitum, Mycobacterium marinum and Muycobacterium chelonae (Hashish et
al., 2018).
The sampled fish were healthy, diseased or mixed populations of both. Although
many of the less-frequently identified genera were isolated from diseased fish, this
was not true for the other end of the spectrum (Fig. 3.12A). Of the Mycobacterium

ity of the sampled birds were healthy (Fig. 3.13).

3.5 Discussion
3.5.1 Overview
The results of this systematic review of the literature surrounding bacterial zoonotic
pathogens present in pet shops illustrate that research has been conducted across
a range of countries, targeting a variety of animals that may be sold in pet shops.
Increased awareness of the health risks posed by pet shops was reflected in the
overall publication trends, which encompassed an increased volume of publica-
tions per year over time, along with a shift from case reports to proactive research.
Whilst research has spanned most of the continents, areas that featured a lack of
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 49
research were Africa and South America - although this finding could be influ-
enced by the language barrier. Whilst the animal type responsible for the majority
of the case studies was birds, the animal type that featured the most across the re-
search papers was fish, with birds as the second most researched animal type. Re-
garding bacteria, the most-reported genera were predominantly enteric, including
Salmonella, Escherichia and Citrobacter, along with environmental genera (e.g. Pseu-
domonas) and skin commensals (e.g. Staphylococcus). Chlamydia was also among
the most prevalent genera, possibly due to a research bias in response to the nu-
merous case studies corresponding to this genus.
3.5.2 Case Reports
In the context of pet shops, the disease associated with the genus Chlamydia is
psittacosis. It may also be referred to as ornithosis (particularly in older publi-
cations) and the more colloquial term parrot fever. Chlamydia psittaci was pre-
viously believed to be the sole causative organism; however, an additional two
bird-associated species have been recently discovered within the genus. The role of
these species - namely Chlamydia gallinacae and Chlamydia avium - within a disease
capacity is yet to be fully elucidated (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). The infection site and
severity of psittacosis vary considerably. It commonly presents symptoms analo-
gous with influenza; however, left untreated it can escalate to systemic disease with
a mortality rate of up to 20 % (West, 2011; Rybarczyk et al., 2019).
Chlamydia was the genus that contained the highest number of species isolated
from the case reports (Fig. B.2, Appendix B). Historically, Chlamydia psittaci was be-
lieved to be the sole etiological agent of psittacosis. However, this theory has been
challenged by more recent findings that indicate that a newly-discovered species,
Chlamydia gallinaceae, is capable of causing pneumonia in humans (Li et al., 2017).
A considerable proportion of the case reports that only reported to genus-level
for Chlamydiae were abstract-only access. Therefore, the proportion of Chlamydia
psittaci is likely under-represented. Respiratory infection, including pneumonia,
was the primary outcome, consistent with psittacosis.
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 50
The animal species that contributed the most to case reports was birds. This can be
explained by the mode of transmission of the primary pathogen it was associated
with - Chlamydia. Whilst the other pathogens identified from the case reports utilise
direct modes of transmission, including faecal-oral, direct contact and via wounds
(Masila et al., 2020; Pate et al., 2019; Aiken, Lane, and Adak, 2010) Chlamydia infec-
tion can result from aerosol inhalation (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). This characteristic
facilitates infection, since not all pet shop visitors may otherwise come into contact
with other zoonotic disease agents unless they have direct contact with the animals
or their immediate environment.
The disease affecting the largest age range was psittacosis. Overall, case report pa-
tient age ranged from 10 - 77 years. The majority of case studies involved three
or fewer individuals, with the exception of psittacosis. In either case it was not
possible to draw any conclusions from this data regarding age groups at risk from
contracting zoonotic diseases from pet shops, due to a lack of numbers and in-
formation respectively. The health status of patients prior to contracting disease
was generally good. As with other parameters, this information was lacking for
the psittacosis cases, partly due to the fact that only two of the corresponding case
reports were full access, providing more information (Saito et al., 2005; De Boeck
et al., 2016). The only patient that reported pre-existing health conditions was the
45-year-old pet shop worker that had a case of leptospirosis (Finsterer et al., 2005).
However, this is unlikely to have increased susceptibility to infection, as the health
condition was bilateral blurred vision.
Finally, the outlook and disease severity varied among the case reports. There were
reports of death for two of the diseases - psittacosis and RBF. With regards to the
latter, this was likely a result of insufficient awareness on the part of both the em-
ployee and medical professionals. The delay in diagnosis and suitable treatment
ultimately led to the death of the patient (Shvartsblat et al., 2004). There was no
specific information on the psittacosis-related death of two patients in an outbreak
affecting seven individuals, as it was abstract-only access (Morrison et al., 1991).
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 51
This was the only publication covering psittacosis that featured death as an out-
come; given that many of the psittacosis case reports involved outbreaks that af-
fected multiple individuals, the mortality rate for psittacosis for these cases was
low. Hospitalisation and antibiotic treatment were universal outcomes for all case
reports affecting humans (Finsterer et al., 2005; Shvartsblat et al., 2004; Kanazawa,
Suga, and Niwayama, 1976; Jernelius et al., 1975; Saito et al., 2005; De Boeck et al.,
2016; Viciana et al., 1993; Morrison et al., 1991; Fransan, 1969; Downing, Dewnany,
and Radford, 2001; Legout et al., 2005; Nafeev et al., 2012).
3.5.3 Research Papers
Representation of Pet Types in the Literature
The apparent bias towards fish detected in this review could be in response to
the consistent increase in popularity of the ornamental fish trade over the last few
decades (Evers, Pinnegar, and Taylor, 2019), which has led to their global ranking
of third place for popular pet species (Pate et al., 2019). The global trend of in-
creasing fish popularity is further reflected by the number of countries the research
spanned, which was also shown to be the highest for fish. Their popularity serves
as a facilitator for the dissemination of associated zoonotic pathogens (Walczak,
Puk, and Guz, 2017), such as mycobacteria.
Birds were the second most investigated species. This is hardly surprising, given
that birds were the pet type responsible for the majority of the case studies. Birds
are also a popular pet choice across the UK and Europe, with an estimated popu-
lation of 500, 000 (rounded to the nearest 100, 000) in the UK alone (PMFA, N.D.).
Of the disclosed countries where research took place, Turkey was the most repre-
sented. A possible explanation for this could lie in country-specific pet ownership
trends. Market research conducted in 2016 revealed that birds are the most pop-
ular type of pet in Turkey (GfK, 2016). Indoor pet birds are also a popular choice
in the UK, ranked as the 4th within the top 10 most popular pet types, It is also
not surprising that dogs and pets corresponding to the label exotic pets (labelled
Reptile - Other on Fig. 3.8) were also among the most researched pet types, due
to their popularity. It is, however, slightly surprising that mice are not investigated
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 52
more, due to the multiple large-scale, somtimes international, Salmonella outbreaks
that have been associated with feeder rodents in recent years (Fuller et al., 2008;
Cartwright et al., 2016; Swanson et al., 2007). Furthermore, the research papers that
pertained to mice had a focus on the risk of transmission of pathogens to the lab-
oratory environment in most cases. Possible explanations for the lack of research
corresponding to mice could be related to the popularity of mice as pets and the
fact that the feeder rodents responsible for disease outbreaks were sold purely in a
food context (Fuller et al., 2008; Cartwright et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2008; Vrbova et
al., 2018). Regarding the latter, although this review identified research performed
on the risk of zoonotic pathogen transmission from pet food, this accounted for a
single publication (Koch et al., 2020). Finally, the low number of publications inves-
tigating snakes could be an indicator that the research community does not feel the
need to add to the extensive existing literature on the risk of acquiring Salmonella
infection from snakes, otherwise known as reptile-associated Salmonellosis (Bjel-
land et al., 2020; Marin et al., 2021; Aiken, Lane, and Adak, 2010; Schrter et al.,
2004).
Genera Identified in the Literature
Salmonella Overall, Salmonella was the most frequently isolated genus, featuring
in 9 of the 54 papers. It was also isolated from the largest range of pet types (n =
7). This reflects the wide distribution of Salmonella within animal species (WHO,
2018). Though containing just two species, the Salmonella genus contains over 2,
500 serovars. The economic burden inflicted by Salmonella is significant, amount-
ing to an estimated annual figure of 3.6 billion dollars (Marin et al., 2021). For this
reason, it has been labelled as one of the most important zoonotic pathogen in de-
veloped countries, if not globally (Oros et al., 1998; Marin et al., 2021). As such,
salmonellosis (the resulting disease) is a notifiable disease in multiple countries
(ECDC, 2016).
Although the presence of mycobacteria in aquaria is well-recognised, as illustrated
by the volume of research papers addressing this within this systematic review,
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 53
the role of Salmonella in this context is less known. Whilst reviewing of the litera-
ture reveals that 16 Salmonella serovars have been isolated from fish and their envi-
ronment, these were collectively identified within a single research paper (Gaulin,
Vincent, and Ismal, 2005). This in itself came about due to an outbreak involving
a previously low incidence serovar in the province of Quebec, Canada, which took
place between 2000 - 2003. Contact with fish or aquaria was determined to be a
common factor among infected individuals at the beginning of the outbreak. The
repercussions of the outbreak were demonstrated by the hospital admission rate,
which exceeded 50 %. During the course of the outbreak, up to half of the regions
within Quebec were affected, illustrating the ease of spread (Gaulin, Vincent, and
Ismal, 2005). This could have been facilitated by unregulated husbandry practices
at the wholesaler and pet shop level.
The fact that Salmonella was present in so many animal types could increase the
likelihood of Salmonella infection arising from pet shops. In light of this, it is there-
fore imperative that pet shop workers take appropriate measures to mitigate the
risk of salmonellosis arising from pet shops.
Mycobacteria Mycobacterium was among the top ten most frequently reported
genera overall, along with the most prevalent genus associated with fish, which
were in turn the most investigated pet type. Mycobacterium is a large genus con-
taining in excess of 150 species (Aubry et al., 2017; Abudaff and Beam, 2018). Of
these, nearly two thirds belong to the non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) sub-
division, which includes species that are characterised by rapid growth relative to
other mycobacteria (Rocchetti et al., 2017). This subdivision, termed rapid-growing
mycobacteria (RGM), is further split into six primary groupings (Mastroianni, 2003;
Franco-Paredes et al., 2018; Bouam, Levasseur, and Drancourt, 2018; Lamy et al.,
2008; Lazo-Vasquez and Gonzales-Zamora, 2020; Kuar et al., 2017; Brown-Elliott
and Philley, 2017). The RGM species identified in the literature spanned four of
these groups ( Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonae-Mycobacterium abces-
sus, Mycobacterium smegmatis and pigmented RGM). Pathogenic RGM species fre-
quently belong to the Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae-Mycobacterium
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 54
abcessus groups (Rocchetti et al., 2017; Brown-Elliott and Philley, 2017). This was
corroborated by the present findings, with a third of the identified species belong-
ing to the Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, in addition to M. chelonae.
Pathogenic NTM can also be classified as slow growing mycobacteria (SGM). A no-
table SGM that was identified in the research papers was Mycobacterium marinum.
This pathogen is commonly the etiological agent of mycobacterial disease in both
fish and humans (Kuar et al., 2017; Aubry et al., 2017; Pate et al., 2019; Hashish
et al., 2018), with aquaria as the common route of exposure accordingly (Hashish
et al., 2018). Furthermore, the diseases caused by M. marinum are extrapulmonary
in nature; as with many NTM infections, these occur due to a breach in skin in-
tegrity (Brown-Elliott and Philley, 2017; Mastroianni, 2003). Also belonging to the
SGM group is the Mycobacterium terrae complex (Abudaff and Beam, 2018). Two of
the species belonging to this complex were identified in this review: Mycobacterium
terrae and Mycobacterium arupense.
Regarding public knowledge of fish-associated mycobacterial health risks, the col-
loquialism of infection with M. marinum as fish handlers disease and fish tank
granuloma (Aubry et al., 2017; Hashish et al., 2018) indicates that there is some
awareness of the role NTM play in disease; however, a survey revealed that more
than three-quarters of participants, 23.7 % of which had pet shop occupations,
were unaware of the zoonotic status of mycobacteria (Pate et al., 2019). This is
particularly problematic given the reports of increasing incidence of NTM infec-
tions within immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals over recent
years (Mastroianni, 2003; Rocchetti et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Lazo-Vasquez and
Gonzales-Zamora, 2020). These infections present both diagnosis- and treatment-
specific challenges (Pate et al., 2019).
Diseased fish may appear outwardly healthy during the initial stages of mycobac-
terial infection (Kuar et al., 2017; Pate et al., 2019). Alternatively, fish may act as
reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens (Pate et al., 2019). Subsequently, extra caution
should therefore be taken when coming into contact with fish or the tank.
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 55
3.5.4 Individuals at risk from pet shops
The findings from both the case reports and the research papers reinforce the no-
tion that zoonotic diseases can be occupational health risks. Although members
of the public are also exposed to zoonotic health risks within the pet shop envi-
ronment, the increased exposure to disease agents through temporal and activity
differences puts pet shop workers at a greater risk. The risk to the public varies in
accordance with the specific disease agent characteristics, such as infection mech-
anism; pathogens that can utilise airborne mechanisms are more likely to cause
infection that those that require access via a direct route, such as via a bite wound.
This was clearly demonstrated within the case reports, whereby the disease that
affected the greatest number of members of the public was psittacosis, which only
requires transient, indirect exposure to the hosts (Rybarczyk et al., 2019).
3.5.5 Difficulties in diagnosis of zoonotic infections
A consistent theme present among the zoonotic infections identified in this review
is the diagnostic challenges of zoonoses. The origins of these challenges are mul-
tifaceted; they may relate to technical challenges, resources, training, insurance or
level of knowledge and awareness, all of which will be explored in the following
sections.
Technical Challenges Associated with detection of Zoonotic Pathogens
A zoonotic pathogen can be challenging to identify due to culture and technical
challenges. Examples of the former include mycobacterial species and Streptobacil-
lus moniliformis, which are challenging to detect due to slow culture and fastidious-
ness respectively (Rodino et al., 2020; Johnston, Chiang, and Elwood, 2017). Al-
ternatively, detection may be hamstrung due to the choice of permitted diagnostic
tests. For example, the most commonly used diagnostic test for psittacosis is serol-
ogy (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). However, this has drawbacks, such as cross-reactivity,
the lag time between infection and measurable antibody titres, the requirement for
multiple tests and false negatives due to antibiotics (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). De-
spite these drawbacks, coupled with the advantages offered by nucleic acid-based
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 56
techniques such as PCR, regulations and insurance policies can prevent the use of
these alternative techniques (Rybarczyk et al., 2019).
Awareness
On the one hand, the transition of publication trends from primarily reporting cases
of zoonotic disease arising from pet shops to proactively investigating this area in-
dicates that awareness of zoonotic disease within this context is increasing. Sim-
ilarly, the importance of certain zoonotic diseases from a broader perspective is
reflected by disease notification protocols. Psittacosis is one such example of a no-
tifiable zoonotic disease in multiple countries (De Boeck et al., 2016). This is hardly
surprising, due to the potential of this disease to cause large outbreaks, as it has
previously (Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2018). This apparent increase in awareness is,
however, juxtaposed by an accompanying substantial increase in infection rates in
certain areas within recent years (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). Furthermore, despite the
improved awareness of psittacosis, the authors of a review published as recently
as 2020 suggested that under-reporting and diagnosis still occur to a high degree
(Rybarczyk et al., 2019). In addition to the increased infection rates reported for Bel-
gium, the authors revealed that the reporting system registered less than a quarter
of cases over a 3 year period (Rybarczyk et al., 2019). These findings clearly demon-
strate that although there has been an increase in the recognition of some zoonoses,
such as psittacosis, it is far from adequate. In this and many other incidences, it ap-
pears that the communication of zoonotic diseases between governing bodies and
other sectors, such as the healthcare sector, is disjointed. This does not solely apply
to psittacosis, but across the board. The most harrowing example of insufficient
education of healthcare providers was the fatal case of rat bite fever, where no ref-
erence to the cause of death - the workplace injury - was made in the patient notes
(Shvartsblat et al., 2004). Had this been the case, the appropriate diagnostic tests
for the causative organisms could have been completed sooner, which could have
been life-saving. Instead, the patient was discharged home in the absence of a com-
prehensive diagnosis, an outcome that was shared with a psittacosis patient in 2020
and a another RBF patient, also in 2020 (Reisinger et al., 2020; Rodino et al., 2020).
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 57
In line with this, all three of the pathogens responsible for eliciting human infec-
tion within the case reports have been deemed under-reported or under-diagnosed
(Bandara et al., 2014; Rybarczyk et al., 2019; Rodino et al., 2020; Gaastra et al., 2009).
Finally, the diagnosis of zoonotic infections can be complicated by the clinical pre-
sentation of the illness. This can be the case for RBF, whereby the original site of
infection commonly does not indicate active infection when the causative organ-
ism is Streptobacillus moniliformis. Instead, other parts of the body are affected, such
as the pulmonary and cardiac systems, along with joints. Therefore, as the au-
thors reporting a case of RBF occurring in the absence of a bite acknowledged, a
comprehensive patient summary is crucial in ensuring the inclusion of RBF as a
differential during diagnosis (Rodino et al., 2020). For this to be the case, however,
medical professionals need to possess knowledge of zoonotic occupational risks.
This was clearly not the case for the fatal RBF case report, since the physician was
aware of the occupation of the pet shop employee, but no mention of the offending
wound was made (Shvartsblat et al., 2004).
3.6 Conclusions
In conclusion, this chapter successfully addressed the two main objectives. An
extensive amount of information in relation to zoonotic bacteria associated with
pet shops was gathered, including the following:
 A variety of pathogenic bacteria are associated with pet shops
 Overall, the most reported genus is Salmonella
 The most investigated pet type was fish
 The most prevalent genus within fish was Mycobacterium
 Psittacosis was the disease that featured in the majority of case reports
 Multiple significant zoonotic diseases are under- diagnosed and under-reported
Chapter 3. Systematic Quantitative Literature Review 58
 There needs to be education of different sectors (such as the pet shop indus-
try/retail and healthcare), along with the public, on zoonotic disease risks
associated with pet shops. This is referred to as a OneHealth approach (cross-
sector, interdisciplinary).
 There is disproportionate risk of contracting zoonoses from pet shops based
on transmission route, exposure type and patient demographics
 There needs to be improved diagnosis of zoonoses through improved aware-
ness and transitioning/revolutionising/improved detection using nucleic acid-
based techniques
Furthermore, a list of 51 pet shop-associated genera was compiled. These are to be
used as a foundation for the analysis on the pet shop sample set, where they will
act as targets. If present in the samples, although it is not possible to determine the
pathogenicity, it is possible to conclude whether or not further investigation using
alternative techniques is warranted.

Characterisation of
Surface-Associated Bacterial
Communities within a Pet Shop
Overview
Following on from the development, optimisation and validation of methods used
for 16S library preparation (Chapter 2), paired with the findings from the system-
atic literature review investigating zoonotic risks posed by pet shops (Chapter 3),
environmental swab samples from a pet shop selling a range of animals, including
birds, reptiles, fish, rabbits and guinea pigs, were taken from previously unsam-
pled areas and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. The bacterial genera identified
from the systematic review performed in chapter 3 were used as target genera to
provide a foundation for the interpretation of the results. To the best of my knowl-
edge, bacterial characterisation of a variety of pet shop surfaces has not previously
been done - the research papers gathered for the literature review in Chapter 3
involved direct sampling of animals in a pet shop, or their cage environment, as
opposed to surfaces the public are likely to come into contact with.
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
4.1 Introduction
The literature review performed in Chapter 3 revealed that pet shops present a va-
riety of zoonotic health risks at the worker and customer interface. These risks
are presented by a variety of bacteria, corresponding to the 51 genera identified
in Chapter 3. One of the overall findings from chapter 3 was that Salmonella was
the genus that featured in the largest proportion of research papers, and was also
the genus isolated from the largest range of pet species. Other frequently reported
genera included Escherichia, Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Chlamydia, Mycobacterium, Pseu-
domonas, Clostridium, Acinetobacter and Edwardsiella. Many of these are members of
the Enterobacteriaceae, which is to be expected given that i) Enterobacteriaceae are as-
sociated with the intestinal flora of mammals/animals (Sigirci et al., 2019) and ii)
many of the studies performed sampling directly on the animals included in their
research or their corresponding faecal matter or substrates (Shin et al., 2012; Wal-
czak, Puk, and Guz, 2017; Han et al., 2010; Hayashimoto et al., 2014; Sigirci et al.,
2019).
Regarding incidences of disease, however, the genus behind the majority of the case
reports identified in Chapter 3 was Chlamydia, which contains species that cause
cause the respiratory disease psittacosis in birds and humans. One of the conclu-
sions from chapter 3 was centred in the airborne transmission route utilised by
Chlamydia species, which could be an explanation for the capacity of this organism
to infect large numbers of people, including those with brief exposures (Fransan,
1969; De Boeck et al., 2016). The transmission route of this pathogen has the poten-
tial to create control challenges within the pet shop environment. It is therefore a
significant pathogen, reflected by its status as a notifiable disease in multiple coun-
tries (De Boeck et al., 2016). Despite this, there remains insufficient reporting and
diagnosis, a characteristic that is common across other members of the 51 bacterial
genera identified (Rybarczyk et al., 2019; Shvartsblat et al., 2004; Pate et al., 2019).
4.2 Objectives
The work in this chapter aims to fulfil the following objectives:
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
1. Which samples yielded large amounts of sequencing reads?
2. How many presumptive bacterial genera were identified from the pet shop?
3. What were the most prevalent and abundant presumptive genera across the
samples?
4. Were any target genera present, and if so:
(a) Which were most prevalent across the samples?
(b) Which were assigned the greatest number of sequencing reads?
(c) How did the abundance/number of reads compare with non-target gen-
(d) Which sample types accounted for the most target genera?
5. Is there transfer of target genera between sample types?
6. Do the findings of the study warrant further investigation using methods that
can offer higher taxonomic resolution?
4.3 Materials and Methods
4.3.1 Sample Collection
Environmental swab samples were taken from multiple surfaces within a pet shop
in North West England in November, 2018 (Table 4.1). Surface selection was based
on surfaces that customers were likely to come into contact with, such as cage ex-
teriors, door handles and shelves and surfaces, along with those that the pet shop
workers were likely to come into contact with, such as the till and sink. Addition-
ally, an opportunity arose to sample the inside of a guinea pig enclosure whilst the
owner was cleaning this out during sampling.
Triplicate technical replicates (i.e. replicated samples of the same surface) were
taken in addition to biological replicates (i.e. samples from different surfaces within
the same category, e.g. different shelves), the latter where possible. Dry swabbing
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
was performed for approximately 10 seconds per sample. Following sampling,
the swab heads were removed using sterilised scissors and transferred into 2 mL
screwcap microcentrifuge tubes containing approximately 600 L of DNA/RNA
Shield (Zymo, Cambridge Bioscience) and transported under ambient conditions.
Once the samples were received at the laboratory, they were stored at 18C until
processing.

4.3.2 Sample Preparation and Sequencing
DNA Extraction
DNA extraction was performed using the phenol-chloroform solvent-based extrac-
tion detailed in the method validation chapter (chapter 2). The only modification
was a smaller elution volume of 10 L of molecular biology grade water. Extracted
DNA was stored at 18C.
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
Library Preparation
16S amplicons for sequencing were generated from pooled technical replicates fol-
lowing the illumina 2-step protocol, employing the conditions established in the
Method Validation chapter. Amplicons generated from the step 1 PCR were pu-
rified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, UK). Amplicons resulting from
step 2 PCR were purified and normalised simultaneously using 96-well SequalPrep
Normalisation Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
Sequencing
Amplicons were sequenced using a 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent Micro Kit v2 (Illu-
mina, USA) with a read length of 2 x 150 bp - on the MiSeq platform (refer to
(DCruze et al., 2020a)).
4.3.3 Post-Sequencing Analysis
DADA2 Pipeline
Raw reads were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016) within
the program R (version 3.6.1)(R Core Team, 2020), via RStudio (RStudio Team,
2020). The first four reads were visually inspected to assess where to truncate for
high-quality reads. Subsequently, the truncLen value was set to 110. Default values
were used for all other parameters (MaxN, truncQ, rm.phix and maxEE). Taxonomy
was assigned using the genome taxonomy database, version 95 (GTDB, (Chaumeil
et al., 2020)) in combination with 1 x 150 bp forward read sequences. A variety of
packages were used for future analyses within R. These were tidyverse (Wickham
et al., 2019b), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), viridis (Garnier, 2018) and vegan (Oksanen
et al., 2020).
Cleaning
The first stage of the data cleaning involved removing any non-bacterial kingdoms,
along with NA values across taxonomy levels kingdom through to family. Genera
were aggregated for all future analyses. Next, Genera containing 10 or less reads
were also removed in order to eliminate extremely spurious reads, whilst trying
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
to limit the removal of potential pathogens, which were expected to contain lower
read numbers compared to commensals. Samples were grouped into batches with
their corresponding extraction control. Contaminants, defined as genera that had
reads within the extraction control but none in the samples, were filtered out be-
fore visually inspecting any remaining genera with reads in the extraction controls.
Genera were kept if the number of reads in at least one of the samples was four-
fold greater than those in the extraction control. Finally, any samples containing
less than 100 sequencing reads were removed.
Identification of Target Genera
Target genera were defined as those that were identified from research papers in
the literature review (Chapter 3). These genera were identified in the sequencing
data using the Tidyverse suite of packages within R (Wickham et al., 2019b).
4.3.4 Beta Diversity Analysis
Bray-curtis was the index used for the construction of dissimilarity matrices used
for the non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses.
Prior to performing these analyses, samples were normalised by converting the
number of reads per genus within samples to percentage composition.
4.4 Results
This results section initially provides a broad overview of the data to understand
data quality and integrity. Information on sequencing depth is gathered in order to
assess if the results capture the majority of the bacterial communities. The number
of reads and genera per sample type are investigated in order to determine the
number of presumptively identified genera across the sample set and identify areas
within the pet shop with the highest bacterial load. Although the target genera
are not a focus at this stage, they are acknowledged where relevant. This broad
sample perspective then shifts to narrow the focus on the presence, prevalence and
abundance of target genera within the samples to address objective three. Finally,
diversity and statistical analyses are conducted to answer the key questions: i) are
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
target bacterial transferred across the pet shop environment and ii) is there a need
for future research to investigate these environments further?
4.4.1 Overview of the data
Sequencing Depth
The rarefaction curves plateaued for all samples (Fig. C.1, Appendix C).
The overall number of genera per sample (post-clean) ranged from 1 - 54, with
an average of 24 (Table C.1, Appendix C). The number of reads per sample (post-
clean) ranged from 178 to 23, 600, with an average of 5, 758. Data cleaning filtered
out twelve genera and one sample (IDF1).
The sample type containing both the highest number of sequencing reads, in ad-
dition to the most genera, was the interior guinea pig cage (Figures 4.1 and 4.2).
Conversely, the sample type that generated the lowest number of reads and corre-
sponding genera was the light switch (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). Most sample types had
less than 5000 reads post-clean (Table C.1 and Fig. 4.1). Those samples contain-
ing reads exceeding this threshold corresponded to the interior and exterior guinea
cages, bird cages and shelving. More than half of the sample types contained, on
average, over 20 genera.

4.4.2 Presence and prevalence of target genera
Of the 134 genera that were isolated across the pet shop samples following data
cleaning, 13 (9.7 %) were target genera. These were Mycobacterium, Clostridium,
Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Vibrio, Proteus, Brevibacterium, Brevundimonas, Corynebac-
terium, Flavobacterium, Rhodococcus, Stenotrophomonas and Streptococcus (Fig. C.2,
Appendix C).
The target genera most prevalent across the samples were Corynebacterium and
Staphylococcus, followed by Acinetobacter and Brevibacterium. These pairs were present
across 80 % and 70 % of the samples respectively (Table 4.4, Fig. 4.3B). The target
genus assigned to the most sequencing reads was Acinetobacter, accounting for 13.9
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within

% and 54.8 % of the overall and target genera sequencing reads respectively (Table
4.4, Fig.4.3A).

The sample that yielded the most reads was the interior guinea pig cage (Fig. 4.3A).
Acinetobacter accounted for the highest proportion of reads corresponding to target
genera within the interior and exterior guinea pig cage samples, in addition to one
of the shelves. Following on from this, there were multiple shared target genera
among these four samples. Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were
in all four, whereas Brevundimonas and Flavobacterium were present in half of this
subset.

The sample containing the most target genera was one of the exterior reptile cages
(RC1), which contained nine target genera (Fig. 4.3C). Overall, the number of tar-
get genera per sample ranged from 1 - 9, corresponding to the sink and RC1 re-
spectively (Fig. 4.3C). RC1, BC3, CAGE, S1, BC1 and BC2 contained more than
5 target genera each, making bird cages the sample type to consistently contain a
large number of target genera across the replicates. Conversely, three samples con-
tained just one target genus: EDH, IDH1 and SINK. The light switch was the only
sample that did not contain target genera (Fig. 4.3D). Overall, the average number
of target genera per sample was 4.
The percentage of sequencing reads corresponding to target genera was variable
across the samples. Whilst it was zero for the light switch, it exceeded 50 % in the

case of exterior guinea pig cage one (GPC1) (Fig. 4.3D). The proportion of sequenc-
ing reads assigned to target genera exceeded 10 % for over half of the samples.
4.4.3 Transfer of genera across sample types
Using bray-curtis as the dissimilarity index, a dendrogram and NMDS plot were
constructed (Fig. 4.4 and 4.6). The samples formed several distinct clusters in the
dendrogram (Fig. 4.4), in which there was an overall divide between non-animal-
related surfaces and animal-related surfaces. The exceptions to this were one of
the exterior reptile cage samples (RC3), which clustered with the tap and inner
door frame 2, and the till, which clustered with the remaining reptile cages and
a shelf (Fig. 4.4). Many of the clusters were predictable, such as the bird cage
and guinea pig cage cluster. The samples least similar to the rest of the sample set
were IDH1, EDH, LS and SINK. The reptile cage sample set was the least closely
clustered group. Furtermore, if the dendrogram was to be split into three clusters
(Height = 0.8), the RC3 is in a separate cluster to RC1 and RC2. When this analysis
was repeated on just the target genera, some of the clustering patterns remained,
such as the CAGE, GPC1, GPC2 and S3 cluster (Fig. 4.5).

The NMDS plot reinforced the findings of the dendrogram, with samples broadly
clustering by sample type, with some sample types similar to others. The divide
between the majority of animal- and non-animal-associated surfaces was more dis-
tinct in this plot compared with the dendrogram, particularly with regard to the
exterior door handle, light switch and sink. It was not possible to repeat the anal-
ysis only using target genera due to insufficient data points resulting in a stress
value of almost zero.

4.5 Discussion
The genera previously identified within a pet shop environment through the sys-
tematic review in Chapter 3 were target genera used to guide the analysis of the se-
quencing outputs. This was not for the purpose of being able to definitively deter-
mine whether bacterial pathogens were present in the samples, due to the caveats
of amplicon sequencing outlined in the Introduction chapter - namely, the limited
taxonomic resolution afforded by amplicon sequencing, which limits species-level
identification (Gupta et al., 2019). This information is a vital first step in inferring
the potential pathogenicity of bacteria, since a genus may contain many species,
only some of which are viewed as obligate or opportunistic pathogens. Instead,
the target genera were used as a point of reference and comparison to previous
findings. In addition to this, this work aimed to determine if target genera could
be isolated from environments outside of those previously examined. A range of
customer-accessible interfaces within the pet shop environment were therefore in-
cluded in the sample set.
4.5.1 Data Overview
Genera belonging to multiple families were putatively identified across the sam-
ples. The most prevalent genera included those known to be ubiquitous in the
environment, such as Acinetobacter, in addition to those associated with the skin
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
and microflora of humans and animals, such as Staphylococcus. The genera con-
tained species acknowledged to be commensals and opportunistic pathogens. The
number of genera per sample was generally higher for animal-associated surfaces,
such as the cage exterior, than for other surfaces, such as door handles and frames.
This implies that transferred bacteria get diluted with increased distance from one
of the most likely sources - the animals themselves.
4.5.2 Target Genera
In addition for accounting for nearly 10 % of the assigned genera, multiple target
genera identified in Chapter 3 either contained sequencing reads that accounted for
more than 1 % of the total number of sequencing reads, were present across half or
more of the samples, or both. The most prevalent target genera were Corynebac-
terium, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter and Brevibacterium. In the systematic litera-
ture review performed in Chapter 3, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were
reported in one and three publications respectively. A possible explanation for the
low coverage of Corynebacterium could due to the previous notion that it is a con-
taminant, due to that fact that species of this genus are part of the commensal skin
and mucosal microbiota (Vouga and Greub, 2016). The current number of validly
published Corynebacterium species, as listed by the List of Prokaryotic names with
Standing in Nomenclature, is currently 125 (LPSN, N.D.[a]). There are a number of
species within this genus that been reported to cause a range diseases in either hu-
mans, animals, or both in the case of C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis (Oliveira et
al., 2017). Diseases in humans include diphtheria, pharyngeal diphtheria, urinary
tract infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, pelvic oesteomyelitis and respiratory in-
fections (Oliveira et al., 2017).
Regarding members of Staphylococcus, although there are 55 validly published species
(LPSN, N.D.[b]), the literature predominantly focuses on the type species - Staphy-
lococcus aureus. This species was reported in three of the papers selected within
the systematic review performed in chapter 3. Two of these publications featured
mice, from which S. aureus was isolated by culture from 7.1 % and 3.5 % respectively
(Hayashimoto et al., 2014; Dammann et al., 2011), while the remaining publication
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
isolated S. aureus from frozen raw meat intended for consumption by dogs (Koch
et al., 2020).
The fact that Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium are present across so many sam-
ples can be explained by the following: i) due to the corresponding high number
of sequencing reads, and hence high biomass, of these genera, they may be more
easily spread around the pet shop; or ii) since one of the main common denomi-
nators between all of the sample types is the pet shop staff, these could be acting
as either vehicles for the dissemination of bacteria through behaviours, or could
be the original source of the bacteria. Without further testing, it is not possible to
resolve these speculations.
The target genus with the largest proportion of reads was Acinetobacter. This is due
to the fact that it was the genus that contributed the greatest proportion of reads
within the interior guinea pig cage sample, which was by far the highest biomass
sample. However, it was also present in 14 out of 20 samples, which suggests that
the abundance isnt solely influenced by this single sample. Although the num-
ber of corresponding sequencing reads were highest for samples associated with
guinea pigs, it was also present across all three bird and reptile cages, in addition
to a door frame, two of the shelves, the tap and the till. The widespread nature of
this genus, in combination with the high levels associated with guinea pig cages,
suggests that this genus is being distributed across the pet shop with the guinea
pigs acting as the primary source. Furthermore, the fact that it was isolated from
the tap and till, which would only be used by members of staff, indicates that that
pet shop workers play a role in this dissemination. The colonisation of surfaces that
would have been in contact with their hands suggests that hand hygiene could be
improved. As a note, sequences corresponding to this genus were absent in 7 of
the eight extraction controls along with the PCR negative control. The remaining
control contained 16 reads, which was over 500-fold lower that the amount within
the interior guinea pig cage sample, excluding this as a artifact from a processing
point of view. Although not a target genus, the genus with the highest percent of
overall sequencing reads was Leaf454. It is unclear what the latest assignment for
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
this genus is, since according to GTDB, the genus lacks a binomially named repre-
sentative genome. It was submitted as a member of Aureimonas to NCBI GenBank
in 2015 (NCBI, 2015). In the absence of being able to derive any conclusive infor-
mation regarding this organism in the present work, the main conclusion that can
be drawn at this stage is that it warrants further investigation in future work.
The proportion of reads assigned to target genera was substantial, and in the case of
one sample (GPG1), the majority. It is probable that if the samples were identified to
species level, the proportion of species identified in the literature would decrease,
as operating at the genus level results in an over-estimate.
Relationships between Different Surface Communities
The clustering observed in the dendrogram and NMDS plots indicate that highly
similar communities are present across the majority of the animal-related surfaces.
As there was a range of animals for sale, some differences in the clustering of micro-
bial communities from different surfaces are to be expected - particularly between
reptile- and mammal-associated samples - which could explain why samples from
bird cages are more similar to each other than to samples from reptile cages, for
instance. Since only a single sample type was taken from an animal cage interior
housing guinea pigs, this therefore suggests that bacteria originating from inside
the cages is transferred to the corresponding exterior surfaces.
When performing the cluster analysis using only the data from the target genera,
there is a reshuffling of the clusters, although the CAGE, GPC1, GPC2 and S3 clus-
ter remained unchanged. This is likely because these four samples had the highest
numbers of target genera sequencing reads, which meant that the proportion of
target genera reads relative to the total number of reads for each of these samples
was substantial, and therefore less affected by removing non-target reads from the
analysis. Shelf 3 was located underneath the guinea pig cage, which is a likely
explanation for why it clustered with the guinea pig cage samples.
The NMDS plot had one large cluster, along with some disparate samples. The
latter samples correspond to the inner door frame, exterior door handle, one of the
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
interior door handles, light switch and sink. It is not surprising that some of these
have distinct communities, based on the conditions and how likely they are to come
into contact with people/vehicles.
The results of the NMDS plot suggest that bacteria are transferred between surfaces
in the main pet room.
4.5.3 Animals presenting the greatest risk
The animal associated with the samples that contained large proportions of target
genera was guinea pigs. Whilst it is not surprising that the sample taken from the
interior of the cage contained a large amount of sequences, most likely due to the
higher-biomass nature of this sample comparative to the others, the amount of se-
quencing reads for the exterior samples is far more surprising. Together, the NMDS
and hierarchical clustering analyses infer that although the exterior guinea pig cage
samples are closer in similarity, both exterior and interior samples are similar, sug-
gesting that bacteria are transferred from the guinea pig enclosure to the surround-
ing environment. There are numerous possible explanations for this occurrence.
Firstly, the cages were not fully covered. Instead, removable, overlapping sheets
of plastic were used. It is therefore plausible that dust and small particles from
guinea pig bedding, which generally consists of wood shavings and hay, could be-
come airborne, facilitating transmission. Secondly, the pet shop owner permitted
her pet cats to roam freely around the pet shop. One of these was very young, and
during the course of sample collection, was observed entering the guinea pig en-
closure. It transpired that this was a fairly regular occurrence, due to the nature of
the enclosure. It is therefore very likely that the cat acted as a vehicle for the spread
of bacteria around the pet shop.
Conclusions
Whilst the findings of this chapter cannot be used to determine if pathogens were
present, the reverse is also true - they cannot be ruled out either. Therefore, the
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
results warrant further investigation using techniques able to provide species-level
identification, along with determination of pathogenicity potential.
The findings of this chapter include:
 134 genera were isolated across the pet shop samples
 9.7 % of these were target genera
 13 target genera were putatively identified:
 Mycobacterium
 Clostridium
 Acinetobacter
 Staphylococcus
 Vibrio
 Proteus
 Brevibacterium
 Brevundimonas
 Corynebacterium
 Flavobacterium
 Rhodococcus
 Stenotrophomonas
 Streptococcus.
 The target genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter and Brevibac-
terium were present across 70 - 80 % of samples, and accounted for 1.3 - 13.9
% of the sequencing reads for all of the genera present
Chapter 4. Characterisation of Surface-Associated Bacterial Communities within
a Pet Shop
 The overall sample type containing the most target genera was bird cages
 There appears to be transfer of some bacteria between sample types, as indi-
cated by prevalence patterns and the dissimilarity analyses.
 The findings of the study support the need to investigate the presence of cer-
tain target genera across a variety of pet shop surface types, using methods
that would enable species-level identification.

Bacterial Community Composition
of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in
Togo, West Africa
5.1 Introduction
Pet ownership and popularity has increased over recent decades, particularly with
regard to so-called exotic pets, which form a substantial global enterprise (DCruze
et al., 2020b). In the USA alone, around half of all pets now fall into this category
(Lockwood et al., 2019). Globally, one of the most favoured type of exotic pet is
reptiles (Valdez, 2021). Furthermore, a survey regarding the popularity of exotic
pet species completed by individuals with reptile trade involvement revealed that
86.8 % of survey respondents considered one of the key species within this project
- ball pythons - to be the most popular pet reptile (Valdez, 2021).
The two key species within this project are the ball python (Python regius) and its
associated feeder rodents, both of which were present in farms within Togo, West
Africa. Ball pythons were selected for a number of reasons:
 They have consistently been the most heavily live CITES listed traded species
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
from Togo, monopolising the live reptile trade for more than four decades
(DCruze et al., 2020b)
 They are a very popular pet on a global scale, representing the most popular
snake option in North America and Europe (Geographic, 2020)
 Changes and irregularities in trade practices threaten the sustainability of the
ball python trade
Furthermore, Togo was selected for sampling due to the fact that it is one of three
countries collectively accounting for almost the entirety of ball python trade from
Africa (99.9 % for the years 2011 - 2015, (Geographic, 2020; CITES, 2015)). Over the
past few decades, millions of ball pythons have been exported from Africa (Har-
rington and DCruze, 2020). The intensity of the trade has resulted in the recom-
mendation to suspend trade (CITES, ND[b]).
The current trade status of ball pythons is appendix II, meaning that they are not
necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade
is closely controlled (CITES, ND[a]). However, the apparent underestimation of
ball python exports, paired with evidence that implies repeated incidences of ball
python annual quotas and the previous occurrence of CITES interventions, is a
cause for concern and challenges the previously held notion that ball python ranch-
ing in Togo was being operated in a sustainable manner (DCruze et al., 2020b).
Although captive breeding of snakes occurs, the practice of ranching appears to
predominate in farms within Africa (DCruze et al., 2020). Ranching involves the
capture of juvenile ball pythons or eggs from the wild from environments in which
they would otherwise have had a very low probability of surviving to adulthood
(CITES, ND).
The latest estimates for the global annual number of snake bites is in excess of 5
million, with tens and hundreds of thousands of deaths and morbidities result-
ing accordingly (WHO, 2021). Since many of the reported genera belonging to
the snake oral microbiota have opportunistic pathogen status, snake bites therefore
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
present a serious zoonotic health risk. Snake bites may not be the only transmis-
sion route of these pathogens; a study on komodo dragons found that genera from
their oral microbiomes was transferred to their surrounding environment (Hyde
et al., 2016). Effective characterisation of the oral microbiota of popular pet snake
species is therefore justified to promote improved understanding and awareness of
the potential health risks posed by these pets.
A number of existing studies have begun to investigate the snake oral microbiota,
revealing a wide range of genera (Table 5.1). However, many of these studies have
relied on culture-dependent techniques. A noteworthy limitation of culture is that
it excludes groups of bacteria due to selection pressures imposed by the choice of
media and growth conditions. For example, the study by Jho et al. (2011) used
solely aerobic conditions and a single incubation temperature and media type.
Therefore, although 16S amplicon sequencing has limited taxonomic resolution and
other caveats, such as the introduction of its own biases, it is advantageous over
traditional culture techniques regarding community characterisation as it is able to
give a broader overview (Starke, Pylro, and Morais, 2021).

However, it is not just the snakes that pose zoonotic infection risks: several large
scale, spatiotemporal Salmonella outbreaks have been caused by the feeder rodents
associated with reptile ownership. In an outbreak affecting Minnesota, USA, four
young individuals were infected with Salmonella following direct (n=2) or indirect
(n=2) exposure to classroom snakes present in a junior high school (a ball python
and a fox snake). Due to insufficient knowledge on the teachers part, who was un-
aware of reptile-associated salmonellosis (RAS) and therefore did not implement
the necessary hygiene procedures, isolates of the outbreak strain were recovered
from the classroom countertop in the vicinity of the terrariums and the sink, in ad-
dition to some of the frozen feeder rodents from the supplier. These outbreak find-
ings prompted a multistate investigation, which revealed that the outbreak strain,
which was traced back to a single supplier, was responsible for illness in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Wyoming. There are several causes for concern arising from this
outbreak. Firstly, the patients had a median age of 13 years old. Whilst it is gen-
erally accepted that individuals most at risk from pet-associated zoonotic disease
are at the extremities of the age range (i.e. under 5 and about 65), along with the
immunocompromised (Stull, Brophy, and Weese, 2015), the age range of those af-
fected in this outbreak ( 9 - 50) is less expected. Secondly, there was evidence of
insufficient public education of the zoonotic risks presented by feeder rodents. In
addition to the lack of knowledge regarding RAS from the teacher at the school
in Minnesota, multiple individuals reported storing the feeder rodents in the same
freezer as that used for food. Finally, it later became apparent that other states con-
tained individuals infected with the outbreak strain, due to the online nature of the
feeder rodent manufacturer. Due to the structure of health organisations within the
USA, these could have been missed without interstate communications - a fact that
could conceal the real-world occurrence and spread of zoonotic outbreaks.
The principle aim of this project was to gain an insight into the microbiotas associ-
ated with ball pythons and feeder rodents within Togo breeding farms in response
to the above information, with a view to assess zoonotic potential and communi-
cate these findings to the scientific community.

5.3 Materials and Methods
5.3.1 Sample Collection and Sequencing Run Allocation
Swab samples were taken from ball pythons and feeder rodents present within up
to five farms located in Togo, Africa on two separate trips, in accordance with the
sampling protocol (Appendix D). For both animals, a swab sample was taken from
the oral and rectal/cloacal cavities (for rodents and snakes respectively). Samples
were stored in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research) and stored frozen until trans-
port into the UK when possible. Overall, 462 samples were collected (Fig. D.1,
Appendix D). These were split relatively evenly across both trips, with 242 and
240 corresponding to trips 1 and 2 respectively. Samples were randomly allocated
to one of two sequencing runs using the RANDBETWEEN function in Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corporation, 2021).
5.3.2 Sample Preparation and Sequencing
DNA Extraction
DNA extraction was performed using the phenol-chloroform solvent-based extrac-
tion detailed in the method validation chapter (chapter 2). The only modification
was a smaller elution volume of 10 L of molecular biology grade water. Extracted
DNA was stored at 18C.
Library Preparation
16S amplicons for sequencing were generated following the illumina 2-step proto-
col, employing the conditions established in the Method Validation chapter. Ampli-
cons generated from the step 1 PCR were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beck-
man Coulter, UK). Amplicons were the step 2 PCR were purified and normalised
simultaneously using 96-well SequalPrep Normalisation Plates (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, USA).
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
Sequencing
Samples were sequenced across two MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycle) cartridges
(Illumina, USA) with a read length of 2 x 300 bp, run on the MiSeq platform.
5.3.3 Post-Sequencing Analysis
DADA2 Pipeline
Raw reads were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016) within
the program R (version 3.6.1). The first 4 reads were visually inspected to assess
where to truncate for high-quality reads. Default values were used for all other pa-
rameters (MaxN, truncQ, rm.phix and maxEE). Taxonomy was assigned using the
genome taxonomy database, version 95 (GTDB, (Chaumeil et al., 2020)) in combi-
nation with 1 x 300 bp forward read sequences.
Cleaning
The first stage of the data cleaning involved removing any non-bacterial kingdoms,
along with NA values across taxonomy levels kingdom through to family. Genera
were aggregated for all future analyses. Data at this stage was used for construction
of the species accumulation curve.
Cleaning Cut-Off Points Determination of cleaning cut-offs for the number of
reads per sample and genus was performed by visualising the sequencing read data
in a histogram format and manually selecting a cut-off based on the distribution.
The cut-off number of sequencing reads per sample and genus was 316 and 32 for
run 1 respectively, with samples or genera containing less than this number being
discarded. The corresponding numbers for run 2 were 100 and 32 respectively.
Negative-control processing Batches of samples were compared to their corre-
sponding DNA extraction and PCR negative controls. If a genus was present in the
negative control with more than 5-fold the number of sequencing reads than the
total reads across the samples, it was immediately removed. Otherwise, the reads
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
per sample were scrutinised, and if the number of reads within at least one sample
were 5 fold higher, that genus remained.
Identification of Target Genera
Target genera were defined as those that were identified from research papers in
Chapter 3, along with those identified in a paper specific to ball pythons that I co-
authored (DCruze et al., 2020a) (Table D.2, Appendix D). These genera were iden-
tified in the sequencing data using the tidyverse package (Wickham et al., 2019b)
within the program R (R Core Team, 2020).
5.3.4 Beta Diversity Analysis
Bray-curtis was the index used for the construction of dissimilarity matrices pro-
duced using the package Vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020), prior to performing non-
metric multidimensional scaling (Oksanen et al., 2020) and hierarchical clustering
analyses (base R "stacks" package, (R Core Team, 2020)). Prior to performing these
analyses, samples were normalised by converting the number of reads per genus
within samples to percentage composition. Permutational multivariate analysis of
variance (PERMANOVA) was also conducted on the dissimilarity matrix.
5.3.5 Core Microbiota
A core microbiota for each trip was determined for both runs. Genera were ini-
tially deemed part of the core microbiota if they were present within a given sam-
ple type across all farms within the same trip to contain more than one sample
corresponding to that sample type. However, due to some farms containing very
limited samples of a given sample type, farms were excluded from the analysis if
they contained a single sample of a given sample type.

5.4 Results
5.4.1 Sequencing Depth and Data Cleaning
All samples from both runs plateaued on the rarefaction curves, suggesting ade-
quate sequencing depth (Fig. D.2 - Fig. D.3, Appendix D). Genera and samples
containing less than 32 and 316 sequencing reads were removed for run 1 data (Fig.
D.4, Appendix D). The corresponding numbers for run 2 were 32 and 100 reads
respectively (Fig. D.5, Appendix D).
5.4.2 Sample Type Richness, Diversity and Evenness
Sample Richness
Whilst 330 and 473 genera were isolated from snakes and feeder rodents respec-
tively for run 1, the corresponding figures for run 2 were 161 and 252. This differ-
ence in the number of genera between runs is reflected in the analyses performed
for both runs accordingly; whereas the most genera in a given sample for run 1 was
142 (mouse-faecal sample-type), the corresponding figure for run 2 was a little over
half of that at 74 (mouse-oral sample type).

FIGURE 5.1: Richness, diversity and evenness boxplots for each
sample type for run 1 (A, C and E) and run 2 (B, D and F).
A consistent trend within and across runs was that rodent-associated samples con-
tained higher median genera per sample compared to snake-associated samples
(Fig. 5.1A:B). This difference was most apparent between mouse-faecal and snake-
oral samples, which contained the highest and lowest median number of genera
for both runs. Following on from this, rodent-associated samples additionally pos-
sessed larger interquartile ranges and maximum values of sample richness snake-
associated sample types for both runs, although the difference was amplified for
run 2.
ANOVA analysis generated statistically significant p values for animal and sample
types for run 1 (p = 2.2 x 10-16 and 0.005 respectively) and animal type only for run 2
(6.28 x 10-9). An interaction between animal and sample type was ruled out for both
runs (p = 0.86 and 0.37 for runs 1 and 2 respectively). Farm had a greater random
effect on the data compared to trip for both runs, acoounting for 2.74 % and 5.91 %
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
of the variance for runs 1 and 2 respectively. The residual variance once farm and
trip had been considered was 95.6 % and 93.0 % for runs 1 and 2 respectively.
Simpsons Diversity
Median Simpsons Diversity scores ranged from 0.78 - 0.90 for run 1 and 0.72 -
0.84 for run 2, indicating that half of all sample types exhibit moderate to high
diversity (Fig. 5.1: C and D). Rodent-associated samples had the highest median
Simpson scores, with an average median Simpsons diversity score of 0.9 and 0.84
for runs 1 and 2 respectively. Intra-species median diversity scores were closer
in value in rodent compared to snake sample types. Whilst mouse-oral samples
were consistently the most diverse sample type, the hierarchy of snake-associated
samples was inconsistent across runs.
ANOVA analysis mirrored the results generated for sample richness, with statis-
tically significant p values for animal and sample types for run 1 (p = 2.30 x 10-4
and 4.73 x 10-3 respectively) and animal type only for run 2 (5.84 x 10-4). The mixed
effects models
As with species richness, farm was shown to have a degree of random effects, ac-
counting for 9.12 % and 4.83 % of variation for runs 1 and 2 respectively. Trip did
not have any influence for both runs. Whilst the p value for animal and site was
statistically significant for run 1, only animal was statistically significant for run 2.
Pielous Evenness
Median Pielous Evenness scores ranged from 0.60 to 0.75 and 0.71 to 0.77 for runs
1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 5.1E - F). Similarly to the Simpsons diversity scores, the
three sample types with the most comparable median scores were the mouse and
SO sample types. SO samples had the highest median Pielous Evenness score.
The median Pielous Evenness scores were comparable between mouse samples,
whereas there was a substantial difference between the snake samples. The sample
type with a notably smaller range in scores compared to the other types was MO,
suggesting that these samples are more even. In contrast, the sample type with
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
the largest range in scores, in conjunction with the lowest median score, was SF,
indicating that this sample type contained samples featuring dominant genera.
The random effects of farm accounted for 13.5 % of the variation in run 1 and 5.0
% for run 2. Following on from this, animal, site and animal:site interaction all had
statistically silgnificant p values for run 1. Only animals generated a statistically
significant p value for run 2.
5.4.3 Dominant genera for all animal sample types
The results of the top 20 genera with the most reads for each sample type are dis-
played in Fig 5.2. The most abundant genus was the same across runs for rodent-
associated samples; Helicobacter_C and Rodentibacter were the genera with the high-
est number of reads for mouse-faecal and mouse-oral samples respectively, for both
runs, although the number of reads were approximately 5- and 1.6-fold higher in
run 1 relative to run 2. A common pattern observed in the data for all four sample
types, regardless of run, was that counts followed a negative exponential, with the
first genus often containing substantially higher reads than the rest. The extend of
the curve was reflected by the evenness scores, with snake-faecal and snake oral
displaying the most dominant pattern for runs 1 and 2 respectively.

5.4.4 Cluster Analysis
Samples broadly clustered by sample-type, regardless of run or trip (Fig. 5.3).
Whilst snake-associated samples did not appear to cluster on a farm basis for ei-
ther run, this was partly true for rodent-associated samples, although the extent of
this clustering pattern varied on farm, sample site and sequencing run levels. For
example, whilst there was a large cluster containing the majority of mouse-faecal
samples from farm 3 within run 1, mouse-oral samples corresponding to the same
farm and run were clustered less distinctly. The clustering of mouse-oral samples
from farm 3 was more obscure in run 2. Although snake-associated samples gen-
erally did not cluster with rodent-associated samples, there are exceptions to this
within both runs. The majority of these samples originate from farms 3 and 5.

5.4.5 Common Genera
Overall, 537 unique genera were isolated from all animal samples. Over half of
these (285, 53.1 %) of these were shared between snakes and mice. There were gen-
era common to body sites on an intra- and inter-species basis (Table 1). There were
shared genera between all sample type pairings (Table 5.2). The highest percentage
of shared genera (relative to the total number of unique genera for a pair combi-
nation) was 62.1 %, corresponding to the MO:MF pair, whilst the lowest was 30.5
%, corresponding to SO:SF. The oral and faecal pairings contained 44.5 % and 38.5
% respectively. Finally, the MO:SF and MF:SO pairs contained 38.5 % and 40.4 %
respectively.

Overall, 294 unique genera were isolated from all animal samples for run 2. Just
over two-fifths of these (125, 42.5 %) were shared between snakes and mice.
There were shared genera between all sample type pairings (Table 5.2). The highest
percentage of shared genera (relative to the total number of unique genera for a pair
combination) was 50 %, corresponding to the MO:MF pair, whilst the lowest was
26.1 %, corresponding to MO:SF. The oral and faecal pairings contained 36.4 % and
29.1 % respectively. Finally, the MO:SF and MF:SO pairs contained 26.1 % and 38.6
% respectively.

5.4.6 Potentially Pathogenic Genera
Overall
Thirty-three and twenty-eight target genera were detected across the samples in
runs 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 5.6). A higher proportion of target genera were
present across all four sample types for run 1 compared to run 2. Overall, the ma-
jority of target genera were present in at least two sample types regardless of run.
There was a high degree of overlap of target genera across both runs, as indicated
by the green labels (n = 27). However, Mycobacterium, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Pseu-
domonas, Rhodococcus and Weeksella were unique to run 1, whilst Elizabethkingia was
unique to run 2.

Animal-Specific Target Genera
The majority of target genera were present across both key species for run 1 (n = 24)
and run 2 (n = 22). Both runs featured animal-specific target genera. For run 1, Bacil-
lus, Brachyspira, Moraxella, Streptobacillus and Actinobacillus were specific to feeder
rodents, whilst Citrobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Shewanella were specific
to snakes. For run 2, Brachyspira and Actinobacillus were specific to feeder rodents,
whilst Shewanella, Vibrio, Elizabethkingia and Tsukmurella were snake-specific.

5.4.7 Core Microbiomes
There were 83 and 86 core genera for trips 1 and 2 respectively for run 1 (Fig. 5.7).
The corresponding numbers for run 2 were and 49 and 47 (Fig. 5.8).

genera are indicated by red labels.
The distribution of members of the core microbiota across sample types was similar
for both runs (Fig. D.6, Appendix D). A minority of genera were present across all
four sample types, whilst the majority occurred in a single sample type. Despite
the similarity in trends across the runs, the number and identity of genera present
across all four sample types differed considerably. Whilst the trip 1 core microbiota
for run 1 contained six members that were unanimous across the sample types
- Brachybacterium, Brevibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Lysobacter_B, Paracoccus and Sp-
ingobacterium - the trip one core for run 2 contained just two unanimous genera,
Paracoccus and Spingobacterium.
Whilst the distribution of genera across sample types for run 1 was similar to that
of trip 1, the distribution of trip 2 run 2 core microbiota differed in two main ways:

i) none of the core genera were present across all four sample types; and ii) the
proportion of genera present in a single sample type was greater than that for trip
1 from the same run and trip 2 from run 1.
Overall, rodents were associated with a greater proportion of the core microbiota
relative to snakes, regardless of trip and run . Furthermore, whilst the sample type
containing the greatest proportion of core genera was mouse-oral for trip one across
both runs, mouse-faecal predominated across both runs for trip 2 (appendix).
Presence of Target Genera within the Core microbiome
Trip 1 There were 15 and 7 target genera present within the trip 1 core microbiota
for runs 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 5.7 and 5.8). Overall, rodent-associated sam-
ples contained more target genera than snake-associated samples for both runs; 13
vs. 6 for run 1 and 6 vs. 2 for run 2 (Fig. D.7). Mouse-oral was the sample-type
containing the highest number of genera for both runs (11 and 6 for runs 1 and 2 re-
spectively). Brevibacterium, Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus were present in at least
three and two sample types within runs 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. D.8, Appendix
Trip 2 There were 12 and 6 target genera present within the trip 2 core microbiota
for runs 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 5.7 and 5.8). Overall, rodent-associated samples
contained more target genera than snake-associated samples for both runs; 11 vs. 4
for run 1 and 5 vs. 2 for run 2 (Fig. D.7). Mouse-oral was the sample-type contain-
ing the joint highest number of genera, along with mouse-faecal samples, for both
runs (10 and 4 for runs 1 and 2 respectively). Brevibacterium and, Acinetobacter were
present in at least three samples for run 1, whilst Staphylococcus was the only target
genus present within three samples for run 2 (Fig. D.8, Appendix D).

5.5 Discussion
5.5.1 Data Overview
Rarefaction curves
Whilst the the plateauing of the rarefaction curves for all samples in both runs
suggested that the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the majority of in-
formation for each sample, it should be noted that the scales reached for both runs
differed considerably. Whilst the maximum number of reads surpassed 25, 000 for
run 1, the corresponding number for run 2 was approximately half of this at just
over 12, 000. Similarly, the number of species for run 1 was approximately dou-
ble that for run 2. It is for this reason that the runs were processed separately.
This finding gave insight into the complexities of using 16S amplicon sequencing
data, including the pitfalls. If only the results of the second sequencing run were
available, it would be reasonable, given the rarefaction curves, to conclude that
only a handful of target genera were present across the samples. Subsequently,
care should be taken to acknowledge that the absence of sequencing reads corre-
sponding to a genus is not a guarantee of absolute absence, as other authors have
previously pointed out (Hugerth and Andersson, 2017). Furthermore, it is not pos-
sible to accurately calculate the true relative abundance of these target genera (or
any other genus) within the characterised communities due to the caveats associ-
ated with 16S gene copy numbers (discussed in Chapter 6) (Louca, Doebeli, and
Parfrey, 2018).
Sample Type Richness, Diversity and Evenness
Although the scale, maximum values and interquartile range for sample richness
differed across runs, both had the consistent pattern of descending median val-
ues for mouse-faecal, mouse-oral, snake-faecal and snake-oral sample types respec-
tively. Whilst the ratio of interquartile range between mouse-faecal and mouse-oral
differed between runs, the range was largest for mouse-oral relative to the other
sample types for both runs, implying higher variability in the size of the mouse-
oral microbiota relative to the mouse-faecal microbiota. Whilst there are a number

of studies using rodent models for the study of human diseases (Walkenhorst et
al., 2020; Rautava et al., 2015; Boyer et al., 2020; Hsiao et al., 2019), there is not an
abundance of research on the oral microbiota of mice from a community charac-
terisation perspective at present; as other authors have previously acknowledged,
the primary research focus regarding microbial community characterisation in non-
human species is the gut (Matejkov et al., 2020). Geography has previously been
identified as an strongly influential parameter concerning the diversity of the in-
testinal microbiota of mice; it may therefore be possible to extrapolate these find-
ings to the oral microbiota.
Although it is challenging to discuss the diversity of the feeder rodent oral mi-
crobiota in relation to existing literature, a pertinent finding of this work is the
presence of target genera within the oral cavities of feeder rodents. Whilst this is
of less concern when the rodents are sold in frozen form, the rodents sampled at
the farm were live, and therefore have the capacity to inflict bite wounds on han-
dlers. Multiple pathogens have previously been associated with rodent bites be-
sides Streptobacillus moniliformis (Shvartsblat et al., 2004; Gaastra et al., 2009; Down-
ing, Dewnany, and Radford, 2001), including Corynebacterium kutscheri, Staphylococ-
cus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Leptospira interogans and Strep-
tococcus spp. (Himsworth et al., 2014). The genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus
and Streptococcus were present in feeder-rodent core oral microbiotas regardless of
trip or run. Further work would be required to determine if these genera contained
pathogenic species or were simply commensals.
Feeder rodent-associated samples additionally contained higher median diversity
scores relative to snakes, although the majority of samples from all types had mod-
erate to high diversity scores. This finding corroborates the indication of adequate
sequencing depth for these samples. Finally,the biggest difference between runs
was the Pielous evenness analysis. Whilst there are clear differences in the median
values between oral and faecal samples for snakes and mice in run 1, the median
score is comparable across all four sample types in run 2, although the snake-faecal
sample type possesses the lowest score for both runs. The apparent increase in
evenness in run 2 could be a result of the lower sequencing depth.
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
Despite the relative lack of diversity, however, the snake faecal samples addition-
ally had the lowest Pielous evenness score, indicating that these samples contained
some highly dominant members of the microbiota. Some of these trends were true
for run 2; rodent-associated samples possessed the highest median and maximum
Simpsons diversity scores and held higher median Pielous evenness scores than
snake-faecal samples. However, snake-oral samples replaced snake-faecal samples
with the lowest median and minimum diversity scores, in addition to comparable
median evenness scores as opposed to higher evenness as for run 1.
Finally, the differences in sequencing depth, richness, diversity and evenness be-
tween the runs is illustrated in the top twenty genera containing the most reads
for each sample type. Whereas the snake-faecal chart for run 1 demonstrates the
presence of few highly dominant genera, the proportion of genera containing very
few reads is reduced for run 2. Conversely, the decrease in diversity and evenness
for snake-oral samples for run 2 relative to run 1 is apparent by the increase in
proportion of genera containing few reads.
5.5.2 Sample Type Characteristics and Inter-relationships
Unsurprisingly, the highest percentages of shared genera between two sites was
for intraspecies samples for both runs. Conversely, the sample site pair yielding
the lowest amount of common genera was the snake-faecal-mouse-oral pair, also
for both runs. One of the most intriguing findings of the inter-relationship analysis
was the presence of genera common to the snake-oral-mouse-faecal sample pair,
since a subject of debate regarding the oral microbiota of snakes is that this may
contain faecal-associated microbes transferred during the consumption of prey, al-
though results in direct conflict with this notion have emerged from recent studies
(Goldstein et al., 1979; Zancolli et al., 2015). Although it is not possible to determine
if species are shared among these two communities from this work, it is worth not-
ing that 37.2 % and 37.0 % of all genera isolated from mouse-oral and snake-faecal
samples were shared. The fact that there are common genera between sample sites
may be a function of the sites in question. For example, genera common to snake-
and feeder rodent-oral cavities may be general oral bacterial, evolved for this niche.
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
It is harder to apply this logic to the snake-oral-mouse-faecal pair, however. There-
fore, although the absence of higher taxonomic resolution means that it is difficult
to determine the significance of this finding, it does provide a basis upon which to
explore this topic further, and the transfer of faecal genera into the oral cavity of
snakes cannot be ruled out.
The differential impact of farm on clustering of snake-associated samples compared
to feeder rodent-associated samples could be due to multiple factors. One possible
explanation is the difference in the species richness range between the two key
species, which itself could be due to inter-farm environmental differences - with
more hygienic or less crowded farms harbouring feeder rodents containing fewer
members within their oral and faecal microbiotas. Alternatively, interfarm differ-
ences may be caused by differences in feeder rodent supplier. Another angle for
interpretation is that snakes are less easily distinguished by farm due to contain-
ing smaller microbiotas with less variation coupled by the presence of dominant
member of their microbiotas, as indicated by the difference in the Simpsons diver-
sity score range relative to feeder rodents along with generally lower community
evenness.
The sample types broadly clustered independently of each other on a farm, trip
and run level. The extent of the dissimilarity between groups was variable across
these factors. The smallest difference between sample types in these cases was gen-
erally held between snake-oral and snake-faecal samples; where this was not the
case, the snake-oral samples held more similarity than the snake-faecal samples.
One explanation for this could be the sample timing: those farms featuring sim-
ilarities between snakes and mice could have contained snakes that had recently
fed on rodents prior to sampling. An alternative explanation could be the farm
conditions, with less hygienic or adequately spacious farms predisposing shared
microbial communities.
There was a distinct variation in the degree of dissimilarity between the farms de-
pendent on sample type. Furthermore, there was a substantial difference in the
clustering for snake- and rodent-associated samples, with the latter displaying a
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
higher degree of dissimilarity for both runs and trips. A plausible explanation for
this could lie in the origin of the feeder rodents, which those from different sup-
pliers possessing differing microbiota composition. This could additionally be a
factor in the magnitude and range of diversity and evenness displayed for rodent-
associated samples.
There was a low to very-low degree of dissimilarity between trips across farms.
Instead, samples generally clustered by sample-type over trip, although the extent
of this was variable across the farms and runs. For example, whilst farm 3 appeared
to have the greatest average distance between the two trips for run 1, it was the
reverse for run 2. This could be an artifact of the reduced sequencing depth of run
2 resulting in the absence of distinguishing members of the microbiota.
There was a lesser degree of dissimilarity between trips of snake-associated sam-
ples compared to rodent-associated samples for both runs. The sample points
were so closely clustered for snake-associated samples it was difficult to determine
if samples instead clustered on a farm basis, as was largely the case for rodent-
associated samples.
5.5.3 Presence of Target Genera and Core Microbiotas
As previously stated, it is not possible to ascertain the pathogenicity potential from
the putative genus-level identification offered in this project. Instead, focus should
be on if the findings justify further investigation. With this in mind, fifteen of the
thirty-three target genera identified in run 1 were present across all four sample-
types, with a further six and nine present across three and two sample types re-
spectively (Table D.1, Appendix D).
Following on from this, target genera were among those genera consistently present
within sample types across farms (and hence multiple individuals), cautiously re-
ferred to here as the core microbiota. The idea of defining these communities was
to add weight to the presence of target genera, the theory being that genera that are
consistently present within these samples are less likely to be there by chance. In
line with this theory, the fact that so many of the target genera were part of the core
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
microbiotas is an important finding. It is not practical to go into individual detail
explaining the nuance of this for each target genus, therefore Acinetobacter will be
used as an example.
Acinetobacter was consistently present across multiple sample type core microbio-
tas (Fig. D.8, Appendix D). Currently, this genus contains 59 species (Vijayaku-
mar, Biswas, and Veeraraghavan, 2019). Although Acinetobacter baumannii has been
frequently reported in a clinical context due to its notoriety as a successful noso-
comial pathogen (Lee et al., 2017; Morris et al., 2019; Hamidian and Nigro, 2019),
it is not the only Acinetobacter species capable of causing human infection (Chusri
et al., 2014). The other four pathogenic species, which are included with A. bau-
mannii in the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumanni complex, are Acine-
tobacter pittii, Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter seifertti and Acinetobacter dijk-
shoorniae (Vijayakumar, Biswas, and Veeraraghavan, 2019). The role of A. calcoaceti-
cus within an infection context is yet to be fully elucidated (Mancilla-Rojano et al.,
2020). The health burden imposed by the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter
baumanni complex, with an estimated 1 million annual cases globally (Gales et al.,
2019), warrants confirmation of the species identity of Acinetobacter isolated from
the key species within this project. This is true for all of the target genera, as they
all have the potential to harbour zoonotic pathogens.
5.6 Conclusion
In conclusion, I successfully met the objectives set out at the beginning of this chap-
ter. Using rarefaction curves, I was able to conclude that the sequencing depth
was adequate across both sample sets/runs. Furthermore, I determined charac-
teristics of the bacterial communities associated with each of the sample types, in-
cluding richness, diversity and evenness. Rodent-associated samples consistently
had higher median scores for all three characteristics, regardless of run. Other key
themes present across both runs include: i) The sample type containing the great-
est median sample richness was mouse-faecal, whilst the snake-oral sample type
possessed the lowest; ii) mouse-faecal and mouse-oral samples had comparable
Chapter 5. Bacterial Community Composition of Ball Pythons and Feeder
Rodents from Breeding Farms in Togo, West Africa
median diversity scores; and iii) mouse-oral samples contained the highest me-
dian evenness score. Finally, the top twenty genera containing the most sequencing
reads was established for each sample type.
Clustering analysis addressed the second objective, which aimed to determine re-
lationships based on farm, sample type and trip. This revealed that the majority
of samples clustered based on sample type, indicating that each body site pos-
sesses a distinct microbiota, although the communities associated with feeder ro-
dents clustered less closely compared to snake-associated samples. This is in agree-
ment with the higher species richness and evenness scores displayed by rodent-
associated samples, and illustrates that feeder-rodent microbiota are less conserved
- and therefore predictable - than those associated with ball pythons. Although ball
python samples did not cluster based on farm, feeder-rodent samples did to a de-
gree. It can therefore be hypothesised from this finding that the rodents present in
the farms were derived from different sources, and therefore the zoonotic potential
associated with these rodents should be analysed on a case-by-case basis. Sam-
ples did not appear to cluster by trip, suggesting that the microbiotas do not differ
substantially across the breeding season. Analyses revealed that there are shared
genera between all sample type combinations.
Finally, the work in this chapter succeeded in illustrating that i) a large number of
target genera were present across the samples, ii) there were genera consistently
present across farms for each of the sample types; and iii) these core communities
contained target genera. Finally, a greater number of target genera were present
in rodent-associated core communities, indicating that feeder rodents have greater
zoonotic potential in relation to ball pythons. However, more research involving
techniques that are able to accurately identify bacterial to species level is required
to confirm these initial findings.

Conclusions and Future Work
6.1 Conclusions
6.1.1 Thesis Achievements
1. I successfully developed a robust and sensitive DNA extraction method ca-
pable of extracting DNA from low-biomass swab samples. This was achieved
through the design and execution of limit of detection experiments involving
commercial DNA extraction kits and traditional phenol-chloroform solvent-
based extraction. The results showed that there was a clear difference in the
sensitivity of phenol-chloroform extraction. However, to ensure that these re-
sults were reliable, they were validated through the application of the chosen
technique to samples that were representative of the real-world conditions -
and hence biomass - of the planned project samples.
2. In addition to successfully isolating DNA from all three surfaces sampled,
the DNA was also proven to be amplifiable through PCR. The first PCR step
required optimisation to ensure consistently successful amplification.
3. I performed an in-depth systematic literature review to determine bacteria as-
sociated with pet shops. This enabled me to curate a list of bacterial zoonotic
genera, which were used as target genera in the corresponding pet shop se-
quencing chapter, in addition to gaining a broad overview of zoonotic disease

risks, case studies of illness arising from pet shops and zoonotic risk knowl-
edge and perception in relation to pet shops.
4. I applied the DNA extraction and library preparation techniques I previously
designed and optimised to environmental swab samples taken from a range
of surfaces within a pet shop. Characterisation revealed that target genera
were present across all samples with the exception of the light switch, which
did not contain sufficient reads for analysis. This finding justifies both the
present and future research into the zoonotic risks posed by pet shops
5. I characterised bacterial communities associated with ball pythons and feeder
rodents, in addition to detecting the presence of target genera within all sam-
ple types (oral and cloacal swabs from ball pythons and oral and rectal swabs
from feeder rodents). The work associated with this chapter led to multiple
conclusions, including: the finding that feeder rodents may harbour more
zoonotic pathogens compared to ball pythons, although target genera were
present within both species.
6. I have co-authored two publications in relation to my project, and intend to
publlish more in the future based on Chapters 3, 4 and 5.
6.1.2 Discussion
Pet Shop-Associated Risks - Literature Review
Starting with the systematic literature review performed in Chapter 3, a broad
range of pathogenic bacteria were identified from existing research based on pet
shops. The genus with the highest number of corresponding research papers was
Salmonella. However, it should be noted that, as with many of the publications re-
turned by the literature review, there was a strong research bias. Many of the papers
reporting the presence of Salmonella were solely investigating the presence of this
bacterium within samples. Even in cases where the methods did not directly tar-
get Salmonella, the samples involved, such as faeces, were strongly associated with
enteric bacteria Sigirci et al., 2019. It is therefore unsurprising that Salmonella was
present in these samples. Further to this point, other genera that were associated
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 114
with multiple research papers, such as Aeromonas, Citrobacter and Escherichia, were
also enteric in nature. This is likely a result of the sample types included in these
studies, which were typically direct (the animals themselves, their faecaes or their
immediate environment) Seepersadsingh and Adesiyun, 2003; Ylmaz and Dolar,
2017; Ylmaz and Gvensen, 2016; Dupont et al., 2013. Samples from these origins
are not as pertinent from a public point of view, since unless purchasing or han-
dling an animal, they are less likely to come into contact with these organisms as
opposed to those that are present on widely accessible surfaces, such as cage exteri-
ors. As a result, although the systematic literature review provided a good starting
point, the full elucidation of the zoonotic risks posed by pet shops requires a non-
targeted approach, such as the sequencing of swabs performed in this project, to
provide an unbiased perspective.
The case reports found through the literature review were able to provide some in-
sight into the zoonotic risks posed by pets shops in real-life scenarios, although the
number of case reports appears to have decreased over recent years. From these,
the most prominent infection was psittacosis. A probable explanation for this is
the mode of transmission of the causative agent, Chlamydia psittaci. Unlike the
majority of bacterial zoonotic pathogens identified in the literature review, which
are commonly transmitted via wounds or the faecal-oral route Mastroianni, 2003;
Brown-Elliott and Philley, 2017; Gerba, 2009, Chlamydia psittaci transmission can be
airborne Rybarczyk et al., 2019. Subsequently, direct contact with the animals or
their enclosures is not necessary for establishment of psittacosis infection. To mit-
igate this risk to the public and pet shop workers, a strong understanding of the
disease, its presentations, mode of transmission and ways of reducing the likeli-
hood of aerosol formation and hence transmission needs to be present within all
pet shop staff. Reduction in aerosol transmission may be achieved through excel-
lent husbandry practices, such as regular removal of faeces in bird cages, along
with identification and subsequent isolation of birds showing signs of illness De-
schuyffeleer et al., 2012. Another high-profile zoonotic risk identified in pet shops
was rat bite fever (RBF). Although this was not as prevalent as psittacosis, it pre-
sented with higher morbidity and mortality. If left untreated, this infection can be
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 115
fatal, as evidenced by one of the case reports Shvartsblat et al., 2004. Furthermore,
the most concerning finding from the RBF case reports was evidence for the lack of
knowledge and understanding of this disease by individuals across the pet trade
and healthcare sectors. This will be discussed in more detail under the need for
policy subsection.
Pet Shop-Associated Risks - Pet Shop Sequencing
The findings from the sequencing of the pet shop samples infer that there is the
potential for there to be a notable level of bacterial zoonotic risk posed by pub-
licly accessible surfaces within the pet shop environment. As acknowledged in the
limitations section below, 16S Amplicon Sequencing is not able to reliably identify
sequences to the species level. Due to the ambiguity of genus-level identification,
it is therefore not possible to definitely label the genera identified as pathogenic;
however, this also cannot be ruled out. The finding that approximately a tenth of
the genera identified from the sequencing were previously isolated in the pet shop
literature review, and that many of these genera were present in half or more of
the samples and/or accounted for more than 1 % of the sequencing reads, demon-
strates the need to investigate these surfaces further. This is reinforced by the find-
ing that the bacterial communities from inside the guinea pig cage, on the cage
exterior and on the shelf below the cage clustered. This suggests that bacteria
are transferred from the inside of the cage to the external surfaces nearby. Sub-
sequently, if there are pathogens present within the cages, it is possible for them to
also be transferred, increasing the risk of disease to the public.
Togo Samples
Similarly to the above, it is not within the scope of this project to definitely state
the pathogenicity of the genera isolated from the ball pythons and feeder rodents.
However, it is possible to discuss the relative pathogenicity potential presented by
ball pythons and feeder rodents. In addition to containing a greater median num-
ber of genera within their microbiotas, feeder rodent core microbiotas contained
up to three times as many target genera compared to those for the ball pythons.
Mathematically-speaking, there is therefore a higher probability of feeder rodents
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 116
harbouring potentially pathogenic bacteria relative to ball pythons. Furthermore,
one of the genera identified from feeder rodent samples was Streptobacillus. This
genus contains the causative agent for RBF, Streptobacillus moniliformis. In future
work, it would therefore be important to determine the species identity of the Strep-
tobacillus isolates, in addition to their prevalence and abundance within feeder ro-
dent samples, since this could be a considerable health risk to individuals at the
breeding farms, along with those further down the line, such as pet shop staff and
buyers.
Policy
The findings of this project highlight not only the need for further research, but for
the addressment of the bacterial zoonotic risks posed by the pet trade. This begins
with cross-sector education and communication of these risks, enforced by policy
changes. These need to encompass pet shop workers, breeders supplying animals
to the pet trade, veterinarians, healthcare workers and the public. It is vital that
the knowledge of zoonotic risks is universal across these groups, as one broken
link could be the difference between life and death. This was illustrated by the
pet shop worker who experienced a fatal case of RBF Shvartsblat et al., 2004. Had
there been a greater awareness of the risks posed by this infection, along with trans-
mission routes, it could have been possible to prevent the injury from occurring in
the first instance through the use of PPE - the infection was contracted through an
abrasion caused by the cage housing the rats, so gloves would have been appropri-
ate. Secondly, neither he nor his employer appeared to recognise the seriousness
of the resulting infection, inferred from the fact that the patient sought discharge
from hospital early on in the course of the infection. Finally, despite the knowl-
edge of the occupation of the worker, the healthcare provider did not refer to the
work injury responsible for the infection in the patient notes, in addition to failing
to recognise the wound during examination of that area. Subsequently, a correct
diagnosis was not made in the initial consultation, resulting in a return visit and
emergency surgery following disease progression.

6.2 Limitations
6.2.1 Overview
This section encompasses the limitations encountered within this project. As the
primary chapter of interest, the majority of the limitations discussed focus on the
work performed in chapter 5.
6.2.2 16S Amplicon Sequencing
Amplicon sequencing is undoubtedly a powerful tool for providing an insight into
complex microbial communities, reflected by its labelling as the gold standard
by some scientists (Starke, Pylro, and Morais, 2021). However, it is important to
understand the technical limitations of this technique, the primary one being the
taxonomic resolution it provides. Whilst it is able to offer greater sequencing depth
relative to traditional techniques, such as Sanger sequencing (Amend, Seifert, and
Bruns, 2010), amplicons produced by workflows using the MiSeq are less than 300
bp long. This short sequence may be identical between closely-related species, lim-
iting the taxonomic resolution it can provide (Janda and Abbott, 2007; Johnson
et al., 2019). This was illustrated within the study by (Gupta et al., 2019): it was
not possible to discern between Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus au-
reus when only the V4 region was used. Furthermore, the performance of the nine
hypervariable regions in the detection of certain genera differs, meaning that selec-
tion of the variable region is application-specific (Chakravorty et al., 2007; Johnson
et al., 2019). Since this project began, a critical review of the practice of amplifying
a portion of the gene, now that "Availability of third-generation sequencing tech-
nologies means that high-throughput sequencing of the full 16S gene is becoming
commonplace" was published (Johnson et al., 2019). However, despite this criti-
cism, amplicon sequencing remains to be the most frequently adopted technique
reported in the literature (Starke, Pylro, and Morais, 2021). Furthermore, the sub-
section of the 16S gene used in this project has been applied to notable projects,
such as the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) (Thompson et al., 2017), in addition to
being cited as one of the most reliable and representative subregions (Yang, Wang,
and Qian, 2016).
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 118
Despite these limitations, amplicon sequencing remains advantageous over tradi-
tional culture methods (TCM). This were illustrated by a study that compared the
performance of TCM to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for bacterial community
characterisation of faecal and hypopharyngeal samples (Gupta et al., 2019). Am-
plicon sequencing was able to identify significantly more species per sample than
TCM  the maximum number of species identified from a sample using amplicon
sequencing was 17.5-fold higher than the equivalent value for TCM. The secondary
sequencing analysis consisted of creating a non-redundant reference database for
the purpose of closed-reference OTU picking. This was performed by using the
type-strain sequencing, acquired from the RDP database, for all species that had
been cultured in the study. Even with this system, amplicon sequencing displayed
significantly higher sensitivity than TCM, which displayed bias towards species
with a high relative abundance. Therefore, although it is not possible to avoid the
introduction of biases imposed by any technique, it can be concluded that the use
of 16S amplicon sequencing within this project conferred advantages over TCM,
and was more suitable for the project aims of characterising bacterial communities
present in ball pythons and feeder rodents.
6.2.3 16S Gene Copy Numbers
Another aspect of amplicon sequencing to be taken into consideration is the suit-
ability of the widely adopted approach of using amplicon sequencing variant (ASV)
read counts to determine the relative proportions of bacterial taxa within commu-
nities. This is skewed by the variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene copy num-
bers (16S GCNs), which may range from 1 to 15 within different organisms(Case
et al., 2007; Louca, Doebeli, and Parfrey, 2018; Vetrovsky and Baldrian, 2013). In re-
sponse to this, there have been previous attempts to mitigate this bias through the
application of tools that estimate the 16S GCNs within ASVs and scale the num-
ber of counts accordingly. Three of these developed tools - PICRUSt(Langille et al.,
2013), CopyRighter(Angly et al., 2014) and PAPRICA(Bowman and Ducklow, 2015)
- were evaluated in the study by (Louca, Doebeli, and Parfrey, 2018). The authors
concluded that the issue of variable 16S GCNs remains unresolved, with a minority
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 119
of microbiomes displaying successful copy number correction following the appli-
cation of the tools. This conclusion was corroborated by the recent investigation by
Starke et al. (2020). Using a range of mock communities, the authors demonstrated
that the classification for the majority of these did not benefit from GCN (Starke,
Pylro, and Morais, 2021). From the collective results of these studies, it can be con-
cluded that the classification of sequencing data in this project is unlikely to have
been improved through GCN.
6.2.4 Reference Databases
The reference database used in this project was the Genome Taxonomy Database
(GTDB), which at present contains 12, 037 and 45, 555 reference sequences at the
bacterial genera and species level respectively (GTDB, 2021). The choice of refer-
ence database used within a bioinformatics pipeline has the potential to impact the
results and introduce bias (Lpez-Garca et al., 2018; Sierra et al., 2020). This was
demonstrated in a study comparing the performance of the Silva and GreenGenes
databases across two different bioinformatic pipelines, mothur and QIIME (Lpez-
Garca et al., 2018). Relative abundance of amplicons was a factor for difference in
performance of both the pipeline used (mothur vs QIIME) and reference database
(GreenGenes vs Silva). The number of OTUs clustered, along with genera, was
higher for mothur than for QIIME for both databases. However, the differences
were greater when using GreenGenes compared to Mothur, illustrating the impact
the database can have on the conclusions. As there is currently no standardisa-
tion on the processing of sequencing data, including reference database, there is
no right or wrong answer. Instead, reference database influence on secondary se-
quencing analysis, particularly for less abundant taxa which are more affected rel-
ative to highly abundant taxa (Lpez-Garca et al., 2018; Sierra et al., 2020), needs
to be taken into account during analysis and interpretation of results. The GTDB
utilises two comprehensive and well-established resources for the construction of
phylogeny: GenBank (Clark et al., 2016) and RefSeq (OLeary et al., 2016). Fi-
nally, GTDB includes draft genomes of uncultured microorganisms obtained from
metagenomes and single cells, ensuring improved genomic representation of the
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 120
microbial world (Parks et al., 2020). It is therefore a suitable reference data base for
use in this project.
However, use of the GTDB database did present some challenges. One of these re-
lated to the notation used with the reference database. For some genera, an alpha-
betical suffix was appended to the name. This prevented a positive match occurring
when selecting genera using the list of literature genera. The reason for the alter-
ation is that these genera have been recognised as genera that "are i) polyphyletic
according to the current GTDB reference tree, or ii) subdivided based on taxonomic
rank normalisation according to the current GTDB reference tree" (GTDB, N.D.). It
was therefore unclear how to proceed with the processing of these genera. As the
nature of the data already contains an element of uncertainty, including these gen-
era within the analysis felt like it would undermine the validity of the results; they
were therefore excluded.
Another issue with the GTDB notation is the naming of some genera by a strain
name. This is explained by GTDB as "a placeholder for the genus name when
there is no existing genus name and no binomially named representative genome".
The example used to illustrate this is a genome that has been assigned as a Pre-
votella species by NCBI. However, the authors/creators of the GTDB argue that
the genome is more related to other genera; therefore, it is referred to by a strain
identifier to avoid committing to any genera. This discrepancy between NCBI and
GTDB lessens the taxonomic resolution in these cases, and presents opportunities
for information, albeit uncertain, to be missed. There were 16 of these placeholder
genera across the sample set, of which 5 potentially corresponded to target genera.
Furthermore, the genus accounting for the greatest proportion of reads overall was
one such genus, Leaf454. When investigating this genus, no consistent result was
present across different sources (Table 6.1). It is therefore not possible to comment
on the significance of this genus.

6.2.5 Systematic Quantitative Literature Review
The performance of the systematic review in chapter 3 was relatively straightfor-
ward. However, an issue that arose in the early stages of the paper selection pro-
cess was that different search options within a database sometimes did not return
the same number of results despite using identical search terms. For example,
whilst the basic search function in Web of Science returned two publications, the
advanced search did not return any. Retrieving the maximum potential from a
database therefore required experimentation with the format and search functions
for each database.
Another limitation presented by this chapter was the large proportion of studies
presenting a research bias, resulting in under- and over-representation at the ani-
mal and microbe level and therefore distorting the zoonotic risks presented by pet
shops accordingly. One of the few studies that specifically sampled the pet shop en-
vironment did not provide bacterial identification, limiting the scope of the study
to airborne bacterial count data (Jo and Kang, 2006). Although this is an important
start, it is not possible to use this information to make any informative conclusions
about the degree of zoonotic health risks imposed by these bacteria. The sampling
of a variety of pet shop surfaces within this project, many of which the public were
likely to come into contact with, therefore acts as an exploratory first step in the
determination of these risks.
Chapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 122
6.3 Future Work
The findings of this project clearly demonstrate that ball pythons and their asso-
ciated feeder rodents have to potential to possess a range of potential zoonotic
pathogens of importance to public health. Subsequently, future work would use
the broad community composition findings to characterise the target genera to at
least species level. Since there are a large number of species - along with species
characteristics - to consider, a technique that provides species-level determination
in tandem with relatively high-throughput capacity would be key to achieving this
goal with the same or greater number of samples included in this project. Whatever
the chosen techniques, the complexity of assessing zoonotic potential demands a
multistage approach to address the multifaceted nature of bacteria. For example, a
basic approach to answer the question are there target species, and if so, are they
present in numbers that constitute an infection risk if virulence and/or antimicro-
bial markers are present is displayed in Figure 6.1.

Multiplex PCR, featured in the above illustrated approach, could be an option due
to the fact that it would enable detection of multiple species simultaneously. This
would be of particular utility for target genera containing a large number of species,
such as Pseudomonas. Alternatively, multiplex PCRs can be used to detect multiple

targets corresponding to a single species that presents technical identification dif-
ficulties when using a single gene fragment. Such an assay has been designed for
accurate and specific detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Salman, Ali, and Haque,
2013).
Once the presence of target bacterial species has been confirmed, other pertinent
questions arise, regarding key information such as quantity and virulence attributes.
Bacterial species identification is just one cog in the machine that is bacterial patho-
genesis. This is due to the fact that the pathogenic status of a species is not nec-
essarily static. A good example of this is Escherichia coli; on the one hand, this
species has a commensal role in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (Proena, Bar-
ral, and Gordo, 2017), whilst on the other hand, there are numerous classifications
of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains (Kaper, Nataro, and Mobley, 2004). To compli-
cate matters further, it is possible for a commensal E. coli strain to transition into a
pathogenic state under challenging conditions following the acquisition of a trans-
posable element insertion (Proena, Barral, and Gordo, 2017). The successful and
comprehensive assessment of the presence of pathogenic bacterial strains therefore
requires an in-depth knowledge and understanding of host-pathogen dynamics in
addition to genome plasticity for a given species, in addition to the application of
multiple assays that reflect the multifaceted nature of host-pathogen dynamics.

*where faecal matter is involved, only take sample if certain that it has originated from the animals 
of interest. May be best to omit in farms where there is mixing of species or serious over-crowding. 
Extra caution to be taken where bats are present, as these are carriers of serious pathogens such as 
rabies.  
** At farms where there are fruit bats present, please ask the handlers to avoid handling them 
directly prior to swabbing the hands. 
The above sampling regime will be applied to 3 farms  preferably of different scale  to provide a 
total of 500 samples. The numbers are the preferred target  particular the oral and cloacal/rectal 
type  however if it is not possible to reach this number, the surplus swabs could either be used to 
generate replicates or take a greater number of other sample types (i.e. more handlers).   
Consumables List 
2.0 ml Microcentrifuge Tubes. These have been autoclaved at MMU prior to the addition of 700 l 
aliquots of DNA/RNA Shield, a specialised lysis/preservation buffer. They are additionally sealed with 
parafilm. 
3 inch swabs in tubes. These come sterile, and will be used for taking the samples.  
Cryoboxes (10 x 10). For transport and storage of microcentrifuge tubes, pre- and post-sampling 
Parafilm. To be used to seal individual sample tubes, in addition to cryoboxes. 
Disinfectant  1 % Trigene. This is the specified disinfectant. Two spray bottles will beprovided, in 
addition to a bottle containing some/all of the disinfectant (to reduce risk of leaking).  
Paper towels/roll. For disinfecting with. 
Gloves. To be worn when handling animals and samples. 
Scissors. To cut swab shaft (plastic) during transferral of swab tip to 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  
Goggles. Should be worn when handling disinfectant and samples.  
Disinfection tablets. For disinfecting empty swab tubes prior to discarding, where sufficient 
water/facilities; otherwise spray with Trigene. 
*text in red indicates not supplied by Jodie Barber 
SOP for taking samples 
1. Ensure correct PPE is in place. 
2. Prepare swab tubes; label accordingly (e.g. Snake 1, Faecal). Ensure all tubes are clearly 
labelled and within easy reach. At the same time, label microcentrifuge tubes accordingly 
(e.g. FxSx/FxMx/FxHx, where F denotes farm, S snake, M mouse, H human and x is the 
number)  
3. Secure snake, preferably with the assistance of a handler.  
4. Take swabs: twirl swab tip in oral or cloacal/rectal cavity (e.g. for 10 seconds  as long as 
each sample is taken consistently, the exact time is not important), before returning swab to 
tube. For faecal sample, roll the swab tip over the matter; lightly shake to release any 
unattached matter. N.B. take care not to touch the sides of the swab tube with the swab 
5. When in a position to do so, transfer the swab tip from the original tube to a 
microcentrifuge tube. To do this, first ensure that corresponding tubes are labelled in 
accordance with the swab samples (as in step 1), then disinfect scissors using 
Trigene/disinfectant (N.B. must not use strong oxidising agents such as bleach or chlorine, 
since these are incompatible with DNA/RNA Shield and may therefore affect sample 
integrity. Ensure scissors have air-dried before using.). Once scissors are dry, open the 
appropriate microcentrifuge tube and slowly lower swab tip into tube, before cutting the 
swab shaft (~0.5 cm from swab tip).  
6. Once all swab tips have been transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, wipe down the outside 
of each tube with Trigene, in addition to spraying the inside of the cryobox. Individually seal 
each tube with parafilm, then close the box, wipe down with Trigene, seal with parafilm and 
wrap in an autoclave bag.  
Extra notes 
Please use the autoclave bag provided with each cryobox to separate the equipment (i.e. scissors, 
white roll, cryobox) from the environment. This will help avoid environmental contamination, in 
addition to reducing the likelihood of introducing anthrax spores, since these are mostly present 
within dust and soil. An extra cryobox has been included, which can be used as a rack when handling 
microcentrifuge tubes. Since these are so small (and there are many of them), they fall over very 
easily, therefore I recommend that for each set of swabs (from a mouse/snake/human), the tubes 
are placed in the spare box and the lids removed prior to transfer of the swab tip. They can then be 
capped, wiped down and sealed before returning to their original box. Alternatively, they could be 
capped and wiped down before returning, then the whole box can be sealed at a later time by 
transferring them to the empty once sealed. In that way, there will always be an empty box. Please 
do not place them outside of the box as they may roll around and get contaminated.   
Parafilm 
Parafilm is a stretchy film that can be used for sealing containers. It has been specified in the risk 
assessment that each sample tube (microcentrifuge tube) will be sealed, in addition to the outside of 
the cryobox.  
Parafilm has been pre-allocated, with two strips allocated per box, and labelled accordingly. The 
smaller strip is for sealing the outside of the cryotube, whilst the other strip is for the tubes (enough 
to cover 100 tubes). Extra parafilm has also been included. Please take care to not allow the parafilm 
to make contact with dirty surfaces, as this could present a biological hazard by trapping pathogens 
in the film  either use the autoclave bag provided or keep in a safe place until needed.  
The image below demonstrates how to divide the parafilm to cover 16 tubes:  
I recommend cutting into quarters (orange lines), then peeling off the backing paper  there is a gap 
at the edges (green lines) to make this easier  before cutting into the smaller pieces, as otherwise it 
can be tricky to separate from the backing.

Simple Summary: The Ball python is a small species that is commonly kept as an exotic pet across
the world. Despite huge numbers of these snakes being kept and traded in the pet industry, there is
very little information available about how catching, breeding, transporting and housing them in
captivity could impact their welfare. Our study reviewed the published literature for this species
and found 88 relevant peer-reviewed scientific papers. Physical health was the predominant focus of
research, with numerous studies reporting on disease, injury or clinical treatments. Far fewer papers
focused on other aspects of Ball python wellbeing, including behaviour, nutrition, environment or
mental condition. We also found that very few studies focused on wellbeing prior to pet ownership,
i.e., during the early stages of the trade chain when they are caught from the wild, transported, or
bred in captivity. We recommend that more research is needed to assess the impact of the exotic
pet trade on this species welfare. In particular, research on welfare conditions during capture and
transportation of wild Ball pythons, and the potential effects of captive breeding, could help reduce
suffering throughout the trade.
Abstract: Extensive numbers of Ball pythons are caught, bred, traded and subsequently kept in
captivity across the world as part of the exotic pet industry. Despite their widespread availability as
pets, relatively little is known about the potential welfare challenges affecting them. We reviewed the
literature for research focused on the health and welfare of Ball pythons in the international pet trade.
From a total of 88 articles returned from the search criteria, our analysis showed that very few actually
focused on trade (10%) or animal welfare (17%). Instead, the majority (64%) of articles focused
on veterinary science. There was a considerable bias towards physical health, with most studies
neglecting the four other domains of animal welfare (behaviour, nutrition, environment and mental
health). Furthermore, very few studies considered Ball pythons prior to resulting pet ownership,
during wild capture and transportation or captive breeding operations. Our review demonstrates that
our current understanding of welfare for Ball pythons traded as exotic pets is limited. We recommend
that future research should focus on aspects of the industry that are currently overlooked, including

the potential consequences of genetic selection during captive-breeding and the conditions provided
for snakes prior to and during international transportation.

1. Introduction
Ownership of non-domesticated animals, or exotic pets, has become increasingly popular across
the world [1]. The exotic pet industry is a substantial part of the global trade in wildlife products,
which is worth an estimated $30.642.8 billion USD annually [2]. Reptiles comprise a substantial part
of the live animal trade (>20%) [3] and are particularly prevalent as exotic pets in European and North
American markets [36], for example, where around 0.9 million are kept in UK homes and 9.4 million
in US homes [1,7,8]. The scale of the trade is likely to be even greater than current estimates due to
incomplete record-keeping and widespread illegal activity throughout the industry [1,9]. Increasing
consumer demand for novel colour and pattern strains produced by artificial breeding selection is
driving industry growth for the captive breeding sector [10].
Ball pythons (Python regius) are one of the most common species of reptiles kept as exotic pets,
dominating in trade volume [3,6]. From 1978 to 2017, between 0.9 million and 1.6 million live
individuals were exported from Togo alone, 99% of which were for commercial purposes (presumably
as exotic pets) [11]. The emergence of novel colour and pattern strains known as morphs has also
been a significant driver of growth in demand for captive bred Ball pythons by creating competition
among breeders and owners for the most unusual and exotic characteristics [10]. Their popularity has
been attributed in part to their docile nature, long lifespans and small size, deemed by some as suitable
for terrariums [12,13]. Consequently, Ball pythons are often referred to as great beginner exotic pet
snakes that are relatively easy to care for in captivity [14,15].
Animal welfare refers to the wellbeing of non-human animals and is described by the American
Veterinary Medical Association as the state of an animal in relation to the conditions in which it lives.
There are a range of animal welfare challenges associated with the private ownership of reptiles,
including Ball pythons, as exotic pets [1618]. For example, Ball pythons have specific requirements
regarding diet, lighting, hygiene, space, temperature and humidity [19]. Yet in a recent review involving
more than 5000 individual Ball pythons in North America and Europe, DCruze et al. [20] found that
the entities involved in this commercial enterprise were not providing housing conditions that meet
the minimum welfare recommendations, either in public or privately, for periods of time that could
range from several days to many years. The same study found that vendors selling Ball pythons online
and at pet expositions were not providing husbandry guidance for new owners. The consequences of
failing to meet these requirements or provide adequate information on how to do so can negatively
impact reptile welfare, resulting in disease, injuries, stress-related behaviours [21], mental suffering and
mortalities associated with poor husbandry. In addition, intense breeding selection of gene mutations
to create novel morphs leads to inbreeding, resulting in genetic disorders with consequential health
issues [20].
Ball pythons also face a multitude of animal welfare challenges during the trade chain prior
to international export for private ownership as exotic pets. For wild caught and ranched animals,
methods of capture and transportation can incite high levels of stress and physical injury [21]. Ball
pythons are ranched when their eggs are taken from the wild and reared on farms. Once hatched,
a proportion of individuals are returned to the wild, and the rest remain on the farm to be used
commercially. Wildlife farms have been criticised for crowded or unhygienic conditions [22] that
can potentially cause disease, suffering, as well as aggression or harassment from other co-occupants
and competition for vital resources, such as water [23,24]. Exact mortality rates prior to and during
transportation are unknown and could be significant [6,25]. Unintended harm resulting from poorly
Animals 2020, 10, 193 3 of 15
managed wild release of ranched animals (e.g., genetic pollution and disease) is also of potential
concern [26].
Despite their widespread availability as exotic pets, we still know relatively little about captive
reptile welfare. There is a widely acknowledged bias towards mammalian species in the scientific
literature [2729]. This bias extends to welfare research, where publications concerning the welfare of
non-mammalian species are vastly outnumbered [30]. Herpetofauna, despite making up 46% of species
richness of terrestrial vertebrates [31], are neglected in research on cognition, sentience, enrichment
of captive environments and other areas of work concerning welfare prioritised in mammals and
birds [28,32,33]. The lack of attention reptiles receive in comparison to other taxa has limited our
understanding of their sensory abilities and functional requirements. The more we learn about reptiles,
the more apparent the potential deficiencies associated with their lives in captivity become [34].
The aim of this study is to review the existing scientific literature for research focused on the health
and welfare of Ball pythons in the international pet trade. We are focusing on the scientific literature,
rather than associated grey literature, to examine the evidence base that knowledge throughout the
industry relies on. The extensive numbers of this species that are being caught, bred, traded and kept
in captivity across the world arguably warrants a thorough understanding of the potential adverse
consequences associated for Ball pythons as exotic pets. In addition to searching the literature for
research investigating trade, we review research pertaining to their health using search terms relating to
disease and welfare. An improved understanding of the potential welfare challenges Ball pythons could
experience in the exotic pet industry is imperative given the mounting physiological, neuroanatomical
and behavioural evidence that reptiles are sentient beings, capable of suffering [33].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Literature Search
We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature. A total of 26 search terms relating
to health, welfare and trade were used (disease, pathogen, virus, viral, bacteria, bacterial, parasite,
parasitic, fungus, fungal, health, welfare, exotic pet, trade, capture, transport, captive care, captive
breeding, behaviour, husbandry, suffering, nutrition, diet, pain, harm, distress). Each search term was
employed with the Boolean operator AND, with three additional terms (Ball python, Royal python,
Python regius). Searches were conducted for the time period 20092019. Across all term combinations,
78 different searches were employed in total. This was repeated across three journal databases
(PubMed(Bethesda, USA); Scopus (Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Web of Science (Philadelphia, USA).
Google scholar was excluded because it returned large numbers of non-relevant literature.
2.2. Literature Analysis
Of the 130 papers returned from the literature search, 16 could not be sourced due to institutional
access issues. A further 26 did not actually relate to Ball pythons, (only mentioned them in reference to
other research) and were therefore removed from the dataset. Two papers relating to Python software
rather than animals were also removed from the returned list. This left a total of 88 papers remaining,
which were included in the analysis. The literature was analysed by recording five different aspects of
the content: focus, target words, use, welfare domains and pathogens.
Focus: Papers were categorised in terms of their primary focus (animal welfare, conservation,
veterinary science and wildlife trade, see Appendix A), and country of origin of the study listed (where
no location was given for study, the country of first author was used).
Target words: Each paper was searched for five target words, related broadly to reptile welfare:
welfare, suffering, pain, distress and harm.
Use: In reference to those papers focused specifically on wildlife trade, use of snakes in relation to
the paper were categorised as kill on site, capture, transport live and kill for use or live use.
Animals 2020, 10, 193 4 of 15
Welfare domains: The dataset was also analysed with regards to mention of the five domains of
animal welfare, a systematic assessment framework devised to assess animals welfare state through
consideration of positive and negative experiences [35]. The experiences are split into five categories:
four physical domains (environment, nutrition, physical health and behaviour) and one mental domain.
Papers were recorded if they mentioned food and water deprivation, environmental challenge or
discomfort, disease or injury, behavioural restriction or anxiety and stress.
Pathogens: Any mention of bacteria, fungi, parasite, protozoa or virus were noted as a
result of searching the document. All disorders, diseases or conditions were recorded in relation
to Ball pythons, with a list of specific named pathogens and parasites compiled. In addition, any
recommendations made by the authors were collated.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
All analysis was carried out in R version 3.6.1 (R Core Development Team, 2019). Chi-square
goodness of fit tests were used to investigate the distribution of papers published across research
category and across locations. Results were recorded as the percentage of papers.
3. Results
Our results are derived from a literature analysis of 88 relevant peer-reviewed scientific papers,
returned from our search criteria.
Focus: Figure 1A shows the percentage of papers on Ball pythons in each of the assigned primary
research focus categories. There was a significantly uneven split across these categories (2 = 71.36,
df = 3, p < 0.001), with veterinary science (64%) being the most common focus followed by animal
welfare (17%) (Figure 1A). The location of study was also not evenly distributed (2 = 198.84, df = 20,
p < 0.001), with the USA having the largest percentage of papers (32%), followed by Denmark, Germany,
Italy, France and Poland (Figure 1B). None of the studies originated in West Africa, where Ball pythons
are the most common legally exported species.

number of papers included n = 88.
Animals 2020, 10, 193 5 of 15
Target words: Our target word searches of the 88 papers found that 4% mentioned the word
welfare (n = 4), only 1% mentioned suffering (n = 1) and 12% mentioned one of the following stress
related terms: pain, distress or harm (n = 14).
Use: Details of Ball Python use in the studies concerned showed that no papers relating to wildlife
trade indicated snakes were killed on sight, or indicated snakes were captured, transported and then
killed for use and 77% referred specifically to live use (n = 55). The other 23% of papers did not
specify use.
Welfare domains: Figure 2 shows the percentage of papers that identified each of the five welfare
domains. Of the 88 papers, 51% (n = 45) considered negative aspects of the health domain, citing
disease or injury. Within this domain, the majority of issues raised were physical illnesses (diseases,
parasites, etc.), rather than behavioural issues or injury (burns, bites, etc.) (Appendix A; Appendix C
Tables S1S6). Far fewer papers mentioned the four remaining domains. Only 8% (n = 7) of the studies
addressed the environment domain, citing challenges and discomfort arising from the animals
surroundings, such as the effects of inappropriate temperature and humidity. Another 7% (n = 6)
addressed negative aspects of the behaviour domain, concerned with abnormal behaviours such as
open mouth breathing, head tremors and lethargy. Negative experiences in the mental state domain,
such as anxiety, fear and distress were mentioned in 6% (n = 5) of the studies. Finally, nutrition was
the least cited domain, where only 3% (n = 3) of the papers referred to deprivation of food and/or
water, and incorrect nutrition from an inadequate diet.

Pathogens: The majority of the pathogens reported were bacteria and parasites, with fewer
instances of protozoa, fungi and viruses (Figure 3; Appendix C). Details of the specific health and
behavioural issues related to Ball python welfare indicated by the papers are provided in Appendices B
and C (with associated definitions provided in Tables S1 and S2).

4. Discussion
Our study provides the most comprehensive review of published literature addressing the welfare
of Ball pythons in the exotic pet trade chain, to date. A total of 88 articles were returned from our
search criteria, although very few specifically addressed trade (10%) or animal welfare (17%). Rather,
the vast majority of articles were focused on veterinary science, describing over 100 clinical symptoms
and nearly 150 underlying pathogens (Appendix B; Tables S2, S6), many of which were artificially
imposed on the snakes during controlled experiments. In the context of the five domains of animal
welfare, our analysis showed a considerable preference towards physical health. Around two thirds of
the studies mentioned disease and injury. In contrast, fewer than 10% of published literature referred
to the snakes environment, nutrition, behaviour or mental wellbeing. Furthermore, none of the studies
were conducted in, or referred to welfare and health aspects in West Africa, where Ball pythons are the
most numerically exported species for use as pets listed on CITES.
4.1. Animal Welfare Domains
The relatively extensive coverage of the physical condition and associated clinical signs observed
in captive Ball pythons could benefit their welfare as it can help enable appropriate veterinary attention
and changes to husbandry practices when necessary. However, focusing the majority of research in one
area while neglecting other key domains of animal welfare could have negative implications for Ball
pythons. For example, only six studies (7%) looked at the snakes behaviour, even though behavioural
change in reptiles can often serve as the primary indicator of disturbance, injury or disease [24].
Behavioural assessments may also offer the advantage of detecting subclinical or psychological
conditions, such as under stimulation from their environment, that may not be revealed through
physiological measurement [24]. Informed behavioural assessment of reptiles could therefore be a
valuable and non-invasive means of evaluating welfare [36,37]. Thus far, this appears to have been
underutilised in the assessment of Ball pythons in the exotic pet trade chain.
Similarly, many negative health and welfare experiences are a consequence of poor nutrition or
an inadequate captive environment [34]. A poor diet can cause a range of diseases, and malnutrition
and dehydration have been linked to abnormal shedding or dysecdysis in snakes [38]. Inappropriate
Animals 2020, 10, 193 7 of 15
lighting, hygiene, space, temperature and humidity can all cause or exacerbate health conditions [34].
Despite the importance of these factors, only nine papers (9%) considered these two domains collectively.
The fifth domain, which addresses mental experiences, was only mentioned in five articles (6%) in
the published literature. As wild animals, Ball pythons may not have evolved coping mechanisms to
adequately deal with all of the artificial stressors presented in a given captive environment [24,39,40],
which in some cases could be at odds with the innate adaptations of the species. Consideration of
mental stresses such as states of fear and frustration are necessary to consider a broad view of the
animals experience and to ensure a holistic assessment of their welfare [9].
4.2. The Trade Chain
In particular, studies concerning welfare during the early stages of the trade chain are currently
under-represented in the scientific literature (i.e., during wild capture, ranching and transportation).
For wild caught and ranched snakes, crowded transport, unhygienic conditions, poor nutrition, poor
environmental control, poor handling and aggression from co-occupants are just some of the factors
that could cause suffering [25]. However, no welfare assessments of snake ranching can be found in the
existing published scientific literature, and welfare during transportation appears to be a completely
unrecorded issue [6]. Currently it is unclear whether there are any welfare provisions for the snakes
prior to CITES and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations which come in to force
during international border crossings. This is particularly concerning because the limited data available
suggest mortality rates for reptiles in transit could be as high as 33% [6,41].
It is not only the welfare of wild caught and ranched snakes that requires further scientific
attention. To date, very little formal research has been undertaken to understand the health and
welfare consequences of selectively breeding wild sourced and captive reptiles [10]. Anecdotal
reports of potential welfare issues linked to genetic manipulation can be found in hobbyist media
(e.g., duckbills [42]), but only one study in the published scientific literature focuses on a single
genetic disorder (wobble head syndrome) associated with a widely propagated phenotype of the Ball
python [10]. For most recently established and trendy morphs, there is not yet enough data to draw
conclusions. However, as the novelty of new morphs appears to have been prioritised over research
into the health consequences of this inbreeding, it is possible that some new diseases and disorders
resulting from selective breeding could be reported in the future.
Our review suggests there is insufficient literature to fully assess the welfare impacts of the trade
in Ball pythons as exotic pets. This raises questions about the ethics of the industry as a whole; is it
humane for us to continue trading and keeping animals without a comprehensive understanding of
their experience? A group of key UK veterinary organisations proposed greater controls on the exotic
pet business by only approving species for the pet trade where the animals needs have been fully
researched and understood, and where there is reasonable evidence from published literature and
professional experience that these needs can be met [43]. Warwick et al. [1] describe positive lists a
similar principle of using evidence-based methods to determine the suitability of species for trading
and keeping. The proposal of positive lists has generally been well accepted among veterinarians
and allied professionals and is in development processes across Europe and North America [1]. The
information currently available for Ball pythons would likely be insufficient to justify their place in the
exotic pet market, using the positive list principle.
4.3. Limitations
It is the nature of reviews such as this one that, as a result of the target words and journal databases
used, some relevant articles may be missed. However, given our extensive yet balanced application
of 26 different target words in relation to health, welfare and trade across three different journal
databases, this review provides a comprehensive and useful representation of the existing scientific
literature focused on the health and welfare of Ball pythons in the international pet trade. Furthermore,
we recognise that information about the captive care of Ball pythons is also widely available in the
Animals 2020, 10, 193 8 of 15
hobbyist media and grey literature, and that our study could be considered limited by only including
scientific literature in our analysis. However, the aim of our study was to assess the evidence base that
advice and knowledge throughout the industry is based on. We believe that highlighting the scarcity
of formal publications demonstrates that whatever other information exists for pet owners is likely
based on a lack of scientific evidence. This raises questions about what premise local regulations and
advisory standards of care are based on, and whether the ownership of Ball pythons as exotic pets
can be considered as responsible. Furthermore, grey literature and hobbyist media can be subject to
non-scientific folklore husbandry [44,45], a term coined to describe methods of husbandry deemed
best practice without proper evaluation, justified by the notion that it has always been done that
way [44]. Therefore, by eliminating these types of sources we can be sure that the information gathered
in our review is scientifically valid.
4.4. Recommendations
It is hoped that the evidence presented in this review can be used to improve welfare for captive
Ball pythons. Acknowledging research gaps in the published scientific literature and focusing research
towards previously neglected areas of the industry could help improve captive conditions and practices
for snakes kept and traded for the exotic pet industry. More informative research would also be
valuable to aid the implementation of policies that mitigate or minimise harm during the trade chain.
In the case of the Ball python, this would particularly apply to regulations governing captive breeding
practices in the USA and Europe, and wild capture and ranching methods in key source countries (i.e.,
Togo, Benin and Ghana).
Although broader research could improve captive conditions for Ball pythons, it is important
to consider that the only way to fully mitigate all of the potential negative animal welfare impacts
for Ball pythons is to remove them from the pet trade all together. This would require changes in
legislation in conjunction with education and awareness campaigns to inspire behavioural changes
among exotic pet owners and breeders. Schuppli et al. [25] argued that the wide-spread popularity
of keeping non-traditional pet species renders it impractical to try to end exotic pet ownership and
trade. Nevertheless, popularity should not be considered justification for an industry to continue if it
is associated with animal suffering. In the absence of removing Ball pythons from the pet trade all
together, any improvements to conditions and practices would be advantageous to the millions of
snakes living within the industry.
5. Conclusions
Our review highlights that research addressing Ball pythons in the exotic pet trade chain is limited
within the published literature. Moreover, the sparse information that does exist is focused on a
few specific facets, neglecting several animal welfare domains and key stages of the trade chain that
supports this commercial enterprise. This paucity of information could hinder efforts to safeguard the
welfare of the animals involved.
From the limited literature available it is already clear there are a multitude of welfare issues
associated with different aspects of the trade chain. The lack of research addressing welfare throughout
each stage, particularly during captive breeding, ranching and transport, is likely limiting our
awareness of the negative consequences that the exotic pet industry can have on Ball pythons.
More importantly, millions of animals are currently experiencing these welfare threats first-hand.
Consequently, we recommend particular focus should be placed on the potential consequences of
selective captive-breeding for rare morphs and conditions provided for snakes prior to and during
international transportation, where there is currently a dearth of knowledge. It is hoped this study
demonstrates that our current understanding of welfare for Ball pythons traded as exotic pets is
superficial and would benefit from a broader range of research throughout the industry.

Abstract
Captive reptiles are routinely identified as reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria and reports of reptile-associated 
infections relating to some species are well documented (e.g., salmonellosis). Currently, relatively little is 
known about the epidemiology and bacteria of ball pythons. We carried out a survey of ball python 
farms in Togo, West Africa to assess the presence of any potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa that have 
been identified in recent scientific literature relating to this species. The presence of bacteria belonging 
to the genera Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Lysobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, 
Staphylococcus, and Tsukamurella in oral and cloacal samples taken from five individual ball pythons is of 
potential concern for horizontal transmission given that pathogenic species belonging to these genera have 
been previously documented. The presence of bacteria belonging to the genera Clostridium, Escherichia, 
Moraxella, and Stenotrophomonas in the oral and rectal samples taken from five mice used to feed ball

pythons suggests that they represent a potential reservoir of infection for wild caught ball pythons and 
their progeny. Furthermore, possible sources of environmental contamination include other captive 
amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals, as well as free ranging birds and small mammals. Additional 
surveillance of ball pythons in the wild and in captivity at python farms in West Africa will shed light 
on whether or not this type of commercial activity is increasing pathogen exposure and lowering barriers 
to transmission. Meanwhile, as a precautionary measure, it is recommended that python farms should 
immediately establish biosecurity and disease surveillance practices to minimize potential horizontal and 
vertical bacterial transfer.

Introduction
Global demand for reptiles as exotic pets is a relatively recent phenomenon (Mitchell 
2009). Their popularity, however, has risen to the extent that they are now thought to 
represent the second most species-rich vertebrate class (after birds) in the international 
exotic pet trade (Bush et al. 2014). Reptiles are particularly rife in European and North 
American markets (Auliya 2003; Jensen et al. 2018), with conservative estimates of c. 
0.7 million individuals being kept in the UK and 9.4 million in the USA, respectively 
(PFMA 2017; APPA 2019).
Global trade in wildlife (whether it legal or illegal) has also been cited as a disease 
transmission mechanism of growing concern in recent decades (Smith et al. 2009; 
Can et al. 2019). Specifically, these concerns relate to how pathogens are spread when 
humans capture wild animals from their natural habitats, transport them by land, sea 
and air and trade them dead or alive in different parts of a country or the world (e.g., 
Morens et al. 2004; Karesh et al. 2005; OIE 2017).
Captive reptiles are routinely identified as reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria and re-
ports of reptile-associated infections for some species are well documented, such as sal-
monellosis (Arena et al. 2012; Bonjak et al. 2016; Green et al. 2020). Several studies 
have investigated and highlighted the potential for horizontal and vertical transfer of 
disease at commercial captive breeding operations [e.g., Green iguanas (Iguana iguana) 
(Mitchell et al. 1999; Mitchell and Shane 2000) and Green sea turtles (Chelonia my-
das) (Warwick et al. 2013)]. In some scenarios reptile-associated infections can spread 
to humans who have had direct or indirect contact with pet snakes and feeder rodents 
(used as reptile food) before their illnesses occurred [e.g., Canada in late 2019; (Gov-
ernment of Canada 2019)].
The ball python (Python regius), a species native to western and central Africa, 
is being exported in relatively large numbers [1,657,814 live individuals since 1978 
(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
[CITES] Trade Database; https://trade.cites.org)]. In fact, it is the single most traded 
CITES listed species (currently under CITES Appendix II) that is legally exported 
Bacteria in ball pythons from Togo 75
alive from Africa (DCruze et al. 2020). Much of this international trade can be traced 
back to a number of python farms that are in operation across West Africa, most 
notably in Benin, Ghana and Togo (Robinson et al. 2015).
Since c. 1996, these python farms have been engaged in ranching (UNEP 2019), 
which refers to rearing, in a controlled environment, snakes taken as eggs or juveniles from 
the wild, where they would otherwise have had a low probability of surviving to adulthood 
(CITES 2019), and releasing a proportion back into the wild (Ineich 2006). Addition-
ally, gravid females are also collected, and after laying their eggs in captivity are released 
back into the wild (Ineich 2006).
Recent studies have confirmed that the wild capture of ball pythons (for the ex-
port of specimens as ranched individuals the CITES source code R is used) often 
involves the removal of snakes from rodent burrows and live transport in sacks filled 
with other reptiles (DCruze et al. 2020). Once at farms, the snakes are reportedly 
housed separately, but they can also be housed at times in overcrowded enclosures in 
rooms that are filled with many other reptile species (DCruze et al. 2020). Mature ball 
pythons are typically fed live mice that are sourced from breeders or housed, or even 
bred, on site at farms.
Despite the international scope, large scale, and national wild release component 
of ball python ranching in Togo, there has been no current research focused on the 
epidemiology of this commercial trade activity. Therefore, we aimed to carry out an in-
itial review, using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) methods, to determine the pres-
ence of any potentially pathogenic genera of bacteria present in ball pythons and the 
live mice used as their food. We hope our findings will inform biosecurity surveillance 
practices to minimize potential horizontal and vertical transfer of zoonotic diseases.
Methods
Literature review
We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature featured in PubMed, Sco-
pus and Web of Science, from 20092019 to identify bacteria that are known to have 
affected the well-being of ball pythons. The following search terms were used (disease, 
pathogen, bacteria, bacterial). Each search term was employed with the Boolean op-
erator AND, with three additional terms (ball python, royal python, Python regius).
Laboratory analysis
A total of 20 dry swab samples were taken from five snakes and five mice at a python 
farm in Togo in September 2019 (Fig. 1, Suppl. material 1). Two swab samples were 
taken from each animal, one each from oral (both snake and mice), cloacal (snakes 
only) and rectal (mice only) orifices. Swabs were immediately transferred into 2 ml 
Neil DCruze et. al.  /  Nature Conservation 39: 7386 (2020)76
screwcap microcentrifuge tubes containing approximately 600 l of DNA/RNA Shield 
and stored at -20 C until transport to the UK.
Prior to DNA extraction, samples (swab and reagent) were transferred into a fresh 
2 ml screwcap microcentrifuge bead-beating tube, containing approximately 0.06 g of 
0.1 mm glass-silica beads (Thistle Scientific, Glasgow), and vortexed twice for 30 sec-
onds. The swabs were then discarded and the supernatant/liquid portion of the sample 
transferred to a 1.5 ml tube containing 274 l polyethylene glycol (6000) and 141 l 
5M sodium chloride and incubated at 5 C for 1545 minutes. DNA was extracted 
using a modified phenol-chloroform method (Rogers et al. 2013) with reduced reagent 
volumes (200 l each of molecular biology grade water, phenol, phenol-chloroform 
and ammonium-acetate: isopropanol compared to the 500 l used previously). DNA 
pellets were suspended in 10 l of molecular biology grade water and stored at -20 C.
For PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicons were generated following the Illumina two-
step protocol (Illumina 2019) using primers designed by Caporaso et al. (2012) for 
the first step PCR and Nextera XT Index primers (Illumina, USA) for the second step. 
PCR conditions are shown in Appendix I. Amplicon clean-up was performed using 
AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, UK), and normalised using a 96-well Sequal-
Prep Normalisation Plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Amplicons were sequenced 
using a 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent Micro Kit v2 (Illumina, USA) with a read length of 
2  150 bp  on the MiSeq platform.
Sequence quality of the top six samples was visually assessed within R (R Core 
Team 2019) using the DADA2 R package (Callahan et al. 2016), which was used 
for taxonomic assignment in combination with the Genome Taxonomy Database 
(GTDB) (Parks et al. 2018; Chaumeil et al. 2019) using 1  150 bp forward read 
sequences. Raw reads were processed in accordance with the DADA2 Pipeline Tutorial 
(1.12) (Callahan 2019). In addition to using the standard filtering parameters for trim-
ming, an extra step was added to ensure only amplicons of the expected length were 
included (i.e., with a minimum length of 148 and a maximum length of 151 bp). The 
resultant ASV and taxonomy csv files were combined to make a single database, which 
was further trimmed in Excel (Microsoft, USA). Prior to the assignment of presump-
tive genus-level classification for the ASVs, NA values for taxonomic levels at family 
level and above were removed. NA values at the genus level were kept and included as 
part of the other genus category. Species level assignment was not possible due to the 
short length of the targeted 16S rRNA region, which may be indistinguishable among 
species and / or strains (Bulman et al. 2018; Osawa et al. 2015).
Bacterial genera that had been reported in the published scientific literature were 
identified using the search function within Excel. The assigned identity was confirmed 
using nucleotide BLAST searches against the 16S rRNA sequences (Bacteria and Ar-
chaea) coupled with megablast (highly similar sequences). Sequence read values for 
each genus were combined to create a stacked bar chart. No cut-off values for reads per 
sample were applied. The overall relative abundance for some genera were calculated 
by converting the number of reads for ASVs that have been assigned to a particular ge-
nus to a percentage relative to the total number of reads (derived using ASVs assigned 
genera in addition to the other category).
Bacteria in ball pythons from Togo 77
Results
The literature review identified 29 different species of bacteria across 26 genera that 
have negatively impacted the health of ball pythons [according to 15 scientific papers 
published between 2017 and 2019 (Table 1, Fig. 1, Suppl. material 1)]. Sequencing 
the microbiota of snake and mouse samples collected from the python farm in Togo 
provided presumptive identification of 13 (50%) of these 26 genera. One of the sam-
ples (Mouse Oral 1) did not contain amplifiable DNA and hence was not successfully 
sequenced. (Table 1, Fig. 1). Searches with BLAST resulted in a query cover range of 
94  100% and percentage identity range of 89  100% (Suppl. material 1).
In terms of overall abundance, 85% of ASVs were assigned to genera of bacteria 
that were not identified as being of zoonotic concern by the literature review (Table 
1, Fig. 1, Suppl. material 1). However, all but one of the samples (95%) contained at 
least one assigned genus of potential zoonotic concern (Table 1, Fig. 1). Between zero 
to six of the literature-identified genera were assigned within each sample (mean of 
two) (Supp. Mat. I). The relative abundance of the literature-identified genera ranged 
between 035% of isolates per sample (mean of 13%) (Suppl. material 1).
Of the literature-identified genera, Lysobacter was the most prevalent among the 
genera-assigned ASVs, although it was only associated with snake samples. Lysobacter 
assigned ASVs also accounted for just over 10% with regards to the overall relative 
abundance of ASVs. Furthermore, these ASVs were present within eight out of the 19 
samples (Fig. 1, Suppl. material 1). The second most abundant genus was Bacteroides, 
which accounted for 2% of the overall relative abundance of ASVs. Bacteroides as-
signed ASVs were present in each of the four sample types (snake oral, snake cloacal, 
mouse oral and mouse rectal), although relative abundance was greatest in the mouse 
rectal sample set (Fig. 1; Suppl. material 1).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of any potentially pathogenic 
bacterial taxa in ball pythons and the live mice used as their food at a commercial 
python farm that could impact negatively on the health of these snakes and/or those 
keeping them. The target facility reportedly releases all previously gravid females, 
and approximately 20% of their hatchlings, back into the wild and exports the re-
mainder internationally for use as exotic pets (primarily to the USA). Of particular 
interest was relating the epidemiology of infection to potential vertical and hori-
zontal transmission.
This study reported 13 different genera of bacteria, which include species that are 
known pathogens of ball pythons. The assignment of ASVs to Acinetobacter, Bacte-
roides, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Lysobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and 
Tsukamurella in the oral and cloacal samples taken from ball pythons is of potential 
concern for vertical and horizontal transmission, given that recent scientific literature 
reports pathogenic species belonging to these genera (Fig. 1, Table 1).

Bacteria in ball pythons from Togo 79
The relatively high frequency of ASVs assigned to the genus Lysobacter  80% (n= 
8) of oral and cloacal samples from ball pythons  is consistent with a recent report 
of isolates from the trachea of a ball python suffering from respiratory tract infection 
[Lysobacter pythonis sp. nov. (Busse et al. 2019)]. Lysobacter spp. have been described as 
ubiquitous inhabitants of soil and water (Christensen and Cook 1978) making the 
soil from the dens of wild caught pythons a potential source of infection.
The absence of ASVs assigned to the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Lysobacter, 
Proteus, and Tsukamurella in the oral and rectal samples taken from mice used to feed 
ball pythons suggests that their diet was not a source of infection in this commercial 
operation, at least on the days of sampling, for these particular genera. Nonetheless, a 
much larger sample of mice is needed to determine the true bacterial status of the ro-
dents that are typically used to feed ranched ball pythons when in captivity.

and Stenotrophomonas in the oral and rectal samples taken from mice used to feed ball

pythons suggests that these mice represent a potential reservoir of infection, for these 
particular genera, that could impact negatively on the health of wild caught ball py-
thons (i.e., gravid females) and their progeny. Other potential sources of environmen-
tal contamination include other captive amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals that 
are traded by python farms (cf. Bell et al. 2004), as well as free ranging birds and small 
mammals (including rodents), which were observed on the farm.
Ball python production systems in West Africa have the potential to encourage 
disease transmission and the evolution of increased pathogen virulence. Python farms 
that practice the ranching of ball pythons operate at high stocking densities and 
with poor hygiene measures, where animals are sourced from geographically and eco-
logically diverse areas with minimal quarantine. These practices can increase pathogen 
exposure and lower barriers to transmission (Stenglein et al. 2014).
Furthermore, the ball python is the most traded CITES-listed live wild animal 
currently being exported from Africa, with more than 963,334 snakes exported from 
Togo alone between 1978 and 2017 (DCruze et al. 2020). Commercial breeders in 
importing countries (predominantly the USA and countries of the EU) also operate at 
high stocking densities and commonly attend trade shows, where animals from differ-
ent sources are juxtaposed (Stenglein et al. 2014).
Limitations
The present study was restricted to 20 samples taken from five snakes and five mice 
at one of the seven python farms currently operating in Togo. Furthermore, it reports 
only on assigned bacterial genera identified as possessing pathogenic species that are 
known to have affected ball pythons (as reported by recent scientific literature); thus, 
this study is not a comprehensive or exhaustive list of genera that may contain zoonotic 
pathogens. Only 15% of the ASVs in our samples were assigned to genera of concern 
(as reported in the literature), while other potentially pathogenic genera may be pre-
sent and could be identified by further analysis.
Species level identification could not be achieved with the samples in this prelimi-
nary assessment due to the short length of the targeted 16S rRNA region, which may 
be indistinguishable among species and/or strains (a low level taxonomic rank used at 
the intraspecific level) (Bulman et al. 2018; Osawa et al. 2015). Future studies could 
overcome this limitation and improve taxonomic resolution by using more sensitive 
techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with species-spe-
cific primers (Osawa et al. 2015).
Similarly, the present study did not distinguish between pathogenic and non-path-
ogenic ASVs. This is an important distinction, since the same species of bacteria can 
act as a harmless commensal, as well as a dangerous pathogen (e.g., Escherichia coli) 
(Proena et al. 2017). To overcome this limitation, future studies should adopt a highly 
targeted and individual approach per species [e.g., as taken by Delannoy et al. (2017) 
who detected pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli using a qPCR assay that target the 
Bacteria in ball pythons from Togo 81
K1 capsule]. Similar analyses should also look to target other pathogen types (e.g., vi-
ruses) in ranched ball pythons and other wild animal species held in captivity at py-
thon farms.
We recognize that the present study represents a preliminary evaluation that should 
be treated as an initial indicator of both the bacteria present in commercial python 
farms in West Africa and their potential involvement in zoonotic disease. However, 
given the international scope, large scale, and national wild release component of the 
ranching process that currently underpins commercial trade of live ball pythons, we 
believe that these initial findings provide an important insight into the potential for ver-
tical and horizontal bacterial transmission and highlight the need for further research.
Recommendations
Additional surveillance of ball pythons, both in the wild and in captivity at python 
farms in West Africa, will shed light on whether this type of commercial activity increas-
es pathogen exposure and lowers barriers to transmission. However, in light of other 
management concerns (Auliya et al. 2020; DCruze et al. 2020), and as a precautionary 
measure, it is strongly advised that farms maintaining reptiles and other wildlife adjust 
to standard hygiene and quarantine measures, (e.g., biosecurity and disease surveillance 
practices [cf. Woodford 2000]) to minimize horizontal and vertical transfer.
Biosecurity measures should also be applied to snakes that are being released back 
into the wild as part of the ranching system in Togo. Theoretically, when they are 
properly released within an area of its indigenous range, this type of wild population 
reinforcement can improve the conservation status of the focal species (IUCN/SSC 
2013). However, the IUCN/SSC (2013) recommends effective monitoring as an es-
sential activity, and that reinforcement efforts should include the assessment of disease, 
welfare conditions, and mortality to maximise positive conservation outcomes.
Biosecurity surveillance practices should extend to importing countries. Such initia-
tives should also aim to inform those who trade and own ball python of the potential risks 
associated with zoonotic infection. Providing an appropriate environment and adequate 
nutrition for ball pythons is also important for maintaining their health. Washing of hands 
after handling ball pythons is strongly recommended (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2018) and they are inappropriate pets for immunocompromised owners and 
in households with young children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018).
Conclusion
This survey represents the first investigation into the epidemiology of bacterial genera 
at a commercial ball python farm in West Africa. This study was developed through the 
opportunity to collect samples during a broader official scientific review. It is recom-
mended that further research should be carried out at python farms in Benin, Ghana 
Neil DCruze et. al.  /  Nature Conservation 39: 7386 (2020)82
and Togo. These studies should look to fully assess the species diversity, relative abun-
dance, and pathogenic status of any bacteria (and other types of pathogen such as 
viruses) present in ranched ball pythons and the rodents that are used to feed them.
