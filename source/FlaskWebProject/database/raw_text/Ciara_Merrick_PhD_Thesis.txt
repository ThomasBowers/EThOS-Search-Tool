Abstract 
This thesis argues the question of peace in Northern Ireland, and perhaps beyond, cannot be founded 
on tolerance, equality, or mutual understanding among persons. Peace cannot reside within a horizon of 
sameness, whereby bodies are posited as either dualistic or in-common. Both these positions engulf and 
dissipate the potential of the in-between as they approach the self and other as known identities 
graspable in their entirety. As a scholar inspired by a feminist politics, I approach the question of peace 
as an active, transformative making. This does not mean imposing a fixed, timeless or utopian vision of 
peace upon empirical reality and critically deconstructing the capacity of the real world to measure up. 
Nor does it sacrifice the potential of peace to the non-violent or less-than-violent; peace as an impossible 
perfection always-already subsumed by the originary position of conflict and agonism. Rather, I call for 
an alternative starting point that holds the capacity to attend to the ethical encounters of peace always-
already respiring throughout the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland.  
The starting point I opt for moves with, but also beyond, the thinking of philosopher Luce Irigaray. 
Irigaray conceives of the encounter as a relation of differentiation in proximity active in the sharing of 
breath. Epistemologically, I trace the movement and materiality of breath through a detailed 
ethnographic study of an Irish language centre in Protestant east Belfast. This tracing animates an 
understanding of peace as woven from the necessary relationality of autonomous bodies in active 
doings that affirm everyday processes of socio-ecological care and reciprocity. The political emphasis 
of this thesis cannot be located in a critical assessment of the what is. Rather, it moves with an extant, 
ecological weaving of alternative worlds making peace-full, if speculative, futures from within the 
immanence of the present. 
Acknowledgements  
This thesis has, in many ways been a collective endeavour that would not have been possible without the 
support and encouragement of so many people. I cannot, in these few words, expresses my gratitude to 
the people who have nourished, supported, and encouraged the making of this thesis. it may, at times, 
have felt like an individual and detached project but it could never have been done without every one 
of you.  
To my supervisor, Mark Jackson and Maria Fannin, you have both been instrumental to this project and 
to the development of my thinking over the past years. Mark your door was always open and, however 
busy you were, you always made the time to answer my questions and listen to my concerns. In all our 
conversations, you expertly and with great eloquence guided my thinking towards the bigger picture, 
where you illustrated the crucial political claims in question before reflecting them back towards the 
gestures and moments I was intimately exploring. Maria you introduced me to Luce Irigaray and gave 
me the space to explore the aspects of her work I found most inspiring. I will always admire your capacity 
to move beyond critique and see the productive relations and connections in everyones thinking. Thank 
you both for taking the time to read and re-read, for your nuanced comments, your guidance, your 
patience, and your kindness.  
I should also thank the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for funding this research. The ESRC 
provided the funding but securing the studentship would not have been possible without the support of 
Mark and his guidance through the application process. The ESRC also supported a policy internship with 
the Welsh Government, which was an opportunity providing invaluable insights to research in a different 
environment.  
I am exceptionally grateful to all my research participants who shared their time and stories and, in 
doing so, intimately shaped this research. My especially thanks go to the peacebuilding organisation I 
worked closely with whilst in Belfast. I honestly thought they were just giving me a desk but, without 
hesitation, they opened their arms and involved me in their work. You work tirelessly and with compassion, 
energy, and sensitivity. Not only did they provide the opportunity for direct experience of the 
peacebuilding sector and access to their vast wealth of knowledge, but I made friends with some of the 
most kind, funny, and caring people, who made my time in Belfast so much a happier. Thank you all for 
looking after me, for keeping me laughing, and for all the beige food Thanks to you, I will always look 
back on my time in Belfast with a smile of my face. 
I owe a huge thank you to Turas. From the outset you were willing to support my research and my journey 
into the Irish language in any way that you could. Linda and Gordon, I thank you for your honesty and 
openness, and I respect the commitment and sacrifice you  and everyone who has walked through the 
doors of Turas  have made in the search for something different and something better. I extend my 
thank to Carmel, Lara, Jim, and Caoimhe, and to all the learners who gave up their time to share their 
stories with me  go raibh maith agat 
I also wish to thank Cooke Womens Rugby club, Flow yoga studio, and Maitri yoga studio. Flow you 
provided a guided a practice through which I connected to the movement and materiality of my own 
breath. Maitri you stepped up when I was desperate, and I thank you for immediately recognising the 
importance of the stories I have sought to tell. To all the ladies at Cooke, I am still in awe of your skill, 
passion, and commitment to the rugby game and your team. Thank you for putting up with the endless 
dropped balls, my constant look of confusion, and my futile attempt to catch the ball with my eyes closed 
(apparently it helps if you keep them open). Despite my ulterior agenda, you welcomed me to the team, 
and I am proud to have been a Cookie.  
I owe a big thanks to the support of my fellow PhD colleagues who have made what can be a difficult 
and lonely process easier and more enjoyable. Sam Berlin, Catherine Midwood, Harry Bregazzi, 
Stephanie Denning and Sage Brice deserve particular mention. Your insights, words of encouragement, 
proofreading, and cups of tea  or in Catherines case the endless glasses on wine  have meant a lot 
and been massively appreciated.  
I am very fortunate to have the most amazing friends and family. Their support and encouragement have 
been unwavering throughout. I owe a big thank you to Becky, Charlotte, and George who have always 
been there and listened with interest as I talked about breath, Belfast, and Luce Irigaray. I value each 
of you and our friendships so much. I am truly grateful to my mum, dad, Orla, and Sorcha. Mum you 
were always at the end of the phone whenever I rang and, whilst you may have felt out of your depth 
supporting me on this unfamiliar, distant journey, you never failed once; you are and always will be my 
rock. Dad you asked questions, you probed, you proofread, you explained rugby moves and drills, and 
you cut out every relevant newspaper clipping. Even from far away you made sure I constantly knew 
how invested you were in this journey and how proud you are  I appreciate that so much. Orla you 
didnt hesitate for a moment when I asked for your help proof reading and, together with Sorcha, I am 
so lucky to have you both as my sisters.  
Last and my no means least, my most heart-felt thanks go to Rich. You have cooked, you have cleaned, 
you have proofread, you have wiped away the tears, you have listened, and you have made the much-
needed gin and tonics at the end of particularly hard days You had little option but to put me and this 
thesis first, but you did so without complaint. You have provided a caring, happy, and loving stability 
and escape. Your support and faith have been unwavering, and your love has looked after me and kept 
me going even when I had lost my way. I dont have the word but, for forever and always, thank you.

Prologue 
The Dance of Recognition 
Sitting in a restaurant in New York, the soft tones of the Belfast accent float over, brush my ear and grab 
my attention. I am with a group of colleagues from England, and we have travelled to America on a work 
trip  a week of meetings, appointments, site visits and corporate dinners. We are just grabbing a bite to 
eat  or several bites with American size portions  in a traditional American diner before heading onto 
the next appointment. Sitting on dark leather booths, we scan the several menus scattered across the table 
 a drinks menu, an all-day breakfast menu, the lunch menu, the specials menu: so much choice  
The tones from home suddenly pull my attention away from the lunch menu I'd been gazing down at 
towards the waitress across of the room delivering mountains of food to a drooling table. Having set 
down the food in front of the hungry bodies, the waitress did a quick swivel on her toes and made her way 
towards our table, while freeing her notepad and pen from the pocket of the black apron tied around her 
waist. With a habitual but friendly smile she introduced herself and, as I was on the edge of the booth, she 
directed her attention towards me and asked: "what can I get for you?"  
Across the expanse of the dance floor our eyes lock upon one and other. There can now be no avoidance; 
we must dance. However, we know the routine; learnt from an early age, we have danced it many times 
before.  
A familiar sequence.   
From our opposing side of the dance floor, we slowly draw closer together. One step at a time. Eyes 
searching the body before us. 
"Where are you from?"  
Our bodies crouch and our arms spread wide. We move around one and other in a circular motion; 
orbiting the same path, the same trajectory, a single line of movement.  
"What part of Belfast?" 
 We size one and other up, keeping our space and remaining alert as we cypher the body we dance with 
 coding movement, shape, sound, and colour.  
"What school did you go to?"  
Questions asked, answered, and responded to consume the very presence of the body before us. 
As one we dance. We move to the same beat. We pirouette in time. We twirl, we spin, we step. We sway 
to one rhythm. We glide together. We meet in unison; one movement, a single time, a common body. 
Unchanging, equivalent, transparent. Sameness. 
The bodies around us stare on in amusement as they watch this dance.  
A dance devoid of touch. Two bodies that never caress or feel. 
A static movement. A stagnant dance. An eternal sequence.  
Now one, now known, the dance ceases. We are in place. 
The only remaining movement is our heaving chests grasping for breath.

Introduction 
So please, I beg you - live. 
(Lyra McKee 2018: n.p.) 
1.1 The Spoils of Peace 
In 2016, a young journalist named Lyra McKee wrote a poignant and prophetic essay about the 
ceasefire babies of Northern Ireland. Lyra McKee was a ceasefire baby. Born in 1990, she was too 
young to recall the worst of the bloody and violent war that had plagued Northern Ireland. She was still 
in nappies or, perhaps, just out of them when in 1994 the Irish Republic Army (IRA) called a ceasefire 
and, for the first time in thirty years, there was a feint glimmer of hope for a different future for the 
babies and children of the day (McKee 2016). Four years later, in 1998, the historic Good Friday 
Agreement was signed; peace in Northern Ireland had finally been achieved. Lyra McKee (2016: n.p.), 
along with the other ceasefire babies, had become the Good Friday Agreement generation  a 
generation that, as she wrote, were destined to never witness the war but to reap the spoils of peace. 
Yet, as she continued, the spoil of peace just never seemed to reach us.  
Violence on the streets of Derry/Londonderry1 had been anticipated. In was the 18th April 2019, three 
days before Easter Sunday. Around Easter every year, the Easter Rising is commemorated by 
Republicans, to mark the 1916 Republican rebellion against British rule; the Rising laid the foundations 
for the partitioning of Ireland in 1921. The story of partitioning is largely settled in what became the 
Republic of Ireland. The story north of the dividing partition is, however, somewhat different. Northern 
Ireland witnessed three decades of bloody violence, commonly referred to as the Troubles, as the IRA 
pursued an armed struggle against the British in its quest for a united Ireland. Northern Ireland is no 
longer at war. In 1994, a ceasefire was declared. In 1998, a peace agreement was signed. And from 
2007, Sinn Fin, the political wing of the IRA, has shared executive power with the Democratic Unionist 
Party (DUP). However, several small, angry factions of the IRA, who continue to regard the peace 
agreement as a sell-out, have been established. The most recent incarnation of dissident Republicanism 
is the New IRA, who have a strong foothold on the streets of Derry. The New IRA, along with other 
dissident groups on both sides, are determined to illustrate the constitutional question has not been settled 
and violence can once again be ignited (McKay 2019)  a threat that has become an intimate reality in 
the current political turmoil. 
1 Typically, Unionists refer to the city as Londonderry, its official name; Nationalists prefer to call the city Derry. 
Derry is the anglicised version of Doire, which in Gaelic means Oak Grove. The prefix London was added in 1613 
to honour the Guild of London, who in the seventeenth century rebuilt the Gaelic settlement in the style of an English 
garrison (Doherty 2007: 164). For the remainder of the thesis I refer to the city as, simply, Derry. 
In 2017, after a decade of relative political stability and fruitful cooperation between Sinn Fin and the 
DUP, Northern Irelands power-sharing government collapsed. Bitterness between Nationalists and 
Unionists has taken hold and hard-line, zero-sum positions have been adopted both in Stormont, the 
location of the Northern Irish executive, and on the streets of Northern Ireland. Brexit has compounded 
the instability. The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has rearticulated 
questions regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland  questions both dissident Republicans 
and dissident Loyalists argue have never been settled. Brexit poses a question over the border 
partitioning the island of Ireland; a question that could have devastating consequence for Northern 
Ireland broadly and, acutely, in the border towns and cities, such as Derry.  
It was Maundy Thursday. Easter Sunday was three days away, and tomorrow would be Good Friday, 
the day when twenty-one years ago Northern Ireland chose peace. On social media images were shared 
depicting a convoy of police vehicles crossing the River Foyle in Derry (McKay 2019). They were heading 
for Creggan, a large housing estate sitting close to County Donegal on the border of the Republic of 
Ireland. When they arrived, the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) carried out a series of house 
raids. They were hunting for suspected weapons and ammunition, fearful of an eruption of dissident 
Republican activity commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising. They found nothing. Their presence, however, 
was not to pass by without a response. Young men with hoods pulled over their heads and scarves 
gathered around their faces quickly gathered on Creggans streets. Riots broke out. Bricks and 
firecrackers flew through the air, forcing the police to retreat to their armour-plated vehicles (McKay 
2019). Petrol bombs were thrown (BBC News 2019). A hijacked van stood in a burnt-out shadow. Another 
car still lit up the dark night, as it continued to blaze (Rawlinson 2019).  
That night, Lyra McKee left the safety of her home to report on the escalating violence. As she stood 
next to a PSNI vehicle watching with a couple of friends, she sent a tweet capturing the chaos of the 
evening. It read: Derry tonight. Absolute madness (in Carroll and Greenfield 2019: n.p., see figure 1.). 
Lyra McKee watched as those ceasefire babies, about whom she had written so compassionately, re-
enacted a violence of which they had no memory. Young men cajoled by life-long narratives of us and 
them, by stories of commemoration and suffering, and by the taunts of those who had lived through far 
worse and given far more. A generation who had walked to school staring down at their feet as the 
area was searched for suspicious devices. They had grown up navigating the spatial divisions of Northern 
Ireland, knowing those on the other side only by the rocks that hit them as they came flying over dividing 
peace walls. Their toy guns had been played with inside; if they played with them outside a passing 
army patrol or police jeep might mistake them for real guns and fire (McKee 2016). Lyra McKee stood 
and watched the violence, a manifestation of decades of division and segregation, produced at the 
hands of those destined to reap the spoils of peace. 
Shots rang out suddenly. People began to run. A body fell to the ground.  
On the 18th April 2019, twenty-nine-year-old Lyra McKee was murdered on the streets of Derry, the 
location in which the Troubles first erupted fifty years ago.  
Four days later, the New IRA issued a statement to the Irish News claiming responsibility for Lyra McKees 
death.  
On Thursday night, following an incursion on the Creggan by heavily armed British crown forces which 
provoked rioting, the IRA deployed our volunteers to engage In the course of attacking the enemy 
Lyra McKee was tragically killed while standing beside enemy forces (Weaver and Rawlinson 2019: 
n.p., my emphasis). 
The New IRA, a dissident Republican group, determined the death of Lyra McKee to be a tragic accident 
in the pursuit for Irish freedom (McKay 2019). The gunshots were an act of territorial defence against 
the heavily armed British crown forces; they were fired to articulate and protect the natural and innate 
claim to Northern Ireland against the British, Protestant enemy; Lyra McKee was simply caught in the 
historic spectacle of crossfire. Susan McKay (2019: n. p., original emphasis), a journalist and friend of  
Figure. 1. Lyra McKees final tweet sent from the Creggan estate on the 18th April 2019 as she 
watched the riots unfold on the night she was killed (in Carroll and Greenfield 2009: n.p.). 
Lyra McKee expressed her fury and heartbreak on reading the New IRAs statement, which at once 
claimed and absolved responsibility. She argued: Lyra did not die for Irish freedom. Lyra was Irish 
freedom (see figure 2.).  
Six days later, on Wednesday 24th April, thousands from every community filled the streets for Lyra 
McKees ecumenical funeral at St. Annes Cathedral in Belfast. In attendance was the Taoiseach, Leo 
Varadkar, the then British Prime minister, Theresa May, and the Irish President, Michael D. Higgins, who 
sat alongside Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, and Michelle ONeill, the leader of Sinn Fin. The 
homily given by Father Martin Magill (in Cross and Madden 2019: n.p.) directly addressed the politicians 
standing in the congregation.  
I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am, however, 
left with a question: why in Gods name does it take the death of a twenty-nine-year-old woman 
with her whole life in front of her to get to this point? 
A minute-long standing ovation followed these words (Gaw 2019). Father Martin Magill continued to 
plead with the politicians in attendance and watching in, those who repeatedly fail to address the issue 
of the Irish border in ongoing Brexit negotiations, despite the threat it poses to the Good Friday 
Agreement and its generation. He pleaded with those Northern Irish politicians who, in the suspension of 
Stormont, neglect the ceasefire babies who need a life  not a gun put in their hands [They] need to 
feel the peace process is working for them (Father Martin Magill in Gaw 2019: n.p.). Talks aimed at 
restoring Stormont resumed in the weeks after Lyra McKees death, but it is feared momentum for 
agreement has drained and Northern Ireland remains without a functioning executive (Woodcock 2019). 
Brexit, in parallel, has descended into chaos and the issue of the Northern Irish border  the tangible 
division of the question regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland  remains unresolved.  
Figure. 2. Mural of Lyra McKee on Kent Street in her home city of Belfast, painted a month after 
her murder (The Guardian 2019a: n.p.). 
Lyra McKee was a ceasefire baby; she was part of a generation destined to reap the spoil of peace. 
But these spoils failed to reach her. And the failure of these spoils continues for the ceasefire babies, 
and their babies. 
Father Martin Magills question remains: why is the question of peace only approached through the 
spectacle of violence? 
1.2 Encountering Peace 
Lyra McKees life and death offer a starting point for this thesis. As a ceasefire baby and part of the 
Good Friday Agreement generation, Lyra McKee did not grow up amidst everyday violence. The Good 
Friday Agreement undoubtedly achieved a great deal. Today, for instance, the soundtrack of Northern 
Irish life is not composed from bombs and gunshots. The daily commute has ceased to include invasive 
stop and search routines. The pavements of Belfast and Derry are not lined with the living statues of the 
British military, and a haze of danger no longer clouds the country. The Good Friday Agreement was 
largely effective in ending the worst of violence; however, this elite driven agreement has failed to build 
peace (Brown and N Aolain 2015). 
Northern Irelands ceasefire babies grew up in, and today bring up their own babies, in acutely divided 
worlds. Despite the implicit agreement within the formal Peace Process to work to overcome divisions, 
Northern Ireland continues to be visibly (and invisibly) partitioned: culture, politics, nationality, religion, 
and territory continue to be codified as Catholic or Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist, Republican or 
Loyalist, green or orange.2 Today, in excess of 50% of Belfasts population are living in segregated 
areas with either a 90% Catholic population or a 90% Protestant population (Bergstrm 2015). Over 
93% of children are educated in defined Catholic or Protestant schools (Nolan 2014). The Peace Process 
has not simply failed to address the dividing legacies of the Troubles, but is structured by and, in turn, 
institutionalises political, cultural, and social divisions. These divisions legitimise continual allegiances to 
binary identity politics and to the reproduction of dualistic grammars of difference. These dualistic 
grammars are necessarily violent. The violence they construct operates largely invisibly as it works to 
shape the normal state of thing (Zizek 2008).  
I heard it over and over again. I heard it on the bus travelling from the Belfast International Airport to 
Europa Buscentre. The same words were voiced again in the Puregym changing rooms on Adelaide 
Street, and in the Duke of York pub in the Cathedral Quarter. They were reiterated at meeting rooms, 
in the queues which formed waiting for stamps, across various counters, at parties as people mingled 
2 The terms on each side of this binary divide tend to be used interchangeably, despite a myriad of nuanced 
difference between and within them. In the context of the current discussion, a pertinent difference is between 
Nationalist and Republican and Unionist and Loyalist, with the latter on each side prepared to achieve their 
respective aims via violence and militant tactics which are often condemned by the former across both sides. 
and worked the room. Two questions opened each and every meeting: Where do you live? What school 
do you go to? With these questions, people navigate learnt territories, they encode predefined answers, 
and recognise3 others as known a prioris. If you live on the Newtownards Road, you are Protestant; if 
you live in west Belfast, you are Catholic. If you speak Irish, you are Catholic, and probably a Nationalist. 
But, if you play the flute in a marching band, you are Protestant, and, more than likely, Unionist. If you 
go to St. Marys Christian Brothers Grammar School, you are Catholic, but if you go to Strathearn School, 
you are Protestant. If your eyes are close together, you must be Protestant, but if they are set far apart, 
then you have to be Catholic. If you pronounce H with a breathy haitch, as opposed to the aitch of 
the Protestant mouth, then you are Catholic, and so on.  
I first visited Belfast back in 2016 on a two-week research trip. I had spent almost the best part of a 
year reading about the legacy of the Troubles and was fully aware segregation and sectarianism are 
still highly prevalent and dictate the life-worlds of those territorially embedded by the city. To see, and 
what is more sense, the division, however, is different. It is something no amount of reading can prepare 
you for. It is felt as uneasiness and was, for me, an outsider, a shock difficult to articulate, but it touched 
upon my body with every step. I was made aware, in a way I had not previously experienced, of my 
English-Irish body: was I crossing into an area in which I belonged, will they detect my otherness, my 
excluded and foreign theirness, will they overhear my accent, ask my name. Will I be figured out? 
Where, and by whom, will my body be located?  
I was, in 2016, unaware of how embodied codes operate to construct a readable body recognised as 
either, and only, Catholic or Protestant. I did, however, become acutely aware of the repeated 
questioning following, if not all, then, most of the meetings that compromised my first research visit: Why 
are you interested in Northern Ireland? You have an Irish name? But have you ever lived in Ireland? 
Were you born here? Why Belfast? And you come from a British university? But your father is also Irish?  
At the time, I was perturbed by the incessant questioning, which was less about my research, as might 
have been expected, and more about me. Each response was met with a further question. I soon sensed 
that I was not providing the correct answers; I was failing to surrender the information required  the 
detail through which embodied and habituated processes of categorisation could take place. But, at this 
stage, I did not know the recognisable answers. I had not learnt the steps of the dance. I did not know 
the routine. The world I knew, the legacy I had inherited, was not one divided by Catholic or Protestant. 
Later, on moving to Belfast to continue my research, the worlds I found myself in were firmly polarised 
by the divisive Catholic-Protestant horizon, upon which the very foundations of the city rest. With the 
division between the two communities forming the backdrop to everyday life, I soon found myself 
3 Recognition is often mobilised as an activity of knowing or making, as re-cognition, which is inherently more 
creative than how I, following Irigaray, employ the term throughout the thesis. In the context of the geographical 
literature, recognition as I mobilise it may be better thought of as representation.  
replicating and acculturating the steps of the dance of recognition. Answers to the inquisitive questions 
framing meetings soon became scripted by recognisable information. I also rebounded the coded 
questions back towards my partner, in what I quickly came to regard as the habitual dance of 
recognition. The need to dance, the desire to know who was standing before me, took over and quickly 
choreographed all contact. I did not seek to encounter the body, to touch and listen-to the body I was 
meeting for the first time. Instead, I quickly learned to consume recognisable, short-hand codes.  
My first thoughts on meeting someone, the questions that would vibrate throughout my body, were: are 
you Catholic or Protestant? Which box do you fit into? Where do you reside  geographically, culturally, 
politically?' When the information needed was not immediately available, or when it was, albeit rarely, 
withheld,4 I found myself dissecting the conversation to search deeply for the codes that would identify 
and betray the body as Catholic or Protestant. The need to know, the need to position bodies stood 
before became addictive. It became a game: could I guess correctly? Had I mastered the codes those 
around me seemed to know intuitively? My desire to belong in the space my everyday resided in, came 
to script my perception, as I recognised others through an external filter of precomprehension (Irigaray 
2017: 63). When achieved, the answer meant little, at least to me; but knowing  the reduction of a 
body to a label  was imperative.  
The habitual dance of recognition works to construct a partitioned horizon of sameness, wherein polarised 
bodies of the self and other are constructed as essentialised objects. Whilst this is largely an invisible 
violence, at times it erupts in acts of tangible violence. The bullets that killed Lyra McKee ricocheted from 
within the dance of recognition. The New IRA fired shots on the streets of Derry towards the PSNI. Those 
firing the shots were the ceasefire babies or their younger siblings. They were those who were born in 
the time of peace. They had no direct memory of the brutal violence of the Troubles. Yet, via the 
interplay of territorial division and binary identity politics, they inherit a sensible horizon of difference 
that standardises an image of the enemy; an image that recognises a priori the PSNI as British crown 
enemy forces to be hate. The PSNI were prehended as a legitimate target.5  
The violence that killed Lyra McKee interrupted  if only for a moment  the stasis of what is. In the 
wake of Lyra McKees death calls for peace rang out across Northern Ireland, while gestures of peace 
and unity filled television screens. We heard about the hope and the tenacity of Lyra McKee and her 
work. And, more of us since have read her own words calling for a better future, for life and living. We 
4 When this information was withheld it was always a conscious act against Northern Irelands divisive partitions 
articulated through the refusal of categorisation. Refusal, however, takes effort and requires circumventing aspects 
of ones life and up bringing that are unavoidably shaped through the Catholic-Protestant binary.  
5 The PSNI succeeded the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and was established as part of the Good Friday 
Agreement. The RUC had a 92% Protestant majority and was long viewed by Catholics as an enforcer of 
Protestant domination (Archick 2005: 5). The RUC played a counterinsurgency role during the Troubles, which 
disproportionately and, at times, violently impacted the Catholic and Nationalist community. The Catholic 
community, then, came to fear the RUC, while the Protestant community viewed them as a symbolic conduit that 
went right to the heart of their identities (Ellison 2007: 246)  their identities as Protestants and Unionists, and their 
political fight for the natural union of Northern Ireland with Great Britain.  
have also followed her own life in the numerous tributes that tell of how a small child adorned with an 
eye patch and in need of remedial classes to assist her reading, grew into the brave, young winner of 
several acclaimed journalistic prizes, and was later named by Forbes magazine as one its 30 under 30 
in media in Europe (McKay 2019). We read of her kindness, her compassion, her affection.  
Yet, we have heard only of Lyra McKees life after her death and, thus, I echo the words of Father Martin 
Magill: why is it only in the cloud of death and violence that we look for peace? Lyra McKees life voices 
peace-full instances, moments, stories, and relations active within the starkly divided and conflicted 
society in which she grew up in. If there are moments of peace always-already respiring within Northern 
Ireland then why do we only ever hear, and always tell, stories of war violence and vision? Why does it 
take death for peace to be heard and what do we risk by only listening to peace after we have heard 
violence?  
Division is all too visible in Belfast. Living in Belfast requires navigating lines and borders of separation 
that are at once cultural, geographical, political, and social. It involves being pulled apart and bounded. 
Yet, instances of everyday, positive peace respire alongside division. Streams of Union Jacks blow in the 
wind as they claim bounded territories and the pained eyes of Bobby Sands stare down from the walls 
of west Belfast. Yet, as soon as Naomi learnt I was running to and from rugby training she immediately 
insisted on dropping me home, despite the different boundaries this involved crossing. While Catholic 
bodies walk along one side of the Albert Bridge as they leave the city centre, Protestant bodies stay 
firmly on the other side. I first walked along Albert Bridge just before Christmas 2016 as I headed to 
Turas, the Irish language school and site of much of my research, to meet with Linda.6 At the end of our 
conversation, Linda wished me nollaig shona dhuit and embraced me with a huge hug, the warmth of 
which I can still feel today. The daily debates on the Nolan Show  an Ulster based BBC talk show  
acutely voice the hard line political, social, and cultural positions of Northern Ireland as callers endlessly 
engage in zero-sum debates. The same voices, however, generously gave their time to meet, to talk, and 
to share stories: with one lady, a regular listener and champion of Stephen Nolans hard-talk, offering 
her homemade Indian chutney as we chatted during the lunch break of her yoga teacher training course, 
another sneakily paying for the breakfast we had enjoyed as we chatted while a Dictaphone sat 
between us.  
In focussing, in what follows, on the intimate relations of care, generosity, kindness, and friendship, my 
aim is not to gloss over the legacies of conflict and division that stubbornly persist. Rather, my aim is to 
illustrate and explore the desire for, and movements of, intimate relations of difference that constitute 
peace and peacebuilding. These, I argue, form the basis for cultivating an alternative ecological horizon 
which has much to teach us about the meaning and practice of peace, more, perhaps, than theorising

Turas and Linda we agreed together anonymising her name would be futile.  
peace as the absence of violence. Indeed, as I will argue, care, generosity, kindness, and friendship are 
constituted in the always already relational, material grounds of lived intimacy that arise as the 
entangled and shared embodiments of everyday life in Northern Ireland. 
In this thesis, I argue the question of peace in Northern Ireland and perhaps beyond cannot be founded 
on tolerance, equality, or mutual understanding among persons. Peace cannot be founded within a 
horizon of sameness, in which bodies are either posited as dualistic or as a common whole. Both these 
positions approach the self and the other as known identities, as graspable in their entirety, and engulf 
and dissipate the potential of the in-between. Rather, as a scholar inspired by a feminist politics, I 
approach the question of peace as an active, transformative making. This does not mean imposing a 
fixed, timeless or utopian vision of peace upon empirical reality and critically deconstructing the capacity 
of the real world to measure up. Nor does it sacrifice the potential of peace to the non-violent or less-
than-violent; an impossible perfection always-already subsumed by the originary position of conflict and 
agonism. The political emphasis of this thesis is not locatable in a critical assessment of the what is, of 
the stasis and division of post-conflict Belfast, but moves with an extant weaving of alternative worlds 
making speculative futures within the immanence of the present (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018). So, I ask: 
how are immanent relations of differentiation in proximity weaving a positive understanding of peace 
from within living vitality respiring in shared exchanges of everyday sociality? 
As I will argue across the chapters that follow, making an alternative ecological horizon that opens the 
potential for peace is neither a spontaneous occurrence, nor is it a blueprint preconceived from an 
external position. Rather, it takes shape from emerging, situated relations of extant proximity in 
difference that confronts the abstract stasis of what is and animates novel and shared ways of 
becoming, through choosing controversial movements and continual reiterations of care. Of course, such 
often small efforts hold no guarantee of success. Neither are emerging successes guaranteed to be 
permanent, unwavering, or reproducible in time or space. But herein lies precisely the analytical and 
political intent of this dissertation: to contribute to the durability and extension of a positive, everyday, 
relational ontology of peace that is always-already emerging alongside, but independent from, spaces 
and times of violence, by respiring with the situated relations and gestures of emergence, and so 
highlighting the comprehensive, if speculative, possibility and hope they offer as they weave alternative 
spatialisations of bodies and worlds. 
1.3 Relat ional i ty as Ontology, Epistemology, and Methodology 
A key claim of this thesis, developed in different ways throughout, is the answer to the question of, and 
commitment to, positive peace can be found through close movements with everyday relations of 
differential proximity already-active in the course of urban sociality. I use the concept of encounter  
which I read as relations of differentiation in proximity  as a centrepiece for engaging with and 
detailing the materiality and movement of difference in Belfast. Everyday relations are central to the 
cultivation and weaving of peace-full possibilities. It is through relationality that bodies touch-upon, 
move-with, and make difference. By difference, I do not refer to pre-determined and essentialised 
characteristics, performances, and labels, in which bodies are always-already known. Rather, I approach 
difference as a movement that is always becoming. The aim then is not to define or re-define differences 
and, so, what it means to be Catholic or Protestant, but to trace the relational movements of difference 
in their emergence. To focus on the everyday relationality of difference illustrates both the challenges 
of making and re-making peace, and the potential of relationality for opening on shared, peaceful 
worlds. Even within the acutely divided city of Belfast, I argue relationality can cultivate new and 
transformative ways of living and becoming that redefine and animate the becoming of an everyday, 
positive ontology of peace.  
While I elaborate my approach to the encounter as a relation of differentiation in proximity, and the 
potential of such, in the subsequent chapters, some introduction to how relationality is conceived and 
mobilised as a prelude to describing the thesis and its structure are required. To trace the encounter as 
a specific form of relationality, encompassing both difference and proximity, mobilises the encounter as 
more-than the coming together of contact in space. Instead I seek to think through relationality as 
ontology, epistemology, and methodology. I have chosen to animate this engagement and attend to 
already-active relations through the vector of breath.  
First, I consider relations of differentiation in proximity as the foundation to an ontology of everyday, 
positive peace. Geography has made a firm commitment to peace that extends beyond negative 
understandings and, in many instances, exceeds liberal models of democratic agreement and peace 
accords. Peace, rather, is understood as a fragile, iterative activity emerging from everyday, mutually 
constitutive relations and embodiments situated within an affective micropolitics. The commitment to 
problematising the content of peace and understanding the differential and spatial processes by which 
peace is constructed, contested, practised, and interpreted (Williams, Megoran and McConnell 2014), 
stems most prominently from critical geography and geopolitics whose theoretical commitments are firmly 
rooted within social agonism. Social agonism reads difference and, so, sociality as necessarily and 
irreducibly violent, antagonistic, and divisive (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018). Reserving, however, an 
originary position for violence and conflict precludes the possibilities of peace from the outset, critical 
scholarship, therein, is limited to the moments of violencealways present in our assumptions of peace 
(Darling 2014: 244). Peace-as-peace becomes an impossible perfection as positive conceptions of 
peace are pulled back into a divisive horizon, wherein peace is limited to the non-violent or less-than-
violent. 
I opt for a different theoretical starting point and one that is perhaps unprecedented in the geography 
of peace literature, if not the geographical discipline more broadly. To read encounters as relations of 
differentiation in proximity is to animate an intimate engagement with the thinking of Luce Irigaray. 
Whilst Irigaray is rarely read as a political theorist, her work is inherently political in nature. Irigaray is 
highly critical of the current hierarchical horizon of sameness which she argue is an innately violent 
structure. Her thinking, however, moves beyond critique and seeks the creation of an alternative 
ontological horizon, in which difference is both relational and autonomous.  
Opposed to the self being engineered through rooted legacies that pre-construct the body before its 
birth, Irigaray illustrates the living body in a perpetual movement of becoming  a relational movement 
of difference which is always-already venturing beyond that which has been known and experienced in 
life. Relationality is the very becoming of difference; it is the materialisation of the autonomous to-be. 
To think difference as relational is not to forgo autonomy but, rather, to ground the becoming of 
autonomy within an ecology of relations. By ecology I mean relational, dynamic, and, fundamentally, 
the mutually constitutive, ontological relations necessary for life and possibility. Within ecologies, the self 
and the other do not exist within an agonistic, hierarchical horizon of sameness, in which the latter is only 
ever the lesser version of the former. Rather, difference moves within a constellation of embodied and 
sensuous relations active prior to representational form, and thus beyond the limits of the binary self vs 
other; multiplicities here relate. 
In placing relationality at the heart of the living and lively world of the everyday, I am choosing an 
ontological position that privileges not agonism and violence but an ecological, material, embodied, and 
dynamic sociality. To conceptualise peace as woven from the necessary relationality of autonomous 
bodies in active doings affirms everyday processes of socio-ecological care and reciprocity through 
which shared, ecological worlds are created. It is in the elemental, relational movement of breath that 
the body, as a to-be, takes root and gives life, gives movement, towards the blossoming, growth, and 
becoming of the self, the other, and the shared in-between. 
Secondly, I deploy relations of differentiation in proximity as an epistemology attentive to breath, wherein 
I move with breath to co-create knowledge about everyday relationalities opening onto the potential of 
peace. Relations of differentiation in proximity take place in breath. Irigaray locates the violence of the 
current horizon of sameness in a forgetting of breath. The creation of a new and shared horizon, then, 
lies in a return to breath and to the embodied practice of breathing. Breath folds in-between the inside 
and the outside animating a continual oscillation in-between relationality and autonomy, in-between 
tending-towards and withdrawal, in-between intimacy and distance, in-between differentiation and 
proximity. Breath, as the very movement of living vitality, is the element that holds relationality and 
autonomy in tension; it is the element animating relations of differentiation in proximity. The body, 
through the practice of breathing, cultivates the capacity to animate the movement of its own self-
generation, yet this is a movement that is always-already in an emerging, embodied relation to the 
other, unknown body. I attend to the movement and materiality of breath to analyse the unexpected 
outcomes and political potential of an ecological horizon that emerges in relations of differentiation in 
proximity across Belfast  whether these encounters are mediated by Northern Irelands formal Peace 
Process, are outcomes of a conscious shift in orientation, or are unexpected and surprising interruptions 
to the normative. 
I take the following questions regarding relations of differentiation in proximity, as animated in a sharing 
of breath, as my epistemological entry point to the study of everyday, positive peaces. The first set of 
question relates to the very becoming of relationality in a city as acutely divided as Belfast. How are 
bodies, worlds, and cultures approached from within a segregated society that has forgotten the very 
practice of breathing? What ignites territorialised body in a queer movement that risks habitual, 
inherited norms and the stasis of the current horizon? A second set of questions concerns the very activity 
of encounters as an opening onto speculative possibilities for peace. Principally it asks, what happens in 
spaces of encounter wherein the self and other respire in relations of proximity in difference? This 
requires asking: how do encounters composed of breath animate extant, dynamic, and surprising 
relations in which differences emerge? And how do generative relations in-between transcend the division 
and territorialisations pervading Northern Irish identity politics and its normative process to re-spatialise 
the political and, so, perspectives for understanding peace? The third set of questions directly addresses 
the ethical horizon of breath. They ask what makes breath a natural, ethical caring? How are gestures 
of care, which extend beyond tolerance and mutual understanding, woven and what do these relations 
look like? Principally this thesis asks: what does breath mean for peace? 
The questions I pose here are not conclusive. Nor do I promise to answer them definitively. I move with 
these questions to trouble the stasis of what is  both the empirical stasis of Northern Ireland and the 
theoretical stasis of the non-violent and less-than-violent  and to speculatively move with the openings 
animated in this troubling  a movement that perhaps animates more questions than answers. I write from 
within the specific space-time of contemporary Belfast. Yet, I contend the events and relations could and, 
what is more, need to be told from many other post-conflict societies if geography is to fulfil its 
commitment to a positive, everyday ontology of peace. This is not, however, to suggest universalising 
experiences and doings of peace. The weak knowledge created is variable across time and space. To 
commit to a relational conception of peace, is to cultivate a contextual commitment wherein knowledge 
is always situated and local. Situated knowledge cannot make universal claims or gain hegemony. This 
is not my intention. Rather, I seek to tell stories of everyday relations within Belfast and the peaceful 
gestures these relations engender, even among the divisions and ongoing violence. I contend these stories 
provide a provocation for thinking about how we as geographers think and engage with peace, 
encounters, and the political. 
Third, I approach respiring relations of differentiation as methodology. Moving with the ontology and 
epistemology outlined, I animate an affective, entangled Irigarayan methodology to trace breath and 
the relations animated in the practice of breathing. Tracing, as both methodology and method, moves 
with the ephemeral, relational, fluid, open, and sensual nature of breath. It cultivates an embodied, 
ongoing, and situated way of doing research and shifts familiar geographic methods towards the 
creativity of touch, relationality, listening-to, and the poetical. Although deploying a range of methods, 
the activity of tracing necessitated ethnographic engagement, which I understand as an eclectic 
methodological choice[privileging] an engaged, contextually rich and nuanced type of qualitative 
social research, in which fine grained daily interactions constitute the lifeblood of the data produced 
(Falzon 2016: 1). An ethnographic engagement, thus, requires a deep and sustained engagement in the 
field. 
Following two separate research visits in July 2016 and December 2016, I moved to Belfast on January 
6th 2017, where I lived until November 19th 2017. During my first research visit, I continually heard about 
the Turas Irish language project. Turas is a space firmly residing at the intersection of Belfast 
contemporary territorial, cultural, and political divisions. It is located in the heart of Protestant east 
Belfast, a territory in which the Irish language is traditionally recognised as threatening, Republican 
nonsense. The Irish language has a long, complex and conflictual legacy across the island of Ireland but 
it has not been a causal factor in the modern violent self-determination dispute in Northern Ireland  
both the Catholic and Protestant community speak English (Mitchell and Miller 2019: 236). Yet, the 
language contained a deep symbolic significance during the Troubles that is today articulated in the 
current cultural wars through which contemporary communal competition outplays (McMonagle and 
McDermott 2014). The Good Friday Agreement posed the question regarding the official status and 
protection of the Irish language and, today, Stormont remains suspended as, among other divisive issues, 
the DUP and Sinn Fin continue to search for an impossible agreement regarding an Irish Language Act, 
which the latter support and the former are intent on blocking.  
The Northern Irish Peace Process has sought to address directly the ongoing cultural wars, as it seeks to 
create a society in which culture can be celebrated in a shared and mutually inclusive way (Northern 
Ireland Executive 2013: 7). Shared, inclusive cultural celebration is destined as the outcome of good 
relations between the Catholic and Protestant community, built via join activities, shared learning, and 
respect for diversity. Traditionally, the Peace Process has sought to foster good relations via dialogue. 
As cultural expression is an increasing focal point of tension, the art and sport have also become principal 
arenas for building good relations across communities and their cultures. Language, also, has been noted 
as a cultural expression with capacity to bring people together and create a shared community (see 
Northern Ireland Executive 2013: 91). A shared language not only offers a unifying symbol 
communicating and promoting reconciliation (Ross 2012), but the practice of language learning holds the 
capacity to initiate a humanising effect by animating an avenue for encountering another groups 
history, culture, and experience, and undermining the exclusivism of traditional myth-symbol complexes 
(Mitchell and Miller 2019: 238). Turas is not a product of the Peace Process. However, it has animated 
a space in which peace is potentially being woven through sustained, intimate, and entangled, 
fundamentally breathing encounters. I engage with Turas as an organic, everyday space of sustained 
encounters through which the ordinary can be grappled with but not generalised from.  
Whilst Turas is the principal focus of the thesis, I also speak from experiences firmly grounded within the 
formal Peace Process. Prior to moving to Northern Ireland, I initially secured desk space with the Centre 
for Conflict Studies* (CTS).7 The CTS* is a charity engaging in the activity of formal peacebuilding and 
conflict transformation, largely through the arts. Although originally not intended as empirical space, 
before long I was engaging with and directly assisting the peacebuilding and conflict transformation 
work of CTS*. Whilst Turas exists on the margins of the Peace Process, my involvement with the CTS*s 
work provided invaluable first-hand experience of the workings of formal peacebuilding in present day 
Northern Ireland. 
1.4 Thesis Out l ine 
My first substantive chapter  Chapter Two: Encountering Northern Ireland  traces the context of 
Northern Ireland. I discuss contemporary Northern Ireland with a specific focus on the capital city Belfast, 
arguing the territorial legacy of the Troubles engineers the other as a feared object, with the 
consequence that safety becomes predicated on avoidance. After discussing the current suspension of 
the Northern Ireland Executive and the threat posed by Brexit, the chapter moves from the present day 
to the historical context of Northern Ireland. Starting with the colonial conquest of Northern Ireland, I 
briefly trace the history of the island of Ireland. The chapter ends with a discussion of the Northern Irish 
Peace Process. I outline the political events that led to the historic signing of the Good Friday Agreement 
and detail the process of everyday peacebuilding within the community and voluntary sector, with a 
specific focus on the construction of good relations through cross-community contact.  
Chapter Three addresses the coordinates informing my theoretical framework and empirical 
engagement. This chapter first reviews the literature around peace. I broadly situate my work within the 
geographies of peace literature. Despite theorising peace as an active process woven in the everyday, 
geographies of peace have largely failed  peace as an everyday, positive doing remains a vague, 
untheorised concept. Following Harry Bregazzi and Mark Jackson (2018), I locate this failure in the 
dominant theoretical engagement informing the geographies of peace literature which, in taking social 
agonism as its starting point, forecloses the potential for theorising from peace from the outset. Peace, 
both theoretically and empirically, is reduced to the less-than-violent or non-violent. Peace will not be 
found in a movement of critique; peace necessitates change and transformation. Irigarays work is 
inherently creative, particularly in its latter aspect where it moves most acutely with breath. It is the 
mobilisation of breath within Irigarays thinking that this chapter next addresses. Whilst agonism reads 
difference as necessarily conflictual and divisive, the practice of breathing animates and moves with 
differences that are at once relational, autonomous, proximate, and dynamic. This theoretical movement 
opens the potential for an empirical engagement with the capacity to attend to the already-active 
peaceful encounters. The third section of this chapter considers the geographies of encounters literature 
7 In order to preserve the anonymity of the organisation this is a fictious pseudonym and acronym.  
and argues if encounters are transformative spaces of making worlds, relations, and bodies differently, 
then, we need to begin to question what happens in spaces of encounter. 
Chapter Four voices the affective, entangled, Irigarayan methodology that guided my engagement in 
the field and beyond. Geographers traditionally seek to map the focus of their research. The very 
movement and materiality of breath, however, evades mapping. Rather than mapping, an Irigarayan 
methodology animates an affective, entangled, and embodied tracing creating dynamic forms of 
knowledge and knowledge-making that are never static, definitive, or delineating. I detail the three 
principle characteristics of tracing  engaging the whole body, moving in-between, and situatedness  
and then set forth the methods employed to animate a methodology of tracing. Finally, I detail the two 
empirical spaces that form the focus of my research. 
Three empirical chapters follow in which I trace how encounters taking place in breath weave speculative, 
peace-full worlds. The fifth chapter  Breathing Movement  traces how the possibility for authentic 
encounters or, more precisely, relations of differentiation in proximity arise in segregated Belfast. Firstly, 
it details how the Irish language is traditionally recognised from a Protestant orientation. Here, I move 
in-between Irigarays philosophy, Sara Ahmeds thinking, and the territorial nature of contemporary 
Belfast to trace how standardised truths, and their identarian politics, construct the Irish language as a 
threatening and fearful object unavailable from a Protestant orientation. In the context of Belfasts 
acute territorialisation where movements across borders are approached with a hesitant caution, it is 
critical to consider the forces propelling queer movements before we can begin to think through what 
happens in the encounter. I locate queer movements towards Turas in curiosity and desire. Following 
Erin Manning, I read desire as a desire for movement; a desire for change, transformation, and becoming 
opposed to the territorial, rooted stasis of what is. Bodies respond to the curious call from the other by 
questioning the stasis of ones own dwelling. Desire moves with an internal questioning that risks the 
sameness of the current horizon and queers the bodys orientation in an unfamiliar, novel movement 
towards Turas.  
Before chapter six, there is a brief interlude. The interlude is firmly grounded in the peacebuilding cross-
community work of the CTS*. Its presence is necessary to give voice to the present concerns and issues 
regarding the current structure and lack of freedom in Northern Irelands the peacebuilding sector. What 
is more, it provides a contrast to the activity of encounters taking place in Turas, which is the focus of the 
next chapter.  
The sixth chapter  Encountering Breath  moves with the space of Turas and the practice of breathing 
to begin to think through what happens in spaces of encounter. Irigarays thinking offers three key aspects 
 wonder, silence, and sharing  of the encounter. This chapter respires with these entangled aspects. 
Wonder is the very movement of difference and, I argue, in Turas bodies are engaged in a practice of 
listening-to, in which they touch upon mystery and surprise as they experience the fullness of wonder. 
Following wonder, this chapter next considers the movement of silence in the encounter. Silence maintains 
wonder by cultivating relational limits that respect the wondrous unknown, whilst also returning the body 
to its own breath and becoming. Finally, this chapter discusses sharing. To encounter the other in a relation 
of wonder and silence is to cultivate the potential for shared worlds moving in-between. To share with 
the other is not to become the other, but to share in third worlds emerging in the proximity and intimacy 
of difference. Moving with encounters requires a tracing of breath and folded within the chapter is the 
practice of breathing; it folds in-between the inside and the outside, in draws together different bodies 
as well as pulling them apart, and animates emerging and speculative dialogues in-between different 
thinkers. I contend encounters taking place in breath create an alternative horizon to the Catholic-
Protestant binary that continues to characterise Northern Ireland twenty-one years after the signing of 
the Good Friday Agreement. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the immanent, if speculative, 
ecological horizon cultivated in a sharing of breath.  
Chapter Seven  Breathing a Speculative Ethics of Care  respires within this alternative, ecological 
horizon. Moving with an alternative, transformed horizon, which does not view difference as necessarily 
agonistic; is necessary to become attentive to the everyday, peaceful relations always-already being 
woven. Peace is woven through relations of love, friendship, compassion, nurture, trust, and care  
gestures of care compose the focus of this chapter. Theoretically the chapter moves in-between Irigarays 
ethics and Mara Puig de la Bellacasas speculative ethics of care. Puig de la Bellacasa conceives of 
care as an everyday relationality cultivating the perpetual renewal of life, bodies, and worlds: it is an 
ethics germinating in speculative, aerial ecologies in their making. I argue that breath is always-already 
a speculative opening to a natural, ethical caring for the living vitality of the self and of the (human or 
non-human) other in an ongoing and shared relation in-between. Having traced the theoretical argument 
and considered the limits of breath as a gesture of care, the chapter details the relational processes 
through which peaceful relations emerge. Tolerance is first discussed as a failure of care and, in turn, a 
failure of peace-as-peace. The next two sections consider care as, first, an affective agency and, 
secondly, as a loving commitment, with the former consideration grounded in the peacebuilding work of 
the CTS* and the latter in the space of Turas. Care as an affective agency holds practical and material 
consequences weaving moments of peace. However, as caring spaces are pulled to the political vision 
of the elite, affectivity is also bound up with fatigue, calculability, and greed. The fourth section traces 
Turas as a space respiring with love which, I argue, animates an obliging commitment of caring for the 
Irish language across territorial difference. This chapter concludes by thinking through the commoning 
cultivated in a respiring ethics of care. I mobilise the term commoning not as an abstraction from the 
world but an active force of this world (Thiele 2014: 203, original emphasis); as a thinking-practice 
implicated and concerned with making peaceful worlds. 
The concluding chapter posits peace as an everyday, care-full weaving in-between bodies and worlds 
actively unfolding an alternative, transformed horizon that we are always-already part of. Peace is 
active, relational, ecological, embodied, situated, everyday, and always-already emerging. In the 
conclusion, I offer a series of implications that are academic and practical, with both empirical and 
methodological ramification for peace and geography more broadly. These implications are not 
necessarily clear cut and the conclusions they suggest are neither definitive nor decisive but open and 
ephemeral. They are implications calling out for engagement, relationality, questioning, and critique, as 
this thesis is read and mobilised in a manner that exceeds its own limited parameters.  
Throughout, the thesis is intersected with respites and interruptions. Respites directly voice the situated 
practices of breathing that the thesis respires with. Following Magdalena Grska (2016), the respites 
are intended to act as a poetic voice of the dispersed potentiality of breath respiring with, yet always 
exceeding, the implications of the thesis. They draw the body back to breath and offer a short break or 
pause in the text providing the space-time to breathe. The respites fold within and in-between the 
different lines of argument, entangling them in a shared respiration that continues beyond the text. 
Alongside respites, I offer several interruptions. These interruptions interject the narrative with moments 
and instances of violence, conflict, and division. They bring the body back to the reality of Belfast and 
demonstrate the constant struggle between conflict and peace. They are also a theoretical statement 
arguing against a negative conception of peace and an originary position for violence or peace. Conflict 
and peace exist simultaneously, and these respites and interruptions call upon the reader to recognise 
that within pervasive and persistent violence and division there is always-already relations opening onto 
the speculative possibility of peace.  
Encountering Northern Ireland 
2.1 The Dual City:  Belfast today 
These places are the deep black holes, you know the whole Lion King: anywhere the light touches in yours; 
these were the dark shadow land you must never go to. 
(Dan, Interview September 2nd 2017) 
With a burgeoning food and bar scene, hip cities brimming with energy and the breath-taking Causeway 
coastline, Northern Ireland, and particularly its capital city, have put their mark on the map as one of 
Europes most friendly, spirited, and lively spots (Lonely Planet 2019). In the last twenty years Belfast 
has blossomed. Contemporary Belfast celebrates an energy, stylishness and regeneration. This externally 
projected narrative masks, however, a very different reality. 
What sort of place is Northern Ireland? You could come as a tourist or on business  particularly on 
a sunny day  and believe that everything is normal, indeed that you are in a very attractive place. 
Most visitors will have heard of the Troubles, but it is easy to believe superficially that they are 
over and done with. However, if you picked up a local newspaper, switched on the radio, tuned 
into the local Twitter traffic, or visited in July, you would quickly recognise that all is not, even twenty 
years after the peace agreement was signed, entirely well with Northern Ireland... It is possible to 
live and work almost entirely normally in Northern Ireland  especially with eyes wide shut  but it 
is not a normal place (Cosstick 2019: 1). 
Northern Ireland  in more ways than one  is characterised by the duality of two distinct realities, two 
parallel worlds. On the one hand, Northern Ireland projects an image of growth, style, and 
cosmopolitanism, with the sparkling, glass dome of Victoria Square and the bright, bustle of the Titanic 
Quarter. An estimated 4.9 million people visited Northern Ireland in 2018 (Northern Ireland Statistics 
and Research Agency 2018), with The Guardian and Observer readers voting Belfast Best UK City in 
the papers 2016 travel awards (Wilson 2016: 63). Yet, on the other hand, and despite last year 
marking the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland is 
suspended in an unwavering stasis: troubling and emotive legacy issues remain unresolved; Stormont is 
in limbo; paramilitary groups continue to assert violent control and spread sectarian ideology; children 
are still divided by segregated education; and, everyday worlds remain rooted in fragmented and 
bounded territories.  
Territory often provides the focal point to any ethnonational conflict. Violence is routinely grounded in 
the active process of territorialisation wherein impermeable boundaries of exclusion and inclusion are 
constructed. Territorialisation is not a passive process (Megoran 2013); it spatialises land through 
identifications claimed via acts of power, dominance, and belonging (Cowen and Gilbert 2008). The 
territorial legacy of violence has arguably left the deepest and most visible mark upon Belfast, with the 
capital acting as the principal theatre for the drama of fragmentation (McFarlane 2018: 1008, see 
also Davidson and Iveson 2015; Massey 2007; Roy 2016a).8 Usually approached through the four 
cardinal points, today Belfast is a mosaic of different villages, each with a distinct identity  Catholic or 
Protestant  and a defined territorial boundary. In north Belfast a patchwork plays out almost at a street 
level, with neighbouring housing estates having a dominant Catholic or Protestant identity. In contrast, 
save for the largely Protestant Shankill Road, west Belfast persists as almost exclusively Catholic. East 
Belfast tends to be mostly Protestant apart from the Catholic enclave of Short Strand. Meanwhile, 
anchored by Queens University, south Belfast demonstrates less definition in the separation of 
communities, with some pockets of mixed neighbourhoods (Hocking et al. 2018: 3). Belfasts borders 
replicate the constitutional border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which remains 
a central symbolic feature of political and cultural discord (Shirlow and Murtag 2006). 
The boundaries of Belfasts mosaic of villages are visually marked by peace walls, flags, graffiti, murals 
and painted kerbstones. Constructed in response to escalating violence and disorder between the 
Catholic and Protestant communities during the Troubles (Gormley-Heenan, Byrne, and Robinson 2013),9 
peace walls were originally conceived as temporary measures to increase feelings of security (Shirlow 
2008). Peace walls have become, however, a permanent feature of Northern Irelands landscape, with 
in excess of one hundred barriers in existence today (Belfast Interface Project 2017). Utilising religion 
as a boundary marker (Shirlow and Murtag 2006), peace walls and symbolic markings operate to bound 
space as the influence of a determined ethnonational community (Shirlow 2003a; Komarova and 
McKnight 2013). Symbolic markings also work internally, both to define and control the interests of those 
residing within the bounded territory (Marijan 2015), and to haunt the space with the legacy of a violent 
historical memory predicated on an us-them narrative (Rieff 2011).  
The continued partitioning and fixing of space in Belfast have overwhelmingly been engineered through 
a fear of that which is not us (Manning 2000: 53). Fear is not simply an individual state but also a 
collective and social experience, embedded in moral, political, and social geographies (Pain and Smith 
2008). Territorial boundaries and symbolic markings work together to produce the fearful body as 
distinctly separate, as apart from the feared body. Fear, then, simultaneously works through proximity 
and division. It spatialises two bodies within a binary horizon of sameness by bringing the very presence 
of the feared other into the construction of the fearful, pure, and moral self, whilst also forging an 
oppositional distinction, and so separation, between the two (Ahmed 2003, 2004). Separation becomes 
tangible through the erection of walls, and borders which construct an impermeable boundary marking 
8 . Of approximately 3,700 deaths, Belfast witnessed roughly 40% of these, although less than 20% of the regional 
population lived in the capital (Dixon 2008; Gaffikin and Morrissey 2011). Two thirds of Northern Irelands 
sectarian killings occurred inside the capitals boundaries (McAlister 2011; Morrissey and Smyth 2001). 
9 The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) set a target in 2012 for removing the peace 
walls by 2023 (Wilson 2016: 65). In the face of minimal progress and with communities continuing to locate feelings 
of security and comfort in the sustained presence of the physical barriers, this target seems unattainable and even 
unrealistic (see Belfast Telegraph 2015). The 2016 Peace Monitoring Report indicated 30% of people wanted the 
walls to remain intact, with 78% of the respondents believing removal would result in incidents of anti-social 
behaviour and/or sectarian violence (Wilson 2016). 
the point where we end and they begin (Harris et al. 2017); a clear dividing line between us and them 
(Barad 2014), between safe and unsafe. Peace walls maintain the other in an abeyance of drawing-
close (Heidegger 1962: 80). The other is always there but not quite present (Ahmed 2004: 65).  
Ian Shuttleworth and James Anderson (2002: 151) describe fear as a deeply conditioned reflex' the 
body is habitually conditioned to feel when travelling through unknown spaces represented as 
dangerous. Fear activates a habitual turn towards spaces that are represented as safe and a movement 
away from spaces that are known as unsafe (Ahmed 2006). These habits coalesce in collective 
geographical imaginaries that engineer highly segregated patters of movement around Belfast:10 who 
goes where, when, why and along what routes is an ingrained feature of the local geographic 
imagination (Whyatt et al. 2016: n.p.). Ideological maps of fear and anxiety spatially manifest through 
routes, paths, and directions of movement (England and Simon 2010). Belfast is navigated by visible 
borders that  alongside more silent and hidden, if no less real, boundaries (Kuusisto 2001; Marijan 
2015; Rajaram and Grundy-Warr 2007)  act as geographical coordinating devices (Bude and 
Drrschmidt 2010). These coordinating devices pilot unsafe spaces via avoidance, evasion, and removal 
(Pain and Smith 2008); they minimise the potential for contact across dividing lines (Bell and Young 
2013; Hocking et al. 2018). Thus, in post-conflict Belfast civic and social life tends to occur within, rather 
than across ethnic cleavages (Nagle 2013: 78). Although operative in the everyday, division and 
segregation is firmly rooted in Northern Irelands contemporary political framework, which I now turn my 
attention to.  
2.1.1 The fai lure of power sharing  
Political ideology in Northern Ireland is firmly entrenched in territorial dualisms. The Good Friday 
Agreement institutionalised a power-sharing Northern Irish Assembly, representing both the Unionists and 
the Nationalists through the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, who together head up the 
Northern Ireland Executive (Mac Ginty, Muldoon and Ferguson 2007). As joint chairs of the Executive, 
the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are required to pursue agreement on all issues. If either the 
First or Deputy Minister resigns, then, by default the other automatically ceases to hold office and their 
parties, which will always be the largest party within the largest political designation and the largest 
party within the second-largest political designation, must nominate new heads of state (Torrance 2018). 
Segregation ensures the dominant Unionist party and the dominant Nationalist party are both 
represented in the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), while power-sharing works 
to institutionalise Protestant Unionism and Catholic Nationalism (Mac Ginty, Muldoon and Ferguson 
2007). As Colin Knox (2010: 8) articulates, devolution in Northern Ireland is inextricably linked to the 
10 The segregated patterns of movement around Belfast are well researched. A significant proportion of this 
research engages with fear in a broad sense (see England and Simon 2010; Shirlow 2003a, 2008; Shirlow and 
Murtagh 2006), whilst others take a more focussed perspective considering, for example, the interaction between 
fear and mobility in the context of leisure (Bairner and Shirlow 2003), the border (Bell, Jarman and Harvey 2010), 
sport (Hargie, Dickinson and ODonnell 2006), and adolescents (Leonard 2010; McAlister, Scraton and Haydon 
2014; McGrellis 2010; Roche 2008; Roulston et al. 2017). 
divisive issues which precipitated its inception and characterises its operation in practice. Northern Irish 
devolution takes segregation as an unwavering given and grounds its power in sectarian headcounts 
(Mitchell 2006), which in turn preserves the segregated structure of Northern Irish society.  
From the outset devolution has not been an easy path. It was almost a decade after the Good Friday 
Agreement before a functioning Northern Ireland Executive was established. In 2007 the DUP leader 
Ian Paisley was nominated as First Minister and Sinn Fins leader, Martin McGuinness, became Deputy 
First Minister. For almost ten years Northern Ireland experienced political stability as devolution 
operated relatively successfully (Torrance 2018), with the 2016 Peace Monitoring Report declaring: the 
devolved ship of state is more stable than it has been for some time (Wilson 2016: 11). In January 
2017, however, things drastically changed.  
Following a scandal regarding flaws in the Renewable Heat Incentive, which was initially overseen by 
the now First Minister Arlene Foster, devolution collapsed. Foster refused to temporarily stand aside 
during an investigation into the renewable energy scheme, prompting McGuinness to resign as Deputy 
First Minister in protest which, in turn, sent the Northern Ireland Executive into chaos (Archick 2018). On 
the 2nd March 2017 an election was held, which reconfirmed the DUP and Sinn Fin as the two largest 
parties, but for the first time in Northern Irish history there was no longer a Unionist majority. After the 
election, an initial round of talks regarding the formation of an Executive were initiated. No agreement 
was reached and, on the 27th March, the statutory time limit for appointing Ministers passed. The 
deadline for the second round of talks passed on the 18th April and on the 27th the statutory time limit 
for creating an Executive was extended to 108 days (Torrance 2018). A third, fourth, and fifth round of 
talks ceased without agreement, as each party placed the onus for progress with the other party (Gray 
et al. 2018). Sinn Fins demand for a standalone Irish Language Act, which the DUP continually oppose, 
alongside legacy issues and disagreements regarding same-sex marriage (Archick 2018), produced the 
repeated conclusion of stalemate.  
Back in 2006 the UK and Irish Government reached a power-sharing package in the St. Andrews 
Agreement. This agreement included a commitment to the Irish language.  
The Government will introduce an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and 
Ireland and work with the incoming Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish 
language (St. Andrews Agreement, Annex B).  
When it came to the British Government granting legislative effect to St. Andrews Agreement, any 
reference to an Irish Language Act was omitted. Rather, the agreement empowered the Northern Irish 
Executive to adopt strategies for both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots  the support for and 
importance of which vary in accordance with the political outlook of the day (Carruthers and Mainnn 
2018: 168). The 2016 Assembly election resulted in the reassignment of the portfolio of actions under 
the language strategies from a Sinn Fin minister to a DUP minister, resulting in a change of priorities 
and cutting of grants to Irish learners from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. Alongside 
worries of cross-border funding in a post-Brexit political landscape, these cuts contributed to the 
deterioration of relations between the Sinn Fin and the DUP and, so, the collapse of the Assembly in 
2017. Sinn Fin continues to be a staunch advocate of legislated protection for the Irish language but 
the DUP deny such language rights on the grounds of cost, community relations, and perceived 
uselessness, and deny any consent to the proposal of an Irish Language Act at St. Andrews in 2006 
(McMonagle 2010; McMonagle and McDermott 2014). The collapse of the Executive and the ongoing 
failure to restore a functioning Assembly resides in opposing cultural contestations, firmly grounded in 
stark us-them narratives and mobilised in aggressive and disrespectful language. Post-conflict politics 
continues to reproduce a fear of the other and uncompromising territorial division. As Robbie McVeigh 
and Bill Rolston (2007: 10) have argued it [the Peace Process] engendered not so much a society free 
from sectarianism as one in which sectarianism is institutionalized in new forms. 
The hardening of Northern Irelands sectarian division has played out against the United Kingdoms 
decision to leave the European Union. England campaigned and cast its votes with little consideration of, 
or even obliviousness to, the danger leaving the European Union poses for those living on the island of 
Ireland. Yet, England has made its decision, and in a repeat of colonial history, Northern Ireland is just 
dragged along with it (Feenan in Harris 2019: n.p.), despite 56% of the Northern Irish vote aligning to 
remain (BBC News 2016). Brexit calls into question the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and has 
resulted in a huge amount of contention regarding the border on the island of Ireland (see figure 3). The 
Good Friday Agreement acknowledged Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom but placed the 
future of states constitutional status in the hands of the people, leaving open the potential for a united 
Ireland if the majority of Northern Ireland demonstrate this desire (Campbell, N Aolin and Harvey 
2003). With Brexit now on the horizon, there is an ongoing debate as to whether the potential of holding 
a border poll has been pushed further up the political agenda (Sturgeon and Lucas 2018; Archick 2018; 
Gray et al. 2018). Playing into the revival of this questions is the implications of the Brexit decision for 
the Northern Irish border (Gray et al. 2018). 
Since the Good Friday Agreement, the circuitous three-hundred-mile land border between Northern 
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has effectively disappeared in terms of the free movement of goods, 
people, and services (Sturgeon and Lucas 2018). Freedom of movement across the border has been 
widely acknowledged as an essential component to the development of Northern Irish peace (Archick 
2018). The border on the island of Ireland may be frictionless but the political, economic, and social 
reality of the border cannot be ignored: two sovereign states exist on either side of it. Two different 
currencies are used. Social, political, and economic policy is different (Gray et al. 2018: 54). While 
leaders in the United Kingdom, in the Republic of Ireland, and across the European Union have 
repeatedly stated the desire to avoid a return to a hard border, it has become increasingly questionable 
how this will be possible in the face of the United Kingdom pursuing a hard Brexit (Archick 2018) or, 
indeed, a no-deal Brexit.  
The border was an intense site of violence during the Troubles. Hundreds of checkpoints were created 
along this divisive border, which provided a focal point of violence between British soldiers and the IRA 
(Donnan and Simpson 2007; Archick 2018); it is this violence Brexit may resurrect. The Exiting the EU 
Committee (2017: 40, para 112) have stated:  
Many in Ireland are deeply concerned that the introduction of new and visible border check points 
would provide an opportunity and focal point for those who wish to disrupt the peace and feed a 
sense in some communities that the Good Friday Agreement was being undermined. 
Reinstating a hard border poses a considerable security risk, with George Hamilton, Chief Constable for 
PSNI, warning of the potential for the return of violence at the border from dissident Republicans 
(McDonald 2018). Researching public attitudes on Brexit, John Garry et al. (2018: 6) confirmed the 
breadth of Hamiltons fears stating there is a strong public expectation protests against either North-
South or East-West border checks would quickly deteriorate into violence. As Bertie Ahern, the former 
Taoiseach and a key figure behind the Good Friday Agreement, commented:  
There is not going to be a physical border across Ireland because if you tried to put it there you 
wouldnt have to wait for terrorism to take it down, people would just physically pull it down  the 
ordinary people (BBC News 2018: n.p.). 
With the challenges posed by Brexit, and at a time when Northern Ireland has been without a functioning 
executive for more than two years, it seems segregation may not only prevail in both space and time 
but there may even be a high potential for violence to erupt once again.

2.2 A City Born in Violence: A (brief )  history of the is land of  Ireland 
Violence and fear settled over that beautiful land like a heavy, unyielding fog.  
(George Mitchell 2001, June 13, Special Lecture of the Sadat Chair in Telhami 2010: 43) 
Northern Ireland has historically been recognised as a place characterised by violence, conflict, and 
antagonism (McKittrick and McVea 2012). Whilst the modern Troubles are generally regarded to have 
begun in the late 1960s (Jackson 1999; Hennessey 1997), their origins date back to Britains colonial 
conquest of Ireland in the early seventeenth century (Dixon 2008; Ruane and Todd 2001). Land in the 
Northern province of Ulster was dispossessed and  in what became known at the Plantation of Ulster 
 the province was seeded with British (mainly Scottish) colonists11 (Gidron, Katz and Hasenfeld 2002: 
47). With Henry III having broken from Rome in the 1530s (Brooks 2009), the settlers who came to find 
a home in Irelands northern province were overwhelming Protestant. The birth of the Ulster Plantations 
established a foreign community, who embodied a largely alien culture and way of life, on expropriate 
lands which, in turn, relegated the native Catholic inhabitants to the periphery  both geographically 
and politically  of what had originally been their native holdings (Gidron, Katz and Hasenfeld 2002).  
The removal and depreciation of the native Catholic population was largely justified through an us-them 
narrative, which characterised the natives as culturally inferior pagans in need of civilising. Although the 
larger native population continually posed the potential for trouble, the dominance of the settlers 
flourished (Clayton 1998) and, by the end of the 17th century, Protestant land ownership across Ireland 
had reached eighty percent (Dixon 2008). Protestant dominance was further cemented by the 
introduction of a series of repressive penal laws implemented from 1690 to the 1720s that degraded, 
harmed, and discriminated against the native populations (McEvoy 2008: 22-23). The Act of Union was 
passed in 1801 and Irish Parliament was integrated into what became the Parliament of Great Britain 
and Ireland (Dixon 2008). The Union, as described by John McGarry and Brendan OLeary (1995: 212), 
became the bulwark of the colonial settlers and their descendants: the Anglo-Irish nobility throughout 
Ireland and the Protestants of Ulster. 
The birth of the Ulster Plantation established the broad lines of a conflict that would plague the island 
of Ireland for almost four centuries (Darby 1995). The outcome of the British states policy of control and 
conquest was a unique and persistent system of relations; the configuration of two communities inhabiting 
the island of Ireland who possessed an unbalanced relationship to the British state. Joseph Ruane and 
11 Whilst it cannot be denied Ireland fell prey to the victim of British colonial expansion (see Clayton 1998; Gidron, 
Katz and Hasenfeld 2002; Graham and Proudfoot 1993; Howe 2000; Kearns 2013; Lloyd 2000, 2001; Miller 
1998; Proudfoot 2000; Ruane 1992; Ruane and Todd 2001), as Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin 
(2002: 32) argue the subsequent complicity of Ireland in Britains imperial enterprise makes it difficult for colonized 
peoples outside Britain to accept their identity as post-colonial, which complicates the often easily performed 
allocation post-colonialism often makes in terms of coloniser and colonised. Thus, Ireland cannot be considered as 
a homogeneous entity of oppressor or victim, but rather should be approached through a post-colonial lens that 
acknowledges internal differences and specificities (Lehner 2005).  
Jennifer Todd (2001) illustrate the three components of the system of relations. The first, a set of 
overlapping binary distinctions: Catholic or Protestant, Gaelic-Irish or English/Ulster Scots (ethnic origin), 
native or settler, barbarous or civil, backwards or progressive, Irish or British (nationality). The second 
component was a framework of dominance, dependence, and inequality. The continuation of British 
control rested with the continued loyalty of the Protestant settler minority, which was guaranteed through 
the British state visibly displaying their enduring dominance over native Irish Catholics. The third 
component resided in the increasing tendency towards polarisation between the Protestant settlers and 
Catholic natives, particularly in terms of identity, interests, and politics. Thus, there was a system of 
relations that guaranteed the continued power of the British state in Ireland and, additionality, the 
establishment of the native Irish Catholics as culturally and politically distinct from the settler British 
Protestants. Benjamin Gidron, Stanley Katz and Yeheskel Hasenfeld (2002: 47) describe the polarisation 
of division that ensued from this colonial system of relations: 
Two rival factions, often living in close proximity, nurtured mutually incompatible ambitions and 
harboured deep suspicions about one another, with the Protestant camp feeling that it was under 
constant threat of expulsion, and the Catholic faction believing that its country had been usurped. 
The two communities viewed themselves as two separate, largely oppositional entities divided by 
language, religion and status (McEvoy 2008: 22). Whilst cultural and ethno-national markers 
characterise the differentiation between the two communities, it is within the violent system of colonial 
relations of power and influence that the contemporary war would be grounded (Clayton 1998; Miller 
1998; Ruane 1992; Ruane and Todd 2001). However, it was religion  Catholic or Protestant  that 
came to name this differentiation of power. 
During the 1800s, resistance to the imposed union between Great Britain and Ireland increased. By the 
end of the century there was a growing pressure for Home Rule  for the decolonisation of Ireland. 
However, among Unionists and the settler population, who continued to be overwhelmingly concentrated 
in the northern province, there was considerable resistance to this growing demand (McEvoy 2008). 
Ulster Unionists regarded Home Rule as a threat to the union with Britain and to British Protestant 
domination of Irish affairs (McKittrick and McVea 2012) and, thus, began to advance a campaign of 
political resistance alongside a cultural movement seeking to develop a distinct Ulster identity (McEvoy 
2008; Miller 1998). Having battled three Home Bills, Thomas Hennessey (1995: 1-2) succinctly illustrates 
how, by 1912, it was acutely clear the Irish question was in fact two questions: nationalists Irelands 
relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom, and Protestant Ulster's relationship with Catholic Ireland. 
It was a question regarding the relations of colonialism, of the relationship between the natives and the 
colonial state, and between the settlers and the colonised territory.  
The third Home Rule Bill was passed into law in 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War drastically 
altered the political landscape (Dixon 2008). Irish Nationalism had originated as a political movement 
seeking to secure self-government under the United Kingdom. Yet, by the end of the Great War and 
following the 1918 general election in which Sinn Fin became the dominant party, demands abruptly 
altered: Nationalists were no longer calling for self-government but, rather, for an independent Irish 
Republic (Hennessey 1997). This shift in nationalist sentiment was largely a response to the 1916 Easter 
Rising, which witnessed a handful of Republicans stage an armed rebellion in Dublin against British rule. 
Whilst the rebellion was initially unpopular (McKittrick and McVea 2012), when the men leading the 
uprising were executed a wave of sympathy emanated from the Catholic community, who were not 
simply members of a different Christian set but a colonised people, a conquered people, people who 
had been inferior from the twelfth century onwards (Clayton 1998: 47). Consequently, public opinion 
shifted away from the Irish Parliamentary Party and Home Rule and towards the republicans and their 
demand for independence (Dixon 2008: 4). From 1918, with the acknowledgement they had little 
sympathy or affection in Britain, the Ulster Protestants adopted a fall-back position by which they 
intended to secure exclusion for the northern counties of Ireland from any Home Rule arrangements 
(Gidon, Katz and Hasenfeld 2002). Sinn Fin won the last all-Ireland election in 1918 and the IRA 
launched what became known as the War of Independence (1919-1921), an armed struggle to drive 
the British state out of Ireland. The War of Independence culminated in the partitioning of Ireland in 
1921, with a devolved jurisdiction at Stormont in Belfast for the six counties of Ulster with a Protestant 
majority,12 and a separate parliament in Dublin for the twenty-six counties of the Irish Free State 
(McKittrick and McVea 2012). Northern Ireland was born from an act of partition that largely failed to 
consider the historical differences and religious divides of the new state; differences and divides that 
quickly hardened as contention and agonism surrounding partition increased (Gidon, Katz and Hasenfeld 
2002).  
The decades immediately following partition were relatively peaceful. Yet, Northern Ireland was 
undoubtedly born in violence and, before long, violence returned (McKittrick and McVea 2012: 4). 
Although the Ulster Unionists may have appeared victorious, their comfortable majority at Stormont 
failed to bring the political and national security they desired. There was increasing suspicion of the 
Catholic minority who has been denied their Irish identity and it had become acutely evident London was 
not as interested in preserving the Union as the Northern Irish Unionists, with the consequence there was 
a continual underlying fear British policy would shift in support of a united Ireland (McKittrick and McVea 
2012). Mirroring the power relations of the Scottish settlers, these relatively peaceful times were 
characterised by discrimination against the Catholic minority at the hands of a Unionist regime keen to 
assert their dominance and control against the IRA threat from the south (Darby 1995; Dixon 2008). It 
was against this backdrop  a Protestant Unionist population fearful about the fragility of their control 
of Northern Ireland and a politically disenfranchised Catholic community who faced increasing 
discrimination from the Stormont government  that the modern-day Troubles broke out.

counties - Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal  being in the Republic of Ireland. 
In 1963, Terence ONeill was appointed prime minister of Great Britain and he had a clear agenda for 
addressing Northern Irelands colonial legacy. The reforms introduced by ONeill were opposed by 
Unionist who viewed them as giving too much away, whilst Nationalists tended to view them not going 
far enough (McEvoy 2008). ONeills reforms did, however, pave the way for Nationalists to break new 
political ground in the 1960s and it was with this advancement that the civil rights movement, modelled 
upon the non-violent civil rights campaigns in America (Darby 1995; de Fazio 2018), became an 
important and novel political instrument (see figure 4). The Northern Irish civil rights movement was 
primarily fuelled by the newly emerging Catholic middle class (McEvoy 2008), but as a broad political 
movement it successfully embraced anti-Unionism in its breath (McKittrick and McVea 2012). The newly 
formed Norther Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) organised a number a large civil rights marches 
across Northern Ireland. The second of these marches, due to take place on the 5th October 1968 in 
Derry, was banned. Yet, the decision was made to march away. Marchers were quickly attacked by the 
RUC, which led to the outbreak of violence between Nationalists and state forces in the infamous Bogside 
area. A series of other marches also ended in violence, and the civil rights movement which had originally 
hoped to secure its goals via non-violent tactics was overtaken be street violence and sectarian clashes 
(McEvoy 2008: 34). In 1969 the British Army were deployed to Northern Ireland. Soon after the IRA re-
emerged, and in 1971 murdered a British soldier in a movement that openly declared war against the 
United Kingdom (de Fazio 2018).   
 Figure. 4. Posters advertising the civil rights marches across Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, 
which are displayed in the Museum of Free Derry (authors own, 8th September 2017). 
What had originated in the 1960s as a concern for civil rights, had quickly been turned into a 
constitutional question which was being debated on both sides by violent paramilitary activity (McEvoy 
2008). The contemporary war was largely a question of who embodies the natural and innate claim to 
the territory of Northern Ireland, in which:  
settler attitudes towards their territory range from a fanatical and if necessary murderous resolve 
to retain it [met with] an equally fierce resolve to work towards ending settler power by whatever 
means, including terrorism (Clayton 1998: 51).  
The early 1970s were some of the most violent years and by 1972, following the decision to introduce 
internment (McEvoy 2008) and the Bloody Sunday massacre that drew international attention (Gidon, 
Katz and Hasenfeld 2002), Westminster assumed direct control over Northern Ireland (Dixon 2008). The 
next thirty years for Northern Ireland were defined by a bloody conflict, as the IRA fought an 
increasingly sophisticated guerrilla war against the British Army, the RUC, and Loyalist paramilitary 
groups (White 2003: 89).13 The Troubles  the remnants of which continues to define relations and politics 
within Northern Ireland today  are, thus, the contemporary manifestation of a centuries-old [colonial] 
antagonism between Ireland and England (White 2003: 89). Between 1969 and 1998 over 11,000 
contentious events were recorded, including armed attacks, terrorist bombings and shootings, and more 
everyday occurrences such as protests, arrests, harassment, and home invasions (Loyle, Sullivan and 
Davenport 2014). The Troubles lasted almost three decades and resulted in the death of more than 
3,700 people (McKittrick and McVea 2012), with approximately 48,000 people injured (Hayes and 
McAllister 2004). Aside from the Basque country in Spain where violence was not characterised by the 
same intensity, the Troubles represent the most prolonged period of politically-motivated violence 
anywhere is post-war western Europe (Wilson 2016: 166). On the 10th April 1998, the Troubles were 
brought to an end with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, also commonly known as the Belfast 
agreement, which declared Northern Ireland was finally at peace. 
2.3 A City Attempting Peace: The ongoing Northern Ir ish Peace Process  
Attempts to bring peace to Northern Ireland were initiated as early as the 1970s. Yet, it was not until 
1994, when the IRA declared a ceasefire that peace first became a real possibility. Between 1991 and

Coogan 1995, Dixon 2008, Jackson 1999, Hennessey 1997, McKittrick and McVea 2012. While some accounts 
detail the conflict from both sides others concentrate on the experience of one side: McKays (2000) accounts 
focuses on Northern Irelands Protestants, whilst OConnor (1993) details the experience of Catholics, and there are 
many accounts who take their focus from security forces (see Dewar 1997; Ryder 1997) and paramilitaries (see 
Toolis 2000; Taylor 1997, 1999). There are also accounts of specific events, such as Bloody Sunday (see McCann 
and Shiels 1992) or the hunger strikes (Beresford 1987), and with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there 
was a flurry of writings concentrating on Northern Irelands Peace Process (see Darby and Mac Ginty 2000; Dixon 
2008; Mallie and McKittrick 1996; Morrissey and Smyth 2001). In addition, there are a number of fictional writings 
detailing the experience of living through the Troubles and with the legacy of Northern Irelands violent history, 
arguably most worthy of mention are Trinity (1976) by Leon Uris, Journeyman Tailor (1992) by Gerry Seymour, 
Cal (1983) by Bernard MacLaverty, Lies of Silence (1990) by Brian Moore and, winner of the 2018 Man Booker 
Prize for Fiction, Milkman (2018) by Anna Burns.  
opposing parties. Two Secretary of States for Northern Ireland, first Peter Brooke and then Sir Patrick 
Mayhew, sought to bring the key parties together and, whilst these negotiations ended in deadlock, a 
vehicle was provided whereby parties could exchange ideas and engage in dialogue (McEvoy 2008).  
Parallel to the Brooke-Mayhew talks, the British government were both publicly and privately enquiring 
about the potential for negotiations, and a possible ceasefire, with the IRA. With the collapse of the 
Brooke-Mayhew talks, the British government sought to increase its back-channel talks with Republicans, 
while the Republicans simultaneously sought to create an open channel of communication with Dublin 
(Dixon 2008). These channels were fuelled by the 1993 Hume-Adams talks. John Hume, leader of Social 
Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) who were the major Nationalist party of the time, and Gerry 
Adams, leader of provisional Sinn Fin, had reinstated discussions and in 1993 they issued a joint 
statement declaring without an Irish dimension there could be no solution to a Northern Irish political 
settlement (Hennessey 1997). 
We accept that the Irish people as a whole have a right to national self-determination. This is a 
view shared by a majority of the people of this island though not by all its people. The exercise of 
self-determination is a matter for agreement between the people of Ireland. It is the search for that 
agreement and the means of achieving it on which we will be concentrating (McEvoy 2008: 84). 
Drawing from this statement, the British and Irish government produced the Downing Street Declaration 
published on the 15th December 1993. The Declaration attempted to attract Sinn Fin into a peace 
process without alienating unionism (Dixon 2008: 235), by tying together self-determination, as the 
Hume-Addams statement called for, with the need for consent in Northern Ireland for Irish unity. This 
carefully managed ambiguity successfully achieved Unionist support, whilst placing pressure on 
Republicans. Although the Downing Street Declaration was accompanied by several instances of brutal 
violence (see McKittrick and McVea 2012), with pressure on the IRA to declare an end to hostilities and 
to explore the possibilities for peace through dialogue, on the 31st August 1994 the IRA issued a 
statement announcing ceasefire (Hennessey 1997: 288). As David McKittric and David McVea (2012: 
233) express, whilst the future remained hazy, with the proclamation of a ceasefire one thing was clear: 
Northern Ireland has entered a new phase. 
With a ceasefire declared, negotiations were expected to begin immediately. However, the following 
years were dominate by protracted argument around decommissioning and demilitarization, and 
recurring Unionist concerns they were experiencing a movement towards Irish unity (see Dixon 2008; 
McKittric and McVea 2012). On the 1st May 1997, a new Labour government was elected in 
Westminster with a 177-seat majority (Dixon 2008), which gave the new Prime Minister Tony Blair 
considerable authority both within and beyond parliament (McKittric and McVea 2012). After his 
election, Blairs first visit outside of London was to Belfast where he voiced his commitment to the principle 
of consent and his desire for peace talks to include Sinn Fin, who in September that year took their seat 
at the negotiation table.14 The talks were largely successful, and on the 10th April 1998 the historic Good 
Friday Agreement was signed. 
Whilst the Good Friday Agreement was a landmark ruling, its roots lay in a process beginning twenty 
years earlier. The Agreement called for the devolution of power from London to Belfast and a power-
sharing Executive with a safeguard of cross-community support for key decisions (Archick 2018). The 
Agreement recognised the principle of consent15 and formalised both east-west and north-south relations. 
Essential to the agreement was the recognition to self-determination through the principle of dual 
citizenship (Byrne 1999): 
...the birth right of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as 
Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both 
British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any 
future change in the status of Northern Ireland (The Belfast Agreement, Article 1, paragraph 6). 
The principle of consent crafted space for Unionists and Nationalists politicians to support the Agreement 
without abandoning their political goals, whilst the guarantee of dual citizenship allowed communities to 
support the Agreement without having to relinquishing their ethnic identity (Doyle 1999). Despite divisions 
in the UUP regarding the endorsement of the Agreement, on the 22nd May 1998 a referendum was held 
in which the north and the south of Ireland both voted in support of the Good Friday Agreement (McKittric 
and McVea 2012).  
The Good Friday Agreement undoubtedly achieved a great deal. To align peace to the signing of an 
accord is, however, to reduce peace to a negative: a singular achievement or final state marking the 
end to active violence (Wehrenfennig 2008). A negative understanding consigns peace to a point of 
reference representing the absence of violence, the absence of war (Galtung 1964: 2). The Agreement 
did mark a point of transformation in the history of Northern Ireland, but it was not the end of violence. 
Peace is a complex, contingent, and fragile process active in relation to violence and the less-than-violent 
(Loyd 2012; Bregazzi and Jackson 2018; Darling 2014), and the Northern Irish Peace Process is no 
exception. 
 In order to get all sides to declare support for the document there was a need for the British and Irish 
government, who together largely orchestrated the agreement, to tactically build in constructive 
ambiguity (see Bell and Cavanaugh 1998; Dingley 2005; Dixon 2002; Mitchell 2009; Spencer 2010). 
Ambiguity helped form an agreement between the two conflicting positions as it left the future 
constructively open, with the consequence each side could strategically interpret the end result as a 
14 Whilst the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and smaller Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) and Progressive Unionist Party 
(PUP) participated in the negotiation, the inclusion of Sinn Fin resulted in the DUP  now the largest political party 
in Northern Ireland  and UK Unionist Party (UKUP) withdrawing (McEvoy 2008).  
15 The principle of consent was first voice in the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement (see Tongue 2000), illustrating the 
long roots of the Good Friday Agreement and the difficult and protracted process towards a peace agreement.   
victory without compromising their politics (Dixon 2008; Graham and Nash 2006; Marijan 2015). 
Ambiguity, however, also cemented the Catholic-Protestant dualism by creating space for both sides to 
claim victory at the hands of the other.  
With both sides declaring victory and policy making lying in agencies spanning both north-south and 
east-west, the Good Friday Agreement affirmed the legitimacy of different and opposing forms of 
cultural and national belonging (Ruane and Todd 2001: 936). The principle of parity of esteem was 
quickly politicised as a partisan ideological battering ram between two increasingly segregated and 
polarized communities (Hennessey and Wilson 1997: n.p., see also Ruohomaki 2010; Todd 2010). 
Between the two communities a competitive dyadic relationship developed on cultural, social, and 
economic issues, with relations continuing to be interpreted in a conflict mentality of zero-sum gains and 
losses (Mac Ginty and du Toit 2007: 20). The Good Friday Agreement achieved a historic compromise 
between the two communities, the continual breakdown of Stormont and sustained geographical and 
cultural divisions in the post-conflict period are, however, indicative of the instability of a foundation of 
compromise. Opposed to initiating a transformative process offering a new shared future for Northern 
Ireland (Ruane and Todd 2001), two decades after the signing of the Agreement Northern Ireland 
remains a country haunted by the stasis of conflict.   
The account of the Northern Irish Peace Process that has been given so far, has been focused exclusively 
at the political level and upon peace making. Northern Ireland has been widely researched. 
Overwhelmingly, such research has concentrated upon the political elite and the achievement of 
consensus among political, national, and religious positions regarded as irreconcilable (Delanty 1996; 
Wehrenfennig 2008). This work has largely been guided by a liberal understanding of peace, or the 
proclamation that well-functioning democracies do not collapse into war and violence (Doyle 2005; Mac 
Ginty 2008). Although liberal peace does not conform to a singular model (Richmond 2006), following 
Roger Mac Ginty (2009: 695), it can broadly be defined by five key characteristics: security and 
stability, reinforcing statehood, democratic governance, sustainability of a peace settlement and the 
promotion of free markets. Aligned to a rationalist perspective arguing reasoned outcomes will construct 
a peace that is just and fair, liberal peace has provided a relevant and applicable framework for 
analysing the outplay of the Good Friday Agreement and resulting Peace Process (see Bell and 
Cavanaugh 1998; Dingley 2005; Dixon 2002; Mitchell 2009), the power-sharing framework of 
government (see Horowitz 2002; Tilley, Evans and Mitchell 2008), and the promotion of deliberative 
democracy and communicative interaction (see Drysek 2005; Porter 2000)  the primary achievements 
allowing for Northern Ireland to claim it is at peace. A liberal peace framework aligns closely to the 
activity of peace-making. However, alongside the making of peace in Northern Ireland is a parallel 
process of peacebuilding.  
2.3.1 Bui lding Peace 
To impose a schism between peace-making and peacebuilding is to construct an artificial separation. 
Despite their deep entwinement, it is important to distinguish between peace-making and peacebuilding 
(Bush and Houston 2011; OBrien 2005). Peace-making traditionally refers to a two-phase process that 
is overwhelmingly political-diplomatic in nature. The first step of the process is an initial pre-agreement 
phase concluding with the signing of a formalised peace accord. This step tends to be tied to a relatively 
short timeframe in which the emphasis is on conflict management, with actions being taken that are 
designed to limit, mitigate, or contain violence as accommodation and comprise between the warring 
parties are carved out (Jarman 2016). This stage is then followed by a post-agreement second phase, 
where the signatories of the accord work out the fine details of what they had agreed to in general 
terms (Bush and Houston 2011: 8). Essential to the second phase are formal and informal peacebuilding 
initiatives concentrated at the civil society level, where there is at least some attempt to address the 
conditions within which conflict erupted (Power 2011). 
The development of the Northern Irish Peace Process has been accompanied by the growing realisation 
conflict is considerably more complex than negotiating an end to active violence (Wehrenfennig 2008). 
This re-conceptualisation has introduced civil society as a key site for analysing peacebuilding in Northern 
Ireland (see Acheson and Milosfsky 2008; Byrne 2001; Knox 2011a, 2011b; McCall and ODowd 
2008; Racioppi and OSullivan See 2007). Peacebuilding aims to address societal impacts and legacies 
caused by protracted violent conflict  such as fear, distrust, segregation, polarised communities, 
discrimination, sense of justice and so forth (Bush and Houston 2011: 8). With a focus on societal needs, 
inter-group rights, and interpersonal relationship, peacebuilding encompasses a long-term process that 
has a fundamental role to play in the making of peace (Bush and Houston 2011). Conflict management 
and conflict resolution are pragmatic activities seeking to establish post-conflict stability through top-
down elite led actions. In contrast, conflict transformation and reconciliation aim to challenge the status 
quo and, so, are more radical forms of action that demand a broad commitment across society (Jarman 
2016). There is no singular, agreed definition of conflict transformation but, in a 2018 report of peace 
funding in Northern Ireland, Duncan Morrow, Lisa Faulkner-Byrne and Sean Pettis (2018: 15) determine 
reconciliation based conflict transformation work to encompass: finding a way to live that permits a 
vision of the future; the (re)building of relationships; coming to terms with past acts and enemies; society-
wide, long-term process of deep change; [and a] process of acknowledging, remembering, and learning 
from the past. Most prominently the work of peacebuilding and reconciliation organisations includes 
efforts to reduce violence, promote social and economic investment in both communities as a whole and 
in individuals, whilst also seeking to challenge and change attitudes, perceptions, and policy in relation 
to several contentious issues (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne, and Pettis 2018: 24).  
In Northern Ireland organisations engaged in peacebuilding have been in existence for almost as long 
as there has been conflict (Jarman 2016). Overwhelmingly these organisations focus on developing 
good relations between Northern Irelands two communities, an activity of peacebuilding widely 
supported by the Peace Process. Good relations  originally referred to as community relations  is 
firmly ensconced within the lexicon of reconciliation to the extent that the two are virtually synonymous 
in many quarters in Northern Ireland (McEvoy, McEvoy and McConnachie 2006: 84). As communal 
division was both a cause and resulting effect of violence, the focus on good relations originated with 
the outbreak of the Troubles when, in 1969, the British government established a Community Relations 
Commission to support the development of positive relations between Northern Irelands two communities. 
Lesly McEvoy, Kieran McEvoy and Kirsten McConnachie (2006) illustrate it is important to locate the 
origins of, at least the formal community relations paradigm, with a political strategy that sought to enlist 
Catholic allegiances to a reformed and supposedly legitimate state. Thus, whilst peacebuilding may be 
concentrated at the civil society it remains an activity largely controlled by the state.  
The community relations paradigm provided a contingency position in the void of a directed conflict 
management strategy, illustrating the political elite were seeking to engage with and improve relations 
on the ground. However, in 1974 the Community Relations Commission dissolved initiating a period 
marked by an absence of government policy with regards to peacebuilding. At this time, the voluntary-
community sector in Northern Ireland was thriving and independently from the political elite. Community 
groups provided a space for the delivery of services and support that had traditionally been provided 
by the state but which broke down in the face of violence, or where the use of state services was no 
longer regarded as acceptable due to ideological and politics differences (Birrell and Williamson 2001). 
In the late 1980s these community groups became the focus of more official peacebuilding work and the 
rearticulated commitment by the political elite to build better community relations.  
As societal divisions became harsher and sectarian attacks increased, the British government resurrected 
their commitment to community relations. In 1987 a Central Community Relations Unit (CCRU) was 
created, who in 1990 established the Community Relations Council as an independent body tasked with 
promoting better community relations between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland and, 
equally, to promote recognition of cultural diversity (McEvoy, McEvoy and McConnachie 2006: 90). In 
1993 the British Government published a Strategy for the Support of the Voluntary Sector and of 
Community Development, which for the first time saw direct governmental endorsement for supporting 
and working in partnership with the third sector in Northern Ireland (see Department of Health and Social 
Science 1993: paras 6 and 9). Civil society was acknowledged, both within the political and academic 
arena, as a key site for Northern Irelands conflict transformation (see Byrne 2001; Knox 2011a, 2011b; 
McCall and ODowd 2008; Racioppi and OSullivan 2007) and, thus, a legitimate space for peace-
focused grant aid.  
Since 1987, it is estimated that four billion dollars of peace-focussed grant aid has been invested into 
Northern Ireland, with most of this investment being directed towards civil society and local government 
actors (Kelly and Braniff 2016). The bulk of this funding has originated from outside of Northern Ireland, 
with the largest single programmes being sponsored through the European Union, the inter-governmental 
International Fund for Ireland (IFI), and The Atlantic Philanthropies independent foundation (Morrow, 
Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018), who together have supported a range of different peacebuilding 
projects and activities (see table 1). Of acute significance was the establishment of the European Unions 
Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Border Counties 
in the Republic of Ireland (known as PEACE). The early 1990s were marked by an increased awareness 
of the integral roles played by civil society actors. In turn, there was a notable desire across the European 
Union for civil society to be embedded in governing processes and involved in decision making. With the 
1994 paramilitary ceasefire marking the beginnings of a cautious Peace Process, under the existing 
partnership principle the European Union took the opportunity to hold an integral role in the resolution 
and transformation of a high profile and long running conflict that was within the jurisdiction of a Member 
State (Bush and Houston 2011: 20, original emphasis). Since 1995, the European Unions PEACE program 
has, and continues, to support a wide range of peacebuilding projects and programmes. By tracing the 
evolution of the PEACE programme and the shifts across its four iterations, we can begin to build up an 
image of what peacebuilding in Northern Ireland looks like.

before 2016 (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018: 19). 
2.3.2 The PEACE Programmes: Building contact  
The PEACE programme has supported a range of peacebuilding projects. It is, however, important to 
trace two distinct phases of the programme: the pre-2007 phase covering PEACE I and PEACE II and the 
post-2007 phase encompassing PEACE III and PEACE IV. PEACE I was primarily concentrated on socio-
economic development, an arena of peacebuilding that all Northern Irish parties agreed upon and one 
broadly divorced from community relations. PEACE I ran from 1995 to 1999 and provided support to 
over 15,000 projects (Colgan 2012). PEACE II was initiated in 2000 and, whilst the broad management 
of the of the programme altered, the objectives of PEACE II predominantly mirrored PEACE I, with a 
continued emphasis on taking advantage of the economic and social inclusion opportunities arising with 
the end of violence (Skarlato et al. 2016; see figure 5). PEACE II funded over 7,000 projects and ran 
for six years (Colgan 2012). Whilst the first two iterations of PEACE placed little emphasis on community 
relations, by engaging a range of non-governmental organisations, voluntary associations and citizens 
both PEACE I and PEACE II acknowledged civil society as an integral arena of peacebuilding.  
Figure. 5. Distribution of PEACE II funds, indicating the type of peacebuilding of work 
funded under this programme (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018: 20). 
The turn of the century marked a shift in the vision of the Northern Irish Peace Process and, so, the nature 
of funded peacebuilding work. Following a consultation period (see CCRU 2003; Darby and Knox 
2004), in 2005 the document A Shared Future - Improving Relations in Northern Ireland: The policy and 
strategic framework for good relations in Northern Ireland was launched by the CCRU and the OFMDFM. 
The document sought, for the first time, to provide a framework for the vision of peace being pursued in 
Northern Ireland. A Shared Future reoriented peacebuilding once again towards community relations. 
The document determined Northern Irelands future to reside in the creation of a shared and pluralist 
society: the former, being defined as a society in which people are encouraged to make choices in their 
lives that are not bound by historical divisions and are free to do so; while the latter is characterised by 
a respect and tolerance for cultural diversity which, in turn, provides the space for people to freely assert 
their identity (CCRU 2003, n.p.). A Shared Future acknowledges peace cannot be achieved by 
government alone. Rather communities, guided by community leaders  whose definition is inclusive of 
politicians  must be empowered to address the key challenges facing Northern Ireland in the 21st 
Century: the continuing dominance of sectarianism, the fear of renewed violence, and the building of 
trust and confidence within and between communities. Whilst the language of the document is hazy, 
ambivalent, lacking in operational definition, composed of token talk, and devoid of an effective and 
active strategy (Marijan 2015), the document broadly grounds Northern Irelands shared future in the 
promotion of community relations and equality, which in the document are regarded as complementary.16 
With reconciliation and conflict transformation reduced almost exclusively to good relations (McEvoy, 
McEvoy and McConnachie 2006), the engineering of intergroup contact and sharing holds central 
importance in the continuing Peace Process (Lepp 2018).  
The tying together of cross-community contact and good relations has broadly been informed by Gordon 
Allports contact hypothesis (see Beaudette and Kirkpatrick 2017; Cairns and Darby 1998; Connolly 
2000; Hewstone et al. 2014; Hughes, Campbell and Jenkins 2011; McKeown and Taylor 2017; Paolini 
et al. 2004; Pettigrew et al. 2011). Empirically grounded in the racial segregation of 1950s America, 
Allport believed in the potential of social intervention for reducing prejudice and creating peaceful 
relationships (Dovido, Glick and Rudman 2005; Kenworthy et al. 2005). Allport (1954: 281) built upon 
Robin Williams's (1947) earlier work on intergroup tension, arguing that under optimal conditions 
intergroup contact holds the capacity to effectively decrease biases at a personal level. 
16 Community relations, through the inclusion of equality and in light of the post-modern terrain of multiple identities, 
were rebranded in A Shared Future as good relations. McEvoy, McEvoy and McConnachie (2006: 94) argue the 
movement towards good relations could also have been a strategy to increase the distance from the critiques of 
the Good Friday Agreement  in particular, the fact that its consociational [or power-sharing] nature has 
essentialised those who are perceived to be within the two main communities. Thus, in embracing the post-modern 
promotion of multiple identities, the political tent has been broadened as more complex notions of identity are 
recognised and the increasing number of ethnic groups present in Northern Ireland are acknowledged. There are 
a number of communities in Northern Ireland, yet, their invisibility  illustrated by the fact community relations was 
perceived to fail in including the third and fourth communities of Northern Ireland  simply works to assert the 
dominance of the Catholic and Protestant community, of the two communities.  
Prejudicemay be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the 
pursuit of common goals. The effect is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional 
supports (i.e., by law, custom, or local atmosphere), and provided it is of the sort that leads to the 
perception of common interests and common humanity between members of the two groups. 
Although not without critiques (see Dixon, Durrheim and Tredoux 2005), the contact hypothesis has been 
highly influential in war-torn and post-conflict societies. In the face of continuing segregation and ongoing 
cultural contestation, the influence and popularity of the contact hypothesis  amongst both Northern 
Irelands political elite and its academic community  has been particularly acute (see Byrne et al. 2009; 
Hayes, McAllister and Dowds 2007; Hewstone et al. 2006; Hughes 2003; Loader and Hughes 2017; 
Paolini et al. 2014; Porter 2000; Turner and Cameron 2016).17 Contact has been promoted as a means 
for reducing anxiety and perceived threat, cultivating empathy and trust, and increasing a sense of 
commonality and humanity across divides (Kenworthy et al. 2005): it is the basis for establishing good 
relations. Engineering cross-community contact, then, has become the foundation of peacebuilding work.  
The vision promoted within A Shared Future came to directly influence peacebuilding work or, at the very 
least, where funding for peacebuilding work was channelled, as exemplified by the shift in focus from 
PEACE II to PEACE III. PEACE III (2007-2013) was the first programme to run alongside a devolved 
government. With the two traditionally opposing parties working together in a shared government, the 
image projected towards the rest of the world suggested peace had been achieved. The British and Irish 
governments both endorsed this narrative, directly illustrating their strong support for the new Executive 
and devolved the responsibility of peacebuilding (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018). With a 
relatively stable and successfully functioning political structure, emphasis soon became placed upon the 
relationship between the two communities, with the remit of peacebuilding largely concentrated on 
dealing with the sectarian divisions that continued to plague society (Power 2011).  
In 2010, the power-sharing Executive published the Programme for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration 
(OFDFM 2010). Despite the Executive disbanding A Shared Future (Knox 2011a), the vision they brought 
forth aligns to the trajectory of the former. The post-2007 PEACE programmes, then, not only reflect the 
post-2007 shift from peace-making to peacebuilding, but also the continuation of the vision of peace 
first presented in A Shared Future. Good relations and equality take centre stage in the Programme for 
Cohesion, Sharing and Integration and, for the first time, they are explicitly grounded in space. The 
document acknowledges the continuing presence of fear in relation to moving through, what can be 
perceived as, intimidating space. Thus, there is a greater focus on the promotion of shared and safe 
17 Cross-community or intergroup contact has been widely studied and supported throughout Northern Irelands 
academic community. To date, this research has overwhelmingly been concentrated within the social psychology 
field (see Kenworth et al. 2016; Leonard, Yung, and Cairns 2015; McKeown and Psaltis 2017; Voci et al. 2015; 
White et al. 2019), with the consequence the research has been overwhelmingly discursive, quantitatively 
comparing attitudes before and after contact to objectively determine if contact improves intergroup relations. 
Furthermore, this work tends to focus on intergroup education and youth community groups, contact between ex-
prisoners and contact between perpetrators and victims, to the exclusion of the everyday body living the legacy 
of contact (notable exceptions include Lepp 2018; Mac Ginty 2014; Smyth and McKnight 2013). 
spaces of everyday life, and shared high-quality service provisions that are welcoming and accessible 
to all. Whilst the language largely mirrors A Shared Future (OKane 2013), the document places great 
emphasis on the younger generation.  
Unlike its first two iterations, PEACE III and PEACE IV ran alongside a determined political vision of 
Northern Irish peace. Unsurprisingly, then, the Programme for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration directly 
impacted upon the types of peacebuilding activities receiving funding. Whilst PEACE I and PEACE II were 
heavily focused on economic development and social inclusion, the priorities of PEACE III were 
recalibrated towards reconciliation and inter-community and cross-border activity (Skarlato et al. 2016). 
Running from 2007 to 2013 PEACE III had two broad strands: the first, reconciling communities, aimed 
to challenge sectarian and racist attitudes and to support conflict resolution and mediation in the local 
community; and the second, contributing to a shared society, was focused on regeneration, the creation 
of shared space, and working with key institutions to develop their capacity to deliver services in a 
manner corresponding and contributing to a shared Northern Irish society and on a cross-border basis 
(Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018). 
On the 23rd March 2013, the Northern Irish Executive published Together: Building a United Community 
(TBUC). TBUC set forth the vision of: 
...a united community, based on equality of opportunity, the desirability of good relations and 
reconciliation  one which is strengthened by its diversity, where cultural expression is celebrated 
and embraced and where everyone can live, learn, work and socialise together, free from 
prejudice, hate and intolerance (OFMDFM 2013: 3).  
TBUC determined peace to reside in a stable government, claiming the achievement of political stability 
opens the path for Northern Ireland to shape the kind of society that we all want to see, one which 
ensures that our past is never repeated, and which lays the foundation for peace and prosperity for 
future generations (OFMDFM 2013: 1). The official, government-controlled Peace Process 
overwhelmingly promotes peace as political achievement that will trickle down from the top, executive 
level to local communities and the everyday (Marijan 2015).  
The OFDFM (2013: 25) articulated four key priorities of peace in the TBUC strategy.  
1. Children and young people: to continue to improve attitudes amongst our young people and to 
build a community where they can play a full and active role in building good relations; 
2. A shared community: to create a community where division does not restrict the life opportunities 
of individuals and where all areas are open and accessible to everyone; 
3. A safe community: to create a community where everyone feels safe in moving around and 
where life choices are not inhibited by fears around safety; 
4. Cultural expression: to create a community which promotes mutual respect and understanding, is 
strengthened by its diversity, and where cultural expression is celebrated and embraced.  
Within each of the four key priorities a shared aim is set out, alongside a set of tangible and practical 
headline actions, and a series of commitments to make the vision a sustainable, long-term reality. In 
addition, a range of measures are set forth to aid implementation, to enhance policy advice, to improve 
funding delivery, to increase local council delivery, and to implement monitoring and evaluation. The 
Draft Programme for Government Framework 2016-2021, which emphasised the need to promote 
respect between Northern Irelands two main communities and strengthen diversity, reinforced the TBUC 
strategy (Knox and McCrory 2018), stating:  
Together: Building a United Community has established a strong foundation for this work [for making 
space for a greater sharing between traditionally divided communities]. By continuing to work with 
communities, we can continue to develop shared spaces in education, in housing, and in society in 
general (Northern Ireland Executive 2016: 33) 
TBUC continues today as the policy framework peacebuilding is responsive to, as is evident for the PEACE 
IV programme. 
There are two important shifts in the TBUC strategy to be noted. Firstly, the framework places a much 
greater emphasis on action: we recognise that it is now the time to move from policy development to 
implementation and action (OFMDFM 2013: 1). The Executives direct commitment to action is illustrated 
in the documents format, which diverges from the previous two programmes for peace. The four key 
priorities of the document are accompanied by a series of headline actions and commitments, whilst also 
drawing upon grassroots case studies as examples of good practice. Secondly, the document grounds 
the creation of good relations in activities extending beyond dialogue. The fostering of good relations 
has been promoted as key to the cultural expression priority. TBUC promotes cross-community contact 
as a means for addressing the cultural wars in Northern Ireland. Whilst cross-community contact is not 
novel, there was a shift in the location of such contact, with TBUC suggesting cultural itself could be used 
to address continuing cultural contestation; the focus of cross-community work has come to reside in 
engineering cross-cultural contact. Thus, the strategy placed emphasis on the capacity of sports (see 
Bairner 2001; Beutler 2008; Crdenas 2013, 2016; Hassan and Telford 2014; Mitchell, Somerville and 
Hargie 2016; Sugden and Sugden 1997; Tuohey, and Cognato 2011; United Nations 2005) and the 
arts (see Bergh and Sloboda 2010; Cohen 2005; Shank and Schirch 2008; Walsh 2013; Yalen and 
Cohen 2007) as integral locations for contact, sharing, and good relations.  
As TBUC followed the trajectory first set out in A Shared Future, PEACE IV closely resembles PEACE III. 
TBUC and PEACE IV are closely aligned (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018), with the European 
Commissions (2016: 5) stating how TBUC provides a strong Northern Ireland policy context for the 
development of the PEACE IV programme. Running from 2014 to 2020, PEACE IV has four core 
objectives: funding shared education initiatives, supporting marginalised children and young people, 
providing new shared spaces and services, and endorsing projects aiming to build positive relations 
between people from different communities and backgrounds (SEUPB 2016). 
The TBUC strategy makes an explicit attempt to acknowledge the grassroots experience and expertise 
in relation to peacebuilding and there has been a movement towards working from the bottom up. Yet, 
peacebuilding in Northern Ireland remains entangled with the same, ambiguous language of sharing, 
reconciliation, cohesion, conflict resolution, relationship-building, good relations, inter-community contact, 
and equality. With policy documents and the criteria and procedures of external funding support 
merging almost beyond distinction, the supposedly grassroots nature of the voluntary and community 
sector has been challenged, as peacebuilding organisations are forced to align to the vision of the 
international and national funding bodies they are responsive to (Cochrane and Dunn 2002; Skarlato et 
al. 2016). Through the political frameworks and the European Unions PEACE Programme, peacebuilding 
has been institutionalised as a political goal (Lepp 2018), with a singular, set format that restricts the 
transformative potential of peacebuilding work which is, in turn, compounded by increasing financial 
concerns. 
Just as devolution was finding its feet, in 2008 the international financial crisis broke, seriously impacting 
both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. In the wake of political stability and financial crisis, 
international donors have dramatically reduced their investments into the Northern Irish Peace Process 
(Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018). Whilst PEACE I saw 667 million invested (Bush and Houston 
2011) and PEACE II 995 (Buchanan 2008), the investment for PEACE III totalled 333 million (Colgan 
2012) and PEACE IV 270 million (SEUPB 2016). What is more, since 2007 the distribution of European 
Unions funding has altered and, today, public sector bodies have an enhanced distribution role. Domestic 
support has remained steady but incapable of offsetting the continual decrease of international funding. 
Thus, while more and more voluntary and community organisations are involved in peacebuilding work 
and to a greater depth, the funding environment for such work has become increasingly difficult to 
navigate (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018) and the sustainability of peacebuilding projects, 
alongside a query over their transformative potential, has been questioned (Skarlato et al. 2016). 
Interruption: The Noisy Silence of the 12th  
Silence. The bright flames from the night before still dance before eyes. Ears are still filled with an 
engulfing, dense smoke. 
Silence. The roads are empty. An eerie stillness, amplifying the rustle of leaves and the pound of my 
footsteps. 
Silence. The echo were never here, I have never been in Northern Ireland for the 12th18 ever... 
reverberate through the air. 
Silence. An unsettling and unnerving discomfort stirs in the internal depths. An immersion in anticipation 
and apprehension. 
Silence. The road abandoned. The students vanished. The bus stops empty. Even the seagulls have fled to 
Donegal. 
Slowly a feint sound begins to fill the air. The booming rumble of a bass drum. University Road continues 
to pass under moving feet. A higher, more melodic sound gently touches my ear. An unusually feeling. A 
strange sound.  
The route veers right. 
Orange fills the eye. Sequins covered orange hats glisten in the warm July summer. Orange sashes hang 
proudly on strong, broad shoulders. The sky is filled with a haze of orange glowing from the tall orange 
banners (see figure 6). 
Music fills the air. The high whistle of the flute. The beat and strength of the drums swelling, resounding 
again the eardrum. DUUUUM...DUMDUM...DUUUM. Feet march in time, arms rigidly and methodically 
move back and forth, conducting the song. Children twirling batons high in the air, enjoying the attention 
of the gazing crowd. Families march together; men honoured to be wearing the uniform of their band, 
women and children draped in their Sunday best. 
18 The 12th July is one of the bigger days in the calendar for the Protestant, Unionist, Loyalist community. The 
celebration dates back to the eighteenth century and celebrates the victory of King William of Orange over 
Catholic King James II at the Battle of Boyne; an event that initiated Protestant and British ascendency in Northern 
Ireland. To commemorate the victory, large parades are held by the Orange Order where Loyalist bands march 
across Northern Ireland. The parade in Belfast is the longest, beginning in the city centre at Royal Avenue and 
walks out to the field at Barnetts Demesne. Violence is often triggered by the 12th July parades (Hurley 2001; 
McDowell, Braniff and Murphy 2015; The Guardian 2018). Consequently, large sections of the Catholic community 
leave Northern Ireland and head to Donegal to avoid the 12th and the possibly resulting violence. 
Fun, laughter. Carefree. Drinks flow. Cool boxes stand open and sandwiches are passed around; hungrily 
consumed by children, grandparent, aunts, cousins, friends, and strangers alike. Groups dance. Arms move 
up and down to the beat, while smiles stretch across faces. Feet tap and bodies sway. A beer can in hand. 
Warm hugs and kisses move between old friends and family. A ripple of excitement travels through the 
crowds, their attention caught by a favourite tune. Singing breaks out: a communal choir who have the 
words etched within their being. A man yo-yos from one side to the other, his hips gently sway, his eyes 
closed, and his right hand clutched to his heart. His melodic, impassioned signing provides the 
accompanying words. Union Jacks wave from side to side. One big street party. 
I turn on one foot and walk back along University Road. 
Dead silence returns.

Setting the Scene: Tracing peaceful possibilities 
In my seminars, I asked students from all over the world to research the etymological root of the word for 
peace in their corresponding mother tongues, and I still remember one classs bewilderment when a student 
from Burkina Faso said that the word for peace in his mother tongue meant nothing else but fresh 
air.astonishment about fresh air was followed by enthusiasm about the beauty of the word: Can there 
be a better way to experience peace than breathing fresh air? Is breathing in itself not the most 
fundamental and indispensable act of all beings, for themselves and yet in necessary relation to each 
other, and thus the most alive measurement for peaces as such?...Do we not release something from our 
deepest inside, something very intimate and authentic, into the environment each time we breathe out? Do 
particles of our breath not re-enter the lungs and bodies of other beings so that we could say that all that 
is alive is more intimately connected through breathing than through any other activity? Is breathing not 
the elementary sign of life, in many languages synonymous with soul, and therefore is fresh air not the best 
possible description of a peaceful existence? 
(Dietrich 2012: 3) 
3.1 Introduction 
Breath is a force of creativity. Breath floods our body and expands out into the world. The inhalation 
and exhalation with which life, bodies, and worlds blossom. A liveliness composing and penetrating 
worlds with dynamism and vitality. Breath can be still but never static, a living rhythm and beat continuing 
in both rest and movement. It is excessive (Irigaray 2002a). A movement that can never be contained 
and confined. Breath denies boundaries and diffuses partitions. An embodied, invisible air swirling, 
spiralling and resting in the spaces in-between. Breath animates connections and relations (kof 2015); 
it moves in-between here and there, you and I, culture and nature to permit sharing (Irigaray 1994). The 
elemental fluidity and openness of breath gives birth to relations to oneself and to the other that are 
always a situated, emerging, and slippery grouping of relational movement in the present (Faulkner 
2001).  
Breath is reciprocity flowing in all directions. An unseen quietness touching flesh as the outside is brought 
in and the inside moves out. It is an activity and passivity which gifts a responsiveness, an attentiveness, 
an awareness and a letting-be  voices, stories, silences, and listening travel across it. Breath is the birth 
of openness, the creation and filling of time and space. It is the movement of becoming, a nextness 
continually giving and caring without measure. Breath is the fresh air of peace. Breath, however, has 
largely been forgotten as a modality of critical reflection and as a vector for attending to creativity; a 
forgetting within which the failure of peace can be located. 
Although breath has been forgotten, by its very nature breath cannot be contained. Breath will always 
escape, and it will always return. Even when forgotten or neglected there will always be a flutter of 
movement. Even when world, bodies, and relations are held in a void of stasis and an invisible violence 
continues to be active in the telling of inherited truths, there is always the potential for peace. We cannot 
give up on this potential, reduce it to the less-than or non-violent, nor consign it to a nave and utopian 
ideal. We must move with the glimmers of peace that are always-already present; we must move with 
the embodied respiration of fresh air.  
Before tracing breath, it is necessary to illustrate why this tracing is needed. I make this case by, first, 
tracing geographys engagement with the subject of peace. Geography has become increasingly 
committed to the question of peace, a commitment which has largely failed. Following Harry Bregazzi 
and Mark Jackson (2018), I argue this failure lies with placing violence in an originary position with the 
consequence peace is always-already restricted to the non-violent. Committing to peace-as-peace 
necessitates the creation of an alternative horizon; geographers need to breathe fresh air into peace. 
Peace, not violence, must be our focus, and breath provides a potential avenue for cultivating this focus. 
The next section traces breath through Luce Irigarays philosophical work, with the principal aim of 
describing how I mobilise breath and to illustrate how breath can animate an alternative horizon wherein 
peace is an extant potential. Finally, I situate encounters taking place in a sharing of breath as a possible 
space for creating a peaceful horizon.  
3.2 A Fai led Horizon: Tracing everyday peaces 
Peace is not an end point to be achieved. It is not a final state instituted for in law and by political, elite 
authority via peace agreements and accords. Peace is more-than the absence of violence. A commitment 
to peace-as-peace, which geographer Nick Megoran (2011) calls for, necessitates a movement beyond 
negative accounts positing war and peace within a binary horizon. The distinction between positive and 
negative peace is commonly attributed to Johan Galtung (1964, 1985).19 Galtung determines positive 
peace to reside in the integration of human society through the principles of harmony, cooperation, and 
integration. Galtungs positive peace closely aligns to the liberal peace model, which locates peace at 
an institutional level as the activity of political elites. This focus neglects what is going on beyond, or 
below, official documentation (Williams and McConnell 2011). The everyday Northern Irish body, then, 
becomes excluded behind  negative or positive  accounts of peace concerned with the distant 
achievement of peace as engineered by the Good Friday Agreement, and with the continued effort for 
peace in Northern Irelands power-sharing government. Positive conceptualisations of peace cannot 
merely be concerned within peace accords and the actions of political elite; it must also attend to 
contingent everyday makings of peace.  
19 In 1963, a year before Galtung mobilised the distinction between positive and negative peace, Martin Luther 
King (2018: 13) spoke of how the white moderate prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a 
positive peace which is the presence of justice. It is this distinction Galtungs work explores. 
Geography today mobilises peace as an ongoing, contingent, and fragile process (Darling 2014) of 
shared social relations and practices that are both exceptional and everyday (Bregazzi and Jackson 
2018; Williams, Megoran, and McConnell 2014). Whilst this is a relatively new way of conceiving 
peace within geography, Jane Addams advanced a positive, everyday conceptualisation of peace in 
the early twentieth century. In dialogue with a wave of early feminist articulations protesting war and 
the sustained female exclusion from public life and policy discussion (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018), 
Addams conceived of an everyday ontology of peace (Shields and Soeters 2017: 327) that was 
processual, practical, positive, and firmly grounded in everyday relations. War in the early twentieth 
century was believed to be a noble act necessary to engender and cherish patriotism, yet Addams 
(2007: 14) determined that below their [mans] shouting, they were living in the kingdom of human 
kindness. Engaged with practical work addressing the welfare of low income and immigrant populations 
in inner city Chicago (see Addams 2015), Addams voiced the immediate and intimate relationships of 
care and attention always-already active in the everyday kingdom of human kindness. These innate 
gestures animate what  via Addams  Patricia Shields and Joseph Soeters (2017: 324) name 
peaceweaving; the pulling together of the many noble fibres of the everyday body into [positive] 
action (Addams 2002a: 176). It is within this active, feminist conceptualisation that I situate my work. 
Geographers have recently become attentive to calls for a positive commitment to peace located at an 
everyday level. Within geography and, more broadly, peace is now widely regarded as a doing 
grounded in the everyday socio-spatial context, and animated in mutually enabling relations and 
embodiments within a sensual and affective micro-politics (Addams 2007; Bregazzi and Jackson 2018; 
Daley 2014; Darling 2014; Koopman 2011; Williams 2014; Williams and McConnell 2011; Williams, 
Megoran and McConnell 2014). Peace, here, is not mobilised through universalising, external 
abstractions approaching the everyday body as either a passive victim or a passive recipient (Mac 
Ginty 2014) but within a grounded contextual definition, wherein peace(s) are always shaped in and 
through the spaces and times through which they are made and, crucially, made again (Koopman 2011: 
194). Attention has been rerouted from political elites, and their democratic deals and accords, towards 
everyday spaces actively doing peace in a subtly normalcy. Everyday peace can be brief, fleeting, and 
transient or the sustained activity of an official event or organised programme (Marajan 2015). It can 
occur in spaces formally designated as peaceful or in banal spaces and everyday moments, where 
peace-weaving may be more unconscious than conscious (Williams and McConnell 2011). A commitment 
to the everyday does not construct a false binary between the nation-state and the local. Rather, it shifts 
attention to the micro and the everyday, whilst continuing to recognise the local and national are always 
intertwined (Bjorkdahl and Mannergren Selimovic 2016). 
With the recognition peace is a process woven in the everyday, as well as at a political elite level, there 
have been calls  both in geography and beyond  to engage with more expansive and dynamic 
conceptualisations of peace and with transformative practices of micropolitical peace-weaving 
(Gleditch, Nordkvelle and Strand 2014; Inwood and Tyner 2011; Megoran 2011; Williams and 
McConnell 2011; Williams, Megoran and McConnell 2014). Several geographers have responded to 
this call (see Brickell 2015; P. Daley 2014; Darling 2014; Courtheyn 2016, 2018; Koopman 2014; 
Laliberte 2016; Lepp 2018; Loyd 2012; Megoran 2010; Schoenfeld et al. 2014; Woon 2014, 2015; 
Williams 2013, 2014). Yet, to date, geographies of peace have largely failed and positive peace 
remains a vague and untheorised concept (Courtheyn 2018; Koopman 2011; Loyd 2012). Failure lies 
with the dominant theoretical engagement  both ontologically and epistemologically  through which 
peace and its everyday materialities are approached.  
The geography of peace literature is primarily rooted in critical geography and critical geopolitics. 
Bregazzi and Jacksons (2018) examination of the influential, post-structural thinking of Michel Foucault 
and Jacques Derrida, reveals how these sub-disciplines are highly reliant on theoretical positions 
grounded in social agonism. To start from agonism, as Bregazzi and Jackson (2018) argue, precludes 
the possibility of peace from the outset. Agonism reads sociality and, critically, the constitutive effect of 
difference as necessarily and irreducibly conflictual, divisive, and violent. Discussing identity formation 
and the outplaying of identity politics in his book The Lies That Bind, Kwame Anthony Appiah (2018) 
maps the workings of social norms by which differences are publicly addressed. Norms of politeness 
censor negative commentaries of difference. Appiah (2018: 94) labels these norms a potent prohibition, 
commenting after all, given our clannishness, commentary on differences always carries some risk of 
creating ill. Although theoretically removed from agonism, Appiahs commentary illustrates how meshing 
difference and clannishness into a singular trajectory works not only to group bodies into essentialised 
mass tribes but to, also, set up difference as a violent dualism. The oppositional, hierarchical structure of 
difference produces collective clannish sentiments whereby we prefer our own kind and were easily 
persuaded to [violently] take against [inferior] outsiders (Appiah 2018: 31). Sociality, then, is founded 
upon a narrative of confrontational differences grouped and divided through bounded, hierarchical 
categories of us and them; it is founded upon the standardised and inherited truths that bind us. Critical 
geography and critical geopolitics approach binding truths of difference, and the binary sociality they 
operate to construct, as necessarily agonistic and violent.   
An intrinsically agonistic social horizon limits critical scholarship to the persistent potentials for conflict 
(Bregazzi and Jackson 2018: 72). The political task of agonism lies in critique, wherein there is a continual 
struggle to unveil the underlying presence of violence. Even when peace is the objective, there is always 
an original and necessary space reserved for conflict (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018). Adam Ramadan 
(2011: 195), whose thinking draws from experiences grounded in the tensions of Lebanon and Palestine, 
argues our explorations of peace must never lose sight of the dominant relations and practices of power 
continuing to inflict spaces of love and nonviolence and, ultimately, prevent peace. Thinking rooted in 
agonism approaches peace, first theoretically and then empirically, with caution as practices of love, 
trust, compassion, kindness, friendship, and care are always-already embedded within power relations 
and forms of violence (Williams, Megoran and McConnel 2014). As a theoretical possibility peace and 
its constitutive grounds are lost, deferred as Messianic, unachievable, aporetic, an impossible perfection 
(Bregazzi and Jackson 2018: 74). Agonism approaches peace as a utopian impossibility masking 
ongoing and originary operations of power, exclusion, inequality, and domination. Unable to breathe 
autonomously from violence, critical geographies of peace are a continual preoccupation with the 
geography of war or, at best, a geography of the less-than-violent (Darling 2014), of the non-violent 
(Woon 2014), or of an imperfect peace (Munz 2011 in Courtheyn 2018). The peace in the geography 
of peace has been lost in a movement of incessant deferral.  
A critical practice of unveiling violence cannot animate peace. Irigaray (1993a) argues to remain within 
criticism is to stifle any capacity for change, creativity, and invention. A political task of criticism confines 
society, and both its culture and politics, to a process of fatal repetition. The stasis of repetition reduces 
peace to an empty rhetoric rather than a felt and living reality; worlds, relations, and bodies are held 
in the haunting stasis of violence. Change and transformation necessitate a movement beyond critique. 
This movement can be grounded within a feminist politics.  
Feminist politics seeks not the deconstruction of the given (Puig de la Bellacasa 2012), but the passionate 
creation and cultivation of alternatives (see Dowler and Sharp 2001; Gibson-Graham 2006a; Haraway 
1997; Koopman 2011; Sharp 2011; Povinelli 2011). This is not to deny the importance of critique and 
the meaningful task of revealing the latent and invisible violence inflicting many facets of sociality. Nor 
does it dismiss how war and peace can be in paradoxical relation. It does, however, stress how positive 
understandings of peace and peaceful practice remain unrecognised, or untheorised, from within an 
agonistic horizon organised around domination, control, power, and exclusion. Opposed to restricting 
peace to the less-than-violent or non-violent, we need to engage with a peace existing alongside, but 
breathing autonomously from, violence and conflict. Agonism has exposed the war in peace (Bregazzi 
and Jackson 2018). Yet, as Koopman (2011: 193) writes, peace too is inside war. Extant moments and 
space of peace will only become a theoretical and practical possibility when emphasis is rerouted from 
continual, incessant criticism to a pre-figurative political task of creation, invention, and change, wherein 
conditions of possibility open onto unknown and uncertain but potentially peaceful futures (Gibson-
Graham 2006a). 
3.3 Thinking a New Horizon: Trac ing breath in Ir igarays th ink ing 
Luce Irigarays ontology is concerned with the invention of new, alternative worlds. Irigarays 
philosophical and practical project primarily coalesces around sexuate difference,20 and building worlds 
moving with the becoming of the sexuate, largely human, body; the invention of worlds and bodies 
belonging to a sexed nature to which it is proper to be faithful (Irigaray 1996: 11). Thirty years ago, 
20 Irigarays earliest work used the term sexual difference opposed to sexuate difference and, thus, both appear 
in this thesis. Irigaray (2008b: 142) explains: I use the term sexuate, rather than sexual, in order to avoid the 
all too frequent confusion between sexuate identity and sexual choice. Sexuate difference is more basic, it is 
ontological. 
Irigaray (1993a: 5) announced sexual difference is one of the major philosophical issues, if not the issue, 
of our age. However, the Western world has long silenced sexuate difference.  
But, whether I turn to philosophy, to science, or to religion, I find this underlying issue still cries out in 
vain for our attention Both in theory and in practice everything resists the discovery and 
affirmation of such an advent or event. In theory, philosophy wants to be literature or rhetoric, 
wishing either to break with ontology or to regress to the ontological. Using the same ground and 
the same framework as first philosophy, working toward its disintegration but without proposing 
any other goals that might assure new foundations and new works (Irigaray 1993a: 5-6). 
Sexuate difference has been neglected and unthought-of in the Western world. Yet, sexuate difference 
is an undeniable and natural reality. It is the first difference and, what is more, the elaboration of all 
other differences.  
Irigaray (2004a: xiv) asserts ontological difference must begin with the most basic and universal, the 
one which first articulated nature and culture  sexuate difference.21 The first difference is not the most 
intense difference,22 for this presupposes the impossible qualification between differences. Sexuate 
difference, as Grosz (2011: 104, original emphasis) illustrates, is ontological difference: 
Sexual differenceis the condition for the emergence of all other differences, even if these other 
differences (phenotypic or morphological) are not ultimately reducible to sexual differences. And 
this is the case, for Irigaray, because sexual differences have an ontological status, or rather, 
perhaps more interestingly, because ontology itself has always been sexualizedsexual difference 
is ontological difference.  
Sexuate difference resides within a universal, horizontal horizon. Whilst differences such as, for example, 
race, nationality, gender, religion, are not ultimately reducible to sexuate difference, all differences 
reside within the horizon of sexuate difference. The work of sexuate difference does not simply seek to 
politicise the other but to recast the political (Chanter 1995): to challenge conceptual systems which 
refuse to acknowledge their own limitations and their own specific interests[a challenge to] and 
undermining of the modes of representation, models and systems which represent, theorise and analyse 
the world and which help to produce them as such (Grosz 2005: 175). It is a reformulation of the real 
in which everything concerning the relations between the subject and discourse, the subject and the world, 
the subject and the cosmic, the microcosmic and the macrocosmic is reconfigured towards its 
transformation (Irigaray 1993a: 6). Sexuate difference is the recasting of contemporary political 
frameworks to actualise the becoming of all differences.  
21 There are many readers of Irigaray  most prominently Drucilla Cornell, Penelope Deutscher, and Judith Butler 
(see Butler and Cornell 1998; Deutscher 2002, 2003)  who criticises her conceptualisation of the woman, of the 
feminine, and of sexuate difference for not accommodating the other categories, especially race and ethnicity, by 
which the body is identified or for reducing these categories to an expression of sexuate difference. These criticisms 
tend to be particular acute in the later aspects of Irigarays thinking. 
22 As articulated by Grosz (2011, p. 107), who agrees sexuate difference is the universal, ontological condition of 
earthly life rather than a performatively produced artifact as Butler claims in her work: Irigaray never claimed 
that in addressing other forms of oppression we should consider sexual difference the most important, only that we 
should consider our oppression where it affect each of us most directly, where is touches each of us in our specificity. 
Irigaray (1993a: 6) illustrates there are strategies and interventions to animate the revolution necessary 
for the work of sexuate difference to take place. Creation and invention animate a revolution in thought, 
in epistemology, in ethics, and in politics. This revolution will be the making of alternative worlds that are 
not simply the birth of symbolic social change but the becoming of new foundational structures that 
govern existence (Roberts 2014: 11). The question of sexuate difference is a question of ontology, and 
to recognise and mobilise sexuate difference as ontological is imperative for the creation of a new 
poetics (Irigaray 1993a: 5, original emphasis). Irigaray locates the body not in language, as has been 
the habit of Western tradition, but in air (Irigaray 2000b). She (1993a: 127) argues the first home of 
the body is the air we breathe, in which we live, speak, appear; the air in which everything enters into 
presence and can come into being. The materiality of bodies is elemental, aerial. A sexuate ontology 
poses a question of the ethics and politics of existence, of life, of living, of vitality; it is a question of 
breath  the very embodiment of air. 
Breath is a potential strategy by which the revolution of sexuate difference  and I would argue the 
animation of peace  can be realised. Irigarays philosophy, first and foremost, is inventive. It is an 
opening to creativity and becoming, an extant movement whose advent resides in future worlds: a future 
not characterised by violence, partition, and stasis but an ecological future in which the potential for 
sharing, for peace, and for becoming is animated. Irigarays philosophy has been a practice in learning, 
or more precisely re-learning, to breathe. Breath is the elemental movement of both the growth of 
thinking and the blossoming of materiality. It is in thinking-with the movement of breath that a new 
ontology is born, and it is by cultivating a practice of breathing that bodies and worlds are born into a 
continual and relational movement of blossoming. Irigaray (2004a) describes the future as the age of 
breath. I locate the possibility of peace in this future age of breath. 
Breath holds a primary position in Irigarays philosophy. It spans the breadth of her work and is present 
across the three aspects of her thinking. The initial aspect of Irigarays work is the most critical while the 
later aspects are more inventive, focused on creating new possibilities for the becoming of sexuate 
difference. Yet, it is important to note the entangled nature of these two strands. Irigaray (2008b: 124) 
herself explains the three aspects to her work: 
I would rather say that the first part of my work amounts to a criticism of the Western tradition as 
constructed by a single subjectivity, a masculine subjectivity, who has elaborated a logic and a 
world according to his own necessities. In the second part, I try to indicate mediations which permit 
a feminine subjectivity to emerge from the unique and so called neutral Western culture, and to 
affirm herself as autonomous and capable of a cultivation and a culture of her own. The third part 
of my work is devoted to defining and rendering practicable the ways through which masculine 
subjectivity and feminine subjectivity could coexist, enter into relation without submitting or subjecting 
the one to the other, and construct a world shareable by the two with respect for their own worlds. 
Of course, these three stages or aspects of my thinking intertwine and interact. 
Through the different aspects of Irigarays work, breath has gained an increasingly important and 
foundational presence (kof 2015). Whilst I situate my engagement within the third aspect  an 
understanding of how the self and the other could enter into relations of breath devoid of violent 
elimination and create a sharing of worlds  these phases cannot be taken discreetly, they influence 
each other, and are rearticulated in one and other. Thus, to attend to breath is to begin to trace the 
trajectory of Irigarays thinking in its intertwinement and interaction.   
3.3.1 Aspect One: The forgetting of air  
Irigarays first aspect illustrates the forgetting of breath in the Western world (Byrne 2013, Irigaray 
2002a, Still 2012).23 The forgetting of breath accounts for the world as it currently stands: a world that 
recognises only one type of subject  the masculine subject. This is the central claim of Irigarays work, 
which reverberates and inspires the breadth of her thinking. The first aspect of Irigarays work is a 
critique of the Western world, aiming to bring to light the stasis of sameness engineered through the 
recognition of the one: the reduction to a hierarchical horizon of sameness through the narcissistic work 
of projective identification that fails to engage in the practice of breathing.  
The symbolic representation and cultural outplay of projective identification structures Western 
metaphysics upon hierarchical dualisms: masculine or feminine, mind or body, sensible or transcendental, 
natural or cultural, living or logical, us or them. Rather than reconciling the good and bad within one 
body and coming to terms that this body belongs to the self, projective identification takes an easier 
route and constructs a split between good experience and bad experience, between the good body 
and the bad body. Once split, the good is introjected towards the self, whilst the bad is projected 
towards the external other (Whitford 2007). The essential origin and identity projected onto the other 
is based on what this body is predetermined to lack or what has already been marked as foreign, in 
relation to positive characteristics and attributes projected onto the self (Daley 2014). Western culture 
typically thinks of man and women, culture or nature, us or them as one thing and its opposite, preventing 
the latter from being anything but a deficient, faulty version of the former (Khader 2011: 3). The self 
becomes dependent upon the other, as it is only in knowing who we are not that we can know who we 
are; the mass collective of us is only the same in an opposing relation of distinction to their collective 
community.24  
The community of us and the community of them exists in a relation of comparative difference  two 
fixed entities for which there exists no middle position, a necessary empty space between our essential 
23 Irigarays earliest work makes little reference to breath. It was only with the publication of The Forgetting of Air 
in Martin Heidegger in 1983 (translated into English in 1999) this more critical phase was reframed as a forgetting 
of breath. Thus, this aspect aligns to her earlier thinking but was not articulated as such till later in time, which 
accounts for the temporal disjuncture in dates as your move along the three aspects of Irigarays thinking.  
24 Although not traditionally arrived at through the working of projective identification, identity politics and, thus, 
difference are broadly considered to work through an opposing, conflictual us-them discourse (see Appiah 2018; 
Hall 1991; Tajfel 1982; Turner 1987; Ullah 1990). 
essence and their essential essence (Grosz 2011; Hill 2012). Projective telling not only assigns the other 
an inferior identity but negates this pre-constructed essentialised identity by making the other our own 
(Irigaray 2002a). The consequence is that it is self and never the other who is spoken (Barad 2014). The 
others capacity to strive in their own becoming is annihilated as the (feminine) body is pulled out from 
itself: from the very beginning she starts to measure herself against masculine performances...she 
identifies herself...with half of humanity and above that not her own half (Irigaray 1999b: 10). 
Impossible to become man, the female body is always-already recognised as aligning to a subordinate 
fixed position within the dominant (masculine) social order inaccessible to the female as an autonomous 
feminine subject. Irigaray (1985a: 224) voices the position of the female as the still undifferentiated 
opaqueness of sensible matter, the store (of) substance for the sublation of self. The very presence of 
the feminine other is eliminated, their breath appropriated, in a gesture of (external) incorporation that 
reduces difference to a stable and permanent sameness. As Irigaray (1993a: 108) writes she has barely 
been allowed a little air, a crack in the rock to permit breath.  
Binary logic institutionalises a forgetting of breath that extends beyond the female body. Irigaray 
suggests the denial of sexuate difference partly stems from the mans difficulty with his natural belonging. 
Peng Cheah and Elizabeth Grosz (1998b: 7) illustrate how, according to Irigaray, the patriarchal 
repression of sexuate difference is historically coextensive with the human subject's disavowal of his 
indebtedness to nature and his loss of respect for the nature in himself. In consigning the other to a lesser, 
faulty position, the masculine subject imposes limits upon his own body through an exclusion or forgetting 
of, amongst other things, corporeality, embodiment, nature, and maternal relations (Faulkner 2001): he 
would prefer nevertheless to dwell in death rather than to emerge into the free air, in this outside where 
he dwells alone and where absence takes place (Irigaray 2001: 313). The forgetting of breath and the 
split of the natural and the cultural reduces bodies and worlds to a singular Being (ontological) and 
being (ontic). What is forgotten is that man and women are from the very beginning not only two 
different being but also two different Beings (Irigaray 2008b: 133)  a being-two that is at once ethical, 
political, and ontological yet always material, corporeal, fluid, embodied, and generative.  
3.3.2 The Second Aspect: Breathing between mother and daughter  
The second aspect of Irigarays work seeks to create the emergence, both philosophically and practically, 
of an autonomous feminine subjectivity.25 Rachel Jones (2011: 160) succinctly articulates the breadth of 
Irigarays aim: 
25 Irigaray has been criticised for essentialism which, following Diana Fuss (1989: xii), can be understood as a 
belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the whatness of a given 
entity. Mary Pooveys (cited in Chanter 1995: 4, other notable critics are Monique Plaza, Lynne Segal and Toril 
of female desire and in basing feminine language on the physical properties of female genitalia. In contrast, Fuss 
(1989: 72) argues: Irigaray works towards securing a woman's access to an essence of her own, without actually 
prescribing what that essence might be, or without precluding the possibility that a subject might possess multiple 
essences which may even contradict or compete with one another.' Tina Chanter (1995: 44) explores the essentialism 
critique yielded against Irigarays work (see also Martin 2000; Poe 2011; Schor 1989, 1994; Whitford 1989), 
...is not simply to find alternative ways of representing the female sex...she is arguing that we need 
to rethink the relation between our being and our bodies, as well as between form and matter, self 
and other, if we are to be able to think of woman as a sexuate subject. Irigarays explorations of 
female self-relation are designed to engender figures for a female autonomy that would permit us 
to affirm being (as) [at least] two. 
The cultivation of female self-relation will be the realisation of sexuate difference: the realisation culture 
and nature and living in its breadth is, at least, two (Irigaray 1996). A realisation which reconfigures 
ethical, political, ontological, and social structures that create and govern our existence (Roberts 2014). 
This aspect, then, is a creative intervention into the sameness of narcissistic culture and a challenge to 
psychoanalytical models of subjectivity and existential models of the self (Wheeler 2004: 230). Morny 
Joy (2011) argues Irigarays creative intervention of female subjectivity resides in two related tasks. 
One is the cultivation of values and virtues, associated with female figures from the past  be they 
mythic or protohistoric (Joy 2011: 225). Here, Irigaray (see 1986) seeks to create a positive, 
autonomous feminine divine from which a feminine imaginary can be realised. The realisation of this task 
manifests in Irigarays deep engagement with Antigone (see Irigaray 1993a, 2000a, 2010a, 2010b) 
and, to a lesser extent, Aphrodite (see Irigaray 1993a). The other intervention lies with cultivating self-
possession, self-consciousness, interiority and integrity  the cultivation of feminine subjectivities. It is in 
this second intervention that breath plays a vital role.26  
The body enters autonomous presence in the practice of breathing. Irigarays original construction of this 
argument resides in her development of a positive mother-daughter relationship,27which necessitates an 
autonomous female subjectivity. Phallocentric logic limits female subjectivity and the place of the feminine 
to a representation of the maternal. This not only reproduces the feminine as an object or thing to support 
the dominant place of man, but it also prevents the engendering of a female culture by reducing feminine 
relations to competition and rivalry (Roberts 2014). In breath, however, the daughter cultivates her own 
feminine autonomy and the potential for women-to-women sociality: it is the daughters autonomous 
ultimately arguing: the charge of essentialism appeals to oversimplified dichotomies that need reworking. 
Irigarays work was vehemently considered as essentialist for years but such critiques have largely died out (Roberts 
2014), and Irigarays more recent writing are, in a related movement, accused of privileging sexuate difference 
over racial differences and, also, privileging the heterosexual, gender normative body. 
26 Breath is not the only instrument by which an autonomous feminine self-possession and integrity will be cultivated, 
other notable strategies include the development of an autonomous feminine language (see The Mechanics of 
Fluids in Irigaray 1985b; see Love of the Other in Irigaray 1993a; The Sharing of Speech in Irigaray 2002b; 
Linguistics: Sharing Language in Difference in Irigaray 2004a; Language to Produce Something or to Produce 
Someone Irigaray 2017; and for commentary Hass 2000; Olkowoski 2000; Pinggong 2018), of placental 
economies (see On the Maternal Order in Irigaray 1993b; and for commentary Fannin and Colls 2013;Schwab 
1994), and of the image of the two lips (see When our Lips Speak Together Irigaray 1985b; and for commentary 
Boulous Walker 1998; R. Jones 2011). Advancing sexuate rights, reconfiguring representations of love, and 
developing positive representations of maternal genealogies also contribute to this task.  
27 Although beyond the scope of this thesis, sexuate difference reconfigures the mother-daughter relationship and 
the maternal body (see Cavallaro 2003; Fannin and Colls 2013; Irigaray 1981, 1985b, 1991, 1993a; Jacobs 
2007; Roberts 2014; Whitford 1991a; Schwab 1994). Whilst in the earlier work breath is a strategy for 
developing positive mother-daughter relations, in Irigarays later work  as we shall see  her thinking around 
breath has progressed. In the third aspect, breath is an instrument in its own right for cultivating an embodied, 
interior autonomy. 
breathing that has enabled her to emerge as a feminine subjectivity that is not split from the mother 
(Roberts 2014: 189). In breath the daughter takes care of her own life and separates the self from the 
maternal body first giving life. As Irigaray (1981: 61) writes: 
A little light enters me. Something inside me begins to stir. Barely. Something new has moved me. 
As though Id taken a first step inside myself. As if a breath of air had penetrated a completely 
petrified being, unsticking its mass. Waking me from a long sleep. From an ancient dream I start 
to breathe, or rather I start to breathe againI no longer need your belly, your arms, or your 
words to return or to leave. I am still so close to you, and already so far away Youre there. Im 
here. Between us so much air, light, space to share with each other. 
In the act of respiration, the female body cultivates her own autonomy, a generative difference of her 
own body, and a relation to another autonomous feminine body. She breathes a world of her own, a 
world existing in addition to the masculine world and, thus, one challenging the sameness and one-subject 
logic of the Western culture to bring about a becoming that is at least two. The question now becomes 
how does the feminine and masculine coexist? How do we build a world shareable by the two? 
3.3.3 The Third Aspect: The relat ional force of breath  
The third aspect of Irigarays work most closely moves with breath and is directly informed by her own 
practices of respiration and yoga. Whilst this aspect interacts and interweaves with the other two, it 
illustrates a noticeable shift in orientation and emphasis.28 The third aspect primarily concentrates upon 
breath, love, relationality, ontology, the natural and the vegetal, and intersubjectivity. This aspect is 
Irigarays most creative phase. She seeks to think and practice the becoming of new, alternative worlds 
wherein the self and other come together in peaceful and loving relations. The third aspect most directly, 
if not explicitly, addresses the question of peace and, more specifically, offers theoretical and practical 
mechanisms for thinking with an elemental and aerial ecology of peace-weaving  with an alternative 
horizon not founded upon a position of agonism.  
Sexuate difference presupposes an ethical task and, arguably, it is in this third aspect that the ethics of 
sexuate difference gains acute attention. The third aspect presupposes a fundamental question both of 
and to humanity: how do we relate as self and other, and who and how might we become in this process 
of relation? As the trajectory of Irigarays thinking has begun to acutely address the potential for 
28 A number of academics who engage in depth with Irigarays thinking argue the later aspects of her work are a 
betrayal to what came before (see Cornell and Butlers 1998 and Schwab 2007 for comments). Engaging this 
critique and the general, broader dismissal of Irigarays thinking, Cheah and Grosz (1998b) write: Irigaray's work 
seems to have suffered a curious atrophy in its translation across the Atlantic. Most commentators regard her as 
primarily a thinker of subjectivity, identity, sexuality, and desire and rarely consider her as a political theorist or 
an analyst of social and cultural life. Thus, even the most sympathetic readers have tended to extract the social 
and political implications of her work from her earlier and primarily psychoanalytic texts, which are then taken as 
so emblematic of her work that her later writings are rarely read, let alone discussed. Consequently, Speculum of 
the Other Woman and This Not One have effectively functioned as synecdoches of her entire oeuvre. These are 
clearly important feminist texts, but they do not represent the entirety of her work, which has developed, refined 
itself, and undergone many inflections, reorientations, and differences of emphasis since her earliest publications 
nearly twenty-five years ago. This, of course, is hardly surprising: it marks the history and maturation, the 
development and elaboration of the political and intellectual work of a lifetime. 
peaceful sharing in difference, her critique of the Western world has been articulated as a reality of 
the social realm and social forms, where it takes on a broader ontological significance beyond masculine-
feminine relations, even as sexuate difference remains the first difference.29 The third aspect returns to 
the forgetting of air Irigaray first identified from her engagement with Heidegger. This critique has 
however shifted. The forgetting of air is no longer thought exclusively as the unthinking of female 
subjectivity but, also, the forgetting of ontological conditions of relationality. Her critique of hierarchical 
sameness and the question of sharing is read within the broader dualisms of self-other and us-them  
a dualism defining wars, conflicts, and violence throughout the world. Before we begin to explore breath 
as the cultivation of a relational horizon, we should first consider this broader articulation.  
The Western world, today, persists on the respiration of an already exhaled, already used, not truly 
pure air (Irigaray 2002a: 74). We do not consider living, growing, and blossoming a task of the human 
body. Rather than cultivating what could be, we engage in the task of exploring and exploiting what 
already is. Any impetus for creation and invention has been lost. We remain in the past, where we 
celebrate the dead and forget the living (Irigaray 2002a).  
Unveiling the mystery of our origin is probably the thing that most motivates our quests and plans. 
This question so much worries us that, perhaps, we have not yet begun to live, in ourselves and in 
the world. We would like to know from where we come, from what or from whom we exist, in order 
to dwell there and grow in continuation with that from what or from whom we are. Our most secret 
dream may consist in being a tree, the existence of which is determined by the place where it took 
root. Hence our ceaseless search for roots: in our genealogy, in the place where we were born, in 
our culture, our religion or our language, and also in what we project onto the most distant future 
but which, in reality, corresponds to the quest of the most indiscernible closeness (Irigaray 2017: v).  
We opt for stasis opposed to living, for the comfort and certainty of a rooted dwelling. Furthermore, we 
approach and perceive everything and everyone else through a rooted origin. We root individual bodies 
 both the self and the other  within mass communities, cultures, and traditions.  
To locate the origins of the body in static roots, approaches both the self and the other as essentialised, 
determined objects known in their totality. The other is not met as a living, breathing body but as an 
object engineered by the enveloping, cultural milieu into which it was born. Reflecting on the world as it 
29 The question of ontology is given greater emphasis in this third aspect and, whilst in some ways Irigaray has 
been the force of this reorientation, the increasingly ontological emphasis largely resides with how feminist scholar 
are engaging with her work as an ontological reconfiguration (see Whitford 1991a, 1991b, 2007; Grosz 2005, 
2011; R. Jones 2011; Mortensen 2002; Roberts 2014, 2017; Stone 2006). Following Rachel Jones (2011), the 
movement from sexual difference to sexuate difference can be interpreted as illustrative of the increasing 
ontological emphasis of her work. The use of sexuate and sexual difference are related, which becomes clear when 
Irigarays work is approached in its totality and as movement both of critique and creation. Rachel Jones (2011: 
4) understands: ...sexual difference to be that which western culture has forgotten and which Irigaray seeks to 
recover, whilst the sexuate involves taking up a positive relation to sexual difference by acknowledging it as the 
irreducible difference which inflects every aspect of our being. 
is and the reduction of living relations to appropriative subject-object relations, Irigaray (2017: 69) 
writes: 
When our logic favours subjectobject relations, without being much concerned with discovering and 
establishing what would be a logic of intersubjectivity, it does not consider breath and energy which 
enliven the existence of living beings and render them irreducible to objects subjected to a human 
grasp and assessment. It removes beings from their living conditions and reduces them to inanimate 
products. However variant the grammar may be, that its category of animate person makes 
possible, the other, and even oneself, are then subjected to syntactic structures which paralyze the 
becoming of each and of the relations that each can have with other living beings.  
A logic favouring subject-object relation, paralyses relations between the self and the other to the 
violence of assimilation, appropriation, and dependency. In this paralysis, air is passive and unregistered, 
breathed without engagement, reflection, and encounter. Breath is forgotten as bodies are rooted in 
mass traditions, cultures and communities, where living, relational, and intersubjective experience is 
reduced to static repetition  a world in which critique is essential and agonism holds the originary 
position. Irigaray, however, does not remain at the level of critique but animates a return to the element, 
to our original potential. Origins here lie not in the ceaseless search for natural and innate roots, not 
with belonging to a mass Being. Elemental origins are the making of incipient possibility. Peace without 
breath is an impossibility.  
The third aspect of Irigarays work is undoubtedly the most creative. Grosz moves with this creativity to 
read sexuate difference as a force. In her book Time Travels: Feminism, nature and power, Grosz discusses 
the future of feminist thinking and stages an uneasy, yet productive, conversation between Irigaray and 
Gilles Deleuze. This fraught encounter creates novel modes of thought, by rupturing the habitual thinking 
of both Irigarayan and Deluzian philosophies to animate new lines of difference. Grosz (2005: 172) 
determines the future of feminist thinking to lie with the mobilisation of sexual difference as force; and 
[the animation of] force itself as divided, differential, sexualised.  
Without defining what force is, Grosz gives force a particular materiality and movement. Force(s) is both 
distinct and a multiplicity. It is that which both establishes and severs connections between (forces that 
compose) things and relations (Grosz 2005: 188). Forces have their own history, intentionality, and 
interests. Not mobilised by intentions, goals or purpose, force simply seeks to act, to expand, to become 
more and other (Grosz 2005: 190). This movement of becoming is invariably a relation of intensity and 
forever a competitive struggle. Force embodies a relation of magnitude of more or less without depletion 
or end and, in encountering other forces, force is always-already in contestation whilst being 
contestatory. Force not only creates competition and struggle between forces active within one sphere, 
it is also the animation of alignment, cooperation, and tension between forces operational within 
difference spheres (Grosz 2005: 188).30 Forces are imperceptible, constituting an inhuman, subhuman 
field, a field of particles or elements of force which are only provisionally or temporarily grouped 
together in the form of entities and action (Grosz 2005: 189). I believe the materiality and movement 
Grosz gives to force is locatable in the materiality and movement of breath. Thus, I read breath as the 
ontological force of relational difference. 
The second aspect of Irigarays thinking establishes breath as autonomous. However, in this third aspect, 
I read relationality to be at the heart of her thinking. As Irigaray (2019: xx) states: ontology never 
concerns only one being but the relation between two beings. Although emphasis in this aspect is more 
concerned with the question of relationality than autonomy, the practice of breathing is continually 
articulated as an autonomous act through which life is given to body (see Irigaray 2002a, 2015a, 2016, 
2017). A body is conceived by two and its existence first resides in an other body. The self, however, 
gives birth to their own body through its first breath.  
Our existence cannot be the outcome of mere chance, and our will to live clearly manifested itself 
at the time of our birth. We were the ones who determined its moment. We were also the one who 
gave birth to ourselves through our first breathing. In spite of the long dependence of the little 
human on others for its survival, it gave life to itself to come into the world, and it gave life to itself 
alone (Irigaray 2017: 1). 
The act of birth, residing in the first breath of the new-born, is the primary and original process of our 
autonomy (Irigaray 2019 seminar). In its first breath the body takes root in the very act of breathing 
that gives life and autonomous difference to the body: the human being is made of matter but also of 
breath (Irigaray 2002a: ix). Breath feeds the body with vitality, life, and growth; it is the a priori 
condition of alla prioris (Irigaray 1999a: 12, original emphasis). We remain in the self in breath and 
cultivate a corporeal interiority through which we make our worlds forever more (Irigaray 2019 seminar). 
Irigaray is quick to point out this is not a perpetual becoming of the same, it is not to take root in an air 
that has already been breathed, but a becoming which is already a venturing beyond that which has 
been known and experienced in life: we are nothing other than a to-be (Irigaray 2017: 101). The first 
breath of becoming is impossible to appropriate, it is not, nor could it be, a used or impure air. However, 
and perhaps in a movement beyond Irigaray, breath is always-already shared. 
For a moment I wish to directly intertwine the different aspects of Irigarays thinking by returning to the 
mother-daughter relation. Breathing, we remember, unsticks the daughter as a petrified object. The 
daughter blossoms independently from her mother in breath, she becomes in her own difference but, 
crucially, she remains in relation to her mother. Breathing animates both proximity and spacing to cultivate 
a relation in-between mother and daughter.  
30 Sexuate difference as a force, then, cannot be read to position either violence or peace as originary. Rather, in 
animates world and becomings in which each remain a possibility.  
Through carrying the child, through speaking to the child, more generally through mothering the 
child once born, she shares her life, her breath. If she gave it without keeping some of it, without 
remaining alive, the other would lose existence. She does not simply give, she shares The mother 
gives her breath and lets the other go; she gives the other life and autonomy. From the beginning, 
she passes on physical and metaphysical existence to the other (Irigaray 2002a: 80-81).  
In-between the mother and daughter are generative relations from which autonomy blossoms. The in-
between is not the advent of fusion or destruction. Relationality is the very articulation of difference; it 
is the articulation of the autonomous body. Sharing is not to share in the breath of sameness but a sharing 
in-between the breath of difference, a sharing in the autonomy of self-differentiation, where the first 
breath of the to-be is not simply grounded in a bounded body but in a constellation of embodied and 
sensuous relations active prior to representational form. In this creative aspect, Irigaray thinks 
relationality so that it is ontologically prior. Difference, then, cannot be thought, or at least not in the first 
instance, as difference from one being to another (as a quantitative difference). The bodys autonomy is 
found first and foremost in the self-differentiating relations that bring such beings into being and 
cultivate their continual growth (R. Jones 2015: 159). As Irigaray (2019: xx) writes:  
We always try to capture being in an identity. But being, in particular our own being, results from 
a conjunction and can neither be nor develop or flower without conjoining. To speak of being, and 
of a new being as such is thus impossible. Being remains always an event or advent to which we can 
give birth through our way of conjoining one another. 
The body is defined not in separation or distinction from the other, but in a relation of self-differentiation 
in-between the self and the other. 
Crucially, this is not to think of community as merely two.31 Nor it is a community of a series of one plus 
one plus one (Irigaray 2004a). The relational limit in-between creates and preserves a space for the 
two. However, as Rachel Jones (2015: 161) acutely illustrates, the in-between simultaneously undoes the 
idea that this two can be anything like two ones  or could even add up to two at all. The in-between 
is replete with generative relations, and it is in the pre-existing, yet continually moving, interplay of 
relationality that bodily specificity emerges through patterns of similarity and difference: neither one 
nor two, such a subject is incalculably in-between (R. Jones 2015: 161). Irigaray (1985a: 139) herself 
writes the two syntaxes are: 
irreducible in their strangeness and eccentricity one to the other. Coming out of different times, 
places, logics, representations, and economies. In fact, of course, these terms cannot fittingly be 
designated by the number two and the adjective different, if only because they are not 
susceptible to comparison. 
31 Irigaray, particularly as her thinking moves through its different aspects, has been criticised for privileging 
heterosexuality, most prominently by Butler in an interview with Cheah and Grosz (1998a: 28) when she states: 
But the intense overt heterosexuality of An Ethics of Sexual Difference and indeed of the sexuate rights 
discoursenot only brought to the fore a kind of presumptive heterosexuality, but actually made heterosexuality 
into the privileged locus of ethics (see also Bergoffen 2007; Johnston 2015; Murphy 2007). This criticism has been 
refuted by several scholars (see Grosz 2011; R. Jones 2015; Roberts 2014: Schwab 1998; Spivak 1993). 
Bodies are at least two, but they are not limited by two. The autonomous process of self-differentiation 
resides in relationality, and this is why encounters across the difference are animated in a sharing of 
breath. 
Breath is not simply held within the body, but a movement bringing the inside out and the outside in. 
Breathing mediates between the internal and the external to create an encounter  or, more precisely, 
a relation of differentiation in proximity  in-between the self and the other. The oscillation between 
inhalation and exhalation gives form and interiority to oneself, whilst simultaneously receiving it from the 
interiority of the other (Malabou and Ziarek 2012). In the interiority of the self, there is always a reserve 
or excess of breath to be shared with the other, as a gift, grace of the moment of our encounter with 
the other (kof 2018: 60). Autonomous breathing, then, does not construct a split from the other. In 
breath, the body blossom in its own interiority within a shared ecology of relationality  breath is not 
merely embodying but always already relational. 
Breath holds autonomy and sharing in relation. For Irigaray this tension can potentially be resolved. In 
an exchange I had with Irigaray at the 2017 seminar,32 Irigaray stressed autonomy and relationality as 
two different processes, arguing it is integral that they remain separate. She acknowledged breath 
cultivates an opening to the other while also preserving the autonomy of the self. However, in our 
exchange, Irigaray argued before there can be relation and sharing, there must first be autonomy: 
relations without autonomy are fictitious, as it is starting from autonomy that we can be relational and 
this is the problem for present existence and for peace (Irigaray 2019 seminar).33 Autonomous breath 
prevents a return to a undifferentiated state of life. Unsurprisingly, as our dialogue developed, Irigaray 
illustrated breath on its own was not enough to cultivate peaceful sharing. She indicated the creation of 
shared worlds reside in the practice of breathing plus something else (Irigaray 2017 seminar). Breath 
opens the body to sharing and is present in the cultivation of a sharing in-between, but breath on its own 
is not, for Irigaray, a shared relation. Irigaray (2008b: 27) states this in conversation with Judith Still, 
32 Since 2003, Irigaray has held a seminar for doctoral researchers engaging with her work. The format of the 
seminar includes a presentation from each of the attendees detailing the aspects of their doctoral research most 
closely drawing upon Irigarays philosophy, a discussion of each presentation within the group, comments from 
Irigaray, and question from participants to Irigaray. Additionally, there are sessions devoted to an explanation of 
keywords or key-thoughts, as selected by the participants, as well as a personal meeting with Irigaray. In 2017 I 
was fortunate to attend the seminar. It was an intense, challenging week but an experience integral to the 
development of my engagement with Irigarays work. 
33 In terms of peace building it is interesting to point out some organisation advocate for and work with people on 
a single identity basis. In simple terms, single identity work involves engaging individuals singularly from within 
ones community to discuss, address and potentially challenge the causes of conflict, with particular emphasis on 
skills and confidence building measures (Church, Visser and Johnson 2002: 2). Whilst engineering inter-community 
contact tends to be at the forefront of peace building work, at least in Northern Ireland, in some arenas and 
circumstances it is deemed preferable to first engage groups in single identity work. Single identity work is seen 
as particularly useful when cross-community work is regarded as untenable, due to continuing feelings of fear, 
mistrust, and suspicion. Only once these acute feelings have been addressed and those involved feel secure in their 
own identity will cross-community encounters be coordinated. Despite years of practice, it remains a source of 
debate in Northern Irelands peacebuilding arena whether single identity work is a necessary first step to building 
cross-community relations or, rather, an end in and of itself (Church, Visser and Johnson 2002).  
when she says: sharing air is not sufficient to maintain the two but cultivating ones own breathing is 
needed to keep ones own autonomy and the difference between us, especially as two. 
Whilst I hope to leave space for an articulation of autonomy precluding sharing, thinking through moments 
and spaces of peace-weaving I find it fruitful to stay with the tension in-between sharing and autonomy 
cultivated in the practice of breath. Irigaray herself has acknowledged this tension and the need of both 
autonomy and relation for the creation of shared and peaceful worlds. In April 2019 I had the 
opportunity to attend another seminar with Luce Irigaray. I had, since our previous meeting in 2017, 
been pondering the question of relation and autonomy as cultivated in the practice of breathing. I had 
returned to Irigarays thinking around breath following the 2017 seminar, however, my reading of this 
work continued to coalesce around the relationality and sharing of breath. Breath was the element that 
was shared by all bodies regardless of their differences (Irigaray 2002a). It was in breath that we could 
assume the solitude of our singularity (Irigaray 2016: viii). Yet, in a shared air we receive breath, and 
the movement and blossoming of living vitality it engenders, from the other (Irigaray 2001: 311). At the 
2019 seminar, when I asked about relationality and autonomy, Irigaray (2019 seminar) clarified: 
Autonomy does not proceed relationality and relationality does not proceed autonomy. Rather, 
autonomy and relationality are in a dialectical process. All of life must go from autonomy to 
relationality and back to autonomy and so forth.  
She continued by illustrating how this dialectical process  how the maintenance of the tension between 
relationality and autonomy  necessitates an oscillation in-between interiority (the return) and exteriority 
(the approach). The movement of this oscillation must be constant so as not to lose the self or the other 
and, in doing so, give one an originary place. Breath, as an inappropriable movement in-between the 
inside and the outside, animates the continual cultivation of the oscillation between relationality and 
autonomy, wherein relation is the self-differentiating process of being (Jones 2019: 114).  
Irigaray also posits breath as the location of the tension in-between autonomy and relationality. She 
states: thanks to what it grants us of life and access to transcendence, a cultivation of breath allows us 
to assume the solitude of our singularity while venturing to share with another ontological destiny 
(Irigaray 2017: viii). What is more, Irigaray (2017: viii) places this tension as heart of her creative and 
inventive sexuate ontology. 
This [sexuate belonging] occurs thanks to a determination which provides us with a dynamism at 
once autonomous and relational able to transform our ecstatic fate into a personal incarnation that 
longs for sharing our ecstasies with the different other, which converts the abandonment of our birth 
into a solitude which gives us back to our being, but also to an original relation of desire and love 
with the other different from us by nature.  
Irigarays thinking, then, is concerned not with identities or subjects but with relations in difference, and 
sexuate difference is the force concerned with the movement of difference that marks the very energies 
of existence before and beyond any lives or imputed identity (Grosz 2011: 91). It is a shift in attention 
to the relational and intersubjective becoming of autonomous difference or, to what Grosz (2011) has 
described as, the prepersonal forces of relational incommensurability forever making the body more. To 
deny a strict chronology between embodied autonomy and a sharing in-between is not to collapse the 
process of autonomy and the process of relationality into a singular movement. To move with the tension 
contained in the continual oscillation of relationality and autonomy, is a continual making of bodies, 
worlds, and relations in an aerial ecology that is always-already in-between.  
Breathing in-between is transformative. The in-between is an indeterminate space of undecidability, a 
tear in the fabric of dualism (Grosz 2001: 93), and a split from the hierarchical horizon of sameness. 
Irigarays thinking, thus, is the creation of a new horizon, within which violence, domination, exclusion, and 
hierarchy do not hold an originary position  a horizon in which differences are not viewed as inherently 
agonistic but as the very movement of living and blossoming vitality. The creation of a new horizon is an 
activity of world-making (Tsing 2015: 292). World-making shifts political emphasis from the unveiling 
of agonism and violence towards the animation of extant and unfolding alternatives making novel 
worlds and futures in their very enactment (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018: 75). It is these futures that hold 
the potential for peace.  
The creation of world-making may reside in the future, but the weaving of peaceful worlds can be 
theorised from life. Irigaray (1996: 10) herself argues she is a militant for the impossible, which is not 
to say a utopian. Rather [she] want[s] what is yet to be as the only possibility of a future. This future, this 
alternative horizon, conveys the possibility of transformation, creation, and making. It is, however, a 
future grounded in the present; it is a new horizon opening within living vitality as it emerges in movement. 
It is with the guiding appeal to the actual and the impossible that Irigarays thinking gains both political 
and ethical importance (Deutscher 2002). Irigarays philosophy is lived and living. The creation of a new 
horizon, of alternative peaceful worlds and futures, lies in the practical, embodying activity of breathing 
and, crucially, in an encounter mediated by a sharing of breath.     
3.4 Practic ing a New Horizon: Tracing the more -than of the encounter  
Parallel to the increasing attention given to the question of peace, geographers  and perhaps in not a 
completely unrelated movement  have started to advance a close and explicit consideration of the 
encounter. These two relatively new arenas of geographical thought should not be approached as two 
distinct fields. By thinking peace and encounter in relation we can begin to animate an authentic 
commitment to peace-as-peace. The geographies of encounters literature, mobilised by timely social and 
political debates regarding community cohesion and hostilities between existing and newly arrived 
groups in the United Kingdom and beyond, has inspired a renewed engagement with Gordon Allports 
contact theory (Amin 2002; Askins 2015; Valentine 2008; Valentine and Sadgrove 2012, 2014). 
Seeking a more complex and critical engagement than offered by Allport, geographers mobilise the 
encounter as a transformative path for thinking through the advent of difference.  
The word encounter, the etymology of which Wilson (2017a) argues is important to consider, stems from 
the French encontre meaning to meet, confront, or fight an adversary or opposing force. The coming 
together of opposites has been witnessed most vividly in colonial narratives (Wilson 2017b) or in what 
Mary Louise Pratt (1992: 4) calls contact zones, which she defines as social spaces where disparate 
cultures meet, clash and grapple with each other, often in highly asymmetrical relations of domination 
and subordination. This antagonistic meeting of opposites is articulated in binary logics of us and them, 
which define border imaginaries and distinguish the natural, internal presence from the external, foreign 
body (Ahmed 2000). The etymology of encounter suggests a form of contact originating from a position 
where characteristics and relations of antagonism and violence have already been defined  a relation 
in which there is always a need to uncover the violence behind any possible potential for peace. The 
geographies of encounters literature mobilise an alternative reading. This reading, following Wilson 
(2017b: 609), advances a conception of the encounter as a relational event, from which the question 
of difference  and I would add peace  can be approached. Encounters are undoubtedly bound up 
with inherited truths and replete with the recognition of identity categories, but this alternative reading 
also seeks to move beyond critique and think encounters differently and, what is more, creatively. 
Encounters are the activity of city life. Doreen Massey (2005) has written that the city is a site of 
throwntogetherness, whereby different trajectories, bodies, and worlds come together in anticipated 
and unanticipated encounters (Yeoh 2015: 545). However, an encounter is much more than coming 
together in city space; contact is not synonymous with encounter (Valentine 2008). Helen Wilson and 
Jonathon Darling (2016: 1) argue if encounters are to be taken seriously, they cannot reside with the 
provision of another empty metaphor for the social and material assembling of urban life. Rather, to 
take encounters seriously is to critically attend to the many complexities, contestations and contradictions 
of contemporary urbanism, with a specific attention to difference. Encounters are fundamentally and 
inherently concerned with difference. 
Encounters are not simply the meeting of different bodies, but the very making of difference. As Wilson 
(2017b: 609, original emphasis) articulates, we are constituted in and by our encounters with others. 
Differences, then, are not fixed upon a hierarchical horizon wherein they are constructed as adversary 
and antagonistic before the event of encounter. Nor does the city simple contain encounters between 
bodies already differentiated according to a predetermined, hierarchical logic. Differences, rather, 
emerge from encounters (Wilson 2017a, 2017b; Wilson and Darling 2016). If the city is composed from 
encounters, encounters can rewrite the city so it is not a mosaic village composed of predetermined and 
immobile borders, but an evolving and unfinished spatial, social and political formation created from 
the pulling together and pushing apart of bodies, spaces, and objects (Wilson and Darling 2016: 9)  
a world in continual making.  
Encounters not only rewrite the city but make the body differently. Wilson (2017a: 456) argues 
encounters demand that we rethink the limits of the body, its capacities and thresholds. They challenge 
normalised modes of perception, inherited assumptions, and habitual ways of thinking and acting. The 
destabilising nature of the encounter prevents a grounding in the comfort of essentialised, known beings. 
The body cannot be determined prior to the encounter, it cannot be recognised as an already 
essentialised Catholic or Protestant being, and what is more, the body will always exceed the encounter. 
Encounters open up the question of how we approach the body as a specific form of relationality 
(Wilson 2017a: 456), opposed to a predetermined category or label. This is an opening onto the 
question of peace and the potential for peaceful relations; it is a question about an alternative and 
novel world-making. 
Despite a growing interest in the geographies of encounter and an increasing emphasis upon their 
transformative potential (see Ahmed 2000; Anderson 2014; Bhatti et al. 2009; Brown 2012; Matejskova 
and Leitner 2011; Popke 2006; Spinney 2015; Valentine 2008), there has been little discussion of what 
actually happens in spaces of encounter (Wilson and Darling 2016) and how they may build relations 
of care, kindness, respect, and trust upon which peace is predicated.34 Once again, it is here that I turn 
to Irigaray and, primarily, her philosophical engagement with breath. Irigaray not only thinks with the 
encounter, but also through it. To think through the encounter is to think with breath: breath is the movement 
of difference and difference is made in the encounter, thus, encounters invariable happen in breath.  
Irigarays work gives voice to a distinct form of relation which, following Judith Butlers (1993: 115, my 
emphasis) close reading, is not primarily that of an encounter, but, rather, a constitutive intertwining, a 
dynamic differentiation in proximity. This constitutive intertwining draws bodies together and pulls them 
apart in relations that are necessarily limited. Irigaray does not conceive of limits in a traditional sense. 
Limits are not a void, a negative, to be overcome. Nor are limits static. The limits infusing Irigarays 
thinking are embodied, sensuous, imperceptible, dynamic, and always-already relational. Limits move 
in-between the self and the other, touching bodies with the realisation you are not the whole and I am 
not the whole (Irigaray 1996: 103). This realisation undercuts unity and identity on both subjective and 
political levels (Malabou and Ziarek 2012); it challenges the binary, hierarchical horizon and cultivates 
a space-time for what lies beyond the bodys own limits, which cannot be known, appropriated, or 
consumed but which, nevertheless, reverberates within ones own space-time as a condition for ones own 
breath (E. R. Jones 2015). The body moves with autonomy only in relation to other who, ultimately, 
remains an enchanting unknown.  
I move on the condition that there is an other, that I am not the whole, that I am limited in my 
subjectivity, my discourse, by the inappropriable place of a between-two that maintains the 
34 This is not, however, to say encounters will immediately and always produce relations upon which peace can be 
predicated (see Listerborn 2015; Staouraiti 2012). Valentine and Harris (2016) have argued encounters need to 
be engaged with critically, and not naively approached as an activity of only meaningful contact. Thus, I am not 
arguing encounters will always produce relations of care but that encounters taking place in breath can be the 
creation of a new horizon in which violence, conflict, and contestation are no more originary than peaceful relations.  
irreducibility of the others relational self with respect to mine (E. R. Jones 2015: 22, original 
emphasis). 
The negative conditions a relational movement opening to the other and towards a shared spacing 
existing in-between, whilst also embodying a return to the world, autonomy, and difference that is mine 
(Irigaray 1996). It is a movement of both inhalation and exhalation, of proximity and difference, of 
interiority and exteriority. This elemental movement corresponds to a kind of double limit that is assumed 
by both (E. R. Jones 2015: 16), a kind of relational weaving moving in-between the self and the other, 
in-between you and me. The structure of the negative  a structure that is ontological  moves with 
breath (Irigaray seminar 2019); a respiration moving with wonder, silence, and sharing. It is these three 
key concepts Irigaray works offers to think through the encounter.  
Wonder is the felt movement of difference. It is the very event of the other (Irigaray 1993a). Wonder 
pulsates through the encounter animating moments of mystery and surprise, in which bodies are touched 
by the becoming of difference in advance of the imposition of form. Breath animates the potential for 
wonder by moving the body to silence. Breath is both active and actively passive. Encountering the other 
in the active silence of breath gives voice to relational limits moving in-between; the body senses the 
limits of the self and gifts to the other the autonomous movement of their own breath. In silence, wonder 
becomes intertwined with a respect for the other and for the excessive becoming of difference. Silence, 
in turn, is an opening onto sharing; it is in silence that we wait ever-ready for sharing (Watrous 2015: 
151). Irigarays encounter is always-already shared in-between.  
Encounters taking place in breath are the creation of an alternative, novel horizon. This future horizon is 
composed not from sameness, polarisation, and hierarchy; it is not a horizon in which agonism and 
violence hold the originary position. Whilst remaining forever speculative, the not-yet of the future 
horizon is not experienced as a void that we have to fill (Irigaray 2017: 71), but as an opening 
cultivating an availability to welcome truth, beauty, joy, one could say grace (Del Gatto 2015); an 
availability opening to an ethics of care (Teo and Neo 2017). It is only when we move within the 
elemental and vital ecology of this future horizon that we can become attentive to the everyday 
relational activities of care within which peace is always-already being woven. Practices of peace and 
peace-weaving need breath; they need living, dynamic spaces of relationality and movement and, 
crucially, the unknown ethical possibilities emerging from them.

Methodology, Methods, and Spaces 
Knowing I wanted to follow breath  its movement, materiality, and relationality  I headed to Belfast 
acutely aware to begin to answer this question, I needed a research practice more fluid, more ephemeral, 
and more open than traditional methodological approaches. Yet, at this stage, I was unsure of what such a 
practice would look like.  
Research Journal, 4th March 2017  
4.1 Introduction 
The weaving of peace cannot solely reside in thinking peace differently. Animating peace-as-peace 
necessitates methodologies and methods that do peace research differently. The creativity of Irigarays 
thinking is inherently active; it is an event engaging with worlds in an open, excessive, and relational 
manner. Although Irigarays work does not explicitly put forth a methodology, Irigarays thinking does 
suggest a methodological approach. I believe an open, excessive, and relational empirical engagement 
can be animated in a methodology of tracing.  
Imitating Anna Tsings (2015) ethnographic method, I put breath and its vitality centre stage. Both 
theoretically and methodologically, I trace breath: I follow the rhythm, tempo, and touch of breath; I 
respire with encounters created in breath; and I move in-between the silences and relations cultivated in 
the embodied practice breathing. Tracing does not attempt to pin down breath to a singular ontological 
dimension or to conceptual limits and definitive endings. Rather, tracing crafts a space-time for new ways 
of entering and moving in the field and for creating more ephemeral, embodied forms and forces of 
knowledge that cut across normative accounts of what it means to know (Manning 2016: 27).35 
An excessive, open empirical approach can be created through a dialogue moving in-between Irigarays 
thinking, affect-based methodologies, 36  and feminist methodologies of diffraction. 37  Both these 
methodologies reject representation, which they regard as inattentive to processual and relational 
becomings. The visual, for Irigaray (1993a: 175), is a sense that can totalise, enclose, in its own way, 
as knowledge is located only in what is visually observable and tangibly representable. Methodologies 
privileging representation are unable to account for the effects and affects of difference beyond 
35 Irigaray (2017: v) argues we become existent by cutting ourselves off  by ec-sisting  from out origins. Here, 
as will become clear, I am arguing knowledge creation resides in cutting ourselves off from the traditional origins 
of strong knowledge. Strong knowledge demands powerful discourses which organise events into understandable 
and seemingly predictable trajectories (Gibson-Graham 2014: 148) that have an embracing reach and reduced, 
clarified meaning (Gibson-Graham 2006b: 4). 
36 Dorothea Olkowski (2000: 80) reads Irigarays ontology as a morpho-logic appropriate to affectivity rather 
than representational form. Irigaray (see 1993b) voices a fluid morphology folding in-between streams of 
affectivity, which although not necessarily perceivable are felt as effect (Olkowski 2000: 80). 
37 Diffraction as a methodology was first conceived by Donna Haraway (see 1992, 1997) and, then, elaborated 
most prominently by feminist physicist Karen Barad (2007, 2014, see also Hultman and Lenz Taguchi 2010; Thiele 
2014a; van der Tuin 2014). 
taxonomic marks grounding difference as apartheid (Haraway 1992: 299). Opposed to representation 
and understandings of a transparent, rational and continuous human subject (Thrift 2007: 14), these 
methodologies move with ecologies of action and relational assemblages encompassing both human and 
non-human forces. These forces may be unformed and unstructured but[they are] nevertheless highly 
organised and effectively analysablein effect, as effect (Massumi 1996: 237). Methodologies 
exceeding representation move with the temporal flow of becoming and, also, the entangled structure 
of the changing and contingent ontology of the world, including the ontology of knowing (Barad 2007: 
73). Unless we begin to animate research practices attentive to processes that move prior to, if still within, 
dominant and pervasive identificatory framings, peace and its possibilities will be confined to static, 
territorial structures simply maintaining what is. It is the attention to difference, alongside the entangled 
weaving of relationality, which put affect, diffraction and tracing into a productive onto-epistemological 
conversation. 
This chapter is composed of three sections. The first section elaborates on tracing as an affective, 
entangled, Irigarayan methodology which, I argue, differs from the traditional geographic practice of 
mapping. Tracing, as I conceive of it, embodies three interrelated characteristics that are each discussed 
in turn: a whole-body tracing, tracing in-between, and a situated tracing. Having detailed the 
methodological position of tracing, I move on to discuss the specific methods mobilised to trace breath: 
textual analysis, observing participation, interviewing, and creative writing. Finally, I introduce Turas and 
the CTS* as my two empirical spaces. 
4.2 Tracing Breath: An Affect ive, Entangled Ir igarayan Methodology 
Geographers traditionally, if not graphically, are engaged in a process of mapping.38 Mapping aims 
to make the focus of research visible through social imaginary frames that, in turn, contour research. 
Mapping is an act of representation starting from and reproducing research objects within defined and 
definitive frames, which in Northern Ireland continues to be the ubiquitous, overtly simplistic Catholic-
Protestant binary. Mapping approaches the field with the assumption the research object, human or non-
human, has a definitive shape, place, flow, process, relationality, ecology, and/or movement that can 
be grasped, plotted in time and space, and made representable in a definitive 'truth. Approaching the 
field with the objective of mapping expunges, or at the very least reduces, difference, ambiguity, 
contradiction, and becoming. Positing the terms of the account prior to the exploration of what is 
happening or moving, stultifies creativity within the limits of what is already known and restricts 
38 I wish to stress that I am discussing mapping in a very traditional sense. I am, thus, not taking issues with the more 
creative forms of mapping and critical cartography advanced by geographers (see Caquard 2013; Cassidy 
2012; Del Casino and Hanna 2005; della Dora 2009a; Dodge and Kitchin 2013; Harris and Hazen 2005; Kitchin, 
Gleeson and Dodge 2013; Krygier 2006; Perkins 2007; Sletto 2009; Young and Gilmore 2013), which aim to 
artistically, and often from within an everyday and collaborative space, challenge that stasis of what is (Crampton 
and Krygier 2006). Arguably, then, my position can be accused as crude and lacking nuance. Yet, the opposition 
between mapping and tracing is less an argument against mapping per se and, rather, is a distinction drawn upon 
to facilitate an argument calling for more creative, affective, entangled, and moving forms of knowledge and 
knowledge-making.  
complexity and ambiguity within mapped borders of pre-existing forms of knowledge. Mapping is 
removed from the vitality and dynamism of living; it is a cut that stills (Manning 2016: 33).  
Tracing, as both method and methodology, gives voice to research as an eventful encounter. It does not 
aim to visibly delineate where breath, and the differences and relations cultivated in the practice of 
breathing, appear. Rather, it moves with the effects and affects of the appearance and touch of breath 
in movements of becoming (Thiele 2014a). Tracing is a practice capable of attending to shared, peaceful 
relations already active in Belfast, without over-determining encounters and the relations, bodies, and 
worlds active within them. It is a tracing of embodied relations as they are respiring and inspiring and, 
what is more, of their creative reconfiguration in an ecological process of world-making. Tracing is both 
process and the result of a process (Sehgal 2014: 189). To mobilise a more processual and less 
definitive research practice is not to withdraw from the political, but to animate research events and 
encounters as vital political spaces in and of themselves. Tracing is grounded in three interrelated 
characteristics  a whole-body tracing, tracing in-between, and a situated tracing  that I now discuss in 
turn. 
4.2.1 A Whole-Body Tracing 
Breath evades mapping. It is largely invisible, and its movement and spatiality do not correspond to a 
definitive form, shape, or direction. Yet, breath continually touches upon the body. As a movement folding 
in-between the inside and the outside, breath cannot be kept at a distance. Breath is a relation and 
dynamic movement rarely seen but always felt in and as effect. This feltness suggests that we can begin 
to tentatively trace breath through an embodied witnessing that is at once generous, attentive, open, 
and responsive (Dewsbury 2003).  
Embodied witnessing does not stand back and observe at a distance but moves with the body as a 
responsive and active agent within worlds. This is not about directing the body towards the world from 
a mapped point or location but a movement of the world from within and as part of it (Barad 2007: 
88). It is a kind of everyday fleshy or carnal seeing and thinking (Irigaray 2008b: 109) that converses 
with the entire goings on  with the feelings, intensities, sounds, sights, textures, and movement as they 
touch in-between sensing bodies (Barad 2003; Dewsbury 2010; Morton 2005). Our culture is dominated 
by the visual and representational. Yet, as Irigaray (2015a: 280) illustrates, it is touch [that] takes part 
in all our sensory perceptions. Touch forgoes representation to foster a haptic sensorial and embodied 
engagement. Tracing breath necessitates a whole-body engagement attentive to the touch of all sensory 
perception. Through the feltness of touch we, potentially, begin to animate the capacity to attend to the 
less noticeable politics of the everyday, which are missed when we privilege visual, objective 
representation (Papadopoulos, Stephenson, and Tsianos 2008).  
Witnessing from within the world encompasses, what Nigel Thrift (2002: 296) has termed, a whole 
bodily logic of sense. A whole-body tracing encounters sound, sight, smell, and touch as different facets 
of the same activity (Ingold 2000: 261). This animates an embodied opening to the specific event in the 
present and puts the specificity of the event into present relation, as the body becomes attentive to 
invisible and imperceptible forces felt, even in anticipation, as movements registering, and resonating, 
across, within and [in-]between the sensing spaces of bodies (McCormack 2009: 36). Through a whole-
body tracing we learn to register and become sensitive to what the world is made of (Thrift 2004: 90), 
and to what makes it forevermore. To engage the body as the sensing, attentive tool of tracing is to 
emphasise action, relationality, and the in-between, as both the subject of inquiry and the approach to 
research (Popke 2009; Dewsbury 2000; Thrift 2004). It is the in-between I now turn to.  
4.2.2 Tracing In-Between 
Northern Ireland is a space in the middle. It is a space in the middle of violence and peace, in the middle 
of the Catholic community and Protestant community, in the middle of Great Britain and the Republic of 
Ireland. Breath, too, is in the middle. Breath ebbs and flows. Pulsates. Inhaling and exhaling. Breath is 
never static, but always-already in the middle of movement. From the moment of birth, we are in the 
middle of the practice of breathing folding in-between. Andrew James McDowell (2014) describes the 
middle as a margin and here breath is also active: at relational limits and margins entangling nature 
and culture, self and other, here and there. To become attentive to breath necessitates a movement in 
the middle; it necessitates a movement in-between.   
Tracing begins in an aerial middle, dancing among the inside and the outside, and across mapped 
borders and defined territories. Tracing does not seek to plot embodied feltness in a particular space-
time. It does not aim for rigid diagnosis and stable representation but seeks to add to the world through 
an infinite series of ands (Cadman 2009) as is follows the movement of touch in-between the inside and 
outside, in-between thinking and practice, in-between speaking and silence, in-between the researchers 
body and the sensuous goings on, in-between the researcher and the researched, and in-between the 
field and non-field. A movement in-between cannot determine what or who the subject is, and what it 
does or does not mean to be Catholic or Protestant. Instead, breath is followed to trace the weaving of 
emerging relationality: to witness bodies in continual becomings; to listen-to the in-between spaces of 
active silence; and to sense sharable worlds and durations. Here, as has been articulated by Gillian Rose 
(1997: 313), research is not an activity of mapping difference  assuming visible distinctly separate 
agents  and more one of asking how difference is constituted, of tracing its destabilising emergence 
during the research process itself. Tracing, then, is not the activation of a pre-formulated research plan 
(Reece, Harries, and McConnachie 2016; Tsing 2005), but an event moving with the unexpected as it 
emerges (Deleuze 1989; Hultman and Lenz Taguchi 2010). It is an ongoing practice of discovery in-
between, wherein peace becomes a question of how we move with and describe extant relations in their 
emergence. 
As an event, tracing moves with an alternative, more poetic, type of knowledge that preserves a space 
for the not-said, not-defined, not-determined (Irigaray 2017: 66). The detailed descriptions cultivated 
in adding to the world through an assemblage of ands is open and incoherent (Latham 2003). It is not 
the production of rigid diagnosis and stable representation but the voicing of an inarticulate and 
unformulated practical grasp in worlds (Nash 2000; Taylor 1991; Thrift 1996). Opposed to a 
disarticulation (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017), it is an activity of adding co-created layers that describes 
something so that it becomes thicker than it first seems (Haraway 2000: 108). This propels the body 
into the midst, into the middle, where we can embrace and find value in that which remains ineffable as 
(strong) knowledge (Manning 2016).  
Tracing cultivates weak knowledge. Opposed to having meaning per se, Kathleen Stewart (2008: 74) 
describes weak theories as having force in some another form. Weak knowledge disregards uniformity 
and stability to embrace fluidity and openness. Tracing moves to effect something less solid and assured 
but more speculative, as contradictions and complexities are not purified but held together, and 
alongside absences and fallibilities (Gibson-Graham 2014; Puig de la Bellacasa 2017; Rose 1997). 
Tracing bypasses knowing, whilst animating the very precondition for understanding. It is a kind of 
knowledge that moves within the experiential register of the not-quite-yet[keeping] actual experience 
open to its more-than (Manning 2016: 29). Unlike mapping, the activity of tracing can never be 
complete: tracing, like breath, will always exceed. Tracing allows for the emergent and continual 
becoming of both the doing and telling of research, where breath, and the bodies and relations it 
animates, remain forever excessive, always in-between, and never settling within mapped frames, 
borders, or territories (Driver 2000; Nast 1998). There cannot be a final destination, only ever new 
relations active within the entangled webs we weave (Barad 2007: 384). Tracing is the creation of a 
knowledge-making that is necessarily incomplete: a situated whole that has no ending.  
4.2.3 A Situated Tracing 
The ephemeral, excessive, and open nature of tracing does not forgo situatedness. Knowledge  weak 
or strong  is situated. Donna Haraway (1988: 583) introduced the term situated knowledge in a 
movement against the positivist notion of objectivity and relativism.39 Arguing against universal and 
irresponsible knowledge, Haraway posits (1988: 589) partiality as the condition of being heard. 
Haraway (1997: 197) articulates: there is no way to make a general argument outside the never-
finished work of articulating the partial worlds of situated knowledges. This is not to say stories and 
experience of breath and peace cannot be witnessed and told, but that this emergent and speculative 
telling remains engaged in a modest, always situated, process of knowledge making. Tracing embodies 
a methodology that, whilst not guided by a priori transcendental categories and borders, is ongoing, 
sensitive, partial, and situated.  
39 Situated knowledge has a long and broad lineage through feminist thinking. For engagements from feminist 
geographer see Abbas 2018, Bondi 2005, McDowell 1993, 2003, Pratt 1992, Rose 1997, Stanley and Wise 
2002, Whatmore 1997, and White and Bailey 2004. 
Tracing follows webs of relationality and difference within a situated spatio-temporal unfolding 
(Dekeyser and Garrett 2017). It is never a disengaged account (Haraway 2000 160), but always a 
view from somewhere (McDowell 1993: 312) and some time (Bradotti 1994). Knowledge that is situated 
takes its own specific and partial form in relation to the specificities of the space-time in which it was 
made (Bradotti 2010), and in relation to the participating bodies active in its making. It is not, however, 
simply the space, time, and participating bodies that create the situatedness of knowledge. Situatedness 
also arises from the active and engaged role the researcher plays in creating the field.  
All knowledge is marked by the personal origins and positions of the researcher (England 1994). Within 
geography, Rose (1997: 309) has acutely considered the situatedness of the researcher, arguing the 
position of the researcher must be made visible via a double reflexive gaze: a reflexivity [that] looks 
inward to the identity of the researcher, and outward to her relation to her research and what is 
described as the wider world. The motivation to study Northern Ireland is personal. Although I have 
been far removed from the Troubles, and Northern Ireland is not a space I am familiar with or rooted 
to through a linear, genealogical history, being caught between the identities of English and Irish, and 
searching for a space of belonging shared by these two identities, does resonate with my own half-Irish 
half-English body. My position in-between England and Ireland and my own search for belonging within 
these nations, particularly Ireland from which I am territorial unrooted, will undoubtedly impact the 
emotions, positions, biases, and assumptions I bring to this research and in ways that cannot be foreseen.40 
What is more, my body  with its Irish name, English accent, Catholic label, British institutional grounding, 
Irish passport and Bristol academic positioning  effects how others relate to and perceive me, 
particularly in the fragmented context of Northern Ireland. How my body effected the creation of the 
field is not, however, something that is pre-determinable, but a condition of situated relations under 
constant negotiation.  
Geography, today, is an innately reflective discipline (Butz and Besio 2009). Yet, the impossibility of 
reflexivity has been widely acknowledged, both within geography and beyond. As Rose (1997: 313) 
articulates there is no transparent self waiting to be revealed. To a degree, and particular in reference 
to the fundamental Catholic or Protestant and Irish or British categorisation, I could actively chose the self 
I presented  I could bring up my Irish heritage, my long summers spent in Cork, my Catholic upbringing 
or I could speak of everyday life in England, living in Bristol and Manchester or Shrewsbury, my place 
of birth, I could talk of my friends and family back in the United Kingdom and my frequent trips across 
the pond to return home. However, I could not escape my Gaelic name and my English accent, and I 
could not control the truths these held or what it meant to other bodies to be Catholic, Protestant, Irish 
or English. Nor could I control the internal, unconscious biases interlaced with these labels. However, the 
meanings of these labels are not static (Billio and Hiemstra 2013).  
40 Perceptions and assumptions influencing research are never static. Nor can they simply be situated within the 
researcher. Perceptions and assumptions  alongside goals, values, motivations, and the questions  shift and alter 
in the co-making of the field (Kirsch and Ritchie 1995). 
My position did not exist in isolation (Hultman and Lens Taguchi 2010) and, neither, was it in existence 
prior to any encounter in the field. Throughout the fieldwork my body shifted along a spectrum of Irishness 
and Britishness, of researcher and participant, of skilled and amateur, of novel and familiar, of quiet 
and chatty, of comfortable and uncomfortable, of passive and active, of central and peripheral. Just as 
the bodies of participants and the emergence of difference are not plottable or mappable, neither is 
the researchers body (Haraway 1988: 585). Tracing is a matter of following not only the emerging 
differences of participants bodies and the differences in-between, but also the situated difference of 
the self as it is emerging in the locality of field. Research, then, shifts from a process of self-discovery to 
a relational process of self-making, following the realisation there can be no self waiting to be revealed, 
as the self in question does not exist in isolation but only through the mutually constitutive social relations 
in their emergence (Rose 1997: 314). A methodology tracing in-between confronts the researcher with 
the realisation that both a transparently knowable self and world is an illusion, with tracing voicing the 
co-appearance and disposition of the self with self, self with other and self with world (Ash and Simpson 
2016: 58). Reflexivity cannot be animated alone but must reside in-between, with the I in the situated 
and emerging midst. 
4.3 Tracing Methods 
A methodology of tracing animates novel ways of entering and engaging with the field. Despite the 
creativity of tracing, the methods I employed to trace breath are standard, traditional geographic 
methods. However, to engaged with traditional methods from a methodological movement of tracing, is 
to make these familiar methods dance a little (Latham 2003: 2000); it is to make them creative. 
Attentiveness to extant relations of peace, woven through a sharing of breath, necessitates this creativity. 
Peace itself requires theoretical and epistemological creativity. 
4.3.1 Textual analysis  
Textual analysis is a close reading of the content, meaning, structure, and discourse of a text (Lockyer 
2008). A text can comprise a number of different mediums (see Aitken 2005), yet the texts I engaged 
with were largely restricted to the policy agreements and frameworks of the Northern Irish Peace 
Process: the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the 2005 policy document A Shared Future: Improving 
relations in Northern Ireland, the 2010 Programme for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration, and, the most 
recent policy framework, the 2014 Together Building a United Community. A situated reading does not 
approach texts in isolation but considers the texts structure, purpose, author/s, audiences, silences, 
temporal rooting, and political context (Aitken 2005).  
James Paul Gees (1999) articulates six different building tasks accomplished by language. The task I 
primarily focus upon resides in the category of activity building, whereby language is mobilised to create 
situated meaning in an ongoing process. The texts are read to trace how knowledge around the practice 
of peacebuilding is formulated, the terms and principles mobilised to inform this knowledge, and how 
this knowledge is validated within peacebuilding practices and throughout society as the truth of doing 
peace both historically and as a future projection (Dittmer 2010). Texts do not, however, hold a singular 
meaning but are mobilised in multiple ways (Lockyer 2008). The texts all have a life that both precedes 
and exceeds my reading. Thus, there is an inherent inability to completely understand a text (Saukko 
2003) and, so, textual analysis remains always partial. 
Textual analysis, in contrast to the other methods employed, is directed at the macro-scale. However, as 
I moved beyond the text (Dittmer 2010; Sayer 2000) and consider the performance and effect of the 
truth of peace and peacebuilding contained in the documents, engagement continues to be situated at 
an everyday level, before once again pulling back to the macro-scale. Although perhaps not embracing 
the openness, excessiveness, and creativity I desired from a methodology, textual analysis provided a 
basis for entering the field as an informed, tactile participant. 
4.3.2 The Tact i le Observing Part ic ipant  
Tracing animates an engagement with the field as an immersed and active observant participator (Thrift 
2000b).41 Deep immersion in-field creates, what J. D. Dewsbury (2010: 327) has called, a portfolio of 
ethnographic exposure that advances the body as the site of knowledge: it animates a sensuous 
knowing of the body-as-a-whole. The doing of fieldwork, then, necessitates getting ones body 
immersed in the field for a period of time sufficient to enable one to participate inside that culture 
(Conquergood 1991: 180). Participation animates the researcher body as both the phenomenon and 
the subject of experience (Dewsbury 2010; Dekeyser and Garrett 2017; Manning 2016). As an 
immersed and active participator, I felt the movement, materiality, and relationality in breath. This is to 
be in touch with everyday living and practices, in the proximity of involvement with ordinary material 
transformation (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 96, original emphasis), wherein knowing cannot be 
separated from being-relating (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 114). It is through touch, then, that we enter 
into relations and become an engaged, situated, and involved observing participant.  
My experience of breathing in the field is detailed in a research journal or field diary. After every 
encounter in the field, I sat down and detailed the experience of being in that space, alongside more 
broad feelings and thoughts of living in Belfast. Non-coherence guided my research journal; I wrote as I 
participated and participated as I wrote, with words continually vibrating against and through previous, 
and future, participations and observations (Watson and Till 2010). The field journal voices the 
embodied and situated experience of participating and breathing in the field (Lorimer 2003). This 
voicing did not intend to reveal once and for all as truth what has appeared today but to sing some 
aspect of the real which today has manifest itself (Irigaray 2004b: 34, my emphasis). Ethnography 
embodies the realisation every view is a way of seeing, not the way (Wolcott 1999: 137, original 
41 Nigel Thrift flipped the traditional social scientific method of participant observation to observant participant 
in order to advance a method engaging with practice, performance, embodiment, and materiality. It is, thus, not a 
method privileging visual observation.  
emphasis), with the research journal voicing an embodiment in the field. A voicing that does not reside 
solely in my body.  
Encountering the field as an observant participant creates a culture in-between. Sarah Pink (2011: 271, 
original emphasis) writes how research does not reside in the collection of data about human and 
nonhuman research participants that is later analysed, but involves the production of meaning in 
participation with them through a shared activity in a shared place. A reciprocal relation of touch 
intensifies a sense of the co-transformative that is always-already political (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 
96). The research journal voices stories that are both descriptive, in that they inscribe, and speculative, 
in that they connect through performances cultivating a reciprocal sharing (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017). 
To engage in the field as an observing participant, then, is to not simply reveal invisible relations of 
positive peace but to also be active  alongside the other bodies in the field and the field itself  in 
breathing peaceful relations. Co-creation shifts from monologue and information to dialogue and 
communication (Conquergood 1991), as we speak-with, listen-to, and act-together (Wall 2006). The 
research journal becomes a shared space, voicing a polylogue encompassing the researcher, the 
researched, and the situated space-time (Anderson, Adey, and Bevan 2010: 598). Co-production makes 
the research journal a space of risk challenging theoretical, methodological, and personal preconceptions 
(Dewsbury 2010; Massey 2003; Whatmore 2003), while the making of questions, motivations, and 
values driving the research exceed a single body. 
The many voices of the research journal are mirrored by the multiple listening-to in its continual re-
reading. Back from Belfast, I was faced with the task of working through the mountain of data I had 
collected in the field. I had no idea where to start. I felt lost and confused. I had no direction and the 
questions I was asking, the questions that had propelled my movement towards Belfast, towards peace, 
and towards breath, were distant. I had spent a year being-with Belfast. I had been immersed and 
engaged. However, as the year progressed, the central aim and focus of this engagement became 
blurred. I had followed breath, yet I had followed it without direction, without a map. The continual 
question projected from Bristol was are you getting what you need? but I had no idea what I needed, 
let alone if I had captured it. After a lot of stalling, I returned to the middle and I read, read, and re-
read the research journal (alongside the interview transcripts). I listened-to the polylogue spoken and 
began to hear the questions, the values, the passions, and the motivations that moved through the pages 
and with the embodied, relational, and situated voices of the field and the bodies active within it. Whilst 
it is my voice weaving questions, descriptions, and motivations together, they do not solely belong to me. 
They arose in the field, in the relations and spaces as they were emerging, and with every re-reading 
they continue in their emergence.  
4.3.3 An Interview Story  
Mirroring the co-creation of ethnography, interviews are a research method in which participants are 
encountered within a shared space and together, in-between researcher and participant, an active 
dialogue is invented. This dialogue is the telling of a story, in which meaning is created and performed. 
The interviews I conducted were all unstructured. With the Troubles forming the backdrop to 
contemporary Northern Irish life, from a sensitive and ethical perspective, the parameters of the 
conversation were largely drawn by the interview participants. Consequently, some conversations 
narrated life-stories in their breath and, so, resembled a life-history interview, while other conversations 
were a telling of stories situated within the space of Turas. The minimal structure gave participants the 
space, time, and breath to organically create the narrative in their own words (Adriansen 2012): they 
held the power to determine what information was voiced and how it was given meaning and emotion 
(Jackson and Russell 2010). Although I provided prompts and direction, by enfolding fact and 
experience in a dialogue of storying, the interviews created space for contingency and agency within 
larger phenomena that may structure or limit but cannot determine. The contextual, everyday focus, and 
the narrators self-freedom animates a dialogue for understanding how bodies are situated in spaces, 
relations, and ecologies, which themselves are continually exceeding what is. 
Life history interviews, and I would argue this extends to interviews in their breadth, must be mobilised 
in their unity (Connell 2010). The researcher respects the narratives unity by remaining faithful to the 
context, materiality, and embodiment of participants words, and the meanings they are imbued with, 
throughout the interviews entirety. The analysis, then, draws directly from the words of interviewees and, 
where possible, situates the context and materiality using the interviewees own words and stories. 
Presenting interviews in their unity does not, however, instil harmony. Narratives are not homogenous but 
spaces of deliberative, if unconscious, contradiction, and fragmentation created in relation to participants 
own desires, needs, and limitations. This potentially gives voice to multiple, dynamic, and contingent 
becomings that cannot be mobilised as truth or fact. Rather, interviews are the co-production of a shared 
understanding across disparate perspectives woven into speculative and precarious stories that help to 
make experience intelligible (Valentine and Sadgrove 2014). They are, thus, encounters necessitating 
silence.  
Although narrative storying often resembles a monologue, communication requires two bodies in an active 
relation, free from appropriation by either interviewee or interviewer. Relational dialogue does not fix 
the other in a static identity, but listens-to entangling narratives and extant differences as they emerge 
in the story. Carrie Hamilton states (2008: 37), the golden rule for the researcher using interviews is to 
listen and keep ones mouth shut. This does not make the researcher passive, but rather places them in 
the active space of silence. Silence is not the acknowledgement of meaning already coded for the 
transmission of knowledge, but a listening-to of the still unspoken words of the other, to his or her specific 
difference touching upon the sensing body. The interviewer must be open to the sensible and tactile, if 
at times uncomfortable, touch of the narrative  to the materiality of words as they caress the body in 
their rhythm, emotion, intensities, vibrations, tone, and silences. Touch draws the researcher into the 
narrative in a relational movement beyond their autonomous control.  
Communication and dialogue continue in the activity of transcription42 and the continual re-reading of 
interview scripts. Re-reading is an emerging encounter. It brings the researcher, once again, into extant 
relations and experiences in-between different bodies and concepts. Such a re-reading requires the 
deployment of the whole body and all the bodys affective perceptions. Crucially, this is not about over-
coming the in-field events. It is an entirely new event, emerging out of the situated activity of reading 
and reading again (Hultman and Lenz Taguchi 2010). What emerges in the active process of re-reading, 
and so what I seek to tell, are entangled poetic stories.  
4.3.4 Making Poetic Stories  
I like the in-betweenness of up and down, of being on the earth and of the heavens. I think thats where 
poetry should dwell, between the dream world and the given world, because you dont just want 
photography, and you dont want fantasy either. 
(Seamus Heaney 2008 in Heaney and Kim 2008: n.p.) 
This thesis is, first and foremost, a story. This story traces breath through the interweaving of archival 
readings, practices of breathing and spaces of breath, the telling of interviews, the halting of 
interruptions, the feltness of respites, and the vignettes of participation and touch. Veronica della Dora 
(2009: 337) writes: geographers are nothing but storytellers. The geographic engagement with stories 
largely stems from the recent creative turn (see de Leeuw and Hawkins 2017; Eshun and Madge 2016; 
Hawkins 2019; Madge 2014; Marston and de Leeuw 2013). This has promoted a profusion of thinking 
and doing around creative methodologies, within which performative telling has been prominent 
(Lorimer and Parr 2014). Acutely, geography has advanced a telling of small stories (see Lorimer 2003, 
2006; Short and Godfrey 2007; Naylor 2008; Cameron 2012), engaging with the local, the situated, 
the specific, the intimate, the embodied, the mundane, and the particular as it is lived in everyday life. 
Small stories entangle detailed description with the process of making. Emilie Cameron (2012: 574) 
writes: stories express something irreducible particular and personal, and yet they can be received as 
expressions of border social and political context, and their telling can move, affect and produce 
collectives. Storying, then, is both situated and politically transformative. 
The revival of the story, and creative writing broadly, views language as more than (just) 
representational (Parr and Steveson 2014: 566). Manning (2016: 42) has argued new research methods 
are not needed. Rather, we need to re-account what writing can do in the process of thinking-doing  
storying begins to cultivate this re-accounting. Stories are meaningful performances that affectively do 
work. As Deleuze and Guattari (1994: 176) illustrate: the writer twists language, makes it vibrate, seizes 
hold of it and rends it in order to wrest percept from perceptions, the affect from affection, the sensation 
42 All recorded interviews were transcribed. Ten of the interviews were transcribed by an outsourced transcription 
service, whilst I transcribed the remaining interviews. Unrecorded interviews and chance conversation were written 
up as soon as was possible. Following transcription, interviews were coded to inform the emerging analysis. 
Transcripts were coded into broad key themes by hand three times, with there being a total of thirty-two codes. 
from opinion. Geographical storying seeks to induce feeling and affect, generate emotions, play with 
description, and carve differences of potential; it seeks to advance the story as a significant event in 
itself (Lorimer and Parr 2014). Storying breath does not decenter the humanness of an encounter, the 
presence of the body through which breath moves is not removed, but stories are composed from multiple 
bodies and materialites that cannot solely be reduced to the human or representational. The stories 
presented, then, are multilayered, complex, and complicated (Clark 2003; Mann 2014). They are a 
partial, open, and modest telling of relations and encounters without beginning or ending (Wright et al. 
2012) and, so, irreducible to the concept of narrative (Cameron 2011: 5). Stories are voiced by the 
phenomena they seek to tell, as the body is drawn to unknown, speculative places (Rose 2006). This 
creative redefinition continues as stories affect those who read them.  
The small stories told throughout this thesis are always situated. They do, however, move in-between 
imagination and fact (Peterle 2019). Situated in the middle, they voice a more poetic style of prose 
that is open, fluid, colourful, relational, material, and rhythmic. Poetic telling does not immobilise but 
return[s] each living being to its becoming, with a respect for its blossoming (Irigaray 2004b: 34). Rather 
than absolute and totalising knowledge, the incoherence and openness of poetic writing compels the 
imagination, as the reader or listener moves in-between the lines, exploring the many becomings. Poetic 
crafting embodies the openness, fluidity, and ambiguity of tracing as to write poetically is to write with 
a paintbrush, it is not to confine thought to what is black and white but to embrace the swirling colours 
of coherent-incoherence, which can never be held in a mapped stasis.  
To write stories with a paintbrush is to move with a generous telling, wherein the colour of ambiguity and 
partiality is embraced in favour of definiteness, absoluteness, and completeness. The following section 
details the empirical spaces I engaged with as an observing participant. At times, this engagement was 
animated through a volunteering role. The distinction between volunteer and researcher often becomes 
blurred with both informing the other (Goerisch 2017). I sought to be a volunteer who was compassionate, 
caring, respectful, involved, engaged, active, present, and responsive. Embodying this position, which 
was firmly grounded in my methodological approach, fostered a responsibility, loyalty, and attachment 
to the spaces I was participating in; spaces that cared for me whilst I was living in Belfast. This 
responsibility and loyalty, in turn, implicated and informed my evolving position, practice, and ethics as 
a researcher. The telling I voice, then, is formed by the prolonged, reciprocal, evolving, and caring 
relationships with and beyond research spaces and participants (Blazek and Askins forthcoming).  
The stories I tell are voiced with a reciprocating kindness (Zhang 2017: 147). This reciprocal kindness 
moves with generosity and care for the empirical spaces and the bodies and relations active within them. 
Reciprocal kindness creates an ethical strategy mitigating the non-beneficial aspects of research (Blazek 
and Askins forthcoming), as the researcher remains with the tension of multiple allegiances and loyalties 
 to the self, to the space, to academia, to the participants and their lived experience, and to 
responsibility of volunteering (Huisman 2008)  and chooses, with consideration and care, what stories 
to tell and what stories to leave untold. This thesis weaves together situated, open, incomplete, and messy 
stories through a generous, kind, and caring telling that is reciprocal. Although I chose what stories to tell 
and not to tell, both the stories told and the stories left untold are not mine. They are stories belonging 
to every body active in their making and every body continuing this making in the re-reading. This thesis 
is the voicing of stories that continue in reciprocal movement; it is a story with life and vitality but also 
one of care, generosity, and kindness. It is a story that breathes. 
4.4 Empir ica l Spaces 
Whilst Belfast remains highly segregated, throughout the city pockets of sharing can be found. Encounters 
have generally been thought as fleeting, casual, un-designed, momentary, passing, and ephemeral 
chance meetings (Wilson 2017a). Although contested, there is concern a preoccupation with the fleeting 
has overridden the value of the encounter (Amin 2002; Clayton 2009; Matejskova and Leitner 2011; 
Valentine and Sadgrove 2012; Wilson 2017a). Thus, calls for engagements with more sustained forms 
of relation have been voiced (Matejskova and Leitner 2011). Sustained encounters attend to the 
enduring rhythms in a particular public space that are produced and developed via the interactions of 
its users over time, as opposed to its purported serendipitous, ephemeral, and extraordinary nature 
(Teo and Neo 2017: 1108). Spaces of sustained encounter are not engineered through large-scale 
events but created within micro-publics of everyday social contact and encounter, to animate 
purposefully organised group activity (Amin 2002: 959). In spaces of encounter the embodied act of 
breathing animates moments of sharing as the self and other come together to talk, play sport, sing, 
dance, entertain, move, and socialise. Here, peace-making is often felt in the tender and shared 
expressions  and affects  of nurture, love, compassion, friendship, and care (Bregazzi and Jackson 
2018: 86). These peaceful gestures bring together a variety of people, from a broad range of 
backgrounds, in a destabilising emergence of difference and dissensus that ruptures fixed patterns of 
contact and creates new peaceful ways of being in relation (Amin 2002).  
There is a need to engage with spaces of sharing in Northern Ireland and tracing breath, as a vector 
holding relationality and autonomous self-differentiation in tension, can animate this required 
engagement. Some of these spaces are designed and created with the specific aim of cultivating peace 
and creating the momentum for reconciliation. Other, however, are spaces of fun, learning, laughter, 
exercise, wellbeing, friendship and passion before, or even if, they can be considered peaceful spaces; 
it is principally these latter spaces I am most interested in  everyday spaces in which the ordinary can 
be grappled with but not generalised from. It is this interest that led me Turas.  
4.4.1 Empirical Space: Turas Ir ish Language Project  
The Irish language has a long and contentious history on the island of Ireland and, acutely, in Northern 
Ireland. Whilst rarely a root cause of conflict (Laitin 2000), language is often mobilised as a source of 
cultural antagonism that can be both injurious and sustaining to the very presence of the language 
(McMonagle 2010). Cultural antagonism originates not with the communication function of a language, 
but with the capacity for language to act at an essential essence of communal identity and, in turn, group 
belonging. In spaces of ethno-national violence language is employed as a secular symbol of nationalism 
(Pritchard 2004), which remains active even when the language is not, or no longer, widely used in 
everyday communication (Edwards 1985: 110). The history of colonialism and Anglicisation, alongside 
a modern nationalist political and cultural narrative, has imbued the Irish language with acute symbolic 
significance that has been employed by both sides of the community to insight cultural antagonism 
(Mitchell and Miller 2019). A capacity that remains within the language today.  
Prior to Ireland being claimed by the English Crown under the Act of Union 1801, the Irish language was 
the main vernacular of the island of Ireland. Under a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
a process of centralisation ensued (McMonagle 2010). The dominance of English as the elite language 
of commerce, politics, administration and modernity and the tongue of convenience and opportunity 
prompted a rapid decline of Gaelic across Ireland, as the value of the language diminished. Gaelic was 
soon labelled as backwards and became closely associated with poverty and struggle (Pritchard 
2004: 64). The dualistic characterisation of the two languages was internalised by many Irish speakers 
who, conscious of the need for their children to learn English due to the opportunities it afforded, soon 
abandoned the Irish language. English prevailed with only secluded pockets of Irish speaking areas, 
known as Gaeltacht, mapped across of the island of Ireland. The Gaeltacht developed their own 
dialectical variants of Gaelic and, by the twentieth century, there were three major Irish language 
dialects that persist in their differences today: Ulster Irish spoken in County Donegal and Northern 
Ireland; Munster Irish found in County Kerry on the south west coast of Ireland and predominantly within 
the Dingle Peninsula; and Connaught Irish located predominantly in County Galway and County Mayo, 
also on the west coast.  
With the success of Irish independence in 1922, a radical divergence towards the language emerged. 
The newly created Irish Free State maintained an ideological dedication to the language (McMonagle 
and McDermott 2014). Alongside a compulsory role in education (McMonagle 2010) and a requirement 
for working in the civil service (Mitchell and Miller 2019). Irish was established as the national and first 
official language of this new nation, which further cemented the historical narrative tying the language 
to the desire for, and achievement of, ending British rule. The English language was recognised as the 
second official language and most government business continued to be conducted in English.  
While the south of Ireland renewed their commitment to the Irish language, in the newly created, 
Protestant-dominated, pro-British state of Northern Ireland the Irish language became lingua non-grata 
(McMonagle and McDermott 2014). Britishness was institutionalised across the six counties of the North 
and the Irish language became firmly associated with the foreign Republic and Catholic minority, who 
were regarded as subversive and disloyal. In the North, the Irish language was not granted official 
recognition or support. It was banned in the Stormont parliament, from road signs, and from broadcasts 
(Mitchell and Miller 2019: 240). Today, the Irish language constitutes the lesser-used language in both 
the Republic and Northern Ireland but, as a strong marker of national identity, its status in Northern 
Ireland remains highly contentious (McMonagle and McDermott 2014). 
Current perceptions of the Irish language in the North are largely framed through the Troubles. After 
partition, a grassroots activism maintained the presence of Irish language in the North which, following 
the beginning of the Troubles, was invigorated as culture and heritage became viewed as political 
capital. Within the first decade of the Troubles, the Irish language seemed to be in serious decline. Then, 
in HM Prison Maze (formerly Long Kesh Detention centre) a group of Republican prisoners, led by the 
infamous Bobby Sands who had been elected Officer Commanding of the Provisional IRA prisoners, 
embarked upon high-profile hunger strikes in October 1980 that continued into 1981 (Pritchard 2004). 
These prisoners, as a matter of policy, conversed in Irish, a phenomenon that became known as Jailtacht.  
During the Troubles, Sinn Fin and the IRA invigorated the Irish language as cultural capital and mobilised 
it as a loaded weapon. Nationalists and Republicans viewed speaking as Gaelige as a political act, 
contributing to the quest of ending foreign rule in Ireland: ...it is our contention that each individual who 
masters the learning of the Irish language has made an important personal contribution towards the re-
conquest of Ireland (Sinn Fin 1984: 2). The learning of Irish became inculcated as a political act 
alongside the claim that as the Irish influences rises, foreign influence decreases (Pritchard 2004: 75). 
In 1984, Sinn Fin stated: 
what we are aiming at[is] the recovery of our own roots and the ending of the feeling of 
alienation produced by having in our mouth the language imposed on us by imperialism (Sinn Fin 
1984: 6).  
Mobilising the Irish language within their combined military and electoral strategy, Republicans explicitly 
modelled their cause on Irish cultural nationalismand the discourse of decolonisation (Nic Craith 2003: 
79, see also OReilly 1999). The mobilisation of Irishness among the Republican movement  epitomised 
in their fervent use of the Irish language  was viewed with suspicion from the Protestant community. It 
was believed the act of embedding Irishness in Northern Ireland and within its people would lead to 
increased support for a united Ireland, as those who spoke the language would soon come to feel and 
be Irish.  
Irelands struggle for independence, accompanied by an increasing and prevailing sectarianism, acutely 
and unambiguously entwined Gaelic with Irish nationalism and Catholicism which, in turn, entrenched 
Unionist opposition to the language (McMonagle and Mc Dermott 2014). The Irish language became a 
synonymous symbolic marker of Irish national identity preserved exclusively for the Catholic natives. 43,44 
For many Protestants, the association of the language with their political opponents served to inculcate 
the language as both alien and threatening to their way of life (Mitchell and Miller 2019; Pritchard 
2004). Sarah McMonagle and Philip McDermott (2014: 248) articulate:  
a binary of blame has arisen where republicans blame the British state for the demise of the 
language in the first place, while unionists point to the active promotion by republicans of Irish in a 
politicized manner that is seemingly hostile to the existence of the Northern Ireland state. 
The impetus for the revival of the Irish language was largely political. Yet, the momentum for the revival 
was located within the Catholic working-class district of west Belfast. This district was homogeneous in 
terms of religious affiliation and political outlook: nearly all its residents were Nationalist and, although 
divided between constitutional Nationalist and militant Republicans, it was the latter who had an acute 
presence in the area (McCoy 1997).  
Today, the presence of the Irish language continues to be overwhelmingly confined to Catholic territory. 
Catholic west Belfast is home to the Gaeltacht Quarter or An Cheathr Ghaeltachta. The Gaeltacht 
Quarter aims to promote the Irish language and Irish culture. It is home to many Irish-medium institutions 
and hosts a variety of Irish cultural festivals throughout the year. Most businesses in the area have Irish 
language or bilingual signage and all street names are displayed in Irish. In addition, Belfasts only Irish 
radio station, Raidi Filte (Welcome Radio), resides in west Belfast. With the Irish language firmly 
embedded in west Belfast and inherited narratives continuing to voice the Irish language as a Republican 
language, in the post-conflict period the Protestant community remains geographically, culturally, and 
ideologically alienated from Gaelic, or at least that was the case until Turas opened in 2012.  
In 2012 an Irish language project was set up at East Belfast Mission in the Skainos Centre, in Protestant 
east Belfast. East Belfast Mission is a charity organisation affiliated with the Methodist Christ of Ireland 
Church that works with the east Belfast community to assist in its renewal and regeneration (East Belfast 
Mission n.d.). Turas, meaning journey or pilgrimage in Irish Gaelic, is the only known Irish language project 
based in a traditionally Unionist area aiming to engage and provide an education in Gaelige (Ulster 
dialect) to learners from a Protestant background. In the Skainos Centre, Turas comprises of an office, 
storage room, and two classrooms on the second floor of the building. In 2017 Turas employed two 
members of staff full time, one member of staff part time, and six teachers on an hourly basis. It also 
43 Irish language interpellations tied religion, nationality and language into a single identity: Sasanach is a term 
referring to both an Englishman and an Anglican; the term Albanach refers simultaneously to a Scottish person and 
a Presbyterian; a Gall was at once a foreigner, an English speaker, and a Protestant; and to use the word Gael 
was to speak concurrently of a Catholic, an Irish speaker, or an Irishman/woman (McCoy 1997). 
44 Despite Unionists complete rejection of the language, there are close historic links between Protestantism and the 
Irish language. Gordon McCoy (1997) outlines three primary areas of Protestant engagement with the Irish 
language: proselytism, antiquarianism, and romantic revivalism. These three arenas, however, were underpinned 
by a rhetoric anglicising or neutralising the history and roots of Gaelic and, relatedly, often worked within a 
continuing colonial framework. Consequently, Protestant engagement with the language has tended to enforce the 
nationalist discourse (see McCoy 1997; McMonagle 2010) and, in turn, fuel Unionist suspicion and fear of Gaelic. 
has the support of several volunteers throughout the week, with some volunteers helping daily and being 
integral to the successful running of Turas.  
In the academic year 2017/18 Turas offered twelve Irish language classes a week. The Irish language 
classes range across all levels, from total beginners to advanced classes, whist also offering conversation 
classes, a family class, a reading class, and an exam class (see figure 7). In addition, Turas runs a tin 
whistle class, a childrens Irish dancing class, a set dancing class for adults, an Irish language choir and, 
from September 2018, a Welsh language class and an Irish yoga class. Whilst the language classes are 
free, asking simply for a suggested donation of 1.00 per class, the dancing and musical classes range 
from 3.00-4.00 per session. Throughout the year there is a traditional music session on the second 
Friday of every month, and periodic talks and workshops exploring the historic links between Protestants 
and the Irish language, and the relevance of the Irish language in present day Northern Ireland. In 
addition to internally organised talks, Turas often invites external speakers, hosts public discussion on 
issues of identity and language, and holds one-off events including organised walks, intensive Irish 
language days, and theatre and music performances. Every year Turas takes part in East Belfast 
Missions annual celebration for Burns Night and Belfasts St. Patricks Day Parade. Furthermore, Turas 
organises trips for its learners to west Belfast and to the Gaeltacht areas in Donegal and Kerry.  
 Figure. 7. The range of Irish language classes ran by Turas 2016/17 (personal communication). 
As of April 2017, the total number of learners Turas had registered for a language class was 173. Of 
the 173 learners, 46% (111 learners) came from a Protestant background, 32% (56 learners) from a 
Catholic background, and 3% (6 learners) were identified as other. 46% of the learners reside in East 
Belfast where the Skainos Centre is located, 26% (46 learners) lived in the rest of Belfast, whilst 28% 
(48 learners) came from outside of Belfast. Of the 173 learners, 40% (70 learners) were male and 
60% (103 learners) were female. For the academic year 2016-2017 a total of 519 language classes 
were offered, with an average class size of 8.19. The size of the language classes tends to depend on 
the level, with the beginners classes being larger than the more advanced classes. For the academic 
year 2018-2019, thirty-nine new learners attended the evening beginners class and thirty attended the 
beginners morning class. The number of those attending tends to ebb and flow throughout the year, with 
the summer term tending to reflect a fall in attendance. 
Whilst in Belfast I attended two Irish language classes a week. Both the classes I attended were total 
beginners classes, with one being on a Monday from 10am to midday and the other on a Tuesday 
evening from 7pm-9pm. I also attended the weekly choir practice, which ran on a Tuesday evening from 
6pm-7pm. I joined the two classes a third of the way through the academic year, at the beginning of 
2017. Although this did result in me being slightly behind and missing some of the basics, it was common 
for new people to join throughout the year. As the Monday class was during the day, most of the learners 
tended to be retired. The Tuesday evening class, in contrast, tended to attract people who were still 
working with most learners being middle aged. Both classes took place in the bigger of the two 
classrooms, with the singing class taking place in the office. The classes I attended were taught by 
different minteoir (teachers). The Monday morning teacher was brought up in a Protestant area and 
now lived in east Belfast, whilst the Tuesday night teacher was from a well-known Republican family 
and, thus, had territorial roots firmly grounded in west Belfast. The two teachers had different teaching 
styles. The Monday morning class tended to be very methodical. We would often begin the two-hour 
class recapping the vocabulary we had learnt the previous week, before being presented a series of 
handouts that would map the trajectory of this weeks lesson. Thus, we were often visibly presented with 
the Gaelige (Irish) and Barla (English), with there being a considerable amount of emphasis on written 
Gaelic, particularly as the year progressed. In contrast, the Tuesday evening class focused on rote 
learning and the class tended to be based around verbal repetition, with very little attention given to 
the written word. With the new 2017-2018 academic year, I stopped attending the Tuesday night class. 
Most of the learners who had been attending this class moved into the intermediate class and a new 
beginners class started. Instead of moving into the intermediate class, I was asked to help with the family 
class on a Wednesday and stay around on a Wednesday evening to prepare the tea and coffee for 
the sos (break) and lock up after the advanced evening class.  
The family class, which ran from 4.30pm-5.30pm, was a class that allowed parents and children to learn 
Irish together. On average there would be six families attending. Each family had one adult and from 
one to three children. Whilst most families tended to be a mother and children, there was one father who 
attended with his three children, two grandmothers who brought their granddaughters, and one mother 
brought her daughter and two of her daughters friends. Some of the adults attending were fluent in 
Irish and/or attended adult classes at Turas, while others were completely new to the language. The 
family class was taught by a young lady and the approach was grounded in rote learning, with a large 
emphasis on the spoken word learnt through song and games such as Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes 
and Simon Says. At times, arts and crafts would also be incorporated into the family class. 
Halfway through a two-hour language class there would be sos, where the class would break for tea 
and coffee (juice and hot chocolate for the family class) and biscuits. The Monday morning class and 
family class tended to have sos in the room where the class was taking place. On Tuesday evenings, tea 
and biscuits would be in the corridor between the two classrooms, allowing the beginners class to mix 
with the concurrent intermediate class. Depending on the class, sos tended to last between fifteen minutes 
and half an hour. This time provided an opportunity for learners to get to know each other and to ask 
any questions they had which had not been addressed in the lesson. At the end of each class a bag 
would be placed at the front of the class, for people to donate if they wished.  
In addition to attending language classes, I also volunteered one day a week with Turas. As a volunteer, 
I was responsible for several different tasks including preparing tea and coffee for the language classes, 
helping out in the family class, collating information on learners and class statistics, assisting with funding 
applications, designing posters for the two classrooms, and helping organise the various one-off events. 
Over the course of the year that I was in Belfast, I attended several of the talks Turas organised, assisted 
with the one-day intensive language course, paraded with Turas in the St. Patricks Day Parade (see 
figure 8), participated in a panel arranged for a local youth group discussing Turas and the Irish 
Language Act, and sang with the Turas Choir at several internal and external events, including at the 
East Belfast Missions Burns Night.  
My ethnographic engagement with Turas was supported by sixteen in-depth, unstructured interviews. A 
call for interview participants was sent out to all members of Turas via email and the interviews were 
conducted over the course of six months. Most of the interviews took place in one of the classrooms at 
Turas or in the community caf in the Skainos building, generally prior to or after a language class. 
However, two of the interviews took place in coffee shops in different parts of Belfast, and one in the 
workplace of the participant. The interviews ranged in length, with the shortest being an hour and the 
longest closer to two and a half hours. All the interviews, except one, were recorded and two of the 
participants, a married couple, were interviewed together. Three of the interview participants were 
employed members of Turas, and several the other interviewees volunteered at Turas in addition to 
taking classes. Participants ranged from very new learners, who had only been attending classes for a 
few weeks, to advanced learners who would be considered as fluent. Thus, the participants attended the 
range of different language classes offered by Turas. Six of the interview participants were male. All 
the participants were from Northern Ireland, bar one participant who was from Donegal and one 
participant who was from Dublin. Whilst there were three younger participants (in their thirties), the rest 
of the participants were over fifty-five years of age. Due to the unstructured nature of the interviews a 
range of topics were covered. Thus, some interviews were closely focused on the Irish language and 
Turas, whereas others used Turas as an entry point to discuss their experience of the wider context of 
Northern Ireland. These latter interviews much more closely resembled a life history interview and were 
acutely framed by the Troubles and its legacy. However, in general, most interviews discussed the 
experience of learning Irish, including the space of Turas and how they had first come to attend the 
classes offered, the impact of engaging with the Irish language, and the Irish language in a boarder 
context. In addition to the interviews with learners engaged in the Turas project, I interviewed an ex-
Republican Irish language activist who is a member of the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and 
Tradition. This man was a former Republic prisoner jailed in Long Kesh. He learnt Gaelic in Jail and, 
today, is a prominent local community activist and spokesperson for the Bogside, in his home city Derry.

4.4.2 Empirical Space: The Centre for Troubles Studies* 
Prior to moving to Belfast, I contacted the Centre for Troubles Studies (CTS*) after having come across 
them through desk-based research looking into the voluntary and community sector. The CTS* is an 
independent, not for profit organisation working on and around issues relating to conflict, human rights, 
social transformation, and social justice. Originating in 1996, the majority of the CTS*s work falls into 
six categories: art of conflict transformation, research, training, community development, mediation, and 
internal peace work. The CTS* also provides advice, support, and assistance to students and independent 
researchers visiting Northern Ireland and, aware of this, I contacted their director and first met with him 
in June 2016. During our meeting, I expressed my desire to have a space in Belfast to work from and it 
was agreed I could have a desk three days a week in the CTS* office. Before long, first as an unpaid 
intern and then as a research assistant, I was involved in a significant part of the work carried out by the 
CTS*. 
The CTS*s conflict transformation work tends to be directed towards community-based womens groups 
located across Belfast and further afield.45 The womens groups recruited for peacebuilding work vary, 
with some groups being very well established and others being very new. Therefore, the level of 
organisation and previous involvement in the community-voluntary sector differs from group to group. 
Womens groups embark on a designated programme or on an amalgamation of programmes, usually 
dependent upon the stream and source of funding under which the programme is run. A large proportion 
of the CTS*s peacebuilding work centres around cross-community contact, which it constructs in two ways. 
First, by bringing together groups aligning to different sides of Northern Irelands two opposing 
communities in joint up activities and programmes (Cochrane and Dunn 2002). Secondly, spaces of 
contact are constructed by crossing territorial and cultural boundaries. This brings groups into areas and 
into contact with cultures traditionally regarded as belonging to the other. The latter moves beyond 
physical face-to-face contact and brings the other into a close encounter without the other being tangibly 
present or completely visible (Wilson 2017a).  The CTS*s peacebuilding work has drawn funding from 
several different bodies including the European Unions PEACE programme, the National Lottery, the 
Northern Ireland Executive, Co-operation Ireland, the Ards and North Down Borough Council, the 
Community Relations Council, Belfast City Council, and the Victims and Survivors Service.  
A large proportion of the work the CTS* were engaged in during 2017 was funded through Co-
operation Ireland. Established in 1979 as Co-operation North, Co-operation Ireland is an all-island 
peacebuilding charity working to encourage and promote interaction, dialogue and practical 
45 On the 31st October 2000, almost a century of feminist peace activity and scholarship was recognised in the 
unanimous adoption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1325, which signalled an 
unprecedented international recognition of gender issues and support for local womens peacebuilding roles 
(Hammond-Callaghan 2010: Jarman 2016). With international recognition of the unique capacity of women to 
contribute to reconciliation and conflict transformation from their position of family carers and civil activists (Porter 
2003), womens groups quickly became a legitimate and productive space for cultivating peace and attracting 
funding. 
collaboration within Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (Co-
operation Ireland n.d.). Co-operation (2017: 3) Ireland run a programme called the Circle of Learning. 
The Circle of Learning Programme is a networking and capacity building programme which aims to 
impact learning and build confidence in marginalised communities across Northern Ireland in order 
to increase a sense of belonging and encourage places and spaces that are safe for all. 
The programme consisted of four hubs across Northern Ireland and the CTS* were brought on-board as 
the host organisation for the Belfast hub. The hub brought together four different womens groups, all 
facing continuing challenges relating to the legacy of the conflict, from across and just outside of Belfast. 
Involvement for two of the groups centred upon separate strategic planning residential weekends. The 
other two groups embarked on a more prolonged programme drawing on one of the CTS*s training 
packages, which I had a direct hand in facilitating.  
The CTS*s peacebuilding work is principally run through a range of internally developed training 
packages, developed in response to the vision of peace and peacebuilding as conceived in the 
Executives TBUC strategy. The training package in question focusses on resilience. Through holistic 
techniques and the arts, participants explore and develop personal, often embodied, tools of self-care 
and their own potential for change. The programme seeks:  
to build capacity and confidence by helping participants to notice their own spheres of influence, 
how they build resilience, identify positive networks and understand good decision making to aid 
their coming to term with the legacy of the past and to build a more positive future (personal 
communication). 
Elements of the training package were incorporated into a specifically designed, unique programme 
that met the objectives of Co-operation Irelands Circle of Learning Programme. The holistic resilience 
component of the programme consisted of a wellbeing workshop run by an external wellbeing company, 
and the arts-based component was a silk painting workshop in which the women designed and painted 
a silk banner around the theme of womanhood and sisterhood (see figure 9).  
In addition to the work with Co-operation Ireland, I also facilitated elements of a training package that 
directly sought to deal with the legacies of the Troubles. The programme, once again developed by the 
CTS*, runs as either a 32-hour, 48-hour, or 96-hour programme focussed upon addressing the legacies 
of Northern Irelands troubled past and creating shared communities through individual, community, and 
societal changes. The training programme is OCN accredited, meaning although the programme is 
designed and owned by the CTS*, it is accredited by a nationally recognised, external awarding 
organisation, which ratifies the high standard of the training (OCN NI 2019). The programme aims to 
dispel sectarian myths and provide spaces for critical discussion on both a single identity and cross-
community basis about a range of issues including sectarianism, segregation, faith, and ethno-national 
division. It entails site visits to both public and private historical and cultural spaces (see figure 10), which 
are drawn together in a series of classroom sessions, where participants work through several different 
exercises designed to stimulate dialogue around the legacies of the past, the manifestation of these  
legacies today, and the possible means by which these legacies can be addressed. At the end of the 
training programme, and after assessing the accompanying work booklet, the participants are awarded 
an OCN NI Endorsed Course Certificate that recognises their achievement in completing the course.

Figure. 10. A site visit as part of the CTS*s training package addressing the legacies of the Troubles, wherein the 
ladies visited Crumlin Road Jail in north Belfast on a bitterly cold winters day (authors own, 2nd February 2017). 
The CTS* is a small team. In 2017, the CTS* employed six full-time members of staff engaged in work 
across the breadth of the organisation, in addition to the director and the administration manager who 
both worked on a part-time basis. The CTS*s peacebuilding work is primarily designed, organised, and 
facilitated by Jasmine and Lauren.46 Together Jasmine and Lauren devise the CTS*s peacebuilding 
training programmes and seek funding to run them. Lauren often oversees the day-to-day logistical 
organisation of the programmes, but generally both Jasmine and Lauren are active in delivering the 
programmes. It was, thus, Jasmine and Lauren I worked most closely with.  
In addition to facilitating more prolonged training programmes, I assisted with the running of one-off 
events including an International Womens Day brunch (see figure 11), an evening with the Ulster 
Orchestra, and an outreach visit around the Synagogue in Belfast (see figure 12), a trip to Rita Duffys 
Soften the Border installation in Belcoo, Fermanagh (see figure 13). As part of the Back to the Future 
training programme, I curated a portrait exhibition exploring a sense of place along the Ards Peninsula 
(see figure 14), which was exhibited as part of the John Hewitt Summer School 2017. The CTS* were 
involved in a re-imaging project, which sought to work with residents and a local artist to redesign 
offensive murals, and I ran one of the relating consultation sessions. Working with the CTS* provided 
invaluable exposure into the everyday activities of peacebuilding work in the community and voluntary 
sector, whilst also providing a space for meeting women involved in this conflict transformation and 
reconciliation work. 
46 Jasmine offered to put me in touch with the Northern Ireland Executives Director of Good Relations, who kindly 
agreed to be interviewed. In addition, through Jasmine, I met with an active member of the Orange Order, who 
conducts private tours around the north Belfast Orange Hall for the CTS*. I had a quick tour of the Orange Hall 
and then the interview took place. It was Jasmine who also put me in contact with the Irish language activist.

Respite: Tracing the Movement of Breath 
You are always there and, although I often do not notice, you are forever touching upon my body. 
Unremembered, forgotten, invisible. Yet always felt. You move in and out, from the internal to the external 
and back again. Over and over; in and out, out and in. You defy boundaries and diffuse partitions. A 
movement tending towards the cheery tree, advancing a wondrous call. An invisible air swirling, spiralling, 
and pirouetting in the void in-between bodies and worlds. You are the weaving of relations. You fold in-
between and attunement to the present; to this present relation. An amplification. 
You are the birth of openness and of discovery. An interruption, a pause, and a gasp that calls habit into 
question. You are making of a new story unheard in noise. You are active-passivity, gifting an attentive 
responsiveness and awareness. The becoming of an intimate letting-be. An unseen quietness caressing the 
flesh, and one that has no name. You are the welcoming of the night, of mystery, and enchantment. The 
movement of wonder and the wonder of movement.  
You are the becoming of a reciprocity flowing in both directions. You withdraw inwards; a pulling back, a 
return that never extends too far. You cannot settle. A soaring, airborne, stillness with wings of flight. You 
defy stasis. A living rhythm and beat continuing in both rest and movement. You are excessive. 
Uncontained. Beyond confinement. But shared in your care for limits. You always return, even if you return 
to an interiority that is always different. I feel you in my expansion, my blossoming, my flourishing: 
kissing, caressing, washing over, and wrapping around flesh. You are my movement; you are the 
undermined shaping, spacing, and direction of living. 
We are dependent upon you. You are life and your absence is death.  
You are breath breathing breath. 
Breathing Movement 
5.1. Introduct ion 
Contemporary Northern Ireland is a highly divided society. Bodies continue to be enveloped by either 
a Protestant or a Catholic world. This enveloping provides the body with normative significance (Appiah 
2018), wherein the body, propelled by an unconscious desire for belonging, gains a reason for aligning 
to the normal orientation of its territorial rooting. Sara Ahmed (2006: 1) develops the concept of 
orientation to refer to how bodies reside in space. Orientations do not, however, only shape how we 
inhabit space, but how we apprehend this world of shared [communal] inhabitance, as well as who or 
what we direct our energy and attention towards (Ahmed 2006: 3). Orientations are not autonomous 
but communal; they are the product of territorial dwelling.  
The body enveloped by a Protestant world inherits a communal Protestant line of orientation, while the 
body enveloped by a Catholic world inherits a collective Catholic line of orientation. Inherited lines of 
orientation determine what is and what is not available to the body (Ahmed 2006). The Protestant line 
of orientation contains objects  and objects, in this context, extend far beyond material things to also 
include non-material characteristics, performances, perceptions, relations, and habits  pre-scripted as 
Protestant, with the Catholic line of orientation contains objects pre-determined as Catholic. What is 
available from the Protestant line of orientation and what is available from the Catholic line of 
orientation, exist in a binary relation of oppositional difference. Orientations to pre-scripted 
performances give name to the political identity being performed, whilst the name of the politically 
represented identity orientates the performance. The objects, experiences, performances, habits, 
perceptions, and relations available to the body ensure it is recognisable from within the dominant social 
order of Catholic or Protestant.  
The interplay between divided territorial orientations and binary identity politics prevents encounters. 
Bodies are not encountered but known through their collective orientation that, via the workings of 
projective identification, is the reduction of a living body to a static object. Projective identification in 
contemporary Northern Ireland orientates bodies to the normative via inherited truths and narrative 
stereotypes. Irigaray (2008) advances the term standardisation from below to refer to the stable, 
eternal process by which commonly held truths are passed on to new generations. Inherited truths work 
in tandem with Northern Irelands geographical partitions to reproduce past histories of association, in 
which the cause of our communitys suffering is projected on to the communal other, who together we 
recognise a priori as threatening, hated, and immoral (Coulter 1999).  
The Irish language is synonymous with the Catholic population and a Nationalist politics. Projected onto 
the orientation of the other, the Irish language is viewed as threatening, unavailable object to those 
enveloped by a Protestant world. These bodies view the language with hatred and fear. The Irish 
language, thus, loses its mystery and the curiosity of its appeal, as it is reduced to an object of our 
knowledge and our sight [which] amounts to removing it from what it really is (Irigaray 2017: 67). The 
very materiality of the language and the other to whom it belongs  whether in body, movement, 
exchange, etc.  is appropriated, in a gesture of externalised incorporation that reduces the movements 
of difference to a stable and permanent sameness. The destruction of the moving, sensing body, however, 
extends far beyond the witnessed body to also encompass the witnessing body. 
Normative orientations not only habituate performance and action but also perception. Discussing the 
novel bodys desire for belonging, Irigaray (2017: 63-64) writes: 
It is so much so that, even at the level of perception, the child will be induced to recognise what it 
perceives  for example what it sees  instead of being initiated into perceiving by itself A filter 
of precomprehension thus precedes its approach to the real. And this paralyses its energy, 
especially its sensitive energy, through an a priori perception presumed to be common, through a 
moulding which is considered necessary but cuts it off from its source of life and puts it into an 
artificial ecstasy through an imposed communion with the world, with the other, and firstly, with itself.   
Wrest of its incipience, relation as mere recognition is the very destruction of the moving, sensing body 
as its perception orientates to pre-existing communal lines of direction. In recognition, the air folding in-
between and constituting they bodys vitality becomes passive and unregistered, breathed without 
engagement, wonder, or encounter. Although this atmosphere and the habits it induces may affect the 
body with a sense of comfort, there is a need to be suspicious of such a culture because, via an internal 
desire for belonging and safety, the body is numbed, more than often unconsciously, into an affective 
embrace of stability and permanence (Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos 2016: 151). This embrace is present 
before the very body it constructs and, thus, the static and permanent body it engineers is always-
already known in advance of its very becoming. The body is stripped of its potential to move and 
blossom in its own, autonomous existence. Habitually orientated to recognise what it perceives, rather 
than perceiving, that is to say, making by oneself in relation, the self becomes defined in restriction rather 
than incipient possibility. 
Standardisation from below is the very refusal of difference, movement, and possibility. It sustains the 
self and other upon a horizon of sameness, a horizon in which peace has always-already failed. Irigaray, 
however, suggests a bodys inherited horizon can be transformed and opened through encounters of 
differentiation in proximity. The potentiality of the encounter resides in its capacity to challenge the 
truths of the bodys enveloping worlds. This challenge risks normative orientation as the body begins to 
move in and through space differently and, thus, opens an emerging possibility for peace, as relations 
in-between the self and other are transformed from stasis to movement. Yet, how does sociality move 
from stasis to movement, from normative orientation to queer orientation, from recognition to 
perception? It is this question that we grapple with in this chapter.  
The aims of this chapter are twofold. The chapter, first, seeks to understand in more detail the 
contemporary stasis of Northern Ireland, by describing how Turas is recognised as a deviant space 
transgressing and threatening the territorial and ideological boundaries and orientations upon which 
Northern Ireland is built. The territorial nature of Northern Ireland has been widely researched. Yet, 
there are few examinations that seek in interrogate the territorial stasis through the workings of inherited 
truths and the process of standardisation, and their manifestation in normative orientation, within the 
post-conflict era. Second, I consider curiosity and the movement of desire, to think how bodies animate 
movements deviating from inherited, predetermined lines of direction to encounter the usually 
unavailable Irish language. Here, I engage directly with Erin Mannings (2007) conceptualisation of 
desire which she determines as the desire for movement. Whilst enveloping worlds apprehend habits, 
performance, representation, recognition, perception, and affects, they cannot capture and domesticate 
nor root desire to a static, normative orientation. Desire, for Manning (2007: 36), is a point of 
indistinction, an intransigent momentary reaching toward that is in excess of both violence and the law, 
even while it potentially reconstitutes them. The movement of desire directly challenges the stasis of 
contemporary Northern Ireland and opens onto the potential for peaceful relations. The theoretical 
folding in-between Irigarays philosophy, Ahmeds thinking around orientation, and Mannings 
conceptualisation of desire is empirically situated in the words and movements of the bodies attending 
Turas. In meeting the two aims, I hope to demonstrate how encounters of relations of differentiation in 
proximity materialise in a space as divided as Northern Ireland. I consider this movement a necessary 
precursor to considering what happens in spaces of encounter.  
5.2 Recognising Ir ish from a Protestant dwell ing 
By now the Newtownards Road, in the heart of the east Belfast, is a place I am familiar with. Four times a 
week, I leave the city centre via the Queens Bridge and walk along the Newtownards Road as I go to and 
from the Skainos Centre. Navigating the large triangular junction leading to the Newtownards Road and 
briefly skirting the gated enclave of Catholic Short Strand, I am once again, and every time, hit with a 
slight unease. Engraved into the background and looming tall to cast a dark shadow over their territory 
below, are Harland and Wolffs Samson and Goliath. Men in balaclavas supporting guns stare down from 
the painted walls as they pick out a target. The mark of the letters U, V, and F are visibly branded into the 
bricks and mortar that bind the east together. I walk alongside abandoned shops boarded shut with scenes 
depicting the faded colour of the activity that was once alive. Blood red poppies draw in your gaze and 
the Red Hand of Ulster glows proudly.  
The Skainos building soon comes into sight  the living green wall standing out among the sea of gloomy, 
grey concrete. I take the cue to turn right, walk through the entrance into a fluorescently lit building and 
hurry up the three flights of steps conscious of the time. I am given a few moments at the top of the stairs 
to catch my breath. Breathing deeply, I ring the doorbell. Footsteps can be heard approaching, with a 
smile and a friendly call of maidin mhaith, the door opens onto a different world and I move across the 
threshold.  
My eyes and ears are touched by different sounds and a contrasting view to the red, blue, and white of 
the Newtownards Road. Walking along the corridor, I pass by a big notice board peppered with different 
A4 sheets advertising the variety of classes on offer and the up and coming events: menrang comhr on 
Thursdays, 7-9pm; Irish dancing classes; Hag, Witches and Wise Women a talk by Rsie N Bhaoill; tin 
whistle classes; ar dol 12.00; Turn Down the Lamps traditional Irish music sessions every 2nd Friday of 
the month. I turn left into the office and I am met with the usual hive of activity. Different voices call out 
maidin mhaith, dia duit, and cad  mar at t?, as heads are quickly pulled from the activity 
occupying their attention. Mirroring the outside, the wall to the right displays a painted mural featuring 
Samson and Goliath intertwined with a map of east Belfast but the names are different, the letters coming 
together in a novel manner, with accents hanging over some of the letters. Celtic knots catch the eye. The 
words cad mle filte woven in gold stand on top of the filing cabinet alongside a stack of books: Bnn 
Linn; Ar ais Aris; Go n-ir Leat Cuid a D. An artistic impression of Conn ONeill is spread over the 
larger table, bodies are warmed from mugs stamped with cupn caife, and a stack of hand-crafted 
bodhrn sit in the corner, with their colourful ribbons trailing along the floor. A roller banner stands tall 
with the call begin your journey with the Irish language. 
Research Journal, September 11th 2017 
Dwelling is largely constructed through the binary of here and there. The composition of here, in this 
context the bordered space of east Belfast, has been constructed in opposition to there, to the 
geographically defined territory of west Belfast. Whilst east Belfast in vehemently marked as Protestant, 
British, Loyalist and Unionist, west Belfast in direct contrast is defined as Catholic, Irish, Republican, and 
Nationalist. Bodies rooted in east Belfast are enveloped by a Protestant world, in contrast to the Catholic 
enveloping of bodies rooted to west Belfast. Linda Ervine was born on the Newtownards Road and while 
her family politics were not Unionist, her everyday life was firmly enveloped by a Protestant world. 
I suppose it was in some ways a very typical working class Protestant background and in other ways 
very untypical, umm, you know and I suppose there was conflict because, you know, for me there was 
that family politics but then I did the normal, went to the baths,47 you know, built the bonfire,48 loved 
the 12th,  you know, but didn't understand the meaning behind it. It was just something that you did, it 
47 Linda, here, is referring to Templemore Bath in east Belfast. The Baths were built in the Victorian era and provided 
a space where children played, and families socialised during the Troubles. 
48 The 12th of July is a Protestant celebration and, on the 11th night, huge wooden bonfires are lit in Protest 
communities across Northern Ireland. In the weeks leading up to the 11th, communities collect wood and together 
sculpt the increasingly large structures, which are often decorated with images of the Pope and the tricolour to also 
be engulfed in the burning. Frank, a member of the Orange Order, explained the reasoning behind the bonfires: 
The 11th is a difficult one for Protestants to articulate because not everybody knows what it is about themselves. There 
are lots of different aspects to the fire. The fire history can be from the beacons that were lit when Williams victory 
was won at the Battle of the Boyne, you see beacons were lit up and down Ireland. They also talk about the fire that 
was lit by Martin Luther five hundred years of the reformation, and they talk about the campfires lit before battle [to 
help Williamite ships navigate through Belfast Lough in the dark night].  
was just something that you were part of...and I was just starting to learn to be sectarian, starting to 
learn the songs in school, you know, I was kind of P7, first year, and you're starting to pick up all that 
nonsense. 
Lindas Protestant orientation puts certain objects within her reach. Sara Ahmed (2006: 86) writes: we 
inherit the nearness of certain objects more than others, which means we inherit ways on inhabiting and 
extending into space. As Lindas body became spoken by her east Belfast rooting (Wise 2014), her 
everyday life was directed  largely unconsciously  to a Protestant orientation: it was just something 
that you did, it was just something that you were part of. Linda inherited a nearness to Templemore Baths, 
an intimate affinity for the excitement of constructing and setting alight the burning bonfires of 11th night, 
and an immediate love of the celebrations of the 12th. At school sectarian songs, such as The Sash,49 
were available objects, alongside the flutes and drums of the marching bands, and the red, white and 
blue of the Union Jack. A protestant orientation directs the body towards a fondness for the British 
monarchy, an unwavering support for the DUP, and a disposition favouring the colour orange. The 
bordered parameters of the bodys reachability animate a nearness and proximity to what is already 
here, whilst the objects inhabiting there  such as the Gaelic Athletics Association (GAA) and Gaelic 
games,50 Irish dancing, traditional Irish music and, most notably considering the current political climate 
49 The Sash, also known as The Sash My Father Wore, is widely regarded as one of the most provocative sectarian 
songs (Cooper 2001). It directly commemorates the victory of King William III in the Williamite War in Ireland 
(1690-1691) and evokes a world in which loyalists heroically triumph over the forces of Catholicism: King James 
and his Catholic army, the republican-deified hunger striker Bobby Sands, the IRA, or Gerry Adams and Sinn Fin 
(Cairns 2000: 448). The song has close links to the Orange Order and is predominantly associated with Orange 
parades, but it has been appropriated for use in other setting (Radford 2004) and, today, is commonly heard at 
Irish League soccer games and at Northern Irish international matches (Bairner 2000). Its singing is perceived, at 
times by both sides, to by an act of intimidation and a tool for claiming space, most notably in 2013 when it was 
played outside St. Patricks Catholic Church on Donegal Street by a band participating in the 12th July parade 
(BBC News 2013). 
The Sash 
So sure Im an Ulster Orangeman, from Erin's isle I came, 
To see my British brethren all of honour and of fame, 
And to tell them of my forefathers who fought in days of yore, 
That I might have the right to wear the sash my father wore 
Chorus:  It is old but it is beautiful, and its colours they are fine 
It was worn at Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne. 
My father wore it as a youth in bygone days of yore, 
And on the Twelfth, I love to wear the sash my father wore. 
For those brave men who crossed the Boyne have not fought or died in vain 
Our Unity, Religion, Laws, and Freedom to maintain, 
If the call should come we'll follow the drum, and cross that river once more 
That tomorrow's Ulsterman may wear the sash my father wore 
Chorus 
And when some day, across the sea to Antrim's shore you come, 
We'll welcome you in royal style, to the sound of flute and drum 
And Ulster's hills shall echo still, from Rathlin to Dromore 
As we sing again the loyal strain of the sash my father wore 
Chorus 
50 Formed in 1884, the GAA is an Irish international sporting and cultural organisation protecting and promoting 
the indigenous Gaelic games, including hurling, camogie, Gaelic football and Gaelic handball. The Association 
exists as a touchstone for opposition to the British presence in Ireland (Hassan and Telford 2014: 89) and, since 
its birth, has consistently been associated with exclusivist policies, such as the ban which prevented members of the 
Northern Irish police and army from joining and playing (Fulton and Bairner 2007).  
and contention surrounding the Irish Language Act, Gaeilge  are always-already excluded before they 
are even reached (Ahmed 2006). 
Traditionally, Irish culture and traditions, including speaking as Gaeilge, dwell exclusively in Catholic 
areas, they have a home in west Belfast, in Short Strand, and on the Antrim Road. To engage with the 
Irish language as a Protestant necessitates crossing from this side into that side, from here to there: ...if 
I wanted to learn Irish Id have to go to west Belfast or whatever (Sarah). For Belfasts Protestant 
community these far spaces are traditionally marked as unsafe, with the body conditioned to feel a 
degree of fear on entering unfamiliar territory (Mitchell and Miller 2019). As we naturally turn away 
from what we fear, the Protestant body is excluded from Gaelic: the Irish language is always-already 
an object unavailable from the Protestant orientation. Rosie who travels from north Belfast to attend Irish 
language classes at Turas illustrates how, as a member of the Protestant community, she hadnt any 
inroads into looking for [Irish language] classes. However, fixity and unfixity are in constant tension 
(Perkins and Rumford 2013) and, back in 2012, the birth of Turas called Belfasts territorial 
fragmentation into question. 
The birth of Turas on the Newtownards Road suddenly gave the Irish language geographic nearness 
and proximity to the Protestant community. Moving towards the Irish language no longer required leaving 
ones dwelling and navigating borders, boundaries, and partitions; Gaelic was here, present within a 
Protestant territory. Both Josie and Karl indicate how the ability to attend an Irish language class within 
a geographic space of comfort and belonging increased the accessibility to the Irish language for the 
Protestant community.  
Well there are other places in Belfast to go to learn Irish, butI think its much easier access and much 
more neutral territory rather than going up the Falls Road where you are in the middle of umm the 
middle of a big Catholic community there, you justIm not saying you feel threatened, you dont, its 
justits just much better here, which I think is brilliant. (Josie) 
Because it was in East Belfast it felt more accessible to me and not that I've any bias at all, I have none, 
I'm not, I'm not sectarian whatsoever, but I think I would have felt a wee bit intimidated by going to a 
school in west Belfast for example... Sort of if I had have went there and felt like maybe I don't really 
fit in. Whereas at Turas it's like you're with, you're with your, it's a horrible thing to say but you sort of 
feel like you're with your own a wee bit more, you know. So, it did feel a bit more accessible. (Karl) 
Both Josie and Karl compare the location of Turas to the territorial location of Irish language classes in 
west Belfast, suggesting Turas has a much more accessible location. Josie seems to find it difficult to 
articulate why Turas is more accessible than going up the Falls Road. Although Josie states she does not 
feel threatened by being in a Catholic community, at the same time does says its just much better here. 
She may rationally know that the Catholic community are not threatening, yet there is still a feeling of 
unease with moving from here to there. 
On the other hand, and despite having no bias and not being sectarian, Karl directly articulates the 
intimidation that would engulf his body was he to attend an Irish language school in west Belfast. This 
feeling of intimidation is contrasted to the feeling of comfort when youre with your own; when you are 
here opposed to there. Both Josie and Karl voice the difficulty in moving towards a space they are 
habitually conditioned to recognise as fearful, intimidating, and threatening. In contrast to the Falls Road, 
The Newtownards Road is a space already present and familiar from the Protestant line of orientation 
and, so, attending classes here does not entail crossing territorial borders and transgressing visible and 
invisible geographical boundaries. Turas is geographically more accessible form the Protestant line of 
orientation. Nonetheless, for a Protestant body to turn towards Turas and the Irish language, there is still 
a need to overcome the mountain of historically entrenched and contemporarily contentious ideological, 
cultural, and political boundaries. It is these boundaries we now turn to.  
5.2.1 Balla  Sochna Cultrtha  
The force behind Turas is Linda Ervine. As we have heard, Lindas background and everyday life are 
firmly grounded in Protestant, Loyalist east Belfast, where Linda continues to live today. Lindas life was 
marked by the Troubles in a way that mirrors the normalisation of violence characterising everyday 
Belfast during the 1970s and 1980s, yet she stresses poverty and deprivation  similarly to most of the 
east Belfast community  were the more acute hardship. 
I suppose for all of us it [the Troubles] was in the background, you know. I didn't have anybody 
particularly close to me, my mummys cousin was murdered, umm, she was shot dead in the house, but, 
you know, there was nobody, you know, I was lucky in that way. The family were, you know, sort of 
involved politically and you know, my daddy and my uncles would have been arrested and things for 
different reasons and what notit was a backdrop to your life, you know, but the real hardship was 
just poverty and having children very young and unemployment and bad housing. And I had a lot of ill 
health, I suffered very badly from agoraphobia and, umm, I was just, just anxiety and panic attacks 
and fear and, you know, I just became very, very crippled, crippled with illness really.  
Linda got married very young and became a mother at the age of sixteen. To escape the 
paramilitarisation plaguing east Belfast, Lindas first husband joined the army. He served three years 
but found army life difficult and he soon returned to Belfast, where he got a job with the Michelin Tyre 
Factory. Unfortunately he lost his job within a few months: it was just the beginning of the year and he 
lost his job, it was just, you know, things were getting bad, he never worked again for about 4 or 5 years, 
you know, well I say he didn't work, he never worked legally againMy nanny used to feed us and what 
not, you know, it was just very, very tough times (Linda). Linda describes her late teens and early twenties 
as very lonely and isolated. Her everyday life was limited to the home, and her interactions were 
restricted to a handful of close friends and family.  
Lindas saviour was education. Linda embarked on community education courses that quickly led to 
GCSEs, A Levels, and a degree in English from Queens University, Belfast. Following her degree, Linda 
completed a years teacher training and became an English secondary school teacher.  
I went to Queens and did a Degree in English and then I did a years teacher training and I mean it 
was totally, totally life changing because I think for the first time in my life I felt like I had some control 
over something, you know. I could make choices. I got out of my marriage which had become very 
violent and my husband was an alcoholic and a drug addict and, you know, it was very, very messy but 
it very gradually started to change, you know, and I got a job and started teaching and just, you know, 
started to find a bit of peace. And I then met Brian and I remarried and moved back down, because I 
was living on the bottom of Castlereagh Road, so I moved back down to here. 
Although now living apart, Linda is married to Brian Ervine. The Ervines are a high-profile political family 
who have been at the forefront of contemporary Unionist politics,51 with Brian Ervine having led the 
Progressive Unionist Party (PUP).  
Lindas life tells the story of a typical body born in east Belfast. Protestant tradition characterises her 
life and, to a degree, Unionist politics. This enveloping, markedly distinct from a Catholic enveloping, 
provided Linda with the credibility to initiate her vision of an Irish Language centre is Belfast  her 
Protestant faith and intimate ties and support for Unionist politics could not be denied, and removed her 
from the Republican rhetoric surrounding the Irish language. When Turas first began in 2012, the bodies 
attending the Irish language classes were firmly rooted in the heart of east Belfast, with members of the 
Red Hand Commandos in attendance.52  
Turas immediately received a significant degree of publicity. Fundamentally, this attention stems from 
the unique position of Turas  an Irish language project located in the heart of east Belfast aiming to 
connect Protestants to their own history through Gaelic  and the direct involvement of Linda Ervine. With 
the current contention surrounding the Irish language and the DUPs continual rejection of an Irish 
Language Act, Turas has increasingly been drawn into political debates both in Belfast and further afield.  
I wouldnt have opened my mouth because I felt it was too much of a political hot potato and I was 
quite frightened to be honest. And then something happened on social media, where I actually said no, 
51 The Ervine family are well-known in Belfast and across Northern Ireland. David Ervine, who was Lindas brother-
in-law, was leader of the PUP from 2002-2007, when he suddenly died at the age of fifty-three. David Ervine, in 
his younger years, was an active member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and during the Troubles he was 
jailed for eleven years for transporting a bomb. On his release from jail in 1980, Ervine joined the PUP and in 
1997 he was elected as a Belfast city councillor. Ervine campaigned vehemently for the 1998 yes vote for the 
Good Friday Agreement and, as a member for east Belfast, he returned to the Assembly. In 2002, he become the 
leader of the PUP and was an integral force in preventing the collapse of the Loyalist ceasefire (Bowcott 2007). 
52 The Red Hand Commandos are a small Ulster Loyalist paramilitary group, who are closely linked to the UVF. 
The group is named after the Red Hand of Ulster, a symbol permeating the street of east Belfast. Whilst their 
involvement in the Troubles is widely acknowledged, they are recognised as a very secretive and disciplined group, 
with the consequence little is known about their formation and activity. Today, the role of Red Hand Commando 
members is non-military and civilianized, and many actively participating in community work (Ferguson 2016). 
Interestingly, in 2016 the CTS* worked closely with the Red Hand Commandos in an arts-based peacebuilding 
project, wherein the group explored their identity and together created a stain glass window. The window was 
first unveiled to Irish President Michael D. Higgins and was displayed as the Department for Foreign Affairs and 
Trade in Belfast. I attended a meal at the Irish Secretariat building in celebration of the Red Hand Commandos 
work with the CTS*. During the meal, a member of the group, who is now engaged to an Irish speaker from west 
Belfast who teaches at Turas, stated: at one time she [his fianc] would have been the ideal target  from west 
Belfast, comes from a high profile Republican family, and shes an Irish speaker. 
I am in favour [on an Irish Language Act] I was always afraid, you know, how far could I go. You 
were waiting to sort of, you know, the bubble will burst here, and I'll be attacked. Now I've got a lot 
more confidence, I just think no, this is what I believe, but you were sort of feeling your way. And of 
course, there's Brian in the background going, oh you know, be careful, don't say this, don't say that. 
But umm, anyway I went and thought about it and I had people who were coming to me and you know, 
they were sort of supportive of me but they didn't wanna be photographed with me, they didn't wanna 
be seen with me, they didn't want anybody knowing, you know, so it was all behind doors, and I was 
quite disgusted by that. So, I thought I can't, I can't be like that, you know, if I believe something then 
I have to believe it publicly and I have to say it publicly. 
With Brexit and the suspension of Stormont, the atmosphere in Northern Ireland has altered. The 
increasing tension moving through Belfast is manifest in a shift of attitude towards Turas. Today, the 
historic abhorrence for the Irish language among the Protestant community has extended to a direct 
distaste for the Turas project and Linda herself.  
Lindas Protestant and Unionist enveloping legitimised her initial movements towards the Irish language. 
Yet, this movement today is framed as a deviation from the communal Protestant orientation. I merely 
mentioned I was learning Irish at Turas and without even taking a breath Frank, an active member of the 
Orange Order, firmly exclaimed: With Linda Ervine? She is hated amongst the Protestant community. 
Lindas personal history has largely been forgotten by the staunch members of her community who, now, 
regard her with great contempt. The presence of Turas undoubtedly challenges the fixity of Northern 
Irelands boundaries and borders, however in a contrasting movement, Unionist politicians have 
overwhelmingly framed debates surrounding the Irish Language Act within the historic zero-sum narrative, 
as a victory for Republicanism that compromises the very Britishness of Northern Ireland. The Irish 
language remains closely tied to Republicanism in the post-conflict era, as Patrick discussed: 
Cos it [the Irish language] still has that [Republican] attachment to it, even among friends of mine, 
party political friends of mine would still say to me, oh what are you learning that old Provo Irish for. 
The Irish language continues to be recognised through inherited truths, sustaining a framing that posits a 
movement towards the Irish language as a transgression of, and act antithetical to, Unionist politics and 
a Protestant, British way of life. 
Turas is perceived among the Protestant community to challenge Northern Irelands natural union with 
Great Britain, as it advances a direct threat to the British character of east Belfast. ine, who works for 
Turas, explains the workings of this perception. 
ine: So if you have a good solid Protestant, Loyalist, British east Belfast that safeguards their 
 base, anything that begins to diminish that in any way however slightly, potentially they see 
their base eroding a little bit. So, I think for those kinds of groupings that's challenging, 
they won't like it, you know. 
Ciara:  And if your leadership is continually and repeatedly telling you that then you can understand 
why it's that kind of rhetoric which becomes commonplace and gains an ordinariness in 
everyday society, as opposed to just at the political elite level. 
ine: Yes, yes, so I think, you know, a vested interest I suppose you would call it  legitimately 
invested interest not so legitimately vested interest  I think probably they feel anything 
that threatens the identity of the area threatens them, ultimately... If you see this part of the 
city as British, then anything that isn't overtly British is a challenge. 
Turas location on the Newtownards Road taints the exclusive British, Unionist identity of east Belfast and, 
in turn, the natural presence of the Protestant community in Northern Ireland  a rhetoric that has been 
absorbed into broader contemporary narratives.  
Since the colonisation of Ireland, in terms of both population and power, the Protestant settler community 
has been dominant across the Ulster province. The Good Friday Agreement, under the principle of parity 
of esteem, challenged this dominance. The last couple of decades have witnessed a growth in the power 
and influence of Nationalist politics, culminating in an expansion of rights and visibility for the Catholic 
community, with a growth in the tangible displays of Irish culture and traditions. Accompanying this growth 
is an increase in the number of Northern Irish citizens identifying as Catholic, while the Protestant 
community is witnessing steady decline (Holland and Rabrenovic 2017).53 Subsumed within binary logic, 
the increasing visibility of a growing Catholic community with expanding rights represents a loss or 
diminishment to the Protestant community.  
Frank is an active member of the Orange Order and one afternoon he showed me around the Orange 
Hall in north Belfast. Although not open to the public, the Orange Hall resembles a museum (see figure 
15). Walking through the different rooms, Frank showed me a picture of Nelsons Pillar in Dublin. The 
Pillar was erected before the Republic of Ireland became an independent state. In 1966, the IRA planted 
explosives that severely damaged the Pillar, with the Irish Army later destroying the remnants. An hour 
later, sitting in a Presbyterian coffee shop, Frank and I had a more in-depth conversation about the 
Orange Order and the shifting manner in which it has approached Irishness. 
53 The last census in 2011 revealed 48% of Northern Irelands resident population identified themselves as 
Protestant or as brought up in the Protestant tradition, which marked a 5% drop from the 2001 census (Northern 
Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2012). In contrast, those describing themselves as Catholic or as brought up 
Catholic increased by 1%, reaching 45% in 2011 (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2012). More 
recent figures, taken from 2016 and which surveyed those of working age, revealed of this population 42% 
identify as Catholic and 41% identify as Protestant (Executive Office 2019). The difference among schoolchildren 
is starker, with 51% of schoolchildren identifying at Catholic compared to 37% identifying as Protestant (Gordon 
2018). Whilst there is still a notably larger percentage of Protestants over the age of sixty (57% to 35% 
identifying as Catholic), it is believed by the 2021 census Northern Ireland may have a Catholic majority (Gordon 
2018). Although 45% of people identified as being from a Catholic background in the 2011 census, in the same 
census only 25% of Northern Irelands residents claimed an exclusive Irish identity, while 40% identified as British 
only, and 21% described themselves as exclusively Northern Irish (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 
2012). Thus, whilst an increasing percentage of Northern Irelands population may identify as Catholic, this does 
not necessarily mean there is also an increasing number identifying as Irish.   
Ciara: You were saying when you were explaining about Nelsons Pillar in Dublin that there is that 
kind of fear Protestantism is being lost or is being challenged or threatened, is that a 
founded fear or do you think it is more of a perceived threat? 
Frank: I think it is a founded fear. From the very start of Unionism, it was Winston Churchills dad 
Randolph Churchill who coined the phrase Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right, at the 
start but ever since then a lot of the slogans of no surrender, not an inch, what we have 
Figure. 15. Images taken from the Orange Hall in north Belfast. From top right: flag depicting the Red 
Hand of Ulster, uniform warn when participating in Orange parades, and a series of drums used in Loyalist 
marching bands (authors own, 9th October 2017). 
we hold, you know this we shall maintain, it is all about maintaining a way of life and an 
identity which the Ulster Protestants see as being under threat or being eroded The 
tradition of Organism is parading, and would you say parading is under threat, rightly or 
wrongly you have to say parades are under threat, whatever your viewpoint is you have to 
say it is under threat. Orange Halls, where Orangemen meet, are they under threat? Well 
I think it is, 285 of the 600 hundred Orange Halls have been attacked. Belfast Orange 
Hall is the most attacked building in Belfast, perhaps only second or equal with Greencastle 
Orange Hall [in Donegal]. There was an author called A.T.K. Stewart, he wrote a book 
called the Ulster Crisis, and he says they might never make Northern Ireland Irish, you will 
never have an all-Ireland, but what they will do they will make the place so Irish they 
couldnt live in it and we see that is where it is going, that is where the country is going. 
Irishness is on the rise and erm a sense of Britishness is certainly under threat.  
Ciara: And what would you point to that would show Irishness is on the rise? The Irish Language 
Frank: The Irish Language Act is certainly the biggest one, but you can talk about Irish being 
funded to the tune of two hundred million pounds per yearerm and you can talk about 
cross-border, and you can talk about the Good Friday Agreement which established the 
Southern Government with a role in anything that happens in Northern Ireland from now 
on. There are Southern Government offices at Stormont. So those are all sovereignty issues 
and they are things, I dont have a problem with all of those, but some people point to 
those as a diminishing of Britishness. The flag coming down of the City Hall is erma 
removal of a very British symbol, but its coming down and there is an increase in City Hall 
of Republican stained-glass windows. The argument is they are creating a shared 
spacewhether the shared space is right or not, again I am not trying to get into the 
argument, I am just trying to say to get that shared space there has to be a decrease in 
Britishness 
Ciara: Because it was originally a British place? 
Frank: A 100% British. Belfast has a very British history, when it got its charter [in 1888] I think 
it was like a 6% Catholic population, then at the time of the Home Rule crisis in 1912 it 
was something like a 20% Catholic population, erm today it is a 55% going by the 
balance of power at City Hall, a 55% Catholic population. So, the Irish are playing catch 
up in the building of the city. They dont have a natural, historical, visual presence in the 
city, so the only way they can do that is to build more Irish monuments, structures, identities, 
erm, and to take down or dilute some of the British ones. 
Mirroring ines words, Frank voices how the increasing presence of Irishness and Irish culture throughout 
Belfast is perceived by the Protestant community to be accompanied by a dilution of the Britishness. The 
presence of the Irish language  a fundamental component to and marking of Irishness  in Loyalist east 
Belfast epitomises, for large sections of the Protestant community, this dilution and advances a contesting 
claim to the natural, historical, visual presence of Britishness and to those who regard themselves as 
British.54 The Irish language has been coded and recognised as a weapon that undermines the union 
(Seamus). This rhetoric, which has becoming increasingly vocal following the birth of Turas against the 
backdrop of a growing Catholic community and Stormonts suspension, sustains the stasis of the mass 
Protestant orientation. The Protestant community continue to turn away from Gaelic, fearful that through 
an engagement with the language they would mutate into Republicans (Laura). To learn the Irish 
language as a Protestant is a movement in direct opposition to the cultural and moral milieu of ones own 
world, it is a movement deviating from the straight line of orientation inherited from ones enveloping 
world. It is this movement that we now begin to move with. 
5.3 Moving Towards Turas 
What am I doing here? Should I really be doing this? 
I sit in the car park and these questions. These thoughts circulate continually through my mind, round and 
round. I have been sitting here now for fifteen minutes, watching as the large hand on the clock edges 
closer and closer to the right where, taking on a regimented vertical position, it chimes the hour. 
What am I doing here? Should I really be doing this? 
I havent told anyone I am here. Its a secret. If Id told them they might have stopped me, blocked my 
very movement. When they find out they wont be happy. They will respond to my confession  if I confess 
 with some smart comment. Or worse, they will be hurt, confused, angry. My movement will be considered 
as a betrayal, a betrayal of who they are, a betrayal of whom they know me to be. 
What am I doing here? Should I really be doing this? 
The big hand is still moving towards vertical alignment. I face straight ahead, but my eyes dart quickly 
back and forth, across the car door window, to and from the entrance. The almost invisible pane of glass 
acts as the partition, separating the world that is beyond from my world here. A fragile partition. A 
breakable border. 
What am I doing here? Should I really be doing this? 
54 Within the parameters of this rhetoric it is worth noting that, whilst the focus of Turas resides in the provision of 
Irish language classes, as the project has grown it has become increasingly interested in the Gaelic history of east 
Belfast. Today, Turas offers a Gaelic Bus Tour uncovering the hidden Gaelic history of East Belfast. Turas, also, 
have unearthed the history of Conn ONeill, a Gaelic lord who reigned over east Belfast in the 16th century, and 
now celebrates this history in another bus tour and in the Fil Conn ONeill. Along with several other organisations, 
Turas are involved in planning a proposal for the creation of an Irish Medium nursery and primary school in east 
Belfast (Meredith 2018). With Turas becoming increasingly embedded in east Belfast and, what is more, uncovering 
a Gaelic history of this traditionally British, Loyalist space, the rhetoric of threat and challenge of the Turas project 
to the identity of the area has increased.  
If Im going to move towards the entrance, then it has to be now. A long, deep breath in and out. I want 
to do this. A long, deep breath in and out. Slowly and with caution, my hand moves towards the handle on 
the car door and my body sits tall. A long, deep breath in and out. The glass partition becomes clouded as 
breath moves from the outside to the inside and back again: the partition becomes visible but so does its 
fragility. A long, deep breath in and out.  
The border slowly dissolves, and I extend into space. 
I am moving, and I am doing this. 
Based on interview, October 11th 2017 
A body deviating from its inherited line of direction animates a queer movement. Queer, as Ahmed 
(2006: 198, my emphasis) employs it in this context, does not refer us to nonnormative sexualities but to 
the moment in which norms fail to be reproduced. To turn towards Turas and engage with the Irish 
language is to respire in a movement failing to align to inherited norms of action, representability, and 
perception. Ahmed (2006: 66) argues the queer moment, in which objects appear slantwise and the 
vertical and horizontal axis appears out of line, must be overcome. There is a need to overcome the 
queer movements because the contradiction of norms prevents bodily action and, so, reduces the body 
to stasis. Overcoming the queer movement is not animated via realignment but through breathing life 
and vitality into movements that are out of line. Irigaray (2008a) reminds us it is by taking on, by moving 
with, the not-being of a straight continuum that we become ecstatic. The queer moment only prevents 
movement when we remain within our current horizon, where we dwell in the stasis of predetermined, 
straight lines; a horizon in which there is not movement but merely a continuity of direction. Moving with 
the queer moment requires putting oneself and ones dwelling in question; it requires a movement not 
only towards the other but a movement in which we return to the self. This movement of return can be 
located in curiosity. 
A queer movement towards Turas, wherein norms fail to be reproduced, necessitates curiosity. Curiosity 
advances a call to the other  a call from which the possibility of the encounter is animated. The stasis of 
Northern Irelands current horizon is largely suspended in a disenchantment in which everything is always-
already known, labelled as us or them, as near or far. Turas, however, is unique; it a novelty moving in-
between polarised labels. This novelty animates a curious call to the other, a call responded to in a queer 
movement.  
ine first started attending Irish language classes at Turas in June 2016. She was immediately impressed 
by Turas and was soon volunteering to support the project. The number of learners attending Turas has 
increased year on year, which has put considerably pressure on its administrative running. Having gained 
a small pot of additional funding, Turas advertised a part-time administrative role which ine successfully 
applied for. Reminiscing about first starting Irish language classes in east Belfast, ine places her initial 
attraction in the novelty of Turas location and the projects aim of using Gaelic to break down sectarian 
divisions. 
I was intrigued by what they were doing. I was intrigued by the fact that they were trying to bed down 
the Irish language here in East Belfast and I suppose it did attract me, not for the same reason as it 
would have attracted maybe people who are more indigenous to the area, but because I liked that 
idea. 
ines background is characterised by a familiarity with the Irish language. ine was born in Dublin in 
the Republic of Ireland and, so, the Irish language is an object of everyday familiarity that was taught 
in school, seen daily on road signs, and displayed in many businesses and public locations. Whilst the 
Irish language is accessible and immediately present from ines inherited orientation, the heart of east 
Belfast with its Union Jack and red hands is not necessarily somewhere you would expect ine to feel 
wholly comfortable. Yet, alongside the unique aim of the project, it was the novel location of east Belfast 
that sparked a fascination and curiosity for ine and called her towards this Gaelic space.  
The novelty of the location of Turas does not, for ine, extend to the area itself. ine lives in east Belfast 
and, so, prior to attending Turas she was already familiar with the area. ine moved from Dublin to 
Belfast in 2014, which was a time of minimal violence and political stability. In addition, ines first-hand 
experience of the Troubles was likely to be minimal. Violence was largely confined within the borders 
of Northern Ireland,55 which geographically removed ine from the contentious and violent history of 
Northern Ireland broadly and of east Belfast more locally. ine would clearly be aware of this history, 
but she would not have directly experienced the everyday repetition of violence or have an acute 
memory of the brutality that plagued east Belfast at the time of the conflict and for many years after.  
Later in our conversation, ine revealed her curiosity and admiration for Turas resided not only in the 
location of Turas, but in the presence of Gaelic in an urban area.  
Also, which I find absolutely fascinating, is the fact that Irish is becoming an urban language in Belfast 
whereas when I mentioned the efforts to teach me Irish when I was in school, at that point in time, Irish 
was the language of the countryside, it was not an urban language and it didn't sit easy with me. I grew 
up in inner city Dublin, it didn't make sense to me, it just didn't, it didn't make any sense. I was always 
talking about going out to the bog and putting your boat out, what is this about? And I think it's just 
fascinating now to see people who have become fluent, as young people, in an urban environment and 
how they are adapting the language to that urban environment.  
The curiosity ine feels towards Turas is bound up with a broader fascination in the resurgence and 
popularity of the language in the city of Belfast. ine contrasts this popularity with the perception she 
had of the language when she was at school in inner city Dublin, and the demise of Gaelic in the Republic 
55 While the conflict was mostly contained in Northern Ireland, the IRAs armed struggle did encompass sustained 
bombing campaigns against military, economic, and political targets in Britain, while Loyalists paramilitary groups 
occasionally advanced attacks in the Republic (White 2003). 
of Ireland. The curiosity felt in touching upon this difference returns the body to itself, as ines habitual 
perceptions of the Irish language are challenged.  
Locating the queer movement towards the Irish language in curiosity, does not give curiosity a singular 
location. Irigaray (2008a: 21) emphasises the place where the call of the other reaches us, the place 
in which we become affected by the fullness of curiosity, is unique to each body. Thus, whilst some 
learners, like ine, placed their curiosity most prominently in the novel location of Turas and in the unique 
way in which the project was conceived, for other learners the feeling of curiosity was sparked by the 
link between the language and Irish history or by the link between Gaelic and local place names. As 
Josie articulates: I started being interested because of place names, I think that brings a lot of people to 
Irish, if you are interested in place names. Other bodies placed their initial curiosity with Gaelic in their 
personal family history or in the Irish language itself.  
Gareth, who now works for Turas, recalls the curiosity he felt when seeing and hearing the Irish language 
as a child. 
I had relatives who said they couldn't get into the Guards unless they spoke Irish and I thought this is 
discrimination, but I didn't have any big feelings about it and then of course the Troubles broke out 
and, umm, they started to put up signs on the lower Ormeau Road, it was the first place in Belfast 
where they were put up. But I remember being curious about them as opposed to just being, as opposed 
to being hostile to them, which I shouldn't have been being a Protestant or whatever. Err, but when I 
heard the theme from Harrys Game, umm, I, I thought it's amazing that they speak Irish, so I got the 
album, umm, the spelling was very strange, so I was very curious about that and I've always been 
interested in words and languages and stuff. And I remember at the time as well I was a bit lost after 
leaving school and I was looking for a, err... And I remember the shock of going to Gweedore, where 
Clonard came from and hearing people speak Irish, I was just completely gobsmacked, umm, by the 
fact that you could drive two, two hours away, two to three hours away and suddenly there's a whole 
community speaking a different language. Umm, so that got me into it and then it sort of accelerated. 
Gareth gives voice to the shock and admiration felt the first time he visited the Gaeltacht where, less 
than a three-hour drive from Belfast, there was whole community conversing in the Irish language. In 
addition, he speaks of a curiosity and interest felt on seeing the strange spelling of Gaelic words. Mark, 
who started attending Turas with his wife Mary in 2017, also spoke of a fascination with the 
pronunciation and spelling of the Irish language: I just find it fascinating and over the years, just even 
trying to pronounce stuff is just sort of bizarre, (laughing) you know because it doesnt look the way its 
pronounced. Although stemming from a variety of locations, the main impetus for moving towards Turas 
resides in curiosity. As the founder of Turas, Linda has witnessed approximately 2,000 learners coming 
through the doors (Mitchell and Miller 2019), many of whom she has had a direct conversation with. 
Linda acknowledges there are several reasons people attend Turas, yet she suggests ...for a lot of them 
its just curiosity about Turas and weve seen that curiosity increasingly grown. 
5.3.1 Desir ing movement  
Curiosity is closely intertwined with desire. To feel curiosity towards something is to approach it with a 
strong desire. Desire is usually thought is terms of a desire for knowledge, understanding, or information. 
To capture curiosity in knowledge and understanding, as the current organisation of our world does, is 
to diminish it to an activity of possession and appropriation or to a search for similarity, sameness, and 
identification (Irigaray 2008a). When curiosity is governed by already defined habits, norms, gestures, 
codes, and discourses approaching everything from a known totality, the potential for desire dissipates 
as everything and everyone has already been made our own (Irigaray 2002b). Desire cannot be felt 
for an object already captured, while desire itself cannot be captured. Desire, for Manning (2007: 36), 
is movement. It is beyond capture, domestication, mortgage and nationalisation. It does not belong to 
the state or to state-sanctioned practices and it exceeds violence and the law (Manning 2007: 36). 
Desire, however, must be cared for (Irigaray 2008a), by allowing the body to wander and wonder in 
curiosity, with a novelty that is not always-already imprisoned in the totality of sameness. Curiosity is not 
a desire for understanding but, following Manning (2007: 36), a desire for the the body in movement.  
Approaching the other in curiosity awakens or revives a relation with desire as movement. Desire holds 
the capacity to move the body in a tending-to or reaching-towards. This movement responds to the other 
who has called out to us, to the one who has awoken curiosity in us. Reaching towards the other first 
requires a tending towards oneself and ones own manner of dwelling. Irigaray (2008a: 7-8) illustrates 
before the other can be encountered there is a need for us to:  
...turn back on our path in order to question ourselves about where we are already situated. If we 
are not dwelling where we ought to dwell, being what or who we are, we are not prepared to 
encounter the other. We are only able to impose on the other our alienation, misunderstanding, or 
ignorance. Opening a threshold in order to approach the other requires that we dwell where we 
can and should be. 
In the ceaseless search for territorial roots, the starting point for our (mass) orientation will continue to 
unfold from a world, a body, and a dwelling that is already known. However, if we take an alternative 
starting point that views the body not as a being but as a to-be, then, what we understand to be the 
origins of the body also alter. The body animates its own becoming and makes its own origins through 
acts that cut it from enveloping mass roots. We come into existence, Irigaray (2017: vi) writes, by taking 
on the not-being of a [straight] continuum  a break, a void, a nothing  with regards to its provenance 
and environment. It is by ec-sisting from our origins, by becoming out of place, that we animate our 
being as ecstatic (Irigaray 2017: xi). Opposed to conforming to the habits, norms, and gestures of the 
enveloping world in which we dwell, we must question our dwelling and move out of place. 
We previously listened-to Mark giving voice to the curiosity and fascination he felt on hearing the spoken 
sounds of Gaelic and on seeing the language in its written form. Listening with greater intimacy to how 
Mark voices his movement towards Turas, we can begin to sense how being in a relation of desire to this 
strange and bizarre language animated a movement towards his own body and dwelling. Mark and his 
wife, Mary, decided to take the leap and started attending Turas at the beginning of the 2017/18 
academic year. Mark grew up in a traditional working-class Protestant family in north Belfast. His parents 
did not ideologically or physically embrace the Orange culture, but Organism did have a notable 
presence for his grandfather and grandmother who lived in the infamous Shankill area of Belfast and 
had an Orange Hall at the top of their street. Thinking back to his childhood, Mark recalls: there being 
a picture of me somewhere from when I was about three with an orange sash on. Marks territorial dwelling 
and the truths he inherited put particular objects within his bodily reach, such as the orange sash and 
the (Protestant) state school system. Other objects  GAA sports, the Irish language, Irish songs, and the 
Celtic culture  were unreachable. Although Mark has and continues to find himself straightened by the 
pull of his inherited Protestant orientation, he states: I never owned what I would see to be that tradition, 
Loyalist, British bit of things. Living with these feeling of separation and alienation, Mark for many years 
has desired something else, something more, something different. 
I was also going to Chile at one stage with work and they suggested that I got an Irish passport and I 
began to think much more where I was from and who I was, and I felt I had much more of an affinity 
towards Ireland than towards Britain, partly due to what I perceived to be peoples attitudes and yet I 
wasnt fully Irish as part of that culture was denied to me because of where I was brought up and how 
I was brought up, going to a normal state school and so on. So, I suppose I perceive myself to be Irish, 
I have a much closer affinity with Ireland than I would have to Britain. I love Irish music, I am just, it is 
something to do with identity and I am not comfortable with the identity people assume I am, maybe 
that is to do with politics as there is an assumption that because you are Protestant you are this, but I 
am probably Protestant and not that you know, I would probably perceive myself to be more Nationalist 
than anything else. I have always, for quite a long time, I have sort of yearned for something, for part 
of that Irishness and, as I say, I like Irish music and I would love to understand what I was actually 
listening to some of the time, and so the idea and the opportunity to do this [learn Irish] really just 
appealed to me. 
Mark, here, locates the impetus for his movement towards Turas in a turning back towards his own body. 
A movement of embodied return animates a questioning of oneself and ones own dwelling: it animates 
a disorientation in which one begins to wonder about and question the continuity of their inherited 
orientation (Ahmed 2006). Applying for an Irish passport marked a notable moment of internal and 
embodied questioning for Mark. This questioning affected Mark with the desire to cultivate a sense of 
Irishness, an object unavailable from his inherited orientation; he responded to the call of curiosity by 
first turning towards his own dwelling.  
Mark gives voice to an embodied desire that cannot be understood as a desire for understanding. It is 
not an activity of appropriating the other, or a search for likeness within a horizon in which everything 
and everyone is already known. Mark is not searching for a possible mediation in a common world 
already existing (Irigaray 2017: vii); in an already existing Catholic world that is oppositional to his 
inherited Protestant enveloping. Nor is Mark seeking to rewrite his past. Questioning dwelling is a 
movement of gratitude cultivating the distance necessary to see that our own singular being does not 
need to be continuous with the world into which we were born (Bregazzi 2019: 101). Gratitude prevents 
the body from becoming fixated by and in the past. It releases the body from resentment and frees our 
energy to construct bridges towards the future and to become ourselves, bridges in order that a new 
humanity can occur (Irigaray 2017: 64). Speaking about the bodies who move towards Turas, ine 
illustrates these are the bodies who are already facing the right direction...the ones who are looking back 
towards the past, youre probably never going to convince of anything. Mark voices how his movement 
towards Turas arose from a questioning in which: I began to think much more where I was from and who 
I was. Marks search for Irishness, then, is not a rejection or overcoming of the past nor is it a projection 
of himself onto a Catholic orientation. He is not attempting to construct a quietness by assimilating to the 
world of the other, but wondering about and beyond himself by listening to the desire of the other that 
attracts us beyond a horizon defined by sameness and the already common, a desire which remembers 
the ecstasis from which we exist and calls us back to the question our human being (Irigaray 2017: vii).  
Desire is the becoming of relationality always starting anew. Mark desires a becoming moving in relation 
to Irishness wherein the body does not coincide with itself[but] with its own transition: its own variation 
(Massumi 2002: 4). It is the desire for a movement breaking from the stasis of ones inherited orientation, 
as the call of the other ask us to unveil what our own being consists of and to discover how to allow it to 
remain and grow as being (Irigaray 2017: 70). Desire as movement is an unveiling that begins to subvert 
the dualism, the sameness, of the current horizon  a subversion that moves with an embodied and 
intimate curiosity, as well as with the distance of gratitude. As Mark himself states: I am probably 
Protestant and not that [Unionist/Loyalist].  
Not all conversations expressed as acutely as Mark how the desire to approach Turas first inspires a 
movement towards the self. Yet, there was a continual, if less explicit, voicing of a return to ones own 
body and a questioning of the binary identity politics upon which post-conflict Northern Ireland continues 
to take as its foundation. This can be exemplified by briefly returning to ines and Gareths story, both 
of whom work for Turas and, so, may have been more overtly questioned and challenged on their 
association with the project. Having articulated her curiosity surrounding the Turas project and its 
geographical location, ine stated: 
I don't like, I've known other people from south of Ireland who have moved to Belfast and they kind of 
just almost reinforced the geographical divisions that are here because they go to areas that are full 
of people they feel are like themselves and they don't come out of them, and I don't like that, I have a 
personal mission not to do that. So, I suppose coming here was part of that, I thought, you know, I 
don't want to just learn Irish with other people who are from a similar religious or cultural background 
or whatever... It was an opportunity to just break that mould a little bit and maybe contribute to more 
heterogeneity. 
Here, we listen-to how ines turn towards Turas lay in questioning the norms  the cultural, political, and 
embodied division  of her current dwelling and its normative orientation. This is not a desire for the 
other but a desire for the body to be in an alternative, incipient movement which does not reinforce 
what is but creates bodies, relations and worlds anew. 
Gareths movement towards the Irish language, also, inspired a return to and questioning of oneself and 
ones own dwelling. Gareths inherited Protestant orientation compels the body to recognise the Irish 
language, the Gaelic street names on the Ormeau Road, as firstly belonging to the other who is not-us, 
and, secondly, with fear and hostility. Feeling curiosity opposed to recognising an external fear caused 
Gareth to turn towards his own body: But I remember being curious about them as opposed to just being, 
as opposed to being hostile to them, which I shouldn't have been being a Protestant. Gareths desire for 
the Irish language moves him, potential unconsciously, towards his own body where he questions what it 
is that has stuckhim as new, different or unknown (Mulder 2009: 246). This questioning animates the 
body in a movement towards the self, as desire upsets our representation of the world...[and] brings us 
back to a being in the presence extraneous to the circle of representation (Irigaray 2017: 72). Desire, 
then, cultivates an opening and it is with this opening that the body gains the capacity to animate a 
queer movement towards Turas, as desire is brought back to the one who awakened it (Irigaray 2008a: 
The movement of desire entails risk. To return to the body in an internal questioning is to challenge the 
very construction of our enveloping world and, so, the very being on ones body (Nollert and 
Sheikhzadengan 2016). Irigaray (2017: 28) writes to question ones dwelling is to spatialise the world 
anew, to disclose it or to let it take form(s) according to its own dynamism. Questioning dwelling is a 
difficult task, not least because it is a movement our tradition has generally forbidden (Irigaray 2008a). 
The acquired shape of a world is maintained as straight when dwelling bodies are inline which, as Ahmed 
(2006: 66) illustrates, means when they are aligned to other lines. Vertical alignment, shaped via 
repetitive action across time, is the normative (Ahmed 2006). For a world to have a sustained shape, 
then, bodies are required to be in a continual process of alignment. Breaking with a normative alignment 
is both risky and dangerous, as Gareth and Karl express. 
I was a wee bit, god am I doing anything wrong here, am I betraying something, you know with this, 
because I did see it as a Catholic language, I did see it as a Republican language and you know, and 
a lot of my background, there was a part of me am I betraying something, you know. (Gareth) 
So, the first night I went I sort of thought, I was actually sitting in the car park at Turas and I was, I 
was like, I remember thinking to myself is this, should I really be doing this. I was like, I dunno, because 
my parents, I didn't even tell my parents I was going to do it I just kinda went. (Karl) 
Moving with desire is often accompanied by feelings of betrayal and disloyalty. The maintenance of 
inherited territorial roots requires a dwelling in continuation, a persistence in which there is never a break, 
a return, or an opening. Moving with desire risks putting the vertical out of line; it risks the sameness of 
the common.  
5.4 Conclusion: A movement towards breath  
Located in the heart of Protestant and Loyalist east Belfast, Turas is situated at the core of the Catholic-
Protestant narrative. It is marked as a space that threatens the very character of east Belfast, while those 
who move towards the space are largely perceived to be performing a deviant act of betrayal. Northern 
Irelands current political turmoil has called on bodies to adopt increasingly hard-line positions, giving 
this narrative an acute force and power that works to re-align potentially deviant bodies. Grounded in 
a historical narrative, the Irish language continues today as a highly symbolic corollary of the polarised 
partitioning of Northern Irelands two communities, recognised on one side with an affection and love 
and on the other side as a nonsensical, Republican weapon. Yet, it is the stark polarisation of Northern 
Ireland which allowed for the creation of an Irish language project in east Belfast.   
The territorial legacy of Northern Ireland does not simply frame Turas as a deviant space. In jarring 
juxtaposition, the active process of territorialisation unintentionally constructs Turas as a space of novelty 
and curiosity. Marked as a threatening language that the Protestant body should be fearful of, the Irish 
language has been suspended in an abeyance of drawing close: always there but never here. Turas, 
however, placed the Irish language in the heart of Protestant territory. The presence of the Irish language 
on the Newtownards Road sparked curiosity with the space of Turas but, also, permitted expressions of 
curiosity with the Irish language in itself. The body progressing along the communal Protestant line of 
orientation cannot, however, respond to the curious call voiced by the other. Responses to curious calls 
require movement. Movement that, first, turns back towards the self, as one begins to question their own 
dwelling and their own body. This creates a break in territorial orientation and animates a movement 
out of place whereby the body becomes ecstatic. 
Queer movements risk the sameness of the common. They risk the verticality of the communal orientation 
through which worlds sustain their shape. The moving body loses balance and embarks upon an unknown 
adventure from which there is a break in continuity or normative orientation as the idea of a stable, 
coherent body is subverted. Moving in an unexpected direction may, at first, be experienced as a 
disorientation (Manning 2007). These new and extant directions are not predetermined or communal. 
They are not the continuation of inherited orientations that reproduces the bodies as essentialised objects, 
but the creation of an embodied movement active prior the form.  
While novel movements can be accompanied by feeling of nausea and giddiness, Ahmed (2006: 157, 
my emphasis) illustrates how moments of disorientation cannot be reduced to such nausea; they are also 
the becoming of vitality.  
They are bodily experiences that throw the world up or throw the body from its ground. 
Disorientation as a bodily feeling can be unsettling and it can shatter ones sense of confidence in 
the ground or ones belief that the ground on which we reside can support the actions that make a 
life feel liveable. Such feeling of shattering, or being shattered, might persist and become a crisis. 
Or the feeling might pass as the ground returns or as we return to the ground. The body might be 
reoriented if the hand that reaches out finds something to steady an action. Or the hand might reach 
out and find nothing, and might grasp instead the indeterminacy of air.  
The body responding to the call of curiosity moves towards Turas as an unknown and mysterious space 
unlocatable in the territorial divisions of Northern Ireland. This is not a known, predetermined movement 
wherein the body continues in static worlds rooted to a defined, bordered territory. Rather, it is a 
movement that shatters the very idea of solid ground or rooting. A body in movement refuses the fixity 
of foundation (Armour 1997: 73) to animate a movement that is the becoming of an opening outside 
the current territorial horizon of Catholic or Protestant, in the initial makings of something new and 
different. This movement is an ungrounding (E. R. Jones 2011); a dynamic, unfolding movement that 
returns the body to the potential of breath.   
This chapter has moved with desire and curiosity to analyse how bodies break from inherited lines of 
orientation to create an opening to an encounter unlocatable in the solid rooting of territory. These 
bodies may have yet to encounter the Irish language, but they are the bodies that are already moving 
in relations of differentiation in proximity. Thus, I hope to have illustrated encounters are active prior to 
their physical manifestation and there is a pressing need to think not just what happens in the encounter 
but, also, the movements that make the encounter a possibility. It is these initial movement of curiosity 
and desire that are the very first weavings of peace. They are the opening to relations unlocatable in 
the solid rooting of territory: to encounters active in the shared practice of breathing.  
Interruption: The Halting of Time 
Her body shook with anger. A raw pain filled the room and reverberated throughout the air. There was 
complete stillness apart from the movement of lips: they still roam free and I can bump into them 
anywhere and at any time: the paramilitaries. And these are our own paramilitaries...they are the men who 
killed my son. A latent, but forever present, anger and resentment had forcefully and suddenly taken hold 
of the voice and infiltrated the air. Pain and injustice visibly manifest in the shaking body; in the intense, 
wide-eyed stare full of sorrow, pain, and desperation. A stare willing for freedom from the enduring 
torture continuing to eat away at the body. A pain and anger embedded in the marrow of who I am. 
Wherever I go, it goes. Wherever it goes, I orient. Boiling away, erupting at any moment. Corroding all it 
encounters, poisoning everywhere is travels. A virus that does not need air to foster contagion once 
declared. Its declaration suspends movement. It halts the body. It is the standstill of time.  
A dark cloud settles on the room. Gradually it recedes but it never dissipates. It lingers eternally.

Interlude 
The Failure of Contact 
We were all finally packed onto the coach after what had been a few difficult days of planning and 
dealing with the incessant questions, queries, and changing numbers. By the time we climbed up the steps 
and made our way down the thin corridor straddling the worn, burgundy coloured seats, all the spaces 
towards the front of the bus had been taken and, so, Lauren and I positioned ourselves at the back of the 
bus where we could watch what was going on. As the coach weaved its way through Belfast rush hour 
traffic, navigating a route that would take us from north Belfast to east Belfast, Peter took his place at the 
front of the coach and, hung onto the headrest of a chair for stability. He began speaking about the 
history of murals in Belfast is his low, monotone drawl that I had become accustomed to hearing, if not 
wholly at ease with. Being an expert on murals, Peters words elegantly discussed the different genres of 
murals found in Belfast  Loyalist murals, Republican murals, and peace murals  and navigated the long 
history of wall painting in the context of Northern Ireland, highlighting the temporally dynamic nature of 
this activity. The whole bus was gazing at Peter and, out of the corner of my eye, there was a hand 
running back and forth across a lined notebook as it sought to capture keywords and phrases. Peters 
carefully pitched words held the gaze of the listening bodies, subtly demanding the attention of their ears. 
Rarely had I seen the ladies so quiet and engaged.  
Constantly navigating Belfast on foot, I was not familiar with our route from north Belfast to south Belfast. 
Before long we were making our way around a formidable, large roundabout and I suddenly knew where 
we were. Bypassing Short Strand, we entered the Newtownards Road, the main corridor of east Belfast, 
and soon pulled up on the right-hand side. The Newtownards Road is a long, linear stretch of tarmac I 
know well, having walked up and down it four times a week for the past ten months as I made my way to 
and from the Skainos Building, where Turas is located. It is a space with a clear identity: suspended Union 
Jacks blow softly in the wind; the curbs and lampposts boast white, red and blue; and the walls are dotted 
with red poppies and the Red Hand of Ulster. After ten months of being in this space and with my English 
accent offering a reassuring and full proof disguise, the Newtownards Road is somewhere I have come  
at least in daylight  to feel relatively comfortable. However, as I make my way up and down it, I tend to 
walk quickly and with my head down, only daring to give the painted walls a quick, sharp glimpse  to 
stop and stare would be to highlight I dont belong in this space. However, with the security of a group, I 
was now going to have the time to slowly move along the gallery walls. 
Clambering off the bus to many comments of hes good isnt he as eyes gesture towards Peter, we were 
all soon crowded around the exposed end faade of a row of terrace houses facing the Ship of Dreams 
(see figure 16). Dedicated to the Titanic and east Belfasts shipbuilding legacy, Peter informed how this 
mural was designed as part of a re-imaging project that sought the removal of sectarian images displayed 
at the Short Strand-Newtownards Road interface. We stood gazing up at the massive boat and its  
infamous four pillars, an image that commemorated Titanic as both a feat of Northern Irish engineering 
and as a great international disaster.  
With the wind picking up and a chill begin to creep into our bodies through our exposed hand and heads, 
we followed Peter further along the gallery wall. Soon we were facing a series of images that had been 
curated to appear together. These murals were colourful; they were engaging and invited the eye to 
explore the story, the different shapes and shades. These images did not aim to intimidate and display a 
powerful marking of claimed space but, instead, advanced a message of peace and a proud celebration 
of the local culture (see figure 17). They aimed to express a positive message through bright, uplifting 
colours, outstretched arms, and peaceful words.  
As we continued along the road, leaving the interface and moving into the heart of east Belfast, we 
entered another section of the gallery. The images staring down at us were notably different. The colours 
bleeding down the walls were almost exclusively red, white, royal blue, and black (see figure 18). Red 
poppies, the red hand, and red crosses drew in the eye. The black, bold branding of UFF, EAST BELFAST,  
and LOYALIST marked the walls, as both the image and the author. There is no need to accompany the

hanging images with an explanatory and informative didactic  the message is clear; it is driven directly 
into the eyes and there can be only one interpretation. This is British, Loyalist, Protestant territory. The 
words inscribed in the mural inform our staring eyes that the war continues and will be maintained: we will 
be held in this stasis until we are triumphant. The messages and images of peace, of hope, and of love we 
have just seen fade away  they belong to a different world, to a future time.  
Continuing further along the Newtownards Road we no longer move as a single group but wonder the 
exhibition at our own pace. We move into another section of the gallery and the narrative, told by the 
very brick and mortar holding east Belfast together, continues. The gallery walls have been drained of 
colour, and I come to an abrupt stop as balaclaved men supporting guns stare directly down, piercing my 
body with their black gaze (see figure 19). Whilst other women stand around engaged in light-hearted 
chatter, I am unable to stop staring at the dark scene before my eyes. The black darkness of the paint 
spreads into the atmosphere, it washes over my body, and it stills movement with apprehension and uncase: 
an unease that until now, and when navigating these streets unaccompanied, has prevented my gaze rising 
and meeting with the eyes of the shielded face staring down.  
Figure. 19. UVF mural on the Newtownards Road (authors own January 23rd 2017). 
We were moving from east Belfast to west Belfast, from Protestant territory to Catholic territory. We had 
gazed up at walls that had already been marked as Protestant and now we would be gazing up at walls 
already recognised as Catholic.56  
Whether or not it was because it was closer to what I know, I find the murals of west Belfast much less 
intimidating. Guns do not haunt the images, and faceless men do not penetrate the body through narrow 
eyeholes. The words that met my eyes were not threatening. Paramilitary images did not meet my eye, I 
did not read messages of ownership and control. I did not feel the flying of the tricolour to be a 
constructed, powerful act of claiming space. The Gaelic etched into the bricks was not a mark of 
Republicanism and the harp was not playing an intimidating tune. The celebrations dancing upon the walls 
were not alien, the smile of Bobby Sands was not menacing, and the story of the Easter Rising was not my 
nightmare. Standing on Divis Street, my gaze is willingly drawn in, keen to explore the engaging sea of 
colour.   
After staring at the murals on Divis Street for some time (see figure 20), we slowly began to make our 
way back to the coach, who we had arranged to meet on Northumberland Street. Northumberland Street  
56  Prior to cross-community contact bodies, territory, and culture are a priori aligned to mass, essentialised 
categories of being. With bodies already defined, contact then becomes about meeting and relating to the already 
recognised Protestant body or Catholic body. This was demonstrated by Director of Good Relations when we 
discussed the United Youth Programme: One of the fundamental parts of the training programme that we are 
delivering is that before these young people can take their place in a work place they have to first learn to deal with 
good relations issues, because if I cant relate to you as a Catholic or a Protestant how am I going to be able to work, 
how am I going to be able to operate in a working environment, in a respectful and productive way..

connects Divis Street, which turns into the infamous Falls Road, to the Shankill Road, the Protestant area of 
west Belfast. These link roads were flashpoints areas for violence both during the Troubles and today, 
mitigated through the erection and maintenance of peace walls.  
I was ambling along the road in a loose huddle with Jasmine, Lauren, and a couple of the other ladies. As 
was usual for these visits, the pace of movement was slow while the gossiping and chatting was fast. Ears 
were drawn away from the current conversation as they attuned to the sound of quick, light footsteps 
approaching behind. As I was turning my head towards the attention-grabbing sound, one of the older 
ladies on the trip  a tiny, little woman  came almost running past, with her right-hand firmly gripping on 
to handbag as it was clutch tight under her other arm. She was walking much quicker than the rest of us. 
Her posture was stiff, and you could feel the tension that was radiating out from her body. As soon as she 
crossed the threshold of the Cupar Way peace wall (see figure 21), you heard her let out a big sigh and 
saw the tight tension fall away as a calmness washed, almost instantly and visibly, over her body.  
I was taken aback when, now in safe territory, I heard her exclaim how she had found the murals on this 
side much more threatening than the murals we have viewed on the Newtownards Road. When Jasmine 
queried as to why, she exclaimed: they were so menacing, the guns, and the END BRITISH RULE slogan, 
the call to SMASH STORMONT, the tricolour, the Gaelic. Staring up at the murals on Divis Road, after 
having crossed from the Protestant territory of east Belfast into Catholic west Belfast, the bodys attention 
was already caught by the telling of its communal enveloping. The body activated eyes which had already 
seen. Guns were recognised in the hands they were expected to be held. Republican language came from 
the mouths in which it was destined to belong. The tricolour powerfully claimed a wall which was already

Protestant Shankill area. The gates are opened Monday to Saturday at 6.30am and closed at 6.30pm, and on a 
Sunday the gate is open from 10.00am until 3.00pm (Google Maps 2018: n.p.). 
categorised as foreign. Now having crossed the peace wall and returned to the comfort of her rooted 
territory, the body once again felt safe. The fear that was visibly consuming her body had dissipated.   
Beyond Jasmines brief query of why, there was no space-time to explore the immediate feelings and 
sensations elicited from meeting with unfamiliar histories, cultures and traditions. There was, as always, a 
pressing need to attend to what was happening next. We needed to get the ladies back onto the bus and 
to the next destination, making sure they were at the right place at the right time. The images were 
recognised as menacing and rather than staying with discomfort, wherein there is the potential to break 
out of fixed patterns of interaction as the body moves beyond an activity of recognition (see Mayblin, 
Valentine and Anderson 2016: 214), the body simply turned its back and ran.  
I was becoming acutely aware facilitating site visits was an act of organisation, opposed to guiding 
dialogue in the exploration of feelings, and the posing of questions. Within the accompanying class-room 
sessions I knew there would be time built in for this exploration and, as Lauren once explained to me, the 
ladies set the pace of these sessions not us and if that means five more evening then well be here for those 
five extra evenings. Yet, as I sat on the back of the bus heading to the next destination, I knew when it 
came to the built-in time for exploration the event and sensation of contact would be lost; the wall, the 
murals, the other are already cemented as menacing and inherited truths, animosities, and identities have 
already been confirmed as the body falls back on dualistic comparisons of calm versus fear, threat versus 
comfort, us versus them (Valentine 2008). The very event of contact is reduced, relegated as an issue for 
later, and the body is left with few options but to draw upon what it already knows.  
Cross-community work starts from the stasis of what is and ends in the stasis of what is.

Breathing Encounters 
6.1 Introduction 
Sharing has been at the forefront of the Northern Irish Peace Process. Sharing is conceived by Northern 
Irelands political elites as the outcome of a united, peaceful future that has left behind violent cultural 
divisions and sectarian territorialisation. The goal of peace resides in creating a shared society, a shared 
future, a shared country, and a power-sharing government for the united community of Northern Ireland. 
Although at the forefront of the Peace Process, sharing is an ambiguous term devoid of reference to 
tangible implementation strategies and distinct social and public policy priorities (see Darby and Knox 
2004; Graham and Nash 2005; Hughes 2007; Knox 2011a; Marijan 2015; OKane 2013). 57 
Surrounded by ambiguity, both ideologically and practically, sharing has been framed within a host of 
other terms  tolerance, respect, understanding, unity, integration, inclusion, cohesion, and, arguably most 
notably, equality  which culminate in the recurring and principal mantra of the Executives frameworks 
for peace: a shared and better future for us all (Robinson and McGuiness 2010: 2). 
Peace in Northern Ireland has become a management problem, opposed to a political problem. Despite 
its very real achievements, the Good Friday Agreement negotiated a politics of peace devoid of 
movement. Peace and its possibilities have been reduced to a territorialising stasis that simply maintains 
what is  the management of the prevailing presence of segregation prefiguring the territory, lived 
reality, and everyday body of Northern Ireland  albeit less violently. The Catholic-Protestant binary is 
today managed through a rhetoric of equality that pursues parity of cultural esteem between the two 
traditions (Sluka 2009: 292), and acutely in relation to the ongoing cultural wars58 concentrated 
broadly around flags, parades and marches, bonfires, and language rights (Garry et al. 2018; Nolan 
2014; Wilson 2016). This agenda has historically been tied to the advent of good relations,59 which was 
57 The ambiguity surrounding sharing was expressed in a conversation I had with the Director of Good Relations: 
A few months ago we had a discussion with our staff, the staff who are involved in delivering good relations, around 
this concept of shared space, neutral space, dead space. I occupy it today you occupy it tomorrow does that make it 
shared or do we need to occupy it at the same time? Do we need to be doing the same things? So you know there are 
lots of challenges out there as to what we mean by sharing, particularly around shared space.  
58 Although problematics with the term cannot be ignored (see McDaid et al. 2013), referring to persistent cultural 
contestations through the term war illustrates how, even when mass physical violence has long stopped, there is a 
continuation of conflict by other means (Meredith 2017: n.p.): through zero-sum games of cultural contestation that 
continue to disfigure the potential for sharing (Tongue and Gomezs 2015). 
59 Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act set out the responsibility of the OFDFM regarding equality and the 
promotion of good relations. 
Section 75 Northern Ireland Act 1998  
(1) A public authority shall, in carrying out its functions relating to Northern Ireland, have due regard to the need 
to promote equality of opportunity.  
(a) between persons of different religious belief, political opinion, racial group, age, marital status or sexual 
orientation;  
(b) between men and women generally;  
(c) between persons with a disability and persons without;  
(d) between persons with dependents and persons without. 
reiterated when the 2013 TBUC strategy established an Equality and Good Relations Commission (see 
OFMDF 2015). Cross-community contact, as the foundation of good relations, is the principal activity of 
peacebuilding.  
Peacebuilding overwhelmingly resides in creating spaces of cross-community and cross-cultural contact. 
Yet, engineered contact works within the present horizon of Catholic or Protestant: bodies are determined 
in advance as Catholic or Protestant and, then, meet as Catholic or Protestant. Contact does not aim to 
change the terms of the horizon but, rather, seeks to moves from verticality to horizontality, from 
oppositional difference to common, mutual sameness. This horizon views difference as the irreducible 
problem, which equality seeks to negate through either (equal) separation60 or, preferably, through the 
engineering of a totalising and common whole (equivalence), both of which leave no room for sharing 
in-between.61 Removing the shared space of the in-between is the very suffocation of living (Marder 
2016), of transformation, and of world-making. Opposed to transforming perceptions, relations, and 
doings of difference, the Peace Process works within the current horizon but displaces the irreducible 
problem of difference with equality.  
A vision of equality, when combined with good relations and reconciliation, can be politically engineered 
to create the perception that sectarianism is being challenged (Graham and Nash 2006). In reality, 
equality simply manages sectarianism to be less violent. The Peace Process has been a process of 
managing two divided communities within the continuing, if less-than-violent, horizon of separate but 
equal (Knox 2011a; McDowell, Braniff and Murphy 2017; Nagle 2009), or benign apartheid 
(Graham and Nash 2006: 273). Management has largely prevented the return of large-scale violence 
(Knox and Quirk 2016), but it fails to animate an atmosphere of change and inspiration for the creation 
of an alternative, shared future wherein violence and division are not originary.  
The creation of an alternative horizon, in which peace emerges autonomously from structures of violence, 
requires a return to elemental and ontological commitments, to those dynamic, constituting forces that 
make possible territorialising identities and their spatio-temporal segregations. This alternative horizon 
depends fundamentally  elementally  on more dynamic processes than stasis can realise. It is not enough 
to recognise the need for shared worlds. The path to sharing is still lacking. Shared worlds need to be 
invented, discovered, and created (Irigaray 2017); they require the making of a new horizon respiring 
(2) Without prejudice to its obligation under subsection (1), a public authority shall, in carrying out its functions 
relating to Northern Ireland, have regard to the desirability of promoting good relations between persons of 
different religious belief, political opinion or racial group. 
60 In conversation with Irigaray, Marder (2016: 133, original emphasis) articulates the disjuncture between sharing 
and division: the difference between the two is that sharing life and breath augments and enhances the sphere of 
the living, whereas dividing life into the so-called natural or human resources diminishes it. 
61 I am not suggesting we should give up on equality (see Thiele 2014b). Yet, I am arguing against an equality 
produced from within the terms of what is and from an externalised position of universal moral norms and values. 
We need a conception of equality, and relatedly of sharing and coexistence, irreducible to the principle of 
separate but equal or to the sameness of equivalence. This necessitates the transformation of our current identarian 
horizon and the essentialised categories of commonness it produces.  
in-between. The in-between cannot be animated in contact always-already framed within a Catholic-
Protestant horizon. Rather, the making of the in-between respires with encounters taking place in a 
sharing of breath. 
Encountering the other in breath is the making of a shared interval, a third spacing, folding in-between 
the inside and the outside. The interval is not the reduction of difference to separation or equivalence. In 
the third spacing, difference is neither denied nor framed as a violent dualism but conceptualised and 
experienced as the very moment in which living vitality moves within a reciprocal sharing. Sharing, then, 
is not simply the outcome of the encounter; it is also the activity of such an encounter. Sharing become 
expressive in the event of touching upon relational limits in-between (Manning 2011, 2013). Sharing 
cannot be constructed from a vision of equality within the order of what is. Nor can sharing be cultivated 
in neutral spaces or spaces of mixed contact. The advent of shared worlds resides in micropolitical 
relations that are always-already moving within the shared, generative space of the in-between; within 
emerging encounters happening in-between a sharing of breath. 
This chapter moves with the everyday, breathy encounters in the space of Turas to trace the extant 
happenings of this space and the expressions of shared worlds as they emerge. As previously discussed, 
Irigarays thinking provides three key concepts for thinking through the encounter: wonder, silence, and 
sharing. The chapter, then, is split into three sections that trace these three concepts within Turas, with the 
discussion of wonder beginning with a brief discussion on listening-to, which I argue is the dominant 
activity of Turas. Approaching the encounter as a relation of differentiation in proximity, these three 
concepts are woven together through the practice of breathing, and the relational limits felt when the 
other is encountered in a sharing of breath. I conceive of the encounter, of dynamic relations of 
differentiation in proximity, as a generative spacing that transcends the divisions and territorialisation 
pervading identity politics and its normal political process by animating a novel horizon folding in-
between. Moving with breath we can begin to trace how alternative spatialisations of the political are 
being woven and, so, prospectives for creating peace. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the 
alternative horizon created in encounters of breath  a horizon created not in the equivalence of contact 
but from dynamic, if speculative, aerial ecologies of emerging relations.  
6.2 Listening-To Gaeliges  Wonder  
The process of learning is an activity of hearing. It is an aspiration for knowledge, reasoning, and 
comprehension in a desire to master the language and, ultimately, become fluent. Mobilising the French 
verb entendre, Jean-Luc Nancy (2007) ties hearing to understanding. In the context of language learning, 
understanding resides in fluency whereby a truth is imposed upon what is heard (Gallope 2008). 
Hearing, thus, suggests a sonorous form of a complete, perceptible body that can be heard as 
knowable, identifiable, and consistent. Hearing is an activity conforming to the logic that the whole can 
be known, the body can attain a position of accomplished understanding wherein nothing remains, 
nothing is left over, as everything is captured in complete transparency extraneous to the living (Gilbert 
and Pearson 1999; Irigaray 1993a; Irigaray 2016). Undoubtedly the focus of the classes at Turas, 
particularly in the more advanced classes, resides in gaining knowledge of Gaelic vocabulary and a 
grammatical understanding of the Irish language. Yet, I would argue hearing and understanding are not 
the predominant activities of the space. Bodies turn towards Turas not for understanding and knowledge, 
but with a felt curiosity. For these bodies Turas is less a space of understanding and more a space of 
listening-to.  
Turas is a Gaelic word meaning journey or pilgrimage. The journey Turas offers is not predetermined 
and the primary focus does not reside in progression and achievement. In contrast to the small numbers 
advancing to a high level and progressing through the trajectory of class levels at a predetermined 
pace, it is far more common for people to attend the same class, for example the beginners class or the 
post-beginners class, for two if not three years. Partly this can be put down to people starting at Turas 
throughout the year.62 Without a full year of engaging with the language, moving up to a post-beginners 
or intermediate class when the new academic year begins can feel too soon. Yet, this is only part of the 
story.63 The tendency to stay at the same level  displayed also in the willingness and desire to become 
involved with the wider community of Turas, such as the choir or Irish dancing classes, walking with Turas 
in the St. Patrick Day Parade, attending talks and events, or supporting the project through volunteering 
in some way  illustrates how the space of Turas does not reside wholly, or even primarily, in the 
development of understanding but in something else. As ine articulates:  
Its that sense of realising its not just about learning a language, it's not just about getting the words 
right or understanding how to form the genitive or some ghastly thing like that, it's actually, there's 
something else going on.  
This something else moves in excess of comprehension. It moves prior to and beyond understanding and 
knowledge, before the imposition of recognition and form. It moves not with the suprasensitive64 process 
of hearing, but with a sensuous and embodied listening-to.65  
62 Linda is keen to create an open and accessible pathway into the Irish language and to move with, rather than 
quash, curiosity. Thus, while most learners start at the beginning of the academic year, new learners are welcomed 
at any point.  
63 It is important here to note the relationship between education and socio-economic status. East Belfast is a 
working-class area and Turas seeks to be a local project offering a space and activity for the local community. 
Although Turas is financially accessible, Linda often articulates a large challenge Turas faces is the fear of education 
and learning in working-class communities: there's a class issue here with an educational issue and the working class 
ones are the first ones you lose, because they, they find it very difficult to learn, they're very intimidated by learning 
and I know, umm, do you know when we brought in exam classes, they were terrified. Thus, potentially, some learners 
opt to stay at the same level, at a level they know and feel comfortable, due to the fear of advancing and not 
being able to cope. Whilst I would not want to refute this and the intention of my research was not to explore this, 
I would suggest this reading does not counter the argument I am constructing regarding Turas being a space of 
listening and wonder. 
64 Irigaray (see 2008a, 2015c, 2015c, 2016, 2017, 2019) advances the term suprasensitive to refer to ideals, 
truths, values, and experiences constructed external to the sensing body, and its affects and relations, which work 
within the destabilising realm of absolutes.  
65 Irigaray (1996: 110) mobilises the preposition to as a barrier against alienating the others freedom in my 
subjectivity, my world, my language. She uses the to most commonly in her neologism I love to you, but she also 
Nancy (2007) determines listening (couter) to be a distinct experience from hearing (entendre). Whilst 
entendre seeks a closure of understanding and truth, couter moves with touch, uncertainty, and exposure. 
Listening does not aim for the comprehension, regulation, and reasoning of meaning. And it exceeds both 
coding and systematisation. As Stephen Pluhek (2002: 51) writes: to cultivate listening requires that 
we do more than hear a message in terms already established by society or coded by language. The 
Irish language brings together letters in an unfamiliar manner, the structuring of sentences is strange, and 
the grammar alien. Opposed to encountering Gaelic in its written form, classes at Turas revolve around 
listening-to the sounds, shapes, and movements of the Irish language. 
My breath alters as I frantically and with great intensity listen to the sounds coming from each 
bodytaall my focus lies with the sound, on the movement of word through the mouth, as I seek 
to build up the sentence sound by soundta, may, ta mayI am acutely aware of decreasing 
number of bodies to my left, the question will soon land at my body where it will be my voice, the 
sounds I create, that will hang in the airthree people. I am not processing how each person is feeling. 
I am not hearing go maith (good), go bre (fine), go holc (bad), or go measartha (middling), 
but listening to the sounds in their creation: moy, g, br-a, mass-ara. The next word is coming, 
listen closely g-moy, gmoy, ta may g-moy. Ive got the phrase and now, on a continuous loop, 
the four sounds go round and round my bodyta may g-moy, ta may g-moy, ta may g-moyI feel 
the shapes of the words and listen for the short sharp outlet of breath through a pursed mouth to form 
the g and the slower spread of the mmmmoooy over the lip as the they widen with the shape of the 
sound. 
Research journal, January 17th 2017  
Words are encountered not through letters but in the sounds and shapes of letter, accents, and syllables. 
I was touching upon and exploring the sounds of Gaelic prior to the imposition of understanding and 
comprehension.  
Although lessons vary from teacher to teacher, rarely at Turas was I confronted with the Irish language 
in its written form. Even when the words were written down, scribbled on the white board or staring at 
us from a handout, it was always after the sounds and shapes of the words had been listened-to. Then 
when we got the word, when we finally got to see the word as it was represented in Gaelic, it would be 
immediately lost underneath a jumble of illogical letters voicing the sound and shape of the words as 
they touched upon the ear and moved through the mouth (see figure 22). David, who had only been 
attending classes for a couple of weeks, expresses how Turas perceives and mobilises words in their 
sound. 
explains how the to is a silence that enables a listening to the other: I am listening to you prepares the way from 
the not-yet-coded, for silence, for a space for existence, initiative, free intentionality, and support for your 
becoming (Irigaray 1996: 117). Thus, I approach listening as a listening-to where the to is an illustration of silence 
(Malabou and Ziarek 2012), of an actively-passive spacing which, as will be made clear, is necessary to move 
with the wonder and mystery of the encounter. 
It is very, very difficult, umm, I, I keep on learning the pronunciation for a set phrase like how are you, 
or something like that, err, and yet when I see it written, umm, I don't recognise it because I'm trying 
to, err, put it out phonetically.  
With phonetic description proceeding representational form, Turas is a space not composed from acts 
of recognition. The Irish words are not met with a recognition permeating them with meaning. The absence 
of recognition illustrates there is something else going on. 
The jumble of letter proceeding, and exceeding, the unrecognisable written representation composes 
words with no language like meaning  English or Gaelic. They are a jumble of letters encompassing an 
embodied and emerging encounter that listens-to something other than sense in its signifying sense 
(Nancy 2007: 32). They are words that are alive (Kohn 2013). Meaning and comprehension always

displaying how the written Gaelic was immediately voiced in a jumble of letter that sought to depict the sound and 
shapes of words (authors own). 
came after sounds were listened-to and felt in their movement. Words were not approached with the 
desire to capture them in a determined meaning, to pin them down within the confines of comprehension 
 a comprehension which could only every been the imposition of meaning from within the English 
language. In the Turas classrooms bodies listen-to something at or beyond the limits of signification 
(Macpherson et al. 2016), wherein words are followed in the moving shapes of sound.  
Listening-to is a creative act that destabilises frames of normative significance, the workings of 
standardised truths, and the habitual activity of communal representation. The Irish language cannot be 
encountered through an English ear or English eye; it cannot be known from the English language, from 
the linguistic structure in which the Protestant body dwells. As David expressed later in our conversation: 
umm, you've just got to alienate yourself from English and from every other language that you might have 
learned. Listening-to the sounds of Irish language animates what David describes as an alienation from 
the norm. Alienation and destabilisation cultivate an opening from which the body is exposed to what is 
unknown and different (Gallope 2008); an opening onto wonder.  
Irigaray mobilises a conception of wonder in dialogue, at least initially, with Rene Descartes.66 Descartes 
(1989) regards wonder as the first and primary emotion. Wonder moves prior to judgements of good, 
bad, or use (Irigaray 1993a), and before a judgement of being (la Caze 2002). The fullness of wonder 
precedes the imposition of hierarchy (Bordo 1999) and representation, opening the body to both surprise 
and mystery. In Turas bodies are engaged in an act of listening-to mysterious words and surprising 
sounds, as they encounter and touch the Irish language and the very advent or event of the other 
(Irigaray 1993a: 75). Wonder testifies to the perpetual rebirth in an ongoing encounter (R. Jones 2011), 
as the other is met as if for the first time (Irigaray 1993a: 13). In wonder we do not project our self-
understanding onto the other but approach the other in a recurring openness, wherein there is the 
potential for the other to surprise us over and over again. Surprises are felt in listening-to how the letter 
b and the letter h come together to make a w sound, and in feeling how g can be moved before c 
in an act of eclipsing. They are felt in touching upon the poetic imagery of the language, as the body 
listens-to how there is no direct, singular word for engagement but the description between hand and 
ring, and in feeling how hair is not my hair but the hair that is on me. These surprises compose the 
everyday space of Turas and resonate throughout the body, as something appears novel or different 
from what we previously knew or presupposed it to be. These moments of surprise are most tangible is 
discussing the relationship between Gaeilge and Barla. 
66 Descartes philosophy is firmly grounded within Cartesian dualism, and his conception of wonder works within this 
framework. Although Irigarays thinking moves with Descartes conception of wonder, she uses Descartes own insights 
on wonder as a means of challenging his philosophy. Irigarays wonder undoes the foundational oppositions through 
which Descartes thinks wonder, and animates a wonder that is sensual, carnal, affective, and sensible (see Groen 
2016; Irigaray 1993a; R. Jones 2011). 
Moving against inherited truths and polarising narratives, Turas have developed a Hidden History 
presentation voicing the connections and influences in-between Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic, and the Ulster 
dialect.67 Linda and Gareth are invited across Belfast, and further afield, to deliver this presentation in 
various settings, whilst also presenting them at events held by Turas and in the beginners classes. Linda 
voices the wonder that engulfs the room during the presentation.  
...a lot of the words, you know, we use all those words clabber, dulse, shebeen, you know, I never knew 
they were Irish, I never thought, you know, it never struck me that there was anything different about 
these words or, you know, that they didn't, that they weren't English. But, umm, and suddenly when you 
put it into context and you realise, oh my goodness, you know, it is, it is quite amazing, it really is... I 
mean I see it with people with Hidden History all the time, their chins just drop and, ummyou know 
its like goodness we never knew that, I never, oh why didn't nobody ever tell us that before and you 
know, the only Irish I ever knew was  chucky ar la68 you know, they just don't know that anything else 
exists. You know, they had this strange idea of the language, you know, everybody who speaks it is in 
the IRA, you know, they don't know that other world and all of a sudden you're just opening up and 
saying look, listen. 
Lindas description of the dropping of chins voices a physical manifestation of the wondrous surprise 
affecting bodies listening-to a narrative differing from inherited truths asserting Irish and English as two 
separate, bordered worlds in an antagonistic opposition.  
The dropping of chins is indicative of a bodily interruption, a small shock or moment of disruption where 
in the body is immediately, and at once, brought-to-face with contingency (Grosz 2004: Wilson 2013), 
as it encounters words and phrase that have always been spoken. Surprising interruptions are felt in the 
halting movement of breath. They are interruptions in which there is, if only for a moment, an embodied 
conscious of ones own breath, as the movement of inhalation and exhalation faults in its habitual rhythm. 
This fault undoes worlds and turns cultures upside down as inherited codes are reversed and 
predetermined habits broken. It asks us to turn back the way that we have been taught, unlearning 
words that designate things or people and the manner according to which the totality of the world, 
especially the world of knowledge, has been constituted (Irigaray 2017: 66). The bodies affected with 
67 The Hidden History presentation works through several and words common to these three languages and 
explores the relations between them. In addition, it delves into local place names and traces their Gaelic roots, 
explaining how they were anglicised in the 1820s Ordnance Survey. For example, the colour yellow in Irish is bu 
(bwee) but was anglicised to boy and features in many different place names, such as Cloughboy and Letter Boy. 
Other common words featuring in place names are mr (big), beag (small), baile (town which became bally) and 
carraig (rock which was anglicised to carrick), resulting in places such as Carrickbeg meaning little rock or Ballymore 
meaning big town. 
68 Tiocfaidh r l, pronounced by Unionist and a large proportion of the Protestant community as chucky ar la, is 
Irish Gaelic for our day will come. The slogan is broadly associated with the Catholic, Nationalist, and Republican 
community and has close link to: the IRAs violent campaign during the Troubles; Sinn Fins Nationalist politics; the 
use of Irish among imprisoned Republicans; Nationalist and Republican murals; and the conviction of IRA member, 
where it has been used as a statement of rebuttal. More recently, Mary Lou McDonald used the phrase in her 
inaugural speech as Sinn Fin president in 2018. McDonalds use of the phrase was criticised across the island of 
Ireland, with many suggesting it was an ill-judged choice considering the failure to re-establish power sharing at 
Stormont and the dark memories contained in the words for the Northern Irish people (McQuinn 2018).  
wonder are not those who are judging whether the relation between Gaelic and the English language is 
suitable for the body as it has been determined a priori. They are not those fighting to understand 
Gaelic in its entirety or those reducing the Irish language to the singular phase tocfaidh r l, to a 
Republican label, and to a threatening voice. They are not those who are seeking to own words and 
phrase, to consume and embed them in one tradition or to dispel them to the unnatural place of the other. 
Wonder animates a distancing from the familiarity and comfort of learnt codes but, as Irigaray 
illustrates, this distancing is always double. 
The resounding interruption of wonder jars the body into motion (Connolly 2002: 113). It fills the body 
with the liveliness of the present (Bennett 2001) and expands ones field of vision and touch (Ahmed 
2004). To be affected by wonder, it to have ones nerves or circulation, or concentration powers turned 
up or recharged (Bennett 2001: 5)  the bodies leaning forwards into the presentation eager to listen 
to more, the ones who on listening-to the words and tones of Irish hold these in their mouth and feel their 
unfamiliar movement, the bodies responding in surprised interjections of oh wow and excited 
exclamation of my daddy used to say that (Research Journal January 23rd 2017). The liveliness of 
wonder animates openness to difference (la Caze 2002), as well as welcoming the future openly (Grosz 
2005: 166). This is not to open the other up (Groen 2016) but to awaken the passion, appetites, and 
attractions of the body as it listen-to what is beyond all knowledge, all judgement, all reduction to 
ourselves (Irigaray 2002a: 124), to that which is not yet (en)coded (Irigaray 1993a: 75).69 
To encounter the other in wonder, is to encounter a body as unknown. Yet, Irigaray (2002b: 164) 
illustrates how, when our senses are turned up and energy is charged, we can indirectly perceive 
something of this difference. This perception, however, cannot be directly associated with an organ or 
object a priori, as wonder always escapes control to become more. Here, is the second distancing of the 
double gesture Irigaray (2017: 65) gives voice to: a distancing from the sensory or sensitive experience, 
of an empathy or intensely close meeting of the world in the present. How the encounter will affect the 
body cannot be predicted or held within a habitual sense modality. As Josie voices, the wondering of 
the body cannot always be articulated or known following the encounter:  
Oh, I mean its I dont know ummm I dont think I had any set opinion of the Irish language to start 
out with, I, its a language and its something, a challenge to learn, it ummI suppose I dont think its 
altered my opinion as I didnt know much about it to start off with, its sort of opening my mind a lotI 
suppose maybe in a way its changed ummno I am not really sure, Im getting all confused now. But 
umm no its an interesting language to learn. 
69 Concerns have been expressed regarding the danger of Irigarays conception of wonder. Laced with Irigarays 
thinking around difference, Iris Marion Young (1997) proposes wonder can be employed to present and imagine 
the other as exotic and, in turn, legitimate an investigative and probing approach towards the other. Such as 
approach converts openness into a desire for knowledge, understanding, and mastery. These criticisms, however, 
do not consider how Irigarays conception of wonder draws from Descartes but in a movement that is turned back 
on him. Thus, whilst this may be a founded criticism of Descartes, Irigarays conception of wonder challenge this 
very potential by animating not exoticism but an alternative way of relating to the other (Groen 2016) moving 
with a transcendence that remains within the sensible world (R. Jones 2011: 113, original emphasis). 
Here, Josie suggests her encounter with the Irish language is the becoming of change in which the body 
is carried away in a kind of opening. Yet, locating this change in a specific place cannot always been 
comprehended, even if it is felt. An indirect perception of difference, moving in the event of wonder, is 
not the activity of a habitual sense modality, wherein there is a risk of paralysis. Rather, it is what 
Manning (2013: 5) refers to as amodality: a foregrounding not of the sense itself but its relational 
potential in the present. Wonder, as the experience of difference, does not reside in a singular body 
but within relational ecologies in the making.  
Wonder is the creation of a new relation that cannot be approached in term of hierarchical division and 
separation nor equal sameness. Wonder is not simply a movement in one direction, a movement towards 
the self or the other. Rather, wonder is the motivating force behind mobility is all its dimensions (Irigaray 
1993a: 73). It is a relational movement active in-between, animating an opening or interval through 
which[bodies] may relate in their irreducible difference (R. Jones 2011: 113) and, crucially, grow and 
blossom in this relation. Wonder, here, is not I am wondering but where does this movement wonder 
me, wonder us, and wonder worlds (Manning 2013: 167, original emphasis). Wonder, then, does not 
conform a wholly autonomous act of self-generation, but confirms the creative movement of birth 
repeated in encounters between two who are irreducibly different (R. Jones 2011: 113). To be affected 
by wonder is to already be in relation. A relation moving with the silence of breath. It is this silence that 
we now breathe with.  
6.3 Respir ing a Relat ional Si lence 
Sos was slowly drawing to a close and everyone was returning to their seats now full of tea, coffee, and 
biscuits. Before sos, we were once again going through the Shan and Nora story: Dirigh Nra ar a 
seacht achlog. Shiubhail s go dt an seomra folcaidh agus a h-aghaidh agus a muinel. Chuir s uirthi a 
cuid adagih agus shuibhail s sos astaighre ahus isteach go dt n chisteanach. Ars. Ars. Ars. Ars. In the 
run up to sos attention had begun to wander  the lady opposite me was doodling on the lined piece of 
paper before her, hazy eyes gaze around the room, another gentleman had become preoccupied with his 
phone, replies were given in a monotone voice and, as a collective, we had been doing our very best to 
distract Sinead and set her off on a completely unrelated topic: the Irish Language Act, nanna Pat, curry 
my yogurt, the suspension of Stormont, anything to prevent another rendition of Shan and Noras 
morning routine. Sensing the all too obvious dissolution with Shan and Nora, the second half of the class 
was focussed upon a childrens song about a beautiful yellow teddy bear who, after falling in the park 
and hurting his head and hand, had to be visited by the doctor. 
During sos, and in an unprecedented movement, Sinead had squiggled the words of the song across the 
two white boards that stood at the front of the room. 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu, 
Thit s sa phirc agus t s an-tinn. 
T s ina leaba bheag, t s ina lu, 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu. 
Ghortaigh s a cheann agus ghortaigh s a shil, 
Ghortaigh s a lmh agus ghortaigh s a ghlin. 
T s ina leaba bheag, t s ina lu, 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu. 
Thinig an dochtir i gcarr chun an t. 
C bhfuil teid beag, teid beag bu? 
T s ina leaba bheag, t s ina lu, 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu. 
Dfhach s ar a cheann agus dfhach s ar a shil, 
Dfhach s ar a lmh agus dfhach s ar a ghlin, 
T s ina leaba bheag, t s ina lu, 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu. 
To begin with Sinead voiced each line one at a time and, first, asked if we could pick out any familiar 
words. Tentative guesses were called out: Welldoesnt phirc mean park; Bu is a colour isnt it, 
yellow it think; C bhfuil is also used when asking where do you live, but in this context maybe where is 
teddy bear?; and I recognise the word lmh from the Shana and Nora story but I dont know what it 
means. After we had worked out what was happening in a verse, following the usual pattern, Sinead 
voiced the sounds and shapes of each line and, as a class, we repeated. We were slowly building up the 
song line by line, verse by verse. 
Sinead: Teid beag lainn... Ars The class: Teid beag lainn 
Sinead: teid beag bu... Ars  The class: teid beag bu 
Sinead: Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu... Ars The class: Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu 
As we went through the song, angled between the white boards and the rest of the classroom, Sinead 
moved her hand along the line pointing to the corresponding word as it was voiced. Many of us were 
preoccupied writing down words and phrases in our notebooks that lay on the desks in front of us. Rarely 
in Sineads class are we presented with Gaelic in written form and, thus, I felt a compelling need to quickly 
capture the order of the letters and the hats of the accents before they disappeared from the white board 
never to be seen again.  
Having progressed through the whole song, repeating each line after Sinead, it was now time to introduce 
a tune. Immediately, the air became filled with a nervous apprehension; we hadnt signed up for singing. 
However, with Sineads lead we tentatively and quietly began to sing the words to Teid Beag Bu.  
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu, 
Thit s sa phirc agus t s an-tinn. 
T s ina leaba bheag, t s ina lu, 
Teid beag lainn, teid beag bu. 
Ghortaigh s a cheann agus ghortaigh s a shil, 
Ghortaigh s a Ive lost it 
Hands went flying up through the air as an exacerbated body next to me slumped in an air of silence. 
Research Journal, March 3rd 2017 
Unionist politicians often speak for Gaelic. The Irish language is spoken of as a dead language. 
Paradoxically, it is labelled as a nonsensical, useless language with a dark side that threatens the 
Britishness of Northern Ireland (Moriarty 2018). In an article for the Irish Examiner, Richard Irvine (2018: 
n.p.) a Belfast-born teacher and lecturer in English and History, recalls his childhood perception of Gaelic: 
we Protestants fear Gaelic and we were raised to mock it. Irvine (2018) exemplifies this mockery 
remembering when bilingual signs appeared in the Students Union at Queens University, Belfast in the 
1980s: in anger, confusion, and insecurity, we mocked and derided the unpronounceable signs upon the 
unions wall. From a Protestant orientation the Irish language is approached through an attitude of 
mockery that seeks its derision by reducing Gaelic to a passive silence.  
Silence has traditionally been equated with violence. Hannah Arendt (1994: 308), for example, argues 
that violence begins where speech ends. Here, silence is equated with dominance and appropriation. 
Arendt claims silence denies the other a space and voice of their own appearance. Recently, an incident 
of mockery and insult occurred in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Nationalist MLAs open their address to 
the chamber with the Gaelic sentence go raibh maith agat Ceann Comhairle, which translates to thank 
you Speaker and is pronounced as gurra moy ugut conn core l-ya. The DUP MP Gregory Campbell 
appropriated this Gaelic phrase when, in 2014, he opened his address to the Assembly with curry my 
yogurt can coca coalyer (Clark 2014). In the spirit of mockery, Campbell transgressed the threshold in-
between the self and the other and lead the other to a suite in a pre-coded house of language (Irigaray 
2002b), wherein Gaelic is a priori determined to be a language of gibberish, expressed by 
appropriating the Gaelic sounds to the nonsensical phrase curry my yogurt. Campbells mockery and 
appropriation of Gaelic was a violent act of noise; an act of denying the Irish language its own voicing 
by reducing the sounds and shapes of Gaelic to a passive silence. Arendts argument, then, does not 
coalesce around silence per se but the inability of a body to have a voice, to continue in speech, due to 
the ceaseless and violent noise from an other body; a noise that annuls limits. This is not the silence that 
the body, in the middle of the childrens song Teid beag lainn, was moved to.  
Irigarays philosophical work offers an alternative conceptualisation of silence. Opposed to immediately 
relegating silence to the outcome of a violent dominance, Irigaray thinks silence in dialogue with the 
wonder of difference and embodied, relational limits or threshold.70 Silence is not what has yet to come 
to language, what is lacking in words and voice, or an ineffability undeserving of a presence in speech 
(Still 2012). Rather, Irigaray (2008a: 5) conceives of silence as the active speaking of the threshold, 
wherein speech is held in abeyance (Querrien 2006 in Manning 2011: 91) in the open, undermined, 
free movement of breath. Breath is both active and actively passive. To take a breath is to give pause, 
suspension, latency; it is to be in silence. The suspension and pause animated in breath prevent capturing 
bodies and words in complete and total visibility. Life is always-already in relation to absence (Kohn 
2013), to what it is not becoming, to the wondrous surprise maintained in silence.  
Slumped in an air of silence, the body next to me could not find the Gaelic sounds. These sounds were 
unlocatable in his body, in the movement of his breath, his tongue, his mouth. They are unfamiliar, unknown 
sounds, and despite staring down at him from the whiteboard, the sounds could not be found with his 
eyes. Faced with the mystery, surprise, and wonder of the unknown, the body was moved to silence; an 
actively-passive position sustaining the continual movement of the lively passion of not knowing. The body 
that slumped in an air of silence came to a standstill in front of the irreducibility of the other (Irigaray 
2002b: 36). He did not speak-for the other through appropriating Gaelic to an English eye or ear but 
was moved to silence in relation to the irreducibility, the unknown wonder, of the other. Silence attunes 
the body to: 
a breath that has not yet been determined or expressed in a certain way, according to certain 
rules, a certain logic, and thus can be respected and shared as life itself beyond its various 
embodiments and forms of expression (Irigaray 2013b: 221).  
Silence, like breath, is active prior to form, before the body is given a determined shape and territorial 
rooting. To encounter the other in a closeness moving the body to a slumped silence, is to manifest a 
stepping back that creates a spacing in-between the self and the other (Irigaray 2002a): I stop before 
you as before something insurmountable, a mystery, a freedom that will never be mine (Irigaray 2004a: 
8). The body is not met as a known being but is encountered in an air of wonder and enchantment that, 
in the presence of silence, becomes layered with respect, gratitude, and a value for difference. Silence 
gifts a space-time to what lies beyond the selfs limits, across the threshold, to the other whom the self 
cannot speak and can never know, to the one who is always-already unfamiliar to me (Oliver 2007). 
This is a space of letting-be, in which the other is not drained of breath (de Vries 2008) but continues to 
voice their own appearance in the wondrous and mysterious sounds and shapes of Gaelic, which are not 
halted in mockery but gifted a space-time wherein they continue to fill the air. 
70 Mirroring their use in the breadth of Irigarays thinking, I mobilise limits and threshold  and the negative, which 
is another word Irigaray advances  will little distinction and as always-already relational.  
The body moved to silence in the middle of the song had only been attending the beginners class for a 
few weeks. He was moved to an unexpected, halting silence in the middle of a sentence. As the body 
becomes more familiar with the space of Turas and encounters the Irish language in this space on a 
sustained basis, the awareness and need for silence becomes more acute. Sarah, who attends the 
intermediate class at Turas, described this need for silence: you kind of have to let it [the Irish language] 
wash through your head a wee while. Sarah, here, voices a need to almost actively sit back, to pause, 
and to be in silence as unfamiliar Gaelic sounds are encountered. This is not to move the body to 
passivity71 but an active silence responding to the call of the encounter. The slumped body moved to 
silence by the unknowable Gaelic sounds did not become passive, but quickly sat up, cocked the ear, 
and attuned to the emerging experience of being in relation. To sit back in silence and let the Gaelic 
sounds wash over the listening body, is not to engage in a closed circuit of communication but, as Manning 
(2007: 11) illustrates, is the making of reciprocal communication that is not necessarily felt or 
acknowledged through words, but through a returning of touch. Touching demands a duet; it demands 
an attunement to a feeling-with moving across experience and towards emerging, eventful encounters in 
the present. The touch of silence, then, is a relation (Kottman 2005) or, in Irigarays (2000a) words, a 
dialogue of touch  a call and response attentive to relational limits woven in-between.  
Silence marks the presence, the touch, of relational limits in-between the self and the other. Limits, on the 
hand, mark the embodied  if moving  boundary of the self that I cannot overcome; but, on the other 
hand, it acts as an announcement of the other  he or she with whom I may enter into relation (E. R. Jones 
2015: 24). Silence animates an embodied attunement-to and respect-for the other whom I cannot know. 
Irigaray (2002a: 123-125, original emphasis) writes: 
It is when we do not know the other, or when we accept that the other remains unknowable to us, 
the other illuminates us is someway but with a light that enlightens us without our being able to 
comprehend it, to analyse it, to make it ours. The totality of the othertouches us beyond all 
knowledge, all judgment, all reduction to ourselvesinsofar as the other escapes all judgment on 
our part that he or she emerges as you, always other and nonappropriable by I [P]erceiving and 
respecting the irreducibility of the otherthis opening of a world of ones own, experienced as 
familiar, in order to welcome the stranger, while remaining oneself and letting the stranger be other. 
To encounter the other as other is for ones own body to be enlightened. Life is always-always already 
in relation to absence, to silence (Kohn 2013: 212). Silence does not simply presuppose a space beyond 
ones own body, but it also respects the space and limits of the self in a movement of return or withdrawal. 
Slumped in an active silence, the only sound, the only movement, which arose from the body was the 
continued inhale and exhale of breath  an inhalation and exhalation that returns the body to itself, to 
its own space, and its own limits. Silence attunes the body both to the unknowable other but also to the 
71 A silence occurring without relation is a passive silence. Passive silence is the reduction of ones body and ones 
life to external, dominating forces. It is a return to sameness and to the violence of speaking-for. This externally 
enforced and total passive silence that Arendt names as violence. The silence I am tracing, however, is relational 
because it moves with and respects the presence of limits and threshold active in-between.    
movements of our inner breath, to the pulsation (inspiration and expiration) of life in ourselves (kof 
2018: 60).  
Learning a language starts with silence. In this silence the body is connected to the movement of their 
own breath: they draw towards the limits of the other in the movement of the exhale, only to immediately 
withdraw to the self in the inhalation. The learning of a language moves within this oscillation of 
exhalation and inhalation.

Research journal, January 17th 2017  
An active and embodied encounter with the Irish language animates moments whereby dwelling literally 
becomes rooted in the aerial practice of breathing. Here the body breathes consciously and moves in, 
and with, the vitality of its own living in the present; a living beyond or, more precisely prior to, the 
imposition of, and alignment to, the stasis of external identity constructions. The body, at least in this 
moment of conscious breath, is not compelled to dwell in a pre-determined and inherited Protestant 
orientation that is firmly rooted in definitional spaces: it does not mock or appropriate the sounds and 
shapes of Gaelic. Rather, it moves with the sounds and shapes of its own breath, prior to any imposition 
of meaning or the recognition of form  Irish or British  but always in relation to the unknown other 
whose sounds and shapes it is listening-to. The body is returned, through the silence, stillness, and 
withdrawal of inhalation, to the original potential of the first birth: to the continually blossoming of the 
to-be or, what Manning (2013: 208) calls, body-tendings. 
The blossoming of the to-be moves not with bodies per se but with body-tendings. Manning (2013: 208) 
conceives of body-tendings as rhythmic activations of a body-morphing that never precedes the event 
of their coming into relation. Body-morphing is an autonomous act animated in a relational event. In the 
oscillation between autonomy and relationality, engaged through the activity of breathing, the body 
blossoms in its own movement in relation to the worlds and bodies around it and, at the same time, 
cultivates a silence which is almost a closure or withdrawal allowing it to maintain its own movement of 
becoming, its self-same to-be that is blossoming in relation to what it cannot know (Kohn 2013). Autonomy 
necessitates relationality to be sustained as an autonomous movement, whilst relationality requires 
autonomy to prevent a collapse into dualistic dependency.  
To attune to the sounds and shapes of Gaelic is not to become like the other. The sounds and shapes 
emerging in ones own breath are not known, but neither are they copied. They are sounds and shapes 
moving differently within each different body, with every different movement of becoming, with every 
different relation: a re-duplication moving with the incipient and dynamic iteration of sound (Kohn 2013). 
In the Turas classrooms, the encountered words, phrases, and sentences were often scribbled down on 
sheets and in notebooks lying on the table in front of bodies. These words moved with the breath of that 
body, and often the letters and sounds drawn together to form the Gaelic differed from body to body, 
from notebook to notebook and, whilst maintaining a consistent shape, they moved and shifted with each 
emerging relation. Between these bodies and written sounds relational limits and silences are maintained, 
even as a closeness and intimacy are cultivated.  
Breath animates a folding in the middle where the in-between is created as the essential opposition 
between the internal and the external dissolves and the self and other are put into an intersubjective, 
relational weaving. What emerges in the blossoming of the to-be is beyond the human, object, or 
territory. What emerges is relation. This relation precedes the body it animates; a relation of incipient 
possibility, an incipient relation of autonomous blossoming in-between (Manning 2013). Irigaray (2017: 
102) herself articulates how it is in the interlacing of our bodies talking to one another that the 
transcendental matter, from which our to be takes shape, lies. The in-between is the becoming of 
difference but in proximity opposed to separation and division. An encounter moving with the silence of 
breath cannot be reduced to sameness but nor can it be thought as separation. Encountering the other in 
a relational silence of breath animates the potential for sharing.   
6.4 Sharing In-between the Breath of Mistranslat ion 
Its the final session of the danchrsa Gaelige and the four classes  bunrang a hAon, bunrang a d, 
menrang, ardrng  are in full swing. In the bunrang a d class we are moving through the different 
tenses of Irish in relation to the laethanta na seachtaine. For some of us this is new vocabulary and faced 
with looks of confusion and loss, Seamus slows the pace to spend some time going through the unfamiliar 
words. As Seamus voices each day in turn, my whole-body focusses on listening and following the different 
sounds before we together attempt to repeat what we had heard: ars, ars, ars. D Luan. D Mhirt. D 
Luan. D Mhirt. D Luan. D Mhirt. Feeling the sounds moving around the mouth: breath escaping in the 
sound of jay, the pursed lips of the loo, and the pulling back of the mouth to create the un. D 
Chadaoin. D Dardaoin. D Chadaoin. D Dardaoin. D Chadaoin. D Dardaoin. Sensing which 
sounds hold a silent presence and what sounds move together to a different tone. Jay EEN yuh. Jay SAH-
(t)hurn. Jay DO(m)H-nukh. Jay EEN yuh. Jay SAH-(t)hurn. Jay DO(m)H-nukh. Jay EEN yuh. Jay SAH-
(t)hurn. Jay DO(m)H-nukh. 
As we move with the different shapes of these unfamiliar words, my body faults in a state of surprise. It 
slowly attunes to an other sound; to sounds that have never before touched upon Gaelic tones. The feint 
rhythmic beat of a drum. Flutes breathing a dancing melody. The disciplined echo of heavily clad feet 
moving in time. DUM. DUM. D-D-D-D-D-DUM. Tootletootootootootle-tooooooto-to-totoooo
tototootle-tooo. Onetwoonetwoonetwoonetwo. Sitting still in a room in the Skainos 
centre, I move to a different world, and to a novel space that has not previously been listened-to. The two 
sounds play together; they swirl, intermingle, dance. The air fills. It expands, amplifies, and respires with 
the growing sounds of the two. Jay EEN yuh. DUM. (t)hurn. D Chadaoin.  tootootle-tooooooto-to-
to. DUM. Oneloo-un. D-D-DUM. twoonetwoonetwo. Jay DO(m)H-nukh. Then as quickly as the 
moment of crescendo, I sense a retreat as the sounds of the drums, flutes, and marching pulls back to the 
Newtownards Road. The Gaelic sounds continue to vibrate in the air  Jay LOO-in, Jay march, Jay KAY-
deen, JAY-ar-deen, Jay HEEN-yeh, Jay SA-ha-rin, Jay DOH-nee  yet they now feel slightly different.  
Research journal, September 9th 2017  
Moving with breath, the external sounds of the marching band fold inside to reach-towards the internal 
Gaelic enclave in the middle of east Belfast where the sounds of the Irish language, traditionally 
quietened and contained within the protective walls of the building, rise up to meet the melody of the 
flutes, the thunder of the bass drum, and the swagger of the marching beat. Within this aerial folding, 
the inside and the outside are put into incipient relations in-between. The in-between is a space of breath, 
a shared elemental movement wherein the two tones can interpenetrate; they can be in each other, 
while remaining perpetually distinct (Begbie 2017: 18). The sounds were not in competition, but they 
did not merely tolerate one and other nor simply make space for each other. They vibrated, pulsated, 
swirled, and danced together; a folding and entwining of matter and form in relations of attraction, 
tension, movement, and action outside the order of number and beyond accomplishment (Hill 2012). 
Together they blossomed. Free and enhanced in a shared movement that uncompromised the autonomy 
of either (Begbie 2017). They were moving in relation. Together breathing a shared vitality of giving 
and receiving, of approach and withdrawal. They moved with the relational event of autonomous 
blossoming.  
The shared space of the in-between is ungraspable in shape and form. It is neither completely material 
nor wholly incorporeal. Relations in-between the self and the other move with the event in the presence 
of its emergence to weave a groundless ground, which Irigaray (2002b: 72) conceives as an act of 
grounding which does not end in any ground. This is not a rooting to territory or predetermined, habitual 
performances of recognition but the weaving of a shared aerial synergy, which can never be partitioned 
or isolated as breath is gifted and received without demonstration, and before distinction between giver 
and receiver (Irigaray 1999a). The two touch upon one and other in this shared spacing as the air fills 
and expands in the constellation of sounds active in-between.  
To share in breath with the other is to redraw borders. Breathing animates a true sharing in-between the 
inside and the outside, which is not simply the blurring of borders but the making of an alternative 
movement in which division and separation no longer play the crucial role (R. Jones 2015). Throughout 
conversations there was an acknowledgement of the breaking down of borders and an intimate and 
embodied intertwining in-between. ine explained the breaking down of division and separation in the 
space of Turas. 
I mean I'm sure there are other projects out there doing huge...I'm not saying this is the be all and end 
all, but I just think that sort of links, that sort of creating an openness to consider the island of Ireland 
as something that you're actually part of, no matter what your identity is, you know. Sort of breaking 
down that kind of what may have been for some people a very, very rigid demarcation of what their 
geographic space was and their religious space and their cultural space and just opening up all that 
and making them, facilitating them to share with other people, people that they felt they didn't have 
anything to share. 
ine here illustrates how participating in the space of Turas, which is undoubtedly a space made from 
an alternative movement to division and separation, breaks down rigid geographical demarcations of 
territorialisation and animates an openness for sharing in-between.  
Many of the people I spoke with from Turas discussed how learning Gaelic has cultivated an openness 
to a sense of Irishness. Whilst this openness undoubtedly changes worlds, bodies do not suddenly become 
Irish. Sharing is not the blurring of identarian boundaries and borders and their territorial manifestation, 
but a movement of breath allowing for the blossoming of the to-be within and across a relational in-
between in which both participate but which does not belong simply to either (R. Jones 2015: 170, see 
also Irigaray 2008b). David, a relatively new learner at the time of our conversation, acutely 
exemplified the groundless ground of participation through appealing to the metaphor of a Venn 
diagram.  
David:  Umm, I'm not sure that I think that it's going to, err, that there will be a linkI will see 
them as, as, as two overlapping circles, if you like, but not, not ever merging Umm, well 
I don't think you do, I think, I think you, you associate the Irish language with, err, the 
history of Ireland, err, I, I don't have any problem in having the two running alongside 
each other. But I don't think it is ever going to, as I said earlier, I don't think there's ever 
going to be a coming together of the two circles. There will be an overlap. 
Ciara: Them running, running alongside, overlapping, it doesn't take away from one or the other? 
David: No, not at all, not at all, no. It's, it's, it's like a Venn diagram it sort of overlaps. But it will 
never, it will never merge. 
Here, David voices how an encounter with the Irish language creates a third world, the very spacing of 
the interval, born from the exchange of flesh and breath in-between. As David expresses, the making of 
third worlds are not a merging or blurring of border. Third worlds are not the production of sameness. 
Rather, they are spaces of sharing folding in-between.  
Sharing does not require forgoing the specificity of ones own world and ones own breath. Linda voices 
how Turas does not ask bodies to compromise who they are. Turas is a space of sharing but a sharing 
of worlds emerging in the very proximity of difference. I cannot meet, or share with, the other in my 
world for this would amount to projecting myself onto the other, an appropriation resulting in the loss of 
both the familiarity of my world and the others familiarity to their world. Thus, what is needed, what is 
created in the encounter respectful of relational limits, is a third world in-between the self and the other 
in which both participate while remaining autonomous in their own bodies and worlds (Irigaray 2008a). 
Third worldings cultivate a distance of autonomy in the proximity of relationality in-between the two 
(Alfonso 2011) or, as Rachel Jones (2015: 162) writes, a space-time shared inseparably between one 
and another even as it is the condition of the relations that differentiate them. Encounters composed from 
a sharing of breath are the making of moments moving in-between and across shifting borders which, as 
Hannah illustrates, undoes the dominance of borders and boundaries. 
I mean I would be very much Northern Irish you know, because Ive a UK passport, I dont have an 
Irish one but I have an American one, but if I didnt have an American one then I would have an Irish 
one, you know I would be both. So, you know I am more Irish thanI dont know, the whole political 
thing, I just try to ignore it because it is too complicated to make a call, and more to the point it doesnt 
even matter. 
Making this call is no longer what is important; borders and separation no longer play the constitutive 
role (R. Jones 2015: 170). Having actively felt and participated in the making of moments in-between, 
desire resides in continuing to move with the openness of these in-between worldings; what becomes 
important is the experience, the sensations, and intimacy of sharing in itself. A sharing of (mis-)translations 
folding in-between.  
6.4.1 The miscoordination of a messy translation in -between 
No, you cant say you love your dog, it just doesnt make sense. Is gr liom thu is how we voice our 
love specifically for people. 
Act One 
Setting the scene: A group of learners are sitting in the larger of Turas two classrooms. It is the first 
class back after the two-week Easter break. When the class arrived earlier in the evening, they we 
were not met by the friendly, comforting calls of Sineads voice, but by a new, unfamiliar body. This 
new body stands solitary at the front of the classroom, before placing a chair centre stage in the 
middle of the horseshoe arrangement of desks and tables. He waits for complete silence before he 
begins to speak.  
Act Two 
Setting the scene: The initial coldness from the beginning of the class has dissipated and bodies have 
relaxed. It is ten minutes before the end of the class and Liam is moving around the desk asking if 
there were any queries regarding the new vocabulary.  
A heated discussion begins to grow stage right, the other bodies sat around the desk begin to look 
up and become engrossed in the altercation  the tension from the beginning of the class suddenly 
returns. 
Boy: But why? 
Liam: It just doesnt make sense. 
Boy: Why doesnt it make sense? 
Liam: Because is is gr liom thu is how we express our love specifically for people, it cannot be used 
for inanimate objects or for your dog, your cat, or your cow. Nor for a plant, tree, or flower. 
Boy: But I can say is gr liom madra, I love dogs, there I have said it. 
Liam: It can of course be said, but it doesnt make sense. 
(Sensing the altercation had drawn in other eyes and ears, Liam moves back to a central position 
and addresses the whole room). 
Liam: You all know that well known phrase dont try to teach your Grandmother to suck eggs, well 
this phrase doesnt exist in Irish. A direct translation can be made but it doesnt make sense. And it 
works both ways. Take the Gaelic saying an tuan ag mineadh melai da mhathair. This phrase 
cannot be directly translatable into Barla, I suppose a mistranslation would be the lamb teaches its 
mother how to bleat. 
(All other bodies stare at Liam silently, with perplexed expression as they process what theyve 
heard). 
 Liam: Now your perspective has been opened. 
Based on research journal, April 25th 2017  
Irish and English are two different languages. The sentence construction of the Irish language, the 
different sounds, and the creation of meaning are not directly translatable to the English language; 
between the two does not exits a predetermined perfection wherein the two languages and their worlds 
are captured within a unified, singular system of knowledge, understanding, and practice. As an act 
folding in-between Gaelic and the English, translation is a messy process of jarring juxtaposition and 
miscommunication (Tsing 2015: 217). Miscommunication is not known in advance but felt and sensed in 
the event of the present: in the rising of tension of the classroom; in the raised tones voicing the altercation 
between Liam and the boy; and in the boys persistent and confused questioning of why. 
The act of translation in-between changes worlds and bodies (Tsing 2015). In another class, Sinead told 
us about the Irish language Terminology Committee in Dublin  comprised of academics, writers, and 
terminologist  tasked with creating new official Irish words. Through the messy process of 
miscoordination, around 3,000 new Irish words are created each year. A recent word translated into 
Irish is spooning, which has been translated to spnil. Whilst this is clearly a Gaelicisation of the English 
term, the board also produced a more descriptive version luigh tin le gabhal which literally translates 
as bum to crotch. Here, we can acutely see the messy, miscoordination between the two languages and 
the desire to preserve this jarring messiness by refusing a simple Gaelicisation of the English word.72 
Another recently translated word is Brexit, which created some controversy among the committee with 
some member stating they would be inclined to use the English words as it is. Yet, common translations of 
Brexit include Sasamach, which is a joining together of Sasana + amach meaning England + out, 
and Bral which is an amalgamation of Breatain + al meaning Britain + escape (N Aodha 
2018). Here, it is clear to see the miscoordination between Gaelige and the Barla and how the two 
languages mobilise slightly different understandings, meanings, and perspectives.  
Back at Turas, Sinead spoke of how her friendship group would create their own translations. She told 
us how her friends would be sitting around socialising and in the middle of a conversation they would be 
forced to revert to Bearla as there was no Irish for the word needed. When this happened, the present 
bodies would together create a term that would then become common within their friendship group. 
Sinead used the example of Memory Stick, saying among her friends they refer to it as a cluiche 
meaitsela leictreach, which can loosely be translated to electric matchstick. She stated an official Gaelic 
name for a Memory Stick has now been produced, but that among her friends they continue to use the 
words they created in their intimate and creative moment of translation that is neither proper to each 
nor common to the two (Irigaray 2004a: xiii).  
The act of translation is a continuous and novel making. Liam noted this creation when, after giving voice 
to the miscoordination in-between Gaelic and English, he voiced: now your perspective has been opened. 
72 This is to move against the anglicisation of Irish place names that took place as part of Britains colonisation of 
the island of Ireland.  
This is a perception of depth (Kohn 2013: 98), which does not reside with the self or the other but folds 
in-between to create something that is shared. Relations of miscoordination animate a common in-
between. Yet, as soon as the common becomes common, when it becomes custom, we lose the 
miscoordination of the common. The common, then, is not the production of a defined community through 
external relations of consensus, but the making of a commoning that never becomes common as it 
continues to respire with the living vitality of the to-be.  
Sharing is dependent upon staying with the tension between autonomy and relationality, opposed to 
negating messiness in an act of perfected unity that fall into either extreme (Kohn 2013), which can only 
ever result in a return to sameness. We needed to stop searching for the perfect translation from Irish to 
English to Irish, and resist questioning why this translation is not possible. Instead, we need to become 
comfortable within the messy and jarring space of the in-between, and respectful of the relational limits 
this brings to light. It is in the disorientating comfort of miscoordination that a different looking-with and 
listening-to is created. As Irigaray (2004c: 399) writes: 
And if we see differently when we look together, as two, at the same landscape, it is not because 
a visible has been added; it is because we look differently when we share looking at...my gaze, 
whether I want it to or not, whether I perceive it or not, sees differently if I am not alone looking in 
the present. My perception itself is modified because it is shared with the other. This cannot be 
explained by the sharing of a doubling or by a mutual consenting to resemblance, but because 
flesh [and breath] circulates between the world and me, between the other and myself.  
An encounter composed from breath folding in-between the inside and the outside, animates a shared 
space-time in which the self and other look and listen together and, in doing so, cultivate change and 
transformation. Bill gives voice to the transformation of listening together. 
Bill has been attending Turas for several years. He first began to learn Irish in Donegal, which was his 
first post as a Presbyterian minister. The classes he attended in Donegal were run by a local priest, but 
on returning to Belfast and having a much larger congregation, Bill speaks of how his Irish kind of 
withered away. Bill is currently Deputy Clerk of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland General Assembly 
and, thus, now he keeps regular office hours that allow him to attend Irish language classes as Turas 
where, at the time of our conversation, he was working towards an Irish language GCSE. Bill alluded to 
the difference of looking and listening together when we spoke.  
Well it's just, you know, the different idioms that languages have, umm, I mean you've got this bit in 
Irish where you don't say I have something, you say it's at me. And your hair is on you, and that, those 
prepositions and the way they work if you, you know, a different perspective on even how to think of 
how you use your English, you know, and why does English express it that way and another language 
expresses it a different way... Umm, so you know, that, that, I think it enables you to, to understand 
your life maybe, maybe that's too grand, but because the different languages express the same thing 
but in totally different ways there's more than one way of looking at things. You know, but that's, I 
think it broadens your horizons that way. 
Bill illustrates how in moving in-between the body touches upon the awareness that there is not a singular, 
consenting perception or a perfect translation speaking for both the Irish and English language. Bill 
indicates to share in moments of miscoordination animates a change that broadens your horizons. 
Worlds are not in isolation. Their specificity cannot be the result of a prior logic of separation nor of an 
externally imposed rational consensus or likeness, but an effect of the [mis-]convergence in the folding 
of breath in-between (Tsing 2015: 218). Consensus cannot be imposed in a messy process of 
miscoordination. Translation, rather, is a kind of mixed-up act that does not simply maintain difference 
but moves hand and hand with the eruption of difference (Tsing 2015: 217), wherein consensus becomes 
dissensus  the realisation that I am not yet (Manning 2007: 14). What is shared in-between worlds 
and bodies in-between, what is in-common, is the making of incipient possibility. 
6.4.2 An Ir ish enclave 
Turas is undoubtedly a space of sharing transforming borders, boundaries, and limits as new peaceful 
worlds and shared futures are woven in-between. However, these moments and the shared worlds they 
animate are by no means ubiquitous or constant; they remain fleetingly speculative. Bodies engaging in 
spaces of shared encounter return to acutely territorialised, segregated, and divided worlds. Consciously 
aware or not, this is never the same body returning to the same world. Yet, embodied micro-political 
movements of transformation are accompanied by the erection of novel borders and boundaries, as the 
body falls prey to the pervasive dualism of Northern Irelands territorialised stasis. 
Entering the Skainos Building, up the three flights of stairs, and onto the corridor where the Turas office 
and classrooms are located, is to move across a threshold and enter into a different world. The threshold 
between the space of Turas and the space of east Belfast marks a dividing border enclosing the internal 
in one space and the external in a different space. Joan acutely brought my attention to the borders 
surrounding Turas.73 Joan is a small, middle-aged woman approaching retirement, who attended the 
same Tuesday night beginners language class I attended. She comes across as a very committed and 
dedicated learner, who has a quiet but undeniable passion for the Irish language. Joans father was 
born in South Wales and was a fluent Welsh speaker but, living in Northern Ireland, his children were 
not taught Welsh. Joan spoke of how her inability to speak and communicate in Welsh divorced her from 
her Welsh heritage  from her Welsh family, from Welsh culture and tradition, and from the very ground 
and soil of Wales. Joan explained how this feeling of separation and disconnection extended to Northern 
Ireland and the broader island of Ireland, due to her inability to speak Irish. Her desire for an embodied 
and active connection to her everyday space prompted a movement towards Turas. Joan lives in east 
Belfast and, thus, attending Turas does not require crossing any geographical borders. Yet, speaking 
about the space of Turas, Joan likened Turas to the Vatican City, describing it as a separate and 
73 The conversation Joan and I had was the only interview I conducted that, at Joans request, was not recorded. I 
took notes during the interview, but these notes were not verbatim and, thus, whilst grounded in what Joan said, 
the conversation here is retold through my words.  
bounded Irish space in the heart of Loyalist, British east Belfast that many local people not only avoid, 
but look upon with suspicion and even anger. 
As an organisation, Turas extends far beyond the Skainos centre. Turas is a non-profit organisation and, 
in order to secure continued funding, the classes offered are promoted widely throughout Belfast and 
there is constant attempt to establish broad connections and networks across Northern Ireland and further 
afield. Linda often partakes in topical radio talk shows and has given several interviews across a variety 
of formats. Invites to Unionist politicians, especially those cautious of the Irish language, are always 
extended. Turas has also appeared on televised news features, usually addressing the stalemate in 
Stormont, aired in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, and has been the subject 
of numerous newspaper articles both north and south of the border. Linda and Gareth engage in 
outreach work across Belfast and further afield, running heritage sessions exploring the historic links 
between Protestants and the Irish language, as well as discussions and workshop around the relevance 
of Gaelic to modern Northern Irish society. Turas has established close relationships with other Gaelic-
based organisations and Irish language schools in Belfast, and with the Gaeltacht in Donegal and Kerry.  
At the beginning of every academic year, a group of volunteers pound the streets of east Belfast, 
including the Catholic territory of Short Strand, with leaflets advertising the classes available at Turas. 
Although the majority of Turas learners are from the wider area of east Belfast or other areas marked 
as belonging to the Protestant, Unionist, and Loyalist community, very few of the learners are from the 
immediate locale. I asked Linda about the difficulty in engaging with the immediate locale. 
Ciara:  Do you think, is there many very local people who do attend? 
Linda:  Well they were all very local at first, but umm, not as much now. 
Ciara:  And Short Strand obviously has always been a hard place for you to kind of tap into, even 
though Patrick has tried for a number of years. 
Linda:  Yeah. Still most of them still come from east Belfast when we look at their addresses,74 
umm, but it's kinda Greater East Belfast now, you know, where at first they were all really 
local. 
With little engagement from the immediate surrounding and, despite best efforts, Turas feels like a 
bordered enclave separate from the rest of east Belfast, a little bit of Irishness in the middle of all 
thiseast Belfast tradition (Josie). Turas is notably separated from the character, the spirit, the people, 
74 As a requirement of funding, Turas must disclose to funders the number of learners coming from a Protestant 
background and the number of learners coming from a Catholic background. However, Turas does not directly ask 
learners to specify their territorial identity but they do, on new learners forms that are re-submitted at the 
beginning of every academic year, ask for addresses alongside a series of other information. Whilst I was 
volunteering at Turas, I was asked to go through these forms for the latest academic year, compile a database of 
the Turas learners and, based on their address, mark each learner as Catholic or Protestant. Clearly this is not the 
most accurate way of getting this data and neither does it give learners an option to opt out of Catholic or 
Protestant categorisation. It reinforces the assumption that every body is Catholic or Protestant and that this 
recognition resides statically in territorial rooting. Yet, this detail is never voiced in classes and it is used once a 
year for producing statistics and, so, I maintain encounters within the space of Turas are not framed by the Catholic 
or Protestant narrative, even if the space cannot wholly escape processes of bodily categorisation and naming.  
and the atmosphere of the territory in which it is located. This separation and division are also replicated 
in the silence people adopt when they return to their inherited worlds. 
Turas is a space of sustained encounter yet the moments of sharing active within this space are perhaps 
only fleeting and speculative in terms of their wider potential. In the telling of her story, Joan voiced a 
secrecy around her engagement with Turas and the Irish language more broadly. She described how 
she whispers about learning Irish and only into the ears she knows to be sympathetic. Turas may be a 
space shared in-between but this sharing does not always extend externally to other spaces and worlds. 
Joan situated the capacity to be open about learning Irish in the current political context, expressing how 
her whispers have become increasingly hushed with the current political contention.  
On the 20th May 2017, An Dream Dearg organised a march and rally in Belfast in support of the Irish 
Language Act (see figure 23). Turas took part in the March and Joan went along with Turas to show her 
support for the Act. During the march Joan turned around to survey the scene behind her. She spoke in 
awe and disbelief as her gaze was met with Sinn Fin, including Gerry Adams, who happened to be 
marching directly behind Turas. Joan exclaimed this was the closest she had ever been to a Shinner. 
The An Dream Dearg march moved along the Falls Road in west Belfast, before a rally was held in front 
of Belfast City Hall. Moving into west Belfast and marching next to Sinn Fin was a novel experience for 
Joan and illustrates how attending Turas animates a movement in which borders, boundaries, and division 
no longer play a fundamental role (R. Jones 2015). Yet, as Joan brought the story to a close, almost as 
an afterthought but tainted with a notable sadness, she said her husband still does not know she took 
part in the march.  
The quietness and secrecy surrounding Turas, and the intimate borders and separations these constructs, 
was a recurring theme throughout conversations. Karl spoke how he didnt even tell his parents he was 
going to do it [learn Irish]. Just as Joan said she would only tell people who she knew would be 
sympathetic, when I asked Josie whether she told many people about her engagement with Gaelic she 
replied: 
I probably dontIm probably careful who I would tell which is ridiculous. Umm I know one person 
who I use to work with in the hospital and umm andyou know he would say what do you want to 
learn that for? you know, yet hes the one who is very interested in townlands75so therefore, excuse 
me, you said you are not interested in the Irish language but youre very interested in townlands but 
where do you think they all came from, you know they came from the Irish, I suppose so and then end 
of conversation. 
75 Townlands are the smallest administrative unit of the land based on the traditional territorial division of the 
country into counties, baronies, parishes and townlands (Nash 1999: 468). The townland system is a distinguishable 
mark of Ireland which distinguish it from the England, Wales and Scotland. The names of townlands being of Gaelic 
origin.  
It is these negative responses that compel the hushed quietness surroundings a bodys commitment and 
love of the Irish language, as exemplified by Rosie. 
But I mean where I live, in the local shop where we get our newspaper, I mean it is only in the lastsix, 
seven months that we could order an Irish News.76I wouldnt tell a lot in the shop, I wouldnt say I was  
76 The Irish News is a daily newspaper based in Belfast reporting all the latest from Northern Ireland and 
international news stories, including GAA sport, opinion, business, and family notices. Whilst it features Unionist 
columnists, it is broadly regarded to portray a Nationalist viewpoint explaining the difficulty in accessing the 
newspaper from Protestant territory.

going learning Irish, Im still too frightened cause there are still too many who are of the mind-set that 
theyre fenians,77 thats all youre going to get. 
Rosie, here, roots secrecy in the predetermined, territorial narrative surrounding the Irish language, and 
in the contextual expectations that regulate bodies and their coexistence (Valentine 2008), which mark 
an engagement with the Irish language as deviant. Gareth, who works for Turas and began learning the 
Irish language at the time of the Troubles, also feels this regulation. 
And then the thing is can you speak Irish in the building, and you can speak it on the phone in the car 
park I think people just think there's an Irish Language Centre somewhere in the attic, you know. And 
they talk Irish and that's it, but umm we don't really, do you know, umm, it's, it's not that we go into all 
the shops and tell everyone we're, I work for the Irish Language Centre.  
Gareth alludes to the borders surrounding the space of Turas by suggesting Irish can only be spoken in 
the enclave of this space and not beyond it. Irish is acceptable or tolerated in the boundaries of Turas, 
but beyond these boundaries the territory is Protestant and this space, along with the bodies rooted 
within it, are orientated as distant from Irish culture. Gareth also refers to the position of Turas as an 
attic, which exemplifies the separation of Turas from the streets of east Belfast. Despite working for 
Turas, carrying out many outreach activities, and being a committed and passionate supporter of the 
Irish language, Gareth approaches this commitment with a hushed quietness stating he does not broadcast 
where he works.  
The silences surrounding a bodys engagement with Turas, are mirrored in an activity of self-policing. 
Laura, for example, discussed how she does not wear her Turas hoodie outside of her own home. 
Do you know I have a Turas hoodie and I don't wear it like outside of my house? I mean I would wear 
it down here and I would wear it in town but I'm not sure...like I live, well I'm like a street away, I could 
probably get away with it but I'm conscious that I live in east Belfast. 
The Loyalist and Protestant character of east Belfast prevents Laura from wearing her Turas hoodie in 
this area and compels her to submit to the territorial identity of the area, with the result her engagement 
with Turas is silenced. In a similar vein, Gareth spoke about immediately washing off green face paint 
on returning to east Belfast after the St Patricks Day Parade. 
I remember one day we went to St Patricks Day Parade and we had green paint all over our faces. 
And then we came back and the first thing we all did was go to the toilets and take the green paint off. 
You know, because you're still, umm, Protestant. 
Both Laura and Gareth illustrate whilst it is safe to engage with the Irish language in the enclave of Turas 
or even in the safety of the city centre, they do not feel comfortable to visibly portray this engagement 
in east Belfast because, as Gareth stated, you're still, umm, Protestant. Wearing a Turas hoodie or 
77 Fenian is a derogatory label used to designate someone from the Catholic community. The term comes from the 
Gaelic finne, which is the singular form of fiann meaning band of warriors. The Fenian Brotherhood was founded 
in American is 1858, as a sister organisation to the Irish Republican Brotherhood organised in Dublin and, together, 
they sought to remove the British presence from the island of Ireland (Kenny 2006). This Irish Republican 
Brotherhood are closely linked to the IRA and, thus, the movement referred to as the Fenians tends to encompass a 
series of Irish Republican organisations both in Ireland and America.   
walking around with green face paint is not an available performance from a Protestant orientation. 
Thus, bodies engage in an activity of self-policing, whereby they filter out movements of messy 
translation, miscoordination, and dissensus across multiple worlds, as they realign to territorial 
orientations scripted from within the pervasive, binary identity constructions of Catholic or Protestant. 
Speaking with husband and wife, Mark and Mary, the conversation of wearing Turas t-shirts and hoodies 
outside of the enclave of Turas was also was touched upon. 
Mary: We both just bought the t-shirt. 
Mark:  I am not going to wear it until I can speak more than six words mind you (laughing). 
Ciara:  Its funny and for me this was not something I had previously had to think about, but I was 
like can I wear this [the Turas t-shirt] going to the gym here and I had this dilemma, I could 
wear it going to the gym at home [Bristol] and it would be no issue at all and, also, I was 
slightly hesitant as to whether it would be something I would want to get into a conversation 
about. It was weird as I would wear it at home without any question, but I wasnt too sure 
here. 
Mary:  Yeah and I think I would feel the same. 
Mark:  Yep, I think Ill wear it whenever I can string more than the first opening sentences together. 
Mary:  But would you wear it in Carrickfergus?78 
Mark:  Yes, yes. 
Mary:  Would you.  
Mark:  Yes, because I am actually doing something that I feelI want to be proud of and content 
with. I mean I was doing something the other day and I went maith thu out loud you know 
and they kind of looked at me. Then I phoned you from the airport the other day and I said 
cad  mar at t? on the phone and a guy sort of looked at me, what language is that 
you are speaking, cad  mar at t? you said agus t fin I said ta me gmoy and 
that was the end of the conversation, that was about as far as we could get as that is about 
all we know. But actually, that was special. 
Similar to Laura, Mary and I both agreed we would have a slight hesitancy with regards to wearing the 
Turas t-shirt around Belfast due to the territorial nature of the city, and because of the current controversy 
surrounding Turas and the Irish language. Mark in contrast is adamant, even when pushed by Mary, he 
would wear the Turas t-shirt  even in Carrickfergus  once he can speak more than six words. Mark 
78 Carrickfergus is a large town located on the Antrim coast, approximately eleven miles north of Belfast. In the 
2011 census, 9.56% of the 39,144 (approx.) people living in Carrickfergus identified as belonging to or being 
brought up in the Catholic religion, whilst 79.27% identified as belonging to or as brought up in a Protestant and 
Other Christian (including Christian related) religion. Additionally, 76.55% indicated that they had a British national 
identity, 5.34% stated an Irish national identity, and 30.28% a Northern Irish identity (Northern Ireland Statistics 
and Research Agency 2012). At one time Carrickfergus had a larger Catholic population, but in 1999 the South 
East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) waged a campaign to remove the Catholic community and those in 
mixed (Catholic-Protestant) marriages from the area. This campaign resulted in violence and acts of intimidation 
towards the Catholic members of the town (The Irish Times 1999), with a consequence the Catholic population 
diminished as the British, Protestant, and Loyalist nature of the town was fortified.   
spoke about how special it was when he rang Mary and the first words of their conversation were spoken 
as Gaeilge. Mark here did not police his action in accordance to his territory and he speaks of wanting79 
to be proud and content of his engagement with the Irish language irrespective of his background and 
territorial rooting. He does not want to filter out this internal and embodied contentedness but wants to 
move with it and with the moments of miscoordination that arise from moving across and in-between 
different worlds. Whilst this is not to say Mary, Gareth, Laura or myself are not proud or content with 
our engagement with Turas, it is to say that moments of translation and miscommunication will increase in 
prevalence when community and sharing is not approached from a consensus whole but from an incipient 
dissensus, moving with the miss-coordinating, jarring difference of living vitality. 
An engagement in-between, at least in the case of Turas, constructs new borders and novel division 
between bodies. However, these borders are shifting and more fluid that the territorial borders 
fragmenting Northern Ireland. The Turas bubble is not rooted in territory. It is a bubble that has been 
filled with the generative relations of breath; an aerial ecology free to float through the air, wherein 
there is always the potential for transformative collisions and shared encounters. For example, many of 
the learners at Turas have: attended intensive Irish language summer courses at different Irish language 
schools and centres in various parts of Belfast; visited An Cultrlann, an Irish language, arts and cultural 
centre, in the heart of West Belfast, on the Falls Road; travelled and spent time in the Donegal and Kerry 
Gaeltacht; marched in the St. Patricks Day Parade or the An Dream Dearg; and attended Irish language 
events across Belfast. These movements extend the shared in-between space of Turas beyond its enclave, 
to displace a territorial way of being with an incipient aerial way of moving through space. 
6.5 Conclusion: An ecological horizon  
To move with breath is to realise peace-as-peace cannot arise within a horizon grounded in the stasis of 
territorial roots, mass orientations, and genealogical lineage; a horizon rooted in the activity of relational 
dependence. Nor will peace be created in a horizon of equality wherein worlds fall back into sameness, 
either via equivalence or equal separation. Peace in Northern Ireland, and perhaps beyond, needs to 
return to breath and become attentive to the emerging micro-political relationality that is always-
already shaping, if only speculatively, the makings of peace-as-peace. In dialogue with Irigaray, this 
chapter has moved with wonder, silence, and sharing to detail what happens in an encounter mediated 
by breath. 
Turas is a space firmly grounded in the violent and segregated legacy lived in post conflict Northern 
Ireland. Yet, Turas also exceeds and challenges the dualistic grammars of this legacy. It is not a space 
79 Mark states he wants to be proud and content of his engagement with the Irish language and with Turas. The 
word want is interesting in this context: potentially Mark could have selected the word want because, at the time 
of the interview, he had only been attending Turas for a few weeks or it could potentially demonstrate he does 
not yet feel wholly comfortably with his movement towards Turas but wants to feel proud and content with his 
engagement. 
of contact framed by predetermined acts of recognition wherein bodies are always-already labelled 
as Catholic or Protestant. Rather, Turas respires and inspires in breath, as bodies meet in a respiration 
folding in-between the external and the internal to share in the autonomous movement of becoming. This 
is not a movement of consensus or sameness but a movement of dissensus making worlds, bodies, and 
relations that in their emergence are unlocatable in the Catholic-Protestant horizon.  
To encounter the other in breath is to create an alternative horizon. The inhalation of breath is a 
movement of withdrawal. Withdrawal animates a non-hierarchical verticality that is the blossoming and 
wonder of the bodys own autonomy. Yet, this withdrawal is always-already an exhalation. It is always-
already moving with a silence folding in-between. The in-between is a relational spacing moving 
horizontally to prevent hierarchy, dependency, and separation. To be transfixed in an intimate respect 
for the wonder of the other, is to be carried back to, and beyond, the movement of ones own becoming; 
horizontality is always-already moving with the vertical both in its prior and future movements (Irigaray 
2017 seminar). Encountering the other in wonder, silence, and sharing  in the movement, materiality, 
and intimacy of breath  is the making of a future horizon in which verticality and horizontality fold and 
entangle in their emergence.80 The creation of a novel, shared horizon, then, depends on respiring 
oscillations in-between the vertical and the horizontal, in-between proximity and difference, and in-
between autonomy and relationality.  
Turas respires with the in-between to open onto a shared future horizon. To encounter the other in the 
movement of breath folding in-between the internal and the external, is not to construct a predetermined 
world. How this sharing manifests and the worldings, bodies, and relations it animates cannot be known 
as they move with a new horizon residing in the groundless ground of the future. Yet, as Turas illustrates, 
the future of this horizon is immanent (Anderson 2006); it is a future that is living in the present (Kohn 
2013). Although this immanent not yet cannot displace the stasis of Northern Ireland, it is the disruption 
of what is opening onto the hope of a different future moving beyond, or rather, before the imposition 
of dualistic form. What emerges in a shared encounter of breath is the making of speculative, dynamic 
and shared worldings that refuse categorisation. 
Political action cannot aim for stability-as-stasis, for the maintenance of what is, wherein peace can only 
ever be the less-than-violent or non-violent. Yet, neither can it reside in designing what has never before 
been experienced. The making of peace respires with micropolitical actions choreographing an 
entangling in-between the vertical and the horizontal. This is the becoming of an ecological horizon 
wherein the blossoming of living vitality, of the wonder-full and wondering to-be of the body, is mutually 
constitutive. This is not a concern of identity and its politics, but an attentiveness to the dynamic 
relationality from which the making of shared, peaceful worlds may be actualised. Peace cannot be 
80  Irigaray (see 2000a: 18) refers to this folding in-between verticality and horizontality as horizontal 
transcendence, which she argues is necessary to maintain relational limits and wonder in-between and, so, the 
potential for the encounter.  
engaged with as an endpoint to be achieved. Rather, peace is an embodied, relational project of making 
in a sharing of breath in-between. 
The next chapter moves within the ecological horizon of breath. This horizon does not start with a 
conception of difference reduced to dualistic and hierarchical grammars of difference, wherein agonism 
and violence hold the original position. It is an aerial, ecological horizon, where difference is a shared 
movement of wonder, blossoming, and transformation; where differences become unremarkable, 
everyday and breathable (Ye 2016: 81, my emphasis). To move within this immanent, if speculative, 
horizon is to alter the preoccupation of research. We can no longer purely be concerned with instances 
of violence, while this undoubtedly remains important. Such a preoccupation misses what else is already 
active in living worlds and living futures or, rather, has always-already reduced the what else to 
instances of violence. This preoccupation will be the failure of peace-as-peace. To truly commit to peace, 
we need to move with the alternative horizon composed from encounters sharing in breath, wherein there 
is a potential for everyday gestures of kindness, trust, respect, friendship, and care.

KILL All TAIGS. 
81 Tadgh (pronounced ti+gue) is a Gaelic boys name historically popular with Irish speakers but with a broad 
presence across the island of Ireland, especially in the south-west. Tadgh is commonly accepted to mean poet or 
storyteller. Due to its close association with Gaelic, Tadgh became a synecdoche for Irish Gaelic man and resulted 
in sayings such as Tadhg an mhargaidh (Tadhg of the market) or Tadhg na sride (Tadhg of the street). The 
synonymity between Tadgh and an Irish Gaelic man mobilised Taigh (pronounced teague) as a derogatory term 
for Catholics during the Troubles. The slogan Kill All Taigs (KAT) could be found branded on walls across Northern 
Ireland at the time of conflict and still, today, KAT will be brandished in graffiti in Loyalist areas, marked onto the 
bonfires lit on the 11th night, and even painted onto childrens faces for celebrations such as the 12th (see Belfast 
Telegraph 2014). As a boys name, Tadgh has almost completely died out in Northern Ireland where it is still 
recognised as a religious slur. There are similar derogatory terms for Protestants, such as Hun and Jaffa. Hun 
derives from a term association with German soldiers during the Second World War, with connotation of inhumane 
and barbaric treatment of others. The term Jaffa is the name of the fruit orange and references the Protestant and 
Loyalist association with the Orange Order (Stewart 2010). 
Breathing a Speculative Ethics of Care 
7. 1 Introduct ion 
In Western tradition, reasoning and rationality have been understood and operationalised as the ability 
of the human being to dominate and tame all that is external to the consciousness of the subject. In To be 
Two, Irigaray (2000a: 70) poses the question: is History not simply the other name for mans intolerance 
toward nature? She continues by arguing the world and sociality, as constructed by man, reflects a 
history of enduring violence, of appropriation, of domination, and not of a contribution of what is 
(Irigaray 2000a: 73). Man places himself  as the singular, esteemed subject  on (t)his earth in a circle 
woven of violence and dismay, thus closing every opening (Irigaray 2000a: 74). This circle of violence 
erases the potential for reciprocal relations,82 constructing worlds within predetermined relations of 
assimilation, appropriation, or dependency. Agonism is essential for bringing to light the continued 
structures, experiences, and realities of violence and domination continuing to plague society. However, 
to remain in agonism perpetuates the (masculine) circle erected through violence and decay by having 
always-already foreclosed every opening  every possibility for peace, care, and sharing  in the 
originary position mans dominance guarantees for violence. Ethical relations will not be found in a world 
in which man only produces and invents with other bodies and with nature when he seeks their taming 
(Irigaray 2000a). The theoretical and empirical possibility of peace lies in a future horizon created in a 
sharing of breath.  
A future, ethical horizon must address the nature-culture dualism. Agonism will only fail to hold a founding 
position when the violent split between nature-culture, subject-object, is reconceived. As Irigaray (2000a: 
100) writes:  
Always separated or reduced to a single embrace or to a single deluge, always divided between 
one who is subject and one who is object, one who is active and one who is passive, one who has 
intention and one who remains nature and experiences it, we have not built a between-us. 
The relationality I read to be at the heart of Irigarays ontology circumvents the split of Western logic, 
the split between nature and culture, to animate a new horizon of difference from hierarchical sameness. 
An aerial ecology does not merely encompass human bodies but animates an elemental relationality in-
82 Although undoubtedly drawing from Levinas philosophy (see Chanter 1995; Grosz 1989; Ince 1996; Irigaray 
1986, 1993a, 1991; Joy 2006; Whitford 1991a), Irigarays ethics stems as much from her frustrations with Levinas 
as from her admiration. One of Irigarays prime frustrations culminates around the lack of reciprocity in Levinas 
ethics. Levinas engineers a foundation of non-reciprocal proximity to advance the selfs passive obligation to, and 
responsibility for, the irreducible and unknowable other (see Levinas 1987, 1998; Lingis 1998; Morgan 2007). 
Transcendence, thus, is understood as beyond relationality and exterior to the body. To locate otherness within the 
self would, for Levinas (1969: 35-36), destroy the other: the intended transcendence would be thus reabsorbed 
into the unity of the system, destroying the radical alterity of the other. A non-reciprocal proximity potential 
preserves an originary position for difference and otherness. Yet, in doing so it elevates the other to such an 
extreme exteriority the possibility for sharing and for a carnal proximity is precluded (Del Gatto 2015). Positioning 
otherness beyond a sensuous and sensible encounter approaches the other as pure, nude, empty (Joy 2006: 68) 
or, as Irigaray (2000a: 28) writes, equivocation. For an ethical relation in-between, a felt and sensuous reciprocal 
proximity is integral. 
between nature and culture, and in-between human and non-human bodies. To multiply worlds and put 
difference at the forefront destabilises a one-sided, phallocentric conception of nature and animates 
nature and culture as dynamic (Thiele 2014b).  
Irigarays ontology can be framed as a renaturalisation.83 Her ontology is an interlacing of the cultural 
and the natural, wherein the very subjectivity of the body is housed in nature and its elements. 
Nature represents possible inter-worlds  it belongs to all living beings and to none In fact, nature, 
as a space of life, must serve the becoming of each one as well as a coexistence in difference. 
Nature is a universal that is shareableand can thus be of use in mediating between all (Irigaray 
2008a: 66-67). 
To situate the body as living is, for Irigaray (2015b), the first ecological gesture  a gesture that is 
always-already relational. A living body moves among other living bodies in an environment, an ecology, 
wherein life can blossom. In this ecology all bodies are active, and all bodies have intention. Irigaray 
(2017: 2) writes how a vegetal environment can thus assist the new-born in assuming its life and entering 
a more peaceful world that, furthermore, takes care of its more essential good: its breath. Breath is the 
entwining of nature and culture, of the human and the non-human; breath is a commoning in-between. 
What must be cared for in shared worlds is the commoning of breath in-between naturecultures.  
Opposed to starting from subjects, the building of shared worlds requires starting from what is living. To 
cultivate a wisdom of renaturalisation is, for Hasana Sharp (2011: 5), to have found a new appreciation 
of ourselves as parts of nature, operating according to the same rules as anything else, invariably 
dependent upon infinitely many other beings, human and nonhuman. Starting from what is living returns 
culture to nature and nature to culture, and entwines the spiritual and the natural. Culture cannot be the 
overcoming or taming of nature. Nature is not a point of origin or departure for the social, but is itself 
the site of productivity (Grosz 2012: 74). Thinking culture and nature in relation is not to reduce nature 
to culture or culture to nature. Differences in-between are not denied but neither are culture and nature 
approached as separate, unrelated oppositions. Mobilising a (dis)continuity between nature and culture, 
in which the former becomes itself dynamic and productive (Thiele 2014b: 18), destabilises the dualistic 
subject-object logic that maintains hierarchical verticality. An aerial ecology, composed of and in breath, 
is an alternative spatialisation of bodily becoming blossoming within living present of an unfolding future 
horizon; a space in which bodies (human and non-human) can share in ethical relations.   
83 Renaturalisation describes an ontological movement against dualisms. In her monography Spinoza and the Politics 
of Renaturalisation, Hasana Sharp mobilises Spinozas ethics  which advance a challenge to Western dualisms 
through a relational ontology  as a renaturalisation with important political consequences. Sharp (2011: 6, original 
emphasis) borrows the term renaturalisation from Grosz and mobilised it to describe the power in nature to 
transform debates around recognition and rights. Groszs work explores the conception of nature within Irigarays 
philosophy (see Grosz 1989, 1994, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2012) and places the feminist task in revitalising a view 
of human and nonhuman bodies as natural (see Grosz 2011). Following Sharp and Grosz, I would agree Irigarays 
philosophy is a renaturalisation positing the body as natural. Irigaray (1996: 39) herself determines her political, 
ethical, and ontological project to be regulated on the basis of my[/her] natural identity. 
Mara Puig de la Bellacasa advances an ethics founded upon human-nonhuman relations embedded in 
naturecultural worlds.  To view the natural and cultural in relation is, Puig de la Bellacasa (2010: 152) 
argues, to approach:  
...the ethical as an everyday doing that connects the personal to the collective and decentres the 
human, as well as grounding ethical obligation in concrete relationalities in the making rather than 
on moral norms. 
Encountering the other within a relational, dynamic, and mutually constitutive ecology of breath does not 
remove the subject, rationality, consciousness, or the cultural in favour of forces, affects, the preconscious, 
and the natural. Rather, breath moves in-between these registers, an oscillation  a constant feeding 
back and forward (Dawney 2011: 601)  between culture-nature, rationality-affect, subject-body. The 
continual inhalation and exhalation, wherein the outside is brought in and the inside moves out, is the 
movement of this oscillation. Respiration does not decentre the subject per se but, mirroring Puig de la 
Bellacasas (2010: 152) ethics decentres human subjectivity in the sense human beings are not posited 
as the masters or even the protectors of the natural world but as part of earths living beings. An ethics 
of breath, also, moves with a living, vital ecology in which all bodies, human and non-human, are active 
and intentional. Whilst to think in-between the natural and the cultural is to conceive of a new, dynamic 
conception of nature (see Crapo 2016; Grosz 2011, 2012), Irigaray is more concerned with rethinking 
the relationship between nature and culture  a relationship that is essential for animating a peaceful 
ethics breathing autonomously from, if in relation to, violence.   
This chapter moves with breath as always-already an ethical practice of caring. Theoretically this is a 
movement in-between Irigarays ethics and Puig de la Bellacasas (2017) speculative ethics of care, 
wherein care is conceived as a relational making that cultivates the perpetuation and renewal of worlds, 
life, and bodies. After this more theoretical movement in-between Irigaray and Puig de la Bellacasa, I 
trace the empirical process through which micro-political gestures of care, and so the very doing of 
peace-weaving, emerge. I discuss the limits of tolerance as a gesture of care and doing of peace, 
drawing closely on the work of Michael Walzer and the vision of peace mobilised in the 2013 TBUC 
strategy. Next, I think care as a situated affective concern and, finally, as a loving commitment. These 
final two sections are grounded in the CTS* and Turas respectively. By addressing these two spaces 
separately I, first, describe the multiple instances and gestures of care and, secondly, the limits of caring 
in a Peace Process focussed upon management as opposed to transformation  limits which are not 
present in the space of Turas. This chapter illustrates how perception is altered when we move with a 
horizon of breath, as the body becomes attentive to the everyday, practical ecologies of extant peace-
weaving  predicated here on care  always-already taking place within sustained encounters across 
Belfast. 
7.2 Breath as a Natural ,  Ethical Caring 
Peace cannot be created external to the everyday. An ethical living together, as Irigarays thinking 
illustrates, cannot be formulated from a cohesive totality or a normative morality, which is always-
already external to the ecological relations within which life is active and in movement (see also Addams 
2002a, 2002b). Ethical relations  and so peace as a relational process, and practical expression of 
love, friendship, trust, healing, and kindness  reside in micropolitical practices active within the banality 
of ordinary life; at the level where personal practice is connected to a collective (Puig de la Bellacasa 
2010: 153). Ethics cannot be thought in the abstract, they are embedded and embodied practice moving 
within an ecology of sensitive, lively experiences on which ones existence depends and which ones 
existence affects (Grosz in Grosz and Hill 2017: 11). This is not to conform to exterior moralities nor is 
it to speak of an unruly ethics. Puig de la Bellacasa opts for ethical constraint as opposed to restriction. 
Situated within a particular ecology, constraint cultivates particular ways of being and of doing that 
are the very enabling of ethical gestures (Puig de la Bellacasa 2010: 163). Whilst ethics may endure 
spatially and temporally across varying relational ecologies, ethics themselves are in a process of active 
becoming. As Puig de la Bellacasa (2017: 154) explains: 
This is different from explaining ethos as ways of behaving according to pre-existing norms and 
conventions that sort out the good and the bad, the truth and the false  or of explaining ethical 
choice as the action of objective self-reliant individuals in a given situation Rather, it can be said 
that norms and principles are particular modes of expression of ethos formation and deformation 
but do not express the whole of ethical significance. 
Here the ethical is entangled in the very activity of world-making, with material and embodied 
implications moving with the blossoming of human and nonhuman ontologies.  
Ethical moments compose and germinate in ecological relationalities. Ethics is about the ecological 
blossoming of life: it pertains to modes of maintenance, repair and continuation of life through ecological 
practices that unsettle traditional binaries (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 155). Ethical gestures maintain 
the flourishing of relationality, proximity, and reciprocity. For Irigaray, proximity is necessarily reciprocal 
and sensible. Proximity demands a relational response both within the self and from the other. It demands 
the inhalation and exhalation of breath, wherein the labour of the negative animates a continual return 
to the interiority of the self but, also, a reciprocal movement towards the mystery of the other. To move 
with the negative, is to think difference ethically (Crapo 2016). Breath cultivates the realisation that an 
embodied and relational way of living and doing impacts both upon the ecology within which one is 
embedded and ones autonomous becoming; breath is always-already an ethical practice caring for the 
living vitality of the self and the living vitality of other in an ongoing and shared relation in-between.  
Care is deeply intertwined with the blossoming of life in all its diversity. Whilst care per se does not 
prominently feature within Irigarays thinking, her ethics revolves around cultivating the blossoming of 
life founded within relations of differentiation in proximity. Ethical relations, for Irigaray, are based upon 
a respect for difference  respect of the natural and spiritual life of the self and of the other (Irigaray 
2002a: 13). In terms of thinking through encounters and drawing upon Puig de la Bellacasa speculative 
ethics,84 I read the respect Irigaray (2017: 15) puts at the heart of her ethics as an active gesture of 
care. 
Hence the necessity of attending to the preservation, not so much of a beingor Beingbeyond 
living, but to what permits life itself to exist. It is about the energy potential which sustains life that 
we must now care about, and not about exuberant excesses of growth. 
Breath both gives birth and sustains the body in the continual movement of life. It allows the body to 
blossom in its own autonomy through an ecological relation of sharing with another ontological destiny. 
When we fail to care for breath, we fail to care for life. 
For lack of caring about it (our breathing), we pervert life, ours and that of all with whom we 
supposedly share it, because we are not able to respect, to love, and to think of each in their living 
otherness and give them back to their own roots and growth (Irigaray 2016: 166). 
The blossoming of the to-be requires care (see Irigaray 2017: viii), wherein care is everything that is 
done to repair, continue, and cultivate the interweaving of living things that holds together worlds as 
we know them, that allows their perpetuation and renewal (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 161). While 
Puig de la Bellacasa determines these worlds to already be in existence and the ethics Irigaray conceives 
of is an impossibility of the future, I animate a caring ethics of breath in-between  gestures of care are 
extant but the possible worlds they animate are always a speculative creation of the future.  
Care is not aimed at the self but neither does it put the other before the self (Puig de la Bellacasa 2010). 
Rather, care corresponds to breath and, so, holds autonomy and relationality in tension. Gestures and 
practices of care, active in-between bodies, weave relations of proximity in difference: caring and 
relating share ontological resonance (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 69). Care, at least in this mobilisation, 
cannot be reduced to a relation of use wherein the other is cared for in order to serve the needs of the 
self (Puig de la Bellacasa 2010). It is a caring for life and for living-with in elemental, aerial ecologies. 
Care is not concomitant to life, but it obliges in that for life to be liveable it needs being fostered (Puig 
de la Bellacasa 2012: 198, original emphasis). As Puig de la Bellacasa (2012: 198) illustrates: 
84 Both Irigaray and Puig de la Bellacasa advance a privileged space for women in terms of developing an ethics 
attentive to relational living. Irigaray (see 2002a) argues females, specifically the little girl, use a much more 
relational language than the little boy. Additionally, she contends women more spontaneously keep breath inside 
where it can be shared, whilst man uses breath to fabricate and create external to the self. Thus, Irigaray (2017: 
29) seems to suggest the little girl is more likely to engage in an activity of caring in comparison to the little boy: 
it also seems that he [the little boy] makes a more important use of his legs than the little girl, who uses her arms 
moreto touch gently, to take care of dolls or living beings. In a similar vein, Puig de la Bellacasa (2017: 161) 
asserts the reclamation of care is not a reverence for female values but the affirmation of the centrality of a 
series of vital activities to the everyday sustainability of life that have been historically associated with women. 
Neither Irigaray nor Puig de la Bellacasa privilege the female in their ethics, as this would simply serve to switch 
the poles of the hierarchical horizon, yet they do both illustrate the reciprocity and relationality inherent to ethics 
correspond, at least historically, to a feminine way of living. Similarly, Addams everyday ontology of peace starts 
from the feminine values of nurture, care, and negotiation (Shields and Soeters 2017; Yun Lee 2011). Females, for 
Addams, innately possess a remembering heart and sense of bread-giving (Elshtain 2002: 156), which can 
animate a care for the preservation and cultivate of life (Klosterman and Stratton 2006), and bring sharing and 
nurturing into the political domain (Addams 2002c). 
although not all relations can be defined as caring, none could subsist without care. For instance, 
even when caring is not assured by the people or things that are perceptibly involved in a specific 
form of relating, in order for them to merely subsist somebody/something has (had) to be taking 
care somewhere or at some time. Further, care obliges us to constant fostering, not only because it 
is in its very nature to be about mundane maintenance and repair, but because a worlds degree 
of liveability might well depend on the caring accomplished within it. In that sense, standing by the 
vital necessity of care means standing for sustainable and flourishing relations, not merely survivalist 
or instrumental ones. 
This is an ethics of care favouring creation. Both Irigarays ethics and Puig de la Bellacasas ethics exceed 
survival to encompass the flourishing of the to-be and, in turn, invoke involved embodied, embedded 
relation in closeness with concrete conditions (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 95, see also Conradson 2003; 
Held 2006; Lawson 2007; Maeckelberghe 2004; Popke 2006; Staeheli and Brown 2003; Wiles 2011); 
care is somehow unavoidable. To move with breath as the force of relational, living vitality, then, is to 
always-already be embedded in ecologies of care. 
7.2.1 Caring-breath versus oppressive-breath 
Care disrupts both the originary position of agonism and the body as the reiteration of a mass being. A 
movement with care is a call to peace. It is a call moving with emerging relations of love, kindness, trust, 
friendship, and healing, as opposed to agonism, conflict, and violence. It calls not for grand critiques but 
for micropolitical moments of creation and invention (Lawson 2007; Hall and McGarrol 2013; Power 
and Hall 2018). Care is not a universal. Care is not about exterior moral principle nor an injunction from 
an authority but a response to a situated relationship (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 163). A micropolitical, 
situated ethics of care is still the making of new worlds, a new politics, and new cultures of sharing 
(Lawson 2007). Everyday ethical gesture of care speculatively look into the future non-dualistic, dialectic 
culture of coexistence, based on the element of air, a culture founded on mutual respect of the breath in 
the autonomous other, a culture in which all subjects share the air (kof 2015: 148). Breathing a 
speculative ethics of care is to weave a shared, aerial ecology of peace. Crucially, however, this is not 
to suggest breath is always and only a gesture of care.  
Breath can be, and has been, used to incite violence and hatred. Think back to 2001 and 2004, when 
for weeks and weeks on end verbal sectarian abuse was loudly and violently transported through breath 
to attack Catholic school children walking to and from Holy Cross Girls Primary School in north Belfast. 
How the flutes of marching bands have been used as weapons to fill the air with hate, fear, and 
intimidation. Or how the breath of stories speaks repeatedly of immoral Orangies and evil Prods, 
and manifests in deadly chants of kill all Taigs. And how the tunes of Irish rebel songs have 
reverberated through the west Belfast air in a violent act of claiming territory. Speaking about his 
exchange with Irigaray at her 2006 seminar, Donald Landes (2008: 174) recalls: 
As Luce Irigaray reminded mecontact or communication is always at risk, notably of repeating 
those power dynamics of oppression and violencethere is always a question of a loving-touch 
versus a violent or oppressive-touch. 
There is, also, always a question of a caring-breath and an oppressive-breath. We can and do breathe 
badly  the violent history of Northern Ireland is a testament to this, as are the cultural wars of the 
present. 
A badly breathing body persists by encroaching upon others to form a mass tribe or essential being. 
Life can be sustained with too little or too much air. This is not, however, a life that is living, which is 
blossoming in the movement of becoming, but one simply persisting.85 It is a life that does not breath 
autonomously but persists upon an impure, already used breath (Irigaray 2002a, 2015b). To take in too 
much or too little air can be destructive to the becoming of the human or nonhuman body. 
Too much or too little water and light (as well as heat [and air]) is detrimental to vegetal germination 
and growth. Therefore, the elements carry a generative potential within strict limits that are 
congruent with existence. Outside these limits, when the elements are either too abundant or too 
scarce, a living being is no longer able to engage with them and, consequently, cannot continue to 
exist. The measure of the elements propitious to life  our own and that of plants  is exceptionally 
fragile (Marder 2016: 139-140). 
Breathing too much or too little is to breathe unconsciously. With an unbalanced oscillation of breath, 
differences are lived hierarchically through imposed codes of self and other or horizontally in the 
sameness of an external commonality and consensus. This immobilises bodies from within their own terms, 
wherein they are devoid of situated relations of proximity, closeness, and intimacy and so emerging, 
reciprocal gestures of care. When the body breathes unconsciously it locates vitality on the perception 
of and elaboration of a real external to itself, to the detriment of an ethical relation to the self, to the 
world, and to the other (Irigaray 2017: 25). A body not in possession of a conscious relation or proximity 
to the self or to the other becomes internally and externally divided, whilst ethics is rooted within exterior 
moral principles and norms.  
Sharing in the act of becoming necessitates consciousness. Breath, nonetheless, has been neglected. We 
are conditioned to think about the need for food, water, and shelter but not the nourishment of breath. 
Irigaray (2002a: 95-96) advances three principle reasons for neglecting the living conscious of breath.  
The first results from the unorganized multiplicity of information that overwhelms us and in the face 
of which our intellectual or spiritual salvation demands passing to a universal level without ensuring 
the necessary meditations of such a gesture. Another danger comes from the fact that man has tried 
to dominate nature through various instruments or tools, but instead now finds himself in large part 
dominated by these instruments and the products made thanks to themthis promotes neither the 
85 Irigaray (2002a: 99), here, may use the term instinctive animality, which refers to the phallocentric sexual 
economy that reduces lives to reproduction and survival. I, however, would stray away from this term aware it 
could be interpreted as asserting a dualistic understanding between human bodies and animal bodies. 
development of a living consciousness for each of us nor the sharing of a common life: we live 
isolated from one another by an already made world, obeying the orders of objects and being I, 
being we of the universe that surrounds us Which constitutes a third reason for the current crisis 
of the subject as well as that of the community. 
The Western world has largely overlooked the need to cultivate a conscious, living movement of breath. 
Yet, ethical gestures reside in a conscious practice of breathing. There will always be the question of a 
loving-breath or a violent-breath, of a conscious or unconscious breath, but the practice of an unconscious, 
oppressive breath does not  at least in an ecological, future horizon  hold an originary position. 
Returning to Landes (2008: 174) conversation with Irigaray, the question of a caring-breath or an 
oppressive-breath does not reject speaking with each other, because the attempt at sharing 
communication has the distinct chance for authenticity. There is, thus, always the potential for a caring-
breath. 
An ethical, conscious breathing transforms vital breath into a more subtle breath at the service of loving, 
of speaking and hearing, of thinking and of caring (Irigaray 2015b: 254). The practice of breathing 
holds the capacity to reduce the darkness or shadows of Western consciousness (Irigaray 2002a: 7). 
This is not to locate ethics purely in the mind, in a rational and logical morality. Rather, it is a felt 
consciousness reverberating throughout the whole body. 
An Eastern culture often corresponds to becoming cultivated, to becoming spiritual through the 
practice of breathing. In this becoming the body is not separated off from the mental, nor is 
consciousness the domination of nature by a clever know-how. It is a progressive awakening for the 
entire being through the channelling of breath from centers of elemental vitality to more spiritual 
centers: of the heart, of speech, of thought (Irigaray 2002a: 8-9). 
Becoming conscious of breath is the awakening of the body to the sensual, the practical, the affective, 
and the tactile. We do not merely breath through the lungs, but through the pores of the skin (Marder 
2015) and through the interiority or the intimacy of the heart (Irigaray 2000a: 59). A practice of 
breathing educates the senses to the present (Irigaray 2002a), wherein the body cannot dwell in linear 
genealogical roots. Nor can ethics be grounded within moral norms external to ones spatiotemporal 
present, or peace located in elite processes and accords governed by the totality of a mass whole, but 
which are removed from lived relationalities in-between (Bregazzi 2019). Rather, it is to bring the 
attention to the concrete relationality of the body in the present. Consciousness for Irigaray moves in-
between and, so, breathing consciously cannot be entrusted to one subject but must be animate within 
the dense scaffolding of things that enables and shapes living, dynamic ecologies (Ash and Simpson 
2016: 63). Breathing consciously is a being-with. It is an ecological embeddedness moving with shared 
reciprocal and ethical encounters caring for the life of both the self and the other.  
Irigarays thinking advances an ontology and ethics that does not view difference as necessarily and 
immediately agonistic. I do not turn to Irigaray or to breath to offer a perspective of a pure, utopian 
peace. Yet, to think with Irigaray and to move with (conscious) breath, re-thinks the political and reclaims 
a forever emerging micropolitics, which opens the possibilities and potentialities for cultivating theoretical 
and empirical peaces that do not accept existing worlds as given (Bregazzi 2019; Puig de la Bellacasa 
2017). Mobilising differential processes of bodily blossoming as ethical gestures of care, cultivates a 
theoretical position from which there is the potential to become attentive to already-active relations of 
peace. These gestures may well intertwine with instances of conflict and violence and the worlds they 
compose will be speculative, impossible, and of the future. Nonetheless, these gestures of care are a 
political, authentic reality and whilst they may not attract international attention in the way spectacles 
of violence do (Bregazzi and Jackson 2018: 86), we cannot continue to be disclosed to the open and 
extant possibilities they compose  the moments and spaces of peaceful relations manifesting in the 
intimate and sensual expressions and affects of care.  
7.3 Tolerance as a Fai led Caring 
Tolerance has widely been mobilised as a foundational precursor for the creation of peace. As a rhetoric 
present across the Peace Process, tolerance is one of the key terms reoccurring throughout the breadth 
of the Northern Irish peace lexicon. TBUC mobilises a vision of peace that resides in addressing the 
ongoing issues and challenges of sectarianism, racism, and other forms of intolerance. Intolerance remains 
the key challenge impeding the creation of a shared and peaceful future for Northern Ireland. As the 
TBUC framework states: we believe that we cannot build a united community unless the fundamental 
issues of division and intolerance are specifically tackled (Northern Ireland Executive 2013: 19). Division 
is positioned as the product of intolerance and, thus, the creation of a united and shared Northern Irish 
society resides in its opposite  with the cultivation of tolerance. Tolerance, intertwined with and mobilised 
in little distinction from respect, is designated as one of the underpinning principles of the TBUC 
framework: we recognise that tolerance and respect are vital to building a community where cultural 
expression can be celebrated and embraced (Northern Ireland Executive 2013: 88). Peace and a united 
Northern Irish society, free from prejudice, hate and intolerance, will be built upon the cultivation of 
tolerance between the Protestant and Catholic community.  
Michael Walzer (1997: 10) conceives of tolerance as an attitude or state of mind producing a continuum 
of peaceful possibilities. The first possibility is a simple, resigned acceptance of difference for the sake 
of peace (Walzer 1997: 10-11).86  The second resides in the passive and banal indifference to 
difference and, the third, coalesces around recognising the other holds rights, even if the expression of 
those rights are viewed from a hierarchical position of distaste and unattractiveness. These three attitudes 
of tolerance can be likened to what Ervin Goffman (1963) has called civil inattention. Civil inattention 
names a meeting wherein one gives enough to appreciate the other is present before immediately 
86 Rainer Forst (2003), a student of Jrgen Habermas, mobilises a continuum of tolerance similar to Walzer: 
permission, co-existence, respect, and esteem. In Forsts continuum, the first iteration is understood as giving 
permission to which undeniably is hierarchical and even condescending (Gill, Johnstone and Williams 2012: 515). 
withdrawing this attention. Tolerance, as an act of civil inattention, informs the act of recognition scripting 
contact in Northern Ireland today.  
The need to categorise and box bodies was discussed across the breadth of interviews I conducted. The 
predominant academic narrative surrounding contact in Northern Ireland coalesces around fear. It was 
not always a fear of the other per se that aligned bodies to the choreographed dance of recognition 
but, at times, it was a fear of offending the other which induced the need to know. As Mark discussed: 
I was in New York and I was with a bunch of guys from England. We were in a restaurant and a girl 
came over to the table to serve us. She was from Belfast. I could see the other guys kind of having this 
side conversation, while I was having this conversation with this waitress and what they were basically 
doing was watching the two of us dance around where are you from, what part of Belfast, what school 
did you go to, and the two of us sort of almost sizing each other up, not from any other perspective 
apart from not to cause offence, do you know what I mean, so not to say the wrong thing. So, I wasnt 
out to degrade or annoy or whatever, it was actually the opposite, to make sure you didnt, but they 
thought this was quite funny this kind of dance around whereas where they were from it didnt really 
matter, didnt really care what you said or whatever, whereas we have that sort of dance. 
Mark danced with the waitress with the intention of not causing offence. This intention necessitated 
recognising the waitress as either Catholic or Protestant, as this label predetermines what will and will 
not cause offence, what can and cannot be said. Framed as the positive inversion of intolerance, tolerance 
always falls back upon an agonistic position viewing sociality as innately violent and irrevocably 
conflictual  there is always-already the potential for offence. This potential is managed through a civil 
tolerance corresponding to a normative morality produced external to living experience. External 
morality approaches the other according to general principles that might be suitable for whatever other, 
but that do not care about their own individuation (Irigaray 2015a: 282). 
ine also discusses how a moralistic attitude of tolerance, operative within a predetermined recognition, 
aligns contact in Northern Ireland to an external civility.  
When I came here first, I was very conscious of this, because as soon as people hear my accent then 
they make assumptions. People will be very quick to let me know that they were Catholic or if they 
weren't Catholic that they were okay with the Catholics and they would drop it in. So as soon as the 
conversation was started, you know, even at the bus stop, say, simplest of things and then very quickly 
there would be something like, oh when I was coming from Mass on Sunday, you know or it would be 
a comment like, well you know I was down in your part of the country last year, you know, and so the 
signal has been sent that we're all okay here. I found that fascinating and kind of intriguing that people 
are very keen to, I suppose very keen to position themselves visibly or let you know how they're standing 
or what.  
ine gives voice to what can be described as a civil tolerance. On hearing ines accent, people are 
quick to indicate they are okay with her being from the Republic of Ireland, yet as soon as the comment 
of attention is made it is quickly withdrawn so as to express that...[she] does not constitute a target of 
special curiosity or design (Goffman 1963: 84). Civil inattention tangibly demonstrates a lack of 
suspicion, fear, or contention in contact. It establishes civility and politeness in a courteous gesture, which 
can provide a coping mechanism and catharsis for managing the borders, dualisms, and divisions 
characterising contemporary Belfast (Seidman 2012; Smyth and McKnight 2013) and, even, suggests 
tolerance of the differences these divisions are predicated upon (Boyd 2006; Mac Ginty 2014). These 
courteous moments, which have been thought as an everyday act of kindness (Laurier and Philo 2006), 
potentially offer reservoirs of hope (Thrift 2005: 147, see also Gill, Johnstone and Williams 2012; Mac 
Ginty 2014). They reduce the violence of chance contact and make it more bearable but, nonetheless, 
they correspond to normative codes of behaviour containing expectations regarding the appropriate 
way of behaving (Valentine 2008) to produce polite, non-violent spaces of coexistence (Cresswell 1996). 
Coexistence, however, should not be confused with peace (Courtheyn 2018). 
Mark illustrates how once the body is known to be Catholic or Protestant, the subsequent interaction can 
then be regulated and constrained so as not to cause offence or say the wrong thing. This regulation 
engineers reserved, tepid, less spontaneous interactions as bodies orientate to one and other through 
external accepted standards of civility and politeness (Papacharissi 2004: 260, see also Caldwell 
2012): its just sort of walking on eggshells, not wanting to cause offence (Risn). Gestures of 
tolerance may be the best that can be achieved when relations are devoid of a care for relational limits, 
but they cannot amount to perceiving and respecting the irreducibility of the other, to recognizing the 
insurmountable difference of the other in relation to us (Irigaray 2015b: 266). Tolerance is an externally 
imposed gesture of civility that maintains the dualism of the self and other, and simply seeks to infuse 
the terms of recognition between us and them with an external moralistic norm, which sustains separation 
alongside an antagonism towards alterity (Doran 2010: 140). A tolerant horizon approaches 
differences with a polite disdain (Brown 2006; Dobbernack and Mohdood 2011; Schmidt-Leukel 2002; 
Valentine 2008). Relations here, then, are held in a stasis. They remain at the level of discourse, as 
bodies respond to the one and the other as representatives of pre-established discursive categories, 
even while they maintain a civil politeness. This cannot be the making of a relational horizon, as the 
worlds it constructs are still exterior to the wonder of the encounter, and prior to the active sensing body 
and its (peace-full) affects. 
Peace demands a relational ontology that is at once a call to ethics. It demands the becoming of a novel 
horizon, within which bodies are not approached from an a priori civility cultivating gestures of tolerance. 
Rather, it demands a care for life in its living. Whereas tolerance is understood rationally and as an 
external, universal norm, care is not drawn on the political theorists map, it ismore practical than 
principle (Brown 2003: 835). Tolerance cannot be an ethical gesture because it is not the becoming of 
a reciprocal, proximate, and situated gesture of care. However, if we return to Walzers iterations of 
tolerance, the fourth and fifth attitudes are much more akin to Irigarays thinking. Walzer (1997: 11) 
determines the fourth attitude of tolerance to be an expression of openness to the other: curiosity; 
perhaps even respect, a willingness to listen and learn. The fourth attitude is connected both to curiosity 
and listening and, so, suggests a gesture that may care for the in-between spacing of relational limits.  
Walzers fourth iteration grounds curiosity and, acutely, listening within learning and so approaches the 
other with a desire for understanding, reasoning, and knowledge. The development of understanding, 
also, holds a central place within the TBUC strategy and is regarded as integral to achieving the overall 
aim of building a new, reconciled and shared society (Northern Ireland Executive 2013: 2). 
Understanding features in the four key priorities of peace detailed in the TBUC strategy but holds acute 
emphasis regarding our cultural expression. 
We believe that increasing understanding of differing views and perspectives is vital to 
strengthening our communitys capacity to embrace and celebrate diversity. A deeper 
understanding of cultural identity and its expression will help to break down the elements of mistrust 
that have developed within and between sections of the community. Through this increased 
understanding we believe that we can create a more united community, where cultural diversity can 
be embraced rather than treated with suspicion, and celebrated rather than feared (Northern 
Ireland Executive 2013: 88). 
TBUC mirrors previous peace strategies and advances understanding as a tool for moving away from 
the violence and division of the past and creating a united community.87 Furthermore, TBUC promotes 
understanding as a precursor to creating respect and tolerance. 
We recognise that tolerance and respect are vital to building a community where cultural expression 
can be celebrated and embraced. This tolerance and mutual respect can be built through increasing 
understanding of the range of cultural traditions that exist here and encouraging a change in 
attitudes that will lead to a wider perspective on cultural expression (Northern Ireland Executive 
2013: 88, my emphasis). 
Tolerance, then, will be founded upon an ethics of mutuality, wherein the other is not dehumanised88 but 
approached as a human being and a fellow person. 
To name a body as a person is to name how a body wants to be seen. Bodies want to be recognised 
not as things or objects buts as persons belonging to the community of humanity, who together share in 
rational and reciprocal actions that treat the one and the other as common, universal persons. Persons 
are considered as the bearers of reason, dignity, understanding. They are the bodies who have achieved 
87 PEACE IV, notably in its Cooperation Programme, mirrors the TBUC framework and promotes understanding as 
a tool for achieving peace: PEACE IV will place a strong emphasis on promoting cross-community relations and 
understanding in order to create a more cohesive society (SEUPB 2014: 1). For example, PEACE IVs objective of 
building positive relations at a local level (total value 35.3 million) explicitly references mutual understanding 
as an indicative action (see SEUPB 2016) and has funded projects, such as, the Lisburn and Castlereagh City 
Councils programme Understanding Culture Through Sport, Art and Environment. 
88 Violence and sectarian conflict are often seen to reside in a narrative of dehumanisation. To define and recognise 
the other as sub-human, morally disengages those who are wielding violence from those who are suffering at the 
hands of violence (Breneau and Kteily 2017; Ramsay 2016). The narrative of dehumanisation has a long history 
on the island of Ireland: it was integral to the justification of colonial powers (see Breneau and Kteily 2017), 
reproduced during the Troubles, and sustained in the post-conflict period through inherited truths and standardised 
perceptions of hate, immorality, and fear (McAlister, Haydon and Scraton 2013). 
personhood by controlling emotional and illogical bodily impulses and sensuous events through moral 
relations with other fellow persons (Sharp 2011). It is as persons that we have the potential to be tolerant. 
Persons hold the capacity to supersede irrational, bad recognition, with an ethical recognition capable 
of producing a more truthful knowing and a better understanding. This gives rise to a politics of seeing 
better that takes as its foundation a dignity and respect owed to all human being qua human (Sharp 
2011: 164, original emphasis): a mutual tolerance. An ethics of understanding and tolerance still 
reproduces the other in reference to the self, only now in the commonness of persons opposed to relations 
of opposition. In a politics of seeing better, the other is at best respected in the name of tolerance, loved 
in God, or recognised as an equal or a fellow human (Irigaray 2002a: 125). Seeing better can only 
ever result in sameness. Potentially it is only when we move with an ethical, as opposed to primarily 
political, basis for relations that peace can extend beyond the non-violence of externally imposed 
tolerated coexistence. It is only when difference and peace are in a dialectical movement, which is at 
once ontological and ethical, that shared worlds can be built.  
Walzers final iteration of tolerance is characterised by an affirmation of difference. The fifth iteration 
places an enthusiastic and aesthetic endorsement of difference as a necessary condition for human 
flourishing, one that offers to individual men and women the choices that make their autonomy 
meaningful (Walzer 1997: 11). Walzer (1997: 11) himself questions whether this fifth attitude falls 
outside, or more precisely beyond, tolerance: how can I be said to tolerate what I in fact endorse? The 
fifth iteration is not so much a tolerance of difference but an ethical gesture caring for life and living in 
all its variation. It extends the possibility of tolerance beyond a mutual acceptance of the other as other 
and above a curiosity for learning about the other as a person. This fifth iteration  as with the continuum 
in its entirety  remains firmly grounded within a human culture, where it is reserved as an exclusive 
attitude and state of mind of logical and rational human persons.  
Breath is neither simply a cultural element or solely a nature element, but an ecological and aerial 
oscillation active in-between the natural and cultural and in-between the mind and body. Grounded 
within a human culture of persons, Walzers fifth iteration remains as an external, normative principle 
operative via a politics of recognition. The fifth iteration of tolerance cares for the flourishing of the life 
and of the living body who is recognised as a person; care for the autonomous body is predicated on 
the universal, external recognition of human persons. An ethics of breath cannot reside in an ethics or 
politics of recognition. Breath moves prior to the imposition of form animating an ethics that exceeds 
recognition. The in-between oscillation of breath decentres human subjectivity and, instead, opts for a 
relational, embodied, and shared ethics proceeding human form. Gestures of care extending beyond 
the moral constraints and normative principles of human obligation reside in this respiring oscillation. 
7.4 Care as a situated, affect ive agency 
Standing in the Synagogue, we tentatively stretched out our arms and lifted our hands to face the bodies 
either side of us. We each searched for the raised hand to our right and the raised hand to our left. We 
lay our palms flat on one and other. An unfamiliar touch. A caress felt with intimate acuteness. An 
awareness of another bodys skin, softness, and heat. Gently pushing palms against palms, we lifted one 
leg off the floor and held it bent at the knee. Palm-to-palm, ninety-four women stood strong, tall, and 
upright on one leg; we were supported and balanced by sharing in the resilience, care, and tenacity of 
feminine touch.  
  Research journal, March 8th 2017, CTS*s 2017 Womens Day Brunch 
It was a cold and dreary February morning and the first residential with a newly established womens 
group based just outside of Belfast. Helen and Bella, two friendly and confident ladies, were running the 
holistic resilience component of the programme. The session consisted of an hour-long interactive 
workshop focussed around holistic, eastern practices for boosting health and energy, including self-shiatsu 
techniques, energising acupressure points, and a relaxation exercise, followed by individual massages 
for each of the participants. 
Suddenly we were all up on our feet and rubbing our hands together to release energy. The room was 
filled with the soft, dry sound of palms moving together: back and forth, over and under, round and 
round. My hands quickly became warm, cultivating a heat through their active touch. Following Helens 
direction, we began to transfer the energy cultivated between our hands to the other parts of the body. 
We started with the face. Hands moved over eyes, lips, cheeks, the nose and the chin, and smoothed 
out the frown line. A warm, gentle touch. Each time we returned to rubbing our palms together to create 
more energy. The rubbing become more purposeful as initial inhibitions faded. Finishing off the face, 
we began to repetitively tap warm fingers lightly against the head. We then moved to the neck, the 
abdomen, the back, the kidneys and the legs, paying attention to the whole body. There was a comfort 
in feeling this heat move around as it attends to the whole body. The bodies engaged in this practice 
of care started moving with more assertiveness, with a faster tempo, and a livelier rhythm. The room 
got warmer and brighter, as the energy and heat moved and entangled in the air.  
At the edge of the chair and poised upright, head cocked, an eagerness hung in the air as we waited 
to hear about what we would be doing next. Bella and Helen walked us around the bodys acupuncture 
points that can be energised through touch. Thumbs, pushing firmly but gently, moved from the energy 
point in the wrist to help with nausea, to the back of the head to relieve headaches and migraines. They 
caressed a point in the ankle that aids the balancing of hormones and, finally, the centre of the palm 
to bring the body to a relaxed and calm state. At each energy point the thumbs touch upon the body 
applying pressure in a small circular motion. Round and round. Helen and Bella responded to calls of 
oww or I cant feel it and moved around the room touching upon the bodily points with a gentle 
but firm pressure; a touch that was not painful but strong and vigorous. I felt the strength of my own 
thumb caress my palm. Each point had to be listened to and the level of pressure applied responsive to 
the intimate feeling of touch. All senses, attention, and focus turned inwards to the internal energy 
points and to the felt circular movement of touching pressure.  
 Research Journal, February 23rd 2017 
In the holistic resilience workshop, small acts of embodied care were practiced and acutely felt (Puig de 
la Bellacasa 2017). This care differed from the common modes of care known by the women, many of 
whom were on antidepressants. The tactility and materiality of touch cultivates a sensible perception or 
an internal listening-to composed from a felt intimacy and proximity responsive to the body in the 
present. A caring touch increases the embodied, yet always relationally situated, capacity to feel, act 
and perceive (Massumi 2015: 208)  a relation of care implicating the living vitality and the movement 
of the body. Following the workshop, the women spoke excitedly, with an increased energy and 
enthusiastic spirit, about the calming liveliness animated from touching their bodies in a tactile and 
intimately attentive practice of care.  
Following on from the self-shiatsu techniques, Helen and Bella guided the workshop to a conversation 
around sleep. Throughout the room there was an acknowledgement of the difficulties of getting a good 
nights sleep. Helen and Bella introduced a simply breathing technique to help bring the body to a 
relaxed state from which sleep follows.  
Breath moved in and out of the body. Following Helens counts the body gently inhaled for one, two, 
three counts, before slowing exhaling for one, two, three, four. Over and over. One, two, three. One, 
two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three four. My eyes closed, and the sounds of Helens voice 
faded into the background, as my body folded in and out of its own respiration.  
Research Journal, February 23rd 2017 
The practice of respiration removed the body from externally imposed roles, duties, norms, and 
obligations, where it can be listened-to in an embodied stillness and quietness. This attentiveness is a 
gesture of care opening the body to calmness, to peace, and to connectedness. Helen spoke about the 
need to not feed the dark side of the body  the side that decreases the life and power of the body  
with external words, feelings, and emotions and with exterior experiences, actions, and habits implicating 
the body with anger, hate, jealousy, sadness, self-pity, and self-loathing. Attentiveness needs to be 
reoriented to the interior, and to the embodied actions and relational touch of love, peace, harmony, 
kindness, compassion, generosity, and trust that cares for the blossoming of life. Helen continued by 
illustrating the body does not simply rely of food, exercise, water, and shelter for life but must also be 
nourished with sounds, silences, conversations, forces, positive energy, and breath, each of which care for 
and listen-to the whole-body in a felt and open attentiveness. 
The afternoon session entailed an arts workshop. Whilst the morning holistic session was largely 
constructed around cultivating an internal gesture of care, the afternoon session animated gestures of 
care responsive to both the interior and relational life of the body. This session was run by a young, 
petite and noticeably pregnant lady called Emma who guided the ladies through the activity of silk 
painting. The ladies first revealed their canvas by stretching out a long piece of shimmering, white silk 
and pinning it to a wooden frame. Emma had brought with her a range of different images relating to 
the themes of womanhood and sisterhood. 
Conversation moved across the tables from all angles, entwining in the middle. The ladies were 
engrossed in a discussion of what to paint. Each person voiced their ideas and offered words and nods 
of encouragement as they quietly listened-to others, letting their thoughts and ideas fill the air. Emma 
has brought a series of different images for inspiration and these were now flying through open hands 
and shuffled through with searching eyes. The pace slowed as the images were cautiously, and with a 
gentle care, placed and arranged upon the silk. All hands, arms, fingers and eyes were active in carving 
out a space on the silk for each idea and body. A central image was conceived to bring together and 
connect all the images  the braid composed from the intertwining the hair of four different women; 
blonde, brown, grey, and black, each remaining distinct as they share within the entangled relation (see 
figure 24).  
With the beginnings of an idea germinating among the active bodies, Emma urged the women to put 
pencil to the silk and begin to sketch out the images. Hesitation filled the air; a concern it would be 
wrong, or they would not be good enough. Urged by one and other, the pencils were soon gliding 
across the silk as feint silver lines, swirls, circles, edges, and points emerged. There was a need to be 
aware of other bodies and care for the strokes of different pencils, to attend to their presence to avoid 
collision, and protect their space to prevent their erasure. Conversation filled the air as the bodies 
continued to draw; an image made in the sharing of breath was slowly materialising on the silk. Bodies 
moved slowly and purposefully. Pressure was applied gently. Colours chosen with thought and attention. 
Opinions asked and gifted. Quickly and intimately, bodies came to care for this piece of silk, which 
materialised the emerging entangling of the group. 
Research Journal, February 23rd 2017 
In this moment of working together, of listening-to one and other, and bouncing ideas and thoughts off 
one and other, the women shared in active relations of care moving back and forth in-between each and 
every body.  
As the women progressed from the feint silver of the pencil to the colourful paint, the image was given 
life. It danced. It moved. It was bright and beautiful. Butterflies caressed and flowers pirouetted. Just as 
the image gained a liveliness, so did the women. Their thoughts, visions, and ideas became filled with 
colour, and their own bodies blossomed and grew into the space alongside the flowering of the silk. 
Derek McCormack (2003: 503) writes the question is not only how far can we care but also becomes 
one of cultivating a commitment to those relations that may increase the intensity of attachment and 
connectivity. Sharing with the other cannot reside in an internal gesture of care that attends to only our 
vital preservation and growth. To cultivate a life towards sharing require us to care both about our own 
blossoming and our relational potential (Irigaray 2016: 96). The care for this blossoming was projected 
onto a care for the silk: in the central image of sisterhood and the entwinement of the hair braid; in the 
caring for each persons spaces; in attending to each others concerns; and in the exhaling words of 
encouragement and praise that voiced a faith in an other body. Together they created a shared image 
which spoke of each body in an autonomous voice whilst folding these voices together in an image 
belonging to no one and all of them. In the attentiveness and tactility of gestures, both towards each 
other and the silk painting, care became an embodied, sensuous, and felt activity of relation.  
Figure. 24. The silk painting produced by the ladies. The focal point of the painting 
is the intertwining of the three different hair braids (authors own March 2nd 
2017). 
Care as an affective force is both something that we do and sense. Puig de la Bellacasa (2017: 162) 
situates the affective force of care 'in the phrase I care. The statement I care' cannot be reduced to an 
external rationality, a moral norm, or a static principle. These ladies know one another and engage in 
many activities and conversations together, but in the embodied, relatively mundane activity of silk 
painting bodies committed to shared experiences of care. This commitment moves with the embodied 
realisation that we are already ordinary everyday companions (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 199-200), 
entwined in a relational ecology of blossoming together through carnal attentiveness and connectivity 
(Irigaray 1996: 124). Attachment and connectivity intensify the bodys relational potential, as the body 
gains a sense of comfort in being part of something: a commonality and togetherness in the commitment 
to the silk painting but, and more importantly, to the cultivation of the space as an emerging ecology of 
care (Darling 2010). 
Relations and experiences of care are always situated. Puig de la Bellacasa (2017) suggests 'care work 
becomes better when it is done again,' arguing care increases with repetition, greater attention, and 
fine-tuning. In the internal comfort and embodied familiarity of repetition, shared ecological worlds 
become less speculative and increasingly present to the point where they become habitual. Although the 
activity of painting on silk never became habitual for the women, when they picked up the paint brush 
in the second workshop, about a week after the first, their movements were more confident, assured, and 
comfortable. Movements in and with shared ecological worlds becomes easier and less risky through 
sustained repetition. As relational potential blossoms, the body moves almost unnoticed in the future of 
an alternative horizon that feels real because it is not, or at least no longer, felt all that much. Repetitions 
of care, however, are only active, affective, and ethical when their movements continue to be woven 
from situated relations.  
In the arena of conflict transformation and peacebuilding, gestures of care are experienced in relations 
of intimacy, faithfulness, attentiveness, and connectivity. However, there exists a tension as affectivity is 
also part of situations of care, as oppressive burden, exhaustion, and fatigue (Puig de la Bellacasa 
2017: 5). The activities of the peacebuilding sector, which largely predate the Good Friday Agreement, 
have become plagued with fatigue. The Northern Ireland Executives Director of Good Relations voiced 
her concern surrounding such fatigue  which is intimately tied to the uncertainty and precarity of funding 
 when I asked her about the greatest challenges facing peacebuilding in Northern Ireland today. 
I think funding is a challenge and increasingly the need to be able to relate outputs to outcomes  and 
youll know this from the work CTS* do and the womens programmes  such as what difference does 
it make?, how sustainable is it?. So thats a big challenge. I think the other challenge will be Brexit 
and a possible end of EU funding, not within the next year but on a long-term basis and organisations 
need to start to plan for that. I think as we increasingly, and it is related to this as we ramp-up the 
accountability, I think capacity within community groups to be able to deal with that because of the 
wide range of community groups we have, not all have the same capacity and some are effectively one 
man or two-man bands. There is also like almost a community and voluntary sector fatigue out there. 
There have been groups that have been struggling on at this work for years and Ive met quite a number 
of people who have been like, Ive been at the job now for, Ive been doing this now for twenty years 
Ive had enough you know, so there is a lot of that type of fatigue. 
The Director of Good Relations illustrates how conflict transformation work has been an exhausting 
struggle for decades: segregation still characterises Northern Ireland in its breadth; sectarianism is still 
rife; paramilitary groups are still active and continue to yield a dominating force and control, particularly 
within working class communities; politics remains a zero-sum battle of green or orange; and culture wars 
surrounding marching and the Irish language sustains divisions and compel hard-line views. Affectivity 
cannot make it to care without reiteration, yet this reiteration cannot become a moral intention wherein 
affectivity produces a disposition to care about that fails to maintain a caring for (Puig de la Bellacasa 
2017). The Peace Process has engineered relations in which bodies are affected with a disposition of 
caring about not caring for. 
The Peace Process has commodified and institutionalised good relations as a political goal, at the same 
time as maintaining the two communities model (Graham and Nash 2006). It is the interplay between 
these two factors that produce a disposition of caring about. Peacebuilding organisations and 
practitioners have been forced to align their actions to funders and, thus, to the vision of peace projected 
by the Executive. Funders demand a direct response aligning to the commodity, to the determined form 
of peacebuilding work and the predefined vision, they are investing in. The actions of those doing 
peacebuilding work, then, have been externalised, with the consequence care is restricted as it becomes 
associated with direct helping actions (Schrader 2015). Here, care is limited by a progressive view 
oriented to an end or a defined object of care (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017: 233). Yet, in holding the 
two communities model in place the end is an impossibility, as peace and care cannot be found in the 
current horizon of binary identity politics. This affects bodies coordinating and facilitating peacebuilding 
work with fatigue as organisations and practitioners are sustained in an externally oriented activity 
towards an impossible end; they are affected with a disposition to care about opposed to caring for. 
Affectivity cannot coalesce in external moral norms or within a linear trajectory of activity directly 
translatable across space and time. When this happens, we move from a caring-breath to an oppressive-
breath, from a positive affective relation to a negative affective relation, within which the bodys 
capacity for living is reduced or held in the stasis of what is. 
The Peace Process maintains and pulls back activities of peacebuilding to an external, moral norm of 
caring about opposed to a situated relation of caring for. As peacebuilding has become a progressively 
important arena of governmental control, civil society and the community and voluntary sector have 
become another interest group subordinate to elected representatives. As Nicholas Acheson and Carl 
Milofsky (2008: 77) state: since executive stability the Peace Process has failed to connect with the 
creativity of people at the local community level, but tries instead to utilise those local communities to 
promote the interests and agendas of those at the level of political elites. The TBUC strategy 
acknowledges the need for a coordinated effort between the political elite, local representatives, and 
civil society. Yet, across the three peace frameworks there is continual reference to the need for the 
political elites to provide the leading role: 
As an Executive, we believe firmly in the potential of our people and we are committed to making 
our society a better place for all  regardless of background, political opinion, religious belief or 
race. We acknowledge that leadership at a political level is a vital ingredient in driving this change. 
However, we also recognise that achieving the vision set out in this Strategy is not solely the 
responsibility of the Executive  and work by everyone to achieve it must continue and intensify  
including individuals, groups and agencies at a local level (Northern Ireland Executive 2013: 11). 
Civil society and the community and voluntary sector can only play an active role in the Peace Process 
to extent they have the opportunity to do so, and the provision of such opportunity lies within 
governmental hands. Exteriority reduces the capacity for situated peacebuilding work and aligns ethics 
to normative principles transportable across time, space, and bodies.  
Repetition of peacebuilding work is heightened in the current climate, where the community and voluntary 
sector are continually facing increasing uncertainty regarding funding. Funders demand tangible 
outcomes that force peacebuilding to align to activities and programmes with a quantifiable output 
(see Byrne et al. 2009; Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne and Pettis 2018; Skarlato et al. 2016). Prior to any 
training event the small CTS* office tended to be overcome, with Lauren, Jasmine, and I flapping around 
the room checking we had all the resources needed and, crucially, the sign-in sheet and evaluation forms 
that evidence the running of the event. The CTS* would use the evaluation forms for developing other 
training packages but, more importantly, they would be used to construct a report detailing the success 
of the programme and illustrating value for money.89 With a pressure to evidence the success and 
benefits gained from participation, evaluation forms seek to chart something observable and universal; 
they seek to quantify subtle and intangible changes in peoples perceptions, attitudes, [and] interests 
(Skarlato et al. 2016: 175). The CTS*s evaluation forms, then, overwhelmingly centre around 
understanding, with a common question being: what three things have you learnt today that you didnt 
know before? The process of external evaluation and measurement regulates peacebuilding work (Mac 
Ginty 2014), with the consequence the enchanted world is always in the process of being superseded 
by a calculable world (Bennet 2001: 58). The fatigue plaguing the peacebuilding sector largely resides 
in the repetitive and static nature of peacebuilding that is forced to work with an external ethics, vision, 
and morality, which fails to cultivate felt and sensuous gestures of care in embodied and embedded 
relations of situated living.  
89 The pressure to evidence success has made the community and voluntary sector increasingly vulnerable due to 
the difficulty of quantifying their contribution to broader social change (Acheson et al. 2006; Power 2011). 
Additionally, it has produced a disjuncture whereby funders tend to think that the problems have been solved, 
whilst the majority of practitioner stress the continuing presence of longstanding issues (Morrow, Faulkner-Byrne 
and Pettis 2018: 30). 
The occurrence of repetition exceeds far beyond those who engineer peacebuilding and is replicated in 
the reoccurrence of the bodies involved in activities building peace. Frank noted this repetition.  
I think one of the problems that they have as well, we have spoken a lot about these so-called community 
organisations and I really dont like them, they are all dealing with the same people. Cross-community 
groups are dealing with the same people. Nobody is really reaching the communities. Those community 
groups are all working among themselves, they all bring the same models to the same people, and the 
kids and the adults who really count are not being reached. 
The CTS* will often be forced to engage the same community groups year on year across the breadth 
of their peacebuilding work. Funding bodies require maximum impact and, thus, call for a guaranteed 
high number of participants, which may have to be recruited at short notice. This propels peacebuilding 
organisations and charities towards ready-made and already-active groups who, from their involvement 
in previous programmes, they know to be reliable and committed. These groups, however, move through 
peacebuilding programmes as if on a conveyor belt and their bodies become closed off from, and 
desensitised to, the situatedness of each peacebuilding activity, and to the relations and feeling of the 
space. Here, there is the risk that repetition will become externalised. In this externalisation, the repetition 
of care becomes directed towards an end goal concerned with the right of having, opposed to a 
situated iteration cultivating an ethics of living. 
Irigaray (seminar 2019) distinguishes between a right of having and an ethics of life. The former refers 
to property, physical goods, and objects that we can own, claim, and determine solely as ours. It is upon 
these rights that the Western world bestows protection and care. An ethics of life, in contrast, corresponds 
to the care for life, wherein relations of breath are our first and most radical need (Irigaray 2002a: 
74). The right of having was animated continually by the participants involved in the CTS*s 
peacebuilding work: in the telephone calls before a site visit requesting food that met this months weight 
loss diet; demands for the bus to pick people up from and drop them off outside of their houses; 
complaints the food was not good enough or there was less food than at the last peacebuilding workshop; 
the incessant questioning of when the group was going to get food; the requests for soft-drinks opposed 
to water; the barging and pushing to be at the front of the buffet line; and in bodies returning to the 
buffet for a second plate before others had even eaten. Although by no means consistent across and 
among groups, the sense of entitlement and greed displayed by several participants, and on a series of 
occasions, potentially stems from their repeated involvement in peacebuilding work. In repetitive play 
there is no time or space for growing, creating, or sharing (Irigaray 2016). Repetition removes bodies 
from the extant relations of care and comparatively frames a space in the externality of past 
experiences. Care needs to be continually iterated, but this reiteration cannot be reduced to a repetition 
but should be performed as a gesture moving with an ethics of life respiring in the now.  
7.5 Care as a Loving Obligation 
The Turas project lives on a love for and commitment to the Irish language. The project was conceived 
from love and this love continues to define the space eight years after the first class. Turas is not a 
business or a profitable organisation. The project was not conceived with the intention of peacebuilding.90 
The birth of the project lay in Linda Ervines love for the Irish language and her desire to continue learning 
a language she had fallen in love with.  
Linda suffered a period of ill health that culminated in her reducing her hours as a secondary school 
teacher. Working fewer hours, Linda joined a local east Belfast womens group. The group were involved 
in a cross-community peacebuilding project, alongside a womens group based in Short Strand, a Catholic 
enclave that backs on to the Newtownards Road. The two group would meet once a week, one week in 
East Belfast Mission on the Newtownards Road and one week in Short Strand Community Centre. As part 
of this cross-community project, the two groups together embarked upon an introductory Irish language 
course and Linda, the Protestant from east Belfast, immediately feel in the love with the language.  
Linda:  Well I got introduced to the language through a thing here, it was like a wee, erm like I 
was part of the womens group, and I actually joined the womens group cause I thought 
right this will get my head cause Brian said to me youre overworked, you work too much, 
youre over preparing and I was obsessed, and I was losing my confidence and I felt like 
no matter how much I'd prepared it's not enough, it's not enough. 
Ciara: And because you sort of feel, did you feel it like slipping back to how you'd felt when you 
were young? 
Linda: Yeah, yeah. 
Ciara: That must have been very scary? 
Linda: And Brian was also, he was a PUP Leader which was very, very stressful, so there was a 
lot, just a very stressful time and I think I was very, you know, started to get sort of panicky 
and things and it was frightening. So I did, I went, I joined the womens group to kinda get 
away from that and sort of do something. I enjoyed the craic, it was good craic, and I was 
introduced to the Irish language, I fell in love with it, started going to classes. 
Ciara: Where were you going to classes then? 
Linda: Over An Droichead. You know, so and I used to meet my friend and I used to walk downit 
was really nice. It was really lovely. It was just such a, such a lovely wee window in the 
week, you know. But umm, what happened then was, umm, I started, started to just kinda 
read about the Irish language, started to sort of, all this different stuff that was going on, 
started to realise, you know, that there was so much to it than what I had sort of thought, 
you know. 
90 Whilst today Turas taps into peacebuilding funding, it remains a space composed of more organic encounters 
opposed to engineered contact. Turas does not conform to an elite vision of peacebuilding but reshapes this vision 
to describe what is always-already happening in Turas.  
From her first encounter, Linda fell in love with the Irish language.  What initiates this love is difficult to 
pinpoint, and more than likely a series of things: the language itself; a respite from the normality and 
tension of everyday life; an activity that was just for her and nobody else; a space free from stress. It 
was the whole experience of learning the language and connecting to the history of the language that 
Linda loved.  
Considering Lindas background, her rooting to east Belfast and the Ervine family, her initial draw to 
Gaelic may have been fragile. Yet, to move towards something in love is the animation of a form of 
relation that one finds oneselfnurturing or caring for (Povinelli 2011: 28). To nurture and care for the 
Irish language, and specifically for its presence in east Belfast and within the Protestant community more 
generally, required Linda to make a choice. Whilst there may be very little choice in Lindas first 
movements towards the Irish language, in the love that pulsated throughout her body in hearing and 
speaking Gaelic, care entails an immanent obligation that is reinforced the more the body choses to 
engage, the more the body choses to move in the interval in-between (Olkowski 2000). As Elizabeth 
Povinelli (2011: 33) writes:  
By immanent obligation I am referring to a form of relationality that one finds oneself drawn to 
and finds oneself nurturing, or caring for... This being drawn tois often initially a very fragile 
connection, a sense of an immanent connectivity. Choices are then made to enrich and intensify these 
connections. 
Affected with a loving connection for the Irish language, Linda made what was undoubtedly a 
controversial and largely unprecedented choice in seeking out Irish language classes at An Droichead, 
in south Belfast. These weekly classes provided a happy, enjoyable window in Lindas week, at a time 
when she was suffering from illness and poor mental health. At this moment Lindas choice to continue to 
learn Irish did not extend far beyond herself, yet this soon changed. 
The local media, due to Lindas close association with Unionism, quickly noted her engagement with the 
Irish language. Following a radio interview in which Linda discussed how she was learning Irish, both 
Linda and the East Belfast Mission were inundated with calls enquiring about Irish language classes which, 
at the time, did not exist: 
Linda: then what happened was a local journalist found out that I was learning Irish, so it ended 
up in a few newspapers. 
Ciara: Because of Brian? 
Linda: Because of Brian and I gave a wee, umm, I gave a wee interview on, umm, the umm, radio 
too, I was just trying to think which happened first, oh yeah and then the next thing I 
mentioned East Belfast Mission in a wee radio interview and then the next thing that 
happened was they were approaching me, people who wanted to come and go to the 
classes, which didn't exist of course. So, we started up our own class. 
Propelled internally by her love for the Irish language, alongside the surge of interest following the radio 
interview, Linda began to conceive on an idea for an Irish language school in east Belfast. 
Linda was under no external obligation to setup and run Turas. Lindas love for Gaelic and her intimate 
joy of learning the language animated an immanent obligation of care and connectivity she consciously 
chose to intensify and enrich. This movement has ensured the continuing success and growth of Turas, as 
a space open to everyone and anyone who shares in a love for Gaelic regardless of territorial rooting, 
ancestral lineage, or religious background. Linda has, particularly in the beginning, faced pressures to 
designate Turas as a language school advancing an Irish language for Protestants.  
Ciara: Have you ever worried that there's a sort of danger from Turas becoming an Irish language 
exclusive for Protestants, distinct from an Irish language for Catholics? 
Linda:  Well that was, yeah, no that was the one thing we fought against, I mean away back at 
the start there were a few people who wanted us to call it Gaelic, never refer to it as Irish, 
and I think kind of taking the attitude of were taking it back, you know, and that's, no, 
not interested in that, you know, that would have been a horrible. You can imagine what 
Turas would have been, nasty, narrow, and err you know it could have done that and we 
could have gone in, you could imagine the nonsense. I mean we could, we could be sitting 
now as Turas that hates an Irish Language Act and were Irish speakers and we dont [slams 
her hands down on the table] want an Irish Language Act, you know, and we would have 
been used my god, you know, and umm... 
Ciara:  Was that hard to not fall down, not to be framed in those kinds of terms? 
Linda:  Yeah there were times, yeah, there were times at the very beginning when that was, a 
number of people that's what they wanted, that's the box they wanted to put us in. And we 
had to resist, you know, and also, you know, there was the kind of sense of oh well you 
know call it Gaelic, don't call it Irish, they're not going to go for Irish and I remember 
saying no cos that's a vilification of Irishness, you know, that's saying there's something 
wrong. I said but I'm Irish, I might be British but I'm still Irish and no I'm not gonna play 
that game because that's what it was, the minute you went down that road you were saying 
there's something wrong with being Irish, you know. 
Ciara:  Yeah and I think the whole point of Turas is that it sort of challenges and destabilises those 
very binary conceptions that being Irish means all this and being British means all that with 
very little in-between the two of them. 
Linda:  Yeah, yeah and like I say that's what we could of, that could have so easily happened, you 
know. So easily happened and thankfully we fought it but, umm, you know, I think it was 
just always good people on-board and you know, so there was something bigger, 
something bigger. 
Lindas love for the Irish language, a love cultivated in relation to the other bodies active within Turas, 
operates to prevent the project gaining a sovereignty and control over the language from a 
territorialised position of Protestantism and Loyalism. Love moves to unsettle traditional binaries and 
claims of belonging by refusing to engage with a rhetoric seeking to claim the language as exclusive to 
the Protestant community. To opt for non-sovereignty is to transcend the cultural milieu of the self and 
the body as a reiteration of a mass being, and move towards the other with a willingness to give and 
share in ethical gestures that do not advance exclusive claims of ownership and authority (Lanas and 
Zembylas 2015: 279). Love, here, cannot be understood as an emotion reserved only for those with 
whom we are intimate, but an ethical agency that motivates a move towards others, across difference 
(Oliver 2001: 218). As an ethical agency, love transforms space and breaks sociality open (Massumi 
2015: 11), as the body choses to move against fear  against alienation and separation (hooks 2000: 
93). Love is a choice of breath.  
Once love is chosen, the body is then affected with an obliging commitment to care for this choice 
(Atkinson, Lawson and Wiles 2011; Lanas and Zembylas 2015; Lawson 2007; Puig de la Bellacasa 
2010). The ethical obligation of care and love are not a priori universals, they do not define our nature, 
[but] they have become necessary for living in a relational ecology (Puig de la Bellacasa 2010: 163, 
original emphasis). Turas moves with a committed care for a love moving in-between. It cultivates a 
relational way of living in worlds that can, in certain aspects, become stabilised, but only through the 
continual care for love in response to the particularities and connections of the space. To continue living 
in a shared ecology we must continue to breathe. Breath cannot be forgotten. The agency of love will 
only be sustained in the continual respiration of the caring relation (Loyd 2012), a reiteration that is not 
always easy.  
Whilst the Ervine name potentially made Lindas movement towards the Irish language possible, it also 
makes the choice to continue to nurture and care for this movement difficult. The difficulty of this choice 
is heightened in the current political climate, and within the hard-line Loyalist community Linda has been 
vilified. Linda candidly acknowledged her life would be easier without the Ervine name.  
You know there's times and you know, I mean there's part of me loves Turas, you know, I'm very 
passionate about it but there have been times before I married my Brian my name was Collins, and I'm 
telling you there's times when I thought oh god I just want to be Linda Collins again. I want to be Linda 
Collins. I don't want anybody to know me.  
Care is inherently relational, but the act of caring also forms disconnection. Puig de la Bellacasa (2017: 
78) illustrates we cannot possibly care for everything, not everything can count in a world, not everything 
is relevant in a world, in the same way that there is no life without death. Choosing to enrich and intensify 
her relation to the Irish language, at least in the beginning, necessitated a heavy reliance of the Ervine 
name, with the consequence Linda became increasingly disconnected from her maiden name and the 
anonymity it gave her.91  
91 Linda is always framed through the label of David Ervines sister in law or as Brian Ervines wife, which represents 
an image of her that she does not embody. As Linda explains: my influences are my family, my influences were 
communism and socialism and you know, yes I did vote the PUP, I did support David, who was a family friend and 
things, you know, but that wasn't the influence. So I started to speak out and say now hold on a minute and no, I'm not, 
my family are communists and Brian said oh god no. I said I'm not gonna pretend to be somebody I'm not, I'm not a 
Loyalist, I'm not even a Unionist, I never have been and I'm not gonna pretend to be. And at first, you know, it probably 
suited my purposes, but I think it's not who I am, I don't wanna live a lie. 
Disconnection formed from care can extend as far as the shared relations animated in caring. Lindas 
care for Turas put a strain on her marriage and her and Brian now live apart. 
I mean Brian said to me at the time, you know, we're the last stick here Linda, you know, he said we'll 
have no frigging windows, you knowthere's been times when he's been very critical of me as well and 
you know, it's, I mean it's been very tough, you know, because Brian and I are not politically on the 
same page and I think that's, I never, I didn't realise that it wasn't important before and then all of a 
sudden it became very important. Like I was out there saying things that he was kinda not too sure of, 
you know. I mean Brian is very supportive of me, you know, teaching and very supportive of me in 
this job but another part of Brian wanted me, wanted me to go out and do all these things and be 
successful but he also wanted me to be in the house making the dinner. Do you know and life changed 
and he could not, he couldn't adapt to it and then at the same time as this was happening with me, his 
life started to go downhill, he'd taken ill, he'd had a number of operations, he lost his job, you know, 
and life changed for him too And you know, I think being in a lot of pain didn't help his mood very 
much and I think I avoided him, I think I, you know, I engrossed myself, because obviously I was free 
and I was, you know, I'd never done anything like this before and it was all consuming, you know. And 
I suppose I felt I had an awful lot to prove and umm, and it was a lot of pressure, I mean I was the 
only member of staff basically, that was it, so I was working nine to nine and this things just taking 
off, it just took a life of its own and I was running everywhere, you know, and I think I was probably 
hiding as well, I was probably just you know, escaping. So, the marriage just broke down and I moved 
Linda has chosen to care for Turas, for the growth of the Irish language in east Belfast, and for the 
blossoming of the bodies who attend the various classes on offer. Yet, choosing to embody this gesture 
of care has formed intimate and lasting disconnections. To choose care entails huge sacrifices and Linda 
made many sacrifices before she was aware they had even been chosen: still I have very little that can 
be described as choice in the original orientation (Povinelli 2011: 33). I asked Linda if knowing 
everything she did know, in knowing the sacrifice and disconnection entailed and the obligation and 
responsibility for caring for Turas, would she do it again and she replied: I dont, I really dont know. 
Lindas choice to nurture and care for her loving relation to the language may not be easy but it is, and 
has been, transformative.  
Care is not a gesture moving only towards the other. As Puig de la Bellacasa (2017: 219) illustrates: the 
cared for coforms the carer too. The making of Lindas body and life blossoms in her care for the Irish 
language. As Linda wrote in a Facebook post on the 12th July 2014 and shared again five years later: 
Sometime people ask me why I am learning the Irish language and what use it is. My answer is this. 
Having knowledge of the language has enriched my life. I now understand the meaning of our place 
name and surnamesI have met lots of great people from all over the world and made many new 
friends. I have gained many new qualifications and enjoy the feeling of achievement as I improve 
my language skills. I have been introduced to traditional music and dance and have through my 
love for the language and culture gained a new respect and interest in Ulster Scots. I havent 
changed my religious or political viewpoint but I have learnt an awful lot about the Irish language 
and its link to Protestants (Ervine 2014: n.p., my emphasis). 
Linda, here, illustrates how in caring for the Irish language, the language has also cared for the 
blossoming and growth of her body. The Irish language has not appropriated her body, her political 
viewpoint, or religion. Caring for Gaelic has enriched Lindas life and provided a relation within which 
Linda has thrived and found purpose, whilst also caring for her body at a time when her health was 
deteriorating. As Linda voiced in our conversation: We have found the cure for loneliness and depression 
and its called the Irish langue because why would anybody be sitting in the house when there's a whole 
world, you know, it's social. Care is not an isolated act but a relational act bodies share in and are 
enriched by.  
An obligation to care is not about being in charge, but about being involved (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017). 
The various bodies who attend Turas are entangled in situated relations of care and love for Turas and 
Gaelic. Whilst a relation of care may be what connects the bodies active in the space of Turas, who is 
caring and who is cared for becomes blurred in the entanglement of caring gestures. Care is shared, 
distributed, and returned. It folds in-between; a respiring oscillation moving from the inside to the outside, 
for the carer to the cared, and back again. This is not to align care to an external morality. Care in-
between does not require a recognition but describes a creative engagement that relies onan opening 
to surprise (Schrader 2015: 9). This surprise fills the body with wonder and wanders it beyond what it 
was previously. Yet, just as the body will only be realised in the movement of becoming, where it wanders 
the carer and the cared for cannot be pre-determined. The subject of care is left unknown, the act of 
care is undetermined, and bodies and relational gestured remain in movement as immanent space-times 
are reconfigured to the respiration of the present ecology (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017). The worlds and 
relations that arise from approaching both the self and the other with ethical gestures of care may 
remain speculative, but this fragility and uncertainty folds in-between all the bodies that have, and 
continue, to approach Turas in love.  
7.6 Conclusion: A l iv ing commoning  
The weaving of peace-as-peace moves with worlds in which sociality and constitutive relations of 
difference cannot be grounded in a horizon granting an originary position for agonism and violence. 
This chapter has embodied such a movement. It moves with an ecological and relational horizon in which 
difference is not read as necessarily violent, divisive, or conflictual but as a shared, relational blossoming 
of living vitality. This is a movement extending beyond critique and engaging with the always-already 
present relations of peace, weaving the incipient and speculative making of ecological relationalities 
that are at once aerial, shared, and ethical. 
The ethics of an ecological horizon cannot be reduced to a normative, predetermined moral standard. 
Ethics are situated, everyday, embodied, and intimate respirations caring for the living vitality of all 
bodies and the shared relations in-between. They are the gestures caring for the aches and pains of the 
body and a tender touch responsive to the present body. They are moments of stillness and calm, and 
actions caring for the space of unknown bodies. Care is voiced in calls of faith, in words of 
encouragement, and in a commitment to connectivity. Caring respires with reciprocal loving obligations, 
with difficult choices of engagement, and with aerial movements against and across divisions and 
boundaries. These gestures of care require continual enactment. Care necessitates a constant reciprocal 
folding moving with the wonder and surprise of living. Constant articulations of care are always 
emergent, situated, and responsive.  
Although always situated, an ethics of care holds the potential to move with spaces and relations beyond 
those of its enactment. Ethical respirations of care are necessarily speculative, they are the opening onto 
a hopefulness about what the possible can involve (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017). Hope for shared worlds 
and a peaceful horizon potentially animates the continual enactment of caring gestures (Conradson 
2011), which are the making of ecological living that has a provisional consistency or coherence but 
one that cannot be limited to the stability and coherence of a political regime (Collier and Lakoff 2005: 
31-33). Peace cannot be constructed from above. It cannot be a predetermined, external vision that 
everyday actions and doings must align to. Shared, peaceful worlds must retain the contingency and 
dynamism of the everyday onto-ethical relations that are their making. It is this speculative making that 
prevents the imposition of an external commonality and consensus.  
To reach-towards another body in an ethics of care is not to reinstate a forgotten commonness. Peace 
will not be a product of commonality determined a priori. Tolerant attitudes may reconfigure the 
Catholic-Protestant binary to become less-than-violent, but they remain firmly rooted to a dualistic 
horizon, only now opposition is displaced with commonness.92 We must stop searching for consensus that 
understands the other as a person with whom we are in common through the imposition of an external 
and universal moral norm. Opposed to demanding cohesion, unity, and integration, peace will be the 
making of an open commonality. To be living is to be in relation and this relation is always-already a 
respiring commoning.  
What is shared in relational becoming, in an ecology of breath, is not subsumed into a singular person 
or one world. Commonality is not found in the ubiquitous and ceaseless recognition of mass territorial 
roots and communal orientations, with an assumption that I not only exist but that you can also be 
convinced to recognise yourself in my image. Commoning is an ethical sharing of care for living vitality 
in and across difference, for the potentialities and possibilities of other bodies and other worlds that are 
always-already necessarily different from the capacity and the potential of my body and world 
(Marder 2016: 204). This is a sharing that can never be reduced to what is in common but a sharing of 
92 Difference and differential process may be negated, at least amongst persons, but difference per se is still 
read as necessarily agonistic, division, or violent. An ethics of tolerance forecloses every potential for peaceful 
relation, as we continue in a cyclical movement of critique searching for irreducible conflict and violence. 
autonomy in relationality; a sharing of the continual becoming and distancing of the first, autonomous 
breath. To quote Irigaray (2002b: 67): air is what is left common between subjects living in different 
worlds. 
Commoning respires with possibilities that are never complete. There is an ever-present danger that 
fixing the activity of commoning in definitions and rationalisations will close off spaces of making. 
Commoning without an in common must continuously trace its own escape within and beneath the I 
(Manning 2011: 106); it must continually respire with the never halting movement of breath. Commoning 
does not shape an essential being composing a singular whole but is the dissensus of emerging becomings 
within the ecological horizon of life-living in the making (Manning 2013). Rather than thinking of 
commoning as a positivity with clear contents and outlines, commoning must continually be advanced as 
a negativity with potential to become (Gibson-Graham 2006a: xv, original emphasis). The commoning 
of breath is not the common (neutral) ground that peace processes driven by the dominant macropolitical 
seek to construct, but an incipient commoning beyond community and commonality (Manning 2013: 201): 
a commonality in breath. 
Conclusions 
It wont always be like this. It is going to be better. 
(Lyra McKee 2019: n.p.) 
8.1 Introduction 
On the 9th September 2019, less than five months after the death of Lyra McKee, trouble broke out on 
the streets of Derry once again. Mirroring the violence witnessed earlier in the year, PSNI officers were 
met with petrol bomb on the street of Creggan as they carried out searches targeting dissident 
Republicans. They located an explosive device that had been marked for attacking a police patrol (The 
Guardian 2019b). The stories voicing the rise of Republican dissident activity, of the continual failure to 
re-establish Stormont, of the possible violence in response to a hard border, and of the violent workings 
of binary identity politics are undoubtedly important to tell. Yet, these cannot continue to be the only 
stories told about Northern Ireland. Violence and division must not sustain an originary position. 
A week after violence erupted on the streets of Derry, Turas opened its doors after the summer break 
for the first day of the new academic term. An unprecedented number of people turned up to the total 
beginners class on the Monday morning, with even more people attending the same class on Tuesday 
evening. With so many people attending the concurrent post beginners and total beginners classes on 
the Tuesday evening, sos had to be staggered; there were too many people to fit into the new kitchen 
at one time. As Linda Ervine (2019: n.p.) declared on Facebook, it is a good problem to have. Amongst 
the common and dominant stories of violence and binary division, everyday Belfast pulsates with 
gestures, relations, and activities of care, respect, love, and connectivity that together weave an 
alternative narrative. Peace does respire within the streets of Northern Ireland and we cannot continue 
to reduce this respiration to violence, petrol bombs, and death. It is an autonomous respiration, active 
alongside the enduring violence, but irreducible to it.  
In this thesis, I have applied and extended insights from Luce Irigarays philosophy to the question of an 
everyday, positive, relational ontology of peace. I have mobilised, both theoretically and empirically, 
the encounter as an intimate relation of differentiation active within the practice of breathing. My 
empirical investigation tracing the movements, tempo, rhythms, and relations of breath in the space of 
Turas and the practice of language learning, have strengthened, augmented, and created additional 
insights beyond geographical theories of peace and the encounter. Mobilising a creative and inventive 
feminist politics, my arguments have constructed the following as accounts: curiosity and desire as 
constituting the becoming of queer movements exceeding the inherited truths that orientate 
contemporary bodies and worlds in Northern Ireland to stasis; encounters as relations of differentiation 
in proximity, which through the interplay of wonder, silence, and sharing make an ecological, aerial 
horizon; and peace as woven through an affective and loving ethics of care committed not to the in-
common but the continually becoming of commoning. These accounts challenge the extant and dominant 
theorisations of everyday, positive peace. While peace research traditionally conceives of differences 
as necessarily divisive and agonistic, I have rethought differences as extant, relational, dynamic, and 
autonomous becomings that all bodies share in. This is an understanding that requires we re-evaluate 
underlying assumptions of sociality and our relationship to and with ourselves, others, and worlds.  
I am wholly aware of my optimism both here and throughout the overarching narrative of the thesis. Yet, 
this is a position I have consciously chosen in order to voice an alternative  and desperately needed  
narrative. The stories I have told do not naively avoid violence; they are stories replete with tensions. I 
have sought to engage firmly with the present day to tell stories of peace, but this has not entailed 
avoiding the stories that voice the dark and violent legacies left by the Troubles. The stories told move 
with the tensions between sharing and separation, between the internal and the external, between 
autonomy and relationality, between listening and hearing, between the silence of encounters and the 
hushed silence of self-policing. Tensions between peace and violence, and between different theoretical 
and ontological positions, have not been dismissed. Yet the continuous circle of critique has been 
exceeded. Tensions are not engaged with in a movement of incessant deferral but are held together in 
the active creation and storying of creativity and transformation. This is not to remain within the stasis of 
what is but to opt for speculative potentiality of world-making.  
As an activity of making, this study reveals how moments of peace, woven in often silent relations of 
differentiation in proximity are as originary as moments of violence, agonism, and conflict. Among the 
continuing presence of a divisive political rhetoric and the violent eruption of riots and petrol bombs, 
there are spaces respiring with gestures of and commitments to care. War is not the only story. Gestures 
and relations of peace cannot be left unexamined and under theorised. Exposing the peace, care, and 
love in banal activities such as language learning allows for the telling of important and extant stories 
of everyday contemporary Northern Ireland. The political climate of today accentuates the need for 
such stories and, potentially, beyond the context of Northern Ireland.  
This final concluding chapter reflects upon the small stories of peace which have been told. It, first, pulls 
out and draws together the theoretical, practical, and methodological implications for social sciences, 
the weaving of peace, and related arenas of work. Second, it considers openings to future research.  
8.2 Implicat ions of Research 
A series of implications can be drawn from this research. These implications are both academic and 
practical and they have theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic consequences for the question of 
peace and for geography. This thesis has mobilised a conceptualisation of peace advanced by the 
geographies of peace literature: peace as a fragile, contingent, situated, and positive process of shared 
social practices and relations firmly grounded in the everyday. Wholly committing to this theorisation, 
the thesis contributes to more dynamic conceptualisation of peace and to more transformative practices 
of micropolitical peace-weaving that geographers and others have called for. Yet, the contributions of 
this thesis stem from a different theoretical starting point, more concerned with a feminist approach of 
world-making than the critiques of critical geopolitics and critical geography.  
I have mobilised an ontology of peace that is relational, aerial, ecological, and everyday. This is not 
necessarily a novel ontology, as its roots can be traced back to the thinking of Jane Addams in the early 
twentieth century. Yet, this is an ontology that has largely been overlooked despite the potential it holds 
for altering how we think about, and engage with, the question of peace. A relational, ecological 
ontology opens onto a capacity to theoretically and empirically move with the always-already active 
relations, doings, and gestures of peace that are as originary as, but crucially independent from, 
instances of violence and division. I have provided a positive empirical study of everyday activities and 
practices that mitigate against conflict and division and cultivate positive relations: the choices of love, 
the gestures of care, the commitments to connectivity, the respect of silence, the animation of queer 
movements, and the actions of listening-to. In doing so, I have begun to trace how peaceful relations 
emerge. The question of peace relies as much upon speculative, everyday intervention of peace-
weaving, as it does on positions of critique. Peace-weaving demands an alternative starting point and 
one that cannot be grounded in a Catholic-Protestant binary or any other us-them identarian frames. 
Peace needs other geographers to take up this alternative starting point and provide other examples 
of peace, care, love, and connectivity.  
This is not necessarily a call for others to engage with Irigarays ontology  whilst I do believe this to be 
important  but more a call for the invention and creativity of world-making. It is a call to start from the 
varying and various ontologies of difference that are peaceful relations. I appeal to those interested in 
the geographies of peace to find the alternative starting point that inspires them so we can, together, 
begin to cultivate a portfolio of peaceful examples. Such empirical engagement, I suggest, require the 
movements of an ephemeral, relational vector  such as breath  that holds the potential to animate 
alternative forms of knowing that, although speculative, retain political implications. This requires a 
movement beyond the tropes of critical geopolitics and critical geography. Cultural geographers 
interested in relational, ephemeral, and embodied research subjects have something to offer to the 
questions of politics and peace.   
An approach capable of attending to everyday practice of peace does not only implicate theoretical 
and empirical engagements with peace. I am keen to emphasise such an approach is not merely an 
academic exercise but one with practical implications. The Northern Irish Peace Process doubtlessly 
achieved a great deal. Northern Ireland today, however, is facing unprecedented challenges: Stormont 
has now been suspended for thirty-three months; Brexit is on the horizon and possibly the return of a 
hard border; and, peacebuilding work is navigating a precarious and pressurised funding environment, 
whilst becoming crippled with fatigue. The Northern Ireland Executive has recognised peace to reside in 
building everyday connections and relations that transcend cultural, territorial, and political boundaries. 
Yet, at the same time, it is these divides that cement the continuation of those in power, while those in 
power continue to position themselves as the leaders of peace. What emerged as particularly interesting 
during the research, was a disjuncture between the CTS*s peacebuilding work and the activities of Turas. 
The structure of funding forces the CTS* to align their peacebuilding training packages and programs 
to a vision set forth by the political elite. Turas, in contrast, has largely been removed from these structures 
and, thus, when it has tapped into peacebuilding funding it has made the associated requirements align 
to the practices and activities already active within the space. Whilst CTS* operates within a system 
wherein peace is due to trickle down from the top, Turas is an organic space of peace-weaving which 
was conceived not with the aim of building peace but through transformative obligations of care and 
love.  
Turas illustrates the potential of a Peace Process that connects with the creativity, inventiveness, and care 
of everyday bodies and practices across a variety of spaces. This should be of interest to the wider 
structures of peace: to the Northern Executive Office who are responsible for good relations and social 
change; to the Community Relations Council who are tasked with promoting better community relations 
and recognition of cultural diversity; to organisations in the community and voluntary sector doing 
peacebuilding work across territorial and cultural divisions; and to the funding bodies investing in the 
Northern Irish Peace Process. My contribution, then, is undoubtedly philosophical, but it has the political 
relevance that, while not necessarily providing definitive answers, challenges the workings of the 
Northern Irish Peace Process, the structure of funding, and the political elite vision of peace. It poses 
important questions of how peacebuilding learns from, and builds upon, the transformation and creativity 
respiring in everyday spaces that are weaving peace.  
I would contend that thesis also proposes a series of implications for those interested in the geographies 
of encounter. First, sustained encounters arise much earlier than their manifestation, particularly in spaces 
as divided as Belfast. Bodies that move towards Turas rarely do so on a whim. Rather, there is a whole 
process of relationality, connectivity, questioning, and disconnection active prior to the principal 
encounter. I chose to engage with this process through the concepts and movements of curiosity and 
desire, but other concepts are needed. There is, thus, an urgency for geographers engaging with 
encounters to broaden their focus and attend to the situated relations and disconnections that animate a 
movement towards spaces of encounter. These relations and movements are just as important and 
insightful as what happens in the encounter. What is more, the latter requires the insights animated 
through an engagement with the former.  
This thesis was a direct response to Helen Wilson and Jonathon Darlings (2016) call for critical 
engagement from within geography regarding what happens in spaces of encounter. I opted to think 
the activity of the encounter, in dialogue with Luce Irigaray, through the wonder, silence, and sharing of 
breath. I am not claiming these are the only activities of the encounter and breath to be the only vector 
from which to engage with the event of the encounter. Yet, I have illustrated how the geographies of 
peace literature needs to form relations and connections with ontologies of difference to begin to analyse 
the workings of encounters. Thus, and this is where the next implication lies, encounters are not empty but 
replete with activities, movements, silences, affects, and risks, and it is only when we attend to these that 
we, as geographers, will truly begin to account for the transformative and political potential of 
encounters.  
There have been suggestions among geographers that meaningful encounters, wherein attitudes and 
relations across difference are transformed, are rare and have been romanticised (see Clayton 2009; 
Leitner 2012; Matejskova and Leitner 2011; Mayblin, Valentine and Anderson 2015; Valentine 2008, 
2010). Whilst this is partly a critique regarding the lack of research detailing what happens in 
encounters, it is a position that call for a more careful account of the inequalities and relations of power 
operating within and shaping the effects of encounters (Wilson 2017a: 460). Though valuable, such a 
call risks  mirroring the geographies of peace literature  constructing an originary position for agonism 
and violence and, in turn, the less-than-meaningful or non-meaningful encounter. To commit to encounters 
as opening onto transformative relations of care, love, and connectivity is not, however, to forgo critical 
engagement. Approaching the activity and outcome of encounters in Turas through sharing, did not 
foreclose a critical analysis of the novel borders erected by this space. Engaging with care as predicate 
of peace did not prevent an attentiveness to the disconnections yielded in opting for care. Yet, the 
erection of novel borders and emerging disconnections do not undermine the meaningfulness of 
encounters or their transformative potential and, so, we cannot dismiss them as such. Encounters and 
relations within Turas may not broadly rewrite the city of Belfast, but the immanence of the alternative 
future they create does disrupt what is and opens onto the hope of a different horizon moving before 
the imposition of dualistic form. Just as I contend the need to commit to peace-as-peace, I also appeal 
to geographers to commit to encounters as everyday transformative events.  
Luce Irigarays philosophy has provided the theoretical foundation of this thesis. This is perhaps an 
unprecedented foundation for geographers engaging in peace and, perhaps, a rare theoretical 
foundation for geographers in general. Irigarays thinking has a lot to offer geography. Her thinking  
particularly in its third aspect  offers a novel perspective for considering the politics of peace, everyday 
encounters, and ethical coexistence amongst difference. Yet, the potential of her thinking for geography 
extends far further. For example, her theory of sexuate difference could be engaged with more widely 
among feminist geographers and those engaging with inequalities between men and women, while her 
thinking around nature, culture, and vegetal life offers insights for animal geographies, those engaging 
with the non-human, and work rethinking the relationship between nature and culture. Furthermore, 
Irigarays thinking can be put in, if not always easy, then productive conversations with thinkers widely 
used in geography including Sara Ahmed, Erin Manning, and Mara Puig de la Bellacasa, as I have 
demonstrated, but also Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, and Jane Bennett. Margaret Whitford (1991a: 
6, original emphasis) has argued: the important thing is to engage with Irigaray in order to go beyond 
her. It is, as I hope to have shown, by engaging with but, also, pushing beyond her thinking that Irigarays 
philosophy offers the most for geography.  
Irigarays thinking also has much to offer beyond the realm of philosophy. Irigaray argues she lives 
through her philosophical thinking and it lives through her. There are difficulties and tensions in applying 
Irigaray philosophy to real life and I am aware this can result in perhaps a reductive use of Irigarays 
work, as well as a disservice to the lived worlds of people and place. Yet, the potentialities that arise 
from experimenting with Irigarays thought override concerns of reduction. Engaging with the encounter 
as a relation of differentiation in proximity composed via the element of breath may, at first, seem 
somewhat abstract, but it has been in drawing out oscillating tensions between relationality and 
autonomy that I have been able to reveal practical implications for peace, sharing, and ethics. The 
problem at hand is that relationality and autonomy or, relatedly, sharing and difference are 
approached as two separate processes and two different forms of sociality. Relationality and sharing 
are purported as peaceful, while autonomy and difference are disregarded as violent and divisive. 
Peace processes then become predicated upon displacing difference with commonness. Yet, it is by 
holding relationality and autonomy in tension that alternative, peace-full worlds will be created in which 
there is neither a reduction to oppositional sameness or an external imposition of equivalent sameness; 
living must respire in-between verticality and horizontality.  
Engaging with Irigaray philosophy from a geographic position valuing fieldwork, has prompted a series 
of methodological implications. Irigarays thinking suggests a methodological approach characterised 
by openness, being in-between, and excess and geographers may find, as I have, an engagement with 
Irigarays work offers productive methodological lines of flight. Geography has increasingly become 
concerned with creative methodologies and methods. A methodology of tracing provides an accessible 
and productive opening towards creativity. While tracing is not necessarily a call for novel, highly 
creative research methods, a methodological position of tracing does, however, alter how we engage 
with traditional research methods. I suggest before we search for and embrace novel and creative 
methods, there is value in making common geographic methods dance a little, a capacity which arises 
with novel methodological positions such as tracing. A methodology of tracing can be applied to other 
geographical areas of interest, particularly where the research focus is more ephemeral and embodied 
such as affect, wonder, enchantment, vital materialism, and elemental geographies. Just because 
something is not perceptible does not mean that it cannot be researched. Yet, it will require an entangled, 
situated, embodied, excessive, and relational methodological position.  
Finally, this thesis has implications for understanding everyday Northern Ireland for those living it. 
Irigarays thinking around standardisation and inherited truth, offers a lens for understanding the stasis 
of violence in contemporary times. Standardisation engages with the past through the present, rather 
than simply imposing the past onto the present. Attending to the dance of recognition as a prefiltered 
performance, animated the insight that recognition is not always compelled by fear per se, but from a 
fear of offending the other. Whilst this still reduces bodies to objects, these nuances and shifts in the 
narrative are key to understanding contemporary Northern Ireland. 
Northern Ireland is facing unprecedented challenges. There are concerns the achievements of the Good 
Friday Agreement could be undermined. Yet amongst territorial segregation, political division, violent 
dissident activity, and a possible hard border, there are reasons to be hopeful. Everyday bodies and 
spaces are weaving peace-full relations and creating an alternative peace-full horizon. As Turas and 
Linda Ervines own story voice, a commitment to this creation is not an easy choice but it is transformative. 
Peace for Northern Ireland exists in the future, but the moments, gestures, relations, and spaces of its 
creations are immanent, and it is in committing to their reiteration that the future of peace moves always 
closer. Perhaps, then, an implication of this thesis lies in affirming the difficult commitments people of 
Northern Ireland are making for the sake of a better and peace-full future.  
The implications I have drawn out are by no means exhaustive. I would ask others to read this thesis in 
the way I have engaged with both literature and with the field: push my thinking beyond me. To search 
for and create novel and, perhaps speculative, theoretical and practical relations and connections from 
the stories I have told. The tensions animated in such interaction should not be flattened but explored as 
novel and productive movements of wonder arise in-between. Stories of peace, of Northern Ireland, of 
encounters and relations, and of an Irigarayan geography must continue to breathe.     
8.3 Openings to Future Research 
The stories told in this thesis are not created from a linear journey. They emerge out of a tracing 
characterised by false starts, halting stops, unsurprising changes of direction, uncomfortable turns, 
difficult choices, and unexpected opportunities. The stories told could have been woven into many 
different narratives, whilst other stories remain untold. Before closing, then, it seems pertinent to briefly 
consider potential avenues for future research. These future avenues utilise the narrative that has been 
told as a starting point from which to weave, build on and further trouble the unfinished findings voiced 
in this project. 
The implications of this thesis largely stem from Turas. Yet, my engagement with this space was not 
exhaustive. Turas is growing and its activities are widening. At the beginning of this academic year it 
opened an Irish language library in the Skainos centre, and it is continuing to pursue the vision of an Irish 
Medium nursery and primary school in east Belfast. Turas offers Gaelic tours of east Belfast that year 
on year are increasing in popularity, and coordinates the Fil Conn ONeill which celebrates the last 
Gaelic Lord of east Belfast. These widening activities offer potential spaces for future research. 
Additionally, there are a plethora of other everyday spaces in which the question of peace could be 
approached through the vector of breath, these include communal choirs, yoga studios, sports clubs, 
amateur dramatics groups, dance schools, walking clubs, and cycling clubs. An interesting space to begin 
my next research endeavour would be with the collaboration between the Hounds of Ulster and the 
McCullough-Curran School of Irish dance. 
The Hounds of Ulster are a traditional Irish and Ulster Scots music group whose roots are firmly located 
in the Unionist marching band tradition. Marching bands in Northern Ireland  much like the Irish language 
 are controversial. They are synonymous with Loyalism, with the 12th of July celebrations and, ultimately, 
with violence and intimidation towards the Catholic community. In contrast, Irish dancing is firmly aligned 
to the communal Catholic line of orientation. In 2015 the Hounds of Ulster and McCullough-Curran School 
of Irish dance came together to perform a specially choreographed short Irish dance to the traditional 
music of marching bands (McParland 2017, see figure 25). Since 2015 the collaboration between the 
two groups has grown and, to date, they have performed across Belfast, at Stormont, at the All Ireland 
Final in Croke Park in Dublin, at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, at the Fleadh Cheoil na hireann 
and, most recently, for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall when they visited Northern Ireland 
in May 2019.  
Figure. 25. Hounds of Ulster with the McCullough-Curran School of Irish dance on the 6th June 
2019 (Hounds of Ulster 2019: n.p.). 
Participation between the Ulster Hounds and the Irish dancers challenges the cultural, territorial, and 
identarian divisions of Northern Ireland. It provides a further space to attend to everyday, relational 
weavings of peace through the vector of air. Furthermore, this collaboration provides an interesting space 
to consider the tensions between sustained and fleeting encounters: the two groups come together on a 
sustained basis, but the performances are fleeting encounters for their audiences. The collaboration also 
offers a space for attending to the interaction between violence and peace across generations in 
Northern Ireland, and an interesting space to consider the workings of inherited truths, and their stasis, 
with regards to the living and dynamic vitality of relationality and extant gestures of care. In thinking 
through air and, so, the question of peaceful and ethical atmospheres and performance, this project 
would add to an understanding of an embodied ontology of peace. What is more, an attention to 
elemental, speculative atmospheres open a path for considering more overtly the question of a peace-
full commoning gestured to in this thesis: an enveloping and politics that is not territorial but aerial and 
atmospheric.  
The thesis animated an account of peace weaving situated in the context of post-conflict Northern Ireland. 
War has, however, inflicted countries across the world and many post-conflict and war-torn nations are 
faced with the question of peace. Ontological and relational accounts of peace promote understandings 
and practices of peace that are contextual and variable across time and space (Bregazzi and Jackson 
2018: 88). This thesis offers a starting point for attending to everyday, already-active relations of 
peacebuilding in other countries and nations that is contextually attentive to how differences emerge 
and influence peace in the socio-spatio context in question. Putting different situated accounts in dialogue 
will build up a more comprehensive understanding of the weaving of peace and no doubt such dialogues 
would animate new movements of peace-weaving, open new avenues for research, and produce new 
challenges to grapple with. 
The question of peace extends far beyond violence and war. A project seeking and detailing political 
alternatives to hierarchical and conflictual binaries, which potentially emerge within everyday relations 
across difference, has taken on greater urgency in recent times (Fincher et al. 2019). In the current 
political climate of polarisation and extremism, addressing questions of peace, care, ethics, and sharing 
are as important as ever. Identity, on both the political right and left, is wielded as a weapon in public 
discourses (Jones 2019: 110) which, in turn, promotes and compels extreme positions and actions in the 
everyday. This thesis provides a springboard for considering a politics not of hate and identity, but of 
love and communing  a shift from a genealogical, rooted identity to ecological, aerial relationalities. 
Thus, potentially, the thesis opens onto an avenue of future research engaging with peace and sharing 
not in war-torn and post-conflict states, but with states facing acute challenges from increasing political 
extremes.  
8.4 An Open Ending 
In its wake, this thesis leaves perhaps more questions than answers. There are many loose ends calling 
out for attention. Yet, I never set out to provide definitive answers, to determine what it meant to be 
Catholic or Protestant in Northern Ireland or to name the multiple and varying differences that are 
emerging. I did not aim to produce a conclusive representation of what happens in encounters nor did I 
intend to construct a static vision of what gestures of care look like. These are not possible.  
My desire was to trace breath in its situated and entangling movements. I hoped to be an embodied, 
attentive, and compassionate researcher who listened-to the people, space, and relations of Northern 
Ireland. I sought to tell the small stories that mattered to this space and these people, and to weave a 
narrative that spoke, if speculatively, of something novel, transformative, and peace-full. This is unlikely 
to change the normative stasis and division characterising contemporary Belfast or put an end to violence. 
Nor will it halt the eruption of dissident paramilitary activity, solve the issues of the Northern Irish border, 
or prompt the reinstating of Stormont. Yet, at the everyday, micropolitical level something is happening, 
and we cannot continue to be ignored this something. It is an everyday, modest transformation wherein 
people are living and acting beyond, before, and in excess of rooted divisions and normative identarian 
orientations, as they choose to care for relations in-between differences, and to answer curious calls and 
embodied desires. This transformation of living, relating, and becoming holds the capacity to change our 
understanding of Northern Ireland, of peace, and of difference and to change our understanding is to 
change the world in small and sometimes major ways (Gibson-Graham 2008: 615, original emphasis).  
My research has shown peace to be the making of everyday, care-full relations woven in-between 
bodies and worlds to actively unfold an alternative, transformed horizon we are always-already part 
of. The shared worlds, bodies, and relations active within such a horizon cannot be known; they reside in 
the groundless ground of the future. We cannot then approach peace as a blueprint to be achieved, 
but neither should we seek to engineer a novelty that has never before been experienced. Peace exists 
in the future but, as this thesis illustrates, this is an immanent future respiring in the present. 
To move with breath is not to confine the making of worlds, and the extant process of peace-weaving 
present within them, to stasis. To move with breath is to animate an extant, embodied openness to 
dynamic and speculative potentialities, possibilities, and creations always-already unfolding within the 
now. To move with breath is to not know where you will end or, more precisely, to not have an ending. 
Epilogue 
Breathing the continual weaving of peace 
Siting crossed legged with his guitar resting gently on his knees, his low, timbred voice began to move with 
the sounds and rhythm of a gentle Celtic tune. The music filled the air and drew in the bodies sitting 
relaxed on their yoga mats. Whether prompted by a nod of the head or simply by a compelling sensation 
to actively participate in this moment, a voice somewhere else in the room began to sing. A soft, high 
pitched tone interlaced with the low, timbred sounds, quiet a first but quickly growing in depth and 
resonance.  
Other tones were soon folding into the melody. Different voices, words, and sounds touched upon one and 
other as the air swelled with a shared harmony. I did not know the words, but found my body beginning to 
stir, to move, to connect. A gentle, embodied humming added to the tune. The sounds of my own breath 
rose and swirled within the air, where it became entangled among the other tones and voices. It was not 
the usual close to a yoga practice, but an energy filled my body and pulsed around the room.  
The sounds became louder, richer, and more alive, as a breath weaved in-between the bodies in the 
making of a shared, present world. A composure, a peace, a caring gentleness woven from sharing in the 
breath of this Gaelic tune.
