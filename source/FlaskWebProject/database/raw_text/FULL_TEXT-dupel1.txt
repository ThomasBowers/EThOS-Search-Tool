Abstract
This thesis entitled Deformation of 113Cs from Proton-emission and Electro-
magnetic Transition Rates was submitted by Mr Duncan Hodge on the 5th
of December 2016 to the University of Manchester for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy.
Studying nuclei beyond the proton dripline can provide valuable information on
the structure of nuclei at the limits of stability, where the strong nuclear force
starts to be overcome by Coulomb repulsion between protons. Simple experi-
mental observables, such as excitation energies and lifetimes of excited states in
these proton-unbound nuclei can provide information on the nuclear wavefunc-
tion. Experimental data, such as that presented in this work, can then be used
to improve models of nuclear structure at the proton dripline.
This thesis presents data from a recoil-decay tagged differential plunger experi-
ment undertaken at the University of Jyvaskyla in 2014. A fusion-evaporation
reaction was used to populate excited states in the deformed ground-state proton
emitter 113Cs. The JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT experimental setup was used to
correlate  rays emitted from these excited states with protons emitted from 113Cs
and the differential plunger for unbound nuclear states (DPUNS) was placed at
the target position to measure the excited state lifetimes.
The lifetime of the (11/2+) state in the most intense rotational band of 113Cs was
measured to be  = 24(6) ps, while a limit of   5 ps was found for the lifetime
of the higher energy (15/2+) state. The lifetime of proton emission was measured
to be  = 24.2(2) s.
The experimental data were used to test the predictions of a nonadiabatic quasi-
particle model for proton-emitting nuclei, which was employed to deduce the
deformation of the states in 113Cs. Wavefunctions from the nonadiabatic quasi-
particle model were used to independently calculate proton-emission rates, -ray
transition rates and excited state energies as functions of deformation. The de-
formation of 113Cs could then be extracted from the intersection of the different
theoretical values and experimental observables. A deformation of 2 = 0.22(6)
was extracted from the (11/2+) excitation energy and lifetime. The deforma-
tion values taken from the proton-emission rate and the lifetime limit of the
(15/2+) state were also consistent with this value. The consistency of the different
deformations calculated shows the effectiveness of the nonadiabatic quasiparticle
method when used to calculate the properties of deformed ground-state proton-
emitters.

Chapter 1
Introduction
This thesis presents data on the ground-state proton-emitting nucleus 113Cs.
Ground-state single-proton emission occurs in odd-Z nuclei where the valence
proton is no longer bound by the nuclear potential [1, 2]. Such nuclei are said to
lie beyond the proton drip-line, where the Q value for proton emission becomes
positive and the nuclear force starts to be overcome by the Coulomb repulsion
between protons. Therefore, by studying nuclei at the proton-dripline the limits
to the strength of the nuclear force can be deduced. Also of great importance
in studying proton-emitting nuclei, is the fact that simple experimental observ-
ables, such as the energy and half-life of proton decay may be used to provide
information on components of the nuclear wave function [3].
The rate of proton-emission is subject to the width of the centrifugal barrier,
which, along with the Coulomb barrier must be tunneled through before the
proton can leave the nucleus. As the height of the centrifugal barrier is propor-
tional to the orbital angular momentum of the proton, the nuclear structure of
the parent can be inferred from the emission-rate and energy of the proton [4].
The coupling of weakly bound and unbound nuclear states to the continuum may
then also be examined. In order for the nuclear wave function to be correctly ex-
tracted, a well-developed theoretical model is needed. Experimental data is also
needed to refine and test these models to see if the observed nuclear properties
can be consistently reproduced.
Ground-state proton emitters have been experimentally identified in several areas
of the nuclear chart with masses of A = 109-185 [6], as shown in Fig. 1.1.
Different models then have to be developed for these different regions where

isotopes are denoted by the red squares and the location of 113Cs, the nucleus

nuclei may have different shapes. Nuclei with numbers of neutrons or protons
that are close to magic numbers, denoted by the black lines in Fig. 1.1 will
assume a more spherical shape. Various proton-emission models, which consider
the proton as tunneling from a spherically symmetric potential, may then be
successfully used to predict proton-decay rates and the excitation energies and
spins of states in the decaying nucleus [1, 2, 7]. However, these models do not
successfully replicate proton-emission rates of nuclei, which lie away from closed
shells. For example, the spherical Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) calculations
of Aberg et al. [1, 2], predicted a proton-emission half-life from the d5/2 state
in 113Cs of 0.9 s, when the spectroscopic factor for the d5/2 state is included.
This is a factor of 19 times shorter than the established experimental value
[812]. This result indicates that 113Cs is deformed, which is in agreement with
the global deformation calculations of Moller and Nix [13]. These calculations
predict that neutron-deficient caesium isotopes are deformed, even as the N=50
shell closure is approached, as shown in Fig. 1.2, and that 113Cs itself has a
quadrupole deformation of 2 = 0.21. Therefore, proton-emission models which
assume a spherical shape for the nucleus are no longer adequate to interpret

the experimental energies and half-lives from 113Cs. It is then important to
develop a model of proton emission which considers the proton decaying through
a deformed potential and accounts for the collective excitations that result from
the deformation.
A model of proton-emission from a deformed nucleus was provided by Maglione
et al. [14], who introduced an exact expression for the decay width of the proton-
emitting state in a deformed potential. This adiabatic approach considered the
proton as occupying a single-particle orbit coupled to a rigid core with a frozen
rotational spectrum and an infinite moment of inertia. Although this model suc-
cessfully replicated the experimental half-lives of many nuclei [15], it did not allow
for cases where the core was less rigid and did not account for the strong mixing
of states due to the Coriolis interaction. For this scenario where nucleons in the
core and the unbound proton may influence each other, the pairing interaction
becomes increasingly important. Improved calculations within a nonadiabatic

quasiparticle approach have since been made that take into account the Coriolis
and pairing interactions [16]. The rotational spectrum of the daughter nucleus
is also included to provide a more accurate structure for the nuclear core. A
summary of the adiabatic and nonadiabatic approaches is shown in Fig. 1.3.
Introduction 21
In order to validate the nonadiabatic framework, experimental data from de-
formed, proton-emitting nuclei, such as 113Cs [13, 14, 17], are needed. Addition-
ally, 113Cs is predicted to have two candidate proton-emitting Nilsson orbits of
K = 1/2+ and K = 3/2+ which lie very close in energy to each other [15] and are
strongly affected by the Coriolis interaction. These strongly mixed orbits pro-
vide a good test for the inclusion of the Coriolis interaction in the nonadiabatic
quasiparticle model.
Proton emission from 113Cs was first discovered in 1984 by Faestermann et al.
[8]. In that work the production cross section of 113Cs was established to be
30 b from the 58Ni(58Ni,p2n) reaction at 230 MeV [911]. This production
cross-section provided enough prompt  rays from 113Cs to make the nucleus
viable for study using the recoil-decay tagging differential plunger setup of the
University of Jyvaskyla [1821]. The nucleus 113Cs has previously been studied
using this setup without the plunger in an experiment, described in Ref. [12].
This experiment was undertaken to extend and more firmly characterise the level
scheme above the proton emitting state first observed in Ref. [22]. Two rotational
bands had configurations assigned from aligned angular momentum behaviour,
observed band crossings and blocking arguments. The more intense band, band
1, was assigned to be based upon a g7/2 [422]3/2 proton configuration while the
second rotational band, band 2, was assigned to be based upon a d5/2 [420]1/2
proton configuration.
The data presented in this work were collected using the University of Jyvaskyla
recoil-decay-tagged differential plunger setup in an experiment undertaken in
2014. The objectives of the experiment were to measure the deformation of 113Cs
from the excitation energy and lifetime of the (11/2+) state in band 1 and the
lifetime of proton emission, in order to test the predictions of the nonadiabatic
quasiparticle method. The presence of the Differential Plunger for Unbound Nu-
clear States (DPUNS) [21] at the target position of the recoil-decay tagging setup
allowed for the measurement of promptly decaying excited states in 113Cs. The
lifetime of the (11/2+) state in band 1 was measured using DPUNS, while an
upper limit was found for the lifetime of the (15/2+) state. The experimental
(11/2+) state lifetime was compared to theoretical lifetime values, which were cal-
culated as a function of deformation using wave functions extracted within the
framework of the nonadiabatic quasiparticle approach developed for the proton-
emission. By observing the deformation at which the theoretical and experimental
Introduction 22
half-lives of the (11/2+) state intersected, the deformation of the nucleus could
be inferred. Experimental proton-emission rates and excited state energies were
also compared with theoretical values from the model, calculated for different
nuclear deformations. The advantage of using the lifetime of the excited state
in (11/2+) to attempt to infer the deformation of the nucleus lies in the greater
sensitivity of the electromagnetic transition rate calculation to the deformation
of the nucleus than the proton-emission rate and excitation energy calculations.
Furthermore, the excited state lifetime provides an additional means of calculat-
ing the deformation from a common set of nonadiabatic quasiparticle model wave
functions within a consistent approach which provides another means of testing
the predictive power of the model [16].
The lifetime of the (11/2+) state in band 1 of 113Cs was measured to be  =24(6)
ps and the limit on the lifetime of the (15/2+) state was found to be   5 ps.
Using the lifetime and excitation energy of the (11/2+) state, a deformation of
2 = 0.22(6) was found for
113Cs. Consistent deformations of 2 > 0.19 and
  0.22 were also found from the lifetime limit of the (15/2+) state and the
proton emission rate of 113Cs, respectively.
In subsequent chapters, this thesis will present the evolution of proton-emission
theory, as well as the properties of -ray decay and the effects and causes of
nuclear deformation. The experimental setup and technique, including the mea-
surement of prompt excited state lifetimes, are also discussed in more detail. A
comprehensive discussion of the results is presented along with a discussion of
the possibility of future experiments which may be undertaken to provide a more
accurate value for the deformation of 113Cs.
Chapter 2
Theory
In this work, data on the proton-emitting nucleus 113Cs is presented. In order to
successfully interpret this data a framework is needed to coherently describe the
observed properties of the nucleus, such as its half-life and level structure. Such
a framework is provided by the nonadiabatic quasiparticle model [16], which was
used to extract the wave functions of the proton-emitting state in 113Cs. These
wave functions could then be used to interpret the observed excitation energies
and lifetimes of the excited (11/2+) and (15/2+) states in 113Cs, as well as its
proton-emission lifetime, in terms of the deformation of the nucleus. By using
the same wave functions to predict the different properties of the nucleus, a
consistent method of measuring the nuclear deformation from proton-emission
rates, electromagnetic transition rates and excited state energies was achieved.
This Chapter will cover the need for the development of the nonadiabatic quasi-
particle model with reference to other proton-emission models. The factors that
cause protonemission and the associated nuclear structure concepts are also dis-
cussed. Additionally, the properties of -ray decay of excited nuclear states and
how it may provide information on nuclear deformation is also covered.
Theory 24
2.1 Proton Emission
If the binding energy per nucleon increases by emitting a given particle, then a
nucleus will generally be unstable and will eventually decay through the emission
of that particle. TheQ value defines the amount of energy released in such a decay
and will be greater than 0 for these unstable nuclei. In very neutron-deficient
nuclei the Q value for proton emission will be high enough, that proton emission
can compete with the  and + decay modes. These nuclei at the proton drip-
line possess protons that occupy unbound states with energies greater than the
depth of the nuclear potential. However, due to the presence of Coulomb and
centrifugal barriers the protons are still confined to the nucleus for a period of
time before being emitted. The Q value of proton decay consists of a nuclear
component and an electronic component in the form,
Sp = Qp = Qnucp + ES, (2.1)
where, Sp is the proton separation energy, describing the amount of energy that
is needed to separate a proton from the nucleus,
Qnucp =Mnuc(N,Z)Mnuc(N,Z  1)mp (2.2)
ES = Be(N,Z)Be(N,Z  1). (2.3)
The electron screening component, ES, reduces the height of the Coulomb bar-
rier and is given by the difference between the total electron binding energy of
the atomic electrons in the parent nucleus, Be(N,Z) and the daughter nucleus,
Theory 25
Be(N,Z  1). It can be calculated using tabulated electron binding energies [23]
or from the approximation
ES = 0.49 + 0.0144Z1.6 keV, (2.4)
which gives an accuracy of <0.5% for 42 < Z < 75 and drops to 1.6% at Z = 83
Proton-emitting nuclei have been observed in several mass regions of the nuclear
chart but are hard to access experimentally due to their short half-lives. Proton-
emission was first observed in 1970 from a I=19 isomeric state in 53Co [24],
while ground-state proton emission was first observed in the nucleus 151Lu in
1982 [25]. Over forty proton emitters have since been observed [3]. The data
presented in this work provides information on the ground-state proton emitter
113Cs which was first observed in 1984 by Faestermann et al. [8]. The area of
the nuclear chart including 113Cs is shown in Fig. 2.1. This figure shows how
113Cs is one of the most neutron-deficient nuclei that can currently be produced
and studied. The special importance of studying proton-emitting nuclei lies in
the fact that properties of the nuclear wave function can be extracted from the
relatively simple observables of the half-life and energy of the proton decay [3].
Various different theoretical approaches have been used to model the emission
of protons from nuclei. The proton is commonly treated as tunneling from a
central nuclear potential through a potential barrier, consisting of Coulomb and
centrifugal components [3]. An example potential experienced by a proton in a
nucleus, including the Coulomb and centrifugal barriers, is shown in Fig. 2.2
In Fig. 2.2 the nuclear potential takes the form of a Woods-Saxon potential,
subsequently described in section 2.2. The Coulomb potential behaves differently
within and beyond the nuclear radius. For a spherical nucleus the potential takes
the form of

for r > RCou, (2.6)
where Zp is the charge on the single proton, Znuc is the charge on the nuclear
core, r is the distance from the proton to the centre of the nucleus and Rcou is
where the nuclear potential becomes infinitesimal. The centrifugal force acts to
push nucleons away from the centre of the core [26]. The corresponding potential
barrier takes the form of
Vcent =
l(l + 1)
, (2.7)
where  is the reduced mass of the proton and core.
Early proton-emission calculations assumed a spherical shape for the nucleus to
theoretically reproduce experimental half-lives and energies [1, 2, 27]. These ap-
proaches were based on the consideration of the proton occupying single-particle

states defined by a mean potential similar to that shown in Fig. 2.2. In order
to explain these models, the predictive power and evolution of the single-particle
shell model is first described in the next section.
2.2 The Single-Particle Shell Model
The single-particle shell model accounts for many properties of the nucleus that
were not well described by earlier nuclear structure models [28]. For example,
Theory 28
Figure 2.3: The variation of binding energy per nucleon for a series of nuclei
of different mass numbers A. Taken from Refs. [29, 30].
earlier models were unable to explain the sharp decreases in the binding energy
per nucleon for nuclei with certain numbers of protons or neutrons, as shown in
Fig. 2.3. These sudden changes in binding energy have been found at N and
Z values of 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, which are known as the magic numbers.
Similar dramatic changes in binding energy are seen at the closures of atomic
electron shells. The single-particle shell model then draws on similarities with
atomic electron structures by treating nucleons as occupying discrete states within
a mean potential [26].
A key difference between the atomic and the nuclear potential is that the atomic
potential arises from the Coulomb interaction between the nuclear protons and
the atomic electrons, while the nuclear potential arises from the strong force be-
tween individual nucleons. A nuclear mean field is then needed as the calculation
of the nuclear force acting on an individual nucleon from a many-body calculation
is only possible for the lightest nuclei [31]. Orbits within the nuclear potential
are sequentially filled by the nucleons according to the energy of each level. In
the simplest version of the shell model, the different energy levels are described in
Theory 29
terms of their orbital angular momentum, l and the index n, which simply states
the number of states with that particular angular momentum. Each l state is de-
generate, with the occupancy of each n, l level being (2l+1). Nucleons within each
l orbit occupy sub-orbitals defined by the eigenvalues of the z component of l, ml.
Nucleons will occupy ml sub-orbitals with values of ml = 1,2,3, ...,l for
each l orbit. There is no energy dependance on which ml sub-orbital is occupied
within a given l orbit [26].
The theoretical spacing of the energy levels within the nucleus is largely governed
by the form of the chosen nuclear potential. The observed increases in binding
energy at the magic numbers should be reflected by large energy gaps after closed
shells. The simple harmonic potential is a reasonable starting potential to use
as it describes the n and l orbits falling into degenerate multiplets, resulting in
a shell structure rather than evenly spaced energy levels [31]. Using a simple
harmonic potential the nuclear magic numbers are seen to be replicated at the
closed shells at N,Z = 2, 8, 20 but higher energy levels do not show the correct
shell closures in line with experimental data.
The Woods-Saxon potential may be a more realistic approximation of the mean
potential experienced by individual nucleons. The potential provides a finite
depth of the well and smooth variation to zero at the well edges, which closely
mirrors the charge and mass distribution of the nucleus [26]. The Woods-Saxon
potential takes the form of
V (r) =
1 + exp[(r R)/a]
, (2.8)
where V0 is the depth of the potential, r is the radial distance from the centre of
the nucleus, R is the mean radius of the nucleus and a is the skin thickness, de-
scribing the change in the nuclear density, within which the value of the potential
changes from 0.1V0 to 0.9V0. A visual comparison between the Simple Harmonic
and Woods-Saxon potentials is shown in Fig. 2.4.
Neither the Woods-Saxon or Simple Harmonic potentials reproduce the magic
numbers observed experimentally, when the energy levels are described in terms
of their l quantum numbers. However, by describing the states in terms of their
total angular momentum, j, the spacing of energy levels is to agree more succes-
fully with those observed experimentally. The total angular momentum number
Theory 30

monic oscillator, HO, and Woods-Saxon, WS, potentials as a function of dis-
tance, r, from the centre of the nucleus. Taken from Ref. [32].
accounts for the fact that the intrinsic spin of nucleons, s = 1
couples to the
angular momentum, l, of the nucleon in the energy level it occupies. This gives
total angular momentum, j, values of l  1
. The spin-orbit interaction causes
the splitting of the l energy levels, the magnitude of which is proportional to the
angular momentum, l, of the unsplit state. This is given by equation 2.9,
l.sj=l1/2  l.sj=l+1/2 =
(2l  1)~. (2.9)
Parallel coupling of the angular momentum and intrinsic spin is favoured, so the
energy of the higher-spin state is less than the lower-spin state. The inclusion
of the spin-orbit term now results in the accurate replication of the experimen-
tally observed magic numbers for both the Simple Harmonic and Woods-Saxon
potentials. However, the ordering and spacing of single-particle orbits may vary
depending on the mass of the nucleus considered as well as the strength of cer-
tain interactions between individual nucleons, which are discussed later in the
Chapter.
The j and l values are used to identify individual shell model orbits with the
l values described using the spectroscopic notation where, l = s, p, d, f, g, h...
when a simple harmonic potential, Woods-Saxon potential and Woods-Saxon
Theory 31
potential with a spin-orbit term are used to predict the nuclear structure are
shown in Fig. 2.5.
Excitation of the nucleus may cause nucleons to be raised to higher-energy states
within the potential. As the nucleus will naturally tend to its lowest energy state,
these states are unstable and the nucleus will eventually decay to its ground state.
This decay may proceed via intermediate excited states. The most common
means of de-excitation from excited nuclear states is through the emission of 
rays. Examining the properties of these  rays can then tell us about the internal
structure of the nucleus. The rules governing -ray transitions are described in
the next section.
2.3 Gamma-ray Decay
Transitions between excited states in the nucleus are largely mediated by -ray
decays. When a nucleus decays from an excited state, Ii, to a lower energy state,
If , a photon will commonly be emitted with a certain energy, parity and angular
momentum, which is dependent on the properties of Ii and If . By characteris-
ing the -ray emission from a certain nucleus, initial and final properties of the
changing nucleus can be inferred [34].
2.3.1 Selection Rules
The properties of  rays emitted from the nucleus are largely dictated by a set
of selection rules. Due to the possible vector sums of angular momenta, a  ray
effecting a nuclear transition, between two states with angular momenta Ii and
If , may have angular momentum in the range,
|Ii + If | > L > |Ii  If |, (2.10)
where L is the angular momentum of the  ray, which may have any integer
value between these limits [26].

Theory 33
The  rays emitted from the nucleus can be described as either electric or
magnetic. Electric  rays change the electric moment of the nucleus while
magnetic transitions change the magnetic moment of the nucleus [35]. The 
rays are also described by their angular momentum, so that they are labelled as
EL or ML.
Depending on whether the transition is electric or magnetic, the parity of the
radiation field can be calculated by
(ML) = (1)L+1 (2.11)
(EL) = (1)L , (2.12)
where (ML) and (EL) indicate the parity change for a magnetic or electric
transition, respectively. As shown by equation 2.10, -ray decays can proceed
with various different angular momenta between the same initial and final states,
forming mixed multipolarity transitions. As parity between initial and final states
is conserved and the transition rates are dependent on the angular momentum of
the emitted  ray (see next section), the most common mixed transitions have
multipolarities of E2-M1 [36].
2.3.2 Gamma-ray Transition Rates
Transition rates between excited nuclear states can provide valuable nuclear struc-
ture information. For example, excited state lifetimes can provide information
on the shape of nuclei [37], changes in nuclear structure at certain excitation en-
ergies [38] and the amount of collective versus single-particle behaviour in nuclei
[39, 40]. The lifetime of a decay from one nuclear state to another can be mea-
sured experimentally and compared to theoretical estimates to access this nuclear
structure information [41]. The transition probability, , between two states, Ii
and If , can be described in terms of reduced matrix elements between the two
states [42], such that,
Theory 34
(L) =
8(L+ 1)
~L((2L+ 1))2
)2L+1
B(L : Ii  If ), (2.13)
where L and E are the angular momentum and energy of the -ray transition, 
denotes either an E orM transition and B(L : Ii  If ) is the reduced transition
probability, given by [43]
B(L : Ii  If ) =
2Ii + 1
If O Ii2 , (2.14)
where O is either Q, the electric, or M , the magnetic, multipole operator depend-
ing on whether  is E orM ,
O Ii is the reduced matrix element, governing
the decay between states Ii and If by the  ray of angular momentum L. The
dominance of the double factorial L term in equation 2.13 means that higher
multipole  ray decays will have severely hindered decay probabilities compared
to lower multipole decays.
The Weisskopf estimates provide lifetime estimates for a single-particle -ray de-
cay by considering the transition to proceed with a single unmixed multipolarity
equivalent to |Ii  If | (known as a stretched transition) [44]. For single-particle
transitions the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the multipolarity of the
emitted  ray, therefore only the stretched transition needs to be considered [33].
The transition probability as stated in 2.13 is used to give the single-particle tran-
sition rate with the inclusion of the Weisskopf reduced matrix elements [45, 46],
given by
B(Wu : EL) =
1.22L
3 e2fm2L, (2.15)
for electric transitions and
B(Wu :ML) =

fm2L2, (2.16)
for magnetic transitions. In these equations, A is the mass of the nucleus and L is
the multipolarity of the -ray transition. The magnetic reduced matrix elements
are given in units of
fm2L2, whereM is the mass of the nucleon, while the
Theory 35
electric reduced matrix elements are given in units of e2fm2L. Using equations
2.15, 2.16 and 2.13 gives the simple reduced transition probabilities listed in Table
2.1. If the lifetimes of excited nuclear states are seen to significantly differ from
these values then a single-particle, spherical picture of the nucleus may not be
accurate, as is discussed further in Subsection 2.5.3.

Proton-emission rates can also provide information on nuclear structure, such as
angular momentum assignments of proton-emitting states. In a similar manner to
-ray decay, accurate theoretical models are needed to interpret the experimental
data. The next section examines the predictive power of three such models that
are based on proton-emission in spherical nuclei.
2.4 Spherical Models of Proton Emission
Models of proton-emitting nuclei commonly consider the proton occupying a qua-
sistationary state [1, 2], characterised as a long-lived out-of-equilibrium state
which is affected by a long-range interaction [47]. Quasistationary states are also
defined as having a finite decay width, , where the decay-width is linked to the
half-life, T1/2, of the state by
T1/2 =
~ln(2)
. (2.17)
Theory 36
For the case of spherical proton-emitting nuclei, the exact decay width of the
quasistationary state can be calculated.
The wave function of the outgoing proton, outlj , with total and orbital angular
momenta of j and l, respectively, is given by
outlj = Nlj[Glj + iFlj], (2.18)
where Nlj is a normalisation constant and Glj and Flj are, respectively, the ir-
regular and regular Coulomb wave functions. These wave functions are solutions
to the Laplacian in the Coulomb wave equation, which is itself given by the
Schrodinger equation including a Coulomb potential. The regular and irregular
Coulomb functions give the solutions to the Coulomb equation in the classically
allowed and classically forbidden regions, respectively. The normalisation con-
stant, Nlj is found by matching the wave function of the outgoing proton, 
to the solution of the Schrodinger equation of the un-emitted proton, lj, which
obeys the condition lj(r = 0) = 0 and has outgoing boundary conditions at
the point, R, where the nuclear potential ceases to have an effect on the proton.
This wave function defines the proton as occupying a Gamow state, which is the
natural wave function of a resonant quasibound state [48, 49]. The decay width
of the state is given by the solution for the decay width of a Gamow state which
can be solved using several different approaches [5052]. The expression for the
decay width of a proton-emitting state in a spherical nucleus is then
(R) =
R2 |lj(R)|
F 2lj(R) +G
lj(R)
, (2.19)
where  is the reduced mass of the proton orbiting the nucleus and k =
2E/~
is the wave number of the proton. In Ref. [51] the Schrodinger equation is solved
for the Gamow state, leading to solutions with complex energies, E = E0 + i,
where E0 is the energy of the resonance and  is its decay width. Rather than
solving the Schrodinger equation in this way, a variety of approximate methods
may be successfully used. Three of these approximate approaches, which treat the
proton as occupying a quasistationary state in a spherically symmetric potential
are compared below.
Theory 37
2.4.1 Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA)
The distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) provides a rigorous method
of calculating the decay width of a proton emitting state if the initial and final
wave functions of the proton and core are known. The DWBA considers the
emitted proton as undergoing a low-amplitude interaction between a quasibound
and unbound channel, with both channels subject to a common potential. The
transition amplitude has to be sufficiently small, so transitions with larger decay
widths may not be well modelled by the approximation [53].
The parent nucleus wave function,A+1, is taken to be the product of the indi-
vidual wave functions of the quasibound proton and nuclear core, while Ap is a
product of the daughter nucleus, similarly treated as the inert core of the parent
nucleus, and the intrinsic wave function of the emitted proton [1, 2].
The radial wave function of the quasibound proton is found by numerically inte-
grating the Schrodinger equation with the one body potential. The quasibound
wave function should have a form such that the interior wave function is smoothly
joined to the irregular part of the Coulomb function, G(r), which describes the
proton wave function as r  . The depth of the nuclear potential and strength
of the spin-orbit interaction can then be altered so that the the quasibound wave
function follows this condition.
Using the forms of wave function described the decay width of the proton reso-
nance is
Fl(r)(VN + V
C)nljdr
2 , (2.20)
where VN is the nuclear potential, V
C is a factor that accounts for the Coulomb
interaction from the finite charge distribution of the nucleus,  is the reduced
mass of the core and proton and nlj is the wave function of the outgoing proton.
2.4.2 Two Potential Approach (TPA)
The Two Potential Approach considers the proton as initially occupying a bound
state within a potential U(r). A distorting potential, W (r), is then introduced at
Theory 38
Figure 2.6: Figure taken from Ref. [7] showing the different forms of potential
used in the two potential approach: (a) the total potential, V (r), with the
proton occupying a state with energy E, (b) the stable part of the potential,
U(r) with a stationary state of energy E0, (c) the deforming potential, W (r),
introduced at time t = 0 and (d) the form of W (r) which tends to zero as
r  . The labels r1 and r2 denote the classical turning points of the potential
and rb indicates the radius at which the potential barrier is at a maximum
[1, 2, 7].
t = 0, at which point the proton occupies a quasistable state within the potential,
V (r) = U(r) +W (r), and eventually decays to the continuum. The forms of the
potentials U(r), V (r) and W (r) are shown in Fig. 2.6 [7].
The barrier consists of both Coulomb and centrifugal parts so the barrier height
is dependent on the single-particle angular momentum [1, 2]. The potential U(r)
commonly takes the form of a simple harmonic potential [7].
The particle will initially occupy the bound eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, H0
with potential U(r), therefore,
Theory 39
H00 =
+ U(r)
0 = E00, (2.21)
where 0 is the initial wave function of the proton contained within the potential
U(r) with energy E0. Once the perturbing potential W (r) is introduced the
particle then occupies a resonant state of energy E which is an eigenstate of the
full Hamiltonian H =
+V (r). As can be seen from Fig. 2.6, the potentialW (r)
does not disappear at large values of r, instead tending to VB. The potential is
then slightly altered to the form W (r) = W (r)+VB, which is substituted into the
Hamiltonian to provide the more realistic behaviour desired. The Fermi Golden
Rule [26] can be used to extract the decay width of the quasistable state, which
is found to be
nlj(r)W (r)l(r)dr
2 , (2.22)
where  is the reduced mass of the nucleus and proton, k =
2E/~, nlj is the
radial component of the wave function 0 and l(r) is the radial wave function
of the Hamiltonian with the perturbing potential W (r) added. The integral in
equation 2.22 can be solved analytically to give a final expression for the decay
width of the quasistationary state of
nlj(rb) [l(rb) + l(rb)]2 , (2.23)
where  =
2(VB  E)/~ and rb is the barrier radius shown in Fig. 2.6.
2.4.3 Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) Approximation
The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to proton emission is a
quasi-classical approach that considers a proton tunneling through a potential
barrier. The WKB approach uses two different wave functions, a propagating
form before the potential barrier and a decaying form after the barrier, which are
given in terms of plane waves,   eikr. The WKB terms for the decay energy
and decay width of the proton decay can be calculated using the quasiclassical
Theory 40
limit of the two-potential approach [1, 2, 27]. The decay energy, , and decay
width, , are given as
|k(r)|dr
(2.24)
 = N
|k(r)|dr
, (2.25)
where,
k(r) =
[E  V (r)], (2.26)
r1 and r2 are the classical turning points of the potential barrier as shown in
Fig. 2.2 and V
(rb) = dV (r)|rrb+0 where rb is the distance from the centre
of the nucleus at which the potential barrier height is at a maximum. N is a
normalisation factor given by
N1 =
( r1
, (2.27)
where the limits r0 and r1 denote the classical region of the potential and the
index
indicates the treatment of the proton as being subject to the perturbing
potential, W (r). This normalisation factor only considers the proton as occupying
the classically allowed region. The simplicity of the WKB method means that it
has been widely used to study proton emitters [54].
2.4.4 Comparison of Spherical Models and the Effects of
the Pairing Interaction
The models described in the last three subsections have all been evaluated using
the same parameters by Aberg et al. [1, 2] to predict the lifetime of various
Theory 41
proton-emitting nuclei. The Qp values of proton emission were taken from ex-
periment and the proton is considered as occupying a single-particle level in the
parent nucleus. The half-lives predicted for various nuclei, using the different
approaches are detailed in Table 2.2 below.

Table 2.2: Proton emission lifetimes predicted for various nuclei as calculated
by Aberg [1, 2] using the DWBA, TPA and WKB approaches with experimen-
tal results also listed for comparison, see text for details.
As can be seen from Table 2.2 the various different approaches all give similar
lifetimes when the same parameters are used for the calculations. Addition-
ally, reasonable order-of-magnitude estimates of experimental values are made
for some odd-even and odd-odd nuclei as well as for nuclei decaying from the
ground state or a low-lying isomeric state. However, some of the experimental
half-lives are found to lie far from the theoretical values. As the models con-
sider the the proton moving in a spherical mean field in a single-particle orbit,
deviation from this behaviour can explain the discrepancies between theory and
experiment.
Although the approach of considering a single particle subject to a mean field
leads to the successful prediction of many nuclear properties, the effects of inter-
actions between individual nucleons may alter the spacing of excitation energies
of the single-particle orbits. The residual interaction causes the mixing of the
wave functions defining individual single-particle orbits so that a nucleon will of-
ten have to be described by an admixture of many single-particle wave functions
[31]. If there are significant components of several single-particle wave functions
then it may be necessary to treat the single particles as quasiparticles, which par-
tially occupy many different single-particle orbits. For proton decay, this mixing
may effect the half-life of proton emission as there are different probabilities that
a single-particle state is occupied or unoccupied in the daughter nucleus after the
decay of the parent [14].
Theory 42
The pairing residual interaction strongly contributes to the mixing of different
states and has to be treated in proton-emission models. The effect of the pairing
interaction is to attempt to situate paired nucleons as close as spatially possible
together while not violating the Pauli exclusion principle [31]. One quality of
the pairing interaction is that pairs of nucleons in orbits near the Fermi surface
can be scattered to higher orbits. There is then a certain probability of valence
nucleons occupying several orbits near the Fermi surface. The gap parameter, ,
describes the occupation probabilities of excited states, i and j, near the Fermi
surface as,
 = G
UiVj, (2.28)
where G is the strength of the pairing interaction, U is the emptiness factor given
(i  )
(i  )2 +2
(2.29)
and V is the fullness factor given by
(i  )
(i  )2 +2
, (2.30)
i are the single-particle energies of states near the Fermi surface and  is the
Fermi energy. The factors V and U give the probability that an orbit i is occupied
or unoccupied, respectively. The levels about the Fermi surface are occupied over
a range of approximately . The level of occupancy of energy levels around the
Fermi surface is shown schematically in Fig. 2.7.
Rather than describing single-particle or hole excitations it then becomes easier
to describe excitations in terms of quasi-particles, which have a probability of
occupying several nuclear states. The energy of a quasi-particle, Ei, is given in
terms of the single-particle energies and range of occupied levels as,
Theory 43

energy levels about the Fermi surface, denoted by the fullness factor V 2i , due
to pairing [31]. The Fermi surface energy is denoted by .
(i  )2 +2. (2.31)
Spectroscopic factors can be introduced to account for the pairing interaction in
the spherical proton-emission models discussed in this section. The theoretical
spectroscopic factor,
Sthp = u
j , (2.32)
can be introduced from a single quasiparticle approach [60, 61], where u2j is the
probability that the spherical orbit occupied by the proton in the parent nucleus
will be unoccupied in the daughter nucleus. The value of u2j should, thus, lie
between 0 and 1. The experimental spectroscopic factor can also be calculated
from,
Sexpp = T
1/2/T
, (2.33)
Theory 44
where, T th1/2 and T
are the theoretical and experimental half-lives, respectively.
If the experimental and theoretical spectroscopic factors agree then the fragmen-
tation of the single-particle strength can be said to cause the observed differences
in the proton-emission half-life seen for some nuclei in Table 2.2. This comparison
is shown with theoretical half-lives taken from the DWBA approach in Table 2.3.

Table 2.3: Comparison between experimental and theoretical spectroscopic
factors for the proton-emitters listed in Table 2.2. Experimental spectroscopic
factors were calculated using half-lives taken from Refs. [12, 5559] and theo-
retical half-lives calculated using the DWBA method in Refs. [1, 2]. Theoret-
ical spectroscopic factors are also taken from Refs. [1, 2]. The inconsistency
between theory and experiment for the top three results indicates that the
DWBA assumption of a spherically symmetric nucleus is not valid.
Table 2.3 shows that only some of the nuclei have consistent experimental and
theoretical spectroscopic factors. These nuclei will have lifetimes accurately pre-
dicted by the spherical models when the spectroscopic factor takes into account
the non-single-particle properties of the proton decay. However, there are some
nuclei with inconsistent theoretical and experimental spectroscopic factors, no-
tably 113Cs. In these cases the single-particle strength is very strongly fragmented
and the tunneling probability is strongly enhanced compared to the spherical po-
tential used in the three approaches detailed in the previous subsections [1, 2].
This is indicative of the parent nucleus deviating from a spherical shape. There-
fore, a new theoretical approach encompassing proton emission from a deformed
potential is needed to make accurate predictions on the properties of deformed
nuclei. Before addressing the models which consider proton emission from a de-
formed nucleus, the characteristics of deformed nuclei will be described as well
as the Nilsson model, which provides a single-particle model for deformed nuclei.
Theory 45
2.5 Nuclear Deformation
Nuclei with numbers of protons and neutrons which are significantly different to
the magic numbers, will deviate from a spherical shape and have less binding
energy per nucleon. This is due to the increased residual interaction between the
large number of valence nucleons lying outside of a closed shell. The change in
nuclear shape can be represented as a perturbation to the spherical nuclear shape
expressed as the series of spherical harmonics, given by equation 2.34:
R(, ) = Rav
,Y,(, )
, (2.34)
where  describes the mode of the resonance,  describes the contribution of
each mode to the total shape, Rav is the average nuclear radius and Y,(, )
are the series of spherical harmonics [26]. The dominant mode of deformation
is the quadrupole ( = 2) mode with a smaller contribution from the octupole
deformation mode, ( = 3), in some cases (Ref [62] predicts that for 113Cs, the
quadrupole deformation mode has more than twice the magnitude of the octupole
deformation mode) [63, 64]. For a predominantly quadrupole deformation, the
number of  terms is reduced. The terms 2,1 = 2,1 = 0, as these terms do
not conserve spatial symmetry and due to axial symmetry 2,2 = 2,2. The
applicable  coefficients are then reduced to 2,0 and 2,2. These can be simply
expressed in terms of the quadrupole deformation, , and the deviation from
axial symmetry, , as,
2,0 = 2 cos() (2.35)
2,2 =
2 sin(). (2.36)
The  and  parameters form the basis of the Lund convention of measuring
shape changes due to quadrupole deformation [31]. Figure 2.8 shows the shapes
associated with the changing of these two parameters.
Theory 46
Figure 2.8: The quadrupole deformation from a spherical shape described
by the Lund convention, as taken from Ref. [33].  is the magnitude of
quadrupole deformation and  is the deviation from axial symmetry. The
different alignments of the rotational and symmetry axis are shown for their
associated values of  as well as the changes between prolate and oblate shapes.
The parameters  and  may also sometimes be used to describe axially symmetric
nuclear deformation, where  is given by
Rr.m.s
, (2.37)
where R is the difference between the semi-minor and semi-major axes of the
deformed nucleus and Rr.m.s is the root mean square radius of the nucleus [65].
The parameter  is given in terms of an expansion of  as,
Theory 47
2 =  +
3... (2.38)
and is, in turn, related to the 2 parameter by
22 +
32...
. (2.39)
The ordering of single-particle levels will be changed in deformed nuclei and the
projection of single-particle angular momentum on the symmetry axis of the
axially deformed core becomes a good quantum number. These changes have to
be accounted for by a deformed model of the nucleus. The Nilsson model provides
this framework.
2.5.1 The Nilsson Model
The Nilsson model describes the movement of nucleons in a deformed potential
and accounts for the variation in energy of the single-particle levels of the spherical
shell model with changing nuclear deformation. A nucleon that occupies a single
orbit in a deformed nucleus will have a lower energy if the orbit lies closer to
the nuclear core. As such, the orientation of a single j orbit will have an effect
on its energy, in a way that is not significant when considering spherical nuclei.
Therefore, the degeneracy of a j orbital is affected by the deformation of the
nucleus [61]. Orbits within the Nilsson model are described by the quantum
number , which is the projection of a single j orbit onto the symmetry axis of the
nucleus. For the case of there being more than one particle orbiting the nuclear
core there will be a total projection of angular momentum onto the symmetry axis
of K, where K =
i. A classical approximation of the angle of the different
K-projections may be given by
 = sin1(K/j). (2.40)
Theory 48
Figure 2.9: Schematic diagram showing the increased separation of Nilsson
single-particle energies with increased projection of the angular momentum of
the g7/2 orbital on the symmetry axis.
This indicates that the energy difference between orbits separated by the same
increment of K is greater for high K orbits than for low K orbits, as is shown
schematically in Fig. 2.9.
The change in single-particle excitation energy versus quadrupole deformation
parameter, 2, is shown graphically in the Nilsson diagram in Fig. 2.10. This
shows the Nilsson levels calculated using a deformed simple harmonic potential
for protons between 50  Z  82. This is the area of the proton Nilsson diagram
corresponding to the proton number of 113Cs, the nucleus examined in this work.
A deformed Woods-Saxon potential may also be used to calculate the spacing of
the single-particle levels, as was the case for the theoretical model described in
Section 2.6.3 [16].
In Fig. 2.10, it can be seen that at 2=0 the K-splitting of the spherical orbits
occurs and the individual K orbits diverge from each other. The diagram shows
how orbits will not cross other orbits with the same K value and parity. The
diagram also shows how the deflection and divergence of the orbits at larger
deformations leads to individual K orbits lying close in energy to each other,
which enhances the configuration mixing of the two states. States will mix more
Theory 49
strongly if they have similar K values. Additionally, the interaction that causes
configuration mixing in the Nilsson model is of quadrupole form so mixing tends
to occur strongly between configurations which differ by two units of angular
momentum [31].
The intruder orbitals, which are orbitals lowered by the spin-orbit interaction
into a different major shell will have a different parity to the natural-parity states
already present in this major shell. Due to having different parities the natural-
parity and intruder K orbits cannot mix so intruder orbitals tend to have pure
configurations as they are removed from orbitals with the same parity. By a
similar token, high-K states tend to be pure at small deformations as they are
rarer in major shells than the low-K states which may emerge from a greater
number of orbitals. The high-K states will then not mix strongly with the states
that differ by a large value of K.
Nilsson orbits are typically described in the following form,
K[N,nz,], (2.41)
where N is the principle quantum number of the major shell, nz is the number of
nodes of the orbit in the z direction and  is the projection of the orbital angular
momentum onto the symmetry axis z. By definition K =  +  where  is the
projection of the intrinsic spin of the nucleon onto the symmetry axis.
The Nilsson model provides a framework for single-particle motion in a deformed
potential. However, collective modes of excitation will also arise due to the motion
of many nucleons in a deformed potential. To describe the angular momentum of
a nucleus it then becomes necessary to consider these collective excitations as well
as the single-particle angular momentum. Nuclei can undergo both collective vi-
brations and rotations. The nucleus 113Cs which is studied in this work undergoes
nuclear rotation and this excitation mode is examined in the next section.
2.5.2 Nuclear Rotation
Excited nuclei with spherically asymmetric charge and mass distributions may
rotate. These rotations stem from collective, rather than individual, nucleon

excitations [26, 31]. The angular momentum of the individual and collective ex-
citations of the nucleus can be treated as separate excitations stemming from the
rotating nuclear core and the individual nucleons. The total angular momentum
of a rotational nucleus is then given by
I = R + J, (2.42)
where I is the total angular momentum of the nucleus, R is the contribution of
the rotation of the core and J is the angular momentum of valence nucleons. In
this approach the presence of the valence nucleons does not have any effect on the
behaviour of nucleons in the core and vice versa. This is due to the fact that the
motion of the valence nucleons and core take place on significantly different time-
scales [31]. The core is then described as a rigid rotor, as it will retain its shape
and rotational frequency regardless of the excitation of the valence nucleons. This
may be referred to as an adiabatic system. A schematic diagram of a rotating
deformed nucleus and the different angular momenta describing its behaviour are
shown in Fig. 2.11
The energy of rotational excited states in a nucleus is proportional to the angular
momentum of the rotating core. The excitation due to the rotation of the core,
Theory 52
Erot can be, in the first instance, described classically by
Erot =
J 2, (2.43)
where J is the moment of inertia of the core and  is its angular frequency. This
can also be written semi-classically as,
Erot = ~2
I(I + 1)
, (2.44)
which shows that an increase of angular momentum will result in a smooth in-
crease of the energy of the nucleus. This results in rotational band structures,
which have excited states with regular energy spacings and spin differences of 2~.
The lifetimes of the states in rotational bands can provide information on the
deformation of the nucleus.
2.5.3 Estimating Nuclear Deformation from -ray Tran-
sition Rates
If a nucleus is deformed then it will have a non-zero electric quadrupole moment.
The intrinsic quadrupole moment, Q0, is proportional to the reduced transition
probabilities of E2 transitions seen in rotational band structures. The quadrupole
moment of the state can then be related to the quadrupole deformation, 2, of
the nucleus by [31]
ZR22
, (2.45)
where R is the radius of the spherical nucleus of the same volume as the deformed
nucleus and Z is the atomic number of the nucleus. As such, the deformation
of a nucleus can be estimated from the measured B(E2) values. The reduced
transition probability of a stretched E2 transition is given by
Theory 53
B(E2) =
e2Q20 |JiK20|JfK|
, (2.46)
where |JiK20|JfK|
is a Clebsch-Gordon for a transition between states with
spins I and I  2 [66].
Proton-emission rates may also provide a measure of nuclear deformation, when
deformation is included in the theoretical framework. Models, which describe
proton emission from a deformed potential are described in the following sections.
2.6 Deformed Models of Proton Emission
Introducing deformation into proton-emission models can remove some of the
discrepancies seen between theory and experiment in spherical models, as seen
in Subsection 2.4.4. The deformation can be taken into account by evaluating
the exact decay width of the proton-emitting state for a deformed potential in a
manner similar to that described for spherical models in Section 2.4 [14]. Two
different approaches that provide an exact expression for the decay width are de-
scribed in this section [14, 16]. The first considers an adiabatic approach where
the proton is considered to occupy a single-particle orbit within a deformed po-
tential and is coupled to a rigid nuclear core, with infinite moment of inertia [14].
The second considers a nonadiabatic approach where the core may be less rigid
and the pairing interaction and Coriolis interaction (subsequently described in
Subsection 2.6.2) may have a significant effect on the ordering of nuclear states
and the proton-emission half-life [16].
2.6.1 Deformed Adiabatic Single-Particle Approach
The adiabatic approach of Maglione et al. [14] evaluates the decay width of a
single nucleon from a single-particle level in a deformed potential. In this case
the single proton is coupled to the nuclear core which is treated as a rigid rotor
with infinite moment of inertia.
Theory 54
One of the main differences between calculating decay widths in spherical and
deformed nuclei is that partial decay widths have to be inferred for different an-
gular momentum projected states [14]. This is due to the fact that the projected
angular momentum, K, becomes a good quantum number in these nuclei and can
be used to describe distinct excited states. Excitations of the nucleus stemming
from collective motion also have to be accounted for. Assuming an odd-even
nucleus with a single unpaired proton, the angular momentum projected wave
function of the parent is given by
JiMi,Kim =
)1/2 {
DJiMiKiKi + (1)
Ji+KiDJiMiKiKi
, (2.47)
where, Ji = 2Ji + 1, D are the rotation matrices and  is the intrinsic single-
particle wave function, which can be expanded in spherical components to
Ki(r) =
lj(r)
Yl(r)1/2
, (2.48)
where, Yl, are spherical harmonics, 1/2 the spin functions and lj describes the
contribution of different l and j orbits to the single-particle wave function.
The wave function of the exit channel will be the product of the daughter wave
function and the wave function of the protons movement relative to the daughter
nucleus. The daughter nucleus wave function is
JdMdKd
DJdMdKd . (2.49)
For the case of the daughter nucleus being left in its ground state by the proton
emission, as is most likely, the relation Jd = Md = Kd = 0 can be assumed.
Angular momentum conservation then implies that the outgoing proton has an-
gular momentum jp = Ji = Ki. A spectroscopic factor of 1/(jp + 1/2) has to
be included to guarantee that the angular momentum of the daughter nucleus is
zero.
Theory 55
At large values of r, where the nuclear potential vanishes and the Coulomb po-
tential is nearly spherically symmetric, the outgoing proton wave function will
adopt a form, similar to that seen in equation 2.18, of
RoutKi (R) =
Nlj[Glj(R) + iFlj(R)][Yl(R)1/2]jKi . (2.50)
Here Nlj are normalisation constants, which are found by matching the outgoing
wave function to the internal wave function given in equation 2.48. The probabil-
ity rate of decay to channel lj is Tlj =
, where v is the velocity of the proton
in the potential.
Using these definitions of the parent, daughter and proton wave functions, the
partial decay width corresponding to the decay of the proton channel is found to
lpjp(R) =
R22lpjp(R)
F 2lpjp(R) +G
. (2.51)
This expression assumes that the deformation of the parent and daughter nuclei
remains the same [14].
This model has been used to test the decay width of 113Cs [14] in order to try
and replicate the experimental half-life in a way which was not possible for the
spherical models discussed in Section 2.4 [1, 2, 7]. Three single-particle excitations
are predicted to lie near the Fermi surface for moderate deformations of 113Cs:
the K = 1/2+ orbital from the g7/2 shell and the K = 3/2
+ and K = 5/2+
orbitals from the d5/2 shell. The half-life, T1/2 =
lpjp
, of proton emission from
each of these orbits was calculated using the deformed adiabatic single-particle
method and the results are shown in Fig. 2.12.
As the adiabatic approach does not include the effect of the pairing interaction
a spectroscopic factor must be applied to the theoretical values in order to com-
pare with the experimental lifetime. When a spectroscopic factor of u2  0.5 is
included in the calculation, doubling the theoretical values, Fig. 2.12 shows that
there is no orbit for which the experimental half-life, denoted by the dashed lines,
is replicated at zero deformation. When the same spectroscopic factor is included
in the calculation, the 5/2+ state can be discounted as the ground state as at
Theory 56
Figure 2.12: Figure taken from Ref. [14] showing theoretical lifetimes of
proton emission from 113Cs calculated from equation 2.51 versus deformation.
The lifetime of the decay has been predicted for proton decays from the K =
3/2+, 5/2+ states from the d5/2 orbital and the K = 1/2
+ state from the g7/2
orbital. The theoretical values are compared to the experimental lifetime value
of 16.7(7) s from Ref. [11], the limits of which are denoted by the dashed
lines. The effects of the pairing interaction are not included in the model and
a spectroscopic factor of u2j=0.5, which doubles the theoretical values, must be
included to compare with the experimental lifetime.

[14]. The solid line corresponds to the j = K component, the dash-dotted
line to the j = K + 1 orbit, the dashed line to the j = K + 2 orbit and the
dotted line to the j = K + 3 orbit. The vertical red line marks  = 0.08 to
indicate the deformation at which the sharp increase in half-life is seen for the

which the wave functions have greater amplitudes than zero.
the deformation of 2  0.22  0.27, the state lies too far away from the Fermi
surface [14]. This indicates that either the 3/2+ or 1/2+ state is the ground state
of 113Cs.
The sharp increase in half-life for the K1/2 state at  = 0.08, seen in Fig. 2.12 is
due to the change in the amplitudes of the different components of the K = 1/2+
state at that deformation. This is shown graphically in Fig. 2.13.
The sign of the amplitude of the s1/2 orbital is seen to change at the value
of the lifetime increase at  = 0.08. Additionally, the g7/2 component is also
Theory 58
seen to decrease at this deformation. As the square of the half-life is inversely
proportional to the square of the wave function, the half-life increases sharply
at this point. Due to the sharp increase in the half-life of the decay of the
parent to the ground state of the daughter, decay to the first excited state of the
daughter may also emerge as an alternative decay path. In order to investigate
this further, information on the angular momenta of the daughter and mother
nuclei would be needed [14]. As small components of the wave function of the
proton-emitting state may have significant effects on its lifetime, it is important
to properly consider the mixing that may introduce these small components.
The adiabatic approach considers the proton as having a strong coupling to the
nuclear core, so that there is no perturbation to the orbit of the single proton
due to the Coriolis interaction. However, in nuclei such as 113Cs, the Coriolis
interaction is predicted to have a strong effect on the spacing of the different
excited states and the mixing of different state wave functions [16]. As such
it is important to develop a model that includes these effects. The mechanism
behind the Coriolis interaction is covered in the next section, before a model
which includes the interaction is introduced.
2.6.2 The Coriolis Interaction
The single-particle Nilsson wave function does not possess a fixed angular mo-
mentum J , but can be projected onto states of many different angular momenta.
Therefore, a given Nilsson orbital can be projected onto many different core ex-
citations to form a rotational band. For the case of an odd-even nucleus, the
total angular momentum corresponds to the vector sum of the core rotation and
odd-particle angular momentum. The Coriolis interaction arises as a result of
this coupling of the intrinsic and rotational motions and can be derived from the
rotational Hamiltonian,
(I  j)2 =
(I2 + j2  2I  j), (2.52)
where I is the moment of inertia of the nucleus, I is the total angular momentum
of the nucleus, R is the angular momentum of the nuclear core and j is the
single-particle angular momentum as shown in Fig. 2.11. Using the raising and
Theory 59
lowering operators, I = I1  ij2 and I = I2  ij1 and replacing the operators
by eigenvalues where possible gives
E(J) =
[I(I + 1) 2K2 +
 (I+j + Ij+)], (2.53)
where
VCoriolis =
(I+j + Ij+). (2.54)
This Coriolis interaction term describes an effect similar to the classical Coriolis
effect, which applies to an object travelling with a velocity v on a body rotating
with angular velocity . When viewed from the rotational frame, the object will
appear to be subject to a force, deflecting it from its original path. For the case
of nuclei, the Coriolis interaction will alter the projection of the single-particle
angular momentum on the symmetry axis, admixing different K values. Due to
the properties of the raising and lowering operators, Coriolis mixing only acts
between states where K differs by 1. The Coriolis mixing can have significant
effects on the level structure of rotational nuclei. Low K levels from high j
spherical orbits have been observed in some rare earth nuclei to have energies
shifted by several hundred keV from unmixed energies [31].
For rotational bands based on a K = 1/2 orbit, the energies of the states forming
the band including the Coriolis term is given by
Erot(I) =
I(I + 1) + K1/2a(1)I+1/2(I +
, (2.55)
where a is the decoupling parameter given by
(1)j1/2(j +
)C2j (2.56)
and Cj denotes the Nilsson wave function describing a particular orbit [31].
The decoupling parameter provides a measure of how easy it is to decouple

of K = 1/2, 5/2, 9/2.. states will be exactly the same as those for 0+, 2+, 4+, ...
states of the even-even core. In this case the total angular momentum vector
is aligned with the rotation axis and the Coriolis force will not have a strong
effect on the projection of the single-particle orbit. This forms the basis of the
adiabatic strong-coupling limit where the coupling of the single-particle and ro-
tational motion is strong enough that the perturbation from the Coriolis effect
is not significant. However, for nuclei with K states which differ by one unit of
angular momentum and lie close in energy, the Coriolis mixing may be strong
and needs to be considered. 113Cs is such a nucleus.
2.6.3 Deformed Nonadiabatic Quasiparticle Approach
The deformed nonadiabatic quasiparticle approach was developed to include the
effect of the Coriolis interaction on proton-emitting nuclei and to account for
non-rigidity of the nuclear core [16]. Proton-emitting states in deformed nuclei
may be treated as admixtures of various different K states [14, 15]. As the
decay width of the proton emitting state is sensitive to small components of the
wave function, it becomes important to properly consider the Coriolis mixing in
nuclei where the Coriolis interaction is strong [16]. This is especially important
for nuclei where two Nilsson orbits with angular momenta differing by one unit
lie very close in energy. These are known as pseudo-spin doublets and may be
candidate proton-emitting states, if lying close to the Fermi energy, as is the case
for the K = 1/2+ and K = 3/2+ orbits in 113Cs [67].
Early attempts at including the Coriolis interaction lost the good agreement with
experimental data seen in the adiabatic approach [6870]. The fact that the resid-
ual pairing interaction was not included was postulated to be the cause for these
discrepancies, as it also affects the mixing between states [16]. A nonadiabatic
approach, treating nucleons as quasiparticles rather than particles was then re-
quired to properly account for both the pairing residual interaction and Coriolis
interaction.
In a similar manner to the adiabatic approach for a nucleus with an even core and
odd proton, the total Hamiltonian of the system can be separated into intrinsic
and collective parts, H = Hin+Hcol. In this case Hin, the intrinsic part, includes
a deformed spin-orbit term as well as the residual interaction. The collective
Theory 61
Hamiltonian for a core with axial symmetry takes a similar form to that described
in Section 2.6.2 of,
Hcol =
R2 =
[I2 + j2  2I3j3  (I+j + Ij+)], (2.57)
where R is the angular momentum of the core, I is the moment of inertia of the
core, I is the total angular momentum of the nucleus and j the single-particle
angular momentum. Using the intrinsic frame, the wave function of the parent
nucleus, can be expressed in terms of a superposition of the Nilsson single-particle
and core wave functions using a basis of states, |IKM > as,
IM =

(2.58)
where D IMK are the rotational matrices and a
K are the coefficients governing the
superposition of the single-particle and core wave functions. The single-particle
Nilsson functions YK are given by
Klj (r)
[Yl  S]Kj , (2.59)
where Y and S are the angular momentum and spin tensors, respectively and
Klj (r) is the radial wave function of the proton moving with respect to the core.
The Coriolis mixing between states differing by one unit of K can be taken into
account from a diagonalisation in the same |IKM > basis, giving,
IK + 1M |Hcr|IKM =
[(I K)(I +K + 1)(j K)(j +K + 1)]1/2

(2.60)
Theory 62
The effect of the residual pairing interaction can be introduced by using the
Bogoliubov transformation [71] to change from single-particle Nilsson energies,
K , to quasiparticle energies K = [
2+(K )2]1/2 where  is the Fermi energy
and  is the pairing gap. After this transformation the Coriolis contribution has
to be multiplied by a factor of
fuv = (uK+1uK + vK+1vK), (2.61)
where u2 and v2 are emptiness and fullness factors describing the probability of a
single-particle state being occupied or unoccupied, respectively. The decay width
of a proton-emitting state can then be calculated from the probability that the
wave function of the form shown in equation 2.58 will decay to the exit channel
wave function given by the tensor product of the internal wave function of the
daughter nucleus RMR and the function describing the protons motion relative
to the daughter, IljR. The expression for the decay width of a proton escaping
with angular momentum lpjp is then,
RlpJp(r) =
2(2R + 1)
2I + 1

(2.62)
giving a more generalised form of the adiabatic formula shown in equation 2.51.
Here |ufk |
2 gives the probability of single-particle proton level being unoccupied
in the daughter nucleus.
By using experimental excitation energies of states in the daughter nucleus, its
internal wave function can be better defined and the proton decay width can be
more accurately evaluated. Using the level scheme of the daughter also accounts
for any structures in the daughter nucleus that are not caused by rigid rotation.
The nonadiabatic quasiparticle model removes the disagreement with the strong-
coupling limit introduced in the earlier nonadiabatic approaches. For example,
the proton decay of the nucleus 141Ho, with an experimental lifetime of T1/2 =
4.1(1) ms [72], was predicted to have a lifetime of T1/2 = 12.5 ms in the method of
Theory 63
Ref. [69], which did not consider the effect of the pairing interaction. By contrast,
a more accurate lifetime of T1/2 = 2.6 ms was predicted by the adiabatic model
and the same value was replicated by the nonadiabatic model. The results of
this model, when used to calculate energies of excited states and the half-life of
proton emission from 113Cs, are discussed later in this work.
The correct deformation of the proton-emitting nucleus can be found by changing
the level of deformation present in the potential and finding the intersection of the
theoretical and experimental half-lives. Similarly, by using the wave functions ex-
tracted from the nonadiabatic model to calculate -ray transition rates between
excited states of the proton-emitting nucleus, using the approach described in
Subsection 2.5.3 [66], the deformation of the nucleus may again be found. There-
fore a consistent approach using the same wave functions from the nonadiabatic
quasiparticle model can be undertaken to provide the deformation of the nucleus
from comparison with both experimental proton-emission and -ray transition
rates, in order to test the predictive power of the model.
Chapter 3
Experimental Equipment and
Techniques
This chapter provides an overview of the experimental setup used to obtain the
data presented in this work. Data were collected at the Accelerator Laboratory of
the University of Jyvaskyla using the JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT nuclear spec-
troscopy apparatus, shown in Fig. 3.1. This setup was originally designed for
the identification and analysis of heavy nuclei far from stability [1820], but has
also been widely and successfully used for measurements of nuclei in the mass
A110 region [12, 39, 73, 74]. This chapter describes the constituent arrays of
the experimental setup as well as the processing of detector signals for analysis.
3.1 The K-130 Cyclotron
The K-130 Cyclotron was installed at the University of Jyvaskyla in 1993 and
provides heavy-ion beams to the JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT experimental setup
[76]. Cyclotrons, such as the K-130, make use of the fact that a charged particle
travelling in a circular orbit in a uniform magnetic field has a constant orbital
period. The radius of the orbit increases as the particle is accelerated, while the

nuclei from the target position will then be transported through RITU, to sepa-

focal plane array.
frequency of the orbit remains the same. As such, a sinusoidal oscillating voltage,
with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency of the particles in the cyclotron,
can be applied to the accelerating cavities, or dees [77], within the cyclotron. This
has the effect of accelerating the charged particles twice within one orbit. The
charged particles then take a spiral path of increasing radius as they are further
accelerated by the oscillating voltage until they reach the edge of the cyclotron
and are ejected as a beam.
Electron-Cyclotron Resonance Ion Sources (ECRIS) are used with the K-130
cyclotron to generate heavy-ion beams in the required charge state. This type of
source consists of a plasma, which is contained in a magnetic bottle structure,
through which injected ions pass. The electrons in the plasma are resonantly
accelerated by a signal applied by a radio-frequency (RF) unit, with frequency
RF , which is equal to the electron-cyclotron resonance frequency, ECR, of the
form given in equation 3.1
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 67
ECR =
, (3.1)
where q is the charge on the ions in the plasma, B is the magnetic field experienced
by these ions and m is the mass of the ion [78]. The resonantly excited electrons
then strip atomic electrons from the injected ions, which are extracted from the
ion source and are accelerated by the dees [79]. The constant application of the
resonant frequency to the electrons in the plasma enables electrons to undergo
multiple collisions with the transiting injected ions and also reduces the chance
of recombination or electron capture.
The maximum energy per nucleon of accelerated ions is determined by both the
bending limit and focussing limit of the cyclotron [78]. The bending limit, Kb,
depends on the magnetic rigidity of the accelerated ions such that,
e22B20R
( + 1)mu
, (3.2)
where  is the Lorentz factor, e is the electronic charge, mu is the atomic mass
unit and B0R0 is the magnetic rigidity of a particle with charge number Z and
mass number A [80]. The focussing limit, Kf , depends on the saturation density
of the vertical focussing magnets. This limiting factor is given as
. (3.3)
The K-130 cyclotron has a bending limit of 130 MeV and a focussing limit of 90
keV/u allowing the production of heavy ion beams with energies of 5-10 MeV/u.
These beam energies are high enough to allow fusion-evaporation reactions to
take place at the target position, such as that used to gather the experimental
data described in this work.
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 68
3.2 Fusion-Evaporation Reactions
Fusion-evaporation reactions utilise a high energy ion beam which is accelerated
onto a target foil. This process will form a compound nucleus if the incident ion
has enough kinetic energy to overcome the Coulomb repulsion between the two
nuclei. Fusion evaporation dominates at energies that are just enough to overcome
the Coulomb barrier, while spallation will dominate at higher energies. The
incident energy of the beam will be shared between the nucleons of the compound
system. While the average energy is not great enough to result in a nucleon
being emitted from the compound system, due to the statistical distribution
of the energies among the different nucleons there is a small probability of an
individual nucleon being evaporated. The remaining nuclear core will then be
left in a highly excited state, in which it rotates rapidly. Thermal equilibrium
of the nucleus is achieved as a result of these nucleons being emitted or high
energy -ray decays, with the process taking a time of the order of  1022 s [81].
The excited nucleus will then undergo statistical -ray decay before de-exciting
through the yrast levels to its ground state. This process is shown in Fig. 3.2.
From conservation of energy, the excitation energy of the compound nucleus, Eex,
is given by the expression:
Eex = Ecm +Q, (3.4)
where Q is the energy required for the compound nucleus to form and Ecm is the
kinetic energy passed to the compound nucleus from the reaction. The value of
Ecm depends on the centre of mass of the reaction between the beam and target
nuclei and can be calculated from the difference between the energy of the beam,
EB and energy of the recoiling compound nuclei, ER, such that,
Ecm = EB  ER. (3.5)
The kinetic energy transferred to the compound nucleus can then be more simply
calculated from the mass of the beam and target and the energy of the beam, as
Ecm = EB 
(MT +MB)v
r , (3.6)
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 69

formation and de-excitation of a compound nucleus through a fusion evapora-
tion reaction.

whereMB andMT are the masses of the beam and target nuclei, respectively. As,
the kinetic energy of the beam, EB =
B the velocity term can be removed
from equation 3.6 which can then be rearranged to
Ecm = EB(1
MT +MB
). (3.7)
The angular momentum of the compound nucleus again depends on the centre of
mass of the beam and target nuclei involved in the fusion-evaporation reaction.
The maximum angular momentum transfer to the compound nucleus occurs when
the beam and target nucleus just touch during the reaction, as if the beam and
target nuclei were hard spheres. This is known as the sharp-cutoff approximation.
Using this classical approximation the maximum angular momentum transfer,
lmax, can be described as
~lmax = vR, (3.8)
where  is the reduced mass of the compound system given by
AT + AB
(3.9)
and AT and AB are the mass numbers of the target and beam nuclei, respectively.
The value v is the velocity of the compound nucleus, which can be related to the
kinetic energy of the compound nucleus through the difference between the energy
transferred to the nucleus in the reaction and the Coulomb barrier of the target
nucleus, Vc, by
v2 = Ecm  Vc. (3.10)
R is the sharp cut-off radius and is given empirically by
R = 1.36(A
T + A
B) + 0.5. (3.11)
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 71
By substituting the value of v in equation 3.8 using equation 3.10, an expression
for lmax can be obtained:
l2max =
(Ecm  Vc). (3.12)
Equation 3.12 shows how the maximum angular momentum transfer for a certain
centre of mass energy depends strongly on the reduced mass of the compound
system. From equation 3.9 this further shows that reactions with symmetric
beam and target nuclei masses will result in higher angular momentum transfer
[81].
As the recoiling compound nuclei will promptly de-excite by means of -ray
emission, a means of detecting  rays at the target position of the University
of Jyvaskyla setup is needed to measure these decays. This is provided by the
JUROGAM-II array.
3.3 JUROGAM-II
JUROGAM-II is a high-purity germanium detector array arranged in a 4 config-
uration [18] with a total detection efficiency of 6% at 1.3 MeV [12]. The array
is located at the target position of the JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT setup at the
accelerator laboratory of the University of Jyvaskyla, as shown in Fig. 3.3. In the
experiment described in this work JUROGAM-II is used to detect  rays emit-
ted by recoiling nuclei at the target position before they enter into the gas-filled
separator RITU. The 39 constituent detectors of the array are arranged into four
rings, which have discrete angles to the beam axis of 157.6, 133.6, 104.5 and
75.5. There are two separate types of germanium detector: 15 Euroball phase 1
detectors [83] and 24 segmented clover germanium detectors [84]. All detectors
are surrounded by bismuth-germanate (BGO) Compton-suppression shields to
help reduce background from Compton-scattered events. If a signal is detected
in the BGO shield then the coincident scattered  ray detected in the germanium
crystal can be vetoed.
The phase-1 detectors are large, coaxial n-type germanium detectors and are
tapered, being narrower at the front than back. This ensures that the maximum

proportion of the total 4 solid angle of the array is covered by the phase-1
detectors. The clover detectors consist of four individual, coaxial, germanium
diodes contained within a shared cryostat, configured as shown in Fig. 3.4. The
acceptance angle of the individual germanium crystals is smaller than that of
the detector as a whole. This reduces the Doppler broadening of incident -ray
signals, as discussed in subsection 4.4.5. The Doppler broadening effect is greatest
at angles to the beam axis of  = 90, so the clover detectors are used for Rings
3 and 4, which are situated at angles of  = 75.5 and  = 104.5, respectively.
The clover detector setup also allows a detector to have a large active volume by
overcoming some of the difficulty and cost of creating large hyper-pure germanium
crystals. By using the signals from each crystal, software processing can reduce
the Compton background in the -ray spectra produced by each detector. If a 
ray is scattered out of a crystal into an adjacent crystal in the same detector, the
total energy of the original incident -ray can be reconstructed from the energy
sum of coincident events detected separately in the detector crystals. This process
is known as add-back and is described in more detail in Subsection 4.4.3.

3.4 RITU
The Recoil Ion Transportation Unit (RITU) is a gas-filled recoil separator that
transports nuclei of interest from the target position to focal plane of the JUROGAM-
RITU-GREAT setup, while removing scattered beam products [19]. The path
that ions take through RITU is determined by the equation
, (3.13)
where, B is the strength of the magnetic field in the separator,  is the radius
of curvature of the ions path, m and v are the mass and velocity of the ion
respectively, qav is the average charge state of the ions and e is the charge of an
electron [19].
RITU is filled with helium gas, with which recoiling nuclei undergo charge ex-
change reactions. An average charge state of the nuclei will result from the bal-
ance of probabilities between the recoils losing and gaining electrons in collisions
with the gas molecules [85]. The fact that the majority of recoils occupy the av-
erage charge state increases the transmission efficiency of the separator compared
to vacuum mode separators, in which certain charge states are separated before
the focal plane. Although the mass separation of RITU as a gas-filled separator
is far inferior to the vacuum mode resolution of A/A  100 [19], the resolution
is sufficient to separate the majority of scattered and primary beam nuclei from
the fusion-evaporation recoils.
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 74
The value of qav is dependent on both the pressure of helium inside RITU and the
velocity of the ions moving through the separator. The effect of different velocities
and pressures on the average charge state of ions moving through helium are well
known from previous experiments [86]. Using this data the optimum pressure
and magnetic fields can be chosen to ensure the best transmission of fusion-
evaporation recoils and separation of primary and scattered beam products.
The path of ions through RITU is governed by the magnetic fields produced by
three quadrupole (Q) and one dipole (D) magnets, which are arranged in a QDQQ
configuration, as shown in Fig. 3.5. The quadrupole magnets ensure that the
beam remains focussed while passing through RITU. The dipole magnet bends
the path of the ions, with the new direction of the ions dependent on equation
3.13. The scattered beam nuclei, having lower mass, will be deflected more by
the magnetic field, giving them a distinct path to that of the fusion-evaporation
recoils. This allows much of the scattered beam to be directed away from the
focal plane while allowing the transport of the desired nuclei. A movable beam
stopper can also be inserted into RITU after the dipole magnet to further impede
the scattered beam nuclei, as not all of the beam will be deflected away from the
focal plane by the dipole magnet alone. The distance from the target position
to the focal plane is 5.1 m and RITU can be operated with a maximum beam
rigidity of 2.2 Tm [19].
The transmission efficiency through RITU during the commissioning experiment
was  25% for reaction products from the 40Ar+175Lu 210,211Ac + xn reaction
[19]. As the tuning of the beam and magnet fields was not optimised at the com-
missioning stage, this efficiency should be treated as a lower limit. The optimum
pressure of the helium gas in the separator in the commissioning experiment was
found to be 1.5 mbar, while the pressure used in the experiment described in
Chapter 5 was 1.2 mbar.
3.5 GREAT
The GREAT spectrometer is positioned at the focal plane of RITU to detect
recoiling reaction products that have passed through the separator and their sub-
sequent decays. The arrangement of the various detectors that are subsequently

described is shown in Fig. 3.6. Nuclei exiting RITU initially pass through a
multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC). The MWPC is filled with isobutane,
which is ionised by incident recoils, and is separated from the low pressure en-
vironment of RITU by an aluminised mylar window [20]. The MWPC detects
the energy loss of recoils and can be used in tandem with the silicon detectors,
described later, to provide information on the time of flight of recoils between
RITU and the focal plane [87]. These properties can be used to differentiate
recoil events from scattered beam and decay events at the focal plane.
After passing through the MWPC, a nucleus will implant in one of a pair of
double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs). The DSSDs provide information
on the energy of the implanted recoil as well as its implantation position in the
detector. The DSSDs have dimensions of 60  40 mm and are placed side by side
giving a total active area of 4800 mm2. Each detector is split into 60 horizontal
strips of width 1 mm on the back side and 40 vertical strips on the front side.
This gives each detector 2400 separate pixels to provide positional information.
The DSSDs will also provide energy, position and timing information for -, -
or proton decays of the implanted recoils.

from (a) the down-beam face and (b) the side.
Surrounding the DSSDs is a box of silicon pin diodes. Recoils implanting in the
DSSDs will typically implant at depths between 1-10 m [20]. At these depths
there is a significant probability that internal conversion electrons will be able
to escape backwards (relative to the recoil direction) from the DSSDs. The pin
diodes are placed in a box configuration backwards to the DSSDs as shown in
Fig. 3.6. There are 28 separate pins, providing a total geometric efficiency of
30%.
A planar germanium detector is placed 10 mm behind the DSSDs in the same
vacuum chamber. This detector is primarily used for the detection of low-energy
 rays and x-rays, as it has an absolute efficiency of  30% at  100 keV [20].
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 77
Figure 3.7: The simulated absolute efficiencies of the largest GREAT clover
detector and the GREAT planar germanium detector [20].
The detector has an active area of 120  60 mm detector, a depth of 15mm, and
is segmented into 24 horizontal strips on the front side and 12 vertical strips with
widths of 5 mm each. This segmentation allows information on the position of
-ray decays to be extracted.
Three clover detectors are placed around the DSSDs at angles of 90 degrees to
both the beam axis and each other, as shown in Fig. 3.6. These allow the
detection of higher energy  rays with greater efficiency than the planar detector.
The clover detector placed vertically above the focal plane has a larger area
than the two detectors placed at the sides of GREAT and, as such, has a higher
efficiency of  5%. The simulated absolute efficiencies of the planar detector
and the large clover detector are shown in Fig. 3.7, showing the relative detector
performances at different energies.
3.6 Total Data Readout
Recoil-decay tagging (RDT) is a powerful tool for observing specific nuclear de-
cays by correlating detector events resulting from recoiling nuclei and their asso-
ciated decay events [88]. In conventional RDT experiments, data is only recorded
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 78
when specific trigger conditions are met [89]. The trigger in RDT experiments is
typically the implantation of a recoil at the focal plane. Traditionally, in order
to detect subsequent decays of the implanted nucleus, a fixed time period (or
time gate) is started by the trigger, in which the decay events are subsequently
detected. This time gate will typically be based on the half-life of the desired
decays. This conventional setup suffers from the fact that only one event can be
recorded at a time, as once the time gate is open any subsequent recoils arriving
at the focal plane will not be detected. This large dead-time then results in
many events being discarded [88].
The Total Data Readout system overcomes these issues by recording and time-
stamping all detector signals with the use of a 100 MHz global clock. Events are
subsequently constructed in the software [90]. This both reduces the dead-time
of the setup and allows subsequent optimisation and resorting of the data under
different conditions.
Signals from the detectors are initially passed through Constant Fraction Dis-
criminators and shaping amplifiers before being passed into the VXI-D Analogue-
to-Digital (ADC) cards. These cards associate a timestamp with each detector
output. The ADC conversion and readout time is less than that of the shaping
time of the amplifiers. This means that the only losses of detector signals are
from pile-up, which is caused by a second detector signal being generated before
the first signal is processed and recorded. A module known as the metronome
keeps all ADC signals synchronous. The time-stamped data is then passed to the
event-builder, which time-orders all events and constructs the events in line with
applied software gates [91]. A schematic of the TDR electronics is shown in Fig.
3.7 Event Construction
The use of the TDR system allows a wide range of detector outputs to be grouped
together to form the desired detection events. Raw data from all detectors is
formed in to a single stream, which is initially processed by the event builder
and time-ordered. A specific set of detector outputs will be used as a trigger. In
the case of the work presented here the trigger corresponds to the detection of

an event in any of the DSSD strips. An event time-delay and width is defined in
the software. The event width defines a time window, within which any detector
signal will have to occur to be included in the event. This width is optimised such
that the desired decay events at the focal plane are correlated with prompt decays
at the target position, while ensuring that the random correlation rate is kept low
to ensure a good event-to-background ratio. The event delay specifies how much
earlier timestamped events may be than the trigger to still be included within
the event. The delay is usually set so that it corresponds to the time difference
between recoils leaving the target position and arriving at the focal plane. This
reduces the inclusion of background JUROGAM-II events at the target position
resulting from long-lived -decays and other random events. Eliminating as much
JUROGAM-II background as possible also significantly reduces the amount of
data storage required. Figure 3.9 shows typical times at which events at the target
position and focal plane happen relative to each other, as well as an example

trigger width and delay.
3.8 Data Sorting
The grain software package was used to sort the TDR data collected during
the experiment presented in this work [90]. grain allows both online and offline
sorting of data into histograms using time and distance correlations between the
individual time and detector stamped TDR events. These correlations are defined
in a user-created sortcode. A configuration file was used in conjunction with the
sortcode to define the trigger conditions for the histogram event construction.
The package allows the real-time display of the data being sorted. This allowed
Experimental Equipment and Techniques 81
the optimisation of tagging or coincidence conditions included in the sortcode
(described in more detail in Chapter 5) to be changed if necessary based on the
histogram output.
3.9 The Differential Plunger for Unbound States
The differential plunger for unbound nuclear states (DPUNS) was created to per-
form lifetime measurements on the excited states of exotic nuclei in tandem with
recoil-decay tagging [21]. The plunger was primarily designed to measure excited
state lifetimes in proton-emitting nuclei with the JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT ap-
paratus [92]. When used with this setup the plunger is placed at the centre of
the JUROGAM-II array. The plunger uses a degrader foil, slowing recoiling nu-
clei from the target but still allowing them to pass from the target position into
RITU. Decays from the recoils can then be detected by GREAT and used to tag
prompt  rays detected at the target position, as is described in Subsection 4.3.1.
The target and degrader foils are stretched over their respective frames and opti-
cally aligned. The process of optical alignment consists of shining a bright light
through the gap between the target and degrader foils at different angles and
reducing the distance between the two foils. If the foils are aligned then the light
will be seen to disappear from the centre of the gap. If the light first disappears
from the top, bottom, left or right of the gap then the screws attaching the foil
frames to the plunger will have to be tightened or loosened. The minimum target-
to-degrader distance is determined by the uniformity of surface and alignment
of the two foils [93]. If the foil surfaces are sufficiently smooth and parallel then
target-to-degrader distances as low as 2 m may be used in DPUNS [21]. Con-
versely, the longest distances that can be used is determined by the maximum
travelling range of the plunger, which is 30 mm. In order to ensure a constant
distance between the target and degrader during the experiment, a low-voltage
feed back pulse is applied to the degrader foil and the induced voltage on the tar-
get foil continually recorded. The voltage is calibrated using a TESA GT43 axial
probe with a TT20 electronic micrometer. By measuring the change of distance
between the the two foils using the micrometer and reading off the corresponding
change in induced voltage using the axial probe, the voltage corresponding to
each distance between foils can be recorded. The induced signal is passed via a

under the National Instruments Labview framework [94], which continuously ad-
justs the distance between the target and degrader foils, while an experiment
is running, in accordance with the induced signal and the measured calibration.
The movement of the foils is achieved through the use of a 45 V high-precision
stepping motor. A technical diagram of DPUNS is shown in Fig. 3.10.
The low voltage of the stopper motor allows it to be used in the low-pressure gas
environment of RITU. The helium in RITU has the benefit of countering some
of the heating effects caused by the impinging of the beam on the target and
degrader foils, which could alter the distance between the two foils. To ensure
that the beam line is kept at vacuum, a differential pumping system (roots pump)
is placed between DPUNS and the beam line at the target position. The roots
pump removes approximately 1000 m3/hr of helium from its position between
the beamline and JUROGAM-II [95]. This removes the need for carbon isolation
foils between the beam pipe and RITU. For the 98Mo(40Ar,4n) reaction at 165

MeV with a 0.1 g/cm2 carbon isolation foil, reactions with the carbon foil are
seen to constitute 30% of the total reaction products. As such, operation with
the roots pump is preferred to reduce contamination during the analysis [21].
Chapter 4
Analysis Techniques
The raw data collected by the JUROGAM-RITU-GREAT experimental setup
had to be processed using a variety of techniques to ensure coherent and accurate
detector outputs. These outputs were affected by corresponding detector efficien-
cies and individual electronic settings. The  rays emitted from recoiling nuclei
were detected with an associated Doppler shift which also needed to be corrected.
This chapter describes the techniques used to calibrate the raw detector outputs
as well as the tagging techniques utilised to produce the clean spectra used for
the lifetime analysis of 113Cs. The premise of the Recoil Distance Doppler Shift
(RDDS) method of measuring promptly decaying nuclear excited state lifetimes
is first discussed as well as the related Differential Decay Curve Method (DDCM)
which is used to accurately extract the lifetime information.
4.1 The Recoil Distance Doppler Shift Method
The extraction of excited nuclear state lifetimes can provide useful information
on many aspects of the nucleus [96], as covered in subsections 2.3.2 and 2.5.3.
Nuclear lifetimes between the picosecond and nanosecond range can be measured
through the use of differential plunger devices utilising the RDDS method [93].
A schematic of a simple plunger device is shown in Fig. 4.1.
Analysis Techniques 86
Figure 4.1: A schematic diagram of a plunger device taken from Ref. [93].
A beam is seen to strike a target on the left side of the figure, from which
recoiling fusion-evaporation reaction nuclei leave the target with velocity, v.
The fusion-evaporation recoils de-excite via the emission of  rays, which are
detected with an energy that is Doppler-shifted according to the value of v and
, the angle of the -ray detector with respect to the beam axis. The recoils
implant in a stopper foil at a distance, x, from the target foil. The  rays
emitted from the excited nuclei in the stopper are detected without a Doppler-
shift to their energy. For a certain -ray decay from an excited state, the
variation with x of the ratio of the intensities of the fully shifted and stopped
photopeaks can be used to infer the lifetime of the state.
A beam impinges on a target foil, from which recoiling nuclei are emitted. Typ-
ically fusion-evaporation reactions are used for plunger experiments, although
deep inelastic scattering or Coulomb-excitation reactions can also be used [93,
97, 98]. The excited recoiling nuclei de-excite through -ray emission. These
-rays, denoted by 
in Fig. 4.1, are detected with a Doppler shift, the magni-
tude of which is dependent on the velocity of the de-exciting recoil and the angle
of the detector to the axis along which the recoil is travelling. The recoils are
then conventionally stopped in a second foil placed close to the target foil. The
 rays emitted from nuclei which have implanted and stopped in the stopper
foil, denoted by 0 in Fig. 4.1, are detected without a Doppler shift. For a -ray
transition depopulating a state with a lifetime in the 1012-109 s range, there
will be target-to-stopper distances at which there exists fully shifted and stopped
photopeaks with different Doppler-shifted energies and intensities. These peaks

of the stopped (blue) and fully shifted (green) photopeaks of a -ray transition

considered to be detected at a backwards angle to the beam axis.
correspond, respectively, to the detection of  rays emitted by recoils before and
after implantation in the stopper foil. Increasing the target-to-stopper distance
will result in a longer time-of-flight between the foils, so more decays of the state
of interest will occur while the recoils are still in flight. Conversely, decreasing
the target-to-stopper distance will result in more decays from recoils that have
reached the stopper foil. Therefore, the intensities of the two photo-peaks can be
varied by changing the distance between the target and stopper foils, as is shown
by the schematic in Fig. 4.2.
Instead of a stopper foil, a degrader foil may sometimes be used, as was the case
with the plunger device used to collect the data detailed in this work. A degrader
foil slows, rather than stops nuclei, recoiling from the target foil, but still results
in two distinct recoil velocity regimes and, hence, two different Doppler-shifted
-ray energies per transition.

Level i
Figure 4.3: Schematic example of a level scheme. If the lifetime of the state
i is to be extracted, then the lifetimes of the states k have to be considered.
For an idealised case, the variation in intensity of the shifted and degraded pho-
topeaks of a transition takes the form of a simple exponential decay
IS = (IS + ID)
1 exp
(4.1)
ID = (IS + ID)exp
, (4.2)
where IS is the intensity of the shifted photopeak, ID is the intensity of the
stopped or degraded photopeak, x is the distance between the two foils of the
plunger, v is the velocity of recoils leaving the target foil and  is the lifetime of the
state being depopulated. By fitting the corresponding function to the variation
in the shifted or degraded intensity as a function of distance, the lifetime,  ,
of the excited state being depopulated by the detected -ray transition can be
extracted.
4.1.1 Treatment of Feeding
Although the idealised case for extracting the lifetime of an excited state, as given
in equations 4.1 and 4.2 can sometimes be used experimentally, the feeding of the
state of interest, i, frequently has to be considered. The states, k, that feed i, as
shown in the schematic in Fig. 4.3, often have non-zero lifetimes relative to the
Analysis Techniques 89
lifetime of i. For this more general case the lifetime of i is extracted by solving
the set of differential equations which also govern the decay of all of the feeding
states, k. These are known as the Bateman equations and are given by
n(t) = i  ni(t) +
k=i+1
k  nk(t)  bki, (4.3)
where, ni(t) and nk(t) are the number of nuclei in states i and k at time t, k and
i are the decay constants of levels k and i, respectively and bki are the branching
ratios of the levels k. The branching ratios are weighting factors used to reflect
the greater intensity of some of the transitions that populate level i compared to
others. The values of the branching ratios are normalised to fulfill the condition
k bki = 1. Substituting in experimental intensities, the solution of the
differential equation is then
ID = (IS + ID)e
t +
k=i+1
Mki[(i/k)e

where
Mki(i/k  1) = bkiITK  bki
m=k+1
Mmk +
m=i+1
Mkmbmi(m/k), (4.5)
the subscript m denotes the levels, which feed the states k, Mmk and Mki are the
initial population of the states m and k, respectively and ITK is the total feeding
intensity of the levels k.
For structures such as rigid rotational bands the lifetimes of states in the band
often reduce quickly at higher angular momenta and energies. For a case where
the lifetimes are sufficiently short in the higher energy levels, the feeding can be
simply considered as a single populating exponential of the form,
ID = (IS + ID)exp
 (ISk + IDk)exp
(4.6)
Analysis Techniques 90
where ISk and IDk are the intensities of the shifted and degraded components
and k is the lifetime of the transition which depopulates the state above i.
By separately fitting the intensity of the component peaks of the transitions
depopulating levels i and k as a function of distance, the lifetime of i can be
calculated.
4.2 The Differential Decay Curve Method
The differential decay curve method (DDCM) is an approach of extracting plunger
lifetime measurements which has many advantages over the solving of equation
4.4 shown in the previous section [99]. These include the facts that:
 Only experimentally accessible values of IS, ID, v and d are used.
 No assumption is made on the shape of the decay curve, R(t).
 Systematic errors in the consideration of the feeding behaviour of state i
can be more easily identified as detailed later in the chapter.
The derivation of the DDCM, for the case of the feeding levels being well known,
begins with the simple differential equation detailing the population and depopu-
lation of the state of interest shown in equation 4.3. By integrating this equation,
the following is obtained
 ni(t) = Ni(t) +
bkiNk(t) (4.7)
from the identities
Nj(t) =
j  nj(t
(4.8)
 ni(t) =
 ni(t
. (4.9)
Analysis Techniques 91
The index j = i or k depending on whether the state depopulates or populates
the state of interest, respectively. The differential of N(i) can be substituted for
ni(t) in equation 4.7 to obtain a value of  for the state of interest using the
following identities
Ni(t) = i[ni() ni(t)] (4.10)
ni() = 0, (4.11)
as ni(t) is then equivalent to ddtNi(t)/i. The term Ni can be related to the
experimentally measurable decay curve, Ri, through the introduction of  coef-
ficients such that Ri = Ni/ki, where ki is defined as,
ki =
k()  (Ek)
i()  (Ei)
(4.12)
and j() and (Ej) give the angular distribution and detection efficiency of
transitions k and i, respectively. This gives the final form of the DDCM lifetime
formulae,
i(t) = 1/i =
Ri(t) +
k kibkiRk(t)
Ri(t)
, (4.13)
or in terms of target-to-degrader distance
i(x) =
Ri(x) +
k kibkiRk(x)
Ri(x)
(4.14)
where v is the velocity of the fully shifted recoils.
All values in the numerator of equation 4.14 are experimentally accessible. How-
ever, the differential of the decay curve d
Ri(x) cannot be directly measured using
a two foil plunger. The standard procedure is then to fit an analytical function

to the experimental values Ri(x) found at several target-to-stopper distances and
to take the derivative of the fitted function as the denominator. The same re-
lationship in equation 4.14 holds whether intensities of fully shifted or degraded
peaks are used to construct the decay curve.
The lifetime of state i can be calculated at any distance where Ri and Rk are
calculated from the values Ri(x) = Ri(x)+
k kibkiRk(x) and d/dtRi(x). The
error on (i) will then result from the percentage error on Ri(x) and d/dtRi(x).
As the absolute error on the experimental measurement is approximately constant
across all distances, values of  measured in the range of distances over which
there is both a maximum value of Ri(x) and d/dtRi(x) will have smaller errors.
This range of distances is known as the region of sensitivity, and is shown in the
schematic diagram in Fig. 4.4

The lines denoted by (i) shows a case where feeding from a state is not included

feeding state with a longer lifetime than the average feeding timing of state i.
Case (ii) shows the ideal case when (i) is constant and all feeding is correctly
considered. Panels (a) and (b) show the cases where the feeding lifetime is
considered, respectively, to be longer and shorter than the lifetime of the state
i. Based on a Figure in Ref. [99].
The differential decay curve method also allows the easy identification of system-
atic errors in the assumed behaviour of the transitions populating i. Figure 4.5
shows different relationships between the lifetime of the state of interest i and
target-to-degrader distance. As i should be independent of target-to-degrader
distance the ideal case is that displayed for case (ii) in the figure. Curve (i)
indicates that there is an additional feeding level which has not been properly
considered in the analysis, so the value of Ri(x) is constantly higher than the
correct value of  . Conversely, curve (iii) indicates that a feeding level with a life-
time greater than the actual mean lifetime of the feeding states has been wrongly
included in the analysis.
The presence of unobserved side-feeding can be identified in the first instance
Analysis Techniques 94
from a difference in intensity of the populating and depopulating transitions of
the state of interest. The timing behaviour of any unobserved side-feeding can
be estimated by fitting a function F cij to the variation of i with distance where
F cij =
i  (bij
k ckexp(t/
, (4.15)
where ck and 
k are the intensities and lifetimes of the unobserved side-feeding,
which can be extracted using this fit.
Alternatively, if there is no sensitivity of (i) to target-to-degrader distance, x,
or flight time,  , it is commonly assumed that the timing behaviour of any side-
feeding is the same as the average timing behaviour of the population or depop-
ulation of the state of interest. This assumption is likely to be valid if there
are no observed significant structural changes of the nucleus above the level of
interest [99]. In this case, the side-feeding may be treated by multiplying the
decay curve of the populating transitions Rk by a coefficient C = Ik/Ii in the
numerator of equation 4.14, where Ik and Ii are the total intensities of the states
which populate and depopulate the state of interest.
4.3 Tagging Techniques
The TDR system allows the correlation of events detected in GREAT with those
detected in JUROGAM-II. Due to the high level of background events at the
target position, the correlation of events detected in JUROGAM-II with recoils
and recoil decays at the focal plane is needed to produce clean prompt -ray
spectra. The production of both recoil-tagged and recoil-proton-tagged spectra
is discussed below.
4.3.1 Recoil Tagging
In the experiment described in this work, the 58Ni(58Ni,p2n) fusion-evaporation
reaction was used to produce 113Cs along with other reaction products with sim-
ilar masses. As well as the desired fusion-evaporation products, some of the
Analysis Techniques 95
beam impinging on the target was scattered without forming compound nuclei
and some beam particles formed fusion-evaporation products through reactions
with the degrader foil of DPUNS. In order to provide clean prompt -ray spectra,
recoil-tagging was implemented to ensure that all -ray events were correlated
with the recoiling beam-on-target reaction products. The time of flight through
RITU can be calculated from the recoil velocity measured from the Doppler shift
of  rays detected at the target position and the known length of RITU. As indi-
vidual detector events are time-stamped and the time of flight through RITU is
known, prompt  rays can then be correlated with the subsequent implantation
of the -ray emitting nuclei in one of the DSSDs of GREAT.
The target recoils detected in GREAT were differentiated from scattered beam
and recoils from beam and degrader reaction products that had transited RITU,
through the imposition of a two-dimensional gating condition on both the time of
flight of particles between the MWPC and the DSSDs and the energy loss in the
MWPC. Beam nuclei have a higher velocity than the fusion-evaporation recoils,
so a time of flight condition can be used to differentiate the scattered beam that
has transited through RITU from the fusion-evaporation recoils. As the degrader
foil has a lower Z number than the target foil, a similar condition can also be
used to eliminate the degrader fusion-evaporation recoils from the recoil tag.
The energy loss of the reaction products in the MWPC can be approximated
using the Bethe-Bloch formula [26]
I.(1 2)
, (4.16)
where Z is the charge of the reaction product,  = v
where v is the velocity
of the recoils entering the MWPC, 0 is the permittivity of free space, n is the
electron density of the gas and I describes a mean ionisation potential of the gas.
From this formula it can be seen that the energy loss of a particle in the MWPC
is strongly dependent on its velocity, while all other terms are constant. The
energy loss of a reaction product is then found to be inversely proportional to its
velocity. As such, the energy loss of the fusion-evaporation recoils from the beam
on target reactions will be higher than that from the beam on degrader reaction
products, which in turn will have a higher energy loss than the scattered beam.
Analysis Techniques 96
Using these facts, a polygonal 2-D coincidence condition or gate could be placed
over the distinct area corresponding to the higher energy loss and longer time of
flight in the histogram shown in Fig. 4.6. All prompt  rays included in recoil-
tagged spectra had to be detected in coincidence with these events. Note that in
Fig. 4.6 the time of flight decreases versus channel number.

surrounded by the green line in the figure. The sharper peak to the right of
the highlighted area corresponds to reaction products from beam-on-degrader
reactions as well as scattered beam products. The time of flight decreases with
increasing channel number.
4.3.2 Proton Tagging
113Cs has a very low production cross section of  30 b compared to the main
channels of the fusion-evaporation reaction listed in Section 5.2. Therefore, a
higher degree of selectivity than recoil-tagging was needed to observe its prompt
 rays over those of the main channels in the reaction. This selectivity was
provided by a two-dimensional energy and decay time gate on the proton-decay
of 113Cs. Decay events were defined as an event which was in anti-coincidence
Analysis Techniques 97
with an MWPC signal, detected in a pixel of the DSSD, subsequent to a recoil
implant in the same pixel. The recoil in this case was defined by a DSSD signal
in delayed coincidence with a JUROGAM-II signal. A 2-D histogram of energy
versus decay time was created in order to identify decay products in the DSSD.
The decay time was defined as the difference in time between the detection of a
recoil and a subsequent decay event, while the energy simply corresponds to the
energy of the decay event detected in the DSSD. The two-dimensional histogram
is shown in Fig. 4.7 and shows the two-dimensional gate on the protons emitted
by 113Cs. This encompasses a time range of 10-200 s and an energy range of
850-1030 keV, comprehensively covering the established decay properties of 113Cs
of 969(8) keV and 17.1(2) s [12].

4.4 Data Correction
In order to form the accurate recoil-tagged and proton-tagged -ray spectra used
to analyse the collected data, it was first necessary to apply a number of correc-
tions to the different detector events. These corrections are detailed below.
Analysis Techniques 98
4.4.1 Energy Calibration
In the experiment described in this work, a variety of different sources were used
to calibrate each individual detector to ensure a well defined relationship between
the channel number recorded by the ADCs and the actual energy of the detected
decays. Accurate calibrations were also required in order to gain match individual
detectors to ensure well defined peaks in spectra formed from the output of more
than one detector. Germanium detectors were calibrated using mixed 133Ba and
152Eu sources while conversion electrons from 133Ba and a triple-, mixed 239Pu-
241Am-244Cm source was used to calibrate the individual strips of the DSSD and
the pin diodes. Calibration spectra were formed for each individual detector
output. The centroids and intensities of the observed -ray, electron and -
particle peaks were then extracted using Gaussian fits. To identify the peaks in
each spectrum, the channel number and intensity of the fitted peaks were then
compared with peak energies and relative intensities from Refs. [100102]. A
calibration relating channel number to energy could then be made, taking the
form of a quadratic polynomial
E = a+ bx+ cx2, (4.17)
where x is the channel number, E the correct peak energy and a, b and c the
calibration coefficients. The c coefficient was found to be small for the germanium
detectors (of the order 108) but there was found to be significant non-linearity
in the lower energy regions of the DSSD strips, as is discussed in Section 5.3.
Examples of germanium detector and DSSD strip calibration spectra are shown
in Fig. 4.8.
4.4.2 Efficiency Correction
The measured intensities of the 113Cs -ray transitions had to be corrected to
compensate for the efficiencies of the JUROGAM-II detectors at different ener-
gies. Data were collected at the start and end of the experiment detailed in this
work using a mixed 152Eu and 133Ba source. Efficiency corrections were under-
taken for the individual JUROGAM-II rings as well as the entirety of the array.

The -ray intensities of the photopeaks from the 152Eu and 133Ba sources were
recorded and compared to the known intensities from Refs. [100, 103]. The varia-
tion of the ratio of the measured and reference intensities versus energy was then
fitted with a function of the form

and y = log(E/1000). The A, B and C coefficients describe the detector response
at low energies while the D, E and F coefficients describe the detector behaviour
at high energies. The G coefficient defines the gradual turning point between the
two regions. The efficiency of Ring 2 ( = 133.6) of JUROGAM-II versus energy
is shown in Fig. 4.9, fitted by the function in equation 4.18.

4.4.3 Add-back
Add-back is the process of reconstructing -ray decays which have been Compton
scattered between more than one crystal of a segmented detector. Add-back
was applied to the JUROGAM-II Clover detector signals in this work. If two
signals were detected within 10 ns in adjacent crystals then a single event was
constructed consisting of the summed energies of the individual signals. Due to
the geometry of the four crystals diagonal correlations were not used, as there is
a low probability of a  ray scattering directly between diagonal crystals. These
events also fall under the veto of the BGO shields surrounding each detector. For
cases where  rays were detected in a crystal but simultaneously detected in the
BGO shield, the event was vetoed. This reduced the Compton background in
the germanium detector spectra. The common outcomes for a  ray entering a
clover germanium detector are shown schematically in Fig. 4.10.

scatters from the first crystal into an adjacent crystal where the scattered

provide the correct energy for the incident  ray. (c) The BGO veto case, where
the incident  ray is scattered out of the detector and is then detected in the
BGO shield. The BGO signal vetoes coincident signals from the germanium
detector.
4.4.4 Doppler Correction and Recoil Velocity
The energies of  rays emitted by nuclei recoiling from the target foil are shifted
by an amount dependent on the recoil velocity. The velocity of the recoiling
nuclei must be known in order to correct for the Doppler-shift and create -ray
spectra with peaks at the correct energies. Additionally, the velocity must be
well known to accurately calculate the lifetime of excited nuclear states using the
DDCM. The velocity of the recoils is calculated from the observed Doppler Shift
of known -ray energies given by
E = E0(1 +  cos ), (4.19)
where E is the Doppler-shifted energy of the  ray, E0 is the true energy of the
emitted  ray,  is the velocity of the recoils as a fraction of the speed of light
and  is the angle to the direction of travel at which the  ray is emitted. This
Analysis Techniques 102
relationship holds for recoil velocities which are a small fraction of the speed of
light.
The different rings of JUROGAM-II have well-defined angles, , relative to the
beam axis. As such, the shift in observed -ray energy as a function of  can be
used to extract the velocity of the recoils using equation 4.19, if the unshifted -
ray energies are known. In this work different 113Cs proton-tagged, JUROGAM-II
ring spectra were created with no Doppler correction applied. The data in these
spectra were taken at a long target-to-degrader distance of 3000 m to ensure
that each transition had only a fully shifted component. The 166-, 384-, 596-,
658- and 719 keV transitions were identified from their relative intensities [12]
and the variation in position of the transition centroids in each of the rings were
then separately plotted as a function of cos(). Linear fits to the variation of
centroid position were then used to extract the velocity of the fully shifted recoils

then taken from an average of the individual velocities listed in Table 4.1. This
velocity was subsequently used to apply a Doppler correction to all -ray spectra
shown in Chapter 5 used during the analysis.

4.4.5 Doppler Broadening
The widths of observed  rays emitted from recoils are affected by the recoil
velocity. This is due to the finite opening angle of the detectors, with respect
to the beam axis. This finite angle effectively allows a range of Doppler shifted
energies to be detected in the same detector, resulting in a broader final energy

where all symbols are the same as in equation 4.19, E is the amount of Doppler
broadening and  is the opening angle of the detector. Detectors at =90 to
the beam axis are affected more by Doppler broadening. In JUROGAM-II this
is offset somewhat by having the segmented clover detectors at the angles about
90. The greater granularity of the clover detectors means that the acceptance
angle is reduced to the acceptance angle of one crystal, while the detector as a
whole still covers a large area [104]. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4.12.

beam axis of 75 and 105 is then   5 while the acceptance angle for the
phase 1 detectors at angles of 158 and 134 is   9.
In some -ray spectra used during the work presented in this thesis, the width of
-ray peaks could not be directly measured due to the low statistics present in the
spectra. As the inherent resolution of the germanium detector is approximately
constant in the hundreds of keV range [105], the difference in width between two
-ray peaks was dominated by the difference in Doppler broadening. Knowing
the difference in Doppler broadening at different energies allows the width of low
statistics peaks to be calculated using a peak of measurable width and similar
energy. This process is described further in Section 5.6.

Results
The lifetime of the (11/2+) state in 113Cs was measured using the DPUNS plunger
device [21] in a fusion-evaporation experiment at the University of Jyvaskyla.
Recoil-decay tagging was used to create prompt 113Cs proton-tagged -ray spec-
tra, for each plunger target-to-degrader distance. The  rays in these spectra were
correlated with fusion-evaporation recoils arriving at the focal plane and protons
emitted from 113Cs, which were identified from their distinct decay energies and
half-lives. The spectra showed the changing relative intensity of the decay of the
(11/2+) state before and after the degrader foil of the plunger, as a function of
target-to-degrader distance. Gaussian fits were used to extract the intensities of
the two photopeaks, corresponding to the decay of the (11/2+) state before and
after the degrader foil. The extracted intensities were normalised and used to cal-
culate the lifetime of the (11/2+) state within the framework of the Differential
Decay Curve Method [99]. The conditions used to construct the proton-tagged
spectra, the extraction and subsequent normalisation of the photopeak intensities
and the calculation of the lifetime of the (11/2+) state lifetime are described in
more detail in this chapter. The identification of other decay products created
by the fusion-evaporation reaction is also covered, as well as the calculation of a
limit on the lifetime of the (15/2+) state and the energy and half-life of proton
emission from 113Cs.

5.1 Experimental Setup
This section details the specific experimental setup used for the 113Cs experiment
at the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyvaskyla. The synthesis and
excitation of 113Cs was achieved by means of a fusion-evaporation reaction. A
4-pnA beam of 58Ni with charge state 8+ was accelerated by the K-130 cyclotron
to an energy of 230-MeV and impinged on a 1.1 g/cm2 58Ni target mounted
on the DPUNS plunger device. The beam energy was chosen based on Refs.
[8, 9] to provide the maximum cross section for the creation of 113Cs from the
58Ni(58Ni, p2n) reaction. Estimates for the cross section varied from 5-30 b
[12, 22]. In order to provide the two different recoil velocity regimes needed for
the analysis, a 1.5 g/cm2 natural degrader foil was also mounted on DPUNS to
slow down the compound nuclei recoiling from the target.
The JUROGAM-II HPGe array surrounded the target position. During the ex-
periment the array consisted of 14 phase 1 detectors, with 5 placed in Ring 1 and
9 placed in Ring 2, while there were also 12 clover detectors in each of Rings 3 and
4. The target chamber shared the same helium gas environment of RITU. The
gas pressure was adjusted in tandem with the fields generated by the magnets
of RITU in order to provide the maximum transmission of the recoiling nuclei
and minimum transmission of beam products to the GREAT focal plane. The
optimum helium pressure used during the experiment was found to be 1.2 mbar,
while the field of the first quadrupole magnet was set at 449 mT, the first dipole
magnet at 492 mT and the final two quadrupole magnets at 362 mT and 392 mT,
respectively. The GREAT array consisted of the full complement of detectors,
as described in Section 3.5. The rate at which recoils implanted in the DSSDs
throughout the experiment was approximately 8.5 kHz, while the rate at which
protons from 113Cs were detected was 0.13 Hz. Typical rates for each detector
are listed in Table 5.1.
5.2 Reaction Products at the Target Position
The main channels from the fusion-evaporation reaction used during the experi-
ment were identified using a recoil-tagged prompt  matrix. This matrix was
created in grain, with the condition that all events had to be correlated with a

recoil implant in the DSSDs. The recoils were differentiated from scattered beam
products through the imposition of a two-dimensional gate on the energy-loss of
events in the MWPC and the time of flight between the MWPC and DSSD, as de-
scribed in Subsection 4.3.1. Prompt -ray events included in the matrix also had
to be detected within 10 ns of at least one other prompt  ray. By setting gates
on -ray energies in this matrix and observing which other transition energies
were detected in coincidence, cascades of coincident -rays could be identified.
The vast majority of these -ray cascades have been previously observed and
attributed to the de-excitation of a particular nucleus. The efficiency-corrected
-ray intensities were then used to give an estimate of the relative intensity of
each reaction product.
The chosen beam energy was important to ensure the maximum cross section for
the production of 113Cs nuclei in the 58Ni+58Ni fusion evaporation reaction. The
main channels of the 58Ni+58Ni reaction for different beam energies are shown
in the spectra below to demonstrate the differences in relative production cross-
section of the main reaction products with changing beam energy. The main
reaction channels for beam energies of 210-, 230- and 250-MeV are shown in Fig.
5.2. A more comprehensive list of the different reaction products is shown in
Table 5.2.
Projections from the JUROGAM II recoil-tagged   matrices used to identify
the main reaction products for each beam energy are shown in Fig. 5.1. The 210-
and 250-MeV beam-energy reactions were taken from an experiment undertaken
in 2012 using the same experimental setup as that used for the 230-MeV data.

ces used to identify the main reaction products from the 58Ni+58Ni fusion-

ergies, a number of reaction products are present from beam on target frame
reactions. These 58Ni+Al, A  80 reaction products are also marked in panels
(a) and (c) of the figure.
During this experiment the beam was unfocused or misaligned for a period, re-
sulting in reactions between the aluminium frame of the plunger and the 58Ni
beam. This resulted in many reaction products with masses of A  80. The
 rays emitted by these lower-mass fusion evaporation recoils were much more
intense than those from the beam-on-target recoils, as shown in Fig. 5.1. Due
to these high intensities, the mass A  80 reaction products could not all be re-
moved before reaching the focal plane or entirely excluded from the recoil-tagging
gate.

5.3 Reaction Products at the Focal Plane
The different decay products detected in the DSSDs, as shown in Fig. 5.3 were
variously identified from their energies, decay times, prompt -ray coincidences
and predicted cross sections. The protons emitted by the decay of 113Cs were
identified in Fig. 5.3 (a) from both the known decay energy of Ep = 969(8)
keV and half-life T1/2 = 17.1(2) s [12]. The
113Cs proton-tagging gate is shown
enclosed by the red line in Fig. 5.3 and covers an energy range of 850-1030 keV
and a time range of 10-200s, encompassing the known energy and decay lifetime.
These ranges were used to not only visually encompass all events corresponding to
113Cs decay shown in Fig. 5.3 (a), but to also ensure that no other decay products
were erroneously included in the gate. The low background in the DSSD at  1
MeV meant that events detected within the correct energy range at several half-
lives were still most likely to have come from the decay of 113Cs. Proton-tagged
prompt -ray spectra were subsequently created, as shown in Section 5.5, and
were found to only contain -ray transitions from 113Cs [12], showing that the
proton-tagging gate used did not contain any contaminants.
Approximately 500 protons emitted by 109I and 112Cs were detected in the DSSDs.

spectrum shown in Fig. 5.3 (b) was found to have an energy of 813(4) keV. This
value is consistent with the 813(3) keV proton energy of 109I [107] and also the
810(5) keV proton energy of 112Cs [55]. Setting a gate on the energy of the 813-
keV peak in Fig. 5.3 (a) and projecting the resultant timing spectrum allowed the
half-life of the decays in the peak to be measured. Fitting a decay curve to the
timing spectrum shown in Fig. 5.4 returns a half-life value for the 813-keV decay
of 158(10) s. This value is neither consistent with the known 103-s half-life of
109I [108] or with the 490 s half-life of 112Cs [55], suggesting that the 813-keV
peak results from the decay of both nuclei. However, due to the low statistics
available and the consistent energies of protons emitted from 112Cs and 109I, the
relative quantity of each nuclei cannot be determined.

half-life of the 813-keV protons emitted by 109I and is over 6 away from the
490 s half-life of the 810-keV protons emitted by 112Cs. This indicates that
the decays observed at 813-keV in the DSSD originate from protons emitted
by both 109I and 112Cs.
were identified as internal conversion electrons from the decay of the low-lying
(11/2) isomeric state in 113Xe and the (7/2+) state between the isomer and
the ground state [73]. Due to the high statistics of the broad peaks, recoil-
decay-tagged prompt -ray spectra could be created to identify the decay events
from the corresponding characteristic prompt -ray spectra. Four separate RDT
gates with the same time ranges of 10-40 s and energy gates of similar  40
keV widths but incrementally higher energies were initially used to create four
different prompt -ray spectra. These spectra were used to deduce whether all
decay products in the broad peaks were from the same nucleus or whether there
was more than one decay product, which would be evidenced by individual peaks
in the separate spectra having different relative intensities. All four gates returned
spectra containing the same energy -ray events with the same relative intensities,
despite some differences in the statistics between each spectrum. All identified
prompt -rays were from 113Xe [109], the different decay-tagged spectra are shown
in Fig. 5.5.
The fact that all prompt -ray transitions in the decay-tagged spectra come from
113Xe strongly indicates that the decay products in the two broad peaks also result
from 113Xe. The decay of 113Xe proceeds by means of +-decay, which can be de-
tected by the DSSDs. Additionally, 113Xe also has an isomeric state depopulated

by low energy transitions, which may decay by the emission of internal-conversion
electrons, which can also be detected in the DSSDs. The + particles and inter-
nal conversion electrons can be differentiated by their vastly different half-lives
of 2.8 s [110] and 10 s [73], respectively. Timing spectra for both low-energy
peaks in Fig. 5.3 were formed by setting gates on the energy of each peak and
projecting the resultant timing spectra. These spectra were then converted into
a logarithmic format and the half-lives of each decay were extracted from linear
fits to the variation of the intensity of each peak with time. The timing spectra
and associated fits are shown in Fig. 5.6.
The half-lives extracted from both spectra are consistent with the measured
10(4) s half-life of the isomeric (11/2+) state in 113Xe as measured in Ref. [73].

Figure 5.6: The timing spectra formed by energy gates set in Fig. 5.3 on
(a) the lower energy and (b) higher energy bumps shown in Fig. 5.3 around
channel 300. The decay curves of both of these features are consistent with
the 10(4) s isomeric decay of the 11/2 state in 113Xe, indicating that these
features result from the internal conversion decay of the isomeric state and
7/2+ state in 113Xe.
This indicates that the two broad peaks result from internal conversion electrons
from decays from the (11/2+) or lower-energy states. The fact that there are two
transitions between the isomer and the ground state of 113Xe, which can account
for the fact that there are two broad peaks, also lends weight to the assignment
of these decays. The fact that there are counts visible over a large timing range
at the energy of the two peaks indicates that the + decays may also be detected
in the DSSDs within this energy range. It should be noted that the 113Xe peaks
have a much broader profile than the internal conversion electron peaks in the
source spectrum shown in Fig. 4.8. Additionally, the energy of the two peaks
does not correspond to the known -ray energies of the transitions depopulating
the (7/2+) state or the x-ray energies of 113Xe. This indicates that the DSSDs
may be very non-linear at low energies. It should be noted that the 133Ba energies
were found to be accurate in the calibrated DSSD and that the higher energies
Results 115
of all other decay products were found to be consistent with known values.
The broad peak in the spectrum around 3 MeV has the characteristic shape
and typical energy range of -delayed proton decays [111]. The nuclei 112I and
113Xe are tentatively assigned to the -delayed proton events, as the limits of the
distribution in Fig. 5.3 are consistent with proton energies detected from these
nuclei of 2.5 MeV-5 MeV [111]. Additionally, 112I is the only -delayed proton
emitter for which -ray transitions have been observed at the target position,
while 113Xe is the only nucleus that has -ray transitions detected at the focal
plane. This indicates that 112I and 113Xe are the most intensely populated reaction
channels, which may yield -delayed proton emission and that detected -delayed
protons are from these nuclei. The 112I and 113Xe half-lives of 3.4 s and 2.7s,
respectively, are too long to be measured to aid the identification of the decays.
This time encompasses several beam pulses from the cyclotron [76] so there is a
strong likelihood that a decay event may be correlated with the wrong recoil and
hence an incorrect lifetime may be measured. Clean recoil-decay-tagged spectra
could then not be created to identify decay products from their prompt  rays
as was done for the internal conversion decays of 113Xe.
An additional narrower peak, which lies on the -delayed proton spectrum, has
been measured to have an energy of 3898(3) keV. This energy is consistent within
4 of the published value of 3862(10)-keV [112] for  particles emitted by the
decay of 107Te. The fusion evaporation code PACE [113] predicts that 107Te will
be produced with a cross section of 0.39 mb by the 58Ni+58Ni reaction at 230
MeV. As PACE gives a cross-section for 113Cs of 0.36 mb, which is abundant in
the DSSD spectrum it was considered to be possible for -particles from similar
cross-section reaction products to also be detected. Therefore, the 3898-keV peak
is tentatively assigned to result from the  decay of 107Te. Similarly to the -
delayed proton decays, it was not possible to further characterise the decay events
at 3898 keV through -ray coincidences and lifetime measurements, due to the
long half-life and low intensity of the decay.

5.4 Lifetime and Energy of Proton Emission from
113Cs
The lifetime and energy of ground-state proton emission from 113Cs were mea-
sured from the 2D histogram shown in Fig. 5.3. The energy was measured by
applying a Gaussian fit to the peak corresponding to the 113Cs proton emission
in the energy projection as shown in Fig. 5.3 (b). The centroid of the peak
was found to be 950(8) keV. This energy is consistent within 3 of the previous
measurements of the proton energy (in chronological order) of 980(80) keV [9],
974(4) keV [114], 959(6) keV [115] and 969(8) keV [12].
A gate was set on the 950-keV proton peak in the 2D histogram and the resultant
timing spectrum was projected. This energy gate on the 113Cs protons had a range
of 880-1010 keV based on the width of the peak in the energy spectrum seen in
Fig. 5.3. The timing spectrum from a background energy gate of 1050-1180
keV was also projected and subtracted from the timing spectrum resultant from
the energy gate on the 113Cs protons. This background subtraction reduced the
number of random timing correlations that were present within the proton energy
gate. A background gate with a higher energy than the proton gate was chosen
so that 113Cs, 112Cs and 109I protons, which escaped from the DSSD and only had
a portion of their energies detected by the DSSD were not favourably background
subtracted. By fitting a decaying exponential function to the number of counts
versus time in the background-subtracted proton-emission timing spectrum, the
lifetime of proton emission from the ground state of 113Cs was found to be  =
24.4(2) s. This value is consistent with the known lifetime of  = 24.7(3) s
previously measured in Ref. [12]. The variation of proton-emission intensity with
time and the fitted decay curve are shown in Fig. 5.7.
5.5 Construction of Proton-tagged Spectra
To extract the lifetime of an excited state using the DDCM, the variation with
target-to-degrader distance of the intensities of the fully shifted and degraded
components of a -ray transition depopulating the state of interest must be

known. As such, individual -ray spectra corresponding to different target-to-
degrader distances were created to show the variation of these component inten-
sities for transitions between excited states in 113Cs.
The (11/2+) excited state was expected to have a measurable lifetime based on
Refs. [13, 116]. As such, the first target-to-degrader distance was chosen based on
a calculation of the (11/2+) state lifetime in 113Cs by Moller and Nix [13, 116] and
the expected fully shifted recoil velocity as calculated from the pace 4 code [113].
The subsequent distances were chosen based on the observed ratio of counts in the
two photopeaks of the 384-keV transition at the first target-to-degrader distance.
More particularly, these distances were chosen in order to provide a range of
target-to-degrader distances over which there is a large variation of intensities
of the fully shifted and degraded photopeaks as required to construct the decay
curve of the (11/2+) state.
Target-to-degrader distances of 135-, 210-, 300-, 590- and 3000-m were chosen
to form the decay curve of the (11/2+) state. The 300 m distance was initially
chosen based on the theoretical predictions so that the intensity of the 384-keV
(11/2+) to (7/2+) transition was evenly distributed between its fully shifted and
degraded components. The 135-, 210- and 590-m distances were chosen to
provide different ratios of fully shifted and degraded intensities, with measurable
intensities in both components. The 3000-m distance was chosen to provide a
Results 118
limit at which all intensity was present in the fully shifted component, to improve
the fit of the decay-curve, which is described in more detail later.
To ensure clean prompt -ray spectra for the measurement of the low cross section
113Cs transitions, proton-tagged spectra were created for each target-to-degrader
distance. To ensure the separation of the fully shifted and degraded components
of the 384-keV (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition, only events detected in Ring 2 of
JUROGAM-II were used to fill these spectra. By using detectors from a single
ring of the array with the same polar angle for each detector, the separation
and widths of the two components was constant making the extraction of the
component intensities easier. Ring 2 was chosen over Ring 1 as it contained nine
rather than five detectors. Rings 3 and 4 were not used as, with these rings sub-
tending 90, the separation of the fully shifted and degraded components was not
sufficient for simple fitting of the two component intensities. The proton-tagged
JUROGAM-II Ring 2 spectra for the individual target-to-degrader distances are
shown in Fig. 5.8, zoomed in on the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition.
More target-to-degrader distances were not used due to the low cross-section
of the reaction which restricted the available statistics. Five distances was the
greatest number that could be used while ensuring that the photopeaks of the
384-keV transition had enough counts to be discernibly Gaussian and distinct
from background in the proton-tagged spectra used during the analysis.
In order to verify the cleanliness of the proton-tagged spectra and to observe
any instance of measurable lifetimes evidenced by more than one component per
transition, sum spectra corresponding to all target-to-degrader distances used
were examined. The 384-keV transition proved to be the only transition which
had two photopeaks over the range of target-to-degrader distances used. This
sum spectrum is shown in Fig. 5.9.
The intensities of all observed 113Cs spectra were measured from this spectrum
and are listed in Table 5.3. The intensities have previously been measured in Ref.
[12] and a level scheme constructed. The intensities measured in this work may
imply a different ordering of the transitions but the errors on intensities are all
consistent with those measured in Ref. [12]. The fact that a single projection had
to be used to measure the transitions means that resolving doublets was some-
times problematic. The level scheme of 113Cs built on the basis of the measured

5.6 Extraction of Gamma-ray Transition Inten-
sities
As can be seen from Fig. 5.8 the Gaussian profile of the peaks is not obvious due
to the low number of counts in each photopeak. However, from the sum spectrum
shown in Fig. 5.9 and the shape of peaks in Fig. 5.1 it becomes apparent that the
photopeaks assume this profile when there are sufficient statistics available. As
such to extract the intensities of the two photopeaks in the individual distance
spectra, Gaussian fits were applied to the photopeaks using the Radware gf3
software [117]. The widths and centroids of the photopeaks were held constant
during these fits.

Table 5.3: The fitted energies and relative intensities of the 113Cs transi-
tions seen in Fig. 5.9. The energies marked by stars were from transitions
which formed doublets and could not have centroids reliably extracted. These
energies are instead taken from Ref. [12].
In order to extract the width of the fully shifted photopeak of the (11/2+) to
(7/2+) 384-keV transition, a Gaussian fit was first applied to the fully shifted
component visible in the sum spectrum of the individual 590 m and 3000 m
spectra shown in Fig. 5.8 (d) and (e). At these distances the degraded component
remained small and did not interfere with the Gaussian fit to the fully shifted
component. The centroid of the fully shifted component could be fixed in this
fit, as the Doppler-corrected centroid is known to be 384 keV.
In order to extract the width of the degraded photopeak its centroid first had
to be extracted. The velocity of the degraded recoils could not be experimen-
tally measured using the same method as was used for the fully shifted recoils
due to the absence of a degraded component for the majority of 113Cs transi-
tions. Additionally, no short target-to-degrader distance was used, so there was
no proton-tagged plunger spectrum with all of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition
intensity contained within the degraded peak. A different technique was used
whereby the centroid and width of the degraded peak were extracted from a
Gaussian fit to the degraded component of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition in
Results 123
the spectrum shown in Fig. 5.9. As the fully shifted and degraded peaks are not
completely separated and slightly overlap, the previously extracted width and
centroid of the fully shifted photopeak were held constant during the fit.
The width and centroid of the fully shifted component of the (15/2+) to (11/2+)
596-keV transition were extracted using the same method as was used for the
fully shifted component of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition. The centroid and
width of the degraded component of the 596-keV transition could not be directly
fitted due to the low number of counts in the degraded components and the lack
of a well-defined Gaussian shape. The centroid shift between the fully shifted
and degraded components of the (15/2+) to (11/2+) transition is dependent on
the difference in velocities of the fully shifted and degraded recoils. The ratio
between the centroids of fully shifted and degraded components will be the same
for all transitions as shown by rearranging equation 4.19 to the form
E/E0 = (1 + cos()). (5.1)
For transitions detected in the same ring of detectors in JUROGAM-II the right-
hand side of equation 5.1 will be constant. The centroid of the degraded compo-
nent of the (15/2+) to (11/2+) transition was then deduced to be 604 keV using
the known centroid of the fully shifted 596-keV component and the ratio between
the fully shifted and degraded centroids of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition.
The width of the degraded component of the (15/2+) to (11/2+) transition was
calculated from the increased Doppler broadening relative to the (11/2+) to
(7/2+) transition. The Doppler broadening of 113Cs transition components can
be calculated using equation 4.20. The velocity of the degraded recoils was first
obtained using equation 4.19 and the shift between the degraded and fully shifted
centroids of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition . The velocity of the degraded recoils
was found to be d = 0.018(2).
The Doppler broadening of the degraded components of the (11/2+) to (7/2+)
and (15/2+) to (11/2+) transitions were then calculated using equation 4.20 and
the increase in Doppler broadening between the two components was found from
the difference between the two transitions such that,
E604 E389 = (E604  E389)(dsin()), (5.2)
Results 124
where, E389 and E604 is the Doppler broadening of the  rays at energies 389-
and 604-keV, respectively and all other symbols have the same meanings as in
equation 4.20. The inherent resolution of the JUROGAM-II detectors was as-
sumed to be constant between 384-keV and 596-keV, as the germanium detectors
do not typically lose resolution until much higher energies [105]. The inherent
widths of the degraded components of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) and (15/2+) to
(11/2+) transitions could then be thought to be the same and only the increased
Doppler broadening had an effect on the peak widths. Using the measured width
of the degraded component of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition and the calcu-
lated Doppler broadening, the width of the degraded component of the (15/2+)
to (11/2+) transition was found to be 5.3 keV using equation 5.2. The centroids
and widths of all components are listed in Table 5.4. By fixing these parame-
ters in the fits using gf3, more accurate intensities could be extracted for all
components.

5.7 Normalisation of Gamma-ray Transition In-
tensities
The measured component intensities had to be normalised to account for the
different times at which data was collected at each target-to-degrader distance.
There are three methods which may be used to normalise the component inten-
sities for the different distances:
 Normalise the number of counts in each component as a proportion of the
total number of counts in the transition at each target-to-degrader distance
Results 125
 Normalise the component intensities to the number of counts in a total
projection spectrum at each target-to-degrader distance
 Normalise the component intensities to the number of counts in one or more
transitions from a reaction product in a total projection spectrum at each
target-to-degrader distance.
The first method removes information on the timing behaviour of states popu-
lating the state of interest. The second method suffers from the fact that the
number of background events detected at the target position will increase as the
experiment progresses. The third method depends on the beam energy being
constant throughout the experiment, as reaction products will be created with
different cross sections for different beam energies. As the beam energy is gen-
erally constant at the University of Jyvaskyla, the third method was used to
normalise peak intensities.
The 957-keV peak in the total projection spectrum was used for normalising
the 113Cs peak intensities. This peak corresponds to the transition between an
18+ and a 16+ state in 112Te [118] and was chosen due to its high intensity and
separation from other transitions in the recoil-tagged total projection spectrum
used to measure its intensity. The lifetime of the 957-keV transition is short
enough that its intensity is fully contained within the fully shifted component
at all target-to-degrader distances [74]. Only this single peak was used as it
contained sufficient statistics, such that the error on the intensity was negligible
on its own compared to the intensities of the 113Cs transitions as measured in
the proton-tagged spectra. The difficulty of choosing another clean transition in
the total-projection spectrum was also considered. The intensities of the 957-keV
peak are listed below in Table 5.5.
The 300-m distance had fewer counts than all but the 3000-m distance due to
the lower beam current at the start of the experiment of 1.5-3 pnA. Data was
collected at the 3000-m distance for less time than the other target-to-degrader
distances as this distance was only used to provide an anchor point for the lifetime
fit and the reduction of statistical error was not as important as for the other
distances at which the lifetime of the (11/2+) state was calculated.

distance and were used to normalise the intensities of 113Cs transitions at each
distance.
5.8 Lifetime of the (15/2+) State in 113Cs
The lifetime of the (15/2+) state could not be measured using the DDCM as the
normalised fully shifted and degraded component intensities of the (15/2+) to
(11/2+) transition did not vary with the target-to-degrader distances used in the
experiment. The (11/2+) state is part of a rotational band structure, the higher
spin levels of which are expected to have short lifetimes. Equation 2.46, which
can be used to estimate the lifetimes of states in Band 1, if 113Cs is treated as a
rigid rotor, gives estimated lifetime values for the (11/2+), (15/2+) and (19/2+)
states of 38.3 ps, 3.6 ps and 1.2 ps, respectively. This calculation used the ground-
state deformation of 2 = 0.21 from Moller and Nix [116] and demonstrates the
expected reduction of decay time with increasing spin in the band.
Fig. 5.11 shows the fits used to extract the intensities of the (15/2+) to (11/2+)
transition components at each target-to-degrader distance. It can be seen that
the 604-keV degraded component of the (15/2+) to (11/2+) transition has a
low intensity for all target-to-degrader distances. Additionally, the degraded
component intensity has no correlation to target-to-degrader distance, as is shown
in Table 5.6.
As the DDCM could not be used, the lifetime of the (15/2+) state was instead
estimated from the normalised fully shifted and degraded counts at the 135-m
target-to-degrader distance. By treating the lifetimes higher up the rotational
band as being negligible compared to the lifetimes lower down the band, a simple
exponential decay can be used to extract the upper limit of the lifetime of the
(15/2+) state from,
Results 127

where Is and Id are the normalised intensities of the fully shifted and degraded
components of the 596-keV transition, v is the velocity of the fully shifted recoils,
x is the target-to-degrader distance and  is the lifetime of the 15/2+ state.
The experimental number of counts seen in the degraded component of the
(15/2+) to (11/2+) transition at the shorter target-to-degrader distances is far
less than that expected if the (15/2+) state had the lifetime value calculated us-
ing equation 5.3 and the longer distance intensities shown in Table 5.6. However,
if the counts at the 135-m distance are used to calculate the lifetime, then the
lifetime is short enough that no counts would be expected at the longer target-to-
degrader distances, which is consistent with the experimentally observed counts
within errors. The lifetime of the (15/2+) state calculated in this way is then
 < 5 ps. This is treated as an upper limit, as longer lifetimes would result in
a number of counts at longer target-to-degrader distances, which are not experi-
mentally observed. Another reason for treating the lifetime as an upper limit is
the lack of treatment of the timing behaviour of the feeding of the (15/2+) state.
This could artificially inflate the lifetime value of the (15/2+) state, as calculated
from equation 5.3.

The lifetime of the (11/2+) state was extracted using the Differential Decay Curve
Method (DDCM), described in Section 4.2. Due to the higher error on the in-
tensities of the degraded components of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition at the
longer target-to-degrader distances, the variation of the fully shifted component
intensities were used instead of the degraded component intensities. The fully
shifted component form of equation 4.14 was then
i(x) =
I384s (x) + kiI596s (x)
I384s (x)
(5.4)
where x is the target-to-degrader distance I384s is the intensity of the fully shifted
component of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) transition, I596s is the intensity of the fully
shifted component of the (15/2+) to (11/2+) transition, ki is the ratio of the
intensities of the (11/2+) to (7/2+) and (15/2+) to (11/2+) transitions and v
is the velocity of the fully shifted recoils.
The  coefficient is a measure of the unobserved side-feeding populating the state
of interest. As the coefficient is a constant, the same value is used to calculate the
lifetime at all target-to-degrader distances. The  coefficient was then calculated
separately at each target-to-degrader distance and an average value was found
and used in equation 5.4. The individual  values are listed in Table 5.8. From
these, the average coefficient was found to be  = 1.17(23). This  coefficient is
consistent with the  = 1.00(6) value calculated from Ref. [12], which implies no
additional side-feeding.
All quantities within equation 5.4 are experimentally measurable with the ex-
ception of the differential of the variation of the 384-keV fully shifted compo-
nent intensity with distance. By fitting a function to the 384-keV transition fully
shifted component intensity and taking its differential the lack of a corresponding

equation 5.4 can also be rearranged to the form of,

where t is an initial estimate for  , known as the taufactor. By simultaneously
of the fully shifted component intensities and the differential of the same function
to the RHS of equation 5.5, an optimal function describing d
I384s (x) can be found.
In this work the program snapa [119, 120] was used to apply the simultaneous fits.
The fit to the intensity of the fully shifted component of the 384-keV transition
versus distance took the form of two second-order polynomial fits, which were
fitted piecewise to the data. The differentials of the second order polynomials,
multiplied by t and divided by v, were simultaneously used to fit the RHS of
equation 5.5. The 2 value of the simultaneous fits can be extracted from

extracted for a certain value of t. By varying t, optimum fit parameters may
be extracted which result in a minimum 2 value, as found from equation 5.6.
The lifetime of the (11/2+) state at each target-to-degrader distance can then be
properly extracted from equation 5.8, which takes the form of
i(x) =
I384s (x) + kiI596s (x)
f (a0,a1,...,an)
. (5.8)
Using a weighted average of lifetimes measured at each target-to-degrader dis-
tance, a final value for the lifetime of the (11/2+) state could be obtained. The
individual lifetimes used were from the 135-, 210- and 300-m target-to-degrader
distances. These distances all lay within the region-of-sensitivity, in which the
errors on individual lifetimes were smallest. The weighted average of these indi-
vidual lifetimes gave a final value for the lifetime of the (11/2+) state of 24(6)
ps. The fits used to extract the denominator of equation 5.4 and the individual
target-to-degrader distance lifetimes are shown in Fig. 5.12.
The lifetime values at all distances are approximately constant, as shown in Table
5.9. This behaviour indicates that the decay of the states which feed the (11/2+)
state has been correctly considered; any unobserved side-feeding either has the
same timing behaviour, or proceeds much faster than, the decay of the (15/2+)
state.

Discussion
6.1 Calculation of the Deformation of 113Cs
Theoretical nonadiabatic quasiparticle model calculations, of the form described
in Subsection 2.6.3, were performed to extract the deformation of 113Cs from the
experimental results. In these calculations, the experimental rotational spectrum
of 112Xe [121] was used as the core to correctly account for any non-rigid rota-
tional behaviour of 113Cs [16, 67]. Wavefunctions extracted from this model were
then fixed and used consistently in both proton emission codes, based on the
approaches discussed in Ref. [16], and standard electromagnetic transition-rate
calculations, based on Ref. [66]. The half-lives for both proton emission and elec-
tromagnetic decays were then predicted using a common set of wavefunctions.
The same wavefunctions were also used to calculate the excitation energies of
excited states in bands 1 and 2 of 113Cs.
6.1.1 Deformation of 113Cs from Energies of Excited States
The excitation energies of band 1 in 113Cs were calculated using nonadiabatic
quasiparticle model wavefunctions and are shown in Fig. 6.1.

Solid lines represent the experimental values and dashed lines the theoretical
predictions.
As the K = 3/2+ state is the most likely candidate for the ground state of 113Cs
[12, 14], the excitation energies have been predicted relative to the energy of that
state. The deformation of 113Cs for the lower lying states in the band is shown
to agree with both the deformation predicted in the simpler adiabatic model of
=0.15-0.2 [14] and the early configuration mixed calculations of Bugrov which
also predicted a deformation of   0.2 [17]. However, the deformation appears
to reduce, based on the intersection of experimental and theoretical values as
the rotational frequency of the nucleus increases. A contrary behaviour is seen

increasing deformation as shown in Fig. 6.2.

bands shown at ~ 0.4 MeV are calculated to occur due to the breaking of
neutron pairs in the h11/2 shell [12]. The similarity of the alignment behaviour
of both bands lends weight to this assignment for both structures. This change
in the neutron configuration then changes the experimental excitation energies
relative to the theoretical values, which do not include the effect of the Coriolis
force on the neutrons.

6.1.2 Deformation of 113Cs from Lifetimes of Excited States.
The same wavefunctions that were extracted from the nonadiabatic quasiparticle
method could also be used to predict electromagnetic reduced transition proba-
bilities [66]. These theoretical values were compared to the experimental lifetimes
extracted for the (11/2+) and (15/2+) states. Figures 6.4(a) and 6.4(b) show the
results of a standard electromagnetic reduced transition probability B(E2) cal-
culation, as described in Subsection 2.5.3, for the lifetimes of the (11/2+) and
(15/2+) states in 113Cs as a function of 2 deformation. Wavefunctions extracted
from the nonadiabatic quasiparticle model for the (11/2+) and (15/2+) states of
113Cs were used in these transition rate calculations. Also shown in Fig. 6.4(a) is
the 24(6) ps lifetime for the (11/2+) state from the experimental DDCM analysis,
denoted by the red and black dashed lines. From Fig. 6.4(a), it can be seen that

which is consistent with the deformation extracted for the (11/2+) state. At de-
formations 2 > 0.25 in the calculation, Band 1 is crossed by the pure [404]9/2
configuration, beyond which the lifetime is no longer reflective of the underlying
configuration of Band 1.

6.1.3 Deformation of 113Cs from Proton-emission Rates
Employing the same nonadiabatic quasiparticle model wavefunctions used for the
-ray transition rates discussed above, the lifetimes for proton emission have been
calculated as a function of quadrupole deformation for the K =1/2+, 3/2+ and
5/2+ states which have been predicted to be candidates for proton emission [14].
Figure 6.5 shows the results of these calculations, along with the experimental
proton-emission half-life extracted in this work of 16.9(1) s, which is denoted by
the solid black line. The theoretical and experimental proton emission half-lives
are seen to agree for the 3/2+ state at deformation 2 = 0.08 and also at 2 =
0.22. The smaller 2 value of 0.08 is discounted as it does not agree with the
deformations predicted from the excitation energies of the states of Band 1, shown
in Fig. 6.1, nor with the deformation predicted from the lifetime of the (11/2+)
or (15/2+) states discussed above. The higher 2 = 0.22 value is however, in good
agreement with the deformations extracted from the electromagnetic transition
rates and also from the excitation energies of the states.
6.1.4 Summary of Different Deformation Values
The results from the various methods used to extract deformations for the (11/2+),
(15/2+) and (3/2+) states in 113Cs are summarized in Table 6.1.

average and standard deviation, 2 =0.22(6). This value is dominated by the
B(E2) calculation which is the experimental value with the most sensitivity to
the deformation of 113Cs. The deformation from the proton-emission half-life of
2 = 0.22 is consistent with the deformation extracted for the (11/2

the deformation of 2 > 0.19 given by the half-life of the (15/2

6.2 Reducing the Uncertainty of the Lifetime of
the (11/2+) State
The deformation of 113Cs extracted from this work confirms that the proton is
emitted from the (3/2+) ground state. However, the underlying nature of this
Discussion 140
K = (3/2+) state is not fully understood. The K = (3/2+) state is an admixture
of many individual states which lie close to the Fermi surface and contribute
significant components to the wavefunction. This is shown in Fig. 6.6 where the
radial component of the different wavefunctions which form the K = (1/2+) and
(3/2+) states have been calculated within the adiabatic approach described in
Section 2.6.1.
Figure 6.6: Figure taken from Ref. [15] showing the radial components, l,j ,
of the wavefunctions, which form the K = 1/2 and K = 3/2 states, which lie
close to the Fermi surface in 113Cs. The wavefunctions have been calculated
based on a deformation of 2 = 0.16 using the single-particle adiabatic method
described in Section 2.6.1.
As discussed in Subsection 2.6.3, the lifetime of the proton-emitting state is
strongly influenced by even small components of the wavefunction. By reduc-
ing the error on the deformation of 113Cs, the relative strength of the different
components of the wavefunction can be better understood. As the deformation is
sensitive to the lifetime of the (11/2+) state, by reducing the error on the lifetime
of the (11/2+) state the error on the deformation can in turn be reduced.
The lifetime of the (11/2+) state in 113Cs was extracted within the framework
of the DDCM. The DDCM makes use of fully shifted and degraded component
Discussion 141
intensities of the transitions populating and depopulating the (11/2+) state, as
well as the velocity of the fully shifted recoils to extract the lifetime of the state.
By reducing the uncertainty on the component intensities and recoil velocity, the
uncertainty on the lifetime can be reduced accordingly.
The low cross section of the 58Ni+58Ni reaction used in the experiment detailed in
this work, meant that the fully shifted and degraded components had low inten-
sities and corresponding high statistical error. Additionally, due to the running
time of the experiment, only five target-to-degrader distances could be used with
only three of these distances being sensitive to the lifetime of the (11/2+) state.
The final lifetime value was taken from a weighted average of the (11/2+) state
lifetime calculated at each of these three distances as described in Section 4.2.
Running a similar experiment for a greater amount of time would reduce the
error on the final lifetime value, through one of two approaches. Firstly, by
increasing the amount of statistics available at each target-to-degrader distance,
the statistical error on component intensities could be decreased, reducing the
errors on the lifetimes used to calculate the final lifetime value. Secondly, by
increasing the number of distances in the region of sensitivity, more individual
distance lifetime values could be obtained providing a smaller error on the final
average lifetime.
The low statistics of the experiment dominated the error on the lifetime of the
state. As such, for an increase in the amount of statistics at each target-to-
degrader distance a reduction on the lifetime error of the same order of magni-
tude as the reduction of the statistical error would be expected. For the case of
doubling the statistics at each target-to-degrader distance, the statistical error
will be reduced by a factor of
2 corresponding to the change in the Poisson
statistical error. The error on the lifetime of the (11/2+) state would then be
reduced from 6 to 4 ps.
Instead of doubling the amount of statistics at each of the experimental target-
to-degrader distances, more data could instead be collected at additional target-
to-degrader distances in the region of sensitivity. The errors on each individual
lifetime calculated at the individual target-to-degrader distances, shown in Table
5.9, show a small deviation. Assuming a similar spread of errors on the lifetimes
for extra target-to-degrader distance in the region of sensitivity, hypothetical indi-
vidual lifetimes and errors can be included in the weighted average that provides
Discussion 142
the final lifetime value for the (11/2+) state. Both theoretical and experimen-
tal target-to-degrader distances and the associated individual lifetime values are
shown in Table 6.2.

The proposed additional distances were chosen, based on the lifetime of the
(11/2+) state, to include a significant number of counts in both the fully shifted
and degraded components of the 384-keV transition depopulating the state. As
such, all these target-to-degrader distances are expected to provide individual life-
time points within the region of sensitivity. The errors on these lifetimes would
then be the same as those seen for the experimental target-to-degrader distances
which lie in the region of sensitivity. The experimental lifetimes and errors have
been used for the new 96-,116- and 162-m distances with the experimental aver-
age lifetime and error used for the remaining 248- and 375-m target-to-degrader
distances. Increasing the number of distances in the region of sensitivity at which
data is collected gives a reduced error on the final lifetime value of 4 ps, the same
reduction in error seen for collecting more data at the existing target-to-degrader
distances.
Increasing the amount of target-to-degrader distances may have a greater appeal
than collecting more data at the previous experimental target-to-degrader dis-
tances, as including a distance shorter than 135-m would provide a better limit
on the lifetime of the (15/2+) state. If the lifetime of the (15/2+) state were the
5 ps upper limit, then 20% of the intensity of the 596-keV transition depopulat-
ing the state would lie within the degraded component at a target-to-degrader
distance of 96 m. This would be a measurable 8 counts based on the average
intensity of the 596-keV transition collected at each target-to-degrader distance.
Discussion 143
If a smaller number of counts were measured in the degraded component then the
limit on the lifetime of the (15/2+) state could be correspondingly lowered. This
target-to-degrader distance is also sensitive to the lifetime of the (11/2+) state, so
this method provides an opportunity to concurrently improve the measurement
of the lifetime of both the (11/2+) and (15/2+) states.
The amount of statistics that can be gathered in a fusion-evaporation experiment,
which lasts a realistic amount of time, using the two foil DPUNS plunger does
not provide a dramatic reduction in the error on the lifetime. A triple-foil plunger
is currently being developed at the University of Manchester and may provide
a better tool for reducing the lifetime error of excited states in such a low cross
section nucleus. The addition of a stopper foil means that only one distance
between each of the foils needs to be used throughout the experiment. The
statistical error is then reduced as the total number of counts does not have to be
divided between different target-to-degrader distances. The use of a stopper foil
in a triple-foil plunger means that recoil-tagging can no longer be undertaken as
recoils can no longer travel from the plunger to focal plane detectors. A higher
production cross section of 113Cs would then be needed, which may be provided
by radioactive beam facilities. As such, a facility capable of creating higher energy
beams and with a different detector setup than the University of Jyvaskyla, such
as ISOLDE [123] may be needed for future experiments.
Chapter 7
Summary and Conclusions
This thesis presents data from a recoil-decay tagged differential plunger exper-
iment, which was performed to measure lifetimes of excited states in 113Cs in
order to extract a value for the deformation of the nucleus. The experimental -
ray transition rates, as well as the energies of excited states and proton-emission
rates, were compared to theoretical values, which were calculated as a function
of deformation using wavefunctions from a nonadiabatic quasiparticle model [16].
By checking the consistency of the deformations, deduced from the intersection
of the theoretical and experimental values, the validity of the nonadiabatic quasi-
particle model could be tested while giving an accurate deformation for 113Cs.
The lifetime of the excited (11/2+) state in the most intense rotational band
of 113Cs was measured to be  = 24(6) ps using the differential decay curve
method (DDCM). Due to the low production cross-section of 113Cs from the
58Ni+58Ni fusion-evaporation reaction, only five differential plunger target-to-
degrader distances could be used. These distances were optimised to measure
the lifetime of the (11/2+) state, so the DDCM could not be used to extract a
value for the significantly shorter lifetime of the (15/2+) state. However, the state
was found to have a lifetime limit of  5 ps from intensity matching arguments.
A deformation value of 2 = 0.22(6) was extracted for
113Cs from the lifetime and
excitation energy of the (11/2+) state. The lifetime limit of the (15/2+) state
gives a consistent deformation of 2 > 0.19, while the experimental proton emis-
sion lifetime, of = 24.2(2) s, also gives a consistent deformation of 2 = 0.22
Summary and Conclusions 146
when compared to the theoretical predictions. Aside from providing a measure for
the ground-state deformation of 113Cs, the comparison of theoretical and experi-
mental proton-emission rates has more firmly assigned the ground state of 113Cs
as having a value of K=3/2. This is the only state where the theoretical value
intersects with the experimental value at a deformation which is not near spher-
ical. This is in line with the other predictions of the nonadiabatic quasiparticle
method and earlier predictions of 113Cs as being deformed [13, 14, 17].
The consistency of all of the deformations, calculated using the same set of wave-
functions, underlines the validity of the predictions of the nonadiabatic quasi-
particle method. The consistency of the different deformations also shows that
the nonadiabatic quasiparticle model has successfully included the effects of the
Coriolis interaction, in a way which was not possible for earlier nonadiabatic
approaches [16, 68, 69]. The correct treatment of the Coriolis interaction is an
important development for predictions concerning 113Cs, due to the strong mix-
ing expected between the K=1/2 and K=3/2 orbits which lie close to its Fermi
surface. The inclusion of the rotational spectrum of the daughter nucleus to pro-
vide accurate information on the structure of the core of 113Cs and to account for
nonadiabatic behaviour is also seen to be successful.
The inclusion of an electromagnetic transition rate calculation of the excited
states provided an additional test for the predictions of the model. Additionally,
the sensitivity of -ray transition rates to the deformation of the nucleus provides
a more accurate measurement for the deformation of the nucleus than could be
extracted just from proton-emission rates and excited state energies.
By reducing the error on the lifetimes of the excited states in 113Cs, a smaller range
of deformations may be extracted from the nonadiabatic quasiparticle model.
This would allow the magnitude of small components of the nuclear wavefunction
to be more exactly known. More exact information on the nuclear structure of
deformed proton emitters would then be provided, giving greater insight into the
role of the residual and Coriolis interactions in mixing different components of
the nuclear wavefunction. The errors on the lifetime of the states in this work
are unlikely to be reduced using the same experimental setup as was described
here, so a new setup may be needed to provide more precise measurements. The
new triple foil plunger being developed at the University of Manchester and high-
energy fragmentation facilities may provide a means of reducing the experimental
lifetime errors.
