ABSTRACT 
In carnivorous fish farming industry, there are progressive increase demands for 
the finite resource of fish meal. A potential alternative to fish meal is to use 
legume meals which are free of enzyme inhibitors. In selected underutilised 
legumes the most effective processing method for eliminating trypsin (TIA), 
chymotrypsin (CIA) and -amylase (AIA) inhibitors, without affecting the crude 
protein content, was investigated. These methods included soaking (S), wet 
heating (W), autoclaving (A) and dry freezing (D). No single method was effective 
at removing all the inhibitors. In all legumes tested, the combined processing 
methods which involved A were most effective in reducing CIA and AIA (p<0.05), 
but not TIA. However, in adzuki bean both TIA and CIA were reduced by the D+A 
combined method (p<0.05), whereas AIA of soybean and adzuki bean was 
decreased by combined methods of S+A (84.7 % and 99.3 % reduction 
respectively, p<0.05) or A+D (99.1 % and 72.6 % reduction respectively, p<0.05). 
All the processing methods retained 86.5  90.5 % of crude protein. Replacement 
of 10 % (w/w) of fish meal with D+A treated legume meal (either bambara 
groundnut or adzuki bean) for 28 days showed no significant difference in growth 
performance or inflammatory effects in Danio rerio or Lates calcarifer. Compared 
to Lates calcarifer given feed containing unprocessed adzuki bean meal, those on 
feed containing processed adzuki bean meal had increased hepatic gene 
expression of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01), indicating an enhanced ability to 
utilise amino acids. The project identified specific food processing methods which 
are effective at removing enzyme inhibitors in legumes, thereby facilitating the 
application of legumes as aquafeed ingredients. Future studies are required to 
examine what inclusion level of treated legume meal can promote growth 
performance in specific commercial fish species.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Problem statement 
Declining worldwide ocean fisheries stocks, together with the further expansion of 
human population that will approach 9.7 billion before 2050, are an incentive for 
the further growth of aquaculture (WWF, 2013a; Crab et al., 2007; Hardy, 1999). 
Capture fisheries production has remained stable whilst aquaculture production 
continues to expand from 1995 to the present timeline (FAO, 2016). Asia is the 
worlds largest contributor to world aquaculture and accounts for nearly 90% of the 
global production of freshwater finfish (FAO, 2016; FAO, 2012; Silva and Davy, 
2010). This trend is expected to continue for the next decade.  
Optimistically, aquaculture is a method to augment dwindling fish catches and 
thereby relieve the pressure on ocean fisheries (Deutsch et al., 2007; Naylor et al., 
2000). However, farming high value carnivorous species such as cod, seabass, tuna, 
and salmon, has a devastating effect on wild fish populations. Large amounts of 
wild-caught or trash fish were used as aquafeed for carnivorous fish species 
(WWF, 2013b).  
Typically production of 1 kilogram of these carnivorous species, uses up to 5 
kilograms of wild-caught fish which is processed into fish meal and fish oil before 
being used as feed (Naylor et al., 2000). The production of this type of aquafeed is 
not sustainable and has been widely criticised both for exploitation of the global 
fisheries resources and the misuse of high quality marine food sources that could 
be used directly for human consumption (Hill et al., 2013; Kaushik et al., 2004). 
Therefore to sustain the steady increase in aquaculture production there is 
increasing investigation of substitute protein and oil sources for feeds (Pratoomyot 
et al., 2010).  
Legume are a potential sources to replace fish meal as it has relatively high protein 
content and favourable amino acid profile that fits the requirements of aquafeed 
(Gatlin III et al., 2007). However, legumes also contain anti-nutritional factors 
(ANFs) such as enzyme inhibitors, that affect nutrient digestibility if substantial 
amount is consumed. Commercial legumes such as soybean are used to 
supplement in aquafeed for seabream, rainbow trout, European seabass, Atlantic 
cod, tilapia, and carps (Torrecillas et al., 2017; Colburn et al., 2012; Collins et al., 
2012; Lin and Luo, 2011; Santigosa et al., 2008; Urn et al., 2008; Barrows et al., 
2007).  
Therefore to reduce over-reliance on major crops and to ensure future food 
security a sustainability and effective ANF-free plant-based aquafeed needs to be 
developed. The research described in this thesis sought to develop a processing 
strategy to remove ANFs present in underutilised legumes and investigate the 
effect of these processed legume-based feeds on the growth of zebrafish and Asian 
seabass (Siakap). This introduction describes the legumes that could be 
potentially used as a feed source and the range of anti-nutritional factors that occur 
in these legumes. It then describes processing methods which could be used to 
potentially reduce these factors, and lastly considers the characteristics of the fish 
species that could be used as animal models to assess the effectiveness of 
processing legumes on the biological availability of nutrients in feeds. 
1.2 Aquaculture 
Aquaculture refers to the farming of aquatic organism including finfish, molluscs, 
crustaceans, and aquatic plants in both coastal and inland areas has developed into 
a highly globalised trade-dependent industry (FAO, 2013a). Over the past three 
decades, aquaculture is the worlds fastest growing food sector growing at an 
average annual rate of about 6 % to enhance the production (FAO, 2016; The World 
Bank, 2014). The production now accounts for 50 % of the worlds fish that is used 
for food and it is expected to increase up to 70 % of seafood will be farm-raised in 
2030 (FAO, 2018a; The World Bank, 2014).  
The impressive growth rate in aquaculture industry is cause by the worldwide 
decline of ocean fisheries stocks combined with the increasing demand for fish and 
fish products of a specific type that is preferred by consumers in develop countries 
such as salmon, rainbow trout, cods and tuna (Golden et al., 2016). Today, seafood 
harvest from the oceans is unlikely to increase further as 85 % of the global marine 
stocks are either fully exploited or overfished line (WWF, 2018). Therefore, fish 
farming provides a solution to fill the gap between declining natural production and 
increase market demand for protein source, and thereby contribute to food and 
nutritional security around the globe.  
However, the rapid expanding of farming industry has come with the following 
impacts affecting wild fish populations, marine habitats, water quality and society 
(WWF, 2018): 
a) One-third of the global harvest fish had been made into fish meal and fish 
oil as aquafeed 
b) Using of excessive antibiotics and pesticides could have unintended 
consequences for marine organism and human health 
c) High risk of transferable disease and parasites between farmed and wild 
species when many fish are grown in a confined space 
d) The escaped farmed fish could interbreed with local wild stocks of the same 
population thereby altered the overall genetic diversity pool 
e) Excess food and fish waste causing pollution in the water and lead to 
oxygen-deprived water that eventually threaten the aquatic life 
f) Arising of conflict among the users of the shared coastal environment 
g) Clearing of land for agriculture feed could affects high conservation value 
areas 
Out of these seven impacts, one of the key challenges that arise, in the context of 
sustainable development of aquaculture industry especially in farming carnivorous 
fish, is the misuse of harvested fish that could be used directly for human 
consumption, this being an area that has received the most attention from 
researchers (Hill et al., 2013; Kaushik et al., 2004). The demand for fish meal in 
aquaculture sector has grown from virtually nothing to more than half of total 
production in the past 20 years (Lem et al., 2014). The major concern now is that 
the wild trash fish inputs are larger than farmed fish outputs. This will eventually 
increase pressure on wild fisheries to make the aquafeeds sustainable for farmed 
carnivores.  
1.2.1 Nutritional requirements for various type of cultured fish 
Nutrition plays an important role in intensive aquaculture industry as it not only 
influences the production costs but also the fish health (Gatlin III, 2002). A low-cost 
balanced diet is needed for commercial cultured fish. Protein, lipid, and 
carbohydrate are the major nutrients in fish diet where the body can metabolises 
them to produce energy that needs for numerous physiological processes and 
physical activities (Gatlin III, 2010; AFCD, 2009). It is noteworthy that nutritional 
requirements of fish vary with different species, sizes and feeding habits (AFCD, 
2009).  
Basically, fish can be classified into three category based on their natural feeding 
habits which is herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous (Craig, 2009). As showed 
in Table 1.1, herbivorous and omnivorous species required lesser protein but higher 
carbohydrate than carnivorous species. This is because carnivorous species are very 
efficient at using protein and lipid but limited capacity at using carbohydrate as 
energy (Gatlin III, 2010). The natural feeding habits of fish are believed to correlate 
closely to their digestive system. Herbivorous fish usually have no true stomach 
with long intestine, while omnivorous fish have true stomach with intermediate 
length of intestine, and carnivorous fish have a true stomach with short intestine 
(Smith, 1980). Digestive tract of fish vary from short and simple to complex 
multifunctional reflecting the variation in nutrient sources (Krogdahl et al., 2005; 
Buddington et al., 1997). This physiological characteristic means that fish differ in 
their ability to use the energy-yielding nutrients. Knowledge of the fish digestive 
system and nutrient requirement can help in aquafeed development and therefore 
selecting the most appropriate ingredients to be incorporated into the feed.

in grower size (10  200 g) (AFCD, 2009; Craig, 2009; Lall and Tibbetts, 2009)

1.2.2 Aquafeed for carnivorous fish 
Traditionally, fish meal is one of the key ingredients used in recipes of farm-raised 
carnivorous fish aquafeeds to supply protein for optimal fish performance. Out of 3 
major nutrients, protein is the most expensive component in aquafeed (Bhosalel et 
al., 2010). Of all the protein sources, fish meal is the preferred protein source of 
choice in aquafeeds for several reasons, which include its high protein content, 
excellent amino acid profile, high nutrient digestibility, general lack of anti-
nutritional factors (ANFs), and its wide availability (Gatlin III et al., 2007). In 
aquaculture industry, about 30  50 % of the carnivores aquafeed are made up by 
fish meal which has the consequence of making aquafeed 60  70 % of the total 
operational cost (Barrows et al., 2008; FAO, 2002). 
The growing demand, along with the limits in wild fish catch, have created an 
uncertain market for fish meal with prices rising by almost 300 % in the past 10 
years, which is expected not to revert to lower price levels (Oil, 2014). The world 
price for fish meal ranged between USD 500  700 per tonne between the years of 
2000 to 2005 (FAO, 2018b). Over the last decades, the fish meal price has 
drastically increased and peaked up to USD 1874 per tonne in year 2010 (Figure 
1.1). And the price of fish meal is expected to rise by 90 % over period of 2010 to 
2030 (The World Bank, 2014). In all regions of the world, the increasing price of fish 
meal will directly affect the manufacture price of aquafeed by 20  40 % and result 
in increasing the market price of the fish. Thus, the development of cost-effective 
aquafeeds is relatively important for aquaculture industry expansion.  
Figure 1.1 Commodity prices of main protein sources used in aquafeed (Adapted 
from FAO, 2018b). 
Today, the supply of fish meal from wild harvest of marine stocks and associated 
growth of aquaculture industry is static (Salin et al., 2018). The reliance on trash 
fish to produce fish meal ultimately worsens food security especially in poorer 
countries (FAO, 2012). The limitation in fish meal supply and the consequential 
increased price have led to an increase in the investigations to identify substitute 
animal protein for future aquaculture development. Hence, because of the limited 
availability, fluctuating price, and the growing concerns on the sustainability of fish 
meal, there has been an increasing trend to incorporate plant protein, especially 
soybean, as a substitute for animal protein in aquafeeds.  
Fish meal Soybean Wheat Corn 
1.3 Legume as plant protein source 
1.3.1 Commodity crop  Soybean  
Soybeans has been grown as a commercial crop which account for 69 % of the total 
world production and approximately 90 % of the production is processed and 
crushed into soybean meal and oil for the usage in livestock and aquaculture 
industries whereas the remainder is consumed by human directly as food has 
become a major part of human diets (Salin et al., 2018; Hartman et al., 2011). Over 
the years among the plant protein ingredients, soybean had been used either 
wholly or partially to substitute the fish meal in aquafeed due to its high protein 
(40%) and oil content (20%) not only to circumvent the shortage of fish meal but 
also to enhance the sustainability of aquaculture industry (Egbichi et al., 2014; 
Mahmoud et al., 2014; Rao and Reddy, 2010; Chou et al., 2004; Dersjant-li, 2002; 
Refstie et al., 1998; Dabrowski et al., 1989).  
Unfortunately, with the anticipated growth in livestock and aquaculture industries a 
shortage in soybean meal production is being predicted by 2020 (Wilson, 2008). 
This is because soybean meal is probably one of the most promising plant based 
protein used in livestock and aquaculture as feed in the world, despite its high price 
(Florou-Paneri et al., 2014). However, the reliance of soybean in animal feed raises 
sustainability issues in terms of both economically and environmental (Lee et al., 
2016).  
As indicated in section 1.2.2, production cost of aquafeed is one of the key aspects 
that will be considered when substituting fish meal by soybean. However, for the 
past two decades the world price of soybean has driven up more than 70 %. The 
world prices for soybean was ranged between USD 180  200 per tonne during the 
years 2000 to 2005, whereas between the years of 2006 to 2018 the price ranged 
from USD 200 to 620 per tonne (Figure 1.1). The factors that contribute to the 
escalating of soybean price is not only the increasing demand of soybean for feed 
and food but also the fluctuation in production shortfalls due to climate change, 
global warming, scarcity of land and water, disease outbreaks, regional conflicts, 
and instabilities, as well as slow global economy growth rate (Salin et al., 2018; 
USDA, 2009).  
Environmentally, the main impact from farming soybean comes from clearing 
natural habitats, thereby threating forests and other natural ecosystems (Tim and 
Hassan, 2009). According to WWF (2017), in recent decades, millions of hectares of 
forest, savannah and grassland have been converted into soybean plantations, 
which has threated the biodiversity, depleted ecosystems services and emitted vast 
amounts of carbon dioxide. Deforestation has contributed to climate change, it is 
responsible for about 15 % of all the global greenhouse gas emissions caused by 
people (WWF, 2017; Lee et al., 2016). The ongoing climate change could cut crop 
yields by more than 25 % and may impact the local food security (Iizumi and 
Ramankutty, 2015).  
A key strategy required in order to adapt to a changing climate is to look for 
alternative plant protein sources that can used in aquafeed. Ideally these should be 
innovative resources, such as underutilised legumes, a these not only do not 
compete with existing sources used in aquaculture feed but also to mitigate the 
harmful impacts of aquaculture in long-term growth. Besides, in an attempt to 
solve problems of food security; an alternative plant based protein is essential to 
reduce the competition of soybean that used for human and animal diets since 
soybean wasnt the only potential plant based protein (USDA, 2018; Florou-Paneri 
et al., 2014). 
1.3.2 Underutilised legumes 
Legumes have been widely recognised as an important source of protein, as well as 
containing significant amounts of carbohydrates, lipids, crude fibre, minerals and 
vitamins in developing countries (Rehman and Shah, 2005; Alonso et al., 2000; 
Kataria et al., 1989). Apart from the commercial or major legume such as soybean 
and groundnut, there are a variety of underutilised legumes such as mung bean, 
adzuki bean, chickpea, hyacinth bean, rice bean, winged bean, marama bean, and 
bambara groundnut that have recently gained attention as nutritious pulses (Ebert, 
2014; Katoch, 2013).  
Underutilised legumes are considered as minor crops as they are less important 
than staple crops and agricultural commodities in terms of regional or global 
production and market value. Underutilised legumes have the potential to play a 
role in reducing the risk of over-reliance on very limited numbers of major crops 
(Mayes et al., 2011). Globally, only 7000 out of 30,000 edible crops are being 
cultivated and less than 150 have been commercialised. It is estimated around 
10,000 crops remain underutilised (Chivenge et al., 2015). Legumes solely have 
about 30 species are cultivated and only a few of them are widely grown across the 
continents (Gowda et al., 2007). Only 9 major crops including wheat, rice, maize, 
sorghum, millet, potatoes, sweet potatoes, soybeans and sugar (cane or beet) 
provided 75 % of the global plant-derived energy and estimated that approximately 
95 % of the worlds dietary energy comes solely from 30 crops (Kristof and Stacia, 
2017).  
The prime concern in cultivation of major crops have declined and continue to 
decline globally, even these crops offer greater genetic biodiversity but it is 
probably unsustainable in the long run due to global climate change (Chivenge et 
al., 2015; Ebert, 2014). An added pressure is worlds population is switching from 
animal-based protein diet to plant-based protein diet (Meyer and Reguant-Closa, 
2017; Kumar et al., 2010; FAO, 2003). This trend has created the demand for food 
legumes that exceeds the production as only a few legumes are traded in the global 
market (Bhat and Karim, 2009; Gowda et al., 2007).  
In this regard, underutilised legumes have been highlighted as an alternative to 
major commodity crops to meet the food legumes demand with several 
advantages. Underutilised legumes are cheap and able to adapt to a wide range of 
environment that contributed to agricultural sustainability with a relatively low 
input (Padulosi et al., 2013; Polok et al., 2008). They are able to withstand adverse 
environmental conditions and can thrive under extreme stress conditions such as 
droughts, floods, cyclone and heat waves (Bhat and Karim, 2009). Many of these 
species are maintained by poor farming communities under marginal environments 
such as high mountains, desert margins and poor soils (Padulosi et al., 1999). These 
attributes make underutilised legumes worthy of investigation. In the future these 
crops could be used to help improve the current agriculture systems by providing 
genetic traits allow adaptation to the environment but also strengthen the 
resilience of agroecosystems through crop diversification (Padulosi et al., 2011; 
Padulosi et al., 1999). Thus, they have the potential to contribute in food and 
nutrition security, especially if the removal of enzyme inhibitors can increase the 
utilisation of nutrients such as protein.  
1.3.3 Types of underutilised legumes 
In this study, seven underutilised legumes, namely mung bean (Vigna radiate L.), 
adzuki bean (Phaseolus angularis), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), hyacinth bean 
(Lablab purpureus L.), black-eyed pea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus 
cajan L.) and bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranean L.) were investigated as 
alternatives to replace major legumes as feed ingredients. These underutilised 
legumes have comparable amounts of protein (20  37 %) carbohydrate (40  
60 %), minerals, dietary fibre, vitamins to major legumes. The macronutrient 
contents included protein, carbohydrate and fat of these underutilised legumes had 
summarised in Table 1.2. The above mentioned legumes except adzuki bean had 
been used as livestock feed for many years (Department of Agriculture and 
Fisheries (The State of Queensland), 2012; Abeke et al., 2008; Teguia and Beynen, 
2005; Aganga et al., 2000). Even so, to-date the research on using these 
underutilised legumes as potential aquafeed ingredient is scarce.  
a) Mung bean 
Mung bean (Vigna radiate L.) (Figure 1.2 A), also known green bean, is one of the 
important warm season crops which native to the North-eastern India-Burma 
(Myanmar) region of Asia (Keatinge et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2008). It contains 27 % 
(w/w) of protein, 60 % (w/w) of carbohydrate and 1  2 % (w/w) of fat with a range 
of micronutrients (Butt and Batool, 2010; Mubarak, 2005; Kataria and Chauhan, 
1988; Kataria et al., 1988). Aside from its use as bean sprout, mung bean is also 
processed into noodles (Maneepun, 2003; Hoover et al., 1997). In the Philippines 
mung bean is boiled and utilised in native desserts such as hopia, butse-butse and 
halo-halo (Barroga et al., 1985). 
b) Adzuki bean  
Adzuki bean (Phaseolus angularis) (Figure 1.2 B) also known as small red bean is 
smooth and shiny in maroon colour with white hilum and is a popular ingredient in 
many confections in the Orient (Takahama et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2010; Sacks 
Frank, 1977). It is a rich source of carbohydrate (60  70 % (w/w)), protein (21  
24 % (w/w)) and a range of micronutrients (such as minerals, vitamins) (Yousif et 
al., 2007; Tjahjadi et al., 1988). It can be cooked and consumed in paste form or 
whole bean is boiled and sweetened that is used in desserts, snacks and 
confectionery items (Yousif et al., 2007; Yousif et al., 2003; Yousif et al., 2002). In 
China, red bean is used as soup ingredients for therapeutic purposes such as driving 
away dropsy, relieving diarrhoea and tonic to the viscera (Meng and Ma, 2001; 
Chau and Cheung, 1997).  
c) Chickpea 
Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) (Figure 1.2 C) is being cultivated throughout the world 
including Asia, West Asia, North Africa, East Africa, Southern Europe, North and 
South America and Australia (Noor et al., 2003; Singh, 1997). It is an ancient legume 
believed to have originated in south-eastern Turkey and the adjoining part of Syria 
(Sreerama et al., 2010). Chickpea has been divided into two groups macrosperma 
or kalibu and mircosperma or desi (Toker et al., 2012). Kalibu chickpea 
seeds are large in size, have a thin salmon-white colour seed coat and is usually 
grown in temperate regions of the world. The desi chickpea seeds are smaller, 
with dark colour seed coat are grown on semi-arid land (Toker et al., 2012; Roy et 
al., 2010; Alajaji and El-Adawy, 2006; El-Adawy, 2002). Both types of chickpeas 
appearance is beaked, often angular and wrinkled on the seed surface (Singh, 
1997).  
Chickpea contains high levels of carbohydrate (47 % (w/w)) and protein (22 % 
(w/w)) (Alajaji and El-Adawy, 2006; El-Adawy, 2002). Chickpea and its flour 
(garbanzo flour or besan) is used extensively in food processing due to its ideal 
polysaccharides composition and high content of oil (Sreerama et al., 2012). In 
South and Southeast Asian cuisines, chickpeas are served as a staple ingredient. 
Chickpea flour is the main ingredient in many Indian sweets, desserts, and savoury 
products. French and Italian cuisines also use it to make variety of desserts, 
noodles, snacks and main dishes (Alajaji and El-Adawy, 2006).  
d) Hyacinth bean 
Hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus L.) (Figure 1.2 D) previously classified as Dolichos 
lablab is one of the lesser known tropical and subtropical legumes (Murphy and 
Colucci, 1999; Akpapunam, 1996). It is an ancient crop widely distributed in the 
tropics particularly in India and Southeast Asia, Egypt and Sudan (Lim, 2012; Maass, 
2006). Hyacinth bean has many local names such as lablab, bonavist, Chinese 
flowering, Egyptian, Pharao, shink, val, wild field and Indian bean (USDA, 2012). The 
hyacinth bean exists in two very distinctive forms, one with deeply pigmented 
flowers, stems and foliage is a popular ornamental vine, whereas the common 
pulse form has white flowers and unpigmented stems and foliage (Akpapunam, 
1996). The green seed of hyacinth bean will either turn into dark brown, black or 
pale tan or white, often speckled (Lim, 2012).  
Hyacinth bean considered as non-oilseed legumes as it contained only 1  2 % 
(w/w) of fat with 20  28 % (w/w) of protein, 53 % (w/w) of carbohydrate and large 
amount of various vitamins and minerals (Lim, 2012). After soaking in water 
overnight the dry hyacinth beans are cooked together with rice for a protein 
supply. It also used as raw material for tempeh, an Indonesian traditional 
fermented food that commonly made from soybeans (Subagio, 2006). It is eaten as 
a vegetable in Southeast Asia, whereas in India it is predominantly used as a pulse 
often as dhal (Lim, 2012).  
e) Black-eyed pea 
Black-eyed pea (Vigna unguiculata L.) (Figure 1.2 E) also known as cowpea is an 
underutilised legume in United States that has been consumed extensively in 
Africa, and to lesser extent in Asia (Sreerama et al., 2012; Halln et al., 2004). It has 
a creamy skin with black dot and is medium oval in shape (Geil and Anderson, 
1994). It is underutilised partly because changes with storage means it has to have 
a prolonged cooking time, and the presence of ANFs (Prinyawiwatkul et al., 1997; 
Prinyawiwatkul, 1996).  
Black-eyed pea is high in protein (18  35 % (w/w)) and consists of 50  60 % (w/w) 
of carbohydrate content and low in fat content (1  2 % (w/w)) that contain no 
cholesterol make it a potentially important nutritional component (Butt and Batool, 
2010; Halln et al., 2004; Ragab et al., 2004). They are often consumed alone in 
fried name akara or as steamed bean cakes name moin-moin in Nigeria (Carvalho et 
al., 2017; Onimawo et al., 2007; Giami, 1993; Kochhar et al., 1988). 
f) Pigeon pea 
Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) (Figure 1.2 F) is one of the oldest food crops grown 
and consumed in the tropics and semi-arid tropics but is underutilised (Maninder et 
al., 2007). It is also known as red gram, yellow dhal, Angola pea and Congo pea 
(Kaushal et al., 2012; Saxena et al., 2002). India alone contributes over 90 % of the 
world pigeon pea production and it is becoming popular in several countries of 
Africa, Southeast Asia, Carribbean and Latin America (Torres et al., 2007; Agunbiade 
and Longe, 1999). Pigeon pea is rich in protein (22 % (w/w)), carbohydrate (60 % 
(w/w)) (Tiwari et al., 2011; Saxena et al., 2002). It possesses low concentration of 
fat (1  2 % (w/w)), moderate amount of fibre, starch and a reasonably balanced 
range of all dietary essential minerals (Tiwari et al., 2011; Torres et al., 2007). In 
Ethiopia, not only pods but also young shoots and leaves are cooked and eaten. 
Whereas in India, dehusked split pigeon pea is consumed after boiling to make dhal 
(Liu et al., 2010; Hoover et al., 1993).  
g) Bambara groundnut 
Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranean L.) (Figure 1.2 G) is an indigenous African 
crop that produced 330,000 tonnes annually even under conditions of drought and 
low soil fertility (FAO, 2015; Linnemann, 1991). Similar to groundnut, the pods and 
seeds are formed on or just below the soil surface (Bamshaiye et al., 2011; 
Swanevelder, 1998). Their seeds are various colours from white to cream, red, black 
or brown and sometime mottled depending on the ripeness (Umar and Turaki, 
2014). Bambara groundnut is a rich source of carbohydrate (49  63 % (w/w)), 
protein (16  25 % (w/w)), fat (4.5  7.4 % (w/w)) which is comparable to soybean 
(Murevanhema and Jideani, 2013; Mkandawire, 2007). People consumed bambara 
groundnut in numerous forms including fresh when it is semi-ripen as snacks and 
the mature seeds are cooked or grounded into flour (Umar and Turaki, 2014; 
Mkandawire, 2007).

1.4 Anti-nutritional factors present in legumes 
Although legumes are rich in nutrients, they also contain a range of anti-nutritional 
factors (ANFs) such as enzyme inhibitors, phytic acid, saponins, lectins, tannins and 
cyanogens. ANFs are defined as substances generated through metabolism that 
adversely affect the nutritional value in living systems by interfering with food 
utilisation (Novak and Haslberger, 2000; Kumar, 1992). Generally ANFs could be 
divided into four groups (Bora, 2014; Onder and Kahraman, 2009; Francis et al., 
2001):  
a) Factors affecting protein utilisation and digestion such as protease 
inhibitors, tannins, lectins 
b) Factors affecting mineral utilisation such as phytic acid, gossypol pigments, 
oxalates, glucosinolates 
c) Antivitamins such as dihydroxyphenyl alanine (DOPA)  
d) Miscellaneous substances such as mycotoxins, mimosine, cyanogens, 
nitrate, alkaloids, photosensitizing agents, phytoestrogens, saponins 
ANFs in plant-based aquafeed ingredients remain a concern as less is known about 
the exact response of fish to these compounds (Hajra et al., 2013). Studies by 
Krogdahl et al. (2010) and Francis et al. (2001) showed that the presence of ANFs 
can limit the protein utilisation in fish thereby affecting their growth rate as protein 
is not only essential for fish to grow but also for energy and life support.  
1.4.1 Protease inhibitors 
Protease inhibitors such as trypsin inhibitors and chymotrypsin inhibitors which 
have the serine group are found in abundance in raw legumes (Krogdahl et al., 
2010; Shahidi, 1997; Thompson, 1993; Van Der Poel, 1990). These protease 
inhibitors are proteins that form stoichiometric protease-inhibitor complexes with 
their respective enzymes and inhibit their activity in gastrointestinal tract. They will 
bind to the digestive enzyme either through the action of competitive or allosteric 
to render the enzyme inactivation (Glencross, 2015). 
Traditionally, trypsin inhibitors are categorised into two groups Kunitz (KTI) and 
Bowman-Birk (BBI). KTI is a single headed inhibitor that binds to one enzyme 
molecule per inhibitor. The inhibitory site of KTI mainly inhibits trypsin with little 
inhibition on chymotrypsin. They are generally absent from Phaseolus, Pisum and 
Vigna species but they are found in soybeans and winged beans (Deshpande, 2005).  
The BBI can simultaneously inhibit both trypsin and chymotrypsin as it contains two 
independent inhibitory binding sites (Chen et al., 2014; Sessa and Wolf, 2001). As 
shown in Figure 1.3, the BBI inhibitors are a stabilise polypepetide which makes it 
relatively stable to proteolytic breakdown, acid denaturation as well as heat, which 
has a significant impact on the protein digestion in the intestine (Krogdahl et al., 
2010). Unlike trypsin inhibitors, chymotrypsin inhibitors have not been well 
categorised.  
Figure 1.3 Bowman-Birk inhibitor structure from soybean. The amino acids 
interacting with trypsin (ser-lys) and chymotrypsin (leu-ser) are marked in grey and 
seven cysteine bridges are shown in black (Adapted with permission from Krogdahl 
et al., 2010; license number: 4203270327989) 
The presence of chymotrypsin inhibitors in animal diets will cause indigestion and 
abdominal pain, whilst pancreatic enlargement and growth depression are caused 
by the presence of trypsin inhibitors (Kumar et al., 2013). The pancreatic 
enlargement (hypertrophy and hyperplasia) is because trypsin inhibitors suppress 
the negative feedback regulation of pancreatic secretions through an increased 
release of hormone cholecystokinin from intestinal mucosa. The hyper-secretion of 
pancreatic digestive enzyme leads to a loss of sulphur rich endogenous proteins 
(methionine and cysteine). As legume seed proteins are generally deficient in 
sulphur amino acids, the combination of the ANF effect and the quality of the 
protein in the legumes can then lead to depressed growth and contribute to the 
loss in body weight (Jezierny et al., 2010; Guillamn et al., 2008; Shahidi, 1997; 
Thompson, 1993). The effect of these inhibitors on pancreatic enlargement has 
been observed in pigs, chicks and rats when fed with legumes (Jezierny et al., 2010; 
Clarke and Wiseman, 2005; Tavano and Incio, 2005). It is expected the same 
phenomenon will be present in humans and fish and which could potentially lead to 
the onset of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in high legumes consumption. The 
elevation of cholecystokinin produces a chronic trophic stimulus to pancreas that 
leads to the formation of pancreatic nodules and adenomas (Hatcock, 1991). 
1.4.2 -Amylase inhibitor 
Similar to trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors, -amylase inhibitors are widely 
distributed in legumes (Pusztai et al., 2004). -amylase inhibitors from legumes do 
not inhibit plant, fungal or bacterial -amylase activity but do affect isoforms found 
in mammals and some insects (Yamada et al., 2001). In total, there are seven types 
of proteinaceous -amylase inhibitors found in nature. But only 1 type of -amylase 
inhibitor namely legume lectin-like (isoform -AI1) is widely distributed in legumes 
and has the anti-amylase activity in humans (Cuthbert Obiro et al., 2008; Svensson 
et al., 2004). -AI1 will bind to the human and porcine pancreatic amylases through 
the action of mixed non-competitive inhibition mechanism (Santimone et al., 2004; 
Le Berre-Anton et al., 1997). 
The inhibition activity of -amylase has been categorised as ANF for human and 
livestock. Complex formation of -amylase inhibitors with -amylases cause 
reduction in starch digestion by inhibiting the hydrolysis of  -1,4-glycosidic bonds 
of starch (Singh et al., 2010). Therefore presence of legume -amylase inhibitor in 
human diet can cause impaired carbohydrate digestion and coeliac disease, leading 
to weight loss (Kumar et al., 2013; Rekha and Padmaja, 2002).

1.5 Effect of ANFs on fish 
In fish, the nutrient absorption is known to take place in pyloric caeca and anterior 
intestine; and to a lesser extend in posterior intestine (Prez-Jimnez et al., 2009). 
The pyloric caeca is finger-like organ that located near the junction of stomach and 
anterior intestine that responsible for the pancreatic enzymes secretion in response 
to the presence of nutrients in intestine lumen (Gulf and Science, 2015; Prez-
Jimnez et al., 2009; Einarsson et al., 1997; Liddle, 1997; Singer, 1993).  
With the presence of ANFs in plant-based meal, these anti-nutrients might affect 
the nutrient absorption in fish and cause detrimental effects to the fish health. The 
presence of ANFs in aquafeed might alter the nutrient balances of the diets, reduce 
the palatability and bioavailability of nutrients for absorption by fish. When ANFs 
are in excess, it could cause inhibition of growth, intestinal dysfunction, altered gut 
microflora, modulation of immune responses, goitrogenesis, pancreatic 
hypertrophy, hypoglycaemia and liver damage in fish (Krogdahl et al., 2010). It had 
been reported that the high value marine cultured finfish including flounders, 
turbot, seabass, rainbow trout, salmonids, and seabream are particularly sensitive 
to the nutrient quality of the ANFs present in plant-based meal (Gouveia and 
Davies, 2000). The ANFs in plant-based meal lead to histological alteration in 
salmonids and seabream intestines along with impair intestinal absorption 
(Santigosa et al., 2008; Baeverfjord and Krogdahl, 1996).  
The presence of protease inhibitors could reduce the proteolytic enzymes activity 
that are secreted into the intestine lumen and result in reduction of protein 
digestibility that ultimately lead to poor fish performance and growth (Alarcn et 
al., 2001; Moyano Lpez et al., 1999). In addition, the binding of protease inhibitors 
to the proteases will suppress the signal that responsible to stop the pancreatic 
enzymes secretion and stimulate the pyloric caeca or pancreas to secrete larger 
amounts of digestive enzymes to overcome the inhibitors and digest the feed 
protein (Savoie et al., 2011; Alarcn et al., 2001). The elevation of pancreatic 
enzymes could lead to pancreatic enlargement and this had been observed in pigs, 
chicks and rats when fed with legumes (Jezierny et al., 2010; Clarke and Wiseman, 
2005; Tavano and Incio, 2005). 
Unlike mammals, the mechanism of inhibition of protease inhibitors has been 
extensively studied whilst the mechanisms of response in fish to protease inhibitors 
is limited in term of pancreatic enlargement. This is because the pancreas of 
carnivores fish consists of scattered pancreatic cells in the mesenteric adipose 
tissue between the pyloric caeca thus the pancreas size could be hardly determined 
(Olli et al., 1994).  
Krogdahl et al. (2010) and Francis et al. (2001) reported than the presence of 
protease inhibitors at more than 5 mg/g in aquafeed may reduce the protein 
digestibility and utilisation in most of the cultured fish since the protease inhibitors 
decrease the proteolytic activity in the chyme of the mid-intestine. However, 
evidence has also shown low levels of trypsin inhibitor activity (less than 3 mg/g) 
and oligosaccharide content (up to 16 %) in soybean meal had no apparent adverse 
effect on protein digestibility and growth performance in rainbow trout and 
European seabass (Tibaldi et al., 2006; Kaushik et al., 1995). 
1.6 Effect of processing methods on ANFs and protein content 
Recent years, the growing interest in the usage of legume protein for incorporation 
into food and feed applications has spurred research into how the processing 
methods affect the nutrient, particularly protein and ANFs content. Published 
findings suggested that the application of some adequate and economic 
technologies that aimed to reduce or eliminate the ANFs present in legumes could 
improve the legume nutritional value (Cowieson, 2005; Mubarak, 2005; Vidal-
Valverde et al., 1998). The ANFs level of reduction differs with the variety of 
legume, the type of ANFs present in the legume, as well as the processing methods 
applied to the legume.   
Several legume processing methods, such as dehulling, soaking, heat treatment, 
germination, fermentation, and enzymatic processing with different operation 
parameters are commonly applied attempt to increase the legume utilisation. 
Among the macronutrients protein is the major component of legumes, the 
increasing level of protein and reducing of ANFs had been noticed after the 
processed (Table 1.3). The maximum protein increment was observed in dehulled 
chickpea (18.8 %) followed by fermented mucuna bean and locust bean (17.8 % and 
17.7 % respectively) and roasted kidney pea (17.1 %). Caution needs to be exercised 
when resorting to processing methods to avoid any unintended adverse effects on 
the nutritional quality of the legumes.  
Other than processing methods, there are factors affecting the levels of nutrient 
and ANFs in raw legumes. They are much dependent upon genotype, the 
environment including soil pH, weather and climate, the growth location and year 
and may vary within legumes of the same species, seed maturity, fertilizer 
applications, cultural management practices as well as postharvest handling and 
storage (Shi et al., 2007; Hornick, 1992). In addition, the enhancement of nutrients 
with the removal of ANFs can be done through breeding and biotechnological 
method such as genetic modifications that have been achieved through the 
insertion of genes encoding entire metabolic pathways or through targeted 
alternations in existing pathways (Khokhar and Apenten, 2011; Kok and Kuiper, 
2003).  
1.6.1 Dehulling 
Dehulling is one of the widely used mechanical processing that applies to legumes. 
Often the seed coat (hull) of legumes are indigestible and may have a bitter taste 
often caused by that contributed by tannins (Pal et al., 2017). Dehulling has been 
reported to increase the palatability and taste of various legumes (Wang et al., 
2009; Van Der Poel et al., 1991). Out of various types ANFs, tannin is one of the 
ANFs that can be eliminated efficiently (reduced up to 70 %) by using dehulling 
process (Khokhar and Apenten, 2011). This is because tannin is mainly located in 
the seed coat. Besides, the tannin contents are closely associated with the colour of 
seed coat (Punia et al., 2000). The deeper the colour of the seed coats the higher 
the tannins content (Igwenyi et al., 2013). Published studies indicated that dehulled 
green gram, cowpea, black bean and chickpea had reduced tannin ranged from 
19.9  43.4 % with improved protein content ranged from 7.3  18.8 % (Akinjayeju 
and Ajayi, 2011; Ghavidel and Prakash, 2007; Egounlety and Aworh, 2003).   
Almost all the phytic acid was located in the cotyledons instead of seed coat (Ariza-
Nieto et al., 2007). However, published literatures (Table 1.3) showed that the 
reduction of phytic acid for green gram, cowpea, black bean and chickpea was up to 
50 % may be attributed to the removal seed coat (Malunga et al., 2012). 
1.6.2 Soaking 
Soaking has been defined as the preliminary step prior to cooking. Soaking involves 
in immersing legume kernels in water, thereby moistening them and dissolving 
soluble nutrients. The process of soaking legumes in water produces a swelling of 
tissue and water uptake without cell separation (Eyaru et al., 2009). Soaking can be 
performed by using different soaking temperature, soaking time period, 
composition of soaking solution (water, acidic or basic) which could affect the ANFs 
of legumes. Studies showed that the quantity of phytic acid, tannins and enzyme 
inhibitors had reduced although there was not a complete removal in legumes 
(Table 1.3) regardless the soaking solution, soaking time period or soaking 
temperature.  
Tannin was able to eliminate better compared to enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid 
in the soaking process, this is because tannin is a water-soluble phenolic compound 
that make it stand out from the other 2 types of ANFs (Bhat et al., 2013; Kumar, 
1992). The reduction might be due to the ANF components having leached into the 
soaking water. Besides, soaking could also enhance the hydrolysis of 
oligosaccharides into fructose, glucose, and galactose in the soaking legumes 
(Khattab and Arntfield, 2009).  
Soaking also able to increase the protein content of legumes as reported by Wang 
et al. (2008), Alonso et al. (2000) and El-Adawy et al. (2000). They stated that the 
kidney bean, lupin, and field pea soaked for 12 h, 13 h and 24 h had increased 
0.63 %, 2.3 % and 2.6 % respectively may be attributed to the loss of soluble solids 
during soaking.  
1.6.3 Heat treatment 
Heat treatment is the most frequent method used to remove the proteinaceous 
ANFs (such as protease inhibitors and lectins) leading to irreversible protein 
denaturation (Shimelis and Rakshit, 2007). ANFs such as protease inhibitors and 
lectins are heat sensitive. The common heat treatment methods such as boiling, 
autoclaving, microwave cooking, roasting, blanching and extrusion could potentially 
decrease trypsin inhibitor activity, chymotrypsin inhibitor activity, -amylase 
inhibitor activity, oligosaccharides, phytic acids and lectins to a considerable extent 
in legumes (Table 1.3) (Olawepo et al., 2014; El-sayed, 2011; Hefnawy, 2011; 
Shimelis and Rakshit, 2007; Martn-Cabrejas et al., 2004; Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 
2003; Egounlety and Aworh, 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2002; Adeparusi, 2001; Kataria et 
al., 1988).  
Heat processing could also partially reduce phytic acid to petaphosphates and 
tetraphophates (Marzo et al., 1998). However, this process is not very efficient 
because phytic acid is a heat stable component that is not easily degraded using 
thermal processing (Kumar et al., 2010). Thermal processing of raw pigeon pea, 
chickpea, black gram and green gram brought about a 70 % decrease in their tannin 
contents (Rao and Deosthale, 1982). Pugalenthi et al. (2006) and Vijayakumari et al. 
(1996) working on in Canavalia and Mucuna monosperma seeds. Demonstrated the 
contents of oligosaccharides decrease when subjected to thermal treatment, this 
might be attributable to heat hydrolysis of oligosaccharides to simple 
monosaccharide. 
Processing methods such as heat treatment, solvent extraction, flaking and grinding 
showed improvement in nutritional value of plant-based meal in carnivorous fish 
(rainbow trout and salmon) and omnivorous fish (tilapia, carp, and catfish). Heat 
treatment of raw pea seed meal and raw African yam bean improved the meal 
quality, which was associated with a great reduction in ANFs, particularly trypsin 
inhibitors, which then showed better growth performances in African catfish 
(Ogunji et al., 2016; Davies and Gouveia, 2008).  
Besides, the heat treatment process could increase the protein content slightly in 
faba bean, jack bean and kidney bean in the studies of Olanipekun et al. (2015), 
Agbede and Aletor (2005) and Alonso et al. (2000). Their studies reported that 
extruded of faba bean, autoclaved of jack bean and roasted of kidney bean could 
increase the protein content by 0.22 %, 3.4 % and 17.1 % respectively. This could be 
due to the break down the crude protein by unfolding the protein secondary, 
tertiary and quaternary structures to give primary structure which an apparent 
increase in crude protein content and potentially increases its digestibility (Awuah 
et al., 2007). 
1.6.4 Germination 
Germination is one of the most simple, common, popular and effective method in 
Asia which results in the reduction of phytic acid, tannin, trypsin inhibitor, 
chymotrypsin inhibitor, -amylase inhibitor and augmenting the levels of protein, 
carbohydrates, dietary fibre and other components (Bora, 2014). During the 
germination process of legume, several endogenous enzymes become active with 
the intention of degradation of proteinaceous ANFs (Savelkoul et al., 1992). 
The decreased in protease inhibitors content is due to the proteolytic activity that 
degrades the inhibitors during germination (Domash et al., 2008; McGrain et al., 
1989). Germination will also increase the endogenous phytase activity might lead to 
the breakdown of phytic acid (Egli et al., 2002). Ghavidel and Prakash (2007) 
reported that the phytic acid and tannin of green gram, cowpea, chickpea, and 
lentil were reduced up to 20 % and 18 % respectively after 1 day of germination. 
Whereas Aguilera et al. (2013) and Sathe et al. (1983) reported that trypsin, 
chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitory activities were reduced up to 78 %, 73 % 
and 67 % respectively after 4 to 5 days of germination in Phaseolus vulgaris, Vigna 
unguiculata L., Canavalia ensiformis L., Lablab purpureus L. and Stizolobium niveum 
L. These studies showed that a prolonged germination of legumes could lead to a 
significant reduction of enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid.  
Several studies showed that germination of bambara groundnut, mucuna bean, 
cowpea and soybean had increased the protein content from 1.2 % to 13.2 % (Joshi 
and Varma, 2016; Devi et al., 2015; Mugendi et al., 2010; Agbede and Aletor, 2005). 
The increment might due to the synthesis of enzyme proteins or a compositional 
change following by the degradation of other seed constituents (Bau et al., 1997).  
1.6.5 Fermentation 
Fermentation is a common practice in Africa and Southeast Asia countries that 
believed to enhance the flavour, texture, taste and nutritional value of fermented 
foods in addition to increasing shelf life (Mohammed et al., 2017; Annor et al., 
2014). Fermentation is a process carried out by fungi or bacteria which has the 
effect of declining of lectins, tannins, oligosaccharides (stachyose and raffinose), 
phytic acid and protease inhibitors, hydrolysing these complex stored proteins into 
simpler and more soluble available products (Annor et al., 2014; Martn-Cabrejas et 
al., 2004; Ibrahim et al., 2002). Through fermentation, the concentration of tannin, 
phytate, trypsin inhibitor activity and saponin in Phaseolus vulgaris L. were reduced 
up to 46 %, 100 %, 52 % and 60 % respectively after 4 days (Shimelis and Rakshit, 
2008). 
Fermentation process are capable to increase the protein content of bambara 
groundnut, yam bean seed, locust bean and mucuna bean for 2.4 %, 13.9 %, 17.7 % 
and 17.8 % respectively. The observation in protein increment might due to the 
action of extracellular enzymes produced by the fermenting microorganism 
through synthesis of new proteins during fermentation (Enujiugha, 2003; Akubor 
and Chukwu, 1999).  
1.6.6 Enzymatic processing 
The difference of between fermentation and enzymatic processing is fermentation 
utilises the endogenous activities of micro-organism borne on or inside the seeds, 
whilst the latter is the process of adding commercial exogenous enzymes that have 
isolated and cultured from fungi or bacteria (Shimelis and Rakshit, 2008). Belewu 
and Sam (2010) showed that the trypsin inhibitor, lectin, saponin and phytic acid of 
Aspergillus niger (fungus) treated Jatropha curcas seed were reduced by 68 %, 
78 %, 95 % and 70 % respectively after for 7 days. The reduction of oligosaccharides 
in Canavalia using enzymatic processing by adding -galactosidase treatment 
ranged from 67 % to 91 % (Pugalenthi et al., 2006). The action of the enzyme is to 
convert oligosaccharides to monosaccharide and disaccharides by cleaving the -
galactosidic linkage between the sugar molecules (Somiari and Balogh, 1993).

1.7 Plant-based aquafeeds 
Over the last few decades, researchers had made many efforts in replacing portions 
of fish meal in aquafeeds with alternative plant protein source. Plant protein 
sources are attractive potential feed ingredient sources as they are more likely to 
be sustainable, less costly and abundant than other ingredients (Liu et al., 2015). 
Naylor et al. (2000) stated that herbivorous and omnivorous freshwater fish utilise 
plant-based proteins and oils better than carnivorous marine fish as they require 
minimal quantities of fish meal to supply essential amino acids. Still, it is possible to 
replace the fish meal to plant-based fish feed for carnivorous fish. The replacement 
of fish meal in all carnivores species including salmon, trout, seabream and seabass 
has increased from 25 % to 90 % depending on species (Glencross et al., 2016; 
Hardy, 2010).  
A wide variety of legumes including soybean, canola seed, rape seed, pea, mung 
bean, lupin, and broad bean have been investigated as alternative plant protein 
sources in aquafeed (Hernndez and Roman, 2016; Jane et al., 2015; Collins et al., 
2012; Gaber, 2006; Tibaldi et al., 2006; Kaushik et al., 2004; Boonyaratpalin et al., 
1998). The growth performance of these carnivorous fish is slightly low due to poor 
plant-based feed intake (Panserat et al., 2009; Sitj-Bobadillaa et al., 2005; Kaushik 
et al., 2004; Raso and Anderson, 2003).  
1.8 Animal models 
In the current study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was first selected as a fish model to 
investigate on the effect of processed plant-based aquafeed before feed was 
investigated in commercially cultured fish  Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). 
Zebrafish and Asian seabass are two different types of fish which are omnivore and 
carnivore respectively according to their natural feeding habits. Undeniable 
zebrafish is not a perfect fish model fish model due to the structural difference in 
digestive system. Zebrafish has long intestine without true stomach whilst Asian 
seabass has a true stomach with short intestine.  
Even so, zebrafish is an established fish model which offers several benefits 
including ease in handling for breeding and experimentation due to its small size 
and short generation time, substantial genomic resources, as well as the ability to 
consume of a wide variety of food (Ribas and Piferrer, 2014; Ulloa et al., 2014). 
Despite the fact of structural difference in digestive system, zebrafish still serve as a 
potential and reliable model organism in finfish aquaculture research to study the 
nutritional impact of alternative protein source. Zebrafish offers an opportunity to 
conduct the nutritional research at reduced cost, time, and space needed in 
research facilities (Rurangwa et al., 2015). Besides, to fully understand the 
repercussion of new diets on fish physiology, the determination of molecular 
mechanisms fish in responses to different diets also provide some insights to solve 
the existing problems cause by the nutrition interventions in aquaculture industry; 
but does not replace the commercial species of interest that has its own 
gastrointestinal tract characteristic (Rurangwa et al., 2015; Ulloa et al., 2014).  
1.8.1 Zebrafish 
Compare to other fish species, zebrafish (Danio rerio) to larger extend fulfils the 
conditions listed below as a good fish model for research usage (Ribas and Piferrer, 
2014; Ulloa et al., 2013; Ulloa et al., 2011): 
a) Possessed the basic biological features and exhibits comparable 
physiological responses to most of the important cultured species 
b) Short life cycle, easy and inexpensive to breed 
c) Small and stable genome so little genetic variation between individuals 
d) Numerous resources including genomic information and transgenic that 
facilitate research in most areas 
Zebrafish is a freshwater teleost omnivores fish belongs to the family of Cyprinidae 
(Dahm and Geisler, 2006). They consumed a great variety of foods including fish 
meal and plant based diets (Ribas and Piferrer, 2014). They also have a large 
number of offspring, a single female can lay up to 200 eggs per week and the 
continuous eggs production distinguishes them from most of the cultured fish 
(Yoon et al., 2013; Dahm and Geisler, 2006). Zebrafish has short generation interval 
allowing for performance of growth studies in a shorter time thereby giving savings 
on maintenance costs and space requirements. 
Undoubtedly, zebrafish is a famous well-established model organism particularly 
for biologists to study the developmental, molecular, toxicological studies and 
immunological studies (Dahm and Geisler, 2006). Recent year, it has emerged as a 
potential model organism in aquaculture research which involved in different 
aspects including reproduction, stress, pathology, toxicology nutrition for 
inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract and growth to examine the 
experimental diets (Fuentes-Appelgren et al., 2014; Ribas and Piferrer, 2014; Ulloa 
et al., 2014; Ulloa et al., 2011).  
There are very limited studies had been done on zebrafish that related to ANF. Out 
of so many different types of ANF, most the studies were only considering the 
effect of soybean saponin on the growth and innate immune system in zebrafish. 
Fuentes-Appelgren et al. (2014) and Hedrera et al. (2013) stated the presence of 
soybean saponin in the diet could triggered the immune response and lead to 
intestinal inflammation. Studied done by Liu et al. (2013) and Ulloa et al. (2013) 
reported that the substitution of fish meal with soybean meal had adverse effect on 
growth performance of zebrafish but with the supplement of phytase growth 
performance was improved. This could be atributed to the increased mineral 
bioavailability in the phytase treated diet. Besides, the presence of phytase will 
dephosphorylate phytic acid that are able to form complexes with proteins that 
alter the protein solubility, enzymatic activity and proteolysis in mono-gastric 
animals (Krogdahl et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2010; Urbano et al., 2000; Reddy and 
Pierson, 1994). 
1.8.2 Asian seabass 
Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) also known as Siakap in Malaysia and barramundi 
in Australia is one of the important aquaculture species in Southeast Asia due to its 
high growth rate and consumer demand (Eusebio and Coloso, 2002). It is broadly 
distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region from the Arabian Gulf to China, Taiwan 
Province of China, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia (FIGIS, 2013).  
Barramundi derived from the aboriginal word barramundi meaning large scales is 
the common name in Australia however it also known as giant perch and cock up. 
Other variations in nomenclature includes anama in Papua New Guinea, kakap in 
Indonesia,  bulgan in Philippines, bhakti in India (Schipp et al., 2007). It is the most 
commonly eaten and popular fish therefore among the most commercially 
valuable. Barramundi is carnivorous fish that farmed commercially in ponds, cages 
and recirculating tanks in Southeast Asia and Australia. They are fed on trash fish in 
Asia and pellets in Australia (Tian and Qin, 2003). 
According to Department of Fisheries Western Australia (2013), barramundi live in 
both freshwater and saltwater and they eat almost anything including other 
barramundi and crustaceans. They can consume prey up to 60 % of their own 
length. Common size of barramundi is between 25 cm to 100 cm however they can 
grow up to 200 cm in length and 60 kg (FIGIS, 2013). Even though the species can 
grow up to 60 kg, the harvest size of barramundi is usually between 400 g to 4000 g 
depending on the market demand (Glencross, 2008). Barramundi can change sex 
from male to female during their lifecycle. By observing the body and fins colour, 
the freshwater and saltwater barramundi can be differentiated. Freshwater 
barramundi are greenish-blue on the upper part of the body and dark brown to 
black colour fins while saltwater barramundi have silvery body and yellow fins 
(FIGIS, 2013). 
Barramundi is known to survive in water with a salinity over 50 ppt and at 
temperature 16C to 35C. Yet, juvenile barramundi tend to grow faster in lower 
salinities (Schipp et al., 2007). They are widely known for their good taste and firm 
texture including tender, mild tasting as well as boneless fillets (Schipp et al., 2007; 
Peet, 2006). Barramundi are suited to aquaculture as they are hardy, fast-growing, 
feed well on pelleted diets and universally regarded as a fine table fish (FIGIS, 2013; 
Peet, 2006). They have the uncommon ability to synthesize long chain omega-3 
fatty acids that contribute to human health (Peet, 2006).  
According to FAO (2013), the major nutrients requirement for barramundi include 
protein, lipid and carbohydrate (Table 1.4). Diets for carnivorous species are mainly 
composed of protein, lipid and carbohydrate whilst diets for omnivorous species 
have less protein and more carbohydrate (Jobling, 2015).

Over the past 20 years, feeds for barramundi have undergone considerable 
development from the use of baitfish or feed fish, to a simple pellet-pressed diet, to 
a modern, extruded, high-energy pellets (Glencross, 2006). There are concerns that 
the replacement of fish meal in aquaculture diets could adversely affect the 
marketability of the fish because of consumer perception of altered taste or 
reduced health benefit due to lowered omega-3 fatty acid content (Williams et al., 
2003). Therefore, there is growing interest in the specific effects of plant proteins 
on lipid synthesis and metabolism and their effects on flesh quality.  
1.9 Aims of the project 
Currently, farming of high value carnivorous fish is one of the most harmful 
aquaculture production systems. To overcome the negative impacts of farming 
carnivorous fish, the incorporation of underutilised legume protein as an 
alternative protein source in aquafeed is needed for more sustainable aquaculture 
production. The presence of ANFs particularly enzyme inhibitors can adversely 
affect nutrient absorption in the fish digestive system. It is therefore predicted that 
feeding carnivorous fish with untreated legume protein will result in lower growth 
performance when compared to treated legume protein feed. Little work has been 
done to develop a processing strategy to remove ANFs present in underutilised 
legumes and investigate on the effect of these processed legume-based feeds on 
the growth of zebrafish and Asian seabass (Siakap).  
The specific aims of this study were: 
1. To determine the targeted ANFs present in underutilised legumes 
2. To develop processing techniques to reduce ANFs present in underutilised 
legumes 
3. To develop the formulation for the legume-based aquafeed 
4. To investigate the effect of the ANF-reduced legume-based aquafeed on 
the growth performance of zebrafish and Asian seabass

2.3 Anti-nutritional factors analysis 
2.3.1 Trypsin inhibitors assay 
Trypsin inhibitor was determined using -N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-
nitroanilidehydrochloride (BAPNA) as the substrate for trypsin. A 1 g of ground 
freeze-dried legumes was extracted by soaking with 10 mL of 0.15 M sodium 
phosphate buffer pH 8.1 at 4C for 12 h. The extracts were then centrifuge at 3000 
g for 10 min at 4C. Extracts (20 L) was incubated with 40 L of trypsin solution 
(0.004 % (w/v) trypsin in 0.025 M glycine HCl buffer) and diluted to 80 L with pH 
8.1 buffer phosphate were then incubated for 10 min at 37C. A 100 L of 0.001 M 
BAPNA solution in pH 8.1 sodium phosphate buffer, previously warmed to 37C, will 
be added. After 10 min incubation at 37C, 20 L of 30 % (v/v) acetic acid was 
added to stop the reaction. Trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), was expressed as trypsin 
inhibitor unit/mg sample, and calculated from the absorbance read at 410 nm 
against a reagent blank. One trypsin unit was defined as the increase by 0.01 
absorbance unit at 410 nm of the reaction mixture (Marzo et al., 1998). 
There were a wide range of expression units had been used to measure the trypsin 
inhibitor activity that included trypsin inhibitor units per milligram sample, 
milligram trypsin inhibitor per gram of sample, trypsin units per gram protein, 
trypsin inhibited units per milligram protein, parts per million of Kunitz units, that 
could lead to confusion. The unit that being used in this study (TIA unit/mg) was the 
most commonly reported by researchers.  
2.3.2 Chymotrypsin inhibitors assay 
The enzyme inhibitory activity was determined in extracts as described by Marzo et 
al. (1998). A 1 g of ground freeze-dried legumes was extracted by soaking in 10 mL 
of 0.08 M Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.6) for 12 h at 4C. The extracts were then centrifuge 
at 3000 g for 10 min at 4C. Sample extracts (20 L) was incubated with 40 L of 
chymotrypsin solution (0.005 % (w/v) chymotrypsin in Tris HCl buffer pH 7.6) and 
diluted to 80 L with pH 7.6 Tris HCl buffer and incubated for 10 min at 30C. A 100 
L of 0.001 M benzoyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester (BTEE), previously warmed to 30C was 
added and mixed. After 10 min incubation at 30C, 20 L of 30 % (v/v) acetic acid 
was added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was read at 256 nm against the 
blank. Chymotrypsin inhibitor activity (CIA), was expressed as chymotrypsin 
inhibitor unit/mg sample, and calculated from the absorbance read at 256 nm 
against a reagent blank. One chymotrypsin unit was defined as the increase by 0.01 
absorbance unit at 410 nm of the reaction mixture. 
2.3.3 -Amylase inhibitors assay  
-Amylase inhibitor activity (AIA) was evaluated according to the modified method 
of Deshpande et al. (1982). A 1 g of ground freeze-dried legumes was extracted by 
soaking with 10 mL of deionized water for 12 h at 4C and the supernatants were 
tested for -amylase inhibitory activity. A 25 L sample solution containing the 
inhibitor was incubated with 25 L of -amylase enzyme solution (0.003 % (w/v) in 
0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and containing 0.006 M NaCl) for 15 min at 
37C. To this mixture was added 50 L of 1 % (w/v) starch solution (preincubated at 
37C). At the end of 3 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 L of 
1 % (w/v) dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent and heating in a boiling water bath for 
10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 540 nm. The -amylase inhibitor activity 
(AIA) was expressed as -amylase inhibitor unit/mg sample and calculated from the 
absorbance read at 540 nm against a reagent blank. One unit of -amylase activity 
inhibited was defined as one -amylase inhibitory unit. 
2.4 Nutritional analysis 
2.4.1 Protein analysis 
a) Quantification of protein content using Kjeldahl method 
The analysis was carried out according to AOAC, 1990. A 0.1 g of ground freeze-
dried legumes were weight into a sample tubes and 2 titanium tablets (3.71 g per 
tablet which consists of 3.5 g of potassium sulphate (K2SO4) / 0.105 g of copper (II) 
sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4 5 H2O) /0.105 g titanium dioxide (TiO2)) were added 
followed by 15 mL of concentrated sulphuric acid (H2SO4). The samples were 
digested at 380C for 1.5 h. The digested samples were then allowed to cool down 
to room temperature for 10 to 15 min before subjected to distillation process. The 
digested sample were distilled by using the Kjeldahl distillation unit. To the digested 
sample was added 63 mL of 32 % (w/v) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 60 mL 4 % 
(w/v) boric acid and 60 mL of distilled water and allowed it to distil for 4 min. 
Ammonium sulphate used as standard. The distilled sample was then being titrated 
using 0.1N of H2SO4 to pH 4.65. The protein content was calculated using the 
following formula:  
% Protein = (((sample - blank)  normality  1.4) / sample weight)  6.25 
Notes: 
Normality  normality of titrated H2SO4 
Molecular mass of nitrogen  1.4 
Conversion factor  6.25 
b) Quantification of protein content using Bradford method 
The protein of legumes was carried out according to a modified method of Arifin et 
al. (2009) and Shen et al. (2008). The ground freeze-dried legumes were mixed with 
0.03 M NaOH pH 12 solution (10:1 v/w) with continuous shaking at 150 rpm for 1 h 
at 25C. The mixture was centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min at room temperature. 
The supernatant was carefully collect for further filtration process. It was filtered 
through Whatman No. 1 filter paper to obtain a crude extract. The amount of 
protein was quantify using the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), using bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. A 5 L of sample was added with 250 L of 
Bradford reagent and allowed it to react for 5 min at room temperature. The 
solution was measured against the blank (Bradford reagent) at 595 nm. 
2.4.2 Lipid analysis 
Lipid content was extracted by using Soxhlet method (AOAC, 1990). A 5 g of ground 
freeze-dried legumes were weighed in a thimble and subjected to hot extraction 
with 300 mL of petroleum ether for 6 h in the Soxhlet apparatus. After extraction, 
the petroleum ether was rotary evaporated. Lard was used as standard. The lipid 
content was calculated using the following formula:  
% Lipid content = [(M2 - M1) / sample size]  100 
Notes: 
M1  initial weight of flat bottom flask 
M2  final weight of flat bottom flask 
2.4.3 Crude fibre analysis 
A 1 g of defatted freeze-dried sample was weighed into the fibrebag. The fibrebag 
was dipped into the extraction beaker which contained of 360 mL of 0.128 M 
sulphuric acid. The extraction beaker was boiled on the hot plate for 5 min then 
simmered for another 25 min. The acid was drained from the fibrebag and washed 
with 300 mL of hot distilled water. The fibrebag was washed until a neutral pH was 
obtained. Then, added 360 mL of hot 0.313 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) into the 
extraction beaker and bring to boil. The solution was allowed to simmer for 25 min. 
The fibrebag was then washed with 300 mL of hot distilled water, 300 mL of 0.1 M 
hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 600 mL of hot distilled water, in succession. This 
wasfoloowed by the fibrebag being washed in diethyl ether. The residues in 
fibrebag were oven dried for 4 h at 105C. The fibrebag was then cooled in the 
desiccator for 15 min and the weight of the fibrebag with residue was noted. The 
cooled fibrebag was placed in an ashing furnace and ashed for 4 h at 550C. The 
fibrebag was then cooled in desiccator for 15 min and re-weighed. The ash was 
brushed out and the empty crucible re-weighed. The crude fibre was calculated as 
below: 
% Crude fibre = (( - ) - ( - )) /   100

2.4.4 Ash analysis 
A 5 g of freeze-dried sample was weighed in a crucible and placed the crucible in a 
ashing furnace. The sample was heated at 550C for 12 h. Weighed the crucible 
again with the ash. The ash was calculated as below: 
% Ash = ( - ) /   100 
Notes:

2.4.5 Moisture analysis 
The mositure content of the feed was determined by the weight difference 
between dry and wet material. A 2 g of ground diet was weight in a crucible and 
placed it in dyring oven at 105C for 12 h. The sample was cool in the dessicator to 
room temperature (25C) before weighing it. 
% Moisture = ( - ) /   100 
Notes:

2.4.6 Nitrogen free extract 
NFE mainly composed of digestible carbohydrate, vitamins, and other non-nitrogen 
soluble organic compounds. The calculation was done by using the below formula: 
% NFE = 100 - (% crude protein + % crude lipid + % crude fibre + % ash + % 
moisture) 
2.4.7 Energy 
The energy content of sample was determined using bomb calorimeter where gross 
energy is measured in terms of heat produced when a sample is completely 
combusted into carbon dioxide and water leaving remaining ash. A 1 g of freeze-
dried sample was weighed into the crucible and was compressed with the 
compressing tool. The crucible was placed into the holder and attached with an 
ignition thread. The bomb head was inserted into the calorimeter and allowed a 20 
s combustion in the chamber. Benzoic acid was used as a standard that consisted of 
26.454 MJ/kg. The energy measurement provided by the bomb calorimeter was 
expressed as MJ/kg.  
2.4.8 Amino acid quantification 
A 10 mg nitrogen of sample was weight into a 100 mL bottle and placed the bottle 
in chiller for 2 h to cool. The oxidation solution was prepared by using 10 mL of 
30 % (v/v) hydrogen peroxide with 90 mL of formic acid/phenol solution. The formic 
acid/phenol solution was prepared by taking 735 mL formic acid with 111 mL of 
distilled water and added with 4.73 g of phenol. The oxidation solution was 
incubated at 30C for 1 h and chilled it for 2 h. A 5 mL chilled oxidation solution was 
added into the cold sample bottle. The sample bottle was returned to the chiller 
and allowed it to be oxidised for 18 h. The hydrolysis solution was prepared by 
taking 492 mL concentrated hydrochloride acid with 1 g of phenol making the 
volume to 1 L with distilled water. After oxidation, 0.84 g of sodium metabisulphite 
and 50 mL of hydrolysis reagent were added into the bottle. The sample bottle was 
placed in a 110C oven and the lid was loosened. The lid was tighten after 1 h and 
left in the oven for a further 23 h. After hydrolysis, the sample bottle was placed in 
freezer for 45 min. The sample was removed from freezer and partly neutralised by 
adding 35 mL of 7.5 N sodium hydroxide into the sample and the samples were left 
in fume hood for 30 min to reach room temperature. The sample was then adjusted 
the pH to 2.2 using 7.5 N sodium hydroxide, 1 N sodium hydroxide and hydrolysis 
reagent.  
A 4 mL of concentrated solution of the internal standard norleucine (10 mol/mL) 
was added into the 200 mL volumetric flask. The hydrolysate was transferred to the 
volumetric flask and topped up to 200 mL using pH 2.2 tri-sodium citrate buffer. A 
20 mL of hydrolysate was transferred into centrifuged tube and centrifuged at 3000 
x g for 2 min. Collected the supernatant and filtered them through a 0.22 m filter 
into a sterile sample vial. The sample was injected into the amino acid analyser. The 
concentration of amino acid was expressed as gram per kilogram sample (g/kg). It is 
calculated as following: 
Amino acid (g/kg) = (A x MW x F) / (W x 50000)

2.5 Molecular techniques and methods 
2.5.1 Extraction of RNA from fish tissue 
The RNA was extracted using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit followed the 
instruction of the manufacturer. Less than 30 mg of sample was added with 300 L 
of Buffer RLT and disrupted and homogenised using pellet pestle. The homogenised 
solution was added with 590 L RNase-free water followed by 10 L proteinase K (> 
600 mAU/mL) and mix gently. The mixture was incubated at 55C for 10 min. The 
mixture was the centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. After 
centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and added 450 L of 96  100 % (v/v) 
ethanol. The sample was transferred to RNeasy Mini column and centrifuged for 15 
s at 8000 x g at room temperature. A 350 L of Buffer RW 1 was added to RNeasy 
Mini column and centrifuged for 15 s at 8000 x g at room temperature, and the 
flow-through was discarded. An 80 L of DNase I (1500 units) was added to RNeasy 
Mini column and allowed it to stand on benchtop for 15 min. After 15 min, another 
350 L of Buffer RW 1 was added to RNeasy Mini column and centrifuged for 15 s 
at 8000 x g at room temperature, and the flow-through was discarded. A 500 L of 
Buffer RPE was added to RNeasy Mini column twice and centrifuged for 15 s at 
8000 x g at room temperature, and the flow-through was discarded. The RNeasy 
Mini column was centrifuged at full speed (21,130 x g) for 1 min at room 
temperature. The RNeasy Mini column was placed into a new 1.5 mL tube and 30 
L of RNase-free water was added and centrifuged for 1 min at 8000 x g at room 
temperature to elute the RNA. The purified RNA was read on NanoDrop to obtain 
the concentration. The purified RNA was then stored at -80C in RNase-free water.  
2.5.2 RNA integrity for zebrafish 
Purified RNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis to determine the integrity and 
size distribution of purified total RNA. The 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs appeared as 
sharp bands. The expected apparent ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA was approximately 
2.5.3 RNA integrity for Asian seabass 
Purified RNA was quantified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to determine the 
integrity and size distribution of total purified RNA. The 28S and 18S ribosomal 
RNAs were expected to appear as sharp peaks and then used to give a RNA integrity 
number (RIN). A RIN value of 10 indicates no degradation has occurred whilst a 
value of 0 indicates a complete degrade in sample. A RIN value higher than 5 is 
recommended for RT-PCR.  
2.5.4 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for zebrafish 
The RNA was reverse transcript using RevertAid RT kit followed the instruction of 
the manufacturer. A 5 L of 100 ng/L purified RNA was added with 1 L Random 
Hexamer primer and 6 L of RNase-free water. The mixture was incubated at 65C 
for 5 min. The mixture was immediately chilled on ice. To the chilled mixture was 
added 5 L of 5x Reaction buffer, 1 L of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (20 U/L), 2 L 
of 10 mM dNTP mix and 1 L of RevertAid RT (200 U/L) which was then gently mix 
and centrifuge briefly to collect the mixture. After centrifugation, the mixture was 
incubated at 42C for 60 min and the reaction terminated by heating at 70C for 5 
min. The reverse transcription product (cDNA) was stored at -20C until further use. 
2.5.5 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Asian 
seabass 
The RNA was reverse transcript using QuantiNova Reverse Transcription kit 
followed the instruction of the manufacturer. A 5 L of 100 ng/L purified RNA was 
added with 2 L of gDNA Removal mix, 8 L of RNase-free water. The mixture was 
incubated at 45C for 2 min. The mixture was immediately chilled on ice. To the 
chilled mixture was added with 1 L of Reverse Transcription Enzyme and 4 L of 
Reverse Transcription Mix which was then gently mix and centrifuge briefly to 
collect the mixture. After centrifugation, the mixture was incubated at 25C for 3 
min and 45C for 10 min. It was then heated at 85C for 5 min to inactivate the 
Reverse Transcriptase Enzyme. The reverse transcription product (cDNA) was 
stored at -20C until further use.  
2.5.6 Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for zebrafish 
Forward and reverse primers (Table 2.3) were designed using Primer Express 3.0 to 
complement to the targeted DNA sequence at 5 and 3 end to allow annealing to 
take place during the reaction. The products size of each pair of the primers were 
less than 150 bp. The primers were designed for 2 gene transcripts of interest 
(interleukin 1 beta (il-1) and interleukin 8 (il-8)) and 2 housekeeping genes (beta-

2.6 Fish trials 
2.6.1 Zebrafish  
The juvenile zebrafish (AB wild type strain) were bred in house at The Institute of 
Integrative Biology aquarium facility, the University of Liverpool. The mixed sex of 
fish were approximately 2 months old at trial start. Throughout the study fish were 
housed in groups of 10 individuals in 25 identical 3 L zebrafish tanks, made by 
Aquatic Habitats, each 25 cm x 10 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H). The tanks were placed on 
the rank and connected to a centralised recirculating aquaculture system 
maintained by a sump filtration system and 50 % weekly water changes. Due to the 
small size of the fish, tanks were fitted with a 400 m fry mesh baffle; cleaning was 
conducted weekly during the weighing of the fish to prevent further disturbances. 
Water quality was subsequently kept stable with the following parameters, 
ammonia (NH4) at 0 mg/L, nitrite (NO2) at 0 mg/L, nitrate (NO3) at < 50 mg/L and pH 
7.0. Fish were maintained at 28  1C and exposed to a 12 light : 12 dark h light 
cycle.  
The study was conducted in a randomised design with 5 treatments and 5 
replicates per treatment, 50 fish in total per diet. A palatability test had been 
carried out before the feeding trial to assure that the fish readily accepted the 
formulated diets. After each tank of fish had been weighed, one weeks worth of 
daily feeds was pre-measured at 4 % body weight per day. This was repeated 
weekly to maintain a 4 % of body weight feed regime throughout 6 weeks trial, this 
encouraged maximum growth and health. On the days when fish were weighed, 
feed was given afterwards in order to gain accurate fish weights, on all other days 
feed was given in the morning.  
a) Weighing fish and data collection 
The body weight was taking weekly to record growth throughout and the length 
was only measured at the end of the study. Fish were weighed by tank; 10 fish as a 
whole due to time constraints. A separate 1.5 L tank was used, filled with 1 cm of 
system water, placed on a balance and tared. All 10 fish were caught in a small net, 
lifted from the housing tank, excess water was removed gently by dabbing the net 
on blue roll paper towel, the net preventing any physical harm to the fish, and then 
the fish were placed in the tank on the balance. The weight was recorded for each 
tank. While the fish were situated in the weighing tank, the housing tank and mesh 
baffle was cleaned before returning the fish. 
b) Samples taken at termination 
At the end of the study (6 weeks), the fish were humanely euthanized by over 
dosage of benzocaine, followed by pithing of the brain to confirm death. Once 
death, the intestines were removed and immediately immersed in RNAlater. The 
samples were initially stored at -80C to avoid unwanted changes in the gene 
expression. The samples were then transported on dry ice to the University of 
Nottingham for further analyses. 
2.6.2 Asian seabass 
The juvenile Asian seabass (approximately 5 to 6 cm) were purchased from BD 
Aquaculture Sdn. Bhd., Johor and maintained in the Crop for Future Research 
Centre (CFF) aquarium according to standard protocols. Fish were housed in groups 
of 4 individuals in 9 identical 120 L aquaria throughout the study. The aquaria were 
placed on the rank, centralised recirculating aquaculture system equipped with a 
biological filter. At least 50 % of the water from the system was replaced weekly. 
Tanks cleaning were carried out 1 h before and after every feeding using siphon. 
Juvenile Asian seabass were housed in the aquarium maintained at 28C  1C on a 
14 h light : 10 h dark photoperiod throughout the study. Water quality was 
subsequently kept stable with the following parameters, ammonia (NH4) at 0 mg/L, 
nitrite (NO2) at 0 mg/L, nitrate (NO3) at < 50 mg/L and pH 7.0. 
The study was conducted in a randomised design with 3 treatments and 3 
replicates per treatment, 12 fish in total per diet. A palatability test had been 
carried out before the feeding trial to assure that the fish readily accepted the 
formulated diets. After each tank of fish had been weighed, 6 days worth of daily 
feeds was pre-measured at 4 % body weight per day. This was repeated weekly to 
maintain a 4 % of body weight feed regime throughout 5 weeks trial, this 
encouraged maximum growth and health. On the days when fish were weighed, 
feed was given afterwards in order to gain accurate fish weights, on all other days 
feed was given in the morning.  
a) Weighing fish and data collection 
The body weight was taking weekly to record growth throughout and the length 
was only measured at the end of the study. Fish were weighed by tank; 4 fish as a 
whole due to time constraints. A separate 3 L tank was used, filled with 10 cm of 
system water, placed on a balance and tared. All 4 fish were caught in a small net, 
lifted from the housing tank, excess water was removed gently by dabbing the net 
on paper towel, the net preventing any physical harm to the fish, and then the fish 
were placed in the tank on the balance. The weight was recorded for each tank. 
While the fish were situated in the weighing tank, the housing tank was cleaned 
before returning the fish. 
b) Samples taken at termination 
At the end of the study (5 weeks), the fish were humanely euthanized by over 
dosage of benzocaine, followed by pithing of the brain to confirm death. Once 
death, the liver was immediately immersed in RNAlater. The submerged liver 
samples were initially stored on ice then -80C to avoid unwanted changes in the 
gene expression. The samples were then transported on dry ice to the University of 
Nottingham for further analyses. All the fish that had the viscera and kidney 
removed were towel dried to remove excess water and three fish from each tank 
were used for moisture determination (section 2.4.5). The remaining fish were 
frozen at -80C then lyophilised for 24 h. The dried fish were then ground into 
powder for analytical analysis including crude protein and crude lipid (section 2.4.1 
a and 2.4.2). 
2.7 Statistical analysis 
All data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22, IBM 
Corporation, USA) and graphs were constructed using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, 
GraphPad Software Inc, USA). The details of specific statistical tested used to check 
statistical significance are stated in each separate chapter.  
CHAPTER 3 
DETERMINATION OF THE ANTI-NUTRITIONAL FACTORS PRESENT IN 
UNDERUTILISED LEGUMES 
3.1 Introduction 
One of the major constraints for aquafeed production is the limited availability of 
feed ingredients to replace fish meal and soybean meal. Due to the booming prices 
of fish meal and soybean meal, it is crucial to look for alternative and more 
economical and nutritious legume sources that with comparable protein content as 
in fish meal and soybean. Therefore, current study was conducted to investigate 
the possibility of using underutilised legumes available in Malaysia and South-East 
Asia for this purpose, with an ultimate aim to promote the use of local resources for 
production of sustainable aquafeed. In this study, seven underutilised dried 
legumes, namely mung bean, adzuki bean, chickpea, hyacinth bean, black-eyed pea, 
pigeon pea, and bambara groundnut were investigated.  
One of the challenges of using leguminous protein source is the endogenous anti-
nutritional factors (ANFs), such as enzyme inhibitors, that affected the digestion of 
nutrients by animals. Although use of soybean as an alternative has met the high 
dietary protein requirement of fish, it contains numerous ANFs included trypsin 
inhibitors, lectins, tannins, phytic acids, saponins and oligosaccharides (Adeyemo 
and Onilude, 2013; Choct et al., 2010; De Toledo et al., 2007). These ANFs have the 
potential to diminish legumes nutrient value resulting in decreased animal 
performance and health. Therefore, soybean which is currently used in feed 
industry, for example for the use in poultry feed, has to undergo effective heat-
treated process, such as roasting and extrusion, to avoid the reduction of animal 
performance (Newkirk, 2010; Stein et al., 2008).  
The specific aims of this study were: 
 To evaluate the protein and lipid contents in the underutilised legumes 
 To determine the presence of enzyme inhibitors via enzymatic assays in the 
underutilised legume - trypsin, chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitor 
 To determine the level of enzyme inhibitors and protein content present in 
six adzuki bean and bambara groundnut varieties 
The hypothesis of this study was that relative soybean (control) underutilised 
legumes would have a lower macronutrient and higher anti-nutrient factor 
concentrations. The six variety of adzuki bean and bambara groundnut that 
obtained from different locations would have different level of protein and anti-
nutrient factor concentration.  
3.2 Experimental design 
3.2.1 Various legumes preparation 
For the study reported in section 3.3.1, the dried legumes (soybean, mung bean, 
adzuki bean, chickpea, hyacinth bean, black-eyed pea, and pigeon pea) were 
purchased from Giant Hypermarket Semenyih, Selangor. Whilst the bambara 
groundnut was provided by Crop for Future Research Centre (CFF).  
For the study reported in section 3.3.2, the dried adzuki bean were purchased from 
Giant Hypermarket located in six states in Malaysia, namely Pahang (PHG), Perak 
(PRK), Johor (JHR), Pulau Pinang (PNG), Kuala Lumpur (KUL) and Selangor (SEL). 
Whereas, the bambara groundnut were provided by Dr Ajit Singh and CFF. These 
bambara groundnut were consist of four landraces from Nigeria (SOK, KAA, KAB 
and KAR), one from Thailand (SON), and one from Indonesia (GER). 
These dried legumes with seed coat were ground into fine powder using a miller 
without going through dehulling process. The dehulling process was not carried out 
mainly due to lacking of dehulling machine in the lab and also the aim to reduce 
processing step that might add on additional cost to the final product. The finely 
ground legume powder was then to pass through a series of mesh sieves with the 
size of 1.68 m, 1.18 m and 0.85 m. The powder that was stopped on 1.18 m 
mesh sieve was collected for further analysis. All assay was carried out in triplicate.  
3.2.2 Determination of ANFs and Macronutrients 
The grounded legumes were subjected to the determination of ANFs, namely 
trypsin inhibitors (section 2.3.1), chymotrypsin inhibitors (section 2.3.2) and -
amylase inhibitors (section 2.3.3) as well as nutritional composition which were 
protein using Kjeldahl and Bradford methods (section 2.4.1a and 2.4.1b) and lipid 
content using Soxhlet method (section 2.4.2). 
3.2.3 Statistical analysis 
All the results were presented as mean  standard error mean (SEM). IBM SPSS 
Statistics software (Version 22, IBM Corporation, USA) was used to perform one-
way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on data sets and where this was statistical 
significant (p<0.05) subsequent post-hoc analysis was carried out using Duncans 
Multiple Comparison test with confidence intervals of 95 % with threshold for 
significance when p<0.05. Data was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test 
and for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test. Graphs were constructed 
using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software Inc, USA). 
3.3 Results and Discussion 
3.3.1 Determination of macronutrients and ANFs 
Both Kjeldahl and Bradford methods are the official analysis methods of Association 
of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC International) and are used commonly in 
nutritional labelling and quality control. In this study, the Kjeldahl unit was only 
made available at the later stage of the study, thus Bradford method was used 
initially as an alternative method to determine the protein content in legumes. 
Bradford method determine the total protein concentration of a sample based on 
the binding of Coomasie dye to specific amino acids such as  arginine, lysine, 
histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine that commonly present in 
protein sample (Moore et al., 2010; Nielsen, 2010; Compton and Jones, 1985). 
Continued use of Bradford method in this study allowed further understanding on 
the changes of major amino acids during processing steps. While Kjeldahl method 
only allowed determination of crude protein content, and not specific amino acids. 
Kjeldahl method digested the sample with strong acid to transform all nitrogen in 
the sample into ammonium sulphate, followed by distillation and titration to 
determine the crude protein content in a sample. Hence, both methods are useful 
to provide further insights on the effect of processing steps on the specific amino 
acids and crude protein content of legume samples. Since the principles of both 
Kjeldahl and Bradford methods are different, hence is not advisable to compare the 
protein contents determined by these methods directly.  
When the crude protein content was determined using Kjeldahl method, Figure 3.1 
showed that soybean exhibited the 30  40 % higher crude protein per unit dry 
weight than the tested legumes. Among the underutilised legumes tested, their 
protein contents were ranging from 33.81 and 39.43 g/100g DW with hyacinth 
bean and chickpea highest and lowest protein content respectively.  
Compared to USDA (2017) database, crude protein content of soybean, mung bean, 
adzuki bean, chickpea, black-eyed pea and hyacinth bean were 33 to 47 % higher 
than current study. This large variation of crude protein content might due to the 
different cultivate field, genetic variation, and influence of environmental factors 
such as temperature and water availability. Crude protein content seems to be 
particularly sensitive to environmental stress (Wang and Daun, 2006). As reported 
in Nikolopoulou et al. (2007), the nutrients including protein, fat and starch content 
of field pea was affected by the interaction between the cultivation area and the 
cultivation year.  
When protein content was determined using the Bradford method, Figure 3.2 
showed that adzuki bean and mung bean exhibited the higher protein content of 
13.21 g/100g DW and 12.75 g/100g DW respectively which were significantly higher 
(p<0.001) than the remaining legumes tested. Since the Coomassie Brilliant Blue 
dye used in Bradford methods binds strongly to basic amino acid residue which are 
arginine and lysine trough electrostatic attraction, and to a lesser extent histidine 
and aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine through 
hydrophobic interaction (Nielsen, 2010, Compton and Jones, 1985). Hence current 
finding suggests that both mung bean and adzuki bean might have higher basic and 
aromatic amino acids than the remaining legumes tested. Wang et al. (2017) and 
Wilson (1986) reported that amino acids especially lysine and tryptophan are 
required for normal growth and metabolism of fish. Hence legumes with higher 
amount of amino acids will be preferable for use as aquafeed.

indicated legumes were determined utilising the Kjeldahl method. There was 
significant difference (ANOVA, p<0.001). Values with different letters are 
significantly different (p<0.05), error bars represent +/- standard error mean, n=3.

indicated legumes were determined utilising the Bradford method. There was 
significant difference (ANOVA, p<0.001). Values with different letters are

There was a significant difference in the concentration of lipid in the legumes 
(p<0.001). The lipid content (Figure 3.3) was found to be greater in soybean (27.67 
g/100g DW) followed by bambara groundnut and the remaining legumes were 
within the range of 6.27 to 10.33 g/100g DW with no significant difference 
(p<0.001) amongst them.  
Figure 3.3 The total lipid content in selected legumes. The indicated legumes was 
determined utilising the Soxhlet method. There was significant difference (ANOVA, 
p<0.001). Values with different letters are significantly different (p<0.05), error bars 
represent +/- standard error mean, n=3. 
According to USDA (2017) database, the lipid content of soybean, mung bean, 
adzuki bean, chickpea, black-eyed pea and hyacinth bean were ranged from 1.69 to 
19.94 g/100g DW where hyacinth bean and soybean had the highest and lowest 
respectively. The lipid content variation of current study compared with USDA data 
was in agreement with Anwar et al. (2016) who reported that the lipid content of 
soybean was affected by the varieties.  
From the data presented here, mung bean and adzuki bean could possibility be a 
good candidate as an alternative to soybean. Although their crude protein and lipid 
content was approximately 36 % and 77 % respectively lower than soybean. Yet, 
mung bean and adzuki bean had comparable amino acid of arginine, lysine, 
histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine residues to soybean. This made 
them stand out from the other underutilised legumes.  
Even though the crude protein content of underutilised legumes were 30  40 % 
lower than soybean, some of them contain a comparable amino acids content as 
soybean, therefore this possibly makes them promising ingredients for aquafeed. A 
potential advantage of these legumes was their lipid content which was 29  77 % 
lower than soybean, large quantities of lipid not being ideal for aquafeeds. Thus, 
these underutilised legumes might not able to completely replace the soybean but 
could contribute as one of the protein sources along with incorporation of other oil 
seed or sources.  
In order to enhance a protein sparing effect and decrease nitrogenous losses, high 
dietary lipid levels are commonly used in carnivorous fish as an important source of 
energy (Regost et al., 2003). Published work from Glencross et al. (2016) showed 
that it is possible to almost replace all the fish meal with soybean meal and poultry 
meal without losing the barramundi growth performance, up to and including diets 
with as little as 100 g/kg fish meal. While for fish oil, there has been more success in 
completely replacing it with soybean oil and rice bran oil without affecting the 
growth of salmonids and barramundi respectively (Glencross et al., 2016; Hardy, 
1987).  
Proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin take affect the utilisation of 
protein and ultimately affect the growth of fish (Dabrowski and Glogowski, 1977). 
Trypsin cleaves polypeptides at the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues 
whilst chymotrypsin cleaves at the carboxyl side of tyrosine, tryptophan, 
phenylalanine, and leucine residues. Trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors bind to 
the respective active site of the enzyme thereby inhibiting digestive enzyme activity 
in the fish digestive tract (Krogdahl et al., 2010). While the presence of -amylase 
inhibitory activity will impair carbohydrate digestion by inhibiting the hydrolysis of 
-1,4-glycosidic bonds (Singh et al., 2010). The -amylase inhibitors form 
complexes with -amylases potentially preventing fish using carbohydrate as an 
energy source (Yengkokpam et al., 2007).  
There was a significant difference in the trypsin inhibitory activity in the legumes 
(p<0.001). As shown in Figure 3.4, mung bean had the highest trypsin inhibitory 
activity (0.171 TIA unit/mg). No trypsin inhibitor was detected in black-eyed pea, 
hyacinth bean and bambara groundnut. The trypsin inhibitory activity of 
underutilised legumes was ordered as mung bean > adzuki bean and chickpea > 
pigeon pea > black-eyed pea, hyacinth bean and bambara groundnut.  
Figure 3.4 The trypsin inhibitory activity in selected legumes. There was significant 
difference (ANOVA, p<0.001). Values with different letters are significantly different 
(p<0.05), error bars represent +/- standard error mean, nd represent not 
detectable, n=3. 
The unexpected undetectable trypsin inhibitor in black-eyed pea, hyacinth bean 
and bambara groundnut could be due to the sensitivity of the current biochemical 
technique that been applied in enzymatic assay. The plausible explanation of this 
could be that because the concentration of trypsin inhibitor was too low and 
beyond the detection limit. Current method is an inexpensive and common method 
that had been used to detect the trypsin inhibitors, but the detection of 
biochemical technique is relatively less sensitive compared to high-throughput 
technique. To date, there is no available of high-throughput assay to quantify the 
total enzyme inhibitors in legumes.  
Miyagi et al. (1997) reported trypsin inhibitory activity of 0.048 TIA unit/mg for 
soybean which is 20 % lower than current study. Whereas the reported studies on 
mung bean, chickpea, black-eyed pea, hyacinth bean, pigeon pea and bambra 
groundnut were at least 94  100 % higher than current findings (Osman, 2007; 
Tibe et al., 2007; Mubarak, 2005; Oloyo, 2004; Egounlety and Aworh, 2003; Frias et 
al., 2000).  
There was a significant difference in the chymotrypsin inhibitor activity in the 
legumes (p<0.001). Figure 3.5 shows that the chymotrypsin inhibitor content of 
mung bean (1.71 CIA unit/mg) was highest followed by soybean (1.53 CIA unit/mg), 
adzuki bean (1.07 CIA unit/mg) and black-eyed pea (1.15 unit/mg). Hyacinth bean, 
pigeon pea and bambara groundnut exhibited chymotrypsin inhibitor content with 
no significant difference among themselves (p>0.05) but were significantly higher 
(p<0.05) than chickpea (0.49 CIA unit/mg). 
The chymotrypsin inhibitory activity of pigeon pea and chickpea has previous 
reported was ranging from 2.10 to 3.60 CIA unit/mg and 5.70 to 9.40 CIA unit/mg 
respectively, whilst soybean was 30.16 CIA unit/mg (Shi et al., 2017; Singh, 1988). 
These values are at least 60  96 % higher than current findings.  
Figure 3.5 The chymotrypsin inhibitory activity in selected legumes. There was 
significant difference (ANOVA, p<0.001). Values with different letters are 
significantly different (p<0.05), error bars represent +/- standard error mean, n=3. 
There was a significant difference in the -amylase inhibitor activity in the legumes 
(p<0.001). Unlike for TIA and CIA, where mung bean had the highest activity, -
amylase inhibitor was highest in soybean (1.99 AIA unit/mg). The remaining 
legumes were not significantly different (p>0.05). 
Figure 3.6 The -amylase inhibitory activity in selected legumes. There was 
significant difference (ANOVA, p<0.001). Values with different letters are 
significantly different (p<0.05), error bars represent +/- standard error mean, n=3. 
Shi et al. (2017)  stated that the -amylase inhibitory activity in soybean was high 
(0.94 AIA unit/mg) but was undetectable in peas, lentils, faba bean and chickpea. 
Whilst Shekib et al. (1988) showed that -amylase inhibitory activity of chickpea 
and black-eyed pea were 2.21 AIA unit/mg and 3.38 AIA unit/mg respectively, 
which is approximately 95 % higher than current study. The variation in trypsin and 
-amylase inhibitory activity detected in legumes is probably due to the genetic 
differences in legume varieties and cultivars as well as the interaction with 
environmental factors such as climatic conditions, location, soil type and crop year. 
However the large variation of chymotrypsin inhibitor might be attributed to the 
different chymotrypsin inhibitor assays used to those described in the literature.  
The ANFs, including oligosaccharides, tannins and phytic acid, of field pea have 
been identified as being affected by cultivation area and cultivation year 
(Nikolopoulou et al., 2007). It could be anticipated that the content of 
proteinaceous enzyme inhibitors might be affected as well. Other than that, the 
structure of the seed will affect the enzymatic inhibitory activity too. As reported by 
Shi et al. (2017) the split legume had higher enzymatic inhibitory activity than the 
whole seed. Compare to protease inhibitors, less data have been documented on 
the -amylase inhibitor content of legumes. 
3.3.2 Determination of the effect of ANFs and protein content in adzuki bean 
and bambara groundnut obtained from different sources 
The study was conducted to investigate the impact of legume sources on the ANFs 
and protein content of underutilised legumes. Two legumes, adzuki bean and 
bambara groundnut were selected for this investigation. Both legumes were 
purchased from six sources at different locations. In general, the protein content, 
TIA, CIA and AIA of adzuki bean and bambara groundnut reported in section 3.3.1 
were within the same range of value with those legumes from different sources 
reported in this section.  
The protein content of adzuki bean and bambara groundnut from multiple sources 
were ranging from 28.59 to 37.39 g/100g DW and 30.71 to 37.02 g/100g DW, 
respectively. The protein content of adzuki bean (Table 3.1) was found to be 
greater in SEL (37.39 g/100g DW) whilst bambara groundnut (Table 3.2) were 
greater in SOK and GER (37.02 g/100g DW and 35.13 g/100g DW respectively) with 
no significant difference (p<0.001) amongst them. 
When compare the trypsin inhibitory activity among the legumes tested, adzuki 
bean from PHG had the highest trypsin inhibitory activity of 0.083 TIA unit/mg, 
while PNG had the lowest trypsin inhibitory activity of 0.025 TIA unit/mg. While 
bambara groundnut from four sources exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity that 
ranged from 0.081 to 0.178 TIA unit/mg, except for SOK and GER that had no 
detectable level of trypsin inhibitor. 
When compare the chymotrypsin inhibitory activity among the legumes tested, the 
adzuki bean from SEL and bambara groundnut from SON had the highest CIA of 
1.06 CIA unit/mg and 0.91 CIA unit/mg, respectively. Chymotrypsin inhibitory 
activity of adzuki bean had the range of 0.32 to 1.06 CIA unit/mg whereas bambara 
groundnut had the ranged of 0.19 to 0.91 CIA unit/mg. 
When compare the -amylase inhibitory activity among the legumes tested, adzuki 
bean from PRK and SEL had the highest -amylase inhibitory activity (0.121 AIA 
unit/mg and 0.123 AIA unit/mg respectively). Whilst bambara groundnut from GER 
had the highest -amylase inhibitory activity (0.228 AIA unit/mg). The -amylase 
inhibitory activity of adzuki bean had the range of 0.123 to 0.091 AIA unit/mg 
whereas bambara groundnut had the ranged of 0.228 to 0.082 AIA unit/mg.

Aforementioned in section 1.6, the macronutrient (protein) and ANFs of legume 
could possibly have affected by cultivation area, cultivation year, maturity of seed, 
genetic variation, and influence of environmental factors such as temperature and 
water availability. The protein content of adzuki bean and bambara groundnut 
reported were not within the range of those reported in other studies 
(Murevanhema and Jideani, 2013; Mkandawire, 2007; Yousif et al., 2007; Tjahjadi 
et al., 1988). They reported that the protein content of adzuki bean and bambara 
groundnut was in the range of 21  24 g/100g and 16  25 g/100g respectively. 
Studies described by Wang and Daun (2004) and Vollmann et al. (2000) the protein 
content in soybean and field peas was affected by environment factor. As an 
example, soybean that grown under moderately dry condition (19 mm rainfall) and 
high temperature (19.2C) yield the highest protein content approximately 433.7 
g/kg during the growing period compared to those that grown under humid 
condition. Nikolopoulou et al. (2007) stated that the pea that grown at different 
cultivation area could also influences the nutrient density, an average of 24 to 
30.5 % of protein higher had been observed in pea cultivar in the same cultivation 
year. Three different variety chickpea which were Evros, Amorgos and Gravia 
that cultivated at the same area had 7 to 9 % difference in protein content which 
grown in two different cultivation year (Nikolopoulou et al., 2006). 
In addition, several researchers reported that the ANFs including phytic acid, 
trypsin inhibitor, tannin, oxalate, saponin and lectin content was resulting from 
legume genetic variation (Shang et al., 2016; Dhole and Reddy, 2015; Ajibade et al., 
2005; Shim et al., 2003). The trypsin inhibitor in the 56 genotypes of common bean 
ranged from 0.016 to 15.947 mg/g with the mean value of 1.60 mg/g, whilst 20 
genotypes of African yam bean ranged from 17.11 to 33.56 TIU/mg with the mean 
value of 26.1 TIU/mg (Shang et al., 2016; Ajibade et al., 2005). It also reported that 
when the mung bean was grew under the same environment and climate, the level 
of phytic acid in 102 genotypes ranged from 5.85 to 20.02 mg/g with the average of 
8.26 mg/g (Dhole and Reddy, 2015). The wide variation in trypsin inhibitory activity 
and phytic acid were cause by genetic variability.  
Other than that, the changes in trypsin inhibitory activity related to cultivation year 
of common bean were being cultivated in the same environment was being 
observed over 3 years. A wide variation trypsin inhibitory activity was found within 
the cultivars across 3 years with an average of 27.67 TIU/mg DM in 1995, 25.31 
TIU/mg DM in 1996 and 23.39 TIU/mg DM in 1997 (Piergiovanni and Pignone, 
2003). Whereas the phytic acid content of chickpea that cultivated at different 
locations within the same cultivation year had varied from 0.2 % to 0.5 % 
(Nikolopoulou et al., 2006).  
In this study, adzuki bean that traded in Malaysia market were imported from other 
countries included Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea, but it was not 
distinguishable from the origin country. Whereas the bambara groundnut was 
imported from Nigeria, Thailand, and Indonesia. There was lacking the information 
such as cultivation area, cultivation year, maturity of seed, genetic variation as well 
as growing temperature and water availability which could affect the nutrient and 
anti-nutrient contents in these legumes. Thus, it is rather difficult to conclude that 
the variation of these legumes was cause by a particular factor. 
3.4 Summary 
In current findings, the mung bean and adzuki bean appear to be good alternative 
source of aquafeed than soybean. The mung bean and adzuki bean are high in 
crude protein and in selected amino acids such as arginine, lysine, histidine, 
phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine in relative to other underutilised legumes 
tested. Unfortunately, these legumes are with substantial level of protease 
inhibitors which might affect the protein digestibility and availability to fish. 
Besides, the present results also indicating the varietal differences exist in the 
protein and enzyme inhibitor contents of adzuki bean and bambara groundnut. The 
SEL adzuki bean and GER bambara groundnut had the highest protein content as 
well as substantial level of protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is essential to explore 
various processing methods that could be used to reduce these ANFs prior to 
application as aquafeed.  
CHAPTER 4 
EFFECT OF PROCESSING METHODS IN REDUCING ENZYME INHIBITORS PRESENT IN 
UNDERUTILISED LEGUMES 
4.1 Introduction 
Findings from Chapter 3 suggested that majority of the underutilised legumes 
tested contain substantial amount of enzyme inhibitors that might restrict their 
application as ingredients for aquafeed. These enzyme inhibitors such as trypsin, 
chymotrypsin and -amylase enzyme inhibitors might cause detrimental effect to 
the digestion and nutrient absorption aquatic animals. Hence it is the aim of 
current study to develop effective thermal and non-thermal processing methods 
that could to reduce these enzyme inhibitors present in legumes.  
The elimination of enzyme inhibitors for legumes is remains a challenge to 
researchers, as they need to ensure the processing methods is effective and will not 
deteriorate the nutritive value of the processed food (Hailu et al., 2015; Luo and 
Xie, 2013; Singhal et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Osman, 2007). The common 
processing methods used to remove trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors are 
through soaking and heat treatment which involves cooking or autoclaving (ElMaki 
et al., 2007; Egounlety and Aworh, 2003). However, to the authors knowledge, no 
single processing method or strategy is effective in removing these enzyme 
inhibitors totally. Thus, current study will employ and optimise the food processing 
methods available including soaking, heat treatment, autoclaving, and dry freezing 
and develop a strategy to remove these enzyme inhibitors and without affecting 
the nutritional content of the legumes.  
Dehulling, germination, and fermentation were not being used in this study due to 
several limitations. There is no dehulling machine available in the university. 
Besides, the ultimate aim for these processed legumes are to use as aquafeed 
ingredient, from the point of industrialisation and commercialisation; the 
processing methods need to be less laborious and cheap. Germination process will 
lead to additional labour cost for harvesting that need to be take into consideration 
whilst fermentation process involved in acid production that might alter the 
palatability of the legume could possibility reduce the feed intake in targeted fish. 
The overall objective of this research on of underutilised legume is to enhance the 
use of plant protein in aquafeed thereby reducing the over-reliance of 
commercially important legume which are finite source. The presence of enzyme 
inhibitors that affect the utilisation of protein and carbohydrate could serve as a 
major drawback.  
To overcome these challenges, the specific aim of this chapter was: 
 To determine the optimal operating parameters such as soaking, wet 
heating, autoclaving and dry freezing as well as the effect of different time 
periods and temperatures in reducing enzyme inhibitors (trypsin, 
chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitors) present in underutilised legumes 
whilst also attempting to retain their nutritive values 
Current hypothesis suggested that the optimised wet heating and autoclaving will 
be the most effective methods, out of four processing methods, to reduce the 
enzyme inhibitors present in underutilised legumes, since enzyme inhibitors can be 
decomposed better with heat.  
4.2 Methodology 
4.2.1 Sample preparation 
The sources of seven underutilised legumes, namely mung bean (MB), adzuki bean 
(AB), chickpea (CP), hyacinth bean (HB), black-eyed pea (BEP), pigeon pea (PP) and 
control soybean (SB) tested in this study were reported in section 3.2.1. 
4.2.2 Legume processing methods 
The dried legumes were purchased from the same single source. Each of the 
processing methods was performed in triplicate for each type of legume (single 
sample).  
a) Soaking 
A 10 g of dried legumes were soaked in 100 mL of distilled water for different 
durations of 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h at room temperature (25C) respectively. 
After removing the soaking medium, the soaked legumes were chilled overnight at 
4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h.  
b) Wet heating 
A 10 g of dried legumes were immersed in 100 mL of distilled water and then 
immediately heated at either 50C or 100C for 30 min or 60 min. After decanting 
the water phase, the wet heated legumes were allowed to cool to room 
temperature and chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h.  
c) Autoclaving 
A 10 g of dried legumes were immersed in 100 mL of distilled water and then 
immediately autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. After decanting the water 
phase, the autoclaved legumes were allowed to cool to room temperature and 
chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h.  
d) Dry freezing 
The dried legumes (10 g) were frozen at -20C and -80C for 24 h at each 
temperature and proceed to the lyophilised process without allowing them to heat 
up to room temperature.  
All the frozen samples were lyophilised for 24 h using freeze-dryer (Alpha 1-4 LD 
plus, Christ). The lyophilised legumes were then ground into powder form using a 
miller without going through dehulling process. The fine powder was then to pass 
through a series of mesh sieves with the size of 1.68 m, 1.18 m and 0.85 m. The 
powder that was stopped on 1.18 m mesh sieve was collected and stored in 4C 
chiller up to 2 weeks prior to analysis for enzyme inhibitors and nutrients.  
4.2.3 Enzyme inhibitors and nutrient determination 
The trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitors present in the raw and 
processed dried samples were determined according to sections 2.3.1  2.3.2. The 
protein content of raw and processed dried samples was determined according to 
section 2.4.1a  2.4.1b. In this study, both Bradford and Kjeldahl protein 
determination methods were used to determine the soluble amino acids in sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH) and total crude protein respectively. All assay was carried out in 
triplicate, except for crude protein (Kjeldahl method) that only one replicate was 
being performed.  
4.2.4 Statistical analysis 
The results were presented as mean  standard error mean (SEM) which had 
carried out in triplicate. Except for crude protein content determined using Kjeldahl 
method that presented as single analysis value. IBM SPSS Statistics software 
(Version 22, IBM Corporation, USA) was used to perform two-way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) on data sets and where this was statistical significant (p<0.05) 
subsequent post-hoc analysis was carried out using Duncans Multiple Comparison 
test confidence intervals of 95 % with threshold for significance when p<0.05. Data 
was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test, where stated, none normally 
distributed data was transformed (square root) before statistical analysis was 
performed. Data was checked for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test.  
4.3 Results and Discussion 
In this chapter, the effect of operational parameters such as soaking, wet heating, 
autoclaving and dry freezing on the enzyme inhibitors (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and 
-amylase inhibitors) and protein content present in underutilised legumes were 
investigated. Only 10 g of legumes in each replicate were subjected to processing 
methods due to the limitation of the equipment. The benchtop freeze dryer is 
designed for lyophilizing light sample loads and lead to the decision of processed 
only 10 g of legumes for each replicate. As mentioned before in section 3.3, 
Kjeldahl machine was not available during the early stage of the study and Bradford 
method was used as an alternative. Another challenge for Kjeldahl method was the 
limitation of chemical, this chapter had too much of samples and due to the 
constraint of research cost; Kjeldahl method was only performed in single replicate 
for verification purpose.  
4.3.1 Soaking treatment 
Soaking is a preliminary step prior to cooking which helps to soften the texture of 
dried legume and shorten the cooking time (Xu and Chang, 2008). The soaking 
treatment is the imbibition process involved in admission of water into the dried 
legume through the pores and the thinnest area of the seed coat , resulting in 
swelling of tissue and water uptake without cell separation (Eyaru et al., 2009; 
Periss and Planchuelo, 2004). The soaking medium usually becomes slightly 
coloured which indicates some of the soluble constitutes such as phenolic 
compounds had leached into soaking medium under the influenced of 
concentration gradient (Xu and Chang, 2008). 
 Effect of soaking on enzyme inhibitors 
There was a significant difference in the trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA), 
chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) and -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
interaction between legumes and the soaking period (p<0.001). The effect of 
soaking treatment on trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitory activity are 
shown in Table 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. In general, the soaking treatment increased the 
trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activity in tested legumes. In contrast, there 
was a reduction of -amylase inhibitory activity in was observed in four soaked 
legumes, namely MB, AB, CP, and BEP but this was only consistently seen in the 
early part of the soaking period (6 to 12 h of soaking).  
There was a significant difference of trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) in the legumes 
with the soaking duration (p<0.001) as it had increased with the soaking duration. 
As shown in Table 4.1, the raw legumes possessed the lowest TIA ranging from 
0.042 to 0.171 TIA unit/mg. Interestingly, no detectable TIA was found for BEP, HB 
and BG. 
The TIA of soaked SB, AB and MB showed no significant difference with raw 
legumes after 6 h of soaking period. However, for the remaining five legumes, a 
significant increment of 87 % to 100 % when compared to raw legumes. AB (1.294 
TIA unit/mg) and HB (0.181 TIA unit/mg) had the highest and lowest trypsin 
inhibitory activity after soaked for 12 h, respectively. 
There was a significant difference of chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) in the 
legumes with the soaking duration (p<0.001) as it had increased with the soaking 
duration. As shown in Table 4.2, the raw legumes possessed the lowest CIA ranging 
from 0.49 to 1.71 CIA unit/mg. All tested legumes, except for BG, showed a 
significant increase in CIA ranging from 40 % to 58 % after soaked for 6 h. The 
highest CIA after soaking for 18 h was in SB (5.32 CIA unit/mg), whilst the CIA of 24 
h-soaked BG was not significantly different from raw BG. 
There was a significant difference of -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
legumes with the soaking duration (p<0.001) as it had increased with the soaking 
duration. As shown in Table 4.3, the AIA of four legumes (MB, AB, CP, BEP) reduced 
significantly (p<0.001) after 6 h of soaking period, except for SB, HB, PP, and BG. 
Regardless the soaking duration, raw SB had showed the highest AIA (1.991 AIA 
unit/mg) which range from 8-fold to 27-fold higher when compared to the other 
legumes. Other than that, SB had increased the greatest of all the legumes with the 
soaking period. After soaking for 24 h, a 89 % increment of AIA was observed for 
SB, but after 24 h-soaked BG was only 18 % higher than raw BG. For HB, of the 
range for the increase was 13 % to 50 % when soaked for 12  24 h. Whilst for PP, 
of the range for the increase was 24 % to 62 % when soaked for 6  18 h. However, 
the 24 h-soaked PP showed significantly lower AIA than raw PP.  
For the four legumes that showed reduction after 6 h of soaking period, the prolong 
soaking period to 12 h had increased the AIA of MB and CP. Whereas, the AIA of AB 
and BEP only increased after 18 h of soaking period. After 24 h of soaking 
treatment, the AIA of these four legumes was significantly increased by 14 % to 
66 % when compared to raw legumes.

The process of soaking is a common treatment for reduction of ANFs which 
included protease inhibitors, phytic acid, saponin and flatulence causing 
oligosaccharides in legumes, as all can be solubilised and eliminated with the 
discarded soaking medium (Frias et al., 2000). Previous studies demonstrated that 
soaking could increase the inactivation of trypsin inhibitors in lentils, soybean and 
pea up to 3.6 % after soaked for 12 h (Hefnawy, 2011; Xu and Chang, 2008; 
Osman, 2007; Egounlety and Aworh, 2003).  
Current findings of increased in trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activity, and 
reduction in AIA after soaking period were in agreement with published studies of 
Embaby (2010) and Wang et al. (2008). They have reported a significant 
increment of trypsin inhibitors in soaked lupin and peas during prolonged soaking. 
Martn-Cabrejas et al. (2009) reported that the trypsin and chymotrypsin 
inhibitory activity of chickpea, lentil, white bean and pink-mottled cream bean 
significantly increased but -amylase inhibitory activity a significantly reduced 
after soaking. This is because soaking might have caused retention of inhibitors in 
soaked legumes in which the structure of the intact seed could possibly limit the 
removal of inhibitors in an aqueous environment (Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 
2008). The increased of inhibitors in soaked legumes could also due to low 
leaching-out effect during hydration, in which the loss of inhibitors to the soaking 
water was lower than other seed constituents such as soluble phenolic 
compounds (Shi et al., 2017; Martn-Cabrejas et al., 2009).  
This had been observed in the soaking water of the legumes as the water was 
slightly coloured and the colour intensity was increased with the soaking period 
that indicated the leaching out of phenolic compounds. Besides, the above 
plausible explanation of these results also showed that the removal of enzyme 
inhibitors is limited during soaking process regardless the soaking period, hence 
the soaking process could be taken as a pre-process before combine with other 
process to remove them effectively. The suitable soaking period varied from 
legumes to legumes, it could be determined by the softness of the cotyledon. The 
legumes should soak until soft as felt between the fingers to reduce the leaching 
out effect of soluble phenolic compounds.  
 Effect of soaking on protein content 
In current study, the effect of soaking on the protein content of tested legumes 
was first conducted via Bradford method, and then verified with Kjeldahl method. 
Bradford method is a quick microassay used for sodium hydroxide soluble protein 
determination, however, this method only able to detect proteins containing 
amino acids such as arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and 
histidine. Bradford method is based on protein-dye binding with direct detection 
of the colour change associated with the bound dye. Kjeldahl method involves the 
process of digestion, distillation and titration should be a more comprehensive 
determination of crude protein as this is based on the measurement of nitrogen 
content. A nitrogen conversion factor 6.25 is then used to estimate the crude 
protein content.  
There was a significant difference in the protein content determined via Bradford 
method in the interaction between legumes and the soaking period (p<0.001). 
The protein content of the soaked legumes determined via Bradford method is 
presented in Table 4.4. The protein content of all soaked legumes was 
significantly reduced with a range of 63 % to 84 % after 6 h and 12 h of soaking. 
Interestingly the values for all legumes at 6 h and 12 h were similar a range 1.96  
2.14 g/100g DW whilst at the raw samples their range was 5.70  13.55 g/100g 
DW. This could be related to the limitation of using Bradford reagent as soaking 
might have changed the ion charged of the protein and losing its binding 
sensitivity (Olson and Markwell, 2007). Soaked SB and AB had the greatest 
reduction in protein content as they reduced from 13.55 g/100g DW to 0.67 
g/100g DW and 13.21 g/100g DW to 0.54 g/100g DW respectively, while CP had 
the smallest reduction when compared to raw legumes. After prolong soaking to 
24 h, only of 4 % to 21 % Bradford reagent detectable protein remained in soaked 
legumes. 
Interestingly, current finding suggested that after declining to their lowest values 
at 18 h the protein content of legumes had increased by approximately 2-fold at 
24 h, except for BG. To explore this finding further, due to the specificity of 
Bradford method the Kjeldahl method was conducted to verify the protein 
content of these soaked legumes. Aforementioned, Bradford reagent tends to 
bind to the selected amino acids such as arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, 
tryptophan and tyrosine rather than total crude protein. 
To our knowledge, there is no studied reported on protein content of soaked 
legumes determined using Bradford method. In this study, the result suggested 
that amino acid such as arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and 
tyrosine residues might have leached out into the soaking water.

When the crude protein content of soak legumes was further verified using 
Kjeldahl method (Table 4.5) an interesting observation was recorded. There are 
no replicates in this observation thus there is no statistical comparison has been 
done. Five of the eight soaked legumes demonstrated increased protein content 
relative to the raw legumes after soaking for 24 h, rather than a reduction. Soaked 
MB at 6  24 h showed 6.5 % to 12 % of increment in protein content, while AB 
showed 1.3 % to 5 % increment when soaked from 12  24 h. For HB, 2.3 % to 4 % 
of increment were only observed after soaking for 18  24 h. Soaked CP and BEP 
only showed 7.7 % and 13.8 % increment at 6 h and 12 h respectively, follow by 
reduction after prolong soaking treatment. Only PP and BG showed 3.6 % to 12 % 
reduction after soaking treatment.

Majority of the legumes showed increase in crude protein content is in the 
agreement with studies done by Wang et al. (2008) and El-Adawy et al. (2000) on 
field pea and lupin soaked for 24 h and 13 h. These studies suggested that the 
crude protein content of lupin was increased 2.3 % after soaked for 13 h and 
further increased 2.6 % for 24 h-soaked field pea may be attributed to the loss of 
soluble solids during soaking.  
In contrast, the crude protein content of PP and BG decreased with the increased 
of soaking period was in accordance to those reports by Agume et al. (2017) and 
Abd El-Hady and Habiba (2003). In their studies, the crude protein content of 
soybean were decreased by 18.8 % after soaked for 24 h and further decreased 
19.5 % after soaked for 72 h suggested that the water soluble proteins had 
leached to the soaking water which lead to a reduction of protein content (Luo et 
al., 2009; Mumba et al., 2004).  
There is conflicting published data on the crude protein content of soaked 
legumes from the above reported researchers (Agume et al. 2017; Wang et al., 
2008; Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003; El-Adawy et al., 2000). Some of them 
reported the increased of crude protein under the process of soaking and vice 
versa. It can be noticed that the crude protein content of different legumes 
behaved differently even under the same soaking medium and soaking 
temperature. 
4.3.2 Wet heating 
Dry legumes are usually processed by common thermal treatment including wet 
heating, simple boiling, roasting or frying. These processes depletion of ANF 
thereby improving the nutritional quality (Khattab and Arntfield, 2009; Rehman 
and Shah, 2005). Wet heating could change various physical characteristic and 
alter the chemical compositions of dry legumes, such as protein denaturation and 
browning, losses of vitamin content and starch gelatinisation. These would 
potentially alter the sensory characteristic such as colour, flavour, and texture, 
either advantageously or adversely (Lewis and Jun, 2011; Aguilera et al., 2009; Xu 
and Chang, 2008; De Almeida Costa et al., 2006). In this section, the dried legumes 
were soaked in water and then heated at 50C and 100C for either 30 min or 60 
min to reduce the enzyme inhibitors.  
 Effect of wet heating on enzyme inhibitors 
There was a significant difference in the trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA), 
chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) and -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
interaction between legumes and the wet heating condition (p<0.001). The effect 
of wet heating treatment in reducing the trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase 
inhibitory activity are shown in Table 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8. In general, the wet heating 
treatment had markedly increased the trypsin inhibitory activity in tested 
legumes. While the heating effect on chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitory was 
varied depend on the legumes tested.  
There was a significant difference of trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) in the legumes 
with the wet heating condition (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.6, the trypsin 
inhibitory activity (TIA) of all tested legumes had increased significantly (p<0.001) 
after wet heated at 50C and 100C for 30 min. The raw legumes possessed the 
lowest TIA ranging from 0.042 to 0.171 TIA unit/mg. Interestingly, no detectable 
TIA was found for BEP, HB and BG. When heating at 50C was prolonged to 60 
min, all tested legumes showed further reduction in TIA. For heated SB, MB, and 
CP their TIA were similar to the TIA raw legumes. When heating at 100C was 
prolonged to 60 min, four legumes (MB, CP, HB, PP) were heat stable and showed 
no change in TIA. Whereas BG showed 58 % reduction in TIA, and three legumes 
(SB, AB, BEP) showed increased TIA. 
There was a significant difference of chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) in the 
legumes with the wet heating condition (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.7, the 
chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) of four legumes (MB, CP, BEP, HB) increased 
significantly (p<0.001) after heating at 50C for 30 min, except for BG which 
decreased by of 35 %. Whereas no significant change in CIA was detected for SB, 
AB, and PP. When heating duration was prolonged to 60 min, only SB, AB and PP 
showed further increase in CIA whilst MB, BEP, and HB decreased were still 
significantly higher than raw legumes, however BG reduced to a not detectable 
level. No significant change was detected for the CP. 
The majority of legumes heated at 100C for 30 min decreased CIA activity 
compared to raw legumes with a range of a 12 % decrease to not detectable level.  
The except were for CP, BEP, and HB which had an increase in the range 1.4 % to 
26 % relative to the raw legumes. When heating duration was prolonged to 60 
min, the CIA of MB increased of 15 % whilst SB decreased of 41 % relative to the 
raw legumes. For the remaining legumes, no change in CIA was detected for 
prolonged heating duration.  
There was a significant difference of -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
legumes with the wet heating condition (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.8, the -
amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) of five legumes (MB, AB, CP, BEP, BG) reduced 
significantly (p<0.001) after heating at 50C for 30 min, except for SB that showed 
an increment of 56 %. Whereas, no significant change in AIA was detected for HB 
and PP. When the heating duration was prolonged to 60 min, only SB, MB, and BG 
showed further increased in AIA whist PP decreased relative to 30 min. For the 
remaining legumes, no change in AIA was detected for prolonged heating 
duration. 
When the heating temperature was increased to 100C for 30 min, all tested 
legumes showed increased AIA in the range of 14 % to 76 % when compared to 
raw legumes, except for BG that which was reduced by 52 %. When heating 
duration was prolonged to 60 min, no significant changes was detected for all the 
legumes relative to 30 min.

There is a general consensus that proper wet heating treatments could inactivate 
heat labile ANFs and increase the availability of protein thereby improve the 
protein quality (Hefnawy, 2011). In this study, the increased of heating 
temperature to 100C had resulted in reduced chymotrypsin inhibitory activity. 
However, for trypsin and -amylase inhibitory activities there was an increase at 
100C when using the assays described in this project. As described in Morrison et 
al. (2007) study these enzyme inhibitors could be heat stable. The rigid and 
compact trypsin inhibitor protein structure is stabilised by seven disulphide 
linkages which allows it to be resistant to being denatured at high temperature 
(Sierra et al., 1999).  
Traditional wet heating process always focusses on simple boiling, using 100C to 
process the dried legume before consumption. In this study, 50C was also used 
with the aim of reducing energy usage whilst increasing the legumes palatability 
and reducing the enzyme inhibitors. Unfortunately, 50C increased TIA and CIA in 
the majority of the legumes particularly with shorter incubations (30 min). Wati et 
al. (2010) suggested when the temperature increased from 50 to 70C, the heat 
causes the trypsin inhibitor to loosen its compact structure which is normally 
stabilised by numerous of disulphide bonds. However, these conformational 
changes are reversible when cooled down to 25C. Therefore inhibitors possibly 
possess some degree of flexibility that allows them to regain their original 
conformation, and inhibitory activity immediately after being heated (Prasad et 
al., 2010).  
In brief, the low temperature wet heating (50C) with prolonged heating period 
(60 min) seems to be the best process method among the four to cook the dried 
legume even though the trypsin inhibitors are higher than the unprocessed 
legumes. From a practical standpoint, the low temperature wet heating having 
more advantages than the high temperature (100C) with prolonged heating 
period because high heat wet heating could induce chemical changes such as 
Maillard reaction which are associated with nutrient damage or formation of 
undesirable substances that maybe potentially problematic for health. This 
Maillard reaction between polysaccharides and protein can occur even under wet 
heating although the browning effect may not be seen (Han et al., 2017). Study 
done by Zhang et al. (2014) showed that the degree of browning effect occurred 
in soybeans was increased with time at wet heating (90C). The formation of 
Maillard reaction products such as high carboxymethyl lysine and acrylamide 
during processing not only affect protein digestibility but also could promote 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and induce cancer (Tamanna and Mahmood, 
2015; Seiquer et al., 2006). Thus, the determination of appropriate wet heating 
temperature and duration is a key aspect to provide consumer some insight in 
improving the overall nutritional value of legumes.  
 Effect of wet heating on protein content 
There was a significant difference in the protein content determined via Bradford 
method in the interaction between legumes and the wet heating condition 
(p<0.001). The protein content of wet heated legumes determined via Bradford 
method is presented in Table 4.9. Using this assay, the detectable protein content 
of all tested legumes was significantly reduced from 66 % to 85 % after heated at 
50C for 30 min. Whilst there is no significant change when heating duration was 
prolonged to 60 min. When heating temperature 100C for 30 min was used, a 
significant reduction in the protein content by 72 % to 89 % was observed when 
compared to raw legumes. All tested legumes showed further reduction to 73 % 
to 93 % after prolonged heating for 60 min. Aforementioned in soaking effect, the 
similar range of detectable protein content range 1.89  2.11 g/100g DW after 
heated at 50C could cause by limitation of Bradford reagent as heating might 
have changed the ion charged of the protein and losing its binding sensitivity. 
Current finding that heating treatment reduced protein content was in 
accordance with those reported by Candela et al. (1997) and Purcell and Wiliam 
(1982), who described how cooking led to a significant decrease in all amino acids 
in kidney bean, chickpea, lentils and sweet potatoes. During cooking, the heat will 
initiate a partial degradation of certain amino acid causing a reduction in protein 
content (Clawson and Taylor, 1993). Furthermore, severe heating can limit protein 
digestion and amino acid availability due to the modification of primary protein 
structure (Pedrosa et al., 2015). The wet heating treatment could cause 
denaturation of protein and followed by aggregation of the unfolded molecules 
which eventually results in loss of protein structure and functionality (Carbonaro 
et al., 1997).

When further study was carried out using Kjeldahl method (Table 4.10) the crude 
protein content is at least 4-fold higher than Bradford method. Again, there are 
no replicates in these values therefore no statistical comparison has been done. 
Only five legumes (SB, AB, BEP, PP, BG) showed reduction in crude protein 
content after heated at 50C for 30 min, whereas the remaining three legumes 
showed increment of 2.3 % to 9.2 % after heat treatment. Prolonged heating 
duration to 60 min had caused reduction in protein content for all tested legumes, 
except AB.  
When heating temperature was increased to 100C for 30 min, a significant 
reduction in the protein content by 2.4 % to 12.8 % was observed for all tested 
legumes, except for MB and AB relative to raw legumes. When heating duration 
was prolonged to 60 min, all tested legumes showed increment in protein content 
by 0.4 % to 10.5 %, except for BG relative to 100C for 30 min. Interestingly, only 
the crude protein content of mung bean was not affected by heat treatment at 
50C or 100C for 30 min or 60 min.

The increment of crude protein content was in agreement with studies done by 
Olanipekun et al. (2015) and Doss et al. (2011) on kidney bean and jack bean. In 
their studies, the crude protein of jack bean was increased by 1.7 % after wet 
heated at 100C for 20 min and further increased 13 % in kidney bean when 
prolonged to 3 h suggested that the wet heated treatment may break down the 
crude protein by unfolding the protein secondary, tertiary and quaternary 
structures to give primary structure which an apparent increase in crude protein 
content and potentially increases its digestibility (Awuah et al., 2007).  
4.3.3 Autoclaving 
Autoclaving is one of the common moist heat treatment method involving high 
temperature (121C) and high pressure (15 psi) (Habiba, 2002). The advantage of 
this pressure cooking is it requires less energy than boiling in an open pan and the 
heat can be distributed quickly and evenly (Gzel and Sayar, 2012). High pressure 
boiling and steaming is a promising technology and when applied to legumes has 
minor structural changes on small molecule nutrients such as amino acids, 
vitamins, and flavour compounds (He et al., 2014). However, it can induce 
extensive changes in structure of macronutrients such as protein and 
carbohydrate that could improves their texture, palatability and may enhance the 
nutritional value by gelatinisation of starch, denaturation of proteins, increased 
nutrient availability as well as and inactivating heat labile toxic compounds and 
other enzyme inhibitors thereby provide high quality of food products (Wang et 
al., 2009; Xu and Chang, 2008; Khatoon and Prakash, 2004). Besides, the use of 
high temperature under pressure also kills microorganisms and inactivates 
enzymes effectively to ensure legumes can be consumed safely (Verma et al., 
2012).  
 Effect of autoclaving on enzyme inhibitors 
There was a significant difference in the trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA), 
chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) and -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
interaction between legumes and autoclaving (p<0.001). The effect of autoclaving 
treatment in reducing the trypsin, chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitory activity 
are shown in Table 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13. In general, the autoclaving treatment had 
reduced the AIA in all tested legumes, and TIA and CIA in most of the legumes.  
There was a significant difference of trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) in the legumes 
with autoclaved (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.11, only MB showed significant 
reduction of 30 % TIA after autoclaving. The TIA of five legumes (SB, AB, BEP, HB, 
PP) increased significantly (p<0.001) after autoclaved was unexpectedly. Initially, 
no detectable TIA was found in raw BEP, HB, and BG. However, after autoclaved, 
the TIA of BEP and HB had increased to 0.217 TIA unit/mg and 0.234 TIA unit/mg 
respectively. Only BG had no detectable TIA. Whereas the TIA of CP was not 
significantly affected by autoclaving.  
Published studies reported that the autoclaved kidney bean, peas, lentils and 
tepary bean had either reduced or completely inactivated trypsin inhibitors 
(Hefnawy, 2011; Shimelis and Rakshit, 2007; Habiba, 2002; Osman et al., 2002). 
These finding were in accordance to the inactivation of TIA in MB in the current 
study. Nevertheless, five autoclaved legumes tested in this study were detected 
with increased TIA. Dokka et al. (2015) suggested that the presence of crude fibre 
and phytic acid might safeguard the trypsin inhibitor against moist heat 
treatment. 
There was a significant difference of chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) in the 
legumes with autoclaved (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.12, five out of eight 
legumes showed significantly reduced of CIA after autoclaving the range of 
reduction being 24.55 % to 57.54 %, and for BG this was to non-detectable level. 
Only autoclaved CP showed increment in CIA by 49.66 %. Whereas the CIA of HB 
and PP were not affected by the autoclaving process.  
The CIA content of tested legumes except for CP in current studied was in 
agreement with studies reported by Sathya and Siddhuraju (2015) and Tan et al. 
(1984) stated that autoclaved Parkia seeds and winged bean had either reduced 
or complete inactivated of chymotrypsin inhibitors.  
There was a significant difference of -amylase inhibitory activity in the legumes 
with autoclaved (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.13, autoclaving process had 
successfully reduced the AIA in all tested legumes by a range of 29 % to 99 % 
relative to raw legume. Autoclaved BG had the highest AIA of 0.161 AIA unit/mg, 
whilst the rest had less than 0.042 AIA unit/mg. 
Similar to CIA, several published studies reported that the autoclaved peas, mung 
bean, sorghum seeds and mucuna seeds had either reduced or complete 
inactivation of -amylase inhibitors (Kavitha et al., 2015; Habiba, 2002; Siddhuraju 
et al., 1996; Mulimani and Supriya, 1993). These findings were in agreement to 
the reduction of AIA in the tested legumes.  
Autoclaving process had reduced the CIA and AIA more effectively than TIA as 
majority of the tested legumes had decreased amount of CIA and AIA whilst TIA 
was only decreased in MB. The reduction in the inhibitors activity could be 
because they are heat labile and degrade upon pressure cooking (Sathya and 
Siddhuraju, 2015).

 Effect of autoclaving on protein content 
There was a significant difference in the protein content determined via Bradford 
method in the interaction between legumes and autoclaved (p<0.001). The 
protein content of autoclaved legumes determined via Bradford method is 
presented in Table 4.14. The protein content of all tested legumes was 
significantly reduced with a range of 88.56 % to 96.42 % after heated at 121C for 
15 min. Again, it is noticeable the autoclaved legumes had reduced to a similar 
concentration range 0.46  0.69 g/100g DW whilst at the raw samples their range 
was 5.70  13.55 g/100g DW. Aforementioned this is because the autoclaving 
have changed the ion charged of the protein and causing them to lose their 
binding sensitivity which is one of the limitation of Bradford reagent.  
Hefnawy (2011) and Siddhuraju and Becker (2005) reported a 4.3  17.1 % 
reduction of amino acid particularly arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, 
tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and isoleucine residues in autoclaved lentils 
and mucuna seed. Therefore, in current study; the losses in protein content could 
be attributed to partial degradation of certain amino acid along with other 
nitrogenous compounds cause by the heat destruction.

When further study was carried out using Kjeldahl method (Table 4.15) without 
replications, therefore no statistical comparison could be done. Only three 
legumes (HB, PP, BG) had reduced estimated crude protein with a range of 1.02 % 
to 7.52 % reduction. Whereas the remaining five legumes had an increase range 
of estimated crude protein of 0.29 % to 12.48 % after autoclaving.

To date, and to the extent of our knowledge, there was no existing research 
identifying an increasing of crude protein content in autoclaved legumes. A 
possible explanation for the increment of crude protein content could be due to 
the unfolding of protein secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures making 
the more protein accessible for assessment of protein concentration. However 
the assessment of protein content had no replication therefore the increase seen 
after autoclaving could within the variance for the measurements, the values 
being within ~10 % of each other. The published studies either reported no 
significant changes or minimal reduction of crude protein content in autoclaved 
legumes (Dsouza, 2013; Osman, 2007; Mubarak, 2005; Rehman et al., 2001). 
4.3.4 Dry freezing 
Freezing serve as an ancient technology that have been used extensively to 
preserve foods such as meat, vegetables, fruits, and milk products (Chemat et al., 
2011; Archer, 2004). It plays a curial role in ensuring the safety of food products 
and retaining the quality such as taste, texture, and nutritional of foods better 
than any other preservation method over long storage periods (Mok et al., 2015; 
George, 1993). This is because freezing not only prevents the growth of microbe 
but also avoid the usage of preservatives or additives in extending shelf life 
(Archer, 2004). If the freezing process has been done properly by controlling the 
freezing rate, least chemical changes will occur within the food and nutrients will 
be well preserved (Xue et al., 2017). To our knowledge, there was no literature 
being published on the effect of dry freezing method towards the ANFs and 
nutritional component in legumes. 
 Effect of dry freezing on enzyme inhibitors 
There was a significant difference in the trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA), 
chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) and -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
interaction between legumes and dry freezing treatment (p<0.001). The effect of 
24 h dry freezing treatment at -20C and -80C in reducing the trypsin, 
chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitory activity are shown in Table 4.16, 4.17 and 
4.18. In general, the effect of dry freezing on trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase 
inhibitory activity varied according to the legumes tested.  
There was a significant difference of trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) in the legumes 
with dry freezing treatment (p<0.001). As showed in Table 4.16, the TIA of all 
tested legumes increased significantly (p<0.05) after stored at -20C or -80C, 
except for CP and MB. The TIA of CP stored at -20C was not significantly different 
from raw CP but was increased by -80C and the TIA of MB stored at -80C was 
not significantly different from raw MB, although after -20C it was. As described 
previously early, no detectable TIA was found in raw BEP, HB, and BG. However, 
after dry-freezing storage, the TIA of BEP, HB, and BG had increased with values 
ranging from 0.159 TIA unit/mg to 0.243 TIA unit/mg after exposure to -20C, and 
a range of 0.081 TIA unit/mg to 0.157 TIA unit/mg after -80C. 
There was a significant difference of chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) in the 
legumes with dry freezing treatment (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.17, only SB 
and PP showed significant reduction of 12.27 % and 26.61 % CIA after stored at -
20C. After stored at -20C MB, AB, BEP, and BG increased CIA in the range of 
22.26 % to 52.91 %. Whereas, the CIA of CP and HB were not affected by the 
freeze storage. When temperature dropped to -80C, the CIA of all treated 
legumes had no significant difference from the raw legumes, except for CP where 
CIA was detected. 
There was a significant difference of -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
legumes with dry freezing treatment (p<0.001). As shown in Table 4.18, the dry 
freezing process significantly reduced the AIA in SB by 88 % irrespective of the 
freezing temperature. Whereas for BG stored at -20C, no significant change in 
AIA was detected but at -80C, it was reduced by 7.33 % when compared to raw 
BG. For the remaining legumes, the range of increases was in the range of 38 % to 
76 % relative to raw legumes when considering the effects of both storage at  
-20C and -80C.

Freezing can affect the food texture, especially in slow freezing encourages the 
formation of non-uniform ice crystal and produces larger ice crystals through 
condensation of solutes, this is to cell membrane breakage resulting in irreversible 
cell wall collapse and tissue breakage (Xue et al., 2017; Mok et al., 2015; 
Chassagne-Berces et al., 2009). However, dried legumes have of relatively low 
water content and presumably there is a lower extent of structural damage 
caused by freezing (Li and Sun, 2002). Therefore, it is expected that the process of 
dry freezing might not be able to reduce the enzyme inhibitors effectively as the 
process tends to break open the structure of the material rather than denature it. 
The reasons for the unexpected large increase in TIA levels in dry frozen legumes 
of -20C and -80C remains obscure. The break open of legume structure might 
possibly allow more TIA was being extracted.  
 Effect of dry freezing on protein content 
There was a significant difference in the protein content determined via Bradford 
method in the interaction between legumes and dry freezing treatment (p<0.001). 
The protein content of frozen legumes determined via Bradford method is 
presented in Table 4.19. The protein content of all tested legumes was 
significantly reduced in the range of 69 % to 86.96 % when examining storage of 
both at -20C or -80C. Only BG of all the legumes showed significant reduction in 
protein content when the temperature was reduced from -20C to -80C. The 
values for dry frozen legume at -20C to -80C were similar range 1.76  1.95 
g/100g DW could be related to the limitation of Bradford reagent. 
Surprisingly, the dry frozen legumes showed a drastic reduction of protein 
content availability particularly arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, 
tryptophan, and tyrosine regardless at temperature of -20C or -80C when 
compared to untreated legumes. This is because freezing is the pre-step of the 
freeze-drying process and it is known to be the best way to preserve almost all the 
nutrients in food (Zhang et al., 2014). Theoretically, the process of dry frozen 
would not be expected to have such a big impact on the protein content, since the 
formation of ice crystallisation which will lead to structural damage not significant 
chemical damage such as strong denaturing of proteins.

Thus, further study was carried out using Kjeldahl method (Table 4.20); there are 
no replicates in this observation thus there is no statistical comparison has been 
done. Only two legumes (SB and AB) showed 3.47 % to 6.9 % of reduction in crude 
protein content after stored at -20C. Whereas the remaining frozen legumes 
showed increases in the range of 0.12 % to 5.89 % crude protein content. When 
the temperature reduced further to -80C, five legumes showed reduction in 
crude protein in the range of 3.33 % to 6 %. Whereas, MB, AB, and CP showed had 
an increase in the range 0.58 % to 2.25 % of crude protein content. Even so, the 
increased or decreased of crude protein content could be within the variance for 
the measurements since there is no replication in the crude protein assessment.

Aforementioned, the nature of dried legume contained of low water content and 
presumably lower extend of structural damage caused by the formation of ice 
crystallisation. In this study, the nutritive value of crude proteins in most of the  
-20C dry frozen legume and part of the -80C dry frozen legume was found to be 
slightly higher than unprocessed legume. It was also noticeable that part of the 
dry frozen legumes had minor crude protein loss had been detected.  
4.4 Summary 
Current study revealed that the effective operational parameters that could 
reduce the enzyme inhibitors (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitors) 
present in underutilised legumes are by soaking (6 h), wet heating (50C for 60 
min), autoclaving (121C and 15 psi for 15 min) and dry freezing (-80C), 
respectively. Under the optimum operational parameters, the underutilised 
legumes were able to retain their nutritive values in term of protein content. 
However, no single treatment was capable to completely eliminate the enzyme 
inhibitors in tested legumes.  
CHAPTER 5 
EFFECT OF COMBINED PROCESSING METHODS IN REDUCING ENYZME 
INHIBITORS PRESENT IN UNDERUTILISED LEGUMES 
5.1 Introduction 
In pervious Chapter 4, four operational parameters, namely soaking, wet heating, 
autoclaving and dry freezing were used to reduce enzyme inhibitors found in 
legumes. Nevertheless, findings suggested that the individual parameter were not 
able to reduce all enzyme inhibitors effectively, and very often the reduction 
efficiency was dependent on the legume. Hence, four processing methods tested 
in Chapter 4 had the strongest ability to reduce enzyme inhibitors and retain 
protein in legumes were chosen in current study:  
(i) soaking for 6 h at 25C  
(ii) wet heating 50C for 60 min 
(iii) autoclaving at 121C at 15 psi for 15 min  
(iv) dry freezing at -80C for 24 h 
This chapter aim to optimise the removal of enzyme inhibitors while retaining 
nutrients by using combined processing method. For optimisation purpose, only 
three underutilised legumes (adzuki bean, mung bean, bambara groundnut) and 
soybean (control) were used.  
The specific objectives of this chapter were: 
 To investigate the combined processing method(s) based on any two of 
the above-mentioned methods to remove the enzyme inhibitors 
 To investigate the effect of combine processing method on the protein 
content 
The hypothesis for the research carried out in this chapter is the combined 
methods, which involve a combination of wet heating and autoclaving process, 
will completely eliminate the enzyme inhibitor in underutilised legumes without 
altering the protein content.  
5.2 Experimental design 
5.2.1 Combination of processing treatments 
The dried legumes were purchased from the same single source. Similar to 
Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, all the dried legumes had not underwent dehulling 
process before subjected to the below combined processing method. Each of the 
combined processing methods was performed in triplicate for each type of 
legumes. 
a) Soaking and wet heating (S+W) 
The dried legumes were soaked in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) for 6 h at room 
temperature (25C) immediately followed by heating at 50C for 60 min in the 
same soaking medium. After heating the associated liquid was poured away, the 
processed legumes were allowed to cool to room temperature and chilled 
overnight at 4C, before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h.  
b) Soaking and autoclaving (S+A) 
The dried legumes were soaked in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) for 6 h at room 
temperature (25C), immediately followed by autoclaving at 121C, 15 psi for 15 
min in the same soaking medium. After autoclaving the associated liquid was 
poured away, the processed legumes were allowed to cool to room temperature 
and chilled overnight at 4C, before frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
c) Soaking and dry freezing (S+D) 
The dried legumes were soaked in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) for 6 h at room 
temperature (25C). The water was immediately drained, and the legumes were 
chilled overnight at 4C before frozen at -80C for 24 h. 
d) Wet heating and autoclaving (W+A) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) which were then 
heated at 50C for 60 min then immediately followed by autoclaving at 121C, 15 
psi for 15 min in the same medium. After autoclaving the associated liquid was 
poured away, the processed legumes were allowed to cool to room temperature 
and chilled overnight at 4C, before frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
e) Wet heating and dry freezing (W+D) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)), this was then 
heated at 50C for 60 min. The water was immediately drained, and the legumes 
were chilled overnight at 4C before frozen at -80C for 24 h. 
f) Wet heating and soaking (W+S) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)), this was then 
heated at 50C for 60 min. The wet heated legumes in distilled water was allowed 
to cool to room temperature (25C) under running tap water and followed by 
soaking for 6 h. After soaking the associated liquid was poured away and the 
processed legumes chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
g) Autoclaving and dry freezing (A+D) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)), this was then 
autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. The water was immediately drained, and 
the legumes were chilled overnight at 4C before frozen at -80C for 24 h. 
h) Autoclaving and wet heating (A+W) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)), this was then 
autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. The autoclaved legumes in distilled water 
was allowed to cool to room temperature (25C) under running tap water and 
followed by heating at 50C for 60 min. After heating the associated liquid was 
poured away, the processed legumes were allowed to cool to room temperature 
and chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
i) Autoclaving and soaking (A+S) 
To dried legumes was added distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)), this was then 
autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. The autoclaved legumes in distilled water 
was allowed to cool to room temperature (25C) under running tap water and 
followed by soaking for 6 h. After soaking the associated liquid was poured away 
and the processed legumes chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC 
for 24 h. 
j) Dry freezing and soaking (D+S) 
The dried legumes were frozen at -80C for 24 h and immediately followed by 
soaking in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) for 6 h at room temperature (25C). 
After soaking the associated liquid was poured away and the processed legumes 
chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
k) Dry freezing and wet heating (D+W) 
The dried legumes were frozen at -80C for 24 h and immediately followed by 
heating in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) at 50C for 60 min. After heating the 
associated liquid was poured away and the processed legumes allowed to cool to 
room temperature and chilled overnight at 4C before being frozen at -80oC for 24 
l) Dry freezing and autoclaving (D+A) 
The dried legumes were frozen at -80C for 24 h followed by immediately 
autoclaving in distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. After 
autoclaving the associated liquid was poured away and the processed legumes 
allowed to cool to room temperature and chilled overnight at 4C before being 
frozen at -80oC for 24 h. 
All the frozen samples were lyophilised for 24 h using freeze-dryer (Alpha 1-4 LD 
plus, Christ). The lyophilised legumes were then ground into powder form using a 
miller without going through dehulling process. The fine powder was then to pass 
through a series of mesh sieves with the size of 1.68 m, 1.18 m and 0.85 m. 
The powder that was stopped on 1.18 m mesh sieve was collected and stored in 
4C chiller up to 2 weeks prior to analysis for enzyme inhibitors and nutrients. 
5.2.2 Enzyme inhibitors and nutrient determination  
The trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitors present in the raw and 
processed dried samples were determined according to sections 2.3.1  2.3.2. The 
protein content of raw and processed dried samples was determined according to 
section 2.4.1a  2.4.1b. In this study, both Bradford and Kjeldahl protein 
determination methods were used to determine the soluble amino acids in 
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and total crude protein respectively. All assay was 
carried out in triplicate. 
5.2.3 Statistical analysis 
The results were presented as mean  standard error mean (SEM) which had 
carried out in triplicate. IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22, IBM 
Corporation, USA) was used to perform two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on 
data sets and where this was statistical significant (p<0.05) subsequent post-hoc 
analysis was carried out using Duncans Multiple Comparison test confidence 
intervals of 95 % with threshold for significance when p<0.05. Data was checked 
for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test, where stated, none normally distributed 
data was transformed (square root) before statistical analysis was performed. 
Data was checked for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test.  
5.3 Results and discussion 
For this chapter results are presented in two parts. Section 5.3.1 reports the effect 
of combined methods on enzyme inhibitors, whilst section 5.3.2 reported the 
effects of combined methods on protein content in underutilised legumes. The 4 
optimised parameters had formed into 12 combined processing methods and 
these combined methods could possibility removed the enzyme inhibitors more 
effectively than the individual process. It is noteworthy that the processing 
sequences might be able to manipulate the efficiency in removal of anti-
nutritional factors in legumes. Thus, the different sequence of combined 
processing method seems to be a necessity to examine their efficiency in removal 
of anti-nutritional factors in legumes.  
5.3.1 Effect of combined methods on enzyme inhibitors 
There was a significant interaction between combined treatments and legumes 
for the trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA), chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) and 
-amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) (p<0.001). The effect of 12 combined methods 
on the trypsin, chymotrypsin and -amylase inhibitors are shown in Table 5.1, 5.2, 
and 5.3. In general, the effect of these methods on the enzyme inhibitors are 
legume specific.  
There was a significant difference of trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) in the legumes 
with the combined treatments (p<0.001). Table 5.1 showed the TIA of the 
legumes treated with the 12 combined methods. For mung bean, eight methods 
have successfully reduced the TIA with a range of 31.6  83.6 %, with the greatest 
reduction by W+S method with only D+S method showed 21.2 % increase. For 
adzuki bean and bambara groundnut, majority of the treatments significantly 
increased TIA with a range of 37.8  77.5 % and 2.2  15 %, respectively for each 
legume. Only D+A showed 100 % of reduction in TIA of adzuki bean to non-
detectable activity, whilst no reduction of TIA was detected in bambara 
groundnut for this method. For soybean, only D+A showed reduction to non-
detectable TIA, whilst S+A, S+D, W+A, W+D, D+S and D+W increased TIA with a 
range of 45.9  67.2 %. Whereas no significant change in TIA was detected for the 
remaining methods.

Various combined treatments with different conditions have been attempted by 
researchers to inactivate the ANFs present in legumes (Luo and Xie, 2013; 
Hefnawy, 2011; Wang et al., 2008; Shimelis and Rakshit, 2007; Vijayakumari et al., 
2007; Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003; Chau and Cheung, 1997). Most of these 
methods involve soaking legumes combined with another intervention, such as 
some sort of heating. Only limited number of studies were found which had used 
the S+A method, however due to the variation in treatment duration and medium 
used, it is hard to compare these findings directly. To authors knowledge, no 
relevant published literature is available for the remaining methods used in this 
study. 
A study done by Abd El-Hady and Habiba (2003) showed TIA of various legumes 
reduced to undetectable level after a soaking and extrusion process. The studies 
reported by Luo and Xie (2013), Shimelis and Rakshit (2007) and Chau and Cheung 
(1997) showed that the trypsin inhibitors were reduced up to 50 % using the 
combined process of soaking and cooking and 75 % by using soaking and 
autoclaving. Using high heat, the TIA of pre-soaked legumes could be reduced 
effectively. This observation was in accordance with current finding in mung bean, 
adzuki bean and bambara groundnut under the treatment of S+A.  
There was a significant difference of chymotrypsin inhibitory activity (CIA) in the 
legumes with the combined treatments (p<0.001). Table 5.2 shows the CIA of 
legumes treated with the 12 combined methods. Overall, six combined methods 
(S+A, W+A, A+D, A+W, A+S, D+A) were able to reduce the CIA of all four legumes 
however the range was 55.5  100 %. Only W+D increased CIA of all the legumes 
with a range of 17.4  37.9 %. 
For adzuki bean, nine methods reduced the CIA significantly. Six methods, namely 
S+A, W+A, A+D, A+W, A+S and, D+A reduced the CIA completely, whereas three 
methods (W+S, D+S, and D+W) gave a reduction with a range of 28.9  49.5 %. 
Whereas S+W, S+D and W+D method did not change CIA. For bambara 
groundnut, seven methods reduced the CIA significantly. Four methods, namely 
W+A, A+D, A+W, and A+S reduced the CIA completely, whereas three methods 
(S+A, W+S, and D+A) had a 57.1  62.3 % range of reduction. Three methods 
(S+W, S+D, and W+D) showed increased CIA with a range of 37.9  51.3 %, 
whereas the remaining methods had no significant effect. For soybean, six 
methods reduced the CIA significantly. Only the A+D method reduced the CIA 
completely, whereas five methods (S+A, W+A, A+W, A+S, and D+A) exhibited 45.8 
 86.3 % range of reduction. Three methods (S+W, S+D, and D+W) increased CIA 
with a range of 23.8  49.2 %. Whereas the remaining methods had no significant 
change on CIA. For mung bean, seven methods (S+A, W+A, W+S, A+D, A+W, A+S, 
and D+A) reduced the CIA significantly with a range of 33.3  71.3 %. However, no 
complete reduction was detected. The methods S+D increased of CIA by 19.7 %.  
The remaining methods had no significant change on CIA.

Cooking of pre-soaked legumes could completely remove the CIA (Shi et al., 
2017). In current study, the thermal processes used to heat the pre-soaked 
legumes were wet heating and autoclaving, but not ordinary cooking that boiled 
the legumes in water for a certain period until tenderness of seeds was achieved 
(Kaushik et al., 2010). Under the treatment of S+A, the CIA of pre-soaked legumes 
had the maximum reduction especially in adzuki bean. Similar results have also 
been reported by Siddhuraju and Becker (2005) and Mulimani and Paramjyothi 
(1994) in pre-soaked red gram and mucuna beans, where the CIA  was completely 
destroyed under the treatment of cooking and autoclaving. 
There was a significant difference of -amylase inhibitory activity (AIA) in the 
legumes with the combined treatments (p<0.001). Table 5.3 showed the AIA of 
the legumes treated with the 12 combined methods. Overall, six combine 
methods (S+A, W+A, A+D, A+W, A+S, D+A) were able to reduce the AIA of all four 
legumes with a range of 69.6  99.3 %. This finding was similar to CIA. However, 
no complete reduction of AIA was detected with any method with any legume. All 
legumes showed significant reduction with a range of 22.8  99.3 % after 
treatment with the 12 methods, except for soybean. 
For soybean, six methods (S+A, W+A, A+D, A+W, A+S, and D+A) reduced the AIA 
significantly with a range of 98.4  99.3 %. Only S+D method had no significant 
change on AIA, whereas the remaining five methods increased AIA with a range of 
22.7  59.7 %.

Shi et al. (2017) reported an 80 to 93 % reduction of -amylase inhibitory activity 
in a wide range of pre-soaked legumes with cooking. Whilst Chau and Cheung 
(1997) also found that cooking of pre-soaked legumes and autoclaving of pre-
soaked legumes caused 15 to 20 % reduction in -amylase inhibitory activity 
respectively. Data from current study in all the legumes under the treatment of 
S+A was in line with these results.  
In general, S+A treatment was able to reduce the enzyme inhibitors (TIA, CIA, and 
AIA) in the tested legumes. This might because the process of soaking facilitates 
water imbibition and aiding the thermolabile inhibitors to be inactivated under 
high heat treatment. It is noticeable that the combination treatments which 
involved autoclaving process (S+A, W+A, A+D, A+W, A+S, and D+A) brought a 
significant lower or completely reduce of enzyme inhibitors than other 
combination methods. Out of these six combined methods, D+A was able to 
reduce the enzyme inhibitors effectively in all the tested legumes.  
5.3.2 Effect of combined methods on protein content 
The crude protein content of legumes treated with 12 combined methods via 
Kjeldahl method are shown in Table 5.4. There was no significant interaction 
between combined treatments and legumes on the crude protein content 
(p=0.590). Finding suggested that the 12 methods used had no significant effect 
on the crude protein of legume relative to raw legume.  
The current finding of legume treated with soaking and autoclaving (S+A) was in 
accordance with the studies reported by various researchers (Ramadan, 2012; 
Hefnawy, 2011; Alajaji and El-Adawy, 2006; Siddhuraju and Becker, 2005). They 
stated that S+A process had no significant change in the detectable crude protein 
of soybean, lentils, mucuna beans and chickpea.

The protein content of legumes treated with 12 combined methods assessed via 
Bradford method are shown in Table 5.5. There was a significant interaction 
between combined treatments and legumes in the protein content (p<0.001). The 
12 methods used significantly reduced the detectable protein content of soybean, 
mung bean, adzuki bean and bambara groundnut with a range of 61.2  95.8 %.  
As discussed in Chapter 3 earlier, Bradford method uses Coomassie brilliant blue 
G-250 dye which only detects basic and aromatic type of amino acids arginine and 
lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine (Nielsen, 2010; Compton 
and Jones, 1985). Current finding suggested that this group of amino acids were 
affected by these 12 methods, and not the crude protein content (determined by 
Kjeldahl). Other than that, the Coomasie dye had been reported to bind with 
proteins and polypeptides > 3000 Da only (Moore et al., 2010). Ten out of twelve 
combined methods used thermal processing, either wet heating or autoclaving, 
which could have hydrolysed the proteins into a small size peptide which is 
undetectable by using Bradford method.  
Current results suggested that the combination of two processing methods had 
strengthened the removal of enzyme inhibitors, whilst retaining the crude protein 
content of the four legumes tested. Out of twelve combined methods, D+A 
method was the most efficient method to process the tested legumes. The 
retention of crude protein content after a combined treatment was one of the 
major considerations for selecting a process and ingredient(s) that could be used 
aquafeed. Thus, adzuki bean and bambara groundnut were determined as the 
best candidates for use as an aquafeed since D+A method did not significantly 
affect the crude protein. Besides, using this combined method, both legumes 
possessed the lowest TIA, CIA, and AIA relative to soybean and mung bean.

5.4 Summary 
This study was looking at the effect of combined two processing methods in reducing 
enzyme inhibitors (TIA, CIA, and AIA) whilst retaining the crude protein in the 
underutilised legumes. Compared to single methods of processing, it appeared that 
the combined methods had strengthened the removal of enzyme inhibitors with no 
effect on crude protein content. However, the efficiency of each combined method 
was influenced by the types of legumes tested. Under the treatment of dry freezing 
and autoclaving (D+A), adzuki bean and bambara groundnut possessed the lowest 
enzyme inhibitors content but maintained their crude protein content.  
CHAPTER 6 
SUBSTITUTION OF LEGUME MEAL ON THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND 
INTESTINAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE OF ZEBRAFISH 
6.1 Introduction 
The progressive increasing  demands of the carnivorous fish farming industry for the 
finite resources of fish meal and fish oil has stimulated investigations into the 
potential of using plant-based aquafeed as an alternative (Hill et al., 2013). Over the 
last few decades, to reduce the reliance of fish meal as a protein source, researchers 
had made many efforts in partially replacing fish meal in aquafeeds with alternative 
plant protein source such as soybean, canola seed, pea, and broad bean. 
However, the prime concern with these major crops is the global production yield has 
been declining and in the long run production is probably unsustainable due to global 
climate change (Chivenge et al., 2015; Ebert, 2014). In order to reduce the over-
reliance on major crops and to ensure future food security and sustainability, the 
development of ANF-free plant-based aquafeed using underutilised legumes is 
essential.  
In the preliminary study describe in this chapter, zebrafish were used as in vivo study 
as an established fish model. Zebrafish were used rather than a farmed fish species 
due to the feasibility of using greater number of fish with more treatments as the 
trials could be carried out at a lower cost and for shorter duration. Also there is a 
more substantial background literature on zebrafish than farmed fish, particularly at 
a molecular level (Dahm and Geisler, 2006). This level of information supported the 
associated objective of study which sought to investigate the impact of altering the 
feed ingredients on the gene expression response of zebrafish.  
The ultimate application of any changes in aquafeed would be in the commercially 
valuable farm species Asian seabass. Undeniably, zebrafish is not perfect for the 
evaluation of the immune response, due to the structural differences in digestive 
system of zebrafish and Asian seabass. Zebrafish has long intestine and no true 
stomach, while carnivorous fish have a true stomach and short intestine. 
Nevertheless, current study serves as a good baseline study to better understanding 
on the effect of these legume-based ingredients prior to Asian seabass trial. 
Based on the findings in Chapter 5, two legumes  adzuki bean and bambara 
groundnut were selected as the potential pant-based ingredients for substitution in 
zebrafish aquafeed. This chapter aimed to investigate the effect of adzuki bean and 
bambara groundnut with reduced enzyme inhibitors on the growth performance and 
intestinal inflammatory response of zebrafish.  
The specific aims of this study were: 
 To investigate the growth performance of zebrafish fed with legume meals 
with reduced enzyme inhibitors 
 To investigate the zebrafish intestinal inflammatory response via the gene 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gut  interleukins il-1 and 
Current hypothesis proposed that the aquafeed containing legumes which are 
processed to reduce enzyme inhibitors will has higher digestibility compared to feed 
containing unprocessed legumes. This will result in the zebrafish on these feeds 
performing better on the processed legume-based feeds than the unprocessed feeds, 
hence would have relatively enhanced growth. This enhanced growth will be 
associated with reduced expression inflammatory signal genes.  
6.2 Experimental design 
6.2.1 Ethical issues 
This study was conducted in University of Liverpool. The zebrafish were housed using 
standard aquarium methods and fed on balanced diets formulated to meet 
nutritional requirements or exceed the minimum nutritional needs; therefore, there 
was no requirement for ethical clearance to carry out this trial according to the 
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA). Advice was sought from the Home 
Office of University of Liverpool who confirmed that these experiments were sub-
threshold and did not require a project licence. Local AWERB (Animal Welfare and 
Ethical Review Body) approval was obtained before work started. Experiments were 
carried out by trained technical staff under direct supervision of an experienced 
supervisor and fish welfare was checked daily by the facility NACWO (Nominated 
Animal Care and Welfare Officer). The fish were bred at the University of Liverpool 
zebrafish facility and so endured minimal transport or housing stress prior to this 
experiment starting. However, throughout the experiment welfare was monitored 
and if reached an unacceptable level the fish affected were removed from the 
experiment.  
6.2.2 Zebrafish 
250 zebrafish (approximately 2 months old) were used for the study and were 
housed under the conditions listed in section 2.6.1 at University of Liverpool. Five 
replicate tanks were given the same experimental diet, 50 fish in total per diet 
consisting of mixtures of male and female were distributed equal across the tanks, 
n=10 per tank. The fish was acclimatised in the tanks for 1 week before the starting 
of fish feeding trial. The fish feeding trial was carried out for six weeks and the body 
weight was taking weekly to record growth throughout and the length was only 
measured at the end of the study as described in section 2.6.1a. The fish were fed 
once at 4 % body weight per day. At the end of feeding trial, the fish were culled and 
tissue were collected as listed in section 2.6.1b.  
6.2.3 Feed ingredients and diet formulation 
The different experimental diets differed in the legume they contained, either adzuki 
bean or bambara groundnut which had be treated or not. The four diets being 
identified as untreated adzuki bean (RAB), treated adzuki bean (PAB), untreated 
bambara groundnut (RBG) or treated bambara groundnut (PBG). The PAB and PBG 
were treated by using the process of dry freezing and autoclaving (D+A). The dried 
legumes without underwent the dehulling process were frozen at -80C for 24 h 
which were subsequently had distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) added to them before 
it reached room temperature. The legumes were then autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 
15 min. After autoclaving the associated liquid was poured away and the legumes 
were cooled to room temperature and chilled overnight at 4C. The chilled legumes 
were frozen at -80C for 24 h then lyophilised for 24 h using freeze-dryer (Alpha 1-4 
LD plus, Christ). The lyophilised legumes were then ground into powder form using a 
miller. The fine powder was then to pass through a series of mesh sieves with the 
size of 1.68 m, 1.18 m and 0.85 m. The powder that was stopped on 1.18 m 
mesh sieve was collected and stored in 4C chiller prior incorporated to the 
aquafeed.  
The material chemical composition data and the amino acid content are presented in 
Table 6.1. Four experimental diets were formulated: T1, T2, T3, and T4 to reduce fish 
meal (FM) content by 10 % (w/w), but retain the same nutrient content, by replacing 
this one of the following ingredients RAB, PAB, RBG or PBG, respectively (Table 6.2). 
As a control, a basal diet (T0) was formulated so that did not contain any legumes. 
The nutritional profile of diets was presented in Table 6.3. The diet was formulated 
using a model of best fit programme by Dr Iain Young and Mr Kieran Magee from 
Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool. The desired amounts of all 
ingredients required were mixed using a Hobart food mixer until thoroughly mixed. 
Water was added until the mixture achieved dough like consistency. The dough 
mixture was then spread out on trays and dried for 24 h at 50C using a nine shelf 
Parallexx Excalibur food dehydrator. Once dry the diet was crushed and processed 
through a series of sieves with apertures of 850 m and 425 m. The desired pellet 
size fell between the two. All diets were stored at 4C.

6.2.4 Chemical analysis 
All ingredients and formulated diet were analysed for dry matter, crude protein, 
crude lipid, ash, crude fibre, gross energy, and amino acid according to the procedure 
described in Chapter 2 (section 2.4.1 to 2.4.8). 
6.2.5 Growth performance indices  
a) Weight gain 
Weight gain is defined as an increased in body weight and it was calculated as: 
Weight gain = Final weight of fish (g)  Initial weight of fish (g) 
b) Average daily gain (ADG) 
Average daily gain is defined as the rate of weight gain (mg) per day over a specified 
period. It was calculated as: 
ADG (mg/day) = (Final weight of fish  Initial weight of fish) / feeding days 
c) Specific growth rate (SGR) 
The specific growth rate is the growth that achieved per day during feeding period. 
SGR (%) = 100 x (LnW2  LnW1) x (t2  t1)-1 
Notes: 
Ln  natural log 
W1  initial weight 
W2  final weight 
t1  starting time point (day one) 
t2  end time point (final day number) 
d) Feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
Feed conversion ratio is used to indicate the efficiency at which feed is converted 
into animal biomass, calculated as below: 
FCR = Feed consumed (g) / Weight gain (g) 
The assumption is that all the feed put in the tank is completely eaten by the fish 
since the feed was not given on an ad lib basis. The feed was given based on the 
weight of the fish which is 4 % of the fish body weight per day.  
e) Protein conversion ratio (PCR) 
Protein conversion ratio is the ratio of protein in the diet to total animal production 
and it was calculated as: 
PCR = FCR x (% Feed protein / 100 %) 
f) Fultons condition factor (k index) 
Fultons conditions factor is commonly used in fisheries science to measure an 
individual fishs health that uses the relationship of fish weight and length to overall 
condition.  
k = (Weight (g) / Length3 (mm)) x 105 
6.2.6 Gene expression analysis 
For each treatment group (n=10 fish), the intestines (< 30 mg) from five fish were 
pooled and submerged in 500 L of RNAlater and stored at -80C until further 
analysis. The RNA was extracted from pooled intestines from each treatment group 
according to method as described in Chapter 2 (section 2.51 and 2.5.2). Expression of 
interleukins il-1 and il-8 were used as markers of an activated inflammatory 
response and these genes were determined by quantitative reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as described in Chapter 2 (section 2.5.4 and 
2.5.6).  
The sequences of il-1 (NM_212844.2), il-8 (XM_001342570.5) and -actin 
(NM_131031.1) were obtained from NCBI GenBank Database. Each gene was tested 
in quintuplicate. The mean Cp values from each sample were normalised against the 
mean Cp value of a reference gene (-actin, housekeeping gene). The melting curve 
was used to ensure that a single product was amplified and confirm the absence of 
primer-dimer. The relative quantification of each gene was obtained with Pfaffls 
method using the fish fed with control diet (T0) as the reference, this reference was 
compared to the treatments (Pfaffl, 2004). 
6.2.7 Statistical analysis 
All the results were presented as mean  standard error mean (SEM), tank replicated 
(n=5). IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22, IBM Corporation, USA) was used to 
perform one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on data sets and where this was 
statistical significant (p<0.05) subsequent post-hoc analysis was carried out using 
Duncans Multiple Comparison test with confidence intervals of 95 % with threshold 
for significance when p<0.05. Data was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test 
and for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test. Graphs were constructed 
using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software Inc, USA). 
6.3 Results and discussion 
As mentioned in Chapter 1 (section 1.8), zebrafish was selected as fish model for 
quick analysis of alternative aquafeed ingredients with the potential use in nutritional 
studies. It is important to recognise that the conditions under which they were 
routinely bred and housed were strictly controlled and, as such caution should be 
shown in extrapolating the results to other fish species farmed under commercial 
conditions (Ulloa et al., 2014). They are small in size, rapid growth rate and extensive 
knowledge of their genome, together with the ability to carefully control 
environmental conditions, make them a useful model for testing specific effects of 
nutrients. Therefore, they are a good model to study the inflammatory effect in 
gastrointestinal tract in response to different diets.  
Fish diet has profound effect on the microbial composition and nutrient uptake in the 
gastrointestinal tract (Rurangwa et al., 2015). The environment factors such as 
rearing water environment, temperature, feeding habitats and combination of diets 
could possibly modulate the normal gastrointestinal tract microbiota composition of 
fish (Betiku et al., 2018). In this chapter, the study of microbial composition in 
zebrafish through 16s rRNA gene composition was not in the consideration due to 
the constraint of research facilities and cost.  
Through 16s rRNA sequencing technique, it can expands the knowledge of the 
structure and diversity of bacterial communities within fish gastrointestinal tract may 
be important for improving health and production of aquaculture fish species (Betiku 
et al., 2018). Although, molecular-based technique is not the only approach to study 
the microbial composition, but the conventional culture-dependent method is not 
recommended. Studies had been reported that the fish gastrointestinal tract 
microbiota of fish was low cultivability, it only represented < 0.1 % of the total 
microbial community in the gastrointestinal tract (Wang et al., 2017; Ghanbari et al., 
2015; Zhou et al., 2014; Al-Harbi and Naim Uddin, 2004). As an alternative to study 
the impact of diet nutrition to fish health, the expression of inflammatory genes of 
gastrointestinal tract using qPCR were being targeted.  
6.3.1 Growth performance of zebrafish 
In this study, zebrafish were fed 6 weeks with one of the four experimental diets (T1 
 T4) or the basal diet (T0) which served as a control. The initial body weight of 
zebrafish ranged from 40.4  44.4 mg (Table 6.5). The ADG for each week of fish on 
feed containing untreated adzuki bean (T1) was only significantly different in week 6, 
whilst for feed containing untreated bambara groundnut (T3) was significant higher 
on week 5 onwards (Table 6.4). Whereas for the fish being offered feed containing 
treated bambara groundnut (T4) or adzuki bean (T2) exhibited significant higher ADG 
on week 2 and week 3 onwards, respectively. The highest ADG was found in fish 
offered with treated adzuki bean diet (T2), which ranged from 0.716 mg/day at week 
1 to 1.462 mg/day at week 6 even though it was not significantly different from the 
other feeds.  
The fish being fed with treated adzuki bean had the highest average daily grow 
(ADG). The fish feeds were formulated to equal isonitrogenous and isocalorific 
relative to the control, therefore the better ADG could have been due to the higher 
essential amino acid content of treated adzuki bean than untreated adzuki bean, 
untreated bambara groundnut and treated bambara groundnut, especially lysine and 
methionine. This is in agreement with Lu et al. (2014) who reported the 
improvement of growth performance in juvenile black seabream with the 
supplementation of lysine and methionine. Alternatively, a more plausible 
explanation could be that because there was no detectable level of protease 
inhibitors and low level of -amylase inhibitors in treated adzuki bean. This 
potentially may mean the protein and energy content of this feed ingredient can be 
better utilised than the control feed.

When compare the growth of zebrafish fed with T1  T4 diets with basal diet (T0), 
there was no significantly difference (p>0.05) for weight gain, ADG, SGR, PCR, and k 
index (Table 6.5). No significant difference was observed between raw legume and 
legume that with reduced enzyme inhibitors. Tibaldi et al. (2006) reported that the 
trypsin inhibitory activity less than 5.7 TIA unit/mg had no apparent adverse effect on 
growth performance in European seabass. As shown in Table 6.1, the trypsin 
inhibitors of processed and unprocessed adzuki bean and bambara groundnut was 
0.069 TIA unit/mg to undetectable level. Thus, current findings suggested that these 
substitutions of legume-based meals have not caused detrimental effect on the 
digestion and growth performance of zebrafish.

According to Siccardi Iii et al. (2009), the lack of a significant difference (p>0.05) k 
index is considered a good indicator of fish health. A decreased in k factor indicates 
depletion of energy reserves, such as stored liver glycogen or body fat.  
Aforementioned, only in recent years have zebrafish emerged as a model organism in 
aquaculture research. Very limited studies have been done on zebrafish to examine 
the effect of plant-based diets on the growth and toxicology nutrition for 
inflammatory disorders which could be caused by the enzyme inhibitors. Recent 
studies done by Karga and Mandal (2016), Liu et al. (2013), Ulloa et al. (2013) and 
Siccardi Iii et al. (2009) disclosed that different feed ingredients such as soybean 
meal, corn gluten, and mustard oil cake could influence the growth performance of 
zebrafish. Karga and Mandal (2016) and Liu et al. (2013) showed that when zebrafish 
were fed with soybean at the inclusion rate of 250  500 g/kg with 35  46 % of crude 
protein in the experimental diet, they had a lower weight gain and SGR than control. 
The zebrafish fed with zooplankton had gained 0.057 g whilst those fed with soybean 
meal gained 0.028 g after 1 month of feeding. This is mainly because the crude 
protein in the diet supplied with zooplankton or soybean were different (54 % and 
35 % respectively) (Karga and Mandal, 2016). In addition soybean is known to contain 
ANFs that retarded the growth performance, whilst zooplankton is a natural live 
food, that met the dietary requirements of zebrafish (Hedrera et al., 2013; Watts et 
al., 2012). 
6.3.2 Intestinal inflammatory response of zebrafish 
Like any other animals, gastro-intestinal tract of fish serves multiple functions 
including digestion and absorption, endocrine regulation of appetite and digestion, 
electrolyte balance (osmoregulation) and immune function (Buddington and 
Krogdahl, 2004). Since zebrafish have no true stomach, their intestine epithelium 
surface is the first site exposed to the nutrient including legume-based feed 
ingredients (Wang et al., 2010). Hence the current study was carried to investigate 
whether these treatments diets (T1  T4) are responsible for triggering the intestinal 
inflammatory response of zebrafish.  
Figure 6.1 showed that no significant change in the gene expression of the pro-
inflammatory cytokines il-1 (p=0.445) and il-8 (p=0.337) in response to the four 
experimental diets (T1  T4) relative to control diet (T0). These results suggested that 
replacement of 10 % of fish meal with legume meal did not affect inflammation as 
indicated by a change in cytokine gene expression.

experimental diets. Transcription levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (il-
1) and interleukin (il-8) were quantified by quantitavite PCR. T0  control basal diet

feed with untreated bambara groundnut powder (RBG); T4  replacement of 10 % of 
fish meal in feed with treated bambara groundnut powder (PBG). The error bars 
represent the standard error mean, n=5. No significant difference (p>0.05) were 
detected. 
Current observation is in contrast with the studies of Fuentes-Appelgren et al. (2014) 
and Hedrera et al. (2013) that reported different inclusion level of soybean meal  
that possibly consist of different level of ANFs  had caused an upregulation of pro-
inflammatory cytokines of il-1 and il-8 in zebrafish. The cytokines induction and 
severity of morphological alteration in fish gastrointestinal towards soybean meal is 
highly related to the fish variety, as some of the fish, such as Atlantic salmon, tend to 
be more sensitive to plant protein (Wang et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2016).  
Although the experimental feeds contained ANF, the relative expression of the 
selected intestinal inflammatory signals genes was not upregulated in the zebrafish 
upon the ingestion of legume protein. The 10 % (w/w) inclusion level of legume may 
have been too low and not sufficient to observe the effect of inflammation triggered 
by the enzyme inhibitors at molecular level. A more sensitive indication of 
inflammation of intestines may have been histological observations for any changes 
in morphological. Using this method the shortening of primary and secondary 
intestinal mucosal folds, an increased in the number of goblet cells and infiltration of 
inflammatory cells are the typical signs of inflammation in intestines and directly 
indicative of phenotype indicating intestine damage (Rimoldi et al., 2016). The 
general observations in the zebrafish trial describe in this thesis indicated the likely 
no consequences of replacing feed ingredients in fish feed. Therefore, this study did 
provided results which are potentially applicable to commercially important fish.  
6.4 Summary  
Current findings confirm that the legume meals with reduced enzyme inhibitors did 
not affected the growth performance of zebrafish and not induced inflammatory 
signals, at least in the intestine. Surprisingly, feeding zebrafish feed containing raw 
legumes for 6 weeks had no effect in the growth performance and intestine. In this 
study, a 10 % (w/w) replacement of fish meal with adzuki bean or bambara 
groundnut had comparable growth to basal diet. However, the average daily gain 
(ADG) of treated adzuki bean was the highest over 6 weeks. Thus, this legume had 
been chosen as the feed ingredient to be investigated with the growth and 
nutritional evaluation on the commercially important fish  Asian seabass as 
described in the next chapter.  
CHAPTER 7 
SUBSTITUTION OF LEGUME MEAL ON THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND HEPATIC 
RESPONSE OF ASIAN SEABASS 
7.1 Introduction 
Previous findings in Chapter 6 suggested that 10 % replacement of fish meal with 
adzuki bean or bambara groundnut had shown no significant difference in growth of 
zebrafish compared to the basal diet. In this chapter, the effect of substitution of 
legume meal on the growth of Asian seabass was investigated.  
Asian seabass is a commercially importance carnivorous species and is extensively 
cultured in South East Asian and Australia due to the high consumer demand (Mohd-
Yusof et al., 2010). Over the past decades, researchers have been looking into the use 
of different raw feed ingredient materials such as soybean meal, poultry meal, canola 
meal, green pea, chicken waste, kernel meal and feather meal along with many 
potential sources of protein, to reduce the reliance on fish meal as protein source for 
cultured Asian seabass (Glencross et al., 2016; Ganzon-Naret, 2013c; Glencross, 
2011; Nandakumar et al., 2013; Plaipetch and Yakupitiyage, 2011).  
Substitution of animal protein with plant protein has detrimental effects on fish 
growth and performance, especially in carnivorous fish, where these effects can be 
directly related to the effects of enteritis (Fuentes-Appelgren et al., 2014). However, 
studies done by Santigosa et al. (2008) as well as German and Horn (2006) discovered 
that carnivorous fish have a compensatory mechanism that allows them to modify 
and adapt their digestive and physiological system to a feeds containing high 
proportion of plant-derived ingredients.  
This chapter aimed to investigate the effect of substituting into fish feed adzuki 
beans, treated to reduce enzyme inhibitors on the growth performance and hepatic 
response of Asian seabass. 
The specific aims of this study were: 
 To investigate the growth performance of Asian seabass fed with feeds 
containing adzuki bean meal treated to reduce enzyme inhibitors 
 To investigate the effect of this feed on Asian seabass hepatic inflammatory 
genes heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
 To investigate the Asian seabass hepatic amino acid metabolism via 
assessment of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) gene expression 
Current hypothesis proposed that fish feed containing adzuki bean meal treated to 
reduce enzyme inhibitors will increase the dietary protein availability compared to 
untreated adzuki bean meal-based feed in Asian seabass which will result in 
increased growth relative untreated adzuki bean. In addition, the relatively enhanced 
the growth of Asian seabass on treated adzuki bean meal based feed will be 
associated induced the inflammatory signals when compared to untreated adzuki 
bean meal based feed.  
7.2 Experimental design 
7.2.1 Ethical issues 
The research reported in this chapter was conducted in compliance with Named 
Animal Care and Welfare Officer (NACWO) and Named Veterinary Surgeon (NVS) 
guidelines. The study received animal ethics approval from the Animal Welfare and 
Ethical Review Committee with approval number UNMC8.  
7.2.2 Asian Seabass 
36 Asian seabass (approximately 5 to 6 cm) were used for the study and were housed 
under the conditions listed in section 2.6.2 at Crop for Future Research Centre. Three 
replicate tanks were given the same experimental diet, 4 fish per tank a total of 12 
fish per diet. The fish was not being acclimatised before the starting of fish feeding 
trial. The fish was not being acclimatised as the fish position was being switch every 
week after weighing to mitigate the lighting effect on the fish. The fish feeding trial 
was carried out for five weeks and the body weight was taking weekly to record 
growth throughout and the length was only measured at the end of the study as 
described in section 2.6.2a. The fish were fed once at 4 % body weight per day, 6 
days per week. At the end of feeding trial, the fish were culled and tissue were 
collected as listed in section 2.6.2b. 
7.2.3 Feed ingredients and diet formulation 
The untreated adzuki bean (RAB) and treated adzuki bean (PAB) were included in the 
experimental diets. To produce PAB the adzuki bean were treated by using the 
processed of dry freezing and autoclaving (D+A). The dried legumes without 
underwent the dehulling process were frozen at -80C for 24 h which were 
subsequently had distilled water (ratio 1:10 (w/v)) added to them before it reached 
room temperature. The legumes were then autoclaved at 121C, 15 psi for 15 min. 
After autoclaving the associated liquid was poured away and the legumes were 
cooled to room temperature and chilled overnight at 4C. The chilled legumes were 
frozen at -80C for 24 h. The legumes were lyophilised for 24 h using freeze-dryer 
(Alpha 1-4 LD plus, Christ). The lyophilised legumes were then ground into powder 
form using a miller. The fine powder was then to pass through a series of mesh sieves 
with the size of 1.68 m, 1.18 m and 0.85 m. The powder that was stopped on 
1.18 m mesh sieve was collected and stored in 4C chiller prior incorporated to the 
aquafeed. 
The material chemical compositions data and amino acids content were presented in 
Table 7.1. Two experimental diets were formulated: T1 and T2 to reduce fish meal 
(FM) content by 10 % (w/w), but retain the same nutrient content, by replacing this 
with either RAB or PAB (Table 7.2). As a control, a basal diet (T0) that did not contain 
any legumes was formulated. The nutritional profile of the diets was presented in 
Table 7.3. 
The desired amounts of all ingredients required were mixed using a mixer until 
thoroughly mixed. A 40 % (v/w) of water was added into the mixture to achieve 
dough like consistency. The dough mixture was then processed into a spaghetti-like 
product (3 mm ) using a meat grinder and was broke into pellet size pieces with the 
lengths of approximately 5  10 mm. The pellets were dried for 24 h at 50C oven. 
The diets were stored at 4C.

7.2.4 Chemical analysis 
All ingredients were analysed for dry matter, crude protein, crude lipid, ash, crude 
fibre, gross energy, and amino acid according to the procedure described in Chapter 
2 (section 2.4.1 to 2.4.8). While the analyses of proximate (Table 7.3) in experimental 
diets were outsourced to ALS Technichem (M) Sdn Bhd. The whole carcass was freeze 
dried and minced. The dried carcass was then analysed for crude protein and crude 
lipid according to section 2.4.1a and 2.4.2. Whereas the moisture content of whole 
carcass was determined according to section 2.4.5 after the fish being culled. 
7.2.5 Growth performance indices  
a) Weight gain 
Weight gain is defined as an increased in body weight and it was calculated as: 
Weight gain = Final weight of fish (g)  Initial weight of fish (g) 
b) Average daily gain (ADG) 
Average daily gain is defined as the rate of weight gain (g) per day over a specified 
period. It was calculated as: 
ADG (g/day) = (Final weight of fish  Initial weight of fish) / feeding days 
c) Specific growth rate (SGR) 
The specific growth rate is the growth that achieved per day during feeding period. 
SGR (%) = 100 x (LnW2  LnW1) x (t2  t1)-1 
Notes: 
Ln  natural log 
W1  initial weight 
W2  final weight 
t1  starting time point (day one) 
t2  end time point (final day number) 
d) Feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
Feed conversion ratio is used to indicate the efficiency at which feed is converted 
into animal biomass, calculated as below: 
FCR = Feed consumed (g) / Weight gain (g) 
The assumption is that all the feed put in the tank is eaten by the fish since the feed 
was not given on an ad lib basis. The feed was given based on the weight of the fish 
which is 4 % of the fish body weight per day.  
e) Protein conversion ratio (PCR) 
Protein conversion ratio is the ratio of protein in the diet to total animal production 
and it was calculated as: 
PCR = FCR x (% Feed protein / 100 %) 
f) Protein efficiency ratio (PER) 
Protein efficiency ratio is an indicator of the conversion of feed ingredient protein 
into animal protein, calculated as below: 
PER = FCR x (% feed protein / % protein in culture species) 
g) Fultons condition factor (k index) 
Fultons conditions factor is commonly used in fisheries science to measure an 
individual fishs health that uses the relationship of fish weight and length to overall 
condition.  
k = (Weight (g) / Length3 (mm)) x 105 
h) Hepatosomatic index (HSI) 
The organ index commonly liver is also used to assess fish health 
HSI = (Liver mass (g) / Fish weight (g)) x 100 
7.2.6 Gene expression analysis 
For each diet, three replicates of liver tissues (< 30 mg) were each independently 
submerged in 500 L of RNAlater and stored at -80C until further analysis. The RNA 
was extracted according to method as describe in Chapter 2 (section 2.51 and 2.5.3). 
Expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), C-reactive protein (CRP) were used as 
markers of an activated inflammatory responses. Whilst expression of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALAT) was used as an indicator of dietary protein availability. 
These genes were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) as described in Chapter 2 (section 2.5.5 and 2.5.7).  
The sequences of HSP 70 (HQ646109.1), CRP (HQ652974.1), ALAT (XM_018693109.1) 
and -actin (GU188683.1) were obtained from NCBI GenBank Database. Each gene 
was tested in nonuplicate. The mean Cq values from each sample were normalised 
against the mean Cq value of a reference gene (-actin, housekeeping gene). The 
melting curve was used to ensure that a single product was amplified and confirm 
the absence of primer-dimer. The relative quantification of each gene was obtained 
with Pfaffls method using the fish fed with control diet (T0) as the reference, this 
reference was compared to the treatments (Pfaffl, 2004). 
7.2.7 Statistical analysis 
All the results were presented as mean  standard error mean (SEM), tank replicated 
(n=3). IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22, IBM Corporation, USA) was used to 
perform one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on data sets and where this was 
statistical significant (p<0.05) subsequent post-hoc analysis was carried out using 
Duncans Multiple Comparison test with confidence intervals of 95 % with threshold 
for significance when p<0.05. Data was checked for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test 
and for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test. Graphs were constructed 
using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software Inc, USA).

7.3 Results and discussion 
In the study described in this thesis, a high inclusion rate of D+A processed adzuki 
bean protein was not used because the feeds were formulated to be isonitrogenous 
and isocalorific based on the basal diet to meet the standard requirements of 
nutritional quality of Asian seabass. To fulfil these criteria a 10 % fish meal 
replacement was the maximum amount that could be used in Asian seabass diet. 
Therefore, in the current study it was difficult to compare the growth performance 
between those fed on legume-based protein, processed to certain low enzymatic 
inhibitor activity, directly to those fed animal protein, as the fish were fed at different 
protein concentrations. 
As mentioned in Chapter 6, zebrafish study serves as a preliminary study therefore 
the experimental design of Asian seabass should be an exact duplication from the 
previous chapter except substitute the fish model to farmed fish. However, the organ 
that collected for inflammatory effect in Asian seabass was liver while zebrafish was 
from intestines. The size of zebrafish is the major challenge in isolated the liver. It 
was too small to be isolated and the collected amount will not be able to reach the 
minimum requirement of using the RNA extraction kit even with the pooled sample. 
Besides, the difference of study in targeted genes in both chapters was due to the 
availability of gene sequence provided in NCBI. The information in GenBank for Asian 
seabass was not established as zebrafish. Thus, different genes which also encoded 
for inflammatory response had been chose. 
7.3.1 Growth performance of Asian seabass 
Juvenile Asian seabass at the length of 1  7 cm has an intense desire for cannibalism 
(Mathew, 2009). Although there was some cannibalistic behaviour in juvenile Asian 
seabass, with damage to fin and tail were being observed during the feeding period, 
the survival rate of fish was 100 % with no dead fish was being found in 5 weeks of 
feeding period.  
In this study, Asian seabass were fed with two experiment meals (T1 and T2) and one 
control diet (T0). The initial body weight of Asian seabass ranged from 8.82  9.31 g 
(Table 7.5). After the 5 weeks feeding period, there was no significant difference of 
ADG found in all diets. Only in the first week did the fish being offered with T1 diet 
20 % significantly higher ADG than T2 diet.

When compared with basal diet (T0) the Asian seabass fed with T1 and T2 meals 
showed good growth and were not significantly different (p>0.05) in terms of weight 
gain, SGR, FCR, PCR, PER, HSI and k index (Table 7.5). No significant difference was 
observed between raw legume and legume that with reduced enzyme inhibitors and 
this observation was in accordance with zebrafish. Aforementioned in Chapter 6, it 
has been reported that if the trypsin inhibitor activity is less than 5.7 TIA unit/mg had 
no apparent adverse effect on growth performance in European seabass was 
observed (Tibaldi et al., 2006). As shown in Table 7.1, the trypsin inhibitors of 
processed and unprocessed adzuki bean was 0.069 TIA unit/mg to undetectable level 
respectively.  
The previously reported the critical threshold of replacing fish meal with plant 
protein concentrate for juvenile Asian seabass based on a balanced diet was 
approximately 15 % (weight) without affecting the growth performance and fish 
health (Glencross et al., 2011). In agreement with this the current findings suggested 
that these substitutions of legume-based meals have not caused detrimental effect 
on the digestion and growth performance of Asian seabass. The growth rates of 
current study were in contrast to those reported by Katersky and Carter (2009) and 
Tantikitti et al. (2005) where Asian seabass were fed with lupin meal or soybean 
meal, respectively, and they found higher growth efficiency with the lower amounts 
of feed protein (40 % crude protein). This difference to the study described in this 
thesis was probably due to a different legume used as feed ingredient, and 
differences in rearing conditions, as current studies was carried out at fresh water 
whilst the other studies were in brackish water with 10  33 % salinity. In an 
experiment conducted with Asian seabass, it was shown fish being reared in 
saltwater resulted in better FCR and greater weight gain relative to those reared in 
freshwater (Harpaz et al., 2005). Asian seabass is a freshwater-adapted fish, the salt 
in brackish water can satisfy the osmoregulatory requirements and thus spare energy 
used for osmoregulation, leaving more energy available for growth (Gatlin et al., 
1992). 
Despite the difference in the legume used and rearing condition, published literature 
suggested that the growth performance of carnivorous species, such as Asian 
seabass, Japanese seabass, rainbow trout, and Japanese flounder, are influenced by 
different feeding rate and frequency (Ye et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2010; Soler-Vila et 
al., 2009; Salama, 2008). As an example, Ganzon-Naret (2013b) stated that the 
growth of Asian seabass was greatly enhanced by feeding the fish 6 times daily at

Protein is the most expensive element in aquafeed. It is crucial to have good PCR and 
PER in aquafeed manufacturing and feeding practices (Boyd et al., 2007). The PCR for 
fish fed with T2 diet indicated only 0.89 kg of crude protein could be applied in 
aquafeed in order to obtain 1 kg of fish, which was 11.0  12.7 % lower than basal 
(T0) and T1 diet. Whilst PER indicated the efficiency of converting the feed protein to 
aquatic animal protein for human consumption. The PER for fish fed with T2 diet 
indicated only 1.34 kg of crude protein must be applied in aquafeed in order to 
obtain 1 kg of fish protein, which was 14.6 % lower than basal and T1 diet.  
As mentioned in Chapter 6, k index is important to determine the fitness and health 
of the fish population. In this study, no significant difference (p>0.05) was found in k 
index indicating that, generally, the fish were in relatively good condition on all the 
diets. HSI is a measurement of energy reserves and metabolic activity in fish 
(Humphrey et al., 2007). There was no significant increased (p>0.05) in HSI among 
the experimental diets indicated the plant protein were not causing lipid 
accumulation in the liver.  
Recently, various published research studies have investigated, not only the effect of 
using soybean, but other plant protein, such as green pea, canola and lupin, as an 
alternative fish meal replacement in barramundi feed (Glencross et al., 2016; Van Vo 
et al., 2015; Plaipetch et al., 2014; Ganzon-Naret, 2013a; Plaipetch and Yakupitiyage, 
2011). Although a recent studied had shown replacement of 90 % fish meal in 
barramundi did not affecting the growth performance, only 30 % was replaced with 
plant-based ingredient (soybean meal) the other 60 % was replaced by poultry meal 
(Glencross et al., 2016). Whereas Van Vo et al. (2015) and Plaipetch and Yakupitiyage 
(2011) reported there was no adverse effect in barramundi growth performance 
when their feed had an inclusion rate of fermented canola meal (50 %) or lupin meal 
(75 %), respectively. They were able to include a higher inclusion rate as ANFs were 
significantly reduced in these ingredients, in particularly phytic acid which had 
decreased by 87 % in fermented lupin and 17 % in fermented canola.  
With 10 % fish meal replacement there was no significant difference in protein and 
lipid content indicating the nutritional values of the fish were not influenced by the 
diets. In terms of protein, lipid and moisture content, the carcass of Asian seabass 
was relatively consistent across all diets in this study (Table 7.6). This observation 
was in agreement with Ye et al. (2011) and verland et al. (2009) who stated that the 
fish carcass of Atlantic salmon and Japanese flounder was not influenced by feeds 
containing soybean meal and pea. This could be attributed to the similar nutrient 
composition in experimental diets to the basal diet and fish was able to utilise the 
plant protein in the same way they utilised the fish meal protein.

7.3.2 Hepatic genes response 
Fish liver is the main organ which not only plays an important role in toxicant and 
immune response but also involved in nutrient utilisation as the centre of 
intermediary metabolism (Panserat et al., 2009; Tintos et al., 2008). Therefore, liver 
is the target organ to study the experimental diet induced effects in fish.  
Figure 7.1 shows that no significant change in the expression of the hepatic 
inflammation response genes HSP 70 and CRP between the treatments meals (T1  
T2). Whereas the transcriptions of the amino acid metabolism gene ALAT significant 
increased (p<0.01) by 1.4-fold in fish fed the T2 meal.

(PAB). The error bars represent the standard error mean, n=3. ** significant 
difference (p<0.05) were detected. 
The current findings showed that the experimental diets had not appear to cause any 
inflammation effects in fish liver, as indicated by changes in gene expression of genes 
associated with this response, which was in accordance with recent study done by 
Glencross et al. (2016). They stated that Asian seabass had been offered with 100 % 
substitution of fish meal with the mixture of poultry meal and soybean meal have no 
induction of inflammatory markers of HSP 70 and CRP.  
In nature, carnivorous fish have limited capacity to utilise carbohydrate and they are 
adapted to preferential use of dietary amino acid from protein as the main source of 
energy production (Gatlin III, 2010; Stone, 2003). ALAT is reliable marker of dietary 
protein utilisation in fish (Metn et al., 2015). It plays an important role in linking 
amino acid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism by catalysing the reversible 
transamination between L-alanine and ketoglutarate to pyruvate and L-glutamate, 
thereby generating non-essential amino acids (Metn et al., 2015; Gonzlez et al., 
2012).  
It is noteworthy that ALAT gene expression is upregulated in livers of fish fed with 
T2, indicating the upregulation of transamination, even though T1 and T2 had a 
similar protein content (approximately 44 %). This differential in gene expression 
might indicate the differences in the efficient in using dietary amino acid for growth 
in the reduced enzyme inhibitors legume meal (T2), since on this diet yielded a better 
weight gain. The rise in the hepatic activity of protein-metabolising gene denote the 
usage of dietary amino acids for growth (Bibiano Melo et al., 2006).  
On the other hand, an interpretation could be that availability of amino acid in T2 
diet is better than T1 which then might have caused the upregulation of ALAT gene. 
As shown in Table 7.1, the essential amino acids in untreated adzuki bean powder 
(RAB) used in T1 diet was lower compared to treated adzuki bean powder (PAB). 
When the available amino acids are deficient, it will lead to the decrease of ALAT 
enzyme activity, indicated by the associated change in ALAT gene expression (Cheng 
et al., 2010). The upregulation of amino acid metabolism ALAT in fish that fed with 
treated adzuki bean postulated there was a not deficiency of amino acids for juvenile 
Asian seabass, but they also used very few amino acids for energy. Therefore it could 
be suggested the amino acids were used for maintenance, health and synthesis of 
new structural proteins, which would result in maximum feed efficiency and growth 
(Ovie and Eze, 2013). Previously a study had shown upregulation of gene ALAT in liver 
was associated with high ALAT enzyme activity (Caballero-Solares et al., 2015). It is 
assumed that this could have happened in the present study, even though the 
enzyme activity was not quantified.  
Like any other studies, there were limitations in Asian seabass feeding trial. Some of 
these were associated with the lighting supply in the fish lab, as the quantity of light 
reaching the bottom aquaria was limited resulting in the fish in these aquaria being 
less active than those in other aquaria that were exposed to more light. To mitigate 
this effect, the position of the fish was switched every week after their weight was 
taken. The cannibalistic and aggressive behaviour of juvenile Asian seabass is another 
challenge of the study. They all started at the similar size (approximately 5 to 6 cm) 
however it was observed that some were more aggressive than others. During the 
feeding period, the aggressive fish tends to attack the less aggressive fish which 
reduced the feeding of the latter. Therefore, over the feeding period there was a 
differential in nutrient intake of the fish within a tank, however analysis was carried 
out at the level of the tank rather than individual fish, the statistical replicate being 
the tank.  
For future experiments it should ensure that lighting is more uniform across the 
tanks this would avoid the requirement to weekly switch the position of the fish in 
order to reduce the stress. To overcome the cannibalistic behaviour that might 
possibility affect the appetite of juvenile seabass; the density of fish in the aquarium 
should be increased. It has been suggested that with high density of fish could limited 
the resting space and breakdown of hierarchical territoriality (Kaiser et al., 1995). 
Fish tend to form shoals and cannibals become perceptively confused and the ability 
of selecting a prey is low as the number of potential prey is too high (Baras and 
Jobling, 2002).  
7.4 Summary 
Current findings confirm that the adzuki bean meal with reduced enzyme inhibitors 
did not affected the growth performance of Asian seabass and not induced 
inflammatory signals, at least in the liver. However, there is an increasing effect on 
gene that associated amino acid metabolism which may indicate the adaptations of 
Asian seabass towards plant based aquafeed.  
CHAPTER 8 
GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The over-reliance on fish meal as protein source in aquaculture industry has caused 
pressure on ocean fisheries because farming carnivorous species required large 
amount of fish feed derived from wild-caught fish. To ensure the sustainability of 
aquaculture industry, plant protein sources such as underutilised legumes has 
evolved as a potential alternative aquafeed ingredient. However, the presence of 
enzyme inhibitors in legumes are known to reduce digestion and nutrient absorption 
in carnivorous fish. Hence, this study aimed to develop a processing strategy to 
remove trypsin, chymotrypsin, and -amylase inhibitors present in underutilised 
legumes, followed by incorporating these processed legumes in aquafeed to replace 
fish meal and enhance the growth of zebrafish and Asian seabass.  
The aim of the study has been achieved by using a combination method of dry 
freezing (D) at -80C for 24 h and autoclaving (A) at 121C at 15 psi for 15 min. This 
was the first study that has used the combination of D+A to reduce the enzyme 
inhibitors. Current findings showed that the D+A treatment was most effective on 
adzuki bean. The trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors in adzuki bean were reduced to 
non-detectable level, whilst up to 70 % of reduction in -amylase inhibitor. The crude 
protein content was not affected by this D+A treatment. The outcome of this study 
had contributed to overcome the nutritional shortcomings of legume for use as a 
sustainable protein source in aquafeed. Furthermore, the D+A treatment is a simple 
and effective approach that could be upgraded to commercial scale to satisfy the 
need of aquaculture industry.  
The concept of formulated aquafeed is to use available ingredients and processed 
them in the most economical way to provide the essential nutrient content and 
balance diet to the commercial cultured fish by taking the feed quality and 
palatability into consideration. A key aspect for sustainable production and profitable 
aquaculture industry is to reduce the cost that mainly contributes by aquafeed that 
represent up to 60 % of operational cost. Reductions in feeding costs can be done 
through substitution of fish meal using underutilised legume since protein is the most 
expensive element in formulated aquafeed. Thus, the application of D+A treatment 
by eliminating the enzyme inhibitors in these legume-based ingredients would 
possibly promote good fish growth, survival, production, and at the same time boost 
the income of farmers.  
As described in Chapter 1 (section 1.3.1), a shortage in soybean meal is anticipated 
with increasing demand in aquaculture industry and in conjunction with fluctuation 
in production deficits and resulted in price escalating. This factor has also lead to the 
increase of market price for aquafeed and farmed fish. Hence, underutilised legumes 
that with sustainable production, lower market price and some that could even 
withstand to adverse climate and environmental conditions are the way forward for 
food and feed industries. Undeniable the crude protein content of adzuki bean (21  
24 %) was not as high as soybean (40 %) and might limit the possibility of total 
replacement of soybean in aquafeed. However, adzuki bean combined with other 
underutilise legumes could still replace a substantial portion of fish or soybean meal 
and contribute to fulfil the protein requirement of farmed fish.  
Current study with inclusion of 10 % (w/w) of treated adzuki bean had no effect on 
growth performance of zebrafish or Asian seabass. Current finding suggests that the 
treated legume protein may potentially replace the fish meal without having negative 
effects the growth performance of carnivorous fish. However, the expression of 
amino acid metabolism gene ALAT was upregulated in fish fed with treated adzuki 
bean suggested the increment of accessibility in amino acid. As mentioned in Chapter 
7 (section 7.3.2), ALAT gene is one of the principal pathways responsible for the 
synthesis and transamination of amino acids by transfer an amino acid to a ketoacid 
to form new amino acid, thereby, allowing interconversion between carbohydrate 
and protein metabolism to meet the energy demand of fish. The rise of this protein-
metabolising gene denotes the usage of dietary amino acids were used for 
maintenance, health, and synthesis of new structural proteins in resulting maximum 
growth in Asian seabass.   
The fish carcass always serve as an indicator of quality of the fish as a food product 
(Mumba and Jose, 2005). In this study, regardless of whether legume constituent of 
the diet was treated or untreated, the carcass protein and lipid composition in 
juvenile Asian seabass was not significantly different to the fish fed the control  
animal protein (fish meal) based feed, suggesting they can utilise legume-based 
protein in the same way they utilised the fish meal protein. Investigation of the 
impact of legume-based protein on fatty acid composition, especially in terms of 
omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of Asian seabass would also be of 
interest on flesh quality. Furthermore, the changes in fish diets often associated with 
changes in fillet characteristics in terms of texture, colour, and taste. Sensory 
evaluation may play a critical role in the evaluation of fish quality as well as the 
acceptance level of consumer.  
In future, the incorporation level of treated D+A legume protein could increase from 
10 % (w/w) to complete replacement of fish meal to examine the maximum 
incorporation rate in the feed without depressed the growth in carnivorous fish. 
Further investigation on the prolonged feeding period from weeks to months should 
be warranted since the juvenile fish (< 10 g) of Asian seabass required up to half year 
feeding period to reach marketable size (approximately 500 - 600 g). These studies 
could hopefully address the farmers demand of farmed fish with good growth 
performance and meat quality.  
Beside enzyme inhibitors, there are also wide range of ANFs including saponin, phytic 
acid, oligosaccharides, lectin, tannin, and cyanogen are naturally present in legumes 
which could possibly affect the fish digestive system and thereby influence their 
growth performance. The interaction of these ANFs especially phytic acid and tannin 
with macronutrient present in fish feed would also be of interest since the effect on 
digestive and absorptive process in carnivorous fish have not been well documented. 
The feed palatability may reduce with the presence of tannins due to their astringent 
flavour.  
In summary, the D+A processing method is effective in reducing the enzymatic 
inhibitors present in underutilised legumes and could also be applied to any other 
legumes in an attempt to study their possibility as the alternative aquafeed 
ingredients. Shifting away from wild-harvested fish meal to using treated 
underutilised legume as protein source and ingredient in aquafeed provide a solution 
on dwindling fish catches, thereby creates a more sustainable aquaculture industry 
that relieve pressure on ocean fisheries.
