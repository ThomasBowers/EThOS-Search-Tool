ABSTRACT 
Antivenom is the only effective treatment for snakebite and comprise 
immunoglobulins obtained from venom-immunised horses or sheep. Globally, 
more than 45 manufacturers make over 120 snake antivenoms; it is a 
regulatory requirement that the venom-neutralising efficacy of all antivenoms 
are assessed preclinically. The World Health Organisation (WHO) 
recommended preclinical tests of efficacy are the median lethal venom dose 
(LD50) and median effective antivenom dose (ED50) assays performed in mice. 
They result in substantial pain and suffering to the mice with death/survival as 
their metric. With NC3R-funding, we sought to apply the Refine, Reduce and 
Replace principles of animal experimentation to these murine assays.  
Pain is a near-universal symptom of snake envenoming, and one of our 
objectives was to identify an effective analgesic that could be utilised without 
invalidating the assay results.  The Mouse Grimace Scale and Activity scores 
were used to measure pain. We examined the effects of two opioid analgesics, 
buprenorphine and morphine, in a range of venom LD50 and ED50 assays. Both 
were effective at reducing pain scores, but death rates were higher in those 
which had received buprenorphine, hence morphine is preferable. 
We demonstrate that each venom exhibits a distinct set of lesions, the severity 
of which appears time and dose dependent, and that the observed murine 
pathological lesions show significant similarities to those reported in 
envenomed human victims. Applying the 3R principles, we have used 
pathological observations, in combination with ante mortem observations, to 
establish more humane end-points, consequently reducing the duration of LD50 
and ED50 assays from 24 to 6 hours. In addition, we have implemented a dose-
staging element into experimental design in which one dose is given and the 
next dose(s) selected based on the results of the previous dose, reducing total 
mice required.  
To reduce the numbers of assays, and therefore mice, we have shown an 
excellent correlation between in vitro binding assays, cytotoxicity neutralisation 
assays and in vivo ED50 using antivenoms derived from the same pool of donor 
animals. Comparison of the results of in vitro binding assays between 35 
different venom/antivenom combinations showed a poor correlation overall, 
but the correlation improved when each of five venoms were considered 
separately. 
The possibility of replacing the in vivo LD50 and ED50 tests, using a cell-based 
neutralisation assay was investigated using two cell lines from diverse tissues 
of origin, namely VERO epithelial-type cells and neural SH SY5Y. All venoms 
studied produced a cytopathic effect in both cell lines, with the VERO cells 
being more sensitive to viper venoms and SH SY5Y cells to the effects of 
elapid venoms, when both cell lines were grown in co-culture. However, 
variability of results made optimisation of a neutralisation assay inadequate for 
use as an alternative to in vivo tests.

Chapter 1.  Introduction 
The research presented in this thesis investigates ways in which the 3Rs 
(Refinement, Replacement and Reduction of animals in research) can be 
implemented into the in vivo lethality tests presently recommended to 
demonstrate preclinical efficacy of snake antivenoms. This chapter covers a 
brief background and rationale for this work; venomous snakes, venom toxins, 
their associated lesions and medical importance; antivenoms, their 
manufacture, efficacy testing, adverse effects, deficiencies in therapy and 
research to improve them; a definition of the 3Rs and the snake venom species 
selected for this work. 
Venomous snakes occur throughout the world, except in the Antarctic, 
Greenland, New Zealand and a few other isolated countries, such as Ireland.  
Few snakes occur at high altitude, especially in areas outside the tropics. 
Snake-bite envenoming occurs wherever man meets venomous snake, either 
in the wild or in captivity.   
1.1 Background and Rationale 
1.1.1 Morbidity and mortality 
Snakebite is classified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health 
Organisation (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs337/en/)1. The 
highest incidence is in the impoverished rural tropics, where income barely 
covers subsistence, and renders medical treatments such as antivenom, 
unaffordable. Such areas include South Asia, Southeast Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa (Harrison et al, 2009).  
Globally, it is estimated that there are between 1.2 and 5.5 million human 
snakebite envenomings, with between 25,000 and 125,000 deaths per annum, 
with an estimated 400,000 amputations and yet more suffering other 
permanent sequelae (Chippaux, 1998; Gutierrez et al, 2016; Harrison et al, 
2009; Kasturiratne et al, 2008; Williams et al, 2010). The incidence of human 
1 Website checked 17.04.17 
snakebite envenoming is illustrated in Figure 1.1-1 and that of snakebite 
mortality in Figure 1.1-2.  
Figure 1.1-1: Regional estimates of envenomings due to snakebite (low estimate) GBD 
= Global Burden of Disease (Kasturiratne et al 2008) 
Figure 1.1-2: Annual snakebite mortality: Annual estimates of snakebite-induced deaths 
for 138 countries were obtained from data published by Kasturiratne et al, 2008, and 
depicted on a world map using Epi-info; the darker a countrys colour, the greater the 
estimated snakebite mortality  see key for details (reproduced from Harrison et al, 2009). 
1.1.2 Treatment - Antivenom 
The only specific treatment for snakebite is antivenom, which consists of 
purified antibodies to venom components and is species specific in its 
efficacy (Brown and Landon, 2010). Globally there are 45 antivenom 
manufacturers making a total of 120 different antivenoms as shown in Figure 
1.1-3  (http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/). 
Figure 1.1-3: Antivenom manufacturers globally: Number of antivenoms in red. 
http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/2 (Harrison, personal 
communication) 
1.1.3 Ensuring antivenom efficacy 
It is imperative that antivenom neutralising efficacy is demonstrated for the 
snakes found in the area in which they are to be used prior to release for 
treatment of clinical cases.  
Theakston and Reid, 1983, defined and described the standard assay 
procedures for the characterisation of snake venoms and their neutralisation 
with antivenom. The gold standard assay is the median lethal dose of venom 
 the dose which kills 50% of a group of mice (LD50) and the median effective 
2 06.01.2016 
http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/)
http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/
dose of antivenom  the dose which saves 50% of mice receiving a standard 
lethal dose of venom (ED50). These assays are described in detail in Chapter 
1.1.4 The murine cost 
At present the World Health Organisation recommend preclinical testing (ED50) 
of every batch of new or existing antivenom. The assays are of 24 hours 
duration and require a minimum of twenty mice, divided into one group of five 
mice which all die, one group of five mice which all survive and two 
intermediate survival groups. An LD50 may also be required to define the lethal 
dose of venom (usually 2x to 5x the LD50). Assuming an average of 2 batches 
of antivenom are made annually, this equates to well in excess of 30,000 mice 
per annum for regulatory testing of these antivenoms. 
1.1.5 Why the need to test antivenom in vivo? 
The need to preclinically test antivenoms in vivo is best illustrated by an 
example described by Visser et al, 2008. A new antivenom was purchased by 
the government in Ghana which was 1/10th of the price of FAV Afrique  an 
antivenom known to be effective in treating cases of Echis ocellatus 
envenoming. It was noted that the fatality from snakebites increased from 1.8% 
to 12.1% and even larger doses of the new antivenom administered did not 
adequately neutralise the venom-induced coagulopathy. Had this antivenom 
been preclinically tested, it would have been shown to be ineffective, without 
the unnecessary loss of human life and associated morbidity. 
1.1.6 Definition of the 3Rs  
The 3Rs are: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animals in research. 
 Replacement is the use of methods which avoid or replace the use of 
animals 
 Reduction is the use of methods which minimise the number of animals 
used in an experiment 
 Refinement is the use of methods which minimise suffering and 
improve animal welfare 
1.1.7 The need for 3Rs 
Pain is an almost universal symptom of human snakebite victims and therefore 
mice undergoing preclinical testing of antivenoms and associated venom 
characterisation, not unexpectedly, show signs of extreme pain and distress. 
At present, assay duration is 24 to 48 hours, depending on route of 
administration, and the metric is death; in the 21st century inflicting this degree 
of pain and suffering is unacceptable to many. Ethically, we, as scientists, have 
a duty to implement the 3Rs. The objective of this project is to implement the 
3Rs into in vivo preclinical testing of antivenoms. 
1.2 Literature Review 
1.2.1 Classification of snakes 
Snakes are vertebrate, ectothermic animals, which possess scales.  They 
belong to the Order Squamata, the same Order as lizards.  They have their 
own suborder, Serpentes.  This Order of animals has a skull which is adapted 
to enable them to move their upper jaw in relation to the braincase. However, 
unlike lizards, in the case of snakes the upper and lower jaws are not rigidly 
attached, enabling them to dislocate their temporomandibular joints and 
swallow large prey whole (Gilpin, 2008).   
Snakes are divided into three superfamilies: Henophidia (boas, pythons and 
primitive snakes), Typhoploidea (blind and thread snakes) and Xenophidia (all 
other snakes, including venomous snakes).  There are 19 families of snakes, 
the largest of which is Colubridae.  The vast majority of Colubrids are harmless, 
but the few that are venomous (e.g. the Boomslang, Dispholidus typus) have 
short fangs at the back of their mouth (opisthoglyphs), which are grooved or 
solid (Figure 1.2-2A). The evolutionary relationship of advanced snakes is 
shown in Figure 1.2-1. 
Most of the medically-important venomous snakes belong to the Families 
Elapidae including Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) or Viperidae, including 
Crotalidae (pit-vipers).  These families all have fangs at the front of their 
mouths, the elapids and hydrophiids fangs being fixed to the maxillary bone 
(proteroglyphs) (Figure 1.2-2B) whereas those of vipers are back-folding 
(solenoglyphs) (Figure 1.2-2C) (Vonk et al, 2008).

relative timing of toxin recruitment events and derivations of the venom system. MRI 
images are shown for representatives. Ach, Acetylcholinesterase; LAO, L-amino oxidase;

GrTx, glycine rich toxin; Hya, hyaluronidase; RAP, renin-like aspartic protease; VEGF, 
vascular endothelial growth factor (Fry et al, 2008). 
Genera of elapids include Naja (cobras), Hemachatus (rhinkals), Bungarus 
(kraits), Dendroaspis (mambas), Micrurus (coral snakes) and the Australian 
snakes (Acanthophis, Pseudoechis, Oxyuranus, and Pseudonaja).  The 
venom of these snakes is characterised by neurotoxicity, although the venoms 
of Australian elapids of the families Oxyuranus (Taipans) and Pseudonaja 
(Brown snakes) are also coagulopathic. 
Viperidae consist of two subfamilies, Viperinae and Crolatinae; genera of 
Viperinae include Vipera (European/Eurasian vipers), Macrovipera (Palearctic 
vipers), Bitis (adders), Cerastes (horned vipers), Causus (night adders), 
Atheris (bush vipers), Echis (saw scaled vipers), Eristicophis and 
Pseudocerastes; genera of Crolatinae (pit-vipers) include Crolatus 
(rattlesnakes), Bothrops (American lanceheads), Agkistrodon, Trimeresurus 
(Asian lanceheads), Cryptelytrops and Sistrurus.

1.2.2 Venom proteins 
Venom is produced by two venom glands, which are modified salivary glands 
that are surrounded by muscle and lined by mitochondria-rich secretory 
epithelial cells. They lie in the post-orbital region of the maxilla.  Venom is a 
cocktail of enzymes, both toxic and non-toxic proteins, oligopeptides, amines, 
nucleosides, lipids, carbohydrates and inorganic salts, including metal ions.  
Toxins generally have a mass less than 150kDa and target specific receptors, 
which are located mainly on cell membranes (Mackessy, 2010). Enzymes are 
generally of molecular weight 50-150kDa, although serine proteases, 
phospholipase A2s, PI and PII snake venom metalloproteinases are less than 
40kDa (Mackessy, 2010). The catalytic properties of which have two clinically-
relevant consequences; firstly, the products of substrate degradation, which 
are not immunogenic, may be toxic in themselves; secondly, the reactions they 
catalyse are reliant on the enzymatic reaction cycle and are thus time-
dependent (Mackessy, 2010). Viperine and Crolatine venoms are enzyme-rich 
whereas elapid venoms are richer in toxins (Mackessy, 2010). However, both 
enzymes and toxins are frequently referred to as toxins and, indeed, some 
enzymes may exert a toxic effect other than that induced by their enzymatic 
action e.g. PLA2s.

The principal toxins found in viper venoms are listed in Table 1.2-1 and those 
found in elapid venoms in Table 1.2-2. The relationship between venom toxin 
composition and venom-induced pathology is discussed more fully in Section 
1.2.3 Venom pathologenesis 
Venom pathologenesis is generally divided into that which is induced at the 
bite site (local) and that which is induced by absorbed venom toxins (systemic).  
1.2.3.1 Venom induced tissue destruction 
Local injury at the bite site (Figure 1.2-3A) results mainly from the direct action 
of venom components. SVMPs hydrolyse structural proteins such as collagen 
in the basement membrane of microvessels, and the extracellular matrix 
(Herrera et al, 2015). This disruption of intercellular junctions results in local 
haemorrhage as well as allowing further ingress of venom, resulting in signs of 
systemic envenoming. Disruption of blood supply results in ischaemia, 
inflammation and poor regeneration of damaged tissues. Myotoxic PLA2 lyse 
skeletal muscle fibres and cause contraction of lymphatic vessels, effectively 
blocking lymphatic drainage and contributing to the accumulation of 
oedematous fluids (Gutierrez et al, 2009b).  The rapidity of onset of these 
effects and the release of inflammatory mediators, which influence the 
outcome of tissue derangement, precludes the use of antivenoms (Gutierrez 
et al, 1998; Gutierrez et al, 2003; Coppola et al, 1992; Chaves et al, 2005; 
Trebien et al, 1989; Battellino et al, 2003; Mora et al, 2008). Another study has 
shown that Echis carinatus venom induces neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) 
formation which, in turn, results in the occlusion of blood vessels thus trapping 
venom toxins at the bite site and contributing to additional localised tissue 
destruction (Katkar et al, 2016). 
1.2.3.2 Systemic venom pathologenesis 
1.2.3.2.1 Haemorrhage and coagulopathy 
Viper envenomation commonly results in haemorrhage and coagulopathy 
(Figure 1.2-3B), often with a multi-pronged attack on the coagulation cascade, 
platelet function, fibrin(ogen)olysis and blood vessel integrity. For almost every 
factor involved in coagulation or fibrinolysis there is a venom protein that can 
inactivate or activate it (Lu et al, 2005).  Snake venoms also act on platelets, 
blood vessel basement membranes and capillaries, contributing to the risk of 
haemorrhage.   
Figure 1.2-3: A. Localised 
signs of envenoming, 
showing blistering, necrosis 
and oedema at the bite site; 
B. Incoagulable blood after a 
Saw-scaled viper bite - whole

C. Flaccid paralysis requiring 
mechanical ventilation 
following a Common Krait 
bite; D. Fatal cerebral 
haemorrhage following 
Russells viper bite. (A-C, 
Warrell; D, Dr U Hla Mon). 
Whether the venom induces a primary coagulopathy, consumptive 
coagulopathy, thrombocytopaenia or blood vessel injury, the result is 
haemorrhage.  In addition to haemorrhage, the resultant hypovolaemia and 
shock, or thrombotic ischaemia, may result in secondary organ damage 
(White, 2005; Kini, 2006; Merle et al, 2005; Mosquera et al, 2003; Numeric et 
al, 2002; Puig et al, 1995; Markland, 1998, Markland and Swenson, 2013). 
Haemorrhages may be critical by virtue of their site, such as cerebral (Figure 
1.2-3D), intracranial (Mosquera et al, 2003), pericardial (Senthilkumaran et al, 
2012) or intrapulmonary (Warrell et al, 1977). Microangiopathy and 
intravascular thrombi (Casamento et al, 2011) result in ishaemic change in end 
organs, such as kidney (Puig et al, 1995), myocardium (Blondheim et al, 1996; 
Saadeh, 2001), lung (Bart et al, 2016) and brain (Numeric et al, 2002, Canas 
et al, 2016, Merle et al, 2005). 
1.2.3.2.2 Cardiotoxicity 
Cardiovascular changes are well documented in both man and animals and 
include myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, ST-depression, T-wave inversion or 
flattening, atrial tachycardia or fibrillation, ventricular extrasystole, atrio-
ventricular block (Karlson-Stiber et al, 2006; Anlen, 2008; Hoffman et al, 1993; 
Lervic et al, 2010; Pelander et al, 2010; personal communication, Mark 
Patteson et al, 2015).  
An unusual case of snake-bite by Vipera aspis involved a healthy 45-year-old 
male bitten on the thigh and envenomed intravascularly.  He died within 
minutes before any medical management could be instituted.  Autopsy 
revealed extensive myocardial damage with minimal local manifestations (de 
Haro et al, 2009).   
1.2.3.2.3 Neurotoxicity 
Elapid venoms contain pre- and/or post-synaptic neurotoxins which result in 
descending paralysis.  Ptosis, followed by difficulty swallowing, respiratory 
paralysis and finally, total paralysis may occur within two hours of envenoming 
(Figure 1.2-3C) and, unless given within 15 minutes, antivenom is ineffective 
(Harris et al, 2000; Ranawaka et al, 2013, Sharma et al, 2016). Post-synaptic 
toxins may produce muscle hyperexcitability (fasciculations) or tetany prior to 
flaccid paralysis (Hodgson and Davidson, 1996).  Some Viperid venoms also 
contain neurotoxins which cause symptoms such as drowsiness, diplopia, 
strabismus, vertigo and unsteady gait (Reading, 1996; Ferquel, et al, 2007).  
Secondary neural lesions may result from coagulopathies causing intracranial 
haemorrhage or thrombotic infarcts (Figure 1.2-3D) (Merle et al, 2005; 
Mosquera et al, 2003; Numeric et al, 2002). 
1.2.3.2.4 Nephrotoxicity 
Venom toxins are rarely responsible for primary acute renal failure, but may 
develop as a complication of profound hypotension, renal casts from 
myoglobin or haemoglobin and microthrombi from venom-induced 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (Azevedo-Marques et al, 1985; Paul 
and Dasgupta, 2012; Martins et al, 1998). 
1.2.3.2.5 Myotoxicity 
Myonecrosis occurs as the result of the action of myotoxic PLA2s, but is 
enhanced by the SVMP-mediated damage to the microvasculature and 
haemorrhage, which, in turn, results in poor regeneration in both muscle fibres 
and nerves (Hernandez et al, 2011). 
1.2.4 Medical Importance 
The medical importance of snakebite lies not only with mortality, but also the 
resulting permanent physical and psychological consequences.  
Local envenoming can lead to severe tissue necrosis requiring plastic surgery, 
including extensive skin grafting or amputation (Abubakar et al, 2010; Habib et 
al, 2015; West et al, 2014). Compartment syndrome, where swelling results in 
an increase in pressure of oedematous fluid in a distal limb such that vascular 
supply is compromised, is an uncommon, but significant, complication of viper 
bites (Evers et al, 2010; Bucaretchi et al, 2010). The venom of spitting cobras, 
projected into its victims eye, produces corneal erosion and ulceration, which 
may leave its victim blind due to the residual scarring (Warrell and Ormerod, 
1976). Long-term consequences include arthrodesis, chronic ulceration, 
osteomyelitis and malignant transformation (Warrell, 2010). Other significant 
complications which may occur following snakebite are: foetal loss, wound 
infections and tetanus (Habib, 2013). The resulting disfigurement from the local 
effects of venom can have catastrophic, life-changing sequelae for victims and 
their families. Victims may become social outcasts and young women may no 
longer be acceptable as a bride.  
The consequences of snakebites can have a profound effect on the local 
economy. Loss of work days result in a significant loss of income, especially 
as snakebite accidents tend to occur during the busiest periods of the year 
(Habib et al, 2013). Having to bear the cost of medical treatment may mean 
that the victim is left to die or permanently disabled, consigning the family to 
destitution and the community to a shortage of manpower (Habib, 2013). 
During planting and harvesting, especially during the rainy season, snakebite 
victims can occupy over 70% of beds in hospitals which serve these 
agricultural areas (Theakston and Warrell, 2000).  
Envenomation with haemorrhagic venom may require blood or blood product 
transfusion in addition to antivenom. Venom-induced haemorrhage or 
microthrombi occuring in a vital site, such as the brain or myocardium may 
result in fatality or that of prolonged recovery and/or permanent disability 
(Blondheim et al, 1996; Mosquera et al, 2003). 
Acute renal failure is a common complication of snakebite secondary to 
hypotension, particularly in the Indian subcontinent associated with Daboia 
russelli (Russells viper) envenomation (Paul et al, 2012) and requires dialysis 
for management of some patients, which may be unsustainable in areas where 
snakebite is common.  
Neurotoxic venom toxins may cause irreversible paralysis. These toxins are 
generally of low molecular weight and therefore undergo rapid distribution. 
Unless antivenom is administered intravenously within hours of the bite, 
respiratory paralysis is likely and, unless mechanical ventilation is available, 
death inevitable (Prasarnpun et al, 2005; Pandey et al, 2016). 
1.2.5 Treatment: Antivenom 
The only specific treatment for snake-bite envenoming is antivenom (Brown 
and Landon, 2010). However, antivenom cannot neutralise the pathological 
lesions that have occurred due to irreversible venom-induced changes, or the 
sequelae of its primary effects such as acute renal failure.  Administration of 
antivenom should not replace appropriate supportive therapy (WHO, 2010b).   
The first antivenom was produced by Albert Calmette in 1895 against the 
Indian cobra, Naja naja and, since then, the basic principles of antivenom 
production have changed little.  First generation antivenoms, which were 
produced for over a hundred years, comprised hyperimmune serum from 
animals immunised with venom (Chippaux et al, 1983).  Technologies for 
antivenom production have improved greatly, and their therapeutic 
effectiveness has been widely demonstrated, particularly for treatment of 
systemic envenomings (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003; Theakston et al, 2003; 
Gutierrez et al, 2009c).  The main active component of antivenom is IgG 
antibodies or their antibody containing fragments (see Section 1.2.5.1.2.1); 
besides having a high affinity for toxicologically relevant venom components, 
the ideal antivenom would possess a volume of distribution as close as 
possible to that of the toxins being neutralised (Gutierrez et al, 2003). 
Adverse reactions to antivenoms can be divided into immediate Type I-type 
hypersensitivity and delayed serum sickness which may occur 7-10 days after 
antivenom administration. Early adverse reactions may be caused by 
complement activation due to the presence of Fc fragments in whole IgG 
preparations, or the presence of protein aggregates (Otero et al, 1999; Herrera 
et al, 2005). Delayed reactions are related to the immunogenicity of the 
antivenom proteins, which elicit an anti-donor IgG antibody response in the 
recipient (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003; Herrera et al, 2005). 
Preclinical testing required to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
antivenoms prior to their use in clinically envenomed patients is imperative to 
avoid failure of therapy and unnecessary fatalities resulting from the use of 
ineffective antivenom. 
1.2.5.1 Antivenom production 
1.2.5.1.1 Immunisation 
1.2.5.1.1.1 Venom source 
The quality of venom used for immunisation of donor animals is important in 
producing antibodies which are effective in neutralising its pathological effects.  
Venom composition varies not only between species, but can also vary 
between individuals of that species and within individuals over time (Chippaux 
et al, 1991).  In order to obtain a representative sample of venom, it is therefore 
prudent that venom for antivenom production is extracted from multiple 
specimens differing in terms of:  
 geographical origin, relevant to the target areas for antivenom use 
 age and sex  
Health and welfare of the snakes is vital for the production of high quality 
venom. Venom is extracted from captive snakes around every 4 weeks, the 
pooled venoms lyophilised and stored at 2-8oC (Chippaux and Goyffon, 1983). 
Adjuvants are mixed with the immunogen to hold venom in the donors tissues 
to allow slow release, avoiding acute toxicity, and enhancing antibody 
production.  The most commonly used adjuvant is Freunds complete adjuvant 
(FCA) for primary immunisation and Freunds incomplete adjuvant (FIA) for 
boosters.  FIA contains emulsified mineral oil but FCA contains inactivated 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis in addition to the components of FIA.  Other 
adjuvants include aluminium salts, bentonite and liposomes (WHO, 2010a).   
A major problem with the use of adjuvants is the severe localised reactions 
which may be induced, particularly in horses, and using Freunds adjuvants. 
This may be overcome either using a low dose, low volume, multi-site 
procedure (Chowiwathanakun, 2001) or switching to an aluminium hydroxide 
adjuvant after the primary immunisations (Gutierrez et al, 2005). 
1.2.5.1.1.2  Antiserum Donor Animals 
The most important criteria for the production of antiserum is the use of healthy 
individuals as donors.   The immunisation schedule depends on the 
immunogen and adjuvant, donor species, dose of immunogen and immune 
response of the individual. 
i) Horses 
Horses have traditionally been the donor of choice due to the large volume of 
serum that can be obtained from an individual at any one time. Sedimentation 
of the red blood cells (RBC) is rapid and does not require centrifugation.  They 
are docile and therefore easy to handle and are resistant to trypanosomes in 
tropical areas. They are not susceptible to transmissible spongiform 
encepalopathies, the transmission of which is of major concern.  
ii) Sheep 
A number of factors mean that antiserum production in the UK is predominantly 
from sheep (Landon et al, 2003).  Firstly, they are widely available, relatively 
inexpensive to purchase and maintain, and produce more 
immunoglobulin/acre than horses.  Secondly, they have a much less 
pronounced inflammatory response to venom immunisation than horses and 
thus do not develop severe reactions at the immunisation sites and, in the UK, 
where animal welfare is an emotive issue, especially concerning companion 
animals, sheep are a more acceptable choice than horses. Ovine IgG is less 
glycosylated than equine IgG, claimed to be less immunogenic, and thus less 
likely to produce adverse reactions (Sjostrom et al, 1994; Angulo et al, 1997). 
Clinically, ovine derived EchiTabG caused fewer early reactions than equine 
derived EchiTab-Plus ICP (Abubakar et al, 2010b).  Finally, the use of 
antiserum pooled from a large number of individuals results in less variation of 
specific antibody levels than that from a single donor [unpublished results, 
MicroPharm Ltd].  However, the use of sheep as a donor animal may be limited 
due to perceived concerns regarding the possible transmission of spongiform 
encephalopathies from donor to patient (Lalloo and Theakston, 2003). 
iii) Other species under investigation 
Other sources of serum, such as camelids  (Cook et al, 2010a; Cook et al, 
2010b; Cook et al, 2010c) chickens (Moussa et al, 2012) and ducks (Criste et 
al, 2008), are being more widely investigated.  
Research has been undertaken to investigate the suitability of using camels as 
suitable antiserum donors, showing that they are better adapted to tropical 
climates than conventional donor species, are amenable to handling and 
bleeding and possess heavy chain only IgG, which is more heat stable than 
that of other species (Cook et al, 2010c; Cook et al, 2010a, Cook et al, 2010b). 
Antivenom made from camel antiserum would appear to be less immunogenic 
than those from horses or sheep (Herrera et al, 2005). 
IgY from chicken egg yolk is a cheap source of antivenom polyclonal antibodies 
and has the added advantage that it does not fix complement and is therefore 
less likely to induce a hypersensitivity reaction in the recipient (Lalloo et al, 
2003; Moussa et al, 2012). 
1.2.5.1.1.3  Immunisation procedure 
Optimal IgG titres are obtained by the low volume, low dose, multiple site 
immunisation close to drainage lymph nodes (Figure 1.2-4A) and when 
injected subcutaneously (Pratanathonet al, 1997; Chotwiwatthanakun et al, 
2001; WHO, 2010a). 
Figure 1.2-4: A  Immunisation in proximity to drainage lymph nodes; B  Bleeding 
the donor; C  Rotation of harvested blood to accelerate clotting 
1.2.5.1.1.4  Harvesting blood 
Blood may be collected once peak antibody production has been reached 
(Figure 1.2-4B), around 16 weeks after primary immunisation (Al-Abdulla et al, 
2013), then every 3-8 weeks thereafter (WHO, 2010a). It is essential that the 
donor animals are healthy when blood is harvested. Venom specific antibody 
levels are monitored using ELISA or small scale affinity chromatography 
(Figure 1.2-5).  
Figure 1.2-5: Specific venom 
antibody response in a flock of 
25 sheep immunised with Vipera 
spp of venom, measured by small 
scale affinity chromatography 
(SSAC). (MicroPharm: personal 
data). 
Around 10mls/Kg body weight of blood may be harvested, under aseptic 
conditions, via the external jugular vein and the red cells removed (Figure 
1.2-4B). The RBCs may be re-infused into the donor animal to prevent 
anaemia, and resulting plasma or serum pooled before storage at -20oC until 
required. 
1.2.5.1.2 Antibody purification 
1.2.5.1.2.1  Purification of IgG 
Precipitation 
Antivenom manufacture from pooled serum or plasma involves purification of 
IgG from other blood proteins in serum; the purification also concentrates the 
specific antibodies.  The utilisation of highly purified IgG fragments leads to 
better tolerance and a higher efficacy (Chippaux, 1998).   
Immunoglobulins may be purified in a number of ways.  They may be 
precipitated using ammonium sulphate (Lalloo et al, 2003) or sodium sulphate 
(Smith et al, 1992), then resuspended in appropriate buffer.  Caprylic acid 
precipitates unwanted components of serum, mainly albumin, leaving the IgG 
in solution (Gutierrez et al, 2005; Rojas et al, 1994). Purification of F(ab)2 by 
caprylic acid was compared to that purified by ammonium sulphate 
precipitation and was found to be free of albumin and other plasma proteins 
whereas the latter was not (Dos Santos et al, 1989). Caprylic acid purified IgG 
remains in solution which retains its binding activity better, and is less likely to 
form aggregates than the resuspended IgG after ammonium or sodium 
sulphate purification.   
Cleavage of IgG 
IgG molecules may be cleaved by pepsin (Jones and Landon, 2003) or papain 
digestion (Smith et al, 1992; Rawat et al, 1994), as shown in Figure 1.2-6 with 
the advantage that smaller molecules have a larger volume of distribution and, 
theoretically, lower immunoreactivity, providing superior protection (Al-Abdulla 
et al, 2003; Laing et al, 1995).  Theoretically, cleavage and removal (by anion 
exchange) of the Fc fragment translates into a product with fewer adverse 
reactions. 
Fab fragments (MW 50,000) have the largest volume of distribution (equal to 
that of extra-cellular fluid [ECF]) and the shortest elimination half-life. IgG (MW 
150,000Da) has the lowest volume of distribution (equal to the blood volume 
compartment) and the longest elimination half-life (Gutierrez et al, 2003). 
F(ab)2 fragments (MW 100,000Da) are somewhere in between (Ho et al, 1990; 
Pepin-Covatta et al, 1995; Lomonte et al, 2009).  However, these would appear 
to be inconsistent findings as others have showed that F(ab)2 was most rapidly 
distributed, IgG most slowly and Fab between.  It was concluded that F(ab)2 
was the most suitable fragment for the treatment of snake and scorpion 
envenomings (Ismail and Abd-Elsalam, 1998; Riviere et al, 1997). Using 
smaller fragments would not appear to translate into better neutralisation of 
local effects of envenomation (Leon et al, 2000; Leon et al, 2001; Burnouf et 
al, 2004).  
Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of IgG and its fragments is altered by the 
tissue destructive effects of venom toxins. On the one hand, damaged blood 
supply can impede distribution of antibodies, but on the other hand, damaged 
blood vessels can allow larger molecular weight compounds to move more 
easily into the extracellular fluid compartment. Ultimately the choice of IgG or 
fragment needs to be based on the most lethal venom toxins and their potential 
distribution (Gutierrez et al, 2003a; Gutierrez et al, 2007).

digestion yielding F(ab)2 fragments or by papain yielding Fab fragments. 
(http://www.rockland-inc.com/antibody-fragmentation-services.aspx). 
Further purification 
Further purification of IgG or its fragments may be achieved by using one or 
more of the following steps: 
 Diafiltration to remove salts by passage through a dialysis membrane, 
which will remove all molecules smaller than the molecular weight cut-
off of the membrane. 
 Adsorption onto aluminium hydroxide to remove lipids 
 Ion exchange, which involves passage of the product through a 
chromatography column, exchanging small anions or cations for those 
that need to be removed. 
 Anion exchange to remove the Fc fragment  
 Cation exchange to remove papain from Fab formulations.   
 Affinity purification, using venom covalently coupled to a cyanogen 
bromide-activated Sepharose 4B column, may be used to purify specific 
antibodies (Smith et al, 1992).  Here the IgG is passed down the column 
 only venom-specific antibodies bind to the venom on the column, the 
rest are washed off.  The electrostatically bound antibodies are eluted 
by reducing the pH sufficient to disrupt the venom-antivenom binding 
without damaging them.  The resulting antivenom contains only venom-
specific antibodies (around 10% of total IgG).  The disadvantage is that 
the cost of manufacture is vastly increased (by around 10 fold). 
1.2.5.1.2.2  Viral filtration/removal 
To date there have been no recorded cases of viral transmission to patients 
treated with antivenoms.  However, the potential for viral transmission from 
donor to patient exists and thus steps to remove possible infectious agents are 
required for all new antivenoms produced in Europe and the USA (Ph. Eur., 
2014; WHO, 2010; Theakston et al, 2003; Burnouf et al, 2004). 
Caprylic acid is efficient for the removal of enveloped viruses and moderately 
efficient at removing non-enveloped viruses (Mpandi et al, 2007).  This method 
may be used as a viral inactivation phase prior to viral filtration (WHO, 2010a). 
The process involves passing the product through a 15-30nm filter.  The 
process also adds a significant cost to the final product because the expensive 
filters cannot be used more than once, there are losses during filtration, and 
the product requires re-concentration after filtration, therefore increasing 
manufacturing time and requirements for validation of the procedures. 
1.2.5.1.2.3  Final formulation 
The final product is formulated as liquid in an appropriate buffer at a suitable 
pH.  Additives such as Tween (a detergent) or sugars, such as trehalose, may 
be added to improve stability and prevent aggregate formation. 
A liquid formulation of ovine IgG in sodium citrate buffered saline, pH 6.0 was 
shown to be stable at 4oC or at room temperature for more than 3.5 years, and 
can be exposed to tropical temperatures for at least a month without losing 
immunoglobulin binding activity (Al-Abdulla et al, 2003; Al-Abdulla et al, 2013). 
A freeze-dried product is more stable in tropical climates, however, freeze 
drying increases cost of production.  Reconstitution before administration may 
also be slow, sometimes taking more than 20 minutes, which is not ideal in a 
clinical situation.  However, recent technical developments have reduced i) 
cost and ii) efficiency of resuspension (Cherry et al, 2014). 
1.2.5.1.3 Assessment 
Both the WHO guidelines (WHO, 2010a) and the European Pharmacopoeia 
(Ph.Eur, 2014) advocate the use of as wide a range as possible of both in vivo 
and in vitro tests to assess quality and efficacy of antivenoms. 
1.2.5.1.3.1 Physicochemical properties 
The physicochemical properties of the final product are defined in the 
European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur, 2014) and in the WHO guidelines for 
antivenom production (WHO 2010a).  
 If in liquid form, the product should be free of visible particles (WHO, 
2010a). 
 Total protein concentration may be measured using a colorimetric 
method (Bradford, 1976) or by absorption at 280nm (WHO, 2010a). 
 Purity may be assessed using SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-
reducing conditions, the electrophoretic pattern being compared to a 
reference preparation (WHO, 2010a). 
 Purity may also be assessed using fast-phase liquid chromatography 
(FPLC) or size exclusion chromatography to demonstrate the proportion 
of total IgG or its fragments and the presence of impurities such as 
albumin or small molecular fragments from the digestion process. 
 The product must be from free of bacteria, viruses and mycoplasma. 
Validation of virus removal steps is sufficient to show a product free from 
viruses, but microbiological examination is required to show that there 
are no bacteria or mycoplasma present.  
 Freedom from bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) (WHO, 
2010a). 
 Preservatives such as Phenol or Cresol may be added to the final 
product to maintain sterility. 
1.2.5.1.3.2  Binding 
Binding of antivenom to venom is not synonymous with neutralisation of venom 
toxicity.  Toxic venom proteins may be large enough to have more than one 
potential binding site.  If antibody binding does not alter the toxic proteins 
active site in such a way that it can no longer bind to its biological target, either 
by binding to its active site or by stoichometrically altering its active site, then 
neutralisation of its induced lesions will not occur. Polyclonal antivenom IgGs 
bind to all venom proteins, not all of which are toxic or cause significant 
pathological lesions i.e. binding is not necessarily significant. 
Enzyme-immunosorbent assays (ELISA)  
ELISA is a means of measuring binding of antibodies to antigen (see Chapter 
2).  It is a very sensitive means of screening antivenoms or antisera for their 
ability to bind to venom (Sjostrom et al, 1996; Peres et al, 2006; Theakston et 
al, 1979). It is not a good predictor of antivenom efficacy for the reasons given 
above.  However, it is reported, that by using an ELISA protocol which 
measures venom-antivenom complexes, antivenom efficacy can be predicted 
(OLeary et al, 2014).   
One disadvantage of this inherently sensitive test system, especially in tropical 
areas is that non-specific reactivity, cross-reactivity and the quality of reagents 
can effect both sensitivity and specificity of venom antigen and antibody 
detection assays. To exploit its potential as the most versatile immunoassay 
technique in snake bite research, the test conditions of the ELISA will have to 
be much more stringently controlled than they are at present (Ho et al, 1986). 
Small scale affinity chromatography (SSAC)  
The use of SSAC is a method of quantifying venom specific antibodies (VSAb) 
in antivenoms has been developed, based on affinity purification of antibodies 
for antivenom manufacture (Smith et al, 1992).  Briefly, venom is covalently 
coupled to a gel (solid phase), antibodies are added to and incubated with the 
gel.  Unbound protein is washed off, then the bound antibodies eluted by 
lowering the pH.  The protein concentration of the eluate is measured at 280nm 
and, from this, the VSAb concentration of the original solution calculated (see 
Chapter 2). The procedure has the advantage over ELISA in that it provides a 
g/L measurement of venom-specific antibodies and involves fewer steps.  
Once columns are coupled, they can be re-used in excess of 90 times 
(Harrison, 2004).  
Preparation of the columns are described (Smith et al, 1992) and the assay 
has been used in assessment of antivenoms and antisera from both ovine and 
equine origin.  The results correlated well with ELISA titres (Al-Asmari et al, 
1996; Jones et al, 1999; Rawat et al, 1994 Casewell et al, 2010; Sjostrom et 
al, 1994). 
Disadvantages include a degree of non-specific binding, which may not be 
constant in the presence of high affinity antibodies, and incomplete elution of 
very high affinity antibodies.  The latter can partially be overcome by reducing 
the elution pH further, to a level at which the antibodies may be damaged and 
rendered ineffective. This is not acceptable for manufacture, but produces 
more consistent results for measurement purposes (MicroPharm  
unpublished results). Preparation of the gel column and performing multiple 
assays can be more time consuming than ELISA.  
Western Blot  
Immunoblotting permits determination of venom proteins bound by antivenom 
antibodies. This technique may also demonstrate cross-reactivity between 
snake venoms and antibodies directed against a heterologous species, and is 
a useful adjunct to assess the immune reactivity of antivenom IgGs to venom 
proteins. However, like the above in vitro assays, it cannot be used to predict 
antivenom efficacy at neutralisation of venom toxicity.  
Western blotting is a useful technique for demonstrating deficiencies in 
antivenom binding to separated venom proteins, by identifying missing protein 
bands in the blot compared to the stained gel, but does not quantify the amount 
of binding i.e. it is qualitative, not quantitative. On the other hand, ELISA (and 
SSAC) measure the total binding of antivenom to all venom proteins. 
These binding assays are useful in identifying antivenoms with poor/no venom 
binding potential and thus eliminating the need to test the efficacy of these 
antivenoms in vivo. 
1.2.5.1.3.3  Potency and toxicity 
The WHO state that in vivo assays are the best test of antivenom efficacy.  
Standard assays have been developed by the WHO to characterise snake 
venoms and to assess the neutralising potential of antivenoms.  These assays 
measure lethal, defibrinogenating, procoagulant, haemorrhagic and 
necrotising properties of snake venoms (Theakston et al, 1983; WHO, 2010a).  
Median lethal dose (LD50)  
LD50 is the dose of venom, injected into the tail vein, which kills 50% of mice 
over 24 hours (WHO, 2010a) as shown in Figure 1.2-7. The results are 
analysed using a Probit analysis (Finney, 1971; Ownby, 1984), Spearman-
Karmer or other non-parametric test (WHO, 2010a).  
Median effective dose (ED50)  
ED50 is the dose of antivenom required to prevent the death of mice, which 
have been injected with a pre-incubated mixture of venom (2x to 5x LD50) with 
antivenom, over a period of 24 hours (WHO, 2010a) as shown in Figure 1.2-7.  
ED50 may be used to predict clinical effectiveness of an antivenom, not only 
against the species of snake venom against which it is directed, but also 
against other closely related species (WHO, 2010a; Casewell et al, 2010).  The 
ED50 was used to design a dose-finding human clinical trial of EchiTabG 
(Abubakar et al, 2010). 
Using an ED50 a number of antivenoms have been shown to have an important 
degree of paraspecific protection within closely related snakes, which has 
implications for distribution of these antivenoms (Archundia et al, 2011; 
Bogarin et al, 2000; Casewell et al, 2010; Segura et al, 2010; Gutierrez et al, 
2013a). 
Minimum coagulant dose (MCD)  
MCD is defined as the least amount of venom (in mg dry weight per litre test 
solution) that clots either a solution of bovine fibrinogen (2g/L) in 60 seconds 
at 37oC (MCD-F) and/or standard citrated solution of human plasma (fibrinogen 
content, 2.8g/L) in 60 seconds at 37oC (MCD-P). MCD is calculated by plotting 
clotting time against venom concentration and reading off the level at the 60 
second clotting time. 
Minimum haemorrhagic dose (MHD)  
MHD is defined as the least amount of venom (g dry weight) which, when 
injected intradermally into mice or rats, results in a haemorrhagic lesion of 
10mm diameter 24 hours later.  Results are calculated by plotting mean lesion 
diameter against venom dose. 
An alternative to MHD for venom is performed by injecting venom 
intramuscularly and measuring the amount of haemoglobin in muscle extract.  
Results are comparable with conventional MHD (Ownby et al, 1984). 
Figure 1.2-7: A diagramatic representation of median lethal dose and median effective 
dose (WHO 2010a) 
Minimum necrotising dose (MND)  
MND is defined as the least amount of venom (g dry weight) which, when 
injected intradermally into mice and/or rats, results in a necrotic lesion of 5mm 
diameter 3 days later.  Results are calculated as for MHD 
Minimum defibrinogenating dose (MDD)  
MDD is defined as the minimum dose of venom which produces non-clotting 
blood within 60 minutes of intravenous injection into a mouse.  
A second method is the fibrin polymerisation time (MDD-FPT).  A standard 
curve prepared from normal mouse blood is prepared and the fibrinogen 
content of each sample calculated from the standard curve.  The MDD-FPT is 
defined as the dose of venom resulting in a decrease in fibrinogen level to 10% 
of that for the standard fibrinogen solution. 
Results of a combination of these assays, proteolytic and venom-induced 
oedema showed little or no relationship between the properties of the different 
venoms and that the determination of one cannot predict the value of the 
others.  Therefore, characterization of all activities of venom must be 
performed in order to evaluate its toxicity and neutralisation (Sanchez et al, 
1992).  
Toxicity assay 
This assay is used to identify any adverse effects of the antivenom.  A group 
of five mice are injected with antivenom intra-peritoneally and observed for 
signs of toxicity for a period of 7 days.  If any adverse effects are detected, a 
post mortem examination is performed. 
1.2.5.1.3.4  Clinical trials 
In vivo and in vitro tests of efficacy do not mimic subcutaneous deposition of 
venom and subsequent intravenous antivenom that occurs in the human 
victim. Ultimately, clinical testing must be used as the most important 
determinant of antivenom efficacy. Human clinical trials normally take place in 
three stages: 
Phase I.:  Healthy volunteers: In the case of snake antivenoms, treating healthy 
volunteers is not without risk of adverse effects and sensitisation to the donor 
species proteins, so is generally not performed.  However, in vivo toxicity 
testing is performed in mice or guinea pigs and, in the case of Veterinary 
antivenoms, safety studies in the target species are performed. 
Phase II:  Clinical efficacy and dose finding studies.  Because of the potentially 
catastrophic effect of untreated envenoming, withholding effective treatment is 
not ethical in order to perform the gold standard blinded placebo controlled 
trial, but a randomised controlled double blind trial comparing two antivenoms 
can be employed (Abubakar et al, 2010; Abubakar et al, 2010b; Karlson-Stiber 
et al, 1997; Otero et al, 1999; Otero-Patino et al, 1998). Improvement in clinical 
score may be used as a means of assessing antivenom efficacy in envenomed 
patients (Peterson et al, 2011; Smalligan et al, 2004; Woods and Young, 2011). 
Phase III:  More extensive clinical trials and collection of data relating to 
efficacy and occurrence of adverse reactions (Ramos-Cerrillo et al, 2008; 
Petras et al, 2010).  
1.2.5.1.3.5  Antivenom stability 
 Antivenom stability can be defined as maintenance of antibody activity and 
physicochemical properties, without the formation of aggregates or potentially 
harmful degradation products. Stability studies are required to show that the 
antivenom remains stable over the period prior to expiry date, and how stable 
it is if inadvertently removed from the cold chain and exposed to tropical 
temperatures (Segura et al, 2009; Al-Abdulla et al, 2013). 
1.2.6 Treatment challenges and antivenom alternatives 
In areas of the world in which snake-bite mortality and morbidity are highest, 
there is a deficiency in the supply of effective and affordable antivenoms.  This 
has been addressed to some extent by the development of new antivenoms 
for these areas (Theakston, 2000; Casewell et al, 2010; Laing et al,1995; Laing 
et al, 2003a, Laing et al, 1993b; Abubakar I. et al, 2010, Abubakar S. et al, 
2010b; Al-Abdulla et al, 2003; Ramos-Carillo et al, 2008; Chippaux et al, 
2007a; Cook et al, 2010a; Cook et al, 2010b; Cook et al, 2010c; Gutierrez et 
al, 2005; Williams et al, 2011; Sanchez et al 2017). Antivenom production is 
often driven by cost rather than quality, which led to a crisis in antivenom 
supply to Africa at the end of the twentieth century (Brown and Landon, 2010; 
Laing et al, 2003a, Theakston and Warrell, 2000).  
Unscrupulous marketing and labelling of antivenom with ambiguous snake 
names has led to supply of inappropriate antivenoms to treat patients in a 
region in which the snakes are antigenically distinct from those used in its 
manufacture (Warrell, 2008). Use of these ineffective products leads to a crisis 
of confidence in crucial antivenom therapy and an increase in reliance on 
traditional remedies (Williams et al, 2011). This was illustrated by a study which 
showed that geographically appropriate antivenom is effective at resolving the 
coagulopathy induced by E. ocellatus envenoming but not against Asian E. 
carinatus envenoming (and vice versa) (Habib et al, 2013). 
Supportive therapy is important in the management of snake-bite cases and 
includes wound care, tetanus prophylaxis, infection control and, if appropriate, 
surgical management of local envenoming.  Pain relief should be administered, 
paracetamol or opiates being the drugs of choice.  Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs are contra-indicated due to potential enhancement of 
primary or secondary venom effects such as coagulopathy or compromised 
renal function.  Patients with respiratory, renal or circulatory failure need 
resuscitation, as well as antivenom; in cases of neurotoxic envenoming, 
intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required for several days (WHO 
2010b).   
Once antivenom has been administered, blood or blood products can be 
administered, but the benefits need to be weighed against the risk of possible 
contamination with infections such as Hepatitis B virus or HIV.  However, in 
cases of hyperfibrinolysis, the administration of fresh frozen plasma, without 
antivenom, may deepen the crisis by adding more substrate, with production 
of more degradation products and increased risk of secondary renal failure 
(White, 2005; WHO, 2010b; Kalyan-Kumar, 2010).  
Traditional and herbal remedies are generally ineffective and pose a threat by 
preventing or delaying the victims transportation to hospital (Chippaux et al, 
2007b).  However, some plants, such as Hibiscus aethopicus L, may contain 
endogenous inhibitors of venom-induced haemorrhage (Hasson et al, 2010; 
Abd-Elsalam, 2011). 
Natural inhibitors occur in the plasma and/or muscle of both non-venomous 
and venomous snakes, as well as some special mammals, such as possums 
and hedgehogs, which prevent the deleterious action of venom components 
such as metalloproteinases (Perales et al, 2005; Nobuhisa et al, 1998; Huang 
et al, 1998). 
The use of venomics and antivenomics to identify deficiencies in antivenom 
efficacy prior to clinical use is a powerful research tool. Traditional antivenoms 
contain polyclonal antibodies, which are not all venom-specific.  Even affinity 
purified antivenoms contain antibodies to non-toxic components of venom. The 
use of toxin-specific transcriptomic immunogens and monoclonal antibodies 
(Kulkeaw et al, 2009) is being investigated, the objective being to produce 
antivenom which is effective against all the medically important snake venoms 
in a particular region and which contains only antibodies directed against the 
significantly pathogenic toxins found in these venoms (Harrison et al, 2011). 
Research is being undertaken to investigate specific treatment of the localised 
effects of venom, which are refractory to antivenom therapy (Gutierrez et al, 
2007; Lomonte et al, 1994a; Lomonte et al, 1994b; Melo et al, 1993) and which 
delay uptake of venom by the lymphatics until treatment can be instigated (Saul 
et al, 2011). 
1.3 The 3Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of 
Animals in Research)  
The concept of the 3Rs was introduced in 1959 by Russell and Burch to find 
alternative methods to animal-based testing (Purchase et al, 1998). 
The principles of the 3Rs were developed over 50 years ago as a framework 
for humane animal research. They have subsequently become embedded in 
national and international legislation regulating the use of animals in scientific 
procedures. Opinion polls consistently show that in the UK support for animal 
research is conditional on the implementation of the 3Rs. 
Reduction can be defined as the use of methods which reduce the number of 
animals used per experiment or the number of in vivo experiments performed.  
In this thesis I investigated methods to identify and reject poor quality 
antivenoms prior to in vivo preclinical testing, thus reducing the number of 
experimental animals required (see Chapters 3 and 4). 
Refinement can be defined as methods which minimise suffering and improve 
animal welfare. Here the use of analgesics and definition of more humane 
endpoints are investigated.  A system of facial grimaces, the Mouse Grimace 
Scale (MGS) combined with activity, behavioural, physiological and 
neurological observations were used to assess pain and discomfort, and to 
define humane endpoints (see Chapters 5 and 6). 
During this work, techniques were developed to define pain and humane 
endpoints more objectively. These are described in detail in Chapter 2A and 
include scores of activity, neurological function and pathological lesions in 
relation to survival time (pathology-survival score [PSS]) 
Replacement is defined as the use of methods which avoid or replace the use 
of animals.  In this project the use of cell based assays is investigated as an in 
vitro alternative to in vivo venom assays (see Chapter 8). 
http://altweb.jhsph.edu/pubs/books/humane_exp/het-toc
During the course of this research, post mortem examinations were performed 
on mice undergoing venom lethality assays.  It became apparent that each 
venom exhibited a unique set of pathological lesions, the severity of which 
were dose and time dependent.  Gross observations were corroborated with 
histopathological examination.  The relevance of these findings are discussed 
in Chapter 7. 
Today the 3Rs are increasingly seen as a framework for conducting high 
quality science in the academic and industrial sectors with more focus on 
developing alternative approaches which avoid the use of animals. There are 
a number of reasons for this including the need for better models and tools 
that more closely reflect human biology and predict the efficacy and safety of 
new medicines. (NC3Rs  www.nc3rs.org.uk8) 
The WHO recommend the preclinical testing of every batch of new or existing 
antivenom. There are around 45 antivenom manufacturers worldwide, 
producing in the region of 120 different antivenoms. It is estimated that as the 
result of murine assays to characterise snake venom and establish the 
efficacy of these therapeutic antivenoms, well in excess of 30,000 mice 
undergo testing and therefore suffer pain, distress and death.  This also 
equates to a substantial financial burden, which serves to increase the cost of 
efficacious antivenoms, which are already beyond the means of many of the 
victims of snakebite. 
1.4 Snakes selected for study 
To examine the viability of incorporating the 3Rs into antivenom preclinical 
efficacy testing, African snakes of distinct genera (two vipers and two elapids), 
that exhibit variation in venom protein composition and that cause distinct 
pathological lesions were selected.  This strategy was selected because the 
outputs from this spectrum of snake venoms are intended to be applied to 
preclinical testing of snake venoms globally. The only venomous snake native 
8 06/01/2017 
http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/
to the UK, namely Vipera berus was also selected because antivenoms 
directed against this snake venom are routinely tested in vivo, for regulatory 
purposes, by the ARVRU and thus this constituted a reduction in the animals 
required to collect necessary data for this work. 
1.4.1  Echis ocellatus 
Echis ocellatus, the West African saw-scaled viper was chosen because of its 
haemotoxic venom, which results in a coagulopathy, primarily due to 
consumption of clotting factors. It is also the snake which is responsible for a 
higher mortality than any other snake in the world (Theakston, 2000). The 
venom proteome is illustrated in Section 1.5.1 and its relationship to observed 
venom-induced lesions discussed.  
Local envenoming produces blisters that may become necrotic, with extensive 
localised swelling and bruising (Figure 1.4-1C). Sequelae frequently include 
the need for skin grafting or amputation (Figure 1.4-1D1-3), resulting in 
permanent disfigurement and loss of earning capacity.   
Incoagulable blood results from a consumptive coagulopathy due to venom 
prothrombin activators. This is manifested clinically by persistent local 
bleeding, even from old wounds, and spontaneous systemic haemorrhage, 
especially from the gingival sulci (Figure 1.4-1E).   
In addition to the procoagulant and other toxins affecting clotting and platelet 
function, the tendancy to haemorrhage is further aggravated by lysis of 
collagen in the basement membrane of blood vessels.  This multi-pronged 
attack has profound clinical consequences, which commonly include epistaxis, 
blood stained saliva, melaena and haematomas, subconjunctival, gut, 
retroperitoneal, extrapleural, genito-urinary bleeding and intracerebral 
haemorrhage  a rare cause of fatalities.  Intra-uterine and post-partum 
bleeding is life-threatening to both pregnant women and their unborn foetus.  
Renal failure is uncommon, but may occur secondarily after profound 
hypotension and haemorrhagic shock (WHO, 2010b; Warrell et al, 1977; 
Markland, 1998).  
Figure 1.4-1: A - Echis ocellatus is a small venomous viper with characteristic eye-
spots along its length (A - http://snakedatabase.org/species/Echis/ocellatus).  It is usually 
30-50cm long, rarely more than 60cm and has specialised scales which, when rubbed 
together, produce a sawing sound  a warning behaviour prior to striking.  It lays around 6-
20 eggs, usually at the end of the dry season, the hatchlings are 10-12cm.  It inhabits the 
agricultural areas of West Africa  Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina 
Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, southern Niger, Nigeria, northern Cameroon and south-
western Chad (B: the distribution of E. ocellatus is shown in blue, and the related species

2010)). C: local envenoming (WHO, 2010b); D1-3: Necrosis resulting in above-knee

1.4.2 Bitis arietans 
Bitis arietans  the puff adder  was selected because it causes haemorrhage 
with no coagulopathy.  It is a medically important snake with a much wider 
distribution than, but overlapping with that of E.ocellatus and is thought to be 
responsible for the majority of serious envenomations throughout Africa (WHO, 
2010b).  The venom proteome and its relationship to observed leions is 
discussed in Section 1.5.2.  
Figure 1.4-2: Bitis arietans is a large, thick snake with the typical triangular viper head (A 
http://www.biolib.cz/en/image/id30446/) found throughout much of Africa (B - 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitis_arietans).  Its average length is 90  110 cm and its 
orange and brown colouration with black chevron-like markings in combination with heavily 
keeled scales give it a rather dull appearance.  It is an ambush predator, preferring rodents 
or birds and, because it has few natural predators of its own, can often be seen in the open, 
particularly at night.  Despite being a generally sluggish reptile it is one of the fastest striking 
snakes in the world.  It delivers in excess of 100-300 mg of cytotoxic venom per bite, 
sufficient to cause death in a human victim.  As part of its warning display it inflates and 
deflates its body, causing a hissing sound and hence its common name (Puff Adder).  It is 
ovoviviparous, giving birth to 20-50 young after a gestation period of 7-9 months (Sprawls). 
Figures C (Warrell in WHO, 2010b), D C (Warrell in WHO, 2010b) and E 
(http://ktmc.info/puff-adder-bite) illustrate the effects of its venom cytotoxins. 
Local swelling of the bite site is often extensive and may involve the entire 
bitten limb, extending to the trunk. Characteristic blistering (Figure 1.4-2C) and 
necrosis (Figure 1.4-2D) occur at the bite site with extravasation of plasma, 
which may result in hypovolaemic shock.  Compartmental syndrome may 
develop, which, in turn, may lead to ischaemic necrosis.   
In systemic envenomation, there may be myocardial effects and arrhythmias, 
commonly sinus bradycardia, which may contribute to the profound adenosine-
induced hypotension. Hypotension may be further exacerbated by the 
presence of 5-nucleotidase, which hydrolyses nucleotides generating more 
purines, such as adenosine (Aird, 2002). 
The venom of this species contains toxins which inhibit platelet aggregation 
and prolong bleeding time. It addition, other toxins which induce platelet 
aggregation, making platelets unavailable, resulting in thrombocytopaenia. 
This manifests clinically as petechiation of serosal surfaces and skin (White, 
2005), and spontaneous bleeding and bruising may occur. Whilst no 
coagulopathy has been observed in Nigerian bite victims, in East and South 
Africa, both coagulopathy and cerebral thrombosis has been recorded, which 
suggests that there may be more than one species of puff adder (WHO, 
2010b). 
1.4.3 Naja nigricollis 
Naja nigricollis  the black-necked spitting cobra (Figure 1.4-3B) - was chosen 
as an elapid snake with a powerfully cytotoxic venom, which may be projected 
into the eye of its victim, resulting in corneal necrosis and even permanent 
blindness (Figure 1.4-3G).  
The venom is cytotoxic, cardiotoxic and necrotising but, unlike other elapids, 
shows little signs of neurotoxicity in man.  Bites cause local necrosis (Figure 
1.4-3, E and F) and there is immediate pain at the bite site with enlarged and 
tender lymph nodes. This is followed by vomiting, extensive local swelling, 
blistering and necrosis of the bite site, involving only the skin and superficial 
connective tissues.  Spread of venom via the lymphatics may result in skip 
lesions  strips of affected skin separated by strips of normal skin.   
Haematological changes include neutrophilia and evidence of complement 
activation.  Chronic ulceration, osteomyelitis, arthrodesis, hypertrophic scars, 
keloid formation and, after several years, malignant transformation or 
Marjolins ulcer which is a type of squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 1.4-3C) 
are some of the long-term sequelae of bites by this species (WHO, 2010b; 
Warrell, 1976). 
Figure 1.4-3: Naja nigricollis (B http://www.venomstreet.com/Naja%20nigricollis.htm) 
occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa  
(A https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Naja_nigricollis_range.png). It grows to 1.2  
2.2m in length and preys primarily on rodents.  It is oviparous, laying 10-15 eggs, which take 
60-70 days to hatch. Human victims are usually bitten in their huts at night whilst the snake 
is hunting rodents.  When threatened, like other cobras, it rears up and expands its hood 
using modified ribs.  It is from this position that it sprays venom over some considerable 
distance at its aggressor (D - Wuster) thus causing irritation on contact with the skin or 
cornea. If venom enters the eye corneal necrosis resulting in temporary or permanent 
blindness (G Warrell in WHO, 2010b) may occur. Local necrosis at the bite site (E Warrell 
in WHO, 2010b) with subsequent debridement (F Warrell in WHO, 2010b) is shown. In the 
long term, malignant transformation may occur (C Warrell in WHO, 2010b). 
1.4.4 Dendroaspis angusticeps 
Dendroaspis angusticeps  the Eastern green mamba (Figure 1.4-4A) - was 
chosen because it is an elapid with a primarily neurotoxic venom, the effects 
of which are irreversible, unless antivenom is rapidly administered. The 
resultant descending paralysis, including the muscles of respiration, is 
inevitable, and, without access to assisted ventilation for 5-7 days post 
envenoming, the prognosis is poor.   
Figure 1.4-4:  Dendroaspis angusticeps inhabits the East coast of Africa (D). It is an 
arboreal snake, feeding on small birds, mammals, amphibians and lizards.  It is bright green 
in colour and grows to a length of up to 2.5m  
(A http://picssr.com/tags/gr%C3%BCnemamba/page2).  It has a lifespan of 10-15 years and 
is oviparous, with a gestation period of around two and a half months. They are elusive 
snakes therefore human envenoming is relatively rare. Its neurotoxic venom causes 
paralysis, starting with ptosis (B Iain Thirsk in WHO, 2010b) and descending to the 
respiratory muscles, death is inevitable unless the patient can be artificially ventilated (C 
Warrell, 1999).  
The venom contains small proteins, called fasciculins, unique to this species 
and which bind to acetylcholinesterase, prolonging the presence of 
acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle fasciculations 
(Lauridsen et al, 2016). Dendrotoxins, which are unique to the Dendroaspis 
genus and homologous to Kunitz-like serine proteinase inhibitors, cause 
paralysis by binding to voltage-gated potassium channels resulting in a 
depolarising neuromuscular blockade.  (Barrett et al, 1979; Lauridsen et al, 
2016). The result is paraesthesia, signs of autonomic nervous system 
stimulation (salivation and sweating) and muscle fasciculations, which may be 
confused with shivering. The venom also contains a number of other toxins of 
the 3FTx family.  Notably the venom does not contain -neurotoxins, unlike its 
close relative, D. polylepis, the black mamba (Lauridsen et al, 2016). 
Rapid descending muscular paralysis (Figure 1.4-4B&C) may progress to 
respiratory failure, which is inevitably fatal without assisted ventilation.  
Patients often complain of severe local pain, excessive salivation, a strange 
taste in the mouth, diarrhoea, involuntary muscle contractions and recurrent 
paralysis, despite antivenom treatment. Unlike other mambas, D. angusticeps 
envenoming can cause local tissue swelling and coagulation disturbances. 
(WHO, 2010b).  Recently, the venom has been shown to contain SVMPs, 
CRISP, galactose-binding lectins, hyaluronidase, peptidases and nerve growth 
factors, which could explain these other symptoms of envenoming (Lauridsen 
et al, 2016), and a cardiotoxin has also been described (Mbugua et al, 1988). 
1.4.5 Vipera berus 
Vipera berus, the European adder, is the only venomous snake found in the 
UK. Envenomations rarely result in fatality, but can produce life-threatening 
complications.  This is particularly true in children and the elderly, and may 
therefore incur significant cost both for immediate life-saving treatment as well 
as long term sequelae.  Only 14 fatalities have been recorded in the UK 
between 1876 and 1976 (Reid, 1976), but up to 50% of recorded cases have 
significant local or systemic signs (Harborne, 1993). 
Figure 1.4-5: Vipera berus is a small, stout-bodied snake with a triangular head and a 
striking black zig-zag pattern along its back (A http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/common-
viper-photo-1704.html). It is usually slow moving and tends to lie in wait until its prey comes 
within striking distance.  Its diet consists mainly of small rodents, and, depending on climate, 
hibernates from October to April, mating on emergence from hibernation. It is ovoviviparous 
and live young are produced in summer or autumn.  It inhabits an area from just within the 
Arctic Circle extending throughout Europe, apart from the most southerly parts of Spain, 
Italy and Greece (E https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipera_berus). Severe localised swelling 
occurs at the bite site in a human (B http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-
1296520/Adder-bite-leaves-father-blinded-choking-just-minutes-death-walk-family.html) 
and dogs (C https://terriermandotcom.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/death-before-discomfort-
says.html &D Kate Kenyon, personal communication) (bitten hand/limb compared to 
normal). 
Its venom is rapidly lethal to mice and causes significant local tissue damage 
 oedema, haemorrhage and moderate myonecrosis (Calderon et al, 1993).  
The venom components and their relationship to observed pathological lesions 
is discussed further in Section 1.5.3. 
In humans, snake bites by this species result in localised pain and swelling 
extending up the bitten limb to the trunk (Figure 1.4-5C).  If there is systemic 
envenomation, the most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea 
and abdominal pain.  Hypotension and shock, angioedema of the face, lips, 
gums, tongue and throat, central nervous system (CNS) depression, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) changes  ST depression, T wave inversion or 
flattening, atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles and atrio-ventricular block

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1296520/Adder-bite-leaves-father-blinded-choking-just-minutes-death-walk-family.html
may also occur.  Haematological and biochemical changes include 
leucocytosis (neutrophilia), thrombocytopaenia, anaemia and creatine kinase 
elevation (Karlson-Stiber, 2006; Reid, 1976; Warrell, 2005).  Rapidly 
progressive symptoms and early leucocytosis may serve as a warning signal 
for higher probability of severe reactions (Gronlund, 2003). 
Rare complications include compartment syndrome (Evers et al, 1982) cardiac 
arrest, acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (Aravansis, 
1982), acute gastric dilatation, paralytic ileus and acute pancreatitis (Warrell, 
2005). Disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described in humans 
and animals (Audebert, 1992; personal communication, Cambridge University 
Veterinary School, 2012). Rarely, neurological symptoms are described 
(Malina, 2008). Local envenoming may require skin grafting or even 
amputation of the affected digit (personal communication, Welsh Burns and 
Plastics Unit, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, 2014). 
A similar pattern is seen in envenomed dogs, which occurs considerably more 
frequently than in humans (Personal communications, MicroPharm ViperaVet 
clinical trial data). Mortality in the dog is relatively low (4.6% in the UK [Sutton 
et al, 2012]), with death usually occurring due to fatal arrhythmias (Figure 
1.4-6), disseminated intravascular coagulation or euthanasia (Sutton et al, 
2012; personal communication, Cambridge University Veterinary School, 
2012). 
Figure 1.4-6: ECG trace from a dog bitten by V. berus showing a life-threatening 
arrhythmia (Personal communication). 
Clinical and biochemical changes in dogs bitten by V.berus in Sweden were 
recorded (Lervic et al, 2010).  All dogs had local swelling (Figure 1.4-5C&D) 
73% had affected mental status and 6 of 53 dogs developed cardiac 
abnormalities. Elevated CK levels indicating transient muscle damage was 
observed in 50% of the dogs sampled.  Several dogs had transient, minor 
increases in hepatic test results (Lervic et al, 2010).  Other surveys have 
recorded extensive swelling, refractory hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, 
lymphomegaly, leucocytosis, thrombocytopaenia and coagulopathy (Sutton et 
al, 2012; Segev et al, 2004).  Myocardial damage has been shown to occur in 
both dogs and horses (Segev et al, 2008; Pelander et al, 2010; Anlen, 2008; 
Hoffman et al, 1993). 
1.5 Toxin/pathology relationship 
In this section, published data on venom proteomes and toxin composition is 
examined in the context of pathological lesions observed in envenomed mice 
and humans.  
1.5.1 Echis ocellatus venom 
The proteome of E. ocellatus venom (Wagstaff et al, 2009) is dominated by 
snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMP), and of these, over 50% comprises 
the PIII class. SVMPs are responsible for local tissue and vascular damage by 
means of extracellular matrix and basement membrane destruction, 
respectively (Gutirrez et al, 2009a). Ecarin is a PIII SVMP found in E. 
ocellatus venom, which is prothrombin activating, and therefore plays a key 
role in the consumptive coagulopathy induced by this venom. 
Disintegrins, which may be incorporated as a domain in a PII SVMP, inhibit 
platelet aggregation and thus contribute to the haemorrhagic nature of the 
whole venom. Other haemorrhagic components found in this venom are:  
 Serine proteases, which affect platelet aggregation and catalyse 
fibrinolysis 
 C-Type Lectins bind to Factors IX and X 
 Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) which may also inhibit platelet 
aggregation 
PLA2s may also play a role in local tissue damage, oedema and myonecrosis 
(Gutirrez et al, 2009b). 
The toxin composition and examples of the venom induced lesions is illustrated 
in Figure 1.5-1.

1.5.2 Bitis arietans venom 
The proteome of Bitis arietans venom (Calvete et al, 2007; Fasoli et al, 2010) 
contains fewer SVMPs (33.4% of venom proteins) than E. ocellatus venom, 
and nearly as many serine proteases (25.2%) and C-type lectins (22.1%) as 
SVMPs.  It also contains significant amounts of 5nucleotidase, L-amino 
oxidase and disintegrins. This mix of toxins induces local tissue destruction, 
including oedema and myotoxicity, haemorrhage, thrombocytopaenia and 
profound hypotension. 
The relationship of venom proteins with observed pathological lesions is 
illustrated in Figure 1.5-2. One venom component missing from the proteome 
is the purine (i.e. not a protein), adenosine, which is thought to be partially 
responsible for the profound hypotension associated with envenomation by 
this species of snake (Aird, 2002). The action of 5nucleotidase also contributes 
to the presence of adenosine in the snakebite victim, thus adding to the 
hypotensive effect (Aird, 2002; 2005). 
1.5.3 Vipera berus venom 
The venomics of Vipera berus was compared to that of V. ammodytes 
(Latinovic et al, 2016) and the results used to explain the differences in lesions 
observed following envenoming by the two species. The proteome and 
induced pathological lesions are illustrated in Figure 1.5-3.  
Clinical signs of envenoming by V. berus are mild in comparison to the other 
two Vipers described above. The proteome is dominated by serine proteases 
and SVMPs, which, along with disintegrins, PLA2s, C-type lectins and possibly 
L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO), form a toxic arsenal which disrupt 
haemostasis. Frank haemorrhages are rare, but pulmonary haemorrhage and 
bruising are commonly observed in envenomed patients (Warrell, 2005).  
As a practicing veterinary surgeon, my overwhelming memory of snakebite is 
the almost pathognomic extensive oedema. This observation is supported by 
descriptions in the literature of both human and animal snakebite victims 
(Karlson-Stiber et al, 1994; Anlen, 2008; Lervik et al, 2010; Reid, 1976).  
Local tissue damage and oedema is likely to be induced by snake venom 
metalloproteases, phospholipase A2s, L-amino acid oxidases, and other 
proteases. Hypotension is the most notable systemic sign of envenomation in 
humans, and it is likely that a natriuretic peptide is largely responsible. 
Neurotoxicity is a rare symptom of V. berus envenoming, and tends to be 
confined to certain isolated populations (Malina et al, 2008).  The venom 
studied by Latinovic was not from a neurotoxic population, but genes encoding 
for A and B subunits of Vaspin (a neurotoxic PLA2) were found. This suggests 
that V. berus venom has the potential to contain a neurotoxin, but that this 
gene is rarely expressed. 
1.5.4 Naja nigricollis venom 
Figure 1.5-4 illustrates the relationship between the venom proteome (Petras 
et al, 2011) and observed pathological lesions. 
The venom of Naja nigricollis is rich in cytolytic three finger toxins (3-FTxs) 
(Petras et al, 2011), which is reflected in the severe tissue destruction seen in 
local envenoming. Damage to the cornea when venom is projected into the 
victims eye can be so severe that blindness results. This tissue destructive 
effect is exacerbated by cytotoxic PLA2s.  
N. nigricollis venom also contains PLA2s which have myotoxic, cardiotoxic and 
anticoagulant activities (cited by Petras et al, 2011), as well as 3FTxs which 
are post-synaptic -neurotoxins (0.4% of venom proteins). Experimentally the 
cardiotoxins reproduce the ocular effects resulting from venom spitting 
(Petras et al, 2011). Although the venom contains SVMPs, the relative paucity 
of this toxin in this venom means that its contribution to tissue damage and 
necrosis is likely to be minimal (Petras et al, 2011). Endonucleases are present 
in small amounts, but however in sufficient concentrations to catalyse the 
breakdown of nucleotides into purines, such as adenosine, which may explain 
the hypotension and immobility associated with envenoming (Aird, 2002). The 
biological function of other venom constituents, such as nawaprin, are yet to 
be elucidated (Petras et al, 2011). 
It may be concluded that the toxins in N. nigricollis venom correspond well to 
the observed dominance of cytotoxic and necrotic effects of local envenoming, 
with little evidence of neurotoxicity in man (Petras et al, 2011).  However, in 
the mouse model, evidence of neurotoxicity, such as respiratory and 
progressive paralysis, was observed. 
1.5.5 Dendroaspis angusticeps venom 
Figure 1.5-5 illustrates the proteome of D. angusticeps venom (Lauridsen et 
al, 2016) and resultant observed venom-induced lesions this species of snake. 
In addition to the proteins and peptides, the nucleoside adenosine, was also 
identified (Lauridsen et al, 2016). 
D. angusticeps venom is dominated by 3FTxs and Kunitz-type serine protease 
inhibitors (KUN) (Dendrotoxins). The 3FTxs can be subdivided into a number 
of families, including Fasciculins (unique to D. angusticeps), Orphan group XI, 
and aminergic toxins. The net result of this cocktail of toxins is excitatory 
depolarisation of the neuromuscular junction, with dendrotoxins acting 
presynaptically to enhance acetyl choline release and Fasciculins blocking 
acetyl cholinesterase (Lauridsen et al, 2016). Clinically, this is seen as 
prolonged muscle fasciculations, which was observed in mice to continue after 
death (defined as cardiac arrest).  
Aminergic toxins affect muscarinic receptors and thus clinically induce the 
cardiovascular changes (arrhythmias) and gastrointestinal signs (nausea). 
Acid-sensing ion channel inhibitors (Mambalgesins) block pain sensation 
(Diochet et al, 2012). 
Other venom components are of questionable significance, although the 
presence of SVMPs may be involved in the local inflammation observed at the 
bite site. This assumption is debatable, given that the SVMPs isolated from 
this venom has little activity, experimentally. It is highly likely that some of the 
venom components act synergistically, such as dendrotoxins and fasciculins, 
but may not, in themselves, be toxic (Lauridsen et al, 2016). 
The most significant difference between this arboreal mamba venom and the 
much-feared terrestrial black mamba (D. polylepis) is that D. angusticeps 
venom is completely devoid of -neurotoxins (Lauridsen et al, 2016).  This 
group of toxins act post-synaptically to block neuromuscular transmission 
which results in flaccid paralysis (Mackessy, 2010).  
1.5.6 Toxicovenomics 
Investigation of venoms other than the five which are core to this work and by 
consulting the literature, it became obvious that patterns of envenoming fell 
into syndromes and that these syndromes could be correlated with venom 
toxin composition. Major pathological lesions of envenoming, with the main 
toxin families thought to induce this pathology, are listed below and references

The simple post mortem examination (PM) which has been developed has the 
potential to complement the antivenomics profiling of venom-antivenoms. The 
latter technique may be used to demonstrate which venom components are 
bound by antivenom, but cannot demonstrate neutralisation of bound toxins. 
PM examinations may be used to reveal which pathological lesions are 
neutralised by an antivenom, and, using toxicopathology, venom components 
which have not been neutralised identified. Alternatively, toxicopathology could 
be augmented by detection of unneutralised circulating toxins. 
1.6 Conclusions 
Snake-bite envenoming is one of the worlds neglected tropical diseases, 
causing significant mortality and morbidity as well as having a considerable 
socio-economic impact, particularly in the poverty-stricken rural tropics 
(Harrison et al, 2009).  The only specific and effective treatment is antivenom, 
which must be demonstrated to be safe, effective and affordable to those who 
need it (Brown and Landon, 2010).  Currently, the best single model for efficacy 
testing is the in vivo murine lethality tests, recommended by the WHO 
(Theakston and Reid, 1983, WHO, 2010a).  These assays are expensive, both 
financially and in the use of research animals, as well as causing considerable

distress and suffering to the subjects.  Implementation of the 3Rs in these 
assays is long overdue, so here we seek to redress this problem.  We will 
investigate the use of a matrix of cells from anatomically-distinct origins, 
reflecting the multiplicity of pathological lesions encountered in snake 
envenoming, to replace the in vivo murine assays.  To reduce the numbers of 
animals required results from the present in vitro immunoassays will be 
compared with in vivo results to demonstrate that routine batch testing of 
manufactured antivenoms of proven clinical efficacy may be performed using 
an in vitro assay. Finally, assays will be refined using the MGS score to assess 
pain in envenomed mice and thus the efficacy of analgesia.  Better humane 
endpoints will be defined using behavioural observations, surface body 
temperature and other physiological assessments, leading to a reduction in 
assay duration.

2.1.5 Venoms: 
Venoms were obtained from wild-caught snakes maintained in the Alistair Reid 
Venom Research Unit Herpetarium at the Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine.  The snakes underwent venom extraction approximately every 6 
weeks.  The venom was freeze-dried immediately, pooled and stored at 2-8oC. 
Vipera berus (European Adder) venom was not available from the LSTM 
herpetarium and was obtained from Latoxan (France) from wild-caught 
Russian snakes.  
2.2 In vivo assays pre-clinical assays of venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy 
Experiments were conducted in accordance with World Health 
Organisation guidelines and under licenced approval of the UK Home 
Office. 
The murine lethality assays are the gold standard pre-clinical assays of 
venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy and are recommended by the WHO to 
test every new batch of antivenom produced prior to use in envenomed 
patients, either as part of a clinical trial or therapeutically (WHO, 2010a).  
These assays inflict a great deal of suffering on the large number of mice 
involved and it is the purpose of this project to replace, refine and reduce the 
numbers of mice used in these experiments.  However, it is imperative that the 
efficacy of antivenom is demonstrated prior to their clinical use, so, until a 
suitable robust and practical replacement has been found these assays remain 
obligatory.

The experiment was carried out using five groups of five mice receiving 
different concentrations of venom identified in the range-finding experiment or 
prior experiments using the same venom.  For statistical calculation of a 
venoms LD50 one group requires 100% survival, one group requires 100% 
mortality with the remaining groups demonstrating partial survival.  
Lyophilised venom extracted from the species of choice was reconstituted to a 
stock solution (typically 10mg/mL) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 
stored at -80C.  The different doses of the venom were made up in 1.5mL 
tubes, with an injectable volume of 100l per mouse in PBS, sufficient for 8 
mice per group of 5 mice (to allow for dead-space), before temporary storage 
at 4C. Prior to injection, doses were briefly warmed to room temperature to 
avoid shock to the mouse, and pre-warmed, male CD-1 mice (18-20g) received 
an intravenous (iv) injection via the tail vein  5 mice per dose group.  
Regular observations of the mice were recorded every 30 minutes for the first 
4 hours and every hour thereafter. Evidence of extreme distress and severe 
envenoming, or a significant decrease in the animals response or health 
resulted in implementation of humane endpoints and euthanasia by rising 
concentrations of carbon dioxide.  Euthanasia was carried out to reduce 
suffering to the test animals without compromising the validity of the results. 
After 7 or 24 hours the numbers of surviving mice in each group were recorded.  
Table 2.2-1 shows the summary table of experiment MV178, an LD50 of Bitis 
arietans venom. 
Numbers of mice were kept to a minimum by careful selection of dose groups, 
then waiting until the likely outcome became obvious, then selecting the next 
dose group accordingly.

The LD50 (the amount of venom that kills 50% of the injected mice) and 90% 
confidence limits were calculated using Probit analysis (Finney, 1971) of 
surviving mice.  Figure 2.2-1 shows the output from the Probit analysis 
obtained using Stats Direct programme.

2.2.2 Median effective dose: ED50 
The experiments were carried out with appropriate doses of antivenom that 
neutralised two to five LD50 of venom (determined in the LD50 experiment). The 
experiment is carried out with varying doses of antivenom (typically 5 different 
doses identified by range-finding experiments or previous experiments using 
the same antivenom), which are pre-incubated with venom for 30 minutes at 
37C, and then intravenously injected into the tail vein of 5 mice per dose.  For 
statistical calculation of an antivenoms ED50 one group requires 100% 
survival, one group requires 100% mortality with the remaining groups 
demonstrating partial survival.   
Lyophilised venom extracted from the species of choice was reconstituted to a 
stock solution (typically 10g/L) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the 
stock solution stored at -80C.  The stock solution of venom was the same as 
that which was used in the LD50 experiment. 
For the experiment, 2-5 times the LD50 dose of the venom was made up in 2mL 
tubes, and mixed with various doses of antivenom.  The different doses were 
made up to a volume of 200l per mouse with PBS, sufficient for 8 mice for 
each 5 mouse group (to allow for dead space), before incubation for 30 minutes 
at 37C and then temporary storage at 4C. Prior to injection, doses were 
briefly warmed to room temperature, before five, pre-warmed male CD-1 mice 
(18-20g) received an intravenous (i.v.) injection via the tail vein for each dose. 
The experiment was then carried out as per LD50. 
2.2.3 Analgesia 
On day Minus One mice were marked for individual identification and baseline 
observations performed  weight, behaviour, activity and facial grimace score 
(MGS). 
On day One activity and MGS were recorded for each mouse.  The mice were 
given appropriate analgesia or placebo treatment approximately 30 minutes 
prior to venom or venom/antivenom injection.  Activity, behavioural 
observations and facial grimace were recorded every 30 minutes, where 
possible, following intravenous venom injection (as described for LD50 and 
ED50 experiments), until termination of the experiment.  Post mortem 
examinations were performed on all mice, and, where appropriate, samples 
taken for histopathology (see Chapter 2A for details). 
2.3 Binding Assays 
Binding assays demonstrate the ability of antibodies to bind to antigens but do 
not predict whether this binding results in neutralisation of antigen activity.  
However, if there is little or no binding this is an indication that there will be 
minimal neutralisation of antigen activity.  The assays consist of antigen bound 
to a solid phase, addition of antibody then visualisation or measurement of the 
amount of bound antibody. I used SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, 
end-point enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Avidity ELISA and 
small scale affinity chromatography.  
2.3.1 SDS-PAGE 
SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis is a method of separating proteins according 
to their molecular weight.  Highly folded proteins run through the gel more 
slowly than their MW would dictate due to electrostatic forces.  Samples may 
be reduced by cleaving the disulphide bonds responsible for its folded structure 
by heating with -mercaptoethanol.  If proteins are being separated prior to 
immunoblotting changing its folding could affect the configuration of the 
antibody binding site and therefore it may be preferable to run them in their 
native state.  
Method: 
Gels were made up using the recipes shown in tables 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.  
Two sets of 2.5mm gel plates and cover plates were cleaned and dried using 
washing up liquid followed by 60% ethanol. This process is important to 
prevent the gels from sticking to the glass once the samples have been run. 
The plates were assembled, a 15% resolving gel (Table 2.3-1) was poured 
between the plates and allowed to polymerise.

Stacking gel (Table 2.3-2) was then poured on top of the resolving gel, the 
relevant combs placed into the top, taking great care not to introduce any air 
bubbles, and left to polymerise. Venom samples at a concentration of 1g/L in 
PLOB  a carrier buffer containing Tris base, SDS, glycerol and bromophenol 
blue, to allow visualisation of the sample (see Appendix 2, Buffers) were 
prepared. If reduced samples were being run, the PLOB contained 15% -
mercaptoethanol.  In this instance, the samples were heated at 100oC for 10 
minutes to denature the proteins.  For non-reduced samples, the PLOB used 
did not contain -mercaptoethanol. The glass plates containing the 
polymerised gels were placed in an electrophoresis tank and 5L Promega 
broad range protein marker added to a small well.  If a 15 well comb was used, 
10L venom sample/ well was added, if a 1 well comb was used, 110L venom 
sample was added to the well. The tank was filled with electrophoresis running 
buffer and the gels run at 200V until the samples had reached the bottom of 
the gel (around 1 hour).  The gels were then either left to stain overnight in 
Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Gels 
which were stained overnight were destained until the bands were visible and 
the surrounding gel colourless. 
2.3.2 Western Blot 
Western blotting is a method of immunoblotting in which the SDS-PAGE 
separated venom proteins are blotted onto a membrane (the solid phase) and 
the membrane then probed with antibodies to determine which proteins are 
bound and, more importantly, those which are not.  The bound antibodies are 
visualised with an appropriate enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody which 
results in a colour change on addition of its substrate.  The major drawback of 
this method is that there is considerable cross-reactivity with heterologous 
antibodies.  
Method: 
SDS-PAGE gels were run, as described above, using a 1 well comb. A 
nitrocellulose membrane was placed on the gel and sandwiched between filter 
paper and foam, carefully rolling out any air-bubbles.  This was placed in an 
electrophoresis tank containing immunotransfer buffer (Appendix 2), taking 
precautions to prevent overheating by using an icepack and magnetic stirrer, 
and run at 100V for one hour. The protein bands on the membrane were 
visualised temporarily using Ponceau S stain. The membranes were cut and 
marked according to the experiment, washed with water to remove the stain, 
and the protein marker bands marked with a ball-point pen, cut off and set 
aside. 
The membranes were blocked with blocking solution (BS) - 5% milk powder in 
TBST (Appendix 2) - overnight at 4oC.  The following morning, the membranes 
were washed for an hour with at least 3 changes of TBST. Primary antibody 
was made up in BS and added to the membrane for 3 hours, after which the 
membranes were again washed as before.  The bound antibody was probed 
using the relevant secondary antibody in BS for 1 hour.  After washing, the 
bands were visualised by adding substrate (Diaminobenzamine solution 
containing hydrogen peroxide).  After a final wash to stop the reaction, the 
membranes were dried, photographed or scanned and preserved using a 
laminator.  Visualised bands were compared to the separated homologous 
venom proteins on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. 
2.3.3 Endpoint ELISA 
The ELISA is a binding assay in which the solid phase is bound to the wells of 
(usually) a 96-well plate.  This enables more than one sample to be run on a 
plate.  This technique can be automated and therefore is suitable for large-
scale screening of samples.  The disadvantage of the technique is that due to 
the multiple steps involved any error is potentially multiplied, giving the assay 
a high coefficient of variation. 
Method: 
A 96 well microtitre plate was coated with 100L/well of a 2mg/L venom 
solution in 100mmol bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (0.2g venom/well).The plate 
was covered and incubated for 2 hours at 37oC, then overnight at 4oC.The 
following day the plates were washed 3-5 times with TBST. The plates were 
blocked with 150L/well BS, incubated for 30 minutes at 37oC and then 
emptied and washed twice with TBST. Plates not used immediately were 
stored at -20oC and defrosted when required. Doubling dilutions of sample 
(antiserum, antivenom or PIS (pre-immune serum)) in TBST were prepared 
from a suitable starting dilution (usually 1:1000), each well containing 100L 
of diluted sample. The plate was covered and incubated at 37oC for 1 hour, 
then washed as above with TBST. The appropriate secondary antibody for the 
sample used was diluted in TBST and 100L/well added to the plate, which 
was covered and incubated at 37oC for 1 hour, then washed as above with 
TBST. One10mg tablet of ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulphonic acid)) was dissolved in 50mL ELISA citrate buffer, pH 5.0 and 50L 
hydrogen peroxide added just prior to use. One hundred L of this was added 
to each well and the plate left at room temperature until a green colour had 
developed (5-10 minutes) then the reaction was stopped with 100L/well 1% 
SDS solution. The absorbance was read at 405 nm using an Optimax or 
Omega Polestar microtitre plate reader. The titre at 50% of maximum binding 
was calculated: {[(Amax  Amin)/2] + Amin} and the corresponding dilution read 
from the graph (EC50).  The end-point titre was calculated by reading the 
dilution at which the absorbance was the mean of the PIS control absorbances 
plus 2 x standard deviations. 
2.3.4 Avidity ELISA 
The avidity ELISA is a variation of the standard ELISA which measures the 
strength of antigen-antibody binding (avidity) by adding different 
concentrations of chaotrophic agent and determining the concentration which 
reduces antigen-antibody binding by 50% (M50). 
Method: 
The plates were coated with venom and blocked as described above. A 1:1000 
dilution of antivenom in BS (100L/well) was added to the wells of Rows 2-9 
and BS only to Row 10.  The plates were covered and incubated for 1 hour at 
37oC then emptied and washed 5x with TBST. Dilutions of ammonium 
thiocyanate (NH4SCN) in water (WFI) were prepared as shown in Table 2.3-3, 
starting with an 8M solution (6.1g/10mL). 
Table 2.3-3: Preparation of ammonium thiocyanate

3M 750 1250 
2M 500 1500 
1M 250 1750 
0M 0 2000 
Each concentration of NH4SCN (100L/well)  was added to rows 2-10 of the 
plate (duplicate water-only rows  Rows 9 and 10), covered and incubated for 
15 minutes at 37oC.  Plates were then emptied and washed 5x with TBST. The 
assay was completed as for the end-point ELISA from the addition of 
secondary antibody. The concentration of ammonium thiocyanate which 
caused a 50% reduction in absorbance was calculated. 
2.3.5 Small scale affinity chromatography (SSAC) 
Affinity chromatography uses a gel such as sepharose to which is covalently 
attached the appropriate venom as the solid phase.  The antibodies are mixed 
and incubated with the gel in a column following which any unbound antibodies 
are washed off.  Bound antibodies are then eluted, in this case by reducing the 
pH, the eluate collected and protein concentration measured.  The gel in the 
column is re-equilibrated and can be used multiple times.  The main 
advantages of this method are that a measurement of specific antibody 
concentration can be made and expressed as a percentage of initial sample 
protein concentration and the column can be re-used 40 times or more.  The 
main disadvantage is that there is some non-specific binding to the gel. 
This technique can be reversed by coupling antibodies to the gel and collecting 
the unbound and bound fractions of venom, and by analysing its components 
identifying which toxic components are bound and which are not. This 
technique is called Antivenomics (Calvete et al, 2009). 
2.3.5.1 Column coupling  
A 1mg/mL solution of venom in coupling buffer was made, allowing 5mg 
venom/1g CNBr-activated sepharose 4 fast flow gel.  An extra 1.5mL venom 
solution was made up for protein measurement by measuring optical density 
(OD) at 280nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1. A suspension containing 
1g sepharose gel in 10mL swelling solution was prepared, covered with 
parafilm and left to stand for 30 minutes.  It was then washed with a further 
35mL swelling solution. Washing with coupling buffer activated the gel, which 
was packed into a 10mL glass chromatography column and 5mg of venom/g 
gel in coupling buffer added.  The column was mixed for 4 hours at room 
temperature on an end-over-end mixer, then incubated overnight at 4oC before 
mixing for a further hour at room temperature.  The venom solution was drained 
off and retained for OD measurement at 280nm.  The percentage coupling was 
calculated ({1-(OD post/OD pre)} x 100). 1M ethanolamine was next added to 
the column and mixed for a further 2 hours.  This step blocked any unbound 
sites on the activated gel.  The column was then washed with a further 5mL of 
coupling buffer, followed alternately by 15mL each of sodium acetate buffered 
saline, pH4.0 and coupling buffer, pH 8.3 for 3 cycles.  The coupled gel was 
re-suspended in 3.5mL PBW before performing a blank run using 10 column 
volumes (35mL) PBW followed by glycine elution (20mL) and a final wash with 
PBW containing 1% sodium azide as a preservative during storage.  The 
column was stored at 4oC until required. 
2.3.5.2 SSAC 
The appropriate sepharose venom-coupled column was placed in a vertical 
position and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.  The column was 
washed with at least 10 column volumes (CV) of PBW without sodium azide 
(35mL for standard columns). A known volume (S) of antibody-containing 
sample was added to the column (usually 1mL).  Antiserum samples were 
filtered through a 0.2m syringe filter prior to addition.  The column was capped 
and placed on an end-over-end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature.  The 
column was then replaced in a vertical position and washed with a further 10x 
CV of PBW.  Bound venom-specific antibodies were then eluted using glycine 
HCl buffer at pH2.5 and the volume collected recorded (V)  this was usually 
20mL.  The column was equilibrated with a further 10x CV PBW, containing 
azide if the column was destined to be stored until further use.  The OD at 
280nm of the eluate was measured and the specific antibody concentration 
(SAbC) calculated, using an appropriate extinction coefficient for the donor 
species immunoglobulin or fragment in the sample (E). 
Formula: SAbC = 
OD x V
E x S
2.4 Cytotoxicity Assays 
Venoms contain many toxic components and can target different cell types and 
therefore exhibit a multiplicity of pathological lesions.  For this reason it was 
decided to investigate whether, by selecting a number of different cell lines to 
represent the major target organs of venom toxins to form a matrix of cells, the 
lethality of venom in mice (and other victims of snakebite) could be predicted. 
If so, whether the efficacy of antivenom in neutralising these lethal effects could 
likewise be predicted, thus potentially replacing the in vivo pre-clinical assays. 
The objectives included developing an assay which was robust, simple to 
perform and affordable.  Initially two cell lines were chosen  VERO cells 
(green monkey kidney) which are epithelial in origin and SH SY5Y cells 
(derived from a human neuroblastoma).  Viperid venoms are generally 
cytotoxic and haemotoxic and therefore likely to be cytotoxic to the epithelial 
cells.  VERO cells are adherent, easy to grow and do not have any special 
requirements for growth. 
Neurotoxic elapid venoms act on the cholinergic neuromuscular junctions 
(NMJs).  Primary cell cultures creating a NMJ are available, but require 
considerable expertise and time to produce and are not available as an 
established immortalised cell line. The SH SY5Y cells were donated but 
subsequently obtained from the European collection of authenticated cell 
cultures (ECACC)  they are adherent dopaminergic cells with some 
cholinergic properties. They are much slower to grow than the VERO cells and 
show differentiation into neuronal cells after around 3 days, with formation of 
dendritic processes. 
2.4.1 Cell culture methods 
2.4.1.1 Cell growth, passage and harvest. 
Cells were added to approximately 30mL of suitable culture medium to support 
growth of the cells to be used in a T75 culture flask.  The flask was placed in 
an incubator at 37oC, 5% CO2 and in a humidified atmosphere and the cells 
grown until 80-100% confluent.  To harvest the cells, they were first washed 
twice with 10mL PBSa then with 1mL Trypsin EDTA.  Approximately 2mL 
Trypsin EDTA was added to the flask which was returned to the incubator until 
the cells had detached (approximately 10 minutes).  The cells were washed off 
the bottom of the flask with culture medium containing 10% foetal calf serum 
and the resulting suspension harvested into a fresh tube.  An aliquot of 100L 
was diluted 1:10 in Trypan blue (a dye excluded by live cells) and a cell count 
performed using an Improved Neubauer haemocytometer as follows: Stained 
cells were pipetted under the coverslip of the haemocytometer and the number 
of cells counted in the four large corner squares of the grid.  The concentration 
of cells was calculated using the following formula:  Cell count = (N x D)/V 
cells/mL, where N is the mean number of cells/ square counted, D the dilution 
factor (10) and V the volume of the shoulder square (10-4 mL). The cells were 
diluted in medium to the appropriate seeding density required for the 
experiment, or the appropriate volume added to a fresh culture flask for later 
2.4.1.2 Freezing cells for storage in liquid nitrogen 
Cells were harvested as described above.  The resulting suspension was 
centrifuged (237 RCF for 5 minutes).  The supernatant was discarded, and the 
pellet re-suspended in 1:1 DMSO: Medium to produce a suspension containing 
5 x 106 cells/mL.  One mL of this suspension was added to each cryovial.  The 
vials were put into an insulated box in the -80oC freezer, allowing slow freezing 
of the cells.  After 24 hours they were transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage 
tank.  When required a vial of cells was retrieved from storage and rapidly 
thawed in a waterbath at 37 oC before adding to a flask containing pre-warmed 
medium. 
2.4.1.3 Neutral red assay 
Neutral red is a dye which is taken up by viable cells into the lysosomes.  This 
assay was chosen because it is simple to perform and relatively inexpensive. 
A solution containing 20% 0.33g/L neutral red solution was made up in PBSa 
and 50L/well added to the test cell culture plate.  After 2 hours incubation, the 
supernatant was discarded and the plate washed twice with PBSa.  De-stain 
solution, containing 50% ethanol and 1% acetic acid, was added to the plate 
(150L/well) and the plate put on a plate shaker for 10 minutes prior to reading 
absorbance in an Optimax or Omega Polestar plate reader at 540nm and 690 
nm.  The banking absorbance at 690nm was subtracted from that at 540nm 
and the percentage of mean control cell growth calculated. 
2.4.2 Cytotoxicity 
A suspension containing 0.75 x 105 VERO cells/mL was prepared from a T75 
tissue flask containing VERO cells in log growth phase and 100L/ well used 
to seed rows B  H of 96 well tissue culture plates (row A contained medium 
only). The plates were placed in the incubator at 37oC, 5% CO2 with a 
humidified atmosphere for 20 - 24 hours. Venom dilutions containing 50 to 
5000 ng in 100L DMEM/10/HEPES were prepared and added in triplicate to 
the appropriate well of the pre-incubated cells. DMEM/10 only was added to 
the outer wells and the penultimate column as a negative control. After 4 hours 
incubation a neutral red assay was performed as previously described. The 
mean absorbance of Row A was subtracted from those of the test wells. 
Percentage of control cell growth for each test well was calculated and the 
mean for each venom dose plotted against venom dose. Confidence intervals 
of 95% were calculated and added to the curve. The venom dose which 
corresponded to 50% cell death was read from the graph (LC50). 
2.4.3 Cytotoxicity Neutralisation 
A suspension containing 0.75 x 105 VERO cells/mL was prepared from a T75 
tissue flask containing VERO cells in log growth phase and 100L/ well used 
to seed rows B  H of 96 well tissue culture plates (row A contained medium 
only). The plates were placed in the incubator at 37oC, 5% CO2 with a 
humidified atmosphere for 20 - 24 hours. Antivenom were dialysed into 0.9% 
sodium chloride, to remove any preservative, and diluted to a concentration of 
25g/L prior to preparing dilutions in medium containing 10% HEPES buffer and 
filtered using a 0.2 m syringe filter. 
A volume of 200L/well DMEM/10/HEPES was placed into the outer wells of 
96 well dilution plates and 100L/well into wells B-F, 3-11 and G2-11. A further 
100L/well was added to wells G8-11 (medium control).  A volume of 
200L/well diluted antivenom (in triplicate), antiserum or PIS was added to 
wells B2-F2 and 100L transferred from well to well across the plate to create 
doubling dilutions. The final 100L was discarded from wells B11-F11.  A 
volume of 100L/well diluted antivenom was added to wells G2-4 (antivenom 
control). Venom dilutions containing 2x to 5x LC50/well in 50L were prepared 
in DMEM/HEPES from defrosted 10g/L stock solutions and filtered through a 
0.2 m syringe filter.  A volume of 100L/well was transferred to the 
corresponding well of the dilution plate.  [(Rows B-F, columns 2-11, and G5-7 
(venom control)].

The venom/antivenom solutions were incubated for 30 minutes at 37oC. A 
volume of 100L was transferred from each well of the dilution plate to the 
corresponding well of the pre-cultured VERO cells and this plate returned to 
the incubator for 4 hours before performing a neutral red assay for viable cells, 
as previously described.  Absorbance was read at 540nm and 690nm and the 
corrected absorbance and EC50 absorbance calculated (see formulae below).  
Where A540 = absorbance @ 540nm; A690 = absorbance @ 690nm: 
Absorbance = (A540  A690)  Mean absorbance Row A (A540  A690)   
Percentage control cell growth was calculated for each well as described for 
the cytotoxicity assay, and plotted against antivenom dilution. The dilution 
which corresponded to 50% control cell growth was read from the graph 
(EC50). 
2.4.1 Real Time Cell Assays: xCELLigence 
Cytotoxicity and neutralisation assays were performed using the xCELLigence 
system to examine the real time growth of cells.  Sixteen-well e-plates were 
used, which could be run as single, double or triple-plate assays in the three 
available xCELLigence cradles.  The plates have a central strip devoid of 
electrodes which allows visualisation of growing cells.  The system was used 
for optimisation of assays and not for data collection so duplicate samples were 
often not used. 
The plates were seeded with cells and then allowed to stand for 30 minutes at 
room temperature to allow the cells to settle prior to insertion of the plate(s) 
into the xCELLigence cradle(s).  Cell index (CI)  a measure of electrical 
resistance across the bottom of each well - was recorded every 15 minutes 
until test compound(s) were added. At this time the CI was normalised to a 
value of 1.0 to allow for variation in cell growth of each well. Immediately after 
addition of the test substance(s) CI was recorded every 5 minutes for 1 hour, 
then every 15 minutes thereafter  in some cases, for more than 72 hours.  CI 
reflects the proportion of the bottom of the well covered by cells, but does not 
differentiate between increased numbers and increased size of cells. The real-
time cell assay (RTCA) software was used to calculate slope (rate of change), 
LC/EC50 over the study period and LC/EC50 at given time points, which include 
the R2 value. 
2.5 IgG Purification 
Antiserum was thawed in the fridge for 72 hours prior to dilution 1:3 with 0.9% 
saline. Caprylic acid was added to a concentration of 6% volume/volume of the 
undiluted serum and mixed thoroughly for 30 minutes, then allowed to stand 
for 1 hour at room temperature before centrifugation at 4733 RCF for 60 
minutes.  The suspension was removed and filtered through a GF pre-filter 
followed by a 0.45m filter and the precipitate discarded. The resulting solution 
was concentrated and reformulated into sodium citrate buffered saline (SCS), 
pH 6.0 using a BioRad mini diafiltration system and 3x filters with a 30kDa cut-
off.  Protein concentration was measured by OD and adjusted to 25g/L with 
2.6 Other 
2.6.1 Protein concentration by optical density (OD) 
An appropriate dilution of sample (D), containing less than 1g/L protein was 
prepared.  A spectrophotometer with a UV lamp was set to 280nm wavelength 
for immunoglobulin samples and also to 260nm wavelength if protein 
composition was unknown.  Approximately 1mL of sample buffer was added 
to a quartz cuvette, with a 1cm path length and used as a blank reading.  The 
sample was mixed thoroughly and the optical density (OD) measured.  Protein 
concentration (C) was calculated using the formula:  
OD x D
 g/L, where E is the extinction coefficient  
If the protein composition was unknown, the following formula was used: 
C = (OD280 x 1.55)  (OD260 x 0.76) 
2.6.2 FPLC/SEC 
Fast phase liquid chromatography (FPLC), also known as size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC), was used to measure the purity of antibody samples 
and to assess digestion of IgG into its fragments.  An AKTA Purifier 10/10XT 
system was used with a superose 12 HR column and a 100L loop.  The 
running buffer was sodium citrate buffered saline (SCS). Samples were diluted 
1:10 in SCS and 1mL loaded into the system.  The trace was retrieved after 75 
minutes and the area of each peak as a percentage of total peak area recorded 
(Figure 2.6-1).

IgG (with some IgM) and purified Fab fragments. 
Chapter 2A: Refinement Methods 
This chapter will cover the methods used to assess pain and suffering in the mice 
used in the in vivo refinement assays to determine the efficacy of analgesia and to 
establish humane end-points (HEPs).  It also covers a novel method of scoring 
post mortem lesions, adjusted for survival time as a means of reducing the 
numbers of mice required to compare antivenom efficacy. 
2.7 Behavioural observations 
Observations were recorded at regular intervals, using Table 2.7-1 shown below, 
in the form of number/survivors or individual mouse identity, where n was the 
number of mice showing the behaviour and s the number of surviving mice in the 
group. Observations were made after the lid of the cage was removed  if the mice 
were sleeping this roused them and stimulated exploratory behaviour.  A list of 
definitions for observed behaviours is listed below: 
Depression: Mouse failed to exhibit normal exploratory behaviour when disturbed. 
Slumping: Mouse lying flat with neck extended (Figure 2.7-1). 
Hunching: Mouse sitting with back arched in hunched position, with head down. 
(Figure 2.7-2). 
Figure 2.7-1: slumping        Figure 2.7-2: Hunching with 
staring coat 
Figure 2.7-3: Dyspnoea 
Staring coat: Fur looks dull and hairs erect (Figure 2.7-2). 
Tachypnoea: Rapid, usually shallow, breathing. 
Dyspnoea: Increased respiratory effort (Figure 2.7-3). 
Paradoxical respiration: An extreme form of dyspnoea where during inspiration the 
abdominal wall is sucked in and during expiration it bulges out. 
Respiratory distress: Mouse propped up in an attempt to breathe, signs of cyanotic 
(blue) extremities. 
Haemorrhage: Epistaxis (blood from nose) and/or haemoptysis (blood from 
mouth). 
Blue tail: Bruising on the tail around the injection site. 
Mobility: Mouse active and moving around cage.  Hyperactivity often precedes 
leaping or convulsions. 
Twitching: Twitching of limb(s) or body  often progresses to convulsions. 
Leaping: Mouse leaps in the air  repetition of this behaviour is an indication of 
impending death so mouse euthanased. 
Convulsions: Self-explanatory.  Mouse euthanased 
Paralysis: Paralysis of one or more limbs.  A neurological examination (see section 
2.8) was carried out on mice showing mild paralysis.  If generalised or progressive, 
mouse euthanased. 
Lost righting reflex: Mouse unable to right itself when turned on its back (see 
section 2.8). Mouse euthanased.  
Moribund:  Mouse unreactive, but still breathing, -euthanased.  
Schedule I: Mouse euthanased. 
Death:  Mouse found dead.

A note was also made of presence or absence of normal behaviours, such as

2.8 Neurological observations 
It was noted that envenomed mice often started showing neurological signs such 
as twitching, leaping or convulsions prior to death, even with non-neurotoxic 
Viperid venoms. The aim was to see if death in these mice could be predicted prior 
to being in extremis. 
A simple neurological examination was developed based on a more extensive 
examination used to assess the neurological function of cats and dogs in veterinary 
practice.  The mice used to develop the examination were regularly handled pet 
mice, which were not unduly stressed by these tests. 
2.8.1 Visual placing test:   
The mouse is suspended by the base of its tail and brought towards the edge of a 
surface (Figure 2.8-1).  Its ability to reach forward first with its forelimbs, then its 
hindlimbs shows that its visual cortex, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal reflexes 
are all intact. 
Figure 2.8-1: Visual placing  mouse held 
by tail and brought towards a surface. 
Normally reaches for surface 
2.8.2 Ear tickle   
The ear is touched gently  the mouse moves its ear away from the stimulus 
(Figure 2.8-2).  This involves cranial nerves V (sensory) and VII (motor). 
Figure 2.8-2: Ear tickle  ear twitches in 
response to light touch 
2.8.3 Tail curl  
When a finger is placed under the mouses tail, it will normally wrap around the 
finger (Figure 2.8-3).  This involves both sensory and motor pathways.  Loss of this 
reflex may be an early sign of ascending paralysis. 
Figure 2.8-3: Tail curl  tail curls around 
finger 
2.8.4 Righting reflex   
One of the most distressing positions for a mouse, as shown by ultrasound 
recordings of distress calls at frequencies inaudible to the human ear, is to be held 
upside down [personal communication, Miller, Newcastle University, August 2012].  
A normal mouse vigorously resists being turned over (Figure 2.8-4) and this reflex 
is one of the last to be lost. If poor it is a robust humane end point. 
Figure 2.8-4: Righting reflex  mouse 
resists being turned upside-down 
2.8.5 Corneal reflex:  
The edge of the cornea is touched (Figure 2.8-5).  If this reflex is intact, the mouse 
will blink it is the final reflex to be lost and thus any live mouse without this reflex 
should be euthanased.

when eyelids or cornea is touched 
2.9 Physiological observations 
Physiological parameters can be affected by many emotions  fear, pain, increased 
activity and pleasurable anticipation such as food, to name but a few (Flecknell, 
1999). The aim here was to investigate whether there was any relationship 
between objective measurement of temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate, oxygen 
saturation and pulse distension with the subjective facial grimace scale and activity 
scores, behavioural and neurological observations.   
2.9.1 Surface Temperature measurement 
Temperature can be measured 
in a number of ways, including 
via implanted chips, rectal 
probes and infrared (IR) 
thermometer. Implanted chips 
were too expensive for the 
number of mice used, rectal 
probes require mice to be 
anaesthetised and are therefore 
unsuitable for this project.  
Figure 2.9-1: Surface temperature measurement 
An IR thermometer was obtained and surface temperature measurements made 
by pointing the beam at the concavity immediately behind the mouses skull. For a 
valid reading, the mouse must have all 4 feet on the ground and a consistent height 
was obtained by holding the beam source level with the edge of the cage.  Using 
this technique repeatable readings were obtained, both by the same and different 
operators. The technique is illustrated in Figure 2.9-1. 
2.9.2 MouseOx System 
To measure other physiological parameters a collar allowing conscious monitoring, 
in conjunction with the relevant software, was obtained (MouseOxPlus, Starr Life 
Sciences). Briefly, a collar attached via a wire to a recording device was applied to 
the neck of one mouse from each group of 5 (MouseOx, Harvard Apparatus) and 
data recorded (Figure 2.9-2) for 5 minutes prior to intervention, and  for 5 minutes 
every 30 minutes thereafter, using conscious monitoring software. Parameters 
measured were: error, oxygen saturation (%), pulse rate (beats per minute), 
respiration rate (breaths per minute), pulse distension (mmHg) and the presence 
(1) or absence of activity (0). When Error was 0  all parameters were being 
detected; the greater the error value, the fewer the parameters were being 
detected.  Activity of the mouse reduces the ability of the collar to pick up oxygen 
saturation, breath rate, pulse distension and finally pulse rate.  The traces were 
analysed by calculating the mean of 8 values measured on the trace.  Where 
possible, readings were taken when the error and activity values were 0.

Trace obtained for analysis. 
Understanding the Limitations of MouseOx Plus in Conscious Unrestrained 
Applications  
The MouseOx Plus can measure vital signs in mice, rats and other small 
laboratory animals that are conscious and unrestrained.  However, there are some 
limitations to its use.  Oxygen saturation cannot be measured while the animal is 
moving because the nature of pulse oximetry which allows calculations of oxygen 
saturation to be obtained from absorption of light measurements requires that the 
distance between the sensor pads does not change.  When the animal moves, or 
even flexes muscles under the skin without obvious surface movement of the 
sensor pads, this assumption is violated preventing the measurement of oxygen 
saturation.  Thus, an animal that is conscious and unrestrained must also be still 
while the saturation measurement is being made.   Measurement of pulse rate can 
be maintained during moderate movement. 
2.10  Pain Assessment 
2.10.1 Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) Score 
A system of facial expressions described by Mogil (2010) in the MGS Manual was 
used as a scoring system for pain in the mouse undergoing the lethality assays for 
preclinical testing of venoms and antivenoms. Mice were placed into a Perspex 
box with two sides at 90o blacked out.  After a short period of acclimatisation 
photographs were taken in rapid succession on the cameras best shot setting.  
The photograph which best demonstrated the facial features was selected, 
cropped and adjusted for optimum intensity, colour and brightness using Picasa 3 
software.  The photographs were then scored as described below (MGS manual  
J. Mogil). 
Coding procedures:   
All faces were coded for the presence and intensity of the following specific facial 
Action Units (AU), relative to the status of the region of the baseline prototype.     
A. Intensity ratings:   
Intensity ratings were coded for each AU.    
AU was not present = 0; AU moderately visible = 1; AU severe = 2   
An MGS score for each photograph was calculated by averaging intensity ratings 
for each AU.  An MGS difference score (relative to baseline/no pain) was then 
calculated for each subject, and averaged across a group.  These calculations are 
described in detail at the end of this section.    
B. Action units:   
1. Orbital Tightening  
Mouse must display a narrowing of the orbital area, a tightly closed eyelid, or an 
eye squeeze.  An eye squeeze is defined as the orbital muscles around the eyes 
being contracted.  A wrinkle may be visible around the eye.  As a guideline, any 
eye closure that reduces the eye size by more than half should be coded as a 2. 
Note that sleeping mice display closed eyes, and this may be mistaken for a tightly 
closed eyelid.  Photographs of sleeping mice should therefore not be taken and/or 
coded.   
Figure 2.10-1: Images illustrating the scoring of orbital tightening 
2. Nose Bulge  
Mouse must display a bulge on top of the nose.  The skin and muscles around the 
nose will be contracted creating a rounded extension of skin visible on the bridge 
of the nose.  A nose bulge may also be coded if a coder sees vertical wrinkles 
extending down the side of the nose from the bridge.  In frontal headshots, a bulge 
may be seen as a widening of the nose area (i.e., V-shape connecting eyes to nose 
appears broader). *Note that a nose bulge may also appear when mice are actively 
exploring (i.e., sniffing).  Ideally, these photographs should not be taken and/or 
coded, as they may inflate baseline MGS scores.   
Figure 2.10-2: Images illustrating the scoring of nose bulge 
3. Cheek Bulge  
The cheek muscle is contracted and extended relative to the baseline condition; it 
will appear to be convex from its neutral position.  Note; the cheek is considered to 
be the area directly below the eye and extending to the beginning of the whiskers 
on the nose (in humans, the infraorbital triangle).  The distance from eye to whisker 
pad may appear shortened relative to baseline.   
Figure 2.10-3: Images illustrating the scoring of cheek bulge 
4. Ear Position  
Ears may be pulled back from their baseline position, or may be seen as laid flat 
against the head.  In a typical baseline position ears are roughly perpendicular to 
the head and are directed forward.  In pain, the ears tend to rotate outwards and/or 
back, away from the face. As a result, the space between the ears may appear 
wider relative to baseline. Note that mice engaged in exploration or grooming may 
also pull ears back, but distance between ears tends to narrow rather than widen.  
In any case, these may cause confusion, and it is advised that photographs of mice 
actively exploring or grooming not be taken and/or coded.    
Figure 2.10-4: Images illustrating the scoring of ear position 
5. Whisker Change  
Whiskers must have moved from the baseline position.  They could either be pulled 
back to lay flat against the cheek or pulled forward as if to be standing on end.  
Whiskers may also clump together compared to baseline whiskers, which tend to 
be fairly evenly spaced.   
Figure 2.10-5: Images illustrating the scoring of whisker change 
iii. Calculating MGS scores:   
1. All AUs for each photograph were averaged to give the MGS score.  Most 
of these preliminary calculations were carried out using Excel (see example 
below):   
 A B C D E F G 
1 Photo ID# Orbital Nose Cheek Ears Whiskers MGS 
2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1.4 
3 2 0 0 1 0 1 0.4 
4 3 1 2 2 2 1 =AVERAGE(B4:F4) 
2. After unblinding, data was sorted by subject (e.g., Mouse) then by 
condition.  Note that no pain photographs were almost always baseline 
photographs taken prior to noxious stimulation:   
 A B C D E F G H I 
1 Photo ID# Mouse Condition Orbital Nose Cheek Ears Whiskers MGS 
2 27 A1 no pain 0 0 1 0 1 0.4 
3 58 A1 No pain 0 0 0 0 0 0 
4 1 A1 Pain 2 1 1 2 1 1.4 
5 206 A1 Pain 1 2 2 2 1 1.6 
3. Mean MGS score for all no pain and all pain photographs was calculated 
for each subject and the mean for the no pain photographs subtracted from 
the mean for the pain photographs to give an MGS difference score for 
each subject:   
 A B C D 
1 Mouse MGS_no pain MGS_pain MGS_diff 
2 A1 0.2 1.5 1.3 
3 A2 0.4 1 0.6 
4 A3 =AVERAGE(no pain) =AVERAGE(pain) =MGS_pain-MGS-no pain    
4. Difference scores were then averaged across subjects to give a mean 
difference score, which were analyzed for significance using a one-sample 
Students t -test compared to 0.

2.10.2 Activity score 
It became apparent that mice experiencing pain were less active, and as they 
recovered from envenomation, they became more active.  To perform an activity 
score, the lid, food, bedding and nest box were removed from the cage.  Using the 
video setting on a camera, a recording was made for 30 seconds prior to any 
intervention (analgesia administration or venom injection) and then for 30 seconds 
every 30 minutes.  Each mouse was individually marked for identification.  The 
number of head movements performed over 30 seconds was counted for each 
mouse.  Head movements were selected to differentiate between mice which were 
completely immobile and those which showed some interest in their surroundings.   
2.11  Pathology 
Initially post mortem examinations were carried out to try to determine the likely 
cause of death and target organs of the venom toxins.  It was noted that the severity 
of the pathological lesions appeared to be related to the dose of venom received 
and the length of time the mouse had been exposed to the venom. Post mortem 
mailto:jeffrey.mogil@mcgill.ca
examinations were carried out on mice which had died or euthanased during the 
experiment and at the end any surviving mice were euthanased in a rising 
concentration of CO2.  If blood samples were required, cardiac puncture was 
performed prior to performing a gross post mortem examination and blood stored 
in appropriate sample tubes.  Photographs were taken as applicable and samples 
collected in 10% formalin for histopathology.  If relevant, urine samples were 
collected in Eppendorf tubes. 
2.11.1 Gross post mortem examination 
Post mortem examinations were performed on mice as soon as possible after 
death or CO2 euthanasia. External features were observed for surface 
haemorrhages, epistaxis, haemoptysis, hyphaema and colour of extremities. Signs 
of sweating, salivation and voided urine were noted. 
A mid-line incision was made from the level of the pubis up the abdomen and 
thorax, extending to the ramus of the mandible.  The skin was reflected, pinned 
back and a note made of abnormalities in the subcutaneous tissues  pale, 
congested, jaundiced, or haemorrhagic. Similarly, the musculature of the body wall 
and hind limbs were examined before making a midline incision into the abdominal 
cavity. Any intra-abdominal blood, with or without clots, was recorded and the 
colour of the abdominal organs noted. The size of the bladder and colour of urine 
were recorded, and a sample of urine collected to be examined for blood, 
haemoglobin or protein. The testicles were inspected for evidence of haemorrhage. 
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was removed by severing the oesophagus, where 
it passes through the diaphragm, and the rectum, by carefully teasing it free from 
the mesentry. Any discolouration - congestion, haemorrhage, dark green, black or 
yellow - was noted. The spleen was removed with the GIT. The stomach and 
sections of the intestines were split longitudinally, washed gently with 10% formalin 
before placing in a labelled Falcon tube, containing sufficient 10% formalin to cover 
the contents, to allow later histopathological examination. 
The liver was excised, making a note of gall bladder size. The kidneys were left in 
situ, unless required for histopathology. Before opening the thorax, the diaphragm 
was examined for haemorrhages and signs of haemothorax, which is best 
visualised through the diaphragm.  
The thoracic wall and diaphragm were removed to allow inspection of the thoracic 
contents; the heart, lungs and thymus (pluck).  The pluck was removed by splitting 
the mandible, dissecting the tongue, larynx, trachea and oesophagus followed by 
lungs, heart and thymus.  
Any abnormality of the forelimbs was noted (muscle or joint haemorrhage) and 
samples taken for histopathology, before turning the carcase over to examine the 
cranium.  A midline incision was made over the skull and neck and the skin 
reflected to expose the eyes and cranium, noting any congestion or haemorrhage.  
Finally, a square of the skull extending from between the eyes to the foramen 
magnum was removed, to allow examination of the brain. The brain was carefully 
dissected free from the skull and the ventral surface of the brainstem, mid-brain 
and hypothalamus examined. 
Photographs were taken of representative pathological lesions and of any unusual 
or unexpected findings.

2.11.2 Sample fixation 
Samples were fixed in 10% formalin in individual Universal or Falcon tubes.  To 
prevent autolysis, the stomach and intestines were split longitudinally, the contents 
rinsed gently with formalin prior to fixation in a tube of fresh formalin.  If an 
immediate post mortem examination was not possible the mice were placed in a 
tube of 10% formalin after opening the abdomen and thorax mid-line.  
Unfortunately, with these specimens the brain was poorly preserved, although 
gross haemorrhage, if present, was visible. 
2.11.3 Blood smears 
Thin blood smears were made and stained with Diff-Quick, then examined using 
oil immersion microscopy.  
2.11.4 Clotting 
Samples were collected via cardiac puncture from several mice from the same 
treatment group so that there was sufficient blood to fill a 1.5mL sodium citrate 
blood tube.  The samples were kept on ice prior to centrifugation to remove the red 
cells.  The serum was frozen prior to dispatch to a specialist laboratory for 
measurement of clotting factors. 
2.11.5 Histopathology 
Samples in 10% formal saline were sent to the Department of Veterinary 
Pathology, University of Liverpool for histopathology examination.  The samples 
were first embedded in paraffin blocks prior to slicing with a microtome.  Any 
samples containing bone were decalcified before processing.  Sections were 
mounted and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.  Other stains were used where 
appropriate.   
2.11.6 Results analysis 
Presence of congestion, petechial, ecchymotic, haemorrhage, any change in 
colour or consistency and whether focal or diffuse, was recorded in Post mortem 
examinations were performed on mice as soon as possible after death or CO2 
euthanasia. External features were observed for surface haemorrhages, epistaxis, 
haemoptysis, hyphaema and colour of extremities. Signs of sweating, salivation 
and voided urine were noted. 
A mid-line incision was made from the level of the pubis up the abdomen and

and hypothalamus examined. 
Photographs were taken of representative pathological lesions and of any unusual 
or unexpected findings. 
Table 2.11-1.  
Congestion, mild haemorrhage or a change in colour/consistency was assigned a 
score of 1 and a score of 2 for moderate to severe haemorrhage for each organ 
affected.  The total score was termed the pathology score.   
2.11.7 Survival (Mortality) Score 
To quantify time taken for lesions to develop the duration of survival was taken into 
consideration.  The majority of experiments ran over 6 hours, so this time was 
divided into twelve 30 minute periods.  Mice which died in the first 29 minutes were 
assigned a survival score of 12, those which died within 30 to 59 minutes a score 
of 11, and so on.  Those mice which survived for 6 hours were assigned a score of 
0.  The pathology and survival scores were added together, the sum of which was 
taken as a measure of the severity of venom-induced lesions and termed the 
pathology/survival score (PSS).  
On reflection, a better term for this score would be mortality score, as the highest 
score is assigned to those individuals which died in the shortest time. 
Chapter 3. Reduction: Analysis of the correlation of in 
vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy of multiple 
antivenom and venom combinations 
3.1 Objectives 
 To test the hypothesis that the results of in vitro assays can accurately 
predict those of in vivo antivenom (AV) efficacy assays. 
 On the basis of these results to be able to recommend a reduction in 
the) number of in vivo assays required for preclinical testing of 
antivenoms. 
Lethality is the single most important metric in the preclinical study of snake 
venom toxicity and in the evaluation of the neutralizing ability of antivenoms 
(WHO, 2010). In vivo preclinical testing was not carried out as part of this study 
because poor binding profiles and cytotoxicity neutralisation between the 
majority of heterologous venom/antivenom combinations suggested a poor 
outcome of neutralisation of venom toxicity. It was therefore considered 
unethical to proceed to in vivo studies when there would be no medical 
advantage by doing so.  Evidence would suggest that the homologous 
venom/antivenom combinations are effective, both in vivo, and clinically- 
EchiTabG against E. ocellatus venom (Casewell et al, 2010); EchiTab Plus-
ICP against B. arietans and N. nigricollis venoms (Segura et al, 2010); and

and Dividson, 1996). However, the deficiencies of this section of the study 
regarding the correlation of in vitro and in vivo assays are covered in Chapter 
3.2 Introduction 
The present WHO gold standard in vivo preclinical assays of venom toxicity 
(LD50) and AV efficacy (ED50) (Theakston and Reid, 1983), required before 
any antivenom may be administered to human snakebite patients, were 
developed by the Alistair Reid Venom Research Unit (ARVRU). A number of 
modifications have since been introduced, such as range finding, to reduce 
the numbers of mice required to perform these assays. For range finding LD50 
or ED50 experiments only one or two mice per dose is used and, in this way, 
the likely range of doses required to perform the full assay is determined 
(Meier et al, 1986).  At ARVRU, it has been shown that the group size could 
be reduced from 6 to 5 mice, without affecting the Probit analysis (Finney, 
1971), potentially saving at least 4 mice per experiment. 
The ARVRU has also pioneered experimental approaches to reduce the use 
of in vivo murine lethality assay including the use of non-sentient fertilised 
hens eggs (Sells et al, 1997; Sells et al, 1998; Sells et al, 2001), in vitro ELISA 
(Theakston and Reid, 1979) and a haemolytic test (Theakston and Reid, 
1983).  Success in achieving a substantial reduction has been hampered by 
lack of detailed knowledge of the many constituents of venom, which have to 
be assessed as a whole, rather than individually.  The current gold standard 
tests of venom toxicity and preclinical antivenom efficacy are the in vivo LD50 
and ED50. New technologies applied to the individual venom proteins show 
some promise in the development of novel in vitro assays to be designed 
which enable a reduction in the number of animals required (Sells, 2003). 
3.2.1 Insensate hens eggs 
Fertile hens eggs which have been incubated for less than 10 days do not 
have a complete nervous reflex system and therefore are held not to 
experience pain.  The embryos have a vascularised yolk sac membrane with 
a normal blood circulation and display a primitive embryonic beating heart, the 
arrest of which provides a clear endpoint for lethality testing.  The results of 
mouse and egg LD50s showed a strong correlation, as did the ED50s and could 
therefore substantially reduce both the numbers of experimental animals 
required and also the considerable costs involved in delivering improved 
clinical treatment of snake-bite (Sells et al, 1997; Sells et al 1998; Sells et al, 
2001; Sells, 2003).  However, because of the rudimentary development of both 
the cardiac and neurological systems of the eggs employed, the embryo lacks 
key receptors excluding the use of cardiotoxic and neurotoxic venoms from 
this type of assay. This effectively restricts the use of egg assays to 
haemorrhagic venoms, making the technique too limited for more general use 
(Sells, 2003). 
3.2.2 ELISA 
Endpoint ELISA has been used to screen antisera and AVs for their venom 
binding potency since all effective AVs will require high ELISA IgG titres. 
Results using four medically important African venoms, including both Viper 
and Elapid venoms, showed good correlation with in vivo ED50 (Theakston and 
Reid, 1979). It is rapid, cheap, simple, economical in terms of the amounts of 
venom used and, most importantly, offers opportunities to reduce the need for 
live animals (Theakston et al, 1977; Peres et al, 2006; Kulawickrama et al, 
2010). One publication (OLeary et al, 2014) claims that an ELISA to measure 
venom-antivenom complexes may be used to totally replace in vivo testing of 
antivenom efficacy. However, ELISA results of venom-antivenom interactions 
do not always (for example, Cook et al 2010) reflect an AVs ability to neutralise 
the toxic effects of venom in vivo, and ELISA is therefore an unreliable 
replacement for in vivo testing, despite its potential to substantially reduce the 
numbers of animals required.   
Avidity ELISA is a variation of the standard ELISA assay in which antibodies 
bound to antigen are exposed to increasing concentrations of a chaotropic 
agent, such as ammonium thiocyanate, and the resistance to elution of the 
antibody by the chaotropic agent is measured (Pullen et al, 1986; MacDonald 
et al, 1988). This methodology is not applicable to all antibody-antigen systems 
(Hall et al, 1988) and an invalid result may occur in some instances due to 
changes induced in binding to the secondary antibody (Gray et al, 1993). It 
has been shown (Ibrahim and Farid, 2009, Cook et al, 2010; Casewell et al, 
2010) that avidity ELISA had a better correlation to in vivo lethality tests than 
the standard ELISA. 
3.2.3 In vitro clotting test 
Varying venom doses are incubated at 37oC with 200L of human or mouse 
plasma and clotting time recorded.  The 60-s clotting dose is calculated by 
plotting clotting time against venom dose and reading the dose at 60s from the 
resultant curve (Casewell et al, 2014; Theakston and Reid, 1983).  
Neutralisation of clotting may be assessed using this technique, by incubating 
antivenom varying doses with the 60-s clotting dose of venom prior to the 
addition of plasma. Use of this test is limited to those venoms which contain 
procoagulant toxins. 
3.2.4 Nerve-muscle preparations 
Nerve-muscle preparations, such as chick biventer-cervis and rat or mouse 
phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations are used to assess the neuromuscular 
effects of neurotoxic venom components (Barfaraz et al, 1994; Bulbring et al, 
1946; Harvey et al, 1994; Ginsborg et al, 1960). The chick preparation is more 
robust and more easily implemented than either rodent nerve-diaphragm 
model and is therefore suitable to use as a means of assessing whether the 
neuromuscular effects of snake venoms are neutralised by antivenom (Harvey 
et al, 1994). However, the WHO guidelines state that neurotoxicity should be 
determined using in vivo LD50 (WHO, 2010).

Each antivenom was diluted to a concentration of 25g/L, in order that the 
results of each in vitro assay were directly comparable.  Antivenoms of 
unknown formulation and/or containing preservative were dialysed into 0.9% 
sodium chloride, protein concentration measured by OD, then diluted to 25g/L. 
Malaysian Green Pit Viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) and King Cobra 
(Ophiophagus hannah) antivenoms had a final protein concentrations of 12g/L 
and 9g/L respectively; the dilution for these antivenoms was adjusted to 
provide an equivalent amount of starting protein in each assay.

3.3.2 Methods  
The details of the following assays are described in Chapter 2. 
3.3.2.1 Western Blot 
The proteins of the five non-reduced test venoms were fractionated using a 15 
well comb for subsequent staining with Coomassie Blue (see Section 2.3.1) or 
a single well comb for subsequent immunoblotting (see Section 2.3.2). The 
membranes were cut into 9 strips before one strip from each blotted venom 
was probed with AV or normal sheep/horse serum (PIS), using a dilution of 
1:1000, except for Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom (12g/L) and king cobra 
antivenom (9g/L), when dilutions of 1:500 and 1:250 were used, respectively, 
to compensate for their lower starting concentration as noted above. 
3.3.2.2 Endpoint ELISA 
Endpoint ELISAs were performed as described in section 2.3.3. A starting 
concentration of 25mg/L was used for all antivenoms. 
3.3.2.3 Avidity ELISA 
Avidity ELISAs were performed as described in Section 2.3.4 using the 
antivenom dilutions employed for the endpoint ELISA (25mg/L). 
3.3.2.4 Small Scale Affinity Chromatography (SSAC) 
Sepharose Fast Flow gel was coupled to each of the five venoms described in 
Section 2.3.5.1 and 1mL of AV added to each venom-coupled columns as 
described in Section 2.3.5.2. Venom specific antibody (VSAb) concentrations 
and percentage VSAbs were calculated. 
3.3.2.5 Immunocytotoxicity (ICT) assays 
Immunocytotoxicity refers to the neutralisation of venom cytopathic effect 
(VCPE) by antibodies.  
Cytotoxicity assessment for each venom was performed as described in 
Section 2.4.2.  A checkerboard neutralisation assay was then performed 
(Section 8.4.2.3), using a 96 well culture plate, with venom concentrations from 
0x to 5x LC50 in columns B-G of a 96 well culture plate and serial antivenom 
dilutions from row 2 through to row 10.  The results of these assays allowed 
the venom concentration and starting antivenom dilution to be selected so that 
a cytotoxicity neutralisation assay could be performed for each 
venom/antivenom (V/AV) combination as described in Section 2.4.3. 
3.4 Results 
3.4.1 Western Blot 
An SDS-PAGE was performed to separate the protein components of the five 
test venoms which were then stained with Coomassie Blue (Figure 3.4-1C).   
The Viper venoms contained components of higher molecular weight than the 
two elapid venoms, which is consistent with the presence of enzymes such as 
snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) and serine proteases (SVSPs), with 
fewer, less intensely staining low molecular weight compounds.  In contrast, 
the elapid venoms appear to be rich in low molecular weight compounds, 
consistent with PLA2s and 3FTxs. The mamba venom was particularly rich in 
compounds with a molecular weight less than 15kDa. However, both elapid 
venoms contained proteins of 50kDa or greater. The proteomes of all five 
venoms are discussed in relation to their venom-induced pathogenesis in 
Chapter 1. 
Single venom gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed 
with the selection of antivenoms listed in Table 3.3-2. The resulting blots are 
illustrated in Figure 3.4-1. To assess the degree of crossreactivity the number, 
position (MW) and intensity of staining of bands is compared to the stained 
venom gels. 
Echis ocellatus (Figure 3.4-1E) Antivenoms 1 (EchiTabG) and 3 
(EchiTabPlus) are this venoms homologous antivenoms. EchiTabPlus shows 
the strongest binding, but EchiTabG shows more low molecular weight bands 
than the venom gel. There is considerable crossreactivity with ViperaVet, 
directed against unrelated vipers from a geographically distant continent, 
although there are a number of protein bands missing from the blot that are 
present in the venom gel. Bands are visible on all the other antivenom blots, 
demonstrating some crossreactivity, but there are bands missing and the blots 
the staining is of lower intensity, indicating binding to fewer venom proteins 
and to a lesser extent than to its homologous antivenom. There are even a 
couple of bands visible on the normal horse serum blot, suggesting that there 
is some non-specific binding present. 
Bitis arietans (Figure 3.4-1B). Antivenoms 3 (EchiTabPlus) and 4 (SAIMR 
polyvalent) are this venoms homologous antivenoms. Once again, the 
strongest binding is by EchiTabPlus and more bands are visible than on the 
venom gel. There is a similar pattern of binding by SAIMR polyvalent 
antivenom, but the staining has a much lower intensity. There is good 
crossreactivity between this venom and EchiTabG or ViperaVet, the two ovine 
IgG antivenoms, with a greater staining density than for SAIMR polyvalent; this 
may be because a different secondary antibody was used, which may have 
had different affinities for the two antivenom donor proteins. There is some 
crossreactivity with the unrelated viper antivenom, Trimeresurus albolabris (5), 
but little with the unrelated, geographically distinct King cobra antivenom (6). 
There is considerable crossreactivity with CSL Australian polyvalent 
antivenom (7). Normal sheep serum shows little crossreactivity with this 
venom, with only one distinct band, but there are two distinct bands on the blot 
probed with normal horse serum and a few very faint bands, again indicating 
some non-specific binding. 
Vipera berus (Figure 3.4-1V). Antivenom 2 (ViperaVet) is the homologous 
antivenom for this venom. The higher molecular weight bands are distinct, with 
merging of the bands of molecular weight less than around 40 kDa. There is 
good crossreactivity between this antivenom and the others which are directed 
against Vipers for protein bands greater than 25kDa. There are around six 
faintly staining bands on the King cobra antivenom (6) blot and some strong 
high molecular weight bands on the CSL antivenom (7) blot. The normal sheep 
serum blot shows one strong high molecular weight band and a few very faintly 
staining bands. There are no visible bands on the normal horse serum blot. 
Naja nigricollis (Figure 3.4-1N). EchiTabPlus (3) is the venoms homologous 
antivenom, and this antivenoms blot shows the most binding. The bands 
representing components less than 50kDa are not distinct, but there does 
appear to be binding to lower molecular weight proteins and peptides. SAIMR 
polyvalent antivenom (4) shows a similar pattern of binding, but staining of this 
blot is less intense. Other Naja species, including other spitting cobras, are 
included in the immunogen mix of this antivenom. There is crossreactivity with 
the higher molecular weight venom components and the two viper antivenoms, 
EchiTabG (1) and ViperaVet (2), but only 2 bands on the Trimeresurus 
albolabris antivenom (5) blot. There are both high and low molecular bands on 
the other two elapid blots (6 and 7). 
Dendroaspis angusticeps (Figure 3.4-1D). SAIMR polyvalent antivenom (4) 
is the only antivenom to contain antibodies directed specifically against this 
venom and this blot shows the most intense staining of any of the antivenom 
blots of this venom. Unlike the venom gel for this species, staining of the lower 
molecular weight components is faint, suggesting a poor immune response to 
these compounds. Once again, there is crossreactivity of high molecular 
weight venom components with antivenoms directed against both Vipers and 
Elapids; whilst only the CSL Australian polyvalent antivenom shows any 
binding to low molecular weight components. 
It is thus concluded that there is generally good crossreactivity between high 
molecular weight venom components and heterologous venoms, whilst 
binding to lower molecular weight bands is more specific, at least to the same 
family. Intensity of binding is also more specific for the same family or genus. 
Lower molecular weight components stained less well than the higher 
molecular weight components.  This may be either because the low molecular 
weight compounds are less immunogenic, or due to larger molecular weight 
compounds having more epitopes available to bind to antibodies.  It would 
appear that this assay has a high sensitivity but poor specificity.

3.4.2 End-point ELISA 
A starting dilution of 25mg/L was used for all antivenoms, the end point titre 
was defined as the dilution at which the absorbance was equal to the mean 
absorbance of the control plus two standard deviations (SD).  
The results are summarised in Table 3.4-1, for EchiTabG, ViperaVet, 
EchiTabPlus and SAIMR polyvalent antivenoms in Figure 3.4-2 and for 
Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom, King cobra and CSL Australian polyvalent 
antivenoms in Figure 3.4-3.  
EchiTabG and ViperaVet, the two ovine IgG antivenoms, had the highest 
binding titre to their homologous venoms, E. ocellatus venom and V. berus 
venom respectively.  EchiTabG and ViperaVet bound well to V. berus venom 
and E. ocellatus venom, respectively and, to a lesser extent, they bound to B. 
arietans venom and the two elapid venoms.  The B. arietans venom plate 
achieved nearly the same absorbances as the V. berus venom plate, although 
maximum binding was not achieved at the initial antivenom dilution. However, 
the absorbances of the elapid venom plates were around half of the 
homologous venom/antivenom plates; in this case, endpoint titre was a more 
accurate measure of antivenom binding, and demonstrates that the 
crossreactivity of EchiTabG for the two heterologous viper venoms, V. berus 
and B. arietans, was similar.  
Trivalent EchiTabPlus and SAIMR polyvalent antivenoms (Figure 3.4-2) are 
directed against the majority of medically important snake venoms from Sub-
Saharan Africa; both contain antibodies to B. arietans venom. EchiTabPlus 
contains antibodies to N. nigricollis venom, whilst SAIMR polyvalent 
antivenom does not. The latter does however, contain antibodies to the 
venoms of other cobras (both spitters and non-spitters) of the genus, Naja. Of 
the antivenoms selected, only SAIMR polyvalent antivenom contains 
antibodies to D. angusticeps venom.

The highest binding of EchiTabPlus was to E. ocellatus venom, which was 
greater than that to N. nigricollis venom and B. arietans venom respectively. 
Whilst these experiments demonstrated that binding to V. berus venom was 
greater than that to B. arietans venom, in another set of experiments the 
reverse was observed; the results of this second set of experiments can be 
found in the chapter supplement.  Whilst EC50 dilution of EchiTabPlus bound 
to D. angusticeps venom was only slightly lower than to the other venoms, its 
assay end-point titre was found to be much lower, suggesting that 
EchiTabPlus would be ineffective at neutralising D. angusticeps venom. 
SAIMR polyvalent antivenom had the highest binding to D. angusticeps 
venom, followed by B. arietans venom / V. berus venom, N. nigricollis venom 
and E. ocellatus venom in descending order. The endpoint titre of SAIMR 
polyvalent antivenom binding to E. ocellatus venom was four times lower than 
that of N. nigricollis venom. Given that V. berus venom is from an unrelated 
genus and that the snake originates from a different continent, the efficacy of 
SAIMR polyvalent antivenom at binding to this venom was somewhat 
unexpected. 
Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom, an equine whole IgG formulation (Figure 
3.4-3) showed similar binding to the viper venoms but negligible binding to the 
two elapid venoms.  
King Cobra antivenom and CSL Australian polyvalent antivenom showed 
insignificant binding to any of the viper venoms, there was, however, some 
binding by King Cobra antivenom to both elapid venoms and by CSL 
Australian polyvalent antivenom to N. nigricollis venom (Figure 3.4-3).

3.4.3 Avidity ELISA 
A dilution of 25g/L was used for all antivenoms, and the results showed 
that antivenoms had a higher avidity for their homologous compared to 
heterologous venoms.  In this assay, the highest avidity observed was 
50% disruption of binding by 4.8M ammonium thiocyanate, between 
SAIMRp and V. berus venom, then by 4.4M ammonium thiocyanate, 
between the two polyspecific antivenoms, ViperaVet and EchiTabPlus, 
and their homologous venoms, V. berus venom and N. nigricollis venom, 
respectively.  These results are summarised in Table 3.4-2 and illustrated 
in Figure 3.4-4, Figure 3.4-5 and Figure 3.4-6. The graphs of endpoint 
ELISA venom/antivenom binding are almost identical to those illustrating 
the disruption of venom/antivenom binding by ammonium thiocyanate.

3.4.4 Small scale affinity chromatography  
Small scale affinity chromatography (SSAC) is used to measure binding of 
different antivenoms to venom, or combination of venoms, which have been 
covalently bound to the matrix of a chromatography column; the assay 
measures the venom-specific antibody (VSAb) content of a sample, 
regardless of donor species or antibody fragment.  The results are 
summarised in Table 3.4-3; showing that non-specific binding was greater for 
normal sheep serum (SPIS) than for normal horse serum (HPIS). As for 
ELISA, results show binding of venom to their homologous antivenom to be 
greater than for heterologous antivenoms. Binding of antivenom was 
considered relevant if the VSAb content exceeded that of normal serum from 
the same donor species. Again, the highest binding occurred between 
EchiTabG and E. ocellatus venom (16.9% VSAb), closely followed by that 
between ViperaVet and V. berus venom (14.6% VSAb).  It is interesting that 
the VSAb content was always less than 20% of total protein, highlighting that 
more than 80% of the protein in antivenom is ineffective at binding to, or 
neutralising venom components. 
Echis ocellatus venom 
EchiTabG had the greatest concentration of VSAbs (17% of total IgG) to E. 
ocellatus venom, with EchiTabPlus containing 10% VSAbs. Similarly, SAIMRp 
contained a higher concentration of VSAbs to E. ocellatus venom than the 
normal sera, but ViperaVet, Trimeresurus albolabris, Banded Krait and CSL 
antivenoms contained VSAbs equivalent to normal sera and therefore did not 
exhibit significant crossreactivity to E. ocellatus venom.

Bitis arietans venom 
EchiTabPlus and SAIMRp had the highest concentration of VSAbs to B. 
arietans venom, with ViperaVet, EchiTabG and, surprisingly, Banded Krait 
antivenoms showed levels of specificity higher than normal sera. Trimeresurus 
albolabris antivenom and CSL did not show significant crossreactivity to this 
venom. 
Vipera berus venom 
The V. berus venom column bound to VSAb in ViperaVet, EchiTabG, SAIMRp 
and EchiTabPlus at an appreciably higher concentration than the normal sera. 
Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom bound to V. berus venom at a VSAb 
concentration higher than that of non-specific binding, suggesting some 
crossreactivity, but the two elapid antivenoms (Banded Krait and CSL 
Australian polyvalent) had VSAb concentrations equivalent to the non-specific 
binding by HPIS.  
Naja nigricollis venom 
EchiTabPlus and SAIMRp were the only antivenoms containing significant 
VSAbs to N. nigricollis venom, with a slightly higher level of these VSAbs in 
CSL, and EchiTabG antivenoms than in normal sera. There was no 
crossreactivity of N. nigricollis venom with ViperaVet, Trimeresurus albolabris 
or Banded Krait antivenoms. 
Dendroaspis angusticeps venom 
SAIMRp contained the highest concentration of VSAbs directed against D. 
angusticeps venom. Both normal sheep and horse serums had low non-
specific binding in this column.  CSL antivenom had a VSAb concentration at 
least twice that of normal sera; EchiTabG contained VSAbs slightly higher than 
that of the normal sera and ViperaVet, whilst Trimeresurus albolabris and 
Banded Krait antivenoms contained VSAbs equivalent to those of the normal 
sera and therefore showed no significant crossreactivity with this venom. 
3.4.4.1 Immunocytotoxicity (ICT): EC50 
The median cytotoxicity of venoms is shown in Table 3.4-4 and neutralisation 
of their cytopathic effect (CPE) by different antivenoms in Table 3.4-5. It was 
observed that the CPE of venoms (Table 3.4-5) was neutralised by their 
homologous antivenoms.  
Table 3.4-4: Median cytotoxicity (LC50) of five snake venoms 
Echis ocellatus venom 
The best neutralisation of the CPE of E. ocellatus venom was by its 
homologous monovalent antivenom, EchiTabG followed by its homologous 
polyvalent antivenom, EchiTabPlus.  ViperaVet and SAIMRp antivenoms 
afforded some neutralisation, as did Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom, but 
less effectively.  There was no effective neutralisation by either of the elapid 
antivenoms (King Cobra or CSL). The results are illustrated in Figure 3.4-7A 
and Figure 3.4-8A.  
Bitis arietans venom 
The CPE of B. arietans venom was effectively neutralised by its homologous 
antivenoms SAIMRp and EchiTabPlus, the latter being the least potent (Table 
3.4-5).  EchiTabG, a heterologous antivenom, appeared to be remarkably 
effective at reducing its CPE with Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom being 
nearly as effective as SAIMRp.  Once again, the two elapid antivenoms were 
ineffective at neutralising this venoms CPE. Figure 3.4-7B and Figure 3.4-8B. 
Vipera berus venom 
The CPE of V. berus venom was best neutralised by its homologous 
antivenom, ViperaVet, but was also neutralised by heterologous antivenoms 
directed against African vipers (EchiTabG, EchiTabPlus and SAIMRp).

Naja nigricollis venom  
The CPE of N. nigricollis venom was neutralised by its homologous antivenom, 
EchiTabPlus and, less effectively, by SAIMRp antivenom, showing 
crossreactivity with the snake venoms from the same genus, against which is 
directed.  There was no neutralisation by any of the viper (ViperaVet, 
EchiTabG, Trimeresurus albolabris) or unrelated elapid antivenoms, King 
Cobra or CSL (Figure 3.4-7D and Figure 3.4-8D). 
Dendroaspis angusticeps venom 
D. angusticeps venom was neutralised by its homologous antivenom, 
SAIMRp. It was not neutralised effectively by any of the other antivenoms. 
Results are illustrated in Figure 3.4-7E and Figure 3.4-8E.

3.4.4.2 Relationship between the results of all in vitro assays 
The relationships between all the in vitro results are described for each venom 
below. Correlation is expressed as R2, a rank correlation coefficient.

Figure 3.4-9: Linear correlation of results (R2) between assays - E. ocellatus venom  
The correlation (R2) between assays for E. ocellatus venom is summarised in 
Table 3.4-6. There was a strong correlation between ELISA endpoint titre and 
binding with %VSAb, between ELISA endpoint titre and binding with ICT 
potency and between %VSAb with ICT potency. However, there was a poorer 
correlation between Avidity ELISA M50 with the results of the other assays.

Bitis arietans venom 
The correlations (R2) between assays for B. arietans venom are summarised 
in Table 3.4-7. There was a smaller correlation between assay results for this 
venom than for E. ocellatus venom. There appeared to be a particularly poor 
correlation between ICT potency and %VSAb (Figure 3.4-10J). The 
correlations between both ELISA binding and ICT potency (Figure 3.4-10D) 
and between ELISA binding and avidity M50 (Figure 3.4-10B) were also poor. 
The highest correlation was between ICT potency and ELISA end-point titre 
(Figure 3.4-10E) or Avidity ELISA M50 (Figure 3.4-10 I).

Avidity M50 and between ELISA end-point titre and ICT potency. There was a

Only two of the antivenoms successfully neutralised the CPE of D. angusticeps 
venom, providing insufficient data for comparison with other assays. Avidity 
M50 results correlated well with the other assay results (Figure 3.4-13B, D and

3.5 Discussion 
Many studies (Archundia et al, 2011; Bogarin et al, 2000; Casewell et al, 2010; 
Casewell et al, 2014a; Fernandes et al, 2000; Furtado et al, 2010; Gutierrez 
et al, 2008; Maduwage et al, 2016; Nalbantsoy et al, 2009; Sanchez et al, 
2008; Sanchez et al, 2011; Segura et al, 2012) have been conducted on 
paraspecificity of antivenoms for closely related snake venom species, usually 
of the same genus, but none of the studies appear to have looked at the cross-
reactivity of such a diverse selection of antivenoms with venoms 
encompassing two families and five different genera of snake species.  The 
main objective of this study was to examine the ability of each assay at 
recognising antivenom specificity, and sensitivity in prediction of in vivo 
efficacy.  An assay which demonstrates such specificity and sensitivity could 
be recommended to reduce the need to preclinically test every batch of 
antivenom manufactured, whose in vivo neutralizing efficacy has previously 
been demonstrated. Ideally the assay should be quick, simple, robust and 
inexpensive, without the need for costly specialist equipment. To this end 
immunoblotting, ELISA, avidity ELISA, SSAC and immunocytotoxicity (ICT) 
were selected. The latter requires specialist facilities, but it is hypothesized 
that a cell-based assay may give differentiation between binding to, and 
neutralisation by, antibodies. 
Figure 3.5-1 shows the phylogeny of medically important African snakes and 
demonstrates cross-neutralisation of venoms by existing antivenoms, for 
example, EchiTab-Plus ICP neutralises its homologous venom, N. nigricollis 
and heterologous venoms N. mossambica and N. pallida, but not those of N. 
katiensis or N. nubiae (Petras et al, 2011). EchiTabG neutralised its 
homologous E. ocellatus venom, and heterologous E. pyramidum leakeyi and 
E. coloratus venoms, but not Asian E. carinatus venom (Casewell et al, 2010). 
The failure of cross-neutralisation between E. ocellatus and E. carinatus is also 
described by others (Mebs et al, 1981; Visser et al, 2008). Similarly, antivenom 
directed against D. polylepis, D. viridis, B. arietans and B. gabonica failed to 
cross-neutralise D. angusticeps or B. nasicornis venoms (Ramos-Cerillo, 
2008).  
Figure 3.5-1: Phylogeny of (A) medically important African elapids and (B) viperids 
and reported antivenom cross-neutralisation outcomes. Bitis parviocula and 
Pseudohaje goldii have not been included in any comprehensive phylogenetic 
analyses, and their placement should be regarded as tentative. Brackets on right of 
tree indicate cross-neutralisation. Bold lines indicate venoms used to raise 
antivenom, thin lines paraspecific activity, blue with tick mark indicates effective 
cross-neutralisation, and red with cross mark indicates lack of cross-neutralisation 
(Williams et al, 2011). 1 (Petras et al, 2011); 2 (Casewell et al, 2010); 3 (Mebs et al, 
1981); 4 (Visser et al, 2008); 5 (Ramos-Cerillo et al, 2008) 
Immunoblotting demonstrated that heterologous venoms directed against 
viper venoms bound to components of other viper venoms, but that they also 
bound to higher MW proteins of the elapid venoms.  Generally, the low MW 
bands (e.g. 3FTxs, PLA2s, vasoactive peptides) were not bound by 
heterologous antivenoms, and sometimes poorly by their homologous 
antivenom. This has been demonstrated by other researchers (Boldini-Franca 
et al, 2010; Fahmi et al, 2012; Gutierrez et al, 2014; Gutierrez et al, 2013) 
using immunoblotting and/or antivenomic approaches. Immunoblotting and 
antivenomics can identify which venom components are not bound and, as 
information is accrued on the pathological importance of these components, 
ineffective antivenoms can be rejected prior to in vivo testing.  
The ELISA results showed cross-reactivity of viper antivenoms to both 
heterologous viper venoms and elapid antivenoms for heterologous elapid 
venoms.  B. arietans venom showed least binding to the test antivenoms, even 
to its homologous antivenoms (EchiTabPlus and SAIMRp).  E. ocellatus 
venom was bound by nearly all the antivenoms, including submaximally by 
King Cobra antivenom, but not at all to CSL antivenom. Although many of the 
Australian snake venoms are coagulopathic as well as neurotoxic, the 
coagulopathic toxins are serine proteases, which are structurally different from 
the coagulopathic SVMPs found in  E. ocellatus venom, and therefore induce 
the production of different Ab populations.  EchiTabG antivenom bound well 
to the two heterologous viper venoms, despite their apparently different 
pathological profile of envenoming. Antivenoms which did not bind well to 
venoms produced results which generated incomplete dilution curves, making 
calculation of 50% binding erroneous; in this case, the ability to bind was better 
represented by calculating end-point titre. However, these results are an 
indication that binding between these venom/antivenom combinations is 
inadequate to afford effective neutralisation of venom toxicity. 
Avidity ELISA results are more specific when efficacy is defined as 50% 
absorption being greater than the lower detectable limit. Very few antivenoms, 
including ViperaVet and EchiTabG for B. arietans, EchiTabG and EchiTabPlus 
for V. berus venom, but not Trimeresurus albolabris, King cobra or CSL 
antivenoms, showed cross-reactivity for heterologous venoms, showing the 
assay is more specific for venom species.  
Results of the avidity ELISA was expressed as the M50 (molarity of ammonium 
thiocyanate which resulted in 50% disruption of binding). These results did not 
appear to correlate with the end-point titre ELISA results. Casewell (et al, 
2010), describe the results of the avidity ELISA as percentage reduction - the 
absorbance of 8M ammonium thiocyanate expressed as the percentage of 
control (0M) absorbance.  Figure 3.4-4 shows the results from section 3.4.3 
expressed in this way.  Results where venom/antivenom binding was 
considered not effective were excluded. 
Despite being a simple, robust and reproducible method, SSAC has not been 
widely used to measure VSAb concentration of antivenoms. Of all the 
publications listed, only one (Casewell et al, 2010) used SSAC as a means of 
comparing antivenom efficacy.  However, the reverse, using antivenom as the 
solid phase, is becoming more widely used as a means of identifying which 
venom components are bound, and is called antivenomics (Boldini-Franca, 
2010; Calvete, 2016; Fahmi, 2012; Gutierrez et al, 2008, Gutierrez et al, 
2013a, Gutierrez et al, 2013b, Gutierrez et al, 2014; Jorge et al, 2015; Kurtovik 
et al, 2014; Petras et al, 2011; Sanchez et al, 2015).  The SSAC assay 
identified homologous antivenoms, with the highest antibody titre, and those 
heterologous antivenoms directed against venoms of the same genera.  VSAb 
concentrations of antivenoms showing weak cross-reactivity were only slightly 
higher than those of the normal sera (non-specific binding). A study performed, 
using aliquots of the same reference sample of Vipera antisera, showed a 
coefficient of variation of 3.5% over 27 runs (data not shown). This adds weight 
to the argument for using this assay to monitor antivenom quality over time. 
The ICT assay is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. However, in short, B. 
arietans venom and N. nigricollis venom had a poor CPE on the selected 
VERO cell line, which led to incomplete cell death, even at venom 
concentrations equivalent to 5xLC50 (The dose of venom resulting in the death 
of 50% of cells compared to untreated controls). The variable response of cells 
to venom made this assay difficult to standardize and therefore unsuitable as 
a QC test. 
There was a poor correlation between assays when results from all venoms 
were pooled, but there was however a correlation between assays when the 
results from venoms were considered individually. This may be because by 
analysing results together the power of single venom analyses is lost and 
reflects the likelihood that one method is unlikely to be useful across the 
board due to inherent differences in venom composition and toxin modes of 
action. 
Effectiveness, defined as having a 50% reduction in measurable effect greater 
than the lowest detectable limit, or non-specific binding for VSAb concentration 
by SSAC, had the highest venom specificity by SSAC and the highest 
sensitivity by immunoblotting and ELISA.  
Antivenomics is increasingly used to identify deficiencies in antivenom 
efficacy, revealing poor affinity for low molecular weight venom components 
such as 3FTxs, PLA2s, disintegrins, CRISPS, vasoactive peptides, serine 
proteases and P-I SVMPs (Gutierrez et al, 2014). This technique shows only 
binding of antivenom to venom proteins and therefore must be used in 
conjunction with neutralisation assays of venom specific activities, such as 
lethality, defibrinogenation, coagulation, haemorrhage, neurotoxicity and 
necrosis, to demonstrate antivenom efficacy (Calvete et al, 2016).  The 
quantitative binding assays such as end-point and avidity ELISAs and SSAC 
measure total binding and may miss failure of antibodies to bind to key venom 
components, such as those listed above. Binding may also be affected by 
binding of venom toxins to the solid phase (ELISA plate or Sepharose gel) and 
the resulting epitopes presented to the antibody added. Similarly, cell based 
assays may demonstrate neutralisation of venom cytotoxicity, but this may not 
equate to neutralisation of lethal in vivo effects. These factors may explain the 
poor correlation of immunological assays when results from all venoms were 
pooled, and highlights that one method is unlikely to fit all. It would be 
advisable to use several different assays, which have been tailored to the toxin 
profile of the venoms against which the antivenom is directed (WHO, 
Guidelines for the production, control and regulation of snake antivenom 
immunoglobulins update in progress). 
3.5.1 Conclusions 
In their present form, none of the assays described here, can replace the in 
vivo lethality assays.  Immunoblotting, ELISAs (both end-point and avidity) and 
SSAC measure binding of antivenom to venom, but this is unlikely to be 
synonymous with neutralisation (Casewell et al, 2010; Cook et al, 2010c). 
Cytotoxicity assays may demonstrate neutralisation of toxins which cause a 
cytopathic effect, but, as discussed more fully in Chapter 8, do not 
demonstrate neutralisation of intravascular or extracellular venom effects such 
as disruption of the clotting cascade, defibrinogenation or inflammatory 
response with the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. The 
main weakness in this study is the lack of in vivo comparators because it would 
be unethical to do so. 
The results presented in this chapter highlight the complexity of venom activity 
and its neutralisation. No one in vitro assay can assess the toxicity of all 
venoms and predict in vivo efficacy of antivenom. The selection of assays to 
test antivenom efficacy for regulatory purposes need to be carefully selected, 
based on the principal venom toxin characteristics identified.
Chapter 4. Reduction: Correlation of in vitro and in vivo 
preclinical assays using variant venom-specific IgG 
samples 
4.1 Introduction 
The previous chapter investigated the immune-binding relationship of 35 
venom/antivenom combinations. It was considered unethical to run this matrix 
of in vivo experiments (350 mice needed). Instead, in this section, the in vivo / 
in vitro assay assessment was performed using sheep antisera with high, 
medium or low concentrations of antivenom IgG, but all immunised with the 
same venom mixture. This study was made possible by the unique access to 
a flock of 25 sheep immunised for antivenom production, from which individual 
samples had been collected over a period of more than 2 years.  
This is believed to be the first study to utilise multiple antiserum samples 
containing different VSAb concentrations to investigate the correlation 
between the numerous assays, both in vitro and in vivo, employed to test 
antivenom efficacy.  
Assays performed on the pre- and post-purified IgG are shown in Table 4.1-1.

4.2 Objective 
The objective of this set of experiments was to demonstrate that in vitro 
experiments can predict the in vivo efficacy of antivenom, and that both can 
differentiate between samples of different quality.  Given that the majority of in 
vitro tests show only binding of antibodies to venom components, and not their 
ability to neutralise their pathological effects, if neutralisation can be 
demonstrated the in vitro tests might be used to monitor the quality of 
subsequent batches of AV provided that the following conditions are met:  
 the starting material (antiserum) came from the same pool of donors 
 no change in immunogen used (e.g. batch of venom)  
 consistent VSAb concentration of their pooled antiserum  
 robust and fixed manufacturing process. 
4.3 Materials and Method 
4.3.1 Sheep and antiserum production 
A flock of 25 mixed breed female sheep were maintained on pasture during 
the summer months and indoors, fed commercial concentrates with ad lib hay 
and water, during the winter. Body condition score (a subjective measure of 
muscle/fat on the animals back) was maintained at a score greater than, or 
equal to, 3 out of a maximum of 5; below this level the sheep were fed 
individually and/or removed from the flock until health was restored. The sheep 
were regularly checked by a veterinary surgeon as well as by the stockmen.  
The sheep were immunised with a 1:1:1:1 mixture of the four major species of 
European viper, namely Vipera ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus and V. latastei.  
Immunisations and blood removal was on a four week cycle, blood being taken 
two weeks after each immunisation.  After bleeding, the red blood cells were 
removed and serum pooled. The details of production and assessment of 
antiserum for antivenom production are described in the publication attached 
as Appendix III of this thesis (Bolton et al, 2014). 
Individual samples were obtained from the sheep at weeks 6,10, 50, 74, 90, 
110 and 126 and VSAb concentration measured by small scale affinity 
chromatography (SSAC).  It was from this library of samples that serum for 
this set of experiments was derived (Table 4.3-1). The samples were divided 
into those with the lowest VSAb concentration (<4g/L)  VipL; those with a 
moderate VSAb concentration (5.7 to 6.3g/L)  VipM; and those with the 
highest VSAb concentrations (>7.8g/L)  VipH.

4.3.2 Immunoglobulin (IgG) purification 
Once the samples were pooled, as described above, initial assessments were 
performed as listed in Table 4.1-1 above and the resulting aliquots frozen prior 
to purification. 
For purification, the three aliquots of Vipera antisera were thawed at 4oC for 
72 hours, then diluted 1:3 in 0.9% saline and 6% of the volume of the undiluted 
serum of Caprylic acid was added (Table 4.3-2). It was thoroughly mixed for 
30 minutes, on a roller mixer, prior to standing for 1 hour at room temperature. 
The mixture was then centrifuged at 5000rpm for 60 minutes and the 
precipitate discarded.

medium VSAb, VipL = Low VSAb.

The suspension was removed and filtered through a 0.65m pre-filter and then 
a 0.45m filter. The resulting solutions were concentrated and reformulated 
into sodium citrate buffered saline (SCS) (APPENDIX II), with pH 6.0, by 
means of a BioRad mini diafiltration system using three filters with a 30kDa 
cut-off. The solutions were concentrated down to 50mL and protein 
concentration measured by OD at 280nm. Each sample was diluted with SCS 
to produce a solution with a concentration around 25g/L (Table 4.3-3).

4.3.3 In vitro assessment 
The following assays were performed to assess antiserum and purified IgG: 
 Fast phase liquid chromatography (FPLC) 
 ELISA 
 Avidity ELISA 
 Small scale affinity chromatography (SSAC) 
 Immunocytotoxicity (ICT) 
The methodology of these assays is described in detail in Chapters 2 and 3. 
4.3.4 In vivo murine lethality neutralisation assays 
Murine lethality assays were performed as described in Section 2.2.2, with 
some modifications.  Purified IgG/AV at a volume equivalent to 1x ViperaVet 
(see Appendix II, section 2.3.2) ED50 (44L/mouse) was pre-incubated with 2.5 
x V. berus venom LD50 (18.2g/mouse) at 37oC for 30 minutes. Two groups 
per test sample, comprising of five CD1 male mice weighing 18-22g, were 
injected, via the tail vein, with 200L venom/IgG mixture. A commercially 
purified ovine IgG antivenom, ViperaVet (VPV), was used as the control. 
Regular behavioural, physiological and neurological observations were made 
(see Chapter 2A).  Humane end-points were employed to euthanase those 
mice deemed terminally affected, using CO2 anaesthesia.  Post mortem 
examinations were carried out on all mice and a pathology, survival and 
pathology/survival score assigned as described in Chapter 2A. This was 
performed as a randomized double blind experiment. 
4.4 Results 
4.4.1 FPLC 
To assess the efficacy of caprylic acid to remove non-IgG serum components, 
mainly albumin, FPLC was performed on the purified IgG pools. The purity of 
the three IgG samples was similar (all greater than 95%) and not related to 
VSAb concentration (Figure 4.4-1).  Similarly, the percentage of the peak area 
of the IgM peak the small peak to the left of the large peak - did not appear 
to be related to VSAb concentration. The FPLC chromatograms are illustrated 
in Figure 4.4-1. A summary of the results are shown in Table 4 of the tables 
section of the supplement for this chapter.

VipM and C- -VipL. The small peak is IgM and the large peak IgG. 
4.4.2 Western Blot 
The four Vipera venoms against which antiserum was raised, were separated 
by SDS-PAGE (Panel A, Figure 4.4-2) and blotted onto nitrocellulose 
membranes (Panels B, C and D, Figure 4.4-2). The membranes were then 
probed with -VipH, M and L IgG.  
The blots demonstrated that antibodies from all three IgG samples bound to 
all the venom protein bands, albeit with slightly different intensities.  This would 
suggest that antibody response was quantitative, not qualitative.

4.4.3 ELISA 
ELISA results can be affected by laboratory environmental conditions. To 
overcome this problem aliquots of a reference antiserum were used to correct 
for these inherent variations. The EC50 and endpoint titres of the three IgG 
samples reflected their calculated VSAb concentration. The binding potency 
was calculated by dividing the amount of venom/well by the amount of 
IgG/well, giving the results shown in Table 4.4-1 and Figure 4.4-3.

4.4.4 Avidity ELISA  
An avidity ELISA was performed on the -Vip IgG samples and a GMP 
manufactured sample of antivenom (ViperaVet). The high VSAb 
concentration sample had antibodies with the greatest avidity, having the 
same avidity as antibodies from unpurified reference antiserum.  ViperaVet, 
manufactured under GMP conditions, had an antibody avidity mid-way 
between the low and medium VSAb concentration samples. The results are 
summarised in Table 4.4-2 and Figure 4.4-4

4.4.5 SSAC 
SSAC was performed using a column conjugated to the same 1:1:1:1 mix of 
Vipera venoms used to immunise the donors, in order to select samples with 
the high, medium and low VSAb concentration for each group of pooled 
antisera. The results, using an SSAC column coupled to V. berus venom 
alone, are summarised in Table 4.4-3. A sample of normal sheep serum (PIS) 
showed non-specific binding of 1.0g/L

The results demonstrate the same pattern as the ELISA results in that the 
VSAb concentration and the percentage VSAb followed the trend low to 
high. SSAC was also performed post-purification using the 1:1:1:1 Vipera mix 
SSAC column (Table 4.4-4), which followed the same trend.

4.4.6 Immuno-cytotoxicity (ICT) 
Neutralisation of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of V. berus venom was performed 
using the -VipH, M and L IgG pools both pre- and post-purification. This assay 
was used to demonstrate not only binding by, but also neutralisation of venom 
toxicity of the different -Vipera IgG samples.  All samples, pre- and post-
purification, effectively neutralised the venom CPE and in both instances, the 
EC50 dilution increased with increasing VSAb concentration (Table 4.4-5). The 
full data set can be viewed in the chapter supplement.

The purified low and high samples required less antivenom to neutralise the 
venom CPE than their pre-purified antisera, but the difference between pre-
purified and purified medium sample was minimal.  The results are illustrated 
in Figure 4.4-5. The cells treated with purified low sample only achieved 
around 70% of control cell growth and the pre-purified sample around 80% 
maximum neutralisation. The initial 1:10 dilution of the pre-purified medium 
sample, incubated with V. berus venom, appeared to have a growth enhancing 
effect on the VERO cells.  This observation is discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 8.

Vipera antisera pre- (A) and post (B) IgG purification. 
4.4.7 In vivo modified ED50 
An ED50 assay was performed in which only one dose of venom and AV was 
used (10 mice per group).  The efficacy of the -VipH, M and L IgG samples 
and ViperaVet (VPV), preincubated with V. berus venom, was compared using 
the pathology/survival score (PSS) described in Chapter 2A; the dose groups 
were double-blinded. In the -VipM IgG group mice numbers 6 and 10 were 
misinjected, so their data has not been included (hence only 8 mice are 
reported in this group). 
A cage-side MGS scoring was performed at each time point, without using 
photography to determine the score of each facial feature; however no 
significant differences between the groups was observed. No analgesia was 
given and the mean MGS scores in all groups remained high throughout the 
experiment. A table detailing, and a figure illustrating, these results are 
located in the chapter supplement. Pathology and survival times are 
summarised in Table 4.4-6.

The GMP manufactured VPV gave a superior neutralisation over all the 
laboratory purified IgG samples, despite having an intermediate VSAb 
concentration.  Of the three test samples the mean pathology scores, 
survival scores and therefore PSSs showed an inverse relationship to the 
VSAb concentration, except for the -VipH group which had a slightly higher 
pathology score than the -VipM group.  In general, more mice in the -VipL 
group exhibited the pathological lesions listed in Table 4.4-6.  One mouse in 
the -VipH group, during post mortem examination, was found to have 
haemorrhages throughout its body, including throughout the entire intestinal 
tract, which is unusual for V. berus venom (see Chapter 7).  It was found 
dead at the end of the experiment, the likely cause of death being an 
intracerebral haemorrhage; this mouse had a high pathology score of 15 
(See Chapter 2A for scoring system), which may account for this groups 
greater than expected PSS (11.5 4.6) if said mouses score is omitted).  
4.4.8 Correlating results of the in vitro and in vivo assays 
Results of all four in vitro and in vivo assays performed are shown in Table 
4.4-7.  The results of the GMP, clean-room manufactured ViperaVet are 
included as a control. ViperaVet was manufactured from a pool of antiserum 
derived from the same flock, but taken at a single point in time. The VSAb 
concentration by SSAC, ELISA binding, Avidity ELISA M50 (Molarity of 
ammonium thiocyanate resulting in disruption of 50% of maximum binding), 
ICT potencies and in vivo results appropriately reflect the VSAb concentration 
of the -VipH, M and L IgG samples.  Despite having a lower VSAb 
concentration than any of the laboratory purified samples, ViperaVet had 
ELISA binding, Avidity ELISA M50 and ICT potencies similar to the medium 
sample and in vivo results better than the high sample.

comparing in vitro assays with in vivo PSS scores; the reason for this will be 
discussed in the next section. There was an extremely good correlation, R2 > 
0.8, between all results, notably between PSSs and all four in vitro assays 
results (R2 >0.97).  
4.5 Discussion 
This, as far as is known, is the first study to compare results of in vitro and in 
vivo assays for samples derived from the same pool of donors, which contain 
different VSAb  concentrations. Each pool of raw antisera was purified using 
the same small-scale manufacturing process, and was carried out in as sterile 
a manner as possible in laboratory conditions. 
FPLC showed that all samples had a purity of >95%, each with a small higher 
MW peak, most likely to be IgM and/or aggregates.  Further identification of 
this peak is not within the scope of this project. 
Immunoblots showed that VSAb composition was similar in all three samples, 
demonstrating a quantitative rather than qualitative immune response. 
As expected, ELISA and SSAC demonstrated different VSAb concentrations 
of the samples.  
Avidity ELISA showed that the higher the VSAb concentration, the greater the 
molarity of ammonium thiocyanate required to disrupt 50% of venom/ 
antivenom binding, thus demonstrating that a higher VSAb response also 
produces antibodies with greater avidity. 
Immunocytotoxicity assays also demonstrated that the CPE of V. berus venom 
was effectively neutralised by all three samples. The -VipL IgG sample only 
demonstrated a maximum neutralisation of 70% (at a 1:10 dilution), but its raw 
antiserum did achieve 100% neutralisation. The raw antisera and purified -
VipM and -VipH samples demonstrated fluctuation of CPE at the lowest 
dilutions; briefly, it represents the summation of growth promoting effects and 
lethal CPE of low venom concentrations. Possible reasons for this are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. 
The WHO recommended in vivo murine lethality test  median effective dose 
(ED50) - is considered the gold standard assay used to demonstrate 
antivenom efficacy (WHO, 2010).  The aim of this project is to implement the 
3Rs into these assays.  To perform full ED50s on the three purified samples 
plus the GMP manufactured ViperaVet would have required a minimum of 80 
mice, in reality, more than 100.  Our modified ED50 required 40 mice, a saving 
of greater than 50%. The dose of IgG selected was 1xED50 of ViperaVet, the 
value of this batch having been demonstrated in an earlier assay.  Previous 
experience has established that aggregates tend to form using ovine IgG 
products at higher antivenom and venom concentrations and for this reason a 
dose of 2.5 times the V. berus venom LD50s was used.  
The combination of survival and pathology scores as a measure of severity of 
envenomation is well illustrated in this study.  The -VipM group had a 
relatively low pathology score, but relatively high survival score.  The 
combination of scores differentiated between -VipH, -VipM and -VipL 
VSAb concentration samples. The ViperaVet control performed better than 
any of the laboratory purified samples, having lower survival and pathology 
scores as well as death rate.  These results were not included in the 
comparison with other in vitro assays because manufacturing processes were 
not identical. It would appear to be very likely that the laboratory manufactured 
samples contained some endotoxins, which may have produced an adverse 
result.  It is a salutary lesson in the importance of GMP in antivenom 
production, and the presence of endotoxins may well explain the high 
proportion of adverse reactions seen after administration of some AVs. It 
would have been interesting to have tested the laboratory samples for 
endotoxins using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test (WHO, 2010a). 
Two misinjections occurred, when the mice failed to receive their full dose of 
venom/antivenom.  When the identity of the mice was revealed it became 
apparent that both mice were from the -VipM group, and the data from these 
mice was not included. This study has shown that mice which die rapidly after 
venom/antivenom injection generally show signs of ventricular myocardial 
haemorrhage, with a greater proportion of mice in the -VipL groups suffering 
myocardial haemorrhage.  Mice surviving longer demonstrated signs of 
cardiac failure, such as congestion of the lungs and other major organs. Mice 
surviving for several hours also suffered intestinal haemorrhage. 
In summary, all five assays performed were able to demonstrate binding or 
neutralisation of V. berus venom, and to differentiate between samples 
containing different VSAb concentrations.  The most significant finding of this 
study is the high correlation of results between different assays, most 
importantly between in vitro and in vivo assays. There were only three different 
VSAb concentrations, so only three points on the comparison between purified 
IgG in vitro vs in vivo.

Figure 4.5-3 demonstrates the correlation between ELISA with ICT assays (A 
and B) and in vivo pathology-survival score (PSS) with the four in vitro assays 
(C, D, E & F). All four in vivo vs in vitro assays showed a convincing linear 
correlation.  
ELISA is widely used to measure antibodies (as well as antigen or antigen/AB 
complexes). It can be used to screen large numbers of samples, and the 
process can be automated.  However, it involves multiple steps, which may be 
temperature sensitive, and therefore potentially a problem in the tropics or 
laboratories which are not climatically controlled, resulting in a coefficient of 
variation in excess of 10% in all but the most experienced operators 
(MicroPharm data). The secondary antibody used needs to be specific for the 
antibody fragment and species from which it is derived. 
SSAC produces a result in g/L, is robust and reproducible (MicroPharm, 
unpublished data and Harrison, 2004), with a coefficient of variation of 3.5% 
(MicroPharm data). The chromatography column can be used to detect 
antibodies and their fragments from any snake species, without the need for a 
specific secondary antibody, and can be re-used multiple times (over 80 runs 
 Harrison, 2004). However, the assay, which can be mechanized, is not as 
suitable as ELISA for screening multiple samples, although several columns 
can be run simultaneously.   
Immunocytotoxicity assays produced considerable variation within and 
between assays (See chapter 8). Cells are living entities and may therefore be 
an indicator of neutralizing efficacy of antibodies to toxins which exert their 
effect via receptors or by damaging the cell membrane.  Cell culture facilities 
are expensive to set up and maintain, and considerable expertise is required 
to successfully maintain cells in culture.   
4.5.1 Conclusions 
The results of this section of the project achieved the objective of 
demonstrating a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo results, but these 
results only apply to the venom studied and the antibodies raised against it.   
Several other studies have already demonstrated such a correlation between 
ED50s and ELISA (Theakston et al, 1979), insensate hen egg assay-
haemorrhagic viper venoms only (Sells 2001), VSAb concentration by SSAC 
(MicroPharm, unpublished data) and ICT assays (Nalbantsoy et al, 2012). In 
conclusion, these results suggest that each batch of antivenom manufactured 
need not undergo in vivo lethality testing, provided that in vivo efficacy is 
unequivocally established, and that the criteria listed in the introduction are 
met, i.e. consistent starting material (antiserum from the same pool of 
individuals) and a robust, fixed manufacturing process.  
On the basis of these results, the recommendation is that a validated in vitro 
assay is performed on a sample of each batch of antivenom to monitor VSAb 
concentration.  If there is any deviation from the normal range, any change in 
starting material or manufacturing process, then an ED50 should be performed 
to confirm or refute in vivo antivenom efficacy of that batch. 
Chapter 5. Refinement: Analgesia 
5.1 Objectives 
Refinement refers to the reduction of pain, suffering and distress experienced 
by the subjects of the WHO-recommended protocols for murine lethality 
assays of snake venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy. In this chapter I 
present the results of work undertaken to establish whether the introduction of 
effective analgesia to alleviate pain is an effective refinement that does not 
affect the biological or statistical validity of the assay. 
The final objective is to inform antivenom manufacturers and researchers of 
the results and, if the first objective is achieved, to encourage incorporation of 
analgesia into routine venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy testing. 
This chapter will be confined to the alleviation of pain  Chapter 6 will address 
HEPs and other refinements to these assays. 
5.2 Introduction 
Pain can be defined as an unpleasant sensation occurring in varying degrees 
of severity as a consequence of injury, disease or emotional disorder. Pain is 
a major symptom of many envenomed snakebite victims, both human and 
animal, a notable exception being those bitten by kraits (Ariaratnam et al, 
2008). Treatment protocols for snakebite include analgesics, such as 
paracetamol or mild opiates (Menon et al, 2016; WHO 2010b, Warrell, 1999). 
Despite this, protocols for the murine lethality tests of snake venom 
characterisation and antivenom efficacy do not include routine use of 
analgesia. Here, the objective is to implement this refinement into these 
assays and to validate these modifications.  
Achieving this objective requires a system to measure the alleviation of pain 
using analgesics. However, pain response in animals is not a simple reflex 
and the resulting behaviours are species-specific.  In order to assess analgesic 
efficacy, accurate methods of measuring pain and distress need to be 
employed. When assessing pain and distress in test subjects a researcher 
must have an in-depth knowledge of normal species-specific behaviours, as 
well as the observational skills required to appreciate when these behaviours 
deviate from the norm.   
5.2.1 Pain assessment 
The assessment of pain in both animals and humans tends to be subjective 
and, in the case of animals often based on anthropomorphic assumptions.  
There is therefore a need to have a robust and reproducible method of pain 
assessment in laboratory animals to ensure that claimed refinements can 
accurately be evaluated (Flecknell, 1994).  Historically, the efficacy of 
analgesia has been tested by inducing pain using mechanical, thermal or 
chemical stimuli and measuring a drugs ability to suppress the test animals 
reflex response; for example the writhing test (Botting et al, 2005) and licking 
a hind paw injected with an irritant (Hunskar et al, 1985).  Other methods 
examine responses involving conscious perception of pain via the thalamus 
and cortex (Bianchi et al, 1954). 
5.2.1.1 Facial Expressions: 
The mouse grimace scale (MGS) score was recently developed (Langford et 
al, 2010; Mogil, 2010), based on a facial scoring system, to assess pain in 
children too young to verbally express their suffering (Lee, 2002).  Facial 
grimace has since been adopted both by researchers and clinicians to assess 
pain in laboratory and domestic animals (Leach et al, 2012; Matsumiya et al, 
2012; Sotocinal et al, 2011; Holden et al, 2014; Dalla Costa et al, 2014) and it 
has been adopted for the purposes of this work to incorporate analgesia into 
venom LD50s and antivenom ED50s. The MGS score is described in detail in 
Section 2.10.1 (Chapter 2A). 
5.2.1.2  Behavioural analysis: 
The absence of certain behaviours such as nest building, grooming, 
exploration and rearing, or the presence of abnormal behaviours, such as 
abdominal press, limping or chewing at the painful area, may be used to 
assess pain.   
Perception of pain in mice can be affected by genotype, sex, stress (stress 
induced analgesia), behaviour immediately prior to receiving a noxious 
stimulus and social interactions (Mogil, 2007), whilst another study revealed 
that pain and analgesia are heritable traits in both humans and mice (Lariviere 
et al, 2010). To reduce variables in preclinical tests all mice are male and of 
the same (CD1) strain. 
5.2.1.3 Physiological parameters: 
The identification of biochemical or physiological indications of pain and 
distress would allow quantitative evaluation of methods employed to alleviate 
suffering (Flecknell, 1994). However, the large number of factors influencing 
these physiological parameters render them unreliable as objective measures 
of pain (Flecknell, 1999) at this time.  
5.2.2 Analgesia 
For the purposes of this study, analgesics can be divided into two broad 
groups, namely non-opiates, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), and opiates. Paracetamol is the drug of choice for the relief of pain 
in human snakebite victims.  For severe pain opiates may be administered 
with the caveat that, in humans, they may cause respiratory depression and 
must therefore be used with caution if neurotoxic envenoming is suspected.  
Progress in the use of analgesia in experimental animals has been made over 
the past few years (Stokes et al, 2009).  Buprenorphine is the most commonly-
reported analgesic used post-operatively in rats and mice, and the use of 
NSAIDs has increased since 2001 (Stokes et al, 2009).  Although reported 
administration of analgesics has increased and there has been some 
refinement in the selection of anaesthetic agent used, the findings of a 
literature review (Richardson and Flecknell, 2005) suggested that there is still 
significant scope for improvement with respect to pain relief in laboratory 
rodents (Stokes et al, 2009). A number of studies have shown that pre-emptive 
use of analgesia was more effective than waiting until pain had become 
established (Woolf, 1986, Lascelles 1995). 
5.2.2.1 Opiates 
5.2.2.1.1 Buprenorphine 
The efficacy of Buprenorphine in laboratory animals is well documented 
(Matsumiya et al, 2012; Liles et al, 1992a; Liles et al 1992b). Buprenorphine 
is an opioid analgesic, with equivalent analgesic activity in humans of 0.3mg 
to 10mg morphine sulphate. It is metabolised in the liver and clearance is 
related to hepatic blood flow.  It exerts its effect by high affinity binding to mu 
() subclass opioid receptors in the CNS.  Although it is classed as a partial 
agonist, it behaves in a similar manner to classical -agonists such as 
morphine, with the unusual property of a very slow rate of dissociation from its 
receptor; which could account for its longer duration of action than morphine, 
the unpredictability of its reversal by opioid antagonists, and its low level of 
manifest clinical dependence (Reckitt Benckiser Drug Reference 
Encyclopaedia). 
Buprenorphine behaves as a full -opioid agonist for analgesia, with no ceiling 
effect, but there is a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.  The effects of 
buprenorphine can be completely reversed by naloxone.  No problems are 
encountered when switching between or combining buprenorphine and other 
opioids. Buprenorphine exhibits a pronounced anti-hyperalgesic effect that 
might indicate potential advantages in the treatment of neuropathic pain. It is 
suggested that buprenorphines opioid action is mainly at the level of the spinal 
cord, not the brain, and is different from those of fentanyl and morphine 
(Pergolizzi et al, 2010).  The pronounced anti-hyperalgesic effect of 
buprenorphine is thought to be because of its -receptor antagonism; and its 
metabolism is largely unaffected by renal insufficiency. (Pergolizzi et al, 2010). 
Severe pain in laboratory rodents is effectively treated using buprenorphine, 
and in combination with its longer duration of action (Gopal et al, 2002; Gades 
et al, 2000; Foley et al, 200; Wereszczyfiska-Siemiatkowska et al, 1987; Liles 
et al, 1993a) led to its selection as the drug of choice for this study. 
5.2.2.1.2 Morphine 
Morphine sulphate (hereafter referred to as morphine) is a pure opioid agonist 
and is relatively selective for the - receptor. It binds to the receptor producing 
changes in both neurotransmitter release and calcium uptake.  Receptors are 
located throughout the brain, spinal cord and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (Jaffe, 
1990).  
In humans the principal effect of morphine is analgesia, but it also acts 
centrally to produce anxiolysis, euphoria and feelings of relaxation. It inhibits 
the respiratory centre (brainstem), cough centre (medulla) and stimulates the 
chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), resulting in respiratory depression, cough 
suppression and centrally-induced nausea and vomiting respectively (mice are 
incapable of vomiting).  It also causes miois (pupillary constriction), even in the 
dark (Jaffe, 1990). 
In the GIT, gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions are reduced, smooth 
muscle spasm and compartmentalisation are increased but the propulsive 
peristaltic waves are inhibited.  As a result increased transit time of digesta, 
combined with increased absorption of water, contribute to the development 
of constipation.  Spasm of the sphincter of Oddi may result in increased biliary 
tract pressure and there may also be spasm of the urinary bladder sphincter 
muscle (Jaffe, 1990). Peripheral vasodilation resulting in orthostatic 
hypotension, compounded by histamine release, can occur, which may, in 
turn, cause pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating (Jaffe, 1990).  Potentially 
this could exacerbate venom toxin-induced hypotension. 
In humans, when morphine is administered orally around two thirds is 
absorbed, with maximum analgesic effect after 60 minutes.  Bioavailability is 
less than 40% due to a significant first pass hepatic metabolism.  Once 
absorbed it is distributed to skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, GIT, lungs, spleen 
and CNS, although only small quantities cross the blood-brain barrier. Around 
20-25% is reversibly bound to plasma proteins (Jaffe, 1990). 
Morphine is conjugated to glucuronide in the liver to Morphine-3- glucuronide 
(M3G) (inactive) and Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) (active, but which is not 
produced in mice).  The majority is excreted as M3G in urine, but there is minor 
enterohepatic circulation with 7-10% excreted in faecesc (Handal et al, 2002. 
In mice subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of morphine results in their 
tails going into spasm in dorsiflexion such that it is almost parallel to the spinal 
column, the Straub reaction (Straub, 1911; Bilbey et al, 1960).  This is 
accompanied by restlessness, excitability extensor rigidity of the hind-limbs, 
forcible voidance of faeces and prominence of the perineum, all of which arise 
from direct stimulation of the spinal cord. 
Morphine is undoubtedly an effective analgesic in mice, however its half-life is 
less than 2 hours and therefore frequent administration is required.  In mice 
receiving potentially haemotoxic venoms repeated injections are 
contraindicated, which makes, if viable, the use of oral morphine an attractive 
alternative. There is a dearth of information on the pharmacokinetics of oral 
morphine in mice, and for the purposes of this study it was therefore necessary 
to extrapolate from human data. There are apparently no references to dose 
of morphine given orally to mice so, given that in man approximately 50% of 
the ingested dose is absorbed, the highest published injectable dose-rate for 
mice was given (10mg/kg), with the assumption that a dose of 5mg/kg would 
be absorbed.  We hoped that by giving the equivalent of half of the maximum 
injectable dose that we would avoid inducing the hyperactivity described in the 
literature (Straub, 1911; Bilbey et al, 1960). Oral morphine is available in liquid 
form as a syrup, which the mice appeared to find palatable, therefore making 
repeated dosing practical.  Oral morphine was therefore the second analgesic 
to be investigated here. 
5.2.2.2 Non-opiates 
5.2.2.2.1 Paracetamol/acetaminophen 
Analgesia and hypothermia induced by paracetamol are mediated by inhibition 
of a cyclo-oxygenase, designated COX-3 (Botting et al, 2005).  It is ineffective 
in the relief of post-operative pain in mice (Matsumiya et al, 2012; Miller et al, 
2011), such that given the apparent severity of pain induced by envenoming, 
it would appear to be an inappropriate choice of analgesic despite being 
administered in the case of human envenoming (WHO, 2010b).  
5.2.2.2.2 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
NSAIDs are generally effective analgesics for mild to moderate pain in 
laboratory animals (Wright-Williams et al, 2007; Arras, 2007).  They can be 
divided into the cyclo-oxegenase (COX) inhibitors, which provide pain relief by 
inhibiting production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, 
prostacyclines and thromboxanes, and the centrally- acting, aniline-derived 
analgesics such as paracetamol (see above). The former lead to a smaller 
inflammatory response and thus analgesia, whilst the latter have few anti-
inflammatory properties (Liles et al, 1992b).  
NSAIDs are potentially a very useful group of analgesics and should always 
be considered when attempting to provide pain relief in laboratory animals.  
They may be used in combination with opiates, their inhibition on clotting make 
these drugs unsuitable for use in assays involving potentially anticoagulant 
venom toxins. For this reason the use of this class of drugs was not 
investigated in this study.

5.3.5 Analgesia LD50 
These experiments were conducted as described in Chapter 2 for the median 
lethal dose, analgesia being administered 30 minutes prior to venom injection. 
Initially 1x LD50 dose of venom was given, but deaths reduced the number of 
results available for statistical analysis therefore the dose was reduced to 
0.75x LD50 dose of venom. Experiments performed are summarised in Table

Only one ED50 experiment was performed using buprenorphine analgesia 
because it had become apparent that buprenorphine induced hyperactivity of 
the mice, with an associated increase in death rate. The ED50 of EchiTabPlus 
required to neutralise 2.5x LD50 of N. nigricollis venom was greater than the 
maximum allowable injection volume, therefore 1x LD50 of venom was used 
with the equivalent reduction in antivenom dose. 
5.3.7 Dose response studies 
5.3.7.1 Buprenorphine 
An initial dose response study was performed to establish the effect of 
buprenorphine alone on the mice. The experimental design is summarised in 
Table 5.3-4. On Day 1 the mice were injected with one of 3 doses of 
buprenorphine or an equivalent volume of saline, and observations performed 
every 30 minutes for 2 hours. The experiment was repeated on Day 2 to 
ascertain whether heating the mice affected their response to buprenorphine. 
The mice were injected with buprenorphine, a set of background observations 
performed and then their cage was placed under an infrared heat lamp. 
Observations were then performed as for Day 1.

A second dose response study was performed using 45 mice in total (six

experimental design is summarised in Table 5.3-5. Observations were made 
as described previously and post mortem examinations performed at the end 
of the experiment.

5.3.7.2 Morphine Sulfate 
A dose response study was conducted using two doses of morphine analgesia 
on mice envenomed with 0.75 x LD50 N. nigricollis venom and an equal number 
of non-envenomed mice. Each mouse was injected with a standard dose of 
morphine sulphate (5mg/kg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to i.v. injection 
of venom or an equal volume of PBS.  Three hours after the initial morphine 
dose the mice were given one of two additional doses of oral morphine.  
Routine observations were made, including post mortem examinations.  
The rationale for this experimental design was to investigate whether 
additional dosing with oral morphine affected outcome of envenomed mice or 
behaviour of non-envenomed mice. There was a particular concern that higher 
doses of morphine may cause hyperactivity, as described in the literature 
(Straub, 1911; Bilbey et al, 1960).  An elapid venom was used because the 
neurotoxic components of its venom was more likely to interact with a centrally 
acting opiate than a non-neurotoxic viper venom.  In this experiment, the initial 
dose of morphine was injected to ensure that each mouse received an initial 
dose of morphine equivalent to the selected oral dose.  Although the mice were 
generally willing to take their medication, there were some which did not 
swallow all of their computed dose. 
5.3.8 Venom dose response 
This experiment was designed to investigate analgesic efficacy at different 
doses of venom. An analgesic LD50, using three different doses of V. berus 
venom, was performed on mice with and without buprenorphine analgesia 
(Table 5.3-6). This experiment was performed to see if venom dose affected 
the efficacy of buprenorphine analgesia.

5.3.9 Statistical analysis 
Mean MGS, activity and pathology-survival scores were calculated and plotted 
with error bars showing 95% confidence intervals (CI), and a Student t-test 
employed to determine statistical significance.  Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival 
analysis was performed to determine whether administration of analgesia 
affected survival rates. To maximise the power of the statistical analyses 
performed on the resulting data, the results were pooled for all venoms. 
5.4 Results 
5.4.1 Baseline effects of analgesia (no venom) 
Buprenorphine 
Mice were given analgesia without venom to identify whether analgesia 
induced behaviours which might be confused with those behaviours resulting 
from envenomation. As the dose rate for mice quoted in the literature varies 
quite considerably, different doses were administered (1.0 to 2.0mg/kg) to 
establish the optimum dose exhibiting maximum analgesic effect without 
inducing adverse behavioural effects. Activity was measured by counting the 
number of behaviours (e.g. exploring, grooming, eating, rearing) in 30 
seconds. 
The saline treated mice became less active with time, probably due to 
becoming familiar with their environment.  Mice are nocturnal animals and 
prefer to sleep during the day.  The reduction in activity of the buprenorphine 
treated mice was significantly less than the controls (student t-test, p<0.05).  
There was no change in activity when the buprenorphine-treated mice were 
heated. The results are illustrated in Figure 5.4-1 
The buprenorphine treated mice exhibited almost manic feeding behaviour 
and seemed more active than the saline treated mice.  In the second 
buprenorphine experiment the mice were given a dose of 2mg/kg on Day 1 
(no venom). The mice appeared hyperactive therefore were given the lower 
dose of 1.5mg/kg on Day 2 prior to venom injection. 
The statistical analysis performed (student t-test, unless otherwise stated) on 
the results presented in this chapter can be found in the chapter supplement.

Morphine 
At this later stage in the project, activity measurements were changed to count 
the number of distinct head movements made by each mouse in 30 seconds. 
It was noted that some mice were stationary, but looked around, taking an 
interest in their surroundings, whilst the worst affected mice did not even move 
their heads. Counting head movements differentiated the severity of suffering 
between these two groups of mice. Mice treated with oral morphine remained 
active throughout the study period and their activity score remained within the 
mean and 2x standard deviation of activity score prior to administration of 
morphine.  A second dose was given two hours after the first, and the activity 
score remained within normal limits (Figure 5.4-2).  
5.4.2 Analgesia dose response studies 
5.4.2.1 Buprenorphine 
Two different doses of buprenorphine were given to mice envenomed with two 
different viper venoms that exhibit distinct pathological lesions to determine 
whether analgesia was equally effective at controlling pain under these 
differing conditions.  As higher dose rates were being used, it is possible that 
a ceiling effect had been attained at the lower dose rate. Again, the same 
mice were used on consecutive days with the same doses of buprenorphine 
thus acting as their own non-envenomed controls. 
MGS scores were significantly lower at all time points in mice that had been 
envenomed with E. ocellatus venom and dosed with 1.0 mg/kg buprenorphine 
than the control mice. Those mice which had received 1.5mg/kg 
buprenorphine and E. ocellatus venom only had an MGS score significantly 
lower than controls at 90 and 120 minutes (Figure 5.4-3A). Mice envenomed 
with B. arietans venom had MGS scores significantly lower (student t-test, 
p<0.05) than control mice at both doses of buprenorphine, 1.5mg/kg being 
more effective than 1.0mg/kg (Figure 5.4-3B). 
Figure 5.4-3: The effect of buprenorphine (1.5 or 1mg/kg) on mean MGS score of mice 
injected with E. ocellatus venom (A) or B. arietans venom (B)  
Activity score did not appear to be dose-responsive in mice that had received 
no venom or those which had received either intravenous E. ocellatus venom 
or B. arietans venom. However, there was a statistically significant (student t-
test, p<0.05) increase in activity score at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post 
buprenorphine injection in both non-envenomed (Figure 5.4-4A and Figure 
5.4-5A) and envenomed mice (Figure 5.4-4B and Figure 5.4-5B).

Figure 5.4-5: The effect of buprenorphine (1.5 or 1mg/kg) on the activity of mice injected 
with B. arietans venom (B) or no venom (PBS) (A) 
The relationship between activity and MGS scores was examined using a 
scatterplot.  When the data from all the mice was pooled, R2 was 0.45 (see 
supplement; slide 5), but when only buprenorphine-treated envenomed mice 
were included, R2 was 0.77 (Figure 5.4-6). The anomaly in these results 
probably reflects the number of other variables, in particular, the fact that MGS 
score can only be between 0 and 2, and that activity score cannot be less than 
zero and has to have a maximum value.

There did not appear to be any significant difference in pathology-survival

There were, however, twice as many deaths in the group of mice injected with 
E. ocellatus venom and 1.0mg/kg buprenorphine (Figure 5.4-8), but no 
observable difference between death rate for buprenorphine treated and 
untreated mice in mice injected with B. arietans venom. 
Morphine 
The dose response study for morphine analgesia was designed to identify 
possible toxic effects of subsequent dosing with oral morphine.  To ensure all 
mice got their initial dose of morphine, it was injected intraperitoneally prior to 
envenomation or by i.v. injection of PBS (controls). Three hours after the initial 
morphine dose, the mice were topped up with one of 2 doses of oral morphine 
and monitored for a further 150 minutes. In this experiment a neurotoxic (for 
mice) elapid venom was used because interaction between opioid analgesics 
and neurotoxins is more likely than with non-neurotoxic viper venoms. The 
experimental design is shown in Table 5.4-1

5.4.3 Analgesia in LD50 assays 
5.4.3.1 Buprenorphine 
Two groups of 10 mice were assigned to each treatment group, one receiving 
buprenorphine intraperitoneally, and the controls given an equal volume of 
normal saline by the same route, approximately 30 minutes prior to i.v. 
injection of one of the 5 test venoms and observations were regularly 
performed. After 3 hours, the surviving mice were recovering and there was 
no discernable difference between groups.  
Results are shown in Table 5.4-2. In all tables in this chapter, n indicates the 
number of mice from which data was obtained.  Deaths before the end of the 
experiment resulted in a reduction of numbers from which data could be 
obtained (i.e. where n=<10).

Buprenorphine administration effectively reduced MGS scores in mice 
envenomed with viper venoms (example Figure 5.4-11A), but not those 
envenomed with elapid venoms (example Figure 5.4-12A).  
Figure 5.4-11: The effect of buprenorphine (1.5mg/Kg) on MGS score and 
pathology/survival of mice injected with E. ocellatus venom, selected as an example of 
a viper. The results for mice envenomed with the other viper venoms studied can be 
found in the Chapter supplement. 
PS scores of control mice were lower than those of buprenorphine treated 
mice except for those injected with E. ocellatus venom (Figure 5.4-11B).

be found in the Chapter supplement. 
5.4.3.2 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
The survival time data was pooled from all the venoms studied and analysed 
using Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis; this non-parametric statistical 
analysis estimates the probability of death and effectiveness of medication.  
Here the KM survival analysis is used to determine any statistically significant 
differences in death rates between analgesia-treated and control mice.  
In the case of buprenorphine, there was a statistically higher probability 
(p<0.05) of death in treated vs untreated mice (Table 5.4-3 and Figure 5.4-4). 
Table 5.4-3: KM survival analysis of 
envenomed mice treated with 
buprenorphine. 0 = no analgesia; 1 = 
buprenorphine analgesia. 
Figure 5.4-13: KM survival analysis of 
envenomed mice treated with 
buprenorphine. As deaths occur, 
cumulative survival falls. 
5.4.3.3 Morphine 
Experiments were carried out as above, except the treated mice were given 
oral morphine prior to venom injection. Mice were topped up after 3 hours if 
their MGS score and/or behaviour indicated undue suffering. In reality, most 
of the mice had started to recover or had completely recovered after 3 hours. 
The effect of oral morphine on MGS score is shown in Table 5.4-4, Figure 
5.4-14A and Figure 5.4-15A; on activity score in Table 5.4-5, Figure 5.4-14B 
and Figure 5.4-15B. 
Figure 5.4-14: The effect of oral morphine (10mg/Kg) on MGS and activity scores of 
mice injected with E. ocellatus venom (viper). 
Mice envenomed with any of the five venoms studied showed a significant 
reduction of MGS scores, increased activity scores but, no significant 
difference in pathology/survival score. Examples of the results are illustrated 
for a viper (E. ocellatus venom - Figure 5.4-14) and an elapid (D. angusticeps 
venom - Figure 5.4-15), the complete result set can be found in the chapter 
supplement.

There were some discrepancies in death rate with different venoms, more 
deaths occurring in morphine treated mice envenomed with E. ocellatus 
venom and D. angusticeps venom, but fewer deaths in those envenomed with 
B. arietans venom, V. berus venom and N. nigricollis venom (Table 5.4-6, 
Figure 5.4-16 and Figure 5.4-17).  This led to concerns whether administration 
of morphine may affect the assay results.

5.4.3.4 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed on results pooled from all 
venoms, as described above.  In this case, the results showed that predicted 
survival times were not significantly different (p<0.05) in morphine-treated or 
control mice.  The results are illustrated in Table 5.4-7 and Figure 5.4-18. 
Table 5.4-7: Kaplan Meier survival

or oral morphine. 0 = no analgesia; 1 = 
oral morphine analgesia. 
Figure 5.4-18: Kaplan Meier survival 
analysis of envenomed mice treated with 
or oral morphine. 
Considered collectively, these results showed no difference in death rate when 
the experimental results using all venoms studied were pooled; ten mice per 
group being insufficient to perform the KM survival analysis for individual 
venoms.  Therefore the number of mice employed in experiments using 
venoms for which there were discrepancies in death rates between morphine 
treated and untreated control mice was increased. The analgesia LD50 
experiments using E. ocellatus venom, B. arietans venom, V. berus venom 
and D. angusticeps venom, using 30 mice per experimental group, were 
repeated. 
Figure 5.4-19: The effect of morphine analgesia on death rate of mice envenomed with 
E. ocellatus venom (EoV), B. arietans venom (BaV), V. berus venom (VbV) or D. 
angusticeps venom (DaV) 
The results show that there were fewer deaths in the morphine-treated than in 
control mice envenomed with V. berus venom, and more deaths in morphine-
treated than control mice, envenomed with D. angusticeps venom. KM 
analysis revealed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between 
survival of morphine-treated or control mice envenomed with E. ocellatus or 
B. arietans venoms (Table 5.4-8 A and B). 
Table 5.4-8: Kaplan Meier survival analysis of mice envenomed with E. ocellatus (A); B. 
arietans (B); V. berus (C) or D. angusticeps (D) venoms comparing morphine analgesia 
with untreated subjects. There were 30 mice in each treatment group. 
However, the mean survival time for morphine-treated mice envenomed with 
V. berus venom was within the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the control 
mice, but that of the control mice was lower than the lower 95% CI value for 
morphine-treated mice (Table 5.4-8C). The mean survival time for morphine-
treated mice envenomed with D. angusticeps venom was lower than the lower 
95% CI of control mice, but that of the control mice was within the 95% CIs of 
the morphine-treated mice (Table 5.4-8D); i.e. the results were inconclusive 
where p<0.05. The KM analysis plots are illustrated in Figure 5.4-20 
Figure 5.4-20: Kaplan Meier survival analysis plots for analgesic venom LD50s 
comparing survival of morphine-treated versus control mice. N=30 for each 
experimental group. 
5.4.3.5 Analgesia in LD50 assays  the effect of variant venom doses on 
the analgesic benefits of buprenorphine 
An experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of 
buprenorphine at different venom doses. Regular preclinical testing of 
antivenoms directed against V. berus venom is carried out by the ARVRU, 
therefore to minimise the number of mice required, this experiment was carried 
out in conjunction with a routine LD50 for this venom. Three different doses of 
venom were chosen and the experiment conducted as for the other analgesia 
LD50s described above.    
The MGS score was less in mice treated with buprenorphine compared to 
untreated controls at all three venom doses (Figure 5.4-21). PSS was 
significantly higher in the buprenorphine-treated mice (at 90%CI), as was the 
death rate in treated groups (Figure 5.4-22). Interestingly, deaths at the lower 
venom doses were HEPs due to hyphaema, enlargement of the eye(s) as the 
result of haemorrhage into the orbit(s), and occurred several hours after 
envenomation.

5.4.4 Analgesia in ED50 assays 
These experiments were performed to determine: 
 the pain-relieving benefits of analgesia in ED50 assays 
 whether administration of analgesia affected the metric of the ED50 
results 
5.4.4.1 Buprenorphine 
Only one venom/antivenom combination, V. berus venom with ViperaTab 
antivenom, was performed using buprenorphine analgesia for the reasons 
stated in the experiment of Section 1.4.3.5. The experiment was not repeated 
using the other venom/antivenom combinations because, by this time, it had 
become obvious that administration of buprenorphine was affecting the metric 
of the LD50 assays, with the buprenorphine-treated groups having a 
significantly higher death rate (p<0.05) than the untreated controls, using KM 
survival analysis.  In addition, buprenorphine appeared to be ineffective at 
relieving the pain and suffering associated with elapid envenomation.  
In the ED50 experiment that was performed, it was shown that buprenorphine 
administration reduced the mean MGS score (Figure 5.4-23A) whilst activity 
scores (Figure 5.4-23B) were higher than in control mice, thus demonstrating 
that analgesia is effective.  There were no deaths in either group and the PSS 
was not significantly different (Figure 5.4-24). The full set of results can be 
found in the chapter supplement in Table 5. These results did not show the 
increased lethality in the buprenorphine treated group, but it would appear that 
the antivenom in this experiment had completely neutralised the lethal effects 
of the venom. The buprenorphine treated mice were more active prior to 
venom injection than the controls (p<0.05), potentially resulting in a higher 
death rates in groups where the antivenom dose did not completely neutralise 
venom lethality.

ViperaTab antivenom. 
5.4.4.2 Morphine 
Having determined that buprenorphine did not satisfy the criteria for an 
acceptable analgesic to use in the preclinical assays of venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy, and having shown morphine to be an acceptable 
alternative in LD50 assays, ED50s were performed on all five of our selected 
venom/antivenom combinations using this analgesic. 
All the venom/antivenom combinations showed a reduction in mean MGS 
score (Table 5.4-9), examples are illustrated in Figure 5.4-25A and Figure 
5.4-26A. There was an inverse relationship between MGS and activity scores, 
the morphine treated mice showing greater activity than the controls at each 
time point (Table 5.4-10), examples are given in Figure 5.4-25B and Figure 
5.4-26B. One viper venom and one elapid venom and their homologous 
antivenoms were selected here; the two venoms which showed differences in 
estimated survival times using KM survival analysis. 
All the graphs illustrating these results can be found in the chapter supplement.

significant difference (p<0.05) in estimated survival time (Table 5.4-11).

5.4.5 Preclinical testing  A retrospective analysis of outcome of full 
LD50/ED50 assays between morphine-treated and untreated mice 
Previous analgesic LD50s and ED50s used only one dose of venom and 
antivenom, but preclinical assays of antivenom efficacy (PCT) use a variety of 
venom/antivenom doses, including one group of all deaths; it was necessary 
to ensure that giving analgesia did not affect the overall outcome of the 
experiment.  Experimental PCT data from the ARVRU archives were 
compared with recent data when analgesia was implemented into the routine 
preclinical testing (PCT) of ViperaTab (VPT) antivenom.  This involved both 
full V. berus venom LD50 (Table 5.4-13) as well as the antivenom ED50 (Table 
5.4-14).  
Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed and showed no significant 
difference in predicted survival time for the LD50s (Figure 5.4-29A), but 
significantly longer survival and fewer deaths in the morphine-treated ED50 
groups (Figure 5.4-29B). This may have been due to the mismatch of venom 
dose given to the mice (Table 5.4-14).  However, the results of the two ED50s 
were well within the normal range for ViperaTab antivenom (MicroPharm, 
unpublished data).

The results, using retrospective comparison of morphine analgesia versus no 
analgesia in the PCT of ViperaTab antivenom, caused concern that the use of 
analgesia affected the outcome of the assay. To address this concern, 
venom/antivenom combinations representing two vipers and an elapid venom 
family were selected, and subject numbers increased to 30 per group, as 
described in Section 5.4.3.3. It was shown that there was no significant 
difference between death rate of morphine-treated groups and the untreated 
controls (Figure 5.4-30).

5.5 Discussion 
The WHO recommended murine tests of venom LD50 and antivenom ED50 
inflict considerable pain, distress and suffering on their subjects. As stated in 
Chapter 1, it is estimated that in excess of 30,000 mice are used annually in 
these assays. Testing antivenom efficacy is essential to avoid clinical failure 
of antivenom where mortality due to snakebite increased from 1.8% to 12.1% 
after the introduction of an ineffective antivenom (Visser et al., 2008). This is 
believed to be the first project in which the major focus has been to minimise 
the pain, distress and suffering inflicted on the subjects of these assays, 
although use of analgesia has been included in assay protocol, but its efficacy 
was not recorded (Chacon et al, 2015) 
5.5.1 Pain assessment 
5.5.1.1 MGS score 
The first hurdle was a reproducible, objective method of assessing pain in 
mice, therefore allowing the benefit, or otherwise, of analgesic intervention to 
be assessed.  A system of scoring facial grimace was adopted by Mogil, 2010 
(MGS Manual) and by Langford et al., 2010. Photographs were taken, cropped 
so that only the face was visible and then scored according to the manual. 
Scoring was performed by the author throughout the study.  To assess MGS 
consistency, a selection of 20 photos were circulated amongst both 
experienced animal technicians and other in vivo researchers for scoring.  As 
expected, there was considerable variation in scoring, but there was 
agreement as to which mice were experiencing most pain and those 
experiencing the least discomfort.   
5.5.1.2 Activity 
Initial experiments relied on MGS scoring alone, but when it became apparent 
that buprenorphine analgesia induced hyperactivity (see below) a system of 
activity scoring was developed. A video recording of 30 seconds duration was 
made and the number of head movements of each individual during that period 
was counted  this differentiated between mice taking no interest in their 
surroundings and those which remained immobile but which took an interest 
in their surroundings. It was subsequently observed that activity score showed 
an inverse relationship to MGS score, which might reasonably be expected, 
given that the less pain experienced, the more normal activity is displayed.  
Subsequently a combination of MGS and activity scores were used as a more 
objective/ less subjective measurement of pain. 
5.5.2 Analgesics 
5.5.2.1 Buprenorphine 
Buprenorphine has been shown to be effective at reducing severe pain in 
laboratory rodents (Gopal et al, 2002; Gades et al, 2000; Foley et al, 2001; 
Wereszczyfiska-Siemiatkowska et al, 1987; Liles and Flecknell, 1993a) and 
has a half-life sufficient for effective analgesia to last for a 6 hour assay. 
However, it was noticed that mice treated with doses sufficient to relieve the 
pain of envenomation induced hyperactivity, including manic feeding 
behaviour.  Analysis of results using Kaplan-Meier survival showed a 
significant increase in death rate of treated compared to control mice, when 
the results from all venoms studied were pooled.  In addition, although 
buprenorphine appeared to be effective in reducing MGS score in mice 
envenomed with viper venoms, there was no reduction in MGS score in those 
envenomed with elapid venoms.  It was therefore concluded that 
buprenorphine was not a suitable analgesic to use in these assays. 
5.5.2.2 Morphine 
Morphine is regarded as the gold standard opiate for pain relief, but is 
rarely used in laboratory animals due to its short half-life (less than 2 hours).  
Repeated injections are to be avoided in mice envenomed with coagulopathic 
venoms as this could potentially induce haemorrhage and therefore impact on 
the results of the experiment.  The previous professional veterinary experience 
of the author of using liquid oral morphine in rodents indicated that it was 
effective, and could be administered with the minimum of restraint. No 
reference to the use of oral morphine in laboratory animals could be found, so 
the maximum recommended injectable dose (10mg/kg) was decided upon. 
Mice were topped up with a further dose (10mg/kg) every 2 hours or as 
required.  Generally the mice appeared to find oral morphine palatable, but 
there were a small number of mice who resisted attempts to dose them  these 
were usually the mice who subsequently had a higher MGS score and required 
further dosing later in the experiment. Palatability could also be improved by 
adding fruit juice or undiluted squash, such as Ribena to the morphine 
solution. Mice given oral morphine alone showed no change in activity despite 
reports in the literature of hyperactivity and a characteristic dorsiflexion of their 
tails  the Straub phenomenon - following injection of morphine sulphate 
(Straub, 1911; Bilbey et al, 1960).   
Potential side-effects of opiates include hyperactivity with the Straub reaction, 
hypotension, respiratory depression, drowsiness, GIT stasis with constipation 
and spasm of both the sphincters of Oddi and the bladder.  Hyperactivity was 
apparent in the buprenorphine treated mice, but not in those dosed with oral 
morphine or injected with 5mg/kg morphine sulphate.  Some buprenorphine-
treated mice demonstrated the Straub phenomenon.  It was postulated that 
the higher death rate in buprenorphine treated mice was related to 
hyperactivity and consequently more rapid distribution of venom toxins or the 
enhancement of venom-toxin induced hypotension. This was particularly 
noticeable following B. arietans envenomation, after which all the mice 
underwent a period of slumping, presumably due to profound hypotension, not 
reversed by antivenom. After about 30 minutes the surviving mice began to 
recover with few subsequent deaths and complete recovery after 3 hours.  
Post mortem examination showed little difference between opiate treated mice 
and controls except that, particularly in buprenorphine treated mice, there was 
a higher incidence of dilated bladders.  Both the morphine and buprenorphine 
treated mice tended to have somewhat more congested organs than control 
mice, but this was a pathological feature of many of the venoms studied and 
therefore it was difficult to quantify the difference between treated and 
untreated mice. 
5.5.3 Dose Response  
Having established that oral morphine was largely effective, with the caveat 
that a minority of mice did not receive their full dose and therefore had 
insufficient analgesia, it was decided to give the initial dose by injection. In the 
dose response study, an injected dose of 5mg/kg was chosen, assuming 
bioavailability of 40-50% of the oral dose.  The Straub effect was not observed 
in any of the mice, and activity did not appear to be affected by the selected 
dose.  A second dose of morphine was administered orally 3 hours after the 
first dose and observations for any signs of hyperactivity or toxicity performed.  
In the control mice, which were injected with PBS instead of venom, there was 
no significant difference in MGS score, activity score or surface temperature, 
nor in pathology-survival score (PSS), although there was slight but 
insignificant trend upwards with increasing doses of Oramorph.  In the venom 
treated mice there was a noticeable reduction in MGS score but no significant 
change in activity score or surface temperature with increasing doses of 
Oramorph. There was no difference in PSS between the 10 and 15 mg/kg dose 
groups. From this experiment it can be concluded that a dose of 5mg/kg 
morphine sulphate can be injected into mice without causing a significant 
increase in activity and that this dose can be topped up with up to 15 mg/kg 
oral morphine without adverse effects. 
5.5.4 Analgesic LD50s and ED50s 
Results of the LD50 and ED50 experiments showed that MGS scores were 
significantly reduced (P<0.05) and activity scores significantly increased 
(P<0.05) in morphine-treated mice when compared to controls in all five 
venoms studied, as well as those pre-incubated with their homologous 
antivenoms. Unlike buprenorphine, oral morphine appeared to be effective at 
reducing MGS scores in mice envenomed with D. angusticeps venom, despite 
the ptosis observed in these subjects.  
There was a significantly smaller reduction in activity following envenomation 
of morphine treated mice, compared to controls, without the hyperactivity and 
manic feeding behaviour observed in mice treated with buprenorphine. 
There was no significant difference in pathology-survival score (PSS) between 
morphine-treated and untreated mice.  When group sizes were increased, 
there were small, but significant differences (P<0.05) between estimated 
survival time for some venom groups, but not for any of the venom/antivenom 
combinations studied.  
These results would suggest that oral morphine is effective at reducing pain in 
mice envenomed with a variety of venoms, with or without their antivenoms 
and that there are only marginally significant effects on the outcome of the 
experiment in terms of pathology or deaths. These results highlight the 
potential differences in interaction of any additional substances (analgesics) 
administered with variable venom toxin profiles, and the need to define these 
prior to incorporation into the LD50 and ED50 assays. 
5.5.5 Preclinical testing of antivenoms 
Validation of commercial regulatory assays would require duplicate 
experiments to be performed in which doses administered to analgesia-treated 
groups were matched exactly with untreated control groups.  This experiment 
has been performed using Tramadol analgesia in mice envenomed 
intraperitoneally with Bothrops asper venom (Chacon et al, 2015).  There was 
no significant difference between the ED50s of the two groups of mice, but no 
attempt was made to confirm the efficacy of the analgesia administered.  
As the result of the outcome of this project, the ARVRU has introduced 
morphine analgesia into routine preclinical testing of venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy. Ideally duplicate experiments should have been run 
simultaneously, but to reduce the numbers of mice required, a retrospective 
comparison was performed, as described in Section 5.4.5. 
5.5.6 Recommended Analgesia 
It can be concluded that, although effective at reducing pain scores in mice 
envenomed with a variety of Viperid venoms, Buprenorphine administration 
appears to be ineffective at reducing pain scores in mice envenomed with 
elapid venom from three species belonging to two different genera.  In 
addition, the increased PSS, possibly induced by hyperactivity, makes this 
particular opioid analgesic unsuitable to be recommended for use in 
commercial preclinical assays. 
In contrast, oral morphine was effective at reducing pain scores without 
adversely affecting the lethality assay results in all five venoms studied, with 
or without their homologous antivenom. The disadvantage of its short half-life 
can be overcome by repeat dosing, as required, using minimal restraint 
consequent to its apparent palatability.  Injection of 5mg/mL intraperitoneal 
morphine, prior to venom administration, could be used to ensure all mice are 
given the correct initial dose; individuals can then be topped up with liquid 
oral morphine thereafter on the basis of their MGS and activity scores. 
Another consideration is the availability of opiate analgesia and the regulations 
for their use in different parts of the world.  It may be that other effective 
analgesics, such as Tramadol (Chacon et al, 2015), at relieving the pain 
associated with envenomation in mice need to be identified. 
The current WHO guidelines (2010a) do not include use of analgesia in the 
protocols for the LD50 and ED50 assays of venom toxicity and antivenom 
efficacy. On the basis of these results it is possible to recommend that the use 
of analgesia be considered. It has been shown that morphine analgesia is 
effective in envenomed mice. However, there may be some subtle effects on 
assay outcome, and therefore this possibility should be investigated prior to 
incorporation into subsequent assays.  
Chapter 6. Refinement using Humane Endpoints offers 
the potential to Reduce numbers of mice required for 
Preclinical Testing of Antivenoms 
6.1 Objectives 
Refinement is the reduction of pain, suffering and distress experienced by in 
vivo experimental subjects, in this case, those used in WHO-recommended 
assays of venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy. The Refinement objective 
was to implement effective analgesia and to identify humane end-points 
(HEPs) and, in so doing, reduce the duration and intensity of pain, suffering 
and distress inflicted during these assays. In addition, any changes to the 
WHO recommendations had to be shown not to affect the outcome of HEP 
determination. 
6.2 Introduction 
This chapter covers the identification of HEPs and their use to reduce the 
duration and degree of pain and distress suffered by the experimental mice. 
The present recommended assay duration is 24 hours and the experimental 
metric is death (WHO, 2010). A method, staging, resulting in a reduction of 
the numbers of mice required for an LD50 or ED50 assay is described. 
6.2.1 Refinement: Humane End Points 
A HEP is defined by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) 
as the earliest scientifically justified point at which pain or distress in an 
experimental animal can be prevented, terminated, or relieved, whilst meeting 
the scientific aims and objectives of the study. The HEP can be defined by 
physiological or behavioural signs and may be alleviated by administration of 
a treatment, such as analgesia, or termination of the experiment by withdrawal 
of the noxious agent or euthanasia. 
Adoption of humane end points is therefore critical, particularly in studies 
where significant pain is anticipated. 
6.2.2 Principles for the Establishment of Humane End points  
Principles for the establishment of HEPs were defined by Demers et al, 2006 
as follows: 
I. There is strong evidence that animals experience pain and distress 
in situations comparable to those that cause pain and distress in 
humans 
II. Death or severe pain and distress should be avoided as end points 
III. The earliest possible end point should be used that is consistent 
with the scientific objectives 
IV. Studies should be designed to minimise any pain or distress likely 
to be experienced by the animals, whilst meeting the scientific 
objectives. 
V. The duration of studies involving pain and distress should be kept 
to a minimum 
VI. Pilot studies should be encouraged as a means of determining 
morbidity, time course of effects, and frequency of observation 
required to set an earlier end point. 
VII. Before commencing an experiment, agreement should be reached 
on (i) appropriate points for the study and (ii) the persons to be 
responsible for making the judgement that the end point has been 
reached. 
VIII. A team approach should be used, employing the professional 
judgement of scientist, veterinarian, animal care staff, and ethics 
committee to agree on the appropriate end point for the study. 
IX. Research and animal care staff must be adequately trained and 
competent in recognition of species-specific behaviour and, in 
particular, species-specific signs of pain, distress, and 
moribundity. 
X. Animals should be monitored by means of behavioural, 
physiological, and/or clinical signs at an appropriate frequency to 
permit timely termination of the experiment once the end point has 
been reached. 
6.3 Assessment of suffering 
Assessment of pain, using the MGS and activity scores is discussed in 
Chapter 5 - Analgesia. These parameters are not used as HEPs in isolation, 
but are considered when making a decision to euthanase an experimental 
subject. 
6.3.1 Behavioural and Neurological Observations 
6.3.2 Physiological parameters 
The key physiological parameters of arterial oxygen saturation (O2), carotid 
pulse rate (PR), respiration rate (RR) and pulse distension (PD) [volume of 
blood passing through the carotid artery during systole] of conscious mice 
were measured using a MouseOX Plus system (Starr Life Sciences).  This 
consists of a collar applied to the neck of a mouse from which two different 
wavelengths of light are shone through the mouses neck, which are detected 
and analysed using software supplied by the manufacturer (See Chapter 2A, 
section 2A.3.2). The best readings were 
obtained when the mice were immobile and 
to this end gentle restraint of the mouse, by 
holding the base of its tail on a Vetbed 
(synthetic sheepskin), resulted in improved 
tolerance of the collar and consequently 
better readings (Figure 6.3-1), with less 
distress to the subject.  
: MouseOx recording  Figure 6.3-1: Mouse-Ox recording 
6.3.3 Body Temperature 
It has been reported (Newsom et al, 2004; Kort et al, 1998 and Warn et al, 
2003) that in other murine disease models that body temperature is a reliable 
indicator of impending death. It was therefore decided to investigate the use 
of body temperature as a HEP indicator in envenomed mice. 
Temperature is often recorded in anaesthetised mice, using a rectal or 
oesophageal probe, by using a subcutaneously or intraperitoneally surgically 
implanted microchip. The results correlated well in the mouse, but 
subcutaneous temperature in the rat fell before intraperitoneal temperature 
(Lavoie et al, 2003). 
Analysis of results from a microchip transponder implanted in rats 
experimentally infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that the statistical 
analysis was not altered when a drop in body temperature below 36oC was 
used as an endpoint, rather than time of death, thus sparing animals from 
further suffering (Kort et al, 1998). 
Rectal temperature probes can only be used in adequately restrained or 
anaesthetised mice and 
implantation of telemetric 
transponders for routine assays 
would be prohibitively expensive 
and time consuming, due to animal 
numbers.  An alternative approach 
is the use of an infrared (IR) 
thermometer, which measures 
surface body temperature. When 
the sensor was aimed just behind 
the cranium in mice standing on all 
four feet and from a constant 
height, reproducible results were 
obtained (Figure 6.3-2); however, results were less reliable for very active 
Figure 6.3-2: Recording surface body 
temperature using an infrared thermometer 
mice. Use of an IR thermometer, with the sensor pointed at the sternum of 
mice, produced results which correlated well with readings from both rectal 
probes and intraperitoneal telemetric chips in hypothermic mice, however the 
correlation was less convincing in pyrexic mice (Newsom et al, 2004).  
A study which monitored mice with an experimental fungal infection using an 
IR thermometer calibrated to an implanted telemetric chip, caused little 
distress to the mice and demonstrated that mice rarely recovered if their body 
temperature dropped below 33.3oC.  Adoption of this end point in fungal sepsis 
experiments significantly reduced suffering in the terminal stages of this model 
of infection (Warn et al, 2003). 
6.3.4 Staging 
Staging is the term adopted for a method developed at LSTM that reduces 
the number of mice required for standard preclinical testing of venom toxicity 
and antivenom efficacy. In staging experiments, results from previous 
experiments are used to estimate the likely range of venom or V/AV doses 
required to result in an all deaths group, an all survivors group and two 
intermediate survival groups. 
6.4 Methods 
Experiments were performed as described in Chapter 2, section 2.2, and 2A.  
The behavioural, physiological, clinical and neurological observations 
performed are described in detail in Chapter 2A. 
6.5 Results 
6.5.1 Humane End-Points: Clinical Observations 
Clinical signs considered when defining HEPs are listed for each venom in 
Table 6.5-1. 
The following observations were identified, in their own right, as HEPs: 
a. Convulsions: Convulsions were observed to be an indicator of 
inevitable death and were often preceded by leaping where the 
mouse stargazes then launches itself into the air without apparent 
motive.  Not all mice which exhibited leaping went on to develop 
convulsions, but presence of this behaviour warranted close 
observation of the affected individual. 
b. Epistaxis (Figure 6.5-1):  Epistaxis 
(bleeding from the nose) occurs when 
there is severe haemorrhage into the 
lungs.  Prior to implementation as a 
HEP no mouse was observed to survive 
this degree of pulmonary haemorrhage. 
Figure 
6.5-1: 
Epistaxis  
c. Paradoxical respirations:  Paradoxical respirations occur when there 
is severe dyspnoea (difficulty breathing) and the effort of breathing is 
so great that, as the chest wall expands the abdomen is pulled in, 
and as the individual attempts to breathe out the abdomen is pushed 
out.  This looks like a see-saw effect between the thorax and 
abdomen.  The severity of pathological lesions resulting in this 
phenomenon is not only extremely distressing for the individual, but 
very unlikely to be reversible without intervention.   
d. Respiratory distress with cyanosis 
(Figure 6.5-2): Affected mice either 
show increased effort to breath or 
breaths are slow and very shallow, the 
latter being associated with paralysis of 
the respiratory muscles by neurotoxic 
venom components. Affected 
individuals had a bluish tinge to their 
muzzle and tails (cyanosis) indicating 
lack of circulating oxygen.  
Figure 6.5-2: Respiratory 
distress 
e. Paralysis of one or more limbs (Figure 
6.5-3):  Observations of mice which 
developed paralysis determined that the 
paralysis invariably progressed, and 
was eventually fatal 
Figure 6.5-3: Hind limb 
paralysis 
f. Loss of righting reflex:  When turned upside down the mouse is 
unable to turn back over.  One of the most distressing things for a 
mouse is to be turned onto its back (Leach et al, personal 
communication). Loss of righting reflex in a conscious mouse is an 
indication of impending death. However, in these experiments it was 
noted that mice envenomed with BaV underwent an immediate and 
profound slump, and that a few individuals went on to recover 
completely even after having suffered a loss of righting reflex. 
g. Opisthotonus: Extensor rigidity of the entire body  if conscious, this 
is excruciatingly painful, and is almost inevitably a sign of imminent 
death and should therefore be used as an indication for euthanasia.  
h. Rapid deterioration of neurological function: The neurological 
examination was generally only performed on mice which were 
immobile or had obvious neurological deficits.  Loss of sensation in 
the ear or tail shortly followed by loss of visual placing reflex invariably 
progressed to loss of righting reflex and death. 
i. Hyphaema ( Figure 6.5-4): This is 
haemorrhage into the anterior chamber of 
the eye.  In itself, it would not necessarily 
be fatal, but the pain associated with it 
made it ethically unreasonable not to 
euthanase the affected individual. 
Postmortem revealed that these 
individuals had also haemorrhaged into the 
orbital sinus behind their eyes.

6.5.2 MouseOx 
Use of the MouseOx was limited to a maximum of 4 mice in any one day, 
especially when other time-consuming observations such as MGS and activity 
scores were also being made in the same experimental sequence. Typical 
MouseOx results are shown in Figure 6.5-5 and show an initial fall in pulse 
and respiratory rates with a fall in arterial oxygen saturation.  In some mice the 
oxygen saturation recovered as the mouse recovered clinically. The 
correlation between the physiological parameters and our MGS and activity 
scores was investigated using a scatter plot, which gave the results shown in 
Figure 6.5-6.

There would appear to be, as illustrated by the lines of best fit, a relationship 
between MGS and activity scores, and between pulse rate (heart rare  HR) 
and respiration rate (breathing rate- BR) but not between any of the other 
parameters. For example, no correlation was found between subjective 
physiological parameters and objective pain measurements. 
6.5.3 Temperature 
The infrared probe used provided surface temperature readings that are 
obviously lower than core temperatures, but, importantly, it does detect 
variations in temperature. It was found that subsequent death or development 
of other HEPs resulting in euthanasia was not associated with a particular cut-
off surface temperature reading.  However, a fall in surface temperature was 
associated with mice that were patently unwell, and often the first signs of their 
recovery was a rise in surface temperature. To illustrate this Table 6.5-2 shows 
one group taken from the many LD50 experiments performed. It demonstrates 
a steady fall in the body temperature of Mouse 4 prior to its euthanasia.  
Mouse 1 shows a fall in body temperature, a recovery, and a final decline in 
surface temperature; although this subject survived to the end of the

experiment, it was moribund throughout, including at the final time point.  
Mouse 2, another survivor showed a fall in surface temperature, followed by 
a rise towards the end of the experiment, associated with a full recovery.

6.5.4 Outcome of using HEPs 
Archived experimental protocols from the last 10 years were searched and 
analysed according to survival time and numbers of survivors.  The results of 
these analyses were compared assays which lasted for 24 hours, and those 
which lasted less than 9 hours. 
6.5.4.1 Vipera berus venom 
Over 75% of all mice died or were euthanased within the first hour in all V. 
berus venom assays (Figure 6.5-8). In the 24 hour assays (n=127), there were 
no deaths after 6 hours and, in the shorter assays (n=1156), only 2 deaths 
occurred between 6 and 9 hours. Only one mouse that was well at the end of 
the working day became ill overnight in the 24 hour assays and, of the 
surviving mice, over 95% were improving at the end of the shorter assays.

24 hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
6.5.4.2 Echis ocellatus venom 
Deaths in mice envenomed with E. ocellatus venom were more prolonged, 
with over 25% of deaths occurring overnight in the 24 hour assays (n=162)  
87% of deaths were discovered early the next day (Figure 6.5-9). A larger 
percentage of mice envenomed with E. ocellatus venom than those subjected 
to V. berus venom were ill at the end of the short assays (n=1042) and of 
these only 63% were improving, compared to >95% of V. berus mice.

for 24 hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
6.5.4.3 Bitis arietans venom 
Mice envenomed with B. arietans venom showed a survival pattern similar to 
V. berus venom in that over 75% of deaths in both 24h (n=205) and shorter 
assays (n=213) occurred within the first hour of the assay (Figure 6.5-10).  In 
the 24h assays, 87% of mice were well at the end of the assay, and all mice 
that survived overnight had completely recovered by the next morning. Of the 
mice surviving at 9h, 9 were ill and 10 mice died overnight. Unfortunately, in 
these experiments, mice were not individually identified, making following 
clinical progression of individual mice unreliable.  Of the mice that died 
overnight, 9 were in ED50 experiments.

for 24 hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
6.5.4.4 Naja nigricollis venom 
Mice envenomed with N. nigricollis venom (Figure 6.5-11) showed a relatively 
short clinical progression (less than 6 hours)  only 1 of 66 animals died 
overnight and over 90% of mice had completely recovered from the venom 
effects at the end of the working day in both 24h and shorter assays (n=211). 
Figure 6.5-11: Comparison of survival of mice between N. nigricollis venomLD50s/ED50s 
for 24 hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
6.5.4.5 Other venoms 
Figure 6.5-12: Comparison of survival of mice between other venom LD50s/ED50s for 24 
hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
Figure 6.5-12 shows pooled survival data for all other venoms studied, namely 
other Echis spp., Vipera spp., Naja spp., Cerastes cerastes, Dendroaspis 
polylepis, Aspidelaps spp. and Dyspholidus typus.  This shows that more than 
70% of deaths occurred in the first hour in both 24h and shorter duration 
assays, however 23% of mice died overnight in the 24 hour assays. It is not 
easy to analyse this pooled data any further because of the wide variety of 
venoms used and their unique clinical courses.   
6.5.4.6 All venoms- pooled results 
Similarly, Figure 6.5-13 shows the analysis of pooled results from all assays, 
demonstrating that ~70% of mice die or are euthanased in the first hour of the 
experiment, and that over 80% of the remaining mice have fully recovered 
within 6 hours. The number of mice which were ill at the end of a working day 
corresponded closely to the number of deaths overnight; of 45 mice which 
were ill at the end of the day 39 died overnight, a close correspondence. 
Figure 6.5-13: Comparison of survival of mice between all venom LD50s/ED50s for 24 
hours (left) and less than 9 hours (right) 
Archived data was used to perform these analyses. However, the 24 hour 
assays lacked the recorded detail which was initiated during this project.  Mice 
were not individually identified, so there was no certainty that the mice which 
were ill were the same ones which subsequently died. Humane end-points 
were not used  many of the mice which were ill at the end of the working day 
may well have fulfilled our criteria for euthanasia and therefore there would 
likely have been fewer deaths overnight.  
To perform assays to validate the use of HEPs unequivocally for each venom 
studied, would require the consumption of large numbers of mice, which is 
ethically contrary to the objectives of this project. 
6.5.5 Staging 
The use of staging to reduce the numbers of mice used to perform LD50 and 
ED50 experiments is illustrated in Table 6.5-3. Nine venom doses from 2 - 
25L/mouse were prepared and of these, only 5 doses were used. In the past 
all nine doses would have been used and the groups dosed sequentially 
without waiting to see the potential outcome, unless deaths were within 
minutes of injection.  
Table 6.5-3: Illustration of staging using an example taken from an LD50 experimental 
sheet. Groups not used are crossed out and in red. 
Time of injection illustrates the initial selection of doses, which was based on 
the results of previous LD50 experiments performed using the same venom. 
Injected mice were observed for an hour after 4 groups had been injected and 
the number of likely deaths estimated. A venom dose of 15L/mouse did not 
appear to be likely to result in all deaths therefore a higher dose of 
25L/mouse was selected for the final dose.  In this way, the LD50 was 
completed in a single day using only 25 rather than 45 mice, had all the 
prepared venom doses been used. It is important to note that this protocol can 
only be used by employing all of the observations described to identify the 
likely outcome of each mouse.  
Of 39 LD50/ED50 assays which employed this method, the planned number of 
mice was 1,800; the actual number of mice used was 1,019, saving 781 mice, 
43.3% of the planned number. 
6.6 Discussion 
As stated in Chapter 1, there are 45 antivenom manufacturers listed on the 
WHO website http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/ snakeantivenoms/database/, 
making in excess of 120 different snake antivenoms. Assuming that, on 
average, at least 2 batches of antivenom are manufactured per annum, and 
that every batch is tested in vivo as recommended by the WHO (WHO, 2010), 
this equates to more than 25,000 mice used for regulatory testing alone, and 
does not include those used for development of new antivenoms or research 
into venom toxicity. The objective was to reduce the duration of pain, harm 
and distress suffered by the subjects of the in vivo WHO-recommended venom 
LD50 and antivenom ED50 assays by identifying HEPs. However, the 
prerequisite for adoption of these HEPs is that the methods have been 
adequately validated and that they have been demonstrated to produce results 
which are equivalent to, or generate better information than the existing 
method, which uses death as the metric (Stokes, 2002). In this way, these 
changes would not compromise the validity of the results and therefore public 
health, and would ensure that animals do not suffer needless pain, harm or 
distress (Sass, 2000). The incorporation of HEPs is being encouraged by 
regulatory authorities, such as the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur, 2014), 
but the research required to validate these changes is extensive (Castle, 
1999), which makes implementation of the 3Rs into testing of Biologicals 
frustratingly slow (Hendriksen, 2002). 
Animal research is an invaluable tool in the investigation of venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy, being the only holistic platform available at this time. The 
use of biomarkers to predict death of an experimental subject at the earliest 
opportunity is to be encouraged (Franco et al, 2012), rather than allowing 
these animals to suffer the terminal effects of envenomation, or to wait until 
they become moribund before, being humanely dispatched. These biomarkers 
can be behavioural, other clinical signs, as well as more objective 
measurements, such as weight or body temperature changes (Hankenson et 
al, 2013).   
Recognition of clinical signs relating to impending death requires continuous 
monitoring by a skilled observer, who has an in depth knowledge of the normal 
behaviour of the test species, as well as the likely pathological lesions resulting 
from the venom being studied (Morton, 2000). The study of venom toxicity is 
extremely complex due to the large number of enzymes, toxins and non-toxic 
proteins contained within. Humane endpoints will need to be tailored to each 
different venom, or family of venoms, based on knowledge of the 
pathophysiology of the venom toxins and close observation of early assays to 
establish the clinical progression of envenomation by each species. 
Table 6.5-1 in the results section of this chapter summarises the severe 
abnormal clinical findings observed, not only in mice envenomed with one of 
the five venoms selected for this project, but also those envenomed with all 
other venoms studied by the ARVRU during the project.  It was apparent that 
each venom produced a unique clinical progression but that venoms from 
closely related species produced similar clinical signs.  
Mice envenomed with E. ocellatus venom, and the other Echis species 
demonstrated clinical signs associated with severe haemorrhage. High doses 
of venom resulted in convulsions and loss of righting reflex, whilst less 
severely affected mice showed an initial slump, followed by inactivity, 
hunching, grimacing and a staring coat. Leaping in the air for no apparent 
reason was a common observation, and was often a prelude to convulsions 
with or without epistaxis, which was always associated with significant 
pulmonary haemorrhage. Leaping was not, in itself, a HEP, but warranted 
close observation of the individual. It was often followed by hyperactivity which 
progressed to convulsions. Mice which survived the initial slump often became 
dyspnoeic and adopted postures to facilitate breathing, such as propping 
themselves up. Distressed mice often exhibited paradoxical respirations and 
instead of exhibiting the orbital tightening of pain, described in the previous 
chapter, it was observed that they became wide-eyed and terminally they were 
gulping for air. It was observed that mice envenomed with venoms containing 
toxins which caused a consumptive coagulopathy showed a more prolonged 
clinical course than haemotoxic venoms, such as B. arietans venom, which 
target platelets rather than the coagulation cascade (Calvete et al, 2007).  This 
can be explained by the Russian roulette nature of coagulopathy in that the 
site of haemorrhage can dictate whether it is fatal or not which could potentially 
invalidate the use of HEPs to reduce the assay duration from 24 hours to 6 
hours. If HEPs are used to determine when a mouse is euthanased, cardiac 
puncture can be performed and the blood collected subjected to a 20 minute 
whole blood clotting test (WBCT), which is performed by placing the blood in 
a clean glass tube and examining it for the presence of clots after 20 minutes 
(See Chapter 7  Pathology). The 20min WBCT may also be performed on 
survivors after they are euthanased at the end of the experiment. By doing this 
more mice could be saved by eliminating the need to perform other in vivo 
assays, such as the MHD (minimum haemorrhagic dose) and MDD (minimum 
defibrinogenating dose), and results are likely to be more reproducible than 
waiting for a lethal haemorrhage to occur. 
Many of the venoms investigated were cardiotoxic (see Chapter 7  Pathology) 
and produced rapid death, preceded by convulsions or loss of righting reflex 
and total unresponsiveness. However, B. arietans venom produced a 
profound slump, resulting in mice that were almost completely unresponsive 
and virtually unable to right themselves. These mice retained some muscle 
tone, unlike those suffering from flaccid paralysis. Some of these mice went 
on to recover completely and it was therefore concluded that, for this venom, 
loss of righting reflex was not a valid HEP.  It is possible that this slump is the 
result of low molecular weight vasoactive adenosine (Aird, 2002), or other 
hypotensive venom components, causing a profound drop in blood pressure 
and this effect did not appear to be neutralised by any of the AVs tested. Mice 
surviving initial cardiac injury went on to develop signs of congestive heart 
failure (CHF) such as dyspnoea due to pulmonary congestion, or neurological 
signs due to either cerebral congestion or hypoxia affecting the CNS. Mice 
have a large venous sinus behind their eyes, and, particularly in mice that had 
received V. berus venom, this contained excessive amounts of blood. 
Neurotoxic venoms, such as Naja spp. and Dendroaspis spp. showed similar 
signs in the acute stages of envenomation to the haemotoxic viper venoms, 
namely, slumping, immobility, loss of righting reflex and convulsions. With 
lower neurotoxic venom doses ptosis was commonly seen in mice which had 
received mamba venom, but rarely in those which had received cobra 
venoms; sweating, paralysis and respiratory distress with slow, shallow, 
often imperceptible breathing and cyanosis was also observed with 
neurotoxic venoms. Mice which had received D. angusticeps venom, but not 
D. polylepis venom, showed muscle fasciculations, which, in some cases, 
were difficult to differentiate from paradoxical respirations. On post mortem 
examination these mice had collapsed lungs, which were often congested 
and/or consolidated (See Chapter 7), these pathological lesions being 
irreversible without intervention such as chest drains or positive pressure 
ventilation. It can be concluded that respiratory distress in these animals is a 
valid HEP. 
Deterioration in neurological function in mice envenomed with both neurotoxic 
and non-neurotoxic venoms was a strong indicator of impending death. 
Paralysis of one hind limb was frequently seen in mice which had been injected 
with V. berus venom, it was observed that the paralysis in these mice was 
progressive and inevitably resulted in death. Therefore the observation of 
unilateral hind-limb paralysis was adopted as a HEP in V. berus venom 
assays. Clinical signs adopted as HEPs for each of the core venoms studied 
are summarised in Table 6.6-1 
It had been hoped that physiological parameters could be used as an 
objective measurement to predict impending death and/or pain.  To this end 
a MouseOx collar was used to monitor conscious mice. Unfortunately it was 
only possible to monitor one mouse at a time and the best measurements 
were obtained by gently restraining the mouse on a fleecy bed. Generally, 
the pulse and respiration rates fell immediately after envenomation and 
increased as they recovered. Oxygen saturation also fell after venom was 
injected, but this measurement was unreliable and affected by even small 
movements of the subject. Pulse distension is a measure of the difference 
between diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but could not differentiate 
between a low diastolic pressure and a high systolic pressure. Scatter plots 
of these parameters and the subjective pain measurements, MGS and 
activity scores, showed that there was a relationship between pulse rate and 
respiratory rate, and an inverse relationship between MGS and activity 
scores.  
However there is no apparent relationship between physiological parameters 
and pain scores.  Perhaps this is not surprising because, although pain can 
cause increased pulse rate and respiratory rate, increased activity is 
associated with increased pulse rate and respiratory rate and added to this, 
fear, stress of handling and effects of venom toxins will also have an impact 
on physiological parameters.  The results are interesting, but there are too 
many uncontrollable variables to provide meaningful results, and the 
equipment is too complex and expensive for use other than as a research 
tool. Measurements could only be made on one mouse at a time, making it 
impractical for collecting sufficient data for statistical analysis. Results can be 
found in the chapter supplement. 
Surface body temperature readings, taken with the sensor of an IR 
thermometer pointing at the back of the mouse, were several degrees 
(centigrade) lower than those taken from the base of the sternum (Newsom et 
al, 2004), and, in agreement with the observation that readings from active 
mice were unreliable.  Taking readings from the sternum requires restraint of 
the mouse and is therefore stressful and as readings were performed hourly 
and, sometimes more frequently, on envenomed mice, the method of minimal 
intervention was adopted; the assumption was made that if a mouse was too 
active to obtain a valid reading, it was not under consideration for euthanasia.

Our findings revealed that, in envenomed mice, the more poorly the animal, 
the lower its body temperature.  However, many mice died before body 
temperature had fallen significantly, meaning that no cut off temperature 
could be identified. However, the trend was much more significant; a rise in 
surface temperature often being the first sign of recovery whilst conversely a 
protracted fall in surface temperature indicated an increasing likelihood of 
death/euthanasia. 
Analysis of the archived data provided information on survival patterns in 
animals over 24 hours compared to those in assays less than 9 hours which 
could be completed in a working day. One of the drivers for reducing assay 
duration, apart from reduction in duration of pain, harm and distress was the 
Home Office requirement to observe mice regularly overnight in order to avoid 
unnecessary suffering of mice undergoing the terminal stages of 
envenomation.  The analysis of pooled data demonstrated that the vast 
majority of mice died within the first hour after venom injection, and that most 
of those surviving to the end of the working day had completely recovered. In 
24 hour assays, the number of mice which died overnight tallied with the 
number of mice which were ill at the end of the previous day, although mice 
were not individually identified, so it is not certain that these were the same 
mice. 
6.7 Conclusions 
Our findings suggest that assay duration could be reduced from 24 hours to 6 
hours by using predefined, venom-specific HEPs, although the archive data 
would suggest that a significant number of deaths occur between 6 and 24 
hours in mice subjected to coagulopathic venoms, such as E. ocellatus. The 
use of the 20 minute whole blood clotting test for coagulopathic venoms and 
post mortem pathological lesions to confirm antivenom neutralisation of 
potentially lethal venom pathological lesions, including haemorrhage, in 
surviving mice, could be used to provide more robust assay results than the 
present lethality assays in addition to substantially reducing pain, harm and 
suffering. The potential of post mortem observations to replace other in vivo 
assays of venom toxicity will be discussed further in Chapter 7. Before 
implementation into regulatory testing of venom toxicity and antivenom 
efficacy, these changes would have to be validated for each venom and 
venom/antivenom combination. 
Staging can be used to substantially reduce the numbers of mice in LD50/ED50 
assays, but requires experienced observers and an in depth knowledge of the 
clinical progression of envenomation in mice for the venom or 
venom/antivenom being assessed. 
It is imperative that the present severity of the murine lethality assays used to 
test venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy is reduced, not only for ethical 
reasons, but to satisfy public acceptance of these assays. 
6.8 Further Work 
 The clinical progression of envenomation with a wide range of venoms 
and venom/antivenom combinations must be established before HEPs 
can be defined.  
 Ideally, 24 hour assays need to be documented with details of the 
clinical progression of each individual mouse, to confirm that it is indeed 
the mice that are ill at the end of the assay that die overnight. 
 As part of the validation process, LD50/ED50 assays should be 
performed in which the time at which a HEP intervention could or should 
ethically be made is recorded.  The animal should then be left to 
determine the survival outcome, and results compared. 
Chapter 7. Reduction: Pathology 
7.1 Introduction 
Snakebites are a major, but neglected, public health problem in the rural 
tropics of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and South America. The resulting 
pathological lesions are responsible for causing significant permanent 
disability as well as mortality in the victims of envenoming (Alam et al, 2015; 
Baruah et al, 2004; Habib et al, 2013; Habib et al, 2015; Maduwage et al, 2013; 
McNally and Reitz, 1987; Parathakan and Govindarajan, 2016; Rahman et al, 
2010; Wongtongkam et al, 2002). Morbidity results from amputation of digits 
or limbs (Abubakar et al, 2010), chronic pain and scarring at the bite site, 
disfigurement, abortion and foetal death (Habib, 2008 et al), neurological 
disabilities, blindness and psychological effects (Williams et al, 2011). 
The chronic sequelae resulting from snakebite affect both human and animal 
victims (Anlen, 2008; Hoffman, 1993; Reid, 1975; Spiller and Bosse, 2003). 
Mice are the preferred experimental model for snake venom studies. There is, 
however, a paucity of published data on the pathogenesis of systemic 
envenoming in mice, and little published on post mortem findings of mice and, 
indeed, of envenomed humans and domestic animals.  Most of the data on 
snake venom/venom toxin pathogenesis is derived from experiments 
examining the mode of action of specific venom toxins in mice and rats, for 
example: Baldo et al, 2010 (haemorrhagic snake venom metalloproteinases 
(SVMPs)); Gutierrez et al, 2009 (local tissue damage); Hernandez et al, 2011 
(skeletal muscle necrosis) and Herrera et al 2015 (extracellular matrix 
degradation). 
Much of the human pathological data is extrapolated from clinical data 
collected from snakebite victims attending hospital, the vast majority of whom 
survived envenomation, albeit some with temporary or permanent physical or 
psychological disabilities.  In many of the areas in which snakebite is common, 
post mortem (PM) examination is considered to be a desecration of the body, 
making PM examination unethical. Even in animals there are only a few 
publications on the post mortem findings of snakebite victims (Mitchell, 1915; 
Banga, 2009; Jacoby-Alner, 2011). The preclinical testing experiments of this 
research provided unique opportunities to examine venom induced pathology 
in the murine model of envenoming. 
7.2 Objectives 
 The objective of performing PM examinations on experimentally 
envenomed mice was to establish a pathological profile for as many 
different venoms as possible. PM examinations were only performed 
on mice subjected to envenomation as part of another experiment. 
 Secondly, to compare venom pathological profiles of mice that did 
(ED50) and did not (LD50) receive antivenom to identify the extent to 
which an antivenom neutralised venom-induced pathological lesions. 
 The third objective was to compare venom pathogenesis in 
experimentally envenomed mice with that of human snakebite victims. 
 The final objective was to create a simple, objective scoring system for 
ante- and post-mortem pathological lesions, which could be used to 
compare efficacy of antivenoms against the same venom(s). In this 
way, a full ED50 assay need not be performed, potentially substantially 
reducing the numbers of mice required.

7.3.3 Post mortem examinations 
Post mortem examinations were performed on mice as soon as possible after 
death or CO2 euthanasia. Some experimental objectives required a cardiac 
puncture to be performed, to obtain larger blood samples than could be 
obtained from a tail snip, immediately after death. The blood was then placed 
in an appropriate serum, heparin, EDTA or citrate tube, a thin blood smear 
made and a sample (~0.5mL) put in a glass tube for a 20 minute whole blood 
clotting test (20WBCT).  
External features were observed for surface haemorrhages, epistaxis, 
haemoptysis, hyphaema and colour of extremities. Signs of sweating, 
salivation and voided urine were noted. 
A mid-line incision was made from the level of the pubis up the abdomen and 
thorax, extending to the ramus of the mandible.  The skin was reflected, pinned 
back and a note made of abnormalities in the subcutaneous tissues  pale, 
congested, jaundiced, or haemorrhagic. Similarly, the musculature of the body 
wall and hind limbs were examined before making a midline incision into the 
abdominal cavity. Any intra-abdominal blood, with or without clots, was 
recorded and the colour of the abdominal organs noted. The size of the 
bladder and colour of urine were recorded, and a sample of urine collected to 
be examined for blood, haemoglobin or protein. The testicles were inspected 
for evidence of haemorrhage. 
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was removed by severing the oesophagus, 
where it passes through the diaphragm, and the rectum, by carefully teasing it 
free from the mesentry. Any discolouration - congestion, haemorrhage, dark 
green, black or yellow - was noted. The spleen was removed with the GIT. The 
stomach and sections of the intestines were split longitudinally, washed gently 
with 10% formalin before placing in a labelled Falcon tube, containing sufficient 
10% formalin to cover the contents, to allow later histopathological 
examination. 
The liver was excised, making a note of gall bladder size. The kidneys were 
left in situ, unless required for histopathology. Before opening the thorax, the 
diaphragm was examined for haemorrhages and signs of haemothorax, which 
is best visualised through the diaphragm.

The thoracic wall and diaphragm were removed to allow inspection of the 
thoracic contents; the heart, lungs and thymus (pluck).  The pluck was 
removed by splitting the mandible, dissecting the tongue, larynx, trachea and 
oesophagus followed by lungs, heart and thymus.  
Any abnormality of the forelimbs was noted (muscle or joint haemorrhage) and 
samples taken for histopathology, before turning the carcase over to examine 
the cranium.  A midline incision was made over the skull and neck and the skin 
reflected to expose the eyes and cranium, noting any congestion or 
haemorrhage.  Finally, a square of the skull extending from between the eyes 
to the foramen magnum was removed, to allow examination of the brain. The 
brain was carefully dissected free from the skull and the ventral surface of the 
brainstem, mid-brain and hypothalamus examined. 
Photographs were taken of representative pathological lesions and of any 
unusual or unexpected findings. Table 7.3-2 shows the template used to 
record post mortem findings.  
7.3.4 Pathology-survival score 
All pathological lesions were scored as follows: 0 (absent); 1 (mild  
congestion, pale or small, focal haemorrhages); 2 (severe  significant 
haemorrhage, extensive lung collapse or consolidation). Figures 7.4-1 to 7.4-
12 illustrate examples of the range of severity of pathological lesions observed 
and how they were scored to obtain the pathology score 
The survival time after venom injection was noted and assigned a score 0-12. 
The 6 hour assay was divided into 12 half hour periods and a score of 12 
assigned to those which died in the first 30 minutes, 11 for those which died 
31-60 minutes, and so on, so that those which survived to the end of the 
experiment scored 0. 
7.3.5 Histopathology 
The following organs were placed in 10% formalin for subsequent 
histopathology: GIT, spleen, liver, kidneys, diaphragm, heart, lungs, skeletal 
muscle, thymus and brain. Selected samples were processed by Dr Gail 
Leeming from the Veterinary Pathology Department, Liverpool University. 
Briefly, after the tissues were embedded and sliced with a microtome, the 
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff 
(PAS)  a stain for carbohydrate, or Perls Prussian blue (PPB)  a stain for 
iron which is used to detect haemosiderin. 
7.3.6 20 minute whole blood clotting test (20WBCT) 
Blood collected via cardiac puncture was placed in a small, glass test tube, 
which was left to stand and was examined periodically for the presence or 
absence of a clot. If there was no clot formation after 20 minutes, the blood 
was deemed incoagulable. 
7.3.7 Blood smears 
Thin blood smears were performed and stained with Diff-Quik (Fisher 
Scientific), which is a modified Giemsa stain. The smears were examined 
microscopically for white blood cell, platelet and red blood cell morphology. 
7.4 Results 
7.4.1 Mouse pathology 
The observed pathological lesions of systemic envenoming reflected the 
generalised assumption that viper venoms are haemorrhagic and elapid 
venoms neurotoxic. The result of the five core venoms and other venoms 
studied (for other projects) are summarised in Table 7.4-1 (viper) and Table 
7.4-2 (elapid and colubrid). The haemorrhagic viper venoms could be further 
subdivided into those which were coagulopathic (Echis spp, Cerastes cerastes 
and Calloselasma rhodostoma) and those which were not (Bitis arietans and 
Vipera berus). The one Colubrid venom studied, Dispholidus typus 
(Boomslang) was coagulopathic. Many of the mice envenomed with Viper 
venoms had terminal convulsions, leaping or paralysis of one or both hind 
limbs (See Chapter 6, HEPs). Post mortem examination of these individuals 
rarely revealed gross changes to the brain, but more frequently myocardial 
haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-7C), usually accompanied by signs of congestive 
heart failure (Figure 7.4-6C), or severe lung pathology. The assumption was 
made that the cause of death in these animals was due to cerebral anoxia 
arising from inadequate oxygenation in severely compromised pulmonary 
tissue or poor circulation resulting from heart failure.

The majority of the venoms studied produced pathology of the gastrointestinal 
tract (Figure 7.4-3).  These changes were observed in animals which survived 
for several hours after venom injection, and tended to occur in a venom-
specific site in the intestines. In the mid small intestines through to the large 
intestines, pathology in different animals showed progression from an 
increasingly intense green colour (Figure 7.4-3C and D) prior to frank 
haemorrhage (seen as a red-tinged tarry colour  Figure 7.4-3 E, G and H). A 
similar progression from dark discolouration to obvious haemorrhage of the 
stomach wall was seen, which may have been due to ulceration of the stomach 
lining, but was not confirmed histologically.

The elapid venoms showed evidence of inducing neurotoxicity at post 
mortem examination in the form of pulmonary congestion, consolidation and 
collapse (Figure 7.4-8B and C), although these observations were less 
frequent in mice envenomed with spitting cobra venoms (Naja nigricollis and 
N. nubiae).  All the elapid venoms showed evidence of inducing myocardial 
damage, either as myocardial haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-7 orC, E, F and G) 
signs suggestive of cardiac insufficiency (congested organs).

7.4.1.1 Echis species 
The most striking feature of the pathological lesions induced by the venom of 
Echis spp was incoagulable blood with widespread haemorrhage.  Most 
commonly, there was extensive pulmonary haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-8E and 
F) and haemothorax (free blood within the thoracic cavity  Figure 7.4-7A and 
B). Epistaxis was frequently seen shortly before death, and was associated 
with severe pulmonary haemorrhage.   
The post mortem findings of mice envenomed with Echis ocellatus, E. 
carinatus sochureki or E. coloratus venoms and those with a pre-incubated 
mixture of E. ocellatus venom with EchiTabG antivenom (EOG) or South 
African Vaccine Producers monovalent Boomslang antivenom (Sb) are listed 
in Table 7.4-3. Some of the mice which had received venom/antivenom 
containing aggregates had congested or oedematous organs (Figure 7.4-5D), 
indicated in the table as Aggregate pathology to differentiate from those with 
haemorrhagic lesions associated with envenomation by this species. 
Mice treated with venom and homologous antivenom still exhibited 
incoagulable blood and haemorrhages, but with a significant reduction in the 
number of mice which had pale organs (Figures 7.4-2C, 7.4-4C, 7.4-5C) 
suggesting that the haemorrhages were less severe. There was also an 
increase in the proportion of mice showing intestinal haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-
3), which suggested that the mice had survived longer.  The data was taken 
from all dose groups of all lethality experiments performed from 2012 until 
2016, using this family of venoms.  
Mice injected with E. ocellatus venom preincubated with Boomslang 
antivenom showed a completely different pathological profile and will be 
considered below in Section 7.5.3 
Table 7.4-3: Post mortem (PM) examination observations of mice subjected to different 
doses of Echis ocellatus venom alone (green) or in combination with different 
antivenoms (blue)  (2.5 x venom LD50 + different doses of EOG or 150L/mouse of 
Sb), showing occurrence of pathological lesions as a percentage of the total number of 
PM examinations performed (n). Aggregate pathology refers to pathological lesions 
which differs from that seen with venom alone

better than FAV Afrique or VINS antivenoms, but not as well as the SAIMRm 
antivenom. None of the antivenoms completely neutralised the venom 
coagulopathy at the doses used, which was also observed for mice subjected 
to a combination of E. ocellatus venom and EchiTabG.  
7.4.1.2 Bitis arietans venom 
The major pathological lesions observed due to the venom of this species were 
widespread petechial haemorrhages and those related to myocardial injury.  
Duodenal haemorrhage was observed in mice who had survived for more than 
an hour (Figure 7.4-3H). Cranial congestion (Figures 7.4-10D and 7.4-11D/E) 
or haemorrhage and muscle haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-12A and B) was also a 
frequent finding. These findings are listed in Table 7.4-5. This venom was also 
used in the study comparing efficacy of a number of polyvalent antivenoms 
directed against African snake venoms.  
The data for venom only pathological lesions is taken from different dose 
groups of venom, ranging from rapidly lethal to doses of venom from which 
all the mice survived. The venom/antivenom data was derived from mice 
which had received 5x the venom LD50 pre-incubated with different 
antivenom doses. 
It should be noted, however, that when using comparable doses of 
antivenom, the majority of deaths resulted from myocardial injury (Figure 7.4-
7C, E, F and G), manifested by myocardial haemorrhage. None of the four 
antivenoms studied was as effective as SAIMRp at neutralising the lethal 
pathological lesions of B. arietans venom. The results of this study are to be 
reported by Harrison et al (paper in progress).

doses of Bitis arietans venom alone (green) or 5x venom LD50 in combination with

percentage of the total number of PMs performed (n).

7.4.1.3 Vipera berus venom 
Vipera berus venom also induces myocardial injury and the pathological 
lesions of envenomed mice reflect this; with myocardial haemorrhage (Figure 
7.4-5 E, F and G) and congested organs (Figure 7.4-5B  lungs, Figure 7.4-
4B - liver, Figure 7.4-3B- intestines) being the most frequent observations. 
The venom is likewise haemorrhagic, although not coagulopathic  clots 
were often visible in haemorrhages into the abdomen or thorax. Cranial 
congestion was often seen, with or without congestion of the brain (Figure 
7.4-5 and D).  One lesion that seemed unique to Vipera berus envenoming 
was hyphaema (haemorrhage into the eye) (Figure 7.4-5), accompanied by 
haemorrhage into the orbital sinus (Figure 7.4-5).  The latter was a common 
finding, even in the absence of hyphaema. The pathological observations are 
listed in Table 7.4-6. 
Once again, because of varying venom and AV doses, the frequency of 
pathological lesions in mice that received a mixture of venom and AV is not a 
true reflection of those which have failed to be neutralised by the AV. This is 
considered further in the discussion section of this chapter.

7.4.1.4 Naja species 
The pathological effects of the venom of three species of spitting cobras (N. 
nigricollis, N. nubiae and N. pallida) plus two non-spitting cobras (N. haje, and 
N. nivea) were investigated. All of the cobra venoms induced myocardial injury 
(Figure 7.4-7C, E, F and G) with pathological evidence of congestcongested 
organs (Figure 7.4-2B), except for N. nivea. All venom pathological profiles 
showed evidence of respiratory paralysis, with respiratory distress ante-
mortem and post mortem examination revealing lung consolidation and 
collapse (Figure 7.4-8C). Interestingly, two of the spitting cobra venoms 
induced jaundice (Figure 7.4-1D) in some of their victims (N. nubiae and N. 
pallida) and the third species of spitting cobra, N. nigricollis, induced 
haemoglobinuria (identified using a standard urine dipstick test) in some mice 
Figure 7.4-6B). It is possible that the observed jaundice resulted from 
haemolysis. This could have been confirmed by examining serum or plasma 
for free haemoglobin. 
The major pathological lesions that were observed are listed in Table 7.4-7 (N. 
nigricollis), Table 7.4-8 (N. haje), Table 7.4-9 (N. pallida) and Table 7.4-10 
(N. nubiae and N. nivea) venoms with or without antivenom. The primary post 
mortem examination findings in mice envenomed with N. nigricollis venom was 
myocardial haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-7C), congested organs (Figures 7.4-1B, 
7.4-2B) and consolidated lungs (Figure 7.4-8C). That observed in mice 
envenomed with N. nubiae venom was jaundice (Figure 7.4-1D), yellow 
intestines (Figure 7.4-3F) and an enlarged gall bladder (Figure 7.4-6D) being 
the most salient features.

7.4.1.5 Dendroaspis species 
Venoms from both Dendroaspis species studied showed evidence of 
myocardial injury (Figure 7.4-7C, E, F, G) with congested organs (Figures 7.4-
2B, 7.4-3B, 7.4-4B, 7.4-5B, 7.4-6C, 7.4-8B, 7.4-10B-D). Mice envenomed with 
D. angusticeps (Table 7.4-10) showed autonomic nervous signs, such as 
sweating (Figure 7.4-9D) and salivation (Figure 7.4-9E), as well as muscle 
fasciculations, respiratory distress and the paralysis ante-mortem, also seen 
with D. polylepis envenomation (Table 7.4-11). Interestingly, the muscle 
fasciculations continued after death (defined by cardiac arrest).  A similar 
pathological profile was seen for the venom of both species, namely 
myocardial haemorrhage of both atria and ventricles (Figure 7.4-7F and E), 
congested tissues (Figures 7.4-2B, 7.4-3B, 7.4-4B, 7.4-5B, 7.4-6C, 7.4-8B, 
7.4-10B-D), lung collapse and consolidation (Figure 7.4-8C), distal intestinal 
haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-3D) and cranial and cerebral congestion (Figure 7.4-
10B-D).

coagulopathy similar to that induced by E. ocellatus venom. Indeed, an in vitro 
coagulation test, using human plasma, is positive for both venoms (data not 
included). EchiTabG antivenom inhibits in vitro coagulation of plasma by 
Boomslang venom but it does not completely neutralise the coagulopathy in 
vivo. However, it does significantly increase survival times and markers for 
thrombin generation, thus showing that there is some cross-protection 
afforded (Casewell et al, publication in progress).

The pathological profile of this venom (Table 7.4-13) is similar to that induced 
by Echis species (Table 7.4-12 and 7.4-4), most commonly demonstrating 
incoagulable blood, epistaxis (Figure 7.4-9A and B)), haemothorax (Figure 
7.4-7A and B), pulmonary (Figure 7.4-8E-H) and other organ haemorrhages 
(Figure 7.4-12A-C). Myocardial haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-7C, E, F, G) with 
congested organs, possibly indicating antemortem heart failure (Figures 7.4-
2B, 7.4-3B, 7.4-4B, 7.4-5B, 7.4-6C, 7.4-8B, 7.4-10B-D), was also observed. 
It is interesting to note that venom-induced pathological lesions was 
completely neutralised when 150L/mouse SAIMR boomslang antivenom was 
administered with 2.5x LD50 Boomslang venom (30g/mouse).  
The desert horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) produces another haemorrhagic 
venom, whose pathological profile includes incoagulable blood, epistaxis, 
haemothorax, pulmonary haemorrhage, myocardial injury and congested or 
pale organs (depending on severity of haemorrhages). These findings are 
listed in Table 7.4-14, which also includes those seen in Calloselasma 
rhodostoma (Malaysian pit viper) and Aspidelaps scutatus (shield-nosed 
cobra) envenomations.  
C. rhodostoma is a viper from the Asian subcontinent and has a coagulopathic 
venom. The pathological lesions observed are listed in Table 7.4-14, which 
were primarily myocardial haemorrhage, congested organs and intestinal 
haemorrhage.  
Aspidelaps scutatus is an elapid with neurotoxic and haemorrhagic venom 
(Table 7.4-14). Some of the mice developed a mucoid coating of their corneas 
(Figure 7.4-9F). This may either have been due to a failure of secretion of the 
watery component of tears or because the mouse was unable to blink properly. 
Paralysis was observed in mice which had received higher doses of venom, 
but those which had received a lower doses showed signs of a myaesthenia 
gravis-like phenomenon. Thus, when these mice were disturbed, they were 
initially active, but gradually slowed down until they slumped, then slept until 
the next observation period (half an hour later), when the activity described 
was repeated. Eventually these mice recovered completely, unlike those 
which were completely paralysed and succumbed, if not euthanased.

7.4.2 Blood films 
Blood smears were performed using samples from mice envenomed with 
Echis ocellatus venom. Cell morphologies observed are listed in Table 7.4-14. 
The most striking observation was collections of white blood cells at the 
margins of the smears the most prominent cell type being toxic neutrophils 
(neutrophils with cytoplasmic vacuolation and basophilic cytoplasm) (Figure 
7.4-13A and D), although in some films mononuclear cells were the dominant 
cell type (Figure 7.4-13B). Many of the films showed damaged cells or cell 
debris, with few recognizable cells (Figure 7.4-13C). One blood film taken from 
a mouse which had survived for 3 hours showed evidence of immature red 
blood cells (Figure 7.4-13A) having a more eosinophilic cytoplasm with 
basophilic stippling.  
In conclusion, blood films showed evidence of cytotoxicity, cell damage and 
destruction of white blood cells. This concurs with findings in human snakebite 
patients, who exhibit leukocytosis and thrombocytopaenia (Warrell et al, 
1977).

7.4.3 Histopathology 
7.4.3.1 Echis ocellatus venom 
The liver showed vacuolation of hepatocytes and was negative for Periodic 
acid-Shiff and so this was therefore likely to be hydropic change. The sinusoids 
contained few erythrocytes in one sample, but mild to moderate congestion 
with inflammatory foci in another. 
The lungs showed increasingly extensive, acute haemorrhagic foci involving 
alveoli, bronchioles and perivascular tissue, with increasing doses of venom. 
This is illustrated in Figure 7.4-14 and Figure 7.4-16A. 
Figure 7.4-14: Histopathology of mouse lung envenomed with E. ocellatus venom. A: 
4x  showing intra-alveolar haemorrhage; B: 4x  showing extensive haemorrhage; C: 
4x  showing perivascular haemorrhage (arrows, 1); D: 10x  showing intra-alveolar 
and perivascular haemorrhage 
Both sub-epicardial and sub-endocardial haemorrhage were seen in atrial and 
ventricular myocardium (Figure 7.4-15 B, C and D). Haemorrhage into the 
brown fat adjacent to the atria was observed in one sample (Figure 7.4-15A). 
The thymus exhibited extensive haemorrhage, with loss of existing tissue, 
especially within the cortex. Remaining cells frequently exhibited necrosis or 
morphology consistent with apoptosis (Figure 7.4-16B).  
Skeletal muscle and diaphragm showed areas of lysis in which the myocytes 
appeared shrunken, angular, had eosinophilic sarcoplasm, loss of striation 
and centralised nuclei (Figure 7.4-16C).

ventricle; C: 10x  sub-epicardial haemorrhage, ventricle ; D: 10x  subepicardial 
haemorrhage, atrium  
The kidneys were pale, but showed no histological abnormality. The stomach 
and intestines showed focal red areas of mucosa, with a few free erythrocytes 
within the lumen. There were areas of neutrophil infiltration, which was also 
seen in the adjacent mesentry/omentum. The brain exhibited mild to moderate 
hyperaemia.

A: 20x lung  showing perivascular and intra-alveolar haemorrhage; B: 10x thymus

muscle fibril. 
7.4.3.2 Vipera berus venom pre-incubated with ViperaVet antivenom 
The overall histological picture was one of hyperaemia/congestion. A 
particularly interesting observation was the increase of mitotic cells plus 
anisokaryosis (variation in size of nuclei) within the liver (Figure 7.4-17). The 
phenomenon of increased cell growth in low venom concentrations was seen 
in the cytotoxicity experiments.  
The question arises whether this is an in vivo example of this effect. The 
stomach and intestines exhibited infiltration of the lamina propria with 
inflammatory cells and hyperaemia. The kidneys and lungs showed 
hyperaemia. There was also some focal intra-alveolar haemorrhage in the 
lungs (Figure 7.4-18A and B). Focal haemorrhages were also seen in the 
diaphragm Figure 7.4-18D) and thymus. In the heart, the atria were dilated, as 
was the right ventricle. Hyperaemia was noted in the myocardium as well as 
multifocal, sub-endocardial haemorrhage (Figure 7.4-18C).

7.5 Discussion 
As far as is known, this is the only study to look at mouse pathological lesions 
induced by such a wide range of snake venoms, encompassing not only 
different genera and families, but also originating from diverse geographical 
habitats. 
The most interesting finding was the realization that each venom studied had 
its own unique set of pathological lesions, the severity of which was dose and 
time dependent. This observation is perhaps not surprising, given that each 
venom has its own unique toxin profile.  
7.5.1 Comparative pathology of envenomed humans and mice 
A review of the literature on snakebite was undertaken to ascertain the extent 
to which venom-induced pathological lesions in the mouse model reflects 
those observed in human victims of envenoming. This is important because 
the validity of the murine preclinical assays has been criticised as not 
sufficiently reflecting the human condition (Maduwage et al, 2016). 
7.5.1.1 Echis species venom: comparative pathology 
Human envenoming by Echis spp. are characterised by incoagulable blood 
and haemorrhage, and the small amount of post mortem data (Professor David 
Warrell, personal communication) demonstrates many of the post mortem 
observations in mice. A comparison of envenoming by Echis spp. is listed in 
Table 7.5-1 and examples shown in Figure 7.5-1 (subcutaneous 
haemorrhages); Figure 7.5-2 (incoagulable blood); Figure 7.5-3 (intra-oral 
haemorrhage); Figure 7.5-4  (Pale tissues); Figure 7.5-5 (pulmonary 
haemorrhage); Figure 7.5-6 (muscle injury/haemorrhage) and Figure 7.5-7 
(intracerebral haemorrhage).

7.5.1.2 Bitis arietans venom: comparative pathology 
Systemic envenoming by Bitis arietans induces thrombocytopaenia, with its 
characteristic petechial haemorrhages. Profound hypotension is seen in 
humans (Figure 7.5-8); in mice there is a slump, which may be so severe that 
the individual loses its righting reflex (refer to Chapter 6: Humane Endpoints). 
Muscle injury is apparent in both humans and mice after envenoming, which 
may be so severe in human victims that amputation is necessary (Figure 
7.5-9). Table 7.5-2 lists the pathological lesions observed in envenomed mice 
and humans.

7.5.1.3 Vipera berus venom: comparative pathology 
The European Adder, Vipera berus, is the only venomous snake native to the 
UK and there are relatively few reported bites in humans; only 32 bites in 2016 
required treatment with antivenom (ViperaTab sales, MicroPharm Ltd, 
personal communication).  There are, however, considerably more bites in 
dogs and other domestic animals.

The clinical presentation has similarities in all species, namely severe oedema 
spreading from the bite site. This localised oedema is not seen in the 
intravenously venom-injected mouse model, which shows only signs of 
systemic envenoming. 
Cardiovascular signs occur in all envenomed species, as listed in Table 7.4-
18. Figure 7.5-10A shows the physiological consequence of myocardial injury 
in a dog bitten by an adder. The resulting tissue damage is irreversible with 
antivenom. Figure 7.5-10B shows venom induced myocardial haemorrhage, 
which is associated with muscle necrosis, as demonstrated 
histopathologically. A 45 year old man who was intravenously envenomed by 
Vipera aspis died within minutes; autopsy showed massive myocardial injury 
(de Haro et al, 2009)  exactly that which was observed in our mice. 
Figure 7.5-10: V. berus envenomation resulting in myocardial injury as denoted by A: 
multiple ventricular premature complexes on an ECG of a canine patient (personal 
communication) and B: haemorrhage of the right ventricular myocardium of a mouse. 
Coagulation disturbances have been noted in human cases of systemic 
envenoming by this species (Bart et al, 2016: Boels et al, 2012; Moser and 
Roeggia, 2009; for example). In the mouse model, free blood was often 
observed in the thorax, and occasionally in the abdomen; clots were nearly 
always present. In humans, vomiting and/or diarrhoea are common in systemic 
envenoming; mice are unable to vomit, but at post-mortem intestinal 
haemorrhage was frequently observed.  
Although neurological signs are rarely seen in human V. berus snakebite 
patients, it has been reported that certain populations of V. berus in Hungary 
(Malina et al, 2008) and particularly V. aspis (Ferquel et al, 2007) and V. 
ammodytes (Latinovik et al, 2016) appear to have venom which contains a 
neurotoxin, the signs of which are restricted to diplopia, dizziness and 
drowsiness. Whilst comatose patients have been described, these are thought 
to be due to profound hypotension (Malina et al, 2008).  In mice, hyperaemia 
and congestion of the brain was observed as well as ante mortem hind limb 
paralysis (Chapter 6).  It is unlikely that this was attributable to hypotension as 
it was an observation made exclusively after recovery from the initial slump. 
Possibly it was the result of cerebral anoxia or localised brain lesions, such as 
ischaemia due to microthrombi or small intracerebral haemorrhages. 
Alternatively, it may result from spinal cord pathology  a peripheral 
neuropathy is an unlikely explanation as, if left, the ascending paralysis was 
progressive. The presence of an unknown presynaptic neurotoxin (PLA2) is 
also a possible explanation for this observation. 
7.5.1.4 Other viper venoms: comparative pathology 
Myocardial injury is frequently observed in mice envenomed by any viper 
species, and this is, indeed, the case in naturally envenomed humans and 
animals. Myocardial injury has been identified in humans (Moser et al, 2009), 
dogs (Pelander et al, 2010), horses (Anlen, 2008) and at post mortem 
examination in a cow (Figure 7.5-11A) as well as in the mouse model (Figure 
7.5-11B). Figure 7.5-12: A- mouse and B- horse shows the histopathology of 
venom-induced myocardial injury. 
Figure 7.5-11: Viper envenomation resulting in ventricular myocardial haemorrhage A: 
cow (Banga et al, 2009); B: mouse.  
Figure 7.5-12: Viper envenomation showing myocardial damage. A: sub-endocardial 
haemorrhage and myocardial necrosis in a mouse; B: 200x right ventricular 
myocardium of a horse  fibre necrosis is characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation 
and pyknotic nuclei (arrow). On the left are normal fibres (Hoffman et al, 1993). 
Muscle injury commonly occurs following viper bites (Crolatus spp.  Azevedo-
Marques et al, 1985), Bitis arietans (Warrell, 1975), and an unknown Indian 
viper (possibly Russells viper) in a cow (Banga et al, 2009). Figure 7.5-13 A 
and B show electron micrographs of muscle biopsies from the contralateral 
limb to that which was bitten, panel C shows a section of muscle from a mouse 
injected with E. ocellatus venom.  Both show evidence of muscle injury, with 
fibres which have undergone apoptosis and necrosis. 
Pulmonary haemorrhage resulting in epistaxis or haemoptysis is seen in 
victims envenomed with coagulopathic viper venoms. Figure 7.5-14 
demonstrates haemoptysis resulting from Callesolasma rhodostoma venom in 
a human patient (A) (Warrell, 1999) and the mouse model (B).

7.5.1.5 Naja nigricollis venom: comparative pathology 
In humans, the effects of N. nigricollis envenoming is largely localised, 
resulting in swelling and tissue necrosis; the classical signs of elapid 
neurotoxicity are not seen (Warrell, 1976). Spontaneous haemorrhage, 
including haematuria and subarachnoid haemorrhage may occur and these 
were observed in the mouse model. The major difference between mouse and 
human envenoming is that mice exhibit paralysis, dyspnoea with post mortem 
examination evidence of respiratory failure (lung collapse and consolidation). 
Whilst in humans cardiotoxicity is rarely observed, myocardial haemorrhage is 
a commonly observed lesion in the mouse model.

7.5.1.6 Dendroaspis species (mamba) venom: comparative pathology 
There are relatively few humans bitten by D. angusticeps due to their shy 
nature and arboreal habitat, reflected in the near absence of published 
accounts of envenomation by this species.  In contrast, there are many more 
humans who fall prey to the notoriously aggressive black mamba, D. polylepis; 
but there is a paucity of published pathological observations of victims. 
Mamba venom is primarily neurotoxic and envenoming is potentially fatal 
unless antivenom is administered promptly and/or mechanical ventilation is 
available. Venom toxins cause descending paralysis and death from 
respiratory failure. This occurs both in human snakebite victims and in the 
mouse model. In both cases, the onset of paralysis is heralded by ptosis  
paralysis of the facial muscles responsible for opening the eyes; shown in 
Figure 7.5-15, which also shows sweating due to the effects of venom toxins 
on the autonomic nervous system.

Table 7.4-20 lists the common pathological lesions observed in human 
snakebite victims and in the mouse model.  D. angusticeps venom contains a 
unique toxin  fasciculin, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase and induces 
muscle fasciculations (see section Error Reference source not found.). This 
pecies of venom can also produce a pronounced local reaction as well as mild 
haemostatic disturbances (WHO, 2010). 
Cardiotoxicity has been reported following mamba bites (Blaylock, 1982); in 
the mouse model myocardial haemorrhage is not an infrequent post mortem 
observation.

7.5.2 The mouse as a model for human envenoming 
The results suggest that the mouse may be a better model of human 
envenoming than previously thought, with many examples of parallel 
pathological lesions, particularly those associated with haemorrhage.  In the 
case of coagulopathic venoms, fatality in the mouse is a somewhat Russian 
roulette event in that whether the mouse dies within the duration of the assay 
depends on when, if and where (anatomically) haemorrhage occurs.  Perhaps 
doing a 20 minute whole blood clotting test at the end of an assay, or 
immediately after a mouse dies, would be a more accurate measure of venom 
toxicity and antivenom efficacy. 
There is much debate about the validity of the mouse model for characterising 
procoagulant venoms of Australian elapids. It was shown that different species 
showed different susceptibilities to the procoagulant effects of snake venom 
(Maduwage et al, 2016). 
Of the venoms studied, only the spitting cobras, Naja nigricollis and N. pallida 
showed widely differing lethal effects in the mouse compared to other species, 
namely neurotoxicity, with mice subjected to these venoms succumbing to 
flaccid paralysis and post mortem findings consistent with respiratory 
paralysis. In envenomed humans, neurotoxicity is rare, and when described is 
generally confined to somnolence and visual disturbances. This dichotomy 
may be explained in terms of the mouse being a prey species of these snakes 
with venom toxins specialised to immobilise and kill its food. 
7.5.3 Post mortem examination and pathology/survival score to profile 
venom-induced pathology by snake species 
Post mortem examination has proved to be an exceedingly useful tool in 
quantifying the systemic pathological effects of venom. It was observed that 
the number of lesions observed and/or organs affected increased with time. 
To adjust for this increase in observed post mortem lesions with time, a scoring 
system was developed in which the longer the survival time, the lower the 
survival score; the sum of these scores is the pathology-survival score 
(PSS). A better term for the survival score would be the mortality score (see 
Chapter 2A). 
Using this system for non-commercial assays, we were able to compare the 
effect of different antivenoms, using only ten mice, compared to a minimum of 
twenty for a full ED50. In this way, we achieved a considerable reduction in the 
numbers of mice required for this comparison of antivenoms. 
However, high doses of venom often produced rapid death, with insufficient 
time for gross lesions to develop, so the PSS had a value of 12 (survival score) 
plus the pathology score, whereas a mouse surviving until the end of a 6 hour 
assay would score 0 for the survival score, but, in the case of a haemorrhagic 
venom for example, may have a pathology score of more than 20. The survival 
scoring needs to be revised  perhaps using a logarithmic scale. The 
maximum survival score should also reflect the likely upper range of pathology 
score for the particular venom being studied.  
The Pathology score could be modified to weight those pathological lesions 
which are potentially lethal, such as myocardial haemorrhage, more highly 
than those which are not lethal, or merely indicate a greater severity of a 
pathogenic process, such as testicular haemorrhage. Antemortem 
observations, such as respiratory distress or paralysis could also be added to 
the score. In this way, the effect of neurotoxins, which produce minimal gross 
lesions, could be accounted for in the pathology score. The present system 
is a greater measure of the severity of envenomation by the enzyme-rich viper 
venoms than by the neurotoxin-rich elapid venoms. 
Of the venoms studied, Echis species were haemorrhagic, with incoagulable 
blood. Another venom which produces a similar pathological profile was the 
Boomslang (Dispholidus typus). When Boomslang antivenom was pre-
incubated with E. ocellatus venom, the resulting pathology profile was very 
similar to that of B. arietans. It would seem that the Boomslang antivenom had 
neutralised the procoagulant toxins in the E. ocellatus venom, but not those 
which affected platelet function, nor those which were myotoxic. This was 
rather like peeling an onion  by neutralising the foremost pathological effect 
of the venom, more minor pathological lesions were revealed. 
The histopathology of samples from mice envenomed with E. ocellatus venom 
generally confirmed what was observed on gross PM examination  
widespread haemorrhages. It also revealed microscopic evidence of myolysis 
and areas of myocardial injury. 
Bitis arietans venom is also haemorrhagic, but the pathognomic feature is 
widespread petechiation. This would suggest that the primary toxin target is 
the platelet, and indeed, in clinical envenomings, thrombocytopaenia is 
frequently noted (Warrell et al, 1975). Muscle and cardiac injury were also 
common and the duodenum appeared to be the most commonly targeted area 
of the gastrointestinal tract. The specificity of venom toxins for different areas 
of the gastrointestinal tract is an area for future research. 
Vipera berus venom is also haemorrhagic, although results suggest that the 
blood is not incoagulable given that clots were frequently observed. In the 
mouse model, cardiotoxicity and signs of congestive heart failure were the 
most common observation with gastrointestinal pathology most commonly 
seen in the distal small and in the large intestines.  
Histopathology of V. berus venom pre-incubated with ViperaVet antivenom 
showed an increased number of mitotic figures. Whether this is a feature of 
the cell growth promoting effect described in Chapter 8, or an effect of the 
ovine Fab AV is unclear. To investigate this phenomenon further, the 
histopathology of livers of mice which had received low doses of venom or 
antivenom only could be performed. 
Naja nigricollis venom produced signs of neurotoxicity in the mouse model, 
with ante-mortem respiratory distress and terminal paralysis in high venom 
dose groups. The venom proteome contains a very small amount of an -
neurotoxin (0.4%)  whether this is sufficient to explain the neurotoxic signs 
seen in mice, or whether there is some other toxin responsible is open to 
debate. The vast majority of toxins in this species arsenal are consistent with 
its tissue destructive signs of local envenoming (Petras et al, 2011). The 
venom was found to contain a cardiotoxin (Petras et al, 2011), which is thought 
to contribute to local tissue damage, but could also explain the myocardial 
injury observed in the mouse pathological profile. 
Dendroaspis angusticeps venom in the mouse model shows many of the 
neurotoxic signs of envenoming seen in human victims of bites by this species.  
Notably sweating, salivation, muscle fasciculations, ptosis with descending 
paralysis and respiratory distress.  The pathological profile also included 
myocardial injury with signs of heart failure. 
The jaundice and/or haemoglobinuria seen in the pathological profile of the 
spitting cobras is somewhat perplexing. The lesions observed suggests a 
haemolytic anaemia. This observation warrants further explanatory 
investigation. 
7.5.4 Antivenom efficacy 
In Section 7.4.1: Mouse pathological lesions, tables show the percentage of 
mice post mortem examinations exhibiting each pathological lesion listed. As 
detailed above, these percentages are not comparable between venom and 
antivenom or between antivenoms because of the dose discrepancies.  The 
exception is between the five polyvalent African antivenoms studied (South 
African Vaccine Producers, formerly known as SAIMR  as gold standard, 
FAV Afrique, VINS, Inoserp and Premium Serum and Vaccines Institute, India) 
in which standard doses of venom and antivenom were used.  
A more appropriate method of establishing antivenom efficacy would be to look 
at which venom-induced pathological lesions are not neutralised at the lowest 
all survivors antivenom dose. This information could then be augmented 
using antivenomics to identify unbound toxins. If the unbound toxins activity 
correlates to observed pathological lesion it is strong evidence for a deficiency 
in antivenom efficacy. The significance of the pathological lesions determines 
whether the deficiency needs to be addressed. 
Another important finding was the ability to differentiate between aggregate-
induced and venom-induced pathological lesions. Aggregate-induced 
pathological lesions showed swollen and congested organs, with marked 
hyperaemia and congestion of extremities, but without the obvious myocardial 
haemorrhage observed in congestive heart failure associated with venom-
induced pathological lesions. Some of the IgG antivenoms produced 
aggregates when mixed with high doses of venom  probably due to cross-
linkage of antibody-toxin complexes.  The pre-incubation of venom with 
antivenom is an artificial construct because, in the clinical situation, venom is 
injected subcutaneously, or at worst, intramuscularly (although a case of 
intravenous envenomation has been described: De Haro et al, 2009). 
Antivenom is then administered, usually intravenously, hours to days later. The 
probability of sufficient concentrations of venom and antivenom occurring 
intravascularly is negligible. At present, ED50 assay results can be severely 
compromised by aggregate deaths. Centrifugation to remove the aggregates 
may remove potentially active toxins from the mix and result in an erroneously 
low ED50 value. 
7.6 Conclusions 
Post mortem examination of envenomed mice has greatly enriched our 
knowledge and understanding of snake venom induced pathological lesions, 
the intention being to publish these findings in the near future. The unique 
pathology profile of each venom studied could be explained in most cases by 
the venoms proteome, although there are still major gaps in understanding of 
the mode of action and toxic effect of all venom constituents. 
When post mortem pathological lesions are considered, the mouse is a better 
model for human envenoming than it has previously been given credit for. One 
major exception is the spitting cobras, particularly with reference to N. 
nigricollis. 
The use of toxicovenomics to predict induced pathological lesions is an 
exciting and interesting area of study. The use of venom pathological profile, 
in combination with antivenomics, is likely to become a valuable tool in 
assessing antivenom neutralising efficacy and identification of antivenom 
shortcomings. 
The pathology-survival score (PSS) has the potential to become a valuable 
means of refining and reducing the present mouse LD50/ED50 assays. 
Refinement: the use of PM observations allows termination of assays without 
using death as their endpoint. Reduction: using the PSS as a means to 
compare the efficacy of AVs to a particular venom, rather than full ED50s for 
each test antivenom can reduce the numbers of mice required by more than 
half (>100%). 
Chapter 8. Replacement  
8.1 Objectives 
The objective of this section of the project was to develop a cell based assay 
comprising a matrix of cell types, which reflect the most relevant cell targets in 
clinical envenoming by a variety of medically relevant snake venoms. The 
assay should demonstrate a measurable cytopathic effect (CPE) 
corresponding in severity to the in vivo murine median lethal dose and 
neutralisation proportional to the murine ED50. The selected cell lines must 
require minimal intervention for maintenance and the CPE detection system 
should be simple and robust. This will ensure that the assay can be performed 
globally without the need for highly specialized and expensive equipment.  
8.2 Introduction 
The complexity and variety of snake venoms and subsequent pathological 
lesions of envenomation provides an immense challenge to replace the gold 
standard WHO in vivo tests with an in vitro alternative.  Many of the available 
in vitro tests show binding, but not necessarily neutralisation, of venom 
components by antibodies (cf Cook et al, 2010). In order to replace in vivo 
testing, consideration needs to be given to the cost of performing the assay, 
as well as the expertise and specialist equipment to perform such an assay.  
Ideally, the assay should be simple, robust even in tropical conditions, and 
inexpensive so that efficacious, safe and affordable antivenoms (AVs) can be 
supplied to those most in need. 
Cell assays are increasingly used to assess the cytotoxic and metabolic effects 
of snake venoms as an alternative to in vivo assays. They are used as a means 
to elucidate the mechanism of action of venom components (Lomonte et al 
1994a,b,c; Rigoni et al 2004 ) and to investigate the possible therapeutic use 
of snake venom toxins (Bradshaw et al, 2014, Conlon et al, 2013).  The assays 
may also be used to assess the efficacy of AV in neutralising these cytotoxic 
effects. So far, a relationship between cytotoxicity and in vivo LD50 has not 
been demonstrated (Oliviera et al, 2001).  The degree of cytotoxicity varies 
between the cell line used and the species of snake venom or toxin added 
(Giron et al, 2005). 
8.2.1 Detection methods 
There are a number of ways in which the effect of venom on cells can be 
measured.  The simplest is visual assessment of cell morphology by light 
microscopy.  However, this is subjective and prone to considerable variation 
between operators. 
Colorimetric assays measure the uptake or exclusion of dyes such as Trypan 
Blue, which is excluded by viable cells, but not by dead cells.  The 
disadvantage of this method is that it does not include those cells which are 
lysed by venom.  A sensitive and reproducible assay for cell viability uses 
Neutral Red, a weakly cationic dye, which is believed to enter cells by non-
ionic diffusion through the cell membrane, after which it accumulates in 
lysosomes (Borenfreund et al, 1985; Oliviera et al, 2001).  Another set of 
assays for viable cells using MTS, a tetrazolium salt, requires the presence of 
active mitochondria and has the advantage of no washing steps.  It can also 
be used to measure proliferative lymphokines, mitogen stimulations and 
complement-mediated lysis (Mosman, 1983; Konstantakopoulos et al, 2008; 
Kalam et al, 2011).  However, using MTS assay medium, serum albumin and 
fatty acids can be a major distorting factor (Huang et al, 2004). 
Other available assays include: a luminescence assay to measure ATP and 
thus cell viability (Promega; CellTiter-Glo), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
which is released from damaged cells (Promega; Cyto Tox-ONE membrane 
integrity assay) and a range of assays which detect metabolic changes such 
as oxidative stress, cell cycle and proliferation analysis (Millipore).  These 
assays have the potential to elucidate the mechanism of action of venom 
components, but are too complex and expensive to be of use in the screening 
and assessment of antivenoms. 
8.2.2 Cell lines 
A wide variety of cell lines have been used in venom cytotoxicity assays, 
including VERO (Oliviera et al, 2001), mouse kidney (Giron et al, 2005), 
myoblasts (Angulo et al, 2005; Bustillo et al, 2008; Cintra-Francischinelli et al, 
2009, Omran et al, 2004); endothelial cells from a number of anatomical 
structures (Lomonte et al, 1994, Gremski et al, 2007), cardiomyocytes (Mbuga 
et al, 1988, Gowda et al, 1993), epithelial cells, fibroblasts, kidney cells, 
neuroblastoma and many others.  Cells may be derived directly from parent 
tissue (primary cell culture) or may be established cell lines and may originate 
from different species.  When using an established cell line, continual 
passaging can change the characteristics, therefore a limit to the number of 
passages used for experimental work should be set, and cells discarded once 
this limit has been reached. 
8.2.2.1 VERO cells 
VERO cells are derived from African green monkey kidneys, are 
morphologically fibroblasts, and form a monolayer when cultured.  They have 
a doubling time of 18 hours during exponential growth, but at lower seed rates 
can be left for a week or more without the need for a media change.  The rapid 
doubling time makes this cell line suitable for use in a screening assay 
entailing a rapid turnover. They require a basic medium for optimum growth  
(Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium [DMEM] containing high glucose with 
added foetal bovine serum, glutamine and non-essential amino acid).  This 
cell line was selected as first choice for this project. 
8.2.2.2 SH SY5Y cells 
SH SY5Y cells were originally established from a human neuroblastoma 
derived from a metastasis in bone marrow. The cells propagate by mitosis and 
differentiate by extending neurites. They can convert glutamate to GABA, are 
acetylcholinergic, glutaminergic and adenosinergic.  They are more slowly 
dividing than VERO cells, having a doubling time of more than 55 hours, and 
have more specific media requirements (DMEM-Ham-F12, plus glutamine, 
non-essential amino acids, foetal bovine serum and sodium pyruvate).  Snake 
venom neurotoxins target acetylcholinergic neuro-muscular junctions so it was 
hypothesized that they may produce a CPE in this line by targeting the cells 
acetylcholinergic receptors. 
Characteristics of cell lines reference: ECACC product information. 
8.3 Methods 
Cell culture facilities were developed from scratch at the beginning of this 
project, and entailed optimization of cell culture techniques in the new facility. 
General cell culture materials and methods are described in Chapter 2, section 
2.4.1.  
8.3.1 Assay optimization 
Firstly the cytopathic effect of venom was established by incubation of VERO 
cells (1.5x105 cells/mL) in medium (DMEM) containing different concentrations 
of venom (0.1-100mg/L), for varying lengths of time (0.5, 1, 2, 4 & 6 hours). 
Control cells were incubated in medium alone. The cells were then washed by 
suspending in PBS, centrifuging and re-suspending the pellet in medium and 
used to seed a culture plate. Cell growth was assessed using a neutral red 
assay as described in Chapter 2. The experiment can be found in its entirety 
in the chapter supplement (vct10). 
8.3.1.1 Detection methods 
8.3.1.1.1 Visual inspection 
An inverted microscope was used to examine the cells in the culture flask or 
culture plate.  The percentage cover of the field was estimated and changes 
in morphology noted. 
8.3.1.1.2 Trypan blue 
Trypan blue was used to differentiate live from dead cells. It is excluded by live 
cells, which appear white in a blue background. It was used when cell counts 
were performed. 
8.3.1.1.3 Neutral Red 
See Chapter 2, section 2.4.1. 
8.3.1.1.4 xCELLigence 
Cytotoxicity and neutralisation assays were performed using the xCELLigence 
system to examine the real time growth of cells.  Sixteen-well e-plates were 
used, which could be run as single, double or triple-plate assays in the three 
available xCELLigence cradles (Figure 8.3-1).   
.Figure 8.3-1: xCELLigence cradle inside incubator (A) and display showing 
all three cradles in use (B) 
The e-plates have a central strip devoid of electrodes which allows 
visualisation of growing cells.  The system was used for optimisation of assays 
and not for data collection, so duplicate samples were often not used. 
The plates were seeded with the appropriate cell count for the experiment 
being performed (e.g. 1.5 x104 cells/ well for VERO cells grown in venom)  and 
then allowed to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the cells to 
settle prior to insertion of the plate(s) into the xCELLigence cradle(s).  Cell 
index (CI)  a measure of electrical resistance across the bottom of each well 
- was recorded every 15 minutes until test compound(s) were added. At this 
time the CI was normalised to a value of 1.0 to allow for variation in cell growth 
of each well. Immediately after addition of the test substance(s) CI was 
recorded every 5 minutes for 1 hour, then every 15 minutes thereafter.  CI 
reflects the proportion of the bottom of the well covered by cells, but does not 
differentiate between increased numbers and increased size of cells. The real-
time cell assay (RTCA) software was used to calculate slope (rate of change), 
LC50 or EC50 over the study period and LC50 (50% death of cells from venom 
toxicity) or EC50 (50% neutralisation of venom toxicity) at given time points, 
which include the R2 value. 
8.4 Results 
8.4.1 VERO Cells 
All the venoms tested produced a 
CPE on VERO cells. Figure 8.4-1A 
shows normal VERO cell growth. 
The cells start to round and holes 
appear in the monolayer (Figure 
8.4-1B). The holes enlarge, the cells 
clump and cell debris can be seen. 
Eventually only cell debris is visible 
(Figure 8.4-1C).

8.4.1.1.1 Cell growth time (growth) and assay end-point (EP) 
The optimization of cell growth time prior to venom addition and assay end-
point  were carried out using E. ocellatus venom by means of the xCELLigence 
system. A complete set of results can be found in the chapter supplement 
(vctEOG-1).  The results are summarised in Figure 8.4-2 and Table 8.4-1.

The optimum time to add venom, using a seeding rate of 1.5 x 104/well, is after 
6 hours of growth, and optimum end-point is 4 hours.  However, given that the 
neutral red has to be left on the cells for 2-3 hours, this regime would not fit 
into a normal working day.  Next the optimal seeding rate for an assay where 
cells were added to venom and had an end-point of 16h or for venom addition 
to cells after 16h (overnight) growth, with an end-point of 4 hours, was 
determined. 
8.4.1.1.2 Seed rate 
This experiment was performed by growing different numbers of cells in venom 
using an end-point of 16h. The results are illustrated in Table 8.4-2 and Figure 
8.4-3. The complete results are illustrated in the chapter supplement (vct29). 
A seed rate of 1.5x104 was selected for future experiments using cells grown 
in venom and an end-point of 16h. The optimum end-point using this seed rate 
of cells grown in venom was examined using the xCELLigence system with 
two different venoms (Echis ocellatus and Vipera berus)

8.4.1.1.3 Assay End-point  VERO cells (1.5x104/well) grown in Viper 
venoms 
Both venoms studied demonstrated an effect on the growth of VERO cells, 
which was dose dependant.  It was possible to calculate the LC50 (The dose 
which inhibits 50% of maximum growth) at specific time-points after venom 
addition.  The LC50 remained constant from 8 until 14 hours, when it started to 
rise. An end-point of 16 hours was chosen for performance of neutral red 
assay to allow each step of the experiment to be performed within normal 
working hours. 
The real-time (RT) growth of VERO cells in different concentrations of E. 
ocellatus venom is shown in Figure 8.4-4A and LC50 plotted from 8-22 hours 
in Figure 8.4-4B. Similar plots showing VERO cell growth in V. berus venom 
are shown in Figure 8.4-5A and B. The LC50 of E. ocellatus venom was 
60ng/well and that of V. berus venom was 100ng/well after 16 hours growth.

8.4.1.1.4 Optimisation of venom cytotoxicity neutralisation 
VERO cells (1.5x 104/well) were grown in E. ocellatus venom, which had been 
pre-incubated with different dilutions of EchiTabG antivenom (EOG) for 30 
minutes at 37oC. The xCELLigence was used to monitor cell growth. The 
optimum end-point was 16h, with an EC50 dilution of 1:109 at 16h. The results    
are summarised in Table 8.4-3. and illustrated in Figure 8.4-6.

8.4.1.1.5 Assay variation 
Once the assay was optimised the repeatability was examined by either 
growing VERO cells (1.5x104/well) in E. ocellatus venom (20-500 ng/well) or 
V. berus venom (50  1000ng/well), or adding venom to the cells after 8 hours 
growth. End-point was after 16h and a neutral red assay was used to detect 
the percentage of surviving cells. The results are summarised in Table 8.4-4, 
which shows both between and within assay variation for the two venoms and 
cells at two different growth points. Graphical illustration of these results can 
be found in the chapter supplement (vcnVP4 and vcnEOG6).  Mean LC50 of 
both venoms was lower when cells were grown for 8h prior to venom addition 
compared to when the cells were grown in the venom. Mean LC50 of E. 
ocellatus venom was lower than that of V. berus venom. The 95% confidence 
intervals (CI95), and consequently coefficient of variation (CV) were higher for 
V. berus venom than for E. ocellatus venom. The CV was greater than 30% 
for cells grown in V. berus venom both for within and between assay variations. 
This CV is greater than for other in vitro assays (SSAC<10%, ELISA 15-20%).

Results for the studys five selected venoms are summarised in Table 8.4-5 
and Table 8.4-6 and illustrated in Figure 8.4-7 and Figure 8.4-8. Growing the 
cells for 16h before adding venom is a more sensitive assay then growing the 
cells in venom, but does add an extra intervention step to the assay. When 
cells are grown in venom, they are more sensitive to the effects of the viper 
venoms than to those of the elapids. 
However, D. angusticeps venom has a greater cytopathic effect when added 
to cells which have been grown overnight. The cytopathic effect of B. arietans 
venom is similar when the cells are grown in the venom or when the venom is 
added to the grown cells. 
8.4.1.3 Venom cytotoxicity neutralisation 
Venom cytotoxicity neutralisation assays were performed using VERO cells 
(0.75x104/well) grown for 16h before venom/antivenom addition. A neutral red 
assay was performed 4h later.  In order to optimize the venom concentration 
and starting AV dilution a checkerboard assay was performed in which one 
row (B-G) each of a 96 well culture plate contained 0-5x venom LC50. This 
experiment equates to the in vivo range-finding experiments. An example of 
the results can be seen in section 8.5, Figure 8.5-3.

The results of the full EC50 experiments are summarised in Table 8.4-7. All five 
venoms were neutralised by their homologous antivenoms, although not all 
treated cells attained 100% of control cell growth and others outgrew the 
control cells at higher antivenom dilutions. This is illustrated in Figures 8.4-9 
and 8.4-10.

8.4.2 SH SY5Y Cells 
SH SY5Y cells grew as a monolayer, 
but their cell cycle is longer than 
VERO cells. They grow with spikey 
projections (Figure 8.4-11A).  If left 
for a week or more, the cells 
appeared to pile up. When venom 
was added, as with the VERO cells, 
holes started to appear in the 
monolayer (Figure 8.4-11B). The 
cells clumped in balls (Figure 8.4-
11C) until only cell debris was 
visible.

cells. A: Normal growth; B: Mild CPE; C. 
Destruction of the monolayer.  
8.4.2.1 Assay optimization 
The xCELLigence system was used to optimize SH SY5Y cell growth, seed 
rate and assay end-point, as previously described for VERO cells. 
8.4.2.1.1 Seed Rate 
The assay was most sensitive at all seed rates for venom addition after  
between 16 and 24 hours growth, which also had the highest R2 values.  The 
plots revealed that the maximum effect of venom on the cells occurred within 
the first 4 hours.  After this time, cells which had been treated with lower 
concentrations of venom had started to regrow. Before making a decision on 
what time to use as an end-point for the assay it was decided to perform the 
assay using a variety of other venoms. As the result of this experiment a seed 
rate of 30,000 cells/well was chosen.

SH SY5Y cells seeded at 30,000 cells/well and grown for 24 hours before 
venom addition were sensitive to the cytopathic effects of all four venoms 
tested.

There appears to be a two-phase effect on this cell line  immediate death of 
cells followed by a more prolonged effect, the latter being best assessed after 
16-20 hours incubation.  Three of the four venoms showed a growth 
stimulating effect at low venom concentrations.  The cell line was most 
sensitive to E. ocellatus venom and least sensitive to N. nigricollis venom, 
under these conditions, in this experiment.

8.4.2.2 Venom cytotoxicity 
In this set of experiments (Table 8.4-10), which were repeated (Table 8.4-11 
and Figure 8.4-13), this cell line appears to be most sensitive to D. angusticeps 
venom (LC50 of 75ng/well).  The results appear to be highly variable, even 
within assay, shown by the wide CI95 bars in Figure 8.4-13

8.4.2.3 Venom neutralisation 
As with VERO cells, checkerboard assays were used to optimise venom 
concentration for the full assays (Table 8.4-12). Because of the wide 
variation in LC50 it was difficult to pick a suitable venom concentration for 
neutralisation assays. Neutral red was often, but not consistently, poorly 
absorbed by the cells.  Use of xCELLigence and visual inspection of plates 
before addition of NR showed that the cells were growing.

Table 8.4-13 shows results based on low absorbances. These results were 
consistent with visual inspection of the plates. There did not appear to be any 
neutralisation of the CPE of V. berus venom by ViperaVet in this cell line, and 
neutralisation of B. arietans venom by EchiTabPlus was only just over 50%. 
The other venoms were adequately neutralised by their antivenoms, but none 
achieved 100% of the control cell growth. The results are illustrated in Figure 
8.4-14 and Figure 8.4-15.

8.4.3 Co-culture venom cytotoxicity assays 
Venom cytotoxicity experiments were set up so that half of a 96 well plate was 
seeded with SH SY5Y cells and the other half with VERO cells.  The purpose 
of this experiment was to establish if there was a difference in the CPE of 
venoms on the two cell lines, and if this difference reflected the toxin 
composition of the venom. 
As well as the five venoms selected for this project other medically important 
venoms were tested.  These included cobra (Naja spp.) venoms, some of 
which were from spitting cobras (N. nigricollis and N. nubiae) and others from 
cobras with purely neurotoxic venom (N. nivea and N. haje). The results are 
summarised in Figure 8.4-16 and Figure 8.4-17.

Figure 8.4-17 CPE of elapid venoms on co-
cultures of VERO and SHSY5Y cells 
The results were variable between assays, particularly those for the SH SY5Y 
cells. The VERO cells were more sensitive to the CPE of viper venoms than 
SH SY5Y cells. Generally the converse was true of elapid venoms, although 
there was little difference between the minimal CPE of neurotoxic cobra 
venoms on the two cell lines. A complete set of results can be found in the 
Chapter supplement (vcn39-43). 
8.5 Venom-induced cellular overgrowth 
During early experiments it was observed that the percentage control cell 
growth increased beyond 100% initially, with increasing venom 
concentrations, followed by the expected fall associated with CPE.  Often there 
was a hump or oscillation of the curve before the maximum slope (e.g.   and 
Figure 8.4-17). To begin with, this was attributed to experimental error, but 
when the xCELLigence was first used the overgrowth of cells in low venom 
concentrations, compared to control cells grown in medium only, was 
confirmed. Figure 8.5-1 shows a V. berus venom (and V. latastei venom) LC50, 
using neutral red to detect VERO cell viability after 16h. This experiment was 
run concurrently with an xCELLigence experiment, using the same cell 
suspension and venom dilutions. The plot showing real-time growth of cells is 
shown in Figure 8.5-2 The overgrowth occurred with both cell lines studied 
and with different venoms with or without their antivenoms.

showed maximum growth at twice their LC50 dose. It is likely that the LC50 
selected for D. angusticeps venom was too high.  The oscillation of the curve 
prior to its linear maximum slope is also illustrated. 
The experiments which yielded the results illustrated here were performed for 
other reasons- these were merely incidental observations.

8.6 Discussion 
There is considerable diversity in venom composition, each species having a 
unique profile of toxins, enzymes and non-toxic proteins. There is also 
variation in venom composition between individuals from different localities 
and within individuals according to diet and age (Currier, 2012; Fry et al, 2009; 
Nunez et al, 2009). Each toxin has a specific target organ or chemical reaction 
(e.g. activation of clotting factors) through which it exerts its pathological effect.  
To date, the best means to determine if treatment (antivenom) effectively 
neutralises venom toxicity is using an in vivo model (Theakston et al, 2003).  
Antibodies may bind to their target, but they may not necessarily neutralise its 
pathological effect (Cook et al, 2010).  Cells are living entities, so by selecting 
a matrix of cell lines which are targeted by a venoms pathologically significant 
toxins, the hypothesis was that this could provide an in vitro alternative to in 
vivo testing of venom toxicity and antivenom efficacy. This is the first project 
to look at the cytotoxicity of such a diverse selection of snake venoms on 
multiple cell types.  A number of studies have studied cytotoxicity of venoms 
on multiple cell types (Butron et al; 1993; Gowda et al 1993; Gremski et al, 
2007) but this is thought to be the first study to investigate venom CPE using 
co-cultures of radically different cell lines.  
Treating cells with toxins can result in a number of outcomes, including 
cytolysis either via direct action on the cell membrane or secondary to cell 
necrosis; reduction of cell viability due to disruption of mitosis or metabolic 
pathways; or activation of genetically controlled cell death mechanisms 
(apoptosis) (Riss et al, 2004). Sensitivity to a toxin is partially dependent on 
the stage of the cell cycle (Riss et al, 2004), which may explain the time-
dependent variation in LC50 noted, particularly in cells grown in venom. VERO 
cells would appear to be more sensitive to venom toxins during their most rapid 
(log-phase) growth.  The two-phase response noted in the SH SY5Y cells 
could be explained by venom toxins causing immediate cell death by cytolysis, 
and other toxins switching on programmed cell death (apoptosis) via other 
mechanisms (Bradbury et al, 2000). 
Using alternative detection systems such as measurement of lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) would differentiate between detachment and lysis of 
cells and there are kits available to detect apoptosis. However, these methods 
are relatively expensive compared to neutral red and were therefore not used, 
but would be worth further investigation, particularly as an end point for the SH 
SY5Y cells.  
8.6.1 VERO cells 
All the venoms that were studied had a lethal CPE on this cell line, but much 
higher doses of N. nigricollis venom were required to produce its CPE.  The 
cells could either be grown in venom or venom added after 8-16h growth. 
Adding cells to the venom dilutions was easier than growing the cells to an 80-
90% confluent monolayer before venom addition.  However, variation of 
venom LC50, at a given time point, was much greater in assays when cells 
were added to venom. For this reason it was difficult to select a suitable venom 
LC50 for neutralisation assays  either the selected venom did not prevent cell 
growth at all or there was no growth in any of the venom/antivenom treated 
wells.  
The assay selected to demonstrate neutralisation of venom CPE used a seed 
rate that produced an 80-90% confluent monolayer after 16h to allow overnight 
growth prior to venom or venom/antivenom addition.  An end-point of 4h was 
selected, and viable cells were measured using the neutral red assay. LC50 
was selected as the measure of venom lethality on which venom dose for 
neutralisation assays was based to reflect the method used in in vivo lethality 
assays. It may have been better to have calculated the LC90 (90% cell death) 
as the dose for neutralisation assays.  
There may be a number of reasons why there was such a large variation in 
neutralisation of venom CPE.  Cells growing in flasks were harvested at 
different stages of growth for use in the assays, depending on availability. If 
possible, cells were harvested when the flasks were <100% confluent and 
therefore in log phase growth.  Sometimes flasks were slightly overgrown and 
these cells took longer to grow than those harvested when in log phase growth.  
This may explain why there was more variation in assays where cells were 
added to venom  cells allowed to grow overnight had time to switch on 
mitosis before venom was added. Venom is composed of multiple toxins and 
it may be that these toxins affect cells more or less at different phases of 
growth depending on their mechanism of action. Within and between assay 
variations were acceptable in experiments performed on the same day, using 
the same harvested cells, the same venom and AV dilutions. It may be that 
what is required is more rigorous control of cell growth, cell density and 
passage number  when using eternal cell lines, cell characteristics can 
change with increasing numbers of cell cycles, presumably due to mutations. 
8.6.2 SH SY5Y cells 
SH SY5Y cells are neuroblastoma cells, which are, amongst other properties, 
acetylcholinergic.  They were sensitive to the CPE of viper venoms and to D. 
angusticeps venom, but less so to that of the cobra venoms. D. angusticeps 
venom contains fasciculins, which are only found in mamba venoms and bind 
to muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (Lauridsden, 2016). It would be 
interesting to see if these toxins bind to SH SY5Y ACh receptors to produce 
the observed cytopathic effect. Neurotoxic cobra venoms contain -
neurotoxins, which exert their effect by binding to the postsynaptic ACh 
receptors, blocking activation and muscle contraction by endogenous ACh. 
The mechanism of action of cobra venoms on these cells was not elucidated, 
but is unlikely to have involved ACh receptors. The CPE of all the cobra 
venoms observed, in both cell lines studied, was much less than that of the 
viper or D. angusticeps venoms. Similar concentrations of Naja haje venom 
were used in a study in which the mechanism of action of venom induced cell 
death was examined; necrosis was detected by measuring lactate 
dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, and apoptosis by measuring a 
fluorescent apoptosis detection system in myoblaststs and human embryonic 
kidney cells (Omran et al, 2004). It was found that cell necrosis was acute, 
time and dose dependent, in both cell lines and that apoptosis may be 
dependent on concentration and/or time of exposure to snake venom (Omran 
et al, 2004) 
The CPE of all venoms, apart from V. berus venom, were neutralised by their 
homologous antivenom. This would suggest that ViperaVet did not neutralise 
the V. berus venom toxin(s) responsible for cell death in this cell line. 
ViperaVet did neutralise the effect of V. berus venom in VERO cells, which 
would suggest that the mechanism of cell death in the two cell lines is different 
and/or caused by a different toxin. It is also possible to hypothesise that the 
toxin responsible for cell death of SH SY5Y cells is poorly immunogenic since 
it is not neutralised by its homologous antivenom, possibly a low MW toxin 
such as a PLA2. 
Using the xCELLigence system, it was observed that there was a dual phase 
of cell death  an immediate drop in cell index (CI) followed by a more 
prolonged effect.  It is likely that the immediate effect is enzymatic (e.g. lysis 
of the cell membrane by PLA2s) and the more prolonged effect non-enzymatic 
(i.e. receptor-mediated). A dual phase of CPE was also observed using L929 
(fibroblast) cells and Vipera (Macrovipera) lebetina lebetina venom. In this 
study, the cell medium was refreshed 2 hours after venom addition, then the 
cell viability examined after 48 hours, using MTT.  This generated reproducible 
results which correlated with in vivo LD50 (Nalbantsoy et al, 2012).  
Results from these neuroblastoma cells were even more variable than for 
VERO cells, including within assay variation. One problem encountered was 
that the cells clumped, making performing an accurate cell count and 
subsequent homogenous seeding of plate wells difficult. Cells which had been 
grown sufficiently to differentiate were those which had the greatest tendency 
to clump. Discussion with other researchers who have worked with these cells 
confirms this observation. Cells which had differentiated were very slow to start 
dividing, but cells which were in log phase growth produced a sparse harvest 
which was insufficient for screening antivenoms. Viable cells had a poor 
uptake of neutral red dye, but the low absorbance results (% control cell 
growth) appeared to reflect their microscopic appearance. 
8.6.3 Co-culture experiments 
Generally VERO cells were more sensitive to viper venom toxicity and SH 
SY5Y cells more sensitive to elapid venom toxicity. Neurotoxic cobra venoms 
(N. haje and N. nivea) were not very toxic to either cell line. N. nigricollis venom 
was more toxic for SH SY5Y cells than for VERO cells, but had a relatively 
high LC50 compared to D. angusticeps venom. Clinically, N. nigricollis venom 
is cytotoxic, causing tissue necrosis around the bite site, but this was not 
reflected in its CPE on either cell line studied. 
8.6.4 Venom-induced cellular overgrowth 
Many of the venoms studied promote cell growth in excess of control cells. 
This was also observed when venom was incubated with lower dilutions of 
antivenom (more antivenom/well)  effectively mimicking low venom 
concentration. In the checkerboard antivenom EC50 experiments, the effect 
appeared to be maximal at 2x venom LC50. 
It was also noted that at low venom concentrations the growth curve oscillated 
before the linear fall in cell growth.  Mathematically this reflects the conflict 
between stimulation of cell growth and lethal CPE of other venom toxins (Dr D 
R Bolton, personal communication). 
Venoms frequently contain low levels of growth factors  vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) (Takahashi et al, 2004) and nerve growth factor (NGF) 
(Angeletti, 1970). It is possible that these are responsible for stimulation of cell 
growth, but other venom components could also play a part.  
8.6.5 Implementation of cell-based assays into QC testing of AV 
Assays for assessment of antivenom EC50 using VERO cells were optimised 
for quality assessment of two antivenoms, namely ViperaVet (directed against 
four Vipera spp., including V. berus venom) and EchiTabG (directed against 
E. ocellatus venom). However, the coefficient of variation of assays performed 
at different time points was in excess of 50% (results not shown), so the assays 
have not been adopted as part of routine quality control (QC) testing of these 
antivenom.   
One study showed that when the medium on the cells was refreshed 2 hours 
after venom addition and cell viability examined after 48 hours reproducible 
results were generated, which correlated with in vivo LD50 results (Nalbantsoy 
et al, 2012). 
8.7 Conclusions 
All the venoms studied produced a cytopathic effect on the selected two cell 
lines, and showed selectivity that may be expected according to their toxin 
composition.  However, the assays require further optimization to improve their 
repeatability before they could be recommended for use as part of QC 
testing.of antivenoms. This would include optimisation of cell growth to 
minimise variation due to using cells at different stages of the cell cycle. It may 
be possible at this stage to use cell based assays to confirm neutralisation of 
lethal venom toxins and thus reduce the need for in vivo testing.  
The neuroblastoma cells were too difficult to grow and handle for general use 
as a screen for antivenom efficacy, but have proved useful in differentiating 
between the effects of neurotoxic venoms and those which do not contain 
neurotoxins.   
Cell based assays only respond to toxins with target receptors on the cell line 
used, or damage the cell membrane, leading to lysis and cell death (e.g. PLA2s 
may hydrolyse the membrane phospholipids). Cell based assays are unable 
to detect the venom toxins which promote or inhibit enzymatic reactions 
occurring in extracellular compartments. Examples of such reactions include 
the clotting cascade, hydrolysis of vascular endothelial basement membranes 
or connective tissue components. 
I believe that it is unlikely that, even using a matrix of cell types, an in vivo 
model could be completely replaced by cell-based assays but that they could 
be used to further reduce the need for in vivo testing by demonstrating 
neutralisation of the venom CPE. 
Chapter 9. Discussion and Conclusions 
9.1 Introduction 
Snakebite poses a challenge as a tropical medical emergency because the 
treatment is complicated by the severe and diverse pathological lesions 
consequent to envenoming by snakes whose venom composition varies 
taxonomically, ontogenetically and geographically.  
The present gold standard tests of antivenom efficacy are the WHO-
recommended LD50 and ED50 murine assays. Their duration is 24 to 48 hours, 
depending upon the route of administration, and the metric is death. These 
assays are of the highest severity in terms of pain, distress and harm inflicted 
on their subjects. In an age of increasing concern for animal welfare, it is 
imperative that methods of assessing antivenom efficacy are found which 
reduce the severity of these assays. It is equally imperative that 3R-modified 
preclinical antivenom efficacy protocols remain sufficiently robust to detect 
ineffective antivenoms and avoid disasters such as those previously described 
(Visser et al, 2008; Alirol et al, 2015),   
In that report, Visser described that their clinical success in managing 
snakebite victims using FAV Afrique antivenom declined dramatically when 
they switched to using Asna C antivenom, manufactured in India and that 
retailed at one tenth the price of FAV Afrique. Vissers team were alarmed at 
the increased case fatality (from 1.2% to 12.5%) of patients treated with Asna 
C, despite administering many more vials. The immunogen for the Indian Asna 
C was the Asian saw-scaled viper, Echis carinatus, and not the West African 
saw-scaled viper, E. ocellatus. Our own preclinical antivenom-efficacy 
analyses demonstrated that an antivenom manufactured for the African E. 
ocellatus saw-scaled viper was ineffective at neutralising the lethal effects of 
venom from the Asian saw-scaled viper E. carinatus sochureki (Casewell et 
al, 2010). This indicates that preclinical analysis would have likely identified 
the venom-neutralising inefficacy of Asna C and used as evidence to reject its 
use in human victims.  
The work presented in this thesis has addressed the need to reduce pain and 
suffering inflicted on the experimental mice used to determine venom toxicity 
and antivenom efficacy by testing and implementing several 3R interventions 
into these assays.  
To illustrate the 3R benefit of these modified preclinical antivenom efficacy 
protocols, I have devised a hypothetical test case wherein antivenoms locally 
available in Chad are tested for their ability to neutralise the lethal effects of 
venoms from the countrys most medically-important snakes. In this test case 
I compare the hypothetical cost to mice of the current WHO and the 3R-
modified LSTM preclinical protocols.   
9.2 Hypothetical testing of the efficacy of antivenom to treat 
envenoming in a sub-Saharan African country  Chad 
9.2.1 Determination of venomous snake threat in Chad 
The most medically important snakes in Chad are described by the WHO and

scaled or carpet viper) and Cerastes cerastes (Horned Viper), 
Elapids: Naja nigricollis (black-necked spitting cobra), Naja haje (Egyptian 
cobra), Naja pallida (Red spitting cobra), Naja nubiae (nubian spitting 
cobra) and Naja katiensis (West African brown spitting cobra)

From these antivenoms, those which are potentially effective at neutralising

namely E. ocellatus, B. arietans, N. nigricollis and N. haje, are selected.

India central African, Asna antivenom C, EchiTabPlus-ICP and Inoserp sub-

9.2.3 Establishing in vivo venom toxicity (LD50) for the most medically 
important snakes in Chad 
The first stage of this hypothetical study is to characterise venom toxicity. 
Literature searching may provide LD50 data for some species, but not for the 
Chad geographical variants. Since interspecific venom toxicity can vary by 
geographical origin of the snakes, it is vital that national venom standards are 
established as a priority (Harrison & Gutierrez, 2016). 
The WHO-recommended tests of venom toxicity start with preliminary range-
finding assays with 2 mice/venom dose group (Meier et al, 1986). The LSTM 
protocol includes the use of analgesia (Chapter 5) and humane endpoints 
(HEPs) (Chapter 6), allowing a substantial reduction in assay duration from 24 
to 7 hours. Post mortem examination, the pathology-survival score (PSS) 
(Chapter 7), in combination with HEPs and intensive pre mortem observations 
allows the use of staging (Chapter 6), thus reducing the number of doses in 
the range finding assay from 10 to 6 and in the full LD50 from 6 to 5, for each 
venom  a saving of 13 mice/venom and 941 mouse hours (number of mice 
x duration of assay) of pain, distress and suffering (Table 9.2-2). Results 
shown in Chapters 5 and 6 demonstrate that these changes may be 
implemented without vitiating statistical validity.

9.2.4 In vitro assessment of antivenom binding 
Snake venom proteins include enzymes, toxins and non-toxic proteins, some 
of which act synergistically (Petras et al, 2016). When adding antivenom to 
this toxic mix, binding does not always equate to neutralisation of venom 
toxicity (Cook et al, 2010c), which gives rise to a conundrum when attempting 
to devise a one-fits-all method to assess preclinical venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy. However, poor binding is synonymous with failure of 
neutralisation, and therefore binding assays are an important step in rejecting 
ineffective antivenoms prior to testing in vivo efficacy. In Chapter 4, a close 
correlation between in vitro binding by and in vivo efficacy of an antivenom is 
demonstrated, adding credence to the hypothesis that an antivenom which 
effectively neutralises venom pathogenesis will also bind well to that venom. 
Chapter 3 highlights the variation in interactions between venoms and 
antivenoms and that there is a poor correlation between in vitro assays when 
all venom/antivenom combinations were considered together, but that there 
was a more significant, but venom-specific correlation between these assays 
when each venom was considered separately.  
In this test case, a routine ELISA was performed to assess the IgG titre of each 
antivenom to each snake venom. The IgG titre results of the SAIMR polyvalent 
were used to set the approve/reject decision making for subsequent ED50 
assays of antivenom efficacy.   
Table 9.2-3: WHO tests of venom/antivenom binding  these tests may be used on all 
possible antivenom candidates, here 6 antivenoms are selected for hypothetical 
testing.

In the test case, the ELISA results indicated that one of the six antivenoms 
showed considerably less binding to one or more of the WHO category 1 
snakes and is therefore rejected, leaving 5 antivenoms to assess for in vivo 
potency (ED50). 
9.2.5 WHO tests of antivenom efficacy, ED50 
Range finding experiments are strongly recommended and, like the LD50 
experiments, using 2 animals per antivenom dose, thus reducing the number 
of mice required for the full ED50. The WHO protocol instructs that 2x to 5x the 
venom LD50 dose is used, where possible, the latter dose being preferable; the 
range finding experiment provides evidence that the selected venom dose is 
sufficient to kill all the mice but is not overwhelmingly lethal, even at the highest 
dose of antivenom. 
As well as a reduction in the numbers of mice required for the full ED50, the 
LSTM protocols include measures which result in a further reduction in 
numbers of mice required, as well as refinements which reduce suffering 
endured by the mice (Table 9.2-4), as detailed in Section 9.2.3. In this case, 
there is a total saving of 585 mice and a reduction of 40,010 mouse hours of 
pain and suffering endured.  
Once the ED50s have been completed, the most effective antivenoms can be 
selected for pre-clinical dose finding and safety studies (Abubakar, S.B et al, 
2010) followed by a clinical trial (Abubakar I.S. et al, 2010).

The overall benefit of the 3R interventions used in this scenario are shown in

antivenoms against venoms from Kenya, the results of which are included in 
a publication in progress (Harrison et al).

9.2.6 Significance of Output of new LSTM Gold Standard preclinical 
antivenom testing protocol 
The approach illustrated in this hypothetical scenario would define the most 
preclinically effective available antivenom, providing the government with the 
critical data required to reject importation of ineffective antivenoms and 
therefore avoid situations such as that which occurred in Ghana (Visser et al, 
2008).  
Because this approach has identified the most effective antivenom for Chad, 
the LSTM gold standard approach can be used to test all new antivenoms, at 
a much reduced consumption of and suffering in mice. A summary of the 3Rs 
output and savings in terms of percentage reductions, both in the use of and 
suffering endured by mice, of LSTM preclinical testing protocols is shown in 
Table 9.2-6.  
The WHO seeks to establish venom standards from numerous regions in 
Africa (Harrison & Gutierrez, 2016). Using the modified LSTM 3Rs protocol, 
and assuming that venom standards are to be established in two countries in 
each of West, Central, East and South Africa and that there are 9 medically 
important snakes in each of these countries, a total of 92 venoms, this would 
equate to a reduction of 8,424 mice and 610 x 103 mouse hours of suffering, 
as well as the degree of suffering being reduced by the use of analgesia from 
severe to moderate. When antivenom efficacy for each of these countries is 
also assessed, as described, this equates to a further saving of 42,120 mice 
(a total of 50,544 mice) and 3,041 x 103 mouse hours of suffering (a total of 
3,651 x 103). This figure is in excess of the annual estimated usage (>30,000) 
of mice to routinely batch test existing antivenoms.

Further reductions in the consumption of mice required to ensure that 
subsequent batches of the most effective antivenom retain their activity can 
be made by using a binding assay to monitor the quality. Any change in 
binding, antiserum source, manufacturing process would indicate the need for 
an in vivo ED50 (Chapter 4).   
9.3 Interventions used in the LSTM Gold Standard 
preclinical antivenom testing protocol 
The results presented in Chapter 5 would suggest that opiate analgesia may 
be incorporated into murine lethality testing of venom toxicity and antivenom 
efficacy.  We have shown that morphine is effective at alleviating pain in these 
assays, and can be successfully administered, if required, as an oral top up 
dose, without adversely affecting assay results. There are, however, important 
caveats to be considered: 
 There is some evidence that there may be discrepancies in assay 
results for some venoms, and therefore the incorporation of 
analgesia into LD50 and ED50 protocols must be investigated and 
validated for each venom studied 
 The use of analgesia in regulatory preclinical testing of antivenoms 
must be validated and new acceptance criteria established 
 Morphine is not universally freely available for research purposes, 
therefore there is a need to investigate the use of other opiate 
analgesics such as Tramadol (Chacon et al, 2016) 
This work has successfully established humane endpoints for assays involving 
the venoms and antivenoms studied, requiring skilled observation, an in depth 
knowledge and/or experience of the likely venom pathological lesions of the 
species being studied in the experimental subjects used (Chapter 6). Pilot 
studies should be used to link observations which would allow a humane 
endpoint and death of that individual to be linked in a small number of animals; 
post mortem pathological lesions would corroborate the validity of such an 
endpoint. 
Observations defined to establish humane endpoints can also be used to 
predict survival of individuals in each dose group and therefore allow selection 
of the next most appropriate dose group to complete the LD50 or ED50 assay, 
once again reducing the number of mice used. 
As discussed in Chapter 7, post mortem pathological lesions is a means of 
defining toxicity of each venom and is a means of ensuring that potentially 
lethal or harmful pathological lesions are neutralised. 
Each in vitro method has a place in defining venom-antivenom interaction: 
Western blotting demonstrating which venom toxins are bound by antivenom; 
end-point or 50% binding ELISA for screening large numbers of samples; 
avidity ELISA identifying the strength of venom-antivenom binding; small scale 
affinity chromatography (SSAC) yielding a result directly comparable with the 
sample total protein concentration; the reverse of SSAC,  antivenomics 
identifying which venom components fail to bind to antivenom. 
Cytotoxicity assays were investigated as a possible replacement for in vivo 
assays (Chapter 8), the hypothesis being that cytotoxicity neutralisation is 
synonymous with neutralisation of the lethal effects of venom (Nalbantsoy et 
al, 2012). However, a number of problems were encountered: cell lines were 
selected to reflect venom toxin target tissues and, indeed, all five venoms (and 
many more  results not shown) studied produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) 
in both cell lines selected, and initial co-culture experiments demonstrated a 
predilection of neurotoxic venoms for neural cells and of viper venoms for 
epithelial-type cells. The cytopathic effect was very variable between 
experiments, making optimisation of neutralisation assays problematic. 
Variable results were compounded by the unexpected growth-promoting 
effects of low venom concentrations and by the sticky nature of the neural 
cells used. In addition, the CPE of these simple cytotoxicity assays did not 
demonstrate the physiologically induced consequences of venom toxins on 
host systems such as the coagulation cascade, destruction of structural 
extracellular matrix proteins, or inflammatory mediator release. It was 
concluded that, in their present form, cell-based assays cannot replicate the 
complexities of a living organism and the multiplicity of extracellular and 
intravascular cascade reactions which, once started, cannot be reversed by 
administration of antivenom. However, it is possible that future optimisation of 
cell-based assays could be used to substantially reduce the number of animals 
required for in vivo efficacy testing.  
9.4 Reductions arising from post-mortem observations 
The WHO guidelines state that venom toxicity and its neutralisation should 
extend beyond that of lethality to include local tissue necrosis, haemorrhage, 
clotting, defibrinogenation and myolysis. The use of additional animals to 
perform these assays could be obviated by the use of post mortem 
examinations and collection of relevant samples from mice used in lethality 
assays. Cardiac puncture immediately following euthanasia can be used to 
identify coagulopathies; a 20 minute whole blood clotting test should be 
performed, as a minimum, progressing to measurement of fibrin/fibrinogen, 
clotting factors and blood counts. Gross muscle damage can be identified and 
further characterised histologically.  Similarly, renal or other organ biopsies 
may be examined histologically. These examinations could be further 
enhanced by location of venom or venom/antivenom complexes using 
secondary antibodies on tissue biopsies. Pathological examination has the 
potential to greatly enhance and maximise the information obtained from each 
experiment. 
In conclusion, LSTMs Alistair Reid Venom Research (ARVRU) was 
instrumental in establishing a system for measuring venom toxicity and 
antivenom efficacy. This system was quickly adopted by the WHO and 
numerous national and regional pharmacopeias to ensure that only effective 
antivenoms are approved for treating human victims.  
Cognisant of the cost to mice, ARVRU has a history of researching in vitro 
alternatives (Sells et al) to the in vivo assays. The results of this thesis 
illustrates ARVRUs continued commitment to maximising the important 
outputs of preclinical analysis of antivenom efficacy whilst minimising the cost 
to mice.

The second major area of work to be done is the further analysis of samples 
and data collected in addition to that presented here. 
There is a library of fixed samples collected from mice subjected to a variety 
of venoms, the gross pathology of which is described in Chapter 7, which are 
available for histopathology.  The use of special staining techniques, including 
labelled antibodies to venom, antivenom or complexes, or products of 
pathological processes would contribute greatly to the understanding of the 
pathogenesis of envenomation, and the pharmacokinetics of systemic 
envenoming and its treatment  
The sheer volume of data generated during this project has been 
overwhelming and therefore there is scope for further analysis, particularly of 
data relating to the pathological profile of mice subjected to venom/antivenom 
compared to that of venom alone. Used in conjunction with antivenomics, this 
could lead to identification of relevant antivenom deficiencies, and ultimately 
to the production of more effective products. 
10.3 Expansion of the data base 
Expansion of the data base to include more venoms and venom/antivenom 
combinations to strengthen the validity of conclusions drawn from the 
presented results. 
10.4 Cytotoxicity assays 
Results of cytotoxicity assays showed an unacceptable variability as a means of 
replacing the present in vivo LD50 and ED50. However, this platform has the potential 
to reduce the need for in vivo testing, both for systemic and localised envenoming. 
One possibility that warrants further investigation is an assay to assess haemorrhage 
due to the destruction of basement membrane structural proteins using plate well 
inserts lined with a collagen membrane, having a similar structure to the blood vessel 
basement mebrane, with or without endothelial cells. Indicator cells are grown in the 
well below the insert. The indicator cells are bathed in medium alone, and venom 
added to the medium of the insert. The cultures are incubated and the CPE of 
indicator cells assessed  destruction of the in vitro blood vessel would indicate the 
haemorrhagic potential of the venom. 
The use of 3D skin (Chapman et al, 2014) or corneal cells potentially provide a model 
for the investigation of localised envenoming. The 3D skin model may be used to 
assess damage to inter-cellular connections and the formation of vesicles. Corneal 
cells are presently being used to compare the cytotoxic effecofts of venom from 
spitting and non-spitting cobras (LSTM, work in progress). 
10.5 Growth enhancing effect of venom 
One finding in the cytotoxicity experiments which merits further investigation is that of 
venom-induced growth promotion. The presence of increased mitotic figures in the 
livers of mice, which had effectively been subjected to low doses of venom (venom 
plus antivenom), poses the question as to whether this latter observation is related to 
the former.

Abstract 
Medically important venomous snakes in Western Europe are Vipera 
ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus and V. latastei.  Envenomation of dogs and 
other animals by these snakes receives limited attention despite the relative 
frequency and potential mortality and morbidity.  This reflects, in part, the lack 
of a dedicated veterinary antivenom.  Successful antivenoms are derived from 
antisera containing high levels of specific polyclonal antibodies that bind to, 
and neutralise, all the toxins present.  This requires a careful choice of 
immunogen, animals and immunisation schedule.  We detected proteomic 
variation in the venoms of V. ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus and V. latastei by 
SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.  Consequently, we used a mixture containing 
equal amounts of venom from these species to immunise a flock of sheep.  We 
demonstrate that immunisation resulted in antisera containing high levels of 
specific antibodies directed against the majority of toxic components found in 
all four snake venoms using immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) and small scale affinity chromatography assays.  The latter 
shows that all 25 sheep responded quickly and maintained high levels of 
specific antibodies throughout the 2 year period of study.  This ensures a 
consistent starting material for the manufacture of a reproducible veterinary 
antivenom, ViperaVet.  Our next objectives are to purify the antibodies from 
our antisera and demonstrate their pre-clinical neutralising efficacy in murine 
animal studies prior to undertaking a clinical trial in envenomed patients. 
Introduction 
The medically-important venomous European snakes belong predominantly 
to the genus Vipera (Serpentes: Viperidae) and are often referred to as adders.  
Whilst only V. berus is found in the United Kingdom and the Nordic countries, 
V. aspis and V. ammodytes have a wide distribution throughout Central and/or 
Western Europe (Persson, 1995; Garrigues, and others, 2005; World Health 
Organisation, 2010).  An additional species, V. latastei is distributed 
throughout Spain and Portugal (Saz-Parkinson, and others, 2012).  Whilst 
these snakes are relatively small in size they are of medical importance to both 
humans and animals due to their toxic venom, which exhibit proteolytic, 
fibrinolytic, anticoagulant and other effects (Ferquel, and others, 2007; 
Georgieva, and others, 2008; Sanz, and others, 2008).  In the event of 
systemic envenoming, these venom toxins can induce severe hypotension, 
and myonecrotic, haemorrhagic, cardiotoxic and/or neurotoxic pathological 
lesions (Calderon, and others, 1993; Persson, 1995;Warrell, 2005; Ferquel, 
and others, 2007; Luksic, and others, 2008). 
The incidence of human envenomation by European adders ranges from 
4,000 to 20,000 cases per year with an estimated 50  130 deaths (Gonzalez, 
1991; Kastaturiratne, and others, 2008; Chippaux, 2012). The incidence in 
animals is potentially thirty times higher (Mirtschin, and others, 1998) with a 
significantly higher mortality rate of 3.5 to 14% (Kangstrom, 1989; Aroch & 
Harrus, 1999; Segev, and others, 2004; Anlen, 2008). The primary victims are 
dogs, which are generally bitten on the face or legs (Aroch & Harrus, 1999; 
Campbell, 2000; Willey & Schaer, 2005; Lervic, and others, 2010; Sutton, and 
others, 2012).  The UK Veterinary Poisons Information Service (VPIS) strongly 
recommends that veterinarians administer human antivenom to animals with 
systemic envenoming since no veterinary product is currently available 
(Campbell, 2000; Sutton, and others, 2011, Bates & Warrell, 2013). 
The ideal antivenom, whether for humans or animals, should be safe, effective, 
exhibit batch reproducibility and be accessible and affordable. To address the 
need for a veterinary antivenom in Europe (Campbell, 2008), MicroPharm Ltd 
has begun the development of an ovine-derived product for canine use. A key 
requirement is the availability of large volumes of antisera which contain 
substantial amounts of high avidity polyclonal antibodies that bind to and 
neutralise the main toxic components of the relevant venoms.  To this end, 
sheep were immunised with a mixture comprising equal amounts of four 
Vipera snake venoms (V. ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus, and V. latastei) to 
account for any potential inter-species variation in venom composition 
(Casewell, and others, 2009). In this paper we demonstrate that the ovine flock 
produced antisera which binds the major toxic components of all four venoms, 
and that the antisera contain high levels of specific antibodies from six weeks 
post-immunisation throughout the two year period of study. A large number of 
consistent pools of antisera have been collected from which an antivenom, 
ViperaVet, may be manufactured. 
Materials and Methods 
Ethical approval 
All work involving the use of live animals was carried out under licensed 
approval by the UK Home Office and approved by an internal ethical 
committee. 
Immunisation 
A flock of 25 crossbred sheep were immunised with a preparation containing 
a 1:1:1:1 (by weight) mixture of V. ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus and V. 
latastei venoms (Latoxan, France).  The lyophilised venoms were 
reconstituted to a concentration of 2g/L in 0.9% saline before being 
mechanically mixed at a ratio of 1:5 (v/v) with either Freunds complete 
(primary immunisation) or Freunds incomplete (all subsequent 
immunisations) adjuvant until a stable emulsion was formed.  Each sheep was 
immunised with a total of 5mL of the solution (2mg venom/sheep) into six 
different sites by subcutaneous injection.  The injection sites were chosen for 
their proximity to the axillary, inguinal and prescapular drainage lymph nodes.  
Immunisations were carried out every four weeks for a period of 108 weeks, 
and blood was collected two weeks after each immunisation, beginning six 
weeks after the primary immunisation.   
Approximately 10mL of blood per kg body weight was collected via the jugular 
vein into a sterile, pyrogen-free 1L bag, which was weighed to allow the 
volume of blood to be estimated. The bags were rotated for 30 minutes to 
accelerate clotting then centrifuged at 4733g for 20 minutes.  The serum was 
removed, pooled, samples taken for assessment and then frozen for storage 
at -20oC. 
Assessment of antisera 
Aliquots of pooled antisera were assessed using the following methods: 
SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting 
Lyophilised V. ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus and V. latastei venoms used 
were reconstituted to 1g/L in a non-reduced protein loading buffer (PLOB). 
Then 10g of each was subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel 
electrophoresis using a 15% gel with a 200V potential difference across the 
plate. The resultant proteins were visualised using Coomassie Blue R-250 
stain and photographed using a BioRad gel imager. 
To assess the binding specificity of antibodies to the different venom 
components, the four venoms were run separately by gel electrophoresis and 
the proteins electro-blotted onto a 0.45 m nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad) 
using the manufacturers protocol and a 100V potential difference applied 
across the plate; confirmation of transfer was visualised by reversible staining 
with Ponceau S.  Subsequently the membrane was blocked by incubation 
overnight at 4oC using 5% non-fat milk in TBST (0.01M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5; 0.15M 
NaCl; 1% Tween 20).  The membranes were then washed with TBST four 
times over 60 minutes and incubated for three hours with antisera, which had 
been diluted 1:2000 (v/v) in blocking buffer.  Pre-immune serum (PIS) diluted 
1:2000 (v/v) was used as a negative control.  After incubation, the membranes 
were washed again with TBST and incubated for two hours with a 1:5000 (v/v) 
dilution of secondary antibody (donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to 
horseradish peroxidase, (Sigma)) in blocking buffer.  After a final washing step 
with TBST, the bands were visualised by adding DAB substrate (50mg 3,3-
diaminobenzidine, 100ml PBS and 0.024% hydrogen peroxide: (Sigma)). 
Indirect ELISA 
Ninety six well ELISA plates (Immulon 4BX, Thermo-Fisher) were coated with 
2mg/L of Vipera venom (either a 1:1:1:1 mixture or individual venoms) in 0.1M 
carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and incubated at 37oC for 2 hours and then at 4oC 
overnight.  The plates were then washed three times with assay washing buffer 
(AWB - 0.01M sodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.5; 0.15M NaCl; 0.01% 
Thiomersol w/v and 0.1% v/v Tween 20).  The antisera, a reference antisera 
sample (positive control) and PIS (negative control) were diluted 1:1000 (v/v) 
in AWB, added to the first row on the plate followed by subsequent serial 
doubling dilutions. The plates were then incubated at 37oC for one hour and 
washed with AWB.  The secondary antibody (donkey anti-sheep IgG HRP) 
was diluted to 1:500 (v/v) in AWB and added to the plate before incubation at 
37oC for one hour.  Following washing the results were visualised by the 
addition of substrate (10mg o-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride (OPD) in 
100mL citrate buffer - containing 0.015% hydrogen peroxide- at pH 5.0) and 
the optical density (OD) measured at 492nm using an Optimax micro-plate 
reader.  The EC50 is described as the dilution of antisera resulting in 50% of 
maximum binding. Inter-assay variation was compensated for by comparison 
to the reference antisera sample. The reference sample showed inter-assay 
variation with a mean EC50 dilution of 43,000 (standard deviation (SD), 
22,000; coefficient of variation, 50%).  This variation was compensated for by 
using a reference pool of antisera and adjusting the dilution titre of 50% 
maximum binding, using an EC50 dilution titre of 40,000 for the reference 
sample and the formula: 
Sc = (Rc x S)/R 
Where Sc is the corrected EC50 sample dilution, Rc, the corrected EC50 
reference dilution (40,000), S is the measured EC50 sample dilution and R the 
measured EC50 reference dilution.Small scale affinity purification 
(SSACSSAC) 
A technique based on affinity chromatography was used to measure the 
specific antibody concentration (Smith, and others, 1992; Casewell, and 
others, 2010).  Vipera venom (5mg of either the 1:1:1:1 mixture or individual 
venoms) was first coupled to 1g of CNBr-activated 4 Fast Flow sepharose gel 
(BioRad, UK) and placed in a small chromatography column.  The matrix was 
washed with 10 column volumes (35mL) of PBW (0.01M sodium hydrogen 
phosphate; 0.5M NaCl, pH 7.5).  One mL of antisera was added to the column, 
mixed with the gel and left to incubate at room temperature on an end over 
end mixer for 2 hours.  The unbound fraction was subsequently washed off 
with 35mL of PBW.  The bound antibodies were eluted with 20mL 0.1M glycine 
HCl, pH 2.5 and collected for the measurement of optical density (OD) at 
280nm, using an ultra violet lamp. Finally, the column was re-equilibrated with 
35mL of PBW and stored at 4oC until further use.  The specific antibody 
concentration (SAbC) was calculated using the formula:      
SAbC = (A x V)/( S x E) 
Where A is the OD, V is the volume of the eluate, S is the sample volume and 
E is the extinction co-efficient for ovine IgG (1.5) (Curd, and others, 1971). 
Results 
A flock of 25 sheep was immunised four weekly, as described, for a period of 
two years.  Blood was harvested two weeks after every immunisation, resulting 
in a total volume of more than 300L of antisera.  The specific antibody content 
of each pool of serum, as well as samples from individual sheep at 6, 10, 18, 
50, 74, 90 and 110 weeks post primary immunisation, were assessed by 
ELISA (from week 18) and SSAC. 
The non-reduced SDS-PAGE venom profiles reveal inter-specific variation in 
both molecular mass and quantitative representation (intensity of staining) of 
the proteins present in the venom of the four Vipera species (Figure 1A).  The 
immunoblot shows that the Vipera antisera binds to all the major fractions from 
all four species of snake (Figure 1B), but that normal sheep serum shows no 
detectable binding to any of the venom proteins (Figure 1C). 
Assessment of antisera by ELISA showed that there was considerable 
variation between the antisera raised in individual sheep but the mean 
antibody levels remained surprisingly steady throughout the 110 weeks of the 
study (Figure 2).  Prior to the final bleed, the five poorest responding sheep 
were removed from the flock, thus improving the specific antibody levels in the 
resulting pooled serum, as evidenced by the rise in the final data point at 110 
weeks (Figure 2).  Importantly we demonstrate that the Vipera antisera exhibit 
equally high levels of binding to the four venoms and the 1:1:1:1 mixture (Table 
The mean specific antibody concentration (SAbC) of the Vipera antisera 
measured by SSACSSAC, was 6.2g/L, (SD, 0.47g/L; coefficient of variation, 
 10%).  The SAbC of individual sheep samples varied considerably over the 
study period, exhibiting a range of 1.82 -13.68 g/L.  Despite this, the SAbC of 
the pooled antisera collected from the whole flock remained remarkably 
constant with a range of 4.02 - 7.81 g/L; (mean, 5.80 g/L; SD  1.12 g/L) 
(Figures 2 and 3). At 14 weeks after primary immunisation there were high 
levels of specific antibodies to all four individual Vipera venoms as well as to 
the mix of venoms.   
Discussion 
The four major medically-important snakes found throughout Western Europe 
belong to the genus Vipera, and include the only venomous snake found in the 
UK, the European adder (V. berus). Although mortality rates in both man and 
animals are low, envenoming by these snakes can result in significant 
morbidity and prolonged recovery.  The British VPIS receive in excess of 100 
snake-bite-related enquiries per annum (Sutton, and others, 2011). However, 
personal discussions with veterinarians suggest that the incidence of 
snakebite envenoming in the UK is likely to be much greater, (perhaps as high 
as eight times this figure).  The only specific treatment for snake-bite 
envenomation is antivenom, but recently, the ability of UK veterinarians to 
purchase human European adder antivenom has become increasingly 
difficult, leading MicroPharm Ltd to decide to introduce a veterinary antivenom 
for the treatment of dogs envenomed by Vipera spp. throughout Europe. 
As mentioned previously, the ideal antivenom should be safe, effective, stable, 
affordable and reproducible from batch to batch.  The key to achieving these 
targets is the production of antisera containing high levels of specific 
antibodies, which bind to and neutralise all the toxic components in the 
venoms of the target species of snake. The first critical step in the production 
of antisera is the choice of immunogen against which the antibodies will be 
directed.  Venom composition varies between individual snakes, and also in 
the same individual depending on its age, diet and other environmental factors 
(Chippaux, and others, 1991).  It is vital to use venom sourced from accurately 
identified snakes of medically-relevant species, captured from areas within 
which victims of envenomation are likely to require treatment. The husbandry 
and health of these individuals should be of a high standard to enable regular 
milking of venom, which may be pooled and lyophilised for antivenom 
production (World Health Organisation, 2010).   
Horses have traditionally been the serum donor of choice due to the large 
volume of serum that can be obtained from an individual at any one time.  
However, in the UK sheep are generally used because they are widely 
available and relatively inexpensive to purchase and maintain, and their serum 
has a much less pronounced localised reaction at the injection sites than 
horses (Landon & Smith, 2003). Ovine immunoglobulin (IgG) is also less 
glycosylated than equine IgG and it has been postulated that this is therefore 
less likely to produce a hypersensitivity reaction in the recipient (Sjostrom, and 
others,1994).  In addition, sheep are a more acceptable choice in the UK 
where animal welfare is an emotive issue, especially concerning companion 
animals.  
The results of our immunisation strategy, which incorporates a methodology 
refined over many years of antivenom production to stimulate maximum 
antibody responses (Landon & Smith, 2003), are illustrated by the results of 
our immunological assays.  Immunoblotting (Figure 1) demonstrated that all 
major toxic proteins in the four snake venoms used to immunise the flock of 
sheep were bound by the resultant antisera, but not by normal sheep serum.  
This result was reflected in the high level of binding measured by ELISA and 
of specific antibody concentrations measured by SSAC in both individual 
venoms and the mixture (Table 1).  Moreover, the level of binding shown by 
all three assays was comparable across the four species of venom. 
We were also able to demonstrate that, despite considerable variation in the 
specific antibody levels of individual sheep, the pooled flocks serum remained 
remarkably constant (Figure 2). One experiment showed that serum pooled 
from any ten sheep in the flock had a similar SAbC to that of the whole flock 
(data not shown), indicating that using multiple individuals has a buffering 
effect on individual fluctuations of antibody production and thus provides a 
consistent starting material for antivenom manufacture.  This is an additional 
benefit to utilising ovines for antisera production  typically fewer animals are 
immunised during the production of equine antivenoms so that any individual 
variation in antibody response is likely to be more pronounced.  
Importantly, the results of our SSAC assay with Vipera antisera are 
comparable to those of highly efficacious and safe human antivenoms.  A flock 
of sheep immunised with V. berus venom had a pooled serum SAbC which 
ranged from 7.6  15.6 g/L over a period of 54 weeks (Smith, and others, 
1992).  The resultant affinity-purified antivenom manufactured from this 
antiserum for human use showed highly satisfactory results in preclinical in 
vivo murine ED50 assays (Smith, and others, 1992) and clinical trials showed 
that this antivenom was safe and effective in counteracting the effects of V. 
berus envenoming in human victims (Karlson-Stiber, 1997).  Antisera from 
sheep immunised with Echis ocellatus (African Saw-scaled viper) venom 
showed a similar rapid response, demonstrated by ELISA and SSAC.  After 6 
weeks the pooled antisera from the flock showed a consistently high SAbC, 
ranging from 11-15g/L, over the 16 month period of study (Laing, and others, 
1995).  A later study showed that preclinical testing of purified IgG from this 
antisera neutralised the toxic effects of E. ocellatus venom in mice (Casewell, 
and others, 2010) and subsequent clinical trials confirmed its safety and 
efficacy in human victims (Abubakar, and others, 2010).  The successful 
translation of these antisera into safe and effective antivenoms would predict 
that our antisera shows great promise as a starting material for an antivenom 
which is both safe and effective. However, it is imperative that the pre-clinical 
efficacy of an antivenom is demonstrated prior to use in clinical patients, as 
successful immunological cross-reactivity does not necessarily equate to 
neutralisation of the pathological effects of venom in vivo.  At present the gold 
standard test of antivenom efficacy is the World Health Organisation approved 
murine effective dose 50 (ED50) assay. Therefore prior to marketing approval, 
the safety and efficacy of ViperaVet must be demonstrated in a clinical trial. 
Consequently, the next stage of development for this antivenom is to 
demonstrate that these encouraging immunoassay results translate into 
neutralisation of the pathological effects of envenomation in in vivo murine 
ED50 assays, prior to embarking on canine clinical trials. 
Our results show that the antisera produced here contains consistently high 
levels of specific antibodies directed against the majority of toxic components 
present in the four venoms used to immunise a flock of sheep, suggesting that 
it can be used for the manufacture of an antivenom directed against the venom 
of European adders. The collection of large volumes of high quality antisera, 
which is stable at -20oC for at least 13 years (MicroPharm, unpublished data), 
provides an excellent basis for the future manufacture of an antivenom that is 
reproducible from batch to batch. In the near future we will provide such an 
antivenom, which we have named ViperaVet, for use to treat canine victims 
that have been envenomed by European adders.
