Abstract 
Chronic pain affects almost 10 million people in the UK but despite this, few effective 
treatments exist.  Research has shown that targeting the Nav1.7 ion channel provides a novel 
approach to treatment.  ProTx-II, a 30 amino acid peptide isolated from Tarantula venom, is 
highly selective for the channel (IC50 value - 0.3nm in vitro) but in vivo results were less 
promising. 
ProTx-II contains three interlocking disulfide bonds connected in a distinctive pattern.  To 
investigate the structure-activity relationship between the peptide and the ion channel, 
truncated analogues based on the individual cysteine rings were synthesised. 
This thesis investigates the effect of replacing the disulfide bond with a thioether linkage 
through the incorporation of a novel diastereoisomer of the non-natural amino acid 
lanthionine to produce hydrolytically stable compounds.  Lanthionine can be thought of as 
two alanine residues connected by a thioether linkage at the -carbon.  Improvements in the 
synthesis allowed for the first large scale production of lanthionine enabling multiple 
attempts at peptide synthesis to be carried out.  Work was also begun on the synthesis of 
cystathionine, a second thioether linker containing an extra CH2 group between the amino 
acid centres. 
Novel methodologies were investigated for the incorporation of a new diastereomer of 
lanthionine containing two L-amino acid centres using a new microwave-based methodology.  
This methodology has so far produced the largest known synthetic rings containing a 
lanthionine bridge, along with the first interlocking disulfide and thioether bridged 
compounds. 
The analogues produced were modelled using in silico mutagenesis techniques and the effect 
of these analogues on the hNav1.7 receptor was investigated using an automated patch 
clamp assay.  Finally, analysis of the connectivity of ProTx-II was carried out using a 
combination of digestion and MS/MS experiments.

1. Chapter 1: Introduction 
This thesis details work towards the treatment of chronic nociceptive pain.  Chronic pain is 
described as any pain which persists or recurs for a period of more than three months,1 while 
nociceptive pain is that felt in the peripheral nerves and is caused by noxious (chemical, 
mechanical or thermal) stimuli.  Nociception is defined as the encoding and processing of 
harmful stimuli in the nervous system2 and is the mechanism by which the body identifies 
potentially dangerous situations.  The stimuli are processed by free nerve endings referred to 
as pain receptors or nociceptors. 
Chronic nociceptive pain has a variety of causes, from a herniated disc to cancer, and can be 
associated with debilitating levels of pain, making it difficult to maintain normality in daily 
life.1  Each year, approximately 5 million people develop chronic pain in the UK but only about 
two thirds recover.3  It is estimated that back pain alone costs the exchequer in excess of 
5 billion per annum.4  Currently, pain is managed according to the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) guidelines,5,6 which state that pain is treated in a step-wise manner, 
starting with mild over-the-counter drugs and increasing with need up to the prescription of 
powerful opioids such as morphine and fentanyl.  The so-called pain ladder is divided into 
three main phases (Table 1.1). 
Entry Pain Level Prescription Example 
Bottom Rung Mild Non-opioid + adjuvant paracetamol + ibuprofen 
Middle Rung Moderate Weak opioid + non-opioid + 
adjuvant 
codeine + paracetamol + 
diclofenac 
Highest Rung Severe Strong opioid + non-opioid + 
adjuvant 
morphine + paracetamol + 
gabapentin 
Table 1.1: The WHO Pain Ladder5,6 
The stronger painkillers such as morphine and fentanyl act at the  and -opioid receptors, 
which belong to a group of G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands.  Targeting 
these receptors is associated with a number of different side effects including respiratory 
depression, drowsiness and euphoria.7,8  Fentanyl is 50  80 times more potent than 
morphine and whilst it shows little hypnotic activity, it is associated with bradycardia.8  In the 
case of many agonists of the  and -opioid receptors, there are considerable problems with 
dependence as well as with all of the side effects mentioned above.  As such, it is not 
desirable to prescribe these drugs for long term use, meaning there is a real clinical need for 
new treatment alternatives by targeting alternative biological pathways. 
1.1 Identification of a Novel Biological Target 
In the late 2000s, two key pieces of research helped to identify a novel target for the 
treatment of chronic pain.  The first work centred around three consanguineous families in 
Pakistan, who were all found to share an inability to experience pain but were otherwise 
healthy.9  All members of the family were found to have suffered from fractures and frequent 
cuts and bruises but were otherwise healthy and considered of normal intelligence by both 
their families and physicians.  The inability to experience pain was found to be caused by an 
autosomal-recessive trait associated with the gene SCN9A.  This gene was found to code for 
the -subunit of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel, Nav1.7, which is strongly expressed in 
nociceptive neurons.10  Cox et al. showed that SCN9A is an essential requirement for 
nociception in humans, as the absence of the gene prevents the experience of pain.9 
The second piece of research which pointed towards targeting the Nav1.7 ion channel was 
from patients suffering from Erythromelalgia or man on fire syndrome.11  This condition is 
characterised by a burning sensation and patients are often very sensitive to changes in 
temperature and pressure, especially those caused by mild exercise.  There are currently no 
cures for this disease and treatment consists of applying cold presses and prescription of 
drugs for nerve problems such as the anti-epileptic gabapentin or tricyclic antidepressants 
such as amitriptyline.12  Yang et al. showed that the increased sensitivity to pain was again 
caused by mutations to SCN9A, which this time caused abnormal excitability of sensory and 
sympathetic neurones.11 
Taken together, these two pieces of research suggest that the Nav1.7 ion channel could be a 
new biological target for the treatment of chronic pain. 
1.2 Voltage-Gated Sodium Ion Channels and Action Potentials 
Nociceptive pain occurs as a result of the stimulation of peripheral nerves leading to the 
production of impulses which relay information to the brain.  Nerve impulses, or action 
potentials, are short-lasting electrical excitation events, which are characterised by the 
sudden change in the membrane potential of the cell.  Once stimulation reaches a threshold 
excitation level, the nerve impulse is carried along the axon (Figure 1.1). 
Figure 1.1: Schematic Diagram of a Nerve Cell13 
Sodium and potassium gated ion channels are instrumental in the conduction of the nerve 
impulse along the neuron (Figures 1.2 and 1.3). 
Figure 1.2: Schematic Diagram of an Action Potential14 
Figure 1.3: Schematic Diagram Showing the Stages of an Action Potential 
The change in membrane potential causes a conformational alteration to occur in the sodium 
channels, which allows Na+ ions to travel down the concentration gradient into the cell, 
leading to depolarisation of the neuron.  This in turn leads to the opening of the potassium 
channels and further depolarisation of the cell.  The peak of the action potential is rapidly 
reached and the sodium ion channels close, allowing the neuron to begin repolarising.  The 
slower sequential closure of the potassium channels allows some K+ ions to continue leaking 
out of the cell during this repolarisation period and the original resting potential is 
consequently overshot. The sodium/potassium ion pump then begins to restore the balance 
by removing three sodium ions from the neuron and replacing them with two potassium ions, 
leading to the overall net negative charge within the neuron. 
Sodium channels are responsible for most of the initial depolarisation events within a cell and 
are consequently of great interest as potential targets for analgesic drugs.  The channels 
consist of a main highly functionalised -subunit, containing the active site, and three -
subunits (Figure 1.4).  The latter modify the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel 
gating.  The -subunit  consists of four pseudo-homologous domains (I  IV), each containing 
six transmembrane helices (S1  S6).  The S1  S4 helices line the narrow outer entry to the 
pore, while S5 and S6 mark the inner, wider exit of the pore into the cell itself.  In each of the 
domains, the S4 segment is highly conserved and is responsible for initiating channel 
activation in response to depolarisation of the membrane, using the positively charged amino 
acid residues located at every third position.15 
Figure 1.4: Schematic Diagram of a Sodium Channel16 
The main -subunit consists of four homologous repeats (I-IV).  The cylinders represent 
probable transmembrane segments.  The blue helical segments (S5 and S6) form the pore 
region.  S4 (marked by asterisks) is the voltage sensor region.  Pink S6 segments show the 
region of modulatory drug binding. 
To date, nine mammalian isoforms of the sodium ion channel have been identified and 
functionally expressed (Table 1.2) and they have been shown to be identical in more than 
50% of the amino acid sequence.

Table 1.2: The Mammalian Sodium Channel Isoforms5 
Currently, there are no crystal structures available for any of the mammalian sodium ion 
channel isoforms.  In 2001, Ren et al.17 published their work on the first sodium ion channel 
to be isolated and functionally expressed from a bacterium, which was shown to be the 
probable ancestor of vertebrate sodium and calcium channels.18  However it took another 
decade before Catterall et al.19 published their work on the crystal structure of the bacterial 
sodium ion channel isolated from Arcobacter butzleri (Figure 1.5).

Their work showed that sodium ion selectivity was conferred through interaction with 
glutamate residues and that fenestrations in the sides of pores allowed for entry of small, 
hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs (Figure 1.6).

1.3 Small Molecule Ion Channel Inhibitors 
With such a high degree of homology, the challenge has been to find channel specific 
molecules, which do not exhibit off-target effects such as interfering with the heartbeat or 
skeletal muscle control.  There are several generic sodium ion channel blockers currently on 
the market, the first of which was phenytoin (1), launched in 1938 for the treatment of 
epilepsy.  Other examples include lidocaine (2), used in local anaesthesia, and pirmenol (3), 
which is used to treat arrhythmia (Figure 1.7). 
Figure 1.7: Structures of First Generation Sodium Ion Channel Blockers, phenytoin (1), 
lidocaine (2) and pirmenol (3) 
The first generation of sodium ion channel blockers tend to act on the highly conserved part 
of the -subunit of the channel, which means that they show a lack of selectivity towards the 
nine subtypes and hence a relatively small therapeutic window.20 
The second generation of sodium ion channel blockers have been shown to be more subtype 
selective with several potential candidates discovered for the treatment of pain including the 
biarylpyrazoles and biarylthiazoles.  These target the Nav1.7 ion channel and A-803467 (6) 
was the first molecule published to selectively target the Nav1.8 channel (Figure 1.8).21 
Figure 1.8:Generic Structures of Second Generation Sodium Ion Channel Blockers, 
biarylpyrazole (4), biarylthiazole (5) and A-803467 (6) 
The first generation molecules show far better drug-like properties and their use in a 
clinical setting supports this observation.  However, as their target is the highly conserved 
inner pore, it is unlikely that continuing research in this area will lead to any subtype-specific 
molecules.  Whilst the second generation drugs confer some selectivity, it is at the expense of 
drug-like properties including molecular weight, lipophilicity, aqueous solubility and 
selectivity towards other targets such as hERG.20  Currently, trials are ongoing with these 
compounds but none are available for use in a clinical setting. 
Although work has focussed on these second generation molecules, some interesting 
research by Roberson et al. has shown that in some cases it is possible to make the generic 
channel blockers work in a more selective manner.22  They found that by injecting a 
combination of lidocaine (7) with its N-ethyl bromide derivative QX-314 (8), it was possible to 
produce long lasting pain relief for up to nine hours after injection in rats (Figure 1.9).  It was 
reasoned that this occurred because the normally too hydrophilic QX-314 (8) could enter the 
nociceptor via permeation through the TrpV1 channel using lidocaine (7) as the TrpV1 
activator.  This more targeted approach for the delivery of drugs to the nociceptor would be 
particularly important in post-operative analgesia as it would decrease the requirement for 
the prescription of opiates and could allow for earlier hospital discharge and better pain 
control.22 
Figure 1.9: Structures of Lidocaine (7) and QX-314 (8) 
By far the most famous of the sodium ion channel blockers is tetrodotoxin (TTX, 9) which is 
isolated from the venom of the puffer fish.  In a seminal paper released in 1967,23 Narahashi 
and Moore showed that TTX (9) reacted selectively with the sodium ion channels over 
potassium and calcium channels.  It was later found that this occurred through the 
guanidinium group, which physically blocks the extracellular opening to the pore, preventing 
sodium ions from entering the channel (Figure 1.10).24  This is unusual when compared to 
other generic channel blockers such as lidocaine, which tend to block from inside the 
channel.24 
Figure 1.10: Structure of Tetrodotoxin (9) 
It has subsequently been found that not all mammalian sodium ion channels are responsive 
to tetrodotoxin and in fact, sodium ion channels are often defined as TTX resistant (TTX-R) or 
TTX sensitive (TTX-S) (Table 1.3).

1.4 Toxins as Ion Channel Inhibitors 
Although TTX (9) shows some selectivity towards individual subtypes, it again does not show 
enough selectivity to be of use in a clinical setting.  However, there are many other toxins 
with improved properties; the diverse functions of ion channels have made them the target 
of many other toxins from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, snakes, insects, 
scorpions, spiders, sea anemones and the male duckbilled platypus.25  Despite the vast array 
of animals and plants producing toxins, the active constituents act via one of two 
mechanisms: either through pore blocking (physically occluding the pore and preventing the 
passage of ions through the channel) or by acting as a gating modifier through binding to a 
region of the channel involved with the gating procedure.25 
1.4.1 Conotoxins 
One of the most studied groups of toxins is the conotoxins.  Isolated from the venom of 
marine snails of the genus Conus, these peptides form part of a complex mixture of 
biologically active components.  The conotoxins represent the majority of the Conus venom 
peptide collection and are characterised by their multiple disulfide bonds.  They have been 
shown to target a wide range of ion channels and receptors with unmatched potency and 
selectivity,26 which has allowed them to become a significant area of research with hopes of 
finding new therapies and diagnostic tools.27  Traditionally the conotoxins are classified 
according to their site of inhibition (Table 1.4) before being further divided into families 
based on disulfide framework and the species from which the peptide was isolated.  
However, as the number of classified conotoxins increases, it has become increasingly 
difficult to make such broad distinctions between classes as structural features appear to be 
conserved across subfamilies.26

Table 1.4: Classification of Conotoxins by Site of Inhibition 
The -conotoxins act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and represent the 
largest group of venom peptides isolated from cone snail venoms.26  They have attracted 
widespread attention as their selectivity for muscle and neuronal nAChRs has allowed for 
characterisation of a number of different receptors and investigation of the structure-activity 
relationship (SAR).  For example, -GI acts as a potent antagonist of the muscle-type nAChR in 
both binding assays and animal-isolated tissues (10, Figure 1.11) and -ImI (11) is of interest 
because it interacts with neuronal nAChRs and has potential for the treatment of pain 
(Figure 1.11). 
Figure 1.11: Structure of -GI (10) and -ImI (11) 
The -conotoxins have been shown to compete with TTX (9) for the extracellular binding site 
and show preference for the TTX-S channels over the resistant ones.28  They consist of 16-25 
amino acids including six cysteine residues and have been shown to be highly selective for the 
Nav1.4 ion channel.28,29  Like TTX, the -conotoxins are known to be pore-blockers, which 
interact with the negatively charged residues associated with the selectivity filter of voltage-
gated sodium channels.26  For example, -GIIIA and -GIIIB (12 and 13, Figure 1.12), isolated 
from the venom of Conus geographus, are shown to have selectivity for the muscle sodium 
ion channels but have no appreciable effect on either nerve or brain channels.30 
Figure 1.12: Structure of -GIIIA (12) and -GIIIB (13) 
P* = 4-hydroxyproline 
Despite the different targets for the -, - and -conotoxins, all three of these subtypes share 
the same secondary structural feature of conserved disulfide bond connectivity in the pattern 
1-4, 2-5, 3-6.  This gives a tightly bound structure in which two disulfide bonds form a loop 
through which the third disulfide bond passes, making them part of the inhibitory cystine 
knot (ICK) peptide family (14, Figure 1.13).  An alternative connectivity to the ICK structure is 
exhibited by HwTx-II, which connects the disulfide bonds in the pattern 1-3, 2-5, 4-6 and is 
known as the disulfide-directed -hairpin (DDH, 15, Figure 1.13).  The DDH motif was first 
identified by the King group and they postulated that it is a structural ancestor to the more 
complex ICK binding pattern (Figure 1.13).31 
Figure 1.13: Comparison of the Structures of an ICK peptide (14) and a DDH peptide (15) 
Currently, one -conotoxin is on the market for use as an analgesic in the treatment of 
severe and chronic pain: Ziconotide (16).  Marketed as Prialt by Eisai Ltd, Ziconotide works by 
blocking the Cav2.2 channel, which prevents the release of pro-nociceptive neurochemicals 
and hence prevents pain (Figure 1.14).  However, due to a lack of efficacy if delivered either 
orally or intravenously, this compound can only be administered intrathecally, which has a 
number of risks associated with it. 
Figure 1.14: Structure of Prialt (16) 
In addition to animals, it has been found that these small disulfide-rich peptides can also be 
produced by plants.  In the last 20 years, a new class of compounds has emerged known as 
the cyclotides.  These are comprised of approximately 30 amino acids and, as well as the six 
highly conserved cysteine residues observed in the conotoxins, the peptides display head-to-
tail cyclisation to give a fully cyclised backbone to the cysteine knot structure.  The peptides 
are divided into two categories; in about half of the peptides, a cys-pro bond is present, 
which gives the impression of a twist within the circular backbone.  These peptides are known 
as Mbius cyclotides.  Conversely, those without the twist are known as Bracelet cyclotides 
(Figure 1.15). 
Figure 1.15: Structure of Bracelet and Mbius Cyclotides32 
The first of the cyclotides to be structurally identified was kalata-B1 (17),33 which was isolated 
from the tropical African plant Oldenlandia affinis and used in local medicine to accelerate 
labour and childbirth (Figure 1.16).  Other cyclotides include the circulins, which are used as 
anti-HIV agents and the neurotensin antagonist cyclopsychotride.34 
Figure 1.16: Structure of Kalata-B1 (17)33 
Head-to-tail cyclisation has been shown to increase the stability of a peptide as it prevents 
degradation by cellular exopeptidases and thus increases physiological stability in vivo.35  This 
has led to many attempts to cyclise peptides using a variety of methods including solution 
phase peptide bond formation using HOAt and PyAOP,36 use of successive N to S acyl shifts37 
and genetic code reprogramming methods.35 
1.4.2 Other Multiply-Bridged Peptides 
In 2013, the SSm6a peptide (18, Figure 1.17) was isolated from the venom of a centipede.  It 
was found to be 150-fold more selective for the Nav1.7 ion channel over all other subtypes 
apart from Nav1.2, with which it showed a 32-fold selectivity, with an IC50 value of 25 nM.38  
The peptide contains six cysteine residues, which are linked in an unusual combination of 1-5, 
2-4, 3-6 and is predominantly -helical in structure.  The promising IC50 value and selectivities 
indicate that this peptide could be an interesting lead compound for the development of 
future analgesics but, with 46 residues, it will be too large to cross the blood-nerve barrier in 
its current form. 
Figure 1.17: Structure of Ssm6a (18) 
1.4.3 Toxins Isolated from Tarantula Venoms 
As has been previously mentioned, the unique ICK structure of the cyclotides and conotoxins 
has led to the discovery of the first real examples of ion channel selectivity.  This has been 
exemplified by the spider toxins; in the past decade, a number of different toxins isolated 
from the venom of tarantulas have been shown to have selectivities for specific ion channels.  
These include, but are not limited to, GsMTx-4 (19, Figure 1.18), which is isolated from the 
Chilean Rose Spider39,40 and is an inhibitor of the mechanosensitive TRP channels and HwTx-
IV (20, Figure 1.18), which has an IC50 value of approximately 500 nM against the Nav1.7 ion 
channel.41 
Figure 1.18: Structures of GsMTx-4 (19) and HwTx-IV (20) 
In 2007, Schmalhofer et al.42 published their work on a toxin isolated from the Peruvian 
Green Velvet Tarantula, Thrixopelma pruriens.  The peptide, known as ProTx-II (22, Figure 
1.19), was shown to have the highest selectivity for the Nav1.7 ion channel to date 
(IC50 = 0.3nM) and was 100-fold more selective for this channel than the other subtypes in 
vitro.  The peptide was first isolated from tarantula venom by Middleton et al.,43 along with 
another peptide named ProTx-I (21, Figure 1.19).  Upon publication, these peptides were the 
first known examples of tarantula toxins which acted by inhibiting sodium channel 
activation.43 
Figure 1.19: Structures of ProTx-I (21) and ProTx-II (22) 
ProTx-I has been shown to be active against a number of sodium ion channels including 
Nav1.8 (IC50 = 27 nM) and Nav1.2, Nav1.5, Nav1.7 (IC50 values all 50  100 nM).  Most 
interestingly, it can also be used to selectively bind to the Cav3.1 channel (IC50 = 0.2 M) over 
the Cav3.2 channel, allowing for distinction between the two subtypes.44 
1.5 ProTx-II as an Inhibitor of Nav1.7 
Middleton et al.43 characterised both ProTx-I and ProTx-II as members of the ICK family 
through a series of enzymatic digestion experiments with analysis of the products via mass 
spectrometry (these are discussed further in Chapter 3).  However, it was not until 2014 that 
the structure of ProTx-II was finally confirmed using solution-phase NMR.45  Prior to this, the 
only structural information available came from some homology modelling carried out by the 
Blumenthal group,46 who studied the interactions of ProTx-II on the Nav1.5 channel.  Using 
the Protein Data Bank coordinates for another ICK peptide HpTx-2, which is isolated from the 
venom of the Heteropoda venatoria spider and is shown to act against the Kv4.2 channel,47 
the group performed in silico mutagenesis techniques to create the bioactive surface of 
ProTx-II (Figure 1.20). 
Figure 1.20: Homology Model of ProTx-II (22)46 
Key: Essential Residues in Cyan, Non-Essential Residues in Magenta 
Their results show that the bioactive surface contains both hydrophobic and cationic residues 
and that the peptide can bind phospholipids.  The peptide has been shown to modify the 
action of both sodium and calcium voltage ion channels but not potassium channels by 
inhibiting peak current and shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarised 
potentials.43,48  This led to the belief that ProTx-II (22) bound to the site 4 binding site on 
the sodium channel, namely to part of domain II between segments 3 and 4.  To investigate 
this possibility, the group created 16 mutants of the Nav1.5 channel but found that no change

in binding was observed with these mutants and that pre-saturation with TTX (9) also had 
little effect.  From this result, it was possible to conclude that ProTx-II (22) does not act as a 
pore blocker in the Nav1.5 channel and that it has an as yet unidentified binding site, which is 
not characteristic of other known channel activators.  As the peptide has the ability to bind to 
liposomes,48 it is possible that the toxin may partially insert into the membrane as part of its 
mode of action.  So far, it has been established that ProTx-II (22) does not bind in the same 
manner as other ICK peptides to sodium ion channels.  The unique, undefined binding site 
accounts for its selectivity towards the Nav1.7 ion channel and provides an interesting avenue 
for further research. 
Continuation of this work by Park et al.45 has helped to identify which residues are important 
for binding to the Nav1.7 ion channel, as well as highlighting certain structural motifs.  The 
NMR structure showed that a short -sheet region was present and that the C-terminus was 
conformationally labile (Figure 1.21). 
Figure 1.21: Solution NMR Structure of ProTx-II (22)49 
As well as elucidating the NMR structure, the group produced a series of analogues of ProTx-
II to investigate effects on potency and selectivity.  They first compared the binding of ProTx-
II to PaTx-I (a structurally similar peptide with a different C-terminus, Figure 1.22) and found 
that whilst the IC50 value for PaTx-I against Nav1.7 was quite high (IC50 = 420 nM against 1 nM 
for ProTx-II), when the PaTx-I tail is replaced with the KKKLW motif found at the C-terminus of 
ProTx-II, the IC50 value is comparable (Table 1.5, Entries 1  3).

Table 1.5: Summary of Results from Park et al.45 
To see if only the tail section was important in binding, the group also investigated the effect 
of adding the KKKLW motif to two other peptides, both of which show only modest levels of 
activity with Nav1.7.  Whereas the activity of VsTx-2 was found to increase (Table 1.5, Entries 
4 and 5), the activity of JzTx-12 decreased with this modification (Table 1.5, Entries 6 and 7), 
showing that the final motif is not the only important part for binding.  The group found that 
Ser-11, Glu-12, Tyr-19 and Arg-22 are also important for conferring potency in the molecule.  
Finally, their focus on C-terminal modifications also showed that the preferred conformation 
for potency is the -helix and that by changing the carboxylic acid group, it was possible to 
increase potency still further in the order: 
NHPh  OH < OCH3 < NH2 < NHCH3 
The last of the compounds in fact forms the most potent Nav1.7 ion channel selective 
compound to date (23, Figure 1.23) with an IC50 value of just 42 pM.

The high potency and selectivity of ProTx-II (22) make it an ideal lead candidate for the 
treatment of chronic pain.  However, peptides lack oral bioavailability as a consequence of 
their susceptibility to degradation in the intestines and blood, and inefficient transport across 
the intestinal wall.28,50  In addition, disulfide bonds present an extra level of difficulty due to 
their susceptibility to reduction in extracellular environments including the blood.51  For 
example, they are particularly sensitive to glutathionine, which is present in the blood, and 
disulfide bond isomerases, which can lead to oxidative refolding of the peptide giving 
unwanted conformations.50  Craik and co-workers have shown that all three disulfide bonds 
are required in cyclotides, as well as the head-to-tail cyclisation of the backbone, in order to 
maintain activity, and that loss of the innermost disulfide bond causes inactivity.33,34 
1.6 Disulfide Bond Replacements 
With these problems in mind, considerable effort has been directed towards the investigation 
into disulfide bond replacements which are not susceptible to reduction or oxidative 
refolding. 
1.6.1 Replacement of a Disulfide Bond with a Diselenide Bond 
One of the first attempts to solve this problem was by Alewood and co-workers51 who 
investigated replacing disulfide bonds with isosteric but non-reducible diselenide bonds, 
through the introduction of Boc-L-Sec(MeBzl)-OH into a solid phase synthetic strategy.  Upon 
cleavage from the resin with HF, this method has the advantage of using mild aerobic 
oxidation conditions to form the diselenide bond from the deprotected selenocysteines.  
Their work focussed on the synthesis of analogues of the conotoxin ImI (11), which is a potent 
antagonist of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Figure 1.24). 
Figure 1.24: Structure of WT-ImI (11) 
They showed that crosslinking between selenocysteine and cysteine was disfavoured, 
meaning that when using a mixture of the two amino acids, the correct connectivity was 
always observed.  In addition they showed that when all four cysteines were replaced by the 
selenocysteine analogue, the correct connectivity was still observed, indicating that the same 
factors controlling the formation of disulfide bonds are important for the formation of the 
diselenide (Figure 1.25).51 
Having shown that the connectivity was not affected by the change in amino acid, the group 
next compared the stability of the peptides in human blood plasma.  Whereas significant 
scrambling was observed in WT-ImI, no scrambling was observed in the isomer in which all 
four amino acids had been replaced by selenocysteine under the same conditions.  Perhaps 
the more surprising result however, was that when just one pair of cysteines was replaced 
with selenocysteine, scrambling was still not observed, which the group attributed to a 
difference in redox potential between cysteine and selenocysteine.  Interestingly, the group 
subsequently found that replacement with selenocysteine slightly improved potency.52  This 
was attributed to a change in hydrophobicity upon selenocysteine replacement, which, 
combined with small changes in bond length and torsion angle, was thought to increase the 
hydrophobic interactions within the binding site. 
Figure 1.25: Selenocysteine analogues of ImI, where U = selenocysteine 
1.6.2 Replacement of Sulfur Atoms with Carbon Atoms 
As well as replacement by selenocysteine, work has also been carried out by Norton and co-
workers53 to form a dicarba-bridged analogue of ImI by using ring-closing metathesis on-resin 
(Figure 1.26).  In their strategy, one disulfide bond is replaced by an unsaturated carbon-
carbon bond.  Unlike the diselenide bond, which is slightly larger than the disulfide bond, the 
dicarba bridge is slightly shorter (2.02  and 1.34  respectively).  By using an unsaturated 
double bond, it was possible to form two different isomers of the dicarba-ImI with either cis 
or trans configuration.  The work showed that whilst the cis conformation showed similar 
activity to the native WT-ImI, no activity was observed for the trans isomer, nor was it found 
to adopt a single stable conformation in solution.  It is not possible to give a general 
prediction for whether the cis or trans dicarba-analogue of a peptide would give the greater 
activity, meaning that experiments would need to be carried out on a system-by-system 
basis.  As an alternative to this problem, the paper suggests that use of the fully saturated 
version could infer a greater flexibility in the structure and would negate the need to form 
both the cis and trans isomers of the peptide. 
Figure 1.26: Unsaturated (27) and Saturated (28) Dicarba-analogues of ImI 
Ring-closing metathesis has also been used by Vederas and co-workers, who showed that by 
replacing the disulfide bond in a type IIa bacteriocidin with an unsaturated carbon-carbon 
bond, the structural integrity of the peptide was maintained and only a modest drop in 
antimicrobial activity was observed.54  Similarly, when they formed carbocyclic analogues of 
oxytocin and the antagonist atosibin, they found a slight decrease in activity but an increased 
half-life in placental tissue.55 
Elaridi et al.56 furthered this work by combining on-resin ring closing metathesis using allyl 
glycine with rhodium catalysed hydrogenation of prenyl glycine.  By using allyl and prenyl 
glycine, the group found they could control the diastereoselectivity of the reactions to give 
the desired products, with no formation of the mismatched bonds observed (Figure 1.27).

Strategy

Grubbs, CH2Cl2, LiCl, DMF (v) Rh(I)(PPh3)3Cl, H2 CH2Cl2, MeOH 
Firstly, the allyl groups were reacted selectively with the Grubbs catalyst to give the 
unsaturated ring (30).  This was then be selectively reduced using a rhodium-catalysed 
hydrogenation reaction to give (31).  Preparation of the prenyl group for the second ring-
closing metathesis reaction, followed by reaction with (32) gave the unsaturated chain 
product, which was again reduced using rhodium to give the desired product (33).  The 
remarkable result in this synthesis was the selectivity: the prenyl group did not react with 
Wilkinsons catalyst and no mixed metathesis or any other unwanted side products are 
formed, meaning there was complete control over the ring formation to give the desired 
product.  However, the major limitation to this work was that it is not possible to perform 
ring-closing metathesis rings on sterically hindered structures,55 meaning that this could 
prove problematic for any system where neighbouring amino acids have bulky side chains or 
in particularly tightly bound structures, such as the ICK peptides. 
1.6.3 Replacement of a Disulfide Bond with Lactam Ring Formation 
As an alternative to ring-closing metathesis, Hargittai et al.57 replaced the disulfide bond with 
a lactam ring through the formation of an amide bond on-resin.  By using orthogonal 
protecting groups (allyl and alloc) they could selectively deprotect the amino acids and form 
the desired product (Figure 1.28).  For their model system, they used the -conotoxin SI, 
which is an agonist against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. 
Figure 1.28: Example Orthogonal Synthesis of ST Analogue Using On-resin Lactamization 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Pd(PPh3)4, NMM, HOAc, DMF (ii) HATU, NMM, DMF  
(iii) piperidine, DMF, then EDT (iv) DMSO, Na2HPO4 
The group found that formation of the smaller loop (Cys 2  Cys 7) by on-resin lactamization 
occurred three times faster than formation of the larger loop (Cys 3  Cys 13).  However, 
whereas both orientations of the lactam in the large ring showed significant binding in the 
radioligand binding assay, neither lactam analogue of the smaller ring was found to have any 
activity.  Replacement of a disulfide bond with a lactam ring gives rise to a large change in the 
electronics of the compound and could perhaps have a detrimental effect on the potency of 
the compound, as well as still being susceptible to breakdown in vivo by peptidases, meaning 
this disulfide bond replacement may have limited utility. 
1.6.4 Replacement of a Disulfide Bond with Cystathionine 
Although these replacements have been shown to have reasonable reactivity in some cases 
against their original disulfide counterparts, they all show vastly differing electronics to a 
disulfide bond and neither the ring-closing metathesis nor lactamization reactions give a true 
bioisoteric analogue.  However, as early as 1991, research was published showing the 
replacement of a disulfide bond by a cystathionine linker,58 which can be thought of as a 
disulfide bond in which one sulfur has been replaced by a carbon atom (Figure 1.29). 
Figure 1.29: Structure Comparisons 39  Disulfide Bond, 40  Cystathionine Bond, Regioisomer 
1, 41  Cystathionine Bond, Regioisomer 2 
Cui et al.59 formed a series of analogues of Tachyplesin-1 (42, Figure 1.30), a peptide known 
to have high antimicrobial activity.  The peptides formed have one or more S atoms replaced 
with carbon to form a series of analogues (Figure 1.30). 
Figure 1.30: Tachyplesin-1 (42) and Generic Structural Analogues (43) (X = S or C) 
The most interesting result came from the replacement of just one sulfur atom with a carbon; 
that is, the peptide contained one cystathionine and one disulfide link.  In this case, the 
activity was the same or only slightly reduced with respect to the original peptide.   The group 
found that as the number of carbon atoms replacing sulfurs increased, the minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MiC) also increased until, when all four sulfurs were replaced with carbon 
atoms, the compound was up to 16-fold less potent than the parent peptide.  Computer 
modelling showed that this was as a result of a dramatic variation in torsional strain, which 
caused large structural distortions in the peptide structure. 
In 2011, van der Donk and co-workers60 published their work on cystathionine-containing 
analogues of compstatin, a 13 amino acid peptide known to inhibit complement activation 
and containing one disulfide bond.  They showed that the position of the sulfur had serious 
consequences in activity; whilst the -Cth analogue (45, Figure 1.31) maintained binding and 
inhibition properties, all activity was lost in the -Cth analogue (44, Figure 1.31). 
Figure 1.31: - (44) and -Analogues (45) of Compstatin (HCy = cystathionine) 
The most interesting result however was that the reduction of the disulfide bond had a far 
more pronounced effect on potency than substitution of cystathionine or the subsequent 
oxidation of the sulfur, showing that cystathionine is a good replacement in this system. 
Finally, in addition to their work with replacement of disulfide bonds with the diselenide 
equivalent in ImI, Alewood and co-workers also experimented with a cystathionine 
replacement.61  They produced analogues in which each disulfide bond in turn was replaced 
by the cystathionine linker before forming the dual cystathionine analogue.  These were 
shown to be structurally homologous by NMR and revealed no or very modest losses in 
biological activity (Figure 1.32). 
Figure 1.32: Cystathionine-Containing analogues of ImI (U = cystathionine) 
1.6.5 Replacement of a Disulfide Bond with Lanthionine 
The great advantage of using a thioether linkage in place of the disulfide bond is that these 
compounds tend to be far more stable in reducing environments including the blood.50,51,60  
Whilst some work has been done on the replacement of a disulfide bond with the isosteric 
cystathionine, little work has been published on the replacement with lanthionine (Figure 
1.33). 
Figure 1.33: Structure Comparisons 39  Disulfide Bond, 49  Lanthionine Bond, 40  
Cystathionine Bond, Regioisomer 1, 41  Cystathionine Bond, Regioisomer 2 
Replacement of a disulfide bond with lanthionine has the dual advantage of preventing ring 
opening by disulfide bond cleavage and subtly changing the size of the ring to allow 
investigation into the structure-activity relationship between the peptide and the binding 
site.  Previous work by Goodman and co-workers,62 has shown that lanthionine analogues of 
sandostatin (52 and 53), itself a clinically used analogue of somatostatin, were found to have 
increased selectivity to the SSTR5 receptor with respect to the parent peptide sandostatin 
(Figure 1.34). 
Figure 1.34: Structure of Somatostatin (50), Sandostatin (51) and Examples of the Goodman 
Lanthionine-Containing Analogues (52 and 53) (blue indicates a D-amino acid) 
The analogues showed a weaker inhibition of growth hormone release but showed an 
increased stability against enzymatic degradation and an increased half-life in vivo.  In this 
work, the lanthionine bridge was formed on-resin, which lead to some racemisation at the 
stereocentre. 
1.7 Lanthionine and the Lantibiotics 
Lanthionine is found in a group of peptides known as the lanthionine-containing antibiotics, 
or lantibiotics.  The most studied of the lantibiotics is Nisin, a 34 amino acid peptide used as a 
food preservative (54, Figure 1.35).  It has been shown to bind with lipid II and thus interferes 
with cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria.63,64  This novel mode of action has led to a lot of 
research in the area with the aim of developing a potential new class of antibiotics. 
Figure 1.35: Structure of Nisin (54) 
In nature, the lanthionine bridges are made during a complex post-translational modification 
procedure involving, amongst other reactions, Michael addition of a cysteine to a 
dehydroalanine residue.63  In the laboratory, a number of different approaches have been 
used to synthesise lantibiotics; a lot of work has focussed on the use of protein engineering to 
generate these thioether bridges in mutant lantibiotics using cell culture.65,66  In addition to 
this, enzymatic work pioneered by Levengood et al.67,68,69 has shown that it is possible to 
synthesise lantibiotic analogues containing non-proteinogenic amino acids by harnessing the 
synthetase enzymes involved in lantibiotic synthesis, which are able to accept a wide range of 
substrates for processing. 
1.7.1 Chemical Syntheses of Lanthionine 
Chemists have also tried to synthesise lanthionine by mimicking the post-translational 
modifications observed in nature.  Work by Bradley and co-workers70 has shown that the 
thioether bridge can be formed by adding a protected cysteine (56) to a protected 
dehydroalanine (55) in the presence of a catalytic amount of cesium carbonate to give 
lanthionine (57, Figure 1.36). 
Figure 1.36: Synthesis of Lanthionine via Michael Addition 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, MeCN 
Unfortunately, unlike in nature, complete stereochemical control is not achieved and a 
mixture of diastereoisomers is observed.  As an alternative, the first reported synthesis of 
lanthionine69,71 uses the reaction between a -chloroalanine (58) and cysteine (59, Figure 
1.37). 
Figure 1.37: Synthesis of Lanthionine via Chloroalanine (58) Reaction with Cysteine (59) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) KOH (aq), 50 C 
However, the strongly basic conditions could result in elimination to form the 
dehydroalanine, which would again lead to a mixture of diastereoisomers in the product.  
This is also observed when using the carbamate protected iodoalanine, which produces the 
desired product with a diastereomeric excess of 70% (Figure 1.38).72 
Figure 1.38: Synthesis of Lanthionine (63) via Iodoalanine (61) Reaction with Cysteine (62) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF 
As carbamate protecting groups are so prone to elimination to give dehydroalanine, other 
approaches using different protecting groups have been trialled.  Zhu and Schmidt73 have 
shown that by using a milder base with the bromoalanine derivative (64), it is possible to 
form the desired product without formation of the dehydroalanine, which results in complete 
stereochemical control (Figure 1.39). 
Figure 1.39: Synthesis of Lanthionine via Bromoalanine (64) Reaction with Cysteine (56) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) NaHCO3 (pH 8.5), tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, EtOAc 
Similarly, instead of the Boc protecting group, the trityl group can also be used.  However, 
this protecting group comes with a different challenge as, although the formation of 
dehydroalanine is disfavoured, the formation of the corresponding aziridine is now favoured 
(Figure 1.40).74,75 
Figure 1.40: Formation of Aziridine (69) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) MeSO2Cl, Et3N (ii) NaI, acetone 
The aziridine (69) then has two possible points of attack available at which the iodine can 
add, leading to the formation of two regioisomers (72 and 73).  Upon reaction with cysteine, 
this then leads to the formation of the desired product as the minor isomer, with the major 
product being the nor-lanthionine analogue (73, Figure 1.41). 
Figure 1.41: Synthesis of Lanthionine (72) and Nor-Lanthionine (73) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Fmoc-Cys-OtBu (62), Cs2CO3, DMF 
To prevent the formation of the unwanted nor-lanthionine, the Tabor group came up with 
two separate approaches; in the first, they performed the iodination reaction at low 
temperature.  This allowed the formation of the desired iodoalanine in favour of the 
unwanted regioisomer.  Although small amounts of the aziridine were formed in this manner, 
upon coupling with the protected cysteine (62), none of the unwanted product was observed, 
suggesting no ring opening of the aziridine occurs at low temperature. 
As an alternative, they also formed lanthionine via a Mitsunobu reaction using more reactive 
reagents than the traditional triphenylphosphine and DEAD combination.  They found that by 
using ADDP and PMe3 with catalytic amounts of zinc tartrate, they could form the desired 
lanthionine product directly from the reaction of trityl allyl serine (75) with protected 
cysteine (62).75  However, the disadvantage of this reaction route is the long reaction time of 
7 days (Figure 1.42). 
Figure 1.42: Synthesis of Lanthionine via Mitsunobu Reaction 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) ADDP, PMe3, zinc tartrate 
An alternative approach to formation of lanthionine is via the desulfurisation of a pre-
prepared cystine derivative.  First reported by Harpp and Gleason,76 it was extended by 
Hennen and co-workers77 to give unsymmetrical thioether bridged compounds.  In their work, 
symmetrical cystines were first oxidised to give thiosulfinates, which could then be reacted 
with a differentially protected cysteine to give an unsymmetrical cystine (78).  The use of an 
aminophosphine caused contraction of the cystine to the desired lanthionine (Figure 1.43).

tris(dialkylamino)phosphine hexaethylphosphorus triamide, benzene (iii) 2.5 eq. 
tris(dialkylamino)phosphine hexaethylphosphorus triamide, benzene 
However, the final reaction with the phosphine is reversible, which means that only modest 
yields of the desired product are achieved along with mixtures of symmetrical cystine 
derivatives. 
Finally, Goodman and co-workers78,69 showed that the preparation of orthogonally protected 
lanthionine (81) could be formed from serine -lactone (79, Figure 1.44). 
Figure 1.44: Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Lanthionine (81) 
 Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF 
Although all of these syntheses show promise and have allowed for production of 
lanthionine, each synthesis has shown problems including, but not limited to, racemisation of 
the product, formation of unwanted side products and poor yields.  As such, in order to form 
large quantities of lanthionine, it was necessary to re-evaluate the current routes available 
and design a more robust synthesis. 
1.8 Synthesis of Lantibiotics 
1.8.1 Formation of a Lanthionine Bridge On-Resin 
Using this method, Fukase et al.79 were able to achieve the first synthetic total synthesis of 
Nisin.  In their approach, they made each ring separately using the desulfurisation approach 
by Harpp and Gleason76 and then coupled each of the rings together using 1-ethyl-3-(3-
dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and HOBt (Figures 1.45 and 1.46).

The biomimetic nature of the Michael addition was also exploited by van der Donk and co-
workers80 who extended it to include the use of the unnatural amino acid 
phenylselenocysteine (Sec(Ph)).  This was added into a solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) 
strategy before subsequent oxidation and elimination with NaIO4 to give the required 
dehydroalanine residue.  This could then again be reacted via a Michael addition with a 
deprotected cysteine residue to give the desired thioether bridge.  This methodology was 
then used to form Ring B in subtillin (Figure 1.47).

1.8.2 Incorporation of a Pre-Formed Protected Lanthionine into a Solid Phase Peptide 
Synthesis Strategy 
Although these reactions do give the desired stereochemistry, they are very reliant on the 
correct orientation of both halves of the molecule and indeed, if the dehydroalanine and 
cysteine residues are reversed in the above Michael addition, then a mixture of 
diastereoisomers is observed.80  One way to circumvent this problem would be to add a pre-
formed lanthionine moiety into a peptide synthesis strategy.  Provided that the insertion and 
cyclisation steps could be controlled, this would guarantee that the desired stereochemistry 
was observed and should prevent the formation of the wrong isomer. 
This approach was first attempted by Goodman et al.78 who showed that their orthogonally 
protected lanthionine (97) could be incorporated into a peptide sequence using standard Boc 
chemistry.  Reaction with acetic acid gives simultaneous cleavage from the oxime resin and 
peptide cyclisation to give the desired cyclic peptide, Nisin Ring C (101, Figure 1.48).

CH2Cl2 
Whilst this approach gives both regioselective and stereoselective control, the disadvantage 
of this method is that it can only be used to form single lanthionine rings as cyclisation 
necessitates concurrent cleavage from the oxime resin.  In this instance, this would mean that 
any subsequent additions to the peptide would need to be carried out in solution rather than 
on-resin. 
As an alternative to this, work by Bregant and Tabor used a different protecting group SPPS 
strategy.72  The linear thioether precursor they used had orthogonal protecting groups to 
allow for controlled chain growth during a solid phase strategy (Figure 1.49). 
Figure 1.49: Structure of Lanthionine (102) for Use in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Strategy72 
To begin, the chain was built up using the standard Fmoc SPPS protocol (Fmoc deprotection 
using 40% piperidine, followed by amino acid addition using HBTU and DIPEA) to give 103.  
The lanthionine moiety was incorporated using the non-uronium based coupling reagents 
HOAt (1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole) and PyAOP (1H-7-Azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-
oxytrispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) in the presence of DIPEA to generate 
104.  Once the lanthionine moiety was successfully installed, the classical Fmoc SPPS protocol 
was used to build up the amino acid chain to the desired length 105.  To cyclise the peptide, 
the Fmoc group was again removed using 40% piperidine and simultaneous removal of the 
allyl and Alloc protecting groups was achieved using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium 
and 1,3-dimethylbarbituic acid to give the fully deprotected peptide 106.  Cyclisation again 
employed the HOAt and PyAOP conditions to give 107.  The free amino group was then ready 
to react with the next Fmoc protected amino acid to give 108.  To complete the synthesis, 
one last Fmoc deprotection using 40% piperidine was carried out followed by TFA-mediated 
cleavage from the resin with simultaneous side chain deprotection to give the desired 
analogue of Nisin Ring C (109, Figure 1.50).

Using this methodology, Vederas and co-workers were able to form multiple lanthionine rings 
on-resin to give the first solid-supported synthesis of a lantibiotic, lactocin S (117, Figure 
1.51).81

The first lanthionine bridge was formed by initially deprotecting the allyl and Alloc groups 
using Pd(PPh3)4 and phenylsilane, before removing the Fmoc group with piperidine.  
Cyclisation was achieved using PyBOP and HOBt as the coupling reagents to give intermediate 
(111).  Standard coupling conditions were then used to grow the chain to give (112) before 
again deprotecting and cyclising the peptide to give the second lanthionine bridge (113).  
SPPS continued until the installation of the final two amino acids (115), which were pre-
prepared using solution phase chemistry and then coupled to the product using PyBOP and 
HOBt.  Cleavage from the resin using TFA and anisole gave the desired product, Lactocin S 
(117), with a yield of 10% over 71 steps. 
This methodology was further extended by the Vederas group to include methyl lanthionine 
(119, Figure 1.52) in the solid phase synthesis of Lacticin 3147.82,83 
Figure 1.52: Structure of Lanthionine (118) and Methyl Lanthionine (119) 
By using two different sets of orthogonal protecting groups, it was possible to form both the 
successive and interlocking rings in both components of Lacticin 3147, known as A1 and A2 
(120 and 121, Figure 1.53). 
Figure 1.53: Structure of Lacticin 3147 A1 (120) and Lacticin 3147 A2 (121)82,83 
To form the interlocking rings in (121), orthogonal protecting groups were employed; for the 
first incorporation of methyllanthionine, the allyl and Alloc groups were used and for the 
second molecule, para-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl (Nz) and para-nitrobenzyl (NB) were 
employed (Figure 1.54).

The peptide chain was grown using standard Fmoc methodology to install both the standard 
amino acids and the orthogonally protected methyl lanthionine moieties.  Synthesis of the 
first ring was achieved by deprotection with Pd(PPh3)4 followed by cyclisation using PyBOP 
and HOBt to give intermediate (124).  Standard Fmoc conditions were used to install the 
following leucine before simultaneous deprotection of the Nz and NB groups was carried out 
using 6 M SnCl2 in HCl, which upon cyclisation gave intermediate (125).  Installation of 
lanthionine to give the final ring in the sequence again employed the allyl/Alloc group 
protecting strategy to give (127), before addition of the last amino acids gave intermediate 
(128).  The last five amino acids (129) were synthesised off-resin due to the extensive and 
densely packed modifications83 and were installed into the peptide chain on-resin using 
fluoro-N,N,N,N-tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate and DIPEA to give (120).  
Finally, cleavage from the resin gave the desired product, Lacticin 3147 A1.  This is the first 
reported total synthesis of both these peptides using SPPS techniques and shows that a 
remarkably complex structure can be formed by employing the correct protecting groups. 
At the same time, work published by the Tabor group84 showed that it was possible to make 
an analogue of the interlocking rings D & E in Nisin (131, Figure 1.55) by employing two 
different orthogonally protected lanthionines.  In their work, they used the previously 
reported allyl/Alloc protecting group on one moiety (102, Figure 1.55) and trimethylsilyl 
(TMSE) and -(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl (TEOC) on the other lanthionine moiety (130, 
Figure 1.55). 
Figure 1.55: Structures of Orthogonally Protected Lanthionines (102) and (130) and an 
Analogue of Nisin Rings D and E (131)84 
Again, standard SPPS strategies were employed to form the peptide chain and simultaneous 
deprotection of the TMSE and TEOC groups was achieved using TBAF, before cyclisation to 
form the second ring was carried out with PyAOP and HOAt. 
Although all of these strategies have shown it is possible to incorporate an orthogonally 
protected lanthionine moiety into a SPPS strategy, none of the methods above have been 
applied to a system as complicated as an ICK peptide.  In recent years, work by both the 
Tabor and van der Donk groups has shown that it is possible to make interlocking thioether 
bridges but as yet, no one has published the formation of complex systems containing 
interlocking disulfide and lanthionine bridges.  Thus, in order to form true analogues of ProTx-
II (22), a new methodology was required which could be utilised to form the desired peptides. 
1.9 Conclusions and Aims 
Research has indicated that ProTx-II (22) shows good therapeutic potential for the selective 
inhibition of the Nav1.7 ion channel over other subtypes but has difficulty crossing the blood-
nerve barrier.  Currently, little is known about the structure of the Nav1.7 ion channel or of 
the binding site specifically.  The first aim of this project was to investigate the structure-
activity relationship of the ligand on the Nav1.7 ion channel via the synthesis of shorter 
analogues of ProTx-II (22) and by replacing one or more of the disulfide bonds with thioether 
linkages.  All of the above work has focussed on the synthesis of naturally occurring peptides 
which incorporate a D-amino acid into the structure of the peptide.  However, in order to 
incorporate a lanthionine moiety into ProTx-II, it was necessary to form a new 
diastereoisomer of lanthionine synthesised from L-amino acids, as the parent peptide 
consists entirely of L-amino acids.  As mentioned in section 1.7, there are many promising 
syntheses of orthogonally protected lanthionine but they are all either low yielding, do not 
produce stereochemically pure product or cannot be used in a solid phase peptide synthesis 
strategy.  In order to allow this research to be carried out, a large amount of orthogonally 
protected lanthionine was required.  For this reason, the first part of the project aimed to 
investigate a robust synthesis for the production of multi-gram quantities of 
diastereomerically pure lanthionine. 
Although some work has been published on the formation of interlocking lanthionine bridges, 
no work has been published on interlocking lanthionine and disulfide bridges.  In this work, a 
new methodology for the formation of these structures was implemented to form a number 
of analogues of ProTx-II (22), with the aim of increasing the stability of the peptides by 
replacing the disulfide bond with a thioether linkage. 
Finally, these peptides were tested against the hNav1.7 ion channel using an automated patch 
clamp assay to assess the potency of the compounds and their structures were assessed 
using homology modelling techniques.

2. Chapter 2: Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Lanthionine for Use in Solid Phase 
Peptide Synthesis 
2.1 Introduction 
This chapter describes attempts to synthesise a novel diastereoisomer of orthogonally 
protected lanthionine.  The original ProTX-II peptide (22) was shown to have good inhibitory 
effects of the Nav1.7 channel in vitro but showed comparatively poor results in vivo, owing to 
difficulties in crossing the blood-nerve barrier.1  To investigate which part of the peptide was 
important for binding, it was decided to synthesise shorter analogues of ProTX-II (22).  As 
shown in Figure 2.1, it has three disulfide-linking bridges: 
Figure 2.1: Structure of ProTX-II (22) 
As part of the research, it was decided to investigate the effect of the disulfide link on the 
efficacy of the compound by replacing it with a monosulfide link formed from the 
incorporation of the non-proteinogenic amino acid lanthionine (132, Figure 2.2).  This has the 
dual effect of decreasing the size of the ring by one atom and increasing the stability of the 
peptide towards disulfide bond opening in vivo. 
In order to control the primary sequence of the lanthionine-containing peptides, it was 
necessary to use an orthogonally protected lanthionine, which could be used in conjunction 
with an automated Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) protocol.  In all lantibiotics, 
lanthionine exists in the meso S,R form (49, Figure 2.2) and is formed from the protected 
forms of L-cysteine and D-serine.2,4 However, in ProTX-II (22), all constituent amino acids in 
the sequence are the naturally occurring L-amino acids.  Hence, in order to investigate the 
effect of the thioether bridge on the structure-activity relationship, it will be necessary to 
synthesise the R,R form 132 (Figure 2.2).

2.2 Small Scale Synthesis 
2.2.1 Overview of the Small Scale Synthesis 
In order to carry out multiple peptide syntheses for a comprehensive investigation into the 
structural activity relationship of the Nav1.7 channel, multi-gram quantities of lanthionine 
were required.  However, before this could be achieved, it was decided to establish the 
synthesis on a small scale, to highlight any problematic steps. 
Figure 2.3 shows the synthesis of lanthionine 142 investigated.  The procedure began with 
the esterification of L-cystine (133) using tert-butyl acetate in the presence of perchloric acid, 
followed by Fmoc protection using Fmoc succinamide and N-methyl morpholine to produce 
the dimer in reasonable yield.  The disulfide bond was then cleaved using tributylphosphine3 
to afford the Fmoc protected cysteine (62) in 61% yield. 
Concurrently, L-serine (136) was first reacted with trimethylsilyl chloride before protection 
with trityl chloride in triethylamine to give the product (137) in 90% yield.4  The carboxylic 
acid was then protected using allyl bromide before a Mitsunobu reaction was used to convert 
the alcohol to an iodo group to give 139. 
The products from these first two stages were then coupled together in the presence of 
cesium carbonate to give 140 in moderate yield,4 before a series of deprotection and re-
protection steps afforded the final orthogonally protected lanthionine 142.

The overall yield for the seven step synthesis starting from L-Serine was 4% and resulted in 
the formation of 40 mg of 142, which was enough for one attempt at peptide synthesis. 
2.2.2 Optimisation of the Synthesis 
Although the initial synthesis of lanthionine (142) worked reasonably well, there were several 
low yielding steps, including the coupling of the protected iodoalanine and cysteine residues, 
as well as the trityl deprotection and Alloc re-protection steps.  This led to the production of a 
small quantity of the final product, which allowed for just one attempt at peptide synthesis.  
Thus, as well as synthesising a novel diastereoisomer, it was important to find a more robust 
route which could be scaled up to produce multi-gram quantities for optimisation of the 
peptide synthesis conditions and production of multiple peptide analogues. 
2.2.2a Preparation of the Protected Amino Acid Intermediates 
The tert-butyl protection of L-cystine (133) proceeded well on scale-up and afforded a yield of 
94% of the desired cystine (134).  For the Fmoc protection step, two trial reactions were 
carried out using Fmoc chloride3 and succinimide,5 which gave yields of 35% and 61% 
respectively and it was thus decided to continue with the use of the Fmoc succinimide.  In the 
small scale synthesis, column chromatography had been used to purify the doubly protected 
cystine residue (135).  However, due to the size of column required for large scale 
purification, investigations into purification via recrystallisation were carried out.  A number 
of different solvent systems were tried and it was found that the best yield of the product 
was obtained from a solution of 10% ethyl acetate in petrol, to give an overall yield of 60%, 
which was comparable to that obtained by column chromatography. 
Unfortunately, on a large scale, it was found that reaction of the doubly protected cystine 
(135) with tributylphosphine to give cysteine (62) gave incomplete cleavage and led to 
difficulties in the separation of the starting material from the product.  For this reason, it was 
decided to try using dithiothreitol, which is commonly used to cleave disulfide bonds in 
peptides and proteins,6 for the cleavage instead.  The new reaction methodology both gave 
an increase in yield from 61% to 80% and was also much faster; while the phosphine reaction 
required 14 hours, the reaction with dithiothreitol could be carried out in 45 minutes and 
purification simply required washing, which meant that a large quantity of the doubly 
protected cysteine could be produced from the starting cystine in less than an hour.  Overall, 
the improvements to this route (Figure 2.4) helped to increase the yield from 12% to 45% 
over three steps, shortened the synthesis by two days and gave a robust method for the 
production of large quantities of the required cysteine residue (62) without the need for 
purification by column chromatography.

Reagents and Conditions: (i) tBuOAc, HClO4 (ii) FmocOSu, NMM, THF (iii) dithiothreitol, Et3N, 
CH2Cl2 
Synthesis of the doubly-protected iodoalanine 139 unfortunately proved far more challenging 
on a large scale.  The first step involving the trityl protection of serine initially proceeded in a 
90% yield to give the product but upon repetition of this reaction, it was not possible to 
achieve such a high yield again.  Whilst trying to solve this problem, another synthesis was 
published which involved first protecting the carboxylic acid with the allyl group and then 
trityl protecting the product.7  This one-pot procedure was particularly appealing as it 
required a shorter work-up and 24 hours less reaction time.  For this reason, it was decided to 
swap to this procedure, which gave the doubly protected serine in excellent purity with an 
overall yield of 91%, which is an improvement on the 78% achieved over the previous two 
step process (Figure 2.5).  From here, the Mitsunobu reaction used during the initial synthesis 
produced the iodoalanine in 71% yield and was ready for the coupling reaction.

Apparatus (ii) trityl chloride, Et3N, DMF (iii) PPh3, DEAD, CH3I, CH2Cl2 
2.2.2b Optimisation of the Coupling Procedure 
Although the literature reports high yields for the coupling step (70%),4 a yield of only 38% 
was achieved for this step on a small scale.  However, during the scale-up of the procedure, 
none of the desired product was formed.  It is known that the reaction only proceeds under 
anhydrous conditions as the presence of water in the reaction can cause the loss of the Fmoc 
protecting group but no loss was observed.  Analysis of the crude NMR spectra showed the 
presence of cystine, which brought into question the new reduction conditions.  However, 
both NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry results showed that it was the cysteine not 
the cystine that was used in the coupling reaction.  This was confirmed by testing the reagent 
with Ellmanns reagent8 (5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) prior to addition, which turns 
vivid orange in the presence of a free thiol but does not react with a disulfide bond.  The 
purity of the iodoalanine 139 was also confirmed by both NMR spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry. 
On closer inspection of the crude NMR spectrum obtained from the reaction mixture, it was 
found that in all cases, the iodoalanine 139 was rearranging in solution to give the aziridine 
143.  This meant that the cysteine was then effectively stirring in solution with no other 
reactants present, which explains the oxidation to the corresponding cystine.  It is known that 
the iodoalanine 139 easily rearranges in solution and this has in the past led to problems with 
the formation of the wrong regioisomer of lanthionine (Figure 2.6).3 
Figure 2.6: Formation of -iodo--alanine Derivative 145 via the Aziridine 143 and Subsequent 
Reaction to Give Norlanthionine (146) 
However, it was not immediately obvious why a reaction which had once proceeded in good 
yield would now no longer occur at all and instead produce large quantities of an unwanted 
side product.  Thus, it was decided to investigate a number of different coupling strategies. 
In 2003, Zhu and Schmidt9 reported phase transfer conditions using a bromoalanine 
derivative (147) to give the protected lanthionine (149) using tetrabutylammonium hydrogen 
sulfate in ethyl acetate and sodium hydrogencarbonate in water at pH 8.5 (Figure 2.7). 
Figure 2.7: Phase Transfer Coupling Conditions 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) pH 8.5 solution of NaHCO3, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen 
sulfate, ethyl acetate 
The disadvantage of this coupling method is that a competing elimination reaction forming 
the dehydroalanine causes formation of some of the other diastereoisomer (151, Figure 2.8). 
Figure 2.8: Formation of Diastereoisomers via Competing Elimination Reaction 
In 2008, Vederas and co-workers10 published their own route to lanthionine which was two 
steps shorter than the Bregant and Tabor 2005 method,4 utilising the Zhu and Schmidt phase 
transfer method9 but again produced two diastereoisomers of lanthionine with a 
diastereoisomeric excess of 80%. 
It was decided that the optimisation of the coupling step would involve three separate 
avenues of research: 
 Investigations into the Vederas phase-transfer route, 
 Combining the phase-transfer methodology with the Bregant and Tabor route, 
 Optimisation of the Bregant and Tabor route. 
i) Investigation into the Vederas Route10 
The Vederas method uses the same doubly protected cysteine (62) described above.  This 
was reacted with the allyl/Alloc protected bromoalanine derivative 153 in ethyl acetate in the 
presence of an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium bromide at pH 8.5 (Figure 2.9).  In a 
similar manner to the iodoalanine 139, 153 was produced by first carrying out a one-pot 
allyl/Alloc protection of serine to give the intermediate 152 in reasonable yield.  This was 
then reacted in the presence of carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine to give the 
product in 60% yield. 
Figure 2.9: Vederas Route to Orthogonally Protected Lanthionine 141 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) 1. allyl alcohol, p-toluenesulfonic acid, toluene, Dean-Stark 
apparatus 2. allylchloroformate, Et3N, ethyl acetate (ii) carbon tetrabromide, 
triphenylphosphine, dichloromethane (iii) NaHCO3 (pH 8.5), tetrabutylammonium bromide, 
ethyl acetate 
The coupling reaction gave the desired product in a 44% yield but, as with Vederas, a mixture 
of diastereoisomers was produced (83:17 ratio), which could not be separated.  As it was also 
not possible to separate the diastereoisomers after the final deprotection step, it was 
decided not to carry this material on further. 
ii) Hybrid Route Investigations 
It was next decided to investigate combining the phase transfer conditions with the protected 
iodoalanine used by Bregant and Tabor (Figure 2.10).4,9  This has the advantage of avoiding 
the elimination in situ and consequent diastereoisomer production observed in the Vederas 
method and could potentially eliminate some of the problems associated with the cesium 
carbonate coupling procedure. 
Figure 2.10: Hybrid Route to Formation of Lanthionine 
Reagents and Conditions: aq. NaHCO3 (pH 8.5), tetrabutylammonium bromide, ethyl acetate 
However, in practice it was found that the conditions were too harsh for iodoalanine 139 and 
that the aziridine formed before any of the desired product could be obtained.  The stability 
of 139 in pure water was next investigated and it was found that after just a few hours, the 
aziridine had already formed.  It was thus decided to abandon this line of investigation. 
iii) Optimisation of the Bregant and Tabor Route4 
Whilst carrying out these reactions, it was realised that there had been a great discrepancy in 
the ambient temperature of the laboratory; in a given one year period, the temperature had 
varied over a 30 C range.  The best results for the coupling reaction had been achieved when 
the laboratory temperature was lower and so it was decided to trial the reaction at 4 C 
rather than the previously reported room temperature.  Reassuringly, it was found that the 
reaction once again proceeded as expected and that formation of the first protected 
lanthionine compound 140 could be achieved, albeit still in a low yield of 35%. 
It was found that if the iodoalanine 139 is left to stir at 20 C, the formation of aziridine 143 
occured faster than the desired coupling reaction.  This explains the sudden apparent change 
in reactivity of the molecules and highlights the instability of the iodoalanine 139.  As it is less 
stable in solution than previously thought, it was decided to see if a more robust coupling 
procedure could be used before large scale coupling was attempted.  All further 
investigations were carried out at 4 C. 
The first line of investigation was into the possibility of forming the iodo compound in situ by 
using a Finkelstein reaction to convert the allyl/trityl bromoalanine 155 (Figure 2.11).11  It was 
hoped that decreasing the amount of time the iodoalanine was in solution could help to 
increase the overall yield of the coupling reaction.  To form the bromo compound, the 
chemistry used to form the allyl/Alloc protected bromoalanine 153 was again employed10 and 
produced the desired product from the allyl trityl serine (138) in 71% yield. 
Figure 2.11: Formation of Doubly Protected Bromoalanine 155 and in situ Finkelstein Reaction 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) carbon tetrabromide, triphenylphosphine, CH2Cl2 (ii) 1 eq. (62), 
10% sodium iodide, Cs2CO3, DMF 
In the first attempt, the sodium iodide was added before the cysteine (62).  Crude NMR 
spectra showed that the aziridine had been formed during the reaction and this suggested 
that the Finkelstein reaction was occurring faster than expected.  For this reason, the reaction 
was repeated with addition of the sodium iodide left until last, which gave the desired 
product in a 50% yield (Figure 2.12, entry 3).  A series of reactions were then carried out 
trialling different amounts of sodium iodide both with the Bregant and Tabor4 allyl/trityl 
compound 139 and also with the Vederas10 allyl/Alloc 153 compound (Figure 2.12, Table 2.1).

Table 2.1: Summary of Results from Coupling Investigations (* indicates diastereoisomeric 
ratio, as determined by NMR) 
As shown in table 2.1, coupling with the Alloc protected bromoalanine 153 gave a mixture of 
diastereoisomers, with more elimination occurring on a larger scale (Table 2.1, entries 8 and 
9).  Although the use of allyl/Alloc protected alanine does save two steps in the overall 
synthesis, the formation of both isomers prevents the use of this method, as they cannot be 
separated and would therefore be carried all the way through to the peptide synthesis stage.  
Thus, it was decided to use the trityl protecting group and change to the Alloc group once the 
coupling step had been completed. 
On increasing the amount of sodium iodide used from 10 to 20 mol%, the overall yield of the 
desired product decreased and more aziridine formation was observed (Table 2.1, entry 4).  A 
decrease in sodium iodide to 5 mol% showed no change in the overall yield (Table 2.1, entry 
5).  Reaction of the bromoalanine 155 without the addition of sodium iodide also gave the 
desired product, showing that the bromoalanine on its own is sufficiently reactive at this 
scale (Table 2.1, entry 6). 
For large scale synthesis, the bromoalanine compound 155 presents a far better choice of 
reagent for two reasons; firstly, it is stable at room temperature and does not form the 
aziridine by-product as readily and secondly, the synthesis is both quicker and easier and 
gives a greater yield (Table 2.1, entries 1 and 3).  To form the bromoalanine, the protected 
serine was reacted with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine for 1 h at 0 C.9  
Purification via column chromatography gave 155 in high purity with a yield typically between 
70% and 75%, while the iodoalanine Mitsunobu reaction conversely took 3 h at -10 C and 
requires a more complicated column. 
Hence, for the multi-gram scale coupling reaction, it was envisaged that bromoalanine 155 
would be used in place of iodoalanine 139 (Figure 2.13). 
Figure 2.13: Proposed Large Scale Coupling Procedure 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) 1 eq. Cs2CO3, 0.1 eq. I2, DMF, 4C, 4 h 
Unfortunately, although this reaction proceeded well on a small scale, on a 1 g scale no 
reaction occurred, presumably because the SN2 reaction with the bromoalanine 155 occurred 
at too slow a rate for a meaningful amount of product to be made in 4 h.  Thus it was decided 
not to use 155 but rather to use the iodoalanine 139 for large scale coupling reactions. 
It had already been established that the iodoalanine 139 was not stable in solution at room 
temperature.  For this reason, a second line of investigation was carried out involving the use 
of in situ reactions.  The advantage of an in situ method is that the iodoalanine would react as 
soon as it formed without the need for purification, in theory giving more of the desired 
product and reducing the amount of aziridine 143 produced.  As well as testing previously 
studied reactions, an alternative to the Mitsunobu reaction using triphenylphosphine and 
iodine was trialled.  This reaction is well-documented within literature12,13,14 and provides a 
safe alternative to the use of DEAD, which carries the risk of explosion when used in larger 
quantities. 
A trial reaction in which trityl allyl serine 138 was reacted with the iodine (Figure 2.14 was 
first performed.  This resulted in a 4:1 ratio of product 139 to aziridine 143 in 80% yield.

Reagents and Conditions: (i) 1.25 eq. PPh3, 1.3 eq. Imidazole, 1 eq. I2, CH2Cl2 
An in situ reaction in which the iodoalanine 139 produced was then reacted directly with 
cysteine (62) without intermediate purification was also trialled, to see if this could avoid the 
high proportion of aziridine formed.  The results of this and all the other in situ experiments 
are summarised in the table below (Figure 2.15, Table 2.2).

Table 2.2: Summary of the in situ Investigations into Coupling Reactions 
All reactions were carried out on a 1 g scale. 
As shown in table 2.2, both the scale-up of the in situ Finkelstein method (Table 2.2, entry 1) 
and the reaction of the iodoalanine 139 without intermediate purification (Table 2.2, entry 2) 
unfortunately yielded none of the desired product.  It is possible no reaction occurred in the 
in situ Mitsunobu reaction because the phosphine and DEAD side products interfered with 
the reaction causing more aziridine 143 to form.  The use of the alternative iodination 
conditions (Table 2.2, entry 3) gave rise to the formation of the desired product.  The yield 
over the two steps is the same as that achieved with the original method.  It was decided to 
compare this method to the improved original method of coupling the iodoalanine 139 at 
4 C to the protected cysteine (62) after purification.  On a 1 g scale, 895 mg of product was 
produced, corresponding to a yield of 58% which was a great improvement in yield and far 
closer to the literature reported yield of 70%.  Comparing like-for-like, the yield over 2 steps 
on a 1 g scale was 42% for this method, compared with 27% using the new iodination 
conditions. 
In conclusion, after initial problems with scale-up of the coupling reaction, three possible 
routes were investigated.  Use of the phase transfer conditions pioneered by Zhu and 
Schmidt9 gave rise to the formation of two diastereoisomers which could not be separated by 
column chromatography or recrystallization.  Extensive investigations into the coupling 
reaction used by Bregant and Tabor4 showed that although the iodoalanine 139 is much less 
stable than previously thought, good yields can be achieved in this reaction providing the 
temperature of the reaction is controlled.  Attempts to improve the yield through a variety of 
in situ one pot reactions unfortunately did not increase the efficiency of the reaction but did 
highlight the need for clean starting materials and decreased reaction temperatures (Figure 
2.16).

2.2.2c Optimisation of the Trityl Deprotection and Alloc Protection Steps 
In the original synthesis used in the Tabor group,4 a one-pot procedure involving removal of 
the trityl group and subsequent replacement with the Alloc protecting group was employed.  
However, on following this strategy, a low yield of 34% was obtained (Figure 2.17 and Table 
2.3, entry 1).  In order to produce multi-gram quantities of the orthogonally protected 
lanthionine 142, it was also necessary to optimise this step.  The reaction was repeated and 
the pH of the second step was monitored during the reaction.  It was found to have dropped 
to pH 4 over the course of the first hour but the addition of extra base and allyl 
chloroformate showed a slight decrease in yield to 26% (Table 2.3, entry 2).

It was observed that there was a significant drop in yield upon purification after the second 
step. Intermediate purification after the removal of the trityl group yielded the free amine 
159 in 49% yield and Alloc protection gave the desired product in quantitative yield (Table 
2.3, entry 3). 
It was also found that yields of the first stage were quite low and further optimisation was 
required before large scale work could be carried out. 
Waldmann and co-workers15 showed that changing the quantities of triethylsilane and 
trifluoroacetic acid used could help improve the yield.  A series of trial reactions were carried 
out in which the quantities of these two reagents were varied (Figure 2.18 and Table 2.4).

As the results show, the best yield was from using an excess of triethylsilane compared with 
trifluoroacetic acid.  A large scale reaction using the conditions from entry 4 gave the desired 
product in a 64% yield (Figure 2.19).

In conclusion, the breakdown of the one pot trityl deprotection and Alloc protection into two 
separate steps doubled the yield and resulted in the production of 500 mg of 141. 
2.2.2d Optimisation of the tBu Deprotection Step 
Although the final deprotection progressed well with a yield of 70%, the work-up procedure 
was very involved and it was necessary to find an alternative purification procedure.  The 
original procedure required the use of basic reverse phase column chromatography, followed 
by acidification of the aqueous layer and extraction with chloroform, before drying the 
organic layer and removing the solvent in vacuo.  Although this method is adequate for small 
scale syntheses, this would become extremely cumbersome when using larger quantities of 
material. 
In 2008, Vederas and co-workers10 published an alternative method for the production of 
orthogonally protected lanthionine in which purification of the final stage was carried out 
using recrystallisation from toluene.  Pleasingly, this purification method worked with 
comparable yields (76% against 71% for the reverse phase column). 
2.2.2e Conclusions from the Small Scale Synthesis Work 
In order to produce multi-gram quantities of the orthogonally protected lanthionine 142 for 
peptide synthesis, it was necessary to spend time optimising each step to ensure the greatest 
possible efficiency of the synthesis on a large scale.  Improvements were made in the 
formation of the protected amino acid intermediates, which allowed for production of large 
quantities (over 100 g) of iodoalanine 139 and doubly protected cysteine (62). 
In the case of iodoalanine 139, the one-pot procedure to form trityl allyl serine (138) saves 
time and provides an easier purification procedure, whilst increasing the yield from 78% over 
two steps to 91% in a single step procedure.  For the production of doubly protected cysteine 
(62), both the purification of the doubly protected cystine (135) via recrystallisation and the 
alternative cleavage procedure helped to increase the yield over three steps from 12% to 
The greatest challenge was in improving the coupling of these two intermediates to form 
protected lanthionine 140.  A series of trial reactions were carried out using phase-transfer 
techniques and a variety of in situ methods.  It was concluded that carrying out the reaction 
at reduced temperature gave the desired product in good yield (58%). 
The trityl deprotection and Alloc protection steps were originally carried out in a one-pot 
process, giving an overall yield of 34%.  Investigation into purification techniques showed that 
a higher yield was obtained by breaking the reaction into two steps and purifying at the 
intermediate stage.  Subsequent investigations into the trityl deprotection step showed that 
changing the ratio of trifluoroacetic acid to triethylsilane significantly improved the yield of 
the first step.  The new procedure gave a yield of 64% over the two steps, which was almost 
double the previous result. 
Finally, investigations into an alternative purification for the production of the final product 
have found a recrystallisation technique which will save time and produce the desired 
product as white solid ready for solid phase peptide synthesis.  The overall yield for the seven 
step synthesis starting from L-serine was 18% and resulted in the production of 120 mg of 
142 (Figure 2.20).

2.3 Large Scale Synthesis 
The large scale synthesis was carried out at the European Knowledge Centre of Eisai Ltd. in 
Hatfield, UK.  Preparation of trityl allyl serine (138) and doubly protected cystine (135) was 
outsourced to Oxygen Healthcare, Cambridge, UK, which is part of Piramal Enterprises Ltd, 
Mumbai, India, who produced 100 g of each compound following the procedures developed 
during the small scale investigations. 
2.3.1 Reaction Monitoring and Safety Concerns16,17 
When scaling up reactions, a number of problems can be encountered; with large solution 
volumes, it is possible to have localised exotherms, which can arise from non-uniform stirring 
and can contribute to unwanted side reactions occurring in the reaction vessel.  A second 
problem occurs with the overall volume: on a small scale, reactions tend to be more dilute to 
allow for meaningful volumes of solvent to be used.  However, upon scaling up, these 
volumes can rapidly become too large to handle easily and so a more concentrated reaction 
mixture is often used.  This again brings into question the possibility of unwanted side 
reactions and exotherms.  Before large scale synthesis could be carried out, it was important 
to carry out the synthesis on a medium scale to monitor all the temperature changes within 
the reaction vessel and to ensure all the steps behaved as expected. 
This was particularly important for the Mitsunobu step to form iodoalanine 139 because the 
use of DEAD carries with it a risk of explosion.  Although the replacement of DEAD with DIAD 
was investigated at this stage, none of the desired product formed, possibly due to the 
increased size of the ligand preventing the reaction occurring with the starting material. 
The order of addition was also investigated.  The generally accepted reaction is believed to 
proceed via the formation of a quaternary phosphonium salt (162).  Attack by the alcohol 
(163) leads to formation of an alkoxy phosphonium intermediate (165), which is followed by 
an SN2 displacement of the triphenylphosphine by an iodide nucleophile (166) to give the 
product (167, Figure 2.21). 
Figure 2.21: Generally Accepted Mechanism for a Mitsunobu Reaction18 
In line with this procedure, the DEAD was added slowly to a stirred solution of PPh3 in 
dichloromethane, followed by addition of methyl iodide and lastly addition of allyl trityl 
serine (138).  The reaction was carried out on a 10 g scale to allow meaningful monitoring of 
the changes in temperature.  A large spike was observed upon initial addition of DEAD from -
  9.4 C to + 12.0 C and consequently addition was carried out slowly over 40 minutes.  
Similarly, the addition of methyl iodide triggered another rapid increase in temperature.  
Addition of allyl trityl serine (138) did not produce any significant change in temperature.  
Unfortunately, after the requisite 3 h, none of the desired product was formed and only 
unreacted starting material was retrieved from the reaction mixture.  This was in line with 
previous observations within the group19 suggesting that the reaction did not follow the 
generally accepted mechanistic pathway.  As the addition of DEAD caused a large increase in 
temperature, it was decided to try adding it in as a solution in dichloromethane. 
The original method for forming the iodoalanine 139 involved dissolving the allyl trityl serine 
(138) and triphenylphosphine in dichloromethane and adding DEAD dropwise to the solution 
before adding methyl iodide.  This reaction was repeated on a 10 g scale and the temperature 
and progress of the reaction was monitored.  Again, the addition of DEAD in dichloromethane 
caused a large increase in temperature but careful slow addition ensured the temperature 
inside the vessel never exceeded 12.0 C.  Addition of methyl iodide also caused a sudden 
increase in temperature and it was decided to add the rest in a solution of dichloromethane 
as well.  This again led to easier control of the temperature. 
The reaction was followed by LC-MS (please see Appendix 1) and peaks corresponding to an 
allyl trityl serine-triphenylphosphine adduct 169 and both methylated 170 and non-
methylated 164 DEAD side products were observed (Figure 2.22). 
Figure 2.22: Possible Structures of Intermediates and Side Products Observed by LC-MS during 
the Mitsunobu Iodination Reaction 
Current understanding of the Mitsunobu mechanism suggests that multiple pathways are at 
play, not just the one detailed in (Figure 2.21) above.20,21  Observations have shown other 
DEAD side products resulting from reaction with the nucleophile, which is in agreement with 
the formation of (170).  As well as degradation pathways, it is also thought that a second 
phosphorous species (172) forms from reaction of triphenylphosphine with two alcohol 
molecules (Figure 2.23).  In this case, two SN2 displacements occur to give the desired product 
(167) and triphenylphosphine oxide (168).  
Figure 2.23: A Second Mechanistic Pathway for the Mitsunobu Reaction20,21 
The double addition product (172) was not observed in the LC-MS data collected during these 
reactions and the order of addition clearly plays an important role in this reaction.  This 
suggests that perhaps the traditional Mitsunobu reaction is not occurring and that the role 
of the DEAD is actually that of an organic base.  This is in agreement with the observation in 
the optimisation work that the reaction also works well when DEAD is replaced with 
imidazole, albeit giving a higher proportion of aziridine 143 formation.  One reaction omitting 
the DEAD entirely and using just triphenylphosphine and iodine12 was also tried but this did 
not lead to formation of any of the desired product, presumably due to the large amount of 
HI present, causing side reactions to occur. 
A possible reaction mechanism for the iodination is detailed below (Figure 2.24).  The 
presence of a triphenylphosphine-serine adduct (163) is confirmed.  It is possible that this 
activated phosphine then reacts with the DEAD to give intermediate (173).  Here the adduct 
can either methylate or protonate as shown (Figure 2.24, paths a and b).  A final SN2 
displacement then gives the desired product, triphenylphosphine and the observed side 
products (164) and (170). 
Figure 2.24: A Possible Mechanistic Pathway for the Iodination Reaction 
Unfortunately, it was beyond the scope of this project to investigate this mechanism any 
further but this certainly suggests that the reaction is following an alternative mechanistic 
pathway. 
The large scale reactions were carried out according to the original method described by 
Bregant and Tabor.4  The reaction proceeded to completion in 3 h, as observed when carried 
out on small scale and produced 8.4 g (65%) of the iodoalanine 139.  When carried out on a 
30 g scale, 18.1 g of the desired product were formed.  This was a slightly reduced yield of 
47% but provided sufficient material to carry on with the synthesis. 
2.3.2 Results and Summary of the Large Scale Synthesis Work 
The Mitsunobu reaction provided the greatest safety concerns and although the temperature 
of all other reactions was monitored, no significant changes in temperature were observed. 
The reduction of the doubly protected cystine (135) to produce cysteine (62) proceeded 
smoothly and produced 9.5 g from 10 g of starting material (95%).  The improved reaction 
and work up meant that no further purification was required.  This translated exactly on 
scale-up to produce 28.7 g from 30 g of starting material, which was again a yield of 95% and 
did not require further purification. 
A trial coupling reaction using 7.36 g of iodoalanine 139 gave 6.84 g of the trityl protected 
lanthionine 140, which was a yield of 61%.  Scaling up the coupling reaction saw a slight 
decrease in yield to 48% but a total of 30 g of 140 was produced.  Trityl deprotection saw a 
slight drop in yield to 55% and Alloc protection also saw a slight drop to 85%.  Overall, 10.3 g 
of 142 was produced (Figure 2.25). 
Figure 2.25: Summary of the Large Scale Synthesis 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) dithiothreitol, Et3N, CH2Cl2 (ii) PPh3, DEAD, CH3I, CH2Cl2 (iii)

chloroformate, 1,4-dioxane (vi) trifluoroacetic acid, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
The aim of this work was to produce approximately 10 g of 141.  It was not known whether or 
not the removal of the tBu affected the stability of the compound and so only half of this 
material was used in the final step.  The rest was stored as 141 for use at a later point.  The 
large scale recrystallisation proceeded well with 3.00 g (66%) of white crystals produced.  
Starting from trityl allyl serine (138), the yield was 10% over 4 steps at large scale and 18% on 
a 10 g scale, which provided enough material to carry out multiple peptide syntheses. 
2.4 Conclusions 
Extensive research into the synthesis of orthogonally protected lanthionine resulted in the 
design of an improved, more robust route which worked well on a small scale.  Improvements 
were made in the protection of the constituent amino acids both in the reaction and 
purification procedures, which allowed the synthesis of the intermediates to be outsourced.  
Re-evaluation of the coupling procedure highlighted the instability of the iodoalanine 
intermediate 139 and showed that reducing the temperature of the reaction could help 
control the reaction and prevent unwanted side reactions from occurring.  A change in 
reactant ratio improved the efficiency of the trityl deprotection reaction.  Breaking the one-
pot deprotection and subsequent Alloc re-protection into a two-step process increased the 
yield.  Finally, a change in purification procedure of the final deprotection decreased the time 
taken to produce the final product and also gave the product in higher purity. 
Pleasingly, this route also translated well to large scale processing and it was possible to use 
this method in an industrial setting to produce multi-gram quantities of the desired novel 
diastereoisomer of lanthionine 142.  Investigations into the large scale Mitsunobu reaction 
showed that the reaction occurred by a non-conventional mechanism which could be 
controlled by careful addition of the reactants in solution with dichloromethane, thereby 
decreasing the risk of unexpected exotherms and explosions.  The synthesis progressed well 
and produced 3.00 g of orthogonally protected lanthionine 142, which can now be 
incorporated into peptides and allows a full and thorough investigation of the structure-
activity relationship of the Nav1.7 ion channel to be carried out.

3. Chapter 3: Synthesis of ProTx-II (22) and Truncated Analogues 
This chapter details the attempts to synthesise ProTx-II (22) and a group of truncated 
analogues which were tested for their ability to bind to the Nav1.7 ion channel.  To begin 
with, a group of analogues were synthesised based on truncated sections of the original 
peptide by dividing it into units as determined by the disulfide rings.  This gave a total of 
three single and two double ring analogues (compounds 175  179, Figure 3.1). 
Figure 3.1: Structure of ProTx-II (22) and Suggested Analogues for Synthesis 
X = either cysteine or lanthionine to give a disulfide or thioether bond, A = lanthionine bond 
The next group of analogues investigated the effect of replacing one of the disulfide 
bonds in the ProTx-II (22) structure with a thioether linkage by the addition of an 
orthogonally protected lanthionine moiety.  This had the dual advantage of both 
preventing the degradation of the peptide ring by disulfide cleavage and decreasing the 
ring size to see if this subtle alteration has an influence on binding affinity.  To investigate 
the incorporation of a thioether linkage in to the SPPS protocol, a methodology study was 
carried out using a single ring structure for simplicity before attention was focussed on 
the full analogues of ProTx-II (22). 
3.1 Synthesis of ProTx-II (22) 
ProTx-II (22) is extracted from the venom of the Peruvian Green Velvet Tarantula1 
(Thrixopelma pruriens).  Although it is possible to purchase the venom commercially, it is 
very expensive (109 for 100 g on Sigma Aldrich) so it was first necessary to investigate 
the chemical synthesis. 
To make the straight chain sequence (YCQKWMWTCDSERKCCEGMVCRLWCKKKLW), 
standard Fmoc SPPS protocols were used.  The initial synthesis provided a low yield of the 
crude peptide, which prompted a short investigation into peptide cleavage times (Table 
3.1). 
Standard cleavage of the peptide from an acid labile resin uses a cocktail of TFA, 
ethanedithiol, triisopropylsilane and water in the ratio 95:2.5:1:1.2  Traditionally, this is 
left for 3 h before collecting the cleavage solution2 and precipitating it into diethyl ether.  
In this case, it was found that two shorter cleavage times (Table 3.1, Entries 2 and 3) gave 
a higher yield of crude peptide. 
Entry Cleavage Time 1 (min) Cleavage Time 2 (min) Cleavage Time 3 (min) Yield 
1 180 - - 11% 
2 30 60 90 22% 
3 30 70 - 23% 
Table 3.1: Short Investigation into Cleavage Times 
It is known that tryptophan can re-attach to the resin3 if left for a long period of time and 
so it is likely that the shorter reaction time allows for cleavage of the peptide from the 
resin but does not allow time for the counter reaction to occur.  For the rest of this work, 
this double cleavage procedure was followed. 
3.1.1 Cyclisation and Structure Determination of ProTx-II (22) 
In 2002, Middleton et al.1 published the chemical synthesis of ProTx-II (22).  They also 
employed standard SPPS protocols to make the straight chain sequence of ProTx-II (22) 
and claimed that upon cleavage from the resin, the peptide could be cyclised by dissolving 
the peptide in a solution containing 2 M Urea, 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and a mixture of 
reduced and oxidised glutathione.  However, attempts to re-create these conditions did 
not yield any of the desired product (Table 3.2, Entry 1).  A change in concentration also 
did not produce the cyclised peptide (Table 3.2, Entry 2).  After investigating another 
buffer, it was found that the peptide could easily be cyclised in pure water at a 
concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.  This method has the advantage of not requiring dialysis to 
remove the peptide from the buffer solution and instead the volume of solvent can be 
reduced in vacuo and then purified directly by HPLC.

Table 3.2: Investigation into Cyclisation Conditions 
The cyclised peptide loses six protons from the sulfhydryl side chains on the cysteines to 
form three disulfide bonds, giving the native peptide mass of 3826 Da.  Although the 
reaction can be followed by observing the decrease in mass using an LC-MS machine, this 
method does not give information on the connectivity of the disulfide bonds.  There are 
15 possible combinations for bonding the six cysteine residues and Middleton et al.1 
determined the connectivity using a double digestion protocol in conjunction with MALDI 
analysis (Figure 3.2).  Firstly, the peptide was dissolved in Tris buffer and subjected to 
trypsin digestion to cleave in six places (Figure 3.2).  This was followed by the addition of 
the Glu-C enzyme to cleave between the glutamate and glycine residues.  Assuming the 
correct connectivity, this should give rise to two major fragments: the first containing the 
2  5 disulfide bond and the second containing the other four cysteine residues with 
masses of 1776 and 1438 amu respectively. 
Figure 3.2: Double Digestion of ProTx-II 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Trypsin Digestion (ii) Glu-C Digestion 
On repetition of this protocol, the mass of 1438 was observed but a number of problems 
were also encountered.  In the case of a system as tightly bound together as an ICK 
peptide, it was difficult to cleave with trypsin at all six sites on the peptide.  This led to a 
complex mass spectrum, comprised of many fragments of ProTx-II as well as the trypsin 
and Glu-C enzymes.  To add to this difficulty, some oxidation of ProTx-II was also 
observed.  Attempts to decrease complexity of the spectrum by using resin-bound trypsin 
removed the trypsin peaks from the data but did not prevent the incomplete cleavage and 
oxidation problems previously observed. 
Middleton et al. continued with the structure determination by using post-source decay 
(PSD) experiments to show the final connectivity; it was claimed that the PSD experiment 
cleaved the amide bond between the two cysteine residues to give the two separated 
fragments, each containing a disulfide bond.  The difference in mass in this case will be 
determined by which fragment contains the glutamate residue, which will in turn 
conclude the connectivity (Figure 3.3). 
Figure 3.3: PSD Experimental Results 
A  correct connectivity, B  incorrect connectivity 
As the name suggests, fragmentation in a post source decay experiment occurs after the 
acceleration region of the mass spectrometer.  The fragmentation observed is due to 
metastable ions breaking down as a result of the excess energy they possess as they leave 
the source but before they reach the detector.  In general, the efficiency of this type of 
fragmentation is low and tends to result in a high level of background noise.4 
When using metastable ions as the source for an experiment, it is difficult to control 
exactly which bonds are broken during post source decay and it was not possible to 
reproduce the experimental data from the PSD experiments.a  Thus, using this method, 
the connectivity was narrowed down to two possible structures, containing either 1-3 and 
4-6 disulfide bonds or the desired 1-4, 3-6 disulfide bonds (Figure 3.4). 
Figure 3.4: Possible Connectivity in Synthesised ProTx-II 
A  correct connectivity, B  incorrect connectivity 
In 2004, Chagot et al.5 published structural NMR data on the related peptide PaTx-I, which 
shares 83% homology with ProTx-II (Figure 3.5). 
Figure 3.5: Structures of ProTx-II (22) and PaTx-I (190) 
Aside from the flexible C-terminal, PaTx-I and ProTx-II share only two differences in amino 
acids at positions 12 and 19.  From this data, it was reasonable to assume that, although 
the PSD experiments described by Middleton et al. could not be repeated, the correct 
connectivity could be assigned as the desired 1  4, 2  5, 3  6 binding observed in all 
reported ICK peptides.  This structure was finally confirmed with the release of a solution 
NMR structure of ProTx-II by Park et al.6 in 2014 (Chapter 5). 
As mentioned previously, it is possible to purchase ProTx-II from commercial sources.  In 
almost all cases, it is made synthetically rather than isolated directly from the tarantula, 
due to the low quantities obtained from venom and the large degree of purification 
required.  To add to the body of evidence that the ProTx-II synthesised in-house was the 
a Post-Source Decay Experiments were carried out by Dr. C. Hyde, University College London 
same as that purchased commercially, analytical HPLC analysis was run using a gradient of 
5  95% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) (Figures 3.6 - 3.8). 
Figure 3.6 HPLC Trace Showing Injection of Synthesised ProTx-II 
Figure 3.7: HPLC Trace Showing Injection of Purchased ProTx-II 
Figure 3.8: HPLC Trace Showing Combined Injection of Synthesised and Purchased ProTx-II 
HPLC data has shown that the traces of commercially available peptide purchased from 
Tocris and that synthesised in house overlap, which suggests that the connectivity of 
these peptides is likely to be the same. 
3.2 Synthesis of Disulfide Bridge Truncated Analogues 
ProTx-II (22) was shown to have good inhibitory effects of the Nav1.7 channel in vitro but 
showed comparatively poor results in vivo, owing to difficulties in crossing the blood-
nerve barrier.7  With no crystal structure of the ion channel currently available, it is 
difficult to know which part of the peptide is important in binding.  To investigate this, a 
series of smaller analogues based on truncated sections of the original peptide were 
synthesised. 
3.2.1 Synthesis of Single Ring Disulfide Analogues 
The simplest compounds investigated in this thesis are the single ring disulfide analogues 
of ProTx-II (22).  The structures of these compounds are determined by the disulfide 
bonds in the original peptide to give small cyclic peptides of 14  18 amino acids in length 
(Figure 3.9).  A recent publication by Park et al.6 has shown that the tail fragment KKKLW 
is important in binding.  To test this theory, two versions of the C-terminal ring were made 
with and without the tail fragment. 
Figure 3.9: Single Ring Disulfide Analogues 
To synthesise these analogues, standard Fmoc SPPS protocols were again used, as well as 
the cleavage and cyclisation procedures detailed in section 3.1.  Peptide 191 was used to 
investigate the use of different resins to see if this had an effect on the overall yield of the 
product (Table 3.3). 
Entry Resin Loading (mmol/g) Yield (%) 
1 NovaSyn TGA 0.2 49 
2 NovaSyn TGT 0.19 55 
3 LL-Wang 0.24 38 
4 Cl-Trt 0.73 53 
5 Low Loading Cl-Trt 0.11 52 
Table 3.3: Summary of Investigations into the Effect of Resin on Yield 
The best result used the highly acid sensitive TGT resin (Table 3.3, Entry 2), which gave the 
product in high yield and good purity.  The synthesis of the other analogues 192, 193 and 
194 were thus carried out using the appropriately loaded TGT resins to give them in yields 
of 16%, 14% and 26% respectively.  It is interesting to note that although it was easy to 
form both 192 and 193, it was far more difficult to form 194.  Although the latter was 
eventually formed in good yield, a number of failed attempts were first recorded, where 
either uncyclised strands of a peptide of incorrect mass were formed or the peptide 
would not fold to give the desired product but instead decomposed.  As the protocol for 
forming the ring did not change from that employed to form the previous two structures, 
it was postulated that the increased size of the ring could make cyclisation more difficult, 
leading to a low yield and a less reliable reaction.  It is also possible that this specific 
sequence could potentially have problems with stability, which again would lead to 
difficulties in synthesis of the peptide. 
3.2.2 Synthesis of Double Ring Disulfide Analogues 
Having synthesised the four single disulfide rings, the level of complexity was increased to 
form the interlocking double ring analogues (Figure 3.10). 
Figure 3.10: Double Ring Disulfide Analogues 
In order to control the connectivity of the disulfide bonds, it was necessary to employ 
orthogonal protecting groups on the cysteine side chains.  A number of different 
orthogonal protecting groups were employed to form both compound 195 and 196 (Table 
3.4).

5 196 Trt/tBu Decomposition 
6 196 Trt/StBu Decomposition 
7 196 Trt x 4 Decomposition 
Table 3.4: Summary of Investigations into the Use of Orthogonal Protecting Groups 
The synthesis of 196 proved particularly difficult.  Although it was possible to make the 
uncyclised peptide with protected cysteine side chains, as soon as attempts at 
deprotection and folding took place, the peptide appeared to break down often leading to 
the formation of a black solid.  To test to see if the structure was inherently unstable, all 
four cysteines were protected using the trityl group and then simultaneously deprotected 
along with cleavage from the resin (Table 3.4, Entry 7).  Although the uncyclised peptide 
could be formed, once the peptide was left to stir in water, decomposition was again 
observed, suggesting that the third disulfide bond is required in order to form a stable 
peptide.  Conversely, for compound 195, the deprotection and subsequent cyclisation of 
the tetra-trityl protected peptide did yield the required product (Table 3.4, Entry 3), 
although without the control over the deprotection step, no guarantee of correct 
regioselectivity could be given.  This finding is consistent with the formation of the single 
rings, where considerable difficulty in forming 194 was also observed, suggesting that the 
increase in size makes it more difficult to form or that this end of the peptide structure 
could be inherently unstable on its own. 
In contrast with the findings for structure 196, peptide 195 was found to form under a 
number of different conditions.  However, upon scale up of the synthesis, it was found 
that although the uncyclised peptide was again observed by LC-MS, the cyclisation and 
subsequent purification did not yield any of the desired product.  Prior to purification, 
small amounts of the desired peptide were observed but could never be isolated.  
Cyclisation on resin followed by cleavage was also attempted but again resulted in the 
decomposition of the peptide. 
It was postulated that, as with peptide 196, the structure is inherently unstable without 
the third disulfide bond for stability, which would account for the observation of several 
smaller fragments of the peptide by LC-MS. 
3.2.3 Conclusions 
A total of four different disulfide-containing single ring analogues of ProTx-II (22) were 
successfully synthesised and purified for testing on the Nav1.7 ion channel.  Despite 
numerous attempts to produce the double ring analogues, involving the use of various 
protecting groups, deprotection chemistries and cyclisation procedures, only the straight 
chain analogues could be formed.  These were found to be inherently unstable in solution 
and decomposed rapidly before isolation could be carried out, leading to the conclusion 
that the double ring analogues were not stable enough to be submitted for further 
analysis or testing on the Nav1.7 ion channel. 
3.3 Synthesis of Thioether Bridge Truncated Analogues 
3.3.1 Introduction 
Having successfully synthesised the library of single ring disulfide-containing analogues, 
investigations into the incorporation of a thioether bridge into the peptide sequence were 
begun.  The work began with the introduction of the orthogonally protected Lanthionine 
moiety 142 produced in Chapter 2. 
Previous work in the Tabor group8 has shown that lanthionine could be added in to an 
SPPS sequence (Figure 3.11).  To begin, the chain is built up using the standard Fmoc SPPS 
protocol (Fmoc deprotection using 40% piperidine, followed by amino acid addition using 
HBTU and DIPEA) to give 197.  The lanthionine moiety is incorporated using the non-
uronium based coupling reagents HOAt and PyAOP in the presence of DIPEA to generate 
Figure 3.11: Methodology for the Incorporation and Cyclisation of Orthogonally Protected 
Lanthionine (142) into a Peptide Sequence 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) HOAt, PyAOP, DIPEA, lanthionine (142), DMF (ii) 40% 
piperidine in DMF, then amino acid, HBTU, DIPEA, DMF (iii) 40% piperidine in DMF, then

FmocLysOH, HBTU, DIPEA, DMF (vi) 40% piperidine in DMF (vii) TFA, ethanedithiol, 
triisopropylsilane, water 
Once the lanthionine moiety was successfully installed, the classical Fmoc SPPS protocol 
was used to build up the amino acid chain to the desired length 199.  To cyclise the 
peptide, the Fmoc group was again removed using piperidine and the allyl and Alloc 
groups are then removed using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium and 1,3-
dimethylbarbituic acid to give the fully deprotected peptide 200.  Cyclisation again 
employed the HOAt and PyAOP conditions to give 201.  These reagents were used 
because it has been shown that uronium based coupling reagents such as HBTU can react 
with the free amine after Alloc deprotection in an irreversible guanylation reaction,9 
which then could not be used to continue the peptide synthesis.  Use of PyAOP prevents 
this from occurring.  The free amino group was then ready to react with the next Fmoc 
protected amino acid to give 202.  To complete the synthesis, one last Fmoc deprotection 
using 40% piperidine was carried out followed by TFA-mediated cleavage from the resin 
with simultaneous side chain deprotection to give 204, which can be purified by HPLC. 
Previous work within the Tabor group8,10 has focussed on the SPPS synthesis of sections of 
the antibiotic Nisin, a lantibiotic peptide containing 34 amino acids and five lanthionine 
bridges.  The orthogonal protecting groups allowed for control of the regiochemistry and 
cyclisation to give the desired product.  However, yields of the lanthionine containing 
rings were typically low and required extensive, difficult purification.  The largest ring in 
Nisin contains five amino acids between the two stereocentres of lanthionine, whereas 
the smallest ring in this work contains nine residues.  Combining the increased ring size 
and a novel diastereomer of lanthionine with low yields and difficult purification 
procedures meant a greater challenge for the established protocol and provided an 
opportunity for new methodology studies. 
3.3.2 Synthesis of Single Ring Lanthionine Analogues 
As a direct comparison to the single ring disulfide analogues, the first compounds to be 
synthesised were the single ring lanthionine-containing thioether analogues (Figure 3.12). 
Figure 3.12: Single Ring Thioether Analogues 
A trial synthesis of compound 205 showed that the product could be formed using the 
orthogonal peptide synthesis protocol described above but that, as well as forming the 
desired product, some of the peptide sequence minus lanthionine 209 was also formed 
(Figure 3.13). 
Figure 3.13: Structure of the Desired Peptide 205 and the Peptide Without Lanthionine 
Incorporation 209 
Separation of these two compounds was difficult by HPLC and led to a very low amount of 
the pure desired product (less than 1 mg).  It was decided to investigate the use of a 
microwave for the incorporation and cyclisation of the lanthionine to see if this could 
improve the yield of the reaction and ease the purification difficulties. 
In 1991, Yu et al.11,12 reported that using the microwave could significantly increase the 
coupling efficiency of a reaction, particularly with those amino acids containing bulky side 
chain groups.  Their experiments were performed in a standard kitchen microwave, which 
was adapted to allow a stream of nitrogen to pass through a vessel in the centre of the 
machine.  Although the kitchen equipment has now been replaced by specially designed 
apparatus in which temperature and duration of the microwaves can be carefully 
controlled, the principles of microwave-assisted peptide synthesis remain unchanged.  
Since its initial conception, it has gone from strength to strength and can now be 
employed for both the coupling and deprotection steps, with optimised reaction times 
decreasing from 120 minutes to as low as 2 minutes.13 
Further investigations into the use of a microwave have shown that cysteine is susceptible 
to racemisation at higher temperatures.  This is thought to occur as a result of abstraction 
of the -proton by a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine in solution.  This can be 
reduced by decreasing the temperature of the reaction from 80 C to 50 C.14 
Thus the advantages to the microwave are two-fold: it not only gives a more reliable 
coupling procedure but also decreases the time required to make a peptide chain, 
allowing longer peptides to be synthesised quickly and efficiently.  Microwave assisted 
SPPS has shown great improvements in the efficiency of reactions involving amino acids 
with bulky side chains.  It was therefore hoped that employing the use of a microwave 
reactor for the addition of orthogonally protected lanthionine (142) would decrease the 
amount of peptide produced which did not contain the lanthionine moiety and ease some 
of the purification problems encountered. 
Previous investigations with the single disulfide rings had shown good overall yields for 
many types of resin.  To see which type of resin would give the best results, trial 
microwave syntheses were set up using the three resins which showed the highest yields 
for the equivalent disulfide compound, namely the NovaSyn TGT resin and Cl-Trt resin.  It 
was postulated that higher loading resins like the Cl-Trt resin could result in 
polymerisation instead of cyclisation of the lanthionine bridge.  For this reason, it was 
decided to trial both the normal and the knock-down (low-loading, LL) Cl-Trt resin.15,16 
The standard SPPS protocol was then followed to form the peptide, with the lanthionine 
addition step using the microwave at a given temperature for a pre-determined duration 
(Table 3.5).

Table 3.5: Summary of Preliminary Investigations into the Use of the Microwave for 
Incorporation of Lanthionine (142) into the Peptide Sequence 
The initial small-scale reactions showed promise, proving it was possible to incorporate a 
thioether linkage into the peptide synthesis using the microwave.  The results also show 
that low loading resins are preferred, as the use of a high loading resin led to 
polymerisation rather than formation of the desired single ring peptide (Table 3.5, Entries 
7  9).  It was found that the resins could tolerate temperatures of up to 70 C and could 
be subjected to microwaves for at least seven minutes.  For the next set of experiments, it 
was decided to increase the time of the reactions from seven to ten minutes, to see if this 
could be tolerated and if it would increase the yield of the reaction (Table 3.6).  Having 
ascertained that low loading resins were preferred, these reactions were carried out using 
the NovaSyn TGT and low loading chlorotrityl resins only.

Table 3.6: Summary of Further Investigations into the Use of the Microwave for 
Incorporation of Lanthionine (142) into the Peptide Sequence 
The most surprising result was that on scaling up the synthesis, the reactions using low 
loading chlorotrityl resin no longer produced peptides at the end of the synthesis (Table 
3.6, Entries 4  6).  The resin was modified by partially capping the resin with acetic 
anhydride and then calculating the loading by measuring the UV absorption (see Chapter 
7.3.3 for details).  However, it was found that, despite careful procedures, it was difficult 
to achieve reproducible results with this resin and that loading could differ greatly from 
batch to batch, with full end-capping occurring despite using fewer than the required 
number of equivalents of acetic anhydride.  This accounted for the 0% yield for this resin 
(Table 3.6, Entries 4  6) and as the process proved so unreliable, it was decided to focus 
on the NovaSyn TGT resin, which gave the best results for the disulfide analogues as well. 
The results showed that although both 60 C and 70 C were tolerated by the resin (Table 
3.6, Entries 1 and 3), the higher temperature did start to show a decrease in yield for the 
peptide synthesis.  Similarly, prolonged exposure to microwaves (Table 3.6, Entries 1 and 
2) was also found to have a detrimental effect on the yield, which decreased by a factor of 
four to just 2%.  Therefore, it was concluded that milder conditions gave the best yield. 
Finally, the best microwave condition was compared with the non-microwave conditions 
pioneered by Bregant and Tabor,8 in which the reaction was left to agitate at room 
temperature for 2 h.  As the results show (Table 3.6, Entries 1 and 8) both methods 
yielded the same amount of peptide; however, the use of the microwave for the 
installation of orthogonally protected lanthionine (142) into the peptide sequence has the 
dual advantages of saving time and easing purification, as no peptide chain minus 
lanthionine was observed in the crude LC-MS results, thus making purification by HPLC 
both quicker and simpler.  The new reaction conditions yielded 3 mg of 205 after 
purification by HPLC, which could then be tested directly on the Nav1.7 ion channel. 
Figure 3.14: Structures of the Single Ring Thioether Analogues 
Having successfully synthesised one analogue using the new methodology, attention was 
turned to the other rings 206, 207 and 208 (Figure 3.14).  Pleasingly, the protocol was 
found to work for 206 and 207, producing 4 mg and 0.5 mg respectively after HPLC 
purification.  However, the synthesis of 208 proved far more challenging; as with the 
disulfide analogue 194, many truncated versions of the straight-chain peptide were 
observed, with none of the desired product, despite many repetitions of the synthesis.  It 
was again concluded that this was due to the large size of the ring making it difficult for 
the peptide to cyclise. 
3.3.3 Synthesis of Double Ring Lanthionine Analogues 
Having synthesised the single thioether rings, the level of complexity was increased to 
form the interlocking double ring analogues (Figure 3.15).  Prior to the microwave 
methodology experiments, investigations into the formation of these compounds were 
carried out in parallel with the research into the single ring lanthionine containing 
analogues.  However, as with the disulfide analogues, it was found that none of the 
desired straight chain analogues were formed.  Instead many shorter peptides were 
formed, which did not contain the thioether bridge. 
Figure 3.15: Double Ring Thioether Analogues 
These larger, more complicated structures were the first real test of the versatility of the 
new methodology and it was hoped that the complex structures could be synthesised by 
employing the microwave-assisted protocol.  Given the trouble encountered with the 
double disulfide ring analogues, it was perhaps not surprising to discover that although 
traces of some of the peptides were seen in crude LC-MS analysis, upon purification, none 
of the desired products were observed.  As initial analysis showed that the compounds 
were present, it was decided that the microwave protocol itself was not the problem but 
again the inherent stability of the compounds was called into question.  As the peptides 
did not stay in solution long enough for purification to occur, these analogues were also 
not submitted for biological testing and instead it was decided to focus on the synthesis of 
the full length analogues. 
3.4 Synthesis of Triple Ring Lanthionine Analogues 
The final lanthionine analogues to be added to the library were those based on the full 
structure of ProTx-II (22).  In these molecules, one disulfide bond is replaced by a 
lanthionine moiety to give two disulfide bonds and one thioether linkage (Figure 3.16).  
The triple ring analogues are the most interesting compounds from the lanthionine-
containing analogues as they are closest in shape and size to the naturally occurring 
ProTx-II (22). 
Previous work carried out by other groups had suggested that by changing the disulfide 
bond in a peptide to a thioether linkage, the relative stability of the peptide in vivo could 
be increased whilst still maintaining good levels of activity;17,18 Cui et al.17 tested thioether 
and biscarba linked analogues of tachyplesin I (TPI-1) which were stable to reducing 
agents and disulfide isomerases but maintained good activity as measured by the minimal 
inhibitory concentration values.  Similarly, Dekan et al.18 showed that activity was also 
maintained when one of the disulfide bonds in -conotoxin IMI was replaced by a 
thioether bridge.  With this in mind, it was decided to try replacing each disulfide bond in 
turn with a thioether bridge (Figure 3.16). 
Figure 3.16: Triple Ring Thioether Analogues 
The syntheses of the full analogues of ProTx-II (22) were the most challenging use of the 
methodology thus far, due to the increased size of the compounds and the intricate 
connectivity of the disulfide bonds and the thioether linkage. 
Two major problems were envisaged before synthesis began: firstly there was a concern 
that after cyclisation, it was possible that the growing peptide chain could fold in on itself 
meaning the unprotected amino group could become inaccessible.  This would be 
especially relevant when the lanthionine moiety was replacing the first disulfide bond as a 
further 14 amino acids needed to be added after the cyclisation step.  Secondly, there was 
the concern that the lanthionine could oxidise whilst forming the other disulfide bonds.  
To a certain extent, the latter could be avoided by minimising the amount of time the 
peptide remained in solution, as, the oxidation of lanthionine is relatively slow. 
However, the question of the inaccessible free amino group was less easily solved and 
could only be addressed once trial reactions had been carried out.  To this end, all three of 
the peptides were synthesised on a small scale.  It was decided to first synthesise 
analogues using trityl protected cysteine for all four residues.  The reasons for this were 
twofold; firstly, this would allow investigation of the effect of the lanthionine on disulfide 
regioselectivity and secondly, it makes the synthesis simpler  with fewer factors to 
control in the first instance, it was easier to locate the problem steps. 
The first experiment was thus designed to omit the orthogonal protecting group 
chemistry and focus on the insertion of the lanthionine moiety and subsequent cyclisation 
in order to form one of the rings in the inhibitory cysteine knot peptide analogues.  
However, on the first attempt at full synthesis, none of the desired masses were observed 
for any of the three peptides by crude LC-MS and the traces themselves were extremely 
complicated with multiple peaks present. 
It was decided to re-start the syntheses and to check each step individually in an attempt 
to locate the source of the problem.  After each coupling step, a small amount of resin 
was removed and cleaved in TFA before dilution in water.  The crude LC-MS traces were 
then recorded and compared with the expected masses.  It was quickly found that the 
Fmoc protected chains did not give very good mass spectra and so the protocol was 
amended to include a mini Fmoc deprotection, using 40% piperidine in DMF, prior to 
cleavage from the resin.  Unexpectedly the first problems were encountered after the 
chain length had reached just six amino acids in length (corresponding to CKKKLW or 
LanKKKLW) with multiple peaks observed in the LC-MS traces for all three peptides.  As 
the syntheses progressed, the spectra rapidly became more complicated until it was no 
longer possible to see the correct mass. 
The spectra for all the peptides were dominated by masses corresponding to smaller 
peptides.  At this point, it was not immediately obvious whether this was due to the mini-
cleavage procedure from the resin or another factor.  As mentioned previously, 
tryptophan has been found to re-attach to the resin3 during the cleavage procedure, 
which could have complicated the spectra and led to the observation of the smaller 
peptides.  Thus, it was decided to try the synthesis again from lysine-28, which would 
avoid these problems.  The results from this second attempt at synthesis are summarised 
in Figure 3.17. 
Figure 3.17: Step-wise Insertion of Amino Acids into the Peptide Sequence 
Interestingly, the same problems began to occur once the peptide reached five to six 
amino acids in length.  For peptide 214, the secondary products dominated the LC-MS 
trace after addition of arginine (218) and despite the double coupling of the amino acid, 
none of the desired product from the addition of lanthionine was observed (218, Figure 
3.17).  The addition of cysteine in place of lanthionine for peptides 215 and 216 was more 
successful but the traces were already quite messy, with many smaller fragments of 
peptide detected.  As the synthesis progressed along the sequence, the spectra became 
less and less clear and were dominated by peaks corresponding to peptides of unknown 
sequences.  The addition of the cysteine to peptide 222 could not be achieved, despite 
attempting double coupling and the synthesis was not continued any further.  Some 
product was observed when lanthionine was added to 224 but attempts to add the next 
cysteine again did not yield the desired product.  At this point all further sequence 
additions were suspended. 
In all of the traces, masses corresponding to unknown peptide sequences dominated the 
spectra.  This phenomenon had been observed in previous syntheses of shorter peptides 
but until this point had not been considered detrimental as they were only present in 
small amounts.  It was postulated that these masses could have arisen from peptide 
aggregation on resin, leading to unwanted side products. 
From these experiments, evidence suggested that peptide aggregation19 was preventing 
the peptide chain from growing in length as would be expected.  This is in direct contrast 
with the formation of the native ProTx-II peptide (22), which did contain some peptides of 
unknown masses but did not seem to impinge on the overall synthesis of the peptide 
chain.  Secondly, as predicted at the beginning, it appeared that aggregation was causing 
the peptide to fold in on itself and that the growing chain quickly made the free amino 
group inaccessible, preventing further coupling reactions from occurring.  For each 
peptide, it would appear that the addition of the large orthogonally protected lanthionine 
had a direct effect on the growth of the peptide chain; when lanthionine was added into 
the first cysteine position (cysteine 24 in ProTx-II 22) to form peptide 214, it was found 
that the peptide chain could not increase in length past six amino acids.  Similarly, when 
adding lanthionine into cysteine positions 21 and 16 (peptides 215 and 216 respectively), 
the ability to continue the peptide chain rapidly decreased.  It is postulated that the large 
size of the lanthionine moiety exacerbated the aggregation problem, potentially by 
shielding the free amino group and preventing the subsequent coupling reactions to 
increase the amino acid chain from occurring.  This would account for the observation 
that although some small peptide lengths were observed in the straight chain synthesis of 
ProTx-II (22), it was still possible to reach the end of the synthesis and form the desired 
product. 
The next step in the investigations was thus to investigate the ways to minimise the 
amount of aggregation that occurred.  In the 1990s, Hmb-protected amino acids19 were 
introduced into difficult peptide syntheses to counteract this problem by replacing the 
hydrogen atoms in the peptide backbone with the Hmb group, thus disrupting the 
hydrogen bonding and preventing aggregation (Figure 3.18).  The Hmb group also aids 
peptide synthesis by enabling acyl capture to form intermediate 228 followed by 
intramolecular acyl transfer to give the desired product (229, Figure 3.18).  Peptide 
synthesis can then continue using the standard Fmoc protected amino acids and SPPS 
protocol to build up the chain. 
Figure 3.18: Mechanism of Interaction with Hmb-protected Amino Acid 
To test the aggregation theory, the Hmb-protected amino acids were added into the 
sequence.  Literature reviews19,20 recommend adding in a protected amino acid 
approximately every six residues for maximum coupling efficiency to give the structure 
detailed in Figure 3.19. 
Figure 3.19: Structure of Peptides Incorporating Hmb-protected Amino Acid (here marked 
in red).  Each disulfide bond in turn is replaced with the lanthionine moiety to give the 
thioether linkage and the three separate structures. 
The three peptides were again synthesised incorporating the Hmb protection and 
followed by LC-MS after every step (Figure 3.20).  The Hmb protected amino acids were 
installed into the peptide chain in the same manner as the standard Fmoc amino acids, 
namely by using HBTU and DIPEA and agitating for 40 min.  Piperidine was then used to 
remove the Fmoc group as normal to allow the peptide chain to grow further. 
Figure 3.20: Synthetic Strategy for Formation of the Triple Ring Analogues Incorporating 
Hmb Protection and Addition of Lanthionine Using the Microwave Protocol 
As the synthesis progressed, it was noted that the additions required a double coupling; 
after an Fmoc deprotection, the amino acid was added along with HBTU and DIPEA and 
allowed to react for 40 minutes.  After this time, the peptide syringe was evacuated 
before repeating the coupling step with fresh activated amino acid solution.  This was 
shown to guarantee the addition of each amino acid and for this reason, this became the 
standard protocol for these experiments. 
At the end of the experiments, the crude LC-MS results showed a much reduced level of 
peptides of unknown mass and the +5 and +6 ions (m/z = 760 and 634 respectively) of the 
full length peptides for analogues (214 and 216) with the lanthionine bridge at either 
terminus were observed.  However, analogue 215 with the thioether bridge in the middle 
ring was not observed. 
The syntheses of 214 and 216 were then scaled up to produce 0.3 mg and 0.8 mg 
respectively after purification, which were then ready for biological testing.  A 
serendipitous omission of EDT from the cleavage solution was found to give the cyclised 
product upon immediate cleavage from the resin, suggesting that the partially folded 
structure aided the cyclisation of the disulfide bonds during the cleavage and side chain 
deprotection procedure. 
Upon successful production of these two analogues, attention was turned to the final 
peptide in this sequence.  As the third and fourth cysteine residues are next to each other 
in this sequence (Figure 3.16), it was decided to employ orthogonal protecting group 
chemistry to guarantee the 1  4, 3  6 connectivity.  As had been shown in the synthesis 
of ProTx-II (22), the cyclisation in water produced the desired 2  5 connectivity but it was 
difficult to ascertain if 1  4, 3  6 or 1  3, 4  6 connectivity or a mixture of the two was 
achieved.  In analogues 214 and 216, this was not such a great problem as one of the 
cysteine-15 and cysteine-16 residues was replaced by the lanthionine to give the 
thioether linkage.  However, in the case of the final analogue, this became more critical. 
Since the original protecting group investigations were carried out, a new protecting 
group was brought to market by Merck.  The S(Tmp) protected cysteine21,22 (242, Figure 
3.21) is stable to piperidine but very labile in mild thiolysis conditions, for example in the 
presence of DTT.  The problem with using combinations of the trityl, MMT and Acm 
protecting groups is that the deprotection relied on graduated acidolysis, which meant 
that there was always a risk of accidental deprotection.  Mild thiolysis is truly orthogonal 
to trityl deprotection making control of the regiochemistry more reliable. 
Figure 3.21: Structure of the S(Tmp) protected Cysteine (242) 
Once all the amino acids had been added in the peptide sequence, the S(Tmp) protecting 
group was removed on resin using DTT and cyclised using NCS.  Simultaneous cleavage 
from the resin and removal of all the protecting groups using the TFA cocktail thus 
deprotected the last pair of cysteines and allowed for formation of the final disulfide bond 
(Figure 3.22). 
Figure 3.22: Formation of Peptide 215 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) 5% DTT in 0.1M NMM in DMF (ii) 2 eq. NCS, DMF (iii) TFA, 
triisopropylsilane, water 
This procedure allowed for the production of 5 mg of the desired product after 
purification, which along with the other two triple ring analogues was submitted for 
testing against the Nav1.7 ion channel. 
In conclusion, the synthesis of the three interlocking triple ring analogues proved the 
versatility of the microwave protocol and allowed for the formation of the most 
complicated lanthionine-containing structures synthesised to date.  The protocol was 
modified slightly to include the use of the Hmb protecting group to prevent aggregation 
on resin and double coupling of each amino acid to ensure each amino acid in the 
sequence was added in correctly.  In addition, the introduction of the S(Tmp) protecting 
group allowed for the use of truly orthogonal cysteine side chain protection which 
allowed for control of the connectivity of the structure. 
3.5 Conclusions 
Research has allowed for the production of a total of 10 analogues of ProTx-II (22) as well 
as synthesis of the native peptide.  Investigations into the synthesis and cyclisation of 
ProTx-II (22) have allowed for the production of multiple milligram quantities for use in 
digestion experiments to determine connectivity and as a control for the biological testing 
against the Nav1.7 ion channel. 
A total of seven single ring analogues were synthesised to probe the SAR by finding out 
which parts of the peptide are important for binding within the active site of the ion 
channel.  By designing a novel microwave methodology for the incorporation of 
lanthionine into a peptide, three analogues containing a thioether bridge were formed.  
This methodology allowed for the synthesis of the largest known lanthionine-containing 
single ring structures made to date.  Research showed that although it was possible to 
observe the double ring analogues both with and without a lanthionine bridge, these 
proved to have inherently unstable structures which could not be subjected to 
purification by conventional means as they did not appear to be stable in water for long 
periods of time. 
Using the novel microwave-based protocol, together with the inclusion of Hmb protection 
to prevent aggregation on resin and the use of orthogonal protecting groups, three 
further analogues were synthesised which all contained one thioether bridge interlocking 
with two disulfide bridges.  These are the first known examples of such structures 
produced to date and show the versatility of the synthetic strategy. 
These 10 analogues and the native peptide were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and were 
then ready for testing on an automated patch clamp platform against the Nav1.7 ion 
channel (Chapter 5).

4 Chapter 4: Towards the Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Cystathionine for Use 
in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 
4.1 Introduction 
Thioether bridged peptides containing a lanthionine moiety have one atom less in the ring 
than their disulfide counterparts.  These analogues have the dual advantages of preventing 
ring opening by breaking the disulfide bond and of subtly changing the ring size and 
conformation.  However, for a true comparison study, it would also be interesting to replace 
one of the sulfur atoms in the disulfide bond with a carbon to give compounds with the same 
ring size, to see if this had any advantages to selectivity and potency. 
Recently, work by van der Donk et al.1 has shown that cystathionine, a thioether linked amino 
acid in which one sulfur in a traditional disulfide bond is replaced by a CH2 linkage, is a good 
replacement for a disulfide bond.  Their work focussed on the synthesis of analogues of the 
13 amino acid peptide compstatin, which contains one disulfide bond between residues 2 and 
12 and is found to have a dramatic decrease in potency in reducing conditions.  Compstatin is 
used to treat problems with the human complement system, which is a biochemical cascade 
involved in attack of the surfaces of foreign cells in conjunction with antibodies.  By replacing 
the disulfide bond with a thioether linkage obtained from insertion of a cystathionine moiety, 
it was found that the peptide maintained the binding and inhibitory properties of the parent 
peptide but was no longer susceptible to reduction.  It was also found that the effect of 
oxidation of the thioether bridge had a far less significant effect on binding and potency, 
meaning that the cystathionine substitution was of great benefit in this instance. 
Cystathionine can be thought of as a disulfide in which one sulfur atom is replaced by a 
carbon, or a lanthionine with one extra carbon in the ring structure, giving rise to two 
possible regioisomers (Figure 4.1). 
Figure 4.1: Structural Comparison of Disulfide and Thioether Linkages

41  Cystathionine Bond, Regioisomer 2 
The work by van der Donk and co-workers1 showed that the position of the thioether linker 
had a significant effect on potency; in the case of compstatin, the -cystathionine analogues 
maintained the acitivity of the disulfide parent peptide, while the -cystathionine analogues 
showed a drop in inhibition and binding ability (Figure 4.2).  As with the synthesis of 
lanthionine, in order to incorporate cystathionine into a peptide synthesis strategy, it was 
necessary to synthesise the orthogonally protected versions.  As it was not known which 
regioisomer would prove to be more potent in this instance, it was decided to synthesise 
both regioisomers. 
Figure 4.2: Orthogonally Protected Thioether Moieties for Use in Peptide Synthesis 
142  Lanthionine, (245)  -Cystathionine, Regioisomer 1, (246)  -Cystathionine, 
Regioisomer 2 
Van der Donk and co-workers synthesised both regioisomers of cystathionine using the phase 
transfer conditions pioneered by Zhu and Schmidt2 and used by Vederas3 to form 
orthogonally protected lanthionine (Figure 4.3). 
The published synthesis1 began with the formation of allyl/Alloc protected homoserine (248) 
which was then brominated using CBr4 and triphenylphosphine to give desired intermediate 
(249).  This was then reacted with doubly protected cysteine (62) to give the fully protected 
cystathionine (250).  Similarly, the other regioisomer was formed by first doubly protecting 
homoserine (247) to give (254) which was again brominated to give intermediate (255).  
Concurrently, S-trityl-L-cysteine (251) was doubly protected to give (252) before removing the 
trityl group to give the corresponding cysteine (253).  These were again reacted using the 
phase transfer conditions to give fully protected cystathionine (256).  In both cases, the tBu 
protecting group could then be removed using TFA to give the desired products 245 and 246 
for peptide synthesis.

Previous worka with the synthesis of lanthionine had shown the phase transfer conditions to 
be unreliable, not only with forming the unwanted diastereoisomers of the product but also 
a See Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2b 
with stability of the compounds in water.  For this reason, it was decided to try a new route 
which would hopefully alleviate the problems with stability and isomerisation. 
The synthetic strategy used in this work for the synthesis of both regioisomers of 
cystathionine was based on the synthesis of lanthionine; to form the cystathionine bond, an 
SN2 reaction will take place between a sulfur atom and an iodine atom, with the amino and 
carboxy residues protected by the orthogonal protecting groups employed previously.  For 
each regioisomer, it is possible to break the thioether bond in two places, giving rise to two 
possible synthetic routes for each isomer using either a protected homoserine and a 
protected cysteine derivative or a protected serine and a protected homocysteine derivative 
(Figure 4.4). 
Figure 4.4: Possible Synthetic Strategies for the Synthesis of Cystathionines (245) and (246) 
As with the synthesis of lanthionine, a series of protecting steps would be needed to give rise 
to the required intermediates.  These could then be reacted together in the presence of 
cesium carbonate to give the desired coupled products (250) and (256), which could be 
deprotected to give the desired compounds for inclusion in a peptide synthesis strategy. 
The large scale synthesis of orthogonally protected lanthionine 142 had produced large 
quantities of trityl allyl alcohol 138 and protected cystine (62), so it was decided to first try 
synthetic routes 1 and 3 to minimise the number of steps required to make the desired 
products. 
4.2 Synthesis of Regioisomer 1 (245) 
As mentioned above, large quantities of trityl allyl alcohol 138 were already available for use, 
so it was decided to first try synthetic strategy 1 to synthesise cystathionine (245).  Thus, the 
forward strategy involves the preparation of an Fmoc and tBu protected homocysteine 
residue 257, which can then be reacted with the iodinated serine 138.  It is difficult to buy 
homocysteine or homocystine commerically, however, fortuitously, Fmoc and trityl protected 
homocysteine (262) is available to buy.  The proposed forward synthetic scheme (Figure 4.5) 
uses many of the reactions used in the synthesis of orthogonally protected lanthionine and 
thus has the advantage of being a known route. 
Figure 4.5: Proposed Synthetic Strategy for Synthesis of Cystathionine (245) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) tert-butyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate, CH2Cl2 (ii) TFA, 
triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 (iii) dithiothreitol, Et3N, CH2Cl2 (iv) Cs2CO3, DMF (v) 10% TFA, 5% 
triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 (vi) allyl chloroformate, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 (vii) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
Firstly, the commercially available homocysteine (262) was tert-butyl protected using tert-
butyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate to give 263 in quantitative yield.  The trityl group was then 
removed in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid to give the homocystine 264, which could be 
cleaved to give the desired homocysteine 257.  The first three steps proceeded well and gave 
an overall yield of 39% of the double protected homocysteine ready for coupling.  
Unfortunately, using the same conditions used to form the coupled lanthionine product 140, 
that is, 4 h stirring on ice, did not yield any of the desired product (Figure 4.6, Table 4.1, Entry 
1) with the column instead yielding only starting material.  Although longer reactions were 
tried (Table 4.1, Entries 2 and 3), the predominant reaction seemed to be production of the 
aziridine 143.  The major problem appeared to be that the SN2 reaction to produce the 
coupled product 265 was very slow and that the competing reaction to form the aziridine was 
occurring much faster.  This is in agreement with earlier work carried out on the synthesis of 
lanthionine, which showed that when left in solution for too long, the iodoalanine product 
143 tends to form the aziridine.

As the coupling step did not give a good yield of the cystathionine 265, it was not possible to 
continue with this route as the yield of the final product would have been too low to allow 
multiple attempts at solid phase peptide synthesis. 
As this reaction was so unreliable, it was decided not to continue with this synthesis but to try 
the alternative route (Route 2, Figure 4.2) to see if this could improve the yield of the final 
product.  The second route has the advantage of only requiring the removal of the tert-butyl 
group after the coupling reaction, as opposed to the three steps required in route one (Figure 
4.7). 
Figure 4.7: Alternative Synthetic Strategy for Synthesis of Cystathionine (245) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF (ii) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
Using the same SN2 strategy, it was predicted that the coupled product (256) could be formed 
in the presence of cesium carbonate, with careful control of the temperature.  Using this 
reaction as a starting point, it was necessary to find a strategy to quickly and easily form the 
two doubly protected amino acids.  Work began with the production of the allyl/Alloc 
protected cysteine 253 (Figure 4.8). 
Figure 4.8: Alternative Synthetic Strategy for Synthesis of Protected Cysteine (253) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) allyl chloroformate, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 (ii) allyl bromide, NaHCO3, 
DMF (iii) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 (iv) dithiothreitol, triethylamine, CH2Cl2 
Following the work of van der Donk,1 commercially available trityl cysteine (251) was first allyl 
and Alloc protected in a clean one pot reaction to give the product (252) in good yield 
without the need for purification.  According to the paper, the desired cysteine product could 
then be formed directly by removal of the trityl group using trifluoroacetic acid.  However, in 
all cases, the dimer 266 was formed instead.  This was confirmed by using Ellmans reagent 
which did not change colour, indicating that no free SH group was present. 
Using the previously established method with dithiothreitol, it was found that the dimer 
could be cleaved easily to provide the required cysteine (253) for the coupling reaction.  
These reactions gave an overall yield of (253) of 58%, starting from the commercially 
available trityl cysteine (251).  As this procedure only required one column after the removal 
of the trityl protecting group, it was envisaged that this reaction could be scaled up quickly 
and easily.  Indeed, on a 2 g scale, the method allowed for the production of 753 mg of the 
desired product, which equates to a slightly reduced yield of 37%. 
With the synthesis of the cysteine complete, attention turned to the formation of the 
protected homoserine.  The Fmoc and tert-butyl protecting groups were installed in a one pot 
reaction to give the monomer (254).  Unfortunately, this reaction also produced some of the 
Fmoc protected lactone 268, which was difficult to remove by column chromatography and 
decreased the overall yield of the reaction.  However, careful purification resulted in a 60% 
yield of the desired double protected product (254, Figure 4.9).

Table 4.2: Summary of Attempts to Iodinate Homoserine (254) 
The first attempt using the Mitsunobu reaction conditions employed in the synthesis of 
lanthionine did not yield any of the desired product.  For the next attempt, the alcohol was 
first mesylated using mesyl chloride before reaction with sodium iodide but this again did not 
produce any of the desired product.  Finally, it was found that the iodinated product could be 
made using triphenylphosphine, imidazole and iodine, which gave the product with a yield of 
53% (Figure 4.10). 
Figure 4.10: Alternative Synthetic Strategy for Synthesis of Protected Homoserine 258

trichloroacetimidate, CH2Cl2:THF 5:1 (iii) triphenylphosphine, imidazole, iodine, CH2Cl2 
Once the synthesis of the intermediates was completed, attention turned to the coupling 
reaction to form (256).  The major problem with the previous synthetic route was the slow 
speed of the SN2 reaction in the coupling step, which could in part have been due to the large 
size of the trityl and allyl groups on the serine 138 making the iodo group less accessible to 
the bulky cysteine derivative for nucleophilic attack.  The advantages of using the iodinated 
homoserine 258 are two-fold; firstly with one extra carbon atom in the chain, it is not 
possible to form the aziridine and secondly, the extra carbon also places the iodine further 
away from the bulky protecting groups on the amino acid, which makes it more accessible for 
attack by the nucleophile and should increase the rate of reaction.  To form the equivalent 
lanthionine product 142, the reaction is left to stir for a total of 4 h.  After this point, no 
further reaction is observed and instead any excess iodinated serine 138 turns into aziridine.  
The reaction to form cystathionine (256) is noticeably more capricious (Figure 4.11).  Initial 
observations with both routes had shown that the reaction appeared to be noticeably slower 
than the equivalent lanthionine coupling reaction.  However, despite trying a number of 
different timings for the reaction and ensuring the reaction was kept cold, none of the 
desired product was observed in any case.

Table 4.3: Synthesis of Cystathionine (256) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF 
In two cases, it was thought that potentially the desired product without the Fmoc protecting 
group was observed (Table 4.3, Entries 2 and 3) but attempts to reinstate the Fmoc group 
using both Fmoc chloride and Fmoc succinimide did not yield any of the desired product.  
From the three reactions, it is not clear exactly why the reaction has not proceeded as 
expected and further investigations will be required to draw definite conclusions.  
Unfortunately it was beyond the scope of this work to investigate this any further. 
4.3 Conclusions from the Synthesis of Regioisomer 1 (245) 
This new synthetic strategy, based on the work carried out to form an orthogonally protected 
lanthionine 142, should lead to the production of cystathionine (245), which could be used in 
solid phase peptide synthesis to form another group of ProTx-II analogues.  Two routes were 
originally proposed for this synthesis and it was found that the most promising route was 
between the protected homoserine 258 and the protected cysteine (253).  Preliminary work 
has shown that both monomers can be formed quickly and easily on a medium scale and 
should be amenable to scale-up work in the future.  The coupling reaction to form the desired 
fully protected product (256) needs further work and alternatives could include using the 
bromo compound in place of the iodinated homoserine.  Work could also focus on the use of 
the phase-transfer conditions used by Vederas3 and van der Donk,1 as in this case, 
racemisation at the -centre would not be a concern. 
4.4 Synthesis of Regioisomer 2 (246) 
As large quantities of the doubly protected cystine (62) were available for use, the first 
synthesis attempted was that shown in route 3 (Figure 4.4).  In order to carry out the 
coupling step, it was first necessary to form the allyl/Alloc protected homoserine (248), which 
could then be iodinated and coupled to the doubly protected cystine (62) to produce 
cystathionine (250).  As with route 2, the advantage of this route is that after the coupling 
reaction, only one reaction is required to make the final product ready for peptide synthesis.  
In the synthesis of lanthionine, it was not possible to use the equivalent iodinated allyl/Alloc 
protected serine, as the iodine could eliminate leaving the dehydroalanine, which in turn led 
to racemisation at the stereocentre and a mixture of diastereomers was produced.  The 
advantage of using the homoserine equivalent 259 is that if elimination occurs, racemisation 
does not occur at the -centre as the iodine atom is one further carbon atom away.  This 
removes the need for the trityl deprotection and re-protection steps, which shortens the 
synthesis and makes it more efficient.  The proposed synthesis (Figure 4.12) thus began with 
the allyl/Alloc protection of homoserine (247), to give (248).  It was envisaged that this could 
then be iodinated using the Mitsunobu conditions employed in the synthesis of the 
iodoalanine 139, before coupling in the presence of cesium carbonate and removal of the 
tert-butyl protecting group gave the desired product. 
Figure 4.12: Proposed Synthetic Strategy for Synthesis of Cystathionine (246) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) allyl chloroformate, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 (ii) allyl bromide, NaHCO3, 
CH2Cl2 (iii) triphenylphosphine, methyl iodide, DEAD, CH2Cl2 (iv) Cs2CO3, DMF (v) TFA, 
triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
According to the work published by van der Donk and coworkers1, the desired homoserine 
(248) could be easily formed in a one pot reaction starting from the commercially available 
homoserine (247) by first Alloc protecting with allyl chloroformate and then protecting the 
carboxylic acid moiety with allyl bromide (Table 4.4, Entry 1).  Unfortunately, it was found 
that the majority product formed was always the Alloc protected lactone 270.  This product 
could not be iodinated directly to make the desired 259, so the double protection strategy 
was researched in more detail.  It was found that the reaction to form Alloc homoserine 269 
proceeded cleanly to give the desired product without need for further purification.  
However, upon addition of allyl bromide, lactonization began to occur.  This is unsurprising, 
as the 5-exo-trig reaction for cyclisation is favoured by Baldwins rules4,5 as the OAllyl moiety 
can act as a good leaving group.  Thus, work focussed on the allyl protection reaction to see if 
lactonization could be circumvented to give the desired product (248, Figure 4.13).

Table 4.4: Attempts to Synthesise allyl/Alloc Homoserine (248) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) allyl chloroformate, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 (ii) see table 
Firstly, it was decided to try using the conditions to make the allyl/Alloc serine 152 discussed 
in Chapter 2,6 using allyl alcohol and Dean-Stark apparatus in the presence of para-toluene 
sulfonic acid (Table 4.4, Entry 2).  These conditions promoted the formation of the lactone 
and so this reaction was not pursued any further.  It was then decided to see if the 
lactonization process could be reversed by leaving the allylation for longer and by adding an 
additional portion of allyl bromide (Table 4.4, Entries 3 and 4) but this again did not lead to 
any of the desired product.  The next step was to try a shorter reaction time at a reduced 
temperature (Table 4.4, Entry 5).  This finally saw production of the desired homoserine 
product (248) in a 1:1 ratio with the unwanted lactone 270 which was difficult to remove via 
column chromatography.  Lastly, attention turned to the work-up procedure: it was feared 
that the use of a basic aqueous work-up could enhance the lactonization process, so a small 
scale reaction was carried out where the reaction was simply concentrated in vacuo before 
re-dissolving in chloroform and washing once with water to remove the bicarbonate salt, 
before purification via column chromatography (Table 4.4, Entry 6).  This also had some 
success leading to isolation of a mixture containing a higher proportion of the desired 
homoserine (248) but was still difficult to purify.  Although a limited amount of the desired 
product was accessible, this was not enough to carry through to produce large quantities of 
the cystathionine end product. 
Given that the products were so difficult to separate, research next turned to attempts to re-
open the lactone to see if the desired product could be isolated in a greater yield.  Following 
this strategy, attempts to re-open the lactone under both acidic and basic conditions were 
attempted with equally disappointing outcomes (Figure 4.14).

Dissolving in allyl alcohol and adding concentrated HCl showed no reaction (Table 4.5, Entry 
1).  Ozinskas and Rosenthal7 claim that the lactone can be opened in base using 1.2 
equivalents of allyl bromide to give the desired homoserine (248).  Unfortunately, the 
reaction was carried out twice for both 8 and 21 h but no reaction was observed in either 
case (Table 4.5, Entries 2 and 3). 
As the products were so difficult to separate, it was decided to try iodinating the mixture of 
lactone and homoserine to get the desired iodinated compound 259.  It was found that the 
Mitsunobu conditions employed previously did not work in this instance but that the product 
could be formed if the alcohol was first mesylated and then reacted with iodine.  This allowed 
for the production of 60 mg of 259, which was found to be very unstable in solution and to 
purification by column chromatography, leading to rapid decomposition.  The small amount 
isolated was reacted with the doubly protected cysteine (62) to give the second regioisomer 
of cystathionine (250), in reasonable yield.  However, not enough of the product was made to 
carry out the final deprotection step and obtain a meaningful amount of cystathionine (246) 
for peptide synthesis (Figure 4.15). 
Figure 4.15: Attempted Synthesis of Cystathionine (246) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF (ii) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
Given the major difficulties with lactonization, it became clear that this route was not going 
to be suitable for large scale work and so attention turned to route 4 to see if this could 
produce the desired cystathionine (246) in better yield. 
This route is in fact the most cumbersome of the four as homocysteine and homocystine are 
not available to buy commercially.  Instead, the route had to begin with the Fmoc/Trt 
protected homocysteine (262) used in the synthesis of the other regioisomer of cystathionine 
(245).  To begin, it was decided to try removing the Fmoc group and then to do a one pot 
allyl/Alloc protection to form 274.  The Fmoc deprotection proceeded well but unfortunately 
gave the product as a barely soluble white solid.  The next reaction to Alloc protect the 
homocysteine did not proceed, probably due to the lack of solubility (Figure 4.16). 
Figure 4.16: Attempts to Synthesise allyl/Alloc Protected Homocysteine 274 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) piperdine, DMF (ii) allyl chloroformate, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 
As an alternative, it was decided to first allyl protect the homocysteine before removing the 
Fmoc group to see if this would improve the solubility problems.  Pleasingly, this reaction 
proceeded well and the Fmoc/allyl protected homocysteine 273 was produced in 42% yield.  
From here, the Fmoc group was removed using piperidine in DMF before addition of the Alloc 
group using allyl chloroformate to produce 274 in good yield.  The trityl group was then left 
as the corresponding dimer until the desired homocysteine 261 was required in the coupling 
step.  Overall, this route required 4 steps and had an overall yield of 8% (Figure 4.17). 
Figure 4.17: Synthesis of Homocysteine 275 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) allyl bromide, methanol, Cs2CO3, DMF (ii) 40% piperdine in DMF 
(iii) allyl chloroformate, acetonitrile, Na2CO3, CH2Cl2 (iv) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
With this synthesis complete, attention turned to the formation of Fmoc/tBu protected serine 
(258), which it was envisaged would then be iodinated before coupling with the allyl/Alloc 
homocysteine 261 to form the desired regioisomer of cystathionine (250, Figure 4.18). 
Figure 4.18: Alternative Strategy for the Synthesis of Cystathionine (246) 
Reagents and Conditions: (i) Cs2CO3, DMF (ii) TFA, triethylsilane, CH2Cl2 
Unfortunately, the iodination of the doubly protected serine 276 proved elusive; both the 
Mitsunobu conditions used to form trityl allyl iodoalanine 139 and the attempt to mesylate 
the alcohol, followed by reaction with sodium iodide used to form the iodinated allyl/Alloc 
homoserine 248 did not yield any of the desired product. 
Previous work carried out by others within the group showed that when the iodination of this 
serine was successful,8 the subsequent coupling reaction did not proceed as expected but 
lead to a mixture of diastereoisomers of the product.  This occurred as some of the serine 
formed the unwanted dehydroalanine side product, which could then undergo a Michael 
addition to form either diastereoisomer of the product (Figure 4.19). 
Figure 4.19: Formation of Dehydroalanine (278) and the Subsequent Coupling Reaction8 
When the nitrogen atom is attached to an electron withdrawing group such as Fmoc or Cbz, 
the acidity of the -proton increases and is easily abstracted, leading to elimination of the 
iodine and formation of the double bond in (278). 
In the synthesis of lanthionine, this is circumvented by the use of the trityl protected serine 
139,8 which does not lead to diastereoisomers as dehydroalanine formation is not promoted.  
However, the electron donating group does favour elimination of iodine to form the 
corresponding aziridine, and indeed, in all cases some aziridine formation was observed.  It 
was beyond the scope of the current work to investigate this further but this could be a 
potential avenue for future work. 
4.5 Conclusions from the Synthesis of Regioisomer 2 (246) 
The synthesis of the second regioisomer of cystathionine proved to be as elusive as the first, 
due to the instability of the iodinated homoserine and the great propensity for lactonization.  
Although an alternative route via the protected homocysteine 261 and protected serine 260 
analogues was investigated, it was not possible to form any of the desired product using this 
method.  Although beyond the scope of this piece of work, future work would need to focus 
on either the synthesis of the allyl/Alloc homoserine (248) or the synthesis of a trityl serine 
derivative for reaction with the allyl/Alloc homocysteine 261.  Preliminary investigations 
using the homoserine pathway have shown it is possible to make a combination of the 
lactone 270 and the desired product and further work would surely improve upon this.  The 
synthesis attempts allowed for the production of 110 mg of the desired product (250), 
showing the coupling conditions work, although more work will be required.  The iodinated 
homoserine product 259 was found to be particularly unstable and it may be that the bromo 
derivative may be better suited to large scale production of cystathionine.  Future work 
should focus on both this and ways to prevent lactonization. 
4.6 Conclusions 
Preliminary investigations into the synthesis of both regioisomers of the orthogonally 
protected cystathionines (245) and (246), have shown that the syntheses will require further 
optimisation before any large scale work can be carried out.  However, work thus far has 
shown that it is possible to form the required monomers in the synthesis of regioisomer (245) 
in high yield on reasonably large scale.  To finish the synthesis, a significant amount of work 
on the coupling reaction is required but with greater amounts of the monomers available, the 
final two steps should be easily achieved.  Possible routes to investigate for the coupling 
reaction include using the bromo-derivative with the cesium carbonate coupling conditions or 
using the phase-transfer conditions used in the van der Donk group.  With regards to the 
second regioisomer (246), more work needs to be done to prevent lactonization of the 
allyl/Alloc homoserine (246).  With that complete and the work on the coupling reaction to 
form the other regioisomer, it should again prove easy to form the final product.

5. Chapter 5: Biological and in silico Evaluation of the Analogues of ProTx-II 
ProTx-II (22) was previously shown to have good inhibitory effects of the Nav1.7 ion channel 
with an IC50 value of 0.3 nM in vitro.1  However, comparatively poorer results were observed 
in vivo, suggesting the peptide was too large to cross the blood-nerve barrier.  A number of 
analogues of ProTx-II were synthesised (see Chapter 3).  The first set were truncated to probe 
the structure-activity relationship of ProTx-II by investigating which parts of the peptide were 
important for binding to the channel and the second set of analogues were designed to be 
more resistant to enzymatic degradation in vivo through replacement of a disulfide bond with 
a thioether linkage.  Having synthesised a set of 10 analogues, along with the native peptide, 
the next step was to investigate the effects of these analogues on the Nav1.7 ion channel.  
This work consisted of two separate experimental approaches; in the first, evaluation of the 
structures of the compounds was carried out using homology modelling in silico.  In the 
second line of investigation, the biological effect on the ion channel was assessed using an 
automated patch clamp assay.  The patch clamp experiments were carried out in 
collaboration with two commercial companies, Essen Bioscience from Welwyn Garden City, 
UK and BSys from Witterswil, Switzerland. 
5.1 In Silico Analysis of Structures 
As mentioned in the introduction (Section 1.5) prior to release of the structure of ProTx-II by 
Park et al. in 2014,2 the only structural information available came from homology modelling 
carried out by Smith and co-workers.3  In their work, the initial model was based on the 
structure of HpTx-II, another ICK peptide containing the same secondary structure as ProTx-II.  
However, the primary sequences differed significantly, with the peptides only sharing 50% 
similaritya (Figure 1.20).  Ideally, it would be possible to evaluate the structures of the 
analogues of ProTx-II using the coordinates from the solution phase NMR published by Park 
and co-workers.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, it was not possible to obtain this 
information as it was not uploaded to the Protein Data Bank and attempts to contact the 
group directly proved unsuccessful. 
Given the large discrepancy in structure between HpTx-II and ProTx-II, it was decided to 
investigate the structure of ProTx-II using a different structure as the basis for molecular 
modelling.  In 2004, the solution phase NMR structure of PaTx-I was released4 which shares 
83% identitya with ProTx-II and is also an ICK peptide (Figure 5.1).  This peptide was first 
isolated from the Phrixotrichus auratus spider and is 29 amino acids in length.  Although the 
a as calculated by the clustal W2 software available at www.ebi.ac.uk 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
C-terminii of the peptides are non-homologous, only two amino acids differ between the two 
peptides within the core structure, making PaTx-I the ideal candidate for the basic structure 
for homology modelling. 
Figure 5.1: Comparison of PaTx-I (left) and ProTx-II (right) Structure Generated by MOE 
Software 
To create the model of ProTx-II, the coordinates of PaTx-I were first uploaded to the 
Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software before the amino acids were altered in 
silico to give the correct structure for ProTx-II.  The Amber94 forcefield and Born solvation 
conditions were then applied and a quick molecular dynamics calculation performed to give 
the structure above.  The diagram shows that PaTx-I and ProTx-II are both predicted to be 
tightly bound molecules with a well-defined backbone structure and small area of -sheet 
ordering within each of the peptides (indicated by the arrows). 
The predicted structure created by the MOE software agrees closely with the previously 
published model by Park et al. (Figure 5.2).  The only difference is that the software predicts a 
slightly more ordered structure with an extended -sheet region around Cys-25 with respect 
to that found in the solution NMR structure, with an additional two areas of ordering 
predicted around the disulfide bond connecting Cys-9 to Cys-25.

Park and co-workers found that the C-terminal motif (KKKLW) was structurally undefined and 
found to form a flexible tail region.  As the flexible tail region is also observed in the C-
terminal motif of PaTx-I (KKII), it can be assumed that the tail region in the structure 
generated by the MOE software also shows a high degree of flexibility. 
5.1.1 Modelling of the Single Ring Analogues of ProTx-II 
Having generated the structure of the parent peptide, the next step was to model the three 
disulfide single ring analogues using the same calculations (Figures 5.3  5.5).  To model the 
single ring analogues, the residues not present in the parent peptide were removed from the 
sequence and the cysteines no longer involved in disulfide bond formation were altered to 
methionine, to reflect the structures synthesised in the laboratory.  To model the lanthionine 
bond, the equivalent structure containing the disulfide bond was first generated.  One sulfur 
atom was then removed from the structure and the structure was re-minimised to generate 
an approximation of the lanthionine bond.  An energy minimising calculation was then 
performed for each of the peptides to generate the structures shown below. 
Figure 5.3: Structure of C-terminal Single Ring (192) and Location of the Residues Within 
ProTx-II (22, purple) 
Figure 5.4: Structure of Middle Single Ring (193) and Location of the Residues Within ProTx-II 
(22, green) 
Figure 5.5: Structure of N-terminal Single Ring (194) and Location of the Residues Within 
ProTx-II (22, orange) 
The most striking aspect from the three predicted structures is that the single ring analogues 
are far less tightly held together than each of the equivalent rings in the parent structure.  
This is unsurprising as the ICK structure is very tightly bound thanks to the presence of three 
interlocking disulfide bridges; if two of these bridges are removed then the constraint on the 
system will be greatly reduced leading to a more open and flexible structure. 
As well as being more flexible, the single ring structures show a general decrease in 
organisation, with no predicted secondary structure (Figures 5.6  5.8).  In the case of the 
single ring structures based on the disulfide ring closest to the C-terminal (Figure 5.6), the -
sheet present predicted in ProTx-II around Cys-25 is no longer present in the single ring 
structures containing either a lanthionine or disulfide bond. 
The decrease in size when changing from the disulfide to the lanthionine bond is reflected in 
the slight contraction observed in the overall structure (compare Figure 5.6, A to B and C to 
D).  This is particularly noticeable when the C-terminal KKLW motif is removed (C and D, 
Figure 5.6) as the lanthionine containing analogue (D) shows a more disordered overall 
structure than the disulfide counterpart (C). 
Figure 5.6: Comparison of the Structures of the C-Terminal Single Ring 
A  C-terminal Disulfide Single Ring with KKLW motif (192) B  C-terminal Lanthionine Single 
Ring with KKLW motif (206) C  C-terminal Disulfide Single Ring without KKLW motif (191) D  
C-terminal Lanthionine Single Ring without KKLW motif (205) 
When modelling the single ring analogues based on the middle ring of ProTx-II (193 and 207), 
it became obvious that on its own, this part of the molecule is far less well ordered than in 
the parent peptide (Figure 5.7).  This supports the hypothesis that the system requires all 
three disulfide bonds in order to form the well-defined structure characterised by Park and 
co-workers, and also observed in the structure of PaTx-I. 
Figure 5.7: Comparison of the Structures of the Middle Single Ring 
A  Middle Ring with Disulfide Bond (193) B  Middle Ring with Lanthionine Bond (207) 
Conversely, the single ring structure based on the N-terminal disulfide bond (194 and 208) 
appears to show a more complex structure than that observed in the solution phase NMR.  
The calculations predict that while the end of the ring containing either a lanthionine or 
disulfide bond is still fairly undefined, the opposite side is far more twisted than in the parent 
peptide.

A  N-terminal Disulfide Single Ring (194) B  N-terminal Lanthionine Single Ring (208) 
5.1.2 Modelling of the Double Ring Analogues of ProTx-II 
In total, six double ring analogues were modelled containing either two disulfide bonds or 
one lanthionine and one disulfide bridge (Figures 5.9  5.11).  The structures were generated 
using the same method as described in section 5.1.1. 
Figure 5.9: Structure of C-Terminal Double Ring (195) and Location of the Residues Within 
ProTx-II (22) 
Figure 5.10: Structure of N-Terminal Double Ring (196) and Location of the Residues Within 
ProTx-II (22) 
As with the single ring analogues, the double ring analogues exhibit a more flexible structure 
than the parent peptide.  The C-terminal double ring analogues (Figure 5.9) are quite differing 
structures depending on whether or not a lanthionine bridge is present in the structure.  The 
structures containing the KKLW tail motif (Structures A, C, and E, Figure 5.11) all maintain the 
-sheet motif observed in the parent structure.  However, without the final motif present, 
the structures appear to be less ordered (Structures B, D and F, Figure 5.11) possibly due to a 
loss of interaction between the disordered tail motif and residues within the core of the 
peptide.  The replacement of the C-terminal disulfide bond with the lanthionine thioether 
bridge does not appear to cause any major structural difference to the peptide (A against C 
and B against D, Figure 5.11).  However, the replacement of the middle disulfide bond with a 
thioether linkage has major structural implications (Structures E and F, Figure 5.11). 
Figure 5.11: Structure of C-Terminal Double Ring Analogues 
A  Double Disulfide Bond with KKLW motif (195) B  Double Disulfide Bond without KKLW 
motif (281) C  C-terminal Lanthionine with KKLW motif (282) D  C-terminal Lanthionine 
without KKLW motif (210) E  Middle Ring Lanthionine with KKLW motif (283) F  Middle Ring 
Lanthionine without KKLW motif (211) 
With the tail motif intact (Structure E, Figure 5.11) some -sheet ordering is maintained.  
However, these sections are in fact in different positions to those observed in either the 
parent peptide or the other four double ring analogues; instead of the peptide exhibiting 
ordering around Cys-25, the folding appears to be around Cys-9 and Cys-21, or rather directly 
around the thioether linkage which forms the middle ring of the peptide. 
Aside from this small defined structure however, the peptide does not show any strongly 
defined areas of structure and neither resembles the structures exhibited by the other four 
analogues, nor resembles the solution phase structure of the parent peptide (Figure 5.12). 
Figure 5.12: Comparison of Solution Phase NMR of ProTx-II (22, left) Against Predicted 
Structure for C-Terminal Double Ring Analogue with the Middle Ring Containing the Thioether 
Bridge (211)5 
As with the C-terminal double ring analogues, replacement of the N-terminal disulfide with a 
lanthionine bridge (Structure D, Figure 5.13) does not appear to alter the structure too 
dramatically from either the double disulfide analogue (Structure B, Figure 5.13) or the 
parent peptide (Structure A, Figure 5.13).  However, replacement of the middle ring again 
shows a dramatic difference in structure, with almost complete loss of the loops defined in 
the other three structures.  From these predicted structures, it is clear that the middle 
disulfide bond contains a key interaction which holds the peptide together and that even a 
slight change in size of this ring causes a dramatic change in the conformation of the 
truncated peptides. 
Figure 5.13: Structure of the N-Terminal Double Ring Analogues5 
A  Solution Phase NMR Structure of ProTx-II B  Double Disulfide Analogue (196) C  Middle 
Ring with Lanthionine Replacement (212) D  N-Terminal Lanthionine Replacement (213) 
Although the difference in structure when the middle disulfide ring is replaced with 
lanthionine shows the most significant departure from the parent structure, none of the C-
terminal double ring structures show the same conformation as the original structure.  This is 
likely to be due to the third disulfide bond providing an extra level of constraint to the 
structure and thus preventing the peptide from forming certain conformations.  Given that 
the predicted structures are quite different from the parent peptide, this could explain why it 
was not possible to isolate the double ring analogues during synthesis and does suggest that 
without the third disulfide bond these peptides are inherently unstable. 
However, with the exception of the N-terminal analogue where the middle ring is replaced by 
a lanthionine, the other two N-terminal double ring structures do closely resemble the parent 
structure.  From the computer modelling, it could therefore be concluded that it should be 
possible to form both the double disulfide analogue and the analogue where the N-terminal 
disulfide is replaced with a lanthionine moiety (Structures B and D, Figure 5.13).  However, 
direct experimental evidence showed that the N-terminal double ring analogues were in fact 
more difficult to isolate than the C-terminal counterparts; whereas traces of the N-terminal 
analogues were observed on just one occasion each, the C-terminal analogues were all 
observed multiple times, although could still never be isolated. 
These observations support work published by the King group, which showed that the N-
terminal disulfide bond is not essential to formation of the basic ICK fold and does not 
contribute to the hydrophobic core.6  This finding corroborated work by Heitz et al., who 
showed that removal of the N-terminal disulfide bond did not affect the thermal stability or 
tertiary structure of the peptidic trypsin inhibitor EETI II.7,8  Thus, it is unsurprising that the 
modelling also predicts that the truncated analogues will show a similar structure to the 
original peptide.  However, structural similarity to the original peptide does not necessarily 
equate with ease of synthesis, as the practical results showed. 
5.1.3 Modelling of the Triple Ring Analogues of ProTx-II 
The last analogues to be modelled were the triple ring analogues in which each disulfide bond 
in turn was replaced with a thioether linkage (Figures 5.14  5.17). 
Figure 5.14: Structure of Triple Ring Analogue with C-Terminal Lanthionine Bridge (214) 
Figure 5.15: Structure of Triple Ring Analogue with Middle Lanthionine Bridge (215) 
Figure 5.16: Structure of Triple Ring Analogue with N-Terminal Lanthionine Bridge (216) 
Figure 5.17: Comparison of the Triple Ring Structures with the Solution Phase NMR Structure5 
A  Solution Phase NMR of ProTx-II (22) B  Triple Ring Analogue with C-Terminal Lanthionine 
(214) C  Triple Ring Analogue with Middle Ring Lanthionine (215) D  Triple Ring Analogue 
with N-Terminal Lanthionine (216) 
As predicted, the replacement of a disulfide bond with a thioether linkage in the triple ring 
analogues does not cause a great change in the overall structure of the peptides.  When the 
lanthionine bridge replaces either the middle or C-terminal disulfide bonds, the peptide 
maintains the structure of the parent peptide with only slight changes in the backbone 
structure.  It is interesting to note that when all three disulfide bonds are present, the effect 
of the replacement of the middle disulfide bond by lanthionine appears to be negated, 
corroborating the argument that all three disulfide bonds are required to give the structure 
stability.  Interestingly, the calculations predict an increase in the ordering of the system 
when the N-terminal disulfide is replaced by lanthionine, with two extra -sheet areas 
predicted around Met-19 (Structure D, Figure 5.17).  The second more ordered region is 
located in the KKLW C-terminal motif.  The work by Park et al. shows that the C-terminus is 
flexible with no defined conformation, so although it is predicted to have a more defined 
structure in this calculation, it is likely that it adopts a number of different conformations in 
solution.  However, it is entirely possible that by constraining the N-terminal ring slightly, 
more order is forced upon the core of the peptide giving the -sheet conformation around 
Met-19. 
5.1.4 Conclusions from the Modelling Calculations 
As it was not possible to obtain the co-ordinates for the recently published solution NMR 
structure of ProTx-II, the structure of ProTx-II was first generated from the solution NMR 
structure of PaTx-I, a peptide showing a high degree of similarity to ProTx-II.  Using the 
homology modelling software from MOE, it was possible to build a structure which was 
shown to be very close to that published by Park and co-workers, which gave a good degree 
of confidence in the calculations.  Using this structure, a total of 20 analogues of ProTx-II 
were generated and evaluated. 
A total of eight analogues of the single ring structures were produced, which all showed 
different structures from that adopted by the parent peptide.  This was unsurprising as it was 
predicted that all three disulfide bonds were required to form the defined tightly bound core 
of the peptide and so once two of these three constraints were removed, the structure was 
unlikely to display such a great degree of ordering.  Given the vastly differing structures, it is 
unlikely that any of these single ring structures will display activity on their own. 
Similarly, the six analogues generated from the C-terminal double ring structure did not show 
structural similarity to the parent peptide and were also unlikely to show any activity in vitro.  
Conversely, of the three analogues of the N-terminal double ring which were modelled, both 
the analogues containing the double disulfide bond and the N-terminal lanthionine bond did 
show structural similarity to the parent peptide.  This observation is in line with work 
published by other groups, who showed that changing the N-terminal ring did not have any 
great structural effect on the peptide.6, 7, 8  However, as it was not possible to synthesise and 
isolate these analogues, it will not be possible to find out if these structures show any 
biological activity. 
Finally, as predicted, all three of the triple ring analogues closely resemble the structure of 
the parent peptide.  This is unsurprising as replacing a disulfide bond with a lanthionine 
bridge results in only a mild change in the constraint on each of the rings; as the structure is 
already highly constrained, this small difference appears to have little effect on the overall 
structure of the peptides and, as such, all three analogues are predicted to have similar levels 
of activity in vitro. 
5.2 An Introduction to Patch Clamping 
Modelling the structure of each of the compounds can give confidence in the predictions on 
the activity of the compounds.  However, in order to assess whether a lanthionine bridge 
could truly provide an alternative to a disulfide bond in a peptide, the compounds needed to 
be tested in a biological system, albeit in vitro.  For this work, it was decided to test the 
compounds against the Nav1.7 ion channel using an automated patch clamp assay.  This assay 
uses Nav1.7 ion channels generated in stably transfected cells, isolated from the membrane 
using a patch clamp and then changes in current and voltage across the channel are recorded 
to give a measure of activity.  In a stably transfected cell, the DNA of the receptor becomes 
encoded in the genome of the host cell.  Although the DNA was not originally endogenous to 
the host cell, upon replication, this new DNA is also replicated.  For this work, the gene for 
the Nav1.7 ion channel was cloned and functionally expressed in either Human Embryonic 
Kidney (HEK) or Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.  The cell lines were tested for expression 
and correct membrane integration of the Nav1.7 ion channel.

The patch clamping technique was pioneered by Neher and Sakmann9 in the 1970s as a novel 
method of conductance measurement over a cell membrane, which has allowed for the 
evaluation of individual ion channels. 
As discussed in Chapter 1, an action potential occurs as a result of the movement of ions 
across the cell membrane.  There are more positive ions outside of a cell and the charge 
imbalance gives rise to an electric potential across the membrane potential typically in the 
range of  50 to  80 mV.10  Sodium ion channels are involved in the propagation of a nerve 
impulse along the axon (Section 1.2 and Figure 5.18).  In unmyelinated axons, action 
potentials move as a cascade of voltage-gated ion channels open, resulting in the passive 
spread of voltage change along the axon (Figure 5.19). 
Figure 5.18: Unmyelinated vs Myelinated Neurons11 
When an action potential occurs at the axon hillock, positive charges (both Na+ and K+) move 
into the cell creating a change in the local charge and rapid depolarisation.  Once this has 
occurred, the cell needs time to recover before it can signal again (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).  This 
is known as the refractory period and ensures that the action potential always moves in the 
forward direction.  As a general rule, a larger diameter axon has a faster propagation rate due 
to the decreased resistance to current flow within the neuron. 
Figure 5.19: Propagation of the Nerve Impulse in an Unmyelinated Neuron11 
Myelinated axons propagate nerve impulses faster.  This is due to the myelin providing high 
resistance to ion flow, preventing the movement of ions.  This resistance is only absent at the 
points where no myelin covers the neuron at gaps known as Nodes of Ranvier, which contain 
a high concentration of both Nav and Kv channels.  In the case of myelinated axons, the action 
potential jumps from one node to the next.  This is known as saltatory conduction and results 
in an increased speed of propagation (Figure 5.20). 
Figure 5.20: Propagation of the Nerve Impulse in a Myelinated Neuron11 
Prior to the work by Neher and Sakmann, it was necessary to base all calculations on 
conductance on macroscopic variations with a system,9,12,13 which did not give such a high 
degree of accuracy. 
Patch clamp experiments work by keeping either the voltage or current constant and then 
measuring the changes in the other variable.  This work is concerned with voltage clamp 
experiments in which the membrane potential is controlled and the current measured 
directly.  To do this, the measured potential is compared with a holding potential set by the 
experimenter through an electronic feedback system.  Deviation from the holding potential is 
corrected by a compensatory current injection, which corresponds to the ionic current over 
the membrane at that moment.  The current and voltage are measured using a single 
electrode voltage clamp within a micropipette, which switches quickly between injecting 
current and measuring potential difference (Figure 5.21). 
Figure 5.21: Schematic Diagram of a Patch Clamp Experiment14 
The work in this thesis uses whole cell patch clamping.  In this scenario, the patch of 
membrane under the pipette tip is ruptured allowing the pipette solution and electrode to 
make direct contact with the cytoplasm.  The pipette tip is wide enough to permit washout 
of the cytoplasm, which is then replaced by the pipette-filling solution.  To maintain 
physiological situation within the cell, the pipette is filled with an ionic solution resembling 
the cytoplasm as closely as possible.  In this case, the following composition was used (Table 
5.1): 
Compound Amount 
Cesium Fluoride 135 mM 
Sodium Chloride 10 mM 
HEPES 10 mM (pH = 7.3) 
EGTA 5 mM

5.2.2 Automated Patch Clamping 
Although manual patch clamping gives accurate readings, it is also time consuming as 
experiments can only be carried out one at a time.  However, it is possible to use an 
automated system in which multiple readings can be taken simultaneously.  The principle is 
the same as that employed for manual whole cell patch clamping but the cells are put into 
microtitre plates with multiple cells present in each well.  By using continuous flow and 
recording, more data points can be collected in a shorter time frame, which allows for faster 
production of data. 
All the patch clamping results presented in this chapter come from automated patch clamp 
experiments carried out by Essen Bioscience and BSys. 
5.3 Preliminary Patch Clamping Results 
In collaboration with both Essen Bioscience and BSys, the following compounds were tested 
(Table 5.2).  All compounds were tested using either the hNav1.7-HEK cell IonWorks 
Population Patch Clamp Assay, as designed by Essen Bioscience or the Sophion QPatch 
Patch Clamp Assay as designed by BSys.  The compounds tested at Essen Bioscience were 
tested at 11 different points to make an IC50 curve using threefold dilution from 1 M  
0.000001 M in triplicate, using tetracaine as the control molecule.  The samples were 
allowed to incubate for 5  7 min before testing occurred and were tested in the presence of 
0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin to prevent the samples adhering to the side of the microtitre 
plate.  The percentage inhibition between the 1st and 20th pulses was then analysed and 
plotted on a graph. 
Unfortunately, although the lidocaine performed as expected in these experiments, no 
activity was recorded with any of the truncated or full size analogues of ProTx-II (Table 5.2).  
In addition, the ProTx-II made in the laboratory did not show any activity and neither did 
commercially sourced ProTx-II from either Sigma Aldrich or Tocris.

The purity of all the compounds was checked by both analytical HPLC and LC-MS but the 
compounds were found to be unchanged.  It was therefore initially concluded that there was 
a problem with the testing platform at Essen.  Although the company spent some time 
investigating possible problems such as the electrics within the system and transfection 
errors, it was not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the cause of failure.  
Unfortunately, the same problem was found when the samples were sent to BSys in 
Switzerland with no activity recorded for either the ProTx-II or the single ring analogues.

5.4 Further Results from BSys 
As no activity was recorded for both the compounds synthesised in-house and the parent 
peptide made by two separate companies, it was decided to investigate ProTx-II (22) activity 
further.  A series of samples both synthesised in-house and purchased from a variety of 
commercial sources were then tested in an attempt to locate the source of the problem 
(Table 5.3). 
Entry Source of ProTx-II Result 
1 Made in-house, cyclised No Activity 
2 Sigma Aldrich No Activity 
3 Tocris No Activity 
4 Made in-house, uncyclised No Activity 
5 Smartox 97.6% drop in activity 
Table 5.3: Summary of Testing Results from BSys 
As the table shows, no activity was observed for either the Sigma Aldrich or the Tocris 
samples of ProTx-II (Table 5.3, Entries 2 and 3).  Given that activity has been reported 
multiple times in the literature1,2 and that Essen Bioscience has also previously seen activity 
with ProTx-II in their assay,15 it was clear that there were discrepancies with either the 
methods used in the testing or the peptides themselves.  To ensure that the problem had not 
occurred due to disulfide bond opening in previous experiments, it was next decided to test 
an uncyclised sample of the peptide.  As expected, this form of the peptide did not show any 
activity (Table 5.3, Entry 4).  However, upon testing a final sample of ProTx-II obtained from 
Smartox, a peptide company based in France, the expected activity was observed. 
However, having ascertained that the procedure for carrying out the testing worked, it was 
clear that the nature of the peptide was the cause of the problem.  This could be as a result of 
one of several factors: 
 Did ProTx-II show activity in the first place or was it an, as yet unidentified, side 
product causing the activity? 
 Do all of the peptides have the same molecular weight or do they have different 
primary structures? 
 Is the peptide fully cyclised or has only partial cyclisation occurred in the Smartox 
peptide?  Has partial cyclisation led to the observed activity? 
 If the peptide is fully cyclised, do the peptides all have the same disulfide bond 
connectivity? 
The first question, although the most concerning, is also the least likely option as activity has 
been reported in the literature many times since the initial isolation of the peptide.16,1,2,15  
However, the next three could only be determined by further analysis of the structure of 
ProTx-II. 
5.5 Analysis of the Structure of ProTx-II 
The data in Table 5.3 shows there is clearly a difference between the commercially available 
sources of ProTx-II.  To investigate the possibility of differences in structure, the peptides 
were first submitted for LC-MS analysis. 
As well as testing the in-house peptide against samples from both Sigma Aldrich and Smartox, 
a second in-house sample of the peptide was prepared using the cyclisation conditions as 
detailed by Park et al.2  The cyclisation procedure detailed in their work was a more thorough 
version of that used by Middleton et al.16 for the initial studies in to the structure of the 
peptide (Chapter 3).  In this procedure, GSH (0.15 mM) and GSSG (0.3 mM) were added to a 
solution of 2 M Urea and 0.1 M Tris-HCl in water.  The pH was adjusted to 8 using saturated 
aqueous NaHCO3 before addition of the crude linear peptide (0.1 mg/mL).  The reaction was 
left to stir for 24 h before the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 3 and the crude 
product was analysed by analytical HPLC.  It is curious to note that although the cyclisation 
worked when using crude linear peptide, attempts to cyclise the pure linear peptide did not 
yield any of the desired product.  This unexpected observation is in line with results from 
Chapter 3 which showed that it was not possible to cyclise the pure linear peptide using the 
Middleton conditions or other buffering conditions. 
All of the samples tested show the same molecular weight by LC-MS, which indicates that 
they all have the same primary sequence and that any difference in activity must be caused 
by a difference in disulfide bond connectivity. 
As the LC-MS machine used only gives masses between 100 and 2000 Daltons, the molecular 
ion is not observed.  Instead, the +5, +6 and +7 ions are the most commonly observed masses 
of ProTx-II.  However, the difference between the fully cyclised, partially cyclised and 
completely uncyclised peptide is very small and so the first experiments were designed to 
make sure all of the peptide samples were fully cyclised.  To do this, 2,3-dibromomaleimide 
was added to each of the peptide samples, which reacts with a free sulfhydryl group to give a 
maleimide-conjugated moeity thereby end-capping the peptide (Figure 5.22).17 
Figure 5.22: Reaction of a Free Sulfhydryl Group with 2,3-Dibromomaleimide (284) 
To compare the samples, the peptides were then left in the presence of TCEP for 1 h to break 
all the disulfide bonds before again adding the maleimide, which should in theory add three 
maleimide residues to the peptide increasing the mass by 285 Daltons.  The results from 
these experiments are summarised in Table 5.4.

Table 5.4: Results from the Maleimide End-Capping Experiments 
Before the experiments began, each peptide was submitted for LC-MS analysis to ensure the 
correct mass (3826 Da) was present (Table 5.4, Entries 1  3).  With this condition satisfied, 
maleimide was added (Table 5.4, Entries 4  6).  In all three cases, no addition of maleimide 
was observed which confirmed that there were no free sulfhydryl groups present and 
corroborates the work by Middleton et al.16 that all six cysteines are involved in disulfide 
bonds. 
The addition of TCEP (Table 5.4, Entries 7  9) was designed to act as a control; the TCEP 
should fully reduce the peptide thereby giving 6 free sulfhydryl groups which will then be able 
to react with the maleimide reagent.  A step-wise protocol was adopted as described by 
Smith et al.17 in which the peptide is first left to reduce in the presence of TCEP for 1 h before 
the addition of maleimide.  After incubation with TCEP, the peptide produced in-house by 
leaving it to cyclise in water for 7 days was fully reduced and showed a mass of 3832 as 
expected.  Upon addition of maleimide, the mass increased to 4111, which corresponds to 
the addition of 3 maleimide bridges, that is, reaction with all six free sulfhydryl bridges 
occurred as expected (Table 5.4, Entry 7).  Interestingly, after 1 h in the reducing conditions, 
neither the peptide produced in house using the Park cyclisation conditions nor that 
synthesised by Smartox showed any reduction (Table 5.4, Entries 8 and 9).  As no reduction 
was observed, it is also not surprising that no maleimide addition could occur. 
The LC-MS data shows that no free sulfhydryl groups are present and that all six cysteines are 
involved in disulfide bonds, which is in line with the work reported by Middleton et al.16  
However, the difference in reactivity with the TCEP and in the patch clamping experiments 
suggests that there are discrepancies between the peptides.  To probe this, the peptides 
were next submitted for analysis by analytical HPLC (Table 5.5).

Table 5.5: Summary of Analytical HPLC Results 
From the analytical HPLC data, it is clear that two separate peptide species with different 
retention times are present.  As previous data have shown, the cyclisation in pure water for 7 
days gives the same peptide as that formed by Tocris (Table 5.5, Entries 1, 2 and 5).  
However, it is clear that this differs from the peptide produced by Smartox (Table 5.5, Entries 
1, 3 and 6).  By far the most interesting result is the peptide cyclised in-house using the Park 
cyclisation method (Table 5.5, Entry 4).  The results show that two peptides have formed  
one with the same retention time as that shown by the Tocris peptide and one with the same 
retention time as that shown by the Smartox peptide.  Unfortunately, attempts to separate 
the two peptides were not successful as analysis by HPLC after purification revealed that only 
one peptide with a retention time of 2.06 (that is, the same as the Tocris peptide) was found 
to be present. 
The difference in reactivity between the peptides and the different analytical HPLC traces 
both strongly suggest that two separate disulfide bond connectivities have been synthesised 
in the laboratory.  This strongly suggests that whilst the original peptide method for 
cyclisation in-house gives the thermodynamic product, the park cyclisation peptide and the 
peptide produced by Smartox are both the kinetic product.  This was confirmed by the fact 
that the Park cyclisation product could be turned into the thermodynamic, TCEP-sensitive, 
product if left in pure water.  As all the peptides tested were shown to have the same mass 
by LC-MS, it is highly likely that the difference in the products comes from the disulfide bond 
connectivity. 
5.6 Probing Disulfide Bond Connectivity 
In Chapter 3 it was shown that although the connectivity between Cys-2 and Cys-5 was 
confirmed, it was not possible to determine the other two cysteine bonds.  The well-
documented ICK structure contains three overlapping disulfide bonds in the pattern 1-4, 2-5, 
3-6.  However, another connectivity pattern known as the disulfide-directed -hairpin (DDH) 
motif in which the disulfide bonds are found in the pattern 1-3, 2-5, 4-6 could also be present 
in the system.  Work by Shu et al.18 has shown that HwTx-II (289), a peptide isolated from the 
Selenocosmia huwena spider has this DDH motif, which is characterised by two -turns and a 
double-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Figure 5.23).  The 2-5 bond is the only conserved link 
between the ICK and DDH motifs and the group propose that the DDH motif is a structural 
ancestor to the more complex ICK binding pattern.  It is thought that the 2-5 bond contributes 
to the stability of the -sheet structure19 and that this explains the conservation of the bond 
between the two motifs.  The DDH motif was first identified by the King group,6 who found the 
fold to be present in a peptide isolated from the Hadronyche versuta spider. 
Figure 5.23: Comparison of the Solution Phase NMR Structures of the DDH motif in HwTx-II 
(289)18 against the ICK motif of ProTx-II (22)2,5 
To investigate the disulfide connectivity of the two ProTx-II structures, a sample of the 
peptide produced in-house by cyclising in water for 7 days and a sample of the peptide from 
Smartox were again subjected to the double digestion procedure detailed in Chapter 3 
(Figure 5.24). 
Figure 5.24: Products from the Digestion of ProTx-II using Trypsin and Glu-C 
Having digested the peptide with both Trypsin and Glu-C, the peptides were submitted for 
MS/MS analysis.b  The peptide should theoretically be cleaved in five places by the Trypsin 
and then between Glu-17 and Gly-18 by the Glu-C enzyme to give fragments (290) and either 
(291) or (292) (Figure 5.24). 
In Chapter 3, it was shown that the post-source decay experiments carried out by Middleton 
and co-workers could not be replicated and that it was not possible to differentiate between 
a 1-3, 4-6 connectivity and a 1-4, 3-6 connectivity.  This meant that only the presence of the 
2-5 disulfide bond had been previously confirmed and that the question of ICK or DDH 
connectivity had not been answered. 
By leaving the peptides to cyclise in water for seven days, the thermodynamic minimum was 
reached.  The triple ring analogues 214  216 are also likely to have the same thermodynamic 
minimum structure as the parent peptide, given the use of the same cyclisation procedure 
and the control of the connectivity by virtue of the insertion of a thioether bond.  It is highly 
likely that the structures all share the ICK pattern, in common with the Sigma Aldrich and 
Tocris samples of ProTx-II.  The kinetic product structure exhibited by the Smartox and Park 
cyclisation peptides is therefore likely to have the DDH connectivity of 1-3, 2-5, 4-6. 
A preliminary MS/MS experiment was carried out to try to ascertain if this theory was 
correct.  Unfortunately, it was found that no fragment with a mass of 1436 amu was found in 
either peptide sample.  However, in the Smartox sample, a peptide with a mass of 1566 amu 
was discovered.  This corresponds to the expected fragment plus an extra lysine and was also 
observed by Middleton and co-workers.  Given the tight structures of both the ICK and DDH 
motifs, it is unsurprising that the trypsin was unable to cleave at all five sites on the peptide, 
which is in line with observations outlined in Chapter 3 and those published in the Middleton 
paper.  There are two possibilities for the position of the lysine - Lys-14 or Lys-27.  As two 
lysines next to each other must be cleaved at the tail end of the molecule, it is more likely to 
be Lys-27 which has not been removed by the trypsin.  This would give 293 or 294 (Figure 
5.25). 
b This work was carried out by Adam Cryar in the Thalassinos Laboratory at UCL. 
Figure 5.25: Possible Products from the MS/MS Experiments 
Position of Extra Lysine Resulting from Incomplete Cleavage Highlighted in Red. 
Bombardment of the 1566 amu fragment gave masses close to those for 296 and 298.  
However, in both cases, the desired mass was 1 amu out.  This data is not conclusive but 
could be used to tentatively suggest the naturally occurring ProTx-II peptide in fact displays 
the DDH and not the ICK structure previously published.  Unfortunately, in this set of 
preliminary experiments, the peptide sample cyclised using pure water for 7 days did not 
digest correctly using the double digestion method.  Neither the 1436 nor 1566 amu 
fragments corresponding to the peptides containing cysteines 1, 3, 4 and 6 nor the 1776 amu 
fragment containing the 2-5 connectivity were observed.  Thus, no further analysis could be 
carried out on this sample. 
However, given that the Park cyclisation structure could be easily converted into the 
thermodynamic minimum structure by leaving in water, it is possible that the Middleton 
group unwittingly carried out the same experiment and thus analysed the non-naturally 
occurring structure of ProTx-II.  As the experimental details for their trypsin digest involved 
leaving the peptide in water for 2  5 days, it is highly likely that this experiment did cause the 
peptide to interconvert.  As the trypsin digest was longer than that performed in this thesis 
(18 h for the trypsin digest, followed by 24 h for the Glu-C digest), this would account for the 
differences in peptide structure observed in both experiments. 
Therefore, tentative data from the peptide digestions carried out in the Middleton paper and 
in this thesis could be combined to postulate that the naturally occurring ProTx-II peptide in 
fact displays DDH and not the previously stated ICK connectivity.  Further MS/MS analysis will 
need to be carried out before this can be conclusively decided but the body of evidence 
presented here clearly shows that two separate structures are present and can be 
differentiated by analytical HPLC (although they have the same mass by LCMS). 
5.7 Conclusions 
Through the use of homology modelling software, it was possible to build a structure of 
ProTx-II (22) close to that determined experimentally by Park and co-workers in 2014.  Using 
this structure, a total of 20 analogues of ProTx-II were generated and evaluated.  These 
comprised of eight single ring structural analogues, which adopted different structures from 
the parent peptide, as well as nine double ring and three triple ring analogues.  As with the 
single ring analogues, the double ring structures generated from the C-terminal end of the 
parent peptide also did not show similarity to the parent peptide and were deemed unlikely 
to show any activity in vitro.  However, two of the N-terminal double ring analogues modelled 
did show similarity to the parent peptide.  Although this observation was in line with work 
published by other groups, who showed that changing the N-terminal ring did not have any 
great structural effect on the peptide,6-8 it was not possible to synthesise and isolate these 
analogues.  This could be due to instability within the structure, which was not apparent from 
the modelling calculations and prevented the peptides from cyclising to give the desired 
products. 
Finally, as predicted, all three of the triple ring analogues closely resemble the structure of 
the parent peptide.  This is unsurprising as replacing a disulfide bond with a lanthionine 
bridge results in only a mild change in the constraint on each of the rings; as the structure is 
already highly constrained, this small difference appears to have little effect on the overall 
structure of the peptides and as such all three analogues are predicted to have similar levels 
of activity in vitro. 
Unexpectedly, none of the compounds synthesised, including the parent peptide, showed 
any activity when tested against the hNav1.7 ion channel.  The use of two separate companies 
for testing indicated that the problem was with the peptides themselves rather than the 
testing platform used by the company.  This led to work on a new structural characterisation 
of ProTx-II (22) and the identification of a discrepancy between commercial sources of the 
peptide.  Analysis by LC-MS including the use of maleimide end-capping experiments 
confirmed that all sources of ProTx-II (22) contained a peptide of the same mass and that all 
six cysteines were involved in disulfide bonds.  However, analysis by analytical HPLC showed 
that the peptides gave two peaks differing in retention time by 0.2 min.  These peptides were 
predicted to differ in their cysteine cross-linking patterns and to be the thermodynamic and 
kinetic products of cyclisation of ProTx-II.  To investigate this further, one sample of each of 
the peptides was submitted for digestion and re-analysis by MS/MS.  Although further work 
will need to be carried out, the evidence has started to suggest that ProTx-II itself can be 
found in two forms displaying the previously reported ICK connectivity and the evolutionary 
precursor DDH structure, with the naturally occurring peptide displaying the DDH motif.

6. Chapter 6: Conclusions and Future Work 
The aim of this thesis was to investigate the synthesis of truncated analogues of an active 
parent peptide containing both disulfide and thioether bridges, with the aim of probing the 
structure-activity relationship of the hNav1.7 ion channel.  In order to form the thioether 
bridged peptides, it was first necessary to synthesise a large quantity of diastereomerically 
pure, orthogonally protected lanthionine.  Extensive research into the synthesis resulted in 
the design of an improved, more robust methodology which worked well on both small and 
large scales.  Improvements were made in the protection of the constituent amino acids both 
with the reaction themselves and in the purification procedures, which allowed the large 
scale synthesis of the intermediates to be outsourced.  Improvements in the coupling and 
deprotection steps helped improve the overall yield to 18% over seven steps on small scale.  
This route also translated well to large scale processing and it was possible to use this method 
in an industrial setting to produce multi-gram quantities of the desired novel diastereoisomer 
of lanthionine 142. 
Using this procedure, preliminary investigations into the synthesis of both regioisomers of the 
orthogonally protected cystathionines (245) and (246) were also carried out.  The work has 
thus far shown that it is possible to form the required monomers in the synthesis of 
regioisomer (245) in high yield on a reasonably large scale.  To finish the synthesis, a 
significant amount of optimisation of the coupling reaction is required but with greater 
amounts of the monomers available, the final two steps should be easily achieved.  Possible 
routes to investigate the coupling reaction further include using the bromo-derivative with 
the cesium carbonate coupling conditions or using the phase-transfer conditions used in the 
van der Donk group.  With regards to the second regioisomer (246), more work needs to be 
done to prevent lactonization of the allyl/Alloc homoserine (246).  With the complete 
protection of the homoserine and the work on the coupling reaction to form the other 
regioisomer, it should again prove easy to form the final product. 
Having synthesised large quantities of lanthionine 142, research began on the synthesis of 
lanthionine-containing analogues of ProTx-II (22) as well as the disulfide-containing 
equivalents.  In total, 10 analogues of ProTx-II (22) were synthesised as well as two forms of 
the native peptide.  A total of seven single ring analogues were synthesised to probe the SAR 
by finding out which parts of the peptide are important for binding within the active site of 
the ion channel.  By designing a novel microwave methodology for the incorporation of 
lanthionine into a peptide, three analogues containing a thioether bridge were formed.  This 
methodology allowed for the synthesis of the largest known lanthionine-containing single 
ring structures made to date.  Research showed that although it was possible to observe the 
double ring analogues both with and without a lanthionine bridge, these proved to have 
inherently unstable structures, which could not be subjected to purification by conventional 
means as they did not appear to be stable in water for long periods of time. 
Using the novel microwave-based protocol, together with the inclusion of Hmb protection to 
prevent aggregation on resin and the use of orthogonal protecting groups, three further 
analogues were synthesised which all contained one thioether bridge interlocking with two 
disulfide bridges.  These are the first known examples of such structures produced to date 
and show the versatility of the synthetic strategy. 
The use of the Hmb protecting group could help with the synthesis of the double ring 
analogues and future work should include investigation into the incorporation of these amino 
acids into the synthetic strategy.  An alternative method could use pseudo-proline structures 
in the synthesis; this would increase the amount of constraint in a system and could 
encourage the cyclisation step.  Use of a pseudo-proline could also theoretically increase the 
maximum ring size beyond the 11 amino acids between the two halves of the lanthionine 
moiety, which may allow for the synthesis of the N-terminal lanthionine-containing single 
ring. 
Having synthesised the peptides, all the structures were modelled to allow for prediction of 
activity.  As expected, the triple ring analogues exhibited structures closely related to the 
parent peptide.  Unexpectedly, none of the compounds synthesised, nor the parent peptide 
showed any activity against the hNav1.7 ion channel.  Having ruled out the possibility of a 
problem with the testing platform by using two companies, investigations into the nature of 
the parent peptide were begun.  Although LC-MS analysis confirmed that all sources of ProTx-
II (22) shared the same mass, analytical HPLC showed that two forms of the peptide, with 
differing retention times, were present.  These peptides display differing products of 
cyclisation and one product can be converted into the other product by leaving in water.  
Further MS/MS experiments need to be carried out but preliminary data suggests that 
contrary to the published literature, naturally occurring ProTx-II actually has the DDH motif 
and not the previously assumed ICK structure.  The peptides designed and synthesised in this 
thesis were based on an original paper claiming that the parent peptide displayed an ICK 
connectivity motif.  The ICK structure has been shown to likely be the inactive conformation 
of the peptide and so it would be interesting to form DDH analogues of ProTx-II to see if 
these displayed any activity.  It might be interesting to make the single ring disulfide and 
thioether analogues to probe the structure-activity relationship between the peptide and the 
ion channel, but more intriguing would be the formation of the triple ring analogues.  The 
most interesting peptide would contain a thioether bridge in place of either the 1-3 or 4-6 
disulfide bond, as this should guarantee a DDH motif.  These peptides would then need to be 
tested against the hNav1.7 ion channel assay to see if activity could be restored. 
As it has been found to be facile to convert between the DDH and ICK connectivities for this 
system, it would be interesting to see if other ICK peptides can also form the DDH structures.  
If this turns out to be the case, it will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis which 
peptide structure is isolated from a particular source.  Given the wide use of ICK peptides 
within literature for probing a variety of ion channels, this could have far-reaching 
consequences on investigations into the use of ICK peptides within research as both probes 
and therapeutics.

7.1 General Experimental 
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were obtained from chemical suppliers with no 
further purification.  Dry DMF, THF and CH2Cl2 were dried over anhydrous alumina columns,1 
with moisture levels typically below 15 ppm by Karl Fischer titration.  Brine refers to a 
saturated solution of sodium chloride in water and sodium bicarbonate refers to a saturated 
solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate in water.  Ether refers to diethyl ether and petrol to 
petroleum ether fractions boiling between 40 and 60 C.  All water used was either distilled 
using an Elga Purelab Option R 7 water purifier or used directly from a bottle of HPLC-grade 
water.  All reactions were carried out in closed systems under Argon. 
NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AC300, AV400, AC500 or AC600 spectrometer 
(300 MHz, 400 MHz, 500 MHz and 600 MHz respectively) and all samples were dissolved in 
deuterated chloroform unless otherwise stated.  Chemical shifts () are given in ppm units

Rotations were recorded using a Perkin Elmer 343 polarimeter and are reported in 101 deg 
cm2 g1.  Melting points were recorded on a Gallenkamp Hot Stage apparatus and are 
uncorrected. 
Flash column chromatography was carried out using silica gel with particle size <60 m and 
reverse phase column chromatography was carried out using silica gel 60 silanized (53-200 
m).  Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminium backed Sigma-Aldrich 
TLC plates with F254 fluorescent indicator.  Developed plates were air dried and analysed 
under a UV light or by staining with the appropriate indicator.

Iodine (0.852 g, 3.36 mmol, 1.3 eq.) was added portionwise to a solution of 
triphenylphosphine (0.846 g, 3.23 mmol, 1.25 eq.) and imidazole (0.228 g, 3.36 mmol, 1.3 eq.) 
in CH2Cl2 (12 mL) to give a yellow solution.  To this a solution of (S)-allyl 3-hydroxy-2-
(trimethylphenylamino)propanoate (138) (1.00 g, 2.58 mmol, 1 eq.) in CH2Cl2 (12 mL) was 
added dropwise.  The reaction was left to stir at 0 C for 2 h before being allowed to warm to 
room temperature and left to stir for a further hour. 
The reaction was then cooled to 0 C and a solution of (R)-tert-butyl 2-
((9(fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl))amino)-3-mercaptopropanoate (62) (0.562 g, 1.41 mmol, 
0.7 eq.) in DMF (23 mL) was added.  Dry cesium carbonate (0.229 g, 0.703 mmol, 0.35 eq.) 
was added and the solution turned colourless.  The dichloromethane was removed using 
nitrogen and the reaction was stirred for a further 2 h before the addition of a second portion 
of cesium carbonate (0.229 g, 0.703 mmol, 0.35 eq.).  The reaction was left to stir for 1.5 h 
before allowing to warm to room temperature.  After a further 0.5 h, ethyl acetate (20 mL) 
was added and the mixture washed with cold citric acid (4 C, 5% aq. w/v, 3 x 20 mL).  The 
organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo.  Purification by column 
chromatography (hexane : ethyl acetate 4 : 1) yielded the title compound as a white solid

Method 3 
(S)-Allyl 3-hydroxy-2-(trimethylphenylamino)propanoate (138) (1.10 g, 2.83 mmol, 1 eq.) was 
dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (3 mL) at room temperature in the presence of triphenylphosphine 
(1.114 g, 4.25 mmol, 1.5 eq.).  The solution was cooled to -10 oC using an acetone/ice/water 
bath.  Diethylazodicarboxylate (0.670 mL, 4.25 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was then added dropwise over 
the course of 1 min.  The reaction was left to stir for 5 min before the addition of methyl 
iodide (0.260 mL, 4.25 mmol, 1.5 eq.).  The reaction was left to stir for a further 3 h before 
removal of CH2Cl2 and excess methyl iodide using nitrogen.  The reaction was warmed to 0 C 
and a solution of (R)-tert-butyl 2-((9(fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl))amino)-3-
mercaptopropanoate (62) (0.792 g, 1.98 mmol, 0.7 eq.) in DMF (34 mL) was added.  A colour 
change from brown to yellow was observed.  Dry cesium carbonate (0.323 g, 0.990 mmol, 
0.35 eq.) was added and the reaction stirred for a further 2 h before the addition of a second 
portion of cesium carbonate (0.323 g, 0.990 mmol, and 0.35 eq.).  After a final 2h, ethyl 
acetate (30 mL) was added and the mixture washed with cold citric acid (4 C, 5% aq. w/v, 
3 x 30 mL).  The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo.  Crude NMR 
showed none of the desired product was formed.

7.3 Experimental for Peptide Synthesis (Chapter 3) 
7.3.1 General Experimental for Peptide Synthesis 
The peptides were either synthesised using a peptide synthesiser or by hand using the same 
timings and solution volumes.  Microwave couplings were carried out using a Personal 
Chemistry Smith Creator microwave loaded with 5 mL reaction vials.  In all cases, the vial was 
irradiated for 5 min at 60 C before transfer of the resin back to the reaction syringe.  DMF 
was used as the primary solvent throughout the peptide synthesis. 
Peptides were centrifuged using an Eppendorf Centrifuge, model 5810R and were lyophilised 
using a Thermo Scientific Heto PowerDry LL1500 freeze-dryer.  Peptides were agitated using 
an IKA KS130 basic platform shaker. 
Method 1: Automated Peptide Synthesis 
Peptides were synthesised on a MultiSynTech Syro Peptide Synthesiser (Model MP-60).  The 
peptide synthesiser contains an agitation block capable of holding 2 mL and 5 mL syringes 
with frits, connected to a vacuum pump to remove solutions.  Amino acid and reagent 
concentrations were calculated based on the quantity and loading of the resin.  The total 
volume of all reagents in each step was 1.5 mL.  All reagents were dissolved in HPLC grade 
Fmoc Deprotection: All Fmoc deprotections were carried out using a solution of 
40% piperidine in DMF, which was added to the syringe containing the resin.  The mixture 
was agitated for 20 sec every minute for a total of 3 min before removal of reagent by 
filtration under vacuum.  The resin was washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL) before addition of a 
second portion of piperidine in DMF solution (40% v/v, 0.75 mL), followed by DMF (0.75 mL) 
to make an overall 20% v/v solution of piperidine in DMF.  This mixture was agitated for 20 
sec every minute for a total of 10 min.  The reagents were removed by filtration under 
vacuum and the resin washed with DMF (6 x 1.5 mL). 
Amino Acid Coupling: Fmoc-protected amino acid (4 eq.) was added to the reaction syringe 
with HBTU (4 eq.) and DIPEA (8 eq.).  The mixture was agitated for 20 sec every 3 min for a 
total of 40 min.  The reagents were removed by filtration under vacuum and the resin washed 
with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL). 
Lanthionine Coupling: (S)-allyl 3-((S)-2-((9(fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl))amino-3-tert-butoxy-3-
oxopropylthio)-2-(allyloxycarbonylamino)propanoic acid 142 (3 eq.), PyAOP (5 eq.) and HOAt 
(5 eq.) were dissolved in DMF (4 mL).  To this, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 eq.) was added 
and left to react for 1 min before addition to a microwave vial containing the resin.  The vial 
was irradiated for 5 min at 60 C before transfer of the resin back to the reaction syringe.  The 
resin was then washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL). 
Allyl/Alloc Deprotection: Simultaneous deprotection of both the allyl and Alloc ester groups 
was performed using tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium (0) (1 eq.) and 1,3-
dimethylbarbituric acid (10 eq.) in a 1 : 1 solution of chloroform : DMF (2 mL).  This was left to 
react for 2 h in the dark under argon before removal of the solution by filtration.  The resin 
was then washed with CH2Cl2 (10 x 1.5 mL), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (5 % w/v, 15 x 1.5 
mL) and DMF (10 x 1.5 mL). 
Lanthionine Cyclisation: N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 eq.) was added to a solution of PyAOP 
(5 eq.) and HOAt (5 eq.) in DMF (4 mL).  The solution was left to react for 1 min before 
addition to a microwave vial containing the resin.  The vial was irradiated for 5 min at 60 C 
before transfer of the resin back to the reaction syringe.  The resin was then washed with 
DMF (4 x 1.5 mL). 
Method 2: Manual Peptide Synthesis 
Manual peptide synthesis was carried out using an IKA KS130 basic platform shaker to agitate 
the solutions.  Reactions were carried out in 5 mL syringes with frits, which were evacuated 
by hand at the end of each reaction.  Amino acid and reagent concentrations were calculated 
based on the quantity and loading of the resin.  The total volume of all reagents in each step 
was 1.5 mL.  All reagents were dissolved in HPLC grade DMF. 
Fmoc Deprotection: All Fmoc deprotections were carried out using a solution of 40% 
piperidine in DMF, which was added to the syringe containing the resin.  The mixture was 
agitated for 3 min before removal of reagent by filtration.  A second portion of piperidine in 
DMF solution (40% v/v, 0.75 mL) was added, followed by DMF (0.75 mL) to make an overall 
20% v/v solution of piperidine in DMF.  This mixture was agitated for a total of 10 min.  The 
reagents were removed by filtration and the resin washed with DMF (6 x 1.5 mL). 
Amino Acid Coupling: Fmoc-protected amino acid (0.6 mL, 4 eq.) was added to the reaction 
syringe with HBTU (0.6 mL, 4 eq.) and DIPEA (0.3 mL, 8 eq.).  The mixture was agitated for a 
total of 40 min.  The reagents were removed by filtration and the resin washed with DMF (4 x 
1.5 mL). 
Lanthionine Coupling: (S)-allyl 3-((S)-2-((9(fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl))amino-3-tert-butoxy-3-
oxopropylthio)-2-(allyloxycarbonylamino)propanoic acid 142 (3 eq.), PyAOP (5 eq.) and HOAt 
(5 eq.) were dissolved in DMF (4 mL).  To this, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 eq.) was added 
and left to react for 1 min before addition to a microwave vial containing the resin.  The vial 
was irradiated for 5 min at 60 C before transfer of the resin back to the reaction syringe.  The 
resin was then washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL). 
Allyl/Alloc Deprotection: Simultaneous deprotection of both the allyl and Alloc ester groups 
was performed using tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium (0) (1 eq.) and 1,3-
dimethylbarbituric acid (10 eq.) in a 1 : 1 solution of chloroform : DMF (2 mL).  This was left to 
react for 2 h in the dark under argon before removal of the solution by filtration.  The resin 
was then washed with CH2Cl2 (10 x 1.5 mL), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (5% w/v, 15 x 1.5 
mL) and DMF (10 x 1.5 mL). 
Lanthionine Cyclisation: N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 eq.) was added to a solution of PyAOP 
(5 eq.) and HOAt (5 eq.) in DMF (4 mL).  The solution was left to react for 1 min before 
addition to a microwave vial containing the resin.  The vial was irradiated for 5 min at 60 C 
before transfer of the resin back to the reaction syringe.  The resin was then washed with 
DMF (4 x 1.5 mL). 
Cleavage and Purification 
Cleavage and purification procedures were the same for both peptides made manually and 
those made using the peptide synthesiser. 
Cleavage from the Resin: Peptides were first washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL), 
CH2Cl2 (4 x 1.5 mL), methanol (4 x 1.5 mL) and diethyl ether (4 x 1.5 mL) before drying in a 
desiccator for 45 min.  A solution of 94% TFA, 2.5% water, 2.5% EDT and 1% TIPS (2.5 mL) was 
then added to the resin and left to agitate for 30 min on the platform shaker.  After this time, 
the entire solution was transferred to a Falcon tube and 12 mL of diethyl ether was added to 
precipitate the peptide.  The cleavage procedure was then repeated with fresh cleavage 
solution (2.5 mL containing 94% TFA, 2.5% water, 2.5% EDT and 1% TIPS) and left to agitate 
for a further 40 min.  The entire solution was again transferred to a Falcon tube before 
addition of 12 mL of diethyl ether to precipitate the peptide. 
The Falcon tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and 4 C before decanting off 
the diethyl ether solution.  This process was performed 3 times in total before re-dissolving 
the peptide in water and lyophilising. 
HPLC Purification: The peptides were analysed and purified via reverse phase HPLC using 
either a Varian ProStar system with a Model 210 solvent delivery module and a Model 320 
UV detector or a Dionex system with a PDA-100 photodiode array detector and a model ASI-
100 automated sample injector.  The preparative purification was performed using an ACE 
C8-300 semi-preparative column (150 x 10 mm, flow rate of 8.0 mL/min), with UV detection 
at 215 and 254 nm, loaded with 200  1850 L aliquots of a 10-20 mg/mL solution of peptide 
dissolved in water. 
The mobile phase was a decreasing gradient of water in acetonitrile.  Exact gradients have 
been reported for each peptide.  The fractions containing the correct peak were pooled, the 
solvent removed under reduced pressure to approximately 2 mL and the solution freeze-
dried.

Disulfide Bond Cyclisation: Peptides were dissolved in pure water (concentration = 0.1 
mg/mL) and left to stir at 4 C for 7  10 days before concentrating down to approximately 2 
mL.  The solution was then flash frozen and lyophilised to yield the cyclised peptide as a white 
solid.

Analytical HPLC: The purified peptide was analysed by analytical HPLC using an ACE C8-300 
analytical column (150 x 10 mm, flow rate of 1.0 mL/min), with a linear gradient of 2  98% B 
over 20 min (A = water, B = acetonitrile). 
7.3.3 Optimisation of the Synthesis of Lanthionine-Containing Analogues 
All optimisation was carried out using the C-terminal single ring structure 205. 
Preparation of Low-Loading Chlorotrityl Resin: The low-loading chlorotrityl resin was 
prepared from the pre-loaded chlorotrityl resin (220 mg, loading = 0.75 mmol/g).  The resin 
was first swelled in DMF (2 mL) for 45 min before evacuating the syringe.  Acetic anhydride 
(13.5 L, 0.143 mmol, 0.85 eq.) was then added and the resin was left to agitate for 30 min 
on a platform shaker before evacuating the syringe.  The resin was washed with DMF (6 x 1.5 
mL).  To calculate the new loading of the resin, 20 mg of the resin was removed.  To this, 
Fmoc-Gly-OH (5.0 mg in 0.82 mL DMF), DIPEA (30.0 L in 2.29 mL DMF) and HBTU (20.0 mg in 
2.60 mL DMF) were added and left to react for 1 h.  The syringe was then evacuated and the 
peptide was washed with DMF (6 x 1.5 mL).  A solution of DBU in DMF (2% v/v, 2 mL) was 
added and left to react for 30 min before the addition of acetonitrile (8 mL).  2 mL of this 
solution was removed and diluted with a further portion of acetonitrile (23 mL).  The UV 
spectrum of this solution was measured and the optical density at 304 nM recorded against a 
reference sample of DBU in DMF (2% v/v, 2 mL) made to the same concentration in 
acetonitrile.  To calculate the resin loading, the following equation was used:8,9 
Loading = (absorbance x volume)/(extinction coefficient x path length x mass of resin) 
For the knock-down lysine resin, the loading was calculated to be 0.109 mmol/g. 
The initial trial reactions were carried out on a 50 mg scale using pre-loaded resins according 
to Table 7.2.  The second set of trial reactions were carried out on a 100 mg scale to allow 
determination of yields using pre-loaded resins according to Table 7.3. 
The resin was added to a reaction syringe, washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL) and left to swell for 
30 min in 1.5 mL DMF.  After this time, the Fmoc group was removed using the standard 
Fmoc deprotection step described in method 1 above.  Protected lysine (4 eq.) was added to 
the reaction syringe and coupled using HBTU (4 eq. in 0.6 mL DMF) and DIPEA (8 eq. in 0.2636 
mL DMF).  Successive Fmoc deprotections and amino acid couplings were carried out using 
general method 2 with 0.6 mL of protected amino acid solution per coupling step. 
Lanthionine was added to the peptide sequence and left to react according to the conditions 
in Table 7.2 and Table 7.3 using PyAOP (5 eq.), HOAt (5 eq.) and DIPEA (10 eq.) for both the 
coupling and cyclisation steps.  The simultaneous allyl and Alloc deprotection was carried out 
according to the general protocol described above using tetrakistriphenylphosphine 
palladium (0) (1 eq.) and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (10 eq.). 
The peptide was cleaved under standard conditions, washed with ether and lyophilised.  To 
obtain yields, the peptides synthesised according to Table 7.3 were purified using a gradient 
of 5  50 % B over 15 min (A = water, B = acetonitrile) to yield 3 mg of product (8%).

The resin was added to a reaction syringe, washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL) and left to swell for 
30 min in 1.5 mL DMF.  After this time, protected lysine (0.6 mL, 4 eq.) was added to the 
reaction syringe and coupled using HBTU (30.3 mg in 0.6 mL DMF, 4 eq.) and DIPEA (27.7 L 
in 0.2723 mL DMF, 8 eq.).  Successive Fmoc deprotections and amino acid couplings were 
carried out using general method 1 with 0.6 mL of protected amino acid solution per coupling 
step. 
The peptide was then washed with DMF (4 x 1.5 mL), CH2Cl2 (4 x 1.5 mL), methanol (4 x 1.5 
mL) and diethyl ether (4 x 1.5 mL) before drying in a desiccator for 45 min.  Cleavage and 
cyclisation conditions varied depending on the combination of protecting groups as 
summarised below. 
Double Trityl Protection: The peptide was cleaved using a solution of 94% TFA, 2.5% water, 
2.5% EDT and 1% TIPS (2.5 mL) was then added to the resin and left to agitate for 30 min on 
the platform shaker.  After this time, the entire solution was transferred to a Falcon tube and 
12 mL of diethyl ether was added to precipitate the peptide.  The cleavage procedure was 
then repeated with fresh cleavage solution (2.5 mL containing 94% TFA, 2.5% water, 2.5% 
EDT and 1% TIPS) and left to agitate for a further 40 min.  The entire solution was again 
transferred to a Falcon tube before addition of 12 mL of diethyl ether to precipitate the 
peptide.  The Falcon tube was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and 4 C before 
decanting off the diethyl ether solution.  This process was performed 3 times in total before 
re-dissolving the peptide in water and lyophilising.  The peptide was dissolved in water (0.1 
mg/mL) and left for 7 days before concentrating in vacuo. 
Trityl/MMT protection: The peptide was cleaved using a solution of 10% v/v trifluoroethanol 
and 10% v/v acetic acid in CH2Cl2 which was left to stir for 1h before filtering off the liquid and 
concentrating in vacuo.  The peptide was dissolved in 1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in DCM and 
left to stir overnight before concentrating in vacuo.  The peptide was then re-dissolved in a 
solution of 96.5% TFA, 2.5% water and 1% TIPS (2.5 mL) and left to stir for 1 h.  After this 
time, the entire solution was transferred to a Falcon tube and 12 mL of diethyl ether was 
added to precipitate the peptide.  The Falcon tube was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 
rpm and 4 C before decanting off the diethyl ether solution.  This process was performed 3 
times in total before re-dissolving the peptide in water and lyophilising. 
Trityl/Acm protection:  
Method 1: The peptide was cleaved from the resin using a solution of 96.5% TFA, 2.5% water 
and 1% TIPS (2.5 mL) and left to stir for 1 h.  After this time, the entire solution was 
transferred to a Falcon tube and 12 mL of diethyl ether was added to precipitate the peptide.  
The Falcon tube was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and 4 C before decanting off 
the diethyl ether solution.  This process was performed 3 times in total before re-dissolving 
the peptide in water and lyophilising.  The peptide was then left to stir in water for 2 days to 
cyclise.  The peptide was re-dissolved in DMF (1.2 mL) and added drop-wise to a stirred 
solution of iodine (20.6 mg, 0.081 mmol, 8 eq.) in DMF (12 mL) over 30 min.  The reaction 
was left to stir for a further 20 min before dilution with CH2Cl2 (15 mL).  Ascorbic acid (10 ml, 
0.2 M) and sodium acetate (10 mL, 0.5 M) were added and the product was extracted twice 
with 10% v/v methanol in chloroform (10 mL) and once with CH2Cl2 (10 mL).  The combined 
organic layers were washed with water (20 mL), dried (Na2SO4) and most of the solvent was 
removed in vacuo before precipitation in diethyl ether.  The solution was transferred to a 
Falcon tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and 4 C before decanting off the diethyl 
ether solution.  The peptide was then re-dissolved in water and lyophilised. 
Method 2: Iodine (15.2 mg, 0.12 mmol, 6 eq.) in a 3:1 solution of hexafluoroisopropanol to 
chloroform (2 mL) was added to the peptide syringe and left to stir for 30 min.  After this 
time, the peptide was washed with chloroform (10 x 1.5 mL) and DMF (5 x 1.5 mL).  A second 
portion of iodine (15.2 mg, 0.12 mmol, 6 eq.) in DMF (2 mL) was then added and left to stir 
for a further 30 min.  After this time, the peptide was washed again with chloroform (10 x 1.5 
mL) and DMF (5 x 1.5 mL).  The peptide was then cleaved from the resin using a solution of 
96.5% TFA, 2.5% water and 1% TIPS (2.5 mL), which was left to agitate on the platform shaker 
for 1 h.  After this time, the entire solution was transferred to a Falcon tube and 12 mL of 
diethyl ether was added to precipitate the peptide.  The Falcon tube was then centrifuged for 
10 min at 4000 rpm and 4 C before decanting off the diethyl ether solution.  This process was 
performed 3 times in total before re-dissolving the peptide in water and lyophilising. 
None of these methods produced the desired product.

7.5 Experimental for the Analysis of the Connectivity of ProTX-II (Chapter 5) 
HPLC Analysis: The purified peptide was analysed by analytical HPLC using an ACE C8-300 
analytical column (150 x 10 mm, flow rate of 1.0 mL/min), with UV detection at 215 and 254 
nm.  Linear gradient: 2  98% B over 20 min (A = water, B = acetonitrile).  The analysis of the 
chromatograms was conducted using Chromeleon Software version 2.0. 
7.5.1 Preparation of ProTx-II (22) 
Disulfide Bond Cyclisation  Original Method: Purified linear ProTx-II (22) was dissolved in 
pure water (concentration = 0.1 mg/mL) and left to stir at 4 C for 7  10 days before 
concentrating down to approximately 2 mL.  The solution was then flash frozen and 
lyophilised to yield the cyclised peptide as a white solid. 
Analytical HPLC: 
Disulfide Bond Cyclisation  Park Method15: Glutathione(0.15 mM) and glutathione disulfide 
(0.3 mM) were added to a mixture of urea (2 M) and Tris-HCl (0.1 M) in water.  The pH was 
adjusted to 8.0 using saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate.  A solution of crude linear 
ProTx-II (22) was added at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and left to stir for 24 h at room 
temperature.  After this time, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 3 using HCl (2 M).  The 
peptide was purified by analytical HPLC using an ACE C8-300 analytical column (150 x 10 mm, 
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min), with UV detection at 215 and 254 nm.  Linear gradient: 2  98% B 
over 20 min (A = water, B = acetonitrile).

7.5.2 Maleimide Experiments 
All reactions were carried out in a solution containing 57.5% water, 40% acetonitrile and 2.5% 
DMF.  ProTx-II was diluted to a concentration of 100 M and TCEP and 2,3-
dibromomaleimide were diluted to a concentration of 10 mM in this solution. 
Addition of 2,3-dibromomaleimide: Maleimide (19.8 L, 11.0 eq) was added to a solution of 
ProTx-II (180 L, 1.0 eq.).  The solution was mixed and data recorded over the course of 1 h.  
In all cases, no addition of maleimide was observed (see Table 7.6). 
Reduction of ProTx-II: TCEP (18.0 L, 10.0 eq) was added to ProTx-II (180 L, 1.0 eq.).  The 
solution was mixed and left for 1 h.  After this time, 2,3-dibromomaleimide was added to the 
solution as indicated in the above protocol.

7.5.3 Digestion Experiments 
First Digestion Method (Chapter 3): ProTx-II, Trypsin and Glu-C were diluted to a 
concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution.  Trypsin (5.0 L) 
was added to a solution of ProTx-II (100 L) and left to stir at 37 C for 18 h before addition of 
Glu-C (10 L).  The mixture was left to stir for a further 18 h before submitting the solution 
directly for analysis. 
Second Digestion Method (Chapter 3): ProTx-II (50 g) was first dissolved in 50 L of 75 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate solution and then added to a spin column containing immobilised 
trypsin (TT0010, Sigma-Aldrich).  Digestion was carried out according to the manufactures 
protocol and the product collected, flash frozen and lyophilised.  The digested ProTx-II was 
redissolved in 50 L of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution.  Glu-C was diluted to a 
concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution.  Glu-C (2.5 L) was 
added to the ProTx-II solution and left at 37 C for 18 h before submitting the solution directly 
for analysis. 
Third Digestion Method (Chapter 5): ProTx-II was solubilised in 50 mM ammonium 
bicarbonate solution containing 0.1% RapiGest to give a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL.  The 
solution was heated to 40 C for 10 min before the condensate was spun down using a 
techno mini low revolution centrifuge.  Trypsin (2.0 L, 0.5 mg/mL in 50 mM ammonium 
bicarbonate solution) was added to the solution and left at 37 C for 2 h.  After this time, a 
second portion of trypsin (2 L) was added and the solution was left at 37 C for a further 
18 h.  Glu-C (2.5 L, 1.0 mg/mL in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution) was then added 
and the solution left overnight at 37 C.  After this time, the solution was flash frozen and 
lyophilised before submission for analysis. 
7.5.4 Computer Modelling 
Computer modelling was carried out using Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE) 
version 2009.10 with the Amber94 forcefield and Born solvation.16  This uses the DSSP 
hydrogen bond estimation algorithm to assign secondary structure to amino acids. 
ProTx-II was modelled using the homology modelling function within the software and the 
structure was built from the solution phase NMR structure of PaTx-I.17  Lanthionine bonds 
were modelled by creating the disulfide bond-containing compound, removing one sulfur 
atom in silico and using the program to re-calculate the energies and position of the atoms to 
give a rough estimate of the lanthionine bond in the system.
