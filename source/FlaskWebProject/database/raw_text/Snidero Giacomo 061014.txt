Abstract
This thesis presents the measurement of the production cross section of a W bo-
son with a single charm quark in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions using the ATLAS
detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data analysed correspond to an inte-
grated luminosity of 4.6 fb1 and were collected during 2011. This is the first time
that ATLAS data has been used for this particular measurement.
This cross section is of particular interest as a probe of the strange quark density
of the proton. Typically, the strange quark density is considered to be suppressed
relative to that of the other light-quarks in the proton sea. However, some analyses
suggest a more symmetric composition of light-quarks in the proton sea. The
results of this study aim to improve the precision of the determination of the
strange quark density.
The analysis uses events where the W boson decays to a muon and a neutrino. In
such events, the charm quark is identified by its semileptonic decay to a soft muon
within a hadronic jet. The charge correlation between the W boson and the soft
muon is exploited to reduce the backgrounds substantially. The analysis results
are combined with those obtained using additional decay channels.
The measured cross section provides further constraint for the determination of
the strange quark density, advancing the knowledge of the fundamental structure
of the proton. The results are compared with predictions of next-to-leading-order
QCD calculations obtained using various parton distribution function parameter-
isations. Additionally, the ratio of the strange-to-down sea-quark distributions is
determined to be 0.96+0.260.30 at Q
2 = 1.9 GeV2. This supports the hypothesis
of a symmetric composition of light-quarks in the proton sea. The cross sec-
tion ratio (W + + c)/(W + c) is also determined and compared with different
predictions for the asymmetry of the strange and anti-strange quark distribution
functions.
Preface
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory is the worlds most
powerful particle accelerator. This machine has been built to advance the human
knowledge in the discipline of particle physics  the study of the elementary con-
stituents of the Universe and their interactions. The current paradigm of particle
physics is the theoretical framework developed over the 1960s and 70s which is
known as the standard model (SM).
The ATLAS detector is one of the two major experiments operating at the LHC.
The ATLAS research programme can be subdivided into three main areas: Higgs
boson physics, searches for phenomena beyond the SM and precision measurements
of the SM. The latter constitute the benchmark studies with the LHC data. The
measurement of the production cross section of a W boson with a single charm
quark (W +c) described in this thesis is a precision measurement of the SM.
This thesis is structured as follows. The scientific research context is introduced
in chapter 1 with an overview of the standard model, the LHC and the ATLAS
detector. Chapter 2 presents an analysis of the time stability of one of the ATLAS
subdetectors, namely the L1Calo trigger preprocessor. This study is the authors
contribution to the operation and performance of the ATLAS detector.
The measurement of the W+c production cross section is presented in chapter
3 onwards. The theoretical description, the motivations and the strategy of the
W +c production analysis are given in chapter 3. The LHC collision data sample,
the selections for W   decays and c-quark jets, and the Monte Carlo simulated
samples for the modelling of the signal and background processes are explained in
chapter 4.
Chapter 5 describes the determination of the yield of W +c events in the data.
Both data-driven methods and simulations are used for the background estimation.
Dedicated selection criteria are applied to reduce the Z +jets and QCD multijet
backgrounds and enhance the signal purity of the selected data. In chapter 6 the
number of W+c events is measured as a function of the charge and pseudorapidity
of the muon from the W -decay.
In chapter 7 the integrated and differential W +c cross sections are determined
from the measured yields. The integrated cross section is combined with that
resulting from a similar analysis which uses W  e events. The combined result
is compared to theoretical predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD calculations
obtained using different parton distribution function parameterisations. In addition,
the combined results are reported for the cross section ratio (W ++c)/(W+c)
and for the differential cross sections, as a function of i) the pseudorapidity of
the W -decay muon; ii) the jet multiplicity. Finally, the ratio of strange-to-down
sea-quark densities is shown as determined from the combination of this analysis
with those using the W  e events and additional charm quark decay channels.
Furthermore, appendix A describes the multijet background estimation, carried
out by the author, which was used in an ATLAS measurement of the top quark pair
production cross section. The contribution of the background process is evaluated
by extending the method used for the W +c analysis.
Details of collaboration and publications
The W + c analysis described in this thesis is part of the measurement by the
ATLAS Collaboration published in reference [1]. Within this collaboration, which
includes almost 3,000 researchers, the W +c analysis was carried out by a team of
9 researchers, including the author of this thesis. The W +c analysis in this thesis
is also detailed in the ATLAS internal analysis report [2].
The operation and maintenance of the ATLAS L1Calo trigger preprocessor is
the work of around 100 ATLAS researchers. Specifically, the analysis described in
this thesis was performed by 2 researchers, including the author of this thesis, and
is included in the summary of analyses and results published in reference [3].
The QCD multijet estimation in appendix A has been used in a measurement
of the top quark pair production cross section by the ATLAS Collaboration, which
is reported in [4]. This cross section measurement was carried out by 10 ATLAS
researchers, including the author of this thesis. Moreover, this analysis team cali-
brated the soft muon tagging algorithm used in both the W +c and the top quark
pair analyses. These studies of the soft muon tagger are also documented in the
ATLAS internal analysis report [5].
Due to the complexity of modern particle physics experiments, a single re-
searcher cannot carry out the work required for all aspects of an ATLAS analysis.
This thesis specifically describes the contributions which are the own and original
work of the author. A summary of these contributions is listed below. Any aspect
of analysis or plot which was not produced by the author is clearly stated as such
and referenced throughout the thesis.
Chapter 2: The author developed the analysis strategy, implemented the algo-
rithm in a package within the L1Calo software framework, analysed the data
and presented the results.
Chapter 3: The author evaluated from simulation the expected contributions
from the different scattering processes to the W + c production, and the
expected fraction of opposite sign signal events.
Chapter 4: The author wrote his own software for the W +c event selection and
implemented the soft muon tagging algorithm; analysed datasets of LHC
collisions and Monte Carlo simulated collisions using the CERNs World LHC
Computing Grid system1. The author also produced datasets used for the
calibration of soft muons mistag rate.
Chapter 5: The author estimated the multijet, W +light and Z +jets backgrounds
using data-driven methods; evaluated the other analysis backgrounds with
simulation. The author also studied dedicated selection requirements on the
charm-jet and dimuon invariant mass to suppress the Z +jets background and
optimised the E missT and m
T selections to reduce the multijet and Z +jets

backgrounds. The author also obtained the results for the yield of W +c
events and compared kinematical distributions of the selected data with
predictions.
Chapter 6: The author evaluated the backgrounds as a function of the W -decay
muons charge and pseudorapidity, using both data-driven methods and sim-
ulated samples. The author also obtained the results for the charge divided
yields of W+c events; measured the pseudorapidity distribution for the W+c
production and compared it to prediction.
Chapter 7: The author calculated the combination of integrated cross sections
using the profile likelihood method, using dedicated statistical software pack-
ages and generating Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments to validate the result
of the maximum likelihood fit. The author also compared the combined
result to the theoretical predictions taken from reference.
Appendix A: The author obtained the results for the QCD multijet background
estimation in the muon channel analysis, which was used to measure the top
quark pair production cross section.
Appendix B: The author obtained the results for the predicted yields in the pretag
data sample and compared kinematical distributions with predictions.

The Large Hadron Collider and the
ATLAS experiment
The work presented in this thesis is contextualised in this chapter. A concise
scheme of particle physics together with the goals and early results from the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) are summarised. The LHC accelerator at the CERN labo-
ratory is briefly described and the structure of one its the two major experiments,
the ATLAS detector, is summarised.
1.1 Physics at the LHC
The LHC is a particle accelerator constructed with the aim of furthering knowledge
in the field of particle physics. Ultimately, this discipline intends to recognise the
fundamental constituents of the Universe, or elementary particles, and to under-
stand their mutual interactions.
The current paradigm of particle physics is the theoretical framework known
as the standard model (SM). Originally, this name was given to the theory of
electroweak interactions ideated in the 1960s [69]. More commonly, the SM also
incorporates the theory of the strong interactions formulated in the 1970s, which
is known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1012]. In this thesis standard
model refers both to the electroweak and the QCD sectors.
The SM is a quantum field theory: in the equations of motion, the elemen-

tary particles are represented by quantum fields. Such particles are classified into
fermions and bosons. In the SM there are twelve fermions represented by spin-1/2
fields, which are divided into three families of leptons and three families of quarks.
There are also five gauge bosons represented by spin-1 fields: the W +, W, Z and
photon () mediate the electroweak interaction, and the gluon1 is the carrier of
the strong interaction. One more particle, know as the Higgs boson, is incorpo-
rated in the SM as a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism.
The gravitational interaction is not included in the SM framework. Figure 1.1 is a
scheme of the elementary particles of the SM.
Figure 1.1: Scheme of the elementary particles of the standard model. Taken from [13].
The first generation of quarks and leptons contains the lightest and hence
stable elementary particles. The quarks and leptons of the other two generations
are heavier and eventually decay into the lightest particles of the first generation.
While leptons experience only the electroweak interactions, quarks are also
subject to the strong interaction. This leads to a substantial difference in the ob-
servations of the electroweak and the QCD sectors. Quarks and gluons have never

been observed as free particles, as they are confined into composite particles
known as hadrons. The latter are further classified into baryons, e.g. the proton,
and mesons, e.g. the pion.
The SM is a gauge theory formulated in the Lagrangian formalism. The interac-
tion between the fermions is introduced by postulating the invariance or symmetry
of the Lagrangian with respect to an arbitrary local gauge transformation of the
fields. Initially, the requirement of the Lagrangians invariance forces all the gauge
bosons to be massless. This implication is in contradiction with the observation
of massive W and Z bosons.
Mass generation is restored through the spontaneous symmetry breaking mech-
anism, i.e. when the set of minimum energy states of the Lagrangian, or vacuum,
does not share the gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian. As one such state must be
chosen for the quantisation of the Lagrangian, the symmetry is broken, or hidden,
by this specific choice. This mechanism is included in the SM by adding a neutral,
spin-0 boson field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value. This minimalis-
tic model for the symmetry breaking originates the particle known as the Higgs
boson [1416].
Since its formulation in the late 1960s the standard model has been capable of
predicting an extraordinary amount of experimental results. Two remarkable and
relatively recent achievements are the predictions of the top quark, observed at the
Tevatron collider [17, 18], and of the W boson mass, measured with sub-percent
precision from the combination of Tevatron and LEP collider data [19].
Nonetheless, the standard model has not been exhaustively tested and does not
provide a complete picture of the observed Universe. For this reason, the LHC has
been built to test the validity of the SM and to search for physics phenomena which
may lie beyond it, at an unprecedented energy scale. The research conducted at
the LHC can be divided into the three broad categories outlined below.
Higgs boson and spontaneous symmetry breaking
The existence of the standard model Higgs boson was an unconfirmed theoretical
model prior to the LHC. Previous experiments attempting to observe this particle
26 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
were unsuccessful.
On 4 July 2012 the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC announced
the direct observation of a new particle compatible with the Higgs boson [20,
21]. Figure 1.2 shows the invariant mass distribution of the di-photon candidates
measured by the ATLAS experiment, which was presented in the observation of
the new boson in [20]. To date, all the studies concerning the properties of the
newly discovered particle are consistent with expectations for the standard model
Higgs boson. For example, the ATLAS measurements of the spin and coupling
strength are reported in references [22] and [23], respectively.
However, different models to that of the standard model exist to describe the
symmetry breaking mechanism. For instance, non-minimal theories encompass the
existence of multiple Higgs-like bosons or lead the boson associated with the
symmetry breaking mechanism to be a composite state. A review of such theories
is found in [24].
Figure 1.2: Invariant mass distribution of di-photon candidates measured by the ATLAS
experiment. The data are fitted to the sum of a signal component with mass 126.5 GeV
and the background component. This result, combined with data of other Higgs boson
decays, led to the discovery of a new particle compatible with the Higgs boson. Taken
from [20].
1.1 Physics at the LHC 27
Searches for phenomena beyond the standard model
Both observations and theoretical arguments suggest that the SM framework is
not complete. A prominent example is the dark matter/dark energy problem:
cosmological observations indicate that the Universe is composed of dark matter
for the 27%, of dark energy for the 68% and of ordinary matter for 5%, where only
the latter is included in the SM framework [25].
Searches for phenomena beyond the SM can be classified into two broad sectors:
those involving supersymmetric particles and those concerning all other hypothet-
ical particles; the latter are generally referred to as exotica. Supersymmetry is
an extension of the SM which is well motivated on theoretical grounds (hierarchy
problem). It introduces a large number of new particles with the same quantum
numbers as their SM partners, but differing in spin by half a unit and larger mass.
Typical examples of exotica are the existence of heavy gauge bosons Z /W  or
excited quark states. A review of supersymmetric and exotica models is found, for
example, in reference [26].
Searches for phenomena beyond the SM with collider data are led by the LHC,
owing to its highest energy collisions. To date, no indications of such phenomena
have been found. However, searches for phenomena beyond the SM will reach
their full exploratory potential in the next decade of LHC operation.
Precision measurements of the standard model
The measurement of W+c production cross section presented in thesis is a precision
measurement of the standard model at the LHC.
The LHC also allows the scrutiny of the SM predictions to an higher energy
scale than previous experiments. An overview of the SM measurements at the LHC
is described, for instance, in reference [27]. By means of precision measurements of
the SM processes it is possible to: (i) constrain the parton distribution functions,
which describe the protons structure; (ii) assess methods to calculate high-order
theoretical predictions for the electroweak and QCD interactions; (iii) test and
tune Monte Carlo generators which are adopted for the calculation of the SM
28 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
predictions. Moreover, as the SM processes constitute the backgrounds for Higgs
measurements and for beyond SM searches, their precise knowledge is crucial for
the success of the LHC research programme.
1.2 The LHC accelerator
The Large Hadron Collider is built on the site of the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research, known as CERN, which operates the worlds largest particle
physics laboratory in Geneva.
The LHC is described in reference [28] and briefly summarised in this section.
This machine has been build primarily to collide two proton beams with nominal
values for the centre of mass energy and instantaneous luminosity of
s = 14 TeV
and L  1034 cm2 s1, respectively, making it the most powerful particle accel-
erator ever built. The LHC also collides lead ion beams at
s = 2.7 TeV per
nucleon and L  1027 cm2 s1. Table 1.1 compares the main parameters of the
LHC and with those of the previous leading hadron collider, the Tevatron. The
latter was a proton-antiproton collider in operation until September 2011 at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Chicago.

1.2 The LHC accelerator 29
depth of 80 m. Before being injected into the LHC itself, the protons undergo
several acceleration stages in an accelerator complex whose scheme is displayed
in figure 1.3.
The pre-LHC accelerator chain is made up of a linear accelerator (LINAC2), the
Booster, the Proton Synchrotron (PS), and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).
This chain accelerates proton beams up to 450 GeV. Inside the LHC, the beams
are accelerated by 8 radio frequency cavities; the latter determine the structure of
the beams as packets of particles which are referred to as bunches. The nominal
time interval between two bunches is 25 ns which corresponds to a bunch crossing
frequency of 40 MHz.
Figure 1.3: Scheme of the LHC accelerator complex. The accelerator chain pre-LHC
includes the LINAC2, Booster, PS and SPS. The displacement of the four main LHC
experiments is also shown: ATLAS and CMS are the two major multi-purpose detec-
tors, while LHCb and ALICE are dedicated to the study of CP-violation and heavy-ion
collisions, respectively. Taken from [29].
30 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
The particle beams are deflected to maintain a circular trajectory by 1232
superconducting magnetic dipoles, cooled with superfluid helium at a temperature
of 1.9 K. The magnets are designed to produce a magnetic field of up to 8.36 T.
Before a bunch crossing, the beams are collimated using a total of about 7000
magnetic quadrupoles. This process reduce the dimensions of the bunches to
maximise the collision probability.
Four main experiments are displaced in underground caverns around the LHC
ring, as shown in figure 1.3. ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) [30] and
CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) [31] are the two major detectors. They are
referred to as multi-purpose experiments, being designed for a broad range of
different studies. Their research programme and capabilities are similar and they
differ in the construction design and detector technologies adopted.
The other two main LHC experiments are LHCb (LHC beauty) [32], for CP-
violation studies in the b-quark sector, and ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experi-
ment) [33], dedicated to the study of heavy ion collisions.
The LHC began to deliver sufficiently stable collisions for physics measure-
ments in December 2009. However, the centre of mass energy and instantaneous
luminosity so far achieved are lower than the nominal design values. A center of
mass energy
s = 7 TeV was reached in 2010 and continued into 2011. In 2012,
s was increased to 8 TeV and ATLAS recorded a maximum instantaneous
luminosity of L = 7.7  1033 cm2 s1. The maximum nominal values of energy
and instantaneous luminosity are foreseen after 2015. During 2013 and 2014 a
LHC shutdown is necessary for machine components upgrade.
To date, the integrated luminosity of the LHC collision data recorded by ATLAS
is 5.08 fb1 at
s = 7 TeV and 21.3 fb1 at
s = 8 TeV. Figure 1.4 shows
the integrated luminosity at
s = 7 TeV as a function of time. The integrated
luminosity recorded by ATLAS is lower than that delivered by the LHC due to data
acquisition inefficiencies. Data quality criteria are also applied to the recorded
data, thereby further reducing the size of the dataset used for physics analyses.
The full dataset at
s = 7 TeV, after data quality criteria are applied, is used
in the W +c production measurement presented in this thesis. This sample corre-

with an uncertainty of 1.8% [34].
1.3 The ATLAS experiment
The ATLAS experiment is the largest particle detector ever built: it has a length of
44 m, a diameter of 25 m and weights approximately 7000 tonnes. The description
of the detector is found in reference [30]; a short summary is presented here.
ATLAS is composed of sub-systems as represented in figure 1.5. Three main
sub-systems can be identified: the inner detector (ID) for tracking of charged
particles, the calorimeters for the energy measurement of electrons, photons and
hadrons, and the muon spectrometer (MS) for muon identification and tracking.
All the sub-detectors are built with a cylindrical central part known as barrel,
enclosed at each end by an end-cap.
The design of ATLAS has been shaped by the magnet system, which is com-
posed of a 2 T central solenoid enclosing the inner detector and three toroids
serving the muon spectrometer. Each of the toroids is build with eight air-core
32 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
coils symmetrically positioned around the z-axis to form a barrel plus end-caps
structure. The toroidal field is 0.5 T and 1 T in the barrel and the end-caps,
respectively. The magnet system is built with superconducting wires made of a
mixture of aluminium, niobium, titanium and copper, and requires an operating
temperature of 4.5 K.
Figure 1.5: Schematic view of the ATLAS detector displaying its sub-system structure.
Three main sub-detectors are identifiable: the inner detector (pixel detector, semicon-
ductor detectors and transition detector tracker) is located at the core, surrounded by
the calorimeters (electromagnetic, hadronic and forward) which is enclosed by the muon
spectrometer. The magnet system is composed by a central solenoid enclosing the inner
detector and three toroids serving the muon spectrometer. Taken from [30].
1.3.1 Coordinate system and kinematic variables definitions
The origin of the ATLAS coordinate system coincides with the nominal point where
the LHC beams undergo a bunch-crossing, which is referred to as the nominal
interaction point (IP). The coordinate system is right-handed, with the x-axis
pointing towards the centre of the LHC ring and the y -axis upwards, as shown
in figure 1.6 (a). ATLAS is nominally symmetric in the positive and negative

Figure 1.6: Coordinate reference system adopted by the ATLAS detector: (a) is the
cartesian reference system and (b) illustrates the relation between the pseudorapidity 
and the polar angle .
In the coordinate system, the azimuthal direction around the z-axis is denoted
by the angle , which ranges from  to  the x-axis being  = 0. The variable
referred to as pseudorapidity,
   ln
, (1.3.1)
is used to identify the direction with respect to the z-axis. In equation 1.3.1, 
is the polar angle, which lies in the range ]0, ] starting from the positive z-axis.
The relation between  and  is illustrated in figure 1.6 (b). The pseudorapidity
and polar angle are used to define the distance in the  space:
()2 + ()2 . (1.3.2)
In an inelastic hadron-hadron collision, two of the partons undergo the scat-
tering interaction. Although the longitudinal momentum, pz , of these partons in
the initial state is unknown, their transverse momentum, pT, perpendicular to the
z-axis, is approximately null. Hence the conservation of energy and momentum
can be exploited only in the transverse plane of the detector and the transverse
momentum and transverse energy, ET, are extensively used in ATLAS. These two
variables are defined as
pT = |pT| =
p2x + p
ET = E sin  .

are defined from the transverse momentum imbalance as

1.3.2 Inner detector
The ID is located at the core of ATLAS surrounding the IP. It is surrounded by
the solenoidal magnet, has a diameter of 2.1 m and a length of 6.2 m which
corresponds to a coverage of || < 2.5. The ID is composed of three sub-detectors
which successively envelope each other as shown in figure 1.7. They are known as
the pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker (SCT) and the transition radiation
tracker (TRT).
Figure 1.7: Scheme of the ATLAS inner detector displaying its three sub-detectors: the
pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker and the transition radiation tracker. Taken
from [30].
The pixel detector has the highest granularity2 and its innermost part lies at
5 cm from the IP. Pixels are silicon sensors which allow a precision on the determi-

1.3 The ATLAS experiment 35
nation of the hit position of 10 m in the r - plane and 115 m in the z direction.
The pixel detector has a total of 80 million read-out channels.
The SCT is composed of silicon micro-strip detectors which provide a resolution
for the measurement of the hit position of 17 m in the r - plane and 580 m in
the z direction.
The TRT is a gaseous detector which, besides tracking, aids with the identi-
fication of electrons. The TRT is made of straw-tubes filled with a Xenon-based
gas mixture and the gaps between these straws are filled by radiator material. A
particle crossing the detector emits transition radiation that contributes to the
identification of the electrons. The TRT coverage in pseudorapidity is || < 2.0
and the measurement of the hit position, available only in the r - plane, has a
resolution of 130 m.
The tracks are reconstructed from the ID measurements by combining the hits
from its three subsystems. The particles momenta are measured with a resolution
of approximately pT/pT = 0.05%  pT  1%, where pT is in GeV. In the formula,
the first term represents the uncertainty on the track curvature while the second
term includes all other effects, which are dominated by multiple scattering within
the detector material.
1.3.3 Calorimeters
The ATLAS calorimetric system encloses the inner detector and covers a region of
|| < 4.9. The calorimeters have a twofold function: (i) to contain and measure the
energy of all the particles interacting electromagnetically and/or strongly except
for muons and neutrinos; (ii) to serve as trigger detectors.
ATLAS employs three calorimeters: electromagnetic (EM), hadronic (HAD)
and forward (FCal), whose scheme is shown in section 1.3.3. All these sub-detectors
are sampling calorimeters, i.e. composed of absorber material interlaid with active
material. The absorber is a dense material with high stopping power, while the
active part measures the energy deposited by the interacting particles.
The EM calorimeter is designed to measure the energy of electrons and photons.
It is composed of lead and stainless steel as the absorbing materials and liquid
36 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
Figure 1.8: Scheme of the ATLAS calorimetric systems composed of the electromag-
netic, hadronic and forward calorimeters. Taken from [30].
argon (LAr) as the active medium. It extends up to || = 3.2 with several active
layers in depth: three in the central region 0 < || < 2.5 and two in the high
pseudorapidity region 2.5 < || < 3.2. In the central region, a more precise
position measurement is obtained by finely segmenting the first layer, closest to the
interaction point. In the region 0 < || < 1.8 the EM calorimeter is complemented
by a presampler consisting of a LAr layer which measures the energy lost due to
the material upstream of the calorimeter.
The energy resolution provided by the EM calorimeter is approximately E/E =
E0.7%, where E is in GeV. In the formula, the first term is the stochastic
uncertainty on the energy measurement and the second term accounts for all other
effects, which are dominated by calibration and detector non-uniformity.
The HAD calorimeter is designed to measure the energy of hadrons. It sur-
rounds the EM calorimeter and extends up to || < 3.2. Iron absorber plates with
plastic scintillating tiles as active medium are used in the central region || < 1.7,
which is known as TileCal. The forward region, 1.7 < || < 3.2, is instrumented
with copper plates and LAr. The energy resolution provided by the HAD calorime-
ter is approximately E/E  50%/
E  3%. The same considerations as per EM
calorimeter are valid for the terms in the relation.
The calorimetry system is completed by a radiation-resistant forward calorime-
1.3 The ATLAS experiment 37
ter covering the region 3.1 < || < 4.9. This detector is divided into three parts
positioned consecutively along the beam pipe. The first part serves as an electro-
magnetic calorimeter with a copper absorber and the other two parts are hadronic
calorimeters with a tungsten absorber. All parts use LAr as the active medium.
The energy resolution of the FCal is lower than that of the HAD calorimeter.
Nonetheless the coverage in  provided by FCal improves the precision of the E missT
measurement.
1.3.4 Muon spectrometer
The MS completes the ATLAS detector. It is designed to track charged particles
exiting the calorimeters, which are nominally only muons. The spectrometer covers
a pseudorapidity range || < 2.7. The MS is also used to trigger on muons in the
region || < 2.4. At   0 there is no MS coverage due to the passage of
the service cables of the ID, solenoid magnet and calorimeters, which provide,
for example, sensors read-out and voltage supplies. The bending power for the
spectrometer is provided by the toroid magnets which deflect the muon trajectories
mostly in the z-direction.
The MS, whose scheme is shown in figure 1.9, includes four types of gaseous
detector chambers with different performance in terms of precision and response
speed, which are accordingly employed for tracking or triggering.
Precision tracking chambers are located in the magnet coils. The pseudorapid-
ity range || < 2.7 is instrumented with monitored drift tube chambers (MDT).
An exception to this is in the innermost layer of the forward region, 2 < || < 2.7,
where cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used due to their higher radiation re-
sistance. The resolution of the measurements provided by the MDT is 80 m,
along the z-axis for the barrel and along the radial direction in the end-caps. The
CSC provides a position resolution of 40 m along the z-axis and approximately
5 mm in the transverse plane. The spectrometer operating in stand-alone mode,
i.e. without the inner detector information, allows transverse momentum measure-
ments ranging, from 3 GeV up to 3 TeV and with a resolution of about 2% for pT
of 50 GeV.
38 The Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment
The resistive plate chambers (RPC) in the barrel || < 1.05 and the thin gap cham-
bers (TGC) in the end-caps 1.05 < || < 2.4 serve as trigger detectors. These
are designed for fast response: the RPCs have a time resolution of 1.5 ns and the
TGCs of 4 ns. Moreover, the RPC and TGC provide the measurement of the muon
coordinate in the direction orthogonal to that determined by the precision tracking
chambers.
Figure 1.9: Scheme of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The MDT and CSC chambers
are used to measure the muons momentum. The TGC and RPC chambers are used as
muon triggers. Taken from [30].
1.3.5 Trigger and data acquisition systems
The ATLAS detector employs a three-level system trigger to select collision events
according to specific pre-defined criteria. The system is made up of the level-1 (L1),
level-2 (L2) and event filter (EF) triggers. Each subsequent level refines the deci-
sions made at the previous stage and, where necessary, applies additional selection
criteria. The ATLAS trigger system reduces the LHC nominal collision rate of
40 MHz down to a rate of 200 Hz, which is the maximum rate at which the data
can written to tape.
The L1 trigger consists of custom-made hardware. It selects events relying
on reduced-granularity information from the calorimeters and the muon trigger
1.3 The ATLAS experiment 39
chambers. The L1-trigger has a maximum latency3 of 2.5 s and a maximum
accept rate of 75 kHz, the latter being limited by the ATLAS sub-systems read-
out electronics. The data from the read-out electronics of each of the ATLAS
sub-detectors are initially stored in buffers at the L1 trigger accept rate. If an
event is selected by the L1 trigger, the collision data recorded by ATLAS are
transferred off the detector to the data acquisition system. The L1 trigger also
identifies the regions of interest (RoIs) of the accepted events. The RoIs are the
 regions in ATLAS where the trigger selection process has identified the event
features matching the selection criteria.
Chapter 2 presents a study of the time stability of a subsystem of the L1
trigger. This analysis has been performed by the author of this thesis as a direct
contribution to the operation and maintenance of the ATLAS detector.
The L2 trigger is based on software algorithms which analyse only data asso-
ciated with the RoIs. At this stage, the trigger system employs the full granularity
information from all the ATLAS sub-detectors. The L2 trigger has an average
latency of 40 ms and further reduces the event accept rate below 5 kHz.
When a collision event is accepted by the L2 trigger, the complete read-out
information from all ATLAS sub-detectors is passed to the event builder module.
Here, the detector information is analysed by the software algorithms of the EF
trigger, which have an average output rate of 200 Hz. The events passing the EF
trigger selection are finally stored to disk.
3The latency is the time the trigger requires to make a decision.

Chapter 2
Time stability study of the L1Calo
trigger calibration
This chapter presents a study of the calibration of the ATLAS level-1 calorimeter
(L1Calo) trigger. Specifically, a set of quantities used for the calibration of the
L1Calo trigger preprocessor is analysed for their systematic variations over time.
Systematic trends over time can highlight problems in the calibration or the func-
tioning of the trigger system. This analysis is part of the studies of the L1Calo
trigger preprocessor performances whose summary is published in [3].
The author of this thesis implemented a procedure to clean data samples
and to evaluate trends over time. This software package has been included in
the L1Calo trigger software framework. The results of the analysis indicate that
systematic trends of the calibration variables considered are generally at a level of
0.1% or smaller.
2.1 ATLAS L1 trigger
The ATLAS three-level trigger system is briefly described in section 1.3.5. The first
level, known as the L1 trigger, is responsible for the initial event selection based
on information from the calorimeters and muon trigger system. The L1 trigger
consists of custom-made electronic modules which are able to withstand the LHC
bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz.
42 Time stability study of the L1Calo trigger calibration
A schematic representation of the L1 trigger and its main components, the
L1 calorimeter trigger, L1 muon (L1Muon) trigger and central trigger processor,
is shown in figure 2.1. The L1Calo and L1Muon triggers receive and process the
analog signals from the respective detectors. The central trigger processor collects
the processed information and, if predefined selection criteria are met, issues the
L1 trigger accept signal.

subsystems, the L1 calorimeter trigger (L1Calo), the L1 muon trigger (L1Muon) and the
central trigger processor. The main components of the L1Calo trigger, the preprocessor,
the cluster processor and the jet/energy processor, are also shown.
The ATLAS calorimeters, which are briefly described in section 1.3.3, have
a total of about 200,000 cells. The L1Calo trigger cannot processes all their
information simultaneously due to the stringent requirements on the L1 trigger
latency. Therefore the analog signals from multiple calorimeter cells are summed
within the detectors front-end electronics to form 7168 analog signals, which are
referred to as trigger towers (TTs) or channels. One TT can be the sum of up
to 60 single calorimetric cells, and has typical dimensions    = 0.1  0.1
which increases in the || > 2.5 region. There are independent TTs for the EM
and the HAD layers of the calorimetric system.
The L1Calo trigger is designed to identify high-ET objects, such as electrons,
photons,  -leptons and jets, and events with large magnitude of ET or E
T . This
task is divided amongst its three main components: the preprocessor (PP), the
2.2 Calibration of the L1Calo trigger preprocessor 43
cluster processor and the jet/energy processor. The TTs analog signals are passed
to the PP to be processed, digitised and converted into GeV units. The results of
the PP are sent in parallel to the cluster and jet/energy processors, which run the
algorithms to identify high-ET objects or values, whose  coordinates constitute
the regions of interest and are transmitted to the L2 trigger.
2.2 Calibration of the L1Calo trigger preprocessor
The pedestals, energy conversion and timing of the PP input analog signals need
to be calibrated. Dedicated data taking runs for this calibration occur on a regular
basis when ATLAS is not operating in physics data acquisition mode. With these
datasets the PP is calibrated and its functioning is monitored.
There are five types of such PP calibration runs, whose description is found in
reference [3]. Three of them, which are referred to as the DAC scans, pedestal
scans and energy scans, respectively, are used in the analysis presented here and
are summarised below. The remaining types of PP calibration runs concern the
timing of the input signals with respect to the LHC bunch crossing.
DAC scans
Digital-to-analog converters (DACs) within the PP produce a voltage level which is
added to the input analog signals of each TT. Such an offset is necessary to ensure
that the analog signals are properly digitised by falling within the linear digitisation
window of the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) present in the PP. Hence, the
pedestal measured by each ADC, i.e. the value it records when there are no input
signals, has a linear dependence from the voltage set in the corresponding DAC.
In a scan, for each of the TTs, the DAC voltage is varied and the ADC pedestal
is measured. From this, the slope and offset of each of the ADC-DAC linear
relationships are evaluated.
These results are used to recalibrate the DAC voltage in each of the TTs so
that the pedestal corresponds to the default value of 32 ADC units 1. In addition,
1In the L1Calo trigger, an input signal of 1 ADC unit corresponds to an energy of 0.25 GeV.
44 Time stability study of the L1Calo trigger calibration
the DAC scans can be used to identify problems, e.g. non-linearity in the ADCs or
DACs response. The DAC scans are performed typically 6 times per month. Since
signals of the TTs are not required in these calibration runs, the inputs of the PP
are disabled to suppress any noise coming from the upstream electronics.
Pedestal scans
The pedestal scans measure the distribution of the pedestal for each of the TTs
(at the default DAC voltage). These calibration runs allow the identification of
problematic channels, which show multi-peaked or broad pedestal distributions.
A pedestal scan is run typically after a DAC scan. Similarly to the DAC scans,
the inputs to the PP are disabled, and a pedestal scan is typically run after the
DAC scan.
Energy scans
The energy scans allow the comparison of the transverse energy measured in the PP
(E L1CaloT ) with that reconstructed from the calorimeters full information (E
The former is used in the online trigger algorithms and the latter, which is more
accurate, in the offline analysis.
Pulse test signals at multiple fixed energies are produced in the calorimeters for
the energy scans. At each of these energy points, measurements are taken in the
PP and the linear relationship between E L1CaloT and E
T is extracted. Consequently,
gain factors are set in the PP modules to adjust E L1CaloT to E
T for each of the
2.3 Study of the time stability
The time stability of the PP calibration is studied because it can highlight problems
in the calibration or functioning of this trigger system. The systematic variation
over time of five variables, which are referred to as attributes, is studied using
data of calibration runs described above. The five attributes are: (i) the slope and
the offset of the linear relationship between pedestal and DAC voltage extracted
2.3 Study of the time stability 45
from the DAC scans; (ii) the mean of the pedestal distribution measured in the
pedestal scans; (iii) the slope and the offset of the E L1CaloT E
T linear relationship
evaluated in the energy scans. The L1Calo PP calibration data taken in 2012 are
considered.
A software package, which is referred to as calibtools, has been developed by
the author within the L1Calo software framework. The calibtools algorithm takes
as input a set of attributes and a time interval, retrieves the selected dataset from
the L1Calo calibration database and executes the analysis described below, which
is described for the case of the pedestal mean data.
2.3.1 Time series and residuals
The time series of a channel c , xc(t), is an attributes value measured at the
trigger tower c as a function of time. Each point in the time series corresponds to
the calibration run at time t. The time average of the channel c is calculated as
xc(t) , (2.3.1)
where N is the number of points in the time series. The residual of the channel c
at the time t,
resc(t) =
xc(t) xc
, (2.3.2)
evaluates the variation of the attributes value relative to the time average for the
channel considered. A check of the data consistency is executed by calibtools and
dead channels registering xc = 0 are excluded.
An example of a time series is shown in figure 2.2. The values of xc(t) at all
time steps are close to the expected value of 32 ADC counts; the time average,
xc , results 32.3 ADC counts.
The distribution across all channels of xc and of the time series root mean
square (RMS), maximum and minimum values are evaluated by calibtools. Exam-
ples are shown in figure 2.3 for the pedestal mean analysis. The x-axis range of
each histogram corresponds exactly to the measured range. For example, in fig-
ure 2.3 (a) the channels with the smallest and the largest xc measure approximately
17 and 34 ADC counts, respectively.

Figure 2.2: Example of a channel time series for the analysis of the pedestal mean data.
The time average, xc , is displayed by the line.
The same distributions are also plotted in  maps of the TT coordinates in
the calorimeter. Two sets of maps are produced, for the calorimeters EM and the
HAD layers, respectively. An example of the EM layer maps for the pedestal mean
analysis is shown in figure 2.4. The xc values and those of the time series RMS,
maximum and minimum values are generally uniformly distributed in  and only
a few outlier values are present.
The varying granularity of the TTs is also visible in the  maps. The chan-
nels  size in the || < 2.5 and the 2.5 < || < 3.2 regions is 0.10.1 and
0.2 0.2, respectively. In the forward region 3.2 < || < 4.9, where FCal operates
as described in section 1.3.3, the dimensions of a TT are  = 0.4 0.4.
2.3.2 Average residuals and data cleaning
The average residuals across all channels,
res(t) =
Nc(t)
Nc (t)
resc(t) , (2.3.3)
evaluate the average variation at time t of each channel value relative to its xc .
The number of channels which have a measurement at t, Nc(t), is a time de-
pendent variable. In fact, temporary failures might occur in the measurement of
an attribute, due, for instance, to malfunctioning of the electronic modules of a

The average residuals are used to identify possible systematic shifts of the
attribute value over time. Figure 2.5 shows the res(t) as a function of time which
is obtained from the pedestal mean analysis. A linear regression using the line
res(t) = a0 + a1

(2.3.4)
is calculated, where tN  t1 is the interval corresponding to the analysed time
series. 2 The slope of the regression line is taken as the magnitude of the attributes
systematic variation over the time interval considered. For instance, the systematic
variation of the pedestal mean value shown in figure 2.5 is 0.22%.

The slope of the regression line indicates the magnitude of the attributes systematic
variation over the time interval analysed. All points before the data cleaning procedure
explained in the text are considered.
A single calibration run might measure a large average residual due to only few
single points of the times series. The example in figure 2.5 shows few points with
res(t) at percent level, while the majority of points have res(t)  103. Single
measurements with large residuals might occur, for example, due to malfunctioning
or human mistake in the calibration runs.
2The regression line coefficients calculated with least squares are a1 = Cov (res(t), t) /Var(t)
and a0 = res(t)  a1t, where the operators  , Cov() and Var() indicate the sample mean,
covariance and variance, respectively.
50 Time stability study of the L1Calo trigger calibration
A data cleaning procedure is applied in the analysis to reject the outlier points
of the res(t) distribution,
res(t) 6 [m  ] , (2.3.5)
where m and  measure the distributions peak and width, respectively.
The value m is taken to be the distributions mode, i.e. the central value of
the bin with the largest number of entries in the res(t) histogram. The width is
calculated as  = u  wbin, where wbin is the width of the bins in res(t) histogram
and u is a defined number of such bins. The values of u and wbin are user defined
inputs in calibtools, which can be used to control sensitivity and magnitude of
the data cleaning executed by the program. A different evaluation of the outlier
points was attempted, with m and  set to the mean and the RMS of the res(t)
distribution, respectively. This alternative method generally does not work because
the mean and RMS values are sensitive and hence pulled to the outlier points.
As an example, in figure 2.6 the res(t) distribution is shown (a) before and (b)
after the data cleaning, for the pedestal mean analysis. The values of m and 
are displayed with lines, and the shaded area encompasses the resulting 4 outlier
points.
Calibtools repeats the entire calculation of the average residuals after executing
the data cleaning procedure, and the resulting regression line is taken as the analysis
final result. Figure 2.7 shows the values of res(t) as a function of time for the
analysis of the pedestal mean, after the exclusion of the outlier points in figure 2.5.
The regression line after data cleaning gives a systematic variation of the pedestal
mean value of 0.19%.
The final results of the analysis are considered after data cleaning because
this procedure can change the evaluated systematic variation by many orders of
magnitude. For instance, in the analysis of the slope measured from the DAC scans,
the linear regression slope coefficient before and after this procedure is -0.067 and
1.5108, respectively, as shown in figure 2.8.

The final results obtained for the pedestal mean, and for the slope and the offset
measured in the DAC scans, are presented in figures 2.7, 2.8 (b) and 2.9, respec-
tively. The systematic variation of these attributes evaluated from the 2012 PP
calibration runs data is at the order 103 or less. This magnitude of systematic
trend has a negligible effect on the performance of the ATLAS trigger system and
can be associated, for example, to changes in the environmental conditions of the
ATLAS cavern or to ageing effects in hardware modules.

calorimetric systems with liquid argon. The time values are measured by run num-

Chapter 3
W+c production and
measurement strategy
This chapter introduces the measurement of the production of a W boson with a
single charm quark. First, the general calculation of the cross section for a process
produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions is outlined and then the W+c production
processes are explained.
The main motivation for the measurement of the W + c production is the
sensitivity to the parton density function of the strange quark. This distribution is
poorly known from existing data and its accurate determination will improve the
description of the proton structure. This process is also a relevant background to
studies at the LHC, such as top quark measurements and beyond the SM searches;
furthermore, it provides a test of the current theoretical predictions in perturbative
Finally, the strategy adopted in the measurement of this thesis is explained.
The analysis is based on the charm quark identification technique known as soft
muon tagging. To select the signal with high-purity from data, the anti-correlation
of the W boson and charm quark charges is exploited. A list of the background
processes to the signal selection concludes the chapter.
58 W +c production and measurement strategy
3.1 Production cross sections in pp collisions
The proton is described in the standard model as a bound state of three valence
quarks, two up quarks and one down quark, held together by the strong interaction.
Gluons and other quarks, which are collectively known as sea partons, are produced
in the proton as a result of the valence quarks interaction.
Each of the valence quarks and sea partons carries a fraction of the proton
momentum. The probability density of finding a parton of type i , carrying a
fraction of the protons longitudinal momentum x , in interactions at an energy
scale, or momentum transfer, Q, is known as the parton density function (PDF),
fi(x , Q
2). The PDFs represent the knowledge of the composite structure of the
proton and are therefore a crucial element in the theoretical description of the pp
collisions.
Most of the studies with pp collision data rely on hard scattering events, i.e.
those in which at least one parton-parton interaction between the two incoming
protons occurs with a high momentum transfer, for instance Q  10 GeV or
larger. In such events, the hard interaction can be considered and evaluated as
independent from the remaining partons in the two protons, which are referred to
as spectator partons.
The hard scattering partons may radiate gluons or photons, both before and
after the interaction, phenomena which are known as initial and final state radiation
(ISR, FSR), respectively. The spectators may also produce additional radiation,
or undergo further interactions. However, such processes are at a lower, or soft,
energy scale and are collectively referred to as the underlying event.
The production cross section measures the likelihood of a process to occur in
the scattering events considered. The cross section of the collision of two protons
A and B , in which a hard scattering process produces the final state c , is calculated
A+Bc+X =
fa/A(xa, Q
2) fb/B(xb, Q
2)  a+bc
, (3.1.1)
where X indicates the other products of the collision. In equation 3.1.1, the PDFs
of the partons a and b belonging to the proton A and B , respectively, are convolved
3.1 Production cross sections in pp collisions 59
with the cross section of the partonic processes a + b  c , a+bc , according to
the QCD factorisation theorem [36].
The partonic cross section is evaluated in perturbative QCD as an expansion
in terms of the QCD running coupling S(Q
a+b c = [ 0 + S(Q
2)  1 + 2S(Q
2)  2 + ... ]a+bc . (3.1.2)
The first term of the expansion, 0, is known as the leading order (LO) cross
section; the first two terms collectively as the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross
section, and so forth.
The mathematical computation of A+Bc+X requires the introduction of two
parameters which are known as the factorisation scale, F , and the renormalisa-
tion scale, R . The former indicates the energy scale which separates the parton
radiation accounted for either in the PDFs or in the partonic cross section; the
latter fixes the value of the QCD running coupling [36].
If calculated to all orders in S(Q
2), the cross section A+Bc+X is invariant
with respect to the choice of values for F and R . However, only the computation
of the first few of terms in equation 3.1.2 is possible1. Hence, the theoretical
prediction for A+Bc+X is calculated after truncating the series, e.g. at NLO,
and therefore depends on the particular choice of F and R . The chosen values
of the QCD scales are of the order of the hard scattering momentum transfer,
F  R  Q, [36].
The PDFs cannot be calculated directly from QCD and their parametrisation is
determined from measured cross sections and from the DGLAP equations [3739].
The latter describe the evolution of a PDF with respect to Q.
The PDF for a given parton, or a linear combination thereof, is parametrised
as a function of x at a starting value of the energy scale, Q0  1 GeV. This PDF
is first evolved via the DGLAP equations to the Q of a measured cross section and
then convolved with the associated partonic cross sections as per equation 3.1.1.
1The inclusive NLO cross section is available for most of the processes studied at the LHC. The
full calculation at next-to-next-to-leading order, i.e. up to the 2S(Q
2)2 term of equation 3.1.2,
is achieved for a few specific processes, such as the Drell-Yan lepton pair production.
60 W +c production and measurement strategy
From the comparison of the predicted and the measured cross sections, information
can be extracted about the parameters of the PDF considered.
The analysis is expanded to include multiple measurements and various PDFs,
and PDF set is obtained from a global fit to the data. Various PDF sets are
available, which generally differ in the choice of the PDFs parametrisation and in
the data included in the global fit.
3.2 W+c production in pp collisions
The production of a W boson in association with a single charm quark in pp
collisions is the process p + p  W + c + X 2, where X indicates all the other
particles in the final state.
The partonic process is described at LO in perturbative QCD by the scattering
of a gluon off a down-type quark (u-, s- and b-quark). The LO diagrams for the
t-channel and the s-channel are drawn in figures 3.1 (a) and (c) for the W+
c production, and in figures 3.1 (b) and (d) for the W + + c production. The
contribution of each of the three down-type quarks to the initial state is determined
by the relative PDF and by the elements of the CKM matrix, |Vcd |, |Vcs | and |Vcb|.
The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix arises in the standard model
because the weak interaction allows the quark-mixing, that is the decay of one
quark i to another quark j belonging to a different generation. In quantum field
theory this is included with quarks weak interaction eigenstates which are not the
same as the quarks mass eigenstates. Through the CKM matrix, the weak inter-
action eigenstates of the down-type quarks are expressed as a linear combination
of mass eigenstates. The magnitude of CKM matrix elements, |Vij |, describes the
probability of the weak decay i  j . The partonic cross section of the decay is
proportional to |Vij |2.
The s-quark initiated production, g + s  W + c , is the dominant process
and has been shown to account for approximately 90% of the total LO W + c
2When the W boson charge is not specified both the W+c and W+ +c processes are
considered.

production at the LHC [40]. This is due to large value of the corresponding matrix
element, |Vcs |2 = 1.012.
The remaining 10% is due to the d-quark initiated contribution, g + d 
W + c , which despite being enhanced by the larger d-quark PDF, is suppressed by
|Vcd |2 = 0.053. In fact, in the kinematical regime of the measurement, x  0.01
and Q2  104 GeV2, the ratio of the strange and down PDFs is about 0.5. The
b-quark contribution is negligible because of both the suppression from the small
b-quark PDF and |Vcb|2 = 0.002.
In perturbative QCD, a NLO correction of about 30% is calculated in [41] to the
W +c production cross section at LO. The QCD NLO diagrams can be subdivided
into three categories. The first category, whose examples are illustrated in figures
3.2 (a) and (b), encompasses the emissions of virtual and real gluons in the LO
62 W +c production and measurement strategy
processes. The second category includes the processes initiated by two gluons,
g + g  (s/d) + W + c , for which a diagram is displayed in figure 3.2 (c). The
last category, for which an example is shown in figure 3.2 (d), accounts for the
processes initiated by two quarks, q + q()  q + W + c , where q indicates either
a valence or a sea (anti)-quark in the proton.

Table 3.1 shows the contributions to the W +c production subdivided by the
types of the two partons initiating the scattering. The fractions of events are
evaluated with the W +c simulated sample and the selection criteria described in
section 4.3 and section 4.2, respectively. The partonic processes sensitive to the
s-quark PDFs are the subprocesses g + (s/s) and q + (s/s), which correspond to
approximately 80% of the total W +c production at the LHC with
s = 7 TeV.

processes generating a W boson and a c-quark pair can also occur, but these are
not measured with the strategy adopted in this thesis, as explained in section 3.5.
3.3 Motivations for the W+c production mea-
surement
The main motivation to study the W +c production is its sensitivity to the s-quark
PDFs, s(x) and s(x). PDFs play a fundamental role at hadron colliders as they
relate theoretically calculated partonic cross sections with measured cross sections.
In fact, the understanding of the PDFs is a potential source of uncertainty for the
vast majority of the studies at the LHC, such as Higgs measurements.
The s-quark PDFs suffer from large uncertainties because of the lack of mea-
surements to constrain them in the PDF fits. A review of the strange content of
the proton can be found in e.g. [42]; a brief summary is presented here.
Initially, the s(x) = s(x) = 
u(x) + d(x)
/2 parametrisation was the com-
mon choice in PDF analyses, where u(x) and d(x) indicate the u- and d-quark
PDF, respectively. This relation reflected the lack of measurements directly sen-
sitive to the strange content of the proton. The functions s(x) and s(x) were
evaluated from the better-determined u(x) and d(x) and no asymmetry between
64 W +c production and measurement strategy
them was considered. A value   0.5 at Q20  1 GeV
2 was set to suppress the
strange content of the proton. This was theoretically motivated owing to the larger
mass of the s-quark with respect to that of the u- and d-quarks.
Recent PDF analyses typically use parametrisations of the s-quark PDFs which
do not depend on u(x) and d(x), and also might consider that s(x) 6= s(x).
This was made possible after the measurements sensitive to both s(x) and s(x)
performed by the NuTeV [43,44] and CCRF [45] experiments. These data provide
important constraints to the s-quark PDFs in the region with Q2  10 GeV2 and
x  0.1.
The NuTeV and CCRF experiments measured di-muon production from the
deep inelastic scattering (DIS) process (/) + N  + +  + X , where N
indicates a nucleon (proton or neutron). Neutrino beams were directed at an
iron target to produce the scattering. The diagram of this neutrino-nucleon DIS
processes is shown in figure 3.3. For the reasons explained in section 3.2, this
reaction proceeds primarily through the W +s  c and Ws  c subprocesses
and, hence, allows probing individually s(x) and s(x). One muon originates from
the weak interaction of the neutrino with the nucleon; the second muon, which
carries opposite charge, stems from the semileptonic decay of the charm quark.
Figure 3.3: Diagram of the neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering processes mea-
sured by the NuTeV and CCRF experiments. Di-muon events are produced: one
muon originates from the neutrinos weak interaction with the nucleon; a second muon,
with opposite charge, is produced in the semileptonic decay of a charm quark. Taken
from [44].
However, recent PDF analyses have shown sizeable differences in the size and
3.3 Motivations for the W+c production measurement 65
the asymmetry of the s-quark PDF, indicating that the neutrino-nucleon DIS
data do not provide enough constraint on the strange content of the proton.
This can be seen in figure 3.4, which compares the s-quark PDF obtained in
six PDF sets: MSTW2008 [46], HERAPDF1.5 [47], CT10 [48], NNPDF2.3 and
NNPDF2.3coll [49], and ATLAS-epWZ12 [50]. The uncertainty bands have been
calculated according to the prescriptions from each PDF analysis.
The different size of the s-quark PDF can be seen in figure 3.4 (a), where the
PDF ratio s(x)/d(x) is shown as a function of x . In the region between 103 and
101, which is relevant for the W +c measurement presented in this thesis, the
MSTW2008 (brown) and NNPDF2.3 (red) analyses obtain a suppressed s-quark
sea with respect to the d-quark sea. A similar but smaller suppression is found
in the HERAPDF1.5 (black) and CT10 (grey) results. The ATLAS-epWZ12 and
NNPDF2.3coll analyses use exclusively collider data, so that the neutrino-nucleon
DIS measurements are excluded. These two PDF sets have more symmetric compo-
sition of the light-quark sea, which is suggested by flavour symmetry of the strong
interaction. The ATLAS-epWZ12 analysis (blue), which combines an ATLAS mea-
surement of the W and Z bosons cross section with electron-proton DIS data from
the HERA collider, fixes s(x)  d(x). The NNPDF2.3coll analysis (yellow), which
includes data from the HERA, the Tevatron and the LHC, obtains an s-quark
component that can be slightly larger than that of the d-quark.
Figure 3.4 (b) show the ratio s(x) over s(x) as obtained from the six PDF
analyses. In the CT10, HERAPDF1.5 and ATLAS-epWZ12 analyses, the ratio is
fixed to unity, s(x)  s(x). The MSTW2008, NNPDF2.3and NNPDF2.3coll PDF
sets allow a small strange PDF asymmetry, with s(x) few percent larger than s(x)
for x  102. Such an asymmetry is suggested by results of the NuTeV and CCFR
experiments; however, the hypothesis of symmetric s(x) and s(x) is not ruled out,
as explained, for example, in [51].
The possibility of using measurements of the W + c production to further
constrain the strange content of the proton has long been discussed for the Teva-
tron [52] and for the LHC [40]. The W +c production allows to probe the s-quark
PDFs in a region with momentum transfer Q2  104 GeV2 and momentum frac-

tion x  0.01. This kinematical regime is different from the neutrino-nucleon DIS
data; hence, by means of including the W +c production in the PDF fits, a more
accurate determination of the s-quark PDFs can be achieved.
The W +c production was measured with a precision of 2030% at the Teva-
tron collider [5355], but recent PDF analyses typically do not include these results.
Due to the sizeable measurement uncertainties, the Tevatron W +c measurements
do not add a significant amount of constraint to the global PDF fits. The larger
W +c production rates available at the LHC offer the first opportunity to measure
this process with enough precision to constrain the s-quark PDFs. Measurements
of the W + c production cross section at the LHC were performed recently by
CMS [56] and ATLAS [1], the latter containing the analysis of this thesis.
Two other motivations support the study of the W + c production. Firstly,
this process can be a sizeable background for LHC measurements which involve
heavy quarks (charm, bottom and top) and E missT in the final state. Particularly
relevant cases are top quark studies and beyond the SM searches of, for example,
squarks of the third-generation. Secondly, the comparison of the W + c cross
section measured at the LHC with the current NLO predictions offers a unique
test of the perturbative QCD calculations performed by the latest MC generators.
3.4 Strategy for the W+c production measure-
In the measurement of the W +c production, the W bosons are identified via the
leptonic decay into muons or electrons: W  l , where l = , e. The c-quark
can be identified either by the semileptonic decay c  l  q, where q indicates a
down-type quark, or via the reconstruction of a c-hadron decay, e.g. D  K.
The analysis presented in this thesis uses both the W boson and the c-quark
decays into muons, whose branching ratios are BR(W  ) = 0.1057 0.0015
and BR(c  q) = 0.096 0.004 [57]. The corresponding ATLAS analyses us-
ing the electron channel of the W boson decay and that exploiting the reconstruc-
tion of c-hadrons decays are reported in [1]. Electron channel decays were also
68 W +c production and measurement strategy
used to tag the c-quark at the Tevatron collider [54].
The muons originating from the W    and c    q decays are referred
to as W-decay muon and soft muon, respectively. The latter owes its name to the
softer energy spectrum with respect to that of a W boson decay. In the W +c
production, the W boson and the c-quark carry opposite sign charge, W+ c
and W ++c ; consequently the W -decay and soft muons have opposite charge, as
highlighted in figure 3.5.
SMT jet

W -muon
Figure 3.5: Diagram of the decays used to identify the W +c events in the analysis
of this thesis. The W -decay and the soft muons always carry opposite charge. The
c-quark is identified with the soft muon tagging (SMT) method, i.e. by the presence of
a soft muon within the jet, which is reconstructed from the quarks hadronisation.
The identification of a soft muon within a jet is used as the experimental
signature of a c-quark. Jets are collimated bunches of particles reconstructed in the
detectors which result from the hadronisation of quarks and gluons. The presence
of a soft muon is one of the methods used to identify the heavy-flavour jets, which
originate from c- or b-quarks. This method is known as soft muon tagging (SMT)
and so an identified jet is referred to as an SMT-jet. The definition of reconstructed
jets and the description of the SMT algorithm used for this analysis are given in
section 4.2.2.
3.4 Strategy for the W+c production measurement 69
By exploiting the charge anti-correlation between the W boson and the soft
muon, the W + c production signal can be extracted with high efficiency from
collision events data. The fraction of opposite sign (OS) events predicted at
detector level for the W +c production is found to be 0.924 0.004. The detector
level event selections are described in section 4.2. The remaining 7.6% of W +
c events is reconstructed as same sign (SS) events and is mainly due to the
misidentifications of the soft muon. At particle level, in the fiducial region defined
in section 7.1, the fraction of SS events has been found to be smaller than 1% and
is due to c-quarks produced by gluon splittings or the underlying event. Therefore,
to a first approximation, the yield of the W +c production can be estimated as
the number of OS events selected from data, NOSdata.
Furthermore, the relative sign of the W boson and the soft muon charges is
exploited to extract the W +c signal with high purity. The background processes
produce events in large part symmetrically distributed between the OS and SS
categories, as explained in section 3.5. Consequently, the largest part of the back-
ground contribution to NOSdata can be estimated by the number of SS events selected
from data, NSSdata. To a second approximation, the W +c production yield can be
evaluated from the selected data event sample after the OSSS subtraction,

Finally, the OS/SS asymmetric background contribution, NOSSSbkg , is subtracted to

where L and U are the integrated luminosity of the data sample and the unfolding
factor correction, respectively, which are described in section 4.1 and section 7.1.
In addition, the cross section is also measured differentially as a function of
the W -decay muon pseudorapidity. The integrated and differential measurements
are performed separately for events with a positively and a negatively charged W
boson, and the ratio
RW+c  (W

70 W +c production and measurement strategy
is also measured. All measurements are compared to predictions of NLO QCD
calculations obtained with various PDF sets and the sensitivity to the choice of
PDFs is presented in chapter 7.
3.5 Backgrounds to the W+c production mea-
surement
The background processes are those that contribute to the sample of signal candi-
date events which is selected from data. In the case of the W +c production, the
background processes are those that can produce either real or fake W   
decays and SMT-jets. However, such processes are only relevant if they present
OSSS asymmetry and, hence, contribute to the NOSSSbkg term in equation 3.4.2.
The potential background processes to the W + c production are described
below:
W + cc and W + bb. These processes refer to the production a W boson in
association with a pair of c- or b-quarks, for which an example diagram is shown in
figure 3.6 (a). Similarly to c-quarks, b-quarks can decay semileptonically producing
a soft muon. The W +cc and W +bb productions have a similar signature to that
of the W +c production; however, they are expected to be OSSS symmetric. In
fact, there is an equal probability that the jet originating from either the quark or
the antiquark is identified by the SMT algorithm. Therefore there is no expected
charge correlation between the W boson and the soft muon.
W+light. This refers to the production of a W boson in association with light-
flavour jets, i.e. those originating from the hadronisation of a light quark (up,
down and strange) or a gluon. The soft muon from a c- or b-quark is faked by
muons which might be produced, for example, in the decays of pions and kaons.
The W +light production is expected to present some OS/SS asymmetry due to
the processes such as, for instance, g + u  W +d , whose diagram is displayed in
figure 3.6 (b). In this example, the W boson and the d-quark carry opposite sign
3.5 Backgrounds to the W+c production measurement 71
charges. Owing to charge conservation among the quarks hadronisation products,
there is a higher probability that the misidentified soft muon carries same charge
sign of the d-quark and, hence, an OS event is produced.
Z+jets. This refers to the production of a Z/ decay into a pair of electrons,
muons or  -leptons, which can occur in association with jets. For this thesis, the
most relevant Z +jets background source is Z  + 3. The muons from the Z
decay can (i) be falsely reconstructed as a W boson decay if missing energy is also
present; (ii) fake the SMT signature if they emit photons leading to a mistakenly
reconstructed jet or they are accidentally associated with a jet. Owing to the
production of two oppositely charged muons, the Z +jets production is expected
to be OS/SS asymmetric.
Multijet. This refers to the QCD mediated scatterings producing jets in the final
state. For the analysis in this thesis, the most relevant multijet background source
is the production of c- and of b-quark pairs, cc and bb, for which an example
diagram is shown in figure 3.6 (c). The W boson decay might be misreconstructed
from a muon and a neutrino produced in a semileptonic decay of the c- or b-quarks.
The cc and bb production are expected to present some OS/SS asymmetry, as
the quark and the antiquark carry opposite charges. Due to charge conservation
in the quarks hadronisation processes, the misidentified W -decay muon is more
likely to carry same charge sign of the original (anti)-quark, and, hence, give an
OS event.
Top quark. This refers collectively to the production of t-quark pairs, tt, and
of single t-quarks. Since a t-quark decays into a W boson and a b-quark, these
processes can produce a similar signature to that of the W+c production. Owing to
the charge correlation between the W boson and b-quark, the top quark production
is expected to present some OS/SS asymmetry.
3When referring to the Z boson production or decay, both the Z boson and the  processes
are included.
72 W +c production and measurement strategy
Diboson. This refers to the production of the ZZ , ZW and W +W boson pairs,
which can occur in association with jets. An example diagram for the W +W
production is shown in figure 3.6 (d). This process is expected to be OS/SS
asymmetric if, for instance, the final state contains a W boson with an oppositely
charged c-quark, W + W  W + cs.

Datasets and analysis selections
This chapter describes the datasets of collision events used for the analysis of this
thesis. First, the data sample of LHC collision events is described. Then, the
event selection criteria and physics objects used for the signal events are specified.
Finally, the datasets obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of the W+c production
and of the background processes are presented.
The author of this thesis has implemented his own algorithms to select the
event samples for the analysis. These algorithms were interfaced with software
packages used to calibrate the physics objects and correct the MC simulations.
These packages were typically provided by ATLAS performance analysis groups.
Specifically, the SMT algorithm was implemented in a software package entirely
by the author of this thesis, who has also collaborated in the study of the SMT
calibration reported in [5].
4.1 LHC data sample
The analysis of this thesis is based on the LHC collision data collected by the
ATLAS detector during 2011. The centre of mass energy of the pp collisions was
s = 7 TeV. The datasets integrated luminosity is
Ldt = 4.58 fb1, measured
with an uncertainty of 1.8% [34]. The data sample corresponds to the order of
1014 collision events in the LHC.
The data have been verified to be of good quality for physics measurements by
74 Datasets and analysis selections
applying requirements provided by the ATLAS data quality group. Such require-
ments ensure a stable conditions and the correct operating of the relevant ATLAS
components during data taking.
4.2 Event selections and physics object definitions
The identification of a W    decay requires exactly one isolated, high-pT
muon and large E missT stemming from the neutrino. For the selection of the W +c
production process, events with exactly one or exactly two jets are kept, and
exactly one of these jets is identified as originating from a c-quark, with the SMT
algorithm.
The event selection criteria adopted are listed in table 4.1 and explained, with
the physics object definitions, in sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.2. The number of events
counted in the data sample and the W +c Monte Carlo (MC) simulated sample
after applying each of the detector level selection steps is shown in the table.
In the data, the number of events selected by the trigger is approximately 170
million, which is reduced to 17,366 after applying all the selection criteria. The sim-
ulated datasets for the W +c signal and background processes, whose descriptions
are found in section 4.3, are obtained with the same event selection requirements
applied to the data. In the W +c sample, the number of simulated events1 passing
the trigger requirement is approximately 2.2 million, which is reduced to 13,897
after applying all the selection criteria.
4.2.1 Trigger and interaction vertex selections
The collision events are selected with an EF trigger requiring the identification of
a muon with pT > 18 GeV. Using Z   data events, the trigger efficiency
has been evaluated as function of the muon pT and separately for the barrel and
endcap regions [58]. The trigger efficiency has been found to be approximately
70% and 90% in the barrel and endcap, respectively, approximately constant with

respect to the muon pT. The trigger is available in the simulated events, where
the trigger efficiency is corrected to match that measured in data.
The rejection of events not associated with pp collisions, such as those resulting
from background radiation in the ATLAS cavern or from cosmic rays, is achieved
by requiring at least one interaction vertex, reconstructed with at least five tracks
each with pT > 0.4 GeV. If an event has multiple reconstructed vertices, the one
with the largest
p2T, where the sum runs over all the tracks associated with
the vertex, is defined as the primary vertex originating from the hard scattering
process.
4.2.2 W +jets selections
Muon. The W -decay muon candidates are selected with the following criteria.
76 Datasets and analysis selections
 Reconstructed as a combined muon, i.e. by matching a track measured by
the MS with a track identified in the ID [59].
 Compliance with the track quality criteria, requiring at least 6 SCT hits and
a hit in the innermost layer of the pixel detector unless the track passes
through a region in which no hit is expected. Tracks with more than one
missing pixel or SCT hit are discarded.
 Matching the muon identified by the trigger within R < 0.15.
 Reconstructed as an isolated muon. The track isolation variable is defined as
the sum of the pT of the tracks reconstructed within a R = 0.3 cone around
the muon: Itrack =
R<0.3 p
tracks
T . Similarly, the energy of the calorimeter
cells not associated with muon radiation within a R = 0.2 cone is defined
as calorimeter isolation, Icalo =
R<0.2 E
cells
T . An isolated muon is required
to measure Itrack < 2.5 GeV and Icalo < 4 GeV. Furthermore, the W -decay
muon candidate must be separated by R > 0.4 from any selected jet.
 Reconstructed with pT > 20 GeV and || < 2.5.
In the simulated samples, the efficiencies of the reconstruction and the isolation
requirement, and the energy scale and resolution of the W -decay muon candidates,
are corrected to match those measured in data by the ATLAS muon performance
group.
Electrons. Events with a W -decay muon candidate are discarded if they contain
high-pT, isolated electrons, which are defined with the following criteria.
 Reconstructed by matching a calorimeter cluster with a track [60]. Calorime-
ter clusters are collections of neighbouring calorimeter cells measuring an
energy significantly above the expected detector noise [61].
 Compliance with the tight quality criteria recommended by the ATLAS
e/ performance group, which are based on: the calorimeter cluster shape,
track quality, track-to-calorimeter-cluster matching, particle identification
information from the TRT and photon conversion veto.
4.2 Event selections and physics object definitions 77
 Reconstructed as isolated electrons with both track and calorimeter isolation
required to be smaller than 3 GeV.
 Reconstructed with ET > 25 GeV and || < 2.47 excluding the region 1.37 <
|| < 1.52. This region is not instrumented due to the transition between the
EM calorimeter barrel and endcap. The electron energy scale is calibrated
from Z  ee data [62]. In the simulated samples, the energy resolution of
the veto electron candidates is corrected to match those measured in data
by the ATLAS e/ performance group.
Jets. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm [63] with radius
parameter R = 0.4. The algorithm is an iterative procedure starting with the
identification of pseudo-jets, which correspond to calorimeter clusters and to
particle four-momenta for the data and the simulated samples, respectively.
First, the distances di = 1/k
t,i and di ,j = min
1/k2t,i , 1/k
 (Ri ,j/R)2 are
calculated, where i , j run over the pseudo-jets and kt is their transverse momentum.
If the smallest distance is di , the i -th pseudo-jet is identified as a jet and removed
from the list of pseudo-jets; conversely, if the smallest distance is di ,j , the i -th
and j-th pseudo-jets are removed and recombined into a single pseudo-jet. The
iterative procedure ends when no pseudo-jets are left.
The energy of the reconstructed jets is calibrated with the scheme known as
EM+JES scale [64]. The EM scale calibrates the calorimeter response to the
energy deposited by electromagnetic showers, which are measured from Z  ee
data. Consequently, the jet energy scale (JES) is applied to correct the measured
jets energy to be as close as possible to that of the particle-level jet. This correction
accounts for effects such as the calorimeter response to hadronic interactions of
the jets particles, pileup contamination and the jets particles leaking from the
calorimeters.
The JES is mainly estimated from simulations, by means of comparing the
energy of calorimeter jets with that of the corresponding truth-jets. The latter are
reconstructed from the stable particles, i.e. are those with an expected lifetime
longer than 10 ps, present in the final state of a simulated event.
78 Datasets and analysis selections
Jet which are reconstructed within R < 0.2 from an electron are removed.
A further requirement is applied to remove jets stemming from pileup. The tracks
reconstructed within a jet are used to calculate the jet vertex fraction (JVF). This
variable is defined as the pT sum of the jets tracks associated with the primary
vertex, divided by the pT sum of all the jets tracks. The JVF of the selected jets
is required to be larger than 0.75.
Finally, the event selection of this analysis requires at most two jets recon-
structed with pT > 25 GeV and || < 2.5.
Missing Transverse Energy. The E missT is calculated from calorimeter cells and
reconstructed muons as described in reference [65]:
E missx,y = E
x,y + E
muons
x,y + E
 -leptons
x,y + E

soft-jets

(4.2.1)
The E
x,y term accounts for the energy of reconstructed electron and photons. The
muon term includes possible energy deposits in the calorimeter due to reconstructed
muons. The E jetsx,y and E
soft-jets
x,y terms include jets reconstructed with pT > 20 GeV
and 7 GeV < pT < 20 GeV, respectively. The E
cells-out
x,y term encompasses all the
remaining calorimeter cells, which are not associated with any physics object.
Two quality criteria from the ATLAS jet/E missT performance group are ap-
plied to the E missT calculation. An event containing a jet identified from the non-
collision background processes is rejected [66]. Such processes include cosmic
muons, calorimeter detector noise, interactions of the colliding protons with gas
molecules or components of the LHC beam pipes. In addition, events with a jet
reconstructed in the  region referred to as the LAr hole, 0 <  < 1.5 and
0.8 <  < 0.6, are removed. During part of the 2011 data taking, this region
of the ATLAS calorimeter was affected by damaged readout electronics.
The E missT resolution depends on the precision of the Ex,y terms in equa-
tion 4.2.1. Hence, it depends on total transverse energy deposited in the detector
by collision event, ET

W boson transverse mass. The transverse mass of the W boson, mWT , is the
magnitude of the W boson four-momentum projected onto the plane transverse
to the beam axis. In the case of the W   decay, it is calculated as:
mWT =
T  (1 cos(  )) , (4.2.2)

4.2.3 Soft muon tagging algorithm
As introduced in chapter 3, the SMT is an algorithm used to discriminate between
heavy-flavour and light-flavour jets. It relies on the semileptonic decays of c-
and b-quarks in the muon channel. Essentially, the SMT associates muons with
reconstructed jets.
The complete description of the SMT algorithm used in this analysis is found
in [5] and summarised here. The soft muon candidates are identified with selection
criteria listed in table 4.2 and explained below.
Soft muon selection criteria
Combined muon and track quality requirements
2match < 3.2
|d0| < 3 mm ; |z0  sin | < 3 mm
pT > 4 GeV ; || < 2.5
R(soft , jet)< 0.5
Table 4.2: List of the soft muon candidates selection criteria, which are explained in
the text. A selected jet is defined as soft muon tagged if exactly one soft muon candidate
is found within a distance of R = 0.5.
The combined muon and track quality requirements refer to those used for the
W -muon selection in section 4.2.2. The 2match variable measures the quality of the
80 Datasets and analysis selections
fit for the muon track of the combined muon. The variables |d0| and |z0  sin |,
which are known as the transverse and the longitudinal impact parameters respec-
tively, measure the distance of the soft muon track with respect to the primary
vertex. Such requirements collectively aim to reject muons originating mainly from
pions and kaons decays which can occur within a jet.
A selected jet is defined as soft muon tagged, or SMT-jet, if exactly one soft
muon candidate is found within a distance of R = 0.5 from its axis. The fraction
of events with SMT-jets containing or more soft muons, which is at the subpercent
level, is discarded.
Two additional selection criteria are applied to suppress the contribution of the
Z +jets background, which is described in section 3.5. The motivation of such
selection requirements is presented in section 5.1.3.
 The SMT-jet is required to have at least three associated tracks or an elec-
tromagnetic fraction (EMF) smaller than 0.8. The EMF is the fraction of
the jets total energy recorded in the EM calorimeter.
 An event is rejected if the invariant mass calculated from the soft-muon and
the W -muon, m, falls in a range around the Z boson mass (80100 GeV)
or the  meson mass (811 GeV).
The tagging efficiency, which is here defined as the probability that a c-jet is
identified with the SMT algorithm, is 0.02919 0.00032 with the event selection
criteria adopted for the W +c analysis. This value is driven mainly from the low
soft muon branching ratio BR(c  X ) = 0.096 0.004.
The calibration of the SMT algorithm is reported in references [4,5]. The author
of this thesis has collaborated to this calibration by providing software packages
implementing the SMT algorithm and the mistag rate analysis event selections.
The efficiency of the soft muon selection criteria and the mistag rate have
been measured with data-driven methods. The mistag rate, or fake rate, is the
probability that a light-flavour jet is mistakenly identified by the SMT algorithm.
The simulated samples used in the W +c analysis are corrected to match the soft
muon efficiency and mistag rate measured from data.
4.3 Monte Carlo simulation samples for the W +c and background processes 81
The efficiency of the soft muon selection criteria has been measured from
J/   and Z   data samples. The SMT efficiency can be evaluated in
events without any reconstructed jet because this tagging algorithm relies on the
reconstruction of a muon. Since the soft muon coming from a semileptonic b- and
c-quark decay is surrounded by tracks, while muons from J/ and Z bosons are
isolated, the calibration results have been validated by checking that they do not
depend on the muon isolation variables. The SMT efficiency scale factor, that is
the ratio of the value measured from data and that obtained from simulation, has
been found to range from 0.95 to 1.03 depending on the soft muon pT and , with
an uncertainty of  1%.
The mistag rate has been measured using two data samples of dijet events
containing light-flavour jets with high purity. The fraction of heavy-flavour jets in
these samples has been reduced by using a lifetime-based jet tagger (i.e. based on
the information from secondary vertices related to b- and c-hadron decays within
jets). For each of the two samples, the number of SMT-tagged jets can be related
with the mistag rate and the tagging efficiency. The SMT mistag rate has been
extracted by solving the system of two equations and found to range, depending
on the jet pT and , from 0.2% to 0.5%. The scale factor has been found to be
1.44 0.20, independent from the jet pT and .
4.3 Monte Carlo simulation samples for the W+c
and background processes
Event samples obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the W +c produc-
tion and the background processes are used in this thesis for multiple purposes,
such as estimation of background contributions or efficiencies.
The theoretical description of pp collision events, which was introduced in
section 3.1, involves the simulation of several steps: (i) the hard scattering pro-
cess according to the evaluated matrix element (ME); (ii) the propagation of
the hard scattering particles emitting ISR and FSR, which are known as the par-
ton shower (PS); (iii) the underlying event; (iv) the formation of hadrons from the
82 Datasets and analysis selections
partons in the final state, which is known as fragmentation, and the consequent
hadrons decay into stable particles. A description of these simulation steps is
found, for example, in [67].
Algorithms simulating particle scatterings are known as generators. Many gen-
erators exist, which differ, for example, in the simulation methods adopted or the
scattering processes provided.
The final state particles of simulated collision events are passed as input to
the simulation of the response of the ATLAS detector, which is described in [68].
The reconstruction of the physics objects from datasets of simulated events in
ATLAS is achieved with the same algorithms used for the LHC collision data. The
samples of simulated events used in the W +c analysis are selected with the same
criteria described for the data in section 4.2. Samples before the event selection
are criteria applied are generated by the ATLAS MC production group.
The list of the MC simulations adopted in this thesis for the W +c production
and the background processes, which where described in section 3.5 is found in ta-
ble 4.3, and described below. The generators used and the cross section multiplied
by the corresponding branching ratio are specified. The generators cross sections
are corrected, by means of multiplicative k-factors, to the more accurate NLO or
NNLO theoretical calculations.
The W + c , W +bb, W +cc and W +light production processes, which are
collectively referred to as W+jets production, are simulated with Alpgen [70] and,
for the PS and fragmentation, with Herwig [72] or Pythia [71]. The latter generator
is used for W +c production because its modelling of the c-quark fragmentation
and semileptonic decays is expected to provide a more representative description
of the data with respect to Herwig.
Additional ad hoc corrections to the simulation of the W +c production are
applied in this analysis for the c-quark fragmentation and c-hadrons decays. The
fragmentation corrections match: (i) the type and relative population of resulting
c-hadrons to the data in [80]; (ii) the fraction of c-hadron energy carried by the
c-jet energy to that obtained from Herwig++ [81]. The decay corrections match (i)
the branching ratio of the decay into muons of the c-hadrons species to the world

In the W +jets simulated samples, the W boson is allowed to decay exclusively
in the leptonic channels. The total W +jets production cross section is corrected
to the NNLO calculation in [69] and the fraction of each different W +jets process
is that predicted with Alpgen.
In the simulation of the Z +jets production, the Z boson is required to decay
into an electron, muon, or  -lepton pair. In the simulation of the tt, single-top
(s- and t-channels) and diboson production processes, at least one W or Z boson
decaying in the leptonic channel is required.

Chapter 5
Determination of the W+c
production yield
This chapter presents the determination of the number of W +c events, which is
used to calculate the production cross section. The measured yield is determined
from the data sample selected after estimating and subtracting the contribution
from the background processes.
The event selection and the background processes are described in sections 3.5
and 4.2, respectively. To attain reliable estimations, the most relevant backgrounds
are evaluated with data-driven methods. In addition, distributions of several kine-
matical quantities for the events selected from data are compared to predictions.
The contents of this chapter are the own work of the author1 and have also
been published in reference [1].
5.1 Estimation of the background processes
The most relevant background processes in the selection of the W +c signal stem
from the QCD multijet, W +light and Z +jets productions. Their contributions are
estimated with data-driven methods, in which event samples independent from that
used to extract the W +c yield are selected from the data. The tt, single-top and
1In two cases specified in the text, results of the ATLAS top quark analysis group are used
as partial input of the background estimation method adopted.
86 Determination of the W +c production yield
diboson backgrounds are estimated from the simulations described in section 4.3.
The contribution of the W +cc and the W +bb productions cancel out in the
OSSS subtraction.
The following definitions of events samples and quantities are used in the pro-
cess of determining the W +c and the background yields.
 The data event sample used to determine the W + c production yield is
referred to as the signal sample. Other data event samples employed for
background estimation are referred to as control samples.
 The 1-jet, 2-jets and 1,2-jets samples are selected according to the number
of reconstructed jets per event. The latter includes events with either one
or two jets, the others include events with exactly one and exactly two jets,
respectively. The W +c production yield is evaluated separately in each of
these samples.
 Event samples selected without the requirement of exactly one SMT-jet is
referred to as pretag samples. When the SMT-jet requirement is applied
samples are referred to as OS+SS samples (or tagged samples).
 The SMT tagging rate, that is the probability that a pretag event contains
exactly one SMT-jet, is defined as
RSMT =
NOS+SS
Npretag
, (5.1.1)
where Npretag and NOS+SS are the yields of pretag and of OS+SS events,
respectively.
 The fraction of tagged events remaining after the OSSS subtraction can be
evaluated from the OS/SS asymmetry, which is defined as
NOS  NSS
NOS + NSS
, (5.1.2)
where NOS (NSS) is the yield of the opposite (same) sign events.
5.1 Estimation of the background processes 87
5.1.1 Multijet background
The contribution of the multijet background to the signal sample is evaluated as
NOSSSmultijet = N
pretag
multijet  R
multijet  Amultijet , (5.1.3)
where N
pretag
multijet, R
multijet and Amultijet are the pretag sample yield, the SMT tagging
rate and the OS/SS asymmetry of the multijet events, respectively. All the terms
of equation 5.1.3 are derived using data-driven methods.
pretag
multijet. The estimation of N
pretag
multijet is derived from data with the method used
in [84], which is known as the matrix method. A looser category for the W -muon
is defined by removing the standard isolation requirements, Itrack < 2.5 GeV and
Icalo < 4 GeV. Accordingly, a loose sample is selected from data with the pretag
event selection criteria. The events of the loose sample whose W -muon pass the
isolation requirements define the standard (std) sample, which corresponds to the
pretag signal sample. 2
In the matrix method, the W -muon is classified as real if it originates from a
W boson decay (or a Z boson decay), and as fake otherwise. The yields of the
loose and the standard samples, N loose and N std respectively, can be expressed as:
N loose = N loosereal + N
loose
fake ,
N std = N stdreal + N
fake = r  N
loose
real + f  N
loose
fake .
(5.1.4)
The quantities r and f are referred to as the efficiencies, and represent the fraction
of muons passing the isolation requirements for the real and the fake categories,
respectively.
2The standard and the pretag signal samples are approximately identical. Events containing
two muons, one of which is classified as loose and the other as standard, are not included in the
loose sample, owing to the requirement of exactly one W -muon. Hence, events of this type are
included in the standard sample; however, they are selected in the pretag signal sample. The
difference of the yields of the standard and pretag signal samples is 0.2%, which is negligible as
the uncertainty on N
pretag
multijet is 11%.
88 Determination of the W +c production yield
If the efficiencies are known, N stdfake can be computed from N
loose and N std by
solving equations 5.1.4:
N stdfake = f  N
loose
fake =
f  r
(N std  r  N loose). (5.1.5)
Since muons of the fake category stem from the multijet production processes,
this quantity corresponds to N
pretag
multijet. Muons produced by all the other processes
(W +jets, Z +jets, top and diboson productions) originate from W (or Z ) boson
decays, and therefore are of real type.
The efficiencies can be measured in data samples with a high-purity of muons
of either the real or the fake type. The values of r and f used in this thesis
are provided by the ATLAS top quark analysis group and were measured in two
different analyses, which are outlined below.
In the first analysis, which is referred to as low mWT , f was evaluated in a
control sample selected after substituting the requirement mWT > 60 GeV with
mWT < 20 GeV and, in addition, by requiring m
T + E
T < 60 GeV. In the second
analysis, which is referred to as d0 significance, f was computed by fitting the dis-
tribution of the significance of the transverse impact parameter of the muon track,
d0/d0 , in a control sample selected by relaxing the requirement m
T > 60 GeV to
mWT + E
T > 60 GeV. For both these control data samples, all the other event
selection criteria were identical to those adopted for the W +c signal selection.
Both analyses measured r in data samples of Z   events.
To improve the accuracy of the matrix method, the efficiencies were evaluated
as a function of the muon pseudorapidity, . Additionally, r and f were also
measured as a function of the pT of the leading jet
T , or of the number of jets,
Njets, in the low m
T and the d0 significance analyses, respectively.
The matrix method is generalised to include these parametric efficiencies by
defining the event weight
f (, v)
f (, v) r(, v)
(w std  r(, v)) , (5.1.6)
where v represents p
T or Njets, and w
std is equal to 1 for events of the standard

sample gives

The results for N

multijet estimated with the matrix method are presented in
table 5.1. The yields and statistical uncertainties deriving from both the low mWT
and the d0 significance efficiencies are shown. The unweighted average of the two
results is taken as the best estimation of N

multijet. The systematic uncertainty on
the average result is evaluated as half the difference of the two measurements, and
results in a value of 11% for the 1,2-jets sample.

. Two control samples with high purity of multijet events are selected in
data to determine RSMTmultijet and Amultijet. The selection requirements on either the
W -muon isolation variables or mWT are inverted, while all the others requirement
are identical to those used for the W +c signal selection:
 inverted isolation sample: Itrack > 3.5 GeV and Icalo > 5 GeV,
 inverted mW
sample: mWT < 30 GeV.
The distributions of the events as a function of the isolation variables and mWT
are presented in figures 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. The pretag and tagged events are
shown separately. The values of Itrack, Icalo and m

control samples are displayed. The number of events originating from non-multijet
production processes (W +jets, Z +jets, top quark and diboson productions) is
determined from simulation. A systematic uncertainty of 25% is assigned from the
studies in [84] to each of the W +jets and the Z +jets predictions, and represented
by the error bands.
The inverted isolation and inverted mWT samples contain predominantly multijet
events. The fractions of W +jets and Z +jets events in the control samples are
722%, as shown in table 5.2. The uncertainties are the quadrature sum of the
statistical and systematic contributions. The fraction of top quark and diboson
events in each control region is collectively at the subpercent level and therefore
neglected.

The inverted isolation sample is used to estimate RSMTmultijet. The tagging rate is
determined in the control sample as a function of the W -muons total isolation,
which is defined as the sum of the track- and the calorimeter-based isolations:
Itot = Itrack + Icalo. (5.1.7)
The tagging rate is calculated in seven bins of total isolation as

where Ndata and NW /Z+jets are the data and W /Z +jets event yields, respectively.

relation between RSMTmultijet and Itot. Only the statistical uncertainties on the data
points are considered in the fitting procedure, while the systematic uncertainties
on the method are described below. The choice of the bin-size of Itot is a trade-off

systematic uncertainties, respectively. The linear 2-fit to the control sample data and

The tagging rate at the extrapolation point is taken as RSMTmultijet, whose total systematic
uncertainty is shown by the vertical error bar.

between the statistical uncertainties and the number of data points to fit.
The fitted line is extrapolated to the signal region (Itot < 6.5 GeV) assuming
that the same RSMTmultijetItot linear relationship holds in the signal and control re-
gions. The value of RSMTmultijet in the signal region is calculated from the fitted line
with I extrtot = 3.25 GeV. The extrapolation point, which is shown with blue points,
correspond to the central value of Itot in the signal selection.
Three different sources of systematic uncertainty are taken into account in the
extrapolation of the tagging rate in the signal region. First, the statistical uncer-
tainty on the fit parameters is propagated to the calculation of RSMTmultijet. Second,
the fit is repeated after varying the W /Z +jets contributions by their uncertainty,
i.e. with the data points shifted by the error bands; the difference in the resulting
RSMTmultijet is taken as a systematic uncertainty. Third, an uncertainty of 6.5/
12 GeV
is assigned to I extrtot assuming uniformly distributed total isolation and it is propa-
gated to the calculation of RSMTmultijet. This uncertainty is shown with horizontal error
bar on the extrapolation point. The total systematic uncertainty on the signal re-
gions tagging rate is taken as the quadrature sum of the three contributions and
it is represented by the extrapolation points vertical error bar.
Table 5.3 presents RSMTmultijet and the total uncertainties separately obtained from
the fit to the data of the 1-jet, 2-jets and 1,2-jets inverted isolation samples.
The relative value of the total uncertainty is 28% in the 1,2-jets sample. The
contribution of the three sources of systematic uncertainty is presented and the
estimation of the W /Z +jets yields is found to be the dominant one.
As a cross-check of the results in table 5.3, RSMTmultijet is also computed from
equation 5.1.8 using all the events of either the inverted isolation or the inverted
mWT samples. Table 5.4 shows the tagging rates so obtained, whose uncertainties
are the quadrature sum of the statistical and the systematic components. The
latter stems from the estimation of the W /Z +jets yields in the control samples.
The unweighted average of the two measurements is also computed, and half the
difference is used as the systematic uncertainty4.
4The propagation of the uncertainties on the two single measurements to the average is
negligible.

Table 5.3: Tagging rate of the multijet production evaluated from the fit to data of the
inverted isolation sample. The results and the total uncertainties separately determined
in the 1-jet, 2-jets and 1,2-jets samples are shown. The contributions from the three
sources of systematic uncertainty are individually presented.
As can be seen in table 5.4, the values of RSMTmultijet obtained from the two control
samples are in some tension with each other when considering the uncertainties.
This is explained by the different content of heavy-flavour jets, produced in the
multijet events, selected in the two control samples. The rate of tagged events
depends strongly on the content of heavy-flavour jets. From the results of the
fit extrapolation in figure 5.3, the inverted isolation sample is expected to be
heavy-flavour-jets-enriched with respect to the multijet events of the signal region.
Conversely, due to the low missing energy which is reconstructed in events selected
with low transverse mass, the inverted mWT sample is expected to be heavy-flavour-
jets-depleted. Hence, the values of RSMTmultijet obtained from such control samples
are expected to bracket that of the signal sample.
The estimation of RSMTmultijet from the fitting procedure and as the average of
the control sample measurements leads to compatible results. The fit method
is preferred for the final estimation of RSMTmultijet owing to the smaller uncertainties
and the more reliable extrapolation to the signal region. Appendix A describes an
extension of this procedure to the estimation of the multijet background for the
ATLAS tt cross section measurement reported in [4]. This background estimation
is the own work of the author of this thesis and exploits a data-driven method
similar to that described above.

systematic components. The average of the two measurements is computed and half the
difference is used as the systematic uncertainty. These results are used as a cross-check
of the tagging rate obtained from the fit method.
Furthermore, an evaluation of RSMTmultijet as a function of m
T was also attempted.
This method was unsuccessful because the inverted mWT sample presents larger con-
tributions from the W /Z +jets productions and the linear dependence hypothesis
is not a good description of the data.
Amultijet. The asymmetry of the multijet production processes is evaluated in the
inverted isolation and the inverted mWT samples as
Amultijet =
(Ndata  NW /Z+jets)OS  (Ndata  NW /Z+jets)SS
(Ndata  NW /Z+jets)OS+SS
, (5.1.9)
where NOS (NSS) is the number of OS (SS) events, respectively. As shown in ta-
ble 5.5, the results obtained from the two control samples are compatible. The
uncertainties are the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic components.
The latter are associated with the estimation of W /Z +jets yields and they are
calculated as described for equation 5.1.8. The average of the asymmetry ob-
tained from the two control regions is taken as the best estimation of Amultijet.
The uncertainty is set as the largest of those evaluated in the two measurements.
As a cross-check of the results, Amultijet is also evaluated after varying the
selection requirements of the inverted isolation and the inverted mWT samples by
1 GeV and 10 GeV, respectively. The asymmetries measured from the modified

by summing the signal and background distributions. The lower panel shows the data-

The shape of the multijet distribution is taken from the inverted isolation
sample. The small contribution of non-multijet events to this control data sample,
which arises from the W +jets and Z +jets productions, is neglected (0.0860.024
after the OSSS subtraction). The yield of multijet events in the region mWT >
60 GeV is taken from table 5.6. In the region mWT < 60 GeV, the yield of multijet
events is calculated as done in equation 5.1.3 where: i) the multijet pretag yield is
evaluated with the matrix method applied to the data selected with mWT < 60 GeV;
5.1 Estimation of the background processes 99
ii) the multijet SMT tagging rate and asymmetry are taken from the inverted mWT

The uncertainty on the data distribution is statistical. The uncertainty on the
predicted distribution in the region mWT < 60 GeV is dominated by that on the
multijet yield. The data-to-prediction ratio is shown in the lower panel. A 2-test5
is performed and the predicted mWT distribution is found to be in a good agreement

atic uncertainty assigned to the Z +jets simulation prediction is 25%, as explained
in section 5.1.1. The uncertainties on the tt, single-top and diboson yields are

flight. To obtain the fraction of W +light events in N
pretag
W+light, flight, a scale factor
correction provided by the ATLAS top quark analysis group is applied to the value
obtained from simulation, flight,MC. The corrections derivation, which exploits a
lifetime-based technique to tag the heavy-flavour jets, is found in reference [85]
and summarised below.
The yields of pretag and tagged events for the W +jets production are evaluated
from data as per equation 5.1.11. The tagged events are those containing at least
one heavy-flavour jet, identified by the tagging algorithm known as MV1 [86].
The MV1 tagging algorithm is based on the information from the vertices re-
lated to b- and c-hadron decays within jets. The algorithm inputs are: the number,
the masses, track multiplicities, the track energy fraction of the reconstructed ver-
tices as well as the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances of
each track within the jet. This information is combined, using a neural network,
into a single variable, which allows discriminating heavy- and light-flavour jets.
5.1 Estimation of the background processes 101
The tagger operating point used in this analysis corresponds to a 70% tagging
efficiency for b-jets in simulated tt events.
Additionally, the tagged and pretag events are divided into two samples ac-
cording to the charge of the W boson. The system of four equations relates the
yield of pretag (N
pretag
W+jets) and tagged (N
W+jets) events for the W +jets production:
NMV1,W+jets = N

W+jets
i=bb,cc,c,light
ki  f i ,MC  R
i=bb,cc,c,light
ki  fi ,MC ,
kcc = kbb.
(5.1.12)
In the relations above, the () sign refers to the two independent equations of the
W + and W samples, and the sum index i includes the four different processes
of the W +jets production (W +bb, W +cc , W +c and W +light). The quantities
fi ,MC are the fractions of pretag events of the W +jets production which are associ-
ated with each of the four processes, as evaluated from simulation. The values ki ,
which are unknown quantities of the equations system, represent the scale factors
of fi ,MC. The rates of MV1-tagged events, R
i , are evaluated from simulation.
Finally, to obtain four unknown scale factors in four equations, the ratio of pretag
events from the W +cc and W +bb productions is fixed to the value obtained from
simulation, i.e. kcc = kbb.
The system of equations 5.1.12 is solved to find the scale factors ki . The
value of flight is calculated as flight = klight  flight,MC. Since the W +bb and W +cc
backgrounds cancel out with the OSSS subtraction, the respective scale factors
are not used.
The results for the W +light pretag fractions are shown in table 5.8, sepa-
rately for events with exactly one or exactly two jets. The fractions obtained from
simulation flight,MC are shown with the statistical uncertainty. The scale factors,
which are provided by the ATLAS top quark analysis group, are compatible with
unity and the systematic uncertainty associated with the method above is 8%. As
a check of this results, the scale factors have been recalculated with the method

above by the thesis author and the results found are compatible with those adopted
within one sigma. The fraction of W +light events in the pretag W +jets sample
is 0.85 (0.77) in the 1-jet (2-jets) sample. The yield of pretag W +light events is

components, expect for flight,MC for which uncertainties are statistical.
As a check of the data selected with the pretag selection criteria and of the
W +light pretag yields, distributions of several kinematical quantities are presented
in appendix B. The distributions observed in data are compared to the predictions
from simulation, normalised with the event yields estimated in tables 5.7 and 5.8.
The predicted distributions are found to be representative of the data, with differ-
ences of the order of the percent.

. The probability that a jet in a W +light event is mistakenly tagged as
an SMT-jet, RSMTW+light, is evaluated from simulation. The latter, as explained in
section 4.2.3, is corrected for the rate of mistagging SMT-jets measured in data
(scale factor). The rate RSMTW+light is recalculated after varying the mistag scale factor
within the respective uncertainty (14%) and the difference is taken as the system-

AW+light. The OS/SS asymmetry of the W +light production, AW+light, is esti-
mated in two steps. First, the OS/SS tracks asymmetry of the W +light production
is evaluated in the pretag events selected from data (AtracksW+light,data). The OS/SS
tracks asymmetry is defined as
Atracks =
NOS,tracks  NSS,tracks
NOS,tracks + NSS,tracks
, (5.1.13)
where OS and SS yields are counted using the charge of the W boson and of
each generic track selected with the soft-muon kinematic requirements (table 4.2).
Then, AtracksW+light,data is extrapolated to the signal region according to
AW+light = kA  AtracksW+light,data , (5.1.14)
where the extrapolation factor kA is obtained from simulation.
In the data pretag sample, the OS/SS tracks asymmetry measured can be
expressed as
Atracksdata =
Fi  Atracksi , (5.1.15)
where the sum index i includes all contributing processess: W +light, W +heavy,
Z +jets, multijet, top quark and diboson productions. The quantity Fi is the
fraction of pretag events in the data originating from the process i . Hence, the
104 Determination of the W +c production yield
OS/SS tracks asymmetry for the W +light production can be extracted from that
measured in data using the equation:
AtracksW+light,data =

Table 5.10 lists the event fractions and OS/SS tracks asymmetries used in equa-
tion 5.1.16. The fractions Fi are evaluated from the yields calculated in tables 5.7
and 5.8, and the uncertainties include the statistical and systematic components.
The asymmetries Atracksi are evaluated from simulation for all the processes except
the multijet production, for which the matrix method is used, and the uncertain-
ties are statistical, except for that of the W +heavy events. Since the W +heavy
production gives the largest non-W +light contribution (FW+heavy is 16% in the 1,2-
jets sample), systematic uncertainties on the simulation prediction of AtracksW+heavy are
evaluated as described below.

The results for the W +light background estimation of equation 5.1.10 are

derives from the small number of simulated W +light events which are recon-
structed with a SMT-jet. The final OS/SS asymmetry estimated for the W +light

5.1.3 Z+jets background
The Z +jets production is a prominent background to the W +c analysis of this
thesis. 7 Since events with two muons are selected, one for the W -boson recon-
struction and the other for the c-jet tagging, the Z  + and signal events are
similar. Moreover, owing to the opposite charge of the two muons, only a small
part of this background is cancelled with OSSS subtraction.
Two selection criteria were introduced in the W+c analysis from a study by the
author in order to suppress the Z +jets background. The selection criteria, one of
which on the SMT-jet and the other on the invariant mass of the soft and W -decay
muons, were introduced in section 4.2.3 and are explained below. In addition, the
7In the similar analysis using W  e decays, the Z+jets background is smaller than 1%.
When referring the Z boson production, the contribution of  is also included.
5.1 Estimation of the background processes 107
yield of the remaining Z +jets background is estimated from a control sample of
Z -resonance events selected from data, as described below.
Selection requirements to suppress the Z+jets background
Muons from the Z  + decays can radiate photons by interacting with the
detector material and be falsely reconstructed as jets. In addition, the Z -decay
muons can be accidentally associated with jets originating in the collision event.
Both such processes lead to the reconstruction of jets containing a muon which
can be mistakenly identified as c-jets by the SMT.
The jets reconstructed from photon radiation have a larger electromagnetic
fraction (EMF) and a smaller number of associated tracks (Ntracks) with respect
to those produced by the c-quark hadronisation. This is shown in figure 5.5,
which compares the distribution of (a) EMF and of (b) Ntracks for the SMT-jet
reconstructed in simulated events of the Z +jets and W + c productions. The
events are selected with all requirements of the signal sample except for those
on EMF/Ntracks and the dimuon invariant mass, which has been removed. The
OSSS events with one or two jets are used and the distributions are normalised
to unity. To reduce the Z +jets background in the W +c analysis, the SMT-jets
are required to be reconstructed with Ntracks > 2 or EMF<0.8. The distribution
of EMF versus Ntracks is presented in figures 5.5 (c) and (d) for the Z +jets and
W +c simulations, respectively. The fraction of SMT-jets which is rejected by the
selection requirement is highlighted with a red box, and corresponds to 32.2% and
4.59% for the Z +jets and W +c productions, respectively.
In the majority of Z   events passing the W +c selection, the invariant
mass of the soft and W -decay muons, m, is close to that of the Z boson.
Conversely, in W + c events, m is expected to be small with respect the Z
boson mass. This is shown in figure 5.6 (a), which compares the m distribution
obtained from the Z +jets and W +c simulations. Events of the 1,2-jets sample
after the OSSS subtraction are considered, the EMF/Ntracks selection requirement
is applied and the two distributions are normalised to unity. To suppress the Z +jets
background in the W +c analysis, events are vetoed if m is found within the Z

(green squares) points represent events before (after) applying the selection requirement.
The region corresponding to the Z boson resonance, 80100 GeV, is excluded from the
signal sample selected from data. All distributions are for the 1,2-jets sample after
OSSS subtraction.
The rejection of the EMF/Ntracks selection requirement as a function of m
can be seen in figure 5.6 (b). Simulated Z +jets events are shown before (magenta)
and after (green) applying the selection requirement. The majority of the events
vetoed has m < 80 GeV and hence is included in the signal region. In the latter,
the fraction of events rejected by the EMF/Ntracks selection requirement results
55.2% and 4.45% for the Z +jets and W +c productions, respectively.
In conclusion, two selection requirements are adopted in the W + c analysis
to suppress the Z +jets background: (i) the SMT-jet is selected if EMF<0.8 or
Ntracks > 2; (ii) the events are selected if m<80 GeV or m>100 GeV. The
110 Determination of the W +c production yield
fraction of events rejected by adding the two selection criteria is listed in table 5.13,
separately for the 1-jet, 2-jets and 1,2-jets samples. Events after the OSSS
subtraction are used and the uncertainties are statistical. In the 1,2-jets sample,
the two selection requirements reject 82% of the background events and 12% of
the signal events. The sample selected from data is reduced by 26%.

Z+jets background and W +c signal. The reduction of the data sample events is also
shown. The uncertainties are statistical.
Data-driven estimation of the Z+jets background
The remaining Z +jets background is evaluated from simulation and corrected for
the Z +jets yield measured in a data control sample. The latter is selected with the
criteria of the signal sample except for the requirement on m which is inverted to
obtain events within the Z boson resonance 80100 GeV. In addition, to minimise
the non-Z +jets contribution to the control sample, only events containing exactly
one jet are considered.
The Z resonance control region is used to determine the correction scale factor

, (5.1.18)
where the numerator (denominator) is the OSSS yield of Z +jets events obtained

listed in table 5.14, are obtained from simulation for the W +light and diboson
productions, and in a data-driven way explained below for the W +c production.

Table 5.14: Event yields in the Z boson resonance control sample. The Z+jets yield
obtained from data and from simulation is used to evaluate the correction scale factor
kZ+jets. The statistical uncertainty on the yield observed in data is indicated in paren-
theses. The uncertainty on the Z+jets MC simulation prediction is statistical. All other
uncertainties include the statistical and systematic contributions.
The yield of W +c events in the Z boson control sample is estimated using an
iterative data-driven method. Initially, the number of W +c events is determined
from simulation and used to compute a preliminary value for the Z +jets scale
factor. As done in section 5.2, the latter is used in the signal sample to extract a
preliminary yield for the W +c production, which results in being 30% larger than
the simulation prediction. Consequently the yield of W +c events in the control
sample is increased by 30% and the Z +jets scale factor is recomputed. These two
iterations are sufficient for the scale factor value to converge to within 1% and the
112 Determination of the W +c production yield
resulting W +c yield and Z +jets scale factor are shown in table 5.14. The scale
factor obtained is kZ+jets = 1.06 0.06, whose uncertainty includes the statistical
and systematic components.
The systematic uncertainties added to the simulation predictions for W +light
and diboson productions are 50% (which is compatible with the data-driven es-
timation in table 5.12) and 25% (section 5.1.4), respectively. The Z +jets yields
obtained from data and simulation in the control region are shown with the sta-
tistical uncertainty.
The validity of the extrapolation of kZ+jets from the control region to the signal
region is checked by comparing the data and predicted distributions of m. Figures
5.7 (a) and (b) show the distributions obtained from the Z boson control sample
and from the signal sample extended to include the Z boson resonance region,
respectively. The sum of signal and background distributions (predictions) are

obtained from simulation for all processes except the multijet production, for which
the inverted isolation data sample is used (see section 5.1.1). In figure (a), the
prediction is normalised according to table 5.14 using the Z +jets yield measured
in data. In figure (b), the predicted distributions for W +c , Z +jets and W +light
production are scaled with the yields measured in the signal region (table 5.16).
The uncertainties on the data and simulated distributions are statistical and the
ratio of the data to prediction is shown in the lower panels. A 2-test (footnote 5)
is performed and the predicted m distribution is found to be in a good agreement
with data in both cases (2/dof =17.7/25 and 2/dof =74.1/59 for the control
sample and the extended signal samples, respectively).
5.1.4 Other backgrounds
The yields of tt, single-top and diboson events in the signal sample selected from
data are estimated from simulation. The results are shown in table 5.16 and the
uncertainty include the statistical and systematic components. The latter are the
sum of uncertainties associated with the cross sections (10% and 25% for the top
and diboson productions, respectively, from the cross sections in table 4.3) and
with the physics objects reconstruction (see section 7.2) in the simulated samples.
The contribution of W +cc and W +bb events is expected to cancel out with
the OSSS subtraction. The charm (bottom) or anti-charm (anti-bottom) quarks
have the same probability to be tagged by the SMT algorithm, hence, the expected
yields of OS and SS events are equal. This has been verified in the W +cc and
W +bb simulated samples, whose yields of OS, SS and OSSS events and statistical
uncertainties are shown in table 5.15. The OSSS yields obtained are compatible
with zero (the largest deviation corresponding to 1.7 standard deviations).
5.2 Results for the W+c production yields
The number of OS (SS) events selected from data is 7736 (2775) and 4376 (2479)
for the 1-jet and 2-jets samples, respectively. The corresponding number of OS
SS events and the estimated backgrounds are listed in table 5.16. The yields

first two largest backgrounds are the Z +jets and W +light productions, which
account for 6.5% and 4.5% of the data events. The size of the multijet, tt and

sample. The fraction of data events which originate from diboson production is

cal uncertainty (2.3%) is the dominant contribution. The systematic uncertainty
arising from the background estimation is 1.9%, whose largest contribution stems
from the W +light yield. The evaluation of the number of multijet and Z +jets
events gives an uncertainty of 0.7% and 0.6% respectively. Top quark and diboson
backgrounds give a small uncertainty (0.1%).

The author of this thesis performed a study of the E missT and m

ments to improve the measurement of the W +c production yields. Specifically,
the baseline E missT /m
T selection criteria of the ATLAS standard model analysis
group for the selection of W boson events have been optimised specifically for this
W +c analysis. By modifying these two selection criteria, a drastic suppression of
the multijet and Z +jets backgrounds has been achieved.
The E missT /m
T selection requirements adopted in the W +c analysis and those
of the standard model groups baseline are presented in table 5.18. The W +c
production yields have also been measured by selecting the data sample with all
the event selection criteria listed in section 4.2 except for those on E missT and m
for which the baseline selections were used. Accordingly the complete background
estimation has been performed: the multijet, W +light and Z +jets backgrounds
have been evaluated with data-driven methods, as done in sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.3,
and the top quark and diboson backgrounds have been obtained from simulation.

by subtracting the background contribution from data. The statistical uncertainties
associated with the data yield are shown in parentheses and the uncertainties on the
backgrounds and W +c yields include the statistical and systematic components.
With the baseline selections, the total uncertainty on the yield measured for
the W +c production is found to be 4.3%. The total uncertainty achieved in the
analysis with the W +c selection criteria is 3.0%. The data sample selected with
the baseline selection criteria has purity 73.1%, which is lower than that obtained
with the W +c selection criteria (82.7%). This is due to the larger Z +jets and
multijet backgrounds, which are responsible for 11.7% and 7% of the events se-
lected from data, respectively. The W +c selection criteria reduce of a factor 5 the
multijet background and halve the Z +jets background. In analysis with the base-
line selection criteria the backgrounds systematic uncertainty (3.6%) is found to
be larger than the data statistical uncertainty (2.5%). The backgroundss system-
atic uncertainty is driven by that assigned to multijet yield estimation, 2.9%. The

obtained from OSSS events of the 1,2-jets sample selected in data with baseline
criteria and compared to the prediction (sum of the signal and all backgrounds).
The distributions are obtained from simulation for all processess except the multijet
production, for which the inverted isolation sample is used (section 5.1.1). The
distributions of multijet, W +light and Z +jets events are normalised to the data-
driven yields in table 5.19. The W + c distribution is scaled to the measured
yield and therefore the prediction is normalised to data. The uncertainties on data
and simulated distributions are statistical. The ratio of data to the prediction is
displayed in the lower panel.
120 Determination of the W +c production yield
The majority of multijet (green) and Z +jets (purple) events are reconstructed
with low values of mWT and the selection m
T > 60 GeV (blue line) is adopted to
remove them. In addition, the E missT requirement of the W +c selection criteria
is relaxed from > 25 GeV to > 20 GeV, so as to not overly reduce the size
of the data sample. As a check, a 2-test (footnote 5) is performed and the
shape of the predicted and data distributions are found to be in good agreement
(2/dof =27.3/20). This indicates that the W +c simulation is representative of
the data for the modelling of W   decay. For this reason, in the unfold of the
measured W +c yield to extract the cross section (see section 7.1) no uncertainty
is added due to the harsher mWT selection requirement. Moreover, the E
requirements adopted in the W +c analysis are found to not increase the cross
section systematic uncertainties originating from the unfolding (section 7.2).
5.4 Kinematical distributions of the signal sample
The selected data, signal modelling and background estimation are checked with
the distributions of several kinematical variables in figures 5.9 to 5.12. Data dis-
tributions are compared with the predictions evaluated from the sum of signal and
backgrounds (multijet, W +light, Z +jets, top quark and diboson production), for
OSSS events with one or two jets.
Distributions are determined from simulation for all processes except the mul-
tijet production, for which data events of the inverted isolation sample are used
(section 5.1.1). The number of multijet, W +light and Z +jets events are nor-
malised to the data-driven estimations in table 5.16. The W +c distributions are
normalised to the measured yield and therefore the predictions are normalised to
data. The uncertainties assigned to the distributions of the data and simulated
events are statistical. The ratio of the predicted distribution to data is shown in
the lower panels.
A 2-test (footnote 5) is performed to compare the predicted and observed
shapes and good agreement is found (expect for the single case below and the
2/dof results are shown in the lower panels). This indicates that the signal
5.4 Kinematical distributions of the signal sample 121
simulation is representative of the data and provides a validation of the background
estimation. The data distribution of the soft muons 2match, figure 5.12 (d), is
found not to be well described by simulation. This quantity is used in soft muon
identification requirements. However, as described in section 4.2.3, the simulations
are corrected to match the SMT tagging efficiency measured in data. Therefore,
no uncertainty is added to the cross section measurement due to this mismodelling.

126 Determination of the W +c production yield
Chapter 6
Determination of the
charge-divided W+c yields as a
function of pseudorapidity
This chapter presents the measurement of the W +c event yields as a function
of the W bosons charge and of the W -muons pseudorapidity. The same data
sample selected to extract the inclusive yield of W +c events is used (chapter 5).
The yields of signal events are measured from the data after estimating the
background contributions, which are evaluated with data-driven methods for the
most important processes. The analysis described in this chapter is entirely the
own work of the author of this thesis and the results are published in reference [1].
6.1 Determination of the W++c and W+c pro-
duction yields
The data events selected with the criteria described in section 4.2 are referred to
as inclusive sample. The charge-divided samples are subsequently obtained from
it by separating the events by the W -decay muons charge. The yields of W ++c
and W+c events are measured as NOSSS,data N
OSSS,
bkg , where the positive and
negative signs refer to the W boson charge. The positive-to-negative W -charge

The background contribution to the charge-divided data samples, NOSSS,+bkg and
NOSSS,bkg , is evaluated starting from the background estimation in the inclusive
sample (chapter 5), as described below. This approach is adopted, instead of
independently estimating NOSSS,+bkg and N
OSSS,
bkg in the charged-divided samples,
for two reasons: (i) the number of events of the charge-divided samples is too small
to use the data-driven methods applied in the inclusive sample; (ii) this method
offers a simpler way to evaluate the correlation between NOSSS,+bkg and N
OSSS ,
is simpler.
The contribution of each background to the charge-divided samples can be
expressed as
NOSSS,+ =
1 + R
 NOSSS
NOSSS, =
1 + R
 NOSSS ,
(6.1.2)
where R and NOSSS are the positive-to-negative charge ratio and the yield in
the inclusive sample, respectively. Hence, the total background contributions are
evaluated from the relations
NOSSS,+bkg =
1 + Ri
 NOSSSi ,
NOSSS,bkg =
1 + Ri
 NOSSSi ,
(6.1.3)
where the sum index i includes the multijet, W +light, Z +jets, top quark and
diboson productions. The yields NOSSSi are estimated as described in chapter 5
and listed in table 5.16.
6.1.1 Estimation of charge ratio of the backgrounds
The charge ratio of the candidate W -decay muon in the background processes
is evaluated using data-driven methods for the multijet and W +light productions
and from simulation for the other backgrounds, as described below.
6.1 Determination of the W ++c and W+c production yields 129
Multijet background
The data-driven method similar to that explained in section 5.1.1 for the OS/SS
asymmetry is used to estimate the Rmultijet. Two samples with high-purity of
multijet events are selected from data, by inverting the selection requirements on
the W -decay muons isolation variables and on mWT , respectively. In both control
samples, the events are divided according to the charge of the candidate W -decay
muon and the small contribution of W +jets and Z +jets events evaluated from
simulation is subtracted. The ratio of the corrected control data yields is taken as
Rmultijet.
The results obtained from the inverted isolation and inverted mWT control sam-
ples are shown in table 6.1.

Table 6.1: Reconstructed W -charge ratio in the multijet events of the inverted isolation
and inverted mWT control data samples. The average value is taken as the best estimation
of Rmultijet. The uncertainties include the statistical and systematic components.
The uncertainties include the statistical and systematic contributions. The
latter is evaluated by assigning uncorrelated uncertainties of 25% to the W +jets
and Z +jets contributions. The average of the two control samples is taken as
the best estimation of Rmultijet and is assigned the same uncertainty as that of
the single measurement. To reduce the statistical uncertainties in the estimation
of Rmultijet, the results are obtained with OS+SS events. The same charge ratio
is expected to be reconstructed in OS and SS events of the multijet production.
This is checked by calculating Rmultijet in OS, SS and OSSS events; the results are
found to be compatible (in the 1,2-jets sample, Rmultijet is 1.040.07, 1.100.09,
and 0.950.18 for OS, SS and OSSS events, respectively).
130 Determination of the charge-divided W+c yields as a function of pseudorapidity
W+light background
A data-driven method similar to that explained in section 5.1.2 for the OS/SS
tracks asymmetry is used to estimate RW+light. The W -charge ratio is first evalu-
ated in pretag events selected from data and then extrapolated to the signal sample
according to the equation
RW+light = kR  R
, pretag
W+light,data, (6.1.4)
in which the correction factor kR is obtained from simulation.
The W -charge ratio of pretag events in data can be expressed as R
, pretag
data =
i Fi R
, pretag
i , where the summation includes the W +light, W +heavy, Z +jets,
multijet, top quark and diboson events. For each of these processes, Fi and
, pretag
i are the fraction of pretag events in data and the pretag W -charge ratio,
respectively. Consequently, the W +light production is calculated as:
, pretag
W+light,data =
FW+light
, pretag
data 
i 6=W+light
Fi  R
, pretag
. (6.1.5)
The event fractions and pretag charge ratios used in equation 6.1.5 are shown in
tables 5.10 and 6.2, respectively. For the data, the ratio is measured in the pretag
charge-divided samples. The ratios R
, pretag
i are evaluated from simulation for all
processes except the multijet production, for which the matrix method described
in section 5.1.1 is used. The uncertainties in table 5.10 are statistical except for
those on R
, pretag
W+heavy, which include the systematic contribution, evaluated as done
in section 5.1.2 for AtracksW+heavy.
The results of the W -charge ratio for the W +light production are shown in
table 6.3. The pretag ratio measured in data is 1.500.15 for the 1,2-jets sample
and the uncertainties includes the statistical and systematic components. The
extrapolation factor is evaluated as
kR =
RW+light,MC
, pretag
W+light,MC
, (6.1.6)
where RW+light,MC (R
, pretag
W+light,MC) is obtained from simulated events of the signal
(pretag) region. The factor kR is evaluated in OS+SS events and the uncertain-
ties are statistical. The OS+SS sample is used to reduce the large uncertainties

132 Determination of the charge-divided W+c yields as a function of pseudorapidity
which arise from the small number of simulated W +light events passing the re-
quirement of one SMT-jet. The extrapolation factor calculated with OS, SS and
OSSS events is checked for compatibility with that in the table (in the 1,2-jets
sample, kR is 1.570.09, 1.700.12 and 1.00.6 for OS, SS and OSSS events,
respectively). Finally, RW+light is estimated to be 1.580.18 in the 1,2-jets sample,
whose uncertainty dominated by the estimation of the charge ratio in the pretag
data events.
Owing to the larger density of u-quarks in pp collisions, the W -charge ratio in
the W +light events is expected to be larger than 1. For example, the processes
u + g  d + W + and u + d  g + W + give a larger contribution to the W +light
production than the processes d +g  u +W and d +u  g +W, respectively.
Z+jets background
The ratio RZ+jets is evaluated from simulation and checked in the Z resonance
control data sample. The results obtained from simulation are shown in table 6.4
for the 1-jet, 2-jets and 1,2-jets samples and the uncertainties are statistical. To
improve the precision, OS+SS events are used for RZ+jets. The same W -charge
ratio is expected to be reconstructed in the OS and SS events of the Z +jets
production. This is checked by calculating the charge ratio also with OS, SS and
OSSS events and the results are found to be compatible with those in the table
(in the 1,2-jets sample, RZ+jets is 1.030.06, 1.120.11 and 0.990.09 for OS,
SS and OSSS events, respectively).
As a check of the simulation results, RZ+jets is evaluated also in the Z -resonance
control sample described in section 5.1.3. The contributions of non-Z +jets events
(W +c , W +light and diboson production) are subtracted from the yield of data
events reconstructed with positive and negative W -decay muons. The charge ratio
of the control sample, whose uncertainty includes the statistical and systematic
components, is shown in table 6.4 and found to be compatible with that of the
signal region.

check, the ratio is also estimated in the Z -resonance control region.
Top quark and diboson backgrounds
The ratios R
, Rsingle-top and R
diboson are evaluated from simulation and the results
are shown in table 6.5 with the statistical uncertainties. The ratios for the top
quark production are computed using OS+SS events to reduce the uncertainties.
The compatibility of the ratios calculated in the OS, SS and OSSS events is
checked (in the 1,2-jets sample: R
is 0.9980.017, 0.970.10 and 0.9960.020
for OS, SS and OSSS events, respectively, and similarly Rsingle-top is 1.610.04,
1.700.05 and 1.420.14). In the case of the diboson production, the OS and
the SS samples have different charge ratios due to different fractions of WW and
WZ events present in the two samples. For this reason, Rdiboson is evaluated using
OSSS events (Rdiboson is found to be 1.150.04 and 1.350.08 in OS and SS
events, respectively).

6.1.2 Results
The event yields measured for the W ++c and W+c productions and their ratios
are presented in table 6.6. The uncertainties associated with the selected data
samples are shown in the table. The background yields are calculated from equa-
tion 6.1.3 and the uncertainties include the statistical and systematic uncertainties.
The yields of W ++c and W+c events are measured from data after subtracting
the contributions from backgrounds and the W -charge ratio measured for W ++c
events is shown in the last row. The W -charge ratio measured for the W +c pro-
duction is smaller than 1 as expected (see also section 7.3). The data statistical
uncertainties are larger than those arising from the background estimation.

The breakdown of the uncertainties associated with the background estimation
is shown in table 6.7 for the 1-jet and the 2-jets samples and in table 6.8 for the
1,2-jets sample. The uncertainties on the yields of OSSS events in the inclusive
sample, which are estimated as detailed in chapter 5, are larger than the uncertain-
ties on the charge ratios. The dominating source of uncertainty in the background
estimation is the estimation of the W +light OSSS yield.

6.2 Determination of the W +c production yield as a function of || 137
6.2 Determination of the W+c production yield
as a function of ||
The yields of the W + +c and W+c events are measured separately in 11 bins1
of the absolute value of the W -decay muon pseudorapidity, ||. The distributions
for the background processes are evaluated from simulation in all cases except the
multijet production, for which these are derived from data.
The || distribution of the multijet production is taken as the average of those
obtained from the inverted isolation and inverted mWT control data samples. The
distributions of the control data samples are corrected for the small contributions
of W +jets and Z +jets events estimated from simulation. Figure 6.1 (a) shows the
shapes obtained from the control region and their average for the events containing
one or two jets. The uncertainty on the average distribution, which is displayed
by the error band, is taken as half the difference of the two measurements. The
distributions central jump is an effect of the size of the bin ||  [1.05, 1.37],
which is larger than the other bins. To reduce the uncertainties, these distributions
are derived in the OS+SS samples. For the multijet production, OS and SS events
are expected to be reconstructed with same || shape. The shapes in OS and SS
events have been verified as being compatible.
The || distributions for non-multijet backgrounds are evaluated from simula-
tion. For the W +light, single-top and tt productions, OS+SS events are used to
reduce the statistical uncertainties. The normalised distributions derived for three
processess in OS and SS events are shown in figures 6.1 (b) (c) (d). A 2-test
(section 5.1.3) is performed and the OS shape is found to be compatible with the
SS shape (2/dof is 5.2/11, 13.5/11 and 8.6/11 for W +light, single-top and tt
production, respectively). The || shape of diboson and Z +jets productions are
evaluated using OSSS events. In both cases, the OS (black circles) and SS (red
squares) samples are expected to be composed of events with different  shapes.
The || distributions of the data are shown in figure 6.2 for OSSS events
1The bins of || are defined from the values {0, 0.21, 0.42, 0.63, 0.84, 1.05, 1.37, 1.52,
1.74, 1.95, 2.18, 2.5}. The bins have variable size and the bin [1.05, 1.37] is the largest.
138 Determination of the charge-divided W+c yields as a function of pseudorapidity
containing: (a) W + boson and one jet; (b) W boson and one jet; (c) W + boson
and two jets; (d) W boson and two jets. Similarly, in figure 6.3 events of the 1,2-
jets sample with (a) W + boson and (b) W boson are shown. The uncertainties
on the data distributions are statistical. The W+c distributions are measured from
the data by subtracting the estimated background in each || bin.
The backgrounds are evaluated as described above and the distributions of
multijet, W +light and Z +jets events are normalised to their data-driven estima-
tions explained in section 6.1. The uncertainties on the backgrounds are the sum
of the statistical and systematic components. The latter arise from the PDFs un-
certainty and are evaluated as explained in section 7.2. Other uncertainties on the
simulated shapes of the background processes have been found to be negligible.
The total uncertainty on the background distributions are represented by the error
bands.
The distributions of the data are compared with the predictions obtained as
the sum of the backgrounds and signal distributions. The latter are taken from the
W +c simulation and normalised to the measured yields (table 6.6). A 2-test is
performed between data and prediction and good agreement in found in all cases
(the values of 2/dof are shown in the figures). This indicates that the W +c
simulation is representative of the data for the modelling of || and provides a
validation of the background estimation.

142 Determination of the charge-divided W+c yields as a function of pseudorapidity
Chapter 7
Determination of the W+c
production cross section
This chapter presents the results of the measurement of the W+c production cross
section and the comparison with theoretical predictions.
Sections 7.1 to 7.3 report the extraction of the W +c cross section from the
event yields, which are presented in chapters 5 and 6 as a function of: (i) the
jet multiplicity; (ii) the W boson charge; (iii) the pseudorapidity of the W -decay
muon. The unfolding of the measured yields and the evaluation of the associated
systematic uncertainties reported in references [1,2] and are summarised here. The
results of the inclusive and differential cross section measurements are presented.
Additionally, section 7.4 presents the statistical combination of the W +c cross
section measured in the muon channel and the electron channel analyses. The
former refers to the analysis described in this thesis and the latter is the similar mea-
surement using W boson decays to electrons, which is described in reference [1].
This combination of the cross sections is based on the profile likelihood method
and is entirely the own work of the author of this thesis.
In section 7.5 the combined cross section is compared with the theoretical
predictions calculated in reference [1]. Different PDF sets are used: the measure-
ment is found to be sensitive to the strange quark content of the proton. Finally,
section 7.6 reports additional results obtained from measurement of the W + c
production in this thesis. The W -charge ratio and the differential cross sections
144 Determination of the W +c production cross section
measured in the muon and electron channel analyses have been combined, and the
results have been compared to theoretical predictions. The results of the muon
and electron channels analyses have also been combined with those of the WD()
analysis [1]. The latter is a measurement of the W +c production which employs a
complementary method for the charm quark identification. The strange-to-down
PDF ratio has been extracted from the combined W +c production results.
7.1 Fiducial cross section definition
The W+c production cross section is measured in a fiducial region, or fiducial phase
space. Fiducial cross sections are independent from the detector (particle level)
and allow the comparison with theory predictions and among experimental results.
The event yields of the signal are unfolded to the fiducial region, i.e. corrected for
detector effects such as acceptance, efficiency and resolution. In order to reduce
the extrapolation of the measured yields, the fiducial region closely matchs the
selection criteria applied to the data (detector level).
The definition of the fiducial region for this analysis is summarised in table 7.1
and explained below.
The momentum of the W -decay muon is considered before final state radiation
(section 3.1). Jets are constructed from stable particles, i.e. those with lifetime
in excess of 10 ps, using the anti-kT clustering algorithm with radius parameter
R=0.4 (section 4.2.2). The muon and neutrino originating from the W -boson
decay are excluded from the jet reconstruction.
The W+c production cross section is calculated separately for events containing
one c-jet with no additional jets (1-jet exclusive), with exactly one additional non-
c-jet (2-jet exclusive) or with any number of additional non-c-jets (1-jet inclusive).
The c-quarks are identified through a c-hadron embedded in the reconstructed
particle-level jets. The c-jets are those containing a c-hadron with pT > 5 GeV
within a cone R = 0.3.

are explained in the text.
Integrated cross section
The integrated cross section in the fiducial region is calculated from the equation
OSSSfid =
NOSSSdata  N
OSSS
U  L
, (7.1.1)
where NOSSSdata , N
OSSS
bkg and L are the yield, the estimated background, and the
integrated luminosity of the data sample, respectively. The cross section OSSSfid
is the product of the total cross section and the branching ratio BR(W  ).
The quantity U is the unfolding factor, which corrects the measured yield of
signal events for the detector efficiency, acceptance and resolution. The unfolding
factor is evaluated from the W +c simulation (section 4.3) as
NOSSSW+c (detector level)
NOSSSW+c (particle level)
, (7.1.2)
where the numerator and denominator are the number of OSSS events passing
the detector selection criteria applied to the data (table 4.1), and the number
evaluated in the defined fiducial region, respectively. The charge of the W boson
and of the c-quark are used to classify OS and SS events in NOSSSW+c (particle level).
146 Determination of the W +c production cross section
The magnitude of U is about 2%, due to the small fraction of the c-quarks decaying
to a muon.

W+c is the W -charge ratio of the signal yields measured in data (equa-

for W ++c and W+c events, and their ratio is found to be 1.008 0.005 in the
1-jet inclusive sample.
Differential cross section as a function of ||
The differential cross section is calculated from equation 7.1.1 in intervals of the
absolute pseudorapidity of the W -decay muon, ||. The bin-by-bin unfolding
is sufficiently accurate because the resolution of the || measurement is high with
respect to the bins width used.
7.2 Systematic uncertainties
The sources of systematic uncertainties on the fiducial cross section of equa-
tion 7.1.1 are: i) background estimation; ii) luminosity measurement; iii) detector
response and its modelling in the simulation; iv) signal modelling in the simulation.
The sources and the magnitudes of systematic uncertainty evaluated for OSSSfid
and RW+c in the 1-jet inclusive sample are found in table 7.2. The total systematic
uncertainty on OSSSfid and R
W+c are 5.3% and 2.0%, respectively. The two largest
contributions to the cross section uncertainty arise from the modelling of the c-
hadrons decay and from the jet energy scale. In the measured ratio, most of the
systematic uncertainties either cancel out or are significantly reduced, being highly
correlated in W ++c and W+c events.

Table 7.2: List of the systematic uncertainties on OSSSfid and R
W+c in the 1-jet inclusive
sample. The uncertainty on the backgrounds is shown in chapters 5 and 6 and that on
the luminosity is determined in [34]. All other uncertainties are taken from [1] and their
evaluation is outlined in the text.
The uncertainties related to the background estimation are shown in chapters 5
and 6 and are own work of the author of this thesis. The luminosity measurement is
reported in [34]. The evaluation of the other systematic uncertainties is described
in [1] and outlined below.
Uncertainties on the detector response and its modelling in the simulation are
related to the event selection criteria applied to the data (section 4.2). These
uncertainties have been assessed by recalculating the numerator of U in equa-
tion 7.1.2 and taking the difference of the measured OSSSfid (or R
W+c).
The trigger and reconstruction efficiencies of the W -decay muon have been
varied in the simulation within their respective uncertainties determined from
data [58, 59]. A similar procedure has been used for the uncertainties due to
148 Determination of the W +c production cross section
the scale and resolution of the muons pT. The impact of the uncertainties due to
the jet energy scale and resolution has been evaluated by varying each of these in
the simulation within their respective uncertainties as determined from data [64].
The JES uncertainty ranges from less than 1% to about 7%, depending on jet pT
and , with an additional 2% added in quadrature assigned to c-jets. The un-
certainties of the momentum scale and resolution of the W -decay muon and the
energy and resolution of jets have been propagated in the E missT reconstruction. In
the E missT also the uncertainties stemming from the soft-jets and the calorimeter
cells not associated with any physic object have been also taken into account as
per [65]. The soft muons tagging efficiency and mistag rate have been varied in
the simulation within the range determined from the tagger calibration, which is
summarised in section 4.2.3.
The evaluation of U depends on the modelling of the W +c production and
decay in the simulation. The modelling of c-quark fragmentation and c-hadrons
decay are particularly relevant for the measurement with the SMT technique, as
this affects the number of simulated c-hadrons, their fraction which decay to a
muon, and the pT spectrum of this muon. These uncertainties have been assessed
by recalculating U and taking the difference in the measured OSSSfid (or R
W+c).
The c-quark fragmentation systematic uncertainty is specific to the two cor-
rections (section 4.3) applied to the signal simulation: (i) type and relative popu-
lation of the c-hadrons resulting from c-quark fragmentation; (ii) fraction of the
c-hadrons pT carried by the reconstructed c-jet. The uncertainties on these two
corrections are derived from the data in [80] and in [87], respectively. The c-
hadron decay systematic uncertainty includes two sources: (i) the branching ratios
of the c-hadrons decays to a muon [82]; (ii) the pT spectrum of the outgoing soft
muons, whose uncertainty is evaluated as the difference of EvtGen and Herwig.
The systematic uncertainty due to the jet multiplicity of the simulated W +c
events has been estimated by varying the amount of initial and final state radia-
tion in the parton shower (PS). The uncertainty related to the modelling of the
underlying event (UE) is evaluated from simulation. The choice of the PDF set
influences the signal simulation kinematics and the systematic uncertainty is as-
7.3 Cross section results 149
sessed by using different PDF sets. Finally, the uncertainty on U due to the limited
size of the simulated signal sample is 1.4%.
7.3 Cross section results
Table 7.3 presentes the fiducial cross section measured for the W +c , W ++c and
W+c productions and the derived W -charge ratio. The definitions of OSSSfid
and RW+c are found in equations 7.1.1 and 7.1.3, respectively. The measurements
are shown separately for the 1-jet, 2-jets and 1-jet inclusive samples. The two
uncertainties quoted represent the statistical and systematic component, respec-
tively.
The W +c production cross section measured in the fiducial region is found
to be 72.6 pb, with a total uncertainty of 5.8%, for events with at least one jet.
The systematic uncertainties on the measured cross sections are larger than the
statistical uncertainties. In this fiducial region, RW+c is measured to be 0.92 with
a total uncertainty of 4.6%, for events with at least one jet. As expected, the plus-
to-minus W -charge ratio is slightly smaller than 1, owing to the larger fraction of
gd  Wc events than gd  W +c events produced in proton-proton collision,
as explained in section 7.6. The measurement of the W -charge ratio is limited by
the statistical uncertainty.
The fiducial cross section as function of the || is shown in figures 7.1 (a) and
(b) for the W ++c and W+c events. The statistical and systematic uncertainties
are represented by error bars and error bands, respectively. The uncertainties are
dominated by the statistical component, especially in the forward || region.
These measurements are compared with theoretical predictions in section 7.5,
after the combination with the results of the electron channel analysis.

7.4 Combination with the electron channel analysis
A measurement of the W +c production similar to that of described in this thesis,
but using the electron channel decay of W bosons, is reported in reference [1]. The
muon and electron channel analyses select independent samples of events from the
ATLAS data (section 4.1) and measure the cross section in the identical fiducial
region (section 7.1). Their results for OSSSfid and R
W+c are found to be compatible,
and their statistical and systematic uncertainties are similar in magnitude [2]. The
same sources of systematic uncertainty (section 7.2) have been considered and
most of them are correlated between the two measurements.
This section describes the statistical combination of the cross section measured
in the two channels, as done by the author of this thesis using the profile likeli-
hood ratio method [88, 89]. The combination is performed to obtain a common
result and to improve the precision of the W +c cross section measurement.
7.4.1 Profile likelihood ratio method
Likelihood functions are used to estimate parameters of statistical models from
observed data. Models can contain both parameters of interest and nuisance
parameters; the latter are not of interest but are introduced to make the model
more representative of the observed data.
Given the likelihood function L(a, b), where a represents the parameter of
interest1 and b the nuisance parameters, the profile likelihood ratio is defined as
(a) 
L(a, b)
L(a, b)
. (7.4.1)
The numerator of equation 7.4.1 is the likelihood function maximised with respect
to the parameters b, for a given fixed value of a. In L(a, b) the likelihood function
is profiled with respect to the nuisance parameters and
b are known as the
conditional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of b. The denominator L(a, b)
represents the likelihood function maximised with respect to all parameters and (a,

extended to the case with more than one.
7.4 Combination with the electron channel analysis 153
b) are known as ML estimators of the parameters. The profile likelihood ratio is
defined such that (a) = 1 for a = a.
Using the principle of maximum likelihood, the best estimation of the parameter
a from the observed data is given by a. The uncertainty on the ML estimator is
evaluated from the profile likelihood ratio. The estimators of the one standard
deviation interval
a  
, a + +
satisfy the relation
 ln
a  
. (7.4.2)
The profile likelihood ratio method is used in the presence of a large number of
nuisance parameters, which are added to the model to account for the systematic
uncertainties in the measurement. The uncertainty on the parameter of inter-
est extracted from the ML fit is larger when nuisance parameters are included,
because the estimators a and b are correlated and hence the contour defined
in equation 7.4.2 becomes broader.
7.4.2 Likelihood function for the cross section combination
This section describes the likelihood function used to combine the W +c produc-
tion cross section measured in the muon and the electron channel analyses. The
parameter of interest is the combined fiducial cross section in the 1-jet inclusive
sample, which is hereafter referred to as .
The observed data of the model are the yields of OSSS events selected from
the data, Ncobs = N
OSSS,c
data , where c = e, refers to the electron and muon
channel analysis. The observed yields are modeled with Gaussian distributions
with expectation value Ncexp and standard deviation s
c . Gaussian distributions are
used owing to the large number of observed events and to account for the fact
that the data yields are evaluated as OSSS events. The parametrisation of Ncexp
is explained below and the standard deviation is fixed to the statistical uncertainty
observed in the data, sc =
NOS,cdata + N
data .
Equations 7.4.3 to 7.4.5 show the parametrisation of the expected number of
events Ncexp , which is expressed as the sum of the expected yield for the signal,

The signal yield Ncsig is computed as the product of the combined cross section ,
integrated luminosity L and acceptance unfolding factor Uc (equation 7.1.1). To
account for the systematic uncertainties on L, Uc and Ncbkg, nuisance parameters
are introduced into the model as explained below.
The luminosity nuisance parameter, L, is defined such that L = 0 corresponds
to the measured value for the luminosity, L0, and L = 1 to a one standard
deviation shift. The relative uncertainty on the luminosity measurement, L, is
fixed to the experimental uncertainty value (L  L0).
Similarly, Uc0 represents the estimated unfolding factor and nuisance parameters
are added to account for the sources of systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties
on Uc are considered to be either totally correlated or totally uncorrelated between
the muon and electron channel analyses. Each correlated source introduces a
single nuisance parameter in the model, which is indicated in equation 7.4.4 with
j . Each uncorrelated source adds two nuisance parameters, one for the muon
and one for the electron channel, which are indicated in equation 7.4.4 with ck .
Finally, the nuisance parameters cNbkg are introduced in equation 7.4.5 to account
for the uncertainty stemming from the background estimations.
The uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are modelled as independent Gaus-
sian random variables. This corresponds to constraining the variation of each nui-
sance parameter i with an independent normal Gaussian distribution, Gaus(0|i , 1).

7.4 Combination with the electron channel analysis 155
Table 7.4 presents the observed yields, their statistical uncertainties, the ob-
served luminosity, unfolding factors and background yields used in the likelihood
function. The uncertainties on L0, U
0 and N
bkg,0 are listed in table 7.5. For the
muon channel analysis, the observed and the background yield are evaluated in sec-
tion 5.2 and the values of the unfolding factor and systematic uncertainties are
reported in section 7.2. The analogous quantities in the electron channel analysis
are taken from [2].
The sources of systematic uncertainty which are uncorrelated between the muon
and electron channels are those associated with the identification of the lepton from
the W -decay and with the background estimation. All other sources of systematic
uncertainties are considered as correlated and are indicated with an asterisk () in
table 7.5.
The ML fit is executed with the RooFit/RooStats software packages [90,91], in
which the negative log likelihood,  lnL, is numerically minimised by the Minuit
software package [92].

7.4 Combination with the electron channel analysis 157
7.4.3 Result of the maximum likelihood fit
The W +c production cross section is measured to be 72.6 1.7 3.9 pb in the
muon channel (section 7.3) and 66.8 1.7 4.4 pb in the electron channel [2],
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The combined
cross section extracted from the ML fit is:
 = 70.9 +4.13.8 pb = 70.9 1.2 (stat.)
3.6 (syst.) pb. (7.4.7)
The statistical and the systematic uncertainties of the combined result are smaller
than those of the two individual measurements, as expected. The total uncertainty
of the combined cross section corresponds to +5.7%/ 5.3%, and the statistical
and systematic components individually are 1.7% and +5.5%/5.0%, respectively.
The statistical uncertainty on  is obtained from a ML fit without system-
atic uncertainties, i.e. by fixing   0. In this case, the fit result is stat =
69.8  1.2 (stat.) pb, which, as expected, corresponds to the average of the two
cross sections measurements weighted with their statistical uncertainties. The sys-
tematic uncertainty on  is computed by subtracting in quadrature the statistical
uncertainty from the total uncertainty, where the latter is that obtained of the ML
fit with both the statistical and systematic uncertainties.
The results of the ML fit can be seen in figure 7.2, in which the negative
log profile likelihood ratio,  ln(), is shown as a function of the parameter of
interest . The function minimised in the ML fit is shown by the solid blue curve.
The ML estimator  corresponds to its minimum and the one standard deviation
interval on  is indicated by the solid red lines. Similarly, the results of the ML fit
including only statistical uncertainties is shown with dashed lines.
The presence of nuisance parameters in the fit broadens the shape of  ln()
and hence increases the uncertainty on  (equation 7.4.2). This reflects the loss
of information in the data due to the systematic uncertainties in the cross section
measurements. The profile likelihood of the fit with only statistical uncertainties
is a quadratic function of  and therefore  ln() has a parabolic shape. If nui-
sance parameters are included in the fit, the coefficients of the quadratic function
depend on the particular value of  and, consequently, the  ln() shape is only

Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments are used to verify that the estimator  has no
bias and that its uncertainty is accurately extracted from the fit (see section 7.4.4).
Moreover, it is also shown that the confidence level associated with the uncertainty
interval can be taken as Gaussian, i.e. 68%.
Finally, the values and uncertainties of the 16 nuisance parameters extracted
by the fit are listed in table 7.6. The fitted values correspond to the ML estimators
 and their uncertainties are derived from the Hessian matrix of L(,) at the
global minimum. 3 The nuisance paramaters representing uncorrelated sources of
systematic uncertainty in the two channels are varied by the fit. The largest shifts
are found to be on the background yields, which result in a variation of 0.5 and -0.9
2This is because of the conditional ML estimators
b , which maximise the likelihood function
for each given value of a.
3Given the likelihood function L(), the inverse of the parameters covariance matrix, 1,
can be estimated as (1)ij = 
2L()/ij , where the Hessian matrix of L() is calculated
at  = .

standard deviations from the measured value in the muon and the electron channel,
respectively. These two nuisance parameters present the largest variations because
they are the less constrained, i.e. have the largest measurement uncertainties (see
table 7.5). Furthermore, since the cross section measured in the muon channel is
larger than that of the electron channel, nuisance parameters associated with the
muon channel have positive shifts and those of the electron channel have negative
shifts.
7.4.4 Fit validation with Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments
The validity of the results obtained from the ML fit is checked by generating
an ensemble of 100,000 Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments. The pseudo-data are
generated from the models distribution Gaus(Ncobs |N
exp(,), s
c), with nuisance
parameters   0 and with an arbitrary value of the cross section true = 64.04 pb.
The latter is the baseline for the theoretical prediction of the W +c cross section
(see section 7.5). The generated pseudo-data N
obs and N
obs are shown in figure 7.3
(a) and (b). To check the correct generation of the pseudo-data, the distributions
are fitted to a Gaussian function and are found to be in agreement with the
expectation.
Similarly, the pseudo-measurements of Uc0 , N
bkg,0 and L0 are generated from
Gaussian distributions with centre and width equal to the measured value and
uncertainty for each of these quantities (table 7.4). The ensembles of U
0 and
Ue0 are generated taking into account the sources of systematic uncertainty which
are correlated between the muon and electron channel (table 7.5). The generated
distributions are shown in figures 7.3 (c) to (g). To check the correct generation
of the pseudo-measurements, their distributions are fitted to Gaussian functions
and found to be in agreement with the expectations.
The ML fit described in section 7.4.3 is executed on the ensemble of 100,000
pseudo-experiments and the pull is calculated from the result of each fit. The pull
is defined as 
 (fit  true)/
fit if fit > true ,
(fit  true)/fit otherwise ,

162 Determination of the W +c production cross section
where fit is the cross section obtained from each fit and 
fit/
fit are the fit uncer-
tainties. The resulting pull distribution is presented in figure 7.4. The root mean
square (RMS) is found to be compatible with 1, showing that the fit uncertainties
are an accurate estimation of the standard deviation of fit. The mean value of
the pull distribution indicates that the estimator fit has a very small bias, which is
neglected since it corresponds to only 0.0168 standards deviations or, equivalently,
to 0.066 pb. 4 This small bias is introduced by the nuisance parameters, since
the estimator was found to be unbiassed when the same validation procedure was
carried out by fitting with statistical uncertainties only.
An unbinned maximum likelihood fit to a Gaussian with central value m and
standard deviation s is performed on the pull distribution. The result shows that the
pull is approximately Gaussian-distributed and hence the confidence level associated
with the fit uncertainty interval corresponds to approximately 68%. In addition,
the parameters of the fitted gaussian (m and s) are found to be compatible with
the distributions mean and RMS, and the slightly asymmetric shape is found to
have a skewness5 of 0.151 0.008.
4From the result of the combination of measured cross sections in equation 7.4.7, the bias is
evaluated as: pull  (+ + )/2 = 0.0168  (4.1 + 3.8)/2 pb.

7.5 Comparison with theoretical predictions
This section compares the W +c production cross section obtained from the com-
bination of the muon and electron channel measurements with the QCD NLO
theoretical predictions taken from reference [1].
The predicted OSSSfid have been obtained with the aMC@NLO [93] generator,
for the computation of the matrix element, interfaced with Herwig++ [81] for sim-
ulation of the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event. The corrections
to the simulated c-quark fragmentation explained in section 4.3 are applied to the
predicted results.
The dependence of the NLO prediction on the choice of the renormalisation and
factorisation scales has been evaluated by independently halving and doubling their
nominal value, chosen as the sum of the transverse mass of all final-state particles.
The prediction uncertainty due to the QCD scales has been found to be +8%/
 4%. The fiducial cross section in the 1-jet inclusive sample ensures the smallest
prediction uncertainties due to the PS simulation. This uncertainty is assessed by
comparing the modelling of the Herwig++, Herwig and Pythia generators and is
164 Determination of the W +c production cross section
found to be 1%.
Six theoretical predictions have been calculated by using the six PDF sets intro-
duced in section 3.3: CT10, MSTW2008, HERAPDF1.5, NNPDF2.3, NNPDF2.3coll
and ATLAS-epWZ12. All parton distributions are computed at NLO, with the ex-
ception of ATLAS-epWZ12 which is an NNLO PDF set. For each prediction, the
uncertainty due to the PDFs has been calculated according to the prescription
of each PDF set. In the NNPDF2.3 and MSTW2008 analyses, the s-quark PDF
is suppressed with respect to that of the d-quark sea. The CT10 and HERA-
PDF1.5 analyses show a similar, although smaller, suppression. The s-quark PDF
is non-suppressed in the ATLAS-epWZ12 and NNPDF2.3coll analyses.
Figure 7.5 presents the comparison of the measured OSSSfid for the W + c
production (equation 7.4.7) with the theoretical predictions. The vertical blue line
is the measured cross section, whose inner yellow and outer green error bands
correspond to the statistical and to the total uncertainties, respectively. The cross
sections predicted using the six PDF sets are shown with markers and are found
to differ by as much as 25%. The inner and outer error bars on the predictions
represent the PDFs uncertainty and the total uncertainty, respectively. This total
uncertainty on the predictions is the quadrature sum of those associated with the
PDFs, QCD scales and parton shower.
The predictions for the ATLAS-epWZ12, NNPDF2.3coll, CT10 and HERA-
PDF1.5 PDF sets are found to be in agreement with the data within 1-sigma. In
these PDF analyses, the s-quark contribution to the proton sea is non-suppressed
or slightly suppressed. The predictions for the NNPDF2.3 and MSTW2008 PDF
sets, in which the s-quark component is more heavily suppressed, are found to be
less favoured by the data.
The measurement of the W+c production cross section in this thesis disfavours
PDF sets with suppressed s-quark density.

166 Determination of the W +c production cross section
7.6 Additional results on the W+c production
The W +c analysis described in this thesis has been combined with those using
additional W boson and c-quark decay channels. The combined results are found
in reference [1] and are reported in this section.
The muon and the electron channel analyses have been combined to obtain a
common measurement for the: (i) W -charge cross section ratio RW+c measure-
ment; (ii) differential cross section as a function of ||; (iii) differential cross
section as a function of the jet multiplicity. The combined results have been
compared to QCD NLO theoretical predictions.
The W +c production has also been measured by tagging the c-quark from
hadronic decays of the D and D mesons in the ATLAS data. This measurement,
which is reported in the reference [1], is referred to as the WD() analysis. The
cross sections measured using soft muon tagging, which are here referred to as
Wc-jet muon and electron analyses, have been combined with those of the WD()
analysis to determine a common value of the strange-to-down PDFs ratio.
Cross section W-charge ratio
The combined measurement of RW+c=
OSSS
fid (W
+ +c)/OSSSfid (W
+c) is com-
pared to theoretical predictions in figure 7.6. The predictions and their uncertain-
ties have been calculated as summarised in section 7.5 for OSSSfid .
The measured ratio is found to be smaller than unity. This is expected in
proton-proton collisions because, owing to the valence d-quarks, the gd  Wc
production is larger then the gd  W +c production (section 3.2). Also a larger
density of s-quarks relative to s-quarks in the sensitive range of the measurement
would lower RW+c . Such an asymmetry between s(x) and s(x) is suggested by
neutrino data (section 3.3) and is implemented in the MSTW2008 and NNPDF2.3
PDF sets.
The measured RW+c is found to be compatible with the six theoretical pre-
dictions within 1-sigma. The statistical uncertainty is dominant and most of the
systematic uncertainties cancel out or are reduced when evaluating the cross sec-

predictions are shown with markers, whose error bars represent uncertainties associated

An estimation of the s/s-quark PDF asymmetry, Ass , can be extracted from

where |Vcd |2 = 0.225 and the PDFs are averaged over the phase space of the
measurement (see also [40]). In PDF sets such as CT10, the strange densities
are symmetric and hence s  s. Therefore the Cabibbo-suppressed processes
gd(d) Wc(c) are the only mechanism which can lower RW+c(CT10). Assuming
that the ratios of d-quark to s-quark densities from CT10 are representative of the
data, the strange PDF asymmetry can be estimated as

where RW+c(CT10) and R
W+c(data) are the cross section ratios obtained from the
simulation and data, respectively. The uncertainty resulting on the estimation is
largely due to the data statistical component.
The conclusions which can be drawn from this measurement of the W -charge
ratio of the W +c production are: (i) the data are consistent with the hypothesis
of symmetric s/s-quark PDFs; (ii) more data would be necessary to increase the
sensitivity to the s/s-quark PDF asymmetry further.
Differential cross sections as a function of |l|
The dependence of OSSSfid (W
+ +c) and OSSSfid (W
+c) cross sections on |l |,
where l is the lepton from the W decay, is shown in figure 7.7. Similar theoretical
predictions of the |l | shapes are obtained with the six PDF sets. The predicted
distributions differ mainly in their normalisation and the predicted shapes are found
to describe that of the data.
Differential cross section as a function of the jet multiplicity
In addition to the fiducial cross section with exactly one c-jet and any number of
additional jets, the OSSSfid is measured by requiring either exactly one or exactly
two jets only one of which is identified as a c-jet. The results of the muon channel
analysis are presented in section 7.3 and have been combined with those of the
electron channel.
The fiducial cross sections as a function of the jet multiplicity are compared to
theoretical predictions in figure 7.8. The band on the data points show the sum of
statistical and systematic uncertainties. The predictions have been calculated with
both the aMC@NLO NLO generator (red solid) and the Alpgen LO generator (blue
dashed). The Alpgen simulation is described in section 4.3 and is normalised to
the inclusive W boson NNLO cross section in [69]. In the lower panel, the ratio
of the simulated distribution to data is shown.
The one-to-two-jets ratio is found to be not well described by aMC@NLO. The
prediction uncertainties due to QCD scales, parton shower and PDFs cancel out
when considering the cross section ratio. The (NNLO-normalised) prediction of

Strange-to-down PDF ratio
The measurement of the W +c production obtained from the WD() analysis is
reported in reference [1]. In this analysis, the c-quark is tagged from the hadronic
decays of D/D mesons to kaons and pions. The signal events selected in the
WD() analysis are independent to those of the Wc-jet muon and electron chan-
nel analyses. The complementary results obtained from the Wc-jet and WD()
analyses are found to be consistent.
The results of the two analyses have been combined to evaluate the strange-
to-down PDF ratio, rs(x)  [s(x) + s(x)] / 2d(x), exclusively from the ATLAS
7.6 Additional results on the W+c production 171
Wc-jet/WD() data. This calculation involves the minimisation of a 2 function
containing: (i) the measurements of the W -lepton differential cross section of the
WD() and Wc-jet analyses; (ii) the theoretical predictions obtained with HERA-
PDF1.5, in which the s-quark population in the proton sea is a floating parameter.

density over the whole x range relevant to this measurement (103 to 101).
The ATLAS Wc-jet/WD() data (yellow) instead favour a non-suppressed s-quark
PDF. Similarly, the ATLAS-epWZ12 analysis (red), which combines W and Z
boson cross sections measured by ATLAS with ep collision data from the HERA
collider, shows a symmetric composition of the light-quarks in the proton sea. The
average of the strange-to-down PDF ratio over the x phase space is found to be
s + s
= 0.96 +0.260.30 , (7.6.3)
where the energy scale is Q2 = 1.9 GeV2 and the uncertainties stem from both
172 Determination of the W +c production cross section
the measurements and the theoretical prediction. These results for rs support the
hypothesis of a symmetric composition of light-quarks of the proton sea. This
analysis results are found to be compatible with those of the ATLAS-epWZ12
analysis, which measures rs = 1.00
+0.25
0.28 from independent W and Z bosons data.
In conclusion, the measurement of the W+c production described in this thesis
is combined with those using additional W boson and c-quark decay channels. The
s-quark content of the proton is probed in the x range from 103 to 101 and with
energy scale Q2  m2W . The analysis results disfavour PDF sets where the strange
density is suppressed, supporting the hypothesis of a symmetric composition of
light-quarks in the proton sea.
The strange distribution is only loosely determined using existing nucleon-
neutrino DIS data. This measurement of the W +c production provide further
constraint for the determination of the strange quark density. Accurate determi-
nations of the parton density functions further the knowledge of the composite
structure of the proton and are important for all future analyses of LHC data. .
Conclusions
The standard model describes the nature of the electromagnetic, weak and strong
interactions to an extraordinary degree of success. However, many standard model
processes are very difficult to calculate from theory and require measurements using
experimental data. Such processes include those which enable insight into the
proton structure and those forming backgrounds to Higgs and discovery analyses.
Therefore, precision measurements of the standard model are a fundamental part of
the research programme at the LHC. One such measurement, which is the subject
of this thesis, is the production cross section of a W boson with a single charm
quark.
The W +c production is of particular interest as a probe of the strange quark
density in the proton. Flavour-symmetric strong interactions imply the same den-
sity of up, down and strange quarks in the proton sea. However, due to its larger
mass, the density of strange quarks could be suppressed relative to that of the
other light-quarks in the proton sea. The determination of the strange quark den-
sity is only loosely constrained by data. The W +c events provide additional data
to further constrain this parton density. Prior to the LHC, the W +c production
cross section could only be measured with a precision of 2030%. The larger pro-
duction rate available at the LHC provides the first opportunity to measure this
process with sufficient precision to constrain the strange quark density in the range
of x = 103  101 at Q2  m2W .
In this thesis the W + c production cross section has been measured using
4.6 fb1 of proton-proton collision data at
s = 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC. In events with a reconstructed W   decay, the charm
quark was identified using soft muon tagging, that is by its semileptonic decay to a
174 Determination of the W +c production cross section
muon within a hadronic jet. The events analysed contained at most two jets, only
one of which had to be tagged as a charm-jet. The analysis result were combined
with those obtained from W  e events. The combined results have been
compared to various theoretical predictions for the: i) strange quark density; ii) s-
and s-quark PDF asymmetry; iii) shape of the strange quark PDF; iv) perturbative
QCD calculation scheme.
The measured W +c production cross section was found to be
OSSSfid (W +c) = 70.9 1.2 (stat.)
3.6 (syst.) pb .
This result has been compared with predictions of NLO QCD calculations obtained
using various PDF sets. The data has been found to disfavour those predictions
where the density of strange quarks is suppressed relative to that of the other
light-quarks in the proton sea.
In order to investigate the s- and s-quark PDF asymmetry, the ratio of the
W ++c and W+c production cross sections has been measured. The ratio was
found to be
RW+c = 0.90 0.03 (stat.)  0.02 (syst.) ,
which is consistent with the hypothesis of symmetric s- and s-quark PDFs. How-
ever, this result shows that a larger LHC data sample is necessary to achieve the
sensitivity required by the small values of the predicted asymmetry.
Predictions for the shape of the strange quark PDF can be assessed from the
dependence of the W +c production cross section on the pseudorapidity of the
lepton from the W boson decay. The measured W +c production cross section
as a function of the pseudorapidity was found to be well described by predictions
using various PDF sets.
The dependence of the W +c production cross section on the jet multiplicity
has also been measured to test the perturbative QCD calculation scheme of the
Alpgen and aMC@NLO generators. Alpgen implements a tree-level scheme while
aMC@NLO a fixed-order scheme. The measured one-to-two-jets cross section
ratio is well described by Alpgen, but not by aMC@NLO, thereby indicating that
the tree-level scheme for the simulation of the W +c events is more accurate.

The results of the analysis presented in this thesis have also been combined
with those using complementary decay channels for the charm quark identification.
A combined measurement of the strange quark density has been determined from
the strange-to-down sea-quark PDF ratio, rs(x)  [s(x) + s(x)] / 2d(x). The
x-averaged ratio at Q2 = 1.9 GeV2 was found to be
rs = 0.96
+0.26
0.30.
This result supports the hypothesis of a symmetric composition of light-quarks in
the proton sea. This result is also in agreement with the ratio determined in a
recent QCD analysis by the ATLAS Collaboration using W and Z boson production
data.
In conclusion, this thesis describes the analysis using, for the first time, data
recorded by the ATLAS detector to measure the W +c production cross section.
The precision allows the results of this measurement to be sensitive to the strange
quark density of the proton and, as such, used to further constrain it. This advances
the knowledge of the fundamental structure of the proton, a component of every
atom of ordinary matter in the Universe.

Estimation of the multijet
background for a measurement of
the top quark pair production
This appendix presents an estimation of the multijet background for the measure-
ment of the top quark pair production cross section reported in reference [4]. The
background is estimated extending the studies of the W+c analysis (section 5.1.1).
The data-driven background estimation described here is the own work of the au-
thor and uses some inputs from the ATLAS top quark analysis group. The author
has implemented the events selection and the soft muon tagging algorithm which
are used in the analysis.
The tt cross section is measured with the pp collisions at
s = 7 TeV recorded
by ATLAS at the LHC. Top quark pair events are selected in the single-lepton
channel, and the b-quarks originating from the t-quarks decays are identified using
the SMT. The event topology is similar to that of the W + c production; the
main difference is the higher jet multiplicity of the tt events. The cross section is
measured with a total uncertainty of 10% and is to be found in agreement with
theoretical predictions and the other tt production measurements at the LHC.
Estimation of the multijet background for a measurement of the top quark pair
production
Introduction
Precision measurements of the tt production cross section, tt , are motivated
by three main reasons: (i) test theoretical predictions of perturbative QCD; (ii)
improve background estimations for measurements and searches performed at the
LHC; (iii) potentially find hints for physics processes beyond the standard model.
Moreover, the unprecedented number of tt events produced at the LHC (tens of
thousands) allows to improve of the precision achieved by the measurements at
the Tevatron.
A t-quark decays to a b-quark and a W boson. The analysis described in the
reference. exploits the tt single-lepton channel, in which one of the W bosons
decays to a muon or to an electron. Events are selected by requiring a single,
isolated, high-pT muon or electron produced in association with large E
T and
jets. The cross section is measured separately on the +jets and the e+jets
samples.
The b-quarks are identified by requiring that at least one of the selected jets
contains a soft muon. The total b  X branching ratio, which includes the
b  cX  X  sequential decay, is approximately 20%, and consequently 36% of
the tt events contain at least one b-quark decaying to a muon. The measurement
of (tt) with the SMT algorithm is complementary to those using lifetime-based
b-quark identification.
The data sample of
s = 7 TeV LHC collisions is described in section 4.1
and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.66 fb1. The event selections
of the e+jets analysis are discussed in reference [4]. The events of the +jets
analysis are selected with the requirements and physics object definitions explained
in section 4.2, and therefore are similar to those of the W +c analysis, except for:
 Triangular cut: the event selection requirement E missT +m
T > 60 GeV, which
is known as the triangular cut, substitutes that made on the W bosons
transverse mass, mWT > 60 GeV;
 Number of selected jets: events with at least 3 jets (3-jets) or at least 4
jets (4-jets) are considered, and the analysis is performed separately in the
two samples;
 Number of SMT-jets: events are required to contain at the least one SMT-
jet. The samples selected with or without this requirement are referred to
as pretag and tagged, respectively.
The cross section is calculated as
tt =
Ndata  Nbkg
L  U  BR
, (A.1)
where Ndata is the event yield selected from the data, Nbkg is the estimated back-
ground contribution, L is the integrated luminosity of the data sample (4.66fb1)
and U is the unfolding factor of the tt single-lepton channel. The branching ratio
of the the tt single-lepton channel is BR = 0.543.
Multijet background estimation for +jets analysis
The multijet production processes contribute to the background yield of the cross
section calculation. The yield of multijet events in the tagged sample, N
tagged
multijet, is
estimated with a data-driven method by multiplying the yield in the pretag sample,
pretag
multijet, for the SMT tagging rate, R
multijet :
tagged
multijet = N
pretag
multijet  R
multijet. (A.2)
The matrix method described in section 5.1.1 is used to evaluate N
pretag
multijet. Two
different sets of efficiencies, which have been measured by the ATLAS top quark
analysis group, are used to obtain two estimations of the yield. The central value of
pretag
multijet is taken as the average of the two estimations, and results in 270005400
and 6300 1300 events for the 3-jets and 4-jets, respectively. An uncertainty
of 20% covers half the difference of the two estimations and is assigned as the
systematic uncertainty on N
pretag
multijet in both samples.
The tagging rate RSMTmultijet is measured separately in two control data samples
defined as
 Inverted isolation: Itrack > 2.5 GeV and Icalo > 4 GeV;
 Inverted triangular: E missT + m
T < 60 GeV.
Estimation of the multijet background for a measurement of the top quark pair
production
All other selection criteria for the two control samples are identical to those of the
data. Figure A.1 shows the expected number of multijet events, evaluated as ex-
plained below, as a function of the W -muon isolation variables and of E missT /m
The inverted isolation and inverted triangular control samples present a large num-
ber of QCD events.

regions are displayed.
The estimated fraction of non-multijet events in the two control samples are
listed in table A.1. The inverted isolation sample has a 99% purity of multijet
events and the inverted triangular sample has 6068% of non-multijet events. The
yield of tt, W +jets and Z +jets events in the pretag and tagged 3-jets sam-
ples are estimated from simulation. 1 The number of non-multijet events from
other sources, such as the single-top and the diboson productions, is negligible.
The uncertainties include the statistical and systematic contributions. The latter
are evaluated by assigning uncertainties of 25% (section 5.1.1) and 10% (sec-
tion 5.1.4) to the W /Z +jets and tt predictions, respectively.
1The Monte Carlo simulation simulations used are described in section 4.3, and, in addition,
they are corrected for the branching ratios of the b-quark decays to a muon as described in
reference [4].

and the tagged samples. The yields for the tt, W+jets and Z+jets productions are
evaluated from simulation. The uncertainties include the statistical and the systematic
component.
The SMT tagging rate is calculated in each of the control samples as
RSMTmultijet =
(Ndata  Ntt  NW+jets  NZ+jets)tagged
(Ndata  Ntt  NW+jets  NZ+jets)pretag
, (A.3)
where Ndata, Ntt , NW+jets and NZ+jets are yields of data, tt, W +jets and Z +jets
events, respectively. The results are shown in table A.2, where the uncertainties
on the estimations obtained from the inverted isolation and the inverted triangular
samples include the statistical and the systematic contributions. The latter are
evaluated by considering uncorrelated uncertainties on Ntt , NW+jets and NZ+jets
and between the pretag and tagged events.
As explained in section 5.1.1, the different tagging rate observed in the inverted
isolation and inverted triangular samples is explained in terms of their different
content of heavy-flavour jets. The tagging rate of the two control samples is
expected to bracket that of the signal sample. Therefore, RSMTmultijet is taken as
the unweighted average of the control sample values and its uncertainty as half
the difference.
The final results for the multijet background in the muon channel analysis for
the tt cross section measurement are presented in table A.3. The uncertainty on
tagged
multijet is obtained by propagating those associated with N
pretag
multijet and R
multijet, and
results in 27% in the 3-jets sample and 29% in the 4-jets sample.

Top pair cross section results
The top pair production cross section measured in this analysis is found to be [4] :
tt = 165 2(stat) 17(syst) pb.
This result is obtained by combining the cross section measured in the +jets and
e+jets analyses, using events with 3-jets. The total uncertainty is found to be
10%, dominated by the systematic component. The most relevant contributions
to the total uncertainty arise from the estimation of the W +jets and multijet
backgrounds and from the jet energy scale.
The result obtained is in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the
QCD NNLO predictions in references [74, 94] and with the other tt cross section
measurements at the LHC. This is shown in figure A.2, where the theoretical
prediction is compared to the results of the cross sections measurements from
different ATLAS and CMS analyses [95]. The measurement here presented is that
labelled as ATLAS, l+jets, b  X in the lower part of the plot, which is found
in agreement with the theoretical predictions and the other LHC measurements
shown.

Appendix B
Kinematical distributions of the
data pretag sample
This appendix presents the distributions of several kinematical quantities for the
pretag events selected from data. The latter are compared with the predictions
obtained as the sum of W +light, W +heavy, multijet, Z +jets, top quark and
diboson events.
The W +heavy events are those originating from the W +bb, W +cc and W+c
productions. The distributions for the multijet events are evaluated from data
with the matrix method described in section 5.1.1. All the other distributions are
obtained from simulated events. The yields of W +jets events is normalised to
match that of data and the fraction of W +light events is evaluated in a data-
driven method, as described in section 5.1.2. The event yield of each process
is listed in tables 5.7 and 5.8. The 1,2-jets sample is used and, for the events
containing two jets, the leading jet is considered for the respective distributions.
The ratio of the data to predicted distributions is shown in the lower panels.
The predictions are found to be representative of the data, with differences of the
order of the percent.
