Abstract 
The route of the witness through the criminal justice system, from identification to testimony, 
has always been fraught with difficulty.  There are innumerable sources of influence, 
intimidation and manipulation which can affect a witnesss performance at any point on this 
pathway.  In recent years, and in an effort to resolve several of the issues surrounding 
witness performance, the British Government have introduced a number of legislative 
measures to improve performance at identity parades and enhance the court experience of 
vulnerable witnesses and thereby improve the quality of their testimony.  While it seems that 
these measures have been generally well received, there remain some valid questions over 
their implementation and whether they are eliciting the desired effects.   
The sequential identity parade system, V.I.P.E.R. was devised primarily as a cost-cutting 
procedural change by West Yorkshire Police in 1999. However, V.I.P.E.R.s design was 
heavily influenced by the large extant literature declaring a sequential superiority effect for 
target absent parades.  Specifically, the data claim that sequential identity parades 
significantly reduce the rate of false identifications from target absent parades whilst 
preserving hit rates for target present parades.  Yet all of the studies purporting this effect 
have used a very different procedure to that employed by V.I.P.E.R.; these studies use, and 
recommend, a strict sequential procedure whilst UK legislation requires V.I.P.E.R. parades 
to be shown twice.  Thus the effects of using a V.I.P.E.R. parade upon rates of identification 
and misidentifications have yet to be empirically investigated.  The results of this study 
revealed that there was no significant effect of parade presentation mode upon rates of 
correct identifications for target present parades or the rate of mistaken identifications in 
target absent parades.   
The next step for many witnesses is the progression of their case to trial.  The incidence of 
intimidation and vulnerability of adult witnesses appears to be increasing and so a range of 
Special Measures, more commonly used with child witnesses, were extended to adult 
witnesses who meet legislative criteria.  However, there again has been no investigation into 
the effects the use of the Special Measures for adult witnesses has upon jurors perceptions 
of that witness, the defendant and, if there is a change in perceptions, whether they are 
substantive enough to alter the trial verdict.  The current experiments revealed that the use 
of a screen does not significantly alter jurors perceptions and had no effect on conviction 
rates.  The use of live CCTV links led the witness to be perceived as less credible but again 
this did not affect the verdict.  It is the use of pre-recorded video evidence which raises the 
most concern; witnesses testifying in this manner are perceived as significantly less credible 
and believable which in turn has a significant effect upon conviction rates.   However, when 
tested in a deliberating jury group situation, all the Special Measures were associated with 
the witness being perceived as more credible compared to the control condition, although 
these differences were not significant, and there was no significant effect upon the rate of 
guilty verdicts across all conditions.   
Overall, it appears that the implementation of both of these legislative steps have had 
varying degrees of success.  While the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade procedure has reduced 
running costs it appears that there are no significant differences between V.I.P.E.R. and 
simultaneous procedures for either target present or target absent identity parades.   
Conversely, it appears that the introduction of the Special Measures for vulnerable adult 
witnesses has been largely well received and tentatively successful in reducing witness 
anxiety.  The data suggest that there are no significant negative effects associated with 
using these Special Measures, certainly under the more ecologically valid condition of the 
deliberating jury group.  Nevertheless, a series of policy recommendations have been made 
for both identity parade and testimony procedures with the aim of further enhancing the 
witnesss performance and experience through the criminal justice system.

General Introduction 
Introduction  
The route of the eye-witness through the criminal justice system is often a frightening and 
frustrating experience requiring repeated questioning, on-demand attendance at identity 
parades and a confrontational examination in court.  It is therefore not surprising that more 
than 75% of witnesses express dissatisfaction and frustration with their experience within the 
justice system (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Slater, 1995; Hoyano, 2001).  This 
discontent appears to stem from two sources; firstly witnesses and support groups 
frequently describe a sense of abandonment and lack of information from judicial 
organisations (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn, Phelps, Turtle & Sattar, 2004) 
and, secondly, frustration at the apparent lack of procedural considerations when attending 
identity parades and testifying in court (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Slater, 1995; 
Steblay, Dysart, Fulero & Lindsay, 2001; Home Office Research Study 283, June 2004; 
Wells, 2001; Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; Wheatcroft, 
Wagstaff & Kebbell, 2004).   
With regards to the first issue there is certainly evidence of a breach between witnesses and 
the justice system.  It has been recognised by the government, police and judges that all too 
often witnesses report a crime and then hear nothing further until a citation to attend court is 
delivered (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008).  This feeling of disregard often extends after 
conclusion of the trial whereby some witnesses are not even informed of the verdict and, if 
relevant, sentencing.  In recent years however, several agencies have been formed in an 
effort to address such issues, improving the witness experience whilst minimising the 
prevalent sense of neglect.  Recent review of the witness experience in British courts 
suggest that, while there have been a range of procedural improvements, there remains an 
acute lack of contact between the police and judicial services and witnesses (Richards, 
Morris & Richards, 2008; Burton, Evans & Sanders, 2006; Hamlyn et al., 2004).   
Historically the emphasis of all judicial proceedings, from investigation to trial, has been to 
ensure a fair, unbiased trial for the accused.  While such a statement holds today there is 
also an assumption of duty to protect the physical and emotional well-being of victims and 
witnesses throughout the judicial system.  Previously there was always a possibility of the 
witness encountering the accused at the identity parade or while attending court; situations 
which would understandably be intimidating, possibly terrifying, and certainly detrimental to 
the witnesss performance in these tasks (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001; Richards, Morris 
& Richards, 2008; Regan & Baker, 1998; Golding, Fryman, Marsil & Yozwiak, 2003; 
Goodman, Tobey, Batterman-Faunce, Orcutt, Thomas, Shapiro & Sachsenmaier, 1998; 
Birch, 2000; Hoyano, 2001).  Recent legislation however has eliminated the possibility of a 
chance meeting of witness and accused by revising both the format of the identity parade 
system and by providing access to protective Special Measures during testimony for the 
most severe crimes and most vulnerable of witnesses (The Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act 1984, Code D 2008; The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004, The Youth Justice 
and Criminal Evidence Act 1999).   
If we address first the change in identity parade procedures, the benefits to the witness are 
immediately evident; there is no longer any possibility of an encounter between witness and 
accused and the parade can be administered outside the police station in a more 
comfortable location for the witness (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001).  Such a step would 
undoubtedly improve the witnesss performance compared to the established, more 
traditional parade format whilst also contributing to a reduction in police expenditure and 
resources (Slater, 1995).  The switch to a sequential format has long been advocated by 
researchers (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; McQuiston-Surrett, Malpass & Tredoux, 2006; 
Gronlund, 2004; Kassin, Tubb, Hosch & Memon, 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; Wells, Small, 
Penrod, Malpass, Fulero & Brimacombe, 1998) yet, as we will later discuss, there is 
continuing debate regarding the specific conditions under which the new V.I.P.E.R. parades 
(Video Identity Parade, Electronic Recording) are superior to the more traditional, 
simultaneous parade format (Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Wells, 
2001).   
Equally, steps have been taken to improve the witness experience at court.  Appearing in 
court before the accused and a large group of strangers to deliver your testimony is an 
incredibly disquieting experience and one which often exerts an often debilitating effect upon 
witness demeanour and performance (Golding et al., 2003; Regan & Baker, 1998).  The 
introduction of The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 and the 1999 Youth Justice 
and Criminal Evidence Act in England and Wales has extended the inclusion criteria for 
witnesses who may benefit from Special Measures during testimony (Vital Voices: Helping 
Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003).  Such protective measures in the court are by 
no means a new initiative however; previously their use had been reserved for child 
witnesses or adult witnesses suffering from learning difficulties (Vital Voices: Helping 
Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003).  While these witnesses remain assured of their 
right to protective measures, the Acts have recognised the growing problem of witness 
intimidation (Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008) and 
thus permit vulnerable and/or intimidated adult witnesses to apply for special consideration 
under certain conditions (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004; Vital Voices: 
Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003).  However, the provisions now 
permitted for adult witnesses were implemented without empirically examining the effects 
that these Special Measures exert upon jurors perceptions of adult witnesses and 
defendant guilt.   
It is apparent then that the changes in identity parade and trial procedures, whilst beneficial 
from the witnesss viewpoint, has yet to be scientifically tested to fully examine the 
consequences these legislative steps have had upon the success of identity parades, the 
perceptions of jurors and the efficacy of the justice system as a whole.  It is the aim of this 
thesis to investigate the effects and determine the wider implications elicited by the change 
in identity parade format and the use of Special Measures by adult vulnerable witnesses.   
Identity Parades 
The image of an identity parade is an indelible component of our ideal criminal justice 
system and is often believed to be an integral step towards solving a crime.  Identity parades 
are frequently assumed by the public to be fair and free from biasing influences yet 
extensive research from the previous 30 years has shown such assumptions to be false 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Wells, 1984, 1993; Valentine, 2006; 
Valentine, Harris, Piera & Darling, 2003; Malpass & Lindsay, 1999; Valentine & Heaton, 
1999).  Identity parades, while valuable to the investigative process, rely upon the recall and 
recognition abilities of the eyewitness (Wells, 1984; Bruce, Henderson, Newman & Burton, 
2001; Deffenbacher, Bornstein, Penrod & McGorty, 2008; Megreya & Burton, 2008).  There 
is a vast range of factors which may influence the recognition and identification skills of the 
eyewitness but these are typically divided into two broad groups of system variables, which 
may be controlled, and estimator variables, which are typically beyond the control of the 
justice system (Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Wells, 1978; Wells & 
Olson, 2003). 
Estimator variables are factors which are beyond the control of the criminal justice system.  
Such influences include environmental factors when the crime was committed; light quality, 
distance from suspect but also extends to several more complex psychological effects such 
as the other race effect (Pezdek, Blandon-Gitlen & Moore, 2003, Sporer, 2001, Meissner & 
Brigham, 2001), the difficulty associated with unfamiliar face matching (Megreya & Burton, 
2006, Megreya & Burton, 2008, Kemp, Towell & Pike, 1997, Valentine, Darling & Memon, 
2007, Newell, Chiroro & Valentine, 1999), the presence of a weapon (Steblay, 1992, MacLin, 
MacLin & Malpass, 2001, Maass & Kohnken, 1989), the rapid decay of memory 
(Deffenbacher et al., 2008, MacLin et al., 2001) and the level of personal stress experienced 
by the witness throughout the incident (Valentine & Mesout, 2009, Morgan, Hazlett, Doran, 
Garrett, Hoyt, Thomas, Baranoski & Southwick, 2004, Deffenbacher, Bornstein, Penrod & 
McGorty, 2004).   
The probability of obtaining a successful, accurate and reliable identification from the eye-
witness declines significantly with each of the effects mentioned above.  At the root of the 
matter is the inherent difficulty in recognising and matching unfamiliar faces.  There is 
substantial evidence which supports this effect (Megreya & Burton, 2008, Kemp et al., 1997, 
Valentine et al., 2007, Megreya & Burton, 2006, Hancock, Bruce & Burton, 2000, Newell, 
Chiroro & Valentine, 1999, Bruce, Henderson, Newman & Burton, 2001) and witnessing a 
crime is the most common area we would expect to see this effect.  When a crime is 
witnessed it is relatively unlikely that the witness will have prior knowledge of the perpetrator; 
criminal acts are planned to minimise witnesses but certainly to avoid locations where the 
perpetrator is known (unless a disguise is employed).  Therefore when the eye-witness is 
placed before the parade they are being asked to recognise an unfamiliar person who they 
have only seen once previously for perhaps only a short time (Deffenbacher et al., 2008, 
MacLin et al., 2001, Memon, Hope & Bull, 2003, Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999, Read, Vokey & 
Hammersley, 1990) and under intense pressure (Morgan et al., 2004, Valentine & Mesout, 
2009, Deffenbacher et al., 2004).   
There is a compelling body of evidence to support the poor performance of witnesses when 
asked to recognise an unfamiliar face.  Kemp, Towell and Pike (1997) asked experienced 
cashiers to match shoppers currently before them to their credit card photographs and 
reported a significantly high rate of false identifications even though conditions had been 
optimised for successful identification.  This is in stark contrast to the apparent ease with 
which participants can identify familiar individuals, generating significant identification rates 
even from poor quality CCTV images which have degraded (Hancock, Bruce & Burton, 
2000, Bruce et al., 2001, Burton, Wilson, Cowan & Bruce, 1999).  It has been suggested that 
the poor performance regarding unfamiliar face matching and recognition stems from a 
difficulty in encoding the unfamiliar face whereby the unfamiliar face is not perceived as a 
face but rather as a simple pattern (Hancock et al., 2000, Megreya & Burton, 2006, 2008).  
Due to the inability to perceive the unfamiliar image as a face the specialised encoding 
strategies are not engaged and therefore lead to poor matching and recognition abilities later 
(Megreya & Burton, 2006, Wells, 1978).   
There is also a strong negative effect upon identification when the perpetrator is of a 
different race to the eye-witness (Wells & Olson, 2001, Smith, Lindsay, Pryke & Dysart, 
2001, Goldstein & Chance, 1979, Brigham & Barkowitz, 1978, Pezdek et al., 2003, Sporer, 
2001, Meissner & Brigham, 2001).  This effect is frequently associated most strongly with 
those racial groups with which the eye-witness has the least contact (Meissner & Brigham, 
2001, Wright, Boyd & Tredoux, 2003) and is often typified by the claim of They all look alike 
to me (Goldstein & Chance, 1979, Brigham & Barkowitz, 1978, Malpass, 1981, Ferguson, 
Rhodes, Lee, & Sriram , 2001, Johnson & Fredrickson, 2005).  The Other-Race Effect or 
Cross-Race Bias is a robust finding based upon significant research from across the world 
(Sporer, 2001, Meissner & Brigham, 2001, Johnson & Fredrickson, 2005, Wright et al., 
2003) and this deficit in recognition has been documented to affect eye-witnesses of all 
races (Meissner & Brigham, 2001, Wright et al., 2003).  Thus same-race faces would be 
expected to persist in the eye-witnesss memory for a longer period than a different-race 
face (Wells & Olson, 2003, Smith et al., 2001, Meissner & Brigham, 2001, Wright et al., 
2003, Ferguson et al., 2001, Pezdek et al., 2003).     
The presence of a weapon (Steblay, 1992, MacLin, MacLin & Malpass, 2001, Maass & 
Kohnken, 1989, Wells, 1978, Kramer, Buckhout & Eugenio, 1990) or additional unfamiliar 
faces further debilitates the eyewitnesss later recognition skills.  In their 2006 study, 
Megreya & Burton examined the effects of viewing more than one target face upon later 
identification of a single target face from a photo array.  Their findings show clearly that the 
rate of successful identification under these conditions was just 34% in target present 
parades and suggests that the presence of two unfamiliar faces simultaneously is 
associated with poor perceptual performance with one of the two faces always receiving 
more attention than the other.  Such a division of attention leads to poor encoding of the two 
faces and thus negative affects the eye-witnesss recognition ability.  When the study was 
repeated using a sequential, rather than simultaneous presentation, of the two unfamiliar 
target faces performance was significantly worse than that observed from the simultaneous 
experiment; a finding, which we will discuss in more depth later, corroborates data from 
sequential identity parade research (Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999).  Megreya & Burtons (2006) 
findings reveal a significant recognition disadvantage when presented with two faces 
however the cause of this effect; whether it is a result of memory failure or poor encoding, 
remains elusive.   
The weapon focus effect has been widely documented in forensic research (Steblay, 1992, 
MacLin, MacLin & Malpass, 2001, Maass & Kohnken, 1989, Wells, 1978, Kramer et al., 
1990) and is linked to the associated stress factor which can also affect eye-witness 
performance at identity parades (Valentine & Mesout, 2009, Morgan et al., 2004, 
Deffenbacher et al., 2004, Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008).  Firstly, weapon focus is the 
theory that the presence of a weapon, particularly a lethal weapon, draws eye-witness 
attention away from the perpetrators face and towards the weapon resulting in little 
encoding of the face to aid in later recognition (Yarmey & Jones, 1983, Valentine & Mesout, 
2009, Morgan et al., 2004, Deffenbacher et al., 2004, Steblay, 1992).  Indeed in their 1983 
review, Yarmey & Jones claimed that 88% of researchers believed that the presence of a 
weapon significantly reduced the likelihood of a positive identification.  Steblays 1992 meta-
analysis of nineteen studies of the weapon effect revealed a highly significant reduction in 
identification when a weapon was used in the crime.  Steblays review asserts that this effect 
is prompted by the attentional bias drawn towards the weapon which leads to a lack of 
encoding of secondary details including the facial features of the perpetrator, which prompts 
later poor performance at an identity parade.   
The presence of a weapon may also be a contributory factor to a further estimator variable 
which affects eye-witness recognition skills; stress.  The level of emotional stress 
experienced by the witness during the commissioning of the crime is thought to be a 
considerable influencing factor which debilitates identification (Morgan et al., 2004, Valentine 
& Mesout, 2009, Deffenbacher et al., 2004, Pozzulo et al., 2008).  The consensus of the 
current literature is that recognition may be severely reduced when the eye-witness 
encounters an unfamiliar face during a period of high stress, but that this is very much 
dependent upon the exact situation encountered.  This theory has been tested extensively; 
Valentine & Mesouts 2009 study took place at the London Dungeon and attempted to link 
their findings with physiological responses.  Participants were asked to wear a heart monitor 
whilst travelling through the London Dungeon and at some point they encountered an actor 
who blocked their path.  The results show a clear link between physical anxiety and 
recognition with those participants who experienced high anxiety performed significantly 
poorer on the identification task while those who were less anxious were more likely to make 
a correct identification.   
Stress and arousal has been a key factor in a number of research studies investigating 
eyewitness fidelity yet there is still no clear picture of its exact pattern of influence.  In an 
attempt to clarify the effect size and direction of stress on eyewitness memory, Deffenbacher 
et al. (2004) conducted a meta-analysis of the literature.  In his review of 34 published 
studies, Deffenbacher determined that high levels of stress during a crime incident 
negatively impacted upon both eyewitness identification accuracy and the accuracy of crime-
related details.  Specifically, the rates of correct identifications of the suspect from a culprit 
present parade was significantly reduced, leading Deffenbacher and colleagues to propose 
that high stress levels was linked with increased memory degradation which in turn leads to 
decreased ability to make a correct identification of the culprit.   A related finding of the 
meta-analysis was that studies conducted in the field, in a more ecologically valid situation, 
were associated with a greater level of perceived threat compared to those studies 
conducted in a laboratory.  Deffenbacher et al. claim that the size of the stress effect from 
laboratory based studies may be providing a significant underestimation of the incapacitating 
effects of heightened stress due to their inability to achieve stress levels observed in field 
studies.   
Clearly studies investigating the effects that estimator variables can exert upon eyewitness 
recognition abilities have produced valuable data for the forensic researcher, yet the 
applicability and relevance of such studies may be somewhat limited.  While the above 
mentioned variables are only a small selection of influencing factors it is apparent that 
estimator variables are impossible to control in a real life situation (Wells, 1978, Wells & 
Olson, 2003, Valentine 2006).  There have been suggestions in the literature that the 
research examining estimator variables could be used to formulate a quantitative estimate of 
the accuracy of any one eyewitness which can be later referenced in court or perhaps be 
employed as a cautionary guide which a psychologist would deliver to jurors before trial 
commences (Wells, 1978).  Yet such ideas have been widely discredited because there is 
little empirical evidence which suggests jurors over-believe eye-witnesses (Penrod & Cutler, 
1995, Wells & Seelau, 1995, Wells & Olson, 2003).  In fact there is significant evidence to 
suggest that jurors are not capable of recognising the limitations of eyewitnesses and their 
testimony (Wells & Olson, 2003, Wells, 1978, Quas, Thomson & Clarke-Stewart, 2005, 
McAuliff & Kovera, 2007; Semmler, Brewer & Douglass, in press).  McAuliff & Kovera (2007) 
examined the differences between expert and lay knowledge of witness suggestibility 
research.  They asked 58 expert psychologists, 157 jurors and 220 undergraduate students 
to estimate the effects of misleading information across a wide range of conditions and 
situations.  Their results demonstrated that knowledge of the adverse effects of delays, the 
positive effects of pre-misinformation warnings and age-related differences was similar 
across all participants.  The lay participants rated themselves as being unfamiliar with much 
of witness suggestibility research and felt that expert testimony in complex cases would be 
of benefit to jurors.  Such findings are most succinctly illustrated by the statistics of The 
Innocence Project.  The Innocence Project is an organisation in the United States dedicated 
to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing 
(http://www.innocenceproject.org/know/) and, to date, has successfully exonerated 268 
individuals wrongfully convicted on the basis of flawed eyewitness testimony.  Of these, 17 
had been sentenced to death before their innocence was proved and the average time spent 
in prison by the exonerees before release is 13 years.  This is perhaps the most graphic 
reminder of the fallibility of eyewitness testimony and its human cost.   
Conversely, system variables are the factors which can and should be controlled by the 
criminal justice system.  Within this group are factors such as the type of identification 
procedure employed: photo-spreads, simultaneous or sequential parades (Bromby, 2002; 
Valentine, Darling & Memon, 2007; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; 
Bruce et al., 2001; Wells, 2001; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine, 
2006; Wells, 1984; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Busey & Loftus, 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; 
Malpass & Lindsay, 1999; Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; Kemp, Pike & 
Brace, 2001); the selection of parade foils (Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Slater, 1995; Steblay 
et al., 2001; Wells & Olson, 2003; Clark & Tunnicliff, 2001; Luus & Wells, 1991); 
http://www.innocenceproject.org/know/
administration of the parade (Kemp et al., 2001; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Levi & Lindsay, 
2001; Steblay et al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006); instructions 
given to the witness (Valentine et al., 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Steblay, 1997; 
Malpass & Devine, 1981; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Wells et al., 1998) and post-
identification feedback (Douglass & McQuiston-Surrett, 2006; Lampinen, Scott, Pratt, Leding 
& Arnal, 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Charman & Wells, 2008).   
The selection of suitable foils is a significant factor which should be strictly controlled by the 
organising police force in order to ensure fairness to the suspect (Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999, 
Slater, 1995, Steblay et al., 2001, Wells & Olson, 2003, Clark & Tunnicliff, 2001, Luus & 
Wells, 1991).  Every effort should be made to locate and recruit similar individuals to 
complete the parade, which appears to be a relatively simple task, yet Slater (1995) reported 
that eye-witnesses felt that less than 50% of the foils used were similar to the target 
individual.  The selection of appropriate foils is in actuality a very difficult task for police 
forces.  If a traditional, simultaneous parade is to be used officers are constrained to 
selecting individuals from the local area who match a written description of the suspect 
(Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995).  Thus it is not surprising that foils are routinely said to be 
a poor match for the perpetrator as there are limitations to the availability of acceptable, and 
willing, foils in a local district.  This is a serious factor affecting eyewitness identification; if 
the suspect is described as very tall and the additional parade foils are all shorter than the 
suspect this would have a biasing effect upon the witnesss identification.   
Recent changes in identity parade procedures have addressed such issues with the 
introduction of the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade procedure.  As parades are no longer 
conducted live there is no need to search for locally available suitable foils; there is now a 
national database of 12,000 images which can offer a wide selection of the most appropriate 
foils.  In an additional benefit, this provision of known innocent foils from a national 
database significantly minimises the chance of a false identification progressing into a 
wrongful conviction.   
The choice of which identity parade procedure is employed is a further system variable 
which is recommended for judiciary control (Wells, 2001; Wells & Olson, 2003; Lindsay & 
Pozzulo, 1999).   Recently the sequential V.I.P.E.R. (Video Identity Parade, Electronic 
Recording) has been implemented as first-choice procedure for identity parades in the UK.   
Sequential presentation of identity parades is advocated widely in the literature with over 
80% of researchers supporting the format (Kassin, Tubb, Hosch & Memon, 2001; 
McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Valentine et al., 2007).  While simultaneous identity parades 
are recognised to elicit a significant rate of correct identifications for target present parades, 
they are also associated with a significant rate of false identifications for target absent 
identity parades (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon 
& Gabbert, 2003; Wells, 2008, 1993; Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 1998; Kassin et 
al., 2001; Gronlund, 2004).  Conversely, there is a substantial body of evidence which claims 
that sequential presentation of an identity parade significantly reduces the false positive rate, 
and therefore improves the rate of correct rejections, for target absent parades whilst 
maintaining the hit rate for target present parades (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Wells, 2008, 1993; Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 
1998; Kassin et al., 2001; Gronlund, 2004).  Thus it is of apparent benefit, without any 
caveats, that a sequential format be implemented unwaveringly throughout the criminal 
justice system (Steblay et al., 2001; Valentine, 2006; Wells, 2001; Wells et al., 1998).   
However, such a recommendation would be enhanced by the effective control of parade 
administration over two levels; blind administration (Kemp et al., 2001; Tredoux & Chiroro, 
2006; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 
2006) and witness instructions (Valentine et al., 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Steblay, 
1997; Malpass & Devine, 1981; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Wells et al., 1998).  It has 
previously been common that the administration of the identity parade was performed by a 
member of the investigating team.  Clearly there is a conflict of interest here whereby the 
administrating officer may have a preconceived suspicion of guilt going into the parade and 
may therefore, consciously or subconsciously, influence the decision of the witness (Wells et 
al., 1998; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay, 1997).  It has been extensively suggested 
in research over the last thirty years that administration of all identity parades, regardless of 
the format employed, should be double blind; that the administrating officer is not aware of 
the presence of any suspect at the time of the parade (Levi & Lindsay, 1999; Wells, 2001; 
Steblay et al., 2001; Wells, 1993; Lindsay & Wells, 1985).   
In recent years there has been a significant degree of controversy over the field testing of 
double-blind testing in Illinois.  A unique opportunity arose in 2002 as the Illinois State 
Government proposed to issue a report that aimed to determine why the state had such a 
high number of wrongful convictions and looked to reform the Illinois criminal justice system 
in the light of the reports findings.  Flawed eyewitness testimony was to form a significant 
part of this report due its well-documented fallibility.  Sherri Mecklenburg was approached to 
conduct a large-scale investigation into the effectiveness of the sequential, double-blind 
procedure in a year-long pilot study conducted in conjunction with three regional police 
departments.  The results of this study, published in 2006, claimed that these first field tests 
of the sequential, double-blind procedure were associated with a lower rate of correct 
identifications of the suspect in target present parades but also with a higher rate of known 
false identifications (Mecklenburg, 2006).   Immediately there was a furore surrounding the 
conclusions of the report and serious questions were raised by researchers concerning the 
methodologies employed whilst others proclaimed it a wasted opportunity (Wells, 2006; 
Steblay, 2006; Schacter et al., 2008; Steblay, 2008; 2010).  While the sequential parades 
had been run double-blind, the simultaneous parades, the control group, had not been 
(Mecklenburg, 2006; Steblay, 2010; Wells, 2006; Steblay, 2006; Schacter, Dawes, Jacoby, 
Kahneman, Lempert, Roediger & Rosenthal, 2008).  This was not the extent of the problems 
however; Nancy Steblay obtained the empirical data from one of the testing cities (Evanston) 
and conducted her own review and analysis of Mecklenburgs (2006) data.  Steblay reported 
some startling methodological differences between the sequential and simultaneous 
parades.  Whilst the sequential format was comprehensively scripted the simultaneously 
parades were subjected to no efforts of standardisation across participants.  The 
simultaneous parades were not administered double-blind but also were more likely to use 
witnesses that had already identified the suspect in an earlier identity parade, were more 
likely to use witnesses who had a prior relationship with the suspect and the delay between 
event and recall were much shorter.  Steblay (2010) asserts that the Mecklenburg field 
studies were not an effective strategy to empirically investigate the effectiveness of the 
double-blind, sequential format; a conclusion shared by many researchers (Wells, 2006; 
Schacter et al., 2008; Steblay, 2006) including a seven person committee of several 
prominent researchers (Schacter et al., 2008).  Yet it must be noted that the Mecklenburg 
Report (2006) is not without its support; Ross & Malpass (2008) conducted their own review 
of the findings of the report and determined that the absence of the double-blind 
administration in the simultaneous parades is not a debilitating as other researchers claim 
(Steblay, 2010; Wells, 2006; Steblay, 2006; Schacter et al., 2008) and that confounds exist 
in laboratory based studies as well as field studies.  Instead, Ross & Malpass assert that the 
Illinois Field Tests are wrongly interpreted as a conclusive means to resolve the 
Simultaneous/Sequential debate; they recognise that the methodology was flawed and that 
future field studies must be based upon detailed information from the actual practical use of 
identity parades and from the case files.  The two opposing groups of this continuing 
controversy regarding double-blind administration is united on one point however; that 
continuing arguments over past field studies is counter-productive and that the same 
urgency be applied to developing future research to resolve the issues surrounding double-
blind administration of identity parades.   
The issue of double-blind identity parades have been resolved with the implementation of 
the V.I.P.E.R. procedure.  The administration of V.I.P.E.R. parades is handled by a team of 
dedicated parade officers from selection of foils to delivering the parade to witnesses (The 
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D 2008) and it is specified in law that the 
administrating officer may not be a member of the investigating team.  Equally it is enshrined 
in law that the administrating officer, in their instructions to the witness, must highlight that 
the perpetrator may not be present in the parade (The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 
(1984) Code D, 2008).  Such instruction is designed to counter-act the implicit priming said 
to be associated with attending an identity parade (Wells, 1993); They must have caught the 
guy if they want me to come to an identity parade which can encourage the eyewitness 
towards making an identification even thought the perpetrator may not be present.   
The effect of Post-Identification Feedback has been extensively researched and it is a widely 
accepted theory that providing feedback upon witness performance at an identity parade can 
significantly interfere with retrospective judgements and confidence (Douglass & McQuiston-
Surrett, 2006; Lampinen et al., 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Charman & Wells, 2008; 
Douglass & Steblay, 2006; Dixon & Memon, 2005).  The standard guidelines for best 
practice at identity parades, as advocated by the research community (Wells et al., 1998; 
Wells, 2001; Levi & Lindsay, 1999; Steblay et al., 2001; Luus & Wells, 1994) includes 
obtaining a statement of witness confidence in their identification at the time of the parade.  
However, it has been expressly shown that even a casual, confirmatory comment from the 
administrating officer can have an enormous effect upon the eyewitnesss later confidence 
reports but can also affect witnesses reflections upon their own performance, boosting their 
apparent skill at recognising the perpetrator (Douglass & McQuiston-Surrett, 2006; 
Lampinen et al., 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Charman & Wells, 2008; Douglass & 
Steblay, 2006; Bradfield & Wells, 2005).  Thus witnesses who are given positive feedback 
often claim to have immediately recognised the suspect (Wells & Bradfield, 1998; Bradfield 
& Wells, 2005; Lampinen et al., 2006; Wells, Olson & Charman, 2002), to have required 
minimal time to make an identification (Lampinen et al., 2007; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; 
Douglass & Steblay, 2006) and to have a strong general ability to recognise unfamiliar faces 
(Douglass & Steblay, 2006).  In their 2006 meta-analysis Douglass & Steblay analysed data 
from 14 studies and reported that participants who received confirmatory feedback rated 
their confidence in their decision significantly higher than those who received no feedback.  
In addition, the participants who were given feedback were significantly more likely to claim 
a special ability to recognise faces, that they had an enduring image of the perpetrators face 
and to report their recognition as immediate.  Therefore we can see that such an effect 
would have a serious result if the witness identified an innocent individual and then received 
positive feedback; potentially causing a miscarriage of justice.   
Douglass & Steblay (2006) thus recommend that a fully blind procedure is used in identity 
parades whereby the administrating officer should have no prior knowledge if the suspect is 
present in the parade to eliminate any possibility of the witness receiving feedback after an 
identification has been made; a conclusion supported by many researchers (Wells et al., 
1998; Lampinen et al., 2006; Douglass & McQuiston-Surrett, 2006; Wells, 1993; 2001; Levi 
& Lindsay, 1999; Steblay et al., 2001; Luus & Wells, 1994; Bradfield & Wells, 1998; 2005; 
Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Wells, Olson & Charman, 2002).   
The final system variable that the judicial system is strongly advised to control is the 
retention interval between witnessing a crime and attending an identity parade (Wells, 1978; 
Wells & Olson, 2003; Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001).  It is proven that memory and 
recognition begins to decay immediately after exposure ends (Ebbinghaus, 1885; 
Deffenbacher et al., 2004; Ebbesen & Rienick, 1998; Kemp et al., 2001; Bromby, 2002; 
Dunning & Stern, 1992; Christianson, 1992).  Memory decay is typically Ebbinghausian in 
nature, forgetting at a startling rate over the first 24 hours and before beginning to level off 
around 2 days after exposure (Deffenbacher et al., 2004; Ebbinghaus, 1885).  Thus there is 
an obvious pressing need to organise and conduct identity parades as soon as possible 
after the incident.  We can say then that the retention interval associated with traditional 
simultaneous parades, averaging ten weeks (Valentine, 2006; Valentine, Pickering & 
Darling, 2003) between encoding and recall, is liable to be associated with particularly poor 
performance.  In contrast, the sequential format has an average retention interval of ten 
days (Valentine et al., 2003), although can be assembled in hours; which, while still not 
ideal, would most likely be associated with greater performance at the identity parade.  Of 
course, delay is one system variable which, despite best efforts, cannot always be 
adequately controlled.  In addition to the time delay involved in composing the identity 
parades, outlined above, the key point at which delay cannot be controlled is the interval 
between the criminal event and the witness coming forward to the police.  Therefore, any 
identity parade procedure which may reduce further lag between event and retrieval would 
be greatly beneficial.   
It is easy to see then that research into system variables and their effect upon eyewitness 
identification is of greatest applicability to the criminal justice system (Wells, 1978; Wells & 
Olson, 2003; Valentine, 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999).  While estimator variables are very 
difficult to control, and research into these variables is of perhaps less benefit to 
practitioners, research into system variables may yet yield some directions to bypass the 
uncontrollability of estimator variables and thus further improve the identity parade 
procedures (Wells, 1978; 1984; Wells & Olson, 2003).  While many of the system variables 
have been addressed with the recent introduction of the sequential V.I.P.E.R. parade 
procedure it is important that we first assess the older, simultaneous identity parade 
procedure; its benefits and its limitations.  
Traditional Identity Parades 
The enduring image; eight similar individuals lined up, side-by-side behind mirrored glass, is 
no longer wholly accurate when called to view an identity parade.  This simultaneous format 
has been employed worldwide certainly for the last century and has only been replaced in 
the UK within the last ten years despite growing claims for a sequential procedure from the 
early 1980s (Levi, 1998; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; McQuiston-Surrett et 
al., 2006; Kassin et al., 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995; Valentine, 2006; Valentine 
et al., 2007; Wells et al., 1998).  So why were police procedures changed after 30 years of 
research?  Traditional parades are acknowledged as an excellent procedure for obtaining an 
identification but only when the perpetrator is present in the line-up (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; 
Wells, 1993; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay et al., 2001; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; 
Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Levi & Lindsay, 2001).  This success is claimed to be due to the 
judgement style simultaneous presentation engenders; a relative judgement style where the 
eye-witness compares the parade members across each other whilst comparing them 
individually to their memory of the perpetrator (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Tredoux & Chiroro, 
2006; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; 
Steblay et al., 2001; Valentine et al., 2006; Gronlund, 2004).  When the suspect is present 
therefore, this is a reasonable manner of processing and matching the best-fit face with the 
witnesss memory.  However, this judgement style is claimed to be the source of the serious 
mis-identification rate that traditional parades elicit when the suspect is not present in the 
line-up (Valentine, 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; McQuiston-Surrett et 
al., 2006; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Wells, 2008).  By making a relative judgement the eye-
witness is identifying an innocent foil, an identification which can lead to severe 
repercussions for the innocent accused and the criminal justice system.  A false positive 
identification in a traditional, simultaneous parade can frequently lead to prosecution, 
particularly if the eye-witness is the only evidence source, because there is no system in 
place where the administrating police officer can be absolutely certain that the recruited foils 
are innocent (Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Valentine, 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995; 
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D 2008) and thus discount a false 
positive identification.   
While the traditional format is superior for target present parades from a policing viewpoint, 
there are a great many other issues regarding their use; namely the sheer expense and 
demand on resources they require.  As traditional identity parades are carried out in a local 
police station the pool of available, and appropriate, foils is substantially narrowed.  This 
then requires a significant undertaking to locate and recruit suitable foils every time an 
identity parade is organised, taking police resources from more serious issues.  Not only is 
this a drain on personnel resources but also financially; each recruited foil is paid 15 for the 
first hour and 5 for each subsequent hour they are in attendance (West Yorkshire Police).   
The costs to the organising police force may be compensated in some fashion by the 
successful administration of the parade, frequently however this is not the case.  Slater 
(1995) reported that at least 50% of all traditional identity parades were cancelled prior to 
administration, primarily due to witness concerns over coming face-to-face with the 
perpetrator (Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995; Valentine, 2006).  
The extensive organising process required for traditional identity parades is the primary 
contributory factor to the often lengthy retention interval between incident and recall.  While 
this interval is an average of ten weeks it can frequently be longer.  As discussed earlier 
such a prolonged delay is counter-productive to eye-witness performance (Wells, 1978; 
Wells & Olson, 2003; Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001; Ebbinghaus, 1885; Deffenbacher et 
al., 2004; Ebbesen & Rienick, 1998; Kemp et al., 2001; Bromby, 2002; Dunning & Stern, 
1992; Christianson, 1992; Valentine, 2006; Valentine et al., 2003).  This, in combination with 
the relative judgement style fostered by simultaneous presentation, may serve to hinder the 
witnesss ability to recognise that the perpetrator is not present thus resulting in a mis-
identification.   
Due to these limitations associated with traditional, live, simultaneous identity parades, West 
Yorkshire Police devised a sequential, video-based identity parade format, V.I.P.E.R., to 
improve the witnesss experience and performance whilst addressing the general drain upon 
resources.   
Video Identity Parades 
Sequential, video identity parades began to be used in the UK in 1999 and within 6 years 
they were widely used across most British police forces.  Legislative measures have placed 
V.I.P.E.R. identity parades as the preferred method for eyewitness identification, to be used 
in all conditions unless there is some constraint which makes this impossible (The Police 
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D 2008; Valentine et al., 2007).   
It is important to note that V.I.P.E.R. is not simply a sequential presentation of static images, 
photos or even live individuals.  V.I.P.E.R. is the sequential presentation of moving video 
images of a set of similar individuals.  It is of course possible to present video clips of faces 
simultaneously just as it is possible to present live identity parades sequentially.  These 
possible identity parade formats are not permitted under UK law and are not investigated in 
the current studies.  The current legislative procedure approved for use in the United 
Kingdom is the V.I.P.E.R. parade which presents video images to the eyewitness on a 
sequential basis.   
A V.I.P.E.R. parade sequentially presents individual video clips of faces to the eyewitness on 
a computer screen.  The parade can be administered anywhere; in a police station, hospital, 
or residence at a time convenient to the witness.  The judgement style fostered by 
sequential presentation is not a relative judgement but rather an absolute judgement style 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et 
al., 2001; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Kneller, Memon & Stevenage, 
2001; Wells et al., 1998; Clark & Davey, 2005).  An absolute judgement style removes the 
witnesss ability to compare across parade members and instead forces the witness to 
compare each parade member with their memory of the perpetrator before making a 
decision (Wells, 1984; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay et al., 2001; 
Wells et al., 1998).  As with traditional identity parades, it is the judgement style employed 
which appears to drive the success of V.I.P.E.R. parades as they are claimed to preserve 
the hit rate for target present parades associated with simultaneous parades (Lindsay & 
Wells, 1985; Steblay et al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; Wells, 2008; Valentine, 2006).  Although 
there is suggestive evidence that V.I.P.E.R. parades slightly reduce correct identifications 
(Wells, 2008; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay et al., 2001), there is strong evidence that 
sequential presentation of identity parades significantly reduces the number of false 
identifications from target absent parades (Wells, 1984; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Steblay et 
al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Gronlund, 2004).   
Not only does V.I.P.E.R. have these psychological benefits for eyewitness performance it 
has also improved the procedural and economic aspects for operating police forces.  These 
advantages are namely a decrease in resources; admittedly there is a large, but necessary, 
expenditure to buy the recording suite hardware and ensure appropriate staff training yet 
after this initial outlay the costs involved are minimal (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001; 
Valentine, 2006).  With V.I.P.E.R. there are no longer any constraints upon recruiting 
appropriate foils; there is a large central database of images (currently using approximately 
12,000 video clips) which will select a range of foils deemed to match a written description of 
the suspect, and provide them to the organising officer to select the most suitable for 
inclusion (The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D, 2008; Valentine & Heaton, 
1999; Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995).  One of the most important effects of using foils 
from the database is that the chances of an innocent foil being prosecuted from a false 
identification are drastically reduced (Valentine & Heaton, 1999) as these foils are known to 
be innocent.  Thus, V.I.P.E.R. parades are seen as fairer than simultaneous parades 
(Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Valentine, 2006; Steblay et al., 2001).  This central database of 
approximately 12,000 images from across the United Kingdom has also reduced police 
expenditure on foils attendance.  There are widely publicised recording schemes and those 
individuals who attend are paid a one-off fee of 15.  Their image is then added to the 
database and may be repeatedly used for parade construction across the United Kingdom.   
Finally, perhaps the most important added psychological benefit to witness performance is 
that the retention interval associated with V.I.P.E.R. parades is significantly shorter than that 
seen with traditional parades, averaging around ten days between incident and recall 
(Valentine, 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995; Valentine et al., 2003).  While such a 
delay is still liable to memory decay it should not be as significantly impaired as it would be 
after ten weeks (Deffenbacher et al., 2004; Ebbinghaus, 1885; Wells & Olson, 2003; 
Ebbesen & Rienick, 1998; Kemp et al., 2001; Bromby, 2002; Dunning & Stern, 1992; Wells, 
1978; Christianson, 1992).   
So what is the evidentiary support for each of these two types of identity parade?  The 
literature supporting simultaneous superiority for target present parades is certainly 
voluminous (Levi, 1998; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Valentine et al., 2007; 
Steblay et al., 2001; Pike et al., 2000; Valentine, 2006; Wells et al., 1998; Kemp et al., 2001; 
Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay, Dysart & Wells, 2011) and pervading; from Lindsay & 
Wells initial 1985 study comparing simultaneous and sequential identity parades there has 
been a general acceptance that, when the suspect is present in the parade, it is beneficial to 
employ a simultaneous procedure.  This advantage certainly appears to be consistent; 
Steblay, Dysart, Fulero & Lindsays 2001 meta-analysis investigated over four thousand data 
points from nine published and thirteen unpublished studies and reported the simultaneous 
parade format to elicit a correct identification rate of 50% for target present parades 
compared with a rate of just 35% for sequential parades.  Although neither of these hit rates 
is particularly good the data shows that simultaneous parades are 30% better than the 
sequential parades under these conditions.  However, this pattern is reversed when the 
suspect is not present in the identity parade.  Steblay et al. (2001) found that an innocent foil 
is identified, on average, in 27% of simultaneous identity parade compared with a rate of just 
9% when a sequential format is employed.   
There have been challenges to Steblay et al.s (2001) findings in recent years; Carlson, 
Gronlund & Clark (2008) designed an experiment to exactly replicate the original research 
which reported the sequential superiority advantage (Lindsay & Wells, 2001) with only one 
change to how the foils were selected.  The authors assumed that the original research had 
used a biased line-up which appeared to lead to the designated innocent foil being selected 
almost as frequently as the culprit in target present parades (43% versus 58%).  Carlson et 
al. ensured that the selected foils were a close match in similarity to both their culprit and 
designated innocent foil so as to present a fair, unbiased parade.  Despite hypothesising that 
their results would yield evidence for the sequential parade advantage, the data revealed 
there to be no significant difference in the rate of correct rejections for target absent 
parades.  The authors suggested that this is evidence that the sequential superiority effect 
only becomes evident when the identity parade is biased or when the suspect is presented 
late in the parade sequence.    
In their 2011 meta-analysis, Steblay, Dysart & Wells examined data from 72 studies from 23 
labs worldwide totalling 13,000 participants and again reported that the sequential identity 
parade significantly reduced the number of mistaken identifications from target absent 
parades whilst the simultaneous format is associated with significantly more correct 
identifications for target absent parades.  However, the authors did re-clarify what they 
meant by superiority; stating that it is a higher diagnositicity ratio which indicates how much 
more likely one event is in relation to another.  As a result of their meta-analysis, they 
claimed that the sequential parades had a diagnositicity of 7.72 compared with 5.78 for the 
simultaneous parades.  Thus the evidence shows a clear benefit to the judicial system when 
sequential parades are employed for target absent identity parades, although there is a 
decrease in the number of correct identifications associated with this format when the 
perpetrator is present in the parade.   
This effect has been replicated in more recent studies; Memon & Gabberts 2003 study 
again found that sequential parades were associated with fewer identifications, of either 
suspect or foil, overall.  Despite this evident disadvantage, Wells has claimed that Steblay et 
al.s 2001 meta-analysis suggests that an identification obtained from a sequential parade is 
twice as likely to be strong evidence of suspect guilt compared to an identification made 
during a simultaneous identity parade (Wells, 2001) and it is because of this point that the 
sequential identity parade is recommended by over 80% of the published authors (Kassin et 
al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006).    
While there is a growing body of evidence to support this notion of Sequential Superiority 
(Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Levi, 1998; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-
Surrett et al., 2006; Wells, 2001; Wells et al., 1998, Carlson et al., 2008) it is also important 
to note that there are a range of limitations associated with this theory and some issues 
regarding the validity of the extant literature (Steblay et al., 2001; Wells, 1993; 2001; 
McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006).    It is recognised by the initial proponents of the sequential 
procedure that the current literature has not definitively defined the exact conditions under 
which sequential identity parades can be said to be resolutely superior over simultaneous 
parades (Wells, 1993; 2001; 2008; Levi & Lindsay, 2001), an issue still under contention in 
the most recent papers (Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et 
al., 2006; Valentine et al., 2007; Valentine, 2006; Wells et al., 1998).  The primary debate 
appears to stem from the, as yet unspecified, origins of the sequential superiority effect: is it 
driven by the specific type of judgement strategy employed or is it a shift in recognition 
criteria?  (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Gronlund, 2004; Meissner et 
al., 2005; Kneller et al., 2001).     
The prevalent hypothesis has been that of a differing judgement style fostered by each 
identity parade format; relative judgements with simultaneous parades and absolute 
judgements with sequential parades (Wells & Lindsay, 1984; Wells et al., 1998; Steblay et 
al., 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006).  Such terminology was 
first used by Wells (1984) yet its evidential basis is derived purely from unreliable self-
reports from participants and observational analysis that, in target absent simultaneous 
parades, witnesses typically lean towards selecting another foil rather than electing to reject 
the entire parade (Wells, 1993).  Of the 54% of witnesses who correctly identified the 
suspect in the target present parade 43% went on to make a false identification in the target 
absent parade; a step frequently termed target-to-foil shift (Clark & Davey, 2005) and is 
claimed to be indicative of relative judgements whereby, in the absence of the suspect, the 
next best matching foil is identified (Clark & Davey, 2005; Steblay et al., 2001, Lindsay & 
Wells, 1985, McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006, Gronlund, 2004).   This is particularly an issue 
for V.I.P.E.R. identity parades where the closeness of match between the suspect and the 
foils is much close than in live identity parades.  In their 1999 study, Valentine & Heaton 
assessed the fairness of V.I.P.E.R. in comparison to the traditional, live format.  If an identity 
parade is completely fair then each individual within the parades has an equally chance of 
being selected (Valentine, 2006).  Working from a parade size of 1 suspect and 8 foils, this 
equated to the suspect being selected by 11% of participants.  Valentine and Heaton tested 
both the V.I.P.E.R. format and the simultaneous format for fairness using 216 participants.  
Their results illustrated that the suspect was identified by 25% of participants, indicating that 
they were selected more frequently than the 8 foils; thus suggesting that the simultaneous 
parades were not fair and were biased towards the suspect.  By comparison, the suspect 
was selected by 15% of participants who viewed the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade.   Further 
analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in fairness between the V.I.P.E.R. 
and simultaneous parade types; that V.I.P.E.R. was significantly fairer to the suspect than 
the simultaneous format.  Most importantly however, although the V.I.P.E.R. parade format 
was associated with a greater probability of the suspect being selected by the mock 
witnesses, this was not significantly different from the expected chance levels (15% versus 
11%).  The results of this study provide firm evidence that the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade is 
significantly fairer to suspects and significantly less biased compared to the simultaneous 
format.   
As sequential identity parades are typically associated with higher accuracy rates for target 
absent conditions and this format is claimed to rely upon an absolute judgement style this 
appears to be further support for the judgement style hypothesis.  It is this evidence and that 
from other corroborating studies (Kneller et al., 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett 
et al., 2006; Gronlund, 2004) which have led to the judgement style hypothesis becoming 
widely accepted within the literature.  
Yet there are some indications that the target-to-foil shift does also occur for sequential 
parades when the suspect is absent from the identity parade.  In their 2005 study, Clark & 
Davey investigated this phenomenon in both target present and target removed parades.  
They hypothesised that the effect would occur for simultaneous parade but that it would be 
diminished or absent from the sequential parade because of the diminishing use of relative 
judgement styles with this format.  While their data further corroborated the overall 
advantage for sequential identity parades they also found evidence that the target-to-foil shift 
was equal for both simultaneous and sequential parades.  Such a result suggests that when 
the target is removed from the suspect witnesses are equally as likely to gravitate towards 
identifying an innocent foil regardless of the parade format employed.  This data is of vital 
importance to understanding the underlying cognitive processes of eyewitness judgement 
styles and is a clear indicator that further research is necessary to explore exactly how 
eyewitness identification is elicited cognitively and to determine the exact judgement style 
employed by witnesses in both identity parade formats.   
There have also been some claims that the sequential superiority effect may be underpinned 
by a shift in recognition criteria rather than the judgement style used by witnesses 
(McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Meissner et al., 2005; Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002).  The basis 
of this hypothesis arises from the procedural differences between the simultaneous and 
sequential format.  In the format currently recommended by the research community, 
sequential parades are essentially a forced choice task: the images are presented 
sequentially but, crucially, the eye-witness must make a decision before the parade can 
proceed (Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; Wells, 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; 
Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine et al., 2007).  Thus, the eyewitness is required to either 
accept the current image as the suspect or reject it entirely and view the next image.  It is 
proposed then that, as there is no possibility of comparing parade members, witnesses must 
evaluate whether the current image is sufficiently similar enough to their memory of the 
suspect or whether they should reject this image in case a subsequent image proves to be a 
stronger match (Valentine et al., 2007; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; 
Gronlund, 2004; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999).  
Clark & Garvey (2005) found some evidence of there being a shift in recognition criteria: 
when the suspect was removed from the identity parade some witnesses downgraded their 
recognition criteria in order to make an identification.  However, while this is valuable 
evidence that recognition criteria can be altered between parade formats it is suggesting a 
converse effect to that observed in other studies.  Many of these studies have suggested 
that the sequential format leads eyewitnesses to become more conservative in their 
identifications (Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; 
Kneller et al., 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003) which would account for the widespread effect 
of reducing both false positive identifications and correct identifications.   
Some corroborating data for this can be found in Memon & Gabberts 2003 study where they 
report that their participants were more likely to not make an identification during sequential 
target present parades.  Ebbesen & Flowe (2002) also concluded that the use of sequential 
identity parades encourages witnesses to adopt a more conservative recognition criterion 
and, in their 2005 study, Meissner, Tredoux, Parker & MacLin employed a series of 
experiments based on signal detection theory, results of which appear to confirm that 
sequential identity parades are associated with a more conservative criterion.   
This judgement style vs. criterion shift debate remains on-going and further research is 
certainly needed to resolve this issue but there is a more pressing concern regarding the 
procedural validity of the majority of simultaneous vs. sequential studies.  As mentioned 
previously, the sequential format employed across many of the current studies adheres to a 
truly sequential procedure as advocated by many researchers (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 
2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi, 1998; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Levi 
& Lindsay 2001; Kassin et al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; Valentine et al., 2007; Valentine, 
2006; Wells & Olson, 2003).  This strict procedure requires that the images be sequentially 
presented but that the eyewitness must make a decision; accept or reject.  If the current 
image is identified as the suspect then the parade is immediately halted and no further 
images are shown.  If the witness rejects the current image the subsequent images are 
shown.  The witness must not be told how many images they will see and once an image 
has been rejected it cannot be accepted at a later time (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & 
Pozzulo, 1999; Wells et al., 1998; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; 
Valentine, 2006).  Finally, double blind administration is also required under this strict format 
to escape any possible bias (Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Wells, 1993; 2001; Wells et al., 1998; 
Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Valentine et al., 2007; Valentine, 2006; Valentine & Heaton, 1999; 
Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Kassin et al., 2001); the provisions of 
PACE Code D allow for double-blind presentation.    
This strict sequential procedure represents a problem, certainly to UK researchers, as the 
V.I.P.E.R. identity parade procedure is bound by the limitations of Code D of The Police & 
Criminal Evidence Act (1984), which explicitly states that all images contained within a 
V.I.P.E.R. parade be shown to the witness at least twice before they can make an 
identification or reject the parade (Valentine, 2006; The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 
1984, Code D 2008).  Additionally, the Act permits individual images to be examined in more 
detail by the witness if so required (The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Code D 
2008).  With regards to double blind administration this is required and executed, as many 
British police forces have a team of dedicated V.I.P.E.R. officers who each administer 
different steps of the parade to ensure double-blind presentation.   
This procedural difference between the sequential parades of the literature and the UK 
V.I.P.E.R. is a key point in this thesis; much of the existing literature laments that the precise 
conditions under which sequential superiority is achieved remains unknown despite 
extensive research.  This is primarily because of the range of factors that have been 
investigated and the divergent methodologies employed; there has been little effort to 
standardise exactly what is meant by a sequential identity parade.  The large majority of the 
extant literature has focussed on the benefits of a strict sequential procedure and so the 
results of such research cannot be fully generalised to the UK V.I.P.E.R. parade; for 
V.I.P.E.R. is not a strict sequential procedure.  We have already noted that UK legislation 
stipulates that witnesses must view the entire parade twice before being permitted to make 
and identification.  Furthermore, V.I.P.E.R. parades make allowances for witnesses to re-
visit any of the parade individuals repeatedly, to pause and examine the image in detail and 
to allow witnesses to change their minds about a previous identification (The Police & 
Criminal Evidence Act (1984), Code D (2008)).  So it appears that the sequential, video-
based identity parade format of V.I.P.E.R. has yet to be investigated in its current British 
format.   
Thus, the theories based upon the extant literature, while useful to a degree, are based upon 
a procedure which would not be permissible under UK law.  V.I.P.E.R. is clearly an entirely 
different procedure to that employed by many research papers which have tested the 
sequential advantage.  To date, there has been only one published study which has tested 
V.I.P.E.R. as it is currently applied in the United Kingdom.  This paper investigated whether 
strict pre-parade instructions or moving images increased the reliability of the sequential 
V.I.P.E.R format and is reviewed in more detail later in this thesis.   
It is therefore evident that there is an urgent need for investigations of the effects provoked 
by the V.I.P.E.R. format to determine whether a similar effect to that widely reported in the 
literature is elicited: that simultaneous parades are superior for target present identity 
parades while sequential is superior for target absent parades. 
Special Measures for Vulnerable Witnesses 
The next stage for many eye-witnesses is the progression of their case to trial; this 
experience is recognised by many researchers and witness support groups to be very 
traumatic, especially if they have been subjected to intimidation (Tarling, Dowds & Budd, 
2000; Fyfe & McKay, 2000; Editorial Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004).  In an effort to 
improve the witness experience of this stage of the criminal justice system, several 
consultations were begun to investigate the causes of witness anxiety and how this could be 
ameliorated to the benefit of both witnesses and the justice system.  It is patently clear that if 
a witness is exceptionally nervous about testifying in court the quality of their testimony will 
be severely compromised (Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; 
Golding et al., 2003; Goodman et al., 1998; Swim et al., 1993) which in turn may affect the 
jurors perceptions of that witness and could significantly influence the outcome of the trial 
(Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Vital 
Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003).   
Research investigating the effects of different factors upon jurors perceptions and decision-
making processes face a difficult task.  By their very nature, juries and their deliberations are 
highly confidential; this means that researchers cannot utilise actual deliberating jury groups 
for their studies.  Certainly after the conclusion of the trial the jurors can be approached and 
asked to recount their memories of the events and processes that occurred during 
deliberation but these types of self-report measures are often biased and do not yield a 
complete picture of the true nature of deliberations (Tinsley, 2001; Zander & Henderson, 
1993; Jackson, 1996).  Other researchers have attempted to use shadow juries as their 
participants (McCabe & Purves, 1974).  These shadow juries involve recruiting a group of 
participants and exposing them to exactly the same trial evidence as the actual jury.  To this 
end, the shadow jury group are required to attend court for each and every day of the 
selected trial to sit in the public gallery and listen to the testimony and view the evidence, 
before being committed to deliberations as the actual trial jury would be.  Of course, the 
issues involved in such a research design are apparent; ensuring that every participant 
attends court every day, requiring them to commit to a study which lasts several hours for an 
undefined period and then requiring them to deliberate on what they have hear during that 
time.  It is not surprising that this type of jury research is rare and in response to these 
issues, jury researchers have been compelled to devise an alternative methodology for 
studying jurors perceptions and decision-making.  This has become known as the mock 
juror paradigm.   
The mock juror paradigm involves recruiting participants eligible for jury duty and exposing 
them to a mock, or simulated, trial.  This methodology of jury research has been widely 
adopted (Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Swim et al., 1993, Davies & Noon, 
1991; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Landstrom et al., 2005, 2008; Hope, Greene, Memon, Gavisk & 
Houston, 2008; Tinsley, 2001; Pennington & Hastie, 1990; Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Quas, 
Thompson & Clarke-Stewart, 2005; Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008; Bornstein, 1999; 
Nemeth, 1981; Kramer, Kerr & Carroll, 1990; Hastie, Penrod & Pennington, 1983; Carlson & 
Russo, 2001; Blamey, McCarthy & Smith, 2000).  Typically, the mock juror participants are 
recruited from the student body population, which has prompted concern from some 
researchers (Bray & Kerr, 1982; Casper, Benedict & Perry, 1989; Goodman, Golding, 
Helgeson, Haith & Michelli, 1987) claiming such data cannot be generalised to the wider 
community, but several large-scale reviews and meta-analyses have revealed that data 
derived from such samples does not have limited generalisability (Bornstein, 1999; Pozzulo 
et al., 2008).  Much of the research employing the mock juror paradigm does differ from 
actual trials on one major point; the mock jurors frequently work in isolation (Goodman et al., 
1987; Landstrom et al., 2005; 2008; Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Swim 
et al., 1993; Nisbett & Ross, 1980).  Many researchers opt to run participants on an 
individual basis, as it is cheaper and less time consuming.  Few studies have elected to run 
a full-scale mock trial, simply because of the demand it places on resources.  It is a difficult 
task to arrange a large group of participants to attend at a specific time. Last minute drop-
outs and no-shows can lead to the whole group being cancelled; juries must adhere to a 
standard size, if numbers are diminished then the mock trial cannot proceed.  Despite the 
differences, reviews of the findings from over 45 years of mock jury research has advocated 
these simulation studies as providing researchers with better opportunities for experimental 
control and increased freedom to test theories and procedural variations which would not be 
permitted in the courtroom (Pozzulo et al., 2008; Bornstein, 1999; Diamond, 1997).  Most 
importantly, the conclusions drawn from these mock juror studies may be readily generalised 
to the wider populations (Bornstein, 1999; Diamond, 1997).   
Jurors are notoriously susceptible to a host of influencing factors ranging from order effects 
(Bruine de Bruin, 2005; Bruine de Bruin & Keren, 2003; Kassin & Wrightsman, 1979; Walker, 
Thibault & Andreoli, 1979; Pennington & Hastie, 1992; Carlson & Russo, 2001), 
attractiveness of witness and defendants (Sigall & Ostrove, 1975; Castellow, Wuensch & 
Moore, 1990; Darby & Jeffers, 1988; Ahola, Christianson & Hellstrom, 2009), jury 
instructions (Hastie, Penrod & Pennington, 1983; Daftary-Kapur, Dumas & Penrod, 2010), 
speech styles and body language (Wheatcroft, Wagstaff & Kebbell, 2004; Aron & Rosner, 
1998; Boccaccini, 2002; Boccaccini, Gordon & Brodsky, 2005; OBarr, 1974; Conley & 
OBarr, 1998; Gibbons, 1995; Conley, OBarr, & Lind, 1978; Erickson, Lind, Johnson, & 
OBarr, 1978; Lind, Erickson, Conley, & OBarr, 1978; OBarr, 1982; OBarr & Conley, 1976) 
and group dynamics (Hastie et al., 1983; McCoy, Nunez & Dammeyer, 1999; Stasser, Kerr 
& Bray, 1982; Blamey, McCarthy & Smith, 2000; Devine, Clayton, Dunford, Seying & Pryce, 
2001).  Manipulation of these factors has been shown to alter jurors perceptions and 
understanding and to change the outcome of a trial.  Witness demeanour is another factor 
which can exert a significant influence upon jurors perceptions of the witness and the 
reliability of their testimony yet this remains an under-researched area.  One such study by 
Golding, Fryman, Marsil & Yozwiak (2003) investigated the effect of emotion and demeanour 
upon mock jurors perceptions of child witnesses.  When the child witness remained calm 
and emotionless during testimony they were perceived as significantly less credible and 
reliable than the child witness who displayed some emotion (crying).  Yet, too much emotion, 
or hysteria, is equally likely to reduce perceived witness credibility.  There is some additional 
support for this effect (Regan & Baker, 1998) and while the effects of witness demeanour, 
particularly involving an adult witness, upon juror perceptions remains uncertain, the effect of 
high emotions and anxiety can be readily extended from these earlier studies.     
If a witness is so severely anxious about testifying it is expected that this will have a 
significant, detrimental effect upon the quality of their testimony (Vital Voices: Helping 
Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; Golding et al., 2003; Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008).  A highly nervous witness is more likely to answer questions in a disjoined 
manner, with frequent outbursts of emotion, poor eye contact and fidgety body language 
(Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002; Conley & OBarr, 1998; Gibbons, 1995; Conley, 
OBarr, & Lind, 1978; Erickson, Lind, Johnson, & OBarr, 1978; Lind, Erickson, Conley, & 
OBarr, 1978; OBarr, 1982; OBarr & Conley, 1976).  This is significant; relaxed, assured 
body language and maintaining strong, but not intimidating, eye contact have been proven to 
be heavily relied upon by jurors as a reliable indicator of witness credibility and possibly 
deceit (Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Boccaccini, 2002; Boccaccini et al., 2005; Tetterton & 
Warren, 2005; Aron & Rosner, 1998).  Poor performance in these areas may lead jurors to 
discount valuable testimony purely because of a witnesss nerves (Golding et al., 2003; 
Regan & Baker, 1998; Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003) 
Therefore, after an extended period of consultation with judicial professionals, witness 
support services and the general public a range of Special Measures for vulnerable 
witnesses was outlined and later incepted into law in Scotland under The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004.  These Special Measures were designed to improve the 
witness experience when at court by circumventing the legislative right of defendants to face 
their accuser thus removing the primary cause of witness anxiety yet preserving the basic 
rights of the accused (Birch, 2000; Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004).  
The Special Measures are not a new initiative; many of the testimony methods included 
under the Act have been routinely available to child witnesses, especially those linked to 
sexual abuse cases (Hamlyn et al., 2004; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Goodman et 
al., 1998; 2004; Swim et al., 1993, Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 2005; 2008).  The major 
change in legislation arises from the extension of the permissible criteria for making an 
application to use the Special Measures.  Since 2004 the full range of Special Measures has 
been available for adult witnesses; providing they meet specific criteria (The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004, Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 
2003); a documented history of intimidation in relation to their testimony and/or severe stress 
and anxiety to the detriment of their evidence.  Additionally, the adult witness applying for 
permission to use the Special Measures is required to have attended a V.I.P.E.R. identity 
parade and made a positive identification (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; The 
Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004).  Thus the provisions of the Act ensures that the 
Special Measures are not available to all adult witnesses; but only upon application to the 
trial judge who decides whether the witnesss testimony is likely to be significantly impaired 
by appearing in court without the use of the requested measure.   
The requested Special Measure may be any of a range allowed under The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act including in-court support from The Witness Service, submission 
of previous statements as evidence-in-chief and the use of pre-recorded video evidence, in 
addition to more familiar methods such as use of a screen and live CCTV links.  
However, while the public consultations were extensive there was no attempt to empirically 
investigate the effect of the Special Measures upon jurors perception of vulnerable adult 
witnesses and if this alteration then influences the trial verdict.  The existing literature has 
gone some way towards answering this question however; many of these studies have used 
child witnesses as the protagonist (Swim et al., 1993; Davies & Noon, 1991; Goodman et al., 
1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Landstrom et al., 2005; 2008).  This is not entirely 
unexpected; the inception of the Special Measures for use by adult witnesses is relatively 
recent while child witnesses have had access for a number of years. While this lack of adult 
data may be due to a publishing delay we may perhaps draw some tentative inferences from 
studies which have employed child witnesses.   
Most of the relevant literature has focussed on one of the more frequently used Special 
Measures, live CCTV link, and the effects it exerts upon mock jurors.  One of the first, and 
major, studies investigating the effect of CCTV link was Goodman, Tobey, Batterman-
Faunce, Orcutt, Thomas, Shapiro & Sachsenmaier (1998) revealed a small yet significant 
effect upon mock jurors perception when the witness testified via a CCTV link.  186 children, 
witnesses and over 1200 mock jurors were recruited for the study.  The child was allowed 
to build a rapport with a baby-sitter over 2 sessions which culminated in the child being 
asked to place stickers on either exposed body parts (toes, upper arm) or covered body 
parts (shirtsleeve, socks) thus forming a defendant guilty and not guilty condition.  The 
third session was a mock trial where half of the children testified without a CCTV link whilst 
the others used this Special Measure; the children were questioned about the earlier 
sessions with the baby-sitter while the mock jurors observed the trial.  Jurors were asked to 
rate the witnesss believability, accuracy, intelligence and suggestibility and then to deliver a 
verdict upon the case.   What Goodman et al found was using a CCTV link to testify was 
associated with a small, yet significant, negative bias in jurors perceptions of the witness;  
the children who testified in this manner were rated as less believable, less intelligent and 
more suggestible  than the children who testified in an open court with no Special Measures.  
However, jurors did rate them as more accurate than the witnesses who testified in an open 
court.  Furthermore, the negative bias for believability was not linked with a significant effect 
upon defendant conviction rates; the jurors were equally as likely to convict regardless of the 
testimony presentation method although the ratings of defendant guilt were marginally 
greater under the CCTV condition but this was not significant.   
In an earlier study Swim, Borgida & McCoy (1993) focussed on a different aspect of the 
issue of in-court Special Measures; whether the defendants rights are compromised while 
also assessing jurors reactions to child witnesses who chose to testify via a pre-recorded 
deposition.  Their results indicate a similar pattern: jurors who viewed the pre-recorded 
evidence condition perceived the defendant less positively than the jurors who viewed the 
witness testify in an open court; although this was not significant and did not exert an 
associated increase in conviction rates.  Equally, the jurors reported no significant emotional 
responses to observing the child witness testify via pre-recorded evidence and did not view 
them any more sympathetically.   
In more recent research, Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig (2005; 2008) of the University of 
Gothenburg have expanded these findings.  In their 2005 study, they investigated the effects 
of witnesses appearing live versus on video upon mock jurors ratings of witness veracity, 
their memory and their perceptions.  12 participants were recruited to serve as witnesses 
and were exposed to a staged event.  The event was a car accident in a parking lot, 
performed by two professional stuntmen; one drove a car through the parking lot whilst 
talking on a mobile phone.  Whilst attempting to turn left, the driver moved too far right and 
hit the other stuntman who was on a bicycle.  The cyclist lay still on the ground injured while 
the driver exited the car to check on him; the cyclist was injured.  The witnesses had been 
instructed to wait at a specific location in parking lot and the entire event lasted less than five 
minutes.  The witnesses were then split into two groups; one told the truth about the incident 
whilst the others were incited to lie during testimony for a financial benefit (600 USD).  All 
witnesses were given 5 minutes to prepare for their interview with the police.  Three weeks 
later, all witnesses returned for a court hearing.  Each witness was required to testify which 
took the form of free recall of the event followed by 11 specific questions.  All witnesses 
were viewed during their testimony by 4-7 mock jurors; this was the live testimony 
condition.  The testimony was also recorded for the video testimony condition and was 
shown to an equal number of mock jurors as viewed the live testimony.    The results of 
Landstrom et al.s experiments suggested that the witnesses viewed live were rated as 
significantly more eloquent and more pleasant and more honest.  Furthermore, the live 
witnesses were viewed with greater leniency that those viewed via videotape.   The authors 
suggested that these findings were linked to the physical proximity to the witness; that the 
live witness was viewed more sympathetically than the witness viewed via videotape and 
was also less likely to be critically evaluated.  The only limitations of the Landstrom et al 
study are that they did not ask their mock jurors to provide a verdict upon the case and so 
we cannot gauge what effects this change in jurors perceptions exerts upon the likelihood of 
a guilty verdict, and that the adult witnesses were not vulnerable.   
Sara Landstroms research in this area of CCTV and videotaped evidence as alternative 
testimony presentation methods are the result of the continuing debate in Sweden over the 
adoption of Special Measures into Swedish Law.  Special Measures are currently not 
permitted in Sweden and the implementation of Special Measures in the United Kingdom, 
and in Scotland in particular, is being closely monitored to assist Swedish researchers and 
legal practitioners in their push for such a reform to their own legislation.   
The Goodman et al. (1998) and the Swim et al. (1993) studies along with the Landstrom et 
al. (2005) paper anticipated that the use of a CCTV link to testify would be associated with 
mock jurors adopting a more pro-prosecution stance; that they would perceive the child 
witness as more credible and believable than a child witness who testified in an open court 
and would therefore be more likely to convict the defendant.  This reasoning stems from the 
explanation that jurors reach when viewing a witness testifying via Special Measures: that 
there must be a reason why the witness is too nervous to come into the courtroom thus the 
defendant must have done something to warrant this emotional response (Regan & Baker, 
1998; Golding et al., 2003).   
So why does this effect not occur in the extant literature?  One theory proposed by Davies & 
Noon (1991) is that Special Measures which remove the witness from the direct observation 
of the jurors are associated with reduced immediacy and exerts a weaker emotional impact.  
We have previously mentioned data which corroborates Davies & Noons theory; Swim et al 
(1993) found that their mock jurors did not respond any more empathetically to the CCTV 
link witness while the participants of Goodman et al.s (1998) study perceived the testimony 
of CCTV link witness as less reliable.  This theory is similar to an effect first proposed in 
1980 by Nisbett & Ross; the vividness effect.  Their participants viewed both live and 
videotaped testimonies and were intensively questioned about their perceptions after each.  
Nisbett & Ross reported that live testimonies were associated with increased vividness 
which led mock jurors to pay more attention to them, to consider live witnesses more 
credible and more memorable than the videotaped testimonies.  Nisbett and Ross clearly 
defined why they believed this effect to hold; they claimed that vivid testimonies are 
characterised by increased emotional impact or intensity, increased use of imagery and, 
most relevant to the use of Special Measures, by proximity of the witness to the jurors.  The 
more proximate the witness is to the juror, the more vivid the testimony, and the more 
credible the witness appears.   
One further area we can perhaps draw inferences to explain this effect is from the extensive 
research into witness body language and, to a lesser extent, speech styles and how this 
may be being interpreted by jurors (Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998; OBarr, 1974; 
Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Tetterton & Warren, 2005; Landry & Brigham, 1992; Orcutt et al., 
2001; Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 2005; 2008; Conley & OBarr, 1998; Gibbons, 1995; 
Conley, OBarr, & Lind, 1978; Erickson, Lind, Johnson, & OBarr, 1978; Lind, Erickson, 
Conley, & OBarr, 1978; OBarr, 1982; OBarr & Conley, 1976).  Much of this research 
originates from the United States where the preparation of witnesses for trial is a large 
component of their judicial system; it is common for both prosecution and defence to spend 
a significant amount of time, and money, coaching witnesses on the most effective manner 
of delivering their testimony (Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini et al., 
2005).     
It is widely recognised that jurors base their determinations of witness credibility and honesty 
on observations of their behaviour during testimony (Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 
1998; Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Tetterton & Warren, 2005; Landry & Brigham, 1992; 
Boccaccini et al., 2005). US witnesses are routinely coached in effective testimony delivery 
(Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002) including confident body movements: using 
illustrator gestures to reinforce their point; avoid fidgeting on the stand and extremes of 
emotion; appear relaxed and confident and maintain assertive, but not aggressive, eye 
contact with the jury.  Clearly when a witness testifies in an open court, with no Special 
Measures, the juror can easily observe the behaviour of the witness directly.  Similarly, when 
a screen is employed as a Special Measure this does not interfere with jurors direct 
observation of the witness as it is designed purely to shield the witness from the defendants 
view (Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004).  Yet when we progress to the live CCTV link and Pre-
recorded Video Evidence Special Measures the negative effect upon jurors perceptions is 
perhaps reasonable.  If we first assess the live CCTV link method it is immediately obvious 
that the jurors observation becomes indirect; as the witness does not appear before the jury 
but via a television link from a separate location (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 
2004).  In an open court the jury can see much more of the witness, and therefore more of 
their behaviour, whereas the witness can be seen only from the shoulders up when testifying 
via a CCTV link.  In addition, during the link the witness cannot see the jury directly and thus 
cannot deliver effective eye contact, so important to jurors perceptions and detection of 
deceit (Landry & Brigham, 1992; Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998; Mehrabian, 1981).  
Despite this obstacle the CCTV link Special Measure does permit some indirect observation 
of the witnesss body language when under pressure, particularly under examination by a 
challenging defence lawyer (Wheatcroft et al., 2003; Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 
1998).   
When a vulnerable witness elects to testify via pre-recorded video evidence, or statements, 
it decreases their proximity from the jury and from the jurors close scrutiny whilst also 
eliminating the adversarial nature of a live trial (Wheatcroft et al., 2004; Swim et al., 1993; 
Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; Birch, 2000; Regan & 
Baker, 1998).  The use of pre-recorded video evidence requires early action from both 
prosecution and defence lawyers to attend an interview session with the witness.  Frequently 
the video statement may be recorded many months in advance of the actual trial thus the 
witness may not be required to attend the trial and confront the accused (The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004).  The use of pre-recorded video evidence is associated with 
a significant decline in witness anxiety (Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; Richards, 
Morris & Richards, 2008) which enables such witnesses to deliver their testimony in a 
relaxed manner without excessively strong emotional responses.  Furthermore, the 
examination and cross-examination is completed in a less adversarial manner, further 
reducing the witnesss emotional response.  While these alterations to traditional testimony 
procedure are certainly beneficial to the vulnerable witness these same differences may be 
what prompts the jurors to perceive the witness in a negative light (Landstrom et al., 2005; 
Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Davies & Noon, 1991; Nisbett & Ross, 
1980).  
It is not unreasonable to speculate that the negative reflection upon a witness using pre-
recorded video evidence is a derivative extension of Davies & Noons immediacy and 
emotional impact theory; if the witness is relaxed and composed throughout their recorded 
statement this may trigger jurors deception detection as they perhaps expect a more 
emotional response from the witness.  This is an appropriate conclusion; the use of pre-
recorded video evidence is typically reserved for the most vulnerable of witnesses in the 
most serious offences (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004; Vital Voices: Helping 
Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Swim et al., 
1993) such as prolonged sexual abuse, hate crimes and child abuse (Swim et al., 1993; 
Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Landstrom et al., 2005; Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008; Elliott, 1998).   
Thus jurors would anticipate an emotional response from the witness as they are questioned 
about a traumatic, recent experience regardless of the presence or absence of the 
defendant (Golding et al., 2003; Regan & Baker, 1998).  If this emotional and/or behavioural 
response is lacking or weak then jurors may assume that the witnesss testimony has been 
embellished or is entirely fabricated; particularly in trials where the victim is the only 
prosecution witness (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al., 2004; Davies & 
Noon, 1991; Orcutt et al., 2001; Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Criminal Law Review Editorial, 
2004).   
This is completely the opposite effect of that hypothesised by Swim et al. (1993) where it 
was postulated that the jurors would tend towards empathy with the vulnerable witness and 
rationalise that they were using Special Measures to testify for a valid reason, such as 
extreme fear of the defendant (Goodman et al., 1998; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000).  The 
results from the available literature suggests a direct link between the immediacy and 
vividness of the witness testimony and how favourable they are then perceived by the 
jurors; as the witness becomes increasingly distal from the courtroom and the jury, they are 
viewed as progressively less credible and accurate (Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Orcutt et 
al., 2001; Swim et al., 1993; Landstrom et al., 2005).  This is valuable corroborative 
evidence for Davies & Noons (1991) theory of immediacy and emotional impact and Nisbett 
& Ross (1980) vividness effect and strongly suggests that permitting vulnerable witnesses 
to testify via remote Special Measures may be exerting a negative effect upon jurors 
perceptions of witness credibility (Landstrom et al., 2005; Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; 
Orcutt et al., 2001) and therefore may further affect jury deliberations and verdict (Landstrom 
et al., 2005; Davies & Noon, 1991; Nisbett & Ross, 1980, Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 
2007).   
It is this issue which has prompted furious claims from defence lawyers and human rights 
charities that defendants rights are being infringed under the provisions of The Vulnerable 
Witnesses (Scotland) Act and its 1999 counterpart in England & Wales; The Youth Justice & 
Criminal Evidence Act (Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; Birch, 2000; Hoyano, 2001; 
Tausz & Ellison, 2005).  The legal argument behind these claims is that giving permission to 
a vulnerable witness to testify using Special Measures is an implicit admission of defendant 
guilt before the trial has even begun (Goodman et al., 1998; 2004; Swim et al., 1993; Birch, 
2000; Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001), infringing both the right to presumed innocence 
and the right to confront their accuser as prescribed under Article 6 of The European 
Convention on Human Rights.  If the jury presumes defendant guilt solely from a witness 
using a Special Measure to testify this is likely to attract a greater rate of conviction (Tausz & 
Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008).  However, a 
legal appeal to the House of Lords (Tausz & Ellison, 2005) was rejected and it was stated 
that Special Measures were not contrary to defendants rights, a conclusion further 
supported by Hoyanos (2001) review.  Further corroborating data, which may be of more 
value, is that which has been discussed previously.  The child witness studies of Goodman 
et al. (1998; 2004) and Swim et al. (1993) and the adult witness study conducted by 
Landstrom et al (2005) all suggest that the use of Special Measures does exert a negative 
effect but largely upon jurors perceptions of the witness although there is also some weak 
evidence of a negative bias towards defendants (Swim et al., 1993).  Both of Goodman et al. 
(1998: 2004) and the Swim et al. studies though report that there is no link between the 
negative bias towards the witness, and the defendant, and likelihood of conviction.  
Therefore, it is indicative that the use of Special Measures does not infringe defendants 
rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and certainly does not 
serve to increase the possibility of conviction; if anything the extant literature suggests that 
the defendant may benefit from the use of Special Measures as they prompt jurors to view 
vulnerable witnesses and less credible and reliable (Landstrom et al., 2005; Goodman et al., 
1998; 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Davies & Noon, 1991; Swim et al., 1993; Nisbett & Ross, 
1980).   
So how widely used are the Special Measures, especially for adult vulnerable witnesses?  A 
large scale review of the Scottish system has recently been published (Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008) and examined the implementation levels across the first three years of the 
Acts inception.  This review was conducted on behalf of the Scottish Executive and has not 
been subjected to peer review; however, it is the first report of the statistics of Special 
Measures implementation for adult vulnerable witnesses.  Adult witnesses were only 
permitted to use the Special Measures from April 2006 and so the review covers only the 
first 8 months of adult use until December 2006.  Over 50 applications by adult vulnerable 
witnesses were made during this 8 month period and screens were the most frequently 
requested by adult witnesses.   
Live CCTV links are more commonly requested in High Court trials and are especially 
popular with children.  Richards, Morris & Richards (2008) review also reports that it appears 
that adult witnesses are moving away from screen use and towards CCTV links.  However, 
despite a system wide initiative to improve the awareness and availability of Special 
Measures to vulnerable witnesses, Richards, Morris & Richards (2008) reported that some 
Special Measures were unavailable in some courts three years after initial implementation 
although applications for Special Measures were very rarely refused by the presiding judge.  
Of the 787 vulnerable and/or intimidated witnesses identified by the review 42.2% used a 
live CCTV link while 22.5% requested the use of a wooden screen.  Pre-recorded video 
evidence was requested and permitted in only a single case in Scotland during the three 
year review, although it is suggested that the poor availability of recording suites and image 
quality may be a contributory factor to the poor level of implementation.  77.9% of witnesses 
identified as vulnerable and/or intimidated were female and 54.7% of these were also the 
victim in the case.    
Richards, Morris & Richards (2008) also questioned adult vulnerable witnesses after they 
had completed their testimony about their experience in the judicial system.  Vulnerable 
witnesses widely reported that there was a distinct lack of support and information in the 
time between investigation and trial.  Furthermore, many still feel that witnesses are treated 
poorly during their time at court with frequent contact with the defendant or their associates.  
Finally, many witnesses claim that they would not be willing to testify in court again unless 
they were permitted Special Measures (Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; Hamlyn et al., 
2004).   
Richards, Morris & Richards (2008) review gives a clear, valuable insight into the problems 
associated with vulnerable witnesses court experience.  Although there is a growing feeling 
within witness groups that the witness experience is improving, there remain doubts about 
several contentious issues (Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Landstrom et al., 2005).  
The data from Swim et al (1993) and Goodman et al (1998) is indispensable in a currently 
under-researched area yet it remains an issue that the conclusions from child studies are 
being widely extrapolated to apply to adult witnesses.  The Landstrom et al. (2005) is unique 
it is use of recorded video evidence (although this is of a different format to that used in the 
United Kingdom) and that it relied upon adult witnesses (who were not vulnerable).  A child 
witness elicits significantly more scepticism from jurors as there are valid doubts as to their 
veracity, memory capabilities, suggestibility and comprehension (Quas et al., 2005; 
Goodman et al., 1998; Wheatcroft et al., 2004; Regan & Baker, 1998; Golding et al., 2003; 
Laimon & Poole, 2008).  It is therefore of vital importance, as the implementation of Special 
Measures for adult vulnerable and/or intimidated witnesses continues to grow, that the 
effects of such a step upon jurors, witnesses and defendants are closely examined.    
Thesis Overview 
In recent years there have been several innovative steps taken to improve the quality of 
eyewitness identification and their later experiences at court.  However, there is an apparent 
short-coming in both the empirical evidence to support the introduction of these reforms and 
a limit to the extent which the extant literature can be generalised to account for such 
reforms.  This thesis aims to investigate this new route through the British judicial system; 
examining its efficacy and whether these steps are performing as they were intended to 
when incepted into law.  There has been some research into both identity parade 
procedures (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Gronlund, 2004; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & 
Pozzulo, 1999; Levi, 1998; Wells, 1993; 1998; Steblay et al., 2001; 2010; McQuiston-Surrett 
et al., 2006; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Mecklenburg, 2006; Steblay, 2006; 2010; Malpass & 
Ross, 2007) and the use of Special Measures for vulnerable and/or intimidated witnesses 
(Swim et al., 1993; Goodman et al., 1998; Landstrom et al., 2005; Davies & Noon, 1991; 
Nisbett & Ross, 1980), yet there remain a significant number of questions prompting furious 
debate in the research community.  This thesis aims to address many of the contentious 
issues and satisfy the vital need for empirical data in the contemporary approach to 
eyewitness identification and testimony presentation methods.  
Chapter 2 assesses the effectiveness of the sequential, video based identity parade system 
recently adopted by many British police forces; V.I.P.E.R.  While this move away from the 
more traditional, simultaneous procedure has been taken in an effort to reduce the 
enormous costs of organising identity parades, it has also been driven by extensive research 
purporting a sequential procedure as a means of reducing mistaken identifications and 
wrongful convictions (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Levi & Lindsay, 
2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Kassin et al., 2001; Kneller et al., 
2001).  Yet V.I.P.E.R. is very different to the strict sequential procedure employed in much of 
the literature, requiring a double presentation of the parade before an identification can be 
made as well as permitting repeated viewing of parade members (The Police and Criminal 
Evidence Act, 1984, Code D, 2008).  This represents a significant caveat to the extant 
literature (Steblay et al., 2001; 2010; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 
1999; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Levi, 1998) which unfortunately means that the V.I.P.E.R. 
identity parade format is relatively untested apart from one study (Valentine, Darling & 
Memon, 2007) which is reviewed later in the thesis.  Furthermore, the literature recognises 
that the exact conditions under which sequential superiority may occur remains unanswered 
(Wells 1998; 2008; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001) as does the theory 
regarding the driving force behind such an effect (Meissner et al., 2005; Gronlund, 2004; 
McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006).  Chapter 2 aims to resolve the uncertainty that surrounds 
the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade procedure by testing its effectiveness within the constraints of 
the British legal system.   
Chapter 3 deals with the rising use of Special Measures as a testimony presentation method 
for adult witnesses who are recognised to be vulnerable or at risk of intimidation (The 
Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2003, Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give 
Evidence, 2003; Hamlyn et al., 2004; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008).  While the use of 
Special Measures has been widely permitted for child witnesses for a number of years, it is 
only since 2006 that their criterion for use has been extended to adult witnesses (The 
Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2003; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008).  Despite the 
fact that child witnesses have routinely used Special Measures for years, there is little 
literature which has examined their effects upon juror perceptions and trial verdict decisions.  
Of the few that have ventured into this area (Landstrom et al., 2005; Goodman et al., 1998; 
2004; Swim et al., 1993;, Davies & Noon, 1991) there are small, yet significant indications 
that the use of Special Measures limits the value of a witnesss testimony in the eyes of the 
jurors; such a witness is perceived as less credible and believable than the same witness 
who testifies in an open court with no Special Measures.  However, we cannot simply 
extrapolate data from child studies to adult witness studies.  The only study to date which 
has used adult witnesses, who were not vulnerable, is the 2005 paper by Landstrom et al. 
which corroborates the findings from the earlier child studies but failed to investigate the 
effect upon trial verdict decisions.  Thus, there is a clear need for empirical investigation of 
the effect the use of Special Measures for adult vulnerable witnesses has upon jurors 
perceptions of the witness, the defendant and the trial verdict.   
This new pathway through the justice system, from identification to testimony, must be 
unbiased from all possible influences to ensure a fair and just outcome for all interested 
parties.  This thesis proposes to examine the witnesss route through the judicial system and 
to make a determination as to its fulfilment of its intended goals.   
Chapter 2:                      
Eyewitness Identification 
Introduction 
If you ask any member of the public to describe an identity parade it is likely that they would 
describe the enduring image of viewing a group of similar individuals from behind mirrored 
glass.  However this is no longer wholly accurate.  In 1996 West Yorkshire Police devised a 
new method for performing identity parades.  This system is called Video Identity Parade, 
Electronic Recording, or V.I.P.E.R. and has been implemented by a large number of police 
forces nationally and internationally, replacing the traditional procedure.  While the traditional 
format exhibits the parade members to the eye-witness live at a police station, V.I.P.E.R. 
allows the police to compile a video-based identity parade which can be administered in the 
station, at a hospital or the witness home.  A V.I.P.E.R. identity parade is similar in many 
aspects to the traditional format; between 8 and 12 similar looking individuals are recorded 
and later shown to witnesses.  Each individual is recorded in a twenty second clip which 
begins with the individual looking directly into the camera and then rotating their head 90 
degrees to show their full left profile and then rotating 180 degrees to the full right profile 
before returning to the initial full face view.  
Yet, it is important to acknowledge that researchers in this area have not routinely employed 
live, traditional, simultaneous parades as part of their methodology.  To do so would require 
an enormous degree of co-ordination, flexibility and would likely have a significant financial 
implication as well.  Instead, researchers have tended to employ the photo line-up, as widely 
used by police agencies in the United States and Australia.  The photo spread is 
administered in a similar fashion to the live parades; simultaneously.  So the witness is 
presented with an array of similar looking faces on sheet of paper or a computer display.  
The task is inherently identical to the live, traditional parade in that the faces are still 
presented to the witness simultaneously; in this study, the photo line-up is employed as best 
alternative to a live, traditional identity parade.   
It may also be prudent at this point to specify the terminology used in relation to identity 
parade research.  A target present, or culprit present, parade is an identity parade 
constructed with an image of the responsible individual contained within it.  Conversely, a 
target or culprit absent identity parade is constructed without any image of the responsible 
person within it.  Target absent parades are comprised entirely of foils; people who are 
selected to fill out the parade because they bear some similarity to the suspect.   
There are three outcomes associated with target present identity parades.  The first is a hit, 
or more commonly, a correct identification, whereby the witness identifies the 
culprit/suspect.  Secondly, the witness may instead make a mistaken identification of a 
known foil and wrongly identify one of the foils as the suspect.  Thirdly, the witness may 
choose to reject the entire parade because they do not believe that the suspect is present 
within that set of individuals.   
When a witness views a target absent identity parade there are two potential outcomes.  
They may elect to reject the entire parade, correctly, as the suspect is not present within it; 
this is commonly referred to as a correct rejection.  The second outcome is that the witness 
mistakenly identifies one of the foils as the suspect and this is referred to as a false 
identification.   
The simultaneous identity parade format has been shown to encourage the witness to 
employ a relative judgment style (Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Lindsay & 
Pozzulo, 1999; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; Steblay, Dysart, Fulero & 
Lindsay, 2001) due to its simultaneous nature.  This type of judgement style requires the 
witness to compare their memory of the suspect to each parade member whilst also 
comparing the parade members to each other (Steblay et al., 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 
2003; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Kneller, Memon & Stevenage, 2001).  Thus, the witness 
frequently selects the individual who most closely resembles their memory of the perpetrator 
and is a superior match than any other parade member.  This is advantageous when the 
actual suspect is present in the identity parade and this is clearly supported by the data; the 
rate of correct identifications elicited using the simultaneous format is estimated to be 75% 
(Wells, 2008) but has been claimed to be as high as 85-90% (Valentine, 2006).   
But if the simultaneous identity parade format performs so highly why has it become 
necessary to switch to a new, sequential format?  It has been widely reported that over half 
of simultaneous parades organised by police services are cancelled without being viewed 
(Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995).    This leads to huge costs for the judicial system in 
wasted man-hours and payments for the attendance of foils.  The primary reason for such a 
large cancellation rate is simple: witness anxiety about the possibility of coming face-to-face 
with the suspect outside of the identity parade.  While the police endeavour to minimise 
contact before and after the identity parade it would be impossible to eliminate any 
possibility of contact, and thus witness stress, completely.  Yet there are additional factors 
which exert an influence upon cancellation rates.  When organising a traditional identity 
parade it was extremely difficult for the police officer in charge to locate and contact 
appropriately similar foils, particularly as they were constrained to locally available 
individuals (Kemp, Pike & Brace, 2001; Valentine and Heaton, 1999).  In many cases 
identifying appropriately similar foils often became a duty for officers on the beat; they would 
be given a written description of the suspect and then would have to match individuals on 
the street as possible suitors (Valentine, 2006).  Of course not every individual approached 
would be willing to participate, even for a fee, and, of those who would participate, the 
organising officer would then have to contact and determine a suitable time for all foils and 
suspect to attend.  Due to such constraints it is not surprising that over 50% of all eye-
witnesses who viewed traditional identity parades felt that the parade members were of poor 
similarity (Slater, 1995).   Furthermore, the amount of work required to organise even one 
identity parade is clearly tremendously expensive and time-consuming and there being a 
50% chance of every identity parade being cancelled traditional identity parades are overtly 
linked with a huge drain of judicial resources (Slater, 1995).  Therefore, in a concerted effort 
to minimise cancellations West Yorkshire Police devised V.I.P.E.R.   
However, there are other factors which may influence the eye-witnesss failure to reject 
target absent parades.  The first is simply recall delay between exposure to the incident and 
attending an identity parade.  In the United Kingdom traditional identity parades typically 
require a minimum of ten weeks to organise (Office for National Statistics, 2007).  This is 
often compounded by the variable delay between the commission of a crime and witnesses 
coming forward to the police.  Research has categorically shown that memory degrades 
rapidly almost immediately after the event (Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008; Deffenbacher, 
Bornstein, Penrod & McGorty, 2008; Ebbesen & Rienick, 1998) and continues deteriorating 
with increasing time after the event.  Coupled with the verbalisation effect (Memon & Bartlett, 
2002); which claims that providing police with a verbal description of the suspect makes 
identification at a parade more unlikely; it is understandable that many witnesses memory of 
the suspect becomes fragmented quickly after acquisition which make recognition at an 
identity parade more difficult.    
Such a suggestion should explain why the rate of correct rejections is high, not low, yet there 
is also documented evidence which suggest witnesses rationalise their attendance as 
suggestive that the suspect is present in the identity parade (Wells, 1993) when he may not 
appear.  Many eye-witnesses will feel that they would have only been called to an identity 
parade to confirm to the police that they have already located the right suspect; perhaps 
rationalising Why would they call me if they hadnt already arrested the perpetrator?  Surely 
it would be a waste of time if he isnt present?   
All of these factors play a role in facilitating the high rate of mis-identifications, and wrongful 
imprisonment, associated with traditional simultaneous identity parades.  In an effort to 
counter these influencing factors Lindsay & Wells proposed the sequential identity parade 
procedure in 1985. 
While it is true that the primary driving force for the switch from traditional to V.I.P.E.R. was 
economic factors (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001; Valentine, 2006) it is widely reported in 
the literature that the simultaneous identity parade format performs poorly when eye-
witnesses are shown an identity parade in which the suspect is not present (Pike, Kemp, 
Brace, Allen & Rowlands, 2000; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Steblay et al., 2001; Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Wells, 1984).   It is hypothesised that the reason 
for this poor performance lies in the judgment style which makes traditional parades so 
successful for suspect present parades.  While the use of a relative judgment style is 
advantageous when the suspect is present, because it leads the witness to select the 
closest match to their memory, it is easily apparent that relative judgments encourage the 
witness to select the parade member who most closely resembles their memory of the 
suspect, even though that foil may not be closely similar (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Wells, 
1993; Steblay et al., 2001; Slater, 1995).  The rate of false identifications; selecting an 
innocent individual as the suspect, elicited when employing the traditional, simultaneous 
identity parade format has been estimated between 20 and 70 percent (Levi, 1998; Wells, 
Small, Penrod, Malpass, Fulero & Brimacombe, 1998; Memon & Bartlett, 2002; Kemp, 
Towell & Pike, 1997) with 30% typically cited as common.  At the time of writing, over 75% of 
the 239 wrongful imprisonment cases investigated and over-turned by The Innocence 
Project in the United States have been due to mis-identification by witnesses (The 
Innocence Project, June 2009).  
In contrast to the traditional format, V.I.P.E.R. employs a partial sequential procedure 
whereby each individual in the identity parade is presented in turn to the witness rather than 
simultaneously.  Such sequential presentation favours an absolute judgment style as it 
prevents the witness from comparing the individual parade members to each other in order 
to identify the best match (Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; McQuiston-Surrett, Malpass & Tredoux, 2006; Kneller et al., 
2001).  It encourages the eye-witness to compare their memory of the suspect to each 
individual parade member in turn and, in a true sequential format, the witness will only view 
each individual once.  Thus, the witness must make an identification decision, match or 
reject, after viewing each face.   
It is however imperative to note that there are clear and strident differences between the 
wholly sequential procedure advocated by the research and the sequential procedure of the 
V.I.P.E.R identity parade format.  During a V.I.P.E.R. parade, the witness may not be 
informed prior to viewing the parade how many individuals they will see, they are explicitly 
told not to make their identification decision until the entire parade has been viewed twice 
and, perhaps most significantly, after the parade has been viewed twice, the witness may 
request to view one or more individuals again before they make a decision (Police and 
Criminal Evidence Act, 1987, 2003).  While the strict sequential procedure is advocated by 
the literature, the researchers fail to agree on a standard, strictly sequential format.  There 
are various proposed models for a sequential identity parade format; the majority of studies 
advocate, and have employed, a wholly sequential format whereby the witness must give a 
final decision (select or reject) to the currently presented individual before advancing to view 
the next (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; 
McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Valentine et al., 2007; Wells, 1998).  
There are also other factors which vary between proposed sequential parade procedures; 
the question of single- versus double-blind presentation (Wells, 1993; 1998; Levi & Lindsay, 
2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999), 
whether the participants should be told how many individuals they will see (Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Lindsay & 
Pozzulo, 1999; Wells, 1993; 1998; 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Valentine et al., 2007; 
Kassin et al., 2001; Valentine, 2006; Valentine & Heaton, 1999) and the use of sequential 
photo parades to assess sequential superiority rather than moving images or video of the 
parade members (Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine et al, 2007; Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003; Wells, 1998; 2001).   
From the published literature there does appear to be significant benefits associated with 
such a presentation style.  Of paramount importance is the claim that the sequential 
presentation method significantly reduces the number of false identifications of an innocent 
foil during target absent identity parades.  Within the forensic community it has been widely 
accepted that sequential presentation of an identity parade maintains the high hit rate 
associated with simultaneous parades for target present situations whilst significantly 
lowering the number of mis-identifications (Steblay et al., 2001; 2011; Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine, Darling & Memon, 
2007).  As discussed earlier though, many of the claims of sequential superiority stems from 
research which has not used the V.I.P.E.R. format employed in the United Kingdom; instead 
many studies have simply used sequential presentation of still photographs.  V.I.P.E.R. is a 
wholly different format which utilises moving images of each parade member presented 
sequentially.  At this time there has been only one study which has examine this aspect of 
the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade system; Valentine, Darling & Memons 2007 paper which 
tested the effect of both moving images and strict instructions on the rate of successful 
outcomes for target present and target absent identity parades.  
Valentine, Darling & Memons 2007 paper is, to date, the only published study which has 
employed a methodology which truly reflects the current practice for all V.I.P.E.R. parades 
conducted in the United Kingdom.  The objective of this study was two-fold; firstly to assess 
the effect of using moving video images as parade stimuli over static full-face images and 
secondly whether the current instructions for V.I.P.E.R. parades are adequate to inhibit 
relative judgments or whether strict viewing guidelines would elicit a significant improvement 
in mis-identifications.   
The design of this study had three between-participants factors, each with two levels; 
procedure (existing versus strict), image format (moving versus static) and culprit presence 
(present versus absent).  223 student participants from the University of Aberdeen viewed a 
live, staged crime before being asked to return at a later date to view an identity parade.  14 
participants withdrew from the experiment for various reasons and so data was drawn from 
the remaining 202 participants.  Upon returning for the identity parade, the participants were 
randomly allocated to one of the 8 conditions.  All parades were introduced using the 
standard guidance and instructions given to witnesses before a parade is begun, stressing 
that if the witness feels that they cannot make an identification they must say so and not 
make a guess.  All parades were administered double-blind in that neither the witness of the 
experimenter knew if the culprit was present in the parade.  Static photo line-ups were 
administered via a 15 inch computer monitor.  In the existing condition, the V.I.P.E.R. 
images were played in their entirety, twice, before allowing an identification to be made and 
furthermore, allowing witnesses the opportunity to view any image they wished to see again, 
for however long they desired.  This methodology follows the current PACE Code D 
instructions.  In contrast, the strict condition presented the video images of the parade 
members one at a time and required the witness to make one of three decisions: yes  
indicating a positive identification which immediately ended the identity parade, no  
indicating a rejection and prompting the presentation of the next image, or a request to view 
the same individual for a second time.  Once a parade member has been rejected, the 
participant was not permitted to view it any further.  These strict instructions are in line with 
much of the research in this area (Cutler & Penrod, 1988; Lindsay, et al., 1991; Lindsay & 
Wells, 1985; Steblay et al., 2001; Kemp et al., 2001; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; McQuiston-
Surrett et al., 2006).    
The authors hypothesised that the strict condition would yield fewer mistaken identifications 
in the culprit absent parades compared to the existing procedure, as the strict instructions 
make it much more difficult to make relative judgments.  Due to this, it was also 
hypothesised that the strict condition would generate fewer correct identifications in the 
culprit present parades.  The second hypothesis was that the moving images would be 
associated with a higher rate of correct identifications based upon the encoding specificity 
principle (Tulving & Thomson, 1973).   
Hierarchical log-linear analysis of the culprit present data showed that while there was a 
significant effect of instructions, whereby the strict instructions provoked significantly fewer 
identifications, correct identifications of the culprit and mistaken identifications.  The analysis 
revealed there to be no significant difference in the rate of identifications between the 
moving and static image formats; thus the predictions of the encoding specificity principle 
were not valid, as there was no increase in the rate of correct identifications.  However, the 
culprit absent data revealed there to be no significant effect of instructions on the rate of 
correct rejections or misidentification but did show a statistically significant main effect of 
image format.  The proportion of correct rejections when viewing the moving images was 
significantly greater than that obtained when witnesses viewed the static photo line-ups; 
although the size of this effect was small ( = 0.24).   
Based upon their results, the authors recommended that the existing procedure currently in 
force across the United Kingdom be preferred over the strict procedure.  This is because the 
strict procedure was associated with a significant decline in parade sensitivity; a reduction in 
the number of correct identifications in the culprit present parades.  This recommendation 
was further reinforced by the evidence suggesting a small, yet significant, benefit of moving 
images for culprit absent parades, whereby the moving images elicited fewer mistaken 
identifications than the static photo images.   
While many authors link the advantageous decrease in mis-identifications purely with the 
specific judgment style fostered by sequential presentation there are many other possible 
factors which may be responsible for such an effect.  The delay between incident exposure 
and recall is much shorter when V.I.P.E.R. parades are used; dropping to around ten days 
(although they can be organised within hours) from an average of ten weeks with the 
traditional format (Office of National Statistics, 2007).  As a result, although much of memory 
is forgotten rapidly after encoding without active remembering, the eye-witness memory of 
the suspect should be stronger than it typically would be after ten weeks (Memon, Hope & 
Bull, 2003; Deffenbacher, Bornstein, McGorty & Penrod, 2008).  Furthermore, when 
individuals are recorded and entered onto the V.I.P.E.R. database their status is noted; 
whether they are innocent volunteers, suspected of criminal activity or convicts (West 
Yorkshire Police, 2009).  This is information that would not be ordinarily available to 
organising police officers during traditional live parades and therefore is a possible route to 
increasing false identifications during target absent parades.  When using the V.I.P.E.R. 
format, even if the eye-witness selects an innocent foil as the suspect the organising 
V.I.P.E.R. officer will check the status of such an individual and a false identification is 
unlikely to proceed any further.   
There has recently been a further argument that sequential presentation of foils does not 
elicit a change in judgement style but simply encourages the witness to adopt more 
conservative criteria for recognition (Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; Meissner, Tredoux, Parker & 
MacLin, 2005).  This hypothesis is based on signal detection theory and claims that the eye-
witness may not be choosing to use an absolute judgement over a relative judgement but 
rather that they increase the criterion required to make a positive identification of the 
suspect.  Much of the evidence supporting the claim that witnesses use an absolute 
judgement style when viewing sequential identity parades has derived from self-report 
measures (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Meissner et al., 2005) and thus should be 
regarded cautiously.  In addition, sequential identity parades are routinely compiled from a 
national database of images, therefore the quality of the foils is significantly improved 
(Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Steblay et al., 2001) and perhaps a more robust criterion is 
employed by the witness to distinguish and identify the perpetrator (Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; 
Meissner et al., 2005).  Gronlund (2004) tested the efficacy of both the high criterion match 
theory and the decision strategies theory and found strong evidence to support the change 
in decision strategies as the explanation for what occurs when eye-witnesses view identity 
parades in place of signal detection theory.   
There are also claims that eye-witness identification is aided through the use of video 
identity parades as the movements made by the parade members are more natural and 
similar to those made during encoding of the suspects image as the crime is committed.  
Tulving & Thompson (1973) stated that viewing a moving image at recall increases the 
likelihood of recognition compared to still image.  This is because the eye-witness will have 
likely seen the suspect moving around throughout the crime and the encoding specificity 
principle claims that recall, and recognition, will be facilitated if the stimulus is presented in 
the same manner in which it was originally encoded (Tulving & Thompson, 1973).  The 
results from Valentine, Memon & Darlings 2007 study found a small but significant increase 
in correct rejections for target absent parades when the eye-witnesses viewed a moving 
CCTV video and a moving identity parade.  It has been suggested that the moving stimulus 
gives the witness a wider range of cues or perhaps reveals a facial distinctiveness which 
later aids identification and encourages witnesses to be more stringent in their recognition 
criteria.  Despite this, there remains a body of evidence which reports no significant benefit 
to eye-witness identification when moving images are used over still photos (Henderson, 
Bruce & Burton, 2001; Bruce, Henderson, Newman & Burton, 2001; Hancock, Bruce & 
Burton, 2000).   
A further theory which may provide some answers as to why sequential parades elicit a 
lower rate of false identifications is the three-quarter face effect (Bruce, Valentine & 
Baddeley, 1987).  The effect is claimed to have a small but significant advantage for 
recognition when presented to witnesses (Liu & Chaudhuri, 2001; Hancock, Bruce & Burton, 
2000), particularly when it is also seen alongside the full face view.  Clearly, the crime video 
provides both full face and 3/4 views for the witness to assimilate and then at the recognition 
stage the V.I.P.E.R. segments provided a full range of views to the witness; from full face 
through to each profile, which lends itself favourably to benefiting from the 3/4 effect for 
recognition.   
However, it should be noted that the adoption of sequential procedures has not been without 
its controversies.  From the beginning the proponents of sequential presentation called firmly 
for strict conditions under which sequential identity parades should be run.  These included a 
double-blind procedure and true sequential testing; that the witness must reject the 
individual before them as the suspect before viewing the next image; that the witness cannot 
change their rejection/acceptance decision and that they may not know how many images 
they will view (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Wells, 1993; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Valentine et al., 
2007; Memon & Gabbert, 2003).  However, these conditions have not been met by 
worldwide police forces; it is often impossible to run a double blind procedure and true 
sequential testing is contrary to the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code 
D, which provides for all eye-witnesses to view the entire video parade twice before making 
a decision (Home Office, 2004).  Clearly then the current UK procedure for sequential 
identity parades is not truly sequential and can reasonable be claimed to have a 
simultaneous component.   
Despite this issue the introduction of the V.I.P.E.R. system has been deemed a success by 
the 34 UK police forces which have implemented its use.  All forces now operate several 
operations for recording images and have a dedicated team of V.I.P.E.R. officers.  All 
images recorded are contributed to the central UK database which can be accessed and 
utilised by any member force to compile identity parades.  This has helped to reduce man 
hours spent in seeking suitable foils locally and organising attendance of suspect/foils and 
witness simultaneously.  Most importantly, because there is no longer any possibility of 
witness and suspect inadvertently meeting, the number of V.I.P.E.R. parades cancelled is 
just 5% (Slater, 1995; Home Office, 2003).   
Thus, it has been widely accepted that the traditional identity parade format is equally as 
good, if not superior, to the V.I.P.E.R. format when the suspect is present whilst the 
V.I.P.E.R. format is significantly superior for target absent identity parades (Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Valentine et al., 2007; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Steblay et 
al., 2001; 2011; Wells 1993; Levi & Lindsay, 2001).  Yet despite 81% of researchers in the 
community advocating the superiority of the sequential method for identity parades (Kassin, 
Tubb, Hosch & Memon, 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2005; Valentine et al., 2007) there 
remain questions regarding the precise conditions under which sequential presentation is 
superior to simultaneous.  Much of the available literature has tested V.I.P.E.R.s 
performance under a wide range of conditions from witness stress and arousal (Pozzulo, 
Crescini & Panton, 2008) to change of suspect appearance (Henderson, Bruce & Burton, 
2001), operating procedures (Wells, 1993) and judgement styles (Memon & Gabbert, 2003; 
Lindsay & Wells, 1985), and while the data has provided valuable information about video 
identity parades there has not yet been a clear undertaking to examine whether the 
sequential superiority effect occurs under the simplest conditions; recall delay and CCTV 
crime video colour.   
CCTV video colour was introduced as a factor due to recent advances in CCTV image 
quality.  Typically, black and white, or greyscale, CCTV cameras were much more sensitive 
to light and offered greater resolution than colour camera, all for a much cheaper cost.  
However, in recent years, the differences in cost have been greatly reduced and colour 
CCTV cameras now offer the same level of resolution as greyscale cameras.  Although the 
greyscale CCTV cameras do still offer superior light sensitivity, this superiority is often 
marginal and there are some colour CCTV cameras can capture images in light levels as 
low as 0.3 lux, although these are associated with greater costs.  In spite of these costs, it is 
believed that colour CCTV cameras yield better recognition capability than greyscale CCTV 
cameras (http://www.cctvsentry.com/faq.htm), allowing CCTV operators to specify clothing 
colour to police searching for a particular individual seen on camera (Davies & Thasen, 
2000).   
Research in this area has not supported such a claim though.  Laughery, Alexander & Lane 
(1971) found there to be no advantage in recognition of mug shots when they were 
presented in colour rather than greyscale; a finding replicated by Wogalter & Laughery 
(1987).  Similar negative results have been reported by both Bruce et al., (1999) and 
Shepherd, Ellis & Davies (1982) when the task was to identify one target face contained 
within a photographic array.   Davies & Thasen (2000) conducted an experiment where 80 
participants were instructed to watch a surveillance video, shown in either colour or 
monochrome, and note any suspicious events in a log.  After checking that all participants 
had recorded the event of interest, the participants were asked to describe the individual 
they saw and to attempt to identify them from a photographic array, again presented either in 
colour or monochrome.  Their results showed that, surprisingly, the participants made little 
use of the colour cues in their descriptions of the clothing worn by the target; 40% described 
the colour of her coat but only 17% described the colour of her trousers.  Just 15% of the 
participants successfully identified the target individual from the photo array while 60% made 
a false identification.   
The authors found evidence for a main effect of video colour; those participants who viewed 
the colour CCTV tape were less caution in their study of the photographic array and were 
more likely to choose compared to those participants who viewed the monochrome CCTV 
tape.  Those who viewed the monochrome CCTV tape were superior on just two points; 
firstly, they provided more detailed descriptions of the targets hairstyle and more 
http://www.cctvsentry.com/faq.htm
importantly, they made fewer false identifications than those who viewed the colour CCTV 
tape.   
On the basis of these results, the author claimed that colour has an inconsistent and 
unpredictable effect upon eyewitness testimony.  While those who viewed the colour CCTV 
tape gave more spontaneous descriptions of the targets clothing, they were also more likely 
to wrongly identify an innocent foil.  Davies & Thasen suggest that the witness confidence in 
their own ability to make an identification was boosted through the presence of colour and 
that this in turn primed them with a greater readiness to respond, regardless as to the 
presence or absence of the target in the photographic array.  Due to this, while the authors 
recognise that colour may be a valuable factor in improving person identification, they 
recommend that CCTV operators be trained appropriately to recognise the advantages and 
potential disadvantages of using colour cues for identification purposes.   
There appears to be only one study which suggests that colour may have a beneficial effect 
upon face identification which was published in 1985 by Tickner & Poulton.  Their study 
asked their volunteers to observe surveillance footage for either 1, 3 or 4 hours and then 
asked them to search for 3 or 12 target faces within a photographic array.  Within their 
experiment the presence or absence of colour and the faces in the photo array were 
systematically varied.  Their results are interesting though, particularly in terms of the 
V.I.P.E.R. procedure; Tickner & Poulton found a small, yet significant advantage for colour in 
terms of identification.  Those participants who viewed the colour CCTV surveillance footage 
were more likely to make correct identifications of the targets, regardless of whether the 
photographic array was presented in colour or greyscale.   
In light of these conflicting results, it was decided to examine the effect of CCTV colour as 
an additional factor which may affect eyewitness identification, in an effort to fully resolve the 
issue.   
Furthermore, the present study was designed to adhere to the current procedure used by all 
UK police forces laid down in The Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code D (2008, Home 
Office).  Therefore the eye-witnesses throughout this experiment were required to view the 
V.I.P.E.R. identity parade twice, divergent from the standards advocated by the research 
community (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Valentine et al., 2007; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Wells, 
1993; Levi & Lindsay, 2001).   
Therefore, it was hypothesised that there would be a significant difference in correct 
identifications of the suspect between the simultaneous and V.I.P.E.R. identity parade 
format for target present parades and that V.I.P.E.R. parades would elicit significantly fewer 
false identifications than the simultaneous parade for target absent parades.  In addition, 
drawing from the literature (Deffenbacher, Bornstein, Penrod & McGorty, 2008; Ebbesen & 
Rienick, 1998), it was further expected that both parade types would suffer from lower rates 
of success (less hits and more mis-identifications) in the longer recall delay conditions and 
that those eye-witness who viewed the black and white CCTV crime video would perform 
poorer than those who had viewed the colour CCTV crime video.   
Method 
Design 
The experiment was conducted in two parts.  Firstly, the participants viewed a CCTV video 
of a simulated crime before returning at a later time to take part in an identity parade.  The 
experiment had four between-subjects factors, each of which had two levels: Parade Type 
(simultaneous versus V.I.P.E.R.), Recall Delay (2 hours versus 24 hours), CCTV video 
(Black & White versus Colour) and Target Presence (target present versus target absence).   
The dependent variables were different according to the presence or absence of the target 
in the identity parade.  The dependent variable for the target absent parades was the 
number of correct rejections of the entire identity parade.  However, the dependent 
measures for the target present parade were the number of correct identifications and the 
number of mistaken identifications.   
Participants 
320 participants were recruited from the population of the University of Glasgow.  Many of 
the participants were level one Psychology undergraduates who participated in exchange for 
course credit.  The average age of the participants was 24.48 years (SD = 9.64, range: 17-
67 years).  Of the 320 participants 185 were female.  The participants were randomly 
allocated to one of 8 conditions resulting in 40 participants in each group.  These 40 
participants in each group were further split as 20 viewed a Target Absent parade while the 
remaining 20 viewed a Target Present parade (see Figure 1).  
              Figure 1: Breakdown of the configuration of the experiment series. 
Upon completion of the experiment each participant was fully de-briefed, thanked and 
received payment for their time; either course credit or 3.   
Stimuli 
The crime video watched by all participants was filmed in a department waiting room in the 
University of Glasgow.  In order to avoid any negative effects upon the witnesses a low 
impact crime (theft) was selected to be the subject of the crime video.  Three staff members 
were recruited to enact the crime; theft of a wallet.  In order to retain access to a broad 
subject pool the three staff members were selected based on how little contact they had with 
the Psychology undergraduates.  Thus the participants would have no pre-existing familiarity 
with the criminal or his victim.  The three staff members were given a detailed overview of 
the aims of the experiment and the conditions under which the video was to be filmed.  
There were to be three roles within the context of the video: criminal, victim and 
experimenter who called away the victim.  The video would show the victim arriving in the 
waiting room followed by the criminal.  After a few seconds an experimenter would call the 
victim, who leaves their backpack in the waiting room.  Whilst alone, the criminal rummages 
through the backpack and steals a wallet before casually leaving. 
The stimulus video was designed to mimic a CCTV video therefore a video camera was 
positioned relatively high on a wall for the recording, approximately 8 feet from the ground 
and 10 feet across the room from the incident.  The video was recorded after the department 
had closed in order to eliminate any extraneous faces from the stimulus.  After some last 
minute rehearsals and alterations the CCTV video was recorded three times, once with each 
staff member playing the role of the criminal, victim or experimenter.  The video was 
recorded in both a colour and black and white version and was approximately 80 seconds in 
duration.  The video clearly shows a full range of facial views of the suspect, from full profile 
through to full face.  The resolution of the black and white CCTV video was identical to the 
resolution of the colour CCTV video as no changes were made with the exception of 
reducing the saturation level to remove all colour cues.  No other changes were made to the 
stimulus crime videos as a control measure.   
After recording was completed the three versions of the stimulus video was shown to a 
panel of four staff members in order to identify the most plausible criminal.  Once selected 
some minor editing was performed.  All sound was removed from the clip and the beginning 
and end shaved to remove unwanted images.  A still image of the criminal was then taken 
from the video and shown to ten random individuals who were asked to describe the 
individual.  These descriptions were recorded and used in the next stage of stimulus 
development.

To compose both the simultaneous and V.I.P.E.R. identity parades the experimenter 
selected 30 images from a database of approximately 800 faces held by the Department of 
Psychologys Face Processing Lab.  The images were selected on a basis that they 
matched a written description of the image taken from the video clip of staff member who 
portrayed the criminal, as described by ten random individuals.  These 30 faces were then 
presented to a group of 15 participants who were asked to rank the faces in order of 
similarity to the target face.  The participants were not permitted to discuss their rankings or 
to collaborate.  From the results the 8 highest ranked faces were then selected to compile all 
four of the required identity parades.  In accordance with PACE regulations, the criminal 
was shown the final parade images and their approval was sought and was given.   
Foil selection was carried out in this manner, different to that used in actual V.I.P.E.R. 
parade composition, because the experimenter did not have access to the national database 
of V.I.P.E.R. images and could not utilise the selection process of the database.  The Face 
Processing Lab has a relatively large database of faces recorded in typical V.I.P.E.R. 
presentation which have been gathered from a number of open day events and social 
mixers attended by potential students from across the United Kingdom.   
The eight individuals ranked by participants as most similar to the suspect. 
Obviously, there were practical implications which made the use of a live, traditional identity 
parade impossible as an experimental option for the simultaneous condition.  The next best 
methodology was to use a simultaneous photo line-up, as commonly employed in police 
practice in the United States and Australia and which has been widely used as a 
representative simultaneous presentation of an identity parade (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi 
& Lindsay, 2001; Steblay et al., 2001; 2011; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003; Valentine et al., 2007; Kneller et al., 2001; Clark & Davey, 2005).   
The simultaneous identity parades were composed of 8 images; the 7 highest ranked foils 
and the suspect.  Each of these images showed the individual from the chest up with a 
number positioned below them.

Example of the simultaneous identity parade used in the series of experiments.  In this case the 
suspect is present, in position 2. 
It is a common misconception that foils for identity parades are all required to wear similar 
styles and similar coloured clothing.  The foils recruited to fill a parade, whether traditional or 
V.I.P.E.R., attending wearing the clothing they chose for themselves.  Standardisation of 
clothing across the parade is not thought to exert a significant effect upon witness 
perceptions (Davies & Thasen, 2000), as it would be unlikely that the culprit would be 
wearing the same clothes as during the commissioning of the crime.  As such, it is not 
routinely controlled for in applied V.I.P.E.R. parades.  The standard V.I.P.E.R. suite set-up 
dictates recording the moving clips against a light/grey background to provide optimum 
contrast.  As the V.I.P.E.R. database utilises clips on a national basis, it is not unexpected 
that there would be some variation across the database.  On this basis, it was decided that 
modifying the backgrounds of the selected video clips would be unnecessary and bring no 
additional benefit to the study.   
 The V.I.P.E.R. parades are comprised of video sequences of each individual foil and the 
suspect.  The eye-witness can see only the head, shoulders and chest of each individual as 
they rotate their head throughout 180 degrees.  An identifying number is displayed in the top 
right corner for each sequence.   
Example of one individuals V.I.P.E.R. sequence. Each sequence is approximately 15 seconds 
duration. 
Apparatus 
The crime video was shown to each participant on a 17 inch widescreen laptop screen.  The 
viewing of the identity parades took place in a private room with just the experimenter 
present.  Both simultaneous and V.I.P.E.R. parades were displayed on a 21 inch computer 
monitor.   
Participants indicated their decision after viewing on a response sheet (Appendix 1).   
Procedure 
Participants were seated before a 21 inch widescreen monitor in a quiet room.  The 
experimenter explained that they would be watching live feed from a CCTV camera from a 
nearby waiting room.  The experimenter then left the room and the participant viewed the 
appropriate 1 minute 25 second crime video.  After the video had ended the experimenter 
re-entered the room and arranged to meet the participants later; 2 hours or 24 hours 
1 1 1 1 
depending upon the condition they had been allocated to, at which time they would view the 
appropriate identity parade.   
Upon returning, participants were seated in an office before a 17 inch laptop computer.  The 
experimenter explained that they would now view an identity parade which the suspect may 
or may not be present.  Those 160 participants who viewed the simultaneous identity parade 
were given standard police instructions (Appendix 2) and permitted as long as required to 
make a decision.  The 160 participants who viewed the V.I.P.E.R. identity parades were 
read standard police instructions, which explicitly instructed the participant not to make a 
decision before viewing each individual twice and were then left to view the parade.  After 
the V.I.P.E.R. parade had completed, the experimenter returned to the room and asked the 
participant if they felt able to make an identification.  If they expressed themselves to be 
unsure or a desire to view certain individuals again, in accordance with PACE instructions, 
the participant was permitted to view the requested images again, to freeze the images and 
to view them for as long as they felt necessary until they were able to either make an 
identification or elected to reject the parade.   
The experimenter stood at the rear of the office, out of the participants view, throughout this 
stage of the study.  After each participant had made a decision and indicated it upon the 
response sheet, the experimenter debriefed them, answered any questions and issued 
payment.   
Results 
The data were separated prior to analysis into Target Present responses and Target Absent 
responses.  This is because the two methods of identity parade measure two very different 
constructs; Target Present parades are a test of witness memory whilst Target Absent 
parades are a measure of witness sensitivity.   
Target Present Identity Parades 
The following data is generated from the 160 participants who viewed a target present 
identity parade.  The rate of correct identifications elicited during all eight experimental 
conditions is shown in Graph 1.  The data indicate that the simultaneous identity parade 
format was out-performed by the V.I.P.E.R. parade format under each of the four 
experimental conditions (see Graph 1).   
Graph 1: Percentage correct identifications by each parade style for each of the four 
experimental conditions.  Error bars reflect the standard error (SE). 
The overall rate of correct identifications from the 160 participants was 70.6%.  Of those who 
made a correct identification 57.5% viewed the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade; 49.5% viewed the 
identity parade 24 hours after exposure to the suspect and 53.1% viewed the black & white 
crime video.   
The data was further analysed using nominal logistic regression, as the data are categorical 
with 3 distinct levels (correct identification, mis-identification and incorrect rejection), to 
identify any predictor variable which may exert a significant effect upon the probability of the 
witness to correctly identify the suspect.  The results of this analysis revealed there to be no 
significant relationship between any predictor variable(s) and the probability of eliciting a 
correct identification (
 = 45.42, df=62, p>0.05,  = 0.73).   
Gender 
Gender was included in the logistic regression model as a potential predictor of identity 
parade outcome however there was no evidence to suggest that witness gender significantly 
affects the likelihood of making a correct identification (p>0.05).   
Target Absent Identity Parades 
The following data is generated from the 160 participants who viewed a target absent 
identity parade.  The rate of correct rejections elicited during all eight experimental 
conditions is shown in Graph 2.  The data indicates that the simultaneous parade format was 
generally superior to the V.I.P.E.R. format in eliciting fewer mis-identifications.  The number 
of correct rejections was particularly poor using both identity parades formats when eye-
witnesses viewed the black & white CCTV crime video and returned 2 hours later to view the 
identity parade.  The V.I.P.E.R. format appeared to be superior to the simultaneous format 
when participants had viewed the colour CCTV crime video and returned to view the identity 
parade 2 hours later.   
The overall rate of correct rejections across all 160 participants was 52.25%.  Of those who 
correctly rejected the entire parade 58.5% viewed the colour crime video; 54.9% viewed the 
parade 24 hours after exposure to the suspect and 51.2% viewed simultaneous parade.   
Graph 2: Percentage of respondants who correctly rejected  the entire parade.  Error 
bars reflect the standard error (SE). 
As the data were once again categorical and discrete, further analysis using binary logistic 
regression was undertaken.  The resulting model indicated there to be only one predictor 
variable to exert a significant effect upon the outcome; recall delay (p<0.05).  The Pearsons 
test revealed this model to be significant (
 = 64.99, df = 45, p<0.05), (odds ratio (OR) = 
1.5).  All other terms analysed in the model had no significant effect upon the outcome of the 
parade.  Therefore, there was no significant effect of parade type and the null hypothesis 
cannot be rejected; there is no significant evidence that the V.I.P.E.R. parade format is 
superior to the simultaneous format for target absent parades.   
From the logistic regression analysis, we can state that recall delay is a significant predictor 
of identity parade outcome and that the increase in recall delay from 2 hours to 24 hours 
increases the likelihood of making a correct rejection by 1.5 times.     
Gender 
Gender was included in the regression model as a potential predictor of parade outcome 
however analysis revealed no effect of gender on parade outcome (p>0.05) and was thus 
excluded from the regression model.   
Discussion 
It was anticipated that the current study would yield similar results to those already well 
established in the research community; that there would be no significant difference in hit 
rates between the two parade styles for target present parades and that the V.I.P.E.R. 
format would be significantly superior than the simultaneous format in minimising the rate of 
mis-identifications (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; 
Wells, 1993; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Valentine et al., 2007; Steblay et al., 2001; 2011).  
However, these anticipated effects did not materialise.  The results suggest that there is no 
significant difference between parade formats for either target present or target absent 
identity parades.   
It has been widely claimed that the sequential identity procedure retains the high hit rate 
exhibited by simultaneous parades while reducing witness anxiety, delays and costs 
(Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Valentine et al., 2007; Pike et al., 2000), a 
claim that is supported to some extent here; of the 80 participants who viewed the 
simultaneous parade 60% of them correctly identified the suspect.  However it cannot be 
ignored that 25% of these 80 participants mis-identified an innocent foil while the remaining 
15% incorrectly rejected the entire parade.   
There have also been claims that for target present parades the hit rate may be 
compromised by the sequential procedures advocacy of an absolute judgment style 
(Memon & Gabbert, 2003), suggesting that while sequential processing reduces false 
identifications it may also be limiting the number of correct identifications (Wells, 2008).  It is 
suggested that this is because of the absolute judgment style which sequential identity 
parades reportedly fostered in eye-witnesses.  Pozzulo & Lindsay (1995) and Memon & 
Gabbert (2003) assert that while the witness may observe that the image of the suspect is 
familiar it may be tempting to reject the individual in search of a better criterion match.  The 
current study does not support this claim as 65 of the 80 participants (81.25%) who viewed 
the sequential parade made a correct identification, 9 (11.25%) incorrectly identified an 
innocent foil while the remaining 6 participants (7.5%) incorrectly rejected the entire parade. 
Certainly the datum from the current study appears to suggest that the sequential V.I.P.E.R. 
format elicits a higher rate of correct identifications compared to the simultaneous parade 
format and decreases the rate of mis-identification by more than half, as compared to the 
simultaneous format.  
While these results do not support those of Memon & Gabberts 2003 study it must be noted 
that the procedure used in Memon & Gabberts 2003 study was completely sequential; the 
identity parade was stopped as soon as the witness made a selection, as advocated by 
proponents of the sequential format.  This is a contravention of the legislative guidelines for 
V.I.P.E.R. identity parades, which requires that sequential parades are shown in their 
entirety twice before an identification can be made; a stipulation to which the current study 
adheres.  It may be then that the conclusions drawn from this data are more reflective of the 
actual outcomes observed in real-life identity parades and so it may be that the sequential 
superiority effect does not manifest in sequential parades which are held in accordance with 
PACE Code D and the Lord Advocates Guidelines.   
It was anticipated that there would be evidence of a significant sequential superiority of the 
V.I.P.E.R. format compared to the simultaneous format for target absent parades; however 
this was demonstrated to not be evident.  This is contrary to a large proportion of the 
published data which clearly state that this pattern should be exhibited (Wells, 2001; Lindsay 
& Wells, 1985; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; 
Valentine et al., 2007; Wells, 1993; Steblay et al., 2001, 2011) with the sequential format 
performing significantly better than the simultaneous format.  Why are the results from the 
current study, for both the target present and target absent parades, so divergent from the 
hypothesised effects which are widely reported in the literature? 
It is speculated that the issue at the heart of the findings lies with the procedure employed 
throughout the entire experiment series.  It was decided that the experimental procedure 
should adhere to current UK police procedures and legislation to enhance the external 
validity of the experimental series (Bornstein, 1999; Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008).  At 
this time, PACE Code D stipulates that witnesses attending a V.I.P.E.R. parade be explicitly 
instructed to refrain from making a decision until they have viewed all the images twice (The 
Police and Criminal Evidence Act Code D, 2008, Home Office).  This is therefore not a truly 
sequential judgment task. This procedure is contrary to the procedure for sequential parades 
as advocated by experts within the community and it is different on three major points.  
Firstly it is widely recommended that all sequential identity parade procedures be strictly 
sequential.  This is to say that the eye-witness may only view one individual at a time then 
make a decision.  If the witness identifies the individual as the suspect then the parade is 
immediately ended (Valentine et al., 2007; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Lindsay & Wells, 1985) 
while if they reject the individual before them as the suspect the eye-witness proceeds to 
view the next foil.  Secondly, once the witness has made a decision on the individual before 
them they are not permitted to later change that decision (Valentine et al., 2007; Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003).  The witness may not later identify a previously rejected individual and 
equally they cannot reject the individual they earlier identified as the suspect.  Finally the 
literature advises that the eye-witness is not told beforehand how many individuals will 
appear in the identity parade (Valentine et al., 2007; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 
2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999).  This measure is designed to prevent the witness counting 
individuals and feeling pressured to make an identification as the parade comes towards its 
conclusion.  
Clearly the stipulations of PACE Code D contravenes the first and third of these 
recommendations as the witness is required to view the entire V.I.P.E.R. parade twice which 
also allows the witness to determine how many individuals are shown throughout the whole 
parade.  It is not unreasonable to propose that in its current format V.I.P.E.R. is not a truly 
sequential identity parade but is a hybrid state between simultaneous and sequential 
formats.  This model may also account for the exceptionally high level of correct 
identifications generated by the V.I.P.E.R. format for target present parades: the witness 
may make a tentative, internal identification on the first pass but checks the suitability of the 
following individuals and on the second run of the parade make a firm confident 
identification.   
Furthermore, the hybrid model theory proposed by the author may also explain the high 
levels of mis-identifications elicited during the target absent parades.  It may be suggested 
that the eye-witness uses the first showing of the entire parade to rank the individuals in 
order of similarity to their memory of the suspect and, during the second showing of the 
parade, using a relative judgment style, identify the best match parade member.   
However, in general the difference in the rate of false positive identifications between the 
two parade styles was found to be non significant for target absent parades.  Thus the eye-
witnesses who viewed the V.I.P.E.R. parade appear to be equally susceptible to the 
additional extraneous factors which promote the identification of an innocent foil during 
target absent parades.  These factors include the implicit priming associated with attendance 
at all identity parades: Why would they prepare an identity parade for me to view if the 
suspect wasnt there? (Wells, 1993), the difficulty linked with unfamiliar face recognition 
(Megreya & Burton, 2008; Kemp et al., 1997; Valentine et al., 2007; Megreya & Burton, 
2006; Newell, Chiroro & Valentine, 1999) and verbal overshadowing effects (Meissner & 
Brigham, 2001; Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990).   
The presence of the significant effect of recall from the target absent parades was 
interesting.  As discussed earlier, there was no evidence of the sequential superiority of the 
V.I.P.E.R. format over the traditional format.  However, there was a significant effect of recall 
delay, which was unexpected as it is a significant increase in the rate of correct rejections 
from just 25% when 2 hour delay compared with 60% at the 24 hour delay.  This is atypical 
of the published data which states a well established link between increasing recall delay 
and decreasing correct identifications/rejections (Deffenbacher et al., 2008; Memon et al., 
2003; Ebbesen & Rienick, 1998).   
This counter-intuitive effect of recall delay was surprising and so further examination of the 
participants allocated to the 2 hour recall delay condition was undertaken.  Upon closer 
examination, it was noted that there was a greater proportion of overseas students who had 
been randomly allocated to this particular condition compared to any of the other conditions. 
11 participants were overseas students; 9 were Asian and 2 were Zambian.  Moreover, 
several of these students (5) had only recently arrived in the United Kingdom and had not 
had extensive contact with Caucasian faces prior to their arrival.  It may be suggested then 
that the poor rate of correct rejections generated by those allocated to the 2 hour recall 
condition may be underpinned by the other race bias.  The other race bias is a well 
documented, robust effect characterised by a decreased ability to recognise and identify 
faces, and facial expressions, of people who do not belong to your own racial group (Sporer, 
2001;, Meissner & Brigham, 2001; Pedzek et al., 2003; Cross, Cross & Daly, 1971; Hancock 
& Rhodes, 2008).  Clearly, this is a confounding variable to the current research and the 
data would benefit from replication and more stringent controls on the allocation of 
participants.   
It is evident from the current results that there is no significant evidence of sequential 
superiority associated with the use of V.I.P.E.R. identity parades for target absent parades, 
just as there is no significant evidence to suggest that the simultaneous format is superior for 
target present identity parades.  Such data refutes previous claims that the sequential nature 
of V.I.P.E.R. may compromise the rate of correct identifications (Wells, 2008); it is suggested 
that this effect is due to the absolute judgment style which sequential identity parades 
reportedly fostered in eye-witnesses.  Pozzulo & Lindsay (1995) and Memon & Gabbert 
(2003) assert that while the witness may observe that the image of the suspect is familiar it 
may be tempting to reject the image in search of a better criterion match.  However, it must 
be noted that the procedure used in Memon & Gabberts 2003 study was completely 
sequential; the identity parade was stopped as soon as the witness made a selection.  Thus 
the findings are not a true reflection upon V.I.P.E.R. identity parades as the procedure does 
not adhere to PACE Code D (Home Office, 2008) which permits witnesses to view the entire 
identity parade twice before making identification.   
However, the data from the current study does not just refute these claims of limiting hit rate 
nor does it corroborate the data stating V.I.P.E.R. maintains the hit rate observed with 
simultaneous parades; the current findings establish a precedent for V.I.P.E.R. superiority 
for target present parades.  While this data was not found to be significant in the current 
study it may be more firmly established with further research making use of a larger and 
more diverse, representative sample population.   
This trend for sequential superiority did not extend, as expected, to target absent identity 
parades.  The overall trend of the data confirms that the V.I.P.E.R. format performed worse 
than the simultaneous format, eliciting a greater number of mis-identifications than the 
simultaneous format although this difference was not significant.  It is suggested that the 
poor performance of the eye-witnesses across the entire target absent series was facilitated 
by two major factors.  The first factor is the implicit priming each witness associates with 
their attendance at an identity parade (Wells, 1993).  Many witnesses appear to rationalise 
their attendance to view an identity as a confirmatory cue that the suspect will be present 
and thus inclines them towards making an identification.  Secondly, as posited earlier, the 
provisions of PACE Code D prohibits the implementation of a truly sequential format 
whereby the witness may identify the suspect immediately upon viewing them.  As PACE 
Code D requires each individual to be viewed twice before permitting a decision to be made 
the V.I.P.E.R. format appears to exist in a hybrid state between sequential and simultaneous 
formats and, as a result, the V.I.P.E.R. format does not completely eliminate the use of the 
relative judgment style.  Therefore, it is suggested that both of these factors influence eye-
witness performance during target absent identity parades.   
It is not surprising that the eye-witnesses performed poorly over all conditions across the 
target absent experiments; there is a wide range of publications which report witnesses poor 
ability to recognise unfamiliar faces (Megreya & Burton, 2006, 2008, Kemp et al., 1997, 
Valentine et al., 2007, Bruce et al., 2001, Hancock et al., 2000, Newell et al., 1999).  In their 
1997 study Kemp et al. tested the recognition performance of highly experienced cashiers 
for matching a live individual to credit card photographs.  The experiment reported a 
significantly high rate of false positive decisions, even when conditions were optimal for 
recognition.  This finding was supported by Megreya & Burton (2008) who also reported no 
benefit to recognition when matching live target to high quality photographs.  
However it is also hypothesised that there is an inherent advantage to video identity 
parades; several studies have reported a small but significant increase in recognition, for 
target present parades, and correct rejections for target absent parades when witnesses 
viewed both the full face and three quarter profile view of the suspect (Newell et al., 1999; 
Hancock et al., 1999; Bruce et al., 1987), and is particularly true for unfamiliar faces.  
However, more recent investigations into the three quarter face effect have found the effect 
to be weak at best (Liu & Chaudhuri, 2001).  Yet the data from the current study does not 
appear to corroborate such an effect.   
The results of the current study are undoubtedly contrary to the majority of published studies 
in the research community.  While there appears to be the beginnings of a pool of evidence 
suggesting sequential presentation of parade members to eye-witnesses elicits a superior hit 
rate for target present parades as compared to the simultaneous format (Steblay et al., 
2001; 2011; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; 
Valentine et al., 2007) the key finding is certainly the distinctly poor performance of the 
V.I.P.E.R. format for target absent identity parades.  While there have been concerns raised 
over the possibility of an indirect publishing bias (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et 
al., 2001; 2011) of more pressing concern is the procedural issues on which much of the 
claimed evidence for sequential superiority for target absent parades is derived.  As most of 
these studies have employed an absolute sequential procedure, as recommended by the 
community, the data generated has clear validity issues.  While their value is considerable 
as a means for supporting the adoption of a completely sequential nature their findings tell 
us very little about the merits of the V.I.P.E.R. procedure in its current state.  It may be 
accurate to state that there is a superiority effect for V.I.P.E.R. during target absent parades 
when a truly sequential procedure is employed however, at this moment bound by PACE 
Code D provisions, V.I.P.E.R. is not a truly sequential procedure and as the current study 
reflects, there is no evidence that the V.I.P.E.R identity parade format significantly reduces 
the rate of false identifications during target absent parades.

Using Special Measures when 
Testifying 
Introduction 
Testifying in court before the accused is possibly one of the most distressing results of 
witnessing crime.  It has been widely accepted that having to face the defendant whilst 
giving evidence has far reaching effects upon witnesses, jurors and the judicial system 
(Lipton, 1977; Loftus, 1975; Turtle & Wells, 1988; Kebbell & Giles, 2000; Wheatcroft, 
Wagstaff & Kebbell, 2004; Golding, Fryman, Marsil & Yozwiak, 2003; Regan & Baker, 1998; 
Golding, Sego, Polley & Hasemann, 1995; Goodman, Tobey, Batterman-Faunce, Orcutt, 
Thomas, Shapiro & Sachsenmaier, 1998).  In recent years legislative steps have been taken 
to improve the witness experience whilst attending court through reducing anxiety in relation 
to testifying.  The most prominent of these advancements in Scotland was the introduction of 
The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act of 2004 which allowed for a range of Special 
Measures to enable certain witnesses to give their best quality evidence to jurors by 
reducing witness anxiety (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004; Richards, Morris 
& Richards, 2008).   
The Special Measures are available to three specific subsets of witness: all children under 
the age of sixteen; adults who have a mental impairment and adults who have experienced 
intimidation and/or severe trauma in relation to their evidence (Vital Voices: Helping 
Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003, The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 
2004, The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999).  Many of the Special Measures 
were previously available to child witnesses but not for adult witnesses.  The present study 
does not address the issue of child vulnerable witnesses but rather uses an adult vulnerable 
witness.  Examination of the ethical implications associated with using child witnesses and 
the costs, both financial and time, were too prohibitive.  Despite this, because of the 
relatively recent extension of Special Measures to adults there is a decided scarcity of 
research examining the effects of adults using such Special Measures upon jurors 
perceptions, and so the current research was designed to focus solely on the adult 
vulnerable witness, rather than the child.   
But what are these Special Measures?  Many of them are already familiar to the public; use 
of a wooden screen, CCTV links, use of a supporter and several are perhaps less 
publicised; taking of evidence by a commissioner; pre-recorded video evidence and use of 
prior statements as evidence in chief (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act, 2004; The 
Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999).  Of these two are most commonly 
employed (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004): use of 
a screen and live CCTV links.  Use of a Screen is relatively simple and requires little 
procedural change in the trial process (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008); before the 
witness is presented to the court a large wooden screen is positioned in the courtroom.  This 
screen extends from the witness entrance, past the witness box and in front of the 
defendant.  Thus, the witness enters, testifies and leaves the court without ever having to 
make eye contact with the defendant.  Crucially, the screen does not impede the jury or the 
judges view of the witness and, so as to not contravene the rights of the defendant, the 
defendant can see the witness on a television screen.  The primary aim of using a screen to 
testify is to eliminate the necessity for the vulnerable witness to confront the defendant whilst 
testifying (Birch, 2000).   
Live CCTV links are also commonly used in courtrooms across the country (Richards, Morris 
& Richards, 2008).  When testifying in this manner the witness is not required to enter the 
court at any point.  Instead they deliver their evidence from an entirely separate location; 
frequently another room within the courthouse but not always, via two-way CCTV cameras.  
The witness is shown upon the television screens within the courtroom while the witness can 
see judge, prosecuting and defence counsel.  While there are some issues regarding the 
successful use of CCTV links they remain a popular choice for vulnerable and intimidated 
witnesses (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; 
Hamlyn, Phelps, Turtle & Sattar, 2004).   
Pre-recorded Video Evidence (PVE) is currently one of the more rarely used Special 
Measures, particularly by adult vulnerable witnesses (Criminal Law Review Editorial, 2004; 
Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Davies, Wilson, Mitchell & Milsom, 1995). It is most 
frequently used for witnesses who experience significant anxiety in relation to testifying or 
who have been subject to intense intimidation, in sexual abuse cases, hate crimes and 
serious domestic violence (Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 
2003). These witnesses are often the only witness for the prosecution and often have the 
most potentially damaging evidence, but, frequently, the quality of their evidence is impaired 
through their anxiety and fears.  Pre-recorded Video Evidence can completely remove the 
need for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to attend the trial; if the defence counsel 
agrees no cross-examination is required or attends the recording to question the witness at 
the arranged time.  It is for this reason that Pre-recorded Video Evidence is infrequently 
used in addition to concerns from judges regarding the fairness and effects of its introduction 
to court (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al, 2004).   
While the introduction of the Special Measures appear to have been warmly received by 
witnesses and witness support services it must also be mentioned that judicial professionals 
continue to have concerns regarding their implementation and the effects they may exert on 
jurors perceptions and trial outcomes.  There has been outspoken opposition from defence 
lawyers as there is concern that a witness being permitted to testify using Special Measures 
is perceived as an implicit admission of guilt by jurors (Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; 
Birch, 2000).   The Home Office has commissioned a number of studies to determine the 
legality of the Special Measures and to examine whether there is an implicit connotation of 
defendant guilt attached to a witness choosing to testify using Special Measures, specifically 
use of a live CCTV link and Pre-recorded Video Evidence. 
In examining the legality of the Special Measures permitted under current British law both 
Tausz & Ellison (2005) and Hoyano (2001) reviewed the Special Measures in relation to the 
European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) to determine if defendants rights are 
compromised.  It is the opinion of both of these papers that the conditions under which the 
Special Measures are permitted do not contravene defendants right to fair trial; indeed 
Hoyano (2001) states that use of live CCTV links may benefit the defendant by reducing the 
impact of witness testimony.  This finding is supported by Swim, Borgida & McCoys 1993 
experimental study which reported mock jurors as being less likely to convict when 
testimony was delivered via CCTV link.  Conversely, several experimental studies have 
found some evidence suggestive of a negative bias towards defendants when witnesses 
choose to testify using a Special Measure (Goodman et al, 1998; Swim et al, 1993).  In their 
1998 study Goodman, Tobey, Batterman-Faunce, Orcutt, Thomas, Shapiro & Sachsenmaier 
investigated the effect of CCTV testimony upon mock jurors.  Their results clearly show that 
although the mock jurors were no more likely to convict when CCTV testimony was used 
there was a weak but significant negative effect upon jurors perceptions of the defendant.  
Generally, as the scientific community remains divided over whether defendants right to due 
process are compromised by the use of Special Measures, members of the Scottish 
Justiciary, particularly defence lawyers and judges (Hamlyn et al, 2004; Burton, Evans & 
Sanders, 2006; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008), remain concerned over the issue.   
Jury groups are notoriously difficult to study (McCabe & Purves, 1974; Tinsley, 2001; 
Pennington & Hastie, 1999); deliberations are inherently secret and free from external 
observation.  It is because of this surety of the judicial system that research focusing on 
factors which may influence juror perceptions and trial verdicts relies almost entirely upon 
mock juror studies.  While some studies have attempted to use other methodologies such 
as the shadow jury (McCabe & Purves, 1974) or self-report measures completed by actual 
jurors after conclusion of the trial (Zander & Henderson, 1993; Findlay, 1994; Jackson, 
1996), the use of mock jurors and simulated trials is most commonly employed.  Moreover, 
many of these studies use mock jurors in isolation; there is no deliberation phase to the 
experiment (Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 2005; Landstrom & Granhag, 2008; Bornstein, 
1999; Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008; Goodman et al., 1998; Swim et al., 1993, Tetterton 
& Warren, 2005; Golding et al., 2003).  There are reasons for this, primarily that it is much 
more economical to recruit participants on an individual basis and collect their individual 
perceptions of the witness.  It is time-consuming and expensive to attempt to arrange a large 
group of participants to attend simultaneously and last minute drop-outs could lead to the 
experiment being scrapped due to insufficient numbers, particularly relevant in jury 
simulations (Bornstein, 1999; Pozzulo et al., 2008).  Of course, there are apparent 
disadvantages with this methodology; many mock juror studies have a preponderance of 
students acting as jurors due to their easy accessibility for researchers and, perhaps more 
importantly, that a key component of all jury trials is being ignored.  Addressing first the over-
use of students as mock jurors; this can be problematic for the resultant data.  There is 
research which has suggested that younger adults, particularly students, are more lenient 
and less likely to convict than older adults or non-students (Bornstein, 1999).  There are 
concerns that research findings derived from student populations have limited 
generalisability to the wider population due to the infrequency with which students serve on 
actual juries (Sears, 1986; Bray & Kerr, 1982).  Yet a relatively simple study by Finkel and 
colleagues (Fulero & Finkel,, 1991; Finkel & Duff, 1991; Finkel & Handel, 1989) asked two 
groups of mock jurors, students and non-students, to read through a pamphlet of 
hypothetical trials and asked them to deliver a verdict on each trial.  In each study, no 
difference was found between the students and non-students verdicts.  Regarding the 
absence of a deliberation phase to many mock juror studies, Bornstein (1999), in his review 
of jury research from the past 20 years is more open on this subject.  His analysis of the 
research has led him to conclude that while there is certainly a lack of research employing 
deliberation simulations, this does not mean that the published literature cannot be extended 
to the wider population.  More research is clearly required in this area to corroborate such 
claims.   
While there is a distinct lack of published data on the effects these Special Measures have 
on jurors when used by an adult witness, there is a small but established range of papers 
which have assessed the impact of the screen and CCTV link Special Measures when used 
by child witnesses.  Currently, there have been no studies investigating the effect Pre-
recorded Video Evidence exerts upon mock jurors perceptions of witnesses.   
The data from child studies has produced suggestive evidence that when the child witness 
testifies via CCTV link they are more confident, consistent and provide more detailed 
accounts and are less anxious (Goodman et al, 1998; Davies & Noon, 1991; Golding et al, 
2003; Wheatcroft et al, 2004; Regan & Baker, 1998).  Yet, when mock jurors are asked to 
view a child witness testifying in a open court with one who testifies via CCTV link, they rate 
the child in the open court as more credible, honest, detailed and confident than the child 
who testified via a live CCTV link ( Ross et al., 1994; Orcutt, Goodman, Tobey, Batterman-
Faunce & Thomas, 2001; Swim et al, 1993; Goodman et al, 1998) however, there is also 
evidence that jurors are less likely to convict when the child testified via live CCTV link 
(Swim et al, 1993; Goodman et al, 1998) and that jurors rate testimony delivered in this 
manner as having less immediacy and emotional impact upon them (Davies & Noon, 1991).  
Yet it must be noted that there are several other factors which may influence jurors 
perceptions of child witnesses.  Indeed, the degree to which adult jurors trust child witnesses 
varies dramatically across the literature (Quas, Thompson & Clarke-Stewart, 2005; 
Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 2007).  Firstly, there is a significant percentage of the adult 
population who fail to recognise the limitations of childrens autobiographical memory.  For 
example, in their 2005 study, Quas et al. asked potential jurors and students some general 
questions about childrens memory and testimony; e.g. If an 8 year old child had been 
repeatedly sexually abused as an infant, would they remember it?.  Their results were 
conflicting; 38% of their participants believed that children were no more susceptible to 
leading questions than adults were while 46% also believed that repeated use of open 
ended questions, such as Tell me what happened?, led children to make more frequent 
false claims.  This data suggested that adults both overestimate and underestimate the 
suggestibility of child witnesses.  It is also a robust finding that adults do have a general 
scepticism of childrens memories but are aware that younger children are more easily 
suggestible than older children (Quas et al., 2005; McAuliff & Kovera, 2007; Laimon & Poole, 
2008).  Finally, adults are more likely to believe a childs testimony when they are directly 
involved with the alleged crime rather than a bystander (Laimon & Poole, 2008; Goodman, 
Golding, Helgeson, Haith & Michelli, 1987). 
Despite much of the data deriving from child witnesses, the frequency with which this finding 
of diminished impact and lack of immediacy of testimony has been reported in the literature 
suggests it to be a prevalent phenomenon (Davies & Noon, 1991; Swim et al, 1993; 
Goodman et al, 1998; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 
2005; Landstrom et al., 2007), to the extent that members of the judicial community are 
advised to caution all witnesses of the effect when considering employing Special Measures 
(Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al, 2006).  But why do jurors appear to 
perceive witnesses who testify from out with the courtroom as less credible and thus attach 
less weight to their evidence?  The one school of thought on this issue is that testimony 
delivered from outside the courtroom limits the jurors ability to assess the witness 
completely, as would be possible in an open court with no Special Measures (Richards, 
Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al, 2006; Davies & Noon, 1991; Goodman et al, 1998; 
Landstrom et al., 2005; 2008; Nisbett & Ross, 1980).  There is a substantial body of 
evidence which clearly indicates that jurors rely not only upon the content of the witness 
testimony but more importantly upon body language indicators (Boccaccini, 2002; Penrod & 
Cutler, 1995; Tetterton & Warren, 2005; OBarr, 1974; Landry & Brigham, 1992; Orcutt et al, 
2001; Landstrom et al, 2005), emotional demeanour (Golding et al, 2003) and verbal quality 
(Boccaccini, 2002; Wheatcroft et al, 2004).  Certainly all of these factors are available when 
the witness testifies in an open court or from behind a wooden screen; however an issue 
arises when the witness elects to testify via CCTV link or Pre-recorded Video Evidence.  
Both of these presentation methods restrict the degree to which jurors may observe the 
witness: both formats provide only a limited view of the witness (from the shoulders 
upwards) thus there is no opportunity to note the complete body language of the witness.  
Employing a live CCTV link to testify has some advantage to jurors over Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence as the examination and cross is conducted live.  Therefore the jurors may still 
observe the witness emotional response to questioning which aids in their determination of 
witness credibility, accuracy and deceitfulness (Tetterton & Warren, 2005; Landstrom et al, 
2005; Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Golding et al, 2003).  Conversely, Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence removes the adversarial nature of trial entirely and thus deprives jurors of 
emotional response in addition to limiting body language.  It appears that the cues used by 
jurors to assess witnesses are severely diminished when testimony is delivered from outside 
the courtroom leading jurors to perceive them as less credible and accurate and detracting 
from immediacy of the testimony and weakening the emotional impact that that witness 
exerts upon each member of the jury (Davies & Noon, 1991).   
A related theory is that of the vividness effect proposed by Nisbett & Ross in 1980.  
According to this theory, the more vivid the testimony, the more positively it is received and 
testimonies are considered vivid if they are emotionally interesting, concrete and imagery-
provoking and proximal in a sensory, temporal or spatial way (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p.45).  
Vivid testimonies have been shown to be perceived as more credible, are more likely to be 
remembered and are attended to more by jurors when compared to pallid testimonies (Bell & 
Loftus, 1985).  Presentation mode of the testimony is an obvious factor which can affect the 
vividness of a witness testimony and is of particular relevance to the use of Special 
Measures in court.  Proximal, face-to-face interaction is considered to be more vivid than a 
distal presentation method, such as via CCTV link or Pre-recorded Video Evidence.  Under 
the terms of Nisbett & Rosss theory, proximal information is more emotionally involving and 
more intense and so it can be proposed that live testimonies are more vivid, due to their 
face-to-face interaction, compared to distal testimony presentation methods.  Due to this 
increased vividness, it can be speculated that jurors are more likely to perceive live 
testimonies as more positive, emotional, credible and memorable.   
Thus the current study aimed to address some of the persisting issues and debate 
surrounding the implementation of Special Measures.  Of the range of Measures currently 
available to vulnerable and/or intimidated witnesses three were identified as being of most 
interest; use of a wooden screen; live CCTV link and pre-recorded video evidence.  The use 
of a wooden screen and live CCTV link Measures were selected on the basis of their 
frequency of use; CCTV links are most commonly requested with 42.2% of the 787 identified 
vulnerable and/or intimidated witnesses identified by a 2008 review conducted on behalf of 
the Scottish Executive (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008) while screens are employed by 
22.5%.  Conversely, Pre-recorded Video Evidence was selected for investigation as it is a 
non-standard Special Measure, used in highly stressful cases only, and is the Measure 
which requires the most significant change in trial procedure and early engagement by all 
interested parties (The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004; Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008; The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999).  In their 2008 review 
Richards, Morris & Richards report only one occasion where Pre-recorded Video Evidence 
has been permitted for a single witness, an implementation rate of just 0.12%. 
It is therefore apparent that although the implementation of Special Measures in Scotland, 
and the wider United Kingdom, has become widespread, there remains a distinct lack of 
scientific evidence to settle the divergent views of practitioners and psychologists in view of 
how using a Special Measure to testify alters jurors perceptions of adult witnesses, 
regardless of testimony content.  Furthermore there is a need for further evidence to clarify 
whether Special Measures compromise jurors perception of defendant guilt and readiness 
to convict.  To do so, the current series of experiments were designed to determine exactly 
how jurors perceive witnesses who choose to testify via Special Measures.  Mock trials 
would be recorded and the mock jurors asked to rate how credible they perceive the witness 
to be, how accurate they feel their story to be and to deliver a verdict upon the case, guilty or 
not guilty.   
It was hypothesised that the use of Special Measures would be associated with decreased 
ratings of witness credibility and believability and thus decreased conviction rates.  More 
specifically, it was hypothesised that the ratings of the witness and conviction rates would 
decrease progressively as the witness became increasingly removed from the courtroom 
and mock jurors: generally that the ratings of the witness and conviction rates would be 
strongest in the Open Court condition, followed by Use of a Screen; Live CCTV Link and 
finally Pre-Recorded Video Evidence.  Therefore it was expected that the Special Measure 
Pre-Recorded Video Evidence would be associated with significantly poorer ratings of 
witness credibility and believability and poorer conviction rates than those given to the 
witness who testified in the Open Court condition.   
Development of Stimulus Materials 
Trial Transcripts 
The content of the trial testimony and cross-examination was adapted from a historical trial 
transcript obtained through The National Archives for Scotland.  The transcript was taken 
from a 1998 aggravated assault trial from the High Court of Justiciary in Glasgow; all 
personally identifiable details were removed and substituted.  In this trial, the prosecution 
attempted to demonstrate that the defendant committed aggravated assault when he threw a 
rock at the victim before physically attacking the witness.  The defence contended that the 
defendant was not guilty of the attack; that someone else had thrown the rock and attacked 
the witness.  The witness in this trial was not entitled to use Special Measures to testify as 
this trial took place before Special Measures were extended to adult witnesses.  In order to 
mark the witness as vulnerable it was developed that the witness had been subjected to 
intimidation in relation to their testifying.  This is not an unreasonable estimation as the 
witness themselves testifies about the group people who were with the accused at the time 
of the offence and who were behaving threateningly towards them.  Thus, it was determined 
that the witness in the trial transcript to be used would have been deemed a vulnerable adult 
witness and permitted the choice of testifying via Special Measures.  The script used by the 
actors was identical for both the control condition and the experimental conditions  
There is a clear documented effect that extremes of witness confidence can significantly 
affect jurors perceptions of vulnerable witnesses (Golding et al, 2003; Cliff & Burton, 
unpublished manuscript) thus the transcript of the trial was manipulated so as to avoid 
extreme confidence or anxiety.  Importantly the factual content of the testimony and cross-
examination from the original transcript remained unchanged; the actors scripts were 
designed to be delivered in a more naturalistic style and communicate a typical level of 
anxiety experienced by many witnesses attending court; anxiety about the questioning, 
facing the accused, giving their evidence in the best manner and being in an unfamiliar 
situation.  However, even mild behavioural cues of nervousness are often interpreted by 
jurors are evidence of deceitful behaviour (Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998; 
Boccaccini & Brodsky, 2002) and this can be difficult to overcome.    
In order to control for expressed and perceived witness confidence the parameters which 
define a nervous and a confident witness had to be identified.  These parameters were 
based on the descriptors of a nervous witness and a confident witness as described by the 
voluminous publications of the Law and Language Society established in 1974 by William 
OBarr (Conley & OBarr, 1998; Gibbons, 1995; Conley, OBarr, & Lind, 1978; Erickson, Lind, 
Johnson, & OBarr, 1978; Lind, Erickson, Conley, & OBarr, 1978; OBarr, 1982; OBarr & 
Conley, 1976).  Witness confidence is derived through all behaviour that witnesses engage 
in whilst delivering their testimony and includes body language, demeanour, attractiveness 
and displays of status in addition to testimony content and speech patterns.  The Law and 
Language Society have extensively examined different witness speech patterns in order to 
determine the effects such patterns may exert upon mock jurors.  The findings from the 
Society are prolific and provide detailed evidence of the common verbal indicators used by 
jurors to determine a witness confidence and identify deceit and thus credibility.  Firstly the 
results clearly demonstrated that a nervous witness is hesitant when answering questions, 
expresses uncertainty in their recollection of the incident and typically uses many intensifiers 
(very; surely), hesitation forms (uh..; err; and well), and hedges (sort of, kind of).  In 
addition, nervous witnesses tend to provide brief answers which lack detail leading to 
frequent breaks in story formation and frequent questioning from solicitors.  Finally, nervous 
witnesses typically tend to employ an overly polite speech style to address their questioner 
and try to enhance their credibility and status by using low frequency words in place of high 
frequency words; i.e., utilise in place of use.   
As expected the findings of The Law and Language Society identified a confident witness as 
verbally the complete opposite of a nervous witness.  When questioned, a highly confident 
witness will provide highly descriptive answers and will yield a continuous, coherent 
narrative interspersed with few questions.  The confident witness will express confidence in 
the veracity of their memories of the incident, display genuine emotions and their testimony 
will be typified by a lack of hesitation forms, intensifiers and hedges.    
However, jurors rely on much more than verbal quality and content of testimony when 
determining witness credibility and believability (Aron & Rosner, 1998, Boccaccini, 2002).  
The conscious and unconscious behaviour witnesses engage in during testimony provide 
the juror with valuable insight as to the internal state of the witness and allows jurors to 
make a more informed determination of witness credibility (Boccaccini, 2002).  It has been 
claimed that verbal content makes up only 7% of conveyed information while tone of voice 
conveys 38%.  The remaining 55% is conveyed through non-verbal behaviour (Mehrabian, 
1981), body language, which can reinforce or contradict the verbal testimony.   
This 55%-38%-7% ratio has seemingly been overstated in the literature; even Mehrabian 
acknowledges that this derived ratio is a blatant mis-interpretation of his research findings 
(http://www.kaaj.com/psych/smorder.html).  Mehrabians (1981) equation was derived from 
research asking participants to make judgements about the emotional state of a speaker 
after hearing them speak just one, single word.  Mehrabian clearly states that his theory, 
which he did not prove in this study, applies only when the speaker is talking about their own 
feelings and attitudes (http://www.kaaj.com/psych/smorder.html).  However, more recent 
research has found that non-verbal behaviour is just as important to jurors decision making 
processes as verbal cues, quality and content (Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002; 
OBarr, 1974; Boccaccini, Gordon & Brodsky, 2005) and the use of non-verbal behaviour as 
a cue to determine reliability and credibility has been shown in children as young as 2 years 
of age (Birch, Akmal & Frampton, 2010; Fusaro & Harris, 2008).  It is very difficult to control 
our non verbal behaviour, therefore when a witness verbal testimony is incongruent with 
their body language and tone of voice it is highly likely that a juror will recognise such 
disparity and may view this as evidence of deceit and unreliability.  This is why witness 
preparation, particularly in the United States, has become a significant pre-trial activity 
(Boccaccini, Gordon & Brodsky, 2005; Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998), especially 
as intensive training can significantly improve a clients perceived credibility and honesty in 
the eyes of a juror (Boccaccini et al., 2005; Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 1998). 
Aron & Rosner (1998) reviewed a wide body of studies examining the effects of body 
language highlighted commonly observed indicators of nervousness.  These findings have 
further been corroborated in Boccaccinis 2002 meta-analysis and as ancillary observations 
from the extensive Law and Language Society studies.  Typically, nervous witnesses often 
engage in averting their eyes to minimise eye contact; a major indicator of nervousness but 
often perceived as deceit.  In addition, nervous witness were observed to have fidgeted 
more; constantly shifting their posture, making repeated use of self adaptor gestures 
(touching or moving their own body); and object adaptors such as playing with nearby items 
(a pencil) or tapping fingers on a desk.  Again, these indicators of anxiety are often 
construed by jurors as signs of deceitfulness and of a conflicted internal emotional state.  
While all of these behavioural cues are used by jurors to make a determination of witness 
veracity and credibility, eye contact and gaze is commonly reported as the primary factor 
used to gauge credibility (Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002).   
As previously seen with verbal communication, the body language of highly confident 
witnesses is typified as polar opposite to that of a nervous witness. The findings 
demonstrate that they use frequent illustrator gestures to intensify what they are saying (for 
example: pointing to defendant or injuries); make infrequent shifts in posture, appear relaxed 
and face the jury.  Furthermore, highly confidant witnesses were generally found to speak in 
a moderately loud voice with varying pitch, lean forward slightly and, most importantly, make 
frequent eye contact, particularly with the jury (Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002).   
However, there is some evidence that the verbal and behavioural characteristics of both 
nervous and confident witnesses are exhibited by a deceitful person (Porter, Doucette, 
Woodworth, Earle & MacNeil, 2008).  In their study, Porter et al. (2008) examined the verbal 
and non-verbal behaviours exhibit by both criminal offenders and non-offender participants 
when repeating planned truthful and deceptive accounts of an event.  Participants were 
videotaped whilst repeating their planned truthful and deceptive accounts and these video 
recordings were later analysed for behavioural patterns.  Their results clearly revealed that 
both the offenders and non-offenders engaged in similar patterns of behaviour when they 
were being deceptive.  The deceptive accounts from both groups of participants had fewer 
details than their honest account, similar to a nervous, honest witness, and made frequent 
use of illustrator gestures, like a confident, honest witness.  Further analysis revealed that 
only the offenders exhibited a significant increase in the use of self-adaptor gestures and a 
significant decrease in emotional behaviour when they were lying.  The authors suggest that 
their results show evidence of offenders awareness of the relationship between non-verbal 
behaviours and perceived credibility but their results plainly illustrate how the verbal and non 
verbal behaviours of honest witnesses, anxious or confident, can be mis-construed by jurors.   
Expressed and perceived witness confidence clearly exerts a powerful influence over jurors 
perceptions and decisions.  Thus the original trial transcript was manipulated to avoid any 
overt indicators of confidence or anxiety but rather to contain some elements of witness 
anxiety and confidence in both verbal and non-verbal communication (Appendix 3).   
The transcript required more extensive alteration to accommodate the nature of pre-
recorded video evidence.  This Special Measure is typically a statement of the incident given 
by the witness with some cross-examination by the defence.  Therefore the transcript was 
altered to remove all of the prosecution questioning to leave a detailed, coherent account of 
the incident delivered in a similar manner to the full testimony.     
Mock Trial Videos 
Advertisements were placed around the University campus to recruit actors to portray the 
necessary roles within the mock trials.  It was specified within the advert that all applicants 
should have some acting experience and be available for rehearsal and recording over the 
coming six weeks.  After a two week recruitment period auditions were held and recorded for 
each of the 45 respondents and, after review, five actors were recruited for the roles of the 
witness (one male and one female), procurator fiscal, defence lawyer and judge.  Following 
a briefing where the aims of the experiment and the importance of conveying the appropriate 
level of anxiety were explained a further two weeks were designated for rehearsal.  
Throughout the rehearsal fortnight the two actors playing the role of the witness were 
required to attend daily sessions together while the entire ensemble would meet bi-weekly to 
rehearse together.  The witness actors were asked to attend daily for two reasons: firstly 
their role required much more intensive rehearsal as it included non-verbal communication in 
addition to learning the script and tone of delivery.  Secondly, as gender differences were to 
be control for by having participants watch a gender specific witness it was important that 
both of the witness actors were very closely matched in terms of script delivery and body 
language.  There was a high degree of flexibility required to accommodate all five actors 
schedules but all attended at least four rehearsal sessions while the witness actors 
attended fourteen rehearsal sessions.  All the actors received payment of 6 per hour 
throughout rehearsal and recording.   
The mock courtroom at the University of Glasgow was booked for an entire day when all the 
actors could attend.  However, on the day of recording the judge actor did not attend and 
thus the recording procedure was altered that only the four remaining actors would be on 
screen while the experimenter read the lines of the judge.   The actors undertook several 
practice sessions whilst the experimenter prepared the equipment for recording.   
The mock courtroom is a smaller scale model of a real courtroom based in the Law 
Department at the University of Glasgow.  There were four mock trial videos to be recorded; 
testifying in an open court with no Special Measures, use of a screen, live CCTV link and 
pre-recorded video evidence.    The experimental conditions required additional equipment: 
a large wooden screen to be positioned alongside the witness box; and a computer monitor 
to place next to the witness box to display the witness when testifying via CCTV link and pre-
recorded video evidence.   
Within the court a Panasonic SDR-S70 video camera was positioned in the front row of the 
jury box directly opposite the witness box at a distance of ten feet.  The camera was 
positioned at head height level with the witness.  This was the sole camera throughout as 
the trial videos were designed to simulate the actual view from the jury box when in trial.  
The mock trials were all held in accordance with current Scots Law however the videos did 
not depict an entire trial instead focussing on the evidence from the only witness in the case: 
the victim.   Thus the mock trial videos were seven minutes in duration for the control (open 
court), use of a screen and live CCTV link conditions whilst the video where the witness 
testified via pre-recorded video statement was four minutes.   
The Open Court condition video shows the witness testifying in the normal manner with no 
special measures.  As the courtroom was smaller than anticipated the questioning of the 
witness by the procurator fiscal and defence lawyer came from off-screen.  The Screen 
condition was recorded in exactly the same manner with the addition of a wooden screen 
next to the witness box.  When recording the CCTV condition the video camera was 
adjusted to a tight focus on the witness head and shoulders so that none of the courtroom 
could be seen.  This video was later played back on the computer monitor and recorded 
from the original wide angle in order to simulate live CCTV link testimony from a separate 
location.  Finally the witness was then recorded, using a tight focus again, making a 
statement of their testimony.  This recording was played back on the computer monitor in the 
courtroom to simulate the delivery of Pre-recorded Video Evidence.  Still images taken from 
the mock trial videos show the viewpoint of the jury throughout each mock trial video (See 
photo 1).   
There is strong documented evidence of a gender bias within jury groups (Boccaccini, 2002; 
Aron & Rosner, 1998; Kramer, Kerr & Carroll, 1990; ForsterLee, ForsterLee, Horowitz & 
King, 2003; Quas, Bottoms, Haegerich & Nysse-Carris, 2006; Wayne, Riordan & Thomas, 
2001); typically, female jurors are harsher in their judgements of male defendants, a robust 
finding that encompasses both criminal trials for sexual abuse and murder and civil trials.  
For example, in their 2001 study, Wayne et al. examined mock jurors perceptions of a range 
of sexual harassment cases.  Theirs was a 2 (harasser gender) x 2 (target gender) x 2 (juror 
gender) design using 408 mock jurors.  Wayne et al. found that the mock jurors were more 
likely to convict the harasser when they were of an opposite gender to themselves.  
Therefore, to control for gender effects, each of the four mock trial videos were recorded 
twice; once with a female witness and again with a male witness.  Male jurors viewed the 
male witness testifying whilst the female jurors viewed the female witness testimony.

2. Use of a Screen, 3. Live CCTV Link, 4. Pre-recorded Video Evidence. 
After recording of the eight mock trials the actors were released but remained available for 
any necessary reshoots for the next two weeks.  The resolution across all of the video clips 
was 380TVL.  Minor editing was performed on the videos to remove some of the more 
intrusive background noise.  Using QuickTime Pro, the audio tracks were separated and any 
intrusive background noise which impacted upon the voice of the witness was isolated and 
removed.  The audio was then encoded at a rate of 320Kbps to optimise the delivered audio 
quality.   
Focus Groups 
It was thought prudent to test the quality of the stimuli before moving forward with such a 
large scale study.  In order to draw valid conclusions regarding the effects of the use of 
Special Measures the confidence and anxiety of the witness as perceived by the jurors 
needed to be of a similar level across all conditions and, more importantly, needed to convey 
a midline level of confidence or anxiety, avoiding extremes of either emotion.   
Therefore, a focus group was organised to view each of the trial videos and rate the 
confidence of the witness each time.  Fifteen participants were recruited from the student 
population of the University of Glasgow.  None of the participants had any prior experience 
of serving on a jury.  Each participant received a response sheet (Appendix 4) printed with 
eight Likert scales, one for each witness video.  The participants were required to mark each 
witness on this ten point scale; 1 being extremely nervous and 10 extremely confident.  The 
participants were not permitted to discuss their impressions and were instructed to provide 
their immediate perceptions.  After all eight videos had been rated the participants were 
encourage to voice their opinions of what they had seen and to identify what behaviour had 
les them to this opinion.  The focus group comments were recorded on audiotape for later 
reference.   
The results from the Likert scales and discussion gave a strong indication that there was a 
problem with the stimuli videos.    A range of scores (3-7, 1 Standard Deviation) had been 
pre-determined by the experimenter as conveying a moderate level of confidence/anxiety 
thus any averaged score from the focus group out with of this range would be indicative of 
emotional extremes which may taint the primary aims of the study.  The average Likert scale 
score across all eight mock trial videos from the 15 focus group participants was 8.72 
(SD=1.12) thus the witnesses in the mock trial videos were expressing too much confidence.  
Analysis of the audio taped discussions revealed that the participants felt that the witnesses 
were exhibiting strong, continuous eye contact and were very relaxed whilst testifying with 
little movement or fidgeting.   
Therefore, on the basis of the results the witness actors were called for re-recording while 
the dialogue from the remaining actors would be played back via audio tape.  Before re-
filming the actors listened to the focus groups comments on their performance and 
suggestions were made to rectify the perceived high confidence in their performances.   
After editing, a second focus group of 15 participants were recruited to repeat the process of 
stimulus checking.  The procedure used was identical to the previous focus group as was 
the assessment criteria for the responses.   
However, the analysis of the Likert scores and discussions again identified an issue with the 
perceived confidence of the witness actors across all eight mock trial videos.  The average 
confidence score for the witness actors across all of the eight videos was just 2.57 
(SD=2.18) and discourse analysis highlighted a behavioural issue in that the actors 
appeared evasive, did not make consistent eye contact and used too many hesitation forms 
and intensifiers in their speech.   
For a second time, the witness actors were brought back for re-filming and again listened to 
the audiotapes from both focus groups and the previous stimuli videos before proceeding 
with re-recording.  There was no need to alter their behavioural mannerisms from the 
previous re-shoot all that was required was a slight increase in jury directed eye contact and 
gaze and to remove some of the hesitations in their speech.   
A third focus group was arranged to test the suitability of the re-recorded mock trial videos.  
The procedure was identical to that employed in the previous two focus groups as was the 
assessment criteria.  Results from the Likert scales suggested that the trial videos were 
conveying an appropriately moderate confidence level; the average confidence score was 
6.31 (SD=1.76) across all eight videos.  While the mean score was well within the pre-
determined range of acceptable scores, allowing for the standard deviation of 1.76 pushed 
this out with the pre-determined range of 3-7 (4.58, 8.07).  Upon closer examination, it was 
evident that one participant had scored the witness the maximum (10).  Removal of this 
participant and their score yielded a mean confidence score of 5.86 with a standard 
deviation of 1.21 from the remaining 14 participants.  While the standard deviation still 
placed this mean outside the predetermined range of 3-7 (4.65, 7.07) it was only marginally 
so.  It was thus decided that the additional costs and time required to re-record and re-test 
the stimulus materials due to such a small infringement of the predetermined range of 
scores would be excessive. Therefore the mock trial videos were approved for further use in 
the experimental study and no further adjustments and re-shoots were necessary.   
The focus groups also threw up an unexpected point of interest. During the debriefings the 
participants were also asked open-ended questions regarding their perception of the 
witness credibility and accuracy.  Several of the participants felt that they were not able to 
give a judgement on the witness accuracy as they did not have a factual knowledge of the 
event in question.  In discussion with the wider focus group, it became apparent that the 
term accuracy was difficult for the participants to grasp; many reported feeling that 
accuracy related to the factual context of the event and that, as they did not have such 
knowledge, it was imprudent to determine the accuracy of the witness testimony.  Research 
has shown that jurors do not examine each piece of evidence in isolation and combine it 
after the trial concludes; instead, jurors tend to formulate a story continuously through 
evidence presentation and testimony, assessing and analysing each piece of information 
and placing it in their story for a coherent picture of the event (Pennington & Hastie, 1990; 
Hastie et al., 1983; Tinsley, 2001).  Without a factual framework upon which to base their 
perception of witness accuracy, jurors are likely to struggle with building their evidentiary 
storyline.  Further discussion with the focus group participants revealed that they felt 
believability of the witness was a better construct rather than accuracy.  Believability of 
the witness allows the mock juror to rate their perceptions of the witnesss plausibility; a 
rating of how strongly the juror believes the witness story of the event.  It was concluded by 
the participants that believability was based largely upon the content of the witness 
testimony.  Discussion of the credibility measurement construct was undertaken with the 
focus group participants.  Witness credibility was widely recognised by the participants to 
be a rating of how trustworthy or deceitful the witness was perceived to be; a judgement 
based predominantly on non-verbal behaviour but also emotional cues.   
Pilot Study 
There is currently little research investigating the effect Special Measures exert upon jurors 
perception of witnesses, therefore it was considered prudent to undertake a small scale pilot 
study to determine if the Special Measures do have an effect upon jurors deliberations and 
decisions and the extent of any effect.   
Participants  
Thirty undergraduate Psychology students from the University of Glasgow were recruited to 
participate.  In line with current UK jury duty guidelines each participant was required to be a 
UK citizen and 18 years old.  The mean age of the participants was 20.86 years (SD=3.16 
years) and twenty-one were female.  None of the participants had any prior experience of 
serving as a juror.  All participants received payment for their time in the form of course 
credits.   
Materials 
Participants viewed the mock trial videos on a 17 inch iMac G5 computer monitor with a 
screen resolution of 1600x900.  Audio was played back over the internal speakers which 
were high efficiency 17 watt amplifiers.  Participants indicated their perceptions of witness 
credibility, believability and confidence on a set of Likert scales and were also asked to 
provide a verdict decision upon the case (Appendix 5). 
Design 
The experiment was a within subject design where the thirty participants were randomly 
allocated into one of three groups, (Open Court vs. Screen, Open Court vs. CCTV link, Open 
Court vs. Pre-recorded Video Evidence).  Each participant would view the control trial video 
before viewing one of the three experimental videos.  The participants were run on an 
individual basis, in line with the typical methodology for mock juror simulation studies.  The 
order of presentation was counter-balanced with a short distracter task to minimise carry-
over effects.  There were four dependent measures: witness credibility, witness believability 
and witness confidence, all rated upon a ten point Likert Scale (1=not very..., 10=highly...).  
The fourth dependent measure was the verdict decision which was a dichotomous choice 
between Not Guilty and Guilty.   
Procedure 
The participant was seated before a 17 inch iMac G5 computer monitor (resolution 1600 x 
900) in a quiet room.  They were told that they are a juror in an assault case and they are 
about to hear testimony from a witness.  The witness may testify in an open court or may 
choose to use one of three Special Measures: use of a screen, live CCTV link or Pre-
recorded Video Evidence.  They were instructed not to make any assumptions about the 
reasons why the witness is testifying using a Special Measure.   
The participant viewed the Open Court video and then rated their perceptions of the witness 
on each of the three Likert scales for credibility, believability and confidence.  Each 
participant was also required to deliver a verdict based upon what they had seen and heard.  
A short distracter task was then administered before the participant viewed a second mock 
trial video, one of the three experimental conditions (Screen, CCTV, PVE).  Upon completion 
the participant rated the witness and delivered a verdict upon the case.   
Results 
The data was analysed using one way ANOVAs to determine any significant differences in 
witness credibility and believability ratings and confidence scores.  As the verdict data was 
categorical, logistic regression analysis was use to further analyse the data.   
Open Court vs. Use of a Screen 
The mean credibility score of the witness when they testified in an Open Court was 7.00 
(SD=1.155) compared with 5.40 (SD=0.843) when they used a Screen.  The mean 
believability score was 5.70 (SD=0.949) in the Open Court condition compared with 5.40 
(SD=0.843) in the Screen condition and the mean confidence rating was 5.40 (0.843) in the 
Open Court condition compared with 4.60 (SD=1.350) in the Screen condition (See Table 1).  
The number of guilty verdicts was identical in both conditions with 80% of the participants 
returning a guilty verdict.

A one way ANOVA revealed the difference in credibility scores to be highly significant 
(F(1,18)=12.52, p<0.002) thus the witness is perceived as significantly less credible when 
they elect to testify from behind a screen.  The difference in believability scores 
(F(1,18)=0.56, p>0.05) and confidence ratings (F(1,18)=2.53, p>0.05) were both non-
significant.  As both conditions returned an 80% conviction rate there was no effect upon 
verdict decisions, despite there being a significant decline in witness credibility.   
Open Court vs. Live CCTV link 
The jurors mean credibility scores for the Open Court witness was 7.60 (SD=1.075) 
compared to 6.70 (SD= 0.949) (see Table 2) when the witness testified via a live CCTV link.  
The mean believability scores for the Open Court witness was 5.70 (SD=1.494) compared to 
6.20 (SD=1.229) for the CCTV condition witness.  The Open Court witness received a mean 
confidence rating of 5.40 (SD=1.265) compared with a mean confidence rating of 3.60 
(SD=1.265) in the CCTV condition.  80% of the participants returned a guilty verdict after 
viewing the Open Court condition while the rate of guilty verdicts was 70% in the CCTV 
condition.

A one way ANOVA showed the difference in credibility scores between the Open Court and 
CCTV conditions to be non-significant (F(1,18)=3.94, p>0.05) as was the difference in mean 
believability scores (F(1,18)=0.67, p>0.05).  There was a highly significant difference 
between the mean confidence scores in the Open Court and CCTV conditions 
(F(1,18)=10.13, p<0.005) thus the participants perceived the witness as significantly more 
confident when they testified in an Open Court rather than via a CCTV link.  There was no 
significant difference in verdict decision between the Open Court and CCTV condition 
=0.24, p>0.5).   
Open Court vs. Pre-recorded Video Evidence 
The mean credibility score of the witness was 7.50 (SD=1.080) when testimony was given in 
an Open Court compared to a mean score of 4.60 (SD=0.966) when Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence was used.  Mean believability scores were 6.00 (SD=1.414) in the Open Court 
condition compared to a mean score of 4.70 (SD=0.823) in the PVE condition.  The mean 
confidence scores awarded to the witness in the Open Court condition was 5.10 (SD=0.876) 
compared to a mean score of 3.50 (SD=1.080)in the CCTV condition.  The rate of guilty 
verdicts dramatically declined from 70% in the Open Court condition to 40% in the PVE 
condition (see Table 3).

One way ANOVAs revealed a highly significant difference between the Open Court and 
PVE conditions mean credibility scores (F(1,18)=40.05, p<0.001) and mean believability 
scores (F(1,18)=6.31, p<0.025) indicating that the participants perceived the witness as 
significantly less credible and believable when they elect to testify via pre-recorded video 
evidence.  There was also a significant difference in the mean confidence ratings given to 
the witness between the two conditions (F(1,18)=13.24, p<0.002) strongly suggesting that 
the participants perceived the witness as significantly more anxious when they testified via 
pre-re-corded video evidence.  Finally, logistic regression analysis revealed that there was 
no significant difference in the rate of guilty verdicts between the two conditions.   
Conclusions 
The results from the pilot study returned some interesting patterns as a result of using 
Special Measures to testify in court.  The data strongly suggests that witnesses are 
perceived as significantly less credible when they choose to testify either from behind a 
wooden screen or via pre-recorded video evidence.  While there is evidence of a similar 
declining trend when a witness uses a live CCTV link to testify the difference when 
compared to the control condition was not significant.  It was surprising that the significant 
decline in credibility scores was not linked to a decrease in believability ratings when a 
screen was employed.  The analysis does identify such a pattern though when pre-recorded 
video evidence is used in court, believability ratings decreased significantly over the open 
court condition.  Equally unexpected was the finding that there was no decrease in the rate 
of guilty verdicts when there is a similar decline in credibility scores, as seen when a wooden 
screen is employed as a protective measure.  However such an association was observed in 
the pre-recorded video evidence condition where the rate of guilty verdicts was almost 
halved, although this was not significant.   
The confidence scores were included in the pilot study responses as a manipulation check 
to ensure that there was not an extreme disparity in perceived confidence of the witness 
between the control and experimental conditions.  There were significant difference returned 
in the control vs. live CCTV link comparison and the control vs. pre-recorded video evidence.  
Both ANOVAs found that there was a significant decline in perceived witness confidence 
between the control condition and the experimental conditions; that the witness was seen as 
less confident when they elected to testify via a live CCTV link or pre-recorded video 
evidence.   However, as none of the mean confidence scores deviated outside of the pre-
determined moderate range (3-7 points) it was felt unnecessary to re-work the relevant 
stimulus mock trial videos.   
The pilot study gave clear, indicative results of there being an issue with the use of Special 
Measures whilst testifying in court.  The original pilot study was therefore expanded onto a 
much larger scale to fully investigate the effects of using Special Measures exerts upon 
jurors perceptions of vulnerable witnesses.   
Experiment 1(a) Open Court vs. Use of a Screen 
Introduction 
By placing a wooden screen alongside the witness box, shielding the witness from the gaze 
of the defendant the vulnerable witness is able to present their testimony in a coherent 
manner to the jury.  However, there are concerns amongst defence lawyers that such a 
concession insinuates defendant guilt before testimony is even begun (Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008; Birch, 2000; Hoyano, 2001; Tausz & Ellison, 2005).  Thus it would not be 
unreasonable to expect that the jurors would perceive a witness testifying in this manner as 
more credible and believable than if the same witness testified in an open court.  However, 
data from the pilot study suggests an opposite trend; that using a screen during testimony 
leads to decreased ratings of credibility and believability.  Clearly there is a need for further 
study into the effect that employing a screen during testimony has upon jurors perceptions of 
that witness and the effect that the jurors perceptions have upon the trial outcome.   
Design 
The experiment was a repeated measures design in which all participants viewed both the 
Open Court condition and the Screen condition.  The dependent measures were the ratings 
of witness credibility and believability on a ten point Likert scale, and verdict decision (not 
guilty/guilty).  As the stimulus videos had been carefully manipulated to control for extremes 
of witness confidence, the participants were also asked to rate the witness confidence.  Any 
participant who rated the witness outside a pre-determined range of 3-7, 1 SD was 
excluded from the analysis.  The presentation order of the trial video clips was counter-
balanced to control for order effects; half viewed the Open Court trial first whilst the 
remaining half viewed the Screen trial first.   
Method 
Participants 
Thirty three participants were recruited to take part, predominantly from the University of 
Glasgow student body.  All participants were required to be eligible for jury duty in the United 
Kingdom at the time of participating; they must be aged over 18 and a British citizen.  The 
participants ranged in age from 18 to 45 (mean age: 22.26 years, SD=6.24 years); sixteen 
were female.  One participant had prior experience of serving on a jury for a criminal theft 
case.  The participants were paid for their time receiving either course credits or three 
pounds cash.   
Materials 
The mock trials were played on a 17 inch iMac G5 monitor placed in a quiet room.  The 
participants were seated approximately 3 feet from the screen.   
Questionnaire 
Each participant was provided with a questionnaire (Appendix 6) to be completed after 
viewing each mock trial clip.  The questionnaire asked the mock juror to rate how credible 
and believable they find the witness to be on a ten point Likert scale.  In addition they were 
asked to deliver their verdict upon the case; not guilty or guilty.  Although the trials were 
held in accordance with Scots Law, the third verdict option of not proven was not included, 
as discussed earlier.  As a manipulation check, the participants were also asked to score the 
witness on confidence.  As the confidence expressed by the witness was manipulated to 
give a midline rating and, as extremes of witness confidence have been shown to influence 
jurors decision making process (Golding et al, 2003; Wells, Ferguson and Lindsay, 1981; 
Boccaccini, 2002; Tetterton and Warren, 2005) any participant that rated witness confidence 
out with the pre-determined range (3-7, 1 SD) was excluded from the analysis.  Finally, the 
questionnaire asked participants to provide some simple demographics (age range and 
gender).   
Instructions to Participants 
Before viewing the mock trial video clips the participants were instructed to visualise 
themselves as a juror in the case they are about to hear.  The participants were further 
instructed not to make any assumptions about the reasons for the witness using a Special 
Measure during their testimony.  As this was a within subjects design, after completing the 
first questionnaire the participants were given a short, ten minute distracter task to minimise 
carry over effects, and before viewing the second clip, they received instructions to view the 
second trial video clip without comparison to the previously viewed trial clip.   
Procedure 
Participants were run individually and were exposed to both the control mock trial and the 
experimental mock trial videos; this is comparable to much of the research using the mock 
juror paradigm.  The procedure was counter-balanced to minimise carry-over effects.  
Participants were seated in a quiet room before a computer monitor.  Before beginning the 
study, the participants were instructed to imagine themselves as a juror in the case they are 
about to view.  They were told that the witness may or may not testify using a Special 
Measure.  They were also instructed that the use of a Special Measure did not mean 
anything other than the witness had met the criteria for a vulnerable witness.  No further 
information regarding the witness vulnerability was revealed to the jurors, just as it would 
not be in a live trial.  The participants were instructed to view the entire video clip before 
completing the provided questionnaire.  When the video finished the participant completed 
the questionnaire rating witness credibility, believability and confidence and delivered a 
verdict (Not Guilty/Guilty).  The participant then completed a short distraction task (10 
minutes) before proceeding to view the second mock trial under the same conditions.   
Upon completion of the second video the participant then completed a second, identical 
questionnaire.  The participants were then debriefed to the true aims of the study and 
received payment for their participation.   
Results 
Manipulation Check 
As a result of rating the witnesss confidence level out with the preset parameters (3-7 
1SD) three of the participants (one female, two males) were excluded and the data 
generated from their participation was removed from the subsequent analysis.  Thus the 
following analysis derives from thirty participants, fifteen males and fifteen females. 
Credibility Ratings 
The ratings of witness confidence in the control, open court, condition was 5.63 (SD=1.84) 
while the ratings of credibility for the witness when testifying in the use of a screen condition 
was 5.89 (SD=1.81).  Therefore the mock jurors perceived the witness who used a screen to 
shield themselves from the defendants view as more credible than the same witness who 
testified in an open court (See Graph 4).  However, further analysis using ANOVA found that 
there was no significant difference (F(1,58) = 0.24, p>0.05, d = -0.14) in mock jurors ratings 
of witness credibility between the two methods of testifying.  The ANOVA analysis was 
repeated including presentation order as a covariate to test for any carry-over effects 
associated with within subjects designs.  The resultant analysis revealed there to be no 
significant effect of presentation order (F(1,58) = 1.06, p>0.05, d = 0.32).   
Believability Ratings 
The mock jurors rated the witness in the control condition a mean believability score of 5.8 
(SD=1.92), exactly identical to the mean believability score of the witness who testified from 
behind a wooden screen (See Graph 4).  Thus, there was no effect whatsoever (F(1,58) = 
0.00, p = 1, d = 0) of using a screen to testify upon the mock jurors ratings of witness 
believability.    Further analysis of the potential carry-over effects revealed that there was no 
significant main effect of presentation order on believability ratings (F(1,58) = 2.54, p>0.05, d 
= 0.66).   
Verdict Decisions 
63.33% of the mock jurors returned a guilty verdict after viewing the control mock trial where 
the witness testified unaided.  This is comparable to the experimental, use of a Screen, 
condition where the conviction rate was 60%.  Binary logistic regression analysis revealed 
that there was no significant effect of testimony presentation method upon the rate of 
conviction (p>0.05).  The logistical regression analysis however did reveal there to be a 
significant association between the confidence scores and the likelihood of returning a guilty 
verdict (
=60.39, p<0.05,  = 0.23) giving rise to such a regression equation:  
logit(p) = -4.12 + 0.68 x Confidence Score.   
From this analysis we can say that for each 1 score increase in perceived witness 
confidence the probability of returning a guilty verdict increases by 19%.  
The regression analysis was repeated to include presentation order as a covariate to 
examine any potential carry-over effects.  The resultant data revealed that there was no 
significant effect of presentation order on the rate of guilty verdicts (
 = 2.48, p>0.05,  = 
0.11).

show the Standard Error. 
Mock Juror Gender 
Although gender effects were controlled for by ensuring that mock jurors viewed a 
vulnerable witness of their own gender, an ANOVA was performed to determine if there 
were any effects associated with mock juror gender.  The resultant analysis showed there to 
be no significant difference between the male and female mock jurors for witness credibility 
ratings (F(1,58) = 2.56, p>0.05, d = 0.67), witness believability ratings (F(1,58) = 1.19, 
p>0.05, d = 0.47), and there was no significant difference in the rate of guilty verdicts 
(F(1,58) = 2.73, p>0.05, d = 0.73).    
Discussion 
The data clearly indicates that there is no significant negative effect associated with using a 
screen to testify.  Unexpectedly there was a marginal increase in witness credibility ratings 
when testimony was delivered from behind a screen as compared to the control condition, 
however this was not significant.  The only negative effect found was a decrease in 
conviction rates in the Screen condition though this was marginal and not significant.  
Therefore it can be suggested from the data that a witness need not feel that the impact of 
their testimony will be diminished because they have chosen to testify from behind a wooden 
screen rather than in an open court with no Special Measures.   
Experiment 1(b) Open Court vs. Live CCTV Link 
Introduction  
The use of live CCTV links as a means to testify has been widely employed in British 
courtrooms over the last twenty years.  Typically it has been most commonly associated with 
child witnesses in sexual abuse cases.  There has been some previous research examining 
the effect over CCTV links upon mock jurors which has indicated a negative bias; that child 
witnesses are frequently seen as less credible when the testify via live CCTV link (Goodman 
et al, 1998).  Yet this effect may be due to jurors intrinsic reticence to fully trust child 
witnesses.  As with the full range of Special Measures there is further controversy regarding 
the implicit connotations conveyed to jurors when a witness is permitted to use a CCTV link 
and to not appear live in court (Hoyano, 2001,Tausz & Ellison, 2005).  As these divergent 
theories suggest there remains a chronic lack of data assessing the jurors perceptions of 
adult witnesses who elect to testify via a live CCTV link.   
Thus the aim of this experiment was to fully examine the relationship between jurors 
perceptions of witness credibility, believability and trial verdicts and the use of a live CCTV 
link during testimony over testifying in an open court.   
Method 
Participants 
Thirty one people were recruited to take part in experiment two.  All thirty one participants 
were undergraduate students from the University of Glasgow and ranged in age from 18 
years to 34 years (mean age: 21.10 years, SD=4.01 years); sixteen were female.  As in the 
previous experiment, all participants were required to be aged 18 or over and a British 
citizen and received payment for their time.  None of the participants had previous 
experience of serving as a juror.   
Materials 
All Materials and equipment were identical to those used in Experiment 1(a).   
Procedure 
The procedure employed was identical to that used in Experiment 1(a). 
Results 
Manipulation Check 
Of the thirty one participants who completed the experiment, one female participant was 
excluded due to rating the witness confidence outside of the set confidence rating 
parameters.  The subsequent analysis was therefore based upon thirty participants, fifteen 
males and fifteen females.   
Credibility Ratings 
The mean credibility rating for the witness when testifying in the Open Court condition was 
5.87 (SD=1.63) compared with a mean witness credibility rating of 5.00 (SD=1.43) when a 
live CCTV link was employed (See Graph 5).  Therefore, the mock jurors generally perceive 
the witness as less credible when they testified via a live CCTV link.   Further analysis 
revealed this to be a significant difference in credibility ratings (F(1,58) = 4.75, p<0.05, d = 
0.57) between the two methods of testifying.  The ANOVA was repeated to include 
presentation order as a covariate, however, the resultant analysis showed that there was no 
significant effect of presentation order (F(1,58) = 2.20, p>0.05, d = 0.44).   
Believability Ratings 
The mean believability ratings for the witness when testifying in the Open Court condition 
was 5.37 (SD=1.56) compared with a mean rating of 5.00 (SD=1.85) (See Graph 5).  Thus 
the mock jurors are rating the witness as less credible when they choose to testify via a live 
CCTV link.  Further analysis using ANOVA revealed this difference to be non significant 
(F(1,58) = 0.68, p<0.5, d = 0.22), therefore there is no significant effect of testimony method 
upon mock jurors ratings of witness believability.  There was no significant effect of 
presentation order (F(1,58) = 1.73, p>0.05, d = 0.84).   
Verdict Decisions 
56.67% of the mock jurors returned a guilty verdict in the Open Court condition compared 
with 53.33% in the CCTV link condition.  Further analysis was undertaken in the form of 
binary logistic regression as the data were categorical.  Results indicated that there was no 
significant effect of testimony presentation method upon the rate of guilty verdicts (
= 3.2, 
p>0.05,  = 0.03).  The regression analysis was repeated with presentation order included 
as a predictor, however, the resultant data shown there to be no significant effect (F(1,58) = 
3.04, p>0.05, d = 0.52) of presentation order upon the rate of guilty verdicts.

show the Standard Error. 
Mock Juror Gender 
A one way ANOVA was performed to establish it there was any main effect of mock juror 
gender upon any of the dependent measures (witness credibility, witness believability and 
verdict decision).  The ensuing data showed that there was no effect of mock juror gender 
upon ratings of witness credibility (F(1,58) = 2.39, p>0.05, d = 0.44), witness believability 
(F(1.58) = 3.12, p>0.05, d = 0.61) neither was there any significant effect upon the rate of 
guilty verdicts (F(1,58) = 0.07, p>0.05, d = 0.5).   
Discussion 
The results suggest that although there is a significant effect of testimony presentation 
method upon mock jurors perceptions of witness credibility the effects do not extend to 
ratings of believability or to the rate of conviction.  Specifically when the witness chose to 
testify via a live CCTV link the mock jurors rated them as significantly less credible than the 
witness who testified in an open court.  This effect was anticipated as similar effects have 
been recorded for child witnesses (Goodman et al 1998; Swim et al, 1993; Davies & Noon, 
1991, Landstrom et al., 2005; 2007; 2008) however it was expected that the believability 
ratings and conviction rates would be affected in line with the ratings of credibility.  The data 
does show some evidence of an associated decline in believability ratings and conviction 
rates but the differences were not significant.  The significant decline in credibility ratings 
may be an effect of the witness becoming removed from the courtroom.  It has been widely 
suggested (Swim et al, 1993; Davies & Noon, 1991; Landry & Brigham, 1992; Landstrom et 
al, 2005; 2007; Hamlyn et al, 2006; Nisbett & Ross, 1980) that testimony has a more 
significant impact upon jurors when the witness appears before them in court and thus 
testifying via CCTV diminishes the immediacy of the evidence.  It is postulated that this 
effect occurs because the jurors cannot fully observe the body language and emotionality of 
the witness via a television screen (Davies & Noon, 1991; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Swim et al, 
1993), information jurors rely heavily upon when forming their opinions of the witness and 
deciding upon a verdict (Goodman et al, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002; OBarr, 1974).  However 
witnesses may be reassured that there appears to be no significant disadvantage associated 
with choosing to testify via a live CCTV link.   
Experiment 1(c) Open Court vs. Pre-recorded Video Evidence 
Introduction 
The use of pre-recorded video evidence is certainly one of the lesser known Special 
Measures.  Currently this Special Measure has not been widely implemented; there has 
been just one incident of use in Scotland since being passed into law in 2004; yet it is a 
measure reserved for those witnesses who often have the most potentially damaging 
testimony but who have a significant history of intimidation in relation to their testifying.  
Although there are some concerns from judges regarding its use it appears that the primary 
obstacle to wider implementation may be its requirement for early action (Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008).  Pre-recorded video evidence necessitates preparation and organisation of 
prosecution and defence for cross-examination at an early stage when it is not yet certain 
the case will make it to trial.  Due to the relatively new inception of this Special Measure, and 
its small uptake, it is not surprising that there has been no research examining the effect of 
pre-recorded video evidence upon jurors perceptions of the vulnerable adult witnesses who 
use them.  It is because it is reserved for the most severely intimidated vulnerable witnesses 
that Pre-recorded Video Evidence was included in the current trial.  There are concerns 
about the effects it may exert upon jurors perceptions, leading them to be more sympathetic 
to the vulnerable witness; which may be a contributory cause to its minimal usage since the 
implementation of the Special Measures (Tausz & Elliston, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 
2000).  Experiment 1(c) aimed to examine this Special Measure in an effort to resolve these 
issues and determine if the use of Pre-recorded Video Evidence does influence jurors 
perceptions of witnesses and influences the trial outcome.   
Method 
Participants 
Thirty five participants were recruited from the student body at the University of Glasgow.  
The age range of the participants varied from 18 years to 51 years (mean age: 28.49 years, 
SD=10.64 years); eighteen were female.  As with the previous two experiments all 
participants were required to be aged 18 or over and be a British citizen in order to 
participate and none of them had ever served on a jury previously.  All participants were paid 
either 3 or course credits for their time.   
Materials 
All Materials and equipment were identical to those used in the previous two experiments.   
Procedure 
The procedure employed was identical to that used in the previous two experiments.   
Results 
Manipulation Check 
All participants rated the witnesss confidence in the two clips within the range of acceptable 
scores.  However, one female participant later withdrew from the experiment and therefore 
her data was excluded from the analysis below.  Data analysis is based upon thirty four 
participants, seventeen males and seventeen females.  Table 4 provides an overview of all 
the data.   
Credibility Ratings 
The mean credibility ratings when the witness testified unaided in the open court was 6.47 
(SD=1.39) compared with a mean credibility rating of 4.35 (SD=1.68) in the Pre-recorded 
Video Evidence condition.  Thus the mock jurors generally perceive the witness as less 
credible when they deliver their testimony in the form of a pre-recorded video statement 
(See Graph 6).  Further analysis revealed this difference in credibility ratings to be highly 
significant (F(1,66) = 31.80, p<0.001, d = 1.37) thus there is a significant effect of testimony 
delivery method upon mock jurors ratings of witness credibility.  The ANOVA was repeated, 
including presentation order as a covariate to examine any carryover effects from the 
repeated measures design.  The resultant data showed some evidence of a significant effect 
of presentation order upon credibility ratings of the witness (F(1,66) = 33.67, p<0.05, d = 
0.44).   
Believability Ratings 
The mean believability rating of the witness when testifying in the control condition was 6.70 
(SD=1.34) compared with a mean believability rating of 5.24 (SD=1.46) when the witness 
testified via Pre-recorded Video Evidence (see Graph 6).  Further analysis from a one way 
ANOVA clearly shows that this was a highly significant difference (F(1,66) = 18.78, p<0.001, 
d = 1.04) thus there is a significant effect of testimony delivery method on mock jurors 
ratings of witness believability.  The analysis was repeated to include presentation order as 
a covariate and the ensuing data showed there to be no significant effect of presentation 
order upon believability ratings of the witness (F(1, 66) = 2.18, p>0.05, d = 0.70).   
Graph 6: Mean Ratings of Witness by Testimony Presentation Method.  Error Bars 
show the Standard Error. 
Verdict Decisions 
82.35% of mock jurors returned a guilty verdict after viewing the witness testify in an Open 
Court with no special measures.  However, this rate of convictions fell dramatically to 
20.59% when mock jurors viewed the experimental, Pre-recorded Video Evidence, condition 
(see Graph 7).  As the data were categorical, further analysis in the form of logistic 
regression was undertaken.  Results from this analysis revealed there to be a highly 
significant association between the testimony presentation method and the rate of guilty 
verdicts (
 = 61.1, p<0.001,  = 0.87); that those jurors who viewed the Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence condition were significantly less likely to return a guilty verdict compared to the 
jurors who viewed the Open Court condition.    The regression analysis was repeated to 
investigate any carryover effects and so presentation order was included as an additional 
predictor.  The data from this analysis demonstrated that there was a significant effect of 
presentation order upon the rate of guilty verdicts (
 = 14.47, p<0.05,  = 0.16).   
Graph 7: Percentage Guilty Verdicts by Testimony Presentation Method. 
Mock Juror Gender 
A one way ANOVA was performed to examine if there were any differences attributable to 
the gender of the mock jurors.  The resultant analysis demonstrated that there was no 
significant differences between male and female mock jurors ratings of witness credibility 
(F(1,66) = 1.70, p>0.05, d = 0.81), witness believability (F(1,66) = 0.38, p>0.05, d = 0.56) nor 
in the rate of guilty verdicts (F(1,66) = 0.58, p>0.05, d = 0.41).   
Discussion 
The results from experiment 1(c) are strongly indicative of a serious negative bias 
associated with choosing to testify via pre-recorded video evidence.  Not only does this 
Special Measure significantly reduce perceived witness credibility and believability in the 
eyes of the mock jurors the rates of convictions is drastically cut.  The high conviction rate of 
82.35% in the control condition was dramatically cut to just 20.59% of the mock jurors 
convicted in the pre-recorded video evidence condition.  This holds significant 
consequences for the judicial community as a witness who chooses to testify in this manner 
are often those most at risk of intimidation and frequently have the most damaging testimony 
(Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003).  However, if such a 
vulnerable, intimidated witness chooses to testify via pre-recorded evidence they should be 
advised that this Special Measure may diminish the impact of their testimony in the eyes of 
the jurors.   
There is a confounding factor in this analysis though in that there was evidence of significant 
order effects upon the mean ratings of witness confidence and rate of guilty verdicts.  This 
somewhat limits the generalisability of the findings but the size of these presentation order 
effects were small in both instances (0.44 and 0.16) and so further research is required to 
clarify this issue.   
Experiment Two: Effects of Deliberation 
Introduction 
The study of jury decision making and deliberation is, by its private nature, very difficult to 
achieve (Bornstein, 1999; Hastie, Penrod & Pennington, 1983; Tinsley, 2001; Davis, Kerr, 
Stasser, Meek & Holt, 1977; McCoy, Nunez & Dammeyer, 1999).  It is impossible to gain 
access to actual jury deliberations in order to test hypotheses and theories without 
compromising the objective of the process.  However, there are real concerns within the 
scientific community (Bornstein, 1999) that the extensive research focused upon jury 
manipulations, deliberations and decision making process lacks external validity as a result 
of this inability to observe and assess real deliberating jury groups.   
While the results from the first series of experiments were indicative of a trend there is 
clearly an issue regarding the external validity of the data as it was generated from mock 
jurors individual perceptions and decisions.  Thus in order to improve the validity of the 
results a second study was designed to assess both the effect the process of deliberation 
has on individual jurors perceptions of a witness and whether the earlier observed effect of 
Special Measures occurs in a group of jurors.  It was hypothesised that the introduction of 
the deliberation stage would have a moderating effect upon mock jurors perceptions of the 
witness and the rate of convictions.  Furthermore it was hypothesised, as with the earlier 
experiments, that the mean ratings of witness credibility and believability and rates of 
conviction would be poorer the further removed the witness is from the jury group.    
Method  
Participants 
52 new participants were recruited from the student population of the University of Glasgow.  
The mean age was 25.46 years (SD= 4.37 years, range: 18-34 years) and 33 participants 
were female.  The participants were randomly allocated to serve on one 13 person jury, 
each jury would view one of the previous four mock trial videos; open court, use of a screen, 
live CCTV link or pre-recorded video evidence.  None of the participants had served on a 
jury previously.  All participants were paid for their time receiving either course credit or 6.   
Stimuli 
The mock trial videos were the trial videos as used in the previous experiments.  There were 
no alterations made to the stimuli.  As it would have been impractical to control for gender 
effects thus the mock trial videos used all depicted a female witness testifying.   
Materials 
The participants viewed the mock trial videos on a 25 inch television screen in a large room.  
Seating was laid out in the fashion of the jury box; two rows of seating, one behind the other, 
facing the television approximately ten feet across the room.  A second seating area was 
located in a neighbouring room which would serve as the deliberation room.   
Questionnaire 
All participants were given two identical questionnaires.  The first asked each participant to 
rated their initial perceptions of witness credibility, believability and confidence and to deliver 
a verdict.  Following completion and collection of this questionnaire the 13 member jury 
moved into the deliberation room.  The second questionnaire was identical to the first and 
again asked participants to rate their perceptions of the witness after their group 
deliberations.   
Procedure 
The participants were randomly assigned to either the control, open court condition or one of 
the three experimental conditions; use of a screen, live CCTV link or pre-recorded video 
evidence.  Each group of 13 participants were seated in the courtroom to view the mock 
trial video which was displayed on a 25 inch high definition television positioned ten feet 
from the front row of the juror seating.  They were given instructions regarding the 
completion of their questionnaires and the format of the experiment.  Each participant then 
read the scenario setting as described in experiment 1 before settling to view the video.  
Immediately after the trial video ended the participants completed the first questionnaire, no 
communication with the other participants was permitted.  When all 13 participants had 
completed the questionnaire, the paper was placed into an envelope, sealed and collected 
by the experimenter.  The participants then moved into the deliberation room where they 
received instructions (Appendix 8) regarding nomination of a foreperson and guidelines for 
verdict decisions.  The experimenter was not present in the room during deliberations, 
however audio recording was carried out and the experimenter was seated just outside.  It 
was explicitly stated that the group must deliberate and try to come to a unanimous verdict 
however, as the participants had volunteered for a 60 minute experiment, if the jury group 
struggled to reach a unanimous verdict the experimenter stepped in after 40 minutes to 
instruct that a 10-3 majority would be acceptable.  When the jury had reached their verdict 
the foreperson notified the experimenter who returned to the deliberating room.  No further 
conversation was permitted between participants whilst they completed the second 
questionnaire.  The second questionnaire was identical to the first and asked the participants 
to report their personal feelings about the witness and verdict after deliberation.  Upon 
completion of the second questionnaire the participants were debriefed and received 
payment for their time.   
Results  
The results are divided into two major effects: firstly the effect of the deliberation stage on 
witness ratings of witness credibility and believability and rate of guilty verdicts.  This first 
data set was analysed using a 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA to fully examine all the 
main effects and higher order effects upon witness credibility ratings and believability 
ratings.  The data regarding the rate of guilty verdicts was analysed using multi-level logistic 
regression as the dependent variable was categorical.  The second stage results examines 
the differences in witness ratings and guilty verdicts, after deliberation, between the control, 
open court condition and each of the three experimental conditions; use of a Screen, live 
CCTV link and pre-recorded video evidence. This data was analysed using hierarchical log-
linear regression to test for all associations between the variables.    
Effects of Deliberation 
Credibility Ratings 
The mean credibility ratings of the witness in the control condition before deliberations was 
3.54 (SD=1.51) compared with a mean rating of 3.31 (SD=1.44) after deliberation.  When 
the witness testified from behind a screen the mean credibility rating before deliberation was 
4.69 (SD=1.55) compared with a mean rating of 4.00 (SD=1.29) after deliberation.  The 
mean credibility rating before deliberation when the witness testified via CCTV link was 4.62 
(SD=1.66) compared with 3.92 (SD=1.55) after deliberation.  When testimony was delivered 
in the form of pre-recorded statements the witness mean credibility ratings were 5.62 
(SD=1.39) before deliberations compared with 5.00 (SD=1.16) after deliberations (see graph 
A 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA (Deliberation [before & after] x testimony method [open, 
Screen, CCTV & pre-recorded video evidence]) was performed and revealed that there was 
no significant interaction term (F(3,96)=0.15, p>0.05, d = 0.43).  There was no significant 
effect of deliberation (F(1,96)=3.85, p>0.05, d = 0.37) although this result was close to the 
level of significance (p=0.053).  There was a highly significant effect of testimony 
presentation method (F(3,96)=7.35, p<0.001, d = 0.59).  Planned comparisons were 
performed to determine which of the three experimental conditions difference significantly 
from the control (open court) condition.  Post-hoc pair-wise comparisons revealed that the 
mean credibility score from the pre-recorded video evidence condition (M=1.88, 95% CI 
[0.80, 2.97], p<0.001, d = 0.38) was significantly different from the control condition.  Neither 
the Screen (M=0.92, 95% CI [-0.16, 2.01]. p>0.05, 0.41) condition or the CCTV link condition 
(M=0.85, 95% CI [-0.24, 1.93], p>0.05, d = 0.17) differed significantly from the control, open 
court, condition.   
Believability Ratings 
The mean believability ratings for the witness in the control condition was 4.08 (SD=1.89) 
before deliberation compared with a mean rating of 3.69 (SD=1.70) after deliberation.  Mean 
ratings before deliberation for the Screen condition was 5.15 (SD=2.19) compared with a 
mean rating of 4.15 (SD=1.68).  The mean believability ratings before deliberation in the 
CCTV condition was 4.39 (SD=1.85) compared with an after deliberation mean rating of 4.46 
(SD=1.98).  Finally in the pre-recorded video evidence condition the mean believability rating 
before deliberation was 4.54 (SD=1.61) compared with a mean rating of 4.23 (SD=1.09; see 
graph 8).   
A two way analysis of variance was performed to determine if there was any interaction or 
significant main effects of deliberation or testimony presentation method.  The interaction 
term was reported as non significant (F(3,96)=0.41, p>0.05, d = 0.24) as was each of the 
main effects of deliberation (F(1,96)=1.34, p>0.05, d = 0.31) and testimony presentation 
method (F(3,96)=0.86, p>0.05, d = 0.19).  Thus we can conclude that there is no significant 
effect of deliberation upon mean believability scores and that there is no significant 
difference in mean believability ratings between the control condition and the three 
experimental conditions.

Deliberation.  Error bars show Standard Error. 
Verdict Decisions 
The rate of guilty verdicts from the Open Court condition was 15.4% before deliberations 
occurred compared with 14.8% after deliberations.  The Screen condition yielded a 
conviction rate of 15.38% before deliberations which was precisely identical to the conviction 
rate after deliberations.  36.2% of the mock jurors who viewed the CCTV condition returned 
a guilty verdict before deliberations which decreased to 24.8% after deliberations.  Finally 
28.5% of the mock jurors returned a guilty verdict before deliberations in the Pre-recorded 
Video Evidence condition which decreased to 15.4% of mock jurors after deliberations (see 
graph 9).   
Multi level logistic regression analysis was performed and revealed no significant interaction 
 = 0.37, p>0.05,  = 0.56) and no significant main effect of either deliberations (
 = 1.98, 
p>0.05,  = 0.39) or testimony presentation method (
1.20, p>0.05,  = 0.41).  Therefore 
while there is no evidence to suggest that there is a significant effect of deliberations upon 
mock jurors verdict decisions upon the trial.  Equally, there appears to be no significant 
effect of testimony presentation method upon the rate of guilty verdicts.   
Graph 9: Percentage Guilty Verdicts Before & After Deliberation by Testimony 
Presentation Method.  Error bars show the Standard Error. 
Mock Juror Gender 
Gender was not controlled for in Experiment 2 as the jury groups were comprised of both 
male and female mock jurors who viewed a female vulnerable witness.  In order to examine 
if there were gender effects in the ratings of the witness and rate of guilty verdicts, a one 
way ANOVA was performed on the before deliberation data.  The resultant analysis revealed 
that there was no significant main effect of mock juror gender upon witness credibility 
(F(3,96) = 0.003, p>0.05, d = 0.41), witness believability (F(3,96) = 2.37, p>0.05, d = 0.49) or 
rate of guilty verdicts (F(3,96) = 1.59, p>0.05, d = 0.6) before deliberations took place.   
A second one way ANOVA was performed using the after deliberations data, however, there 
was still no significant evidence of an effect of mock juror gender on witness credibility 
ratings (F(3, 96) = 0.96, p>0.05, d = 0.22), witness believability (F(3,96) = 0.68, p>0.05, d = 
0.57) or rate of guilty verdicts (F(1,96) = 2.25, p>0.05, d = 0.64).   
Discussion 
The data clearly indicates that the deliberation stage has only a weak regulatory effect upon 
mock jurors perceptions and conviction rates.  While the results do suggest that jurors 
individual perceptions can be altered by the group dynamic, even when those initial 
perceptions may be relatively strong, in the current experiment there was no significant 
effect of deliberation upon mock jurors ratings of the witness or conviction rate.  However, 
there is evidence that the testimony presentation method exerts a strongly significant effect 
upon mock jurors credibility ratings of the witness; when they elect to testify via pre-
recorded video evidence the mock jurors perceive them as significantly more credible as 
compared to the control condition.   
Special Measures  After Deliberation Comparisons to Control Condition 
The second stage of results examines the difference in witness ratings and conviction rates 
between the control condition, testifying in an open court, and each of the experimental 
conditions to determine if the results suggest an implicit disadvantage associated with any of 
the testimony presentation methods.  Therefore the subsequent analyses are based solely 
upon the mock jurors after deliberation ratings of the witness and verdict decisions, an 
overview of which may be seen in Table 4.

Deliberation Data 
The length of time it took each jury group to reach a verdict from entering the deliberation 
room was recorded.  Each groups deliberations was recorded via audiotape and played 
back later.   
The Open Court jury group (9 females, 4 males) took 37 minutes to reach a majority verdict, 
11-2 not guilty.  The recording of the deliberations revealed that immediately after general 
introductions (5 minutes), a poll was taken to observe the current feelings within the group.  
This poll showed that 5 of the 13 jurors felt that the defendant was guilty whilst the remaining 
8 were persuaded that the defendant was not guilty.  After the poll, the group then engaged 
in discussion about the facts of the case and the behaviour of the witness they had heard 
from.  A large part of this discussion (29 minutes) involved the majority group questioning 
the minority about their views and attempting to coerce them to change their opinions.  
During this discussion, one of the minority jurors suggested that they felt the Not Proven 
verdict option would be more appropriate as they felt that the defendant was guilty but that 
there was a lack of evidence.  However, as the jurors had been instructed that not proven 
was not a permitted verdict option, this juror felt strongly resistant to delivering a not guilty 
verdict.  At this point the experimenter entered the deliberation room and announced that a 
majority verdict of 10-3 would be sufficient to conclude the trial.  A second poll was 
suggested by the foreperson and taken at 37 minutes, which revealed an 11-2 split.  The 
foreperson notified the experimenter who then re-entered the deliberation room and 
administered the second individual questionnaire.   
The Screen jury group (8 females, 5 males) took 23 minutes to reach a unanimous verdict; 
not guilty.  Again, the jury foreperson organised an immediate poll of the groups verdict 
opinions which revealed a 12-1 split in favour of not guilty.  The foreperson then proceeded 
to ask the single juror to explain why they felt the defendant was guilty.  The juror spent 14 
minutes explaining their opinions; that the witness was using a screen so was obviously 
scared of the defendant and that the witness was emotional when challenged by the defence 
lawyer.  The majority of the jury group then challenged these assertions and suggested that 
there was not enough conclusive evidence to determine the defendants guilt.  The 
foreperson then called for a second poll, which was unanimously in favour of a not guilty 
verdict.  The experimenter was informed and the second questionnaire administered.   
The jury group (5 females, 8 males) who viewed the witness testimony via CCTV link 
required 44 minutes to return a majority verdict of10-3 in favour of a not guilty verdict.  This 
group was also different to all others in that the foreperson began the deliberations by asking 
each juror to offer their thoughts on the evidence and their perceptions of the witness.  This 
initial discussion took 20 minutes, after which the foreperson organised a vote to assess the 
feelings of the group.  The vote reflected a 9-4 split in favour of a not guilty verdict.  At this 
point the majority of the group began to question and challenge the views of the minority, 
particularly focussing on the minoritys assumption that the defendant must be guilty 
because the witness was too frightened to even enter the courtroom to testify.  The 
foreperson was especially strident in challenging this assumption, repeatedly stating that 
there may be other reasons for the witness to testify via live CCTV link.  After 38 minutes of 
deliberation, a second poll was taken and showed that there had been no change in the 
split; 4 jurors still voted for a guilty verdict.  At this point, the experimenter entered the room 
and told the jurors that a majority verdict of 10-3 would be sufficient to end deliberations.  
Further discussions were undertaken between the majority and minority groups with much 
issue being made of the criteria for which a live CCTV link may be employed by a witness.  
Three jurors of the minority group still appeared to be resistant to returning a not guilty 
verdict as they believed the defendant to be culpable.  After 43 minutes of deliberations, one 
of the four minority jurors indicated that they were willing to return a not guilty verdict and the 
foreperson took a final poll of each jurors verdict.  Deliberations ended with a 10-3 majority 
in favour of a not guilty verdict before the second questionnaire was administered by the 
experimenter.   
The jury group (5 females, 8 males) who had viewed the Pre-recorded Video Evidence 
condition took 48 minutes to deliver a majority verdict of 11-2 in favour of a not guilty verdict.  
The foreperson began the deliberations with an immediate poll of the jurors to establish the 
split before engaging in any deliberation of the evidence or witness testimony.  The result of 
this poll was split with 11 jurors favouring a not guilty verdict.  The 2 jurors in favour of the 
guilty verdict were very resistant to agreeing a not guilty verdict.  It became apparent 
throughout the following discussion that these 2 jurors felt that the fact that the witness had 
pre-recorded their testimony to avoid attending court and coming into chance contact with 
the defendant was highly suspicious and concluded that there must be some cause for this 
choice.  One of these two jurors even suggested that the witness being permitted to use 
such a Special Measure suggested that the judge felt that the defendant was guilty and that 
the witness required protection from the defendant.  The jurors in the majority group 
attempted to challenge these views; again, one juror stated that there could be many 
reasons why the witness had elected to testify via pre-recorded evidence whilst other jurors 
discussed the behaviour of the witness and the emotions they exhibited.  Five jurors in the 
majority group were particularly concerned with the lack of emotion displayed by the witness 
when recounting the event and felt that their description of the injuries sustained was too 
matter-of-fact and impersonal.  This period of discussion was briefly interrupted when the 
experimenter entered to specify the majority need to secure a verdict.  The foreperson then 
asked the 2 minority jurors if they now felt differently and were able to give a not guilty 
verdict.  When they declared themselves unable to, a final poll was taken and a majority not 
guilty verdict was carried with 11 jurors in favour.  The experimenter was informed and the 
second questionnaire administered.   
Credibility Ratings 
Mean credibility ratings were 3.31 (SD=1.44) for the control condition compared with 4.00 
(SD=1.29) for use of a Screen; 3.92 (SD=1.55) for CCTV link and 5.00 (SD=1.16) for pre-
recorded video evidence (see graph 10).   
Believability Ratings 
The mean believability ratings for the witness when testifying in an open court was 3.69 
(SD=1.70) compared with a mean rating of 4.15 (SD=1.68) when testifying from behind a 
screen, 4.46 (SD=1.98) via CCTV link and 5.00 (SD=1.09) when testifying via pre-recorded 
video evidence (see graph 10).   
Verdict Decisions 
14.8% of mock jurors returned a guilty verdict in the Open Court condition compared with a 
conviction rate of 15.38% when the witness testified from behind a Screen, 24.8% when 
using a CCTV link and 15.4% when testimony was delivered via Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence (see graph 11).

Further analysis was conducted by means of hierarchical log-linear analysis.  A saturated 
model was constructed in which each participants after deliberation responses were entered 
as variables (Credibility, Believability, Confidence and Verdict) along with the experimental 
condition they were allocated to ( Open, Screen, CCTV, PVE), the length of the deliberations 
and the type of verdict decision (Unanimous or Majority).  Components of this model were 
then removed using backward elimination; probability for removal was p<0.05.  The resultant 
analysis revealed there to be no significant effects associated with any of the variables.  
There was no evidence of a main effect of condition (
 = 1.27, p>0.05,  = 0.32), credibility 
ratings (
 = 0.34, p>0.05,  = 0.15), believability ratings (
 = 1.17, p>0.05,  = 0.08), 
verdict decision (
 = 0.99, p>0.05,  = 0.25), age, (
 = 0.63, p>0.05,  = 0.12), gender (
= 1.49, p>0.05,  = 0.2), deliberation length (
 = 2.04, p>0.05,  = 0.37) or verdict type (
= 0.70, p>0.05,  = 0.09).   
Thus, it appears that the use of Special Measures by adult vulenrable witnesses is not 
associated with any significant effects upon mock jurors perceptions or verdict decisions.   
Discussion 
The data revealed an opposite trend from that observed from the first series of experiments 
(1a-1c).  The mock jurors did tend to rate the witness in the use of a screen, live CCTV link 
and pre-recorded video evidence conditions as more credible than the witness who testified 
in an Open Court, however not significantly so.  Furthermore the witness in each of the 
experimental conditions was rated as more believable than the witness who testified in the 
Open Court condition although again, the differences were not found to be significant.  
Finally, although the officially returned verdicts were all not guilty, the rates of guilty verdicts, 
on an individual juror basis, were all greater in the experimental conditions than in the Open 
Court condition but none differed significantly.  Thus, when mock jurors participate in a 
deliberation stage it appears that there are no significant effects, certainly no disadvantage, 
to the impact of a vulnerable or intimidated witnesss testimony.  It was interesting to note 
that 15.38% of the mock jurors in the Screen condition reported a guilty verdict decision in 
their individual second questionnaire even though they agreed a unanimous not guilty 
verdict in deliberation.  This suggests that 2 mock jurors had not been convinced by the 
discussions with their fellow jurors and they appeared to have publicly complied with the 
majority verdict decision whilst retaining their doubts about the culpability of the defendant.  
It was also noted that at least one of the jurors in the Open Court condition was aware of the 
not proven verdict option as permitted under Scots Law.  As discussed earlier, this third 
verdict option was not included in the experimental design as research has suggested that 
juror understanding of this verdict option is very poor and that it is frequently used as a 
compromise in split jury groups (Hope, Green, Memon, Gavisk & Houston, 2007).   Further 
research in this area though should include a study which allows jurors this third verdict 
option as research employing this procedure is limited (Hope et al., 2007) whilst applied use 
of the not proven verdict is increasing every year in Scottish trials (Scottish Executive, 2006). 
Despite this increasing use though, the Not Proven verdict option remains politically 
contentious and there is growing public dissatisfaction with its use 
(http://www.siliconglen.com/Scotland/1_8.html; Bray, 2005; Duff, 1999; Davies, 1996; 
Barbato, 2005; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6500541.stm).   Finally, the qualitative 
data from the audio recordings of the deliberation sessions appear to provide some 
suggestive evidence that mock jurors implicitly associate the use of a Special Measure as an 
indicator of defendant guilt.  This was evidenced in all experimental conditions (Screen, 
CCTV and PVE) to varying degrees during the deliberations.  This is of concern to the 
judicial community and further research must be undertaken to validate these conclusions.   
If corroborated, changes must be implemented in the judicial system, particularly in regards 
to the improving the jurors understanding of the criteria used to determine witness 
vulnerability.   
General Discussion 
The data from this series of experiments has yielded some interesting trends.  When the 
mock jurors viewed the testimony and gave a verdict individually there was suggestive 
evidence that the witness was rated as less credible and believable in proportion to their 
increasing isolation from the courtroom and jurors.  Equally, there was a similar declining 
trend in the rate of guilty verdicts, indicating that the diminishing credibility of the witness 
lead the jurors to find the defendant not guilty.  Yet when the study was extended to 
incorporate deliberating jury groups this trend was reversed, with the mock jurors rating 
witness credibility and believability consistently greater as they became increasingly 
removed from the live trial proceedings.  This was accompanied by an increasing trend in 
conviction rates; increasing from the control condition across the Screen and CCTV link 
conditions before falling when pre-recorded video evidence was used.    However, the rate 
of guilty verdicts in all three of the experimental conditions (Screen, CCTV and PVE) never 
differed significantly from the rate observed in the Open Court condition.   
The initial run of experiments provided some strong evidence regarding the effects of using 
a Special Measure to testify upon mock jurors perceptions of vulnerable and/or intimidated 
witnesses and their perception of defendant guilt.  There is some division in the literature as 
to whether the use of Special Measures in court diminishes the impact of witness testimony 
upon jurors and thus may alter the trial outcome (Goodman et al, 1998; Orcutt et al, 2001; 
Swim et al, 1993; Davies & Noon, 1991).  In addition, there are vociferous concerns from 
defence lawyers and judges that the use of Special Measures implicitly suggests defendant 
guilt to jurors before they heard testimony (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Tausz & 
Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000; Hamlyn et al, 2006).  The results from 
Experiments 1a-1c confirm the purported trend of decreasing testimony impact with 
increasing isolation of the witness from the jurors (Davies & Noon, 1991; Nisbett & Ross, 
1980;  Swim et al, 1993).   
The ratings of witness credibility and believability were not significantly different in the 
Screen and CCTV conditions from the control, Open Court, condition.  However there was a 
decreasing trend with witnesses using a CCTV link to testify rated lower than those who 
employed a screen who, in turn, were rated as less credible and believable than the witness 
who testified in a open court.  The only significant difference in witness credibility and 
believability ratings between the Open Court condition and a Special Measures condition 
occurred when mock jurors viewed the Pre-recorded Video Evidence Special Measure.  
Under these conditions the witness was rated significantly less credible and believable than 
the witness who testified without Special Measures in an open court.  Thus this finding 
continued the existing trend of perceived witness credibility and believability decreasing in 
line with declining witness contact with the jurors.  In addition, further evidence of this 
diminishing trend is provided by the rate of guilty verdicts which exhibited a decreasing as 
the testimony presentation method became increasingly isolated.  It should be noted that 
that there was no significant difference in conviction rates between the control condition and 
the Screen and CCTV condition however there is a decreasing trend culminating in a highly 
significant difference in conviction rates between the control condition and pre-recorded 
video evidence.   
Therefore it can be concluded that witnesses who testify using Special Measures which 
remove them from the mock jurors appears to diminish the immediacy and impact of the 
testimony upon mock jurors when they work individually.  Specifically, the mock jurors rate 
the witness as increasingly less credible and believable the more removed from proceedings 
the Special Measures takes the witness; thus the mock jurors rated the witness in the control 
condition as most credible followed by use of a Screen, live CCTV link and finally Pre-
recorded Video Evidence which is further associated with a dramatic cut in conviction rates.  
This finding corroborates data from other studies which have claimed a similar effect (Swim 
et al, 1993, Davies & Noon, 1991) and is clearly indicative of an implicit negative bias the 
Special Measures conveys to jurors.  The findings from this series of studies may be 
interpreted as corroborating evidence for Nisbett & Rosss 1980 vividness effect.  They 
claimed that jurors react most positively to testimony that is vivid, characterised by being 
emotionally interesting, thought provoking and, of most relevance here, proximity.  Live 
testimony, delivered within the courtroom and face-to-face with jurors is more likely to be 
viewed as memorable and vivid and thus the more likely the witness is perceived to be 
credible and accurate.    
Such a theory may go some way to accounting for the data trends observed in Experiment 
2.  It accounts for why there is no significant difference in witness ratings and conviction 
rates between the Open Court condition and the Screen condition; although the Screen 
shields the witness from the defendants view, the jury, seated directly opposite the witness, 
remain able to clearly view the witness and their interactions with solicitors.  The vividness of 
their testimony is not impeded by the screen and so their perceptions of the witness, while 
marginally diminished, are not significantly different to those awarded to the witness in the 
Open Court.  Equally, the use of live CCTV links is associated with a non-significant 
decrease in perceived witness credibility, believability and a decrease in the likelihood of 
conviction.  These results again may be rationalised in terms of the testimony vividness.  
Although the testimony is delivered live, the jurors no longer have a face-to-face, proximal, 
interaction with the witness and they have a limited view of their behaviour.  However, the 
witness testimony may still be perceived as vivid as they respond to questioning, 
particularly if they exhibit an emotional response (Golding et al. 2003; Goodman et al., 1998; 
Orcutt et al., 2001; Regan & Baker, 1998).   
It is when the witness elects to testify via Pre-recorded Video Evidence that the vividness 
effect appears to be of most use in explaining the current data.  Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence was associated with a decrease in both witness credibility ratings and believability 
ratings, more so than either of the other experimental conditions, and the mean ratings 
observed in the Open Court condition, however, this was not a significant difference.  Again, 
the proximity of the witness to the jurors is further removed; the witness is not present and 
the testimony is no longer delivered live.  Furthermore, the emotional impact of their 
testimony is diminished because they are simply reading their prepared statement and 
answering a few, unchallenging questions (Wheatcroft et al., 2004).  This further diminishes 
the vividness of their testimony in the eyes of the juror.  Finally, to compound upon these 
factors, the jurors also have a limited view of the witness behaviour which may impair their 
ability to assess honesty and credibility.   All of these factors may account for the dramatic 
decrease in the rate of guilty verdicts when Pre-recorded Video Evidence is used as a 
Special Measure.   
For the 22.5% of vulnerable witnesses (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008) who elect to 
testify from behind a wooden screen the data does not suggest any significant advantage to 
be gained from testifying from an open court; they may be perceived as less credible and 
believable by jurors but this does not appear to influence the verdict.  Equally the 42.2% of 
vulnerable witnesses who choose to employ a live CCTV link should certainly be informed 
that the jury are likely to view them as less credible if they pursue this method however, they 
should also be told that this bias is not likely to negatively impact upon the trial.  Finally, 
while pre-recorded video evidence in not yet widely employed in Scotland it is often reserved 
for vulnerable witnesses who have potentially the most damaging evidence (Vital Voices: 
Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence, 2003) thus it is of great concern that jurors 
appear to be rating such witnesses as significantly less credible and believable.  However it 
is the highly negative effect that the use of pre-recorded video evidence exerts upon jurors 
likelihood to convict which is most worrying.  If choosing to testify via pre-recorded video 
evidence conviction rates fall to 20.59% from a high of 82.35% when testimony is delivered 
in an open court.  Certainly there should be a responsibility to advise potential users of this 
Special Measure that there is a strong likelihood that their testimony will have only a weak 
impact upon jurors and the likelihood of a conviction is relatively poor.   
From a defendants point of view the results are advantageous; there is certainly no 
suggestion of an automatic implicit negative bias perceived by the jurors when viewing the 
witnesses who testified via one of the three Special Measures.  Although several groups 
working with the judicial system retain concerns that the use of Special Measures indicate 
presumed defendant guilt rather than innocence (Tausz & Ellison, 2005, Hoyano, 2001, 
Birch, 2000) there is certainly no evidence from the first experimental series.  Indeed the 
data suggests the opposite to be true; the conviction rates decline progressively as the 
witness elects to testify further from the live trial proceedings.   
Although the first experimental series certainly provides some suggestive data in this under-
researched area there are certainly some limitations which need to be addressed.  If we 
examine the data from the three experiments there is an obvious anomaly arising with the 
ratings of the witness and conviction rates in Experiment 1(c) when jurors viewed the Open 
Court condition.  The ratings of witness credibility and believability given in the Open Court 
condition in Experiment 1(c) were greater than the ratings awarded to the control witness in 
Experiments 1(a) and 1(b).  Equally, the conviction rates in the Open Court condition in 
Experiments 1(a) and 1(b) were 63.33% and 56.67% respectively compared with a 
tremendously high rate of 82.35% in the Open Court condition of experiment 1(c).  Thus the 
divergent witness ratings and conviction rates between the three control groups may be 
indicative of some residual carry-over effects in Experiment 1(c).  The procedure was 
counter-balanced and a ten minute distracter task was employed, however, it does appear 
that the participants were affected by carry-over effects in Experiment 1(c).   
All three experiments employed a within subjects design using individual participants to 
serve as mock jurors who assessed the witness and delivered a verdict independently.  The 
data clearly lacks external validity as trials are not adjudicated by jurors working in isolation.  
Despite this limitation, the findings may perhaps be generalised to a different key component 
of the judicial system; the judge or sheriff.  Whilst the number of solemn criminal trials are 
decreasing each year (Tinsley, 2001) the number of civil trials are on the increase.  Many of 
these civil trials are purely monetary and there is distinct move towards non-jury trials in 
which the judge of sheriff arbitrates the complaint.  To date, there has been no published 
data which has examined the effects of using Special Measures upon the judge/sheriffs 
verdicts.  Thus while the results are of interest it was important to extend the study to 
enhance the external validity and generate results which may be widely applied to the British 
criminal justice system.  Certainly, the effects that the use of Special Measures exerts upon 
the decisions of judges and sheriffs is an important direction for future research.   
Experiment 2 addressed these issues by using standard jury groups of thirteen participants 
and requiring them to deliberate to achieve a majority verdict.  Furthermore each trial was 
designed to appear as realistic as possible; standard procedures were employed and jurors 
received specific instructions regarding their expected participation.   
The data from Experiment 2 immediately reported there to be no significant effect of 
deliberation upon juror perceptions of witness believability and defendant guilt.  The 
individual jurors ratings of the witness and verdict decision did not differ significantly after 
deliberations from their initial judgements reported immediately after testimony concluded.  
Thus this provides some further corroborating evidence that jurors tend to stick to their initial 
perceptions, particularly when this view is held by a majority of jurors (Stasser, Kerr & Bray, 
1982).  Why does the introduction of deliberating groups not appear to exert an effect upon 
the mock jurors?  It is suggested that the jury group of 13 prompts the individual juror to use 
caution in expressing their opinions for fear of disapproval or rejection by the other jurors 
(Hastie et al, 1983; Moreland, Levine & Wingert, 1996; Blamey, McCarthy & Smith, 2000).  
There is documented evidence in the literature regarding group dynamics which suggests 
that individuals exhibit a desire for conformity, especially in groups of strangers (McKelvey & 
Kerr, 1988; Asch, 1951).   
Despite finding that deliberations do not significantly alter jurors perceptions, it is of much 
greater interest that the general pattern of data evidenced in the first experimental series 
was not replicated in Experiment 2.  The data explicitly suggests that mock jurors rate 
vulnerable and/or intimidated as more credible and believable as their testimony is delivered 
further from the courtroom.  Generally, the mock jurors rated the witness who testified in an 
Open Court without Special Measures as least credible followed by live CCTV link, use of a 
screen and pre-recorded video evidence.  Equally, believability scores revealed the jurors to 
again rate the witness who testified in an Open Court as least believable followed by those 
using a screen, live CCTV link and finally Pre-recorded Video Evidence.  Conviction rate 
data revealed a marginally different pattern to that observed for the ratings of the witness; 
conviction rates were weakest in the control condition and increased when the witness used 
a screen and a live CCTV link.  However, when the witness testified via Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence the rate of conviction declined to a similar level achieved when testimony was 
delivered from behind a screen; a level of conviction only slightly greater than that generated 
in the Open Court condition.  Therefore, although the mock jurors perceive witnesses who 
testify via Pre-recorded Video Evidence as more credible this does not appear to affect the 
rate of conviction.   
While this finding appears to be a positive step for witnesses there is certainly cause for 
concern regarding mock jurors perceptions of defendants and their right to presumed 
innocence.  Although the data reveals a general increasing trend in ratings of witness 
credibility and believability it must be noted that the ratings were lower overall than those 
given throughout experiments 1(a)  (c), when the jurors were tested in isolation, and the 
likelihood of a guilty verdict was also weaker than in the previous experiments.  Certainly the 
results indicate that vulnerable and intimidated adult witnesses should not be discouraged 
from choosing Special Measures to aid their testimony delivery; indeed if they are eligible 
there is strong evidence to guide them towards the increasing isolated methods of live CCTV 
link and pre-recorded video evidence.  Both of these conditions are associated with specific 
benefits for witnesses; increased credibility ratings when using pre-recorded video evidence 
and a greater chance of defendant conviction when using a CCTV link.  For these very same 
reasons the data raises some concerning side effects for defendants and their legal teams.  
The results are strongly indicative of a negative biasing effect of the use of Special 
Measures upon jurors immediate perceptions of the defendant, as widely predicted by the 
Justiciary and the literature (Hamlyn et al, 2006; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Davies 
& Noon, 1991; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Landstrom et al., 2007; Swim et al, 1993; Goodman et 
al, 1998).   
The results of Experiment 2 were expected to follow a similar trend as observed in the initial 
experimental series; that the mock jurors would rate the vulnerable witness as increasingly 
less credible and believable as the Special Measure employed increasingly isolated the 
witness.  In turn, because of these diminishing ratings the conviction rates were expected to 
decrease progressively.  Yet the data shows an unmistakable opposite trend of increasing 
witness ratings and conviction rates.   
As the only change in procedure between Experiments 1 and 2 was the change to include 
deliberating jury groups, it is thought that it is this change which prompted the reverse 
pattern.  It is suggested that requiring the jury to deliberate resulted in several jurors to posit 
the theory that there must be a reason why this witness is afraid to face the defendant 
which is then pursued by the group until a majority verdict is reached.  Such a line of thought 
obviously leads to a bias in jurors perception of the witness and the guilt of the defendant.  
However, the rates of guilty verdicts overall in the second experiment were consistently low, 
the highest achieved being 24.8%.  Evidence from the audio recordings of the deliberation 
phase confirmed that in each of the experimental groups, Screen, CCTV and PVE, at least 
one juror adopted the rationale that the use of a Special Measure indicated defendant guilt.  
Yet these jurors were consistently in the minority in believing the defendant guilty.  A related 
issue in this point may be that the other jurors who adopted a not guilty stance did believe 
the defendant to be culpable but felt that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof.  It 
could be that, had the Not Proven verdict, uniquely available under Scots Law, been an 
option to the mock jurors, the data may have yielded some different results.  Thus it is 
suggested that when the mock jurors know they have to deliberate in a large group of 
strangers each individual juror becomes more conservative in their perceptions and appears 
to seek conformity within the jury group (Asch, 1951; McKelvey & Kerr, 1988; Hastie et al, 
1983; Moreland, Levine & Wingert, 1996).   
Despite both experiments returning diametrically opposite data the findings from Experiment 
2 are strongly valid.  There can be little suggestion that the study lacks ecological validity; 
each mock trial was recorded in a model courtroom; standard jury instructions were given; 
required to deliberate: first to try for unanimous verdict then a majority if necessary and 
standard sized jury groups were recruited, all of whom were strangers to each other.  
Certainly there is some degree of simulation in that the jurors did not view the trial live, just a 
video recording, which may raise some concerns.  However, recent studies have found there 
to be no significant difference in results obtained from videotaped stimuli compared to live 
stimuli (Pozzulo, Crescini & Panton, 2008; Bornstein, 1999).  In addition there may be some 
reservation regarding the demographics of the participants recruited to act as jurors 
throughout the experimental series.  Certainly the vast majority of the participants in this 
series of experiments were university students of wide ranging age and status yet there is 
substantial evidence in the literature that students are consistently more lenient in their 
verdicts and less likely to convict (Devine, Clayton, Dunford, Seying & Pryce, 2001; Nemeth, 
1981; Caspar, Benedict & Perry, 1989).  Future research should address this issue by 
recruiting from a wider population.   
However, the data from the entire experimental series has shed some light upon the effects 
the use of Special Measure exerts upon mock jurors perceptions of vulnerable and/or 
intimidated witnesses and defendant guilt.  There has been little research conducted in this 
area especially using adult vulnerable witnesses and it appears to yield contentious results.  
Certainly, under the current format there is strong evidence to suggest that juries routinely 
perceive witnesses as more credible and believable as the witness become more removed 
from the live trial proceedings.   
This is in contrast to much of the available data which claims the opposite effect; that 
testimony impact is diminished and witness credibility decreases with increasing isolation 
(Davies & Noon, 1991; Swim et al, 1993; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Landstrom et al., 2005, 
2007).  Equally, the rate of convictions increased in line with the ratings of the witness which 
suggests that jurors implicitly associate use of Special Measures with defendant guilt.  
Clearly there is evidence to support the concerns of defence lawyers and judges.   
The use of Special Measures whilst testifying remains an option only for those adult 
witnesses who meet stringent conditions and it is often the case that these witnesses are 
vitally important to the case and may have the most damaging testimony.  There is clear 
evidence that jurors are more receptive to witness who elect to testify from out with the 
courtroom; they rate witnesses as most credible when using pre-recorded video evidence 
yet it is the use of live CCTV links which are associated with the greatest likelihood of 
conviction.  While the introduction of Special Measures is certainly a step forward in 
improving the witness experience at court this advancement cannot be made at the expense 
of the rights of the defendant and further investigations are required to more fully understand 
the nature of this effect and the implications for defendants.

Summary, Policy Recommendations 
and Conclusions 
This thesis has examined the pathway of vulnerable witnesses through the criminal justice 
system; from identity parade to testifying in court using Special Measures.  This pathway has 
been radically altered over the course of the past ten years with the introduction of a video-
based identity parade protocol and the implementation of the Special Measures to enhance 
the in-court experience of the witness whilst improving testimony quality for jurors.  While 
there is extensive literature professing the benefits of the sequential video format over the 
traditional simultaneous parade there is an obvious knowledge gap in that the conditions 
under which sequential superiority occurs remain unknown.  Equally, the provisions now 
permitted to aid vulnerable witnesses during testimony have generally been widely 
welcomed (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al., 2004; Birch, 2000; Tausz & 
Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001), yet there has been little research into the effect their 
implementation has had upon jurors and no research has employed vulnerable adult 
witnesses.  Therefore, it has been the primary aim of this thesis to investigate the efficacy 
and value of each of these key markers of a witnesss journey from identification to trial. 
It is apparent from the literature that there is a generally accepted theory with the research 
community that sequential presentation of identity parades are linked with a significantly 
superior rate of correct rejections during target absent parades, termed the Sequential 
Superiority Effect, whilst maintaining a high rate of correct identifications for target present 
identity parades (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Wells, 
2008, 1993; Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 1998; Kassin et al., 2001; Gronlund, 
2004).  However, it is also evident that much of the data supporting this effect derives from 
studies using an entirely sequential procedure, whereby witnesses may view each parade 
member once only (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Wells, 
2008, 1993; Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 1998; Kassin et al., 2001; Gronlund, 
2004; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Memon & Gabbert, 2003).  Such a procedure, in the 
United Kingdom, represents a contravention of Code D of The Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act (1984, 2008) which stipulates that eyewitnesses must view the entire parade at least 
twice before they can make a decision (Valentine, 2006; The Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act 1984, Code D 2008). 
The current experiments were markedly different from much of the current literature in that 
they were specifically designed to adhere to the existing British legislation.  Therefore, all 
participants were instructed not to make an identification decision until the identity parade 
had been shown twice.  This may be a contributing factor to the differing trend reported in 
the current analyses.  Whereas much of the current literature suggests that the more 
traditional, simultaneous identity parade format is superior to the sequential format for target 
present parades (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Memon 
& Gabbert, 2003; Wells, 2008, 1993; Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 1998; Kassin et 
al., 2001; Gronlund, 2004; Valentine et al., 2007; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999) this was not the 
case in the current experiments.  The data indicates that the sequential V.I.P.E.R. format 
was superior to the simultaneous format across all four conditions, eliciting a greater number 
of correct identification; however, subsequent analysis did not reveal a significant difference.  
Furthermore, the current study found no evidence of sequential superiority during target 
absent parades; the V.I.P.E.R. parade was outperformed by the traditional simultaneous 
parade in three of the four conditions and overall there was no significant difference in the 
rate of false positive identifications between the two parade types.   
Addressing first the general trend of V.I.P.E.R. superiority for target present parades; 
evidence of V.I.P.E.R.s superiority was not expected as the literature reports that the 
sequential parade, at best, maintains a similar hit rate associated with the simultaneous 
format (Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Kassin 
et al., 2001) and, at worse, actually decreases correct identifications (Wells, 2008; Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003), resulting in more guilty individuals avoiding prosecution. Although in this 
study there was no significant difference in the rate of correct identifications between the two 
parade types, this so-called sequential superiority effect is more frequently reported in 
association with target absent parades.  However, as discussed earlier, the majority of the 
literature examining sequential identity parades has employed a wholly sequential 
presentation of static images rather than the partially sequential presentation of moving 
images.  Data from the only study which has used V.I.P.E.R (Valentine, Darling & Memon, 
2007) also reported no significant difference in the rate of correct identification, in line with 
the findings of the current experiments.  The data from the Valentine et al. study also 
provided more supporting evidence that strict sequential presentation is associated with a 
significant decrease in sensitivity for target present parades; the number of correct 
identifications is significantly reduced.  In an applied setting, this could be construed as an 
increase in the number of guilty culprits going unidentified; this is particularly relevant in 
cases where there is a distinct lack of other, non-witness, evidence to support the allegation.   
Turning to the target absent data from the current study; the data suggests that there is no 
significant difference in the rate of correct rejections between the two parade types.  It was 
hypothesised that the V.I.P.E.R. parades would be associated with a significantly greater 
number of correct rejections compared to the simultaneous presentation.  There was no 
evidence to support this hypothesis and so it appears that the V.I.P.E.R. parade is not 
significantly better at reducing mistaken identifications than the simultaneous parade.   
It is suggested that the superiority trend for target present parades and the non-significant 
difference for target absent parades reported here are driven by the procedural differences 
between this study and the extant literature; while the large majority of research in this area 
has elected to use a fully sequential parade format, the current study was designed to mimic 
the exact procedure used by British police forces.  While it is strongly recommended by 
researchers that the images within the identity parade be viewed by witnesses only once, 
UK legislation has not taken this step, requiring the entire parade be shown twice before 
permitting witnesses to make their decision known.  It is this difference which is thought to 
be the key change which is driving the unanticipated results of this study. 
The literature strongly favours the judgement style theory for explaining the sequential 
superiority effect; that a relative judgement style is used during simultaneous parades while 
an absolute judgement style is associated with the sequential parade format (Lindsay & 
Wells, 1985; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; 
Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Levi, 1998; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; 
Kneller et al., 2001; Wells et al., 1998; Clark & Davey, 2005).  Interpreting the current results 
in terms of this theory may explain why such a pattern has emerged.  It is hypothesised that, 
due to the two-view procedure required by V.I.P.E.R., the eyewitness is able to use the 
relative judgement style on their first viewing before switching and engaging an absolute 
judgement style.  In this method, the eyewitness can compare the faces both across the 
parade and to their memory trace of the perpetrator and identify the best match faces 
before engaging an absolute judgement style on the second pass; focusing on the 
previously identified best matches, possibly with a higher match criterion (Meissner et al., 
2005; Ebbesen & Flowe, 2002; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006), to make a final, definitive 
decision; reject or accept.   
This hypothesised model would account for the V.I.P.E.R. hit rate being slightly greater than 
that associated with the simultaneous parade; the hit rates were relatively high in both 
parade types however it may perhaps be that the repeated presentation of the sequential 
V.I.P.E.R. parade improves the ability of the eyewitness to make a decision rather than 
choosing to reject because of uncertainty.  Evidence to support this theory may be found in 
the literature; Memon & Gabbert (2003) examined the sequential parade and its success in 
target present parades.  This study employed a fully sequential procedure, unlike V.I.P.E.R., 
and reported that the participants who viewed the sequential parade were less prone to 
make an identification decision and therefore rejected the target present parade more 
frequently than those participants who had viewed the simultaneous parade.  Perhaps the 
legislative requirement of viewing the V.I.P.E.R. parade twice actually reverses this trend 
and provides a boost to eyewitness confidence and increases the likelihood of making a 
positive identification.   
Under the terms of this proposed dual-judgement style model we would then perhaps 
anticipate that the sequential V.I.P.E.R. parades would also elicit, in line with the literature 
(Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Wells, 2008, 1993; 
Valentine, 2006; Pike et al., 2000; Levi, 1998; Kassin et al., 2001; Gronlund, 2004; 
McQuiston-Surret et al., 2006; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine et al., 2007), a 
significantly greater rate of correct rejections during target absent parades.  The first pass 
viewing would allow the eyewitness to compare each individual to their memory of the 
perpetrator and identify any potential matches before the switch to an absolute judgement, 
and tougher match criterion, leading to eventual rejection of the entire parade.  Yet the data 
clearly shows that there is no significant difference between the simultaneous and V.I.P.E.R. 
parade types in terms of the rate of correct rejections with both formats eliciting a rate of 
approximately 52%.     
It is thought that this poor performance of the V.I.P.E.R. format during the target absent 
parade is provoked by the same factors that elicited sequential superiority during target 
present parades.  When the eyewitness makes tentative potential identifications on the first 
viewing of the V.I.P.E.R. parade the repeated presentation in the second viewing may, in 
combination with the implicit priming associated with attending a parade (Wells, 1993), lead 
the eyewitness to feel pressured to make an identification, particularly as the parade draws 
towards conclusion.  These two factors of priming and pressure to decide may lead to an 
increase in the number of false positive identifications being made and, in turn, increases the 
possibility of wrongful convictions.   
There are some suggestions in the current literature to support this; Lindsay, Lea & Fulford 
(1991) conducted a range of experiments to examine several violations of the sequential 
identity parade procedure; namely repeated presentation.  What they found was suggestive 
evidence that allowing eyewitnesses to view the identity parade twice increased the rate of 
false identifications.  Lindsay et al. claimed that this rise in misidentifications arises from the 
increased pressure upon witnesses to choose; at the end of the first presentation the 
witness knows how many individuals are present and therefore as the second presentation 
of the parade draws towards its conclusion the witness feels pressured to make an 
identification, even though they have been explicitly told previously that the perpetrator may 
not be present (PACE Code D, 2008; Valentine, 2006; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Steblay et al., 
2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999).   It may be that this increase in selection pressure, in 
combination with the priming associated with attending an identity parade, leads to an 
inclination to make an identification of the best-match individual, even though the witness 
may not be absolutely certain (Steblay et al., 2001; Memon & Gabbert, 2003; Lindsay & 
Wells, 1985; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006).  This pressure to select is why so much of the 
extant literature strongly advocates singular presentation of sequential identity parade 
images (Lindsay & Wells, 1985; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Levi & 
Lindsay, 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Valentine et al., 2007; Tredoux & Chiroro, 2006; 
Wells et al., 1998).   
The legislation requiring double presentation may be leading towards a hybrid presentation-
judgement model allowing eyewitnesses to use both relative and absolute judgements styles 
whilst also allowing them to know how many individuals make up the parade.  In its current 
state V.I.P.E.R. is not a wholly sequential format and thus cannot be anticipated to elicit the 
same effects reported by the literature.  Although in its current double presentation format 
V.I.P.E.R. performs significantly better than the more traditional simultaneous parade for 
target present parades what is of greater concern is its relatively poor performance for target 
absent parades.   
V.I.P.E.R. was introduced by British police forces primarily as a cost-cutting device (Slater, 
1995) yet the abundance of research proclaiming the power of the sequential parade to 
minimise false identifications was undoubtedly a substantial influencing factor.  However, its 
performance at this task whilst constrained by the legal requirements of PACE Code D is 
significantly limited.  In the current study, the rate of mis-identifications was 47% for both the 
V.I.P.E.R. and simultaneous parade formats; despite V.I.P.E.R. adhering to a double-blind 
administration (The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Code D 2008) and using a 
central database of images to improve parade fairness (Valentine & Heaton, 1999; Steblay 
et al., 2001; Slater, 1995).  Therefore, the current data clearly shows that there is no 
advantage to justice in using the hybrid V.I.P.E.R. format over the simultaneous procedure.  
Although these false identifications are no longer likely to proceed beyond this stage, unlike 
target absent simultaneous parades (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001), the poor 
performance of the eyewitness at the parade has the propensity to damage the credibility of 
the witness in the eyes of the judicial system (Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001). 
Therefore, on the basis of the current data, it is advised that the V.I.P.E.R. identity parade 
system is not associated with a significant reduction of mis-identifications as reported of the 
wholly sequential format advocated by the research community (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 
2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Kassin et al., 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Lindsay & Wells, 
1985; Levi, 1998; Levi & Lindsay, 2001).  Furthermore, there is no significant benefit of using 
V.I.P.E.R. over the traditional format for target present parades.  However, it is 
recommended that the V.I.P.E.R. format continued to be employed by national police forces 
as, despite its comparable performance to simultaneous parades, there are associated 
advantages to it use; the reduction in delay between incident and identity parade, the 
reduction in police costs and the ability to deliver identity parades in a locale which is more 
comfortable for the eyewitness, without the threat of meeting the accused.  However policy 
makers must be aware that there is no inherent advantage of V.I.P.E.R. for target absent 
parades with the exception of reducing the number of wrongful prosecutions of an identified 
innocent foil (Valentine & Heaton, 1999) which would likely arise from a false identification 
from a traditional simultaneous parade.   
It is also recommended that further investigations be carried out to examine the underlying 
processes of the V.I.P.E.R. parade format to gain a deeper understanding of why V.I.P.E.R. 
does not exert similar effects as a wholly sequential format.  We speculate that the dual 
presentation of the parade images allows eyewitnesses to know how many individuals 
comprise the parade and permits them to use both relative and absolute judgements styles 
in a hybrid model which allows first for sorting and then secondly identifying.  It is 
recommended that policymakers further consider the necessity of PACE Code D and assess 
whether the removal of this legislative constraint may enhance the discriminability of 
V.I.P.E.R. for target absent parades.  A non-PACE Code D condition was not included as 
part of the current study as the aims of the research was to examine V.I.P.E.R. in its applied 
format and its performance against the traditional, simultaneous format.  There is already a 
significant body of research which has tested the effectiveness of the strict sequential 
procedure.  Certainly future investigations should involve a direct test between the V.I.P.E.R. 
procedure and the strict sequential procedure, with particular emphasis on determining the 
exact judgement styles engaged by witnesses during both types of parades.   In addition, 
with recent research failing to replicate the Sequential Superiority Effect for target absent 
parades (Carlson, Gronlund & Clark, 2008; Valentine et al., 2007) further research is 
required to determine the robustness of the claimed Sequential Superiority Effect.  The 
controversies surrounding the Illinois Field Tests of sequential identity parades (Steblay, 
2010, 2006; Wells, 2006; Mecklenburg, 2006) serve as a reminder that even basic 
methodological procedures may exert an effect upon the choosing rates of eyewitnesses 
and so future research should be stringent in its adherence to established methodologies 
where possible.   
Specifically in terms of the V.I.P.E.R. procedure, the first step in future research should be 
the introduction of a non-PACE Code D variation, allowing the witness to view the entire 
parade once before making their decision.  This procedure would eliminate the potential for 
a hybrid model which enables both relative and absolute judgements, and may have a 
significant effect upon the rate of correct, and mistaken, identifications.  Further research 
should also be undertaken to determine the extent of any implicit priming associated with 
attending an identity parade (Wells, 1993) and the value of pre-parade instructions to 
combat this effect.  There have already been several ventures into this area which have 
shown that the instructions given to witnesses prior to viewing a parade may be exerting an 
effect upon their likelihood of making an identification.  For example, Rose, Bull & Vrji (2005) 
tested the effect of biased versus non-biased instructions on the rate of correct 
identifications and mistaken identifications in older adults.  As a related measure, the 
authors asked each participant during debriefing to report what they remembered of the 
instructions given to them before viewing the parade.  The findings showed that witnesses of 
all ages forgot being given the standard, non-biased instructions informing them that the 
culprit may or may not be present.  Certainly more of the older witnesses forgot these 
instructions than the younger witnesses, which is explained in terms of age-related memory 
deficits, but most importantly, the witnesses who forgot these non-biased instructions made 
significantly more errors on both target present and target absent parades.  In contrast, 
those witnesses who remembered the non-biased instructions made significantly fewer 
errors, particularly when viewing a target absent parade.  This is a finding that has been 
replicated to varying degrees in other papers (Brewer & Wells, 2006; Malpass & Devine, 
1981; Steblay, 1997). Future research should attempt to address this issue in an attempt to 
resolve this systemic, implicit bias which leads eyewitnesses to make an identification.   
Despite these considerations it is important to recognise that there are a substantial number 
of other factors which may affect eyewitness performance at an identity parade; the inherent 
difficulty of the task (Megreya & Burton, 2008; Kemp et al., 1997; Valentine et al., 2007; 
Megreya & Burton, 2006; Newell, Chiroro & Valentine, 1999), verbalisation effects (Meissner 
& Brigham, 2001; Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990), change of appearance (Memon & 
Gabbert, 2003) memory (Ebbinghaus, 1885; Deffenbacher et al., 2004; Ebbesen & Rienick, 
1998; Kemp et al., 2001; Bromby, 2002; Dunning & Stern, 1992; Christianson, 1992), 
situational factors such as weapon focus and stress (Steblay, 1992; MacLin, MacLin & 
Malpass, 2001; Maass & Kohnken, 1989; Valentine & Mesout, 2009; Morgan et al., 2004; 
Deffenbacher et al., 2004) and administrative issues (Wells et al., 1998; Wells, 1993; 
Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Steblay et al., 2001; McQuiston-Surret et al., 2006; Levi & 
Lindsay, 2001).  It would be imprudent to declare one parade format superior purely on the 
facet of success rates when there are so many other influences to account for.  On the basis 
of the current results V.I.P.E.R. appears to be fit for its purpose; reducing costs whilst 
preserving identification rates for both target present and target absent parades.  V.I.P.E.R 
is certainly no poorer than the more traditional, simultaneous format.   
The next stage of this thesis was to investigate the following step in an eye-witnesss journey 
through the criminal justice system.  Specifically what effect the use of Special Measures 
exerts upon jurors perceptions of vulnerable adult witnesses; do they provoke a sympathetic 
response and boost credibility or are they reducing witness credibility and the likelihood of 
gaining a conviction?  Crucially there are two criteria which are required to be met by any 
adult witness applying for permission to testify under these Special Measures: a proven 
history of intimidation in relation to their testimony and having made a positive identification 
from a V.I.P.E.R. identity parade (Vital Voices: Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give 
Evidence, 2003).   
As discussed previously there is little literature which has tested the effects wrought upon 
jurors by observing a witness testifying using special measures (Goodman et al., 1998; 
Swim et al., 1993) and fewer still which have employed adult vulnerable witnesses.  From an 
assessment of the currently published literature it appears that the current thesis may be the 
first to examine the effects that the special measures; use of a wooden screen, live CCTV 
link and pre-recorded video evidence, exert upon jurors perceptions of vulnerable adult 
witnesses.   
Certainly there has been some research examining the effects of live CCTV links for 
vulnerable child witnesses which has detailed a negative bias associated with testimony 
delivered in this manner.  Goodman et al., (1998) found that although there was no 
significant effect upon conviction rates there was a small but significant decline in the mock 
jurors ratings of witness credibility despite perceiving them as more confident and 
consistent.  Landstrom et al. (2005) reported that jurors who viewed live child witnesses 
reported them as being significantly more honest, more plausible and more confident than a 
child witness who testified via pre-recorded evidence.   However, there are many other 
variables which jurors account for when judging child witnesses which may perhaps be a 
contributory factor of the decrease in credibility ratings (Quas, Thompson & Clarke-Stewart, 
2005; Regan & Baker, 1998; Golding et al., 2003; Wheatcroft et al., 2004; Laimon & Poole, 
2008).   
There is also concern that the use of Special Measures during testimony may equally exert a 
negative effect upon jurors perceptions of defendant guilt (Richards, Morris & Richards, 
2008; Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000; Hamlyn et al., 2006).  There are 
claims that the use of Special Measures carries an implicit assumption of defendant guilt 
which may bias the jurors to the witnesss favour and thus increase the possibility of a guilty 
conviction (Tausz & Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000).  The data from the jury 
deliberations of Experiment 2 suggest that there is a small minority of the population who do 
form a link between the use of Special Measures and defendant guilt.  In each of the three 
experimental conditions (Screen, CCTV and PVE) at least one mock juror raised this issue 
during deliberations and prompted a discussion of the validity of such a link.  Equally, the 
majority of each jury group appeared to be aware that there are any number of factors which 
could have led to the witness electing to testify via a Special Measure.  Of most interest 
thought to legal practitioners though is that, while there were small numbers of jurors who 
made a link between Special Measures and defendant guilt, this did not have any adverse 
effect upon the official delivered verdict.  It did however make it more difficult to deliver a 
unanimous verdict; only the jurors who viewed the Screen condition delivered a unanimous 
verdict.  Analysis of the audio recordings of the deliberations suggested that the jurors in the 
CCTV condition and the Pre-Recorded Video Evidence were at an impasse before being 
informed that a majority verdict would suffice.  Whilst this is not such a significant effect in 
the United Kingdom it may lead to hung juries in jurisdictions require unanimity.   
The data stemming from the initial series of experiments, where the jurors viewed the 
testimony and made judgements individually, suggested that the more removed the witness 
became from the courtroom the less credible they were rated by the mock jurors.  There was 
no significant difference in witness ratings or conviction rates between the control, Open 
Court, condition and the Screen condition while there was a significant decline in witness 
credibility scores when they testified via a live CCTV link.  However in a similar manner to 
other findings (Orcutt et al., 2001; Swim et al., 1993; Goodman et al., 1998), there was no 
decrease in the rate of guilty verdicts.  When the witness testified via Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence there was a significant decrease in witness credibility and believability ratings 
which was accompanied by a significant decline in conviction rates.   
Such data was expected: there is a proven link that jurors perceive a lack of immediacy and 
emotional impact from testimony which is delivered from outside the trial courtroom (Davies 
& Noon, 1991) and that testimony vividness plays an important role in holding jurors 
attention and in their perception of witness credibility and plausibility (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; 
Landstrom, Granhag & Hartwig, 2007; Colwell, Hiscock-Anisman, Memon, Rachel & Colwell, 
2007).  Indeed most of the data suggesting this theory has derived from CCTV link studies 
(Davies & Noon, 1991; Goodman et al., 1998; Landstrom et al., 2005, 2008; Orcutt et al., 
2001; Swim et al., 1993) It is certainly not unreasonable to extend the prevailing theory to 
account for the significant decrease in witness credibility and conviction rates when 
testimony is delivered via pre-recorded video evidence.  It is suggested that this perceived 
lack of immediacy, vividness and emotional impact originates from the jurors inability to 
closely observe the witnesss body language whilst testifying, a significant factor widely used 
by jurors to determine deceit and credibility (Aron & Rosner, 1998; Boccaccini, 2002; 
Mehrabian, 1981; Landry & Brigham, 1992).  It is further suggested that as the witness 
becomes increasingly distal from the jurors the weight given to their testimony diminished as 
the jurors pay less attention to it (Nisbett & Ross, 1980) and that physical proximity to the 
witness allows the jurors to identify with them which results in more favourable ratings of 
credibility and plausibility (Landstrom et al., 2005, 2007; Goodman et al., 1998; Orcutt et al., 
2001). It is easy to understand this association as both the CCTV link and pre-recorded 
video evidence allow only the witnesss head and shoulders to be seen whereas more 
gestures and behaviour can be observed live in-court.  Pre-recorded Video Evidence then 
takes a further step in diminishing physical proximity, vividness and emotional impact: the 
testimony is often recorded weeks and months in advance and there is no need to recount 
traumatic experiences in a public courtroom and so the witness is typically less anxious.  It 
may be that this decreased anxiety is construed as a lack of emotion, and then, in turn, an 
indicator of dishonesty (Golding et al., 2003; Wheatcroft et al., 2004; Regan & Baker, 1998; 
Boccaccini, 2002; Aron & Rosner, 1998; Landstrom et al., 2008).   
The current data clearly illustrates that there is a progressive decline in the ratings of witness 
credibility, believability and rates of conviction as the proximity between witness and jurors 
increases; a finding that supports much of the current literature in this area (Goodman et al., 
1998, 2004; Orcutt et al., 2001; Swim et al., 1993; Landstrom et al., 2005, 2005, 2008).  
However, while these results are of some value there is an intrinsic limitation to the initial 
experimental series; jurors do not deliberate in isolation but serve as part of a larger group to 
deliver a collective judgement upon the case.  Thus Experiment 2 was designed to 
determine if the effects of the Special Measures upon jurors perceptions were replicated 
when a deliberation stage was introduced.   
The first analysis examined if there was a significant effect of deliberation; did the jurors 
ratings of the witness and likelihood of conviction significantly change after deliberation with 
the other jurors.  The data is clear on this point; there is no evidence to suggest that the 
individual jurors perceptions were altered significantly by the group deliberations.  There 
was evidence of a small decreasing trend but this was not a significant effect.  This finding 
supports the hypothesis that initial juror perceptions, once formed, are firmly set and highly 
unlikely to be significantly altered (Stasser et al., 1982; McKelvey & Kerr, 1988; Asch, 1951).   
The second analysis was performed entirely on the after deliberation data to determine 
whether there were any significant differences between the four trial conditions when 
presented to a deliberating group.  There was a general increasing trend with ratings of the 
witness being lowest in the Open Court condition and rising steadily with decreasing witness 
proximity.  However, the resultant analysis of the data revealed that there was no significant 
effect of testimony presentation method upon the mean ratings of vulnerable witness 
credibility and believability.  There was a similar pattern within the verdict data; there is a 
general increasing trend as the jurors proximity to the witness decreases when we look at 
the Open Court (14.8%), Screen (15.38%) and CCTV link (24.8%) data.  Yet, when Pre-
recorded Video Evidence was used the rate of guilty verdicts fell back to 15.4%.   While this 
pattern is readily evident, not one of the three experimental conditions differed significantly 
from the control condition.   
We can plainly see that the after deliberation data elicited an opposite effect to that seen in 
the first experimental series.  When the jurors view the testimony and deliberate as a group 
there is an obvious increase in the mean ratings of witness credibility, believability and the 
number of guilty verdicts as the Special Measures increasingly isolates the witness from the 
jurors.  It was speculated that this opposite trend derives from one, or more, of the 13 
member jury group proposing the use of a Special Measure as an implicit suggestion of 
defendant guilt which is developed into increased witness confidence.  However, whilst there 
is evidence from the audio recordings that there were a small number of jurors in each 
experimental jury group that proposed this link between defendant guilt and use of the 
Special Measure, there is no significant evidence that this influenced the jurors in the 
witness favour and led to an increased likelihood of a guilty verdict.  While this is reassuring 
for legal practitioners, it does not account for the current findings.  It is alternatively 
suggested that the mock jurors may have believed the defendant to be culpable but equally 
felt that the prosecution had failed to satisfy the burden of proof.  Indeed evidence from the 
deliberation recordings show that at least one mock juror suggested that they would prefer to 
return a not proven verdict for just such a reason.  Whilst Scots Law does have this third 
verdict option and despite the fact that the mock trials were run in accordance with Scots 
Law, the jurors were limited to either a guilty or not guilty verdict decision.  This steps were 
taken as many of the participants recruited were not Scottish and were considered to be 
unfamiliar with the not proven verdict and its interpretation but also because there has been 
little research undertaken of this option.  The extant literature on this topic has revealed that 
there is a poor understanding of the not proven verdict (Hope et al., 2008).  Additionally, the 
not proven verdict option typically accounts for only one-fifth of acquittals in Scotland 
(Scottish Office Study, 2004) and is associated with much controversy 
(http://www.siliconglen.com/Scotland/1_8.html; Bray, 2005; Duff, 1999; Davies, 1996; 
Barbato, 2005; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6500541.stm).     As the not proven 
verdict results in the same outcome as a not guilty verdict, acquittal, it was decided to use 
only not guilty as a means of simplifying the methodology.   
While there were no significant differences in testimony presentation method identified, the 
trend is unmistakable and therefore the data raises some serious questions for the judicial 
system.  While it is certainly advantageous to vulnerable witnesses to be permitted to testify 
using a variety of Special Measures, the data from this thesis provides some small 
corroborating evidence for claims of an implicit negative bias of defendant guilt (Tausz & 
Ellison, 2005; Hoyano, 2001; Birch, 2000).   
In summary, the data from this thesis provides both a valuable start point for further 
investigations in this particular area and, more importantly, provides quantitative evidence as 
to the success of the provisions of The Vulnerable Witnesses Act.  There is weak evidence 
that when Special Measures are used in court they carry an implicit connotation of defendant 
guilt before testimony is even begun and this prompts the mock jurors to rate the vulnerable 
adult witness as more credible over the witness who testified in an open court.  However, 
this finding was not directly tested by the current study and further research is necessary to 
firmly establish this implicit link.  There is a clear increasing trend in mean witness ratings as 
the Special Measures invoked increasingly remove the witness from the scrutiny of the 
jurors.  This is in contrast to the extant literature which claims that as proximity to the witness 
decreases, the ratings of witness credibility decrease due to a decline in testimony vividness 
(Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Colwell et al., 2007; Landstrom et al., 2007), emotional impact 
(Davies & Noon, 1991) and immediacy (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Davies & Noon, 1991).  
However, all of these studies have used children as their vulnerable witness whilst the 
current research used a vulnerable adult witness.  To date, this is the only paper which has 
tested mock jurors perceptions of adult witnesses who elect to testify via Special Measures.  
Thus, it may be that these findings are typical and so further investigations are required to 
corroborate the data and clearly define the effects of Special Measures on jurors 
perceptions of vulnerable adult witnesses.    
Not one of the experimental conditions elicited a significant increase in the number of guilty 
verdicts over that associated with the control condition, Open Court.  Therefore it is claimed 
that despite the increase in perceived witness credibility, and thus negative bias towards the 
defendant, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of Special Measures erodes the 
judicial rights of the defendant.  There is a persuasive suggestion that the vulnerable 
witnesss testimony is delivered more effectively and that the witness experience of trial and 
testimony is less distressing (Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Birch, 2000) when Special 
Measures are invoked.   
However, there appears to be an extraneous effect of using Special Measures upon 
witnesses later reflections; Richards, Morris & Richards (2008) reported that vulnerable 
witnesses stated after the conclusion of their trial that they would not be willing to testify in 
any other trial without the same considerations, a finding also reported by Birch in her 2000 
review of the Special Measures provisions in England and Wales.  This means that they 
would refuse to testify if they were not permitted to use Special Measures, even though they 
may not meet the stringent criteria in a different trial.  It is therefore suggested that the 
witness experience in general be improved.  For example, many courts still use communal 
waiting rooms for both prosecution and defence witnesses; the issues regarding this are 
evident, exposing witnesses to further conflict and stress.  Furthermore, the Richards, Morris 
& Richards (2008) survey found that witnesses feel isolated from both the route to trial, 
judgements and sentencing, often claiming that they hear nothing between attending an 
identity parade and receiving a citation to appear at court.  This lack of information leads to 
the witness feeling unvalued by the judicial system and contributes to their later reluctance 
to testify in other trials (Hamlyn et al., 2006; Birch, 2000).  It seems that improving the 
witnesss sense of personal significance to the trial (Burton, Evans & Sanders, 2006; 
Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008) may go some way towards ameliorating the pervading 
negative view of the witness experience at court. It may be beneficial to the judicial system 
as a whole that the procedures of the court be further modified in line with these 
recommendations to improve the general experience of witnesses summoned to testify 
rather than focusing on a small sub-population which may be exacerbating reluctance to 
testify.   
There are of course several limitations of the Special Measures experiments.  The extent to 
which the mock jurors understood the vulnerability of the adult witness is undetermined.  
Under the terms of The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2003, jurors are not told the 
reasons behind the judges decision to permit Special Measures during testimony.  This is 
obviously to prevent any bias being sparked in the jurors perception of the defendant and to 
allow the defendant a fair trial.  Future research should aim to investigate these instructions 
to the jury more closely; would specific instructions to the jury reduce the influence that the 
use of Special Measures exerts over juror perceptions of witnesses?  It would also be 
advantageous to determine exactly how much the public understands about the provisions 
for vulnerable witnesses; what characterises them as vulnerable?  Experiment 2 provided 
valuable data regarding the deliberations of mock jury groups although no significant 
difference were found.  Yet several factors were very close to the level of significance which 
may be a consequence of the small sample size allocated to each of the jury groups (n = 
13).  Future research should expand these sample sizes by running several different jury 
groups for each of the four conditions.  Finally, further research is required to clearly identify 
the cues used by mock jurors when making their judgments of witness credibility and 
believability.  This could take the form of either open-ended questions during debriefing or 
through including self-report options on the measurement questionnaires.  This research 
should help to determine exactly how jurors perceive vulnerable adult witnesses and what 
behavioural, verbal and emotional cues lead them to these perceptions.  Finally, the use of 
jury trials is decreasing every year (Tinsley, 2001) with the rise of civil trials presided over by 
a single judge or sheriff.  The data generated from Experiments 1(a)  1(c) provide some 
data as to the effects that Special Measures exert upon a single arbiter; the use of Special 
Measures during testimony was associated with a decrease in ratings of witness credibility 
and a decrease in the number of convictions, particularly when Pre-recorded Video 
Evidence was employed.  While these data give us an early impression of the effects 
Special Measures exert upon a single arbiter in a trial it must be noted that the participants 
in these experiments were predominantly students and none were trained legal 
professionals.  Future research should attempt to examine the effect of Special Measures 
exert upon judges and sheriffs perceptions of vulnerable adult witnesses.   
In conclusion, there remain several obstacles on the eye-witnesss route through the criminal 
justice system.  While there is no doubt that the introduction of V.I.P.E.R. has significantly 
minimised witness apprehension (Slater, 1995; Steblay et al., 2001) and therefore caused a 
large reduction in police costs whilst improving efficiency (McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; 
Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Levi & Lindsay, 2001; Slater, 1995) it is 
apparent that there is no evidence of a significant superiority for the more problematic target 
absent parades.  It is accepted that these findings are due to the limitations enforced under 
PACE Code D regulations and are unlikely to be altered radically however, in its current 
hybrid format there will continue to be a large percentage of misidentifications although, 
fortunately, these should no longer progress to trial (Valentine & Heaton, 1999; West 
Yorkshire Police, 2009).  It is recommended that V.I.P.E.R. move progressively towards a 
wholly sequential format using the procedural guidelines as proposed widely in the literature 
(McQuiston-Surrett et al., 2006; Steblay et al., 2001; Lindsay & Pozzulo, 1999; Levi & 
Lindsay, 2001; Kassin et al., 2001).  In the interim period, as discussed earlier, further 
examination of V.I.P.E.R. under its current and proposed formats should be actively 
pursued.   
On progressing to trial it appears that the wishes and needs of the vulnerable adult witness 
are being suitably accommodated by the introduction of several Special Measures (Birch, 
2000; Richards, Morris & Richards, 2008; Hamlyn et al., 2004).  Witness groups report a 
substantial decrease in witness anxiety and witnesses themselves declare themselves to be 
largely happy with the provisions (Birch, 2000; Hamlyn et al., 2004; Richards, Morris & 
Richards, 2008).  The data suggests that it is defendants, solicitors and judges who should 
be most concerned.  There is some small evidence that the use of Special Measures does 
carry an implicit negative bias leading to biased jurors perceptions of both witness and 
defendant.  Although there was no significant negative impact upon the number of guilty 
verdicts in the current study it is strongly recommended that further investigations be 
conducted before a definitive conclusion is proposed.  At this time though it is proposed that 
policymakers require that all jury groups be given specific instructions regarding their 
perception of both witness and defendant in cases where Special Measures have been 
permitted, before proceeding to testimony.  It may be beneficial to explicitly define all the 
situations and criteria which could lead to Special Measures being used by a vulnerable 
witness.  By improving jurors understanding of the provisions of The Vulnerable Witnesses 
(Scotland) Act (2003) the implicit link between the use of Special Measures and defendant 
guilt, evidenced in the deliberations of the current study, may be reduced.   
The data generated from this thesis provides a valuable and important starting point for 
further and more detailed investigation of both eyewitness identification methods and the 
use of Special Measures in court.  While the conclusions drawn are a reasonable account of 
the data it is prudent to pursue further investigations in order to form a coherent theory for 
the effects discussed within.  It is the opinion of the author that the recent legislative steps of 
V.I.P.E.R. and Special Measures are certainly advantageous and a positive step for eye-
witnesses, yet, as discussed, there remains room for further improvement for the benefit of 
witnesses, defendants and the criminal justice system as a whole.

CROSS EXAMINED BY THE DEFENSE 
Defence:   Mr Davies, you dont appear to be too sure about your memory of this  
  alleged attack?   
GA:    I was attacked for no reason.  It happened so quickly. 
Defence:   I understand why you would claim that but how can you expect the  
  ladies and gentlemen of the jury to believe your claims when you  
  yourself appear to be so uncertain of your own recollections? 
GA:    Im not uncertain, I dont like talking about it.   
Defence:   Because you are lying about what happened? 
GA:  Im not lying. 
Defence:   So you maintain that you didnt try to strangle Mr Wallace? 
GA:    I did not. 
Defence:   Mr Allister, this is a criminal case which could affect my client for  
  several years.  Can you be absolutely certain that it was Mr Wallace  
  who allegedly threatened you?  
GA:    I am fairly certain it was him.     
Defence:   Again Mr Allister, how can you expect the jury to make a judgement 
  upon this case when they are presented with an uncertain account of 
  assault? 
GA:    It happened so quickly It is difficult to be absolutely certain.

Appendix 7:  Standard instructions for jurors regarding appointing a foreperson and 
  verdict decisions 
Your first task as a jury is to appoint a foreperson who will be responsible for chairing 
deliberations and reporting your verdict to the sheriff.   
During the course of your deliberations you may frequently wish to monitor the pattern of 
verdict responses by holding a vote.  A unanimous verdict may be possible but if it becomes 
apparent that this is not possible then please contact the court officer (experimenter) who 
will inform you of the majority verdict criteria.   
The minimum majority will require ten jurors to be unanimously in favour of the verdict to be 
delivered.
