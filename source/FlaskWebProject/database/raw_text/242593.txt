ABSTRACT 
Inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been applied to a 
reconnaissance survey of river water geochemistry in former metalliferous mining 
areas of mid- and north Wales. A semi-quantitative method of analysis, with a single 
internal standard, was used which is a rapid and sensitive technique with detection 
limits <1 tgL-1 for many elements and provides values which agree with fully 
quantitative results to within 30%, while agreement is often much better than this. 
Abandoned metal mines and waste tips throughout Wales are a continuing source of 
environmental contamination. Metals such as Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Co and Ni have been 
found in river waters reflecting the presence of weathering sulphide minerals. 
Differences in background geology also influence the river water geochemistry 
between the study areas, in particular the buffering capacity, which is a function of 
the Ca and Mg content. This in turn controls the pH and the impact of acidic and/or 
metal contaminated inputs. The carbonate gangue content of mineral veins also has an 
important role in buffering mine and tip drainage by partly neutralising acidity 
released by the oxidation of FeS2 minerals. 
Examination of seasonal changes in geochemistry has been made in 3 main areas 
around Coed y Brenin, Llangynog and Flint between November 1989 and July 1991. 
The range of element concentrations at individual sites often vary by a factor of 2 
and, in some cases, may be upto several orders of magnitude. In general, Ca and Mg 
show patterns of high summer/low winter concentrations reflecting dilution in wetter 
winter months and reduced dissolution of basic ions with increasing throughflow. 
Metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Al, Mn and Ba, however, tend to show low 
summer/high winter patterns due to a washing out effect with increasing rainfall 
inputs. PH also plays an important role with increases in acidic inputs from organic 
matter during winter aiding metal dissolution. Such seasonal variation must be taken 
into account if waters are to be used for geochemical mapping. '

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
1.1: The occurrence of metalliferous minerals in Wales 
All metals occur in varying amounts in rocks exposed at the surface but, due to a variety 
of processes, can become concentrated into potential ore deposits. 
A wide variety of metalliferous mineralisation occurs in Wales (Fig. 1.1). The most 
commonly occurring mineralisation is lead-zinc veins which are associated with faulting 
in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of mid-Wales, the Berwyn dome, Llanrwst and minor 
occurrences in parts of Pembrokeshire and the Llyn Peninsular (Archer, 1959; Hughes, 
1959). These are thought to be late stage, hydrothermal veins, emplaced after end-Silurian 
deformation of the Welsh Basin (Fitches, 1987). 
In the Harlech Dome area mineral veins of a similar, post-Caledonian age were emplaced 
in Cambrian and Ordovician rocks. These are generally lead-zinc-bearing veins but also 
tend to be copper-rich and some are gold-bearing (Archer, 1959; Allen and Jackson, 
1985). 
In NE Wales, lead-zinc mineralisation is found in the Carboniferous Limestone as steeply 
dipping tabular deposits infilling fractures in the rock (Schnellmann, 1939,1959). In 
mines at the northern and southern extremities of the ore field the ore is richer in zinc 
than those in the central zone, where lead is dominant. In many lodes throughout the area 
zinc replaces lead with increasing depth. 
In Snowdonia copper mineralisation occurs in veins in volcanic rocks closely associated 
with the development of an Ordovician resurgent caldera (Reedman et al., 1985). . 
Other types of copper mineralisation are found in the Harlech dome area near Dolgellau. 
A disseminated porphyry copper type deposit is found in Cambrian volcanic rocks at 
Coed y Brenin (Rice and Sharp, 1976) and a mineralised breccia pipe has been worked at 
Glasdir (Allen and Easterbrook, 1978). In addition a bog copper deposit was worked 
during the early part of the last century (Henwood, 1856). 
Other important mineral deposits in Wales are a copper deposit at Parys Mountain, NE 
Anglesey (Manning, 1959) and a gold deposit at Ogofau, near Pumpsaint, Dyfed (North, 
1962). These areas are not considered in this work and thus are not described in detail. 
The metal ores occur mainly as the sulphide minerals galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS) and 
chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). The main gangue minerals are quartz (Si02) and calcite (CaCO3) 
with minor barite (BaSO4) and ankerite [Ca(Mg, Fe)(C03)2]. Barite was at times 
extracted in parts of Wales when considered of economic value. 
Sulphide ore minerals frequently contain minor or trace amounts of other metals such as 
silver, cadmium, manganese, iron, arsenic, nickel, cobalt, bismuth, antimony, mercury, 
indium and selenium, while some may be present in significant concentrations (Fleischer, 
1955; El Shazly et al., 1957). The trace and minor element contents of Welsh ores are 
discussed by Kakar (1971) and Davies (1983). Examples of the trace and minor metals 
found in commonly occurring sulphide minerals are given in Table 1.1. The trace element 
contents may be extremely variable, not only between ores from different areas but also 
within the same vein. Kakar (1971) found the silver content of galena from the 
Ystumteun Mine, near Aberystwyth, to range from 8-110 ppm, while the range from all 
mines sampled in the area was 5-715 ppm. The average content of silver produced from 
the lead ores of the Cardiganshire area was 6.4 oz Ag per ton of Pb ore (Lewis, 1967). 
However, the lead-mines of NE Wales were relatively silver-poor, producing only 3.6 oz 
Ag per ton Pb ore (Lewis, 1967). 
1.2: The history of metal mining in Wales 
The history of metal mining in Wales is thought to date back to pre-Roman times but 
most clear evidence of this has been obliterated by later activities (North, 1962; Lewis, 
1967). The Romans invaded Britain in search of mineral resources and the speed with 
which they exploited the Welsh ores suggests that the presence of ore was known and 
perhaps metals were already being mined by the Britons. Evidence of Bronze Age copper 
mining has been found at Parys Mountain, Anglesey (Timberlake, 1988) and the remains 
of Roman mining activity have been found, for example, in the Flint area for lead (Lewis, 
1967) and at Pumpsaint for gold (North, 1962). 
Mining in Wales practically ceased after the Romans left, although there was some 
revival of interest in the 12th and 13th centuries when lead was needed for the building of 
castles and churches. Metalliferous mining again became important during the reign of 
Elizabeth I in the 16th century when silver was sought for the Treasury (Richardson, 
1974). Lead mines were worked primarily for the silver content of their galena which, in 
parts of mid-Wales in particular, could be relatively high (see above). The argentiferous

From Levinson (1980) 
lead ore in the former county of Cardiganshire were exploited at this time, eg. 
Cwmsymlog, near Aberystwyth (Lewis, 1967). During the 17th century lead mining 
expanded in Cardiganshire but was also active elsewhere (eg. Llanrwst). By the end of 
the century the silver content of the lead ore became less important and mines in the Flint 
area, which had formerly been considered uneconomic due to their poor silver content, 
became predominant. 
The main period of metal mining activity in Wales was 1750-1900 and lead was the main 
metal sought. Numerous mines and trials were active during this period with at least 130 
in Cardiganshire alone (North, 1962). Many were only very small and shortlived but 
major mines such as Cwmystwyth and Frongoch were worked very successfully for many 
years. The total production from Cardiganshire for the period 1845-1928 was >300,000 
tons of lead ore, approximately 117,000 tons of zinc ore and almost 2,000,000 oz of silver 
(Lewis, 1967). The mines in NE Wales, in the former counties of Flintshire and 
Denbighshire were the most productive in Wales producing a total of 658,000 tons of lead 
ore, 332,000 tons of zinc ore and >2,000,000 oz of silver between 1845 and 1938 (Lewis, 
1967), from the great mines such as Holywell, Talar-goch, Minera, Great Holway and 
Halkyn and numerous smaller ventures. Other significant lead-zinc mines active in this 
period include the highly productive Fan Mine near Llanidloes, which had a relatively 
brief history compared to most mines in Wales. Y Fan was not discovered until the mid- 
1850s but went on to produce >96,000 tons of lead and >28,000 tons of zinc ores over a 
period of about 55 years (North, 1962; Bick, 1974), a remarkable output from a single 
mine, and at a time when many other Welsh mines were in decline. Several lead-zinc 
mines on the west of the Conwy Valley were active during the 18th century, most notably 
Parc which produced 13,000 tons of lead and 14,000 tons of zinc over a period of about 
90 years from 1838 (North, 1962). In the Llangynog area of Powys lead mining reached 
its peak during the first half of the 18th century (Williams, 1985), earlier than most other 
mines in Wales. The main mine, Llangynog, was the most productive yielding >30,000 
tones of lead ore during the 18th century (Williams, 1985). 
The earliest mining operations were carried out by open-cast working of lodes 
outcropping at the surface. Following these lodes underground soon led to adit mining 
where tunnels were driven into the hillside. Early excavations were carried out with 
picks, hammers and wedges and, when the rock proved too hard for these, by "fire- 
setting" (North, 1962). Fires were lit against the face to be worked and while it was still 
hot cold water was thrown on. Expansion on heating and then rapid contraction on 
cooling caused fracturing of the rock face. This method was effective and continued in 
use in some areas even after the introduction of gunpowder for blasting in the late 17th 
century. 
Drainage was often a major problem in underground workings, particularly in NE Wales, 
and prevented operation of many potentially good mines (Schnellmann, 1959; Lewis, 
1967). During the 17th- century the introduction of deep drainage levels, along with 
bellows for ventilation, were an important advancement in Welsh mining practices 
(North, 1962; Lewis, 1967). The introduction of gunpowder for blasting and the use of 
coal for smelting, instead of charcoal which was in short supply, also aided the growth of 
mining in the 18th century (Lewis, 1967). 
Once raised from the mine the ore minerals had to be separated from waste rock. In early 
days this was done by hand, often by women and children, but later machinery driven by 
water-wheels, or occasionally steam engines, were introduced. However, the principles of 
ore dressing remained the same. The ore was crushed and then placed in a "jig". This 
separated the heavier ore minerals from lighter waste material by the jerking action of a 
sieve in water (Lewis, 1967). The final cleaning of the ore was achieved on a "buddle" -a 
large, slightly inclined flat board over which a stream of water flowed carrying away 
unwanted grains of sphalerite and pyrite and leaving the heavier lead ore behind (Lewis, 
1967). 
Smelting of the dressed ore at first took place near the mines but by the 18th century local 
supplies of wood for charcoal were depleted and a technique using coal for smelting was 
developed (Lewis, 1967). Thus, the ore was shipped to smelting centres near the North 
and South Wales coalfields (Davies, 1987). Major smelting centres developed along the 
Dee Estuary and in the Swansea Valley (Richardson, 1974) and the latter area became 
important for smelting not only Welsh ore but large quantities of imported ores from 
abroad (Chadwick, 1981). 
Throughout its history the mining industry suffered from a series of booms and slumps in 
response to fluctuations in the price of lead. In later years the long-worked deposits were 
becoming exhausted. These problems were exacerbated by financial malpractices which 
were common and few mine operators were prepared to invest sufficient money to 
develop mines properly. Many potentially productive mines were ruined because bad 
mining practice left them unfit for any future exploitation. There was often underhand 
practice in sharedealings with promoters expending only a small part of the funds on 
mining and making easy profit from the rest (Lewis, 1967; Bick, 1974). 
The growth of mining during the 18th century, not only in Wales but also parts of 
England and Scotland, made Britain the major exporter of lead in the world until the 
Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). After the Wars mining in continental Europe, particularly 
Spain and Germany, developed rapidly while the British industry was slow to recover. 
There was a boom period in the 1850s and 60s but mine drainage remained a serious 
problem, especially in NE Wales. The price of lead dropped in the 1870s and then in the 
1880s large deposits were found at Broken Hill, Australia and Leadville, USA and the 
worldwide price of lead fell even further. Cheap imports from. Spain, Australia and 
America flooded the British market and the home industry declined. 
Up until the mid-19th century lead was the major metal sought in Wales. The zinc 
sulphide mineral, sphalerite, which was often found associated with the lead ore, was 
considered a waste product (Richardson, 1974). Calamine (zinc carbonate), from mines in 
North Wales, Scotland, the Mendips, Cornwall and the north of England, was the source 
of the zinc required for brass production up to this time. -The demand for zinc rose as zinc 
replaced copper as sheeting for roof building and "galvanisation", ie. zinc coating of iron, 
was patented in 1837 (Richardson, 1974). The main source of zinc from the 1850s 
onwards became sphalerite. Thus, while lead mining was in its final decline zinc 
production prolonged the life of many Welsh mines. 
The decline in Welsh metalliferous mining which began in 1870 continued, known 
reserves became exhausted, there was a lack of capital for exploration and development 
as investors lost faith in the home industry and the market was taken over by cheaper 
foreign imports. Most mining in Wales had ceased by the early 1920s. Some activity 
continued in the Halkyn-Minera district in NE Wales and at Parc Mine, near Llanrwst, 
until the late 1950s. Parc, the last operational mine, closed in 1959. 
Some exploration work was carried out in the 1960s and 70s and lead was extracted from 
abandoned tips at Pont-rhyd-y-groes in mid-Wales by Elenith Mining in the late 1970s 
but this was only a very small scale operation. 
Exploration and development work has been undertaken at Parys Mountain, on Anglesey, 
for lead, zinc and copper by Cominco during the 1970s and Imperial Metals Corporation 
in the 1980s but this has not led to commercial production as yet (Anon, 1988; Swallow, 
1990). 
Copper ore was much less abundant in Wales than lead and zinc but was locally 
important at Parys Mountain, Anglesey, in parts of Snowdonia, the Harlech dome and in 
minor amounts in association with lead-zinc vein mineralisation. 
As mentioned above the 
Romans mined copper in Anglesey and this was almost certainly worked earlier by the 
Ancient Britons during the Bronze Age (Timberlake, 1988; Richardson, 1974). After 
Roman times little copper mining seems to have been carried out until the second half of 
the 18th century. In 1768 a great lode was discovered at Parys which was so productive, 
averaging 3,000 tons of metal per year that, together with the output 
from nearby Mona 
Mine, Anglesey dominated world copper production from 1770-1790. Elsewhere in 
Wales copper production was only very small scale by comparison. Llandudno Mine on 
the Great Orme headland produced nearly 14,000 tons of ore between 1855 and 1869 
when flooding of the works by the sea forced its closure (North, 1962). Copper mining in 
Snowdonia was small scale and not particularly profitable. Records kept from the early 
1800s until 1913 suggest a total output from Snowdonia of around 64,000 tons of copper 
ore. These records are rather incomplete however, and Bick (1982) believes the actual 
total to be more than double this at -160,000 tons. The relative insignificance of this 
figure may be seen by comparison with Cornwall where annual output often exceeded 
this amount (Bick, 1982). 
The Welsh copper industry fell into decline for much the same reasons as the lead-zinc 
mines. Exhaustion of workings, lack of investment and a fall in price brought an end to 
copper mining in Snowdonia in 1913 (Bick, 1982). The mines on Anglesey were more 
prosperous due to the richness of the ore but almost all activity had ceased by the 
beginning of the 20th century. A recent assessment of the mining potential at Parys 
Mountain has been made with an exploratory development program which began in 1988 
(Swallow, 1990). 
An unusual copper deposit was worked north of Dolgellau, near Dolfrwynog. The so 
called "Turf Copper" mine, described by Henwood (1856), worked a deposit of copper 
impregnated peat. The peat was cut and burned, and the ash sent to Swansea for smelting. 
Ore production is estimated at 1767 tons (Archer, 1959; Morrison, 1975) during the 
period 1817-1847 but it is likely that production began prior to this and a total yield far 
higher than this is suggested by Hall (1975). 
Several other mines in the area north of Dolgellau were worked for copper, notably 
Clogau, Vigra and Glasdir but this area later became more important for its gold output. 
The mines are found in a belt, 1-5 km wide to the N and NW of the Afon Mawddach and 
its estuary, known as the Dolgellau Gold Belt (Andrew, 1910). Gold was first found at 
Cwm Heisian, a small lead mine, in 1843. The announcement of this find led to a gold 
rush in the area but most of the ventures were failures, partly due to the impersistence of 
the gold-bearing ore and partly from mismanagement. Mines which could have been 
profitable if worked on a small scale were equipped with expensive machinery for large 
scale workings which simply did not pay. However, a number of mines were successful, 
most notably Clogau and Gwynfynydd and a total of more than 130,000 oz gold were 
retrieved (Hall, 1975). Mining, even at the most successful mines, was intermittent but 
interest in the mines never completely died. Both Clogau and Gwynfynydd have been in 
operation in recent years but with little success. Gwynfynydd was abandoned in 1989 but 
there are currently plans to reopen the mine and a new discovery has also been made at 
Clogau this year (1992). 
Further details of metal mining in Wales may be found in North (1962) and Lewis (1967) 
who gives a comprehensive history. Detailed descriptions of individual mining districts 
may be found in Jones (1922), Bick (1974,1982,1985), Hall (1975), Morrison (1975), 
Jones and Moreton (1977), Foster-Smith (1978), Williams (1985) and Bennet and Vernon 
(1989,1990,1991). Information on mining practice is given by Rees (1969). Further 
details of the individual areas of interest in this study will be given in the relevant 
chapters. 
1.3: The environmental impact of metalliferous mining 
The practices of ore extraction and processing have had a dramatic effect on the 
environment. Unsightly dumps of waste material built up as mining progressed and the 
tip materials are often rich in sulphide minerals which, on weathering, break down to 
release metals such as Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, Cd, Hg etc. Some of these metals (eg. Cu and Zn) 
are essential elements for plant and animals but if taken in excess have an adverse effect 
on health (Crounse et al., 1983a). Other elements (eg. Cd, Pb, Hg) can be highly toxic, 
even at relatively low concentrations (Crounse et al., 1983b). Sulphide minerals in veins 
and tip material are also a potential source of acid mine drainage and, when rich in iron, 
may precipitate Fe-oxides and hydroxides known commonly as ochre (see Chapter 4). 
When the mines closed no attempts were made to reclaim the disturbed landscapes. Waste 
tips, rich in toxic metals and unsuitable for vegetation growth are today left as barren 
scars on the hillsides. 
Many of the metalliferous mines in Wales are located close to rivers in narrow, steepsided 
valleys in areas of mountainous terrain. The faults, with which mineralisation may be 
associated, form lines of weakness along which river valleys are easily eroded. Steep 
valley sides aided the practice of driving adits and drainage levels into the hillside, 
avoiding the necessity of elaborate pumping and winding gear. In addition water played 
an important role in the mining process and was drawn from local rivers. As described in 
the previous section it was used in jigs and buddies for ore dressing and was vital for 
driving waterwheels which powered machinery. 
The ore dressing methods used were very inefficient. Waste water, rich in dissolved 
metals and suspended solids was discharged directly into nearby streams. Treatment, if 
any, was ineffective, by simple gravity settling in tanks and was more likely intended for 
ore recovery than pollution prevention. 
The metal mining industry in Britain was unregulated for most of the mining period even 
though the toxic nature of lead was known (Davies, 1987). In the mid-19th century it was 
recognised by farmers in the Aberystwyth area that mining waste was causing the death 
of stock and failure of crops on river flood plains (Griffith, 1919). An enquiry by the 
Rivers Pollution Commissioners reported on the wastefulness and inefficiency of lead 
mining practice (Frankland and Morton, 1873). So ineffective were the ore dressing and 
smelting processes that Davies (1980) estimates for every ton of silver-free lead produced 
as much as 2 tons may have been lost to the environment. The Rivers Pollution 
Prevention Act passed into law in 1876 when mining was in decline and much of the 
environmental damage had been done. 
The impact of mining on the environment is not restricted to the mine sites themselves. 
Dispersal of metals from a mine site may occur by gravitational transport from tailings 
dumps, contaminating land downslope or the windblown transport of fine tailings 
material (Davies, 1987) but by far the most important and far reaching mode of dispersal 
is fluvial transportation. Heavy metal contaminants may be carried great distances by 
rivers, in solution or fine suspension. A decrease in flow rate may cause deposition of 
solid material from suspension or changes in the chemical environment may lead to 
precipitation or adsorption of metals, causing contamination of stream sediments. 
Contamination of alluvial soils may occur during flooding. 
1.4: The study of metals in the environment 
Soils 
Heavy metal contamination of soils in Wales was first reported by Griffith (1919) who 
attributed soil infertility in mining areas to lead pollution. Later work has identified 
anomalous levels of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ag and Hg in alluvial soils (Davies, 1968,1976; 
Alloway and Davies, 1971) and related patterns of contamination to the composition of 
local ores (Alloway and Davies, 1971). In mid-Wales, the Conwy Valley and NE Wales 
lead and zinc were the main metals mined and thus are the major contaminants. 
Cadmium, found in trace amounts in sphalerite, is also found as is silver (from galena) 
which was once of major importance in the Pb mines of mid-Wales. These areas were not 
major Cu producers and few, or only relatively small anomalies of Cu -in soils are 
reported. However, significant Cu contamination is reported in the vicinity of Cu mines 
on Anglesey (Alloway and Davies, 1971). Soil contamination was found to be greatest in 
older soils corresponding with the peak period of mining activity. 
Pollution of alluvial soils was caused mainly during the peak of mining activities as a 
result of flooding with water contaminated by mining waste. This has been illustrated in a 
cross sectional study of the Ystwyth Valley (Alloway and Davies, 1971). The data show 
that the metal content of soils decreases with increasing distance from the river channel. 
Contamination may also occur by the gravitational transport of material from spoil heaps 
upslope or by the windblown dispersal of fine-grained tip material (Davies, 1987). 
Other studies in Wales reporting heavy metal contamination of soils may be found in the 
literature, for example: - Davies and Roberts (1975,1978), Jones et al. (1983), Paveley 
(1988), Fuge et al. (1989,1993a) and elsewhere in Britain eg.: - Davies (1976), Davies 
and White (1981), Macklin (1985), Lewin and Macklin (1986). . 
Stream sediments 
In the Ystwyth valley stream sediments from the active channel and from former channels 
(in abandoned meanders) have been examined (Davies and Lewin, 1974; Lewin et al., 
1977). Lead and Zn contamination was found to be greatest in former channels which 
were active post-1800, corresponding with the peak in mining activity. Currently active 
channels are much "cleaner" but by no means free from contamination (Lewin et al., 
1977). Metals are still input from abandoned tips and, in addition, the contaminated 
floodplain sediments act as a reservoir, of metals and are a major source of pollution 
(Davies and Lewin, 1974; Lewin et al., 1977; Wolfenden and Lewin, 1977). 
The Wolfson Geochemical Atlas (Webb et al., 1978) highlights anomalous heavy metal 
concentrations in stream sediments in most of the former metal mining areas of Wales 
(eg. NE Wales, mid-Wales, Snowdonia). Further reports of contaminated stream 
sediments are given for rivers in mid-Wales (Bradley and Lewin, 1982; Lewin and 
Macklin, 1986; Evans, 1991), the Tanat Valley in the Berwyn Dome (Fuge et al., 1989), 
the Conwy Valley (Elderfield et al., 1971), North Wales (Nichol et al., 1970) and the 
Afon Mawddach (Fuge et al., 1992a). 
River waters 
By far the most important cause for concern in the study of the environmental impact of 
former metal mines is the contamination of waters. This is an ongoing problem and the 
fluvial dispersal of metals from mine sites may have far reaching effects. 
Some of the earliest studies on the effects of metalliferous mining on the environment 
were carried out on the rivers of mid-Wales by Carpenter (1924,1926) at the University 
College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Subsequent changes in the rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol 
are well documented by a series of workers at Aberystwyth (eg. Laurie and Jones, 1938; 
Newton, 1944; Jones, 1949,1958; Fuge et al., 1991) and provide one of the most 
important case studies on heavy metal contamination of the freshwater environment. 
The early studies were mainly concerned with the effects of heavy metals on the biota of 
contaminated rivers. When Carpenter began her research mining in mid-Wales was in the 
final stages of decline, a few lead mines were still operational while others had recently 
closed. Her findings clearly showed a reduction in species diversity and abundance in 
both flora and fauna in rivers below mining areas and improvements in water quality after 
closure of the mines (Carpenter, 1924,1926). The Afon Ystwyth was the worst affected; 
in 1919 the lower reaches contained 0.4 mgL-1 Pb and the fauna was restricted to 9 
species, mostly invertebrates. By 1922 the Pb concentration was <0.1 mgL-1 and the 
number of species had risen to 26 (Carpenter, 1924). Methods for the analysis of Zn were 
not available at the time of Carpenter's research and she attributed the toxic effects on the 
biota to lead in the water. Later studies in the area showed zinc to be the main 
contaminant metal (Jones, 1940). Jones (1940) reported 63 species present in the 
A. Ystwyth in 1939 with Pb concentrations <0.05 mgL'1 and up to 1.2 mgL-1 Zn. By 
1975 fish had returned to most of the river (Davies, 1987). Recent analyses by Fuge et al., 
(1991) from the lower reaches of the A. Ystwyth (7.5 km below mine area) show Pb and 
Zn concentrations of 58 pgL-1 and 168 gL-1 respectively. Lead levels appear little 
improved since the 1940s and Zn contamination is still significant when compared with 
background concentrations of 68-77 tgL-1 Zn found above the mining area (which is still 
contaminated by former mining activity in the headwaters). 
The Afon Rheidol recovered more quickly than the Ystwyth after mining ceased (Jones 
and Howells, 1973). Mines in the area were worked during the First World War and the 
benthos was restricted to 14 invertebrate species and average Pb concentrations of 0.2-0.5 
mgL-1 were found in the lower reaches of the river (Carpenter, . 1924). After closure of 
the last mine in 1921 Pb concentrations soon dropped to -0.02 mgL-1, although higher 
levels were found during floods (Carpenter, 1924). The number of species had increased 
to 29 (Carpenter, 1924). James et al. (1932) recorded Pb levels of 0.02-0.17 mgL-1 and 
Zn at 0.3 mgL-1 and Laurie and Jones (1938) reported further improvements and found 
103 species, including some fish. 10 years later 190 species were reported (Jones, 1949). 
Restocking of the Rheidol with salmon in the 1950s and 60s by the Angling Association 
and the River Board boosted the stock in the recovering river to make the Rheidol 
comparable with other salmon rivers in SW Wales (Jones and Howells, 1973). 
Comparison of recent analytical data with the older records should only be made with 
caution as analytical methods have changed a great deal during the last 2 decades. More 
recent analyses of drainage waters from former metal mining areas in Wales are given by 
Abdullah and Royle (1972), Elderfield et al. (1971), Fuge (1972), Willis (1985), Fuge et 
al. (1991,1993a) and Walton and Johnson (1992). Some of these data are summarised in 
Tables 1.2 and 1.3. 
Studies of rivers in metal mining areas elsewhere support the findings in mid-Wales. In a 
tributary of the South Esk River, Tasmania, Australia, in an area of tin and tungsten 
mining Tyler and Buckney (1973) reported concentrations of 150 gL'1 Cu, 9,200 tgL"1 
Zn and 130 gL'1 Cd. A depleted fauna was found in the river with a complete absence 
of crustaceans, annelids (worms and leeches) and molluscs (Thorp and Lake, 1973). The 
Molongo River in the Captains Flat mining district of New South Wales, Australia, has 
also suffered serious pollution problems. Zinc concentrations of 34.1 mgL-1 are reported 
and a depleted invertebrate fauna of only 5 species were found below the mine, cf. 30 
species above the mine (Weatherley et al., 1967). Work to stabilise the spoil heaps 
reduced the total Zn to 25.3 mgL-1 but produced only slight improvement in the fauna 
(Norris, 1986). 
Many other biological studies on the effects of heavy metal contamination have been 
made and report a reduction in species diversity and abundance or a decline in general 
ecological fitness as the concentration of metal contaminants increases. For example, in 
Wales: - Elderfield et al. (1971), Jones and MacLean 
(1975), Burton and Peterson (1979), 
Willis (1983,1985), Jones et al. (1985); and elsewhere in Britain: - Brown (1977), 
Armitage (1980), Whitton and Diaz (1980), Abel and Green (1981), Burrows and 
Whitton (1983), Armitage and Blackburn (1985). Further details of metal toxicity on the 
biota may be found in the above references and in Kelly (1991). 
Studies on the hydrological and geochemical factors controlling the concentration of 
metals in river systems are extremely important in understanding the sources, pathways 
and final fate of contaminant metals in the environment. Factors such as the mode of 
transport (eg. as dissolved metal salts or suspended solids), solubility, geochemical 
conditions (eg. pH, Eh) and flow regime all influence the metal content of rivers 
(Grimshaw et al., 1976; Elderfield et al., 1979; Johnson and Eaton, 1980; Bradley and 
Lewin, 1982; Bradley, 1984; Johnson, 1984,1986; Johnson and Thornton, 1987; Fuge et 
al., 1993a, 1993b). The importance of iron oxidising bacteria in acid mine drainage has 
also been discussed by Walton and Johnson (1992). The geochemistry of river waters 
cannot be discussed without consideration of the above factors and they will therefore be 
described in further detail in the following chapter. 
1.5: The present thesis 
Previous studies of river water geochemistry in former metalliferous mining areas of 
Wales have concentrated mainly on mid-Wales (Newton, 1944; Fuge, 1972; Fuge et al., 
1991) with a few data from the Conwy Valley area (Elderfield et al., 1971,1979; Willis, 
1985) and limited analyses from several other rivers in Wales (Abdullah and Royle, 1972; 
Evans et al., "1981). Comparison of waters from different areas and the influence of 
variations in geology on river chemistry have not been made.

CHAPTER 2: WATER GEOCHEMISTRY 
2.1: Introduction 
Water is an extremely important environmental medium. It is a principle agent in the 
weathering of the continents and in the transportation of eroded material to the oceans. 
Water is essential to all forms of life as it forms a major component in living cells. 
Essential nutrients, eg. Ca, Mg, Na and trace levels of several elements such as Fe, Mn, 
Cu, Zn, I, (Thornton, 1983; Crounse et al., 1983a) may be found in water in forms 
available to plants and animals and thus enter the food chain. In addition to the provision 
of essential elements for life, water may also contain harmful substances which can enter 
the food chain and have an adverse effect on plant and animal health as discussed in 
Chapter 1.3. 
Water geochemistry examines only part of a whole system of environmental geochemical 
processes involving complex interactions between rock, soil, water, air and biota which 
make water chemistry, and in particular that of river waters, extremely variable. The 
following sections discuss the complex factors which interact and influence the chemistry 
and variability of surface runoff. 
2.2: Mobility of metals in river water 
The metal concentrations found in river water are strongly influenced, not only by the 
availability of elements (by weathering of rocks or atmospheric inputs), but also by 
element mobility ie. the ease with which they may move in the river environment. 
Mobility is controlled by complex interactions of factors such as solubility, 
environmental conditions (pH, Eh, geochemistry of country rocks, etc. ), precipitation and 
adsorption reactions and the formation of complex ions. 
Ionic potential 
According to Goldschmidt (1937) an approximate guide to element mobility is given by 
their ionic potentials. Ionic potential is a ratio of the ionic charge (Z), in valence units, to 
the ionic radius (r) (Fig. 2.1). Elements with low ionic potential (Z/r<3.0) tend to be 
soluble as simple cations (eg. Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+). Those with high ionic potential 
(Z/r>12) tend to attract oxygens and form very soluble complex anions (eg. P043', 
SO42-). Elements with intermediate ionic potentials (3.0<Z/r<12) are generally insoluble 
and therefore immobile. Ionic potential is a useful rough guide to the behaviour of certain 
elements eg. Fe and Mn which are mobile as divalent ions (Fe2+ and Mn2+) but are 
immobile in the forms Fe3+ and Mn4+. However, important factors such as pH, Eh and 
complex formation (see below) are not taken into account. 
Solubility 
The solubility of a substance may be expressed as the mass of the substance contained in 
a solution in equilibrium with an excess of the substance, ie. in a saturated solution. 
Values for solubility of many elements and their compounds are given in published tables 
(eg. Weast, 1988-89). 
A commonly used measure of solubility is the solubility product. This is the product of 
the activities, (a) of the ions in a saturated solution of the substance. For example, for the 
reaction: 
PbS04(solid) a Pb2+ + S042 
solubility product =K= aPb2+. aSO42' = 1.82x10'8 
aPbS04(solid) 
At equilibrium PbSO4(solid) = 1, as this excess solid in effect does not participate in the 
reaction. K is determined experimentally by dissolving material in solution until 
saturation is reached, or calculated from thermodynamic data. Values for solubility 
products are given in published tables eg. Krauskopf (1979, Table VVI-I), Weast (1988- 
In saline solutions the concentration of a dissolved ionic species which can participate in 
chemical reactions (the "active concentration" or "activity") is generally less than the total 
concentration. The two concentrations (total and active) can be related to each other 
through a coefficient which is temperature and pressure dependent - the activity 
coefficient (7): 
ai = 'Yimi 
where ai is the activity of an ion i in a solution, 7i is the activity coefficient of ion i, and 
mi is the concentration in molL-1 of ion i in the solution. 'yi is a number so ai is in units of 
molL-1.7 can be calculated from the Debye-Huckle relationship (Krauskopf, 1979) but in 
very dilute solutions, such as river waters, can be assumed to be close to 1. 
Therefore it can be assumed that 
aPb2+ = [Pb2+] (=concentration of Pb2+) 
aSO42- = [S042-] 
and as such, with 'y for each =1

aPb2+ = aSO42- 
therefore aPb2+ _ [Pb2+] = 4K 
_ 41.82x10'8 
= 1.35x10'4 mo1L'1 
= 27.9 mgL-1 
and from this the maximum amount of PbSO4 which will dissolve in pure water can be 
calculated from 
4K(PbS04) _'1.82x10'8 mo1L-1 
= 40.9 mgL-1 
The above discussion considers solutions containing only a single salt (eg. PbSO4), 
whereas natural waters contain many dissolved salts. 
If the solubility of Pb2+ is considered in a solution containing 30 tgL-1 S04 from the 
dissolution of a sulphate mineral (such as, gypsum, CaSO4.2H20, or Fe-sulphate), the 
maximum solubility of Pb can be calculated as follows: 
K(PbS04) = aPb2+. aSO42- = 1.82x10-8 
aPbS04(solid) 
aPbSO4(solid) =1 
Thus, aPb2+ = 1.82x10-8 = 6x10-5 
3x10- 
=12.6 mgL-1 
which is approximately half of the maximum solubility of 27.9 mgL-1 in pure water, from 
above. Clearly, the addition of S04 causes precipitation of PbSO4, thus lowering the 
amount of Pb2+ which can be held in solution. This is known as the common ion effect. 
Solubilty products consider reactions' where molecules ionize on dissolving in water. 
However, this may not always be the case. For example, considering the solubility 
product of CdS: 
K(CdS) = 1.4 x10-29 
Therefore, theoretically the maximum amount of CdS which will dissolve in pure water is 
calculated as follows: 
JK(CdS) _ 41.4 x 10-29 
= 3.7 x10'15 mo1L-1 
=5.4x10-i0 mgL-1 
whereas the actual solubility as the mass of CdS in a saturated solution is 1.3 mgL' 1 
(Weast, 1988-89). This suggests the solution contains CdS as a molecule in solution with 
insignificant dissociation to Cd and S ions. This type of molecular solubility may thus be 
very important in the weathering of sulphide minerals. 
The values quoted for solubility and solubility product consider only very simple 
reactions between a substance and pure water. In reality the reactions occurring in a 
natural body of water are the result of complex interactions of the various constituents 
and are influenced by the chemical conditions. These are discussed individually below. 
pH and Eh 
pH is one of the most important factors governing the solubility of elements in the 
aqueous environment. Some elements (eg. Na, K, Ca, Mg, Sr, N, Cl) are very soluble 
throughout the range of pH found in the natural environment but many metals are soluble 
in acid conditions and tend to precipitate as hydroxides and oxides with increasing pH. 
The pH at which precipitation occurs is known as the pH of hydrolysis and is dependent 
on the concentration of the metal ion present (Levinson, 1980) but in most riverine 
environments fairly low metal ion concentrations may be expected. Table 2.1 shows 
values of pH of hydrolysis for selected metal ions. 
Variations in the pH of hydrolysis result in differing mobilities of metal ions. In the 
vicinity of an oxidising sulphide vein very low pH levels may occur due to the breakdown 
of pyrite (see Chapter 4.3). Many metals will be soluble in such acid environments. The 
precipitation of ferric hydroxides is often associated with acid mine drainage (Kelly, 
1991) and Hem (1970) has shown that the oxidation of ferrous iron can reduce pH. 
Further away from the oxidising sulphides pH values may increase, for example, by 
dilution with higher pH river or groundwater or by reaction with the surrounding rocks. 
Thus precipitation by hydrolysis of different ions occurs at varying pH values and 
produces different dispersal patterns for each ion. For example, Zn2+ may be carried 
great distances without the pH of hydrolysis being exceeded but Fe3+ is unlikely to be 
carried very far in solution, except in extremely acid (pH<2.0) conditions. 
The pH of an environment is also very important in controlling the availability of 
elements to plants and animals and thus influences the biological impact of heavy metal 
pollution.

0.0025M) solutions (from Britton, 1955)

--------------------------------------------------------- 
Eh is a measure of the oxidising or reducing potential of a system. This is important as 
many elements occur in more than one valence state and this can affect the solubility of 
their ions (see Ionic potential). For example, the singly charged Cu+ occurs in reducing 
environments and is very insoluble but in oxidising conditions Cu2+, predominates and 
solubility is increased. Reduced Fe2+ and Mn2+ (Fig. 2.1) are soluble but when oxidised 
to Fe3+ and Mn4+ they precipitate as hydroxides and oxides, dramatically reducing their 
mobility. Fe3+ precipitates to produce the orange "ochre" deposits often associated with 
acid mine drainage on emergence from a mine to the oxidising, surface environment. Mn 
and sometimes Al precipitates are also commonly produced in this way. 
Eh and pH thus act together in influencing aqueous chemical reactions and their 
relationship is often represented by Eh-pH diagrams. In Fig. 2.2 the Eh-pH conditions of 
commonly occurring natural environments are shown. The upper and lower slanting lines 
delimit the stability field of H2O and the pH range 4.0-9.0 is taken as the normal range of 
natural waters although values lower than this are common in the vicinity of sulphide 
minerals which are being oxidised. 
The stability fields of mineral species under varying conditions may also be described and 
explained in this way. An example showing the stability ranges of selected Cu species is 
given in Fig. 2.3. Many further examples are given by Garrels and Christ (1965). 
Table 2.2 shows the relative mobilities of elements in the secondary environment 
classified by Andrews-Jones (1968) based upon Eh and pH. This classification is a very 
useful guide to relative element mobilities but cannot be applicable in every case due to 
the numerous variables involved in element mobility. 
Adsorption and precipitation reactions 
Adsorption and ion exchange processes on to colloidal particles have a major control on 
the mobility of metals in the secondary environment Rose et al. (1979). Common 
examples are Fe and Mn oxides and hydroxides, organic matter and clays. Colloids have 
diameters in the range 10-9-10-6m providing a large surface area with high surface 
charge for adsorption. Colloids may thus increase the mobility of metals, transporting 
them at higher concentrations than would be predicted from their solubilities (Plant and 
Raiswell, 1983). Conversely, the flocculation of colloids may remove metals from 
solution thus limiting mobility. The precipitation of oxides and hydroxides of Fe, Mn and 
Al may also "scavenge" other metals from solution by coprecipitation or adsorption 
(Burke, 1970; Rose and Suhr, 1971; Levinson, 1980; Johnson, 1986). 
Complex formation 
The mobility of metals is strongly influenced by the formation of complex ions by 
reaction with anions in solution. The resulting complex ions may be insoluble and thus 
precipitate out or they may be more soluble than the original metal ion and thus increase 
mobility. For example, Mo4+ and Mo6+ are shown as immobile on the graph of ionic 
potential (Fig. 2.1). However, MoO42- is a soluble complex and its occurrence increases 
Mo mobility, whilst the formation of relatively insoluble HMoO4 reduces mobility. 
Complex formation may also occur with other metal ions in solution, eg. the presence of 
Pb in solution is likely to cause precipitation of PbMoO4 (Levinson, 1980). 
2.3: Source of water 
Rain is the principle source of water on the land surface and contains variable quantities 
of atmospheric gases, dissolved and particulate mineral matter. Rainwater, in equilibrium 
with atmospheric carbon dioxide, is always slightly acidic (pH=5.7) due to the formation 
of carbonic acid by the reaction 
C02(gas) + H20(solution) r> H2C03(solution). 
This is important in many chemical weathering processes. 
The acidity of rainwater in industrial areas may be increased by the dissolution of 
atmospheric pollutants, the chief acidifiers in the western hemisphere being S and N 
species. Donald and Stoner (1989) reported deposition of acid (pH<4.2) rainfall in Wales, 
from air masses originating from the south and east, which had passed over industrial 
areas, and non-acid (pH>6.0) events from air masses coming from the Atlantic. Thus the 
quality of rainwater is variable and dependent on the origin and history of the airmass 
from which it falls along with other factors such as the amount of antecedent rainfall, 
windspeed and direction. Depositional quality is also variable within a single rainfall 
event due to washout of aerosols from the atmosphere and changing meteorological 
conditions (Hyett, 1990). 
In maritime areas, like Wales, sea salt may be a significant component in rainfall 
(Reynolds, 1983). The role of sea salts in acidification of upland streams has been 
described by Seip, (1980), Reuss, (1983), Reuss and Johnson, (1985), Whitehead and 
Neal, (1987) and Langan, (1986,1987,1989). Langan (1989) suggests a process of ion 
exchange between Na+ (from NaCl in sea spray) and H+ on organic particle surfaces in

the peaty upper soil horizons as a mechanism for generating stream water acidity even 
when the input is not acidic. 
Hyett (1990) gives evidence for another possible factor in the generation of stream water 
acidity in upland Wales. He showed that some low pH rainfall episodes were associated 
with relatively low total solute concentrations and therefore suggested that acidity during 
these events was due to a deficit of base components rather than high levels of acidifiers. 
2.4: Pathways 
Rainwater has a relatively low content of dissolved solids. As it percolates through soil 
and rock it reacts chemically and physically with mineral constituents, leaching out 
soluble fractions and picking up colloidal and fine particulate material. The pathway this 
water follows en route to a river system has a significant influence on the chemical 
changes which it undergoes. This has been the subject of much recent interest, 
particularly with reference to the fate of acidic deposition and the acidification of upland 
streams (Reynolds et al., 1983; Stoner and Gee, 1985 Hornung et al., 1985,1986; 
Whitehead et al., 1986; Cresser and Edwards, 1987; Murdoch et al., 1987). Much of this 
research has concentrated on acid deposition in upland Wales in the Plynlimon and Llyn 
Brianne areas (Stoner and Gee, 1985; Hornung et al., 1986; Neal et al., 1986; Edwards et 
al., 1990). 
Rainfall's first interaction, after impact, is usually with a vegetation layer. This can 
modify the water chemistry in a number of ways: 
(i) Dry or occult deposition which accumulates 
on the surface (especially during dry 
periods) may be washed off by ensuing rainfall, increasing solute concentrations 
and having a tendency to increase acidity. The volume of additional inputs 
increases, depending on the type of vegetation cover, in the order 
grassland/moorland < deciduous woodland < coniferous forest (Hornung et al., 
1990b). 
(ii) Interception of rainfall and evapo-transpirational losses from the vegetation layer, 
again increases acidity. This is most pronounced in areas of coniferous plantations 
(Newson, 1979; Miller and Miller, 1983). 
(iii) Absorption of material from solution through the foliage eg. ammonium ions, 
(Miller, 1985) or by organisms living in the vegetation. 
(iv) Release of H+ through tree roots into the soil (Miller, 1985). 
(v) Dense tree cover modifies the soil conditions beneath. Drier conditions and the 
accumulation of leaf-litter may lead to an increase in sulphate and humic acids 
(Hornung et al., 1990b). 
Following impact with the land surface the pathway of the water to the river system may 
be as surface runoff, throughflow within the upper soil horizons or as deeper groundwater 
flow. Mineral - water interactions produce 
dissolution of major and trace elements 
(Garrels and Mackenzie, 1967) by the reaction of H+ ions causing dissolution of 
carbonates and hydrolysis of silicate minerals. 
Eg. CaC03(calcite) + H+ r* Ca2+ + HCO3 
2KA1Si3O8 + 2H+ + 9H20 p A12Si2O5(OH)4 + 2K+ + 4H4SiO4 
orthoclase kaolinite 
Thus, acid solutions passing through soils may be neutralised by the exchange of H+ ions 
for basic cations (eg. Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) giving alkaline (OH)-bearing solutions 
(Krauskopf, 1979). The buffering capacity of a body of water is governed by its 
alkalinity. For the purposes of this study alkalinity measurements were not made but the 
concentrations of Ca and Mg in solution are taken as a reflection of *the buffering 
capacity. The pathway of the water through the soil profile, hence the degree of 
percolation and residence time affects the degree to which this buffering may occur, as 
does the chemistry of the parent rock type (Kinniburgh and Edmunds, 1986; Hornung et 
al., 1990a). Carbonate rocks such as limestone or dolomite are rich in Ca and Mg' and 
therefore have a high buffering capacity whereas base-poor rocks such as granites, 
sandstones and slates have very little or no buffering capacity. 
The local geology also has a direct influence in determining the trace elements available 
for dissolution. For example, high Ag, As, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn may be leached from 
organic-rich black shales, high Ni and Cr from basic or ultrabasic igneous intrusions and 
Pb, Zn, Cu, As, Cd etc. from localised areas of mineralisation. The texture of rocks, 
including grainsize, porosity and permeability, as well as the chemical composition, 
affects their susceptibility to weathering. Fine grained material has a greater grain surface 
area available to chemical attack than coarser grained rocks, and porosity and 
permeability control the volume of penetrating water. Certain rock types are more prone 
to chemical attack than others eg. carbonates which are easily dissolved by acidic waters. 
2.5: Mode of transport 
Rivers may transport material as (i) bed load, (ii) suspended load and (iii) in solution 
(Levinson, 1980). The bed load is the heaviest fraction and is carried along by rolling, 
pushing or saltation. Rock and mineral fragments may be transported great distances in 
this way, particularly during times of flood. The suspended load consists of fine clay 
particles and colloids (1-0.001 m) light enough to be carried by the flow of the river. 
This fraction in suspension can be important in the transport of metals in the form of 
precipitated colloids (eg. Fe-, Al- and Mn-oxides and hydroxides) or metal species 
adsorbed on colloids or clay particles (see Section 2.2). Elements in solution may occur 
as simple cations (eg. Zn2+, Co2+), anions (eg. SO42-), complex ions (eg. U02 2+), 
undissociated inorganic solutes (eg. H4SiO4) and soluble metal-organic complexes. 
The speciation of trace metals, rather than "total" metal concentrations in the aquatic 
environment is of most importance in studies of their environmental impact on the biota 
(Kelly, 1991). For example, Al is considered to be most damaging ecologically when 
found in solution as free aluminium and inorganic complexes (such as fluoride, hydroxide 
and sulphate) and less toxic when organically complexed (Driscoll et al., 1980, Baker and 
Schofield, 1982). Often a simple distinction is made between "filterable" and 
"particulate" fractions by passing water samples through a filter, most commonly of pore 
size 0.45 m. The filterable fraction contains elements in true solution but may also 
contain suspended colloidal particles. Thus, filtration is not a true distinction between 
"dissolved" and "particulate" species but it is still the easiest and therefore most widely 
used technique. 
The mode of transport of metals within a river is dependent on the chemical and physical 
conditions of the environments such as Eh, pH etc. as described in Section 2.2 but is also 
influenced by changes in the flow regime which will be discussed further in the following 
section. 
2.6: Flow variations 
Variations in the volume of water discharged and flow velocities have a direct influence 
on the total amount of solid material transported by a river, eg. greater discharges and 
higher flow velocities are capable of transporting larger sediment loads. At lower flows 
part of the suspended load is deposited on the river bed. Flow variations are largely a 
result of topography and climatic conditions (predominantly rainfall but temperature, 
evaporation and transpiration will also have an effect). 
For the purpose of this study flow measurements were not made but seasonal variations in 
river water geochemistry were compared with rainfall inputs in each study area. The 
relationship between rainfall and flow is' complicated by variable catchment 
characteristics such as relief, soil type, antecedent weather conditions, the pathway of 
water to the river, vegetaion, land use etc. Fig. 2.4. shows examples of hydrograph records 
and rainfall totals from upland areas of SW Scotland (Howells and 
Brown, 1987; Welsh 
and Burns, 1987) and from a mining area in SW England (Johnson and 
Thornton, 1987). 
Response times over a short period (a few hours or days, Fig. 2.4. A) are variable 
' but 
longer term (monthly) patterns (Fig. 2.4. B) show a good correlation between rainfall and 
flow. Examples from Wales of peak flow and total rainfall during storm events (Boorman, 
1985) are illustrated in Fig. 2.5. Thes also show a good, postive correlation between 
rainfall and flow. 
During dry periods when there is little surface runoff river water is dominated, by 
groundwater or "baseflow" inputs. The chemistry of rivers during such low-flow periods 
is relatively stable (Rose et al., 1979; Levinson, 1980). An increase in surface, runoff 
following rainfall may affect river water chemistry in two ways, (i) dilution of the 
baseflow with surface runoff which has had little soil interaction and is therefore 
relatively low in solid material and/or (ii) "flushing out" of accumulated materials from 
near-surface soil horizons. These effects, as a response to storm events, have been 
described for the major element chemistry of rivers (Edwards, 1973; Glover and 
Johnson, 1974; Walling and Foster, 1975) and in the behaviour of heavy, metals 
(Grimshaw et al., 1976). A time lapse often occurs between the flushing peal: or 
maximum dilution effect and the peak in discharge following the onset of rain. This has 
been termed the "lag effect" (Glover and Johnson, 1974; Grimshaw et at., 1976). 
It is clear that the pathways between rainfall input and flow in the river channel, rates of . 
element dissolution along these pathways and the mode by which metals are 
transported are all significant in the response of metal concentrations in a river to changes 
in flow. 
Longer term, seasonal variations in response to flow have been described by various 
authors. Many report dilution effects with increasing runoff (Livingstone, . 
1963; 
Levinson, 1980; Sanden et al., 1987) but this simple relationship is not always the case. 
For example, Boyden et al. (1979), Johnson (1984) and Johnson and Thornton (1987) 
record increases in trace metal concentrations with increasing rainfall in winter months 
due to increases in weathering and the proportion of infiltrating surface waters. Increasing 
metal concentrations during periods of high flow have been attributed to increases in

particulate metals while the dissolved concentrations remain fairly constant (Yeats and 
Bewers, 1982). The role of particulate material in the transport of metals in rivers is 
clearly an important one and has been discussed by many other authors (eg. Jenne, 1968; 
Gibbs, 1973; Wolfenden and Lewin, 1977; Grieve and Fletcher, 1977; Bradley and 
Lewin, 1982; Jones, 1986; Johnson, 1986; Leenaers, 1989; Evans, 1991). 
2.7: Anthropogenic influences 
Anthropogenic influences may have a great impact locally on water geochemistry. For 
example, the extractive industries of mineral and coal mining produce large volumes of 
waste material rich in heavy metals and sulphides. This greatly increases the surface area 
prone to oxidation and is likely to cause increased acidity and metal concentrations in 
local river systems. Industrial and sewage effluents are discharged into rivers, agricultural 
fertilisers and pesticides are washed from fields into river and groundwater systems as are 
seepages from waste disposal sites. Fossil fuel combustion and emissions from the 
smelting and chemical industries pollute the atmosphere and thus may indirectly add to 
river pollution by the production of polluted rainfall, eg. sulphur emissions producing 
acid rain. 
2.8: Summary 
Table 2.3 gives examples of the major and trace element content of rivers worldwide. 
However, the diversity of environmental factors influencing river water chemistry listed 
in the preceding sections makes the establishment of "typical" river water chemistries 
extremely difficult. Also, when comparing data from the literature, account must be taken 
of the variable quality of analyses (Livingstone, 1963). Generally, long term 
investigations (more than 1 year) are necessary to examine the effects of seasonal changes 
and varying discharge. Consideration must also be made of discrimination between 
dissolved, colloidal and suspended materials and of sampling and analytical methods (see 
Chapter 3). 
BLANK IN ORIGINAL 
CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY 
3.1: INTRODUCTION 
Many methods of geochemical analysis require the preparation of samples as a solution. 
In this respect the analysis of river water, already a dilute solution, is potentially straight 
forward. However, the low concentrations of many elements present in most natural 
water samples poses analytical problems with the necessity for low detection limits. In 
addition the low concentrations can lead easily to the possibility of contamination during 
sample collection, preparation and analysis. 
Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) has been most commonly used for the direct 
analysis of the major elements (eg. Ca, Mg) in waters (Levinson, 1980). However, the 
concentrations of most trace elements (eg. Pb, Cu, Zn), except in the most contaminated 
mine drainage waters, are usually below detection limits of routine flame AAS. Graphite 
Furnace (GF)-AAS improves the sensitivity for AAS so that it is suitable for trace 
element analysis but is time consuming and usually only a single element may be 
analysed at a time on each sample although promising developments have been made for 
the determination of up to 4 elements using GF-AAS-Zeeman corrected instrumentation 
(Viets and O'Leary, 1992). Neutron activation analysis has sufficiently low detection 
limits for trace elements in water but, like GF-AAS is relatively slow and is also 
expensive and requires specialist techniques making it impractical for the routine analysis 
of large numbers of samples. In recent years inductively coupled plasma - atomic 
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) has been used for routine water analyses (Thompson 
and Walsh, 1989). Although this multi-element technique is more sensitive than many 
earlier methods preconcentration of natural waters is still necessary for elements other 
than Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Fe, B, S and Si (Thompson and Walsh, 1989). Inductively 
coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is, like ICP-AES, a multi-elemental 
technique but has detection limits 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than ICP-AES 
(Thompson and Walsh, 1989; McLaren, 1992) and suffers less problems with 
interferences (Houk, 1986). Thus ICP-MS is considered by many to be the ideal 
technique for the analysis of natural waters (Henshaw et al., 1989; McLaren, 1992). 
In May 1989 the Institute of Earth Studies in Aberystwyth acquired a VG Elemental 
PlasmaQuad 2+ ICP-MS and one of its first applications was in this study of river water 
chemistry in former metalliferous mining areas of Wales. The sensitivity and ease of 
rapid analysis by ICP-MS offered the opportunity to look at large numbers of samples 
with low concentrations of elements in solution on a scale not previously possible. This 
enabled the comparison of river water chemistries from several different areas with 
monthly sampling to study seasonal variations. 
ICP-MS was used to acquire the majority of the data for this study. The early part of the 
research involved the setting up and calibration of the new instrument at Aberystyth for 
routine water analysis. ICP-MS is a relatively new technique which has not, to date been 
used routinely in many geochemical applications (see below). It is therefore discussed 
below in some detail. 
3.2: ANALYSIS BY ICI'-1IS 
3.2.1: Introduction 
ICP-MS is a relatively new and powerful analytical method. It is sensitive (detection 
limits at sub-parts-per-billion level for many elements), rapid, linear over at least 6 orders 
of magnitude and has many applications (see Section 3.2.3). In summary, the technique 
uses an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source into which an analyte is sprayed to 
generate ions of the elements present. These ions are extracted from the atmospheric 
pressure plasma into a quadrupole mass spectrometer maintained under a high vacuum 
and are counted by an ion detector. The technique employed in the VG Elemental 
PlasmaQuad for interfacing an ICP source to a mass spectrometer was first developed by 
Dr. Alan Gray, advanced by Drs. Alan Gray and Alan Date and was introduced 
commercially in 1983. Details of the history and development of ICP-MS are given by 
Gray (1985,1986), Houk (1986), Houk and Thompson (1988), Jarvis et al. (1992) and 
references cited therein. 
The component parts of a VG PlasmaQuad ICP-MS are shown schematically in Fig. 3.1. 
The various components (numbered on Fig. 3.1) are described below. 
The plasma 
The plasma source consists of partially ionised Ar gas (formed by the reaction Ar -. ) Ar+ 
+ e-) sustained by a radio frequency (RF) field oscillating at 27.12 MHz. Samples are 
usually introduced in solution by a peristaltic pump providing a stable sample uptake to 
the nebuliser (Fig. 3.1, inset). The stream of sample solution is nebulised by a high 
velocity gas flow (1) producing an aerosol of sample droplets in Ar gas. This passes 
through a cooled spray chamber (2) which has 2 functions: (i) to remove large droplets

which are condensed and pumped away and (ii) to reduce water loading in the plasma 
(Hutton and Eaton, 1987). Thus only the finest spray (<10 . tm diameter) is introduced 
into the core of the plasma. This process of nebulisation is very inefficient with only 
approximately 1% of the sample solution being transported to the ICP. 
The plasma is generated and contained within a torch of 3 concentric quartz glass tubes 
(3, Fig. 3.1). This allows the sample to be introduced into the plasma in a stream of Ar 
whilst the coolant (4) and auxiliary (5) gas flows stabilise the plasma in the centre of the 
torch and prevent overheating of the torch walls. A copper induction coil (6) is wound 
two and a half times around the end of the torch and connected to a radio frequency 
generator which creates the oscillating, RF, electro-magnetic field sustaining the plasma. 
High temperatures in the plasma (upto 10,000 K) cause efficient and rapid desolvation 
(removal of solvent from liquid sample), volatilisation, atomisation and, finally, 
ionisation of the sample. 
The degree of ionisation is controlled by the ionisation temperature of the plasma, 
electron population of the plasma and the ionisation energy of the element (Gray, 1989). 
These factors are related by the Saha equation, which gives an estimation of the degree of 
ionisation of species in the plasma. 
Interface and ion focusing 
The interface transfers a portion of the ionised sample and Ar gas from the plasma at 
atmospheric pressure into a high vacuum chamber where the positive ions are focussed 
and passed into a mass spectrometer. This drop in pressure is accomplished in 2 phases. 
The plasma impinges on a water-cooled Ni sample cone (7) with a small orifice (1.0mm 
diameter) through which ions are extracted by a rotary vacuum pump into the first 
reduced pressure region (-5 mbar). Behind the sample cone is a skimmer cone (8), again 
made of Ni, with a 0.75mm aperture through which a portion of the extracted ions passes 
into the high vacuum region (- 5x10-6 mbar) maintained by diffusion pumps (in the case 
of the Aberystwyth instrument) or turbo-molecular pumps (in more recent instruments). 
The positively charged ions are then focussed by a system of 4 electrostatic lenses and 
pass into a quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
In the VG PlasmaQuad instrument a photon stop (9) is placed in the central axis of the 
lens system to prevent light from the plasma reaching the detector. In other instruments 
(eg. the Turner TS-Sola) the ion beam is bent away from a direct straight line light path 
through the instrument and no photon stop is required. 
The quadrupole 
The quadrupole is a system of 4 cylindrical h1o rods (12mm diameter, 230mm long) held 
parallel in a square array to which DC and RF voltages are applied. The quadrupole acts 
as a mass filter by allowing the transmission of ions of only one mass/charge (m/z) at any 
time. Varying the DC and RF potentials sequentially on the rods allows ions of a selected 
m/z through to the detector (10) sequentially and thus scanning the whole atomic mass 
range may be achieved. The maximum scan rate is limited by the control circuits of the 
quadrupole and is of the order of 0.1 Is for the whole m/z range. Thus many scans may be 
acquired in relatively short times. The mass spectrometer is capable of resolving 
individual isotopic peaks and each isotope may be identified from its mass/charge ratio. 
In normal operation the quadrupole is programmed to skip certain m/z regions of each 
scan to avoid high abundance isotopes and some commonly formed ion masses in the 
plasma (eg. Ar+, 2Ar+ and Ar complexes) which arc not of interest and would only 
reduce the life of the detector. 
The individual ions transmitted by the quadrupole are counted by a single channel 
electron multiplier. A multi-channel analyser (MCA) accumulates the counts in narrow 
m/z channels with 10 or more channels across each peak, producing a well defined 
spectrum. The whole system is supported by computer software capable of instrument 
control, data storage, handling, calculations etc. 
The process from introduction of sample to an ion reaching the detector is highly 
inefficient. Only one ion in approximately 108 makes the journey from nebuliser, through 
plasma, interface, ion lenses and quadrupole to the detector, and this places ultimate 
limits on instrument sensitivity. Improvements in design (eg. new interface geometries, 
changes to ion trajectories by redesigning the ion lenses) will gradually improve the 
transmission of ions and thus increase sensitivity (Houk et at., 1991). 
An example of a spectrum produced from the analysis of a river water sample is shown in 
Fig. 3.2.

3.2.2: Advantages and disadvantages of ICP-MS 
The main benefits of ICP-MS are that it can produce rapid, multi-elemental analyses of 
very low concentrations of elements in solution. Detection limits are extremely low (sub 
parts-per-billion level for many elements) and may be up to 3 orders of magnitude lower 
than ICP-AES (Thompson and Walsh, 1989; McLaren, 1992). Calibration is linear over at 
least 6 orders of magnitude. The scanning ability of the quadrupole mass spectrometer 
across the mass/charge range 6-240 can provide a complete record of the elemental 
composition of samples. In theory ICP-MS can analyse all elements in the periodic table 
except He, F, and Ne which have first ionisation energies greater than that for Ar and thus 
are not produced as singly charged, positive ions in the plasma. In practice H, C, N and 0 
are also omitted (Jarvis and Jarvis, 1992). 
ICP-MS is relatively free from inter-element interferences compared to the problems of 
over lapping spectral lines in ICP-AES (Houk, 1986). Mass spectra are inherently more 
simple than emission spectra, eg, iron has 4 isotopes but over 1000 optical emission lines. 
In ICP-MS interferences may occur with (i) polyatomic species formed by reactions with 
abundant ions in the plasma such as Ar, N and 0 and major constituents (eg. Na, Cl) of 
the introduced sample (eg. 40Ar35C1 on 75As, 40Ar37C1 on 77Se, 35C1160 on 51V, 
32S 160 on 48Ti, 48Ca, 40Arl6O on 56Fe and 1602 on 32S, (ii) doubly, charged ions 
which, as a result of the action of the quadrupole, appear at half the mass of the parent ion 
on the m/z scale (eg. 136Ba2+ would be seen at m/z=68, interfering with 68Zn) or (iii) 
the occurrence of oxide species which are seen at 16,17 or 18 atomic mass units (u) 
above the parent ion, eg. oxides of the Ba isotopes (130,131,134-138u) may interfere 
with the LREE (146Nd - 
156Gd). Similarly LREE oxides can cause interference on 
HREE. Interferences can usually be predicted and in practice few actually cause major 
problems. 
Elements which have second ionisation energies which are less than the first ionisation 
energy of Ar (15.76eV) will be partly doubly ionised. In practice high levels of M2+ are 
expected only for Ba and several REE (Houk, 1986), the second ionisation energies for 
Ba, La and Sm being 10.00eV, 11.43eV and 11.2eV respectively. Operational conditions 
may be optimised to make levels of M2+ negligible. The VG PlasmaQuad instrument 
performance specification quotes the maximum Ba2+/Ba+ to be 2% and the actual 
relative intensity achieved on the Aberystwyth instrument is -0.5%. Oxide levels are also 
minimised under optimal operating conditions and MO+/M+ levels for Ba of less than 
0.2% are specified by VG and values of 0.101% are actually achieved. In the case of 
polybaric overlaps alternative isotopes may usually be used. Unfortunately, in the case of 
mono-isotopic elements such as As and V there are no alternative isotopes free from 
interference which presents a problem if the analyte contains chlorine. There are ' also 
severe isobaric interferences due to the plasma gases in the determination of Fe (40Ar16() 
on 56Fe and 40ArI4N on 54Fe). Thus, although Fc and As concentrations could be 
considered of importance in a study of river waters, especially in areas of sulphide 
mineralisation, they have not been determined by ICP-MS. Fe and As contents of natural 
waters were below the limits of detection of AAS methods available in the Institute of 
Earth Studies and therefore have not been considered in this study. 
Determinations of K and Na were not undertaken by ICP-AMS. Potassium, due to the 
difficulties of resolving 39K from the much larger, adjacent 
40Ar peak and Na because 
determinations are very prone to contamination from NaCl on skin at all stages from 
sample collection and preparation to analysis. In natural waters Na is present in 
concentrations too high to be determined directly by ICP-AMS in the routine methods 
employed in this study and was therefore included in the skipped mIz regions of the 
spectral scan. 
Elements with high electronegativity only show a limited degree of ionisation to M+ in 
the plasma. These elements include for example S, P, and Se (Gray, 1989). The halogens 
also suffer from a low degree of ionisation because their first ionisation energies are high 
(Cl 13.02 eV; Br 11.85 eV; I 10.46 eV) and close to that of Ar (15.76 eV). The 
approximate degrees of ionisation are as follows: Cl to Cl+ = 0.9%; Br to Br+ = 4.5%; 
and Ito I+ = 33.9% (Gray, 1989). Chlorine, Br and I have been successfully determined 
by ICP-MS by Date and Stuart (1988) in 6 ground water samples which contained higher 
concentrations than those typically found in river waters, the Br and Cl concentrations 
being approximately an order of magnitude greater. 
Chlorine was not determined by ICP-MS as an automated photometric method (Fuge et 
al., 1985) was available in the Institute of Earth Studies and was used for selected 
samples. Approximately 160 samples were also analysed photometrically for I. Typical 
abundances of I in natural river water samples are in the order of a few 49L-1 (geometric 
mean of analyses in this study = 2.4 tgL-1). This is close to the lower limit'-of 
quantitation (LLQ, see Section 3.2.4) for I by semi-quantitative ICP-MS analysis (1.24  
gL-1) and correlation between photometric I analyses and those by ICP-MS is poor. 
Iodine concentrations by ICP-MS are therefore not quoted. 
In the case of Br, the two isotopes 79Br and 81Br were used. When there was a large 
discrepancy in the values due to ionisation difficulties or insufficient resolution from the 
Ar-Ar peak at mass 80, between 79Br and 81Br, the results have been disregarded. 
Ionisation of Br is poor at concentrations <100. ggL-1 (W. Perkins, pers. comm. ) and 
typical concentrations in waters analysed in this study are below this level. Differences in 
Br concentrations were, however, discernible between different sites and between the 
study areas which related to geological and mineralogical differences. Therefore, in the 
absence of an easy, alternative method of Br determination, concentrations by ICP-MS 
are quoted but it must be borne in mind that accuracy is likely to be poor, especially at the 
lower concentrations. 
For the determination of Ca the most abundant 40Ca isotope could obviously not be used 
because of interference by 40Ar. A low abundance (0.13%) isotope, 43Ca, was used for 
ICP-MS analysis and the values were compared with determinations by AAS. Fig. 3.3 
shows a correlation plot of the results. Very good correlation is seen and therefore 
concentrations quoted for Ca were calculated from the 43Ca peak. 
3.2.3: Applications of ICP-MS 
Since introduction commercially in 1983, ICP-MS has rapidly gained acceptance and 
been applied in numerous ways to the fields of geological, environmental, industrial, 
food, medical and nuclear sciences. These applications are summarised in Jarvis et al. 
(1992) and further reviews may be found in Date and Jarvis (1989, geological 
applications), Beauchemin (1989, environmental applications) and Dean et al. (1989, 
food science applications). Of relevance here is the application of ICP-MS to the analysis 
of natural waters, reviews of which are given by Taylor (1989) and McLaren (1992). 
Determination of the geochemistry of natural waters is of interest for a number of 
reasons: (i) to assess suitability as a potable water supply or for industrial use, and (ii) in 
environmental studies to examine the sources and trace the pathways of elements, 
particularly pollutants, in the hydrosphere. ICP-MS is sensitive enough to analyse many 
elements in freshwaters without the need for preconcentration (eg. B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, 
Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Hg, Ti, Pb and U; 
Beauchemin et al., 1987; Garbarino and 
Taylor, 1987; Taylor, 1989). ICP-MS has 
recently been accepted as a procedure for the analysis of ground, surface and drinking 
waters by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Method 200.8) indicating, perhaps, the 
importance of the technique (McLaren, 1992). 
For the analysis of seawaters high total dissolved solids cause problems with ICP-MS by 
blocking the sample orifices (by precipitation of NaCl) and complex matrix interferences 
(Na and Cl polyatomic species). Thus work reported so far has involved chemical separations 
(eg. McLaren et al., 1990) or dilutions (eg. Hutton and Eaton, 1991) in attempts to overcome 
these problems. Ir 
The majority of published work assesses the suitability of ICP-MS in the analysis of natural 
waters (Beauchemin and Berman, 1989; Beauchemin et a., 1987; Henshaw et al., 1989; Hall, 
1992). There appear to be few reports to date however, which apply ICP-MS as a routine 
analytical technique in environmental geochemistry research and most of these target only a 
few elements (Boomer and Powell, 1986; Henshaw et al., 1989). This project applies the 
sensitivity and speed of analysis of ICP-MS to a reconnaissance study of large numbers of 
river water samples (-1200) over a period from November 1989 to July 1991. This has 
enabled comparison of chemistries from a number of geologically different areas, and, the 
examination of monthly variations which would not have been possible using any other mode 
of analysis. In particular, the low detection limits and the number of elements which may be 
analysed simultaneously make ICP-MS ideal for this study. 
3.2.4: Analytical procedures 
The operational conditions of the instrument and the sample preparation techniques used for 
analysis in this study are outlined in Table 3.1. 
Various calibration methods may be applied in ICP-MS analysis: using external standards; 
standard additions; isotope dilution and internal standardisation. These are described in full 
by Jarvis et a. (1992, and references cited therein). The main method used in this study is a 
so called "semi-quantitative" technique using a single internal standard. A small number of 
"fully-quantitative" ICP-MS analyses calibrated using 4 multi-element aqueous standards 
were also conducted to assess the quality of semi-quantitative data (Pearce, 1991). 
Fully quantitative analysis of a National Bureau of Standards Water Reference Material 
1643b was made to compare the accuracy of ICP-MS with certified values. The results are 
listed in Table 3.1. A and very good correlations are seen.

across the mass range is used for calibration (Fig. 3.4). A relatively smooth curve is 
produced, taking into account the degree of ionisation of the elements (given roughly be 
the Saha equation, see above) and their isotopic abundances. In the initial setting up of 
the instrument for routine water analysis a spectrum was acquired from a solution 
containing 100 gL-1 each of approximately 60 elements covering the mass range 6-238 
and the Saha factors adjusted to produce the best possible fit curve for all elements. The 
shape of the response curve may vary, depending on operating conditions of the 
instrument, so a new response curve is generated on a daily basis prior to semi- 
quantitative analysis. A solution of typically 6-8 elements spanning the mass range is 
used to define the response curve. In this case a solution of, 100 gL-1 each of Be, Mg, 
Co, In, La, Pb and U was used. A multi-element solution of known concentration, such as 
that used to erect the Saha factors, is analysed regularly to check the response of the 
instrument and the suitability of any particular response curve for semi-quantitative 
analysis. A known quantity of internal standard is added to each sample, in this case 100 
tgL-1 In. Indium was chosen as the internal standard because it is near the centre of the 
mass range and is uncommon in the natural environment, thus may be assumed to be 
absent from the samples. The calculation of element concentrations in each sample is 
made by comparison with the response curve. The internal standard has the added 
advantage of monitoring any change in sensitivity between samples and thus compensates 
for instrument drift. A m/z spectrum for the sample is collected from one analysis taking 
100 scans across the mass range (in this case 6-240.1). 
The manufacturers of the PlasmaQuad (VG Elemental) suggest an accuracy of +/- 30% 
may be expected from semi-quantitative analyses. In this study the accuracy of the semi- 
quantitative data was assessed by reference to quantitative ICP-MS analyses, calibrated 
using 4 multi-element aqueous standards to give straight line graphs of concentration 
against response for each element considered. In fully quantitative analysis the average of 
three 100-scan runs is taken. 
Correlation plots of quantitative against semi-quantitative results are shown in Fig. 3.5. 
Semi-quantitative results are normally within +/- 30% of the quantitative values for 
concentrations greater than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ, see below) and very 
good correlation is seen (correlation coefficients, r, shown on Fig. 3.5). The range of 
accuracies (measured as the difference between quantitative and semi-quantitative results 
as a percentage of the quantitative value) are given in Table 3.2. Table 3.2 also presents 
the proportion of values lying within +/- 30% and +/- 15% of the quantitative results. The 
lighter elements (Mg, Al and Ca) show the greatest differences and this may 
be a function 
of the instrument response curve where a small difference in In response will produce 
bigger variations in element determinations at the lighter end of the mass range where the 
instrument is much less sensitive. For other elements the accuracy is typically 
better than 
+/- 30%, eg. 95% of Cu values are within +/- 14% and 78% of Pb values are within +/- 
The seasonal variations in trace element concentrations (see Chapters 4-8) often show a 
range of concentrations varying by a factor of 2 and upto, in some cases, several orders of 
magnitude, ie. variations in the order of 100-1000+%. For this type of environmental 
reconnaissance survey, where trends showing such variability in concentration are 
observed, the accuracy of semi-quantitative analysis (typically much better than +/- 30%) 
is considered sufficient. 
Duplicate analyses 
Duplicate pairs of samples, selected randomly from analytical batches, were analysed. 
This gives an indication of the reproducibility or precision of results and accounts for 
errors introduced in sample preparation (eg. contamination or inaccurate measurement of 
spike, sample or acid) and variabilities of analytical results. Standard deviations were 
calculated for the duplicate pairs using the method described by Snedecor and Cochran 
(1967) and are shown in Table 3.3. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) are mostly 
within +/- 20% thus the variations in precision are indistinguishable from the variation in 
accuracy attainable by semi-quantitative analysis. The poor precision for Br and l 'is 
attributed to ionisation difficulties (see above). Poor precision is also evident for Ni 
which is only present at low concentrations (mean 2.8 gL'1). 
Detection limits 
The theoretical lower limit of detection (LLD) for individual isotopes was calculated, at 3 
 confidence level (ie. 3 standard deviations or 99% confidence) using the formula: -

Cstd = concentration of element in standard (in this case 100 gL-1) 
LLDs are listed in Table 3.4. For most isotopes the theoretical LLD is 1 gL-1. Zn, Br, 
25Mg and 26Mg have LLDs in the order of a few pgL-1 and 43Ca LLD ranges from 5.9- 
27 pgL-1. These elements are present in the blank due to either contamination or sample 
carry-over in the instrument. Thus, blank counts are often high and this raises the LLD. 
Also, for Ca analyses, 43Ca is a very low abundance isotope (0.13%) and hence in a 
solution with only 100 gL-1 the response for the isotope is extremely low. Most natural 
waters contain Ca in excess of 2,000 pgL-1. 
It is seen in Table 3.4 that detection limits change with varying instrument sensitivity 
(indicated by the response for 1151n). For example, in the case of 66Zn the highest 
calculated LLD (2.79 gL'l) was seen in March 1990 when instrument sensitivity was 
low (In response = 219) and the lowest calculated LLD (1.10 gL-1) seen was in 
February 1991 when the sensitivity was very high (In response = 1440). Detection limits 
also vary according to the relative abundance of different isotopes of an element. For 
example, the LLD for 88Sr is much lower than that for 86Sr, due to the differences in 
isotopic abundances with 88Sr being much more abundant than 86Sr (82.6% cf. 9.9%). 
The same effect is also seen for other elements such as 24Mg (79%) and 25Mg (10%); 
63Cu (69.1%) and 65Cu (30.9%); 66Zn (27.8%) and 68Zn (18.6%); 98Mo (24.4%) and 
95Mo (15.9%) etc. Thus whenever possible a high abundance isotope of a particular 
element should be chosen to give lower theoretical detection limits. 
Table 3.4 shows the lower limit of quantitation (xLLQ) given by lOa above the mean 
background signal. Use of the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) is recommended by the 
American Chemical Society Committee on Environmental Improvement (1980) rather 
than the LLD which can give a false measure of confidence in the lowest quantifiable 
signal (Potts, 1987). 
REE analysis 
The analysis of the rare earth elements (REE) is mentioned separately here because this 
study has illustrated the potential use of ICP-MS for the analysis of REE in natural 
waters. 
The high sensitivity and the scanning ability of ICP-MS enabled the detection of 
significant levels of REE in mine drainage waters in Coed y Brenin (see Chapter 4.9). 
The detection limits of ICP-MS for the REE are far superior to other methods such as 
ICP-AES or XRF for which preconcentration would be necessary (Jarvis et al., 1992). 
The REE have been studied in detail over the past few decades because their systematic 
geochemical behaviour makes them useful as tracers in a variety of geochemical 
processes. All the REE are found together, as a rule, in specific relative abundances 
(Fleet, 1984). Their application to petrogenetic studies is well documented (Frey et al., 
1978; Henderson, 1984) but relatively little work has been carried out on the aqueous 
geochemistry of the REE (Brookins, 1989). 
REE are required for use in the electronics and ceramic industries and a detailed 
understanding of their behaviour in the secondary environment could help in the 
geochemical exploration for new resources. A knowledge of REE behaviour is also 
important for nuclear waste disposal because (i) they are produced in the fission of U and 
Pu (Rard, 1988) and (ii) they may be used as analogues for the behaviour of the actinide 
series elements (Th, U, Pu etc. ) for which less data are available (Wood, 1990). 
The REE concentrations of natural freshwaters quoted in the literature are mostly for., 
"dissolved" loads, ie. the waters have been passed through either 0.2 or 0.45 m filters. 
The majority of samples in this study were not filtered but a comparison on 3 samples 
was made. Paired samples were taken and one from each pair was passed through a 0.45 
m Millipore filter in the field. 2 of these filtered samples were acidified to 0.05M with 
Aristar HNO3 at the time of collection. The results are listed in Table 3.5. The differences 
observed are within the expected accuracy and precision of semi-quantitative analysis and 
indicate no discernible difference between the REE concentrations in filtered and 
unfiltered samples. Thus comparison between the "total" concentrations given in this 
study and the "dissolved" concentrations quoted in the literature may be made. 
Summary 
Elements routinely quoted in this study are: Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, 
Cd, Ba, Pb and U. Other elements of interest which have been detected in some of the 
most contaminated streams include Cr, Hg, W, Mo, REE, Ti and Th and are reported 
where they occur. In most of the cases where more than one isotope has been used for 
calculation (eg. 24Mg, 25Mg, 26Mg; 
63Cu, 65Cu, 66Zn, 68Zn) the lowest value is taken 
to avoid over-estimations. For example, it is possible that the results given for 
could 
include interference from 40Ar23Na. However, the results from different isotopes usually

3.3: FIELD TECHNIQUES 
3.3.1: Introduction 
The procedures used in the sampling, transport and storage of river water samples are 
very important as this is a potential source of major error (Hem,, 1970). The sampling and 
storage of waters for trace metal analysis has been discussed, for example by Batley and 
Gardner (1977) and Sturgeon and Berman (1987). 1 The low detection limits capable by 
ICP-MS make the risks of contamination more significant (Henshaw et al., 1989). 
Two major questions need to be addressed in the sampling of natural waters. Firstly, how 
representative is a water sample of the particular water body in question. Temporal 
variations in river water composition may occur as  described in Chapter 2.6' but in 
addition spatial variations are common across the lateral and vertical profiles of large 
rivers. All the rivers and streams sampled in this study are shallow and. turbulent enough 
for few inhomogeneities to persist. Sampling sites were chosen to avoid the possibility of 
insufficient mixing of tributaries and samples were taken above possible sources of 
contamination such as roads, footpaths etc. The surface microlayers of rivers have been 
found to be enriched in trace elements (Pojasek and Zajicek, 1978) and should therefore 
be avoided as should the inclusion of disturbed sediments. Samples for this 'study were 
taken mid-stream and from below the surface whenever possible. 
Secondly, when a sample of water is collected from a river and taken away for analysis it 
is likely to be changed chemically. Bottles and any equipment used for sampling may be 
a source of contamination, thus pre-cleaning of all 'equipment ' is necessary. Teflon, 
polypropylene or polyethylene are the preferred materials for containers and should be 
acid leached before use. Bottles should be completely filled to minimise gas exchange 
with air which is likely to alter Eh, pH and carbonate equilibria. Trace element 
concentrations may be reduced by precipitation or adsorption onto container walls or 
suspended particles and in attempting to prevent this samples are often treated in the field 
by filtration, usually through 0.45 m filters, and the acidified to 0.05M H+ (Batley and 
Gardner, 1977). Refrigeration of the samples and storage in the dark is normally 
recommended (Batley and Gardener, 1977). 
Treatment of samples by filtration and acidification in the field is time-consuming and is 
also a possible source of sample contamination. During this study a comparison of 
analyses of treated and untreated samples from the-same sites was made to assess the 
necessity of sample treatment in the field (Pearce, 1991). 
3.3.2: Sampling procedures 
Samples were collected in 60mL polyethylene bottles which had been soaked for 'at least 
24 hours in 10% HNO3, rinsed thoroughly in purified (Milli-Q) 18 Mohmcm water and 
air, dried. In the field the bottles were rinsed 3 times with, river water before sample 
collection. For the comparison of filtered and acidified and untreated samples 2 samples 
were collected at each location, one of which was filtered through a 0.4 pm Millipore 
filter and acidified to 0.05M with BDH Aristar HNO3. Samples were refrigerated and 
analysed within 4 days of sampling. Most of the comparisons were made in October 
1989, November 1989 and March 1990 at times when flow was fairly high and the 
content of suspended particulate matter was likely to be relatively high. In addition a 
small, number of samples were taken from the Flint area in May and June 1990 during 
periods of low flow. 
The. results for this comparative study are shown in Fig. 3.6. Most elements show 
extremely good correlation, especially for concentrations >LLQ and any variations are 
well within the errors of semi-quantitative analysis (see Section 3.2.4). It was therefore 
considered unnecessary to filter and acidify samples in the field. The values quoted are 
therefore of "total" element contents which are important in the consideration of overall 
exposure to toxic metals and the volume of metals transported from the source area. 
The only exception to the good correlations between analyses from treated and untreated 
samples is seen in the analysis of Al in waters from the limestone influenced area of Flint. 
Samples from Flint are marked by a cross in a circle on Fig. 3.6 and show significantly 
higher Al in the untreated samples. This suggests that a large proportion of the Al in these 
samples resides in the particulate (>0.45 pm) phase which is filtered out of the treated 
samples. -These Flint waters have high pH (-7-9) compared with the Coed y Brenin and 
Llangynog samples (pH -5-7) and have much higher total dissolved solids. It has been 
suggested that Al is precipitated in the high pH conditions and is held in suspension as

and filtered, but unacidified samples was made with a number of samples (Fig. 3.7) and 
no obvious differences were observed. Thus for the analysis of Al in waters of high pH it 
is advisable to filter samples in the field but, to save time and avoid further risk of 
contamination it is not necessary to acidify them. During this study therefore, water 
samples from the Flint area were filtered in the field. 
3.4: OTHER ANALYSES 
Temperature and some conductivity readings were taken in the field and are included in 
the data tables in the Appendix. The portable pH meters available were found to be 
unreliable and therefore laboratory measurements were made on a Phillips - Pye Unicam 
9418 pH meter. Buffer solutions of pH 4.0,7.0 and 9.22 were used for calibration. Cl and 
I were analysed by automated photometric methods as described by Fuge et al. (1985). 
Sulphate analyses were carried out on -100 samples by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) on a Dionex instrument in the Soil Science Department in 
Aberystwyth.

CHAPTER 4: COED Y BRENIN 
4.1: Introduction 
Coed y Brenin is approximately 8 km north of Dolgellau, Gwynedd (Fig. 1.2 and Fig. 4.1). 
The study area is of moderate relief (40-400m) and dissected by the steep-sided valleys of 
the Afon Mawddach and Afon Wen which flow generally southwards. Most of the area is 
owned by the Forestry Commission and is planted with mature conifers. There are small 
areas of pasture grazing at Capel Hermon, Dolfrwynog, Cwm Heisian ganol and Glasdir- 
isaf (Fig. 4.1). 
Geology 
The area is underlain predominantly by Cambrian mudstones, siltstones and greywackes 
intruded by microtonalites and microdiorites related to the pre-Arenig Rhobell Fawr 
volcanic activity (Allen et al., 1976), (Fig. 4.2). Structurally, the-'area is located on the 
southeast edge of the Harlech Dome and the Cambrian sediments dip steeply eastwards. 
Mineralisation can be grouped into 4 styles, (i) quartz-sulphide veins, (ii) disseminated 
copper mineralisation, (iii) Cu impregnated bogs and (iv) mineralised breccia pipes. 
The quartz-sulphide veins containing pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite, were 
emplaced during the early Devonian after Caledonian folding and metamorphism (Ineson 
and Mitchell, 1975). The majority of veins occur in the Clogau Formation although they 
cut most formations from the Rhinog upwards (Allen and Jackson, 1985). Rare gold 
occurrences are found either dispersed through the quartz or in close association with 
sulphide minerals, particularly pyrite and arsenopyrite. 
Other ore minerals recorded from the district include pyrrhotite, marcasite, mackinawite, 
tetrahedrite and tellurbismuth, native silver and argentiferous galena (Forbes, 1867; Hunt, 
1875; Gilbey, 1969). 
A copper-impregnated peat bog, 0.5 km west of Dolfrwynog (742256) and known locally 
as "Turf Copper" (Plate 4.2) was worked in the early part of the nineteenth century. A 
layer of peat up to 60 cm thick was dug and burnt producing a Cu-rich ash which was 
sent to Swansea for smelting (Henwood, 1856). The lower peat layers were particularly 
Cu-rich and often were sent for smelting without burning. The actual Cu-content of the 
peat removed is uncertain but Henwood (1856) states that peat with less than about 2.5% 
Cu was not considered worth extracting. Most of -the peat 
has been removed from Turf 
Copper and the remaining peat has generally <2% Cu in the ash (Andrews and Fuge, 
1986). Three smaller copper-rich bogs -1.2 km south of Turf Copper, are mostly 
undisturbed and contain up to 5.72% Cu (Andrews and Fuge, 1986). During the 19th 
century much exploration of the surrounding hills was carried out in search of a great 
lode from which the Cu was thought to be carried in solution. This was never found and 
was thought by Ramsey (1881) unlikely to exist. The presence of the cupriferous bogs, 
along with early references to disseminated copper mineralisation in the area (Ramsey, 
1866; Hunt, 1887) attracted mineral exploration by Rio Tinto Finance Exploration Ltd. 
(Riofinex) from 1968 to 1973 (see Rice and Sharp, 1976). Detailed geological, 
geochemical and geophysical investigations led to extensive drilling which proved the 
existence of porphyry copper type mineralisation at Capel Hermon (749257) (Rice and 
Sharp, 1976), with 2 zones grading >0.2% Cu (see Fig. 4.2). However, the prospect has 
never been developed due to environmental restrictions. 
The porphyry copper type mineralisation is dominated by chalcopyrite, which occurs in 
veinlets and as fine disseminations in dioritic intrusions emplaced in the Ffestiniog Flags 
Formation (Mawddach Group) of the Upper Cambrian. Allen et al. (1976) suggest that 
the mineralisation is related to the Rhobell Volcanic Group magmatism in the late 
Tremadoc. 
Andrew (1910) described the Cu-rich ore body at Glasdir (741223). This is interpreted by 
Allen and Easterbrook (1978) as a flattened inverted cone-shaped body within the margin 
of a breccia pipe intruded in the Ffestiniog Flags Formation and was probably also 
formed during the late Tremadoc magmatism. The ore contains pyrite, marcasite, 
arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and minor sphalerite (Phillips, 1918). 5 other, smaller pipes 
have been located in the area (Allen and Easterbrook, 1978) which contain pyrite and 
arsenopyrite but minor chalcopyrite has been found in only one of them. 
Mining History 
Mining of the quartz-sulphide veins has been carried out sporadically since the late 
seventeenth century and possibly earlier (Morrison, 1975). Cefn Coch (722235) was 
producing lead in the eighteenth century (Lewis, 1967). In the first half of the nineteenth 
century copper was worked at Dolfrwynog (747257) and Turf Copper (741256), and lead 
at the Cwm Heisian mines (742282,737277) and Tyddyn-gwladys mines (734268) 
(Fig. 4.1), (Hall, 1975). Gwynfynydd (736282) may also have been producing lead early 
in the nineteenth century (Hall, 1975; Morrison, 1975). Gold was reputedly first found at

Cwm Heisian in 1843 (Hall, 1975) and led to a considerable increase in mining activity in 
the area. However, the gold was found only in small isolated pockets, the bulk grade was 
very poor and thus gold production was sporadic. The main gold producer in the 
Dolgellau Gold Belt was Clogau, approximately 16 km southwest of Coed y Brenin '(see 
Chapter 7). The major gold mine in the Coed y Brenin area was Gwynfynydd which 
produced gold in the second half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth 
century. Gwynfynydd was reopened during the 1980s but the erratic and discontinuous 
nature of the ore caused problems yet again and the mine was abandoned by the end of 
1989, although there are currently plans to re-open this working yet again. 
Copper mining at Glasdir was carried out on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century 
and later increased until its closure in 1914 at the onset of the First World War. The mine 
is most notable as being the site of the development of froth flotation techniques in ore 
separation (Hall, 1975). 
Extensive mine tips remain in the Coed y Brenin area, in particular on the west side of the 
A. Mawddach at Gwynfynydd and Bedd-y-coedwr and to a lesser extent at the Cwm 
Heisian mines and Tyddyn-gwladys to the east. Other extensive visible remains are at 
Glasdir. Open cast extraction of the lode has left a large pit 300m west of Glasdir isaf 
(741223) and the remains of the mill site and further mine tips are 0.5 km northwest on 
the steep bank of the A. Las (Plate 1.1). 
Previous Research 
Environmental research in the area has centred on botanical or biogeochemical studies of 
the Turf Copper bog (Ernst, 1969; Cole, 1980; Farago et al., 1980; Darch and Barber, 
1983; Andrews and Fuge, 1985) and 3 smaller Cu-rich bogs have also been described in 
the vicinity by Andrews and Fuge (1986). The significance of the bogs in mineral 
exploration has been discussed (Mehrtens et al., 1973; Boyle, 1977; Andrews and Fuge, 
1986). Detailed soil (Rice and Sharp, 1976; Al Ajely et al., 1984; Andrews and Fuge, 
1985,1986), stream sediment (Rice and Sharp, 1976) and vegetation surveys (Al Ajely et 
al., 1984; Al Ajely, 1985) highlight Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn and As anomalies associated with the 
porphyry copper mineralisation. Cooper (1976) reports Cu anomalies in stream waters in 
Coed y Brenin, highest in the vicinity of Turf Copper and the porphyry copper deposit 
and weaker anomalies associated with vein mineralisation. 
Sample sites 
The location of stream sampling sites in the Coed y Brenin area and the relation to former 
mines, trials adits and waste tips are shown in Figure 4.1 and briefly described in Table 
The sites cover a range of main river samples from the A. Mawddach and the A. Wen and 
their tributaries which drain a variety of mined areas and those which are mineralised. 
Samples were also collected from unmined and unmineralised area. Samples were 
collected on a monthly basis from the sites prefixed "C" during the period from December 
1989 to July 1991. The samples prefixed "G" form a profile downstream from 
Gwynfynydd along the A. Mawddach and were collected following an outburst from the 
mine in May 1990 (see Section 4.11) and on a monthly basis thereafter. 
4.2: Results 
Analytical data for individual sample sites are summarised in Table 4.2. It is notable that 
the absolute concentrations of many elements vary greatly from month to month at each 
site as well as wide variations being recorded between sites. The mean concentrations of 
selected metals for all sites are shown in Fig. 4.3. Individual aspects of the water 
chemistry will be discussed in detail in the following sections. 
As discussed in Chapter 2.6 (Flow variations), monthly variations of element 
concentration are closely related to changes in flow rate. Flow measurements were not 
made in this study but rainfall totals have been used to give an indication of seasonal 
variations in flow. Daily rainfall data for the Coed y Brenin area are taken from the 
Meteorological Office weather station at Buarthe Newydd (745259, altitude 198m) near 
Dolfrwynog. In general, high flows occurred during the high rainfall, autumn and winter 
months with lower flows in spring and summer (see Plates 4.4 and 4.5). As the time of 
sampling in each month was variable, and usually mid-month, rainfall totals for a fixed 
number of days prior to the sample date were used rather than monthly totals ("Whole 
month" in Fig. 4.4). Thus the rainfall totals for the previous day and the previous 3,5,7, 
10,14 and 21 days (Fig. 4.4) were used to examine the relationship between rainfall totals 
and element concentrations both graphically and by the calculation of correlation 
coefficients. 
Riverwater flow is not necessarily directly related to the rainfall input but is complicated 
by variable catchment characteristics such as soil type, relief, antecedent weather

conditions, the pathway of water to the river (eg. as overland flow, shallow throughflow 
in upper soil horizons or deeper throughflow), vegetation (eg. increased evapo- 
transpiration in summer and interception of rainfall by vegetation) (see Chapter 2.6). 
However, the rainfall totals shown in Fig. 4.4 do show a general seasonal trend of high 
rainfall in 'autumn/winter and low rainfall in spring/summer and this corresponds with 
observed trends of high and low flow levels in the rivers. 
4.3: pH' 
In general the` waters are all slightly acidic (pH 3.2-6.9). The lowest values (pH <4.0) are 
from mine and tip drains and caused by the oxidation of pyrite producing sulphuric acid 
by, for example, the following reactions (Singer and Stumm, 1970): 
FeS2 + 7/202 + H2O -- Fe2+ + 2SO42- + 2H+ 
Fe2+ + 1/402 + H+ ---)Fe3+ + 1/2H20' 
Fe3+ + 3H20 -- Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ 
FeS2 + 14Fe3+ + 8H20 -415Fe2+ + 2SO42--+ 16H+ 
pH levels of <4.5 in natural waters most commonly indicate the oxidation of sulphides in 
this manner (Levinson, 1980). The production of acid mine drainage may affect the 
environment in several ways: 
(i) The direct toxicity of the acidity itself. 
(ii) At low pH the carbonate buffer system is destroyed. At pH <4.2 bicarbonate and 
carbonate are converted to carbonic acid which dissociates to H2O and free C02 
and this may be lost to the atmosphere (Kelly, 1991). Thus the inorganic source of 
carbon for photosynthetic organisms is lost. 
(iii) Heavy metals become more soluble at low pH levels (see Chapter 2.2). Thus the 
acidity produced by oxidation of pyrite accelerates the weathering of ore minerals 
and large volumes of Pb, Zn, Cd etc. may be dissolved' from mineral veins and 
mine tips. 
(iv) Other toxic metals, particularly Al, may be released by acidic waters and it has been 
suggested that the toxicity of Al to many aquatic organisms increases at lower pH 
(Gostomski, 1990). 
(v) The precipitation of ochre, often associated with acid mine drainage, can have a 
detrimental effect on the biota by preventing light penetration, causing abrasion 
and by smothering benthic organisms. In addition, where the drainage affects 
salmon rivers such as the Mawddach the ochre precipitation has a deleterious 
effect on the spawning grounds. 
Thus, acidity from mine drainage exacerbates the heavy metal contamination problem. ; 
pH levels in the Mawddach are generally lower than the 
Wen and tributaries unaffected 
by acid mine drainage.. The mean background pH, upstream of mining activity . 
in, the 
Mawddach (site C5) is 5.9 but in the Wen, away from any obvious mining (site . 
mean pH is 6.4. 
The initial pH of the rainfall inputs over the Coed y Brenin area may be assumed to, be 
roughly the same for any one rainfall event. Therefore, the significant difference in mean 
background pH levels in the A. Mawddach and the A. Wen must be attributable, to, 
subsequent interactions during the passage of rainwater to the rivers. 
Rainwater in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 is slightly acidic (pH=5.7) and, greater 
acidity may be produced for example by industrial pollution (see Chapter 2.3). Mean 
rainfall pH values in upland Wales of 4.4-4.6 have been proposed by Donald et al. (1990) 
and most work suggests that pH levels are at least moderately acidic (Reynolds et al., 
1983; Reynolds, 1983; Donald and Stoner, 1989; Hyett, 1990). Consideration of_aspects 
of the course of the Mawddach indicates several factors against the neutralisation of 
acidic water inputs and indeed some that will tend to increase acidity. ; . 
i) The Mawddach drains the high relief, peat moorland to the east and northeast of Coed y 
Brenin and during periods of high flow, particularly in winter and early spring, is 
often brown coloured and peaty, reflecting a high organic content, and thus 
increased humic acids. 
ii) Most of the course of the Mawddach is over Cambrian rocks of the Mawddach and 
Harlech Grits Groups (Fig. 4.2). These are mainly mudstones and siltstones which 
are base-poor and have little or no buffering capacity to neutralise acidic rainfall. 
iii) Coniferous plantations predominate over the stretches of the Mawddach ' under 
consideration and, as described in Chapter 2.4, may reduce the buffering capacity 
or even increase the acidity of the river. 
iv) In addition to the natural background acidity discussed above, highly acidic mine 
drainage is input into the Mawddach at point sources from mine and tip drains- 
(sites G2 and C7) and from seepage through tips, particularly on the west bank of 
the river near Gwynfynydd Mine. This further increases acidity and the mean pH 
value falls from 5.9 at site C5 (100m above Gwynfynydd) to 5.5 at G5 (620m 
below Gwynfynydd). The low buffering capacity of the river results in pH levels 
remaining fairly low for some distance downstream. At site G9,5.3 km 
downstream from Gwynfynydd Mine mean pH is still only 5.8. 
In the A. Wen a greater buffering capacity enables a raising of the pH to a mean value (at 
site C13) of 6.4. A number of differences are observed between the A. Wen and the 
A. Mawddach: 
i) The Wen drains fairly high moorland on the western slopes of Rhobell Fawr but the 
catchment is not as high nor the course of the river as long as that of the 
Mawddach. The Wen therefore does not receive such high organic inputs as the 
Mawddach during high rainfall periods and thus is naturally less acidic. . 
ii) The course of the Wen is very different geologically to that of the Mawddach (see 
Fig. 4.2). The Wen crosses microtonalitic/dioritic intrusive igneous rocks., These 
are intermediate, calc-alkaline in composition and thus more bases are available 
for neutralisation of acid waters. This is supported by the mean Ca concentrations 
in the Wen (site C13 - 4,684 tgL'l) and the Mawddach (site C5 - 2,166 . tgL-1). 
(iii) There is less coniferous forestation along the course of the Wen. 
(iv) There are no major inputs of acid mine drainage to the Wen, as there are in the 
Mawddach to further increase acidity. 
4.4: Al 
Aluminium concentrations show an inverse correlation (r=-0.595, Table 4.3) with pH 
(Fig. 4.5) a feature of its chemistry which has been well documented (eg. Bull and Hall, 
1986; Birchall and Chappel, 1988; Goenaga and Williams, 1988). This relationship is due 
to the increased solubility of Al with decreasing pH. Aluminium levels in the Mawddach 
(with lower pH) are therefore higher than in the Wen and unpolluted tributaries as 
illustrated in Fig. 4.3. A. 
Significant point sources of Al are from the mine and tip drains at Gwynfynydd (G2 and 
C7) and in the drainage from Cwm Heisian Issa mine (Cl). These are acidic waters with 
mean pH values of 3.7,4.0 and 5.0 respectively thus the high Al concentrations are 
produced by increased dissolution of Al in the low pH waters. 
Fig. 4.6 shows monthly variations in Al concentrations from selected sites across the area. 
A trend of high, concentrations in autumn-early spring during high flows and low 
concentrations in late spring and summer during low flows is seen. The decrease in Al 
concentrations corresponds with increases in pH (Fig. 4.7). 
The autumn-winter maxima will be affected, probably' to a large extent, by increased 
organic content at higher flows producing more humic acid and causing a drop in pH and 
a greater solubility of Al. 
When rainfall is low the proportion of groundwater reaching the rivers increases, and the 
through-flow of groundwater will be slower. Longer retention time of the initially acid 
water allows more neutralisation by reaction with silicate minerals (Hornung et al., 
1990b). The increased pH as described above leads to a decrease in Al content. The 
monthly variations seen may be very large with minimum values often only 10% of the 
maximum (see Fig. 4.6, Table 4.2). The widest extremes are seen at site Cl with summer 
values being 1/80 of the winter maximum. 
The Al-pH relationship is very important in consideration of the environmental impact of 
river water chemistry because not only do elevated levels of acidity and Al have a 
harmful effect on aquatic life-forms (Kelly, 1991) but also, as mentioned above, the 
toxicity of Al is thought to increase with decreasing pH (Gostomski, 1990). 
4.5: Ca and Mg 
Figs. 4.8 and 4.9 show typical variations in Ca and Mg and indicate; their behaviour is 
closely correlated (r=0.920, see Table 4.3). The patterns seen roughly mimic pH but are 
the reverse of those for Al (Fig. 4.9). High Ca and Mg levels occur during the summer 
months of low flow, and lower levels in autumn and winter, the high levels corresponding 
with high pH. Calcium and Mg ions are bases which tend to neutralise stream water 
acidity. During autumn and winter the background Ca and Mg levels are diluted by 
increased rainfall, thus lowering the buffering capacity and causing a drop in pH. 
It is clear that flow variations affect river acidity by controlling both the input of acidity 
and the availability of neutralising basic ions. Thus the increase in acidity in winter (and 
the consequent increase in Al concentrations) is due to a combination of an increase in 
organic acids washed out of peat and a decrease in basic ions due to dilution and 
increased rate of throughflow. 
As mentioned briefly in Section 4.3 background Ca concentrations are higher in the 
A. Wen than in the A. Mawddach (mean concentrations of 4,684 and 2,166 gL-l at sites 
C13 and C5 respectively, geometric means, GM 4,415 tgL-1 Ca and 2,083 g L-1). The 
tributaries of the Wen and those of the Mawddach draining the area west of Capel

Hermon (sites Cl, C2 and C3) also show slightly higher Ca concentrations than the levels 
seen in the main A. Mawddach (Fig. 4.3. B). A similar pattern is seen for Mg although the 
variations are not so marked (Fig. 4.3. C). The difference in chemistry of the river waters 
may be partly explained by geological differences (see Fig. 4.2). The relatively high Ca 
and Mg streams drain an area- underlain by microtonalitic-dioritic igneous intrusives 
(Allen and Jackson, 1985) from which the basic ions are readily weathered. The lower Ca 
and Mg streams drain -predominantly Cambrian mudstones and siltstones which are 
relatively poor in Ca and Mg. 
Obvious exceptions to the low Ca and Mg trend in the Mawddach catchment are the mine 
and tip drainage sites at Gwynfynydd (G2 and C7). Extremely high concentrations are 
seen (Table 4.2) with levels at G2 up to 48,000 tgL-1 Ca, 19,000 gL-1 Mg and at C7 of 
35,300 gL-1 Ca, 14,000 . tgL-1 Mg. The greater part of the high Ca and Mg 
concentrations are thought to derive from carbonate gangue material (calcite and possibly 
ankerite) in the vein mineralisation. Magnesium is a common trace element in calcite 
(being reported at concentrations of up to 6,000 mgKg-1 in calcites from the mid-Wales 
ore field, Kakar, 1971) and is a major component of ankerite [(Ca, Mg, Fe)C03). Both Ca 
and Mg may also occur as minor components of some ore minerals (Kakar, 1971; 
Levinson, 1980). The low pH of the mine drainage waters will assist the dissolution of 
readily weathered carbonate gangue minerals, hence the high concentrations of Ca and 
Mg seen. 
It has been suggested above that seasonal variations in pH, Al, Ca and Mg are all closely 
inter-related and are influenced by changes in flow. The following section discusses the 
geochemical response to flow variations in more detail before continuing the discussion 
on metal contents and behaviour in Sections 4.7-4.11. 
4.6: Response to flow variations 
In July 1990 an Al maximum is seen at site Cl with a corresponding drop in pH, Mg and 
Ca (Fig. 4.10). Similar patterns are seen to a lesser extent in C12, C15, C5 and C6 
(Fig. 4.9). These streams appear to show a short term response to local changes in flow 
conditions. 
The response of element concentrations to flow variations as described in Chapter 2.6 is a 
complex function of factors such as rainfall input, preceding weather conditions, 
catchment characteristics etc. The rainfall data immediately preceding the sampling date 
(15th July) do not indicate recent heavy rainfall which could explain the July 1990 peak 
in terms of flushing by a storm event as described by Grimshaw et al. (1976). However, 
the longer term rainfall totals are relatively high. Correlation coefficients between Al and 
rainfall totals at site Cl are listed in Table 4.4 and Fig. 4.11 shows Al variations and 
rainfall totals for 3,7,14 and 21 days prior to sampling. The patterns seen in Fig. 4.11 all 
match fairly well but the July 1990 peak can best be explained by the increase in rainfall 
over a3 week period before sampling. On the day of sampling a large volume of water 
was issuing from the mine drain at Gwynfynydd (G2) along with ochreous seepages from 
the base of the tips and along the banks of the Mawddach even though the previous week 
had been dry. This supports a long (- 3 week) throughflow period in certain parts of the 
catchment in response to the rain falling during a generally very dry period. This 
highlights a problem of sampling on a monthly basis. In some cases, as in July 1990, the 
sample may be taken at a time unrepresentative of the overall seasonal variations. Large 
fluctuations may occur in response to isolated rainfall events but the degree of response, 
and the timing of the maximum or minimum in change will be influenced by local 
characteristics dependant upon such factors as vegetation, altitude, gradient, soil type and 
depth and preceding weather conditions. When interpreting monthly samples the 
possibility of such localised effects must be considered. 
4.7: Ore metals and associated elements 
(Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn, Co and Ni) 
The main ore minerals associated with the vein mineralisation in Coed y Brenin are 
galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Pyrite is abundant in many veins but was not 
considered of economic interest. The breakdown of sulphide minerals releases, not only 
the major constituents of the ores, but also the trace elements found in them. For example, 
Cd and Mn from sphalerite, Co and Ni from pyrite (see Table 1.1). 
Table 4.3 indicates very good correlations between Mn, Zn, Cd, Co and Ni in the river 
waters from Coed y Brenin reflecting their common source. Copper however, shows 
lower correlation with the above elements. In the Coed y Brenin area some copper is 
found associated with the vein mineralisation but the major source of Cu in the area is 
from the disseminated porphyry copper type mineralisation so it will be discussed 
separately in the following section. 
The major influxes of Mn, Zn, Pb, Cd, Co and Ni into the rivers in the Coed y Brenin area 
are from the mine and tip drains from sites G2 and C7 at Gwynfynydd Mine (Table 4.2,

Figs. 4.3 D and E). Examples of monthly variations of these metals, and Cu, are given in 
Fig. 4.12 for selected sites. High autumn/winter and low early spring/summer 
concentrations are seen which suggests that larger volumes of water flowing through 
mines and tips in autumn and winter are capable of dissolving greater quantities of metals 
than the reduced flows in summer. A major source of metals is thus from dissolution of 
oxidised sulphides in waste tips and mines by the through-flow of rainwater. The winters 
of 1989 and 1990 both followed extremely dry summers. Increased oxidation of sulphide 
minerals during hot, dry spells thus exaggerates the flushing effects seen in the following, 
wetter, winter months. A flushing effect is also seen at site C7 (particularly of Mn, Zn and 
Ni), in September 1990, following a period when the tributary was dry (Fig. 4.12. A). 
Variations in pH are also shown in Fig. 4.12. The general trend of low autumn/winter and 
high spring/summer values will promote greater dissolution of metals during the wetter 
months suggesting that low pH levels also contribute to the elevated metal concentrations 
during periods of high flow. 
At site Cl, which drains the Cwm Heisian Issa mine, as well as Al, Cu and Mn show 
peaks in July 1990 (Fig. 4.12. B) indicating the same delayed flushing event as described 
in Section 4.6. Zinc however behaves very differently. Zinc concentrations are relatively 
low and show no obvious seasonal trend, suggesting that Zn may be from a different 
source to the Mn and Cu at this site. This will be discussed further in Section 4.8. 
Mn is only slightly mobile in oxidising environments of pH 5-8 but at lower pH and 
under reducing conditions it becomes moderately mobile (see Table 2.2). In the Coed y 
Brenin area the mobility of Mn is evidenced by the occurrence of Mn02 precipitates, 
known as wad, on fault surfaces, in crevices and in vugs in quartz veins, etc. The seasonal 
variations in background Mn (site C5) are shown in Fig. 4.13. A. A significant drop in 
concentration occurs in the summer months in response to changes in flow and 
conditions. pH values increased during the dry summer of 1990 which may in part be 
responsible for the drop in Mn concentrations. It is also possible that the reduced volume 
of water in the river helped to increase oxygenation thus leading to precipitation of 
insoluble Mn02. 
Changes in Mn concentrations at site Cl relative to the background at C5 are shown in 
Fig. 4.13. B as ratios of site Cl/site C5. A relative increase in Mn 'during the summer 
months is seen although overall totals drop, viz. the proportion of Mn-contaminated mine 
drainage input increases. 
In this study area Zn occurs at significant concentrations only in the Mawddach (11-220 
. tgL-1) with major point sources from Gwynfynydd mine and tips sites G2 and C7 (Zn 
concentrations 1,850-10,030 and 980-7,700 ggL-1 respectively). Additional inputs occur 
via seepage from tips at Gwynfynydd, the Cwm Heisians and Bedd-y-coedwr. These 
inputs have a long lasting effect downstream, (Figs. 4.3. E, 4.24 and 4.25), with the Zn 
remaining in solution under the low pH conditions in the Mawddach. The mean Zn 
concentration at site G9,5 km downstream of the main mines and tips at Gwynfynydd, is 
still 25 ggL-1 (GM = 24 tgL-1) compared to mean background Zn of 5.4 ggL-1 (GM = 
5.2 pgL-1) at C5 (see also Section 4.11). 
The high concentrations of Zn seen and the persistence downstream reflects the high 
solubility/mobility of Zn in the secondary environment (see Chapter 2.2 and Table 2.2). 
In addition, sphalerite is commonly found in tip material because for much of the mining 
period it was considered a waste product (Chapter 1.2). Thus greater volumes of ZnS are 
likely to be available for oxidation than, for example, PbS which was of economic 
interest (see below). 
Cd and Zn 
Cadmium is detected only in the mine drains C7 and G2, reaching 54 gL-1. Its main 
source is from sphalerite where it occurs in trace amounts (0.1-0.5%, Wakita and Schmitt, 
1970; see also Table 1.1). At site C7 (Fig. 4.14. A) Cd mimics the behaviour of Zn very 
closely, shown in a high correlation coefficient (r=0.994). Both Zn and Cd show peaks of 
concentration in autumn/winter, low concentrations in spring/summer and a flushing peak 
in September 1990 following a period of no runoff. The Zn/Cd ratios are remarkably 
consistent (Table 4.5) and are in line with findings from elsewhere in Wales (Table 4.6). 
This is consistent with the closely related geochemical behaviour of Zn and Cd 
(Levinson, 1980; Fuge et al., 1993a). 
At site G2 the situation is very different (Fig. 4.14. B, Table 4.7). This drain is the result of 
an outburst of contaminated, ochreous water from Gwynfynydd Mine in May 1990 which 
had presumably been building up since the closure of the mine at the end of 1989. The 
new outflow was sampled the week after the incident and monthly from then on.

Concentrations of Zn have dropped steadily with time from 10,000 ggL-1 to 
approximately 2,000 ggL-1 whilst Cd remained in the range 12-15 ggL-1 from May 1990 
to January 1991 and then fell to 6-9 gL-1. Overall there is a smaller relative decrease in 
Cd than Zn and thus the Zn/Cd ratio, which was initially very high, decreases from 884, 
unusually high for mine drainage in Wales (Table 4.6) to 196 which is more typical. A 
poor correlation is seen between Zn and Cd (r=0.534). 
The outflow drainage at site G2 is extremely ochreous. High Zn/Cd ratios (upto 760) have 
also been described from ochreous waters from Cwmystwyth, Cwmrheidol and Fan 
Mines in mid-Wales (Fuge et al., 1993a, see Table 4.6). It has been proposed by Fuge et 
al. (1993a) that the precipitation of ochre has a controlling influence on the concentration 
of Cd in waters by the preferential scavenging of Cd relative to Zn. Immediately 
following the outburst at the Gwynfynydd mine precipitation of large amounts of ochre 
took place from the Fe-rich waters which had built up in the mine. The subsequent 
decreasing Zn/Cd ratio is likely to be the result of decreasing ochre precipitation as the 
drainage waters became less Fe-rich (Fuge et al., 1993a). 
Co and Ni 
Cobalt and Ni are detected only at sites C7, G2 and Cl (see Table 4.2). These elements 
are found in trace amounts in pyrite (see Table 1.1) and are released on its breakdown. 
The relatively high levels in the major mine and tip drains at Gwynfynydd  where large 
amounts of pyrite occur in the mineral veins are therefore to be expected. Site Cl has 
much lower levels of Co and Ni than the major contaminated streams (max. 10 and 6 
gL-1 respectively) but these values are still significantly higher than those recorded 
from all other streams in the area. This stream runs close to the site of Cwm Heisian Issa 
mine and the Co and Ni content, together with quite low pH (mean 5.0) probably reflects 
the presence of a substantial amount of pyrite in the tip material. 
Lead, in the form of PbS, was the main metal extracted from the Cwm Heisian, Tyddyn- 
gwladys and Gwynfynydd mines.. The weathering product of galena, PbS04, is relatively 
insoluble and therefore Pb is not seen in any great concentrations in mine drainage 
waters. The outflow from Gwynfynydd Mine (site G2) showed a maximum Pb 
concentration of 170 gL'1 and the main A. Mawddach showed a maximum of 3.7 gL-1 
Pb at site C6. 
The seasonal variations in Pb concentrations, seen for example at site C7, 'follow a similar 
pattern to metals such as Zn and Mn and the sulphate anion reflecting their mutual source 
ie. the vein mineralisation. Higher Pb concentrations are seen in the wetter autumn/winter 
months due to washing out of metals by increased flow through waste tip material. 
4.8: Copper 
No significant levels of Cu are seen in the main rivers Mawddach and Wen (Fig. 4.3. F) 
(max. 4.6 gL-1 in A. Wen, 13 ggL-1 in A. Mawddach). Only tributaries draining 
mineralised areas and some mine waste tips contain appreciable Cu concentrations (see 
Table 4.2). Two different types of Cu-rich waters occur in the area: (i) those with high Zn 
content (C7 and G2), which are associated with quartz vein mineralisation "which is rich 
in chalcopyrite in places (Huddart, 1904; Gilbey, 1969) and (ii) waters containing little or 
no Zn which are associated with the copper dominant deposits of Glasdir in the south of 
the area and the porphyry copper deposit near Dolfrwynog. A graph' showing Cu against 
Zn (Fig. 4.15) clearly shows these 2 groups of waters. Sites Cl and C2 (from Cwm 
Heisian Issa Mine) plot with the Zn-poor samples. Gilbey (1969) recognised 2 different 
mineral assemblages in the veins of the area; pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite dominant and 
sphalerite-galena dominant veins. The vein worked at Cwm Heisian Issa appears to have 
been pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite dominant which would account for the fact that it is 
described as an unsuccessful Pb mine by Hall (1975). This also explains the low Zn 
concentrations of the waters (Fig. 4.12. B) and the relatively high pyrite content of tip 
material seen at Cwm heisian Issa, discussed in Section 4.7. 
In general the Cu anomalies only have a limited extent, which is in line with the findings 
of Cooper (1976). Tributaries draining areas of Cu mineralisation contain Cu 
concentrations of up to 128 ggL-1 at Cwm Heisian Issa Mine (site Cl), 885 ggL-1 at 
Gwynfynydd Mine (site C7), 502 ggL-1 at Glasdir (site C15), 281 ggL-1 in drainage 
from Turf Copper (site C3) and 77 pgL-1 in drainage from the porphyry copper type 
mineralisation (site C12). Anomalous levels, however, are not seen in the main rivers in 
the area. For example, the maximum Cu concentration in the Mawddach 100m below 
Gwynfynydd Mine (site C6) is 10 tgL-1, mean 3.7 tgL-1. 
The common oxidation product of chalcopyrite is CuSO4 which is soluble. The mobility 
of Cu may be limited by precipitation or adsorption on organic matter of Fe and Mn 
oxides and hydroxides (Levinson, 1980). This is probably the case in waters in the Coed 
y Brenin area which are both peaty and show evidence of oxide and hydroxide

precipitation (see Section 4.7 
Other possible reasons for the limited Cu mobility are the reduced solubility with 
increased pH when tributaries enter the main river although this seems unlikely as pH 
values in the Mawddach are relatively low (means 5.5-5.9). However, Cu concentrations 
are likely to be somewhat reduced on entering the main river by straight forward dilution. 
The dissolution and transport of copper from the disseminated porphyry copper type 
deposit and subsequent deposition in Cu-rich bogs has attracted much attention from 
previous authors (eg. Mehrtens et al., 1973; Farago et al., 1980; Andrews and Fuge, 1985, 
1986). Groundwater has long been considered important in the transport of Cu and is 
considered to be the major process of Cu migration in the Coed y Brenin area (Ramsay, 
1881; Mehrtens et al., 1973; Boyle, 1977; Al Ajely et al., 1984; Andrews and Fuge, 
1985). Transport of Cu by groundwater in Coed y Brenin is evident from the precipitation 
of secondary Cu minerals as seen in Plate 4.6 where groundwater seeps through the rock 
face. The groundwater seepages from Turf Copper analysed during this study have much 
higher Cu than surface waters (682-1,016 . tgL-1 and 281 . gL-1 respectively) and 
concentrations as high as 1,440 4gL-1 Cu in groundwater have been recorded from the 
area by Andrews and Fuge (1985). Evidence of the movement of Cu is also seen in pyrite 
samples from the area which show Cu replacing Fe (R. Fuge, pers. comm. ). This suggests 
a process similar to supergene enrichment of Cu-sulphide deposits whereby Cu is 
mobilised in an oxidising, weathering zone and transported downwards below the water 
table where it precipitates in the reducing environment. Cooper (1976) suggests the 
solubility of Cu in the Coed y Brenin area is promoted by the fine grained, dispersed 
nature of the porphyry copper deposit and the presence of acid groundwater from 
breakdown of pyrite and chalcopyrite. Copper is subsequently precipitated in the reducing 
environment of the bog areas in association with accumulated organic matter (Andrews 
and Fuge, 1986). 
Seasonal variations in Cu generally show high winter/low summer values (Figs. 4.12 and 
4.16) with the exception of the surface drainage on Turf Copper (sites C10 and C11, 
Fig. 4.16). Site C10, at the higher end of Turf Copper shows fairly constant levels with 2 
peaks, during August 1990 and January 1991. At Cll, in the middle of the bog, 
concentrations are highly variable and show no obvious seasonal pattern. The surface 
waters over Turf Copper are dominated by the Cu-rich groundwaters and as such will be 
very susceptible to water-humic rh4iFer, interactions. These will produce variable Cu 
concentrations dependant upon changes in conditions such as pH, Eh and rate of 
throughflow of water. Site C3 is the same drain from Turf Copper 0.4 km downstream 
from C11. Here the more "normal" pattern of high winter/low summer concentrations, as 
seen in other surface streams, is apparent. It is likely that away from the bog area water- 
humic matter interactions are not influencing the Cu content to the same extent. 
4.9: Rare earth elements (REE) 
Table 4.8 shows the concentrations of REE found in the contaminated drainage at 
Gwynfynydd along with average concentrations quoted by Martin and Whitfield (1983) 
and Goldstein and Jacobsen (1988). The concentrations found at Gwynfynydd are 
typically up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the average in natural freshwaters. 
The REE are not reported as being (typically) associated with quartz-sulphide vein 
mineralisation as most sulphides are not good hosts for the REE (Cullers and Graf, 1984). 
REE have been reported in carbonate gangue materials, where they substitute for Ca, 
from Pb-Zn deposits in Colorado, Missouri and Germany (Jarvis et al., 1975; Mller et 
al., 1979). The carbonate gangue material in the sulphide veins in Coed y Brenin is 
therefore considered to be a possible source of the REE in the drainage waters at 
Gwynfynydd. 
Monthly variations in La and Ce at site C7 (Fig. 4.17) follow patterns very similar to other 
metals (Mg, Ca and Al - Fig. 4.18, Cu, Zn, Pb etc. Fig. 4.12. A). The REE also show good 
correlation with Ca, Mg and Sr (see Table 4.9) which supports the suggestion that the 
REE could be associated with the carbonate gangue minerals in the vein mineralisation. 
REE concentrations are often presented graphically as values' normalised to o an external 
reference, usually chondrites in the case of igneous rocks (Henderson, 1984), or a 
composite of 40 North American shales (NASC) in the case of sedimentary rocks and 
waters (Haskin eta., 1968). 
REE abundances in the drainage at Gwynfynydd normalised to NASC are shown in 
Fig. 4.19. A. The patterns are relatively low in the heavy REE (HREE) and to a lesser 
extent, the light REE (LREE) relative to Eu, Gd and Tb and they show slight negative Ce 
anomalies. This differs from general REE patterns found in uncontaminated major rivers 
(Fig. 4.19. B) which tend to show flat or slightly HREE enriched patterns relative to NASC 
(Martin et al., 1976; Goldstein and Jacobsen, 1988). It is not possible to say whether the

patterns seen at Gwynfynydd are a reflection of mineral chemistry or of the behaviour of 
the REE in the secondary environment, or a combination of both although it has been 
suggested by Read et al. (1982) that REE patterns in river waters are controlled mainly by 
the relative hydration energies of individual REE and not by the pattern in the 
weathering material. 
This study has illustrated the potential for the use of ICP-MS for further research on REE 
behaviour. 
4.10: Other elements 
Strontium and Ba values are generally very low and show little variation within the area 
(2.5-30 pgL-1 and <1-24 tgL-1 respectively). The exception to this is where Sr is slightly 
elevated (up to 45 tgL-1) in the mine and tip drains (C7 and G2). This probably reflects 
minor amounts of Sr present in carbonate gangue material of the mineral veins. Chlorine 
also shows only limited variation across the area (7.5-23 mgL-1). However, these 
elements and others such as I and Br show wide variations between the different areas of 
study reflecting larger scale differences in geology and mineralisation. This is discussed 
in detail in Chapter 8. Sulphate concentrations are also discussed in Chapter 8. 
4.11: Impact of mine drainage on the A. Mawddach 
Source of metals 
The impact of the outburst from Gwynfynydd Mine in May 1990 on the downriver 
geochemistry of the Mawddach was studied monthly from May 1990 to July 1991 (sites 
C5, C6, G5, G7, G8 and G9, Fig. 4.1). Within one week of the incident a thick, ochreous 
precipitate of Fe-oxide had coated the course of the outflow (Plate 4.7). Further 
precipitation of ochre produced an orange plume where the outflow entered the 
Mawddach (Plates 4.8 and 4.9) and an ochreous coating was visible on the river bed for 
over several kilometres downstream. 
The water chemistry of the outflow from Gwynfynydd Mine in May 1990 is shown in 
Table 4.10. Extremely high Ca, Mg, Al, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, etc., which are 
commonly associated with contaminated mine drainage waters (Kelly, 1991) are seen but 
in addition significant concentrations of the REE (see Section 4.9) and traces of U and Ti 
are detected.

period of no runoff. The variations seen at site C6 do not follow the same pattern of highs 
and lows and no elevated concentrations are seen in September 1990 in response to the 
flushing of high concentrations of metals by the stream, seen at site C7. It is possible that 
the initial runoff after the dry spell produced a flushing effect in the main river of only a 
few hours duration as described by Grimshaw et al. (1976) but this is not seen because of 
the sampling scheme. However, it appears unlikely that the inputs from site C7 'have a 
dominant influence on the chemical variations seen in the Mawddach, even though it does 
contribute significant metal concentrations. 
The variations in Ca and Mg seen at site C6 in the months following the outburst 
correspond fairly well with variations in the inputs from G2. For example, a fall in the 
relative increase (concentrations at site C6/site C5 on Fig. 4.23) is observed in July 1990 
when there is a decrease in concentrations input from G2 (Fig. 4.21). Manganese and Zn 
show similar patterns of response at site C6 but these bear no relationship to their 
respective variations in concentration from the outflow and, as discussed above the 
observed patterns do not appear to be in response to other surface drainage in the area 
(site C7). Therefore, a major control on the chemical variations observed must be 
attributed to variations in the chemistry and/or volume of groundwater inputs. 
Downstream impact of the mine drainage 
Metal concentrations along the downstream profile of the Mawddach are shown in 
Fig. 4.24. These show a sharp increase in the concentrations of all metals below the mine. 
Concentrations decrease downstream from the mine, presumably by a combination of 
dilution, precipitation and adsorption processes. However, due to the low pH conditions 
of the Mawddach the concentrations of some metals such as Al, Mn and Zn remain 
significantly elevated at concentrations above background for over 5 km downriver from 
the main mining area. 
Fig. 4.25 shows how the downstream impact of Zn concentrations lessens after August 
1990. This corresponds with decreasing concentrations in the outflow G2 which, as 
discussed above, has a major influence on river chemistry, at least during the first few 
months following the outburst. By March 1991, when the lowest metal inputs from G2 
were recorded, only slight increases in concentration are seen due to mine drainage 
inputs. 
4.12: Summary 
Former mining activities in the Coed y Brenin area have a significant impact on river 
water chemistry today. Drainage water from Gwynfynydd Mine and tip drainage, in 
particular from Gwynfynydd but also from the Cwm Heisians, Bedd-y-coedwr and 
Tyddyn Gwladys (see Fig. 4.1), is contaminated with metals such as Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn and 
Cu. The contaminated waters are input to the A. Mawddach and have a significant effect 
on the chemistry of the main river. Groundwater inputs also have a strong control on the 
geochemistry of the Mawddach. 
The Mawddach is generally quite acidic due to a combination of organic acid inputs, acid 
mine drainage, the influence of coniferous plantations and the lack of neutralising bases. 
Metal inputs (eg. Zn, Mn, Al) from mine and tip drainage therefore remain in solution for 
a long distance (>5 km) downstream from the mining area. 
pH values in the A. Wen are generally near-neutral because it receives less input of 
organic acids than the Mawddach and also has a higher basic ion content which acts as a 
buffer neutralising acidity. 
Calcium and Mg show seasonal variations with high concentrations in summer and lower 
concentrations in autumn and winter. With the exception of elevated Ca and Mg in mine 
drainage water, due to dissolution of calcite gangue, Ca and Mg concentrations are a 
reflection of the geology of the catchment areas (see Section 4.5). These background 
levels are diluted by increased flow in wetter months. Other metals discussed (Al, Mn, 
Zn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb and Cu) tend to show a reversed pattern of high winter/low summer 
concentrations suggesting greater dissolution of oxidised sulphide minerals with 
increased flow. pH is lower during the winter which also aids dissolution of metals. 
Aluminium in particular is controlled by pH with low pH tending to produce high Al 
concentrations in river waters. 
Metal concentrations in the Mawddach were found to be well above the EEC 
recommended levels adopted by the Welsh Office (EEC Directive, 1978; Welsh Office, 
1985) for soft water supporting salmonoid fish of 30 pgL-1 Zn. Concentrations above this 
level are seen to persist for at least 5 km downstream from Gwynfynydd Mine. The major 
threat to water wildlife from the Gwynfynydd outburst was the precipitation of ochre. 
Colloids or fine suspended particles in the water have an adverse effect on the biota by 
preventing light penetration, causing abrasion and by coating stream beds and smothering

benthic organisms (Kelly, 1991). 
The A. Wen is relatively free from heavy metal contamination as little mineralisation 
occurs in the vicinity. 
Copper contamination of waters in the vicinity of the porphyry copper type deposit is not 
the result of former mining activity but is a natural phenomenon due to the passage of 
acidic groundwaters through the dispersed Cu deposit. 
The transport of Cu is predominantly by groundwater rather than in surface drainage and 
organic matter appears to have a strong control on reducing the mobility of Cu as evident 
by the enrichment of Cu in the bog areas.

CHAPTER 5: LLANGYNOG 
5.1: Introduction 
The village of Llangynog is situated on the southern edge of the Berwyn Mountains in 
North Powys, approximately 16 km SE of Bala (see Fig. 1.2, Fig. 5.1). Two steep sided 
glaciated valleys, Cwm Rhiwarth and Cwm Pennant, carrying the Afon Eirth and Afon 
Tanat respectively, meet at Llangynog (SJ 053262, approximately 160m O. D. ). Below the 
confluence the A. Tanat flows eastwards over a wide, alluvial plain bounded by steep 
valley sides. Good pasture grazing covers much of the valley floor. The valley sides are 
in many parts scree covered and rise to a plateau at around 450m providing rough grazing 
land for sheep. There are several abandoned metal mines and quarries in the area, shown 
on Fig. 5.1. 
Geology. 
The rocks in the area are predominantly Ordovician mudstones with some shales, 
siltstones, calcareous tuffs, limestones, rhyolitic tuffs and lava flows (Fig. 5.2). To the 
west and north of Llangynog village is a large quartz-feldspar porphyritic intrusion. The 
area has been domed by the Berwyn anticline which has a roughly E-W axis. 
Mineralisation is confined mainly to faults trending E-W or ENE-WSW and appears to be 
closely associated with the acid igneous rocks (Smith and Dewey, 1922). The most 
extensive mineralisation is immediately around Llangynog village, associated with the 
quartz-feldspar porphyry. Galena and sphalerite are the main ore minerals with lesser 
amounts of barite, witherite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. The gangue material is mostly 
quartz, carbonate minerals and brecciated country rock. Unrelated to the vein 
mineralisation, but once of economic importance, are nodular phosphate bands occurring 
near the base of the Nod Glas Black Shale which is a sequence of interbedded shales and 
phosphatic limestones of late Caradoc age (Cave, 1965). 
Mining history 
Mining has been carried out in the area possibly as far back as the Iron Age (Williams, 
1985). Production peaked during the first half of the eighteenth century in contrast to 
other mining centres in mid-Wales which were most active in the nineteenth century. 
Llangynog lead mine on the south side of the village was by far the most important mine 
in the area, its output ranking amongst the most productive mines in mid-Wales 
(Williams, 1985). Several smaller mines and trials occur in the area and a smelter near 
Llangynog (SJ 063268) was active during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
(Williams, 1985). Phosphate from the Nod Glas Black Shales was mined at 3 sites in the 
area intermittently from about 1874 to 1884 and used in the manufacture of fertilisers. 
Most mining in the area ceased with the closure of Llangynog mine in 1899 and the last 
two operational mines, Cwm Orog and Craig-y-mwyn, north of Llangynog Village, had 
closed by the end of 1912. Slate was extracted from the area during the nineteenth 
century and the rhyolitic intrusion around Llangynog was quarried during the first half of 
the twentieth century for aggregate (Wren, 1968). 
Heavy metal contamination of soils in the area was first identified by Paveley (1988) and 
soil and stream sediment contamination are described by Fuge et al. (1989). 
Sample sites 
Fourteen river water sites, numbered on Fig. 5.1 and briefly described in Table 5.1 were 
sampled monthly from November 1989 to July 1991. 
5.2: Results 
Analytical data for each site are summarised in Table 5.2. It is apparent that here, as in 
Coed y Brenin, wide variations occur on a monthly scale at individual sites as well as 
notable differences between sites. Figs. 5.3. A-F show the mean concentrations for those 
metals '(Al, Mg, Ca, Mn, Zn and Ba) which occur in significant concentrations (>10 gg 
L-1) at all or most sites and which show spatial variations. These elements, along with Pb 
and Cd are discussed in more detail in the following sections. Some of the other elements 
eg. Cu and Rb occur only at very low levels (mostly <1 ggL-1, but with maximum values 
for Cu and Rb of 5.8 and 3.3 ggL-1 respectively). Some elements such as Br, Sr and Cl 
are found at higher levels but little variation is seen between each site within the 
Llangynog area. Wider variations in the concentrations of these elements are seen 
between the different study areas and these are discussed in Chapter 8. 
Rainfall data for the Llangynog area is available from the Rhiwlas station (SJ 114260), 6 
km east of Llangynog village near Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant (altitude 228m A. M. S. L. ). 
As described in Chapter 4.2, rainfall totals for the day before sampling and the totals for, 
the previous 3,5,7,10,14 and 21 days (Fig. 5.4) were used to examine the relationship, 
between rainfall totals and variation in water chemistry.

Fig. 5.4: Rainfall totals (mm) at Meteorological Office Rhiwlas 
Station for 1,3,5,7,10,14, and 21 days prior to 
sampling and for whole month. 
5.3: pH 
pH values are generally near-neutral, with mean values from most sites being in the range 
6.0-6.6. Fig. 5.5 shows typical monthly variations from selected sites. A pattern of high 
summer/low winter values, corresponding with low and high flows respectively is seen as 
described in Chapter 4.3 and by other authors (eg. Bull and Hall; 1986). An exception to 
the near neutral values with only minor variations is seen at a high, moorland site (L2) 
where large fluctuations in pH (4.35-6.9) are seen, again related to variations in flow. The 
high acidity is a result of the input of humic acids from peat and the stream water at this 
site is often brown and foamy due to high organic matter content. Table 5.4 shows the 
correlation coefficients between pH and rainfall totals prior to sampling. There is an 
inverse relationship with the best correlation seen between pH and the rainfall total for 5 
-prior 
to sampling (Fig. 5.6). This suggests that the throughflow of water which 
washes humic acids from peat is fairly rapid and through shallow, near surface soil 
horizons. The correlation over the whole 21 months of sampling suggests that the 
changing vegetation and weather conditions in different seasons does not have a strong 
influence on the rate of near surface throughflow. 
As well as increases in acidity due to high inputs of humic acids site L2 shows the lowest 
Ca levels in the area (mean 2,115 gL-1, cf. means of 3,020-11,210 pgL-1 at all other 
sites) and thus has the least buffering capacity to neutralise acidic inputs. No other sites 
show such dramatic fluctuations of pH (see Table 5.2) because (i) they are not subject to 
such great inputs of humic acids and (ii) their higher base content enables buffering of 
any acid inputs. 
The pH levels of tip drainage at Llangynog Mine (site L7) range from 5.7-6.9 and those at 
Cwm Orog Mine (site L4a) are in the range" 5.7-6.7. The relatively low acidity (cf. pH 
values as low as 3.2 from Gwynfynydd Mine drainage in Coed y Brenin, Chapter 4.3) 
suggests little pyrite oxidation in the area. The levels of Co and Ni seen in the area are 
low (Table 5.2) with maxima of 9 tgL-1 Ni and 3 gL-1 Co recorded from site U. 
Cobalt and Ni are found as trace elements in pyrite and are released on oxidation (see 
Chapter 1, Table 1.1) so their low concentrations seen in streams in the area suggest that 
only small volumes of pyrite are present in the mineralisation. There is also an absence of 
ochre precipitation which is generally associated with the oxidation of pyrite and 
production of acid mine drainage. Additionally, it may be that greater dissolution of 
carbonate gangue minerals provides sufficient basic cations to neutralise any acidity 
produced as suggested by the high Ca concentrations (up to 16,000 tgL-1 at site L7). 
5.4: Al 
Aluminium concentrations are generally <150 pgL-1 (Fig. 5.3. A, Table 5.2) with lower 
values relating to low flow in summer (May-September 1990, April onwards in 1991. 
Examples are given in Figs. 5.7. A and B). Table 5.5 shows correlation coefficients for Al 
concentrations at each site with rainfall totals prior to the sampling day. Al concentrations 
at most sites correlate well with rainfall totals for 1 or 3 days prior to sampling 
(Fig. 5.7. A) suggesting Al concentrations are directly related to changes in flow. Peaks in 
Al concentration, for example in February, April and December 1990 and March 1991, 
correspond with high rainfall totals for 1 or 3 days prior to sampling. Low Al 
concentrations coincide with periods of low rainfall prior to sampling. Correlations 
between Al content and rainfall totals at sites L3, L6, L7, L10 and L12 however are poor, 
reflecting more complex rainfall-response relationships (Fig. 5.7. B). Site L12, in 
particular, (the stream draining Cwm Hirnant at Penybontfawr) shows large fluctuations 
in Al (30-456 gL-1) and has much higher Al concentrations than other sites in the area. 
Most of the peaks correlate roughly with the previous day's rainfall and it thus appears 
that this stream shows unusually large increases in Al as an immediate response to 
increasing flow. 
The inverse correlation between Al and pH due to increasing Al solubility with 
decreasing pH, discussed in Chapter 4.4 and by previous authors (eg. Bull and Hall, 1986; 
Birchall and Chappell, 1988) is not obvious in the Llangynog area (Fig. 5.8). The 
correlation coefficient (r=-0.200) between Al and pH in the area is not significant. Some 
sites do show an inverse correlation between Al and pH (Table 5.6, Fig. 5.9. A) although at 
sites such as L8 the pH variations are only very small for large changes in Al. Sites L6, 
L7, L10, L11 and L12 do not show significant correlations between Al and pH (Fig. 5.9. B, 
Table 5.6). Also, at site L2, where pH values are the lowest in the area, Al concentrations 
are not significantly higher than at other sites with higher pH levels (see Table 5.2) 
indicating that the dissolution of Al is not significantly increased by the low pH of the 
waters at site L2. 
The differing behaviour of Al seen in the Llangynog area, cf. Coed y Brenin where it is 
pH controlled, suggests it may be present in solution in a different form, possibly as an 
organic complex. The close relationship of Al concentrations with rainfall suggests that 
elevated Al contents result from increased washing out of Al or Al complexes by the 
increased rate of throughflow in near surface soil horizons.

5.5: Ca and Mg 
Calcium and Mg contents are relatively high with mean concentrations in the A. Tanat of 
4,069-6,026 pgL-1 Ca cf. 2,166-2,698 tgL-1 in the A. Mawddach in Coed y Brenin 
(Chapter 4.5). This is presumably a reflection of the background geology. The Llangynog 
Formation of the Ordovician sediments in the area (Fig. 5.2) contain calcareous tuffs and 
limestone sequences (BGS Sheet 136). The Pen-y-Garnedd Limestone and Nod Glas 
Black Shale, with bands of phosphatic limestone, (Cave, 1965) also outcrop in'the area. 
The rivers in the Llangynog area are thus well buffered as seen by the near-neutral pH 
values and narrow range of fluctuations in acidity discussed above in Section 5.3. 
Large concentrations of Ca and Mg are seen at the tip drainage at site L7 (see Figs. 5.3. B 
and Q. Concentrations up to 16,070 tgL-1 Ca and 7,940 tgL-1 Mg are seen resulting 
from the, dissolution of carbonate gangue minerals, calcite and possibly ankerite. 
However, these large inputs do not appear to have a significant impact on the 
geochemistry of the main river. For example, the mean Ca concentration in the A. Tanat at 
site L8, above the input from L7, is 4,736 pgL-1 and at site L11, below the input and after 
the confluence with the A. Eirth (with mean Ca 5,211 tgL-1) the mean Ca concentration 
of the Tanat increases only slightly to 4,838 gL-1. 
Fig. 5.10 shows examples of monthly variations in Ca and Mg concentrations and pH. 
Calcium showed some elevation in concentration during the dry summer of 1990 
suggesting a dilution effect occurred with increasing rainfall in the winter months. 
Magnesium showed very similar behaviour to Ca (correlation coefficient r=0.893). High 
Ca and Mg concentrations roughly correspond with increases in pH although the 
correlation coefficients between Ca, Mg and pH in the area are not significant (Table 
5.3). Calcium and magnesium show generally poor correlation with Al (Table 5.3, 
Fig. 5.10) presumably due to the lack of pH control on Al concentrations discussed above. 
At a number of sites, such as-L8, L9, L12 and L13, low Al concentrations are associated 
with elevated Ca and Mg during the summer of 1990. Dips in Ca and Mg concentrations 
in July 1990 also correspond with peaks in Al concentration. However, in general it 
appears that the very close inter-relationship of seasonal variations in Mg, Ca, Al and pH, 
described from Coed y Brenin and by other authors (eg. Bull and Hall, 1986) is not seen 
in the Llangynog area. 
5.6: Mn 
Manganese concentrations in the Llangynog area are low (Table 5.2, Fig. 5.3. D). With the 
exception of sites L1, L2 and L7 Mn levels are <36 pgL-1, and mean values <15 tgL-1, 
cf. means of 34-153 tgL-1 Mn in the A. Mawddach in Coed y Brenin. 
Manganese shows poor or no significant correlation with other metals (Table 5.3). This is 
in contrast to the behaviour of Mn described from Coed y Brenin (Chapter 4.7) where it is 
closely associated with sulphide minerals such as pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite. 
Fig. 5.11 shows the seasonal variations of Mn and Zn at the tip drainage site U. The 
correlation of Zn and Mn for the whole of the Llangynog area is not significant. 
Sphalerite may be an important host'of Mn but analysis of sphalerites from Llangynog 
Mine revealed Mn contents of 38-475 ppm, cf. 3,422 and 3,357 ppm in sphalerites from 
Coed -y Brenin. (The sphalerite analyses are discussed further in Section 5.7, below). 
Pyrite, and chalcopyrite are also potential hosts for Mn and their low abundance in the 
Llangynog area may contribute to the low Mn concentrations in mine drainage. The low 
Mn concentrations together with the absence of correlation with Zn suggest there is little 
Mn associated with the vein mineralisation in this area. ' 
The highest Mn concentrations in the Llangynog area are associated with the Berwyn 
Mine (site L2) where phosphate was mined from nodular bands in the Nod Glas Black 
Shale. The Nod Glas deposits of this area were formed on a rising shelf starved of coarse 
detritus (Cave, 1965) producing conditions favourable for phosphorite formation 
(Kazakov, 1939). Deposition of phosphates may occur in association with ferric and 
manganese oxyhydroxides (Smith, 1987) and thus the phosphate bands are a likely source 
of the high Mn at the Berwyn Mine (site L2). 
Seasonal variations in Mn at site L2 (Fig. 5.12) show generally higher concentrations 
during the dry summer of 1990 and a dry period'in December 1989. There'is an inverse 
correlation with rainfall totals with the best fit for rainfall totals of 14 days prior to 
sampling (Table 5.7, Fig. 5.12). This contrasts with the response of pH to rainfall at this 
site (Section 5.3) which shows the strongest correlation with rainfall for 3 days prior to 
sampling at this site. The Mn inputs appear to be dominated by a deep groundwater flow 
from which concentrations will be fairly stable (Levinson, 1980). Highest Mn 
concentrations are seen during dry periods when groundwater flow will be dominant. 
Rainfall (Mn-poor) produces a dilution effect during periods of higher flow.

interest around Llangynog. Former mining activity and contamination from the veins 
themselves has produced elevated levels of Pb, Zn and Cd in soils and stream sediments 
in the area (Paveley, 1988; Fuge et al., 1989). Fuge et al. (1989) reported heavy metal 
contents in soils of 16-4,800 mgkg-1 Pb, 85-5,520 mgkg-1 Zn and 0.1-60 mgkg-1 Cd and 
stream sediment concentrations of 20-13,700 mgkg-1 Pb, 140-4,800 mgkg-1 Zn and 0.1- 
50 mgkg-1 Cd. 
The Zn contents of river water in the area are generally low (<30 gL-i). The two 
exceptions to this are the drainage from Cwm Orog Mine (site L4a) which was found to 
contain up to 230 pgL-1 Zn and the tip drainage from Llangynog Mine (site L7) with up 
to 16,480 gL-l Zn. Background levels in the Tanat above areas where there is evidence 
of former mining (site L9) show a mean Zn value of 6 gL-1 (GM =5 gL-1) but where 
the river passes through the main mining area (site L8) the Tanat contains upto 180 gL-1 
Zn (mean = 42 pgL-1, GM = 30 gL-1) due to polluted inputs mostly from the 
Llangynog Mine and tips. Elevated Zn levels persist for at least 5 km downstream to 
Penybontfawr, where a mean Zn concentration of 23 . tgL-i (GM = 18 tgL-1) is seen). 
Elevated Zn concentrations are expected to persist even further downstream although this 
has not been sampled. 
Zinc concentrations in the Llangynog tip drain (site L7) show high winter/low summer 
values and a flushing peak was seen in July 1990 following a dry period (Fig. 5.13) 
reflecting greater dissolution of oxidising ore minerals with increased throughflow of 
water in the tip material. Increased concentrations also correspond with increases in 
acidity which will cause greater dissolution of minerals. 
Site L7 is the only site where Cd is detected and it mimics closely the behaviour of Zn. 
Excluding the months of August and September 1990, when low concentrations of Zn 
and Cd were found a very good correlation (r=0.905) is seen, and the Zn/Cd ratio is fairly 
constant (69-143, Table 5.8). This ratio is significantly lower than that seen in tip 
drainage in Coed y Brenin (site C7, Zn/Cd = 126-174) as illustrated in Fig. 5.14. It is 
suggested that sphalerites from the Llangynog area are richer in Cd than those from Coed 
y Brenin. This was examined by analysis of sphalerites from both areas by Laser Ablation 
(LA) ICP-MS as described below. 
Sphalerite analyses by LA-ICP-MS 
Laser ablation is a solid sample introduction method which can be used for ICP-MS. A 
VG LaserLab laser was, used for this study. Calibration was made by a semi-quantitative 
technique, similar to that used for solution analysis described in Chapter 3.2.4. A multi- 
element pressed powder briquette standard was used to generate a response curve as 
described by Pearce et al. (1992a, 1992b). Zinc was used as an internal standard at an 
assumed concentration of 64.5 wt %. 2-4 spots were analysed on several sphalerite grains 
from each area. The results are listed in Table 5.9 and are generally in line with the 
findings for sphalerites from elsewhere in Wales (Kakar, 1971; Fuge et al., 1993a). 
The Cd content of sphalerites from Llangynog is significantly higher than in those from 
Coed y Brenin and this is reflected in the Zn/Cd ratios in mine drainage. It must also be 
bourne in mind, however, that the differing behaviour of Zn and Cd in the secondary 
environment will also influence Zn and Cd concentrations in solution. 
In August and September 1990 the Cd concentrations are very low and therefore larger 
analytical errors may be the cause of the high Zn/Cd ratios. It is, however, possibly the 
result of differing behaviour of Zn and Cd in the secondary environment. Cd is a more 
chalcophile element than Zn (Goldschmidt, 1954) so it may remain as insoluble CdS 
while Zn is taken into solution as ZnSO4 (Fuge et al., 1993a). The relatively high Zn 
concentrations at site L7 in August and September 1990 may represent flushing of the 
more soluble Zn. 
Zinc at site L4a also showed higher levels in winter than'in'summer and flushing peaks 
were seen following dry months in June and September 1990 (Fig. 5.15). 
Lead reached the, highest levels seen in the area during February 1990 (Figs. 5.15,5.16) 
corresponding with the highest rainfall prior to sampling seen in the study period. Lead is 
a relatively immobile element (Rose et al., 1979) hence the low concentrations in solution 
(maximum 53 gL-1). Oxidation products of galena such as PbS04 are more soluble than 
the sulphide and this is the likely form in which Pb is washed into the streams from the 
tips by heavy rain. 
Fig. 5.17 shows the seasonal variations in Zn and Pb seen at site L8 which indicates fairly 
good correlation between these elements. The patterns seen are quite variable with large 
peaks in April, October and December 1990 and lesser peaks in February 1990 and 
March 1991. These variations are not observed at other sites or in the behaviour of other 
elements, nor do they correlate with rainfall totals. These erratic peaks are possibly due to

reworking of contaminated river bank sediments. The Tanat at site L8 is adjacent to the 
Llangynog Mine tips and flows through alluvial river sediments which are subject to bank 
erosion and collapse at irregular intervals. High Pb and Zn (and also Cd and Cu) are 
reported in the stream sediments and alluvial soils of the area near the Llangynog tip site 
and downriver for at least 4 km (Fuge et al., 1989). Metal contamination is often greater 
in the subsoils than topsoils and is thought to represent a maximum in metal 
contamination during the peak of mining activity in the 18th and 19th centuries. These 
alluvial soils now act as a source of secondary heavy metal pollution as the river erodes 
into contaminated bank material (Fuge et al., 1989). This behaviour has also been 
described from the valleys of the A. Rheidol, in mid-Wales (Davies and Lewin, 1974; 
Lewin et al., 1977), R. Axe, Somerset (Macklin, 1985) and R. Derwent, Derbyshire (Lewin 
and Macklin, 1986). 
At site L8 episodes of bank collapse or erosion into particularly' contaminated material 
may be the cause of the erratic peaks seen in Pb and Zn concentrations. These elevated 
levels persist some distance downstream, below the confluence with the relatively 
uncontaminated Eirth and, in the case of the more soluble Zn, peaks in concentration are 
still observed at Penybontfawr (site L13) 5 km from Llangynog (Fig. 5.18). 
Secondary pollution of the Tanat may also be occurring at present from reworking of 
contaminated alluvial"soils further downstream from the Llangynog Mine tips but this is 
not evident. This may be a reflection of the sampling scheme in that a short term peak of 
metal concentration could easily be missed in a monthly sampling program or it is quite 
likely that the contaminant levels in the soils downstream, being much lower than those 
adjacent to the mine tip at L8, are insufficient to have a great effect on the water 
chemistry. 
5.8: Ba 
As seen in Fig. 5.3. F the major input of Ba to the river system is from Cwm Orog Mine 
where barite was mined during the 1st World War (Williams, 1985). BaSO4 is relatively 
insoluble but where present in volumes as at Cwm Orog elevated concentrations are seen 
in drainage waters. Barium is found in stream water at site L4a at concentrations of 140- 
247 pgL-l. Slightly elevated levels are seen at sites L7 and L6 (23-61 and 15-45 . tgL-1 
respectively) reflecting some barite content in the vein mineralisation but all other 
concentrations are <27 pgL-l. At the mine drainage sites Ba closely follows the seasonal 
variations of Zn (Figs. 5.15 and 5.16) and is presumably washed out of tip material, along 
with the Zn at greater concentrations with increased throughflow. 
5.9: Summary 
Waters which are acidic due to their humic content are input into the river systems of the 
Llangynog area from the high, peaty moorland at the source of the A. Eirth in the NW of 
the area studied. The rivers of the area are well buffered with basic cations (eg. Ca and 
Mg) and are thus able to neutralise acidity, producing the near-neutral pH. values seen 
throughout. 
The major point sources of contaminant metals into the river systems are from the 
Llangynog and Cwm Orog Mine tips (sites L7 and L4a respectively). Neither of these 
drains are particularly acidic (minimum pH 5.7) but they both show high concentrations 
of Zn and Pb. Pb is not normally detected in the main rivers Eirth and Tanat (maximum 9 
tgL-1) but, below the sites of former mining activity, the more soluble Zn is seen at 
concentrations higher than in samples taken from above the mines. These elevated 
concentrations persist above the background levels for at least 5 km downstream in the 
A. Tanat. However, with the exception of a short stretch of the A. Tanat between 
Llangynog Mine and the confluence with the A. Eirth Zn concentrations in the main rivers 
of the area do not exceed 30 tgL-1 which is the maximum concentration permitted in soft 
waters supporting salmonoid fish (EEC Directive, 1978; Welsh Office, 1985). It is 
therefore suggested that heavy metal contamination of river water by the former Pb-Zn 
mines in the Llangynog area is unlikely to have any great detrimental effect on aquatic 
life in the A. Tanat and A. Eirth. The effects of stream sediments and soils polluted as a 
result of past mining activity (Fuge et al., 1989) are beyond the scope of this study but are 
not ruled out as a possible source of harmful levels of pollutants to plant and animal life 
in the area. 
Seasonal variations of Ca, Mg and Mn tend to show high summer/low winter 
concentrations, suggesting a dilution effect occurs with increasing rainfall input. Other 
metals discussed (Al, Zn, Cd, Ba and, Pb), in contrast, show high winter/low summer 
levels indicating greater leaching or washing out of these elements from soils and tip 
material during high rainfall periods. The variations in pH and element concentrations 
show varying response times to changes in rainfall input, even at the same site. Variable 
response times are also seen between sites. This is illustrated by comparison of metal 
concentrations and pH with rainfall totals for 1,3,5,7,10,14 and 21 days prior to 
sample collection. In general Al and pH variations correlate well with rainfall totals for 1-

5 days prior to sampling. Lead variations at site L4a also correlate with rainfall for the 
previous 3 days. This indicates a fairly rapid response to an increase in rain input and the 
pathway for the water is relatively fast-moving throughflow in near surface soil horizons. 
Manganese variations at L2 show an inverse correlation with rainfall totals. The best 
correlation reflecting maximum dilution of Mn in the baseflow are seen with rainfall 
totals for 14 days prior to sample collection. This suggests slower pathways for the 
passage of the rainfall input and a deeper groundwater source of Mn at site L2. 
The variations described here are influenced by fairly long term changes in flow over 
several days or even weeks rather than short term flushing or lag effects lasting for a 
number of hours seen during storm events described by Grimshaw et al. (1976). Short 
term flushing events tend to result from surface runoff in the initial stages of a storm. The 
responses described above result from the deeper passage of water as throughflow in soil 
horizons or as even deeper groundwater flow. 
A final point of interest seen in the Llangynog area is the possible evidence of secondary 
pollution of the river system by the reworking of contaminated alluvial flood plain 
sediments.

CHAPTER 6: , FLINT 
6.1: Introduction 'f I`- 
The study area around Flint, Clwyd, occupies a coastal strip approximately 7x17 km on 
the southwest side of the Dee Estuary (Fig. 1.1, Fig. 6.1): The topography drops gently 
northeastwards from an altitude of approximately 200m on Halkyn Mountain in the 
southwest to sea level on the shores of the Dee estuary:. This is the-most densely 
populated of the study areas, with the towns of Flint and Holywell, large villages of 
Northop and Bagillt and numerous smaller villages. Much of the remaining area is good 
agricultural land with rougher grazing on the high ground of Halkyn Mountain which is 
much disturbed by mining and quarrying activities. Quarrying is still active today in the 
Carboniferous Limestone. Smelting was carried out in, the area and the sites where 
smelters are thought to have been are shown on Fig. 6.2 along with the mine localities. 
Geology 
The rocks of the study area around Flint (Fig. 6.2) are all Carboniferous in age with strata 
in general dipping gently eastwards (Wedd and King, 1924). The Dinantian Limestone 
forms the high ground of Halkyn Mountain and the area SE of Holywell. Thin bands, <1 
km wide, of the lower Silesian, Millstone Grit and upper Silesian, Coal Measures (2-4 
krn) outcrop northeast of the limestone, roughly parallel to the coast. Recent alluvial 
deposits of the Dee Estuary line the coast. 
Mineralisation 
The ore deposits are found mostly, although not exclusively, in the Carboniferous 
Limestone infilling steeply dipping fault fractures. The main lodes run east-west but a 
number of N-S striking faults are locally 'important (Schnellmann, 1959). The ore 
minerals are almost exclusively' galena and sphalerite with calcite gangue with, in some 
places, fluorite, barite, witherite and chalcopyrite. 
-Mining History 
The lead mines in the Carboniferous Limestone of the former counties of Flintshire and 
Denbighshire (now in Clwyd) were the most productive in Wales (Lewis, 1967). Lead 
mining in the area dates from Roman times with the peak of activity in the latter half of 
the 19th' century. There have been numerous mines ' and trials throughout the region 
(shown on Fig. 6.2), the major mines in the study area being centred around Halkyn 
Mountain. 
Drainage difficulties caused severe problems at mines in the area and activities were hindered 
as few mine promoters were prepared to invest sufficient capital to develop works properly. 
However, the drainage problem was helped by the Halkyn Drainage Tunnel (Fig. 6.2) in the 
late 1870s which drained the mines in an area of about 11 sq. miles around: Halkyn 
(Schnellmann, 1959). In 1897 a second tunnel was begun at sea level from Bagillt to drain , 
mines in the north of the area. This Sea Level or Milwr Tunnel was driven southwards for over 
16 km in the period up to the 1920s. Mining activity declined during the early 20th century 
and Halkyn, the last in operation, closed in 1958. 
Previous research 
The study area formed part of a larger scale geochemical reconnaissance survey by Nichol et 
al. (1970). This highlighted Pb and Zn anomalies in stream sediments in the majority of, 
streams draining the Carboniferous Limestone in the area around Flint which were attributed 
to former mining and smelting activities. Heavy metal contamination of soils in the area is 
reported by Davies and Roberts (1975,1978). They found extensive Cd, Pb, Zn and lesser Cu 
contamination in soils over the mineralised limestone outcrop and also in the vicinity of 
former smelters. "" 
A hydrogeochemical survey of groundwaters in the Derbyshire Dome (Edmunds,  1971) "- 
described waters from a similar geological situation.. Extensive lead-zinc mineralisation is 
found in the Carboniferous Limestone in the Derbyshire Dome and the investigations by 
Edmunds (1971) provide a useful comparison for this study. ,; 
Sample sites 
The highly jointed, permeable nature of the Carboniferous Limestone leads to very := little 
surface drainage over the limestone area (see Figs. 6.1 and 6.2). Two small streams near, Babell 
and several west of Rhosesmor flow south to join the Afon. Alun, a tributary of the Dee. The 
majority of the drainage is northeastwards by small streams flowing directly into the. Dee 
Estuary from springs in the Millstone Grit and Coal Measure rocks. ;  i 
15 stream sites were sampled monthly from December 1989 to July 1991. These are shown on 
Fig. 6.1 and described in Table 6.1. A number of sites were dry during the summer months and 
site F15, an intermittent spring, flowed only on 5 of the 20 sampling days. b. fi 
The samples from Flint were filtered in the field to remove particulate (>0.45 m), Al-bearing 
material (see Chapter 3.3.2). 
Rainfall data are taken from the Meteorological Office station at Bagillt (SJ 219753). 
climate is maritime influenced, but average annual rainfall totals are low because the area is in 
the rainshadow of the Welsh mountains. The annual average rainfall at Bagillt for

--------------------------------------------------------- 
the period 1941-70 is 800 mm compared to annual average rainfall totals of 2100 mm 
from Buarthe Newydd in Coed y Brenin (Chapter 4) and 1190 mm at Rhiwlas, near 
Llangynog (Chapter 5), for the same period. As in the 2 preceding chapters rainfall totals 
for the 1,3,5,7,10,14,21 days prior to sampling and for the whole month (Fig. 6.3) 
were used for comparison with seasonal variations in water chemistry. 
6.2: Results 
Analytical data from each site are summarised in Table 6.2. 
As the majority of the mines were located in the Carboniferous" Limestone (see Fig. 6.2) 
there is very little surface drainage flowing directly through heavy metal contaminated 
material. Much of the surface drainage is some distance from the mining areas so any 
contamination of groundwater is likely to be much reduced by dilution, precipitation 
and/or adsorption processes. 
6.3: pH, Ca and Mg 
Dissolution of the Carboniferous Limestone results in neutral to slightly alkaline (7.0-8.3) 
pH values throughout the area and stream waters are well buffered by high concentrations 
of basic ions such as Ca and Mg. Mean Ca values range from 72,600-105,330 pgL-1 and 
mean Mg concentrations are between 2,630 and 20,500 ggL-1. Fig. 6.4 shows examples 
of pH, Ca and Mg variations. Some sites (eg. sites F11 and F14) show higher Ca and Mg 
concentrations during the summer of 1990. This pattern is seen more commonly for Mg 
(eg. sites F4, F5 and F8) but in general correlation between Ca and Mg is very poor 
(r=0.200, Table 6.3). Correlation between Ca and pH is not significant (r=0.124) and 
between Mg and pH is poor (r=0.483). pH variations at individual sites show only narrow 
ranges (see Table 6.2) and there are no strong patterns of seasonal variations which 
correlate with rainfall as seen in Coed y Brenin and Llangynog. 
6.4: Al 
Concentrations of Al in solution are generally low (means <26 gL'l) as a result of the 
decrease in solubility of Al with increasing pH. 
Aluminium concentrations are also shown in Fig. 6.4 and poor correlation with pH, Ca 
and Mg is seen (see also Table 6.3 and Fig. 6.5). In the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog 
areas pH, Ca, Mg and Al are all closely related to varying rainfall inputs. In the Flint area 
however, the highly jointed nature of the limestone which underlies much of the area and 
the resulting drainage pattern produces extremely complex pathways of rainfall to the 
streams. Thus, although the rainfall inputs in the area (Fig. 6.3) show generally higher 
autumn/winter totals than those of spring and summer (with the exception of high rainfall 
in June, and July 1991) these are not reflected by decreases in pH, Ca and Mg and 
increases in Al with increasing rainfall as seen elsewhere (Chapters 4 and 5; Bull and 
Hall, 1986; Birchall and Chappell, 1988). 
6.5: Mn 
Manganese concentrations are relatively high at all sites (means 8.0-130 . tgL-1). In many 
cases the source of Mn is likely to be the limestone in which appreciable Mn2+ may 
substitute for Ca2+ in calcite due the similar ionic size (Krauskopf, 1979). Typical values 
of the order of 1,100 ppm Mn are found in limestones (Levinson, 1980). At site F10 
concentrations up to 574 gL-1 Mn were observed. Samples from this site also contain 
high levels of Zn, Cd and Pb. The elevated Mn level at this site is attributed to the 
breakdown of Mn-containing sulphide minerals. 
Examples of seasonal variations in Mn concentrations are shown in Fig. 6.6. Sites F5 and 
F8 showed a general summer high/winter low pattern. Sites F1 and F2 tended to have 
high concentrations in winter and site F14 showed a pattern of low concentrations in 
winter and early spring. Other sites show no discernible seasonal patterns. The variations 
seen are not obviously related to changes in chemical conditions or rainfall input and thus 
are likely to be influenced by complex hydrological factors in the groundwater system of 
the area. 
6.6 Zn and Cd 
Mean Zn concentrations for each site are shown in Fig. 6.7. The highest Zn concentrations 
in the Flint area are seen at site F10 (up to 9,020 gL-1 Zn) and this is also the only site 
at which significant Cd concentrations were found (up to 69 gL-l Cd). Zinc and Cd 
show similar behaviour (Fig. 6.8), very good correlation is seen between the two elements 
(r=0.928) and a fairly constant Zn/Cd ratio is seen (Table 6.4). This is in line with 
findings in non-ochreous mine drainage elsewhere in Wales (Chapters 4,5,7, Fuge et al., 
1993a). Zinc concentrations elsewhere in the area range from <1-140 pgL-1 with means 
ranging from 5.3-93 gL-1. 
Seasonal variations of high winter/low summer - Zn concentrations are seen (Fig. 6.9). 
These patterns show a rough correlation with rainfall totals prior to sampling (eg. total for

the 3 previous days shown on Fig. 6.9) which suggests that increased dissolution of Zn 
occurs during periods of higher flow. The nature of the drainage pattern in relation to the 
mineralisation makes identification of the source and pathways of Zn' contamination 
virtually impossible. It is likely that percolating rainwater and groundwater in contact 
with tip material and/or mineral lodes becomes contaminated and thus Zn (and other 
metals) may be carried by groundwater. The' complex' nature of the throghflow of 
groundwater in which dilution of contaminated water and the precipitation of metals can 
occur to varying extents may account for the great variability in metal concentrations 
seen (eg. site F8 where Zn concentrations vary from 9.0-141 gL; -1). 
6.7: Sr 
Strontium concentrations are high (79-321 gL-1) cf. values <45 gL-1 and'<32"gL'1 in 
Coed y Brenin and Llangynog respectively. Concentrations are high at all sites and there 
is little spatial variation. The Sr source is likely to be carbonate minerals in the limestone 
in which Sr2+ substitutes readily for Ca2+ in calcite (Krauskopf, 1979) or may exist as 
discrete SrCO3, strontianite. Strontium shows good correlation with Ca (r=0.731) as 
illustrated in Fig. 6.10 reflecting the mutual source. Thus, the high Sr concentrations seen 
are a reflection of the background geology and are not associated with gangue minerals in 
x sulphide veins as recorded elsewhere (see, for example, Chapters 4.10,7.3,7.4)., This 
contrasts with the findings of Edmunds (1971) from Derbyshire where Sr was found to be 
a good indicator of mineralisation in the region. 
6.8: Ba 
Barium concentrations are also high throughout the area (20-275 gL-1). Concentrations 
this high are found only in association with barite mineralisation in the other areas 
studied (eg. Cwm Orog Mine in Llangynog, see Chapter 5.8 and Bryntail Mine near 
Llanidloes, see Chapter 7.5). Barium may be relatively high in some carbonate rocks 
(Levinson, 1980) although average concentrations are generally much less than those in 
igneous rocks, slates or shales (Turekian, 1977; Wedepohl, 1969-78). It is possible that 
the high Ba concentrations are a result of the` influence of carbonate geology on river 
water chemistry which is somehow holding Ba in solution or restricting the precipitation 
of Ba compounds. 
6.9: Pb 
Pb was detected at all sites-'in the area'with mean concentrations across the whole Flint 
area ranging from 1.1 to 66 gL-1. This suggests slight Pb contamination of most water 
in the area. Concentrations are variable at most sites, presumably as a result of variable 
hydrological, factors affecting the composition of groundwater in the area and the impact 
of relatively uncontaminated rainfall. The highest concentrations (up to 241 tgL-1) are 
seen in the contaminated drainage at site F10 where elevated Zn and Cd concentrations, 
discussed above, also indicate the proximity of oxidising sulphide minerals. .;;; 
6.10: U 
Uranium concentrations in rivers in the Flint area are frequently >11pgL-1 (up to 3.7 g 
L-1). This is significantly higher than the average concentration of 0.24 p. gL-1 quoted by' 
Martin and Whitfield (1983) and values in the other study areas are generally <1 gL-1. 
The elevated U concentrations in the Flint area reflect increased solubility of U in the 
alkaline,. carbonate-rich waters. Under these conditions U is, mobile as the uranyl ion, 
U02 2+ or complexed with carbonate ions (Levinson, 1980). Uranium concentrations in 
the river waters from Flint show roughly a direct correlations with Ca (Fig. 6.11. A). 
Correlation with pH is poor (Fig. 6.11. B) which suggests that U concentrations are 
controlled more by the carbonate content rather than the alkalinity of the water. 
6.11: CI, BrandI 
Chlorine, Br and I concentrations are all relatively high compared. with typical values 
from other'study areas. The range and mean concentrations of Cl, Br and I from the main 
study areas are summarised in Table 6.5. The elevated concentrations in the Flint area are 
likely to be the result of 2 main factors, (i) the relatively high concentrations of Br, I and 
especially Cl in carbonate rocks (Fuge, 1988, see also Chapter ' 8.4.6) and (ii). ' the 
proximity to the sea as precipitation in marine regions is relatively enriched in halogens 
(Fuge et al., 1987; Fuge, . 
1988). The importance of Cl, Br and I in the secondary 
environment is discussed further in Chapter 8.4.6. 
6.12: Summary 
River waters in the Flint area differ greatly from those described from Coed y Brenin and 
Llangynog. The major differences chemically are a result of the influence of, the 
carbonate rocks of the area which produce highly buffered, neutral to alkaline waters.  
Most of the surface drainage in the area is some distance away from the main mineralised 
zones and it is therefore difficult to attribute directly any aspect of the water 
geochemistry to former mining, activity. It must also be, born in mind that smelting 
formerly took place in the area and wind-borne contamination is likely to have affected 
much of the soils and sediments in the area (Nichol et al., 1970). With much sub-surface

drainage and only limited surface runoff in this area there is virtually no'fluvial erosion of 
contaminated mine waste, a marked contrast to the other mining districts inWales. What 
heavy metal contamination there is in the area is likely to result from rainwater 
percolation or groundwater passage through tip materials or underground mineral lodes. 
The alkalinity of the waters reduces the solubility of metals so only low concentrations 
are likely to be taken into solution. This was also found in limestone waters in the 
Derbyshire Dome region by Edmunds (1971). In addition the underground passage of 
water will assist the loss of metals from solution by precipitation and adsorption 
processes, thus reducing the impact of contamination from sulphide mineralisation. 
Site FlO is the only stream studied in the area which showed significant heavy metal 
contamination indicative of the proximity of sulphide mineralisation although there is no 
surface evidence of this. Element concentrations from site FlO are extremely variable (eg. 
Zn concentrations range 180-9,020 gL-1; Pb ranges 8.2-241 gL-1) and do not appear to 
be related to changes in the flow rate of the stream. It is therefore suggested that the water 
geochemistry at this site is strongly influenced by the source and pathway of the 
groundwaters which emerge to feed this stream. 
Seasonal patterns in gechemical variation, which in other areas in this study are related 
to changes in rainfall, are complex in the Flint area because the drainage system is 
strongly influenced by groundwater flow. This in turn is affected by factors such as 
antecedent weather conditions, vegetation, relief, landuse, etc.. Therefore, seasonal 
patterns which may be related to rainfall totals are not seen for most aspects of the 
streamwater geochemistry in this area (examples of seasonal variations of various 
elements at selected sites are given in Fig. 6.12). The main exception to this is seen in the 
behaviour of Zn which tends to show high winter/low summer concentrations (see 
Section 6.6). Mn also shows seasonal trends of high and low concentrations at some sites 
although the patterns seen are not consistent between different streams (see Section 6.5). 
Correlations between various aspects of water geochemistry in this area are poor as a 
result of the complex variations in chemistry. The metals associated with sulphide ore 
minerals (Zn, Mn, Cd and Pb) do show significant correlations (see Table 6.3) as do Ca 
and Sr (Section 6.7). These good correlations reflect a mutual source. However, the 
strong inter-relationships between pH, Ca, Mg, Al and rainfall seen elsewhere in this 
study and by previous authors (eg. Bull and Hall, 1986; Birchall and Chappell, 1988) are 
not evident here. 
Environmental impact 
As discussed above the relatively high pH of waters in the Flint area reduces, the 
dissolution of oxidised sulphide minerals-thus reducing heavy metal contamination. The 
neutral-alkaline pH levels and high Ca and Mg contents of river water in the Flint area 
also reduce the impact of heavy metals on the aquatic environment. The toxicity of 
certain metals to aquatic lifeforms is related to acidity, eg. the toxicity of Al to many 
organisms is increased at lower pH (Gostomski, 1990). The EEC water quality standards 
for freshwater to support various types of aquatic life (EEC Directive, 1978) which have 
been adopted by the Department of the Environment (`Velsh Office, 1985) quotes values 
of various heavy metals which should not be exceeded. These values increase with 
increasing water hardness as the toxicity is reduced with increasing hardness. Examples 
of the quality standards for Pb and Zn in water which supports salmonoid fish are listed in 
Table 6.6. 
Values of total hardness in the Flint stream waters were calculated using the following 
formula: 
Total hardness = [Ca]x2.5 + [Mg]x4.1 (as mgL-1 CaCO3). 
Typical values are >250 mgL-1 and therefore most of the streams sampled in this area are, 
. well within 
the standards listed in Table 6.6. The obvious exceptions being the, heavily 
contaminated stream at site F10 and the spring at site F15. 
In conclusion, former mining activity in the Flint area has relatively little impact on the 
geochemistry of streamwaters in the area as evidenced by heavy metal contamination. 
Contamination of soils and stream sediments as a result of mining and smelting in the 
area has been reported (Davies and Roberts, 1975,1978; Nichol et al., 1970) but 
contamination of stream waters appears not to be significant. 
CHAPTER 7: OTHER AREAS 
7.1: Introduction 
The areas around Clogau and Vigra, Beddgelert, Llanrwst and Dylife and Fan (see 
Fig. 1.2) are described in the following sections. River water in these areas was sampled 
in July and October of 1990 and February and May of 1991. These were all important 
areas of metal mining activity in the past and the aim was to identify potential sources of 
contamination and differences in the chemistries from different areas. Sampling on a 
seasonal basis aims to give a rough 'indication of possible ranges of element 
concentrations under varying flow conditions but the extremes of fluctuations are 
unlikely to be detected. It has not been possible to observe seasonal patterns from the 
limited amount of data. However, within these limitations it has still been possible to 
assess the extent of heavy metal contamination, highlighting several potential areas of 
interest for future study. 
7.2: Clogau and Vigra 
The mines of Old Clogau (SH 679198) and Vigra (SH 663191) are situated at the SW end 
of the Dolgellau Gold Belt and lie either side of the Hirgwm stream which flows south 
into the Mawddach Estuary at Bontddu (Fig. 7.1). Geologically the area is similar to Coed 
y Brenin (Chapter 4.1) with quartz-sulphide vein mineralisation in Cambrian sedimentary 
and volcanic rocks (Allen and Jackson, 1985). Old Clogau and Vigra were worked 
exclusively for Cu and were active until the mid-19th century. Gold was discovered in the 
St. Davids Lode around 1854 and this was worked at Clogau Mine (SH 674202) 
sporadically from the 1860s to the early 1900s (Hall, 1975). Attempts have been made to 
reopen the mine in the 1930s and 1980s/early 1990s. Clogau was the most productive 
gold mine in the Dolgellau Gold Belt yielding in total over 81,000 oz (Hall, 1975). 
River water samples were collected from 11 sites (see Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.1). The water 
chemistry at each site is summarised in Table 7.2. Lead, Zn, Cu and Mn concentrations 
are all very low compared, for example with rivers from the geologically similar Coed y 
Brenin area -8 km NE. Zinc concentrations are well below the level of 11 gL-1 quoted 
by Abdullah and Royle (1972) for "clean" streams in Wales. Copper concentrations are 
mostly <1 tgL-1 and Pb is below detection. 
The mineral veins at Clogau and Vigra contain very little Pb and Zn in contrast to the 
mines in Coed y Brenin to the east. This is reflected in the extremely low Zn (<5 gL-1) 
and levels of Pb below detection in the streams of the area. Ca concentrations are 
relatively high from the mine adits and tip drainage sites (S2, S5, S8 and S9) probably 
reflecting dissolution of calcite-rich gangue material. High Ca levels buffer the pH of the 
drainage waters in the area giving near-neutral pH values (6.2-7.1) and indeed slightly 
alkaline drainage from the Ty'n-y-Cornel adit at Clogau Mine (site S2, pH=7.2-7.4). 
Copper was the main metal extracted in this area, found mostly as chalcopyrite and is 
likely to be present in the tip material. However, concentrations in the tip drainage are 
extremely low (usually <1 pgL-1) due to low solubility under these near-neutral 
conditions. 
The low levels of heavy metal contaminants at Clogau and Vigra show that the former 
mining activities in the area do not appear to have a detrimental effect on the local river 
water chemistry today. 
7: 3: Beddgelert 
The study area around Beddgelert in southern Snowdonia was formerly a Cu mining area. 
The mining industry in Snowdonia was on a very small scale compared with Anglesey or 
Cornwall (see Chapter 1.2) but, like many Welsh mines, the history is thought to date 
back at least as far as Roman times (Bick, 1982). Copper ore occurred invariably as 
chalcopyrite, usually in fault controlled mineral veins traversing Llandeilo and Bala age 
rocks of the Ordovician and often closely associated with igneous rocks (Reedman et al., 
1985). The mines of this area are shown in Fig. 7.2. 
Sygun (SH 606486) was the most productive mine in the area throughout the 19th 
century. Much of the workings, some buildings and parts of the dressing floor survive 
intact and are now preserved as a mining museum (Plate 7.1). Mine tips, ruined buildings 
and the remnants of an aerial ropeway remain at Cwm Buchan (SH 602472) but little 
visible evidence remains of the other mines. All that remains of Level Goch (SH 594467) 
is an ochreous spring emerging from a hole in the roadside wall (Plate 7.2). 
The river water sites (mostly sampled 4 times) are shown in Fig. 7.2 and are described in 
Table 7.3. 
A summary of the water chemistry at each site is given in Table 7.4 and mean 
concentrations for selected elements are shown on Figs. 7.3. A-D.

TABLE 7.5: Water chemistry at sites S15 and S15B, May 1991 
(element concentrations in gL-1) 
--------------------------------------------------------- 
S15 S15b 
---------------------------- 
10100 
There are several point sources of metal contamination in'the Glaslyn river system near 
Beddgelert (Fig. 7.3), most notably the drainage from Sygun Mine (site S 15). The water at 
this site is highly acidic due to pyrite oxidation (pH 3.3-3.8) and contains high levels of 
Cu and Al and relatively high Zn. In May 1991 sample S 15b was taken 400m 
downstream from Sygun, just before joining the 'A. Glaslyn. The difference in the 
chemistry between sites S 15 and S 15b are shown in Table 7.5. It can be seen that the 
chemistry remains virtually unchanged with the exception of Br which shows a drop of 
about 75%. There is no precipitation or adsorption of other elements from solution which 
could account for loss of Br from solution (Fuge, 1988). It is possible that the Br is 
volatilised and lost to the atmosphere although further studies would be necessary to 
prove this. 
Fairly low pH values are seen at sites S 12 and S 14 (4.1-5.1 and 4.4-4.7 respectively). The 
presence of small concentrations of Ni and Co in solution (see Table 7.4) suggests that 
the breakdown of pyrite is the likely source of acidity here as at Sygun. Aluminium at 
these sites is also fairly high due to dissolution by the low pH waters. 
Samples S 13 and S 13a are from the ochreous Level Goch spring. Zinc and Pb values are 
moderately high but Cu is extremely low. The precipitation of ochre on emergence of the 
spring reflects a high Fe content in the water underground due to the oxidation of pyrite. 
Precipitation of ochre is likely to "scavenge" heavy, metals such as Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd etc. 
from solution (Burke, 1970; Rose and Suhr, 1971; Levinson, 1980; Johnson, 1986; Fuge 
et al., 1992b, 1993a, 1993b). It is possible that heavy metals are being scavenged from 
solution in the Level Goch Spring in this manner, hence, relatively low heavy metal 
concentrations are seen. Calcium and Mg concentrations are high (mean concentrations 
17,030 and 6,600 gL-1 respectively) probably reflecting dissolution of large volumes 
carbonate gangue minerals (eg. calcite and ankerite). It is suggested that reaction with 
these basic anions partly neutralises the acidity released by the oxidation of pyrite 
producing pH values in the range 5.3-5.8 cf. values <4.0 in acid mine drainage from 
Sygun (site S 15). Heavy metal concentrations may therefore be reduced by the relatively 
high pH. Strontium concentrations are also high at Level Goch (223-307 gL-1) because 
it is found in trace amounts in the calcite. 
Elevated concentrations of Br, Cl and I are all. seen at- sites S13 and S 13a but not 
elsewhere. Chlorine and I have been found in, association with mineralisation elsewhere 
in Wales (Fuge et al., 1978,1986; Al-Ajely, 1985) and Br, by association, is likely to 
show similar behaviour (Fuge, 1988). Chlorine commonly occurs as 
NaCl in fluid 
inclusions in ore and gangue material (Roedder, 1972). Iodine has been found both in 
fluid inclusions and incorporated in sulphide minerals (Fuge and Johnson, 1984). The 
mineral vein at Level Goch is likely to be the source of the halogens in the spring (sites 
S 13 and S 13 a). It is, however, striking that such elevated levels do not appear associated 
with mineralisation elsewhere in the area. It is possible that there is a greater volume of 
carbonate gangue material at Level Goch Mine as evidenced by the elevated Ca, Sr and 
Mg concentrations and relatively high pH and this may be a host for fluid inclusions 
which are readily weathered to give the higher concentrations of Cl, Br and I in the Level 
Goch spring. Thus the high concentrations of Cl, Br and I in the Level Goch Spring are 
possibly the reflection of differences in the style of mineralisation. 
Historically Level Goch Mine also contrasts with other mines in the area. It was 
abandoned pre-1800 (Hick, 1982) and relatively little is known about its operations unlike 
other mines which were operational throughout the 19th century. It is possible that 
mining difficulties caused closure of the mine but it is tempting to think that its lack of 
success may be related to its mineralogy which appears to be rich in gangue materials and 
may be poor in heavy metals. 
7.4: 'Llanrwst 
The Llanrwst mining district lies to the west of the Conwy Valley between Betws y Coed 
and Trefriw (Fig. 7.4). It was once one of the most important Pb-Zn mining areas in the 
Lower Palaeozoic rocks of North Wales (Howells et al., 1978). Geological descriptions 
of the area are given by Dewey and Smith (1922), Archer (1959) and Howells et al. 
(1978,1981). Detailed histories of the mines and their activities are recorded in a series 
of books by Bennet and Vernon (1989,1990,1991). 
Mineralisation is found in steeply dipping, fault controlled veins in Ordovician 
mudstones, slates and interbedded tuffs (Dewey and Smith, 1922). The most productive 
veins are commonly associated with doleritic intrusions. The ore minerals are 
predominantly galena and sphalerite with some pyrite and marcasite (Archer, 1959). 
Quartz and calcite are the main gangue minerals and their relative abundance varies 
throughout the area (Howells et al., 1978,1981). Chalcopyrite is rare (Archer, 1959). 
Mining activities were most intensive from about 1850 to the outbreak of the First World 
War and concentrated mainly on Parc, Hafna, Cyffty and Pandora (Lewis, 1967; Bennet

and Vernon, 1989,1990,1991) (Fig. 7.4). Parc 'was the most important mine and was 
worked intermittently until the late 1950s. In places the mining remains are quite 
extensive with buildings, wheel pits, dressing floors and waste tips evident at many sites 
(Bennet and Vernon, 1989,1990,1991). The'remains of several mines in the area have 
been renovated by the Snowdonia National Parks and Welsh Development Agency. Parc 
mine had the most extensive waste tips and was recognised as having a major impact on 
the environment (Johnson and Eaton, 1980). ' The waste tips were reclaimed in the late 
1970s to reduce heavy metal contamination of the Conwy Valley which occurred due to 
erosion of the Parc tailings dumps by 'the Nant Gwydyr. This involved levelling the 
tailings, covering the surface with a layer of black shale and then crushed limestone and 
finally sowing the area with metal tolerant plants (Firth et al., 1981, Plate 7.3). This has 
successfully reduced the suspended load of sediment carried by the Nant Gwydyr, 
especially during times of flood (Firth et al., 1981). 
The water sampling sites are listed in Table 7.6 and shown on Fig. 7.4. River water 
chemistries are summarised in Table 7.7. 
Sample sites S 17a-d and S22a were not sampled in all 4 of the sampling periods. The 
sampling dates are indicated in Table 7.6. Consideration of mean element concentrations 
at these sites would therefore be unrepresentative so mean values are given only for the 
sites where data for all 4 sample periods is available. Element concentration maps in 
Fig. 7.5 show the spatial variations in stream chemistry in'February 1991 at most sites. 
Examination of Figs. 7.5. A and B and Table 7.7 indicates streams in the vicinity 'of the 
mines in this area are heavily contaminated by Pb, Zn and Cd. The particularly high 
concentration of Pb mines within this small area and the nature of the surface drainage as 
very small surface streams through the mine sites produces a high proportion of 
contaminated drainage in this area. 
Calcium (Fig. 7.5. C), Mg and Sr, levels are generally high presumably due to a large 
calcite content in the gangue material and pH values are subsequently near neutral (6.0- 
7.2) in general. The precipitation of ochre (eg. at Parc Mine, sites S 19 and S20) and 
detectable levels of Co and Ni (Table 7.7) suggest the oxidation of pyrite is occurring but 
any acidity produced is neutralised by dissolution of calcite as suggested above at Level 
Goch Spring (site S13, Section 7.3). The Ca concentrations in the Parc drainage are 
significantly higher than at Level Goch (24,000-43,500 gL-1 Ca at Parc; 14,000-19,260 
. tgL-1 Ca at Level Goch) and therefore the higher buffering capacity of the waters at Parc 
produces the higher pH values seen (6.0-7.2 cf. 5.3-5.8 at Level Goch). Exceptions to the 
general high pH pattern seen in the area are the temporary lake below Cyffty Mine (site 
S 17a) and, to a lesser degree, the nearby stream at site S 17b. Here Ca and Mg levels are 
low hence buffering capacity is low and mine drainage remains fairly acidic (pH values 
as low as 3.8) and Al levels are high (see Figs. 7.5. C and 7.5. D). The mineralisation at 
Cyftty presumably has quartz-rich gangue material whereas elsewhere in the area the 
mineralised veins are rich in calcite. An increase in Ca concentration is seen between 
sites S 19 at Parc Mine (mean Ca = <35,000 gL-1) and at site S20, below the reclaimed 
tips (mean Ca = >41,000 gL-1). Some of this increase is likely to result from surface 
runoff over the limestone which was used as a covering layer to the tip in the reclamation 
project (Firth et al., 1981). The high Ca concentrations will help keep pH levels high and 
thus reduce the concentrations of metals in solution (see below). 
Reclamation of the tips at Parc dramatically reduced the fluxes of Pb, Zn and Cd as 
particulate and bedload material under flood conditions in the Nant Gwydyr (Firth et al., 
1981) by controlling erosion of the waste dumps. However, there is still a problem of 
contamination in the stream by dissolved and very fine particulate material in the mine 
drainage which cannot easily be controlled. The natural alkalinity of the mine drainage 
will help to reduce the impact of acid drainage produced by the breakdown of sulphide 
minerals. A slight reduction of metal contamination is evident between sites S 19 and S20, 
presumably caused by processes of dilution, adsorption, coprecipitation and scavenging 
by ochreous precipitates. These processes may also be aided by input of Ca-rich runoff 
from the crushed limestone on the tips but there is no pH increase which could cause 
precipitation of metals from solution. 
7.5: Dylife and Fan 
This study area, to the NW of Llanidloes in mid-Wales, includes Fan Mine, one of the 
most remarkable in British Pb-mining history. Fan was active for only a short period 
compared with most other Welsh mines. It was only discovered in the 1850s but was 
developed very rapidly to, become the most productive Pb-mine in Britain in the late 
1800s. (Bick, 1990). The exceedingly rich lode was in places 62 feet wide and was over 
2,000 fathoms long (Lewis, 1967). Dylife, the next most important mine in the area, has 
been worked since Roman times but was greatly overshadowed when Fan came into 
operation. The surrounding area is dotted with old workings (see Fig. 7.6) many of which 
were little more than trials (Bick, 1990).

Ordovician and Silurian mudstones and grits are host to mineral lodes, predominantly of 
galena and sphalerite with quartz and/or calcite gangue. Chalcopyrite occurs less 
commonly and in parts barite is present in quantities once of economic importance (eg. at 
Bryntail) (Hughes, 1959). Extensive, bare waste tips remain at Fan and Dylife (Plates 
7.6and 7.7) and substantial remnants of buildings may be seen at Bryntail. 
A recent examination of tip material and drainage waters at Fan has been made by Fuge 
et al. (1993a) with specific reference to the behaviour of Cd and Zn. Concentrations of up 
to 105,000 ppm Zn and 1,050 ppm Cd were found in tip material. The average Zn/Cd 
ratio is 92 but in the most metal-rich samples was found to be as low as 75. In two 
sphalerite samples analysed from the Fan tips Zn/Cd ratios of 450 and 310 were found. 
The relative enrichment of Cd in the tip material was attributed by Fuge et al. (1993a) to 
the preferential weathering of ZnS to the highly soluble sulphate while CdS is less 
weathered. 
In surface drainage waters Zn concentrations up to 128,820 gL-1 and Cd up to 845 g 
L'1 were found with Zn/Cd ratios >100. Subsurface drainage was relatively enriched in 
Cd (average Zn/Cd=77). The behaviour of Cd in the subsurface environment is thought to 
be controlled by Eh and pH (Fuge et al,. 1993a). 
River water sites, shown in Fig. 7.6 and listed in Table 7.8, were all sampled in July and 
October 1990. The mine drainage sites at Dylife, Fan and Bryntail (sites DF6, DF7, DF9, 
DF10 and DF11) and the A. Twymyn at site DF13 were sampled in February and May 
1991. Additional sites at Fan (DF9a-d, Fig. 7.9) were sampled in February 1991 during a 
period of particularly high surface runoff following heavy rainfall. Concentrations of 
selected elements in July 1990, are indicated in Fig. 7.7 and the analytical data are 
summarised in Table 7.9. 
High Ca, probably from the dissolution of carbonate gangue material, is evident from the 
mines (Fig. 7.7. A). Thus drainage waters from the mines are not particularly acid and Al 
concentrations are fairly low (Fig. 7.7. B). Aluminium levels are much higher in streams 
draining the high moorland in the west of the area (eg. sites DF3, DF4, DF13). This is the 
result of natural acidity produced in the upland peat areas and, as described from the 
Coed y Brenin and Llangynog areas (Chapters 4.3 and 5.3), appears to vary with rainfall. 
For example, Al concentrations at site DF13 vary between 35-333 ggL-1 and the highest 
value is associated with a period of particularly heavy rainfall in February 1991. 
Streams in the vicinity of Dylife (Sites DF10 and DF11) and, more especially, at Fan 
(DF9) are heavily contaminated with Pb, Zn (Figs. 7.7. C and 7.7. D) and Cd. Maximum 
concentrations seen at Dylife are 609 gL-1 Pb, 1,084 gL-1 Zn and 11 . tgL-1 Cd. At 
Fan the maximum metal concentrations occurred during a period of very high surface 
runoff (see below) when concentrations of 9,641 tgL-1 Pb, 82,000 pgL-1 Zn and 845 
tgL-1 Cd were recorded, these values being the highest encountered during this study. 
The other major mine drain in the area, site DF6 at Bryntail, is not particularly rich in Pb, 
Zn or Cd (maximum concentrations are 7.0,195 and 1.5 p gL-1 respectively) but does 
have an extremely high Ba content (upto 628 gL-1). This reflects barite in the 
mineralisation which was the major product of the mine in its latter years of operation 
(Foster-Smith, 1978). 
The seasonal variations of stream chemistry at site DF9 are shown in Fig. 7.8. ' These 
clearly show a flushing effect of metals, particularly Al, Zn and Cd, in February 1991 
following heavy rain. Similarity in the behaviour of Zn and Cd can be seen and also that 
of Ba and Pb (as described from Cwm Orog Mine near Llangynog in Chapter 5). 
The additional sample sites at Fan where water was collected in February 1991 are shown 
in Fig. 7.9 and the analytical results are given in Table 7.10. Sites DF9b and DF9c are 
temporary streams of rapid surface runoff which are present only following periods of 
heavy rainfall. These 2 sites represent the greatest Pb, Zn and Cd contamination 
encountered during the whole study (see- above) resulting from the flushing of metals 
from the surface and upper horizons of the tailings dumps. 
The Zn/Cd ratios of drainage waters at Fan are listed in Table 7.11. The sample from site 
DF9a in February 1991 has low concentrations of Zn and Cd and therefore errors in 
analytical accuracy may be the cause of the low Zn/Cd ratio seen at this site. With the 
exception of this value from site DF9a the ratios are fairly constant (69-90) across the 
area and through time as described by Fuge et al. (1993a). This appears strange in view of 
the different weathering characteristics of Zn and Cd discussed by Fuge et al. (1993a; see 
above). It is possible that flushing of any Zn which has built up by weathering during a 
dry spell occurs only in the initial stages of a storm and lasts only a few hours (Grimshaw 
et al., 1976) and this has not been seen due to the sampling scheme. 
Elevated Cl concentrations are seen in the drainage waters at Fan (max. 203 mgL-1) 
which are likely to be associated with the vein mineralisation as described elsewhere in

Wales (Section 7.3; Johnson, 1980; Andrews et al., 1984; Fuge et al., 1986). It therefore 
appears strange that elevated Cl concentrations are not seen at site DF9c (C1=20 mgL-1) 
while anomalously high Br (714 gL-1) is present. High Br (max. 741 pgL-1) is also seen 
at Bryntail (site DF6) but neither elevated Cl or Br are seen at Dylife (sites DF10, DF1 1). 
Under normal, flow conditions the drainage from the Fan tips are contaminated with 
heavy metals at levels harmful to aquatic life but during high flow periods erosion of the 
tailings material produces a serious pollution problem. In addition to fluvial 
contamination there are severe problems at Fan during dry periods of windblown 
pollution affecting surrounding agricultural land (Johnson et al., 1978). Plans are 
currently under consideration to attempt to control the heavy metal pollution at Fan. 
7.6: Summary 
This study of Clogau, Vigra, Beddgelert, Llanrwst, Fan and Dylife considers areas of 
distinctly different geology and types of mineralisation. These differences are reflected in 
the geochemistry of streams and rivers in each area. Former mining activity in most areas 
has been shown to have a detrimental affect on river water geochemistry although this is 
not always the case, as seen at Clogau and Vigra where pH's are high. 
Clogau and Vigra 
River waters in the Clogau and Vigra area show no evidence of heavy metal 
contamination resulting from the mining activities. This is an interesting example of the 
influence different mineralogies can have on water chemistry. The mineral lodes worked 
at Clogau and Vigra form part of the Dolgellau Gold Belt as do those at, Gwynfynydd 
(Chapter 4). The veins at Clogau and Gwynfynydd are intruded into rocks of the same 
age and dates indicate the lodes to be from one mineralisation event (Allen and Jackson, 
1985). The mineral assemblages however are different. The veins in the Gwynfynydd 
area are pyrite - sphalerite - galena dominant with only minor chalcopyrite whereas at 
Clogau the main sulphides are chalcopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. Large volumes of 
calcite occur in the gangue material at Clogau. These mineralogical differences are 
reflected in the stream water geochemistry. The mine drains at Gwynfynydd are highly 
acidic and contaminated with Pb, Zn Cd and Cu (see Chapters 4.7 and 4.8). The waters 
draining Clogau have neutral to alkaline pH due to dissolution of calcite and are 
extremely low in heavy metals. 
Beddgelert 
The Beddgelert area has 2 major point sources of contaminated mine drainage. Waters 
from Sygun Mine contain elevated Cu and Zn concentrations and Level Goch Spring is 
unusually rich in Cl, Br and I. The source of the Cl, Br and 1, and their presence in only 
one stream in the area pose interesting problems. The difference in water chemistry at 
Level Goch could reflect mineralogical differences but further research here would be 
very interesting and might show something of the behaviour of Cl, Br and I under varying 
environmental conditions. For example, the possible volatilisation of Br as suggested at 
the Sygun mine drain could be examined. 
Llanrwst 
Streams in the Llanrwst area are contaminated with Pb and Zn from the former mine 
sites. At the majority of these mines calcite predominates in the gangue material thus the 
waters are rich in Ca, well buffered and as a result pH values are relatively high. At 
Cyffty Mine the calcite content of the gangue material is small and the resulting mine 
drainage is fairly acidic. 
Fan and Dylife 
Fan is the most heavily contaminated mine site which has been investigated in this study. 
Pollution problems of the local river system by Pb, Zn and Cd have been shown to-', be 
most severe during high flow conditions. The A. Twymyn at Dylife is also heavily, 
contaminated with Pb and Zn at levels well above environmental quality standards 
(Welsh Office Directive, 1985) but Fan must be the first priority for urgent attention to 
reduce the environmental impact of erosion of the mine tailings. 
It is also of interest that at Fan elevated concentrations of Br and I do not appear 
associated with the high Cl, unlike the Level Goch Spring near Beddgelert where elevated 
Cl, Br and I are seen together (see Section 7.3). 
The infuence of carbonate gangue minerals 
An interesting point illustrated by the brief study of the 4 above areas is the influence of 
the carbonate content of the vein mineralisation. Large volumes of carbonate gangue 
(predominantly calcite) are reflected by high Ca, Mg and Sr concentrations in mine 
drainage. This is seen for example at mines such as Clogau, Vigra, Level Goch, Parc, 
Bryntail and Fan. The high basic ion content helps neutralise acidity produced by the 
breakdown of sulphides and the increased pH reduces metal solubility.,, Thus the 
carbonate gangue content of sulphide veins can provide a natural control on heavy metal 
contamination in mine drainage. 
PART 3: DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
CHAPTER 8: CONTROLS ON RIVER WATER GEOCHEMISTRY 
8.1: Introduction 
In the preceding chapters the following factors have been shown to have a controlling 
influence on river water geochemistry: geology and mineralisation; the geochemical 
behaviour of elements (eg. solubility, precipitation, adsorption and complex formation 
processes); the geochemical environment, particularly Eh and pH; and rainfall 
(composition, volume and frequency). Of local importance are factors such as land use, 
vegetation, soil type and relief. These factors are closely inter-related and the 
geochemistry of river waters cannot be attributed to one controlling influence but is the 
result of complex interaction of the above factors. 
Concentrations >1 gL-1 of Cu, Pb, Cd, Co, Ni and the REE and Zn levels above the 
background in "clean" streams proposed by Abdullah and Royle (1972) of 11 gL-1 have 
been found, in drainage waters in this study, exclusively associated with sulphide 
mineralisation. They are considered below as "Contaminant metals". The "Other 
elements" (eg. Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Ba, Sr, Cl, Br and I) are generally ubiquitous. However, 
all of these elements may also be found at elevated concentrations related to 
mineralisation. In this discussion aspects of river water geochemistry are considered 
under separate headings for clarity. However, it must be borne in mind that the 
individual aspects are all closely inter-related. The major controlling influences on river 
water geochemistry and the relationship between various aspects of the chemistry are 
identified where possible. Table 8.1 gives a summary of the water geochemistry data 
from all the areas. 
8.2: pH 
Rainwater is generally slightly acidic (pH -5.7) due to the dissolution of CO2 from the 
atmosphere and acidity may also be increased by industrial pollutants eg. SOX, NOX and 
HCl (see Chapter 2.3). Another important natural source of acidity to river systems is the 
breakdown of organic matter which produces humic acids. In upland areas of Wales peat 
moorlands are common and, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall, humic acids are 
washed into the surface drainage systems. This is commonly seen, for example, in the 
A. Mawddach which drains the high moorland to the east and northeast of Coed y Brenin 
(Chapter 4.3) and at the high moorland site in the Berwyn Mountains (site L2) near 
Llangynog (Chapter 5.3). These rivers are often brown and foamy during periods of high 
flow reflecting the high organic content. 
Background geology influences river water pH by controlling the availability of basic 
ions such as Ca and Mg which neutralise acidic inputs, ie. geology influences the 
buffering capacity. Waters draining the limestone rocks of NE Wales have an infinite 
buffering capacity (Hornung et al., 1990a) and thus neutral to alkaline pH values (7.0- 
8.3) are produced. The lower Palaeozoic rocks which underlie the remaining study. areas 
have little or no buffering capacity (Hornung et al., 1990a) and the resulting pH values 
are generally <7.0. The buffering capacity of a water body influences the impact of inputs 
of acidic water, whether natural organic, acid rain or acid mine drainage. 
Differences in river water acidity are seen within smaller areas of study as well as 
between the study areas. For example, in Coed y Brenin the A. Mawddach has a mean 
background pH of 5.9 whilst the -A. Wen has a mean pH of 6.4. This difference is 
attributed to a combination of the factors outlined below: 
(i) The Mawddach receives a greater volume of organic acid inputs from the high relief, 
peat moorland to the east and northeast of Coed y Brenin compared to the Wen 
which has a smaller catchment area of lower relief. The Wen thus has less natural 
acidic inputs than the Mawddach. 
(ii) The Mawddach drains an area predominantly underlain by Cambrian mudstones and 
siltstones which are relatively base-poor. The Wen, in contrast, drains an area of 
predominantly microtonalitic and dioritic intrusive rocks from which basic . ions 
are more easily weathered. The Wen therefore has the greater buffering capacity 
and is better able, to neutralise any acidic inputs. 
(iii) Much of the course of the Mawddach is planted with coniferous trees which may 
reduce the-buffering capacity or even increase acidity of the river (see Chapter 
2.4). 
This example illustrates well the interaction of several factors controlling river water 
geochemistry as described in Section 8.1. 
In this study it was also found that the type and extent of mineralisation also influences 
the pH of river waters. Locally the oxidation of sulphide minerals to produce acid mine 
drainage may be important. This is most pronounced in areas of pyrite-rich mineralisation', 
(eg. Gwynfynydd Mine, Coed y Brenin, Chapter 4.3; Sygun Mine, Beddgelert, Chapter 
7.3). The lowest pH values (pH <4.0) seen in this study are all associated with acidic 
mine drainage. This acidity increases both the rate of decomposition of minerals and the 
solubility of many metals thus having a major influence on water geochemistry.

The relationship between pH and rainfall in general shows a drop in pH with increasing 
rainfall, ie. generally high summer/low winter patterns in variation corresponding with 
periods of low and high flow respectively (see Chapter 4.3). Deposited acidity in Wales 
has been shown to be related to rainfall totals (Donald et al., 1990) due to increased wash 
out of atmospheric acidifiers with increasing rainfall. Thus the fall in river water pH in 
the wetter winter months may be partly due to increasing acidic inputs from 
precipitation. As mentioned above the breakdown of organic matter is an important 
source of acidity in upland areas of Wales and increased wash out of organic acids with 
increases in rainfall will also decrease pH levels in rivers. In addition the increased rate of 
throughflow reduces the time available for the dissolution of basic ions to neutralise 
acidic inputs as there is a corresponding drop in Ca and Mg concentrations during high 
winter flows (see Section 8.4.1). 
8.3: Contaminant metals 
8.3.1: Zn and Cd 
Most Zn and Cd in solution in river waters in the areas studied results from the 
breakdown of sphalerite. Elevated Zn and Cd concentrations are seen in all the study 
areas except at Clogau and Vigra (Table 8.1). The mineralisation at Clogau and Vigra has 
a low sphalerite content (Chapter 7.2), in addition the high carbonate content of the 
gangue raises the pH and thus restricts metal dissolution (see Section 8.4.1). The 
Beddgelert area has only slight elevations of Zn and Cd (up to 1,025 tgL-1 and 3.8 g 
L-1 respectively), the mineralisation here being predominantly Cu (Section 8.3.2). 
Seasonal variations in general show low summer/high winter concentrations reflecting 
greater dissolution of oxidised ore minerals in tip material by the increasing throughflow 
of water. The winter highs in concentration correspond with a drop in pH which will also 
aid the dissolution of metals. 
Zinc and Cd data from all areas are summarised in Table 8.2. Most of the Zn/Cd ratios in 
mine drainage waters, shown in Table 8.2 are within a narrow range (46-212) with mean 
ratios ranging 98-145 (excluding site G2 which is discussed later). The variation in ratios 
between different areas may, in some cases, be attributed to variable Cd content of the 
sphalerites which could be either a function of temperature during formation of the ore 
deposit (Levinson, 1980) and/or the type of deposit (Ivanov, 1964). For example 
sphalerites from Liangynog have a relatively high Cd content compared to those from 
Coed y Brenin (see Chapter 5.7). This has been demonstrated by the analysis of 
sphalerites from both areas (Chapter 5.7). Relatively low Zn/Cd ratios from the Flint area 
may also be a reflection of high Cd in sphalerites from the area reported by El Shazly et 
al. (1957). -. 
At Fan relatively high Cd is also seen in the water. Fuge et al. (1993a) reported Zn/Cd 
ratios of 450 and 310 in sphalerites from Fan which does not indicate particularly high Cd 
contents to account for the high concentration of this element in the drainage waters. The 
tip material, however, was found to be relatively enriched in Cd (mean Zn/Cd = 92). This 
was attributed to the preferential weathering of ZnS to the highly soluble sulphate while 
CdS, due to its more chalcophile nature (Goldschmidt, 1954), remained less weathered 
(see also Chapter 7.5). Thus over the period of 70+ years since the closure of the mine the 
tip material has become relatively enriched in Cd hence the high Cd content seen in the 
drainage waters. 
The Zn/Cd ratios are fairly consistent over time, shown by the narrow range of values at 
each site (excluding site G2). This seems unusual in view of the different weathering 
characteristics discussed above for ZnS and CdS. Flushing peaks of the relatively more 
soluble Zn might be expected following dry periods during which ZnS would be 
preferentially weathered. It is possible that the sampling scheme has missed such peaks 
which may only be of a few hours duration following the onset of a storm (Grimshaw, et 
al., 1976). 
Two very high Zn/Cd values were described from the Llangynog Mine drain (site L7) in 
Chapter 5.7. These may be due to enhanced analytical errors at low Cd concentrations 
(3.0 and 4.2 gL-1) but it is possible that the relatively high Zn is the result of flushing 
out of preferentially weathered ZnS as ZnSO4. 
The mine drainage from the outburst at Gwynfynydd Mine (site G2) is discussed in 
Chapter 4.7 and illustrates a further control mechanism on the Cd content of water. The 
Cd concentrations in this drain are relatively low and the Zn/Cd ratios show a very wide 
range over time (884-196). This is the only stream sampled in this study where a large 
degree of ochre precipitation is occurring and this is considered to have a controlling 
influence on the Zn/Cd content by the preferential scavenging of Cd from solution (Fuge 
et al., 1992b; 1993a, 1993b; see also Chapter 4.7).

8.3.2: Cu 
The distribution of Cu in river waters in former metal mining areas of Wales clearly 
reflects the mineralisation chemistry (Fig. 8.1). Coed y Brenin and Snowdonia (eg. 
Beddgelert) were the main Cu producing areas and this is reflected in the Cu content of 
river waters in these areas. Fairly high Cu concentrations were seen in the most 
contaminated drainage at Fan (up to 118 pgL-1) but the mean Cu concentration for the 
area is low (5.6 p. gL-l). Mean Cu concentrations elsewhere are all <2.2. tgL-1 (see Table 
8.1). 
The Cu-bearing river waters in Coed y Brenin may be grouped into high Zn or low Zn 
categories- which reflect the Cu source (Chapter 4.8). The high Zn waters are all 
associated with sphalerite-galena dominant mineral veins. The source of Cu in the low Zn 
waters may be traced to either (i) pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite dominant mineral veins 
(as at Cwm Heisian Issa Mine, site Cl), (ii) the Cu-bearing breccia pipe at Glasdir or (iii) 
the porphyry copper type mineralisation. 
Copper is a relatively mobile element in acid and oxidising environments (see Chapter 
2.2). In drainage from the mines which worked sulphide ore veins, in Coed y Brenin 
(sites C1 and C7) and Beddgelert, Cu concentrations are clearly related to pH as indicated 
by the good correlation coefficients listed in Table 8.3. 
Poor correlations seen at other sites suggest Cu is not strongly influenced by pH and other 
factors must be considered. At Turf Copper in particular (sites C10 and Cl1) the 
correlation with pH is poor and this is attributed to the influence of organic matter on the 
precipitation/adsorption of Cu (Chapter 4.8). 
The dispersal of Cu in surface drainage waters has only a limited extent. For example, in 
Coed y Brenin Cu is only found in small tributaries near mineralised zones and the 
anomalous levels do not persist in larger rivers or away from mineralisation. Precipitation 
or adsorption onto organic matter and Fe and Mn oxides and hydroxides are likely to 
limit the Cu content of river waters. This could be of importance in geochemical drainage 
surveys, eg. for, mineral exploration. Copper anomalies in river waters could easily be 
missed and stream sediment surveys are more likely to give a good indication of 
anomalous levels of Cu. 
In the Coed y Brenin area transport of Cu by ground waters seems to be significantly 
more important than dispersal by surface drainage. This is evidenced by the higher Cu 
concentrations seen in ground waters (Andrews and Fuge, 1986) and ground water 
seepages (see Chapter 4.8) and is possibly the result of high acidity in the ground water 
due to the breakdown of abundant pyrite and chalcopyrite in the area. This type of ground 
water movement has transported Cu from the disseminated porphyry copper type deposit 
and concentrated it in the Cu-rich bogs in the area. 
8.3.3: Pb 
The major source of Pb, galena, is associated with sphalerite in the mineralised sulphide 
veins throughout Wales and therefore the patterns of seasonal variations are similar to 
those of Zn and Cd reflecting their mutual source. The concentrations of Pb seen , in 
drainage waters, however, are much lower than those of Zn. Lead was the main metal 
sought over much of the mining period and Zn was, for a long time, considered a waste 
product. Sphalerite is therefore much more abundant in the tip material than galena, 
providing a greater source of Zn. 
The low Pb concentrations are, however, mainly the result of the low solubility of the 
oxidation products of PbS. In pure water the solubility of PbS04 is 42.5 mgL-1 (Weast, 
1988-89) but in the presence of high SO4 contents resulting from the oxidation of 
sulphide minerals, the solubility is dramatically reduced by the common ion effect which 
causes precipitation of PbSO4. Consideration of SO4 data from Pb-contaminated sites in 
this study revealed a positive correlation between Pb and SO4 concentrations (Fig. 8.2). 
'This reflects their mutual source as both are derived from oxidising sulphide minerals. 
However, the SO4 content does not appear to have a controlling influence on Pb 
concentrations by the precipitation of PbSO4. At the concentrations found in this study, 
the solubility product of Pb + PbSO4 is not exceeded. For example, in the outburst from 
Gwynfynydd (site G2), with concentrations of 49 gL-1 Pb and 247 mgL-1 SO4: 
[Pb] x [SO4] = 6.09x10-10 molL-1 
which is much less than the solubility product: 
K(PbS04) =1.82x10-8 
This contrasts with the findings of Fuge et al. (1992b, 1993b) in highly contaminated 
surface waters from Parys Mountain, Anglesey where the highest Pb concentrations occur 
in waters with the lowest SO4 content. 
The absence of any apparent control on Pb concentrations by SO4 in the waters of this 
study could reflect the control of dissolution of PbS at source. High SO4 contents in

waters in the vicinity of oxidising sulphide veins, at the point of weathering, could limit 
the amount of Pb that becomes mobilised. 
8.3.4: Co and Ni 
Cobalt and Ni are found in minor or trace amounts in pyrite (Chapter 1.1, Table 1.1). The 
presence of Co and Ni in mine drainage waters thus reflects the oxidation of pyrite. This 
is seen particularly at Gwynfynydd Mine, Coed y Brenin, and to a lesser extent at Cwm 
Heisian Issa Mine, Coed y Brenin; Sygun Mine, Beddgelert and at Cyffty, Llanrwst. At 
all these sites pH values are low due to the acidity produced by the breakdown of pyrite. 
It is interesting to note that at Parc Mine, near Llanrwst, Ni concentrations up to 18 gL-1 
are seen along with ochreous precipitates which suggest the oxidation of some pyrite but 
pH values are in the range 7.0-7.2. The high-Ca content at this site (24.0-43.5 mgL-1), 
resulting from the breakdown of carbonate gangue, buffers the' drainage waters 
neutralising any acidity produced. 
8.4: Other elements 
8.4.1: Ca and Mg 
The major element content of river waters (eg. Ca and Mg) tends to reflect the 
background geology of an area. Waters draining the limestone area of NE Wales (the 
Flint area) have much higher Ca and Mg contents than the other areas (Fig. 8.3) due to the 
dissolution of calcite. These waters are highly buffered and thus show high pH values 
(see above). - 
In the example described in Section 8.2 from Coed y Brenin the Mawddach, which is the 
more acidic (mean pH=5.9), drains relatively base-poor rocks and has a low mean Ca 
concentration (2,166 gL-1). The Wen, however, drains an area of rocks with more easily 
weathered basic ions and therefore has a higher buffering capacity with a mean Ca 
concentration of 4,684 gL-1 and thus pH values are higher (mean pH=6.4). 
Seasonal variations in Ca and Mg concentrations in the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog 
areas show high summer/low winter patterns (Chapters 4.5 and 5.5) which correlate well 
with the variations seen in pH. The reduced Ca and Mg concentrations are attributed to 
dilution of background levels by increased rainfall inputs and pH values drop because the 
buffering capacity is reduced. Higher flows caused by the increased rainfall will reduce 
the time available for dissolution of basic ions thus also reducing the Ca and Mg 
concentrations and the pH levels of river waters in winter. 
Seasonal variations of Ca and Mg (amongst other elements), and also pH, in the Flint area 
do not follow obvious trends and this is attributed to the complex nature of the drainage 
system which is dominated by sub-surface and groundwater flow. 
Elevated Ca and Mg concentrations have also been found in mine drainage waters. The 
highest concentrations shown in Fig. 8.3 (excluding those in the Flint area) are  all 
associated with mine or tip drainage. The high acidity resulting from the breakdown of 
sulphide minerals aids the dissolution of carbonate gangue material (predominantly 
calcite and sometimes ankerite) from mineral veins and may also release Ca and Mg from 
the surrounding country rocks. 
The volume of carbonate gangue in mineral veins is variable and this is reflected in the 
geochemistry of drainage waters. The dissolution of minerals such as calcite is important 
in providing basic ions which help neutralise acidity produced by the oxidation of 
sulphides. This restricts the solubility of metals and thus the impact of heavy metal 
contamination is reduced. For example, in the Clogau and Vigra area (see Chapter 7.2 and 
Section 8.3.1) the calcite content of the mineral veins is very high and the resulting mine 
drainage waters are slightly alkaline (pH = 7.2-7.4). These high pH levels restrict the 
dissolution of heavy metals hence there is no significant river water contamination from 
the mines or tips in the Clogau and Vigra area. 
In the Llanrwst area variations in the carbonate content of the mineralisation also 
influence the river water geochemistry (see Chapter 7.4). Most of the mineralisation 
appears to have a relatively high carbonate content, reflected in the high pH (6.0-7.2) and 
Ca contents (3,145-52,742 gL-1) in drainage waters. At Cyffty Mine, however, . 
concentrations and pH levels are significantly lower (Ca concentrations 1,749 and 2,976 
. tgL-1, pH = 3.8 and 4.2) suggesting a lower carbonate gangue content in the mineral 
veins. The drainage at Cyffty Mine therefore has a greater impact on the aqueous 
environment by increasing the dissolution of heavy metals. 
Mineralisation at Level Goch Mine, Beddgelert (site S 13, Chapter 7.3) also appears ; to 
have a high calcite content (Ca concentration 14,328-19,257 4gL-1) producing pH values 
of 5.3-5.8 even though the precipitation of ochre in the spring (site S13) suggests the 
oxidation of significant volumes of pyrite. a=.

(jigL") from all areas (numbered as in Fig. 8.1). 
8.4.2: Al 
Al concentrations in river waters are strongly influenced by pH, due to increased 
solubility with increasing acidity. This relationship is very clearly seen in rivers in the 
Coed y Brenin area (Chapter 4.4). This is in line with the findings of previous authors 
such as Bull and Hall (1986), Birchall and Chappell (1988) an4 Goenaga' and Williams 
(1988). 
The highest Al concentrations in this study (up to 11,874 p gL-l) 
were found in acidic 
mine drainage at Gwynfynydd Mine, Coed y Brenin (pH = 3.3-5.5). Relatively high 
concentrations were also seen in drainage from Sygun Mine, Beddgelert (1,752 - 3,448 
gL-1, see Fig. 8.4) which again result from dissolution of Al by highly acidic waters (pH 
= 3.3-3.8). This is in line with the findings of Fuge et al. (1992b, 1993b) from Parys 
Mountain on Anglesey where extremely high Al concentrations of 108 mgL-1 and 174 
mgL-1 were found in acid lake waters of pH 2.3 and 2.5 respectively. These high Al 
concentrations are all clearly controlled by the low pH of the waters. 
In the Llangynog area Al does not appear to be directly controlled by pH. Aluminium 
concentrations are not significantly elevated at the high moorland site (site L2) where pH 
levels are relatively low due to a high humic acid content. The Al concentrations here are 
thought to be limited by the low availability of Al in the peaty soils or by short residence 
times allowing little time for dissolution of Al as suggested by Fuge and Perkins (1991). 
At a number of sites in the Llangynog area elevated Al concentrations are closely related 
to increased rainfall inputs as an Al flushing effect is seen following heavy rainfall 
(Chapter 5.4). The Al concentrations again show poor correlation with pH which suggests 
a different controlling influence. The Al is likely to be found in solution in a different 
form to that in Coed y Brenin, possibly in an organic complex (Chapter 5.4). 
In the Flint area Al concentrations are generally low, limited by the high pH of the 
waters. Particulate (>0.45 m) Al, however, is high (see Chapter 3.3.2). It is suggested 
that Al is precipitated as a fine particulate or colloidal phase due to the high pH and is 
held in suspension (Pearce, 1991). 
8.4.3: Mn 
Manganese shows differing behaviour between the study areas and this is thought to 
reflect different sources. In Coed y Brenin, Flint, Llanrwst and Beddgelert Mn shows 
good correlation with heavy metals such as Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd which are associated with 
vein mineralisation. Thus, the mineral veins are considered to be a major source of Mn in 
these areas. At Llangynog, however, Mn shows no significant correlation with Pb, Zn, Cu 
or Cd suggesting a source other than sulphide mineralisation for the Mn. It is proposed 
that in the Llangynog area the Mn content of sulphide minerals is low. This is supported 
by the analysis of sphalerites from the area which is discussed in Chapter 5.7. One of the 
main sources of Mn in the area is considered to be nodular phosphate bands in the Nod 
Glas Black Shale (see Chapter 5.6). 
The seasonal variations in Mn concentration show different behaviour depending on the 
source. Where the Mn is associated with sulphide mineralisation increased concentrations 
are seen in the autumn and winter months due to the washing out of elements, released by 
the oxidation of ore minerals, with increased rainfall inputs. In Llangynog, however, Mn 
concentrations are highest during periods of low flow and are diluted by inputs of 
relatively Mn-poor rainfall. This suggests that the Mn inputs in the area are dominated by 
groundwater flow which percolates through Mn-rich strata (Chapter 5.6). 
8.4.4: Ba 
Barium concentrations of river waters have not been discussed in any great detail in the 
results chapters because in general concentrations are low and little spatial variation was 
seen within each area. Barite mining was of local importance in parts of Wales, in 
particular at Cwm Orog Mine, Llangynog, Y Fan and Bryntail Mines near Llanidloes, and 
at these localities elevated Ba concentrations were found in river waters. 
The highest Ba concentration of 628 gL-1 was found at Bryntail Mine (Chapter 7.5). 
Small amounts of Ba are often associated with the sulphide vein mineralisation and this is 
reflected in slightly elevated concentrations in mine drainage for example at Llangynog 
Mine (up to 61 gL-1), Clogau Mine (up to 23 pgL-1), Level Goch, Beddgelert (up to 80 
gL-1), and the Llanrwst area (up to 79 gL-1). 
Barium and S04 concentrations from mine drainage sites are given in Table 8.4 and 
plotted in Fig. 8.5. This illustrates an inverse correlation between the two, the correlation 
coefficient calculated for log transformed data being -0.892. The S04 anion clearly has a 
controlling influence on the concentration of Ba in solution by the precipitation of 
insoluble BaSO4 with increasing SO4. This is in line with the findings of Fuge et at. 
(1992b, 1993b) in waters from other former mining areas of Wales.

It is interesting to note that the drainage from Sygun Mine near Beddgelert has low Ba 
concentrations (<1-3.4 gL-l). Sulphate data is not available from this site but the pH 
values are low (3.3-3.8) and concentrations of metals such as Cu, Zn and Pb are relatively 
high reflecting the oxidation of sulphide minerals. It is therefore likely that SO4 
concentrations are high and thus Ba solubility is restricted by BaSO4 precipitation. 
Table 8.5 shows the range of Ba concentrations in each area excluding contaminated 
mine drainage sites. Waters in the Flint area have notably higher Ba than the background 
concentrations from elsewhere. Sulphate concentrations are also generally much higher in 
the Flint area (see Section 8.4.7), with a geometric mean (GM) of 61 mgL-1 (cf. GMs <12 
mgL-1 elsewhere). Barium concentrations in the Flint area are therefore not controlled 
by the precipitation of BaSO4 as at the contaminated mine drainage sites. It is possible 
that the influence of the . carbonate geology on the 
drainage waters restricts the 
precipitation of Ba compounds thus allowing relatively high Ba concentrations to remain 
in solution. . 
8.4.5: Sr 
The major Sr source is carbonate minerals where Sr2+ substitutes readily for Ca2+. Very 
good correlation is therefore seen between Ca and Sr and there is also fairly good 
correlation with Mg (Table 8.6). The range and mean of Sr concentrations from each area 
are illustrated in Fig. 8.6. The limestone area of Flint, as would be expected, has the 
highest Sr concentrations. In the other areas high Sr concentrations result from the 
dissolution of carbonate gangue minerals by acidic mine drainage. This is particularly 
notable at Level Goch Spring, Beddgelert (see Fig. 8.6). 
8.4.6: Halogens (Cl, Br and I) 
Environmental geochemistry of Cl, Br and I 
The halogens Cl, Br and I have been mentioned only briefly in the results chapters and 
therefore a more detailed discussion of their sources and behaviour in the secondary 
environment is given here in order to understand details of Cl, Br and I in river waters in 
this study. 
A comprehensive account of the sources, of halogens in the environment and the 
influences on health is given by Fuge (1988) and includes an extensive list of references 
on the subject. Iodine and Cl are essential elements for animal health, I being one of the 
first trace elements shown to have a marked effect on health. Little is known about the 
geochemistry of Br and its possible role in animal health (Fuge, 1988). ICP-MS could 
prove to be a useful technique for furthering the knowledge of Br geochemistry. 
The Cl and I data quoted in this chapter, unless otherwise stated, were carried out by 
automated photometric methods (Fuge et al., 1985). The Br analyses are by semi- 
quantitative ICP-MS (see Chapter 3.2.4). 
Much of the Cl, Br and I on the land's surface is likely to come from atmospheric 
deposition. The halogens are released into the atmosphere from the oceans which contain 
a large proportion of the Earth's Cl, Br and I (see Table 8.7). Chlorine is considered likely 
to be transferred in a particulate form (Fuge, 1988) while Br (Duce et al,. 1965) and I 
(Correns, 1956; Miyake and Tsunogai, 1963) occur in gaseous forms. Precipitation' in 
coastal regions is therefore enriched in halogens relative to inland areas. The particulate 
Cl is likely to precipitate near the coast but Br and I may be carried some distance inland. 
Thus precipitation becomes relatively enriched in Br and I with increasing distance from 
the coast. For example, Fuge et al. (1987) report decreasing I content in rainwater with 
increasing distance from the sea in mid-Wales (2.2 gL-1 at the coast, 1.0 gL-1 84 km 
inland) while the I/Cl ratio increased. Welsh soils show a general decrease in I with 
increasing distance from the sea (Andrews et al., 1984) which is considered to reflect 
atmospheric inputs. Perel'man (1977) reports Br/Cl ratios in rainfall to be highest ' in 
inland areas. Typical Br/Cl and I/Cl ratios are given in Table 8.7. 
Geology also influences the availability of Cl, Br and I in the secondary environment. 
The Cl, Br and I contents of rocks is very variable but typical abundances in commonly 
occurring rock types are given in Table 8.8. The carbonates are particularly rich in Cl, I 
and, to a lesser extent, Br. Fuge (1989) suggested that relatively high I concentrations in 
surface waters in Northern England and Missouri, USA are a reflection of the geology of 
the areas which are both dominated by calcareous rocks. Several of the rivers examined 
by Fuge (1989) received appreciable sub-surface water inputs which may also be a source 
of I. 
Both I and Br show a strong correlation with organic matter in sediments and for this 
reason have been described as biophile elements (Goldschmidt, 1954). Peats are often 
therefore enriched in I as are the waters which drain I-rich peats (Whitehead, 1979; 
Johnson, 1980).

Chlorine and I are reported to be enriched in soils, plants and drainage waters in the 
vicinity of sulphide mineralisation (Fuge, 1972; Fuge et al., 1978; Johnson, 1980; Al- 
Ajely, 1985; Fuge et al., 1986; Fuge and Johnson, 1986; Fuge et al., 1988) and, by 
association, Br is likely to show similar behaviour (Fuge, 1988). Chlorine commonly 
occurs in fluid inclusions (Roedder, 1972) and I has been reported both in inclusions and 
incorporated in sulphide minerals (Fuge and Johnson, 1984). 
Other possible sources of Cl, Br and I are, for example, from the burning of fossil fuels 
(Daybell, 1967; Randerson, 1970; Vought et al., 1970; Perel'man, 1977), the use of rock 
salt on roads (Hutchinson, 1968; Fuge, 1988) and from some agricultural fertilisers, 
sterilants, detergents and herbicides (Whitehead, 1973; Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 
1984). 
Chlorine, Br and I in river waters informer metal mining areas of Wales 
Chlorine, Br and I data from the study areas are summarised in Table 8.9. The range and 
means of concentration from each area are illustrated in Fig. 8.7. 
The Coed y Brenin and Llangynog areas show relatively low Cl, Br and I contents. 
Bromine concentrations in Coed y Brenin are generally slightly higher at sites associated 
with mineralisation (see Table 4.2). The maximum Br concentration of 154 tgL-1 being 
seen in the tip drainage at Gwynfynydd Mine (site C7). Iodine is also slightly elevated at 
this site with a maximum concentration of 3.5 gL-1 (cf. concentrations generally < 2.0 
gL-1 at all other sites in the area). Chlorine concentrations in the Coed y Brenin rivers 
are generally low (6.9-23 mgL-1) and show very little spatial variation across the area. 
There are no elevated Cl concentrations in drainage associated with the sulphide 
mineralisation. 
The lowest halogen contents are seen in the Llangynog area and are presumably a 
reflection of the distance from the sea. Chlorine contents are very low (5.7-17 mgL-1, 
mean = 9.1 mgL-1) showing little spatial variation and no elevation in mine drainage 
sites. The Cl contents of river waters in this area are likely to result from weathering of. 
bedrock. Iodine concentrations are relatively high at site L2 (4.5 and 6.5 . tgL-1) and are 
attributed to the washing out of I from peat. 
Concentrations of Cl, Br and I are all significantly higher in the Flint area than elsewhere. 
This is likely to be the result of a number of factors which were discussed above: (i) 
elevated Cl, Br and I in rainfall in a coastal area; (ii) elevated concentrations in the 
limestone bedrock; (iii) a large proportion of the area is agricultural land which maybe 
contaminated with Cl, Br and I; (iv) low flows and a high proportion of sub-surface water 
inputs and (v) sulphide mineralisation. 
It would be of interest to examine in detail the concentrations and ratios of C1, Br and I in 
rocks, soils, mineralisation, precipitation, groundwater, etc. to assess the relative 
importance of the possible sources of these halogens to the surface drainage in the area.  
In the other areas elevated Cl, Br and I concentrations appear to be directly related to 
sulphide mineralisation. Waters in the Clogau and Vigra area have relatively high`"Br' 
concentrations (>100 ggL-1) in drainage from the mines and tips but C1 and I are low 
(<20 mgL-1 Cl, <2.2 ggL-1 I). Bromine concentrations in the Beddgelert area are all 
fairly high (means >25 ggL-1, see Chapter 7.3) but extreme concentrations (up to 3,870 
tgL-1) are seen in the drainage at Level Goch (site S 13) reflecting unusually high levels 
associated with the mineralisation at this site. Chlorine and I are also markedly high, (up 
to 96 mgL-I Cl and 22 gL-11, by ICP-MS, in the Level Goch Spring). Chlorine levels 
elsewhere in the Beddgelert area are low (8.4-17 mgL-I). Even Sygun Mine drainage, 
which is markedly contaminated with Cu and Zn, shows low Cl (10-11 mgL-I) and only 
slightly elevated Br concentrations (mean 69 tgL-I). This reflects very different 
mineralogy in the sulphide veins, even within a small area. 
In the Llanrwst area high Br in river waters is also associated with mining, especially in 
the drainage from Parc Mine (sites S 19 and S20) where Br concentrations >200 tgL-1 are 
seen. Chlorine concentrations, however, are not significantly elevated. 
Extremely high Cl concentrations are seen in tip drainage at Fan (up to 203 mgL-1 at site 
DF9b, see Chapter 7.5). Bromine concentrations are also high at Fan (up to 426 gL-1 at 
site DF9c) but the highest Br concentration seen in the Fan and Dylife area is 741. tgL-l 
at Bryntail Mine (site DF6). ' 
In these 4 areas, sampled seasonally, the halogen concentrations were generally highest 
either in October 1990 or February 1991. This presumably reflects higher halogen inputs 
with increased rainfall in autumn and winter and/or increased flushing of Cl, Br and I 
from mines, soils and tip materials.

Ratios of Br/Cl and I/Cl are also listed in Table 8.9. As discussed above, and shown in 
Table 8.7, the ratios might be expected to decrease with increasing distance from the 
coast (Fuge, 1988). This, however, does not appear to apply to the river waters in this 
study due to the strong association of the halogens Cl, Br and I with sulphide 
mineralisation and the markedly different geology of the Flint area. Most notable are the 
high Br/Cl ratios seen in drainage associated with mineralisation in the Clogau and Vigra, 
Fan and Dylife and Beddgelert areas. Other Br/Cl ratios are generally lower than the 
values proposed by Fuge (1988) (see Table 8.7). I/Cl ratios are also relatively low 
compared to those of Fuge (1988) possibly because mean I concentrations found in this 
study are lower than the typical value of 4 tgL-1 in surface runoff quoted by Fuge 
(1988). The I/Cl ratios at Llangynog are the highest seen in this study. There appears to 
be very little Cl, Br or I associated with the mineralisation at Llangynog and the elevated 
I/Cl ratio may therefore be a reflection of the distance from the coast. 
In summary, elevated concentrations of the halogens Cl, Br and I have been found in river 
waters in former metalliferous mining areas of Wales reflecting their association with 
sulphide mineralisation. The occurrence of Cl, Br and I in the mineralisation is very 
variable and this is reflected in the river water geochemistry. For example, concentrations 
of Cl, Br and I in the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog areas are low. The mineralisation at 
Level Goch Mine, Beddgelert is extremely rich in Cl, I and, particularly, Br and that at 
Fan is enriched in Cl. The elevated Cl, Br and I concentrations in the Flint area are 
attributable to several factors: (i) the carbonate geology; (ii) the marine influence; (iii) 
agricultural contamination; (iv) high sub-surface drainage inputs and (v) sulphide 
mineralisation. 
8.4.7: Sulphate 
Sulphate analyses were carried out on -100. samples by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC). In general, background levels in most of the areas studied are 
<20 mgL-1. This is in line with the average SO4 content in river waters given by 
Turekian (1977) of 11.1 mgL-1. In the Flint area, however, SO4 concentrations range 
from 24-189 mgL-1 with a mean of 68 mgL-1. The source of this high SO4 is unclear but 
it is possible that the high concentrations in solution are the result of complex formation 
due to the high alkalinity and total dissolved solids in river waters, influenced by the 
Carboniferous Limestone of NE Wales. 
With the exception of the Flint samples SO4 concentrations >20 mgL-1 were all found in 
waters 'draining mines or waste tip material. The SO4 is released by the oxidation of 
sulphide minerals, particularly pyrite (see Chapter 4.3). The elevated SO4 concentrations, 
not surprisingly, therefore, are found in samples with low pH. Sulphate concentrations 
also correlate well with metals found in and associated with sulphide minerals (Table 
8.10). 
As discussed above (Section 8.4.4), in drainage from barite-bearing mines, the S04 
content controls Ba concentrations by the precipitation of BaSO4. Sulphate has also been 
found to influence Pb concentrations in solution, by the precipitation of PbSO4, in waters 
from mining areas elsewhere in Wales (Fuge et al., 1993b) but this was not found to be a 
controlling factor in river waters in this study. 
8.5: Summary 
The achievements of this study are considered in the 3 following sections under the 
headings set out in the Aims in Chapter 1.5. 
Impact of former metal mines on river water geochemistry 
The former activities of man in the mining of metalliferous ores have left dumps of waste 
material which are mostly still bare of vegetation 70+ years after the cessation of mining. 
Mining and ore treatment processes increase the surface area prone to weathering -and 
thus greatly increases the environmental impact over natural contamination from the 
mineralisation itself. 
This study has described the geochemistry of river waters in 7 former metalliferous 
mining areas of Wales. In most of these areas contaminant metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu etc. ) in 
solution reflect the presence of sulphide mineralisation. The contaminant metals found, 
and their relative concentrations are a reflection of the type of mineralisation in each area. 
Elevated concentrations of other elements (eg. Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Ba, Sr, etc. ) may also be 
found in association with mineralisation. 
One exception to this is the Clogau and Vigra area where the presence of sulphide 
mineralisation and the former mining activities appear to have no detrimental effect 'on 
the geochemistry of river waters in the area. 
In most areas there are a number of point sources of highly contaminated mine or tip 
drainage. However, in most cases their impact on the main river systems is not very great 
because metals are lost from solution by precipitation, adsorption and dilution processes. 
The. A. Mawddach in Coed y Brenin however, is an exception. Here Zn concentrations are 
consistently well above the EEC recommended level, in soft waters supporting salmonoid 
fish life, of 30 pgL'l. The Mawddach is a popular fishing river but the fish population is 
likely to be suffering the deleterious effects of Zn contamination. Further outbursts, such 
as that seen from Gwynfynydd in May 1990, or inadequate pollution control when the 
mine is reopened would be likely to have a very serious effect on the aquatic life in the 
Mawddach. 
The outburst illustrates the need to leave or maintain abandoned mines in a "safe" 
condition and the necessity to exercise great care during any future activities in mining 
areas to prevent serious pollution events due to the release of contaminated water from 
old mines. 
Fan is another obvious and serious site of heavy metal contamination. The extensiveness 
of the tips and the fine nature of the material are a more serious problem than adit 
drainage from the mine itself. Extremely high concentrations of heavy metals are washed 
from the tip material especially during periods of heavy rain. The waste tips area also 
potentially hazardous during dry spells when they are very prone to wind erosion which 
carries air-bourne pollution to the surrounding area. Fan is the site where the highest 
concentrations of heavy metals were found during this study, and is most obviously. in 
need of reclamation work to stabilise the tip material. 
Comparison of different geological areas 
The large number of analyses made possible by ICP-MS enabled the comparison of 
waters from several areas with different background geology. Different rock, types are 
reflected in the geochemistry of drainage waters, most notably in their major element (eg. 
Ca and Mg) contents. For example, the Ca contents of drainage waters from different 
rock types decreases in the order carbonates > intermediate igneous rocks > slates-and 
shales. Trace element contents may also vary and this is seen clearly in waters draining 
the Carboniferous Limestone in NE Wales which have elevated levels of, for example, 
Ba, Sr and I over concentrations seen elsewhere in Wales. 
The control of background geology on drainage waters in an area also influences the 
impact of contaminated metals from mine drainage controlling the buffering capacity and 
pH levels. Highly buffered waters with high pH are better able to neutralise inputs of acid 
mine drainage causing precipitation of metals than acidic waters with low buffering 
capacity. 
Seasonal variations in river water geochemistry 
Monthly sampling in the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog areas has enabled the 
identification of trends in river water geochemistry which are related to flow and 
therefore vary seasonally. Similar patterns of behaviour are seen consistently at different 
sites and in different study areas and are therefore considered to be the general seasonal 
patterns and not just a function of hydrological factors at one particular site. Not all 
elements vary in the same manner, for example, the contaminant metals, Zn, Pb, Cu and 
Cd along with others such as Al, Mn and Ba tend to show low summer/high winter 
concentration patterns due to increased dissolution and washing out of metals with 
increased throughflow. Background levels of calcium and Mg, however, show high 
summer/low winter concentrations due to a dilution effect by increased rainfall inputs and 
the reduced time available for dissolution with increased flow. 
This has very important implications when using river water samples in geochemical 
surveys for purposes such as mineral exploration or environmental monitoring. In some 
cases element variations up to several orders of ' magnitude have been found between 
winter and summer samples. It is likely that these variations are not related only to flow 
in the rivers at the time of sampling but the seasonal availability of elements has a 
significant controlling influence. Careful consideration must therefore be made of surface 
water geochemical data especially when comparing data from samples collected at 
different times. 
In the Flint area monthly variations in element concentrations and pH do not show 
obvious seasonal trends. This is attributed to the complex nature of the drainage system in 
the Carboniferous Limestone which is dominated by sub-surface and ground water flow. 
The implications of this to the use of surface water drainage surveys are likely to be even 
more complex as not even a rough estimate of seasonal patterns can be predicted. 
Suggestions for future research, which was the final aim listed in Chapter 1.5, are 
discussed at the end of the conclusions in the following chapter. 
CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSIONS- 
In this chapter a series of single points are made summarising the major conclusions of 
this thesis. 
9.1: Methodology 
1. ICP-MS has proved to be an invaluable instrument for-the analysis of large numbers of 
water samples due to the ease of rapid analysis (--3 rains per sample) and high sensitivity 
for a wide range of elements. 
2. The so called "semi-quantitative" analysis by ICP-MS 'gives detection limits (at 3 
standard deviations) which are mostly <1 tgL-1, with accuracy and reproducibility 
suitable for reconnaissance surveys of river water geochemistry. Semi-quantitative 
analyses agree with fully quantitative data mostly to within +/- 30% and often agreement 
is much better than this. For example, 95% of Cu values are within +/- 14% and 78% of 
Pb determinations are within +/- 22%. The relative standard deviations on duplicate 'pairs 
of analyses are mostly within +/- 20% indicating precision within the range of accuracy 
of semi-quantitative analysis. 
3. In most cases it is not necessary to 'filter and acidify water samples in the field. It is, 
however, advisable to filter samples in high pH waters, such as those draining Ithe 
Carboniferous Limestone rocks in NE Wales, to remove Al-bearing particulate material 
from suspension. 
9.2: Results 
Contaminant metals 
4. The type and extent of mineralisation is clearly reflected in the chemistry of river 
waters draining mineralised areas. For` example, areas dominated by Pb-Zn or by Cu 
mineralisation are clearly distinguished. The trace element content of the ore minerals 
themselves may also be reflected in river water chemistry. This is shown particularly 
clearly by the Mn-poor, but relatively Cd-rich sphalerites of Llangynog, which result in 
low Mn contents and low Zn/Cd ratios in drainage waters. 
5. Zinc is generally the most abundant contaminant metal found due to the high solubility 
of ZnSO4 at the pH levels found in the natural waters examined in this study. The high 
Zn contents also reflect the abundance of sphalerite in tip material and in mineral veins. 
Concentrations >82,000 gL-1 have been found in the most contaminated tip drainage. 
6. Sphalerites commonly contain Cd and are the most likely source of all Cd found in 
mine drainage waters: The behaviour of Cd in the secondary environment is, in general, 
closely related to that of Zn. The ratios of Zn/Cd at individual sites (except where ochre is 
precipitating, see 9) is remarkably consistent through time as seen in the tip drainage, at 
Gwynfynydd (site C7) and Llangynog (site L7) and in the Fan and Dylife areas. 
7. Differences in the Zn/Cd ratios in drainage waters between the different study areas 
may, as in the cases of Coed y Brenin and Llangynog, be attributed to varying Cd content 
of sphalerites, the Llangynog sphalerites being richer. in Cd than those from Coed, y 
Brenin. In the Fan area, however, low Zn/Cd ratios in waters are not related to Cd-rich 
sphalerites. The Fan tip material, during the 70+ years since the closure of the mine, has 
become relatively enriched in Cd due to the preferential weathering of Zn (Fuge et al., 
1993a). ZnS weathers to the highly soluble ZnSO4 while Cd, which is more chalcophile, 
tends to be left behind as relatively insoluble CdS. The Fan tips are thus relatively 
enriched in Cd which results in the low Zn/Cd ratios in drainage waters in the area. 
8. The precipitation of ochre is a major controlling factor on the chemistry of mine. 
drainage. For example, in the ochreous outburst from Gwynfynydd Mine (site G2) Zn/Cd 
ratios are highly variable with time. The Zn/Cd ratio in the water from the outflow 
decreased during the year following the outburst from 884-196. This is attributed to the 
preferential scavenging of Cd by ochre (Fuge et al., 1993a, 1993b). Initially large 
amounts of ochre precipitated from the waters which had built up in the mine. As the 
precipitation of ochre decreased with time less Cd was scavenged from solution and the 
Cd content of the water increased relative to that of Zn thus reducing the Zn/Cd ratio. 
9. The maximum Cu concentration found during this study was 885 9gL-1 although 
CuSO4, the common weathering product of chalcopyrite, is mobile in acid, oxygenating 
environments. The mobility of Cu in the secondary environment appears to be limited by' 
precipitation and adsorption reactions with organic matter and Fe and Mn oxides and 
hydroxides. This restricts the use of Cu determinations in surface drainage surveys to 
locate Cu mineralisation because Cu anomalies are more likely to be found in stream 
sediments. 
10. The movement of groundwater is important in the transport of Cu in the Coed y 
Brenin area as shown by high Cu concentrations in groundwater seepages, the 
precipitation of secondary Cu minerals and the development of Cu-rich bogs. 
11. Lead has been found at concentrations of up to 9,671 tgL-1 in tip drainage at Fan but 
more typical upper concentrations in mine and tip drainage reach a few hundred tgL-1. 
Lead mobility is restricted by the relative insolubility of the weathering products of 
galena. 
12. The presence of Co and Ni in contaminated drainage reflects the oxidation of pyrite in 
mines and tip waste. This is a useful indicator of the presence of pyrite mineralisation in 
areas where pH levels are near neutral due to the dissolution of carbonate gangue 
minerals, eg. at Parc Mine near Llanrwst. 
13. Unusually high concentrations of - REE have been found in tip drainage at 
Gwynfynydd. The contents are of the order of 1,000 times greater than the average 
contents of river waters. The elevated REE levels here are thought to be associated with 
carbonate gangue minerals in the sulphide veins. 
14. REE contents of mine drainage at Gwynfynydd, normalised to NASC show markedly 
different patterns to those described from uncontaminated 'rivers. The Gwynfynydd 
waters are slightly enriched in the middle REE rather than showin&flat or slightly HREE 
enriched patterns more typical of uncontaminated waters. The patterns may be a 
reflection of the source composition or due to the differing behaviour of individual REEs 
in the secondary environment. 
15.. The seasonal variations in contaminant metals tend to show patterns of low 
summer/high winter concentrations due to the increased washing out of metals by an 
increased rate of flow through tip material during the wetter winter period. "Flushing" 
peaks may be seen following dry summer periods when oxidation in waste tips increases 
and subsequent rainfall "washes out" the soluble oxidation products of the sulphides 
which have built up in the tip material. 
pH: Controls and influences 
16. pH is an important factor controlling metal concentrations in both contaminated and 
non-contaminated waters as the solubility of many elements increases with decreasing 
17. The. source of-much-of the acidity in the rivers in this study is natural organic acids 
from peaty upland areas. The influence of acid rain and coniferous afforestation are also 
likely to be contributory factors. In former metal mining areas inputs of acid mine 
drainage (see conclusion 21) are of local importance. 
18. pH values vary seasonally with general patterns of high summer/low winter levels 
corresponding to low and high flow periods respectively. Increased flow during wetter 
months flushes out more organic acids and also increases the rate of throughflow of sub- 
surface drainage, thus reducing the time available for dissolution of basic ions which 
neutralise acidity. This corresponds with seasonal variations seen in Ca and Mg 
11 concentrations which tend to show a strong correlation with pH. , 11 -_ 
19. Seasonal variations in pH will also influence the seasonal changes in heavy metal 
concentrations. Low pH values in winter will assist in the dissolution of minerals thus 
contributing to the high winter/low summer patterns of concentrations of contaminant 
metals (see conclusion 15) and other metals such as Al, Mn and Ba. 
20. The Ca and Mg content of river waters has an important influence on the pH of water 
and its buffering capacity, ie. the ability of a water body to neutralise acidic inputs. The 
Ca and Mg content of river waters in these study areas is strongly controlled, by 
background geology with buffering capacity decreasing in the order carbonates => 
intermediate igneous rocks > slates and shales. The pH values of waters draining the 
limestone rocks of NE Wales are therefore relatively high compared with values from 
other areas of volcanic and siliclastic rocks. 
21. Highly acidic mine drainage results from the release of sulphuric acid during the 
breakdown of FeS2 minerals, possibly with some additions from other sulphides. The 
lowest pH levels encountered in this study (pH <4.0) were all associated with ' mine 
drainage. Not all mine and tip drainage is necessarily highly acidic. In some cases, eg. 
Llangynog tip drain (site L7) the relatively high mean pH of 6.3, is attributed to the low 
pyrite content of the mineralisation. At Parc Mine near Llanrwst, however, (mean pH 7.1) 
the oxidation of some pyrite is suggested by the high concentrations of Co and Ni in 
solution (see conclusion 12) and by the precipitation of ochre, but the acidity produced is 
neutralised by the dissolution of carbonate gangue minerals (mainly calcite and possibly'. 
some ankerite). The increasing Ca and Mg contents thus raise the buffering capacity 'as 
discussed above (conclusion 20). At most mines in the Llanrwst area Ca and, Mg 
concentrations are relatively high resulting in pH values in the range 6.0-7.2. At Cyffty 
Mine, however, Ca and Mg are much lower and pH levels of 3.8 and 4.2 were found. This 
is thought to indicate that at Cyffty there is less calcite in the gangue material than at 
other mines studied in the area. The carbonate gangue content of mineral veins thus has 
an important control on the impact of heavy metal contamination from mines by reducing 
the acidity of drainage waters. The increased pH helps - reduce the solubility of 
contaminant metals. The harmful effects of heavy metals are also reduced at increased 
levels of water hardness which is a function of the Ca and Mg content. 
22. pH has an important (although not exclusive) control on Al concentrations. In most 
cases Al concentrations increase with decreasing pH values due to increased solubility at 
lower pH. In the Llangynog area however, Al concentrations do not correlate with pH but 
roughly show a direct relationship with rainfall inputs. It is suggested that Al, in this case, 
is found in solution in a different form than elsewhere, possibly as an organic complex 
which is washed out of the near-surface soil horizons during periods of increased 
throughflow. 
Other elements 
23. High Mn concentrations are generally associated with contaminated mine drainage 
because it occurs in minor or trace amounts in sulphide minerals such as sphalerite, pyrite 
and chalcopyrite. Manganese therefore tends to show good positive correlation with 
contaminant metals such as Zn, Pb and Cd reflecting their mutual source. The Mn content 
of mine and tip drainage in the Llangynog area, however, is' very low' and shows no 
significant correlation with contaminant metals and suggests that the mineralisation in the 
Llangynog area is low in Mn. This is supported by the analysis of sphalerite samples from 
Llangynog which contain much lower Mn than sphalerites from Coed y Brenin. The high 
Mn concentrations in waters at Berwyn Mine near Llangynog, are thought to come from 
nodular phosphate bands in the Nod Glas Black Shale. 
24. Barium concentrations in contaminated drainage from barite-bearing mines are 
limited by the precipitation of insoluble BaSO4 with increasing SO4 anion contents. In 
uncontaminated drainage Ba contents reflect the background geology. For example, Ba 
concentrations are relatively high in rivers draining the Carboniferous Limestone in NE 
Wales. 
25. Elevated concentrations of the halogens Cl, Br and I in mine and tip drainage reflects 
their association with sulphide mineralisation. The Cl, Br and I contents at individual 
sites are extremely variable. For example, elevated concentrations of Cl, I and, 
particularly, Br are seen at Level Goch Mine Beddgelert while the drainage waters from 
Fan are rich in Cl. Mine drainage in the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog areas does not 
show significantly elevated Cl, Br or I contents. 
26. Rivers draining the'Carboniferous Limestone area of Flint show elevated Cl, Br and I 
concentrations which are attributed to a combination of a number of factors in addition to 
association with sulphide mineralisation. These include: (i) the carbonate geology, (ii) 
proximity, to the sea, (iii) agricultural contamination and (iv), a large proportion of sub- 
surface drainage inputs. 
General comments and seasonal variations 
27. The geochemistry of river waters is dependant on the complex interactions of many 
controlling influences: geology and mineralisation; the geochemical behaviour of 
elements (eg. - solubility, precipitation, adsorption and complex formation); the 
geochemical environment, particularly pH and Eh; and rainfall (composition, volume and 
frequency). 
28: Examination of seasonal variation in river water geochemistry and the comparison of 
different geological areas has enabled identification of complex inter-relationships 
between individual aspects of river water geochemistry. Most notable is the close 
relationship between pH, Ca, Mg and Al but strong links between Zn and Cd, and Ba and 
SO4 have also been identified. 
29. -Wide seasonal variations in element concentrations, sometimes of several orders, of 
magnitude, have been recorded. In general, Ca. and Mg show seasonal patterns of high 
summer/ low winter concentrations while metals such as Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd Al, Mn and Ba 
tend to show low summer/high winter patterns of concentrations. The variations appear to 
be related not only to flow at the time of sampling but also to seasonal changes in the 
availability of various elements. The summers of 1989 and 1990 were both relatively dry 
which will influence the seasonal patterns. In years with very different weather, other 
seasonal patterns may be observed. The simplicity with which surface waters can be 
sampled and the increasing availability of rapid analytical techniques such as ICP-MS 
make it extremely easy to accumulate vast quantities of data on river water geochemistry. 
It must be stressed that it is extremely important to make :a careful examination of 
the data with consideration of the wide range of possible variables. This becomes 
especially important when comparing samples which were collected at different times of 
the year and under different conditions. 
Environmental impact, 
30. The impact of sulphide mineralisation and former mining activities on the 
geochemistry of river waters considered in this study is generally not very great. Local 
sources of heavy metal contaminated drainage are evident in all but one of the study areas 
but elevated concentrations do not persist far from the sources of contamination due to 
precipitation, adsorption and dilution effects. Thus the heavy metal concentrations in 
main rivers or in tributaries at some distance from mineralisation are not greatly elevated. 
For example Pb and Zn values, in most cases, do not exceed the EEC recommended 
levels (Welsh Office, 1985) for waters supporting aquatic life. There are, however, two 
notable exceptions: ., 
(i) The high Zn concentrations seen in the A. Mawddach, Coed y Brenin and the potential 
for future hazardous outbursts from Gwynfynydd, carrying not only harmful 
concentrations of heavy metals but also producing an ochreous precipitation on 
the river bed, smothering benthic fauna and destroying spawning grounds. 
(ii) The extensive, barren waste tips at Fan (and, to a much lesser extent, Dylife) where 
extremely high concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd are washed out of the unstable tip 
material, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall. . 
9.3: Suggestions for future research 
It has been found during this study that many complex and inter-related factors affect the 
geochemistry of river waters. The influence of flow, particulate matter, element 
speciation etc. has been mentioned briefly but detailed investigation of their control, 
element, concentrations and variations has not been made here. Future research in 
individual areas could concentrate on such factors. 4 
Specific projects that are worthy of further research include: 
(i) Controls on Al concentrations such as pH or complex formation. In many cases Al 
concentrations in solution appear to be controlled by pH but this is not always so. 
For example, in the Llangynog area Al availability seems to be related to the rate 
of throughflow in soil horizons. In rivers in the Flint area the controls on Al in 
solution are apparently different again. Here Al is held in suspension in some kind 
of colloidal or fine particulate form, possibly due to the high pH of the water. 
(ii) The study of REE in the secondary environment. Relatively little is known about the 
geochemistry of the REE in natural waters but more information could be very 
useful for exploration purposes. The REE concentrations found in mine drainge at 
Gwynfynydd are unusually high and most likely reflect their association with vein 
mineralisation. The patterns observed may be an indication of REE behaviour in 
the secondary environment or a reflection of the geochemistry of the source 
material. ICP-MS would prove invaluable in further stfdies of this kind. 
(iii) The sources of Cl, Br and I and their behaviour in the secondary environment. There 
is a known association between the halogens and sulphide mineralisation but their 
concentrations and relative proportions are highly'variable. In the Flint area, the 
elevated Cl, Br and I are likely to result from a number of factors and a more 
detailed investigation of concentrations and ratios in rocks, soils, mineralisation, 
groundwater, rain water, etc. would be necessary to identify the relative 
importance of these various sources to the surface drainage. 
Between the summers of 1991 and 1992,  after completion of the sampling program for 
this study, reclamation work has been undertaken by the Welsh Development Agency 
(WDA) at Hafna and Cyffty Mines near Llanrwst. Tipmaterial has been stabilised and 
vegetated and steams lined and diverted to reduce erosion of the tips. Further reclamation 
has also been carried out at Parc Mine. It would be of interest to examine what effects this 
has had on the geochemistry of the rivers in the area. 
There are plans by the WDA for similar reclamation projects at a further 53 sites in the 
area at an estimated cost of 15 million. Before this is done a more detailed investigation 
of the impact of the mines, not only on river waters, but on the whole surrounding 
environment, should be carried out. Preservation of industrial archaeology, sites - of 
mineralogical interest and unusual habitats supporting metal tolerant plant species are 
factors which must be weighed against the reduction of heavy metal contamination which 
is hopefully achieved and the creation of, what some people consider, a more pleasing 
landscape. 
During the period of this study there were no operational mines in the areas considered. 
However, with plans for future mining at Clogau and Gwynfynydd Gold Mines 
monitoring of the effects on local river water geochemistry is very important. Currently 
there is no heavy metal contamination in the rivers in the Clogau area. Any future 
contamination will be the direct result of mining activities and therefore the responsibility 
of the mining company. 
Monitoring of the geochemistry of the Mawddach during future operations at 
Gwynfynydd will be very important as aquatic life in the river is already under pressure 
from Zn contamination. Any increase in heavy metal inputs or, another outburst of heavily 
contaminated water from the mine is likely to have a devastating effect on the biota. 
It is hoped that this study has provided a useful baseline of element river water 
geochemistry in these former metal mining areas of Wales against which an assessment 
of the impact of any future mining activities can be made.

The use of ICP-MS for the analysis of natural 
waters and an evaluation of sampling techniques 
Fiona M. Pearce

Abstract 
Analytical and sampling methods for a reconnaissance survey of river waters in former metal mining areas of 
Wales, UK, are considered. A 'semi-quantitative' mode of analysis with a single internal standard, possible by 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is compared with more conventional 'quantitative' 
ICP-MS methods using external calibration from aqueous standards. 'Semi-quantitative' analysis can be much 
quicker than a more rigorous quantitative approach and gives values which agree with fully quantitative data 
to within 30%, indeed, agreement is often much better than this. A comparison of samples filtered and acidified 
in the field with untreated samples is also presented. This shows that in most cases it is unnecessary to filter 
and acidify samples if the storage time before analysis is short (in this case typically less than four days). 
Introduction 
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) 
is an ideal technique for the analysis of natural waters. It 
enables rapid multi-element analysis of very low 
concentrations of elements in solution. Metal contents in 
natural waters at concentrations down to tg L'1 level can 
be determined directly with no need for preconcentration. 
Other previously used techniques for water analysis, such 
as flame or graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry, do not allow simultaneous 
multi-element analysis and often require time-consuming 
dilutions for major elements (e. g. Na, K, Ca), and 
preconcentrations to achieve equivalent detection limits for 
some trace elements. 
ICP-AES (atomic emission spectrometry) has been 
used for routine water analysis but typically 
preconcentration is necessary for elements other than Na, 
K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Fe, B, S, Si (Thompson and Walsh, 
1989). In general, ICP-MS has detection limits often 1-2 
orders of magnitude lower than ICP-AES (Thompson and 
Walsh, 1989) and the mass spectra produced are relatively 
simple, whereas the optical spectra in ICP-AES suffer 
problems with many overlapping spectral lines (Houk, 
1986). Na, Mg, K, Ca, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Mo, 
Cd, Sb, Ba, Ti, Pb and U may be routinely analysed directly 
without preconcentration (Beauchemin et al., 1987; 
Garbarino and Taylor, 1987). Various calibration methods 
are applied using external standards, standard additions, 
isotope dilution techniques and internal standardisation. 
Overviews of ICP-MS as applied to natural water analysis 
are given by Taylor (1989) and Thompson and Walsh 
(1989). 
This study considers the merits of so called 
'semi-quantitative' analysis by ICP-MS using a single 
internal standard. This method is compared to a more 
rigorous 'fully quantitative' approach using external 
calibration with aqueous standards. 
A VG Elemental PlasmaQuad II+ ICP-MS at the 
Institute of Earth Studies in Aberystwyth is being used in 
a study of the geochemistry of river waters in former metal 
mining areas of North and Mid Wales. These areas include 
(see Figure 1): 
(a) Coed y Brenin, Gwynedd - Cu-Pb-Zn veins with 
minor Au, Ag, and As and disseminated Cu 
mineralisation in Cambrian sediments and volcanics. 
(b) Llangynog, Powys - predominantly Pb-Zn vein 
mineralisation in Ordovician sediments and volcanics. 
(c) Flint, Clwyd - Pb-Zn mineralisation in Carboniferous 
Limestone. 
In a study covering large areas such as this, it is 
desirable to have a fast and efficient sampling and 
analytical program. In this respect ICP-MS is ideal for 
producing rapid multi-element analyses. 
The need to filter and acidify natural water samples 
in the field has also been examined. Some elements may, 
be lost from solution by adsorption onto suspended 
particulate matter or onto the walls of plastic containers. 
To prevent this, samples are often filtered and acidified in 
the field (Batley and Gardner, 1977). Filtration through a 0.45 pm filter may also provide a distinction between 
suspended particulate (>0.45 gm) and dissolved material 
(Riley, 1975). As ICP-MS allows very rapid analysis of 
large numbers of samples, the need to store samples over 
long periods of time is removed, thus any losses from 
solution during storage are accordingly minimised. A 
comparison of filtered-acidified samples with untreated 
samples is made.

ICP-MS Analysis 
In semi-quantitative analysis a response curve of the 
variation in instrument sensitivity across the mass range is 
used for calibration. A relatively smooth curve is produced 
which takes into account the degree of ionisation of the 
elements and their isotopic abundances. The actual shape 
of the curve depends on the operating conditions of the 
instrument, so a new response curve is generated each time 
the instrument is used for semi- quantitative analysis. A 
solution, commonly of 6-8 elements spanning the mass 
range to be considered, is used to define the response curve. 
In this case, the solution contains 100 g L1 each of Be, 
Mg, Co, In, La, Pb and U. A typical response curve is 
shown in Figure 2. 
A known quantity of a  spike', in this case 100 g U-1 
In, is added to each sample as an internal standard. In is 
used because it is near the centre of the mass range, is an 
uncommon element and may be assumed to be absent from 
the samples. The In response for each sample is used in the 
calibration of element concentrations by comparison to the 
response curve. The internal In standard also has the added 
advantage of measuring any change in sensitivity between 
samples and thus compensates for instrument drift. During 
analysis the mass range 6-240 is scanned 100 times in 
-1 min to collect a spectrum. This is a very rapid method 
of analysis; a skilled operator is able to analyse up to 20 
samples in an hour.

Figure 2A typical ICP-, MS instrument response curve. 
Quantitative analysis is conducted in this case using 
four aqueous standards to produce a calibration line of 
concentration against response for each element 
considered. The average of three 100-scan runs is taken 
which, added to the extra preparation time of the standards, 
makes this method much slower (up to a maximum of 8 
samples in an hour). As the values for each element are 
determined independently and from more scans, it is 
assumed that the quantitative data will be of greater 
accuracy than that determined semi-quantitatively. Thus, 
the quantitative data are used here as a reference against 
which to assess the accuracy of the semi-quantitative data.

Sampling Techniques 
Samples were collected in 60 mL polythene bottles which 
had been previously soaked for 24 hours in 10% HNO3, 
rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and air dried. In the 
field, the bottles were rinsed three times with river water 
before sample collection. Two samples were collected at 
each location, of which one was filtered through a 0.45 tm 
Millipore filter and acidified to 0.05 M with BDH Aristar 
HNO3. Samples were refrigerated as soon as possible and 
analysed by semi- quantitative ICP-MS within four days 
of collection. Examples of determinations in treated and 
untreated samples are compared in Figure 4. 
Results and Discussions 
Figure 3 shows examples of comparisons between 
semi-quantitative and quantitative analyses of the same 
samples. Semi-quantitative results are normally within 
 30% of the quantitative values for concentrations >10 
tg L-1. Mn values are within  25% and Cu within  14%. 
Mg and Al values show slightly more variation. This may 
be a function of the response curve where a small variation 
in In response will produce bigger variations in element 
determinations at the lighter end of the mass range. The 
errors are internally consistent as indicated by the high 
correlation coefficients (r) shown on Figure 3. It is clear, 
however, that good correlations are seen for the different 
methods, indicating that semi-quantitative analysis 
produces suitable results for this type of reconnaissance 
study where great accuracy is not considered essential. 
A comparison between filtered-acidified and 
untreated samples (Figure 4) shows differences only within 
the variation described above for semi-quantitative analysis 
for all determinations except Al. It is thus suggested that if 
samples are to be stored for only short periods, filtering and 
acidification in the field is unnecessary in most cases. 
A similarly good correlation between filtered and 
acidified, and untreated samples is seen for Al with 
exception of the five samples from the limestone area of 
Flint (see Figure 4). These five samples show significantly 
lower Al content in the filtered samples. Some of the Al 
measured in the untreated samples appears to reside in a 
particulate phase (>0.45 m) which has been filtered out, 
The pH of these samples is in the range 7.8-8.7, whereas 
the pH of the Coed y Brenin and Llangynog samples range 
between 3.2-7.3. Plots of Al content against pH (Figure 5) 
indicate decreasing Al solubility with increasing alkilinity. 
It is suggested that in the case of the samples from the 
limestone areas, Al may precipitate as a fine particulate 
phase due to the high pH and is held in suspension. Further 
speciation studies are necessary to support this, but care 
must be taken when considering the Al contents of 
unfiltered waters of high pH. 
For Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn and Pb, however, there appears 
to be no such problem involving a particulate phase,, 
indicating that for these elements the unfiltered samples 
give a true indication of their dissolved metal contents. 
Conclusions 
For this type of rapid reconnaissance survey, the quicker 
F. M. Pearce 
and easily executed semi-quantitative method of ICP-MS 
analysis is recommended. As this allows large numbers of 
analyses to be made very quickly, time can also be saved 
by not filtering and acidifying samples in the field with no 
loss of analytical validity.

the north Ceredigion area, mid-Wales 4

Abstract 
Routine monitoring of the public water supply in Aberystwyth revealed high levels of aluminium during November 
1989. These levels were twelve times the EEC recommended level and three times the maximum permitted 
level. While the reservoirs supplying the region and the streams draining their upland peaty catchment areas 
generally contain moderate levels of Al, Al salts added as coagulating agents are a major source. There is also 
considerable variation of the Al in potable waters through the month of November 1989 for an Aberystwyth 
supply. Private supplies, from groundwaters, in the region generally contain low Al. 
While most drinking waters in the region contain low Pb, values close to the EEC limit have been recorded 
for some samples from older houses with Pb pipes, while a sample from a well supply in an old lead mining 
area contained three times the EEC limit. Despite the wide use of Cu piping for water supplies in the area, most 
values for this element in mains-water are low, with occasional higher values. However, many private supplies 
from spring sources are extremely Cu-rich and again levels of this element in a private supply showed a marked 
temporal variation during November 1989. Zinc levels in potable waters of the area are very variable. That most 
of the Zn in potable waters is derived from the dissolution of Cu pipes is evidenced by a strong correlation 
between Cu and Zn in these waters. A few Cd values of over 2 gg U-1 have also been recorded. 
Introduction 
In recent years there has been growing concern over the 
possible link between dietary aluminium and Alzheimer's 
disease in humans. Allied to this, there is considerable 
debate on the possible implications of elevated Al levels in 
drinking water. While several workers have indicated that 
water as a dietary source of Al is of little concern (Epstein, 
1988; 1990), other workers suggest that it may pose a 
problem (Craun, 1990). Studies of the geographical 
distribution of Alzheimer's disease in Norway have 
revealed a suggested relationship between Al in drinking 
water and the disease (Flaten, 1988,1990; Vogt, 1988). 
While the Norwegian studies attribute the higher Al levels 
in drinking water to acid rain, a major source of the element 
in many European supplies is the A12(SO4)3 used as a 
coagulant in water treatment (Simpson et al., 1988). 
In this paper we will demonstrate that Al levels in 
surface runoff can vary over a limited geographical area as 
a function of substrate and stream profile and, further, that 
the use of A12(SO4)3 in water treatment can contribute 
significant amounts of Al to the water supply. In addition, 
the area studied has a long history of metalliferous mining 
and abandoned Pb, Zn and Cu mines and spoil heaps litter 
the area. During this study, an attempt was made to identify 
any contribution of metals to drinking water from these 
sources together with any metal contamination resulting 
from the dissolution of metal pipes and fittings. 
Area of Study 
The area studied during this work is shown in Figure 1. 
North Ceredigion lies on the west coast of the British Isles 
and consists of a dissected coastal region where the land 
rises to around 200 m with upland to the East. The highest 
point in the area is the Plynlimon range which rises to 
752 m. This area was subjected to glaciation during the 
Pleistocene as a result of which there was over deepening 
of the Rheidol river valley. This area of mid-Wales is 
underlain by lower Palaeozoic clastic sediments which are 
carbonate poor and much of the upland is covered by peat bogs. Both of these are important factors influencing the 
chemistry of surface water in this region. Another factor is 
the long history of Pb, Zn and Cu mining in this area, as 
many of the old mines and spoil contribute significant 
contamination to the surface waters (Fuge et at., 1991). 
Water for public consumption is collected in a 
number of small upland reservoirs; Llyn Llygad Rheidol 
and Llyn Craigypistyll in the north and Llyn Egnant and Llyn Teifi (collectively known as the Teifi pools) in the 
south (Figure 1). The water, in these reservoirs, typically 
has a brown colouration due to the high levels of 
organic/humic material and it is the removal of this 
colouration which leads to some of the problems in this 
area. In addition to the upland supplies, water for the town 
of Aberystwyth is supplemented by a borehole into the 
river gravels of the over deepened Rheidol valley at Lovesgrove (see Figure 1).

Abstract-Wales, with its long history of metalliferous mining, has many abandonded mines and ore-rich 
spoil tips, several of which are very extensive. Most of the ore minerals are sulphides, Zn occurring as 
sphalerite in Oieh Cd is ubiquitous. Soils in the vicinity of the tips contain up to I((X) ppm Cd. Analyses of 
the ZnS reveal Cd values up to 0.52% with Zn/Cd ratios ranging from 120 to 665, mean 31)6. Fine spoil 
from the area contains up to l(150 ppnt Cd, the mean Zn/Cd ratio of the most metal-rich samples being 75. 
Surface samples of tip contain high levels of water-soluble Cd but Zn/Cd ratios are much higher than those 
for the whole tip material. suggesting that Zn is preferentially leached out. 
Adit and spoil drainage waters have Cd levels up to 2.5 mg/I white ground waters from the tips contain 
up to 2.7 mg/t. The Zn/Cd ratios of these waters are very variable ranging from -20 to > l0UU. The Zn/Cd 
ratio in the ground waters is generally ' 100, while surface and alit drainage waters are mostly in the range 
I0I-250. The differing ratios in surface and subsurface waters probably rellect variable Eh and p11 
conditions. In addition, it has been found that alit and tip waters which are rich in Fe and tend to 
precipitate ochre have relatively high ZiVCd ratios, t)pieally betvccn 30U and 01, while the ochreous 
precipitates have ratios between 140 and M. It is suggested that the Cd content of these waters is 
controlled by oxidation with consequent precipitation of Fe which scavenges Cd. The Cd content of tip 
drainage waters shows marked seasonal variation with highest values recorded in winter and after summer 
droughts. However, the Zn/Cd ratio of individual streams shows remarkable temporal constancy. 
INTRODUCTION 
CADMIUM ALONG with Zn and Ilg is a member of 
group 118 of the PeriodicTable. The general chemis- 
try of Cd is very like that of Zn, both having vcry 
similar electronic structures, electronegativities and 
ionisation energies (Table 1). Not surprisingly, then, 
the geochemistrics of Cd and Zn are very closely 
linked (LEVINSON, 1950; KABATA-PLNDIAs and PLN- 
DIAS, 1984). In general terms the abundance of Cd in 
crustal rocks is low with only carbonaceous shales 
and phosphorites showing any marked enrichments 
(Table 2); Cd is the 63rd element in order of crustal 
abundance (GREENWOOD and L'ARNSIIAW, 19; 34). 
Cadmium, like Zn, is a chalcophile element but 
GOLDSCUMIDT (1954) suggested that Cd is more so 
than is Zn. Cadmium forms the sulphide grcenockitc 
(CdS), but its main occurrence in a sulphide phase is 
within sphaleritc (ZnS) where it commonly occurs in 
the range (1.1-(1.5% (WAKrrA and Sctmlrr, 197(1) but 
ranges up to 4.4'% (LEVINSON, 198(1). According to 
LEVINSON (198(1) the levels of Cd in sphalerite within 
individual deposits appear to be temperature de- 
pendent, the highest levels being found in the lowest 
temperature zones of the deposit, l Iowever, IVANOV 
(19(x1) suggested that, in addition to temperature, the 
type of deposit controls the Zn/Cd ratio of sphalerite. 
KAUATA-l'LNDIAS and PCNDIAS (1984) quoted the 
background range of Cd in soils as 0.07-1.1 ppm and 
suggested that levels >0.5 ppm reflect antlu"opogenic 
input. ALI. uwAY (1990) suggested that uneumtcuni- 
nated soils should contain <1 ppnt Cd except where 
they are derived from black shales where elevated 
levels would be expected. Several potential contami- 
nant sources of Cd in soils are listed by ALI. o\vAY 
(1190) including the application of phosphate ferti- 
lisers and sewage sludges; he also listed the effects of 
present and past Zn and Pb mining and processing as 
a serious source of soil Cd pollution. 
There is little data on Cd in the aquatic environ. 
ment but levels are generally <1 /g/1 (MARTIN and 
WInir Lt. u. 1953; CIUSTER, 1990); where levels tire 
markedly above this an unthrupogenic source is gen- 
erally indicated. 
Wales has a long history of metalliferous mining 
stretching us far back as the Bronze age. The most 
extensively mined metals were Pb, Zn and Cu, but 
Au, Ag, Ba, Mn and Fc have also been extracted. 
While only limited metal extraction has occurred 
over the last half century, Wales was a major ore 
producer between the l7th and early 20th centuries. 
As a result many abandoned mines with their atten. 
dint spoil tips litter the old ore-fields and are a 
continuing source of environmental heavy metal Con- 
tamination (Fig. 1). Most of the mine workings 
occurred on steep river valley sides and on the valley 
floors, and as a result water courses, stream sedi- 
ments and alluvial plains hays been and continue to 
be contaminated with metals. The chief Zn- 
contaminated mineral in the Welsh ore-fields is spha- 
lerite and this provides a major source of Cd pollution 
in the Principality. 
The prewnt study sought to outline the behaviour 
Ofcont, uninant Cd from the mine sites in the second- 
ary environment. To do this soils in the vicinity of the 
mines and waters draining the sites were analysed.

Sphalerite samples from the mid Wales ore field were 
also analysed and in the case of the Fan site (Fig. 1), 
the extensive tailings and other fine spoil were ana- 
lysed. This mine, in common with many others in 
Wales, was essentially worked as a Pb mine and Zn 
ore was treated as a waste product, consequently the 
tips are very rich in Zn and Cd. 
METHODOLOGY 
\\later samplc> were collected in acid-washed polypropy- 
lene bottles and stored in the refrigerator until analysed, 
analyses always being carried out within 4S It of collection. 
Initially duplicate samples were collected with one sample 
being stored as outlined and the other being filtered through 
a 0.45pm filter and acidified with HNO. i. Analytical results 
revealed data for filtered and unfiltered samples to he 
identical, within analytical error (PEARCr.., 1991). Sub- 
sequently. samples were not prepared prior to analysis. 
Soil samples were collected by screw auger or trowel to a 
depth of 15 cm by sampling around concentric circles of 
1-2 m diameter. Spoil tip material was collected from 
surface samples using a trowel and also from pits dug to a 
depth of up to I in. Suitable sphalerite samples were 
collected from the spoil tips. 
After drying, disaggregation and sieving through a2 nim 
mesh, the samples of soil and spoil were evaporated to 
dryness with a 4: 1 mixture of HNO3 and HCIO4 and 
soluhilised material was taken up in 10"'o IINO. j. The 
sphalerite samples were crushed in a tungsten carbide ball 
mill and were then treated in the same way as the spoil 
samples. Analyses were performed by atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry and by inductively coupled plasma-mass 
spectrometry. 
RESUI: I'S AND DISCUSSION 
Soils 
Much data has been published on Cd levels in 
Welsh soils (Table 3). PAVELEY (1998) showed that 
the background Cd values for Welsh soils range up to 
2.0 ppm with a geometric mean of 0.32, and states 
that anomalously high values are generally due to 
previous metalliferous mining and processing. It is 
apparent from the data in Table 3 that many of the 
samples from the mineralized areas and the valleys 
draining them contain anomalously high Cd. Much of 
this contamination, particularly in the alluvial valley 
soils, was derived during extraction because much of 
the mining and milling was carried out during a 
period when little or no environmental restrictions 
were imposed. Finely ground ore and gangue were 
allowed to escape into rivers with the result that large 
areas of alluvial plains were contaminated, %%hich 
today provide a vast reservoir of potential heavy 
metal pollution (DAVIES and LENIN, 1974; FucE ei 
al., 1989). Present day contamination of soils is 
generally due to tine ore-rich tip material (Table 4) 
being blown and washed out into surrounding areas 
(DAVIES and WtnrE, 1981; JOHNSON rt al., 1978), 
resulting in some extremely high Cd values in the 
immediate vicinity of the tips (Table 3). 
While it is likely that appreciable Cd in the con- 
taminated soils is present in sphalcrite grains, the 
range of Zn/Cd ratios in some Welsh soils is markedly

Cd ncar abandoned mctallifcrous mines, Wulcs 
different from that generally found in sphaleritc 
(Table 4). DAVILS and ROBERTS (1978) suggested that 
the low Zn/Cd ratios (mean 120) of the soils from the 
NE Clwyd mining district reflect the high Cd content 
reported in sphalerites of that area (EL SHAZLY Ct GI., 
1957). However, it seems likely that the relatively 
low ratios in other areas of Wales are due to the 
release of Zn and Cd from sphalerite, with Cd more 
prone to be adsorbed by the soil. ALLOWAY (1990) 
discussed Cd adsorbtion in soils and suggested that is 
is greatest in low acid to slightly alkaline conditions. 
In addition, Cd has been described by GOLDSCI MIDI 
(1954) as being more chalcophile than Zn and there- 
fore survives as a sulphide when ZnS is being weath- 
ered out. Generally, in the present study, it was 
found that Cd was more concentrated in surface soils, 
but in some acidic soils (pH 3.8-1.5) it was concen- 
trated in the B horizon. 
Ore und spoil 
As stated previously the Cd content of sphalerite is 
commonly Mithin the range 0.1-). 3i, (WAKIm and 
SctlMttrr, 1970) nd data for sphalerites from the mid- 
Wales ore field show levels to he generally within this 
range (Table 4). The mean Zn/Cd ratio of these 
spltalerites is close to 300. The corresponding ratio 
for the Fan spoil tip material analysed is, however, 
much lower (92), while the most metal-rich samples 
(>0.5'%, Zn) have an average Zn/Cd ratio of only 75, 
lo, Acr than any ratio for sphalerite recorded in this 
study. Only two sphalerite samples from the spoil 
were analysed and these gave ratios of 450 and 310, 
respectively, which suggests that the Cd content, of 
the Fan ore is similar to that found in the rest of the

mid-Wales ore field. The relatively high levels of Cd 
in the tip material are, therefore, somewhat surpris- 
ing. Most of the spoil samples analysed are from the 
surface or near surface of the tip and this could be a 
contributory factor to the low Zn/Cd ratio. The tip 
area in question is entirely composed of fine waste 
left after mineral processing. During periods of dry 
weather this tip complex develops a white coating, 
described by JOHNSON ei al. (1978) as crystalline zinc 
sulphate. Analysis of this material showed it to con- 
tain 35% Zn and 0.1% Cd in a water-soluble form. 
Indeed, in the immediate surface layer of the tip most 
of the Zn appears to be in a water-soluble form, while 
<40% of the total Cd is water soluble (Table 4). This 
suggests that the ZnS is being preferentially weath- 
ered to the very soluble sulphate, while CdS is being 
weathered to a lesser extent, which is in accordance 
with the observation by GOLDSCHMIDT (1954) that Cd 
is more chalcophile than Zn. The same author com- 
ments that greenockite tends to form a coating on 
sphalcrite during weathering. In this context spacial 
analyses were carried out, using laser ablation induc- 
tively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, of a spha- 
lerite sample from the tip. This reveals that while the 
Zn/Cd ratio (440-520) is fairly constant in the 
unweathered main mass of the sample, the ratio 
drops markedly to 320 in the outer regions, %%hile on 
the surface the ratio was 230. The Fan mine began to 
produce ore in 1866 and production peaked between 
157( and 1580, the mine being abandoned in 1921 
(NloRRISON, 1971). Thus the very fine tip material, 
still totally non-vegetated, has been exposed to 
weathering for >70 a. It is likely, then, that during 
this time Zn has been preferentially weathered out 
leaving the surface area enriched in Cd. In this 
context it was also found that sphalcrite contains 
small amounts of water-leachable Zn and Cd. 
Waters 
AnDULLAII and RUYLE (1972) and FUGE er rel. 
(1991) showed that rivers draining mineralised areas 
of Wales contain elevated levels of Cd. A back- 
ground level of 0.41 j g/l for uncontaminated river 
waters from the region was proposed by AUDULLAII 
and RoY t. E (1972). All of the samples analysed in the 
present study exceed this value. 
Data have been collected for many mineralised 
sites in Wales (Fig. 1) with Cd and Zn levels in tip 
runoff being determined at monthly intervals for 
several of than. The data for two Pb/Zn mines are 
shown in Fig. 2; one, Llangynog, in the Berwyn 
Dome is in an area of lower Palaeozoic clastic sedi- 
mentary and volcanic rocks; the other in N. C. Clwyd 
is hosted by Carboniferous Limestone. Data from a 
Au mine, Gwynfynedd, in the Harlech Dome are 
also presented in Fig. 2. The data for Cd and Zn from 
samples collected on a monthly basis showed very 
constant Zn/Cil ratios over time. the levels being of

Cd and Zn concentration during winter, which seem 
to he related to greater flushing effects. Summer 
highs follow periods of dry weather with resultant ore 
mineral oxidation and subsequent washout. These 
observations are in line with those found for Zn by 
GttUMSIIAW et a. (1976) for the Yswyth River in mid 
Wales. 
The constancy of the Zn/Cd ratio would not be 
expected in view of the relatively high content of 
soluble Zn found in the surface of the Fan tips; it 
might be anticipated that the ratio would vary 
greatly, particularly after periods of drought when

much Zn would he expected to he solubilised. While 
data for Fan covering the same period of time are not 
available, data collected on a regular basis from 
February to July, 1991 show that the main drainage 
stream at this site exhibits a narrow range of ratios, 
111-153. Similarly, the ratios in surface tip and adit 
drainage at this mine seem to be fairly constant 
through time. 
The lower than expected Zn/Cd ratio of the surface 
drainage may reflect the sampling scheme. GtaMt- 
sttAw et ill. (1976) found that during storm events 
following drought, the initial runoff causes a flushing 
effect of just a few hours duration, followed by a 
dilution effect. Therefore, the flushing of the more 
soluble Zn could occur during the initial stages of the

rainfall when there would also be a high Zn/Cd ratio 
which would subsequently drop fairly rapidly. Thus 
to observe any large Zn flush would require samples 
to be collected at short intervals during a rainfall 
event. 
While all surface and adit drainage waters analysed 
in the present study, including those from Fan, have 
Zn/Cd ratios > 100, samples of subsurface tip drain- 
age from Fan are relatively rich in Cd (Table 5) with 
an average ratio (77) similar to that found in the spoil. 
The subsurface waters are more acid than the surface 
waters and this may cause greater mobility of Cd. In 
addition, it is likely that in the fine-grained, sulphide- 
rich tip, Eh conditions are much less oxidizing than 
on the surface. The solubility of CdS is 1.3 mg/1,

double that of ZnS (0.65 mg/l; WEAST, 1981-1982), 
and it is possible that at least some of these metals 
may be in sulphide form in solution. So it appears that 
the solution chemistry of Cd in the subsurface waters 
may reflect control by Eh and pH. 
Another feature of Cd chemistry in mine and spoil 
drainage is demonstrated in Table 6. In waters from 
mines and spoil where ochre is precipitating, the Cd 
levels are much lower than in non-ochreous waters 
with Zn/Cd ratios up to 760. The ochre precipitates 
found in these streams have Zn/Cd ratios that are 
much lower than those in the waters, ranging from 
130 to 250; it seems likely that the Cd levels of these 
waters are controlled by the precipitation of the 
ochre. While many of the ochre-precipitating streams

are very acid, with pH values as low as 2.7, some are 
only mildly acid and it is unlikely that pH is a 
controlling influence on the Cd content of these 
waters. It is probable that a relatively high Eh causes 
precipitation of the ochre and it is this which controls 
the Cd content of the waters. 
In the case of the Gwynfynedd Gold mine alit 
(Fig. 1), mining was carried out until comparatively 
recently. After cessation of this activity late in 1989, 
there appears to have been a build up of highly acid 
ochreous water in the blocked up mine. This resulted 
in highly contaminated water bursting from the mine 
during spring, 1990. Samples of this water were 
analysed soon after the burst occurred and monthly 
samples have been collected since this time (Table 7). 
The Cd content of these waters decreased by -i0% 
during the course of a year while Zn contents de- 
creased by --80% during the same period. The Zit/Cd 
ratio decreased markedly during this time from 
>1000 to -400. Two samples of ochre from this 
stream bed had Zn/Cd ratios of 160 and 140, respect- 
ively. It seems likely that the decreasing Zn/Cd ratio 
through time in this adit drainage is the result of the 
initial precipitation of a large amount of ochre when 
the very Fe-rich waters were released, with the 
amount subsequently declining with time. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. Sphalerite in old mine tips is a major source of 
environmental contamination in Wales. Soils in the 
vicinity of these tips are heavily polluted by wind and 
water-bourne ore material. 
2. Because Cd is more chalcophile than Zn it tends 
to persist as a sulphide while ZnS is weathering to the 
very soluble sulphate. This results in 
Cd being con- 
centrated in the outer regions of weathered sphaler- 
itc fragments and similarly leads to Cd being enriched 
relative to Zn in tine-grained tip material. In soils the 
greater chalcophile nature of Cd could, in part, 
explain its relative immobility in surface soils con- 
taminated by Zn mine waste. 
3. Despite its chalcophile nature, some Cd is re- 
lcascd from sphalerite on weathering, probably as 
CdSO4. Thus surface tip and adit drainage is rich in 
Cd, with Zn/Cd ratios generally much higher than 
those found in the spoil. Surface tip run tiff shows a

marked temporal constancy of Zn/Cd ratios for indi- 
vidual sites. 
4. Subsurface drainage from fine-grained tip 
material has a markedly lower Zn/Cd ratio than 
surface and adit drainage in the area, due probably to 
increased acidity and decreased Eh. In these waters 
the greater solubility of CdS is likely to be an import- 
ant factor. 
S. Eh appears also to be controlling the Cd content 
of ochre-precipitating adit and tip drainage waters. 
Iligher Eh results in the precipitation of Fe with 
consequent scavenging of Cd.
