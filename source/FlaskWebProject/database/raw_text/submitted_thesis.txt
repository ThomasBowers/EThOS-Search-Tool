Abstract
Fertilisers are used to provide crop plants with essential nutrients such as nitrogen
but with a high energy cost and detrimental environmental effects. The symbiosis of
legumes with rhizobia exhibits none of these problems since the bacteria provide fixed
nitrogen directly to the plant. Further understanding of the initiation of symbiosis
may enable improvements to the farming of crop legumes and enable the same
processes to be mimicked in engineered systems of other crops. Although motility
and chemotaxis are known to be crucial for competitive plant root colonisation
(the first stage of symbiosis), little is known about their importance after this
stage. In this thesis, I aimed to describe the importance of chemotaxis and motility
in sequential stages of symbiosis up to the generation of root nodules filled with
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. To this end, the chemotaxis and motility systems of
the model rhizobia Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) were
characterised, in both free-living and plant-associated states.
Rlv3841 motility is driven by flagella rotation modulated by two chemotaxis
systems, Che1 and Che2, that respond to signals sensed by chemoreceptors. In
this work we found that Rlv3841 has a diverse set of chemoreceptors that enable
the bacteria to sense and respond to a variety of chemical gradients, by both
externally sensing in the periplasm and internally sensing metabolic state. We also
found a novel system that halts the bacteria in response to high concentrations
of TCA cycle intermediates independent of the chemotaxis systems. An inorganic
phosphate uptake system (PstSCAB) and a putative methyltransferase (encoded
by RL3464) were found to be critical to the response, although their downstream
effectors were not identified. Finally, we characterised the importance of the
chemotaxis and flagella systems of Rlv3841 at sequential stages of the symbiosis.
This involved marking bacteria with luminescence, fluorescence and enzymatic
activity and assaying the bacteria by optical imaging, flow cytometry and staining.
We found that there are several critical stages in which chemotaxis and motility are
essential and that these occur after the plant root has been colonised by the rhizobia.
In particular, we found that Che1 and flagella are important for movement around
the root and to root hair tips and that Che2 is involved in infection thread formation
and bacteroid differentiation. Overall, this work improves our understanding of
the chemotaxis and motility systems of Rlv3841 and their importance across the
whole Rhizobium-legume symbiosis cycle.

Introduction
1.1 Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth and reproduction, indeed for all
life. Plants typically get nitrogen from ammonium and nitrate in the soil, which
are in turn sourced from decaying organic matter or nitrogen fixation (Jackson,
Schimel and Firestone 1989). Sourcing nitrogen becomes a problem in a crop
context: even small, diversely planted farms drain the nitrogen from the soil, let
alone the fast-growing, nutrient-exhausting monocultures of the contemporary farm.
The modern solution is to apply fertilisers to replenish the nitrogen. However, most
fertiliser nitrogen does not reach the crop plants, instead leaching into surrounding
water-systems and causing eutrophication and other environmental problems (Cheng
2008; Schlesinger 2009; Smil 2011). In addition, nitrogen fertiliser is energetically
expensive, accounting for 1% of the worlds energy supply and requiring 6 times as
much energy as phosphorous or potassium fertilisers (Santi, Bogusz and Franche
2013; Oldroyd and Dixon 2014; Dent and Cocking 2017).
An ancient solutioncrop rotationhas none of the above problems. The
reinvigoration of the soil by the planting of leguminous plants, was noted as early
as Theophrastus (370-285 B.C.) (Theophrastus and Hort 2015). We now know that
legume plants reinvigorate the soil by the addition of fixed nitrogen obtained through
2 1.2. Rhizobium-legume symbiosis
symbiosis with a group of bacteria called rhizobia. Rhizobia can fix atmospheric
nitrogen and perform this task in return for carbon and a safe niche within the
legume. Despite atmospheric nitrogen being an almost unlimited resource (78% of
the atmosphere is dinitrogen gas), this fixation process is unique to microbes and is
known as Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF). BNF accounts for an estimated 40-
50% of nitrogen in the biosphere (Schlesinger 2009; Terpolilli, Hood and Poole 2012).
Although the symbiosis allows legumes to survive in low-nitrogen conditions and
provides a competitive advantage in highly biodiverse environments, it is not found
in non-legume crops (Oldroyd et al. 2011; Geddes et al. 2015). Efforts have therefore
been made to engineer cereal crops with BNF, either through developing bacterial
symbioses or transferring the fixation machinery to plant organelles (Geddes et
al. 2015). This thesis aims to further our understanding of the initiation of the
Rhizobium-legume symbiosis to allow mimicry in engineered systems.
1.2 Rhizobium-legume symbiosis
1.2.1 Soil and the rhizosphere
Soil is a highly competitive environment for microbial life, with as many as 104
bacterial species and 109 bacterial cells per gram (Poole, Ramachandran and
Terpolilli 2018). The soil surrounding plant roots, the rhizosphere, has even higher
levels of colonisation. The rhizosphere microbes compete for the 20% of plant
photosynthate that is exuded into the soil and, in return, the microbes can increase
micro- and macro-nutrient availability (Brencic and Winans 2005; Richardson et
al. 2009). It is from these colonised microbes that legumes select endophytic
symbionts to begin the symbiosis cycle (Figure 1.1). To fulfil this function, the
symbiotic rhizobia must have two distinct traits: they must be independently
competitive colonisers as free-living cells in the soil and they must be efficient
nitrogen fixers as symbiotic cells, called bacteroids, inside the plant. Since these
roles have very different objectives, rhizobia tend to have different metabolic modes
and regulatory pathways, first as free-living status in the soil and, secondly, as
1. Introduction 3
Figure 1.1: Rhizobium-legume symbiosis cycle. Rhizobia are initially living in
the soil (free-living), they then move towards the plant root surface through chemotaxis
(attraction), where they colonise (colonisation). After reaching the root hair tips, the
rhizobia engage in a molecular dialogue with the plant (communication) which, if successful,
enables their entrance into the root hair (entry). The plant responds to bacterial entry
by forming infection threads that grow and ramify into plant cortical cells. Bacteria
move down the infection threads and are eventually endocytosed by plant cells where
they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids (nodulation). Eventually, the nodule
undergoes senescence, releasing the undifferentiated nodule bacteria back into the soil
(release).
bacteroids within the plant. This differentiation occurs through the complex process
by which symbiosis is initiated.
1.2.2 Colonisation of root surface and root hairs
The symbiosis is first established by the migration of rhizobia through the soil
towards the host plant roots. This movement is controlled by chemotaxis and appears
to be host-agnostic, driving movement to all plant exudates tested (Gaworzewska
and Carlile 1982). The process also drives higher colonisation in areas of high
exudation, such as branching points and new growth (Brencic and Winans 2005).
After arriving at the root, the initial stage of attachment is characterised by non-
specific, reversible binding of bacterial surface polysaccharides by plant lectins
(Rodriguez-Navarro, Dardanelli and Ruiz-Sainz 2007; Berne et al. 2015; Wheatley
4 1.2. Rhizobium-legume symbiosis
Figure 1.2: Symbiotic infection process. The plant root releases flavonoids which
induce the production of nodulation factors (Nod factor) in symbiotic rhizobia. This
leads to curling of the root hair to trap attached rhizobia and the formation of the
infection thread tube. The bacteria then fill the infection thread by growth and division.
Finally, after the rhizobia reach the inner cortex cells, they enter inside the plant cells
and differentiate into bacteroids to begin fixing nitrogen. These plant cells expand and
replicate to form the nodule. Reproduced from Oldroyd (2013).
and Poole 2018). Some degree of specificity comes with the interactions in the
second stage of attachment, with the bacteria producing cellulose fibrils for strong,
irreversible binding as a biofilm (Rodriguez-Navarro, Dardanelli and Ruiz-Sainz
2007; Wheatley and Poole 2018). The main source of host-specificity comes from the
interactions in late colonisation, at root hair caps of bacterial biofilms (Gage 2004;
Downie 2010). Here, the legume produces flavonoids that induce the production of
signalling molecules (Nod factors) by the symbiotic bacteria (Figure 1.2) (Fisher
and Long 1992; Oldroyd 2013; Poole, Ramachandran and Terpolilli 2018). It is this
molecular dialogue that induces the later stages of the symbiosis.
1.2.3 Entering the plant via infection threads
The later stages of symbiosis occur deep within the plant root, so the bacteria
must first enter inside. The production of Nod factors mentioned above induces
the plant root hairs to curl around the rhizobial biofilm, trapping the bacteria and
forcing them inside the root (Figure 1.2) (Prell and Poole 2006; Oldroyd and Downie
2008). Once inside, the Nod factors have the additional effect of dampening the
plant immune defences to allow the bacteria to survive within the root (Zipfel and
Oldroyd 2017). The rhizobia then progress further into the plant root via structures
called infection threads, tubular extrusions formed by invagination of plant cell
1. Introduction 5
walls that provide an avenue through each plant cell (Prell and Poole 2006; Jones
et al. 2007). The bacteria movement through the infection threads is mainly due to
continual growth and division, filling the available space (Gage 2004). However, the
filling of the infection threads is not continuous, with bacteria reaching the tip of
the thread before the tube is filled (Fournier et al. 2008). This suggests that some
other form of motility is involved, although the form that this takes is currently
unknown. The infection threads become more highly branched as they progress
deeper into the root, eventually reaching inner cortical cells that have been prepared
by the plant to receive the rhizobia (Monahan-Giovanelli, Pinedo and Gage 2006).
1.2.4 The symbiotic core: the nodule
In response to the rhizobial infection, the plant expands inner root cells to contain
the symbionts within budded membranes called symbiosomes (Poole, Ramachandran
and Terpolilli 2018). The expansion collectively forms bulbous growths on the root,
called nodules. Within these nodules, the bacteria differentiate into bacteroids
bacteria metabolically transformed to perform high levels of nitrogen-fixation. The
bacteroid differentiation occurs following two different strategies according to the
host plant. In determinate nodules (typical of tropical legumes, such as beans), the
bacteroids have increased levels of nitrogen fixation machinery, but remain similar
in size and viability (Mergaert et al. 2006). In indeterminate nodules (typical of
temperate legumes, such as peas), the bacteroids change more drastically, leading
to a terminal differentiation by modifying their cell walls to grow much larger
and branched and becoming unable to divide (Mergaert et al. 2006; Prell et al.
2009). In addition, indeterminate nodules have a meristem with undifferentiated
bacterial cells that continues to grow and produce more plant cells to renew the
same rhizobial infection. In both cases, the nodule forms a extremely low-oxygen
environment, using high levels of leghaemoglobin to bind free oxygen and prevent it
from inactivating the nitrogenase (Haag et al. 2013). This enables the bacteroids to
continually produce ammonium by nitrogen fixation, being supplied with nutrients
from the plant (Prell and Poole 2006; Oldroyd et al. 2011). At the completion
6 1.3. Importance of chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis
of the symbiosis, the bacteria are released back into the rhizosphere, with the
clonal growth in the infection threads providing a substantial population boost
(Oldroyd and Downie 2008).
Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) is an -proteobacteria
that is a well-established model for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, nodulating a number
of legume species, particularly pea (Pisum sativum), vetches (various Vicia), broad
bean (Vicia faba), lentils (various Lens), grass peas and sweet peas (various Lathyrus)
(Johnston and Beringer 1975; Poole et al. 1994). This bacterium is the reference
strain in our laboratory and will constitute the focus of this research project.
1.3 Importance of chemotaxis and motility in
symbiosis
Motility and chemotaxis are key processes in the establishment of a successful
symbiosis. Indeed, most symbionts of eukaryotes have flagellar and chemotaxis
capabilities (Raina et al. 2019). Both are also needed for competitive nodulation
(Catlow, Glenn and Dilworth 1990; Yost, Rochepeau and Hynes 1998; Miller et al.
2007), and plant root surface colonization (Scharf, Hynes and Alexandre 2016). In
the first stage of competition as free-living cells in the soil, motility and chemotaxis
are critical due to the highly heterogeneous nature of this environment. The
heterogeneity is due to point sources of nutrients exuded from eukaryotes and is
stabilised by low levels of soil mixing. In such environments a more motile bacteria
can outgrow a metabolically superior species (Lauffenburger, Aris and Keller 1982).
Motility and chemotaxis are also crucial in the second stage, root surface colo-
nization. A bacterium can achieve a growth advantage by arriving and establishing
itself at the root surface before a competitive environment has formed. In addition,
flagella-based swarming motility enables movement along the surface of the root for
more effective colonisation (Simons et al. 1996; Gao et al. 2016). Indeed, motility
and chemotaxis mutants of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis display greatly
reduced colonisation on Arabidopsis thaliana roots after 4 hours and on tomato
roots after 2 weeks (Allard-massicotte et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2016). In Rhizobium
1. Introduction 7
leguminosarum biovar viciae VF39SM, deletion of the chemotaxis receptors mcpB or
mcpC resulted in a significant reduction of nodulation competitiveness of pea plants,
although the ability to nodulate was not affected (Yost, Rochepeau and Hynes 1998).
Importantly, VF39SM mcpC mutants do not have a competitiveness disadvantage
in symbiosis with other plants, indicating the plant specificity of chemotaxis (Scharf,
Hynes and Alexandre 2016). In the case of Sinorhizobium meliloti, a symbiont
that nodulates alfalfa (Medicago sativa), several chemoreceptors have been found
to target specific compounds in the host seed exudates (Webb, Helm and Scharf
2016; Webb et al. 2017a, 2017b). Once inside the plant root, S. meliloti motility
genes still appear to be expressed in the infection thread channel but are completely
down-regulated in the nodules (Yost 1998). Interestingly, in other eukaryote-microbe
symbioses, similar channels are generated to select for and guide their symbionts,
via chemotaxis to generated gradients, to the symbiosis space (e.g. the slime cavities
of Hornwort and the ducts of the bobtail squid) (Raina et al. 2019). However,
once inside the nodule, motility and chemotaxis are unnecessary for the now sessile
bacteroids. This is also observed in Rlv3841, with down-regulation of chemoreceptors
during bacteroid differentiation to undetectable amounts in bacteroids (Yost et al.
2004; Karunakaran et al. 2009; Tambalo et al. 2010b). This regulation appears
unrelated to the low oxygen conditions and organic acid availability inside the
nodule (Yost et al. 2004; Tambalo et al. 2010b; Scharf, Hynes and Alexandre 2016).
The importance of chemotaxis to rhizobia is also revealed by the count of
chemoreceptor genes. Analysis of 264 completed bacterial genomes gave an average
chemoreceptor gene count of 14, which was found to be increased in species with
high metabolic diversity, low stability of habitat and those with interactions with
other living species (Lacal et al. 2010b). The category with the highest number
of chemoreceptors included several plant-interacting bacteria, including Rhizobium
leguminosarum, Rlv3841 having 27 candidate genes, almost double the average count.
In contrast, Escherichia coli, a human gut microbe, has only 5 chemoreceptor genes.
8 1.4. Motility in Gram-negative bacteria
1.3.1 Screening for gene significance in symbiosis
Insertion sequencing (INSeq) is a genome-wide screening technique able to identify
the relative importance of genes and intergenic regions in a given bacterial growth
condition (Perry and Yost 2014; Perry, Akter and Yost 2016). A mariner-based
transposon vector is used to generate a library of bacterial mutants, each with a single
transposon insertion site. This library is then passed through various environmental
conditions, sequencing the strains that survive. The relative abundance of a mutant
with a particular transposon insertion before and after the screen provides the
relative fitness of the mutant with that particular region disrupted.
In a laboratory collaborative project, we applied this technique to the various
stages in Rlv3841 symbiosis with pea plant (Wheatley et al. 2020). The chemotaxis
and motility genes formed two interesting patterns. Strains that had insertions
disrupting che1 cluster and flagellar genes had reduced fitness in nodules but not
in the rhizosphere or root surface environments. The lack of importance in the
rhizosphere and root surface is probably due to the experimental conditions flooding
the environments with a large number of cells. There is thus another required
stage after root colonisationeither movement to root hair tips or down infection
threads. Whereas those with insertions disrupting che2 cluster genes had increased
fitness in undifferentiated cells recovered from nodules, but not for bacteroids.
This may be due to either an increase in the number of cells reaching the nodule
(meaning che2 genes disrupt this process) or a reduction in the number of cells
differentiating into bacteroids (meaning che2 genes are involved in this process).
Further interpretations of these results are discussed in Chapter 5.
1.4 Motility in Gram-negative bacteria
There are several strategies bacteria use to navigate their environment. The fastest
movement in liquid media is swimming via flagella (Bernabu-Roda et al. 2015).
Flagella are rigid helical structures, anchored to the cell wall and rotated by a
protein motor to produce thrust (Macnab and Aizawa 1984). Among Gram-negative
1. Introduction 9
bacteria, Escherichia coli is the best understood model of flagella-based swimming.
Also belonging to this group, S. meliloti constitutes a very well-studied example
in the case of nitrogen-symbiotic bacteria.
1.4.1 The Escherichia coli motility model
E. coli have many flagella that protrude from various points around the cell body
(i.e. peritrichous flagellation) but are aimed in the same direction to form an
integrated bundle. Each flagellum consists of a basal body, hook and filament. The
basal body is made up of a central hollow rod surrounded by anchoring stacks of
rings (Wang et al. 2012). At the base of the basal body is the motor, where torque
is produced via the proton-motive force (Armitage and Schmitt 1997; Kojima and
Blair 2001). This motor is further subdivided into the rotor, the proteins that rotate
with the flagella, and the stator, the proteins that drive that rotation. The second
structure, the hook, is a highly curved helix, a flexible coupling that connects the
central rod to the filament. The filament is a left-handed helix consisting of a single
protein, flagellin. When rotated in a counter clockwise (CCW) manner, the flagella
provide a powerful forward thrust (Figure 1.3). However, if the rotary direction is
flipped to a clockwise (CW) direction, a polymorphic change is induced that causes
a right-angled bend in the filament to propagate along the flagella. This compels
the bundle of flagella to separate, causing a period of rotational movement due
to the low impact of inertia at microbial scales. This process is called a tumble
and allows bacteria to change their direction of movement (Figure 1.3) (Macnab
and Aizawa 1984; Armitage and Schmitt 1997; Berg 2003; Stock, Namba and Lee
2012; Wang et al. 2012). The run and tumble mechanism produces movement
called a biased random walk, the rate of tumbles being random but biased by the
chemotaxis system, as described below (Section 1.5).
1.4.2 The Sinorhizobium meliloti motility model
Sinorhizobium meliloti is another well-studied Gram-negative swimming bacteria.
Although its flagella are built in a similar fashion to those in E. coli and in similar
10 1.4. Motility in Gram-negative bacteria
Figure 1.3: Escherichia coli motility model. In E. coli, there is an equilibrium
between flagella anticlockwise and clockwise rotation modes. In anticlockwise mode, the
bacteria swims straight and the motor turns freely. In clockwise rotation, the bacteria
stalls and changes bearing. This mode is induced by binding of phosphorylated CheY to
the switch complex. Reproduced from Porter, Wadhams and Armitage (2011).
numbers, there are several important differences. The main difference is the shape
of the filament; S. melilotis filament is formed by right-handed helices and as such
forward thrust is produced by CW rotation (Armitage and Schmitt 1997; Sourjik
and Schmitt 1998). It also has increased rigidity, likely due to the use of several
distinct flagellin proteins. Half of the flagella mass consists of the FlaA protein
which forms heterodimers with three other proteins: FlaB, FlaC and FlaD (Scharf
et al. 2001). The rigid S. meliloti flagella may be adapted for use in the relatively
viscous medium of soil, compared to the native habitat of E. coli, the human gut
(Armitage and Schmitt 1997; Attmannspacher, Scharf and Schmitt 2005).
In addition, the structure is unable to switch the rotary direction of the motor,
instead modulating the speed of rotation. This is controlled through an extra stator
protein, MotC, that binds MotB in the periplasm and may thus regulate the speed
of the motor. An additional protein, MotE, acts to stabilize MotC and may target
the protein to the flagella motor (Eggenhofer, Haslbeck and Scharf 2004).
Despite being unable to cause a tumble in the same way as E. coli, S. meliloti
can still tumble. It does this by asynchronously modulating the rotational speed of
its flagella, causing its bundle of flagella to disassociate, causing a tumble (Armitage
and Schmitt 1997; Attmannspacher, Scharf and Schmitt 2005). The ability to
1. Introduction 11
modulate the speed of its flagella also enables the bacteria to increase cell velocity
in addition to reducing tumbling in response to high attractant concentration
(Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007).
1.4.3 The Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae motility
model
In the case of the target of this work, Rhizobium leguminosarum, there are still
many open questions. Motility in R. leguminosarum appears to be closely related to
that in S. meliloti, containing all the extra accessory genes (see Figure 1.4 and 1.5).
Indeed, the bacteria have been shown to use modulation in flagella rotational speed
to cause directional changes in addition to being unable to change the direction of
rotation (Miller et al. 2007). However, R. leguminosarum appear to only have 1-2
subpolar flagella with a smooth surface, lacking helical perturbations found in S.
meliloti (Tambalo et al. 2010a). The protein structure of the R. leguminosarum
filament is closely related to S. meliloti, again consisting of heterologous pairs of
a main flagellin (FlaA) and multiple secondary flagellin (FlaB, FlaC, FlaE and
FlaH) (Scharf et al. 2001; Tambalo et al. 2010a).
The mechanism that R. leguminosarum uses to change direction through
modulation of the rotary speed of a single or pair of flagella is currently unknown.
Despite this, this rhizobial species does appear to tumble, approximately every
3 seconds under homogeneous conditions while swimming at approximately 38
m/s (Miller et al. 2007). As with many other bacteria, the rate of these tumbles
is driven by the chemotaxis system.
In addition to flagella, Rlv3841 encodes a type IV pilus (Krehenbrink and
Downie 2008). The Rlv3841 pili cluster displays high homology to the tad systems
of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Caulobacter crescentus (See 1.6) (Tomich, Planet
and Figurski 2007; Clock et al. 2008; Imam et al. 2011). Pili drive twitching
motility across surfaces by extending, adhering and retracting to pull the bacterium
forward (Mattick 2002).

The basal body and type III secretion system are formed initially and provide the machinery

1.5 Chemotaxis in symbiotic bacteria
Chemotaxis involves regulating motility through variations in the concentration of
metabolically-relevant chemicals. The chemicals involved can be either attractants
(i.e. compounds which benefit the bacteria) or repellents (those compounds with
negative effects).
Bacterial size is insufficient to sense concentration gradients spatially at swim-
ming speeds so, instead, concentrations are compared temporally (Porter, Wadhams
and Armitage 2011). Bacteria bias their movements towards high concentrations
of attractants by reducing their tumbles and away from low concentrations of
attractants and high concentrations of repellents by increasing their tumbles.
As with motility, the chemotactic systems in R. leguminosarum appear to match
that of S. meliloti, having a similar array of genes. The main differences are the

14 1.5. Chemotaxis in symbiotic bacteria
presence of a duplicated set of chemotaxis genes and particularly in Rlv3841, several
additional chemoreceptors. In the following section, I will describe those elements
discovered in S. meliloti and those that have been confirmed in R. leguminosarum
(See Figure 1.4) (Sourjik and Schmitt 1998; Miller et al. 2007; Tambalo et al.
2010a, 2010b).
The main regulatory system in bacterial chemotaxis is a two-component system,
consisting of a histidine kinase (component one) that first receives the signal which
it then transmits to the response regulator (component two). In chemotaxis, the
histidine kinase is CheA, which phosphorylates the response regulator CheY (see
Figure 1.4). In S. meliloti, there are two copies of CheY, CheY2 propagating the
signal and CheY1 acting as a phosphate sink, increasing the rate at which CheY2
returns to its unphosphorylated state (Sourjik and Schmitt 1998). However, instead
of a positive signal causing phosphorylation of the response regulator, as in most
two-component systems, a negative signal to CheA increases its autophosphorylation,
leading to increased amounts of phosphorylated CheY2 (CheY2-P). This is due to
the activity of CheY2-P, which binds the motor protein FliM to induce reduction in
rotary speed, inducing a tumble (Sourjik and Schmitt 1998). Since tumbling reduces
the chance the bacteria will continue moving in its previous direction, CheY2 is
activated when that direction is unfavourable. This biases the bacterial random
walk, causing it to avoid environments that activate the phosphorylation cascade.
In addition to phosphorylation, CheY can also be acetylated. Binding of FliM
by CheY actually occurs in three stages: firstly, CheY binds to the FliMN site
causing CheY potentiation and allowing binding of CheY-P to the second site on
FliN causing brief CW episodes and allowing binding of CheY-Ac to the third
site FliMM for extended CW rotation (Fraiberg et al. 2015; Afanzar et al. 2021).
The acetylation-requiring stage appears to be another regulatory gate that controls
adaptation timing. CheY acetylation is enzymatically controlled, with acetylation
and deacetylation by acetyl-CoA synthetase and further deacetylation by the sirtuin
CobB and phosphate acetyltransferase (Baron, Afanzar and Eisenbach 2017; Baron

and Eisenbach 2017). Additionally, CheY can be autoacetylated from acetyl-CoA
or acetyl phosphate as regulatory links to central metabolism.
In addition to the CheY proteins, CheA can phosphorylate another chemotaxis
protein, CheB. Phosphorylated CheB demethylates chemoreceptors at an increased
rate, increasing their sensitivity by reducing their ability to induce CheA autophos-
phorylation (Rice and Dahlquist 1991; Armitage and Schmitt 1997; Porter, Wadhams
and Armitage 2011). If the cell experiences a persistent negative stimulus, the
ability of the appropriate chemoreceptors to induce tumbling is reduced, adjusting
their sensitivity to the lower concentration of the stimulus.
Another chemotaxis protein, CheR, methylates the chemoreceptors. This reverses
the adjustment of CheB and is always active (Rice and Dahlquist 1991; Armitage
and Schmitt 1997). Continued demethylation of a chemoreceptor by phosphorylated
CheB is required to keep the chemoreceptor in a hyper-sensitive state. So, if the cell
experiences a persistent positive stimulus, CheA has reduced autophosphorylation
leading to reduced CheB-P and increased methylation of chemoreceptors. This
adjusts the receptors to the new, higher concentration of effector.
Combinations of these simple systems form more complex emergent features.
These include accumulation (i.e. balance between two antagonistic receptors can al-
low cells to target specific optimal concentrations) and log sensing (signal adaptation
allows constant movement in an exponential gradient) (Colin and Sourjik 2017).
However, since different chemoreceptors bind different effectors, how does the
signal adaptation separate conflicting signals such as in an environment where
one receptor has a positive and another a negative signal? To answer this ques-
tion, we must first discuss chemoreceptor structures and how they are arranged.
Chemoreceptors (also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins or MCPs) are
most often transmembrane proteins with a substrate binding domain that projects
into the periplasm with transmembrane domains on either side. The cytoplasmic
section of the proteins consists of the section where methylation occurs, a signalling
region and a flexible bundle that bends to form a hairpin turn where the section
is repeated, inverted to form a U shape (See Figure 1.7) (Alexander and Zhulin
16 1.5. Chemotaxis in symbiotic bacteria
Figure 1.7: Typical chemoreceptor topology. The typical membrane bound
chemoreceptor has two transmembrane helices (TM) flanking a ligand binding domain
(LBD), such that the LBD senses in the periplasm. The sensing signal is transmitted via
a HAMP domain (histidine kinase, adenyl cyclase, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein
and phosphatase region) to the signalling subdomain (SSD), where the main chemotaxis
machinery binds. The sensitivity of the receptor is modified by methylation and amidation
of the methylation helices (MH). Additional domains including control cable (CC), phase
stutter (PS) and flexible bundle (FB) act to preserve the structure. Reproduced from
Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova (2017).
2007; Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007; Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova 2017).
Additionally, the carboxy-terminus of the protein often consists of a pentapeptide
NWETF motif (present in 4 out of the 8 MCPs in S. meliloti and 9 out of the 25
MCPs in Rlv3841), which provides a binding platform for CheR and CheB (Wu
et al. 1996; Yost et al. 2004; Zatakia et al. 2017). The chemoreceptors are then
clustered at the cell poles as trimers of dimers. This arrangement is stabilised by
the binding of CheA via the structural protein CheW to form hexagonal arrays
of receptors on the inner membrane (Meier and Scharf 2009; Porter, Wadhams
and Armitage 2011; Jones and Armitage 2015).
To summarise, chemoreceptors are generally positioned near the CheA protein
that they activate and contain a binding motif for CheB and CheR near the methyla-
tion regions. Thus, it is likely that for each chemoreceptor, the phosphorylation state
1. Introduction 17
of CheB proteins is related to the signals that the chemoreceptor sent to its bound
CheA. The methylation feedback is effectively contained and therefore independent.
In addition to transmembrane chemoreceptors, both S. meliloti Rm2011 and
Rlv3841 have cytoplasmic receptorschemoreceptors without transmembrane do-
mains. S. meliloti has IcpA, a transducer-like protein (TLP) that lacks both the
transmembrane domains and conserved glutamine and glutamate residues that serve
as methyl-accepting sites (Meier and Scharf 2009). It has been postulated that this
protein senses the metabolic state of the cell (Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007).
Rlv3841 has a closely related protein that has been annotated as HemAT.
HemAT is a receptor initially described in Bacillus subtilis that binds haem
and appears to act as an oxygen sensor. It has a similar domain structure to S.
melilotis IcpA, except that it requires specific tyrosine and histidine residues to
bind haem (Hou et al. 2001; Zhang, Olson and Phillips 2005). These residues
are missing in Rlv3841s HemAT. In addition, the chemoreceptor McpH matches
the domain structure of HemAT but includes the necessary residues to bind haem.
It has thus been proposed that HemAT be reannotated as IcpA and McpH as
HemAT (Miller 2007).
Rlv3841 has a copy of each of these proteins in its main chemotaxis cluster
(designated Che1). However, it also has the following genes in a separate cluster
(designated Che2): cheA2, cheY3, cheB2 and cheR2, each of which is an extra
copy of a che1 gene. The Che1 cluster has been shown to have a major role in
chemotaxis and to be required for competitive nodulation (Miller et al. 2007). The
Che2 cluster, on the other hand, does not have a clear purpose besides having a
small influence on swimming bias (Miller et al. 2007). Rlv3841 is not the only
bacterium to have multiple sets of chemotaxis proteins. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
when the active set of flagellar genes are deleted, suppressor mutations can activate
a normally inactive second set of flagellar genes. Flagella produced by these genes
are controlled by distinct chemotaxis proteins from separate operons and produce
distinct chemotactic profiles (Del Campo et al. 2007). It is possible the che2
18 1.6. Regulation of motility and chemotaxis
cluster in Rlv3841 can be activated under specific environmental conditions that
cannot be replicated easily in vitro.
1.6 Regulation of motility and chemotaxis
Both S. meliloti and Rlv3841 have the same transcriptional activation system for
flagellar and chemotaxis genes (See Figure 1.4). The class I genes consist of the
heterodimer VisNR and Rem which positively regulate the class II genes (flagellar
assembly and motor genes). The class II genes in turn activate class III genes
(flagellin and chemotaxis genes) (Sourjik et al. 2000; McCarter 2006; Rotter et al.
2006; Tambalo et al. 2010b). The class system ensures that each gene is active only
when its product is useful. In Rlv3841, VisNR and Rem are expressed throughout
exponential phase but expression drops sharply during stationary phase, although
it is still sufficient for continued motility (McCarter 2006; Tambalo et al. 2010b).
The only motility and chemotaxis genes in Rlv3841 that are independent of
VisNR are scattered chemoreceptors and, notably, the che2 cluster (Scharf, Hynes
and Alexandre 2016). This possibly allows the bacteria to target the expression
of che2 genes, but without the expression of motility genes. S. meliloti respond
to starvation conditions by increasing chemotactic movement through unknown
mechanisms while in parallel down-regulating flagellar genes (Wei and Bauer 1998).
Thus, the regulation of the chemotactic movement is independent of the regulation
of the flagellar genes. Since the regulation of che2 in Rlv3841 is independent,
the cluster may be involved in a similar response in Rlv3841. The cells appear
to make a final push to find a more favourable environment before motility is
ceased to conserve energy.
1.7 Energy taxis in bacteria
Although chemotaxis allows bacteria to target a wide range of effector compounds,
what it does not allow is dynamic targeting towards metabolically necessary
compounds. To this end bacteria have evolved parallel systems to chemotaxis,
1. Introduction 19
often labelled energy taxis. The simplest form of such systems is the use of
cytoplasmic receptors that monitor internal concentrations of critical metabolites
(Porter, Wadhams and Armitage 2011). This enables the bacteria to induce tumbling
(rejecting the current environment) in response to low cellular energy levels. Energy
taxis also spans aerotaxis, phototaxis, redox taxis, taxis to alternative electron
acceptors, and chemotaxis to carbon sources (Taylor, Zhulin and Johnson 1999). It
even overrides chemotaxis in low-energy cells (Taylor, Zhulin and Johnson 1999).
In E. coli, sugar energy taxes involve interactions between CheA and the
phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). PTS is a
system for transporting and phosphorylating carbohydrates (Figure 1.8). The
phosphate is initially transferred from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by enzyme I
(EI) and is subsequently passed via HPr and enzyme IIA (EIIA) to enzyme IIB
(EIIB). EIIB-P is responsible for phosphorylating the carbohydrates as they enter
through the transporter (EIIC) (Adler and Epstein 1974; Lengeler et al. 1981;
Postma, Lengeler and Jacobson 1993). There are multiple sets of EIIA, EIIB and
EIIC for each carbohydrate, though there is only a single copy of EI and HPr
genes. Thus, the phosphorylation state of EI and HPr acts as an overall indicator
of sugar uptake (Postma, Lengeler and Jacobson 1993). Non-phosphorylated EI
(indicative of increased amount of sugar uptake) inhibits CheA autophosphorylation,
leading to increased smooth swimming (Lux et al. 1995; Rowsell et al. 1995; Taylor,
Zhulin and Johnson 1999). Interestingly, the PTS systems of various Vibrio species
have also been found to control motility, through EIIA interacting with flagella
formation (Visick et al. 2007; Park et al. 2016). E. coli also has an additional
paralogous system called Nitrogen-PTS (PTSNtr). The system involves a similar
group of enzymes: EINtr (encoded by ptsP), NPr (ptsO/npr) and EIIANtr (ptsN )
found in the rpoN region (Rabus et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2011; Jahn et al. 2013).
PTSNtr is involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in the cell.
1.8. Chemotaxis and motility interaction with the phosphotransferase system (PTS)
in Rlv3841
Figure 1.8: Escherichia coli Phosphotransferase system. The phosphate is initially
transferred from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to either EI or EINtr, which interchange
it with HPr or NPr. HPr and NPr can transfer the phosphate to either EIIANtr or
EIIA. EIIA transfers the phosphate to EIIB which phosphorylates sugars as they are
transporter into the cell via EIIC. Through glycolysis, the metabolism of sugars, more
PEP is generated. Modified from Pflger-Grau and Grke (2010).
1.8 Chemotaxis and motility interaction with the
phosphotransferase system (PTS) in Rlv3841
The PTS in Rlv3841 is present in a greatly reduced form compared to E. coli.
There is only a single sugar-PTS component remaining, ManX (equivalent to EIIA
enzyme). In addition, there are three PTSNtr components: PtsP (equivalent to
EINtr in E. coli), NPr (as above) and PtsN (EIIANtr in E. coli). The phosphate
transfer runs in parallel to that found in E. coli. PtsP initially takes the phosphate
from PEP, which it transfers to NPr. From here, the path forks, providing the
phosphate to either PtsN or ManX. The phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
versions of these enzymes have different roles in controlling cell metabolism, nutrient
and water uptake and potentially motility (See Figure 1.9) (Prell et al. 2012;
Untiet et al. 2013). Unlike the sugar PTS, there are no membrane transport
components in PTSNtr, indicating that this system is only sensing the internal
metabolic status. Although less well studied, it is the PTSNtr that is most widely
distributed in bacteria suggesting that it has a similar role in a broad spectrum
of microorganisms (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020).
1. Introduction 21
Figure 1.9: Rlv3841 Phosphotransferase system. The phosphate is initially
transferred from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to PtsP, which interchanges it with NPr.
NPr can transfer the phosphate to either ManX or PtsN. ManX is involved in carbon
metabolism, with the non-phosphorylated version activating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle, resulting in increased synthesis of N-containing compounds. PtsN is involved in
nitrogen metabolism, the non-phosphorylated version influencing water via the potassium
transporter and the phosphorylated version increasing nutrient concentration via the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Thus, phosphophorylated ManX and PtsN
are related to increased carbon/nitrogen ratio and non-phosphorylation with reduced
carbon/nitrogen ratio (Prell et al. 2012; Untiet et al. 2013; Sanchez-Caizares et al.
2020).
In general, it appears that PtsN regulates nitrogen metabolism and ManX
regulates carbon metabolism. Thus, the control of carbon and nitrogen consumption
are linkedindeed since growth requires an ample supply of both elements, an
increased supply of carbon should ideally be linked to increasing the uptake of
nitrogen and vice-versa. Since these conditions are mutually exclusive, it could
be expected that the phosphorylated version is active for one protein and the
non-phosphorylated version for the other. That indeed appears to be the case, with
PtsN-P activating ABC transporters and non-phosphorylated ManX activating
the TCA cycle (See Figure 1.9) (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020). Because PTS
controls both the carbon and nitrogen metabolic activity in the cell, this may be the
22 1.9. Aerotaxis and the electron transport chain
system that causes the increase in chemotaxis during carbon and nitrogen starvation
conditions. In addition, preliminary unpublished work by Carmen Snchez-Caizares
from our laboratory has revealed that the PTS enzyme II, PtsN, binds to flagellar
filament proteins. This may perhaps be the mechanism through which the cell
responds to starvation of nitrogen by increasing motility.
1.9 Aerotaxis and the electron transport chain
Another common form of energy taxis is aerotaxis: movement towards an optimal
oxygen concentration. There are multiple strategies that bacteria use to sense
oxygen, including directly through sensing haem oxygen binding (e.g. DcrA of
Desulfovibrio vulgaris) and indirectly through flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
binding to sense redox potential (e.g. Aer of E. coli) (Fu, Wall and Voordouw 1994;
Bibikov et al. 1997; Greer-Phillips et al. 2003). E. colis Aer is purported to sense
changes in the redox state of FAD, which can be reduced partially to FADH or
completely to FADH2 by the electron transport chain (ETC) (Edwards, Johnson and
Taylor 2006). Thus Aer can sense any chemical that alters flux through the ETC,
such as oxygen acting as a reductant sink and oxidisable substrates such as organic
acids (Rebbapragada et al. 1997; Repik et al. 2000; Greer-Phillips et al. 2003).
In addition to taxis receptors, E. coli has sensors of oxygen concentration that
signal for transcriptional changes. The ArcB sensor kinase autophosphorylates and
phosphorylates the global transcriptional regulator ArcA. This phosphorylation is
inhibited by oxidised ubiquinone but not by its reduced form (Malpica et al. 2004;
Nitzschke and Bettenbrock 2018). Again, since oxygen acts as a reductant sink
for the ETC, high concentrations of oxygen lead to higher amounts of oxidised
ubiquinone and inhibition of ArcBA, whereas low concentrations lead to higher
amounts of reduced ubiquinone and ArcBA activation (Nochino, Toya and Shimizu
2020). A similar system exists in Rhodobacter, with the sensor kinase RegB, inhibited
by ETC activity, phosphorylating the response regulator RegA to regulate a variety
of systems, including aerobic and anaerobic respiration and aerotaxis (Elsen et
al. 2004; Willett and Crosson 2017).
1. Introduction 23
Rlv3841 encodes the ActSR system, homologous to RegBA of Rhodobacter, but
with low identity (<30%) to ArcBA of E. coli (Elsen et al. 2004). The ActSR
system is also present in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum
biovar viciae VF39 where it has been found to impact acid tolerance, likely through
pH sensing and activation of tolerance genes (Tiwari et al. 1996; Priefer et al.
2001). In addition, in Sinorhizobium medicae, ActSR was found to regulate a
variety of systems including detoxification, nitrate assimilation, nitrogen fixation
and microaerobic respiration at low pH and microaerobic conditions and to be
activated by a reduction in flux through the ETC (Fenner et al. 2004). Low pH may
also cause a reduction in ETC flux through the increased concentration of protons
inhibiting proton pumping by terminal oxidases. (Fenner et al. 2004). The system
in Rlv3841 is thus likely to also sense flux through the ETC and so could respond
to oxygen concentration, low pH and potentially oxidisable metabolites as above.
ActSR is especially interesting due to the changes in the ETC during symbiosis
(See Figure 1.10). Since the bacteroid is under microaerobic conditions while
being fed with malate, which feeds directly into the TCA cycle, there is a high
amount of reductant NADH produced that, together with succinate, reduces quinone
at the ETC, producing a strong proton motive force without oxygen as a sink
(Udvardi and Poole 2013; Degli Esposti and Martinez Romero 2016). This reductive
pressure is relieved mainly by ATP hydrolysis by nitrogenase which enables further
ATP synthase acivity to stimulate respiration (Haaker et al. 1996). ActSR is
thus likely active during bacteroid differentiation and could be transcriptionally
regulating motility during the transition to sessility. If that is indeed the case,
ActSR regulation of motility could be relevant to growth on high levels of oxidisable
metabolites, such as organic acids.
1.10 Research aims
Our main aim in this project was to assess the influence of chemotaxis and motility
upon the different stages of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. These systems
have been shown previously to be crucial for competitively forming nodule-based
24 1.10. Research aims
Figure 1.10: The energy metabolism and respiratory chain of nodulating
symbionts. Symbiotic rhizobia receive organic acids from the plant in return for fixed
nitrogen. These metabolites feed into the TCA cycle, driving NADH production and
subsequently increased oxygen consumption through the electron transport chain. This
additionally strengthens the proton-motive force by moving protons out through the inner
membrane. Reproduced from Degli Esposti and Martinez Romero (2016).
symbiosis with legumes. However, the precise stage in the symbiosis process that
causes this difference is currently unknown.
We began this project by characterising various chemotaxis and motility gene
mutants of Rlv3841, including non-motile flagella mutants and markerless deletions
of both chemotaxis clusters. This also included a bioinformatic analysis of all
27 candidate chemoreceptor genes encoded by Rlv3841 (see Chapter 3). During
the characterisation, we discovered a novel swimming behaviour of Rlv3841: the
bacterium not only adjusts its velocity in response to nutrient conditions, it can cease
swimming altogether in response to high concentrations of TCA-cycle intermediates.
To investigate the mechanism/s behind this phenotype, we began by testing the
1. Introduction 25
candidate PTS mutants. When this regulatory system proved not to be important
for the TCA-cycle intermediate response, we isolated spontaneous mutants that no
longer responded to high levels of TCA-cycle intermediates. The whole genomes of
these mutants were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed to detect differences
from the wildtype to discover the genes responsible for the effect as described in
Chapter 4. The chemotaxis and motility mutants (characterised in Chapter 3)
were then compared to the wildtype at various stages of symbiosis, as explained
in Chapter 5. The resulting data has provided a more precise description of the
importance of chemotaxis and motility during the whole symbiotic cycle. It was
found that the Che1 cluster in concert with flagella is important during early stages
of symbiosis and that the Che2 cluster is important during nodule development.

2.3 General molecular biology techniques
2.3.1 DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated from Rlv3841 cultures using DNeasy Blood & Tissue
kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturers protocols. Plasmid were isolated from
E. coli cultures using Plasmid purification kit (New England Biolabs), following
the manufacturers protocols. DNA produced by PCR or restriction digest was
purified where necessary using PCR purification or Gel purification kits (New
England Biolabs). The DNA was purified following the manufacturers protocols.
In addition, the elution volume was heated to 55 C for large plasmids.
38 2.3. General molecular biology techniques
2.3.2 DNA concentration
DNA concentration was routinely determined using broad-range dsDNA Qubit
assay. 2 L of sample was analysed as per the manufacturers protocols.
2.3.3 PCR amplification
OneTaq or GoTaq polymerases were used for colony screening with 15 L reactions.
Screening of E. coli transformants: single colony transferred into the reaction using a
pipette tip A typical OneTaq cycle was 10 minutes of 94 C denaturation followed by
30 cycles of 94 C denaturation for 30 seconds, 56-59 C annealing for 30 seconds and
70 C extension for one minute per kb, followed by 68 C extension for 10 minutes. A
typical GoTaq cycle was as above, with denaturation at 95 C and extension at 72 C.
q5 or Phusion polymerases were used for cloning or sequencing with 50 L
reactions and 5 pmol of template (typically genomic DNA). Thermocycler conditions
were set according to the manufacturers instructions for polymerases, with Tm
determined by Geneious R9. Typical annealing temperatures of 61-65 C. Typical
q5 or Phusion cycles were as above, with denaturation at 98 C and extension
for 30 seconds per kb per cycle.
2.3.4 DNA gel electrophoresis
GeneRule 1kb+ marker ladder (Thermo Scientific) was used for DNA electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis was used to identify the size of PCR products and restriction digests.
0.9% agarose (Sigma Aldrich) gel in TAE buffer pH 8.4 (400 mM Tris acetate, 1
mM EDTA) were run at 100 mV for 40 minutes. DNA was stained with Sybr Safe
DNA stain (Invitrogen) and visualised with GelDoc EZ System (BioRad).
2.3.5 General DNA sequencing
15 L of purified DNA at 50-100 ng/L was mixed with 2 L of primer for Sanger
sequencing by Eurofins genomics.
2. General materials and methodology 39
2.4 Cloning
2.4.1 Restriction digests and DNA ligation
When necessary, purified DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases in 50 L
reactions. The enzymes were heat inactivated after digestion. DNA was ligated with
T4 DNA ligase in T4 DNA ligase buffer (Thermo Scientific) at RT for 30 minutes.
2.4.2 InFusion HD cloning
InFusion HD cloning was performed using InFusion HD cloning kit (ClonTech).
The parts were generated with 15-20 bp overhangs on the primers and were cloned
using a thermocycler according to the manufacturers protocols. This process was
tested in silico using Geneious R9.
2.4.3 NEBuilder Hi-Fidelity cloning
NEBuilder Hi-Fi cloning was performed using NEB NEBuilder master mix (NEB).
Primers to amplify the parts were generated using the online NEBuilder as-
sembly tool (nebuilder.neb.com). The process was additionally tested in silico
using Geneious R9.
2.4.4 Transformation
Cloned plasmids were transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5 cells
generated in the laboratory. A DH5 culture was incubated in 500 mL LB for 3
hours at 37 C. Once the culture reached an optical density of OD600 0.3-0.4, it was
incubated on ice 10 minutes. Then, the cells were pelleted at 4000 rpm at 4 C
for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mL ice cold 0.1 M CaCl2 15%
glycerol (v/v) and incubated on ice for 15-30 minutes. The suspension was then
pelleted at 4000 rpm 4 C for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mL
ice cold 0.1 M CaCl2 15% glycerol (v/v) and incubated at 4 C for 30 minutes.
Aliquots (50-200 L) were dispensed into chilled Eppendorf tubes and snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Competent cells were stored at -80 C.
40 2.4. Cloning
For transformation, E. coli was thawed on ice and combined at a ratio of 50
L per 2-10 L of DNA mix. The cells were then heat-shocked at 42 C for 30
seconds and returned to ice for 2 minutes. The cells were then diluted to 1 mL
in SOC media (Melford) and shaken at 37 C for 1 hour. 100 L was plated and
the remained was pelleted at 10000 rpm for 1 minute and resuspended in 100 L
and was also spread-plated on LB media with appropriate antibiotics and X-gal
where necessary. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 C.
2.4.5 Tri-parental conjugation from E. coli into Rlv3841
Tri-parental mating was used to transfer plasmids from their E. coli stock, via an
E. coli strain containing the conjugation plasmid pRK2013, into various Rlv3841
strains. The rhizobia were grown for 3 days on TY slopes and washed in 3 mL of TY.
The E. coli were grown in 10 mL of LB liquid culture overnight, then subcultured
1:100 and grown to exponential phase. These were all pelleted at 4500 rpm for 10
minutes and washed thrice with TY (at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes for later pelleting
stages). 300 L each of the E. coli and 400 L of rhizobia were then mixed and
pelleted at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes. This pellet was then resuspended in 20 L of
TY, spotted on plain TY media and incubated overnight at 28 C. A streak from
the droplet was spread on TY media with appropriate antibiotics and left to grow
3-4 days at 28 C. Nitrofurantoin at 20 g mL1 was used to select against E. coli.
2.4.6 Di-parental conjugation from E. coli into Rlv3841
Alternatively, di-parental mating was also used with E. coli ST18, containing both
the conjugation genes and the plasmid to be transferred. This strain requires a
supplement of 50 g mL1 of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to be added to the
media. The rhizobia were grown in 10 mL of TY liquid culture for 3 days. The E.
coli were grown in 10 mL of LB liquid culture overnight, then subcultured 1:100
and grown to exponential phase. These were all pelleted at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes
and washed twice with TY (first 1 mL, then 400 L). 100 L each of the E. coli
and rhizobia were mixed and spotted onto TY + ALA. 100 L of each was also
2. General materials and methodology 41
spotted individually for negative controls. These droplets were incubated overnight
at 28 C after drying. The droplets were then resuspended in 200 L of TY media
and serial diluted ten-fold three times. 100 L of each dilution was then spread
onto selective TY media, without supplemented ALA.
2.5 Mutagenesis techniques
2.5.1 Tn5 transduction
This technique was used to remove possible extraneous mutations in Tn5 marked
strains. Firstly, the donor strain was grown on a TY slope and washed in 3 mL
sterile H2O. 100 L of this was mixed with a serial dilution (10-2 - 10-6) of the
phage RL38 (Buchanan-Wollaston 1979). Controls with no bacteria or no phage
were also made. These mixtures were added to 4 mL of molten 50% TY/ 50%
TY agar (at 42 C) and poured into a petri dish. The dishes were then incubated
for 2-3 days at 28 C. At this stage, a plate was chosen at the point just before
complete confluence and eluted by adding 10 mL of H2O and rocking for 2 hours.
The solution (called phage prep or phage lysate) was millipore filtered and combined
with 2-4 drops of chloroform for storage at 4 C.
After this, the recipient strain was grown on TY slopes for 2-3 days. The slopes
were washed with 3 mL TY. 200 L of this was mixed with 1 L of a three times
ten-fold serial dilution of the phage lysate. Again, mixtures with no phage or
non bacteria were used as negative controls. These mixtures were incubated at
28 C for 1 hour then 100 L of each was spread on TY plates with a selective
concentration of kanamycin (Section 2.6.2). After incubating the plates at 28 C for
3-5 days, early single colonies were picked and spread on selective TY plates. These
colonies were screened using colony PCR with an inward facing primer specific for
the target insertion and the general outward-facing Tn5 primer. The amplified
region of successful colonies were sequenced using these same primers (Eurofins
MWG Operon). Positive mutants were subsequently stocked at -80 C.
42 2.6. Media
2.5.2 Double cross-over mutagenesis by pK18mobSacB
This technique was used to isolate stable mutants. The plasmid pK18mobSacB was
first digested with SmaI. Primers were designed to amplify regions of approximately
1000 bp precisely flanking the DNA region of interest. These were designed
as per Section 2.4.3 to work with NEBuilder Hi-Fidelity cloning. The flanking
regions were then amplified using the primers with q5 polymerase and cloned into
pK18mobSacB with NEBuilder. The product of this reaction was transformed into
chemically competent DH5, and plated on LB containing a selective concentration
of kanamycin and X-gal to allow blue-white selection (Section 2.6.2). Correct
colonies (white) were confirmed using PCR mapping and subsequent sequencing
(Eurofins MWG Operon). M13F and M13R primers were used for the mapping
and sequencing reactions. Once a plasmid was confirmed to be correct, it was
transformed into E. coli ST18 to enable di-parental mating.
Next, the plasmid was conjugated into Rlv3841 (Section 2.4.6). Conjugants
were selected on TY with a selective concentration of kanamycin. Provided there
was no growth on control plates, two positive colonies were inoculated into 10
mL of non-selective TY media. After grown to stationary phase, the cultures
were serial diluted ten-fold four times. 100 L of each dilution was then spread
onto TY media supplemented with 10% (v/v) sucrose. 20-40 colonies were then
screened using colony PCR with the outer primers for the flanking regions above. A
successful deletion produced a truncated PCR product relative to the wild type. The
colonies were also passaged onto TY and TY with kanamycin. A successful deletion
was positive for growth on TY but not on TY with kanamycin. The amplified
region of two colonies that were successful under both tests were sequenced using
newly designed inward facing primers (Eurofins MWG Operon). The mutants
were subsequently stocked at -80 C.
2.6 Media
2. General materials and methodology 43
2.6.1 Media recipes
Tryptone-yeast (TY) media was used as a rich-media growth source for Rhizobium
strains. This consisted of: 3 g  L1 yeast extract, 5 g  L1 tryptone and 1.3 g  L1
CaCl2. 17.5 g  L1 agar was added prior to autoclaving for solid medium.
Universal minimal salts (UMS) media was used as a minimal-media growth
source for Rhizobium strains. This consisted of: 0.5 g  L1 MgSO4  7H2O, 0.2
g  L1 NaCl, 4.19 g  L1 MOPS, 0.5 mM K2HPO4 and 1 mL of trace elements
(0.375 g  L1 EDTA Na2, 0.16 g  L1 ZnSO4  7H2O, 0.2 g  L1 NaMoO4, 0.25
g  L1 H3BO3, 0.2 g  L1 MnSO4  4H2O, 0.02 g  L1 CuSO4  5H2O and 1 g  L1
CoCl2  6H2O). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7 prior to autoclaving. After
autoclaving, the media was supplemented with 1 mL of calcium stock solution
(75 g  L1 CaCl2  2H2O), 1 mL of iron stock solution (12 g  L1 FeSO4  7H2O
dissolved in 1 M HCl) and 1 mL of vitamin stock solution (1 g  L1 thiamine
hydrochloride, 2 g  L1 D-pantothenic acid calcium salt, 100 mg  L1 biotin). Prior
to use, the media was also supplemented with carbon and nitrogen sources. These
included glucose, succinate, fumarate, malate, acetate, arabinose and pyruvate
carbon sources and ammonium chloride, glutamate and glutamine nitrogen sources.
Luria-Bertani broth (LB) media was used as a rich-media growth source for E.
coli strains. This consisted of: 10 g  L1 tryptone, 5 g  L1 yeast extract and 5
g  L1 NaCl. 14 g  L1 agar was added prior to autoclaving for solid medium.
Antibiotics were added to media in concentrations described in Section 2.6.2.
Since Rlv3841 is a spontaneous streptomycin resistant strain, streptomycin at 500
g mL1 was used routinely for selection of Rlv3841.
In addition, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactopyranoside) at 40
g mL1 was added to media for blue-white screening with E. coli.

2.7 Bacterial growth conditions and assays
2.7.1 Bacterial growth conditions
All rhizobia grown at 28 C in TY or UMS media. For liquid cultures, aeration was
achieved through shaking at 200-225 rpm at 28C. E. coli strains were grown at 37
C in LB media. Liquid cultures were aerated by shaking at 150 rpm in 37 C.
2.7.2 Generation time of rhizobial strains
To assess the growth rate of a strain, 24-well plates were inoculated at OD600
= 0.01 in 20 mM succinate and 10 mM NH4Cl supplemented UMS media. The
growth was determined by the increase in optical density over time as measured
by a PlateReader.
2.7.3 Semi-solid agar swimming assay
To assess the swimming ability of strains under various media conditions, they were
grown on 0.22% agar UMS media plates supplemented with various metabolisable
nitrogen and carbon sources. These carbon and nitrogen compounds were all
metabolites and therefore there is the potential for metabolism to generate tactic
gradients within the plate. The inoculant was grown on TY slopes for 3 days
2. General materials and methodology 45
before being resuspended in 3-4 mL UMS and normalised to an optical density of
OD600 = 1.8. 2 L of the culture was then inoculated into the centre of each plate,
forming a column through the agar. The plates were incubated at 28 C for 4-7
days. The diameter of the bacterial halo was then measured to the nearest mm.
These halos are formed as a result of both motility and metabolism, with both
increased swimming and growth producing larger halos. In addition, the 4-7 day
timescale allows changes due to gene expression, potentially changing the presence
or number of flagella and taxis proteins. The overall diameter is a summation of all
of the above effects and represents semi-solid propagation of the bacteria.
2.7.4 Single cell tracking
To assess the distribution of swimming patterns within strain populations, individual
cells were tracked. The inoculant was grown on TY slopes for 3 days before being
resuspended in 3-4 mL UMS and diluted to an optical density of OD600 = 0.1 in 10
mL of UMS supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 10 mM NH4Cl. These cultures
were incubated overnight at 28 C. Next, the cultures were diluted again to an
optical density of OD600 = 0.1 in 10 mL of UMS supplemented with the tested
carbon and nitrogen sources. These cultures were incubated for 3 hours at 28
C, and staggered to keep the incubation time constant. Each culture was then
drawn into a rectangular capillary, sealed at both ends with vacuum grease, and
placed on a microscope slide. The cells were then visualised on a Meiji microscope
with 40x lens and recorded using an Infinity lite camera (1440 x 1080 pixels at 10
fps). Four technical replicate images were taken along the length of the capillary,
at the top surface of the capillary. The images were then run through an image
analysis pipeline (github.com/AroneyS/Capillary-tracking). This pipeline produced
individual tracks for each bacteria, calculating the overall swimming speed and
the tumble rate (See Figure 2.1).
46 2.7. Bacterial growth conditions and assays
Figure 2.1: Bacterium swimming tracking. Each raw image (A) was processed to
enable automated identification of individual bacteria (spots) that were then combined
into tracks (line) as in B.
2.7.5 Flagella staining
Due to disruptions caused by the 2020 pandemic, the flagella staining experiments
were unable to be completed.
These experiments would have determined the presence of flagella in the non-
motile mutant strains (to confirm presence in the motA mutant and absence in
the fliG mutant) and under high TCA-cycle intermediate conditions (to determine
if the halting effect was due to lack of flagella).
The flagella staining solution consisted of 0.2 g mL1 Tannic acid solution in
5% phenol combined 1:1 with a saturated KAl(SO4)2  12H2O solution and then
together combined 10:1 with saturated crystal violet stain in ethanol (0.12 g mL1)
(Kodaka et al. 1982a; Heimbrook, Wang and Campbell 1989a).
As above, the bacteria were grown on TY slopes for 3 days before being
resuspended in 3-4 mL UMS and diluted to an optical density of OD600 = 0.1
in 10 mL of UMS supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 10 mM NH4Cl. These
cultures were incubated overnight at 28 C. Next, the cultures were diluted again
to an optical density of OD600 = 0.1 in 10 mL of UMS supplemented with the
2. General materials and methodology 47
tested carbon and nitrogen sources. These cultures were incubated for 3 hours at
28 C, and staggered to keep the incubation time constant. Each culture was then
spotted onto a microscope slide and dried. The slide was then flooded with the
staining solution for 5 minutes before being washed thoroughly with tap water for
2-3 minutes. After drying, the presence of flagella was then scored by visualising
on a microscope at x97 magnification.
2.8 Legume growth conditions
2.8.1 Germination of Pisum sativum
P. sativum cv. Aveola seeds were surface sterilised by immersing in 95% ethanol for
60 seconds then washing in sterile H2O, then immersing in 2% sodium hypochlorite
for 5 minutes. Seeds were then repeatedly washed in 400 mL sterile MilliQ H2O
to remove sterilisers. Seeds were germinated for 2 day by embedding in 0.8%
water agar and leaving in dark at RT.
2.8.2 Germination of Vicia villosa
V. villosa seeds were porated with sandpaper until a change in seed coat colour
was observed. The seeds were then surface sterilised by immersing in 2% sodium
hypochlorite for 5 minutes. Seeds were then repeatedly washed in 400 mL sterile
MilliQ H2O to remove sterilisers. Seeds were left imbibing for 3-4 hours in a
sealed falcon tube of sterile H2O. Seeds were then germinated by embedding in
0.8% water agar, covering the plates in aluminium foil and left at 4 C for 2 days,
then at RT for a further 2 days.
2.8.3 Pisum sativum growth conditions
Pea was typically grown in 500 mL pots or boiling tubes. The pots were filled
with either a 50:50 mixture of medium vermiculite and silver sand or only medium
vermiculite. Both were supplemented with either 50 mL of 2.57x or 150 mL of 1x
nitrogen-free rooting solution respectively (see Section 2.8.5). Pots were autoclaved
prior to planting. The pots were planted with germinated seedlings and inoculated
48 2.8. Legume growth conditions
with 1 mL of diluted bacterial cultures. Pots were then covered with cling-film
to prevent bacterial contamination and grown in a controlled environment room.
After 3-6 days, when the shoot had reached the cling-film, it was cut with a sterile
scalpel. Any additional peas added as backups were removed after one week. The
plants were watered with 50 mL of sterile H2O weekly until harvest.
Boiling tubes were 3/4 filled with washed and dried fine vermiculite supplemented
with 25 mL of nitrogen-free rooting solution (see Section 2.8.5). The tubes were
sealed with foam plugs, then autoclaved prior to planting. Germinated seedlings
were planted within the vermiculite and inoculated with 1 mL of diluted bacterial
cultures. The tubes were then sealed again with the foam plug and grown in a
controlled environment room until harvest.
2.8.4 Vicia villosa growth conditions
Vetch was typically grown in 10 cm square petri dishes containing sloped 1% agar
FP media (Fahraeus 1957). The plates were planted with five germinated seedlings
per plate and inoculated with 50 L of diluted bacterial cultures. Plates were
then sealed with millipore tape to prevent bacterial contamination and covered
in aluminium foil to block light on the roots. The plates were then grown in a
tissue culture room until harvest.
2.8.5 Recipe for Nitrogen-free rooting solution
Nitrogen-free rooting solution was used to provide the nutrients for plant growth
without a source of nitrogen to incentivise rhizobial symbiosis. This consisted
of: 4 mM Na2HPO4, 3.7 mM K2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 800 M MgSO4, 100 M
KCl, 35 M H3BO3, 10 M Fe EDTA, 9 M MnCl2, 0.8 M ZnCl2, 0.5 M
Na2MoO4, 0.3 M CuSO4.
2.8.6 Plant stain for enzyme activity
To differentiate nodules colonised by different strains on the same plant, the bacteria
were marked with two enzyme genes to enable differential staining. Firstly, the gene
2. General materials and methodology 49
gusA encoding a -glucuronidase which produces the colour magenta with addition
of Magenta-GlcA (5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronide). Magenta-GlcA
stock solution was made with 0.2 g of Magenta-GlcA dissolved in 10 mL of dimethyl-
formamide (DMF) and stored, covered in aluminium foil, at -40 C. Secondly, the
gene celB encoding a thermostable -galactosidase which produces the colour blue
with addition of X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactoside). X-Gal stock
solution was made with 0.2 g of X-Gal dissolved in 10 mL of dimethylformamide
(DMF) and stored, covered in aluminium foil, at -40 C. The plants were stained
sequentially, as detailed below, in a phosphate buffer consisting of 7 g/L NaH2PO4,
7.2 g/L Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), 1% Sarkosyl and 1 mL/L Triton.
Firstly, the plant roots were cut after the seed and at the end of the roots
after the last nodules. For -glucuronidase activity, the roots were submerged
in a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 40 mL phosphate buffer supplemented with
400 L of Magenta-GlcA solution. The tubes were then covered with aluminium
foil and incubated at 28 C overnight, producing magenta nodules. The buffer
was then refreshed and the tubes were incubated at 70 C for 1 hour to destroy
endogenous -galactosidases. For -galactosidase activity, after cooling, 500 L
of X-Gal solution was added to each tube. The tubes were then incubated at 37
C overnight, producing blue nodules. Finally, the roots were rinsed with diluted
bleach (1:1 dilution in water) for 10-15 minutes and stored in water at 4 C.
2.9 Computational analysis
2.9.1 In silico cloning
All cloning reactions and genome integrations were designed in silico and confirmed
by sequence alignment (see Section 2.3.5) using Geneious R10.
2.9.2 Bioinformatic analysis
Global nucleotide and protein alignments were carried out using BLASTn and
BLASTp (NCBI), respectively. Local alignments, against references from the
50 2.9. Computational analysis
NCBI database, were carried out with Geneious R10 using the Geneious align-
ment algorithm.
2.9.3 Data-handling and statistical analysis
Data handling, statistical analysis and graph generation was carried out in R (R
Core Team 2019). The following packages were used: tidyverse (Wickham et al.
2019), cowplot (Wilke 2019), lme4 (Bates et al. 2015), lmerTest (Kuznetsova,
Brockhoff and Christensen 2017), emmeans (Lenth 2020), ggeffects (Ldecke 2018),

and scales (Wickham and Seidel 2020).
A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium
leguminosarum
3.1 Introduction
Post-translational control of flagella-based motility in bacteria occurs through
chemotaxis systems. These systems control flagella by biasing the tumbling
frequency, causing changes in swimming direction. This control occurs via binding
of phosphorylated CheY to the FliMN switch complex (see Chapter 1). As described
in Section 1.5, Rhizobium leguminosarum has two different chemotaxis clusters
which drive movement of a single flagellum.
The Che1 cluster is the main controller of free swimming behaviour and, while
the Che2 cluster has a minor impact on regulation of the Che1 cluster, the role of
the Che2 cluster is unknown (Miller et al. 2007). These clusters contain the only
three cheY genes found in the Rlv3841 genome by BLAST. Rlv3841 has a total
of 25 chemoreceptors but only McpB and McpC have been characterised (Yost,
Rochepeau and Hynes 1998; Yost et al. 2004). An mcpB mutant had inhibited
chemotaxis towards a wide range of compounds, while both mutants had greatly
reduced nodule formation in competition against wildtype.
To test the sensory systems of Rhizobium leguminosarum and probe their effects
on flagella-based motility, a number of mutants of Rlv3841 were characterised
52 3.2. Starvation response in Rlv3841 vs Sme2011
in this work (Table 3.1). Firstly, three mutants in flagellar critical genes were
isolated as a baseline for non-motility. Secondly, three motile chemotaxis mutants
were obtained from Michael Hynes (Hynes lab, University of Calgary) to test their
individual impacts (Miller et al. 2007). With all these mutants, we defined the
motility parameters and investigated the chemotaxis response of R. leguminosarum
under various metabolic and growth conditions. In addition, we also searched for
potential chemoreceptors and conducted a bioinformatic classification, characterising
experimentally those that appeared to sense internally.

3.2 Starvation response in Rlv3841 vs Sme2011
We began the investigation by monitoring wildtype swimming levels in semi-solid
agar swimming plates, across a wide range of carbon sources in minimal media
supplemented with 10 mM ammonium and different carbon sources at low and
high concentrations (10-fold difference) (Figure 3.1). These carbon and nitrogen
compounds were all metabolites and therefore there is the potential for metabolism
to generate tactic gradients within the plate. The wildtype strains chosen were
Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) and a well-studied relative,
Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm2011 (Sme2011).
Firstly, Sme2011 swam further than or equal to Rlv3841 under all conditions
tested. This is likely to be due to Sme2011 having increased swimming speed,

zobium meliloti Rm2011 (Sme2011). Data was modelled with a Gaussian linear model
with the factors strain, carbon source, carbon concentration and their interactions. All
factors were found to be significant, P<1e-13, ANOVA. Tukeys Post-hoc test was used
to stratify data within strains into groups, where those groups not sharing a letter were

although this cannot be confirmed in this type of assay. On these plates, an
optimum halo diameter is formed at a tumbling rate high enough to efficiently
navigate the agar matrix but low enough to allow sufficient swimming (Mohari
et al. 2015). For a strain and condition, the halo diameter can be considered
a measure of discontentment or unfavourability. Meaning that the higher the
halo diameter, the less content the bacteria are with their current environment.
This arises from the idea that chemotaxis increases the tumble rate under low
attractant or high repellent conditions.
Rlv3841 displayed reduced halo diameters at higher carbon concentration across
all compounds. Of these, the largest effects were on succinate and acetate, with
weak effects on sugars. On inspection of the halos, there appears to be a metabolic
effect occurring on acetate. In this carbon source, the halos were very small and
faint, indicating a low rate of growth. In comparison, although on high succinate
the halos were small, Rlv3841 formed a thick, clumped halo. Sme2011 also displayed
54 3.3. Isolation and characterisation of motility mutants
a weak effect under glucose and arabinose and, like Rlv3841, showed a strong effect
on acetate. However, there was no change for succinate and a reversed response for
pyruvate. In high acetate, Sme2011 also displayed small, faint halos. Interestingly,
Sme2011 appears to be blind to succinate, with no change in swimming response.
This may be explained by the presence of a chemoreceptor in Rlv3841 that is
not present in Sme2011. Indeed, Rlv3841 encodes 25 different receptors, whereas
Sme2011 has only 8 (Zatakia et al. 2017).
3.3 Isolation and characterisation of motility mu-
tants
To test the phenotypes of flagellar mutants, three different in-frame deletion mutants
were isolated from Rlv3841. Firstly, motA (RL0703), encoding a critical motor
stator protein, was deleted to produce a strain with non-rotating flagella. Secondly,
fliG (RL0700), encoding a critical motor rotor protein, was deleted to produce a
non-flagellated strain. And finally, flaA (RL0718), encoding a flagellar filament
protein, was deleted to produce a strain unable to form stable flagellar filaments.
Plans to confirm the flagellation status of these mutants were not completed due
to the 2020 Pandemic lock-downs.
To isolate these mutants, double crossover mutations were made using a pK19-
mobsacB strategy, as described in Section 2.5.2. This produced plasmids pOPS1412,
pOPS1422 and pOPS1423. After single crossover, integration was mapped using
primers oxp3919+oxp3920, oxp3937+oxp3938 and oxp3925+oxp3926 and double
crossover was selected for using 10% sucrose. Deletion of each gene was confirmed by
mapping using primers oxp4055+oxp4056, oxp4063+oxp4064 and oxp4059+oxp4060
and sequencing the amplified fragments. These strains were named OPS2107
(motA), OPS2163 (fliG) and OPS2234 (flaA).
The swimming ability was first tested in swimming plates, across a wide range
of carbon sources in minimal media. All of the motA, fliG and flaA mutants
displayed significantly reduced swimming diameters across all media conditions
(Figure 3.2), confirming that they were all affected in motility. Indeed the expected
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 55
non-flagellated and non-rotating flagella producing strains motA and fliG appeared
to form only growth-driven halos, indicating a small role under these conditions
for the presumably intact pili system.
3.4 Motility of chemotaxis-gutted mutants to form
a negative control for the absence of chemo-
taxis
To test the sensory systems in Rhizobium leguminosarum, three mutants in Rlv3841
were obtained from Michael Hynes laboratory: LM100 (che1, RL0685-94), LM400
(che2, RL4028-36) and LM300 (che1che2 ). The main chemotaxis system is
che1, with only a minor effect on tumbling rate attributed to che2 (Miller et
al. 2007). All three strains were found to be motile by testing their swimming
ability in minimal media swimming plates with a variety of carbon sources at two
different concentrations and also an additional test with a nitrogen-poor (glutamate)
and a nitrogen-rich (glutamine) source, with high glucose (10 mM) as carbon
source (Figure 3.3).
Wildtype Rlv3841 displayed significant differences between high and low concen-
trations of glucose, succinate, pyruvate, arabinose and acetate. In addition, we also
discovered the same effect in fumarate and malate media. One confounding factor
was revealed by the glutamate vs glutamine data. Although there were significant
differences between wildtype swimming in glutamate vs glutamine media in earlier
experiments, this was not a reproducible difference. This might be explained by
the residual nitrogen present in the agar itself varying across batches used in these
experimental replicates. Although the agar concentration was fairly low (0.22%),
differences in nitrogen content per batch may have masked the swimming effect of
varying amino acid sources. To avoid this effect, agarose was tested as a nitrogen-free
alternative to agar. However agarose has different gelling properties and produced
inconsistent results. If there is an impact on swimming between glutamate and
glutamine, it is a much smaller effect than that due to carbon sources.

Among the mutants tested, che2 displayed reductions in swimming halo diameter
under the same media conditions as wildtype. However, it also had significantly
reduced diameter over wildtype on all low-concentration carbon sources, high-
concentration pyruvate, glutamate and glutamine. Although significant, these
reductions were minor in comparison to the che1 mutant, reinforcing Che1 as the
main chemotaxis system. The che1 and che1,2 mutants had comparable results
where tested. This was a reduction in swimming diameter over wildtype in all
conditions except high succinate, fumarate and acetate. In addition, there was no
significant difference found between high and low concentrations of glucose, pyruvate
and arabinose or between glutamate and glutamine. This agrees with above that the
chemotaxis cluster encoded by che1 is responsible for the majority of chemotactic
response (i.e. for glucose, pyruvate and arabinose). Interestingly, deletion of che1
did not remove the difference between high and low concentration of the TCA-cycle
intermediates succinate, malate and fumarate or for acetate. Indeed, this reduction
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 59
brought each strain to the same diameter as wildtype (except for a minor, but
significant, reduction of the che1 mutant vs wildtype on high-concentration malate).
Swimming on high acetate matched that observed above on wildtype Rlv3841
and Sme2011, producing small, faint halos indicative of low growth rate (Figure
3.4C and F). This is thus independent of chemotaxis, as would be expected of
a growth-rate dependent response. However, all halos of high succinate, malate
and fumarate were again thick and clumped (Figure 3.4B and E). We theorised
that this is a chemotaxis-independent effect. The shape and structure of the halos
can be explained by a system that shuts down motility or causes non-flagellation
under high TCA-cycle intermediate concentrations. The structure is then formed
by high consumption of the nutrient source in the centre of the plate, leading to
its exhaustion and causing motility to be reactivated or flagella resynthesised until
swimming takes the bacteria back to a higher concentration. Growth from those
positions reached by the temporarily swimming bacteria causes the clumping. It
should be noted that high concentrations of these metabolites (20-30 mM) may
be saturating responses and thus oversimplifying any relationships between the
concentration and the halo diameter.
To confirm that this result was independent of growth rate, the swimming
behaviour of individual bacteria were tracked via image analysis of microscopy
videos. This growth-independence was considered very likely since the media
conditions expected to have higher growth rate (high concentrations) had smaller
swimming halos.
3.5 Chemotaxis-gutted mutant still responds to
succinate
To study the effect of the TCA-cycle intermediates, the swimming behaviour of
individual wildtype (Rlv3841) and the che1 cluster mutant (LM100) bacteria were
initially tested in minimal media (UMS with 10 mM NH4Cl) supplemented with
various succinate concentrations (20 mM as high and 2 mM as low). If a succinate
concentration dependent effect was found on the swimming of individual bacteria,
60 3.5. Chemotaxis-gutted mutant still responds to succinate
there would be strong evidence that the effect is growth-independent. The che1
cluster mutant was tested to confirm chemotaxis-independence of the succinate
concentration effect. The assay was performed as detailed in Section 2.7.4. Tracking
bacteria on surfaces has previously been found to cause some artefacts: the tendency
to increased track curvature, hydrodynamic attraction reducing tumbling off the
surface and increased effect of Brownian motion (Frymier et al. 1995; Berke et al.
2008; Li, Tam and Tang 2008). Despite this, tracking on the surface was chosen
to prevent tumbles taking the cells out of the 2D plane of focus being recorded,
which would otherwise lead to an abundance of short tracks with biased tumble
rate. In addition, the surface was found to have an increased swimming population
and acts as an approximation to root surface swimming.
Initial analysis of the motile fraction of cells revealed significant differences
between low and high succinate conditions (Figure 3.5A). This was calculated as
the overall motility of the video (recorded time of motile spots / total time of
spots), to avoid bias from counting motile cells multiple times. Both wildtype and
che1 had very similar effects, having significantly higher motile fractions in low
succinate. This indicates that there is a succinate dependent effect on motility
that is independent of the presence or absence of Che system chemotaxis. Indeed
the strain factor was not found to be significant (ANOVA). This data agrees with
the hypothesis described above (Section 3.4), that high succinate concentration is
triggering a low-motility state, through halting or deflagellation.
The overall tumble rate for each replicate was also calculated (Figure 3.5B). This
data describes both a change by strain (reduced tumble rate for the che1 mutant)
and by media (reduced tumble rate in high succinate). The data for wildtype at low
succinate had high variability, so all its comparisons were non-significant. To avoid
this discrepancy, more replicates are needed. Otherwise, the data shows significant
differences between the che1 mutant at both media conditions and between wildtype
and the che1 mutant at high succinate. This indicates that the che1 mutation
does impact tumble-rate, reducing it as expected. However, there is a change in
tumble-rate between media conditions that is not expected. Tumble rate is thought

62 3.5. Chemotaxis-gutted mutant still responds to succinate
to mostly be a result of the chemotaxis system. So, we would expect the che1
mutants tumble rate to be very low and consistent across media conditions. This
discrepancy may be due to the Che2 system that is still present in that mutant
(investigated in Section 4). Alternatively, it could be due to changes in the proton-
motive force driving motility due to succinate increasing the oxygen consumption
through the electron-transport chain. In addition, it may be due to a small number
of tracks that were found to have high tumble rates. These tracks tended to have
unrealistic trajectories and were likely an artefact. They seemed to generally be
formed by the tracking software combining motile and non-motile tracks and thus
would have a higher expected presence in low succinate with a higher motile fraction.
Therefore the data generated from these assays was obtained by tracking first the
non-motile spots and removing them from later analysis. Although this greatly
reduced the impact of these tracks and reduced the variability between replicates,
some were still present, causing a baseline tumble rate.
Finally, the average swimming speeds were analysed (Figure 3.5C). Since this
was a continuous measurement, the individual bacteria could be plotted. As for
the tumble rate, the data describes both a change by strain (increased speed for
the che1 mutant) and by media (increased speed in low succinate). The difference
between wildtype and the che1 mutant may be explained by the reduction in tumble
rate, since the bacteria slow down and stop with each tumble, and this timing was
not removed from the speed calculations. However, the media effect cannot be
explained in this way, since the bacteria are both swimming faster and tumbling
more often in low succinate. This effect may be due to the same mechanism that
causes the succinate effect on the motile fraction. The bacteria are both swimming
less often and swimming at slower speed in high succinate. This effect also clearly
occurs for the che1 mutant bacteria.
The succinate-dependent control of motility appears to be independent of both
growth-rate and the chemotaxis cluster 1. In Section 4, I discuss motility tracking
for a wider range of mutants under more media conditions. To check whether this

effect was due to chemoreceptors signalling via a different pathway, each receptor
was bioinformatically analysed as reported in the next section.
3.6 The chemoreceptors of Rhizobium legumi-
nosarum biovar viciae 3841
The chemoreceptors, or methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), of Rhi-
zobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 were bioinformatically analysed. This
involved searching the genome for MCP signal domains, aligning all the candidate
proteins and generating a phylogenetic tree as displayed in Figure 3.6. The MCP
signal domain was chosen due to its high conservation across chemoreceptors,
allowing easy identification. These MCP domains represent the protein segment
responsible for CheA/CheW binding. The phylogenetic analysis compared the 27
candidate chemoreceptors from Rlv3841 to eight chemoreceptors from the well-
studied Sinorhizobium meliloti RU11/001.
In addition to the MCP signal domain, most chemoreceptors contained one
or more of the following domains: HAMP domains, acting as signal transmission
from sensor domain to the signalling domain (Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova
2017); sensory domains, highly varied and including a number of different classes
(e.g. Cache, PAS, protoglobin); transmembrane domains, typically present in a
pair and surrounding the sensory domain, which causes most sensory domains
to sense in the periplasm, with the remaining sensors being detached from the
membrane and sensing in the cytoplasm.

The Rlv3841 genome consists of seven DNA molecules, a large chromosome
and six different plasmids (Young et al. 2006). Chemoreceptor candidate genes
were found distributed across the entire genome, with 21 in the main chromosome,
one in pRL8, one in pRL10 and four in pRL12 (see Table 3.2). Interestingly, one
chemoreceptor was located within the che1 cluster in the chromosome (RL0685),
and three were located within the che2 cluster in the chromosome (RL4031-4033).
3.6.1 MCP heptad classes
In addition to the domain classification, chemoreceptors can be categorised by heptad
counts. The heptad is a repeated 7-amino acid structure that is mirrored from
the centre of the MCP signal domain upstream to the HAMP and transmembrane
domains, and downstream to the C-terminus. All Rlv3841 chemoreceptors are
class 36H (consist of 36 heptads) except McrA, McrB and McrC (within the
che2 cluster) which are class 34H, missing two heptads in the flexible bundle
subdomain (Alexander and Zhulin 2007; Ortega and Zhulin 2018). This matches

from Rlv3841 and Sinorhizobium meliloti RU11/001 based on MCP signal

following a standard MCP analysis pipeline (Ortega and Zhulin 2018) using the following
tools: MAFFT 7.407, RAxML 8.2.12, HMMER 3.2.1, Jalview 2.10.5 and Dendroscope

the chemoreceptors in S. meliloti RU11, which were are all class 36H, save McpS
(within a secondary chemotaxis cluster) which is class 40H (Alexander and Zhulin
2007). These classes mainly seem to indicate evolutionary history, with no particular
functional difference between the 34H and 36H classes.
3.6.2 Methylation
The final area for general MCP analysis is a description of methylation residues.
These residues are methylated by CheR, demethylated by CheB and deamidated
by CheD to finely tune the sensitivity of the receptors. The methylation zones
of most chemoreceptors follow the consensus sequence of (3.1) below, where the
highlighted residue is the methylation target (Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova 2017).
This notation is matched in the putative methylation residues described below.

N-terminal methylation area
The first zone is in the N-terminal side of the MCP signal domain from heptads
N14 to N11. In the well studied E. coli Tsr chemoreceptors, the sequence across
these heptads is (3.2)A. The highlighted residues are experimentally confirmed
methylation sites (Rice and Dahlquist 1991). Most of the Rlv3841 chemoreceptors
instead match the consensus motif of (3.2)B. Where residues are highlighted to

(3.2)
The close identity with the E. coli sequence, combined with the conservation of
the EQ methylation sites and neighbouring EQ, indicates that these methylation
sites are likely to be active in Rlv3841. There are, however, some interesting
discrepancies. McrA, McrB and McrC are again divergent, matching instead the
E. coli sequence with 100% identity. In addition, McpI, McpJ and McpP are
missing the first EQ methylation site; McpO is missing the first and third; and
IcpA is missing all three sites. Finally, RL1386 and RL1447 (putative MCPs)
both have poor alignment in this area.
C-terminal methylation area
The second zone is in the C-terminal side of the MCP signal domain from heptads
C13 to C14. The E. coli Tsr sequence in this region is (3.3)A, where again, the
highlighted residue is an experimentally confirmed methylation site (Rice and
Dahlquist 1991). This region also has high identity with the Rlv3841 consensus,
(3.3)B. And the McrA, McrB and McrC protein sequences are (3.3)C. Where residues
are highlighted to match the E. coli methylation residue.

3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 67
Again, these sequences seem close enough to be active in Rlv3841. There are
also some discrepancies with this region: IcpA and HemAT are missing the EQ
methylation site and RL1386 and RL1447 again have poor alignment in this area.
This means that only IcpA is missing all of the E and Q methylation residues.
And despite diverging from the main chemoreceptor consensus, McrA, McrB and
McrC have all of the methylation residues.
CheR/CheB binding motif
In addition to the methylation motifs, CheR and CheB methylation and demethy-
lation efficiency can be increased through binding on the flexible C-terminus of
the chemoreceptor. The binding in E. coli and S. meliloti was found to match the
(3.4)A and B motifs respectively. Or, in general (3.4)C (Alexander and Zhulin 2007;
Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007). In Rlv3841, the consensus is (3.4)D and is found
in a number of membrane-bound (McpD, McpE, McpG, McpK, McpM, McpT and
McpX) and cytoplasmic chemoreceptors (McpQ and McpY2).

3.7 Rlv3841 chemoreceptor classification
The Rlv3841 chemoreceptors were also individually analysed based on relation-
ships determined in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of chemoreceptor
sequences (Figure 3.6) and putative functions determined by analysis of their sensor
domains. Gene images were taken from CDvist analysis with grey boxes indicating
transmembrane domains and red outlines indicating tentative annotations (>60%)
(Adebali, Ortega and Zhulin 2015). The results are summarised in Table 3.2.
68 3.7. Rlv3841 chemoreceptor classification
Figure 3.7: McpN domain structure.
3.7.1 Short-chain carboxylate sensing
The phylogenetic tree indicates that McpN (RL3931) is closely related to S. meliloti
McpV (Figure 3.6), confirmed with a sensor domain alignment (67.5% amino acid
identity). The annotated sCache2 domain is a single Cache domain based on the
original calcium channels and chemotaxis receptor based domain which has been
found to bind amino acids and small carbohydrates (Anantharaman and Aravind
2000) (Figure 3.7). Searching the McpN sCache2 domain on the RCSB protein
data bank showed 56% identity with generic Cache chemosensory domain binding
carboxylic acids and 35-49% identity to various other chemoreceptors binding small
carbohydrates (Berman 2000). Indeed, the closely related S. meliloti McpV was
found to sense short-chain carboxylates (including acetate, propionate, pyruvate,
glycolate, formate and acetoacetate) (Compton et al. 2018). In addition, S. meliloti
McpV was linked to Che1 due to localisation to cell poles and was found in high
abundance in the cell (Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia et al. 2017).
3.7.2 Oxygen, redox or light sensors
The phylogenetic tree indicates that McpQ (RL4387) and McpY2 (pRL120068)
are clustered with S. meliloti McpY (Figure 3.6), confirmed by a sensor domain
alignment (70.6% and 60.5% identity respectively; McpG and McpS were also
clustered on the phylogenetic tree but had greatly divergent sensor domains). S.
meliloti McpY has an unknown role, with very low abundance detected in the

cell, although with 30-40% residual expression in alfalfa nodules. Thus, it was
hypothesised to play a role in planta and to be linked to Che1 due to its localisation
to cell poles (Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia et al. 2017). The proteins are all of
topology type IVa, meaning that they are soluble receptors binding intracellular
signals (Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova 2017). In particular, the PAS domains
found in each protein are known to bind a number of cofactors: haem to detect
oxygen, FAD to detect redox potential, or FMN to detect light (Mglich and
Moffat 2007; Collins, Lacal and Ottemann 2014) (Figure 3.8). Searching the
sensor domains on the RCSB protein data bank showed 25% and 32% identity
with an FAD-binding redox sensor and, 28% and 32% identity with FMN-binding
photosensor for McpQ and McpY2 respectively (Berman 2000). McpY2 is also
found adjacent to a flgLKE operon on pRL12.
3.7.3 Other haem binding proteins
IcpA (RL0685) and HemAT (RL0429) are both soluble receptors of topology type
IVa containing a protoglobin domain, known for haem binding (Figure 3.9). This
domain was originally described in aerotactic Bacillus subtilis HemAT which
binds haem in its sensor domain (residues 1-178) via residues Tyr-70 and His-123
70 3.7. Rlv3841 chemoreceptor classification
(corresponding to Tyr-41 and His-94 in model) (Hou et al. 2001; Zhang, Olson and
Phillips 2005). The haem has two distinct O2 binding components with a biphasic
pattern (1-2 M and 50-100 M components). As a result of having both high- and
low-affinity components, HemAT can respond to oxygen concentration gradients
under both hypoxic (0-10 M) and aerobic (50-250 M) conditions (Zhang, Olson
and Phillips 2005). In addition to the binding residues, Tyr-70, Trp-132 and Tyr-133
were found to have a conformational change on ligand binding important for signal
propagation (El-Mashtoly et al. 2008). HemAT (originally annotated McpH) has
methylation residues, the haem binding residues (Tyr-46 and His-99) and signal
propagation residues (Trp-108 and Tyr-109), it also has a 21.9% identity (45.3%
positive identity) over the binding region. IcpA (originally annotated HemAT), on
the other hand, is missing both haem binding residues (Glu-107 and Phe-54) and
one of the signal propagation residues (Trp-116 matches but His-117), finally having
less identity with B. subtilis HemAT (17.9% with 36.4% positive identity).
IcpA correlates better with S. meliloti IcpA. In addition, the phylogenetic
tree indicates that S. meliloti IcpA is more closely related to IcpA (Figure 3.6),
confirmed with a sensor domain alignment (58.9% identity). S. meliloti IcpA has
an unknown role, with low abundance detected in the cell, but is likely linked to
the Che1 cluster, being found in the che1 operon in both species and, despite
being soluble, due to its localisation to cell poles (Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia
et al. 2017). A deletion mutant displayed a significant change in halo size on
Bromfield agar, although the target of the sensor is currently unknown (Sourjik
and Schmitt 1996; Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007).
3.7.4 Quaternary ammonium compound sensing
The phylogenetic tree indicates that McpX (RL0426) is closely related to S. meliloti
McpX (Figure 3.6), confirmed with a sensor domain alignment (67.4% identity)
(Figure 3.10). As mentioned above, proteins with Cache domains are known to
bind amino acids and small carbohydrates, indeed a search on the RCSB protein
data bank showed 25% identity with small carbohydrate binding chemoreceptors
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 71

(Berman 2000). Although found in low abundance in the cell, S. meliloti McpX is
likely linked to the Che1 cluster, due to localisation to the cell poles and a deletion
mutant having a significant change in halo size on Bromfield agar (Sourjik and
Schmitt 1996; Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007; Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia et
al. 2017). It was also found to sense quaternary ammonium compounds (exuded by
plant seeds and roots), including choline and betaines (Webb et al. 2017b). The
binding pocket is composed of a number of aromatics (including Trp-109, Tyr-139,
Phe-153 and Trp-161) and carboxylate binding residues (Ala-179, Gly-180, Asp-208),
all of which are conserved in McpX (Shrestha et al. 2018).
3.7.5 Plant related sensors
The phylogenetic tree indicates that McpT is closely related to S. meliloti McpT
(Figure 3.6), confirmed with a periplasmic region alignment (55.0% identity). S.

Figure 3.11: McpT domain structure.
meliloti McpT has an unknown role, being nearly undetectable in the cell, although
having 30-40% residual expression in alfalfa nodules. Thus, it was hypothesised
to play a role in planta and to be linked to Che1 due to its localisation to cell
poles (Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia et al. 2017). In addition to a predicted
TM at 180-200, S. meliloti McpT had non-significant hydrophobic residues at 1-20
(matching McpT architecture), potentially representing a modified transmembrane
(TM) domain (Krogh et al. 2001) (Figure 3.11). The sensor domain for both
proteins remains unidentified.
3.7.6 Putative organic acid sensing
McpB (pRL120683) is predicted to have an HBM domain, a 6 alpha helix bundle
(Lacal et al. 2010a; Ortega and Krell 2014) (Figure 3.12). This domain was
characterised in a Pseudomonas putida chemoreceptor, McpS. McpS was found
to bind organic acids from the TCA cycle but has only 21.5% identity to the

McpB domain. In addition, none of the required residues for ligand binding were
conserved in McpB. This diverged sensor domain was found to be important in R.
leguminosarum biovar viciae VF39SM where the nearly identical (>98% identity)
McpB mutant had greatly reduced nodule competitiveness on Pisum sativum (Yost,
Rochepeau and Hynes 1998).
3.7.7 Four-helix bundle sensor domains
Chemoreceptors with the 4HB_MCP_1 domain include McpC (pRL120312), McpG
(pRL100403) and McpL (RL1065) (Figure 3.13). 4HB_MCP_1 is a 4 alpha helix
bundle sensor domain with no known targets. The only other information known
about these is that the equivalent chemoreceptor to McpC in R. leguminosarum
biovar viciae VF39SM had greatly reduced nodule competitiveness on Pisum sativum
against the wildtype (>98% identity) (Yost, Rochepeau and Hynes 1998). The
domain architecture seems standard in McpC, but McpG and McpL are missing the
second TM domain. They both have nonsignificant hydrophobic residue clusters
(at 200-220 and 180-200 respectively) that may indicate a modified TM domain
(Krogh et al. 2001).
3.7.8 Dual Cache sensor domains
Chemoreceptors with the dCache1 domain include McpM (RL1318) and McpO
(RL3985) (Figure 3.14). This dual Cache domain is based off the original calcium
74 3.7. Rlv3841 chemoreceptor classification

Figure 3.14: McpM and McpO domain structure.
channels and chemotaxis receptor based domain that is known to bind amino acids
and small carbohydrates (Anantharaman and Aravind 2000). Searching the RCSB
protein data bank for both dCache1 domains showed 30% identity with receptors
binding small carbohydrates for McpM (Berman 2000). The domain architecture is
standard for McpM, but McpO is missing the second TM domain. It again has a
nonsignificant hydrophobic residue cluster (at 360-390, before first HAMP domain),
that may indicate a modified TM domain (Krogh et al. 2001).
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 75
Figure 3.15: McpJ and McpS domain structure.
3.7.9 Single Cache sensor domains
Chemoreceptors with the sCache2 domain include McpJ (RL0949) and McpS
(pRL80031) (Figure 3.15). This single Cache domain is also based on the original
calcium channels and chemotaxis receptor based domain that is known to bind
amino acids and small carbohydrates (Anantharaman and Aravind 2000). Searching
the RCSB protein data bank for both sCache2 domains showed 30-32% identity of
McpS with a number of receptors binding small carbohydrates and 30% identity
with generic Cache chemosensory domain binding carboxylic acids (Berman 2000).
The domain architecture is standard for both proteins.
3.7.10 CHASE sensor domain
The sole chemoreceptor in Rlv3841 with the CHASE3 domain is McpK (RL0972)
(Figure 3.16). This domain was characterised from Cyclases/Histidine kinases
Associated Sensory Extracellular and is speculated to bind small peptides (Mougel
and Zhulin 2001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 McpN has been found to

The CHASE3 domain of McpK has 15.9% identity with P. aeruginosa PAO1 McpN.

3.7.11 Che2-linked relatives
A related group of chemoreceptors, McrA (RL4031), McrB (RL4032) and McrC
(RL4033) are all found within the che2 operon and have high identity (Figure 3.17).
These proteins are distinct from the other Rlv3841 chemoreceptors (Figure 3.6),
being in the 34-heptad class (Alexander and Zhulin 2007). Although also found in
its che2 operon, S. meliloti McpS is phylogenetically distinct and in the 40-heptad
class (Figure 3.6). It is, however, independent of other S. meliloti chemoreceptors,
being evenly distributed throughout the cell, not maximally expressed during mid-
exponential phase and appears inactive during normal chemotactic movement. It is
hypothesised to be involved in plant-related chemosensing with an unknown sensor
domain (Meier, Muschler and Scharf 2007; Meier and Scharf 2009). McrA, McrB
and McrC, on the other hand, have the four-helix bundle sensor domain, described
above to have no known targets. However, they are likely to be involved with the
Che2 chemotaxis cluster, with the duplication allowing divergence of function.
3.7.12 >200 bp unknown sensor domains
Although the phylogenetic tree indicates that S. meliloti McpZ is more closely
related to McpI (RL0758) (Figure 3.6), the periplasmic region of S. meliloti McpZ
was better aligned with McpZ (RL0757; 36.7% identity), with McpI showing high
differentiation with low identity (12.3%). Another chemoreceptor, McpP (RL4277)
also had higher identity (24.1%). Indeed, the domain architecture of McpI is highly
differentiated from S. meliloti McpZ, consisting of a short, merged Cache domain
with three TM domains (Figure 3.18). S. meliloti McpZ, McpZ and McpP, on the
other hand, have a long unannotated sensor domain. An additional complication,
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 77

S. meliloti McpZ and McpZ have only a single TM domain, indicating the sensor
domain is located inside the cell (Krogh et al. 2001). These proteins fit topology
type IIIc, mostly found in archaea (Salah Ud-Din and Roujeinikova 2017). Although
S. meliloti McpZ was detected at a very low abundance in the cell and has an
unknown sensor domain, it is likely linked to the Che1 cluster due to localisation
to cell poles (Meier and Scharf 2009; Zatakia et al. 2017).
3.7.13 <200 bp unknown sensor domains
These chemoreceptors have no significant domain hits across their predicted sensor
domains and include McpD (RL2683), McpE (RL0564) and McpR (pRL120056)
(Figure 3.19). The proteins have poor alignment between their periplasmic domains,
likely indicating different sensor domains. McpR is located near a flgLKE operon
on pRL12. McpE appeared growth defective under 1% and 21% oxygen on both
glucose and succinate in the INSeq data.

3.7.14 No sensor domains
The final two proteins, RL1386 and RL1447, are both unannotated and do not
match the typical chemoreceptor architecture (Figure 3.20). They mainly consist
of the MCP signal domain with no sensor or transmembrane domains. They
may be of topology type IVb, perhaps holding a regulatory role (Salah Ud-Din
and Roujeinikova 2017).
3.8 Testing of internal chemoreceptors as candi-
dates for starvation response
Since the starvation response was discovered for multiple compounds important for
internal metabolism, global control is unlikely to be due to an externally sensing
chemoreceptor. In addition, since S. meliloti Rm2011 did not display this starvation
effect (Figure 3.1), this response is unlikely to be due to chemoreceptors that are
closely related to S. meliloti chemoreceptors. Therefore, this only leaves HemAT,
which is an internal receptor divergent from IcpA and S. meliloti IcpA. We also
decided to study the other internal chemoreceptors (McpQ, McpY2 and IcpA) to
find conditions in which they are active.
80 3.8. Testing of internal chemoreceptors as candidates for starvation response
We obtained three strains with Tn5 mutations in these genes from Allan Downies
laboratory (John Innes Centre): A1296 (mcpQ), A1300 (mcpY2 ) and A1289
(hemAT ). To make sure the Tn5 mutation was unique, they were transduced back
into Rlv3841, producing the strains OPS1881, OPS1505 and OPS1500, respectively.
The position of the Tn5 transposon in these strains was also confirmed by sequencing
upstream and downstream genome fragments amplified using primers oxp2649+Tn5,
oxp2660+Tn5 and oxp2646+Tn5, respectively (listed in Table 2.3).
To isolate a strain mutated in icpA, a double crossover mutation was isolated
using a pK19mobSacB strategy, as described in Section 2.5.2, producing plasmid
pOPS1411. After the first single crossover, the integration was mapped using
primers oxp3917+oxp3918. A double crossover was isolated on 10% sucrose and the
deletion of icpA was confirmed by PCR mapping using primers oxp4057+oxp4058
and sequencing the amplified fragments. This strain was named OPS2108 (icpA).
Finally, to isolate a double mutation of hemAT and icpA, the hemAT Tn5
mutation was transduced into the icpA deletion strain (OPS2108). The Tn5
transposon insertion was confirmed with PCR as above. This strain was named
OPS2288 (icpA and Tn5 hemAT ).
These mutants were tested in swimming plates under a wide range of minimal
media conditions. Firstly, on a variety of carbon sources together with the wildtype
and the che1 mutant as controls (Figure 3.21). These included glucose (10 mM vs 1
mM), succinate (20 mM vs 2 mM), malate (20 mM vs 2 mM), fumarate (20 mM vs
2 mM), pyruvate (30 mM vs 3 mM), arabinose (10 mM vs 1 mM), acetate (30 mM
vs 5 mM), with NH4Cl (10 mM) as nitrogen source in all conditions. The strain
and media factors were all found to be significant, so all the strains were compared
within each media condition at high and low concentrations. At low concentration,
only the icpA mutant was significantly reduced on all the conditions tested except
acetate. At high concentration, the icpA and hemAT mutants were reduced on
glucose and the icpA mutant on arabinose. Across all media conditions, the mcpQ
and mcpY2 mutants were not significantly different from wildtype.

Next, the strains were tested under different nitrogen sources (10 mM vs 0.5 mM

significant, so the strains were compared within each media condition at high and low
concentrations. These nitrogen conditions had a similar pattern to the high glucose
above, with the icpA and hemAT mutants having significantly reduced diameters
in all conditions tested, but with no effect from the mcpQ and mcpY2 mutations.
The strains were also tested in high glucose (10 mM), high pyruvate (30 mM)
and low pyruvate (3 mM) minimal media supplemented with NH4Cl (10 mM) under
light and dark conditions (Figure 3.23). In this assay, there was no observed effect
due to the light level. Only the strain and media factors were found to be significant,
without interactions, indicating that the strain effect does not differ across media

conditions. This effect was found to be significant for the icpA mutant.
Finally, the strains were tested at 21% and 1% oxygen with different carbon
sources (high glucose (10 mM), high succinate (20 mM), low succinate (2 mM),
high arabinose (10 mM) and low arabinose (10 mM)) (Figure 3.24). The strain and
media factors were all found to be significant, so the strains were compared within
each media condition at high and low oxygen tension. The icpA mutant was found
to be significantly reduced under all the conditions tested except for high succinate
at 21% oxygen and high glucose at 1% oxygen. Comparing to previous results, the
icpA mutant was expected to be significantly reduced at high glucose and not at
high succinate at 1% oxygen. However, under both conditions, the icpA mutant
displayed the highest variance, indicating that these results perhaps need more
84 3.8. Testing of internal chemoreceptors as candidates for starvation response
replicates for a more robust response. Indeed, the icpA and hemAT double mutant
matched the reduction under all conditions except that it was significantly reduced
in high glucose and not at high succinate with 1% oxygen. The hemAT mutant
displays some interesting differences between the 21% and 1% oxygen conditions.
It was found to be significantly reduced in only high glucose and arabinose at 21%
oxygen. However, at 1% oxygen, it was also found to be reduced in low succinate and
arabinose. This effect of hemAT deletion appears to occur as an interaction of low
carbon and low oxygen tension. Once again, the mcpQ and mcpY2 mutants were
not found to be significantly different to wildtype under any of the conditions tested.
Overall, none of the mutants displayed the effects expected for a sensor driving
the TCA-cycle intermediate response, as they did not show an increased swimming
diameter under high succinate, malate or fumarate. This confirms the hypothesis
that the effect is chemotaxis and chemoreceptor independent and that another
regulatory mechanism might be responsible.
The broad impact of the icpA deletion may indicate that this chemoreceptor is
a general sensor of the metabolic state. Especially considering it was significantly
reduced on nearly every media condition where the che1 mutant was also reduced.
Without the sensor encoded by icpA, the cell is unable to sense how unfavourable
certain carbon sources are. This effect also appears robust to changing oxygen
tension, indicating independence from oxygen sensing. This was expected, since
the protein appears unable to bind haem (Section 3.7.3).
The action of the sensor encoded by hemAT appears to be more restricted.
In general, it appears to be active at high carbon source concentration, with
fairly low robustness. But at low carbon concentration, it only appears active
when also at low oxygen tension. This indicates some level of oxygen sensing,
as predicted in Section 3.7.3. But how can we explain the interaction effects?
Well, at high carbon concentration, the cell is expected to have a high level of
oxygen consumption. Whereas under low carbon concentration, the metabolism
only has a significant impact on internal oxygen tension when already at low oxygen.
An oxygen sensor would consider both conditions to be unfavourable, and so a

mutant in such a sensor would have reduced swimming diameters under those
conditions and therefore, it would also be reduced in high carbon and only in
low carbon when grown at low oxygen.
It may also be expected that low nitrogen conditions would reduce oxygen
consumption. However, under these conditions, the hemAT mutant was significantly
reduced at 21% oxygen. This may be explained by the different relevance of the
nitrogen effect vs the carbon effect. Whenever nitrogen effects on swimming were
tested, they had a smaller effect than carbon. For example, wildtype swimming
diameter increases from about 43 mm at 10 mM glucose by 30% to 56 mm at 1
mM glucose (Figure 3.21). In contrast, from about 49 mm at 10 mM ammonium
by 12% to 55 mm at 0.5 mM ammonium (Figure 3.22). It may be that 0.5 mM
ammonium is insufficiently nitrogen starved to see a great enough reduction in
metabolism to abolish the hemAT response.
The mcpQ and mcpY2 mutants were not significantly reduced from wildtype
under any media conditions tested. This may indicate some degree of redundancy
between the two receptors. Indeed, they do share sensor domains, as mentioned
above (Section 3.7.2, Figure 3.8).
3.9 Discussion
In this chapter, we first described the swimming characteristics of two rhizobial
strains: Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) and Sinorhizobium
meliloti Rm2011 (Sme2011). Both strains displayed a starvation response: increased
halo diameter in low carbon concentrations and small, thick halos in high carbon
concentrations (Figure 3.1). For Rlv3841, the most obvious effects were with
acetate and succinate. High acetate produced tiny, faint halos which are likely
due to very little growth. High succinate produced a different halo type, small
and thick as above, but with a cloudy spots appearance. This appears to be
a response to high succinate, that triggers a non-motile state. We were also
able to further investigate the succinate effect, finding the same effect for other
dicarboxylic acid TCA-cycle intermediates such as malate and fumarate (Figure
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 87
3.3). Interestingly, this response to succinate appears to be novel and characteristic
of R. leguminosarum, as Sme2011 did not show the same response.
What, then, is the biological purpose of the TCA-cycle intermediate effect?
The most obvious possibility is that it is simply an extension of the starvation
effect. Increasing the concentration of a carbon source causes a reduction in
swimming diameter. Starvation responses in bacteria tend to control the tumble
frequency of flagella to increase the time spent in high energy environments. Perhaps
high TCA-cycle intermediates are a more favourable environment than any other
high carbon source, such as sugars (e.g. glucose and arabinose) or TCA-cycle
precursors (e.g. pyruvate). This is supported by the fact that the low succinate
media produces the same sized halos as the high glucose media. However, this
does not explain the distinct shape of the halos produced in high TCA-cycle
intermediate media, so an alternative mechanism might be interacting with flagella
to completely stop swimming.
We have demonstrated that deletions of key flagellar genes (motA, fliG and flaA)
and chemotaxis gene clusters (che1 and che2 ) were able to disrupt the swimming
ability of Rlv3841 as expected (Figures 3.2, 3.3). We also confirmed the major role
of Che1 in chemotaxis, with only minor effects discovered for Che2 (Miller et al.
2007). Interestingly, although the flagellar gene mutants no longer displayed the
TCA-cycle intermediate effect, the chemotaxis gene cluster mutants still did. Since
the glucose, pyruvate and arabinose starvation effects are removed by che1 deletion,
it is unlikely that the TCA-cycle intermediate effect is produced by the che1 cluster.
If not chemotaxis, another possible explanation could involve metabolism. If so,
then it is possible that the swimming plates are confounded by the requirement for
growth to be visible. In order to remove this possibility, we also tracked individual
bacteria swimming in liquid cultures grown in both high and low succinate (Figure
3.5). Both wildtype and che1 mutants displayed a significantly reduced motile
cell fraction in high succinate media. This confirms that the high succinate media
directly affects the motility of cells. In addition, the swimming speed and tumble rate
of the bacteria were also reduced in high succinate. Whether these modifications to
88 3.9. Discussion
swimming parameters are also due to the same mechanism is unclear. It is possible
that the reductions in swimming speed shift the distribution of cells, such that
there are an increased number of non-motile cells.
To further demonstrate the independence of the TCA-cycle intermediate effect
from the effect of the chemotactic machinery, we investigated the chemosensory
array of Rlv3841 (Figure 3.6). Rlv3841 has 25 chemoreceptors, with a wide variety
of sensory domains and phylogenetic diversity. At this stage, we were interested
in a potential link to metabolism, so the internally sensing chemoreceptors were
chosen for further analysis. These included PAS-domain sensing McpQ and McpY2,
and protoglobin-domain sensing IcpA and HemAT (Sections 3.7.2, 3.7.3). After
generating the corresponding mutants, none of these chemoreceptors were found
to alter the high succinate, malate or fumarate responses. McpQ and McpY2 are
likely redundant, since they are highly similar and single mutants did not find
any effects. IcpA was found to be important under a wide range of conditions,
indicating that it may be a general sensor of metabolic state. HemAT appears to
be an oxygen sensor, being important under conditions of high oxygen consumption
or low oxygen tension. Thus, the response does not appear to be connected to
any internally sensing chemoreceptor.
So what about a metabolic link? A literature search revealed one instance of
metabolism being necessary for flagellar function. In gutted Escherichia coli cells,
flagellar switching was only recovered with the addition of CheY and either fumarate,
malate or succinate (Barak and Eisenbach 1992; Barak, Giebel and Eisenbach 1996).
CheY alone causes a single CCW to CW rotation switch, with no further changes.
The cause appears to be reducing the free energy of switching by fumarate reductase
preferentially binding and stabilising CW rotation (Prasad, Caplan and Eisenbach
1998; Koganitsky et al. 2019). Although this appears superficially similar to the
effect found in Rlv3841, there are several important differences. Firstly, although in
E. coli CW rotation corresponds to a tumble, in Rlv3841, it is responsible for forward
movement (Miller et al. 2007). Rlv3841 is also unable to change the direction
of flagellar rotation. This means that any stabilisation of flagellar would likely
3. A model of sensory taxis in Rhizobium leguminosarum 89
have minimal effect on the swimming behaviour of Rlv3841. Secondly, Rlv3841
does not have a fumarate reductase. Although it does have a related enzyme,
succinate dehydrogenase, this enzyme was found to not have the same effect in E.
coli (Koganitsky et al. 2019). Finally, fumarate reductase appears to only affect
flagellar switching and is unlikely to trigger a non-motile state. However, there
are also other descriptions of metabolism effects on swimming.
The interaction of metabolism with chemotaxis has only recently been accepted.
The standard model has been metabolism-independent chemotaxis, due to initial
descriptions of bacterial response to non-metabolizable compounds (Adler 1969).
More recently, metabolism-dependent chemotaxis has been described (Alexandre and
Zhulin 2001). This involves interactions between metabolic and chemotactic mecha-
nisms. The authors of a modelling paper describe a third option: metabolism-based
taxis, ostensibly invented to allow simulations of metabolism-dependent chemotaxis
without modelling chemotaxis (Egbert, Barandiaran and di Paolo 2010). However,
this mechanism appears similar to that proposed by the TCA-cycle intermediate
effect: chemotaxis-independent but metabolism-dependent control of flagella. This
mechanism is surprisingly powerful: it alone can produce movement up gradients of
metabolizable compounds, down those of metabolism suppressors, switching between
response modes based on metabolic state and finding spatial distributions that
maximise combinations of metabolite gradients (Egbert, Barandiaran and di Paolo
2010). If this is the basis of the TCA-cycle-intermediate-response, the mechanism
is a powerful addition to chemotaxis for more nuanced environment selection.
If, however, the response mechanism is not linked to chemotaxis, it is possible
that its biological purpose is not for metabolically-favourable environment selection.
Another explanation for the response comes from the environment within the host
plant. During symbiosis, the bacteria are housed within nodule structures, in which
the bacteria are fed malate and succinate (Prell and Poole 2006). One of the clear
transitions that occurs to bacteria within nodules is the down-regulation of motility.
Perhaps the signal for this transition comes from the TCA-cycle intermediates.
90 3.9. Discussion
If this is the case, it is likely to be linked to a global metabolism control system.
One candidate for such a system is the phospho-transfer system (PTS). This system
has been shown to be linked to chemotaxis in E. coli and to transcriptionally inhibit
motility in Vibrio fischeri (Lengeler et al. 1981; Visick et al. 2007). In Rlv3841, the
PTS system has both carbon and nitrogen regulatory networks that regulate the
bacterial response to environmental conditions. Analysis of links from this system
to chemotaxis and testing it as a candidate mechanism behind the TCA-cycle
intermediate response is discussed in the following chapter (Section 4).
Regulation of motility under starvation
conditions
4.1 Introduction
Energy taxis encompasses all systems used to alter swimming direction in response to
metabolically necessary compounds. Also called metabolism-dependent chemotaxis,
it includes aerotaxis, phototaxis, redox taxis, taxis to alternative electron acceptors,
and chemotaxis to carbon sources (Taylor, Zhulin and Johnson 1999). For example,
in Azospirillum brasilense, cells are strongly attracted to organic acids and sugars
(malate, succinate; fructose, galactose), but this attraction is abolished in the
presence of high amounts of their carbon storage polymer (polyhydroxybutyrate)
(Alexandre, Greer and Zhulin 2000). In addition, the strength of attraction was
correlated with the efficiency of growth the bacteria have on that attractant, such
that TCA cycle intermediates had a stronger attraction than sugars and amino acids
(Alexandre, Greer and Zhulin 2000). However, among all these varieties of energy
taxis, they all transmit motility signals rapidly through the chemotaxis system or
generationally through transcriptional control of flagella synthesis (Taylor, Zhulin
and Johnson 1999; Alexandre and Zhulin 2001; Visick et al. 2007; Schweinitzer
and Josenhans 2010). Both of these systems are important during the swim plate
assay timescales of 4-7 days.
92 4.1. Introduction
Another option has been described theoretically: metabolism-based chemotaxis
in which metabolic enzymes interact directly with the motility machinery (Egbert,
Barandiaran and di Paolo 2010). This may describe the TCA cycle intermediate
halting effect that we discovered (see Chapter 3): chemotaxis-independent, but
metabolism-dependent modulation of motility. Although it is theoretically suggested
that metabolism-based chemotaxis alone can produce a variety of complex behaviours
(movement up gradients of metabolizable compounds, down those of metabolism
suppressors, switching between response modes based on metabolic state and
finding spatial distributions that maximise combinations of metabolite gradients),
this would depend on the granularity of the response offered by the Rlv3841 TCA
cycle intermediate halting effect. Thus far, the effect appears to be discrete: off
and enabling swimming at 2 mM succinate, but on with disabled swimming at
20 mM succinate.
To further probe the responsiveness of the TCA-cycle intermediate halting effect
and to find the system/s responsible, we performed the following experiments.
Firstly, the swimming reaction to a gradient of concentrations of various carbon
sources, including a TCA-cycle intermediate, were characterised. Secondly, the
swimming behaviour of the phosphotransferase system (PTS; described in Section
1.8) mutants from both the ManX and PtsN branches were characterised to
determine if they were linked to the TCA-cycle intermediate effect. Finally, 9
mutants that did not display the TCA-cycle intermediate effect were isolated
from papillations formed from wildtype Rlv3841 inoculated in swimming plates.
These mutants were sequenced, enabling the identification of two distinct classes of
mutations that block the TCA-cycle intermediate effect. All these mutants were
characterised for swimming behaviour under various conditions and complemented
with native systems.
4. Regulation of motility under starvation conditions 93
4.2 Characterisation of chemotaxis-independent
but metabolism-based taxis
We began the investigation into the TCA-cycle intermediate swimming effect by
characterising the behaviour of key mutants across varying concentrations of the
relevant carbon sources in minimal media (Figure 4.1). The strains chosen were the
wildtype strain, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841); a motile
chemotaxis system 1 mutant, che1 (LM100); a motile chemotaxis system 2 mutant,
che2 (LM400); and finally, a non-motile flagellar mutant, fliG (OPS2163). The
carbon sources chosen were glucose, which feeds into glycolysis; pyruvate, which is
one reaction away from the TCA cycle; and succinate, a TCA cycle intermediate.
Firstly, Rlv3841 and the che2 mutant tended to form larger halos than the
che1 mutant and larger still than the non-motile fliG mutant. This was expected
due to the che1 operon being responsible for the majority of the chemotactic
response, with the che2 operon having only a minor role under these conditions.
The non-motile fliG mutant behaved as expected.
Rlv3841 displayed similar responses to those recorded in Chapter 3, glucose was
found to have a 20% reduction and pyruvate a 30% reduction in swimming halo
diameter with increasing solute concentration. For both of these carbon sources,
the halos appeared with solid, circular morphology for all motile strains (Figure
4.1B, C, E and F). These reductions appear to be linked to the Che1 chemotaxis
system, judging by the absence of a change in the che1 mutant. Interestingly, the
succinate results again show an entirely different trend. Rlv3841 was found to have
a 70% reduction in swimming halo diameter with increasing concentration and at
high succinate concentrations, the halos were small, with cloudy spots morphology
(Figure 4.1D and G). We predicted that the cloudy spots morphology is caused by
a halting of motility at high succinate. The morphology could be formed by a two-
stage process, firstly, the bacteria consume the succinate after inoculation, eventually
releasing motility control, enabling some cells to travel out to uncolonised areas.
Once there, the bacteria again sense high succinate and halt, producing a new spot.
94 4.2. Characterisation of chemotaxis-independent but metabolism-based taxis
In addition, the intermediate concentrations show a transition from clearly
distinct strain halos at low concentrations, to indistinguishable at high concen-
trations. Indeed, at 30 mM succinate, the wildtype behaves as if non-motile and
non-chemotactic. A critical observation is that, while che1 mutants have reduced
movement relative to wildtype at low succinate, they still respond with reduced
motility to high succinate. This indicates that there is a mechanism for motility
control that is independent of che1 and che2.
One possible mechanism is transcriptional control through ActSR. High concen-
trations of succinate would drive the TCA cycle, pushing high amounts of reductant
through the ETC that would enable the activation of ActSR which could in turn
inhibit motility through possible transcriptional inhibition of flagellar synthesis.
Additionally, high flux through the ETC would produce a strong proton motive
force which could have an impact on the operation of the flagellar motor.
Since the swimming plates display only overall colony reactions to media
conditions, we also imaged the bacteria to track individual behaviour. The motile
fraction was unchanged in high and low glucose (Figure 4.2A), reduced by 15%
in high pyruvate (Figure 4.3A) and reduced by 30% in high succinate (Figure
4.4A). This correlates with the relative reductions in halo diameters on plates
for each carbon source. This agrees with the hypothesis that high levels of TCA
cycle intermediate halt the bacteria.
The swimming speeds were similarly affected, with no change between high and
low concentrations of glucose and pyruvate (Figures 4.2B and 4.3B), but with an
overall reduction in swimming speed at high succinate (Figure 4.4B). These speeds
were calculated as overall mean swimming speed, including tumbles. Although
the reduction in swimming speed is likely related to the TCA cycle intermediate
response, since it still occurs in che1 mutants, it cannot explain the entire effect.
There is a clear separation between the slow swimmers and the halted bacteria.
The tumble rates also followed a similar pattern, with no difference between high
and low glucose (Figure 4.2B), but significant differences were detected between
high and low pyruvate and succinate (Figures 4.3B and 4.4B). The mutant strains,

however, behave differently. Deletion of the che1 operon results in a significant
reduction in tumbles and removes the difference between high and low succinate
concentrations. This indicates that the tumble change in the wildtype is due to
chemotaxis and thus cannot be responsible for the reduced swimming.
4.3 The TCA-cycle intermediate halting effect is
specific to R. leguminosarum
A variety of soil bacteria were tested for their swimming response to high and low
succinate. These included Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae VF39 (RlvVF39),
Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli 4292 (Rlp4292), Sinorhizobium meliloti
RCR2011, Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm2011 str3 (Sme2011), Sinorhizobium meliloti
1021 (Sme1021), Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571, Azospirillum brasilense FP2,
Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656 (Kos).
Of these, the small, cloudy spots morphology was observed only in the various
biovars of Rhizobium leguminosarum (Figure 4.5). The restriction to a single species
indicates that it may be an adaptation to symbiosis with particular legumes or
particular soils that the Rhizobium leguminosarum strains were isolated from.
4.4 Testing of PTS as a candidate for the halting
response
As mentioned previously (Section 3), the phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a
global metabolic control system that regulates bacterial responses to environmental
conditions. The system has been shown to be linked to chemotaxis in E. coli and
to transcriptionally inhibit motility in Vibrio fischeri (Lengeler et al. 1981; Visick
et al. 2007). In Rlv3841, the PTS system has both carbon and nitrogen regulatory
networks that regulate the bacterial response to environmental conditions. We
thus chose to test the system as a candidate mechanism behind the TCA-cycle
intermediate halting effect. Since the ManX branch of the PTS is typically involved
with carbon metabolism, it was investigated first.

Interestingly, there was a clear link to halo size, with themanX mutant displaying
significantly smaller halos than wildtype on all media tested. This was complemented
by the non-phosphorylatable mutant (H9A) version of ManX (ManX*), but not by
the phosphomimic version (H9D; ManX*P) (Figure 4.6. These results, however, may
be compounded by the known growth defect of manX, which may be the cause of
the smaller halos (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020). Importantly, the manX mutant
still displays the TCA-cycle intermediate halting response, formed the typical small,
cloudy spots morphology halos on high succinate plates. The ManX branch can
thus be ruled out as being the direct cause of the halting.
The other branch of the PTS, PtsN, is typically associated with nitrogen
metabolism. To test the swimming response to various nitrogen sources, washed
agar was used to remove excess nitrogen (Section 4.7.4). Similar results were found

as above, with the ptsN1 mutant displaying significantly smaller halos than wildtype,
but, in reverse to ManX, being complemented by the phosphomimic (H66D; PtsN*P)
and only partially by the non-phosphorylatable protein (H66A; PtsN*). In addition,
since ptsN1 mutants do not have a growth defect, this is good evidence for a
connection between the PTS system and motility (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020).
However, all of these mutants still perform the TCA-cycle intermediate halting
response and thus the PtsN branch also can be ruled out of being the direct cause.
4.5 Mutant isolation screening for TCA-intermediate
swimming control
Since the PTS system does not regulate reduced swimming at high concentrations
of TCA-cycle intermediate, an isolation screen was developed to identify the
controlling system/s. It was noted previously that incubating swimming plates

supplemented with high TCA-intermediate for periods longer than 4 days produced
small papillations, protrusions out from the central halo, presumably caused by
mutations in the control system (see Figure 4.14A top-right side). Fourteen such
mutants were thus isolated to enable screening to find the genetic basis for the
control system (see Section 4.7.1). Of these, 10 displayed wildtype-like swimming
behaviour in glucose media but did not display the TCA-intermediate effect in
high fumarate, malate or succinate media. These 10 were then sequenced, in
addition to the wildtype and an isolate from the centre of one of the halos (see
Section 4.7.2). The sequenced reads were aligned to the wildtype Rlv3841 sequence,
allowing identification of mutations that were not present in the wildtype or the
centre isolate (Table 4.1; see Section 4.7.3).

A total of 69 genes or intergenic regions were found to have at least one SNP or
INDEL in at least one mutant. A number of these regions had multiple SNP/INDELs
per mutant. The high variability of these genes was assumed to be due to sequencing
errors or errors in contig formation due to sequence similarity. This was confirmed
by alignment of individual reads to the contigs in question. These genes were thus
eliminated from further analysis. This left 33 genes and intergenic regions that had
SNP/INDELs confirmed by read analysis (listed in Table 4.1).
Within these genes, a clear pattern was observed: half of the mutants had
mutations in one gene and the other half all had mutations in another, separate
cluster (Table 4.2). The gene RL3464 had SNPs observed in the mutants OPS2237,
OPS2238, OPS2294 and OPS2298. RL3464 encodes a putative SAM-dependent

methyltransferase of unknown function.
The second cluster of mutations were observed in the genes RL0540-7. The gene
RL0542 had an INDEL observed in the mutant OPS2300 (22 bp inserted). The next
gene RL0543 had INDELs observed in the mutants OPS2290 (1 bp deleted) and
OPS2300 (52 bp deleted). The final gene RL0545 had SNPs observed in the mutants
OPS2292, OPS2295 and OPS2297. These genes encode a system for inorganic
phosphate uptake that is active under low phosphate conditions. The genes RL0542-5
produce an ABC transporter for inorganic phosphate uptake. Specifically, RL0542 is
pstS, a periplasmic inorganic phosphate binding protein; RL0543 is pstC, an integral
membrane protein forming the ABC transporter with RL0544, pstA; finally, RL0545
is pstB, the ABC subunit ATP binding protein (Yuan, Zaheer and Finan 2006).

confirmed all mutations (Figure 4.8). In-frame deletion mutants of each cluster
were attempted to be isolated following the methods used previously, however,
neither were successful from 40 colonies screened.

grew exponentially in high phosphate (500 M) media and so the mean generation
time was calculated and compared. However, in low phosphate (50 M), the strains
grew linearly and so the slope of that growth was compared. None of the phosphate
uptake mutants grew significantly differently to wildtype except for OPS2292, which
was significantly slower growing under both conditions (Figure 4.9). OPS2292
has a large nonsense mutation (truncating half of the protein) in pstB, the ATP
binding protein of the ABC transporter, so would be expected to have greatly
reduced phosphate uptake. Interestingly, OPS2300, which has a 52 bp deletion
with frame-shift, leaving only 27 amino acids intact of pstC, an integral part of the
ABC transporter, had no growth defects, despite also likely having greatly reduced
phosphate uptake. This may mean that the disrupted uptake of phosphate by the
pstSCAB system is compensated by other phosphate uptake systems but that the
major mutation in OPS2292 has an additional toxic effect.

4.5.1 Swimming responses of the two classes of mutation
The swimming behaviour of the papillation isolates was tested on varying concen-
trations of carbon sources (glucose and succinate) and other nutrients (ammonium
and phosphate). Washed agar was again used to remove excess nutrients. The
limiting phosphate conditions of the low ammonium media with washed agar
were confirmed with the activation of alkaline phosphatase fused to GFP (using
strain RU1235). Wildtype Rlv3841 again displayed increased swimming on low
concentrations of carbon sources compared to high concentrations (Figure 4.10).
In addition, at high succinate, there were significant increases in swimming with
reduced concentrations of both phosphate (23% increase) and ammonium (42%
increase). In contrast, at low succinate, there was only a significant increase with
reduced concentrations of ammonium (27% increase).
The swimming behaviour of the papillation isolates were tested on the same
4. Regulation of motility under starvation conditions 109
media conditions as above, varying concentrations of carbon sources (glucose and
succinate) and other nutrients (ammonium and phosphate) (Figure 4.11). The
diameters were then compared to the wildtype within each media condition, with
significance differences noted by asterisks.
Firstly, with high concentrations of succinate as the carbon source, and with
high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate, the strains behaved as expected,
with the papillation isolates displaying increased halo diameters compared to
the wildtype (60-70% for the phosphate uptake mutants and 90-130% for the
methyltransferase mutants). In low ammonium and low phosphate media conditions,
though the differences were reduced (30-90% increases over wildtype), the papillation
isolates were all significantly larger than wildtype. This indicates that TCA-cycle
intermediate halting response does not also require high nitrogen or high phosphate
conditions. This is also further evidence that the phosphate uptake mutations
are not altering the transporter functionality.
In low succinate media, the strains were again larger than wildtype with
about 20% increases for phosphate uptake mutants and 20-50% increases for
methyltransferase mutants. Moving to the low phosphate media conditions, the
pattern was similar to on high succinate, with increases in the wildtype diameter
causing the increase of the mutants to be lessened, although still larger than wildtype.
The low ammonium media, however, displayed a different pattern, with the wildtype
diameter increasing to the level of the phosphate uptake mutants. Since the low
succinate media has only a mild halting effect, the increased swimming due to low
ammonium was sufficient to overcome the difference.
Both the high and low glucose media displayed similar results. Although many
of the mutants displayed significant differences to the wildtype, there were roughly
equal numbers larger and smaller. The largest differences were an increase of 27% on
high glucose and 14% on low glucose media by different methyltransferase mutants.
Thus, in general, the papillation isolates only have increased swimming in the
presence of TCA-cycle intermediates. This suggests that the effect of the mutations
is limited to the halting effect and not flagella-based swimming in general.
110 4.5. Mutant isolation screening for TCA-intermediate swimming control
One common thread throughout the media conditions is that the methyltrans-
ferase mutants tend to have a more dramatic increase in halo diameter than the
phosphate uptake mutants. This may indicate that the methyltransferase is more
directly linked to the TCA-cycle halting effect such that mutations more effectively
prevent the halting of swimming.
The papillation mutants were also tracked as before, swimming in minimal
media at high and low succinate concentrations (Figure 4.12). In general, it appears
that the mutants had an increased motile fraction over the wildtype, as large as 20
percentage points on high succinate, although only three strains were significant due
to high variance (Figure 4.12A). Similarly, in the tumble rate data there was high
variance, but the general trend of an increase in tumble rate for the methyltransferase
mutant (Figure 4.12B). Overall, the swimming speed was reduced in high succinate
(Figure 4.12C). These results support the hypothesis that the mutations cause
an increase in motile fraction by preventing the halting of swimming caused by
sensing of high TCA-cycle intermediates.
Next, the isolates were complemented using a Tn7 integration system to integrate
the entire operon, with native promoters, in which their respective mutation
was found. In addition, a constitutively active promoter was fused to both the
wildtype and a mutant (OPS2294) methyltransferase and integrated into each
methyltransferase mutant and the wildtype. As a control, a blank Tn7 was also
integrated into each mutant.
We first determined the swimming behaviour of these strains on high succinate
(Figure 4.13). As before, the non-integrated mutants (plain) all had significantly
larger halos than the wildtype. The negative controls (empty Tn7 integrated)
behaved similarly to the non-integrated mutants, with large, standard halos. The
native complementation recovered the wildtype halo diameters, being reduced
in all of the mutants. Native complementation also recovered the cloudy spots
morphology, although increased frequency of papillations on the complemented
halos was noted (Figure 4.14F and G).

The constitutively expressed wildtype methyltransferase gene also reduced the
halo diameter in cognate mutants to that of the wildtype. However, although the
smaller halo size was restored by constitutive complementation, the morphology
was not. The halos were two-layered, with a small, possibly non-motile centre,
surrounded by an outer halo (Figure 4.14I). Although the two layers suggests
suppressor mutations, the outer halo appears too uniform and thick to be a secondary
mutation of the type that caused the papillations. Interestingly, the constitutive
expression of the wildtype methyltransferase gene in the wildtype strain produced
even smaller halos than the unmodified wildtype. These halos were the size and
morphology of non-motile mutants (Figure 4.14H). Thus, the constitutive levels
of methyltransferase produces the same behaviour at 20 mM as wildtype levels
do at 30 mM succinate (see Figure 4.1).
Constitutive expression of the mutant methyltransferase gene L115H (mutation
in strain OPS2294) did reduce the size of the halos in cognate mutants, but they
were all still significantly larger than those in wildtype. Overexpressing the mutant
methyltransferase gene is thus insufficient to completely overcome the mutations.
This is consistent with the mutations in the methyltransferase impairing its function,
although perhaps not completely abolishing its function.
Three of the complemented mutants (OPS2294, OPS2297 and OPS2298) were
also tracked as before, swimming in minimal media at high and low succinate
concentrations (Figure 4.15). The high variance in motile fraction again make
it difficult to interpret, but the general pattern is an increase of motile fraction
in the mutants that is unchanged in the negative integration and reduced to
wildtype levels with native complementation (Figure 4.15A). For tumble rate,
the two methyltransferase mutants (5 and 8) were significantly increased over
wildtype in low succinate conditions that was reduced to wildtype levels with native
complementation (Figure 4.15B). There were no differences between strains in the
swimming speed, so it was not included in the figure for clarity.

4.6 Discussion
In this chapter, we first described the swimming behaviour of Rhizobium legumi-
nosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) wildtype, chemotaxis and flagellar mutants in
varying concentrations of carbon sources. As in the previous chapter, the TCA-cycle
intermediate halting effect was found to independent of both chemotaxis system,
occurring in the che1 and che2 mutants (Figure 4.1. All three strains displayed
the reduction in swimming halo starting at 5 mM succinate until 30 mM where
they were the same size as the non-motile strain. At intermediate concentrations,
the halos displayed cloudy spots, indicating halting behaviour that is dynamically
responsive to the current succinate concentration. We then proceeded to investigate
the phospho-transferase system (PTS) as a candidate controlling system.
Although both the ManX and PtsN branches appeared to alter motility, mutants

in both branches still displayed the halting effect (Figure 4.6 and 4.7), suggest-
ing that PTS is not responsible for this effect. The manX mutant displayed
reduced swimming behaviour in each media condition and was complemented
by a non-phosphorylatable version of the protein (H9A; ManX*) but not by
the phospho-mimic version (H9D; ManX*P). In contrast, although the ptsN1
mutant also displayed reduced swimming behaviour in each media condition, it
was complemented by the phospho-mimic version of the protein (H66D; PtsN*P),
but not by the non-phosphorylatable version (H66A; PtsN*). Since both proteins
tend to be phosphorylated under the same conditions, this indicates a branching
control of motility. Both proteins tend to be phosphorylated under nitrogen
limitation and carbon excess, and not phosphorylated under nitrogen excess and
carbon limitation (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020). So under nitrogen limitation,
perhaps PtsN-P stimulates motility, whereas in carbon limitation, ManX stimulates
motility. In summary, PTS effects appear to be separate from the high succinate
restriction in motility.
We then isolated mutants that no longer displayed the TCA-cycle intermediate
halting effect by recovering bacteria from papillations formed by the wildtype in
swimming plates containing a high concentration of fumarate (20 mM). Sequencing
9 of these mutants along with the wildtype and a neutral isolate revealed two
general types of mutation: mutants in a putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase
(RL3464) and mutants in an ABC transporter for inorganic phosphate uptake
(pstSCAB, RL0542-5). Both types of mutants were found to abolish the cloudy
spots morphology in high TCA-cycle intermediate media and cause increased halo
diameters (Figure 4.14B and C and Figure 4.11). In addition, the mutants tended
to have an increased motile fraction at high succinate over the wildtype (Figure
4.12A). Finally, these effects were restored to wildtype by complementation with
the native operons, again forming small, cloudy halos with papillations in high
succinate media (Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14F and G).
118 4.6. Discussion
4.6.1 The phosphate transporter PstSCAB
Rhizobium leguminosarum encodes four phosphate transporters: pit1 (RL0857),
pit2 (pRL100343), phoCDET (RL0170, RL0168-6) and pstSCAB (RL0542-5). In E.
coli, the PstSCAB system has two orders of magnitude higher affinity for inorganic
phosphate than Pit, but is induced only in phosphate limiting conditions, being
inhibited by >1 mM phosphate (Rosenberg, Gerdes and Chegwidden 1977). In
Sinorhizobium meliloti and S. fredii, the Pit transporter is also low affinity and is
unnecessary for symbiosis, whereas the PhoCDET and PstSCAB transporters are
high affinity and, although coredundant, are together necessary for effective symbiosis
and fixation (Yuan, Zaheer and Finan 2006; Hu et al. 2018). In addition, the
PstSCAB transporter is associated with the two-component system PhoRB in both
E. coli and S. meliloti. Under limiting phosphate conditions, PstSCAB transports
phosphate, the linker protein PhoU is dissociated and PhoRB is active (Makino et
al. 1989; Hsieh and Wanner 2010; diCenzo et al. 2017) (Figure 4.16). Under excess
phosphate conditions, PhoU binds both the transporter to reduce transport and
PhoR to prevent phosphorylation of PhoB. When phosphorylated, PhoB transmits
the phosphate limitation signal by activating and repressing a wide range of genes
through binding of a Pho box motif (Krol and Becker 2004). Interestingly, many
basal body and motor genes were downregulated in limiting phosphate but this
appeared to be independent of PhoB (Krol and Becker 2004). In contrast, in Vibrio
cholerae, PhoB regulates acgAB which encodes c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes which
in turn positively regulate motility (Pratt, McDonough and Camilli 2009).
In S. meliloti Rm2011, the effect of PhoB is only active under limiting phosphate
conditions. Interestingly, in the related S. meliloti Rm1021, PhoB is active even
under excess phosphate conditions. This strain has a 1 bp insertion in the pstC gene,
causing a frame-shift that presumably alters the conformation of the transporter
such that PhoU cannot be activated as normal under excess phosphate conditions
(Krol and Becker 2004; Yuan, Zaheer and Finan 2006). This matches two of the
mutations observed in the papillation isolates, both having deletions in pstC causing
frame-shift. Together with the SNP found in pstB, the mutants are unlikely to

component system. Model proposed by diCenzo et al. (2017) from Sinorhizobium

activation of PhoB. Reproduced from diCenzo et al. (2017).
effect global phosphate uptake (only one had a growth defect in low phosphate
as shown in Figure 4.9), instead they may change the activity of PhoB via PhoU
in a similar way to Rm1021 such that PhoB is constitutively phosphorylated and
active. If so, it could be expected that the halting effect would also be avoided in
the wildtype under phosphate limiting conditions, which would also cause increased
activity of PhoB. This was, however, not the case, with only a minor, though
significant, increase in wildtype halo diameter under phosphate limitation (Figure
4.11). The effect of these mutations is thus likely to be through an unknown
independent regulatory role of some part of the system, perhaps the PhoU protein.
Alternatively, a constitutively active PhoB-P may be a more potent activator of
motility than when PhoB is phosphorylated transiently in low phosphate agar.
Presumably as cells move through the agar to new reserves of phosphate, PhoB may
be dephosphorylated and only phosphorylated when the phosphate is consumed.
To determine how many of these effects are active in Rlv3841, mutants in the
relevant genes could be made. Firstly, a deletion of the entire pstSCAB operon or
one of the integral genes, could be used to check co-redundancy with PhoCDET and
determine if growth defects are expected with loss of PstSCAB function. Secondly,
120 4.6. Discussion
a deletion of phoU would be expected to produce a strain with constitutively
active PhoB and PstSCAB. If constitutive PhoB is indeed responsible for the loss
of the halting effect in the mutants with pstC mutations, then this strain would
again be expected to not halt under high TCA cycle intermediate concentration.
Phosphorylation of PhoB is via an aspartate residue, causing a steric change in
the effector domain, activating the protein (Bachhawat, Swapna and Stock 2005).
Thus it would be difficult to produce a phosphomimic mutant of PhoB, since
phosphomimic versions usually substitute an aspartate for a native residue. Finally,
a deletion of phoB itself could influence the substrate specificity or concentration
sensitivity of the halting effect, if PhoB is indeed a negative regulator of the effect.
4.6.2 Methyltransferase
In contrast to PstSCAB, nearly nothing is known about the protein encoded by
RL3464 except its Pfam classification as a putative (S)-Adenosyl-L-methionine
(SAM)-dependent methyltransferase and its shared operon with lgt (RL3463), a
putative prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase. Mutations in the gene, which
presumably alter the function of the translated protein, prevented the TCA-cycle
intermediate halting effect. A particularly dramatic confirmation of this was
constitutive expression of the gene in wildtype cells causing a non-motile phenotype.
Its classification as a methyltransferase suggests a possible connection with
the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). MCPs are chemoreceptors
that are methylated by CheR, ultimately to increase phosphorylation of CheY
in response to higher levels of stimuli and thus increase tumbles through slowing
flagella rotation (see Section 1.5). Together with demethylation by CheB, the two
proteins control adaptation to stimulus concentration. Methylation of these receptors
by the methyltransferase encoded by RL3464 could then also cause increased
phosphorylation of CheY and slowed flagella rotation, perhaps to the point of halting
through constitutive phosphorylation of CheY. However, the methyltransferase
encoded by RL3464 had low identity across the methyltransferase domain (<40%)
to both CheR1 and CheR2 and did not contain the response regulator domain
4. Regulation of motility under starvation conditions 121
found in both CheRs. In addition, both the che1 and che2 operon deletions and
the che1,2 double deletion still displayed the halting effect (Figures 4.1 and 3.3).
Thus, it is expected that the methyltransferase has a different regulatory role,
somehow being linked to motility, perhaps post-translationally via the flagella
motor or transcriptionally via VisNR.
To determine conclusively if the halting effect is through post-translational
control of flagella or transcriptional down-regulation, the flagella could be stained
and counted under high and low TCA-cycle intermediates to check for loss of flagella.
In addition, a culture growing in low succinate conditions could be shocked with
high succinate and their swimming tracked immediately afterwards to determine
the kinetics of halting. If the change can occur within a few minutes, then it is
highly unlikely to be transcriptional control, which would be expected to occur
via dilution from cell division, thus taking several hours.
Bioinformatic analysis of relatives of the methyltransferase encoded by RL3464
allowed construction of a phylogenetic tree (Figure 4.17). The tree grouped
methyltransferases from various Rhizobium strains together, each with >92% amino
acid identity with the methyltransferase from Rlv3841. Another clade was formed of
methyltransferases from various Sinorhizobium strains, each with about 70% identity
with the methyltransferase from Rlv3841. The various other methyltransferases had
50% or less identity with the methyltransferase from Rlv3841. The lack of halting
effect in Rm2011 is thus possibly due to differences in the methyltransferase protein
function. Another explanation is that Rm2011 is missing or contains altered versions
of downstream elements that are responsible for causing the halting. Expression of
the Rlv3841 RL3464 gene in Rm2011 could reveal which is the caseif the strain
displays halting, then it is likely to be changes in the methyltransferase that are
important, if not, then there are likely to be other altered elements.
Future experiments could discover downstream elements or confirm connections
between the methyltransferase and the candidate protein targets proposed above,
revealing which of the scenarios is accurate. Firstly, RL3464 could be expressed
in an E. coli or Rlv3841 vector to produce tagged, purified protein that could be

used in cell lysate pull-downs as a binding screen. These pull-downs could also
determine if any methylation is detected on any of the targets via mass spectrometry.
Secondly, more focused two-hybrid assays could find if any of the proposed binding
interactions occur. If any methylation targets are discovered, further experiments
could determine the kinetics of the reaction under different conditions, to see if the
methyltransferase somehow responds to TCA cycle intermediates directly (Dorgan
et al. 2006; Ibez et al. 2010). In addition, cross-complementation with the
native PstSCAB operon could reveal if the two systems are linked together or
acting independently. If the expression of the methyltransferase gene is somehow
influenced by PstB, then complementation of the methyltransferase in the phosphate

uptake mutants may recover halting by recovering a sufficient level of expression
of the methyltransferase gene.
4.7 Methods
4.7.1 Random mutagenesis screening
Mixed colonies of Rlv3841 were inoculated into the centre of semi-sold agar UMS
media plates supplemented with 20 mM fumarate and 10 mM ammonium (as per
Section 2.7.3). The plates were incubated for 11 days at 28C until papillations
extended out of the inner halos were formed. Bacteria were isolated from one
papillation per plate and double colony purified on TY agar plates. These isolates
were then stocked at -80C as OPS2236, OPS2237, OPS2238, OPS2290, OPS2291,
OPS2292, OPS2293, OPS2294, OPS2295, OPS2296, OPS2297, OPS2298, OPS2299
and OPS2300. An additional isolate was taken from the centre of one of the
halos and stocked as OPS2301.
4.7.2 Whole genome sequencing
Single colonies of Rlv3841, OPS2236, OPS2237, OPS2238, OPS2290, OPS2292,
OPS2294, OPS2295, OPS2297, OPS2298, OPS2300 and OPS2301 were individually
resuspended in 100 L sterile TY. These were streaked out on TY agar plates to
form a lawn of bacteria on 1/3 of the plate and streaked further across the rest of
the plates. The plates were incubated for three days at 28C. After confirming the
absence of colony impurities in the streaks, the bacterial cultures were removed
with sterile loops into the barcoded bead tubes supplied by MicrobesNG. The
tubes were sealed, mixed by inverting 10 times and sent at room temperature
to MicrobesNG for sequencing.
4.7.3 SNP analysis
Contigs from the strains sequenced above (Section 4.7.2) were aligned against the
genome of Rlv3841 (NCBI:txid216596) and mutations (both Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Insertion/Deletions (INDELs)) were detected using

4.7.4 Agar washing
Agar was washed to remove excess nutrients by mixing with 0.5 M NaCl to form a
slurry. The slurry was then centrifuged at 4,500 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant
was discarded, replaced with washing solution and shaken at 10,000 rpm for 1
minute. This was repeated 3 times with water and 2 times with distilled water.
After the final centrifugation, the pellet was dried overnight at 50 C. The absorbed
water was estimated at 5x weight by weighing the agar before and after washing.
Thus 1.1% of washed agar was equivalent to 0.22% agar.
Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis
5.1 Introduction
As described in Chapter 1, insertion sequencing (INSeq) is a technique that indicates
the relative importance of all genes in a genome by generating a library of transposon
mutants which ideally saturates the transposon insertion sites in the genome. These
mutants are each disrupted in a single gene or area in the genome, and so increases
and reductions in their relative abundance indicate the importance of the disrupted
region (Perry and Yost 2014; Perry, Akter and Yost 2016).
This technique has been used in our laboratory over the last few years to
characterise the genes involved in growth under different carbon sources and oxygen
tensions (Wheatley et al. 2016), and more recently, to identify the genes involved
in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis (Wheatley et al. 2020). This last INSeq
experiment was conducted for rhizosphere, root colonised and nodule bacteria, and
differentiated nodule bacteroids. Our reference strain Rhizobium leguminosarum
biovar viciae 3841 was used as model rhizobia and the base for the transposon
library, and the pea plant Pisum sativum was used as the model plant and symbiosis
partner. For this project, the set of genes related to chemotaxis and motility was
analysed across all the experimental conditions. As explained in this chapter, our
analysis found that bacterial strains mutated in chemotaxis and motility genes
126 5.2. Analysis of chemotaxis and motility genes in insertion sequencing data
tended to be neutral for recovery in the rhizosphere and on the root, yet with a
highly reduced presence in the nodule. This unexpected lack of importance in the
rhizosphere and on the root is likely due to experimental conditions, as discussed
below, since chemotaxis and motility has long been shown to be important in these
environments (Scharf, Hynes and Alexandre 2016; Kawasaki et al. 2016). After
these two stages, the role of chemotaxis and motility has not been well-characterised,
therefore, in this work we carried out a broader analysis of these two systems across
all the stages of the symbiotic process.
To examine all the stages more closely, we used the chemotaxis and motility
mutants previously isolated (Chapter 3). These mutants were marked with different
reporter genes that allowed us to design experiments able to monitor our cells
thanks to assays based on fluorescence, luminescence and enzymatic activity. This
enabled us to examine the effects of the mutants on root attachment, colonisation,
initiation of symbiosis and nodule development.
5.2 Analysis of chemotaxis and motility genes in
insertion sequencing data
Once the INSeq experiment was conducted in our laboratory and the sequence reads
were obtained, we carried out the data processing and analysis of the chemotaxis
and motility genes (methods described in Section 5.11.1). Of the 93 genes with
putative roles in chemotaxis and motility (Chapter 1), 39 are required for nodule
formation and function and for 11, their mutation is advantageous for nodule
bacteria (Table A.1, Figure 5.1).
The majority of the genes required for the flagellar assembly and basal body
apparatus are important in nodules and essential for the two types of rhizobial cells
they harbour: undifferentiated nodule bacteria and bacteroids (Table A.1, Figure
5.1). The gene encoding the critical motor protein FliG (RL0700) is neutral across
all stages of symbiosis. In contrast, the gene encoding an interacting integral motor
protein MotA (RL0703) is required in nodule bacteria and bacteroids. Interestingly,
these strains are expected to be flagellated differently, with mutants in the gene

encoding FliG likely producing non-flagellated strains whereas mutants in the gene
encoding MotA likely form non-rotating flagella. In addition, the genes encoding
the master flagella and chemotaxis regulator pair, VisNR (RL0696  RL0697),
are required in nodule bacteria and bacteroids, although when examined in detail,
the C-terminal GerE-encoding domain of visN displays a dramatic increase in
transposon insertions, suggesting its deletion does not impair VisN function and
may even enhance it. A number of flagellar biosynthesis-encoding genes required in
nodule bacteria are not essential in the rhizosphere and for root colonization, or
their mutation is even advantageous. Non-motile bacteria may become stranded in
the rhizosphere or on the root surface, unable to continue to symbiosis.
In the case of the chemotaxis systems, each of the individual genes in the
che1 cluster (RL0686-93) are required only for nodule bacteria and differentiated
bacteroids (Table A.1, Figure 5.1). However, this cluster was not essential at the
initial stages for optimal colonisation of the rhizosphere or pea plant roots. This
suggests that, under these experimental conditions, the Che1 system is required at
128 5.2. Analysis of chemotaxis and motility genes in insertion sequencing data
a later stage of symbiosis, either for chemotaxis specifically to root hairs or early
progression into infection threads. An experimental investigation of the initiation
of symbiosis at the root hairs and its progression was subsequently performed
and described in Section 5.6.
Mutations in all the genes present in the che2 cluster (RL4028-36) are advan-
tageous for undifferentiated nodule bacteria. While the reason is not known, we
speculate that the che2 gene cluster is involved in the later stages of bacterial
movement through infection threads. A mutation which delays progression from
infection threads to differentiated bacteroids would result in their over-representation
in the nodule bacteria library. Experimental investigations into the impact of
chemotaxis mutants on nodule development and on the abundances of nodule
bacteria and bacteroids in mature nodules are described in Sections 5.8 and
5.9 respectively.
Overall, this analysis suggests that under our experimental conditions, motility
and chemotaxis are not essential for colonisation of the root surface, but may have
a particularly important role in the nodule infection pathway. While emphasising
a very important role for motility and chemotaxis towards root hairs or, possibly,
progression down infection threads, it does not preclude a more general role in the
environment. The INSeq library was inoculated from a frozen culture at stationary
phase (likely non-motile) onto sterile vermiculite-grown plants. However, bacterial
growth in soil takes place in competition with a complex, motile microbiome.
Therefore, the soil environment is likely to impose different motility and chemotaxis
selection upon the bacteria, with loss of chemotaxis and motility likely to be
catastrophic for long-term survival in soil and root colonization (Turnbull et al.
2001; Zheng et al. 2015). Experimental investigations into the impact of chemotaxis
and motility mutants on attachment and colonisation are described in Sections
5.4 and 5.5 respectively.
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 129
5.3 Generation of marked strains to monitor rhi-
zobia across different symbiotic stages
Chemotaxis and motility mutants from Chapter 3 were marked with different
bioreporter genes to enable various experimental techniques targeted at different
stages of the symbiosis cycle (Figure 1.1). Luminescence was used to count cells on
plant roots and to identify sites of high promoter activity, testing attraction and
communication stages (Sections 5.4 and 5.6). Fluorescence was used to count cells
and differentiate by strain and cell-type using flow cytometry, testing colonisation,
infection thread and nodulation stages (Sections 5.5 and 5.9). Finally, enzyme
activity staining was used in competition experiments to distinguish strains in
nodules and individually to assay nodule maturation (Sections 5.7 and 5.8).
Constitutive luminescence was achieved through the pIJ11282 plasmid, which
contains the lux gene cluster under a constitutive pNeo promoter (Frederix et al.
2014). This plasmid had been previously conjugated into wildtype Rlv3841 (named
D5250). In this work, we additionally conjugated the plasmid into the che1 mutant
LM100 (named OPS2335), the che2 mutant LM400 (OPS2337) and themotAmutant
OPS2107 (OPS2338). To assess the importance of the motility and chemotaxis
systems at the first stages in symbiosis, we also used the pLMB712 plasmid,
which contains the lux cluster under the promoter of the Rlv3841 nodABC operon
(pRL100185-7). This promoter is activated by flavonoids produced by pea plant
roots at infection zones (Pini et al. 2017). Again, this plasmid had been previously
conjugated into wildtype Rlv3841 (named strain LMB612) and we conjugated it into
the che1 mutant LM100 (named OPS2139) and the che2 mutant LM400 (OPS2141).
Strains were fluorescently marked with Tn7 that integrates the transposon after
the glmS gene (Choi and Schweizer 2006). Each strain was marked with sYFP (Kre-
mers et al. 2006), mCherry (Shaner et al. 2004) and sfGFP (Pedelacq et al. 2006)
all under a constitutive J23104 promoter (through plasmids pOPS0860, pOPS0856
and pOPS0858 respectively). The following strains were generated in this work:

To carry out enzymatic activity staining, two marker genes were used: gusA
(encoding a -glucuronidase that turns magenta with Magenta-GlcA) and celB
(thermostable -galactosidase that turns blue with X-Gal) (See Section 2.8.6)
(Snchez-Caizares and Palacios 2013). Genes were integrated with Tn7 as above,
under a constitutive J23104 promoter. We isolated integrants of gusA using plasmid
pOPS0857 into Rlv3841 wildtype (named OPS1896), the che1 mutant LM100
(OPS1871), the che2 mutant LM400 (OPS1873) and the motA mutant OPS2106
(OPS2267). Additionally, a celB integration mutant using the plasmid pOPS1376
was integrated on the Rlv3841 wildtype (OPS2085) for comparison.
5.4 Chemotaxis mutants but not motility mutants
are impaired in initial attachment
The first stage of symbiosis tested was the early attachment phase. For this
experiment, pea roots were incubated in a liquid suspension of constitutively
luminescent bacteria (Section 5.11.2). After an hour of incubation, the roots
were imaged to count the total luminescence due to bacteria attached to roots.

are mean  SD, with samples as points, N=5.
Afterwards, bacteria from each inoculant were grown on swimming plates to confirm
their motility phenotypes. A strong effect in this experiment was expected to cascade
to following stages. Although, since this stage is the only one experimentally tested
with bacteria suspended in liquid, there may be some differences in the magnitude
of the effect, compared to later experiments.
Analysis of the luminescence of the attached cell fraction revealed significant
reductions by 3-4 orders of magnitude for the motile che1, che1,2 and che2 mutants
compared to wildtype, whereas there were no significant differences found for the
non-motile motA and fliG mutants (Figure 5.2). This indicates that the Che, but
not motility, systems are essential for attachment of rhizobia to plant roots in liquid.
The possible reasons for this apparent contradiction are discussed below (Section
5.10). To check the effects of these mutants on competitive, long-term attachment
on roots, we next investigated root colonisation.
132 5.5. Motility and chemotaxis are important for root colonisation
5.5 Motility and chemotaxis are important for
root colonisation
To efficiently determine the competitive effect of chemotaxis and motility on root
colonisation, we used flow cytometry (Section 5.11.7). We first tested the number
of particles detected per mL of OD600 = 1 liquid cultures for both the wildtype and
che1 mutant. The results are shown in Figure 5.3A. On average, wildtype marked
with sYFP and mCherry, and che1 marked with mCherry appear to be about
5 108. However, che1 marked with sYFP was found to be significantly higher at
about 1  109. Due to these differences, we decided to perform the experiments
with both combinations, to average over any individual fluorescence differences.
We then conducted competition experiments using the wildtype marked with
sYFP against wildtype marked with mCherry. Pre-germinated pea seeds were
grown in boiling tubes with sterile vermiculite and the plants were subsequently
inoculated with an equal mixture of both strains and harvested at different times
after inoculation (1, 3, 5 and 7 days) (Section 5.11.3). Watering around the roots
was standardised to allow a fair comparison of the contributions of motility to
colonization. The fluorescent bacteria present on the root at harvest time were
then collected and counted using flow cytometry (Figure 5.3B). The results did
not show any effect due to the different fluorescent markers used in the study,
indicating that the strains behave equally. However, there was a clear increase in
bacterial population up to 5 days post inoculation. Thus, this day was chosen for
the comparison experiments as the point at which the population reaches maximal
capacity but just before the population decline.
With the experimental conditions defined, we then competed the wildtype
against itself and the che1, che12, che2, motA, fliG and flaA mutants as sYFP vs
mCherry-tagged strains and vice versa (Figure 5.4). The wildtype data are mirrored
for better comparison to the mirrored competitions against the test strains.
There were significant competitive disadvantages for all mutant strains relative
to the wildtype. Notably, the che1 mutant had the greatest reduction (by 76%),
followed by motA and fliG (by 50% and 55% respectively). Although it is unclear if

134 5.6. Chemotaxis is involved in symbiosis initiation
the differences between the mutants are significant, it is unlikely to be directly due
to motility differences since then the motA strain would be most disadvantaged,
combining the high energy cost of flagella synthesis without the advantages of
swimming. This is especially important in this experiment as it is testing bacterial
movement towards the plant roots. To test this directly, future experiments could
compete che1 against non-motile strains. Either way, it is interesting that both
the non-chemotactic and non-motile results seemingly contradict the INSeq root
colonisation results where, as seen previously, che1 was shown to be a neutral
mutation. The INSeq experimental conditions may have masked the colonisation
and attachment effects because the INSeq library inoculated onto plants contained
bacteria in a non-motile state. Alternatively, the above INSeq may not have
been sensitive enough to detect these reductions, given that a later barcoded
INSeq experiment with higher sensitivity did find that chemotaxis and motility
are important for colonisation.
As for the other strains, both the che12 and flaA mutants showed a high
variance in the growth of the plants (Figure 5.4). Even so, they both had significant
reductions of 17% and 31% respectively. These seems to be driven by a subset of
the samples, in which more extreme reductions were found. These samples may be
a better representation of the underlying relationship, and indeed for flaA they had
larger total cell counts. The final strain, the che2 mutant, had a small reduction
of 27%, although the starting ratios were not as balanced as for the other strains.
This imbalance may have resulted in the reduction for this case.
Overall, both the motility and chemotaxis systems have shown to be important
for competitive colonisation of pea roots. Then, once the bacteria have arrived
at and colonised the root, they still have to reach the root hair tips to initiate
symbiosis. In the next section, we describe testing the initiation stage.
5.6 Chemotaxis is involved in symbiosis initiation
The effect of chemotaxis on symbiosis initiation was tested with a time course
experiment for nodulation dynamics conducted with the wildtype and the che1 and

the plant Vicia villosa (hairy vetch). The plants were grown as described in Sections
2.8.2 and 2.8.4. During this experiment, nodule initiation events (visualised as spikes
of luminescence) were recorded together with the eventual physical appearance of
nodules on the roots. These spikes of luminescence were caused by the activation of
the Rlv3841 nodABC promoter by the flavonoids produced by the plant at the onset
of the symbiosis to communicate with their symbiotic partner. The timing of the
appearance of each nodule, together with the corresponding spike of luminescence
were analysed both separately and paired together.

to later transition into nodules. Significant reductions were found for the motA and
fliG mutants compared to wildtype, being on average half a day earlier, whereas
there were no significant differences found for the che1, che1,2 and che2 mutants.
These differences may be due to earlier detection of the flavonoid signal by the
motA and fliG mutants, or more likely, are simply due to plant variation. The
nodule distributions showed the reverse pattern, with significant increases found
for the motA and fliG mutants, again by half a day, with no significant differences
for the other mutants 5.5B).
To check the early development timings of the strains, the time between initiation
and nodule appearance for each nodule was calculated. The nodule development
distributions (Figure 5.5C) of the che1, che1,2, motA and fliG mutants were
significantly increased over the wildtype, on average half to a full day later. In
contrast, the che2 mutant was not significantly different to wildtype. This indicates
that removing motility or the main chemotaxis system delays nodule initiation.
Since the bacteria are already colonised on the roots when the initial signal is
detected, it is likely that the delay occurs due to movement required to the root
hair tips or down the infection thread.
These results show that there is still some unresolved questions on the ef-
fect of chemotaxis on nodulation. We thus progressed to measuring nodulation
competition directly against the wildtype to determine the ultimate effects of
the chemotaxis mutations.
5.7 Motility and chemotaxis are important for
nodulation
The effects of chemotaxis and motility on nodulation competition was measured
by competing wildtype and the che1, che2 and motA mutants marked with gusA
against celB marked wildtype (Section 5.11.4). The pre-germinated peas were
planted in sterile silver-sand-vermiculite pots and inoculated with this mixture,
then harvested after three weeks and stained to enable nodule counting. The strain
ratio at the nodule stage was then compared to the strain ratio in the inoculant.

All of the che1, che1,2, motA, fliG and flaA mutants showed a significant
reduction in competition compared to wildtype, by 85%, 89%, 88%, 84% and
69% respectively (Figure 5.6). Loss of motility and control of motility is clearly
important across the whole symbiosis cycle. The colonisation data makes clear
that movement along the roots, at least, is an important stage of symbiosis, but
there may be another later stage requiring chemotaxis and motility: movement
to root hair tips. In order to initiate symbiosis, bacteria have to be at the tip
of root hairs (Oldroyd et al. 2011). Although this experiment competes strains
across both stages, they could theoretically be separated by masking the initial
colonisation impact, perhaps by inoculating the strains in a non-motile state. This
could be used to confirm the INSeq results by showing a minimal effect at initial
colonisation, but a large effect on nodulation.
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 139
The che2 cluster mutant did not have a significant reduction in nodule counts
(Figure 5.6). Although che2 displayed reduced early attachment and colonisation
efficiency (Sections 5.4 and 5.5), this had no significant impact on overall nodulation.
Instead, it may be that the che2 cluster has a role in nodule maturation, with
mutants having slower nodule development. This could then cause the increased
count of nodule bacteria found by the INSeq screen (Figure 5.1). To investigate
this, an experiment that surveyed the sizes of nodules formed by wildtype and
chemotaxis mutants was performed in the following section.
5.8 Chemotaxis is important for nodule devel-
opment
The effect of the chemotaxis clusters on nodule development was determined by
measuring the distribution of nodule areas over time (Section 5.11.5). The plants
were inoculated individually with wildtype and chemotaxis mutants che1 and
che2, each marked with constitutively expressed celB to enable staining for nodule
visualisation, and were grown in sterile vermiculite pots and harvested after 2, 3
and 4 weeks. After weighing, staining and photographing the roots, the images
were analysed using a pipeline to produce the area of each nodule for each plant.
The plants displayed no significant differences between the inoculated strains
in weeks 2 and 3, but in week 4, roots of plants harbouring the che2 mutant were
significantly smaller (29% reduction) than wildtype (Figure 5.7A). Indeed, one
of the che2 assigned plants even had yellow leaves, the same shade as the water
controls, despite displaying nodules. Earlier, in week 2, both the che1 and che2
mutants produced significantly less nodules, by about 50%, than the wildtype,
although this was recovered in weeks 3 and 4 (Figure 5.7B). In week 3, the che2
mutant nodules were significantly smaller (19% reduction in average area), although
they had recovered by week 4 (with a non-significant reduction by 7%). In contrast,
the che1 mutant nodules were consistent with the wildtype until week 4, where
they were significantly smaller (15% reduction in average area).

5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 141
For the che1 mutant, the initial drop of nodules is consistent with the nodulation
results (Section 5.7), although the mutant does recover nodule count as a single strain.
Interestingly, the nodule area distribution only lags behind the wildtype after 4 weeks.
The che2 mutant also had an initial drop of nodules compared to the wildtype,
although this recovered in later weeks. The nodule area distribution lagging behind
the wildtype by the 3rd week combined with having no competitive disadvantage
noted with nodulation, indicates that che2 has slower nodule development than the
wildtype (Section 5.7). This is also supported by the defect in plant health by the
4th week, likely due to reduced nitrogen fixation by less mature nodules.
If the che2 cluster is indeed important for nodule maturation, it is expected
that the che2 cluster mutant would have some impact on bacteroid differentiation.
To investigate this, an experiment that measured the amounts of bacteria and
bacteroids in mature nodules formed by each of the strains was performed in
the following section.
5.9 The che2 cluster is important for nodule
maturation
The effect of the chemotaxis clusters on the development of mature nodules was
determined by counting their populations of bacteria and bacteroids (Section 5.11.6).
The plants were inoculated individually in sterile vermiculite pots and harvested
after 3 weeks. The strains used were the wildtype and chemotaxis mutants che1
and che2, each marked with constitutively expressed sfGFP to enable counting in a
flow cytometer. Bacteria were differentiated from bacteroids on the basis of size
and granularity measured as forward and side scatter, respectively.
There was no significant difference between strains for counts of undifferentiated
bacteria per gram of nodule (Figure 5.8A). There was, however, a significant
reduction in the che2 mutant bacteroid counts over wildtype. This also resulted
in a higher proportion of bacteria relative to bacteroids in che2 mutant nodules
(Figure 5.8B). This suggests that the che2 cluster has a role in nodule maturation,
such that mutation causes a reduction in differentiated bacteroids by about 30%.

Indeed, this effect was likely even minimised by the selection of only mature
nodules for the experiment. A clearer understanding of the maturation of che2
nodules can only come from the distribution of bacteria and bacteroid counts
across nodule development. Mature nodules were initially chosen to prevent bias
between strains, indeed, each group of 10 nodules weighed approximately the same
(0.05g). This may, however, have masked the main effect of the che2 cluster, by
removing any impact of a change in the rate of nodule maturation and therefore
in the proportion of mature nodules. Future experiments may investigate this in
more detail by harvesting all nodules and forming a more complete dataset or by
harvesting nodules at different time points.

5.10.1 The che1 cluster, in coordination with flagella, ap-
pears to have a role in attraction to both the root
surface and to root hair tips
We first described the effects of transposon insertions in flagellar and chemotactic
genes based on an INSeq experiment. The majority of flagellar and che1 cluster
genes were found to be neutral in the rhizosphere and in root colonisation, but
essential for nodule bacteria and bacteroids (Figure 5.1). This is likely due to the
library being grown on TY agar without selecting for motility. During the early
stages of colonisation, all strains were likely to be non-motile. So the early effects of
chemotaxis and motility would be masked, allowing later effects to be revealed. This
means that, under the experimental conditions of the INSeq experiment, chemotaxis-
based flagella movement is important for some stage after root colonisation.
To investigate this hypothesis, we first tested the attachment of mutant strains
to pea plant roots. We found a significant reduction in attachment for the motile
che1, che1,2 and che2 mutants but not for the non-motile fliG and motA mutants
(Figure 5.2). This suggests that motility is not important under these conditions but
that disruption to motility via the chemotaxis mutants is highly detrimental. These
results are clearly paradoxical and led us to check the phenotypes in 4 independent
144 5.10. Discussion
experiments. Furthermore, to ensure that the fliG and motA mutants were behaving
as expected, the cultures used for attachment assays were also stabbed into swimming
plates and in all cases the strains were confirmed to be non-motile as expected.
Work in Chapter 4 suggests that the che1 mutant is hyper-motile, having a reduced
tumble rate and thus increased smooth swimming and that the che2 mutant has an
increased tumble rate. Since these modifications to tumble rate are artificialdue to
disruption of the system rather than in response to a signalthe response to signal
gradients were impaired (see Chapter 3). The chemotaxis mutants may be moving
too fast or too erratically to effectively transition to a sessile state upon reaching the
boundary layer at the root surface and thus display reduced attachment. However,
an alternative explanation is that the Che proteins control a cellular factor required
for attachment that is independent of motility. Furthermore, while the che1 and
che2 strains do have the expected swimming phenotypes, they have large deletions
with antibiotic cassettes inserted in the chromosome. These strains were obtained
from the Hynes laboratory and in future work it would be sensible to make new
in-frame deletions in both clusters as well as in individual che genes.
Interestingly, Secchi et al. (2020) recently found that although motility is
important for attachment to surfaces from a slowly flowing fluid, increasing the
fluid flow reduces the effect of motility with the strains becoming indistinguishable
at speeds over 1000 m/s. In addition, they report that the motility advantage
was due to directed movement towards the surface and that cells with disrupted
tumbling, both increased and decreased, had altered attachment. This supports
the idea that uncontrolled swimming is worse for attachment than non-motility. It
might be possible to test this by treating cells with a proton ionophore to dissipate
the transmembrane pH gradient and thus externally stopping motility (Manson et
al. 1977). If the wildtype and mutants attach similarly after this treatment, then
the hyper-motility of the chemotaxis mutants is likely the cause of the reduced
attachment. It does of course raise a separate and interesting question of whether an
energized membrane is needed by cells for attachment. An alternative way to reduce
motility would be to increase the viscosity of the medium by adding a reagent such
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 145
as Ficoll to increase the strength of the root surface boundary effect, potentially
slowing the hyper-motile bacteria sufficiently to allow effective attachment.
Interestingly, previous experiments that inoculated roots with bacteria taken
directly from agar slope cultures (data not shown) produced an order of magnitude
less attachment than the data described above, in which inoculation was from
overnight liquid cultures. It was initially assumed that the differences were due to
most of the cells grown on agar slopes forming biofilms and thus becoming largely
non-motile. However, the genetically non-motile mutants, motA and fliG, grown
in liquid culture displayed the same attachment as wildtype. This is especially
interesting because it is expected that fliG is non-flagellated, whereas motA is
expected for produce non-rotating flagella. This suggests another, alternative
explanation of the results, that the discrepancy is due to exopolysaccharide (EPS)
regulation; EPS is required for rhizobia to form strong attachments to roots and
is necessary for biofilm formation (Janczarek 2011; Wheatley and Poole 2018).
Indeed, EPS and motility are commonly antagonistically regulated by levels of
3,5-cyclic di GMP (c-di-GMP): with low levels of c-di-GMP corresponding to
motility phenotypes and high levels to sessility. For instance, Sinorhizobium meliloti
Rm2011 has c-di-GMP receptors that negatively regulate motility and promote
EPS production (Schaper et al. 2016, 2017). In addition, Rhizobium leguminosarum
biovar viciae UPM791 displayed increased biofilm formation and root attachment
upon overexpression of a gene encoding a c-di-GMP-producing diguanylate cyclase
(pleD) (Perez-Mendoza et al. 2014).
Some bacteria have also been found to have regulatory links back from flagella to
c-di-GMP levels. One of the flagellar stators of Pseudomonas aeruginosa interacts
with the diguanylate cyclase SadC, stimulating activity and repressing motility
(Baker et al. 2019). The flagella of Caulobacter crescentus acts as a sensor,
stimulating the diguanylate cyclase DgcB upon surface-induced motor interference
(Hug et al. 2017). In addition, disruption of its flagellar assembly also stimulates
c-di-GMP levels via PleD for early-stage disruption and through MotAB binding
of DgcB for late-stage disruption (pre-print Hershey, Fiebig and Crosson (2020)).
146 5.10. Discussion
Perhaps the fliG and motA deletions induce a similar kind of system, increasing
c-di-GMP levels which induce EPS production and increase attachment. This
would have to be linked to both the non-rotation of flagella (in motA) and the
absence of flagella (presumably in fliG).
To find the effects of these mutants on competitive, long-term attachment on pea
roots, we next investigated root colonisation. Mutants on che1, motA and fliG all
displayed reduced colonisation in competition against wildtype, although to differing
degrees (76%, 50% and 55% reductions respectively) (Figure 5.4). So whatever
the cause of the attachment discrepancies, they are masked during colonisation,
perhaps due to the longer timescale or competition with wildtype.
However, these results seem to contradict the INSeq results and suggest that
the che1 cluster and flagellar motility are indeed important for competitive root
colonisation. This discrepancy may simply be due to differing experimental
conditions. Although the colonisation experiment used the same inoculation density
(105 CFU per plant), it was carried out with a one-to-one strain competition
compare to the complex mixture of mutants used in the INSeq experiment. Most
importantly the cultures were carefully grown to be at maximum motility before
incubation of roots in a suspension of bacteria.
Competition experiments were also performed at the level of nodulation. This
experiment again showed a significant reduction in nodules formed by che1, che1,2,
motA and fliG mutants, with a higher reduction than for colonisation (85%, 89%,
88% and 84% reductions respectively) (Figure 5.6). The further reduction in
competitiveness may be due to another role of the che1 cluster and flagellar-
based motility in the intervening stages between colonisation and formation of
mature nodules. It is critical that for the nodulation results, INSeq and the work
described here are in agreement.
To probe the intervening stages, our next experiment was designed to allow
investigation into the initiation and development of nodules. The first stage was
visualised using a plasmid containing the genes for light emitting luminescence under
a nodABC operon promoter. This operon is activated by plant-produced flavonoids,
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 147
and so activation of the operon is linked to the earliest stages of infection where plants
boost the synthesis of flavonoids in response to bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharide
(LCO) signals (Pini et al. 2017). The time when a nodule first appeared was
compared to the time at which the luminescence signal was first observed in that
spot to obtain initiation timings. The nodule development distributions of the
che1, che1,2, motA and fliG mutants were shifted significantly longer than the
wildtype (by 0.7, 0.5, 1 and 1 day respectively; Figure 5.5C). In addition, we
found that the che1 mutant inoculated individually formed fewer nodules than
the wildtype at the 2nd week and that the nodules formed were 15% smaller on
average at the 4th week (Figure 5.7B and C).
This indicates that removing motility or the main chemotaxis system delays
nodule initiation. The extent of the luminescence signal along large portions of
the roots indicates that it comes from the colonised root near root hairs. As such,
chemotaxis and motility are likely important for movement from the root surface to
the root hair tips, and thus causing the delay in nodule formation after activation of
the lux signal at the root surface. Another possibility is that chemotaxis is important
for movement down the root hairs inside the infection threads, and thus causing a
delay after entering the root hairs. To distinguish between the two, experiments were
attempted to count the root hairs produced by the che1 mutant under competition.
Unfortunately, finding infection threads or colonised root hair tips proved difficult,
to the point that we were unable to consistently score their occurrence per root.
A potential reason for this is that the number of infection threads on a root at a
particular time is likely restricted. Instead, future experiments could take a different
approach by comparing the exudates of root hairs versus the root proper. These
could examine their chemoattractive effects and metabolic profiles to determine if
it is plausible that there is chemotactic movement to root hair tips.
As for movement down infection threads, this was indirectly tested in the
nodule development experiment. These experiments found no difference in bacteria
or bacteroid counts in mature nodules between the che1 mutant and wildtype
(Figure 5.8A). Since infection threads are continuously formed as the nodule grows
148 5.10. Discussion
and matures, it is expected that any disruption of infection thread movement
would affect the bacteria and bacteroid counts (Vasse et al. 1990; Monahan-
Giovanelli, Pinedo and Gage 2006). It is thus unlikely that the che1 cluster is
important for this stage of symbiosis.
Either way, the role appears to be after biofilm formation on the root. The coloni-
sation effect was apparently masked in the INSeq experimental conditions, probably
as a result of the whole library being non-motile. However, this enabled the role of
chemotaxis independent of colonisation to be seen in nodulation competitiveness.
5.10.2 The che2 cluster has a role in nodule maturation
We also investigated the che2 cluster using the same experiments mentioned above.
However, the results of the che2 mutant were distinct from the che1 mutant,
resulting in different conclusions. Firstly, in the INSeq experiment, insertions in
the che2 cluster genes were found to be neutral in the rhizosphere, on plant root
and for bacteroids but advantaged for nodule bacteria (Figure 5.1). Whatever
role the che2 cluster performs, mutating it produces nodules that overall have
an increased number of bacteria.
A broad view of symbiosis was examined in light of the che2 mutation, specifically
across attachment, colonisation and nodulation competition. These experiments
found disparate results, with a 3 order of magnitude difference on attachment, a 27%
reduction in competitive colonisation and no difference in competitive nodulation
between the che2 mutant and wildtype (Figures 5.2, 5.4 and 5.6). It appears that
the disrupted motility of the che2 mutant may prevent an effective transition to a
sessile state at the root surface, as discussed above. Perhaps then this effect also
causes the reduction in colonisation, although ameliorated over the longer timescale.
Alternatively, the che2 deletion is partially complemented in trans by the presence
of the wildtype in the competitive colonisation and nodulation experiments.
Any role of the che2 cluster in early attachment is unlikely to cause the observed
INSeq phenotype that deletion of che2 genes produced an increase in recovered
nodule bacteria. Further experiments thus examined later stages of symbiosis,
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 149
beginning with the transition from root colonisation to early nodule development.
This experiment involved scoring the timing of initialisation (through nodABC lux)
and formation of nodules (when visible). The che2 mutant was not significantly
different to the wildtype in either initiation timing or duration (Figure 5.5). The
next experiment observed nodule development by measuring the distribution of
nodule areas at different timepoints. Interestingly, the che2 mutant displayed
significant differences to the wildtype at each timepoint, forming 50% less nodules
in week 2; having a smaller distribution of nodules in week 3 (19% reduction in
average area); and, in week 4, the roots of plants harbouring che2 mutant were
29% smaller (Figure 5.7). These changes combined indicate that the che2 mutant
is defective for nodule maturation, forming smaller nodules at a slower rate and
thus impacting the plant health. To discover why, the next experiment analysed
the composition of mature nodules.
To compare the composition of wildtype nodules to those of the che2 mutant,
bacteria and bacteroids were extracted from mature nodules and counted. We
found that although there was no significant difference between counts of bacteria
in wildtype and che2 mutant nodules, there was a 30% reduction of bacteroids
(Figure 5.8A). This result seems to contradict the INSeq result of an increase of
nodule bacteria mutated in the che2 cluster. The difference in this experiment,
is that it only examined mature nodules. All the nodules on each plants roots
were harvested for the INSeq experiment. Since the che2 mutant forms nodules
that mature at a slower rate than the wildtype, mutants with insertions inside the
cluster are expected to be at an earlier stage in development when there would
be more bacteria that have yet to differentiate.
The role of the Che2 cluster in nodule maturation may be guiding movement
down infection threads. Firstly, although sliding motility via growth is the dominant
way to move down the infection threads, there is some evidence for movement
independent from growth (Gage and Margolin 2000; Gage 2002; Fournier et al.
2008). Interestingly, due to the oxygen gradient within nodules, the HemAT sensor
described in Section 3.7.3, would favour swimming in the opposite direction. If this
150 5.11. Methods
is the case, perhaps the action of the Che2 system is to override this and guide the
sensory system down the infection threads. Indeed, the methylation protein CheB2
of the che2 cluster has been shown to alter the methylation of chemoreceptors
linked to the che1 cluster (Miller et al. 2007). Future experiments could examine
the effect of the double che1 and che2 mutant on nodule composition to determine
if the link between the two systems is important.
However, it is more likely that the role of the Che2 cluster in nodule development
is even independent of flagella. The whole flagellar machinery is down-regulated in
infection threads and subsequently in nodules (Karunakaran et al. 2009). Future
experiments could investigate this by testing the nodule composition of the motA and
fliG mutants, with paralysed and absent flagella, respectively. If so, then the Che2
cluster must act by some other mechanism, perhaps driving motility through pili.
5.11 Methods
5.11.1 INSeq assay
As described by Wheatley et al. (2020), the INSeq experiment was performed
as follows. Rlv3841 mariner insertion mutants (input1) were inoculated onto 7-
day-old pea seedlings and subsequently recovered at 5 days post inoculation (dpi)
to construct two libraries for INSeq analysis; 1) the rhizosphere and 2) the roots.
Rlv3841 mariner insertion mutants (input2) were inoculated onto 7-day-old pea
seedlings and subsequently recovered at 28 days post inoculation (dpi) from the
nodules. A total of 150,000 nodules were picked from approximately 1,500 plants
and a further two libraries for INSeq analysis were constructed; 3) undifferentiated
nodule bacteria, generated by growing bacteria from crushed nodules (which will
represent nodule bacteria that are not terminally differentiated along with those
recently released from infection threads) for 12 h in rich medium before extracting
DNA, and 4) bacteroids, generated from DNA extraction from the nodules. A total
of six INSeq libraries (input 1, input 2, the rhizosphere, roots, nodule bacteria
and bacteroids) were sequenced and analysed by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
(DeJesus and Ioerger 2013). Each of the 7,357 Rlv3841 genes which contain TA
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 151
insertion sites (99.9% of the genome), was classified as essential (ES), defective
(DE), neutral (NE) or advantaged (AD). Genes classified as NE in the respective
input library (6,429 for input1 and 6,656 for input2) were considered for each
test condition, with genes classified as either ES or DE (ES/DE) regarded as
required at that stage of symbiosis.
5.11.2 Attachment assay
This assay was used to determine the ability of a strain to attach to plant
roots. Plasmid pIJ11282, containing lux under a constitutive pNeo promoter,
was conjugated into bacteria. Marked bacteria were then grown on TY slopes
for 3 days before being resuspended into a TY liquid culture overnight without
antibiotics. Peas were germinated as per Section 2.8.1 and planted in boiling tubes
as per Section 2.8.3. The bacteria were resuspended in 4 mL of 15 mM MES/HEPES
buffer (pH 7) and diluted to an optical density of OD600 = 0.1 in a volume of 100
mL. These mixtures were measured in triplicate on a PlateReader to determine
luminescence and optical density for normalisation. Next the peas were removed
from the tubes, dipped in sterile milliq H2O and taped to the side of boiling tubes.
The peas were then incubated in the bacterial suspensions for 1 hour with shaking
at 150 rpm. The plants were then swirled gently in sterile milliq H2O and blot dry
on tissue paper. The roots were then removed and placed on square petri dishes for
imaging using a NightOWL II LB 983 system (Berthold). The NightOWL system
was run with the following conditions: luminescence, exposure time: 20s, gain:
high, readout: slow, binning factors: 2x2 binning, cosmic suppression: enabled,
subtract background image: disabled, background correction: enabled, Flatfield
correction: disabled, image accumulation: disabled, emission filter wheel A, filter
photo and wavelength 560nm.
5.11.3 Colonisation assay
This assay was used to determine the relative colonisation competitive fitness of
a strain. The bacteria were marked with both mCherry and sYFP fluorescent
152 5.11. Methods
proteins. Peas were germinated as per Section 2.8.1 and planted in boiling tubes
as per Section 2.8.3. The next day, marked bacteria were grown on TY slopes
for 3 days. After a further 4 days of plant and bacterial growth, the plants were
inoculated with a 105 1:1 mix of the bacterial strains in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Both
combinations of mCherry and sYFP marking of the strains were tested. The 106
serial dilution of the inoculant was measured on a flow cytometer to determine the
initial ratio of strains (Section 5.11.7). The plants were then harvested at either
1, 3, 5 or 7 days. The roots were separated, weighed and mixed with 25 mL of
0.9% NaCl supplemented with 0.02% Silwet-L77. The roots were then vortexed at
maximum speed (2500 rpm) for 1 minute each. The liquid was then passed through
a 40 m filter to remove excess plant debris. This filtrate was then measured on a
flow cytometer to determine the ratio of strains on the root surface (Section 5.11.7).
5.11.4 Nodule competition assay
This assay was used to determine overall competitive fitness of a strain against the
wild type. The bacteria were marked with the genes gusA or celB for -glucuronidase
or thermostable -galactosidase activity, respectively (Snchez-Caizares and Pala-
cios 2013). Tagged bacteria were then grown on TY slopes for 3 days. Peas were
germinated as per Section 2.8.1, and two peas per 500 mL pot were planted within
a mix of 50/50 fine vermiculite and silver sand as per Section 2.8.3. A 105 1:1
mix of the bacterial strains for comparison was added to each pot. The bacterial
mixes were also plated in triplicate on TY plates supplemented with X-glcA (5-
bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronic acid CHA salt) to confirm the mixture
ratios. Negative controls were also made by adding water instead of the bacterial
mixtures. The plants were harvested after 21 days and stained as per Section 2.8.6.
The nodules were then counted by colour to determine the output ratio of strains.
5.11.5 Nodule development assay
The bacteria and plants were grown as per Section 5.11.4, with single inoculum
of celB marked strains. The plants were harvested after 14, 21 and 28 days and
5. Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis 153
stained as per Section 2.8.6. The roots were then photographed and analysed using
an image analysis pipeline (github.com/AroneyS/Nodule-segmentation).
5.11.6 Nodule harvest and bacteroid isolation
This assay was used to determine the proportion of bacteria and bacteroids in the
nodules formed by various strains. The bacteria were first marked with sfGFP
fluorescent protein. The peas were germinated as per Section 2.8.1, and two peas
per 500 mL pot were planted within fine vermiculite as per Section 2.8.3. A 1 mL
105 inoculum of bacteria was added to each pot. The plants were harvested after 21
days and 10 mature nodules per plant were removed. The nodules were weighed,
then crushed into 1 mL of bacteroid isolation buffer. This buffer contained 1M
K2HPO4, KH2PO4, 300 mM sucrose and 2 mM MgCl2, and was filter sterilised
with 0.22 m filters. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes
to pellet plant debris. The liquid was reserved, being centrifuged again at 6000
rpm for 5 minutes, with the pellet resuspended in 1 mL 0.9% NaCl. The wash
was repeated once. The liquid was then diluted 1:10 in flow-cytometer grade PBS
for flow cytometer analysis (Section 5.11.7).
5.11.7 Flow cytometer measurement
Samples were measured in a flow cytometer as follows. 100 L of each sample
were placed in triplicate in 96-well plates, alternating rows with washes of 0.9%
NaCl. The flow cytometer was set to measure the forward and side scatter of each
particle alongside its fluorescence. Once the number of reasonable particles for a
sample reached 5000, the machine was washed with 30 L of 0.9% NaCl. sYFP,
mCherry and sfGFP labelled cells were distinguished by setting a threshold of
fluorescence (4000 for each, Figure 5.10A-B). Further gates were set to differentiate
bacteria and bacteroids based on forward and size scatter. The bacteroids were
larger (forward scatter) and more granular (side scatter) than the bacteria (Figure
5.10C-D). These raw counts were then analysed.

Conclusions and future perspectives
6.1 Impact of the 2020 Pandemic
The thesis work was partially conducted during extensive periods of COVID-19
pandemic lockdown from March 2020-21. This meant that several experiments
were unable to be completed, including flagella presence scoring. In addition, the
bioinformatic analysis was extended during home-work.
6.2 General overview
Fertilisers are used to provide crop plants with essential nutrients such as nitrogen.
However, fertiliser generation is energetically expensive and must be provided in
excess, with most fertiliser nitrogen leaching into surrounding water-systems (Cheng
2008; Smil 2011; Oldroyd and Dixon 2014). The symbiosis of legumes with rhizobia
exhibits none of these problems since the bacteria provide fixed nitrogen directly
to the plant. However, while efforts have been made to transfer this symbiosis to
non-legume crops, the system remains unique to legumes (Geddes et al. 2015).
Further understanding of the initiation of symbiosis may enable improvements to
the farming of crop legumes and enable the same processes to be mimicked in
engineered systems of other crops. Although motility and chemotaxis are known to
be crucial for competitive plant root colonisation (the first stage of symbiosis), little
156 6.3. The multiple sensory systems of Rlv3841
is known about their importance after this stage (Rodriguez-Navarro, Dardanelli
and Ruiz-Sainz 2007; Scharf, Hynes and Alexandre 2016; Wheatley and Poole
2018). In this thesis, I aimed to describe the importance of chemotaxis and motility
in sequential stages of symbiosis up to the generation of root nodules filled with
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. To this end, the chemotaxis and motility systems of
the model rhizobia Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) were
characterised, in both free-living and plant-associated states.
Similar to standard models such as E. coli, Rlv3841 motility is driven by
flagella rotation modulated by a chemotaxis system that responds to signals sensed
by chemoreceptors. In this work we found that Rlv3841 has a diverse set of
chemoreceptors that enable the bacteria to sense and respond to a variety of
chemical gradients. It was found that the chemoreceptors operate both as external
sensors and internal sensors of the cells metabolic state (Chapter 3). We also found
a novel system that appears to halt the bacteria in response to high concentrations
of TCA cycle intermediates (Chapter 4). Critical components of this system were
identified, but the link to the flagella is currently unknown. Finally, we characterised
the importance of the chemotaxis and flagella systems of Rlv3841 at sequential
stages of the symbiosis (Chapter 5). We found that there were several critical
stages in which chemotaxis and motility are essential and that these occur after
the plant root has been colonised by the rhizobia.
6.3 The multiple sensory systems of Rlv3841
The chemotaxis and motility systems of Rlv3841 were first characterised, including
its 25 chemoreceptors (Chapter 3). Various mutant strains were examined by
measuring the swimming halos produced in UMS semi-solid agar supplemented
with various carbon and nitrogen sources. As expected, mutants of critical flagella
genes (motA and fliG) were found to be non-motile, producing solid halos of limited
size. Another mutant of the gene encoding the main flagellar filament protein
(flaA) was expected to be unable to form stable flagellar filaments (Scharf et al.
2001; Tambalo et al. 2010a). Although the flaA mutant displayed greatly reduced
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 157
motility, it was still motilepossibly because it was partially rescued by other
copies of the gene (flaB, flaC, flaD, flaE or flaH ).
Wildtype Rlv3841 was tested on a variety of carbon sources and was found to
display increase swimming in response to reduced levels of a number of metabolites
including glucose, arabinose, pyruvate, acetate, succinate, malate and fumarate.
In addition to the flagella mutants referred to above, mutants in both chemotaxis
operons (che1 and che2 ) were obtained. The che1 mutant no longer displayed
swimming responses to varying levels of glucose, pyruvate or arabinose, whereas
the che2 mutant displayed the same responses as wildtype. As expected, the Che1
cluster appears to be the dominant chemotaxis system for free-living control of
swimming (Miller et al. 2007). Interestingly, the acetate and organic acid effects
were not removed with chemotaxis operon deletion.
High acetate concentration produced faint halos that were smaller than the
non-motile mutants. This was assumed to be a toxicity effect. However, the
halos formed on high concentrations of organic acids were larger and cloudy, and
appeared to be formed by halting at high concentrations followed by swimming after
consumption brought the concentration down. The investigation undertaken to find
the mechanism behind the TCA cycle intermediate halting effect is described
below (Section 6.4).
The various chemoreceptors encoded by Rlv3841 were also characterised. These
receptors were found to have a wide variety of sensory domains and sensor types,
including periplasmic sensors predicted to sense amino acids, peptides, carbohy-
drates, carboxylates and organic acids, and cytoplasmic sensors predicted to sense
oxygen, redox levels or light. Characterisation of the domains of the chemoreceptors
revealed two distinct groups: those encoding proteins with longer signalling domains
that were associated with the che2 cluster (mcrA, mcrB and mcrC ) and those
with smaller signalling domains which included all the other chemoreceptors. It
may be that the association of most chemoreceptors with the Che1 cluster, with
only those three associated with Che2, is what drives the dominance of the Che1
158 6.4. TCA cycle intermediate halting effect
cluster. Additionally, some of the receptors were found not to have transmembrane
domains, indicating that they are internal sensors.
Two such cytoplasmic sensors were IcpA and HemAT, both having a Protoglobin
sensor domain predicted to sense oxygen via a haem group, although only HemAT
has the conserved residues important for haem binding in Bacillus subtilis (Hou
et al. 2001; Zhang, Olson and Phillips 2005). Analysis of mutants of both sensors
found that the receptor encoded by icpA senses the metabolic state of the cell,
with mutants being unable to stimulate motility to the extent of the wildtype
under nearly all carbon sources tested but independent of oxygen tension. In
contrast, the HemAT receptor appears to sense oxygen concentrations, presumably
by binding haem. Mutants of hemAT had reduced motility in conditions with
high oxygen consumption or low oxygen tension.
6.4 TCA cycle intermediate halting effect
In Chapters 3 and 4, the discovery and investigation of a TCA cycle intermediate
halting effect is described. High concentrations of succinate, malate or fumarate
produced cloudy, spotted halos on swimming plates and even higher concentrations
of succinate produced non-motile halos. It is expected that this morphology is
caused by a halting effect from high concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates.
The bacteria are initially halted but begin swimming once sufficient organic acid has
been consumed; the bacteria then reach an area with high substrate concentration
and halt again, forming another spot. As this process repeats, many spots are
formed around the edges of the halo to produce the cloudy spots effect. Tracking
individual bacteria in varying concentrations of succinate showed a reduced motile
fraction in high succinate confirming this explanation.
The halting effect was next tested across a range of soil bacteria including
representatives from Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Azorhizobium, Azospirillum, Pseu-
domonas and Kosakonia. However, responses to a high concentration of succinate
were only observed in the Rhizobium leguminosarum strains.
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 159
The TCA cycle intermediate halting effect was found to be independent of both
chemotaxis clusters and internal chemoreceptors, still being observed in che mutants.
In addition, both the carbon and nitrogen branches of the phosphotransferase
system (PTS) were found to affect motility but are not responsible for the halting
effect. Deletions of the gene encoding the key carbon branch protein, manX, and
the gene encoding the key nitrogen branch protein, pstN1, were found to reduce
motility. These reductions were recovered by the non-phosphorylatable mutant
of ManX (H9A) and by the phosphomimic mutant of PtsN1 (H66D) respectively
but not by the reverse mimics. Both proteins tend to be phosphorylated under
nitrogen limitation and carbon excess, and not phosphorylated under nitrogen
excess and carbon limitation (Sanchez-Caizares et al. 2020). It is possible
that under nitrogen limitation, PtsN-P stimulates motility, whereas in carbon
limitation, ManX stimulates motility.
In order to identify systems that were connected to the halting effect, a screen was
performed by growing wildtype in the presence of high TCA cycle intermediates and
isolating mutants from the papillations that formed. From this we isolated and then
sequenced 9 independent strains that no longer responded to high concentrations of
succinate, malate or fumarate. These strains were discovered to have mutations in
either an ABC transporter for inorganic phosphate uptake (pstSCAB, RL0542-5)
or a putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase (RL3464). Both types of mutants
were found to abolish the cloudy spots morphology in high organic acid media and
to have an increased motile fraction at high succinate over the wildtype. These
effects were restored to wildtype by complementation with the native operons. In
addition, constitutive expression of the gene encoding the putative methyltransferase
in the wildtype strain caused a non-motile phenotype.
The protein encoded by RL3464 has a Pfam classification as a putative (S)-
Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase. Bioinformatic analysis
grouped methyltransferases from various Rhizobium strains together, each with
>92% amino acid identity with the methyltransferase from Rlv3841. Another
clade was formed of methyltransferases from various Sinorhizobium strains, each
160 6.4. TCA cycle intermediate halting effect
with about 70% identity with the methyltransferase from Rlv3841. The lack of
a halting effect in Sinorhizobium strains could be due to these differences or to
absence of downstream effectors
The other primary mutations were observed in the pstSCAB genes (RL0542-5).
These genes encode PstSCAB, a high affinity inorganic phosphate transporter that
appears coredundant with PhoCDET, with either function sufficient for effective
symbiosis and fixation (Yuan, Zaheer and Finan 2006; Hu et al. 2018). PstSCAB is
additionally associated with a PhoRB two-component system (encoded by RL0540
and RL0547) via a linker protein PhoU (encoded by RL0546). PhoU negatively
regulates both PhoRB and PstSCAB when under excess phosphate conditions and
dissociates under limiting phosphate conditions (Makino et al. 1989; Hsieh and
Wanner 2010; diCenzo et al. 2017). A frame-shift mutation in pstC was observed in
S. meliloti Rm1021, causing constitutive activation of the PhoB response regulator
(Krol and Becker 2004; Yuan, Zaheer and Finan 2006). This mutation was matched
in strains OPS2290 and OPS2300, both having frame-shift mutations in pstC.
Although this suggests that constitutive activation of PhoB, likely caused by these
mutations, could be responsible for the mutant phenotype, the halting effect still
occurs under phosphate limiting conditions. These mutations are thus likely to
have this effect through the independent regulatory role of some unidentified part
of the system, possibly the PhoU protein.
Another possible pathway is through regulation by a separate system that
senses high levels of TCA-cycle intermediates. For instance, ActSR is activated
by a reduced electron transport chain (ETC) which would be produced by high
concentrations of succinate driving the TCA cycle and pushing high amounts of
reductant through the ETC (Tiwari et al. 1996; Priefer et al. 2001; Elsen et
al. 2004; Fenner et al. 2004). ActSR could thus be the sensory trigger for the
TCA-cycle intermediate halting effect if it transcriptionally regulates pstSCAB or
RL3464, which then presumably interact with motility in some way. Alternatively,
PstSCAB and the SAM-dependent methyltransferase could be responding to the
proton motive force, which would also be increased with high TCA cycle activity.
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 161
Since PstSCAB transports via ATPase activity and the increased proton motive
force would drive increased ATP synthase activity, the activity of the PstSCAB
transporter could also be increased under high organic acids. This may then cause
a downstream response leading to non-motility.
6.5 Chemotaxis and motility in symbiosis
An insertion sequencing (INSeq) experiment was conducted for rhizosphere, root
colonised and nodule bacteria, and differentiated nodule bacteroids to cover various
stages of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. In general, the experiment found that
genes required for flagella assembly and genes in the che1 cluster were essential
for both nodule bacteria and bacteroids but not for rhizosphere growth and root
colonisation. Strains with mutations in genes in the che2 cluster were advantaged
in nodule bacteria but neutral in all other categories.
To confirm these results and examine the stages more closely, the chemotaxis
and motility mutants described above were tested against wildtype at sequential
stages of the symbiosis (Chapter 5; Figure 6.1). Firstly, attachment to roots was
assayed by incubating pea roots in a liquid suspension of constitutively luminescent
bacteria for 1 hour and imaging to count the total luminescence from attached
bacteria. Next, root colonisation was assayed by inoculating pea plants grown in
vermiculite with a competitive mixture of fluorescent bacteria and, after 5 days,
counting colonised bacteria through flow cytometry. Then, symbiosis initiation
was assayed by inoculating vetch plants grown on FP media plates with flavonoid-
responsive luminescent bacteria and, over a period of 13 days, measuring the time
between nodule initiation (visualised as spikes of luminescence) and the eventual
physical appearance of nodules on the root. Next, nodule maturation was assayed by
inoculating pea plants grown in vermiculite with enzymatically marked bacteria and,
after 2, 3 and 4 weeks, measuring the area of each nodule through an image analysis
pipeline. Nodulation competition was then assayed by inoculating pea plants
grown in vermiculite with a competitive mixture of enzymatically marked bacteria
and, after 3 weeks, counting stained nodules of each strain. Finally, bacteroid

differentiation was assayed by inoculating pea plants grown in vermiculite with
fluorescently marked bacteria and, after 3 weeks, counting bacteria and bacteroids
in mature nodules through flow cytometry.
6.5.1 The Che1 cluster is important in early stages of
symbiosis
Firstly, we found that the chemotaxis mutants in che1, che1,2 and che2 were
defective for early attachment but the flagella mutants of fliG and motA were
not significantly different to wildtype. Since the results appear paradoxical
motility being unimportant but disruption to motility via chemotaxis being highly
detrimentalwe independently verified the results in multiple ways. One possible
explanation is that the chemotaxis mutants were moving too fast or too erratically to
effectively transition to a sessile state upon reaching the boundary layer at the root
surface and thus display reduced attachment. Indeed, Secchi et al. (2020) found that
motile and non-motile strains were indistinguishable for attachment when under high
fluid flow and that disruptions to tumbling, such as via chemotaxis mutants, altered
attachment. Alternatively, the flagella mutants may have altered exopolysaccharide
(EPS) regulation, noting that EPS is required for strong attachment and is commonly
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 163
antagonistically regulated with flagella (Janczarek 2011; Schaper et al. 2016, 2017;
Wheatley and Poole 2018).
Results for later stages were more straightforward, with che1, che1,2, fliG and
motA mutants all having defects in competitive colonisation and nodulation, and in
nodule initiation. These results suggest that Che1 and flagella have an early role
in initial colonisation and a later role between colonisation and nodule initiation.
Swarming motility along the roots is expected to be important for competitive root
colonisation, however, a later role for motility has not yet been described. There
are two later stages that may require motility: movement from the root surface
to the root hair tips and movement down infection threads. Infection threads are
continuously formed as the nodule grows and matures, so it is expected that any
disruption of infection thread movement would affect the bacteria and bacteroid
counts (Vasse et al. 1990; Monahan-Giovanelli, Pinedo and Gage 2006). However,
since the che1 mutant had no significant difference in nodule composition, it is
unlikely that Che1 is important for this stage. Thus it is likely that chemotaxis
and motility are important for efficient movement to the root hair tips in order
to competitively initiate symbiosis.
6.5.2 The Che2 cluster is important for nodule development
In addition to the defects on early attachment, the che2 mutant was also found
to be defective in later stages. Despite having wildtype timings for initiation of
nodules, the che2 mutant displayed delays in nodule maturation. After 2 weeks,
the che2 mutant had significantly less nodules than wildtype; after 3 weeks, the
nodules were significantly smaller; and after 4 weeks, the roots of plants harbouring
the mutant were significantly smaller. Together, these results indicate that the
Che2 system has a role in nodule development such that the mutant forms smaller
nodules at a slower rate to the extent that it impacts plant health.
We also investigated the composition of nodules since the INSeq screen recovered
an increased number of bacteria with che2 insertions from nodules. We found
that although there was no significant change in bacterial counts, there were 30%
164 6.6. Future directions
less bacteroids counted in mature nodules formed by the che2 mutant than by
the wildtype. These results again suggest a defect in nodule maturation for che2
mutants and thus a role for the Che2 cluster in nodule development. If this role of
the Che2 cluster is linked to flagella-based movement, it may be to guide motility
down infection threads at nodule initiation and during nodule maturation. Although
sliding motility via growth is the dominant way to move down the infection threads,
there is some evidence for movement independent from growth (Gage and Margolin
2000; Gage 2002; Fournier et al. 2008). However, the entire flagella machinery is
down-regulated in infection threads and subsequently in nodules (Karunakaran et
al. 2009). Since there is no genetic evidence of a secondary flagellar system, this
motility may instead be driven by pili. In that case, the Che2 cluster may instead
be linked to pili and control twitching motility down infection threads.
6.6 Future directions
This work has provided a theoretical overview of all the chemoreceptors encoded
by Rlv3841 by bioinformatic analysis. Future work could physically characterise
these chemoreceptors, especially focussing on those with unknown sensor domains.
Although deletions and multi-deletions would be powerful ways to discover the
signals connected to each receptor, the abundance of genes and likely redundancy
between them would make this difficult. Instead, the genes could be individually
transferred to a chemoreceptor-gutted model bacteria to test for positive reactions
to a library of signal compounds. Once candidate compounds have been discovered,
protein tests by differential scanning fluorimetry and isothermal titration calorimetry
would allow the binding kinetics to be characterised (Niesen, Berglund and Vedadi
2007; Webb et al. 2014).
An obvious extension to the investigation into the TCA-cycle intermediate
halting effect is to determine the TCA-cycle-intermediate sensor and whether it is
directly or indirectly sensing (See Table 6.1). The first candidate is the PstSCAB
system which could be modulating PhoU or PhoB activity in response to organic
acids, potentially indirectly via effects on the proton motive force and ATP. However,
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 165
since low phosphate conditions (expected to activate PhoB) did not trigger a halting
response, it is unlikely that sensing is due to ATP-powered phosphate transport.
This also challenges a role for PstSCAB in TCA-cycle-intermediate-halting-effect
signal transduction which must then act via some phosphate-transport-independent
activity of the system. However, further testing of the activity of PhoU and PhoB
in relation to organic acid concentrations could reveal a signal transduction role
On the other hand, the methyltransferase encoded by RL3464 is unlikely to be
the sensor since it has no annotated sensor domain and consists nearly entirely
of the Pfam Methyltransf_28 domain. Alternatively, the sensor could by the
electron-transport-chain-associated ActSR two-component system, which could
sense effects of organic acids on the ETC. Although none of the papillation mutants
had mutations in actSR, the system may be too critical to harbour mutations,
especially in competition against wildtype in the semi-solid plate environment.
Future work could attempt to generate actSR deletion mutants and then assess their
swimming response to TCA-cycle intermediates and their expression of pstSCAB
and RL3464. These experiments could determine which, if any, of these systems
is sensing TCA-cycle intermediate concentrations.
Another unknown is if the TCA-cycle intermediate halting effect acts through
post-translational control of flagella or instead by transcriptional down-regulation
(See Table 6.1). Although the timescale of the plate experiments favours transcrip-
tional regulation, tracked bacteria responded within 3 hours. To more precisely
determine the kinetics of halting, a culture growing in low succinate conditions
could be shocked with high succinate then have their swimming tracked immediately
afterwards. If the change can occur within a few minutes, then it is highly unlikely
to be transcriptional control, which would be expected to occur via dilution from
cell division, thus taking several hours. In addition, the relative proportion of
flagellated cells under high and low succinate concentrations could be determined
through staining and microscopy (Kodaka et al. 1982b; Heimbrook, Wang and
Campbell 1989b).
166 6.6. Future directions
If the effect is through post-translational control of flagella, there are two
candidates: the putative methyltransferase encoded by RL3464 and the CheY
proteins(See Table 6.1). Since acetylation of CheY causes increased motor binding
that encourages tumbling, excessive amounts of acetylated CheY could lead to a
locked motor. However, the TCA-cycle interemediate halting effect still occured
in che1 and che2 and the double che1,2 mutant. Alternatively, the putative
methyltransferase could methylate some component of the flagellar motor or some
kind of flagellar brake protein to cause a halt. Indeed, constitutive expression
of RL3464 in wildtype Rlv3841 produced a non-motile strain. Mutation of the
RL3464 gene could reveal these downstream effects. In addition, RL3464 could
be expressed in a protein vector to produce tagged, purified protein for cell lysate
pull-downs as a binding screen. It is likely that downstream elements of the putative
methyltransferase are causing the halting effect. It has proved particularly effective
in the Poole lab to Flag tag proteins and express them in Rlv3841. They are
then gently lysed under native conditions, proteins bound to anti-Flag resin in
a chromatography column, washed, then eluted with Flag peptide before mass
spectrometry analysis. This has revealed interacting partners in native Rlv3841 for
FixAB and PtsN proteins and could be a powerful approach to study RL3464.
If, in contrast, the effect is found to be via transcriptional regulation, it is more
likely to be controlled via PstSCAB or ActSR (See Table 6.1). Either of these systems
could directly affect flagellar synthesis through controlling transcription of VisNR
or by increasing c-di-GMP levels to indirectly downregulate motility. However, it is
unlikely to be mediated solely by ActSR since this would bypass both the PstSCAB
system and the putative methyltransferase and thus mutations in these systems
would not be expected to prevent the halting effect. In addition, since low phosphate
conditions did not trigger the halting effect, it is unlikely that simple action of
PhoB is transcriptionally regulating flagella. Importantly, further investigations
are necessary to confirm that the system behaves in Rlv3841 as described in other
species; perhaps by mutating individual genes or the entire operon. The current data,
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 167
however, supports post-translational regulation by the putative methyltransferase
more strongly than transcriptional regulation by either PstSCAB or ActSR.
Finally, there is the question as to the relevance of the system to the free-living
and symbiotic lifestyles of Rlv3841. It may be that during free-living conditions the
chemotaxis systems are dominant in their control of motility since high levels of
TCA-cycle intermediates in the soil are likely rare. In the rhizosphere or at plant
root surfaces, there likely would be higher concentrations of TCA-cycle intermediates
due to root exudation. Perhaps the TCA-cycle intermediate halting effect is active
at the plant to assist in biofilm formation or symbiosis initiation. Alternatively, if
concentrations only reach sufficient levels inside the plant, the halting effect may
support the transition to the mostly sessile symbiotic life within the nodule. Since
Rlv3841 nodulates a wide variety of plants, it would need to respond to widely
relevant signals for differentiation, one of which may be the high levels of organic
acids that legumes feed their symbionts.

In addition to the halting effect, this work revealed a potential role for Che1 and
flagella in the movement from the root surface to root hair tips in order to initiate
symbiosis. This could be further investigated by comparing the exudates of root
hairs versus the root proper. Differences in metabolic profiles may produce different
chemoattraction effects and thus explain the chemotactic movement to root hair tips.
Finally, the role of Che2 could be further investigated, to determine if infection
thread movement or bacteroid differentiation are more likely (See Table 6.2). Impacts
on bacteroid differentiation were found with che2 INSeq mutants being advantaged
for nodule bacteria and che2 deletion mutants forming 30% less bacteroids per
nodule mass and having delayed nodule maturation. Perhaps Che2 has a role
in sensing a plant signal to prepare the bacteria for differentiation or works as
a redundant trigger for differentiation. However, there are no known links from
chemotaxis to bacteroid differentiation, so more work is needed for a conclusion to be
reached. Alternatively, Che2 could have a role in movement down infection threads.
In addition to control of active motility being a known role for chemotaxis, since
infection threads occur throughout maturation, disruption of this movement could
cause the bacteroid effects noted above. Although the che2 mutant was not found
to be delayed in symbiosis initiation on Vetch, the delays in nodule maturation on
Pea indicate that the mutation has a systemic impact across the symbiosis. Perhaps
the role of che2 is emphasised in later infection threads through maturation rather
than the initiation infection threads where free-living systems may still be active.
6. Conclusions and future perspectives 171
Another unknown is if the Che2 system acts via flagella, pili or another, unknown
system (See Table 6.2). At first glance flagella appears the most likely since the
Che2 system has a known connection to swimming, with che2 deletion mutants
displaying reduced halo diameters and increased tumble rate, and CheB2 being
known to methylate Che1-associated chemoreceptors (Miller et al. 2007). However,
the whole flagellar machinery is also known to be downregulated in infection threads
and subsequently in the nodule (Karunakaran et al. 2009). Future experiments
could determine if the flagella are still present during infection through antibody-
targetted staining of flagella in nodule sections. In addition, comparing the nodule
compositions and maturation distributions of the motA and fliG mutants to the
che2 mutant could reveal whether the che2 mutants effects are through flagella.
On the other hand, pili also appear to be a good candidate for the Che2 effector.
Pili could be used to perform twitching motility down the surface of the infection
threads. Chemotaxis systems have been found to regulate type IV pili and twitching
motility in bacteria such as Synechocystis, Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Bhaya, Takahashi and Grossman 2001; Shi and Sun 2002; Alexandre
2015; Oliveira, Foster and Durham 2016). Indeed, although the tad pilus of Rlv3841
was found to be downregulated in bacteroids, the genes were upregulated in the
bacA mutant, which stalls symbiosis at the infection thread stage (Karunakaran et
al. 2010). Thus it is possible that the tad pilus is upregulated in infection threads
to enable twitching motility. In contrast, however, the entire pilus operon was found
to be neutral across all symbiotic stages in the INSeq experiments. To confirm these
results, future experiments could examine the behaviour of pilus mutants compared
to the che2 mutant to determine if they are indeed the Che2 effector. If pili are also
not involved, then the search for the unknown downstream effectors could begin
by screening for phosphorylation targets of CheY3, the most likely candidate for
downstream signalling. Importantly, the INSeq only found various transporters,
unknown genes and mcpT to have the same pattern as che2 : advantaged for nodule
bacteria and neutral for all other symbiotic stages. This suggests both that Che2 is
unlikely to have a role in differentiation via a known regulatory system but also that
172 6.6. Future directions
perhaps it is sensing via McpT. Interestingly, S. meliloti McpT was hypothesised
to have a role in planta but has an uncharacterised sensor domain (Meier and
Scharf 2009; Zatakia et al. 2017). Thus the current data supports the role of Che2
being navigation of infection threads during nodule maturation through pili control,
perhaps by reacting to a signal sensed by McpT.

In conclusion, this work has shown that chemotaxis and motility are indeed
essential for effective symbiosis of rhizobia with legumes, having multiple roles
across the entire cycle. This conclusion is also supported by the intricate and
complex mechanisms controlling motility in Rlv3841, which display the importance
of effective use of motility in the highly competitive soil environment.
