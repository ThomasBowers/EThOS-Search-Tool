[v] Abstract
The cloning of Dolly the sheep and other mammals via nuclear transfer showed that the
adult somatic nucleus could have its developmental potential restored. This restoration is
the result of heritable epigenetic modifications made by nuclear reprogramming
mechanisms. Little is known about factors affecting such nuclear reprogramming and
even less about the mechanisms responsible.
A murine cell hybrid system was established and optimised to study nuclear
reprogramming of somatic cells via fusion with embryonic stem cells. The system
generated hybrid clones which displayed an ES phenotpye and in which the somatic Oct-
4 promoter had been reactivated. These cell lines expressed alkaline phosphatase activity
and undifferentiated cell marker SSEA-4 but not markers associated with differentiated
cells (SSEA-1 and CD90). These lines were pluripotent, dmonstrating the ability to form
the three embryonic lineages both in vivo and in vitro.
This system was used to investigate whether several treatments (all either known or
expected to perturb global gene expression patterns) affected nuclear reprogramming.
Moderate heat shocking of thymocytes prior to fusion with ES cells resulted in increased
reprogrammed hybridisation frequencies but as fusion was also increased it was
impossible to verify whether an increase in nuclear reprogramming was partly
responsible. Serum starvation of primary embryonic fibroblasts significantly increased
nuclear reprogramming, as did ES cell confluence. ES cells were found to lose their
capacity to reprogram as they reached high passage numbers. Constitutive or transient
expression of nucleoplasmin in HM-1 cells did not increase reprogramming but instead
to cell death.
Attempts were made to generate hybrids from human ES cells, but no hybrids were
successfully generated. This was at least partly due to human ES cells being more
difficult to fuse with other cells even using a range of different fusagens. Finally it was
found that treating human ES cells with hyaluronidase prior to electropulsing resulted in
5x more heterokaronformation indicating that the ECM of the these cells had prevented
fusion.
Much remains to be learnt about the mechanisms underpinning reprogramming.

[1] Introduction
[1.1] Background
Traditional models ofmammalian cell commitment are based on the assumption
that as a cell becomes specialised, irreversible changes occur in the nucleus altering the
cell's potential to give rise to other cell types [McGrath & Solter 1984]. However this
paradigm does not extend to the experimental situation where the nucleus is transplanted
into a foreign cytoplasm. Wilmut et al. (1997) produced a viable mammal by fusing an
adult differentiated somatic nucleus to an enucleated oocyte. Such fusion caused
changes that restored nuclear potency to the extent that the nucleus could direct the
development of a viable mammal. Nuclear reprogramming is the process underlying this
restoration of developmental potential. Induction of this process has been demonstrated
many times in somatic cells from nine mammalian species [Wilmut et al. 1997]
[Wakayama et al. 1998][Kato et al. 1998][Bagiuisi et al. 1999][Campbell et al.
2000][Chesne et al. 2002][Gomez et al. 2003][Polejaeva et al. 2003][Vogel et al. 2003].
Frustratingly, the mechanism by which a somatic nucleus may be reprogrammed
remains unknown, although such a mechanism almost certainly involves both structural
[Kikyo et al. 2000] and chemical changes [Monk et al. 1987] to chromatin.
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) possess the capacity to generate, not only identical
daughter cells, but also daughter cells fated to become other cell types [Smith 1998]. It
may be possible that human somatic cells can be reprogrammed to generate PSCs. If
successful, this strategy would provide a potentially endless source of cells for biological
research as well as medical applications (e.g. cell replacement therapy [Briistle et al.
1999], toxicity assessment, drug testing and possible even gene therapy [Smith 1998]).
Fig 1.1 illustrates how identification of reprogramming molecules and mechanisms

Once the mechanism by which epigenetic reprogramming is understood, human somatic
cells extracted from the patient could be induced to dedifferentiate into pluripotent stem
cells (PSCs). PSCs could then be expanded in culture and induced to redifferentiate into
the cell type(s) required by the patient. Differentiated cells could then be transplanted
into the patient without risk of immunorejection.
Mammalian embryonic development will be outlined in the next section to put
definitions of nuclear reprogramming and pluripotent stem cells into context.
[1.2] Cell Differentiation, Mammalian Embryonic Development, and Nuclear
Reprogramming
Cell differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes specialised to perform
specific biological functions [reviewed in Gurdon 1968]. The process is associated with
a decline in the range of cell types that that cell is capable of generating [Gurdon 1968].
It had been initially thought that as cells differentiated that hereditary material no longer
required were cast off or permanently inactivated [Weismann 1893]. 50 years ago
however, Briggs and King transferred differentiated nuclei from blastula cells to
enucleated eggs of Rana pipiens. These reconstructed cells went on to generate normal
hatched embryos. Gurdon later showed that somatic nuclei could even direct
development so that adult frogs were generated [Gurdon 1962], These observations
showed that Weismann's paradigm was incorrect and nuclei of differentiated cells
contain the same genetic material as those of undifferentiated cells [Briggs & King
1952], The current paradigm for how cell differentiation occurs involves the assembly of
condensed chromosomal structures [reviewed in Kass & Wolffe 1998], Such structures,
formed via interactions between DNA and protein, are thought to compartmentalise
chromatin into functional domains and, in some unknown way, stably maintain the
differentiated state even when the cell divides. If this is true, reprogramming the cell to
restore developmental potential will involve the disassembly of such chromosomal
structures. Indeed this is a premise upon which work described in several chapters of
this thesis are based. Heat shock, cell cycle stage and nuclear chaperone activity are all
chromatin-structure altering phenomena and their effects on nuclear reprogramming are
investigated in this work.
In mammalian development, differentiation first occurs after fertilisation in the
preimplantation embryo. After the zygote has undergone several cell divisions, the
embryo consists of a population of cells called blastomeres, which are totipotent, i.e.
capable of generating any cell type. As the embryo develops, the outer layer of cells of
the embryo (the trophectoderm) becomes morphologically distinct from the inner cell
mass (ICM). Cells of the trophectoderm and ICM have different developmental
potentials e.g. cells of the ICM have the potential to form all the cells of the embryo,
whereas the trophectoderm cells have not, instead differentiating into extra-embryonic
cell types that will form the placenta.
Differentiation of cells is found to be highly stable. The only stage during which
normal mammalian cells seem to dedifferentiate naturally is after fertilisation. The
sperm and oocyte, both highly differentiated cells with condensed chromatin structure,
fuse to produce a zygote. Within the zygote, changes lead to the reversion to a totipotent
cellular state. Although the mechanism responsible is unknown, two events correlate
with this dedifferentiation: chromatin structure becomes less dense (protamines are
removed from sperm-derived chromatin by nuclear chaperone nucleoplasmin and
replaced by oocyte-derived histones [Perreault 1992] and methylated haploid parental
genomes are demethylated [Barton et al. 2001], Later sections of this chapter will
discuss these two events in more detail: Subsection [1.10.2] discusses protamine
removal from sperm chromatin by nuclear chaperone nucleoplasmin and Subsection
[1.11.1] gives more detail on DNA methylation after fertilisation.
The processes responsible for the epigenetic changes that lead to
dedifferentiation are referred to as nuclear reprogramming mechanisms. Throughout this
thesis the term "nuclear reprogramming" will refer to "the process by which a
specialised nucleus re-acquires developmental potential" [Singh 2000]. This definition
includes complete reprogramming to a totipotent state (verifiable only by generation of
viable offspring via nuclear transfer) and also partial reprogramming where only
pluripotency is restored.
It has been suggested that the cell cycle stage (the status of a cell with regards to
cell division) affects nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells [Wilmut et al. 1998]. This
theory and evidence on which it is based are discussed in detail in Subsection [1.8.1].
Before this however, the basic features of eukaryotic cell cycle will discussed.
[1.3] The cell cycle
Cell division is the result of several events that occur within a cell since its
previous division. These events are strictly regulated and collectively form a process
known as the cell cycle [Murray & Hunt (1993) reviews the cell cycle and how it is
regulated]. The cell cycle is divided into two main phases: M phase, where the cell
undergoes mitosis, and interphase, where the cell is not visibly dividing. Interphase is
itself broken down into three smaller phases (Gl, S, and G2). During G1 phase of the
cycle, the cell makes the decision whether or not to become committed to undergoing
another full cell cycle. During S phase, DNA replication occurs in the nucleus of the
cell. During G2 phase DNA synthesis ceases and mitosis occurs. The phases of the cell
cycle are shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2 A schematic view of one cell cycle with associated stages and major
checkpoints.
Several distinguishable phases occur within a cell prior to it completing cell division.
These include S phase, where the cell is actively replicating DNA in its nucleus, M
phase where the cell is actively undergoing cell division and the "gap" or G phases. Gl
is the gap after mitosis before DNA replication starts and G2 is the gap after DNA
synthesis is complete before mitosis and cell division. Quiescence or GO is a state cells
are in when they t leave the cell cycle, while still retaining the ability to return to it after
additional signals, such as peptide growth factors, are present.
Also indicated are points in the cell cycle where various surveillance systems
determine whether progress to the next stage of the cell cycle can proceed without
damaging the cell. These points are termed checkpoints. Further details regarding these
are mentioned in the text.
Progression through the cycle is carefully regulated. Checkpoints are points
along the cycle where progression can be safely arrested while certain conditions can be
checked. There are several checkpoints along the eukaryotic somatic cell cycle, the
major one being the restriction point checkpoint, which occurs in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle. At this checkpoint, the cell either becomes committed to undergoing another
cell cycle or else refrains from doing so. Factors such as nutrient supply and cell mass
are important in determining whether a cell passes through this checkpoint of the cell
cycle. Cells may leave the cell cycle and stop dividing while still retaining the ability to
re-enter the cell cycle given the appropriate biochemical cues. Such cells are said to be
quiescent or in GO phase. Cells in this state, while not preparing for cell division, are
however viable. Many cells in vivo that are poised to differentiate are quiescent.
Fibroblasts in culture can be induced into quiescence by feeding the cells with medium
containing low levels of serum or essential growth factors.
The cell cycle stage of a cell can be identified by measuring its DNA content
[Krishan 1975], Using fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, propidium
iodide stained cells with different amounts of DNA can be distinguished. The DNA
complement of cells provides information as to which stage of the cell cycle they are in.
This is explained in Fig 1.3.

In Gl, somatic cells have a diploid complement of chromosomes. During S phase they
have an increasingly greater amount of DNA due to its synthesis. From the beginning of
G2 until mitosis, cells normally have a 4n complement of chromosomes. At cell
division, two daughter cells with separate nuclei are formed giving two diploid cells.
The mechanisms underpinning the regulation of cells progressing through the
cell cycle are highly complex and only partially understood. Protein
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is an integral part of regulation at several
checkpoints [as reviewed by Hartwell 1995].
The mechanism regulating the triggering of mitosis is the best understood to
date. Experiments involving cell fusion highlighted that a factor was responsible for
inducing mitosis [Johnson & Game 1970][Rao & Johnson 1970], Behaviour of the
nuclei in the binucleated cells resulting from fusion, termed heterokaryons, was studied.
When cells in Gl, S, or G2 phases are fused with M phase cells, in the resultant
heterokaryon both nuclei undergo mitosis. This showed that a factor was present in the
cytoplasm of the M phase cell induced the nucleus originating from the other cell to
undergo mitosis. Subsequently it was discovered that small amounts of cytoplasm from
Xenopus eggs could induce G2 arrested Xenopus oocytes to start dividing [Masui &
Markert 1971]. In 1988 Lohka et al. purified and characterised this factor, now called
M-phase promoting factor or MPF.
MPF induces nuclear membrane breakdown within cells [Masui & Markert
1971], as well as triggering nuclear membrane breakdown, chromatin condensation and
spindle fibre formation in cell free systems [Lohka et al. 1984], The factor is a dimer of
two proteins: a catalytic kinase subunit and a regulatory cyclin subunit [Pines
1993][Gautier et al. 1990][Draetta et al. 1989]. Dimerisation of the two subunits
activates the phosphorylation activity of the kinase, and it phosphorylates a range of
proteins which in turn trigger mitosis [Murray et al. 1989], Similar mechanisms act at
other checkpoints (see Fig 1.4)

Fig 1.4 Cdk activity and the cell cycle.
At the major checkpoints of the cell cycle, the phosphorylation status of critical proteins
determines progession. A particular class of protein kinases, termed cyclin dependent
kinases (cdk), is responsible for these phosphorylations. A cdk is composed of a
catalytic kinase subunit, a cyclin and other proteins. By phosphorylating critical
proteins, cdks allow progression through the cell cycle. The diagram shows the two
major checkpoints of the eukaryotic somatic cell cycle: the DNA synthesis (Gl/S)
checkpoint and the mitosis (restriction point) checkpoint. Cdk activity allows
phosphorylation of critical proteins and progression through the cell cycle.
Cyclins are a family of proteins whose expression varies as the cell cycle
progresses: they are synthesised throughout the cell cycle but are degraded at the end of
mitosis (See Figure 1.5).
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, also cyclin) is a 36kD nuclear protein
which has been demonstrated to be a co-factor for DNA polymerase 8 [Bravo et al.
1987] and is essential for the synthesis of DNA during the S phase of cell division.
PCNA is detectable immunocytochemically only in S phase and may be used as a
naturally occurring marker for cell proliferation [Galand & Degraef 1989][Thaete et al.
1989], Based on fixation procedures two forms of PCNA can be visualised in cultured
cells [Bravo & MacDonald-Bravo 1987].

Fig 1.5 Cyclin and MPF levels fluctuate during the cell cycle
This simplified graph shows relative levels of MPF (blue) and cyclin (red) as they
change during the lifetime of the cell. MPF kinase activity is required to initiate mitosis
while proteolysis of cyclin proteins triggers the cell to exit mitosis. [Modified from
Murray & Hunt 1993].
In mammals, many cyclin families exist, however only two have been linked to
the regulation of mitotic onset: the A and B cyclin families [Pagano et al. 1992][Girard
et al. 1991], These families show weak sequence homology to each other and have
different patterns of gene expression but both can bind to the kinase protein and activate
its catalytic activity [Pagano et al. 1992] [Draetta et al. 1988], The significance of
having two cyclin families and any different effects they have on the catalytic subunit
substrate specificity remains unclear. However it is known that cyclins are necessary for
the M phase-specific activity of the kinases [Pagano et al. 1992][Girard et al. 1991], A
and B cyclins share a sequence near the N-terminal domain, termed a "cyclin destruction
box". When this sequence is deleted, resultant mutant cyclins are not targeted for
proteolysis at the appropriate part ofM-phase [Murray et al. 1989], When no destruction
of cyclins occurs, the M-phase kinases remain active and the cell is unable to exit
mitosis [Murray et al. 1989],
Finally, much work has focused on identifying proteins phosphorylated by M-phase
kinases, in order to try and further elucidate the M-phase pathway. Interestingly in vitro
studies have shown linker histone protein HI to be a target for M-phase kinase activity
[Lohka et al. 1988]. It is easy to envisage a system whereby the phosphorylation status
ofHI is linked to the changes in chromatin structure occurring during the cell cycle for
two reasons:
(a) the phosphorylation status of HI predictably changes during the cell cycle (2
phosphate groups are added during S phase and 4 phosphate groups are added
during mitosis) and
(b) HI is one of four histone proteins around which DNA winds to form
nucleosomes, the building block of chromatin [Lohka et al. 1988] (See Section
[1.10] for discussion on histone HI and nucleosomal structure).
Having briefly outlined some aspects of the eukaryotic cell cycle, the discussion
again returns to cell differentiation, and the overturning of dogma stating the
differentiated state of the mammalian somatic cell is irreversible.
Chromatin condensation has been observed in chromosomes in hybrid cells
produced by fusing cells in different stages of the cell cycle [Johnson & Rao 1971], The
molecular basis for such changes is unknown despite the biochemistry of histones and
other chromatin associated proteins having been intensely studied. At present, this field
is still lacking an in vitro system that can reproduce chromatin condensation. More on
chromatin structure and nuclear reprogramming is detailed in Section [1.10].
[1.4] Differentiated state of the mammalian somatic cell is plastic
It has been known for 37 years that the nuclei of amphibian differentiated cells
could be reprogrammed to pluripotency by nuclear transfer [Gurdon & Uehlinger 1966],
For a long time this technique was applied unsuccessfully to mammalian somatic cells,
until in 1981 Illmensee & Hoppe reported the cloning of mice by injecting donor nuclei
from ICM cells into enucleated zygotes. Attempts to repeat this work failed [McGrath &
Solter 1984][Tsunoda et al. 1987], and after allegations from his own staff, Illmensee
was charged with scientific fraud. Tsunoda & Kato (1993) tried to clone mice by
transferring nuclei from Embryonic Stem cells to enucleated zygotes and also failed.
McGrath and Solter (1983) did generate live mice when they injected a zygote donor
nucleus into a enucleated zygote, but they could not obtain any successful development
when they used donor cell nuclei from later developmental stages. The reason for these
failures is now understood: oocytes have a greater nuclear reprogramming activity than
zygotes [Gurdon & Byrne 2003]. Despite previous successful amphibian experiments
using oocytes, early nuclear transfer experiments in the mammal used zygotes as nuclear
donors.
More recently however, several observations have shown that a mammalian
somatic cell's differentiated state may indeed be reprogrammed to reacquire
developmental potential. These cases fall into two groups, in the first group the nuclei
are reprogrammed when exposed to a foreign cytoplasm:
a) Nuclei of somatic cells taken from adult mammals are capable of directing
normal development following fusion with enucleated oocytes [Wilmut et al.
1997],
b) Fusion of murine Embryonic Germ (mEG) [Tada et al. 1997] or murine
Embryonic Stem (mES) cells with thymocytes [Tada et al. 2001] [Gallagher &
McWhir, Unpublished data] or splenocytes [Matveeva et al. 1998] produces
hybrid cells where the epigenetic status of the somatic nucleus is thought to be
heritably altered. Tada et al. (1997) showed that the DNA methylation patterns
of the hybrid nucleus are different from those of the unfused somatic nucleus
indicating that pluripotent stem cells may carry reprogramming activity.
The second group contains other cases where exposure to foreign cytoplasm is not
apparent, but evidence for somatic cell plasticity still exists:
(c) Adult haematopoietic stem cells, when injected into early embryos are
assimilated into chimeric haematopoietic system and are reprogrammed to
express the embryonic repertoire of gene expression in haematopoiesis [Geiger et
al. 1998],
(d) After transplantation into irradiated hosts, cells from the central nervous
system can contribute to haematopoiesis [Bjornson et al. 1999].
Mammalian cells known as pluripotent embryonic cells, give rise to all
embryonic cell types and may be grown in vitro indefinitely in a primitive
undifferentiated state [As reviewed by Smith 2001], Such cells have become a powerful
tool in every aspect of mammalian developmental biology and medicine and are
essential to the work done in this thesis. The history, function, development and
potential of these cells will now be discussed.
[1.5] Self-renewing pluripotent cells in mammals: ES, EG and EC cells
[1.5.1] Teratocarcinomas and murine embryonal carcinoma cells
Kleinsmith and Pierce (1964) discovered that cells other than the zygote could
give rise to several cell types compising all three embryonic germ layers. This group
isolated an undifferentiated pluripotent cell type, known as the Embryonal Carcinoma
(EC) cell, from murine teratocarcinomas (malignant germ cell tumours that displayed
chaotic, unregulated differentiation of cells). Murine EC cells were found to be immortal
and could be expanded in culture [Hogan 1976], which allowed their characterisation.
Clonally derived and expanded murine EC cells possess the capacity to differentiate and
produce derivatives of all three primary germ layers both in vitro [Martin & Evans 1975]
[Finch & Ephrussi 1967] and after injection into adult mice [Kleinsmith & Pierce 1964].
Even more intriguingly, when reintroduced back into the developing embryo, it was
found that some murine EC cell lines could contribute to embryogenesis and participate
in the formation of a range of tissues to the extent that viable chimeric animals could be
produced [Brinster 1974], Most EC cell lines however did not display this differential
potential either in vitro or in vivo and contributed poorly to chimeras [Smith 2001]. It
was also observed that EC cells were almost always aneuploid [Smith 2001].
Thus, EC cells gave rise to the concept of a self-renewing pluripotent stem cell.
Soon however the thereurapeutic potential of EC cells and their value as a model for
mammalian development was questioned as the cells were derived from malignant
tumours and displayed karyotypic abnormalities. Researchers sought to isolate a
pluripotent cell type with a stable, normal karyotype that could be maintained and
expanded in culture.
[1.5.2] Origins and characteristics of murine embryonic stem and germ cells
It was noted that teratocarcinomas develop from ectopically transplanted
blastocysts and spontaneously from Primordial Germ Cells in some mouse tissue strains,
and it was hypothesised that progeny of PGCs and blastocyst cells could also be
pluripotent. This proved to be true and two additional murine pluripotent cell types,
termed Embryonic Germ (EG) [Matsui et al. 1992] and Embryonic Stem (ES) cells
[Evans & Kaufman 1981][Martin 1981], were isolated from primordial germ cell and
blastocyst explants respectively.
Murine ES and EG cells were found to have similar properties to EC cells:
(a) they are derived from pluripotent cell populations;
(b) they are immortal and can be propagated indefinitely in an undifferentiated state
given correct culture conditions;
(c) homogeneous populations of these cells are capable of spontaneously
differentiating into cell types associated with all three primary germ layers of the
embryo;
(d) they are tumorigenic when injected into adult mice.
Thus researchers had achieved their aim of isolating self-renewing pluripotent stem cells
that were derived from non-transformed tissue and were karyotypically stable.
Murine ES cells can generate all cell types of the foetus including the germline
[Bradley et al. 1984][Nagy et al. 1991], Whether they are actually totipotent like the
zygote remains in question, as murine ES cells contribute poorly to extra-embryonic
tissues and no reports of spontaneous differentiation to trophoblast cells have been
reported. Despite this, murine ES cells can participate fully and consistently into
embryogenesis when returned into an early embryo, even after they have been
genetically manipulated. Using either blastocyst injection or morula aggregation,
chimeric offspring have been generated where the ES cells give rise to all cell types of
thefoetus, including functional gametes [Bradley et al. 1984]. Mouse ES cells have been
used to introduce gene knock-outs and other precise genomic modifications into the
mouse germ line via homologous recombination in order to study the function of
specific genes [as reviewed by Babinet & Cohen-Tannoudji 2001]. Thus ES cells have
become a very important and commonly used tool for engineering the mouse genome.
Such ES cell-based technology would prove useful for genetic engineering in many
other vertebrate species but as yet proven ES cells colonising the germ line have only
been established for mouse [Evans & Kaufman 1981][Martin 1981]. Failure of
traditional isolation methods to generate ES cells in other species has fuelled the desire
to create them in vitro via nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells.
[1.5.3] Propagation and differentiation of murine ES cells
Observations were made initially with murine EC [Martin & Evans 1975], ES
[Evans & Kaufman 1981][Martin 1981] and EG [Matsui et al. 1992] cells that cells grew
better and maintained their pluripotent state longer when co-cultured with fibroblasts. It
was reasoned that such cells provide essential nutrients and growth factors and were
called "feeder" cells.
Coculture with feeder cells was initially thought to be necessary to maintain
murine ES cells in an undifferentiated state. In 1987 however, Smith & Hooper showed
that feeder-conditioned medium was sufficient and physical contact with the feeders was
not required. It was reasoned that the feeders secreted a factor that suppressed
differentiation in mES cells. This factor, a cytokine called leukaemia inhibitory factor
(LIF), was subsequently identified [Williams et al. 1988] [Smith et al. 1988]. Murine ES
cells are now routinely cultured in LIF-supplemented medium (See Subsection [2.1.1.1]
for details). If LIF is removed from the culture medium, ES cells rapidly differentiate
[Williams et al. 1988], Upon withdrawl of both LIF and stromal contact, ES cells readily
form spherical cellular aggregates of differentiated cell types called embryoid bodies.
The formation of such bodies is characteristic of the ES cell phenotype.
[1.5.4] Isolation, culture and characterisation of human ES cells
Human ES cell (hES) lines have now been isolated in several laboratories throughout
the world [Thomson et al. 1998][Reubinoff et al. 2000] [Richards et al. 2002] [Amit &
Itskovitz-Eldor. 2002] [Amit et al. 2000]. At the present time, a relatively small number
of ES cell lines has been completely characterised but enough work has been down to
show that human ES cells are different from their murine counterparts in several ways:
(a) human ES cells differentiate into cells of extra-embryonic tissues. Two
laboratories have reported that differentiated cells secret chorionic
gonoadotrophin, a hormone only secereted by extra-embryonic tissues
[Reubinoff et al. 2000] [Thomson et al. 1998], Xu et al. (2002) has now shown
hES cells can be differentiated into trophoblast cells in the presence of growth
factor BMP-4. In contrast, mES cells rarely differentiate into extra-embryonic
cell lineages and there is no report of wild type mES cells forming trophoblast
cells. See Section [1.6] for more on how trophoblast cells were derived from
transgenically manipulated mES cells.
(b) hES cells express a different array of cell markers to mES cells [as reviewed by
Carpenter et al. 2003]. For example, undifferentiated mES cells express the
SSEA-1 epitope in the undifferentiated state and the SSEA-4 epitope when they
differentiate into some cell types (primative endoderm), whereas human ES cells
express the two epitopes in a reciprocal fashion [Thomson et al. 1998] [See
Section 2.1.1 for further details. Human ES cells bear a much closer resemblance
to human EC lines, like NTERA2, in terms of marker expression [Henderson et
al. 2002].
(c) Differentiation of hES cells is not suppressed in LIF-supplemented medium.
Reubinoff et al. 2000 reported that LIF had no effect on growth or differentiation
of established hES lines. Again this is reminescent of hEC lines [Henderson et al.
2002].
(d) hES cells self renewal requires feeders or bFGF-supplemented, feeder-
conditioned medium [Lebkowshi et al. 2001][Amit & Itskovitz-Eldor 2002],
There are some limitations and frustrations currently associated with human ES
cell research. For ethical reasons, one cannot truly verify that these lines are human
embryonic stem cells (i.e. that they are capable of contributing to all cells of the
conceptus including the germ-line) as this would require generating a chimeric human.
There is also significant variability displayed between currently available lines: there
have been many reports of spontaneous differentiation and cell death during routine
culture; some lines lack the ability to form embryoid bodies [Reubinoff et al. 2000]; and
some lack the ability to grow in feeder-conditioned medium. The extent to which this
variability between lines is caused by intrinsic factors related to the cells (eg. genetic
background of the cells or their epigenetic status) or just purely technical differences
such as variations in blastocyst quality and/or suboptimal isolation/expansion conditions,
will presumably not be known for some time to come.
Despite these challenges, the potential of human ES cells both for treatment of
human disease and for studying early human embryonic development continues to
strongly motivate researchers in the field (See Fig 1.1). Technical difficulties are
gradually being surmounted: hES cells can now be efficiently cloned from single cells
[Amit et al. 2000]; conditions for efficiently transfecting these cells have been identified
[Smith-Arica et al. 2003][Zwaka & Thomson 2003]; and gene targeting has been
demonstrated [Zwaka & Thomson 2003],
[1.6] The maintenance of pluripotency and the Oct-4 gene
Although the differentiated state ofmammalian somatic cells is now known to be
reversible [Evidence for this is reviewed in Section 1.9], the mechanisms by which
developmental potential can be artificially reinstated have yet to be elucidated. In mouse
and human cells, maintenance of the pluripotent state of cells is dependent on the
expression of the Oct-4 gene. The expression patterns and regulation of this gene will
now be discussed.
Expression of Oct-4 is required to maintain murine embryonic stem and germ
cells in a pluripotent state. This gene is expressed in cells from the Inner Cell Mass,
Primordial Germ Cells (PGC), Embryonic Germ (EG), Embryonic Stem (ES) and
Embryonal Carcinoma (EC) cells of the mouse. It encodes a POU transcription factor
that binds a specific octomeric sequence ofDNA (ATGCAAAT) [Herr et al. 1988].
Oct-4 was initially identified as a DNA binding activity in extracts from ES and
EC cells [Lenardo et al. 1989][Scholer et al. 1989], It is known to interact with a range
of other transcription factors to alter gene activity important to early embryonic
development e.g. a,(3 HMG, Sox-2, FGF-4, Osteopontin, Rex-1, UTF-1 [Reviewed by
Pesce & Scholer 2000].
Oct-4 expression is stringently regulated both temporally and spatially during
early murine embryogenesis. Fig 1.6 shows a simplified schematic of the main steps in
early mouse embryonic development where changes in Oct-4 expression occur. Low
concentrations of the Oct-4 transcription factor are found in the oocyte and the zygote
and in all cells of the early embryo for the first two divisions [Palmieri et al. 1994]. At
the 8-cell stage, however, an increase of Oct-4 expression occurs and high
concentrations of the transcription factor are observed in all nuclei until the compaction
of the morula [Yeom et al. 1991].

Fig 1.6 Early embryonic development in the mouse
The mouse embryo is the embryo of choice for the study of mammalian development.
Not only has the embryology of the mouse been studied extensively, but mouse genetics
and genetic manipulation are readily conducted. Early murine embryonic development
can be divided into five stages: fertilisation (where egg and sperm fuse); cleavage
(where the zygote rapidly divides forming a morula and later a blastocyst); gastrulation
(where the three germ layers [ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm] are formed);
neurulation (where the nervous system begins to develop); and somatogenesis (where
further differentiation of cells into many somatic cell types occurs). Double arrows
indicate continued development has been omitted for clarity.
Oct-4 expression then becomes confined to cells of the Inner Cell Mass (ICM)
and is down regulated in the trophectoderm [Palmieri et al. 1994]. After implantation,
Oct-4 is highly expressed in the epiblast (also referred to as the primitive ectoderm)
[Yeom et al. 1996]. Furthermore, during gastrulation Oct-4 expression decreases
dramatically in all cells but the primordial germ cells (PGCs) [Ginsberg et al. 1990]. It
is suspected that unidentified intracellular signals within the embryo initiate the
repression of Oct-4 expression and that PGCs are the only cells to maintain high Oct-4
expression after gastrulation due to their absence from the embryo at this developmental
stage.
In mouse embryos where Oct-4 expression has been silenced, the ICM fails to
form after 3.5 days of gestation, causing death of the embryos [Nichols et al. 1998].
Without the normal levels of the Oct-4 transcription factor, cells of the morula
differentiate into the trophectodermal lineage, and compartmental isolation of
pluripotent stem cells of the blastocyst does not occur [Nichols et al. 1998], Niwa et al.
2000 has shown that when Oct-4 is over-expressed in mouse ES cells, the cells
differentiate into primitive endoderm and mesoderm.

Fig 1.7 Regulatory elements involved in Oct-4 expression
Distal and proximal enhancer elements lie upstream of the promoter. The distal
enhancer is active in PGCs while the proximal enhancer is active in EC cells, and both
enhancers are active in cells from the ICM and ES cells. Both the proximal enhancer and
promoter contain sequences important for retinoic acid induced differentiation (RARE1
and RAREOct). Within RAREOct, there are two binding sites for transcription factor
SP1, a possible regulator ofOct-4 activity in EC cells.
The mechanism responsible for regulating Oct-4 expression has been partially
elucidated using Oct-4/lacZ transgenes [Yeom et al. 1996]. As Fig 1.7 shows, two
regulatory elements, the "distal" and "proximal" enhancers, are found upstream of the
Oct-4 gene. Experiments using transgenic mice containing Oct-4 reporter constructs
showed that the distal enhancer is active in PGCs and some ES cell lines, while the
proximal enhancer is active in ES and EC cells (EG cells were not tested) [Yeom at al.
1996]. Both enhancers are active in cells from the ICM. Other work suggests that the
distal enhancer may not be required for Oct-4 promoter activity in ES cells. McWhir et
al. (1996) used pOct/reol, a plasmid containing a sequence including only the Oct-4
promoter and the proximal enhancer, to successfully isolate embryonic stem cells from
refractory genotypes while killing differentiated cells in drug selection. This selective
ablation strategy relies on Oct-4 promoter activity driving the drug resistance gene and
suggests that the promoter can promote the necessary expression of the neo gene without
the distal enhancer.
All developmental models of how Oct-4 acts as a molecular switch activating
and repressing gene expression have until recently been binary e.g. "the totipotent cycle"
model [as discussed in Pesce et al. 1998, Pesce et al. 1999]. The model states that either
an ES cell expresses Oct-4 above a certain level and retains its totipotent state, or else
the level of expression is below the threshold and the cell differentiates [As reviewed by
Brehm et al. (1998)]. Now it is thought that Oct-4 is involved in three, and not two,
distinct developmental fates of ES cells [Niwa et al. 2000] [Pesce & Scholer 2001].
Niwa et al. (2000) generated transgenic ES lines where the expression of Oct-4 is
controlled by addition or withdrawal of the antibiotic, tetracycline (tetracycline-
mediated regulation of gene expression is discussed in Chapter [8]). These researchers
report outcomes predicted by the totipotent cycle, namely Oct-4 expression below a
certain threshold results in differentiation into trophectoderm, and if it is just above then
the cell maintains an ES phenotype. Interestingly, they also reported that when Oct-4 is
expressed at an even higher level above the threshold, differentiation into primitive
endoderm and mesoderm occurs [Niwa et al. 2000].
The mechanism behind such regulation of cell fate has yet to be elucidated,
although Oct-4 is known to regulate expression and repression of many genes involved
in development [Ben-Shushan et al. 1998][Pesce et al. 1998],
All-trans retinoic acid induces murine EC and ES cells to differentiate [Barkai et
al. 1986], This chemical is used to investigate in vitro differentiation in cell hybrids
from murine and human cells in this thesis. Much work has been done to elucidate the
underlying mechanism of this process with the hope of finding out more about how the
differentiation is regulated.
PGCs, ES, EG and EC cells as well as cells from the ICM strongly express Oct-
4. In experiments where ES and EC cells are induced to differentiate, expression of Oct-
4 is switched off rapidly [Okamoto et al. 1990][Rosner et al. 1990][Scholer et al. 1990].
All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces murine EC and ES cells to differentiate
while concomitantly down-regulating Oct-4 expression [Strickland & Mahdavi 1978]
[Strickland et al. 1980]. The study of RA induced EC differentiation has revealed that
differentiation may be induced by one of two cA-acting mechanisms. One involves the
binding of transcription factors to the Retinoic Acid Regulatory Element 1 (RARE1)
within the Oct-4 promoter causing down regulation of Oct-4 [Schoorlemmer et al.
1994] and the other results in Oct-4 enhancer deactivation after nuclear factors bind to a
sequence which lies outside the promoter (RAREOct) [Pikarsky et al. 1994]. It is
possible that both repression pathways are differentially used at various developmental
stages to regulate Oct-4 expression.
Studies have shown that certain transcription factors, termed SF1 proteins, play a
part in up-regulating Oct-4 expression in EC cells [Barnea et al. 2000]. Two distinct SF1
binding sites, SFl(a) and SFl(b), have been located within the RAREOct sequence
located within the Oct-4 promoter (See Fig 1.7). Previously ligands responsible for
down-regulation of Oct-4 promoter activity (eg. COUP-TF1, ARP-1, heterodimers of
retinoic acid receptor and ryanodine receptor) have been found in the same region. It has
been shown that SF1 and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function cooperatively to
transactiviate the Oct-4 promoter and that both SF1 and Oct-4 expression are down
regulated in EC cells treated with RA. It is now hypothesised that SF-1 positively
regulates Oct-4 in EC cells [Strickland & Mahdavi 1978][Strickland & Mahdavi 1980].
[1.7] Nuclear Reprogramming in Development and Pathology
One example of nuclear reprogramming which occurs naturally during
mammalian embryo development is observed in the zygote [Schultz et al. 1999]. The
mammalian sperm and oocyte (both highly differentiated cell-types) fuse to generate the
zygote, a cell which is then capable of generating totipotent daughter cells [Kelly 1977].
Nuclear reprogramming also occurs during the generation of teratocarcinomas. Such
tumours are thought to arise from germ cells that have undergone dedifferentiation to a
pluripotent state [Damjanov 1983], Thus teratocarcinomas can be thought of as the result
of inappropriate nuclear reprogramming. These tumours can also be produced
experimentally by injection of ES or EG cells into ectopic sites of a syngeneic animal. In
non-transformed somatic cells, once the differentiation programme of a cell has started,
the process is normally irreversible. However, this program may be reversed artificially.
Certain developmental processes remodel chromatin. Some of these do not alter
developmental potential but are required for normal development. Three such
phenomena, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and telomere maintenance
are essential to normal development. These processes are coupled with differentiation
and change epigenetic patterns that alter the capacity for gene expression. Imprinting
and X-chromosome inactivation will be discussed here in the context of normal
development. Later these phenomena will be readdressed in the context of the
experimental induction of nuclear reprogramming (Section [1.11]).
[1.7.1] Genomic Imprinting in Mammalian Development
Imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism regulating expression or repression of
some genes according to their parental origin [McGrath & Solter 1984], This
phenomenon has been reported in mammals, seed plants and some insect species [Reik
& Surani 1989], In mammals, the majority of imprinted genes, for which a function has
been identified, code for proteins involved in embryonic development [as reviewed by
Tilghman 1999]. Mammalian imprinted genes are often expressed in the placenta, the
primary tissue regulating transfer of nutrients from mother to embryo [Tilghman 1999],
As with nuclear reprogramming, the mechanism by which imprinting takes place
is poorly understood, although it is observed to be associated with methylation of
specific DNA sequences and changes in chromatin structure.
Methylation of specific DNA sequences is involved in the mechanism by which
mammalian genes are imprinted. Normal imprinting of several genes (H19, Igf2, Igf2r,
and Snrpri) is disrupted in methyltransferase-deficient mice [Li et al. 1993], Specific
CpG islands, where allelic differences in methylation occur, are found in all imprinted
genes studies to date [Sherman & Pillus 1997], Such CpG islands are termed
'Differentially Methylated Regions' (DMRs). However, imprinting is possible without
DNA methylation in Drosophila [Bishop & Jackson 1996] suggesting that imprinting is
not necessarily the result of gene methylation in all species where imprinting occurs.
The functional significance of methylation in imprinting has been assessed via
two strategies: (a) insertion into nuclei of transgenes containing sequences known to
affect imprinting and (b) investigation of changes of imprinting when partial deletions of
Differentially Methylated Regions of DNA (DMRs) are introduced using homologous
recombination in ES cells. To date, these strategies have failed to clarify the relationship
between methylation and imprinting.
In addition to CpG island methylation, chromosomal structure has also been
shown to affect imprinting. Shibata et al. (1996) showed that imprinting in mice is
dependent on chromatin structure in experiments characterising the activity of the
imprinted gene U2afl-rsl. Analysis of DNasel hypersensitivity of the U2afl-rsT s
promoter showed an open chromatin confirmation only on the unmethylated, expressed
paternal allele [Shibata et al. 1996],
Imprinting is regulated by both cis- and trans- acting elements [Reik & Surani
1989], CA-acting elements such as Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) are
reported to be requirements for imprinting in a variety of mammals [Feinberg et al.
1980] and it has become clear that both local and regional chromosomal elements
interact. Trans acting factors, such as DNA methylase, are implicated in experiments
where the activity of specific transactivating factors appears to be diluted when
additional imprinted genes are introduced. For example, when researchers introduced
plasmids containing the imprinted gene Igf2 into cells already containing this gene in its
genome methylation states of both introduced transgenic and endogenous copies of the
gene were reduced [Sun et al. 1997], Introduction of plasmids containing another
imprinted gene, U2af bp-rsl, into imprinted male cells also caused a reduction in the
methylation of genomic copies of the gene [Hatada & Mukai 1997]. Methylase activity
is unchanged with the introduction of DMR containing transgenes, but the methylation
states of endogenous sequences are altered. It is thought that methylation status may be
dependent on the equilibrium of various competing factors acting at the same genes
[Reik & Walter 1998].
Models currently postulated to explain the imprinting mechanism support
observations that methylation and chromatin structure affect imprinting, but are based on
several unproved assumptions, for example the most popular model "mutual exclusion"
[Feil & Khosla 1999] Fig 1.8 (overleaf), is based on at least three assumptions:
(a) Methylation is a causal element in imprinting.
(b) Specific proteins interact with genes on the basis ofmethylation status ofDMRs
associated with the genes.
(c) Such methylation-state sensitive proteins modify chromatin structure thus
regulating gene activity.

Figure 1.8 Mutual exclusion model ofmammalian gene imprinting
Modified from Feil & Khosla (1999), the diagram illustrates the simplest scenario where
one differentially methylated region (DMR) is contained within the imprinted locus e.g.
intronic DMRs of murine HI9 and Igf2 genes. According to the model, the methylation
state of DMRs associated with imprinted loci determine whether specific protein factors
interact with the DNA. Such interactions lead to changes in chromatin structure allowing
the differential expression of one parental allele. The diagram shows a case where
methylation of the DMR allows methylation-sensitive proteins to interact with DNA.
These proteins alter chromatin structure to allow interaction with one or more
transcription factors. This allows transcription i.e. allele B is transcribed. Allele A is not
expressed as the DMR from parent B is not methylated and no changes in chromatin
structure occur.
Another theory suggests that RNA encoded by regions adjacent to DMRs might
be involved in the imprinting mechanism [Wutz et al. 1997]. This idea is based on the
observation that DMRs in mammals are sometimes found to overlap with regions which
generate non-coding or missense RNAs [Wutz et al. 1997] [Moore et al. 1997], This
theory also assumes that methylation is a causal element in imprinting.
[1.7.2] X-chromosome Inactivation in Mammalian Development
In somatic cells of normal female mammals, one of the two X-chromosomes is
programmed to remain transcriptionally silent and not to respond to signals eliciting
transcription in the other, active X chromosome. As a result, XX females and XY males
effectively have equal doses of X-linked gene products in their cells. The process by
which one X chromosome is programmed to remain transcriptionally silent is termed X-
chromosome inactivation.
At the beginning of embryonic development in the mouse and human, both X-
chromosomes are in the active state, and their differentiation into active and inactive
forms occurs at the blastocyst stage in the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm
lineages. The paternally derived X-chromosome is preferentially inactivated in these
cells (imprinted XCI). Later in development, XCI is also initiated in cells of the
primitive ectoderm. These cells will give rise to the embryo proper, and, in contrast to
earlier XCI, both paternally derived and maternally derived X-chromosomes stand an
equal chance of being inactivated (random XCI).
The X chromosome to be inactivated translates a non-coding RNA from the Xist
(X inactive specific transcript) gene and this RNA coats the chromosome and is
necessary and sufficient for inactivation of the chromosome [Lee and Jaenisch 1986],
Once initiation of XCI has occurred, the same X-chromosome remains inactive in all the
mitotic descendants of each cell during the lifetime of the mammal. The inactivated X-
chromosome (Xi) displays several features not associated with the active chromosome:
overall transcriptional inactivation except for Xist and a small number of X-linked genes
[Graves & Gartler 1986]; heterochromatic condensation during interphase [Barr &
Bertram 1949]; late chromatin replication [Takagi & Oshimura 1973]; histone H3/H4
hypoacetylation [Jeppesen & Turner 1993]; specific histone methylation (MeK9H3)
[Boggs et al. 2002]; variant histone macroH2A incorporation [Mermoud et al. 1999];
and DNA methylation of CpG islands [Monk 1986], The mechanism by which Xist
RNA stably prevents transcription from the inactivated chromosome is unknown and
effort is currently being focused on this area.
[1.7.3] Telomere maintenance in Mammalian Development
Another form of nuclear programming involves the maintenance of the ends of
chromosomes. As a stem cell differentiates, the resultant progeny down-regulate the
expression of enzymes required for the maintenance of chromosomal ends. This down-
regulation prevents the cell from replicating indefinitely and can be viewed as
programming a cell to senesce after a given number of cell divisions [Olovnikov 1973]
[Harley 1991],
Telomeres are structures formed by multiple DNA sequences found at the ends
of eukaryotic chromosomes that serve to stabilise the ends on linear DNA and allow
DNA replication. Conventional DNA polymerases cannot replicate the extreme 5' ends
of chromosomes because removal of the most terminal RNA primer in the lagging strand
leaves a small region of uncopied DNA [Levy et al. 1992], Thus, over time in the
absence of a specialist mechanism, chromosomes shorten until a stage is reached that too
much DNA has been removed and the cell senesces. There is however a mechanism in
mammalian cells that can prevent this scenario occurring, allowing certain cells to
replicate indefinitely. This mechanism involves ribonucleoprotein enzymes called
telomerases that add DNA repeat sequences to G-rich sequences within the telomere.
Such replenishment is carefully regulated and the result is telomeric length is maintained
through rounds of DNA replication.
In addition to stabilising chromosome ends, telomeres also have other less well
defined functions: they prevent the potentially detrimental recombination of
chromosome ends and broken DNA strands [Lo et al. 2002]; and they are involved in
chromosome pairing during meiosis [Scherthan et al. 1996].
Normal somatic cells do not display telomerase activity and consequently have a
finite number of times they can replicate their DNA in vitro before senescing [Harley et
al. 1991]. In contrast other normal cell types (i.e. stem cells and germ cells) display
telomerase activity and possess an increased capacity to replicate [Hiyama et al. 1995],
When stem cells differentiate, their telomerase activity declines and their replicative
capacity is decreased. This drop in telomerase activity is due to decreased transcription
of the TERT gene that codes for the catalytic subunits of telomerase [Mattson et al.
2000],
[1.8] Artificially Induced Nuclear Reprogramming
Induction of nuclear reprogramming in differentiated somatic cells could
provide isogenic replacement cells to treat a variety of diseases [See Fig 1.1]. Using
nuclear transfer [Campbell et al. 1996], cell fusion [Tada et al. 1997], or exposure to
cellular extract [Hakelien et al. 2002] it is possible to artificially and heritably alter a
cell's capacity for gene expression by altering the nucleus's epigenetic state. These
techniques may be termed "artificial methods of nuclear reprogramming" [Fig 1.9].

1996], permeablisation & exposure to cellular extracts [Hakelien et al. 2002], and
transdifferentiation [Theise et al. 2000].
[1.8.1] Nuclear Transfer
Spemann (1938) originally suggested transplantation of nuclei between cells
as a technique to study the role of genetic material in cellular differentiation. Nuclei
from fully differentiated mammalian somatic cells can now be fully reprogrammed,
with totipotency restored, using nuclear transfer [Wilmut et al. 1997]. The technique
has generated viable animals using eight mammalian species to date: sheep [Wilmut
et al. 1997], mouse [Wakayama et al. 1998], cow [Kato et al. 1998], pig [Campbell
et al. 2000], goat [Bagiuisi et al. 1999], rabbit [Chesne et al. 2002], cat [Gomez et al.
2003], horse [Galli et al. 2003] and rat [Vogel et al. 2003]. The nuclei of these
offspring contain genomes of identical sequence to that of the nuclear donor. This
represents total nuclear reprogramming of the somatic nuclei as the totipotent state is
restored. Otherwise viable offspring could not be generated [Campbell et al. 1999],
It is often overlooked in the literature that nuclear transfer allows only the
nuclear genome to be exactly duplicated in another organism. It does not create exact
genetic replicas of the organism from which the nucleus was taken. Factors like
mitochondrial DNA [Takeda et al. 1999], chromatin conformation and other subtle
epigenetic factors such as methylation / acetylation patterns [Campbell 1999] will
vary from that of the original donor animal due to the cytoplasmic contribution of the
ooplast as well as possible effects inadvertently caused by the procedure itself.
Successful reprogramming of somatic nuclei by placing them in enucleated
oocytes is perhaps not surprising. As previously discussed in Section [1.2], a
mechanism for the removal of epigenetic modifications (excluding gametic imprints)
exists in the zygote. The oocyte and sperm are both highly specialised differentiated
cells, and removal of their epigenetic patterns is essential to allow development of
pluripotent cells from the ICM. It has been speculated that a similar mechanism can
reprogramme a somatic nucleus when it is transplanted to an ooplast [Surani 1999].
Much remains to be learnt about how somatic nuclei are reprogrammed after
being transferred into ooplasts. Thus, at present, the only unequivocal manner in
which one can identify total nuclear reprogramming is to attempt to derive viable
offspring from a reconstituted embryo. The production of "Dolly", the first viable
mammal derived from a reprogrammed adult somatic cell, has illustrated that the
nuclear genome may be completely reprogrammed and totipotency of the nucleus
can be restored.
Many factors are probably responsible for the successful application of the
nuclear transfer technique to reprogramming mammalian nuclei. Some of these have
been identified: structural integrity of the nuclear membrane [Blow & Laskey 1988],
quality and copy number of donor genetic material, chromatin conformation, histone
composition, methylation and acetylation patterns [Reviewed by Campbell (1999)].
Other important variables determining success include the level of M-phase
Promoting Factor (MPF) and the cell cycle stage of the donor nucleus and recipient
oocyte. It has been suggested that frequency of live offspring generation from
reconstructed embryos made by nuclear transfer is improved by placing the donor
nuclei into a quiescent state prior to transfer [Campbell 1996, Campbell et al. 1999].
It is thought that synchronisation of cell cycle stage in the oocyte using serum
starvation minimises chromosomal damage and promotes generation of reconstructed
embryos that divide to produce normal diploid daughter cells [Campbell 1999]. The
successful production of Dolly, the first viable animal to be generated by nuclear
transfer, used a nucleus from a cultured adult differentiated somatic cell which had
been serum starved into quiescence [Wilmut et al. 1997]. When a cell enters
quiescence the histone composition of chromatin [Khochbin & Wolffe
1994][Dimitrov & Wolffe 1996] and the sub-nuclear distribution of chromatin
structural proteins is altered. Pallante (2002) suggests that some aspect of these
changes make the nuclei of quiescent cells more amenable to being reprogrammed.
Whether quiescence is actually required for nuclear reprogramming to take
place is contentious. Wakayama et al. (1998) used mouse cumulus cells, a naturally
quiescent cell population, as nuclear donating cells in successful nuclear transfer
experiments into mouse ooplasts. Kato et al. (1998) generated viable calves via
nuclear transfer in experiments that also used cumulus cells as nuclear donors. In
both of these experiments, the cell cycle stage of the nuclear donors was controlled
although the formal possibility that animals can be generated using non-quiescent
cells as nuclear donors cannot be dismissed. Other researchers claim successful
generation of offspring using nuclei derived from non-quiescent cells [Cibelli et al.
1998]. Also the formal possibility that transferred nuclei transferred in Wakayama's
and Kato's experiments were non-quiescent cannot be eliminated. The controversy
surrounding the role of quiescence is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Experiments by Rideout et al. (2000) show that the number of live mice
generated from cells reprogrammed via nuclear transfer is dependent on the genetics
of the mouse from which the nuclear donor cell is taken. Nuclear transfer
experiments using ES cell nuclei from inbred 129/SvJae mice fail to produce any
offspring, whereas when nuclei from ES cells derived from mice born of 129/SvJae
and C57BL/6 matings were used up to 3% of reconstructed embryos reaching
blastocyst stage generated viable offspring. It may be that the use of inbred animals
as nuclear donors introduces a reprogramming barrier not present in the outbred
strains. Investigating why this occurs might elucidate more about mechanisms
involved in nuclear reprogramming.
[1.8.2] Cytoplasmic injections and incubations
Experiments in which Xenopus ooplasm was injected into Xenopus terminally
quiescent erythrocytes have initiated DNA replication and cell division [Gurdon
1966]. Recent experiments have shown that this re-entry into the cell cycle was
concomitant with removal of linker histones HI and HI0 from erythrocytes
chromatin by nucleoplasmin [Lu & Leno 1999] (See Subsection [1.10.3] and
Subsection [1.11.2] for more on linker histones and nucleoplasmin respectively).
This constitutes an example of nuclear reprogramming.
Hakelien et al. (2002) permeabilised and incubated human fibroblasts in a
cytoplasmic extract derived from primary human thymocytes. They reported that
such incubation altered the gene expression of fibroblasts such that fibroblast specific
genes were silenced and T cell specific genes were expressed. The ATPase activity
of chromatin remodelling complex, BAF, increased when the fibroblasts were
incubated in extract, suggesting that chromatin remodelling may be taking place.
Acetylation of H4 histones (See Subsection [1.11.1] for how histone modification
alters gene expression) at the IL2 promoter was observed, further suggesting
chromatin remodelling. Then they permeabilised and incubated fibroblasts in neural
precursor extract and observed that the fibroblasts began to extend neuronal-like
outgrowths and express neurofilament protein. This also suggests nuclear
reprogramming but the extent to which such phenotypic changes persist is as yet
unknown.
Alteration of gene expression and phenotype has also been extensively
studied in heterokaryons and cell hybrids generated from the fusion of mammalian
cells.
[1.8.3] Cell fusion and hybridisation
Mammalian cell fusion, pioneered by Barski in the 1940s, has been used to
illuminate many cellular processes involving cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions in the
mammalian system [Ying et al. 2002]. When cells are fused they generate
heterokaryons, membrane enclosed bodies where two or more nuclei share the same
cytoplasm. A small proportion of heterokaryons undergo mitosis in such a fashion
that chromosomes from both nuclei became contained in the same nucleus of the
daughter cell. Such a daughter cell is called a cell hybrid (See Fig 1.10).
Fig 1.10 Generating heterokaryons and cell hybrids by cell fusion
After the heterokaryon undergoes mitosis, a hybrid cell can be produced if the
separate nuclear envelopes break down and the chromosomes from the donor species
come together to form a single large nucleus [Ekker et al. 1999].
Rare mitotic event:
Nuclear fusion
resulting in viable
eefl hybrid
Such cell hybrids (also called hybrid cells) are usually karyotypically
unstable and tend to lose chromosomes from one of the two parental species. In
addition, chromosomal elements are often translocated or inserted into chromosomes
from the other parent cell [Ekker et al. 1996],
There are numerous methods for fusing cells and microcells. These may be
classified into four groups based on the nature of the fusagen:
(i) Virally mediated fusion e.g. Sendai" Virus [Homma & Tashiro 1979][Harris &
Watkins 1965],
(ii) Chemical mediated fusion. The most commonly used chemical fusagen is
Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) [Shirahata et al. 1998][Vienken et al. 1982] [Pentecorvo
1975],
(iii) Electrofusion [Finaz et al. 1984].
(iv) Laser mediated fusion [Itagaki et al. 1997].
Electrofusion is frequently the preferred method of fusion not only because
the conditions can be more finely controlled and duplicated but also because reports
have cited it as the most efficient method of fusion [Scott-Taylor et al. 2000][Finaz
et al. 1984], Finaz et al. (1984) reported electrofusion to be more than lOOx more
efficient than the PEG technique at fusing rodent somatic cells.
Parameters for optimising cell electrofusion efficiency can be categorised into
two groups, those altering the immediate electromagnetic environment of the cell
membranes and those that do not. Strength and duration of electric pulse applied are
generally regarded as the most important electromagnetic variables for maximising
cell fusion [Scott-Taylor et al. 2000]. Polarisation of the electrofusion chamber (by
coating one electrode of the cuvette with a thin layer of wax) and application of a
low DC electric field in parallel to the AC exponential have been found to increase
cell fusion efficiency while not affecting cell viability [Scott-Taylor et al. 2000].
Fusion factors not related to the electromagnetic environment of the cell membranes
include conductivity, osmolarity, cell ratio and possibly cell-cell contact
[Zimmerman et al. 1975]. The assumption that cells need to be in contact with each
other, at the time an electric pulse is applied, to induce cell fusion has been refuted
by data presented by several researchers [Scott-Taylor et al. 2000][Teisse & Rols
1986][Sowers 1986]. Application of an electric pulse to cells not in close proximity
and then subsequent centrifugation can generate significant numbers of cell hybrids
[Teisse & Rols 1986], It has been shown that electropulsed cells have a higher fusion
rate when centrifuged up to 40 minutes after the application of a single high intensity
pulse [Sowers 1986], This is, perhaps, surprising given lipid bilayers in an aqueous
environment reform in a matter of micro- or milliseconds when electric pulses are
applied [Benz & Zimmerman 1981]. This rapid reformation occurs due to the
hydrophobic nature of hydrocarbon moieties of phospholipid membranes. The "long-
lived fusogenic state" may be the result of an alternative electropermeable lipid
conformation transiently adopted. Cholesterol and protein content of membranes are
thought to affect the duration with which membranes remain susceptibile to fusion
with membranes from neighbouring cells [Sowers et al. 1986].
Viral entry into a host cell and cellular secretory release are the two
biological processes where membrane fusion have been best studied. A great deal
less is known about the mechanisms responsible for cell membrane-cell membrane
fusion [Shemer and Podbilewicz 2003], There are two contrasting paradigms
explaining how cell membranes fuse: the proximity model holds that the major factor
required for membrane fusion is that the two membranes must be in close proximity
and that membranes fuse in a more or less non-specific manner; whereas the
specificity model holds that the presence of docking proteins in the membrane is the
major determinant governing cell fusion [Jahn & Grubmuller 2002]. This second
model is clearly important for natural syncitia formation of specialised cells such as
myoblasts but it is unclear if docking proteins play a role in the fusion of other cell
types.
Empirically, it has been noticed with many cells types that factors such as cell
size, cell type, osmotic pressures acting against the membrane, and the extracellular
matrices of cells affect cell fusion. The extracellular matrices of cells and how they
can be removed will now be discussed.
In vivo, cells are embedded in an endogenous extracellular matrix called
ground substance. This is secreted by the cells themselves and interaction between
the cells and the matrix is an important factor in the regulation of cell behavior such
as cell proliferation and differentiation [Huang & Ingber 1999], The main
components of ground substance are extracellular proteins (eg. laminin, collagen)
and polysaccharides (eg. hyaluronan). When culturing adherent cells, enzymes like
trypsin and hyaluronidase (see Fig 1.11) are used to disaggregate cells as well as
dislodging the cells from the underlying matrix.

Fig 1.11 Trypsin or hyaluronidase both allow enzymatic disaggregation of
adherent cells
Trypsin disaggregates adherent cells in culture as it breaks down membrane
associated proteins. Hyaluroinidase breaks down the polysaccharide which is a
component of the extra cellular matrix and is frequently used in medicine to increase
the absorption and diffusion of drugs as well as preventing cancerous cells from
metastasing. In nuclear transfer work, it is used to remove cumulus cells from
oocytes. Panel A Trypsin hydrolyses peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of the
amino acids arginine and lysine. Panel B Hyaluronidase hydrolyses the 1,4-linkages
between N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronate residues of the hyaluronate
subunits of the polymer hyaluronan. Each hylauronate subunit consists of a uronic
acid and an amino sugar linked together by alternating beta-1,4 and beta-1,3
glycosidic bonds.
Artificial extracellular matrices
Many adherent cells grown in culture fail to secrete an adequate extracellular
matrix that will perpetuate appropriate growth and differentiation. To deal with this
problem, culture vessels may be coated with artificial matrices prior to being seeded
with cells. Two commonly used solutions used to treat culture vessels in this manner
are gelatin (consisting mainly of denatured collagen) and matrigel (a mixture of
mainly laminin, collagen IV, nidogen/enactin and proteoglycans).
The section dealing with cell hybridisation has been divided into four
subsections for clarity. The sections deal with different types of cell hybrids and
discuss how nuclear reprogramming is illustrated.
[1.8.3.1] Changes in phenotype and gene expression in cell hybrids
Aspects of how cell-specific phenotypes are initiated and maintained can be
examined using heterokaryons and cell hybrids as model systems. Monoclonal
antibodies can be used to study gene expression at the single cell level or in mass
cultures at a biochemical and molecular level. Regulatory mechanisms governing cell
fate and differentiation have been partially elucidated by studying differences among
cell types in the frequency, kinetics, and patterns of gene expression. The results of
both strategies applied to heterokaryons and cell hybrids show that the expression of
genes in the nuclei of differentiated cells is remarkably plastic and susceptible to
modulation by the cytoplasm [Boshart et al. 1993].
Isolation of genetically stable cell hybrids can be achieved using selection for
transgenes integrated in, or against mutations occurring in, only one of the parental
cell types.
Generation of cell hybrids has elucidated three principles of cell
differentiation [Review by Boshart et al. 1993]:
1. Trans-acting factors that regulate gene expression are involved in cell
differentiation.
2. The maintenance of the differentiated state of a cell is a continuing
process requiring a constant supply of transcription factors. This can
be reversed by cell hybridisation.
3. Regulatory mechanisms repress as well as activate cell specific gene
expression.
In intertypic somatic hybrids, genes associated with specialised function are often
shut down. Such repression is termed "extinction" [Davidson et al. 1974], One
interesting example of hybridisation provided the first direct evidence that telomere
length determines proliferative capacity in human cells [Wright et al. 1996].
Extinction of the telomerase gene in hybrids of normal diploid fibroblasts and
immortal cell lines had previously been observed [Berry et al. 1994]. In immortal
cell lines, the ends of the chromosomes (telomeres) are constitutively replenished by
the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase [Counter et al. 1992] while in somatic cell
types, telomere length is found to shorten with age [Lindsey et al. 1991][Vaziri et al.
1994], Cell hybrids of immortal and somatic cells are found to have limited life-span
and this is due to the extinction of the telomerase gene [Wright et al. 1996] [See
Subsection [1.7.3] for more details of telomeres and telomerases]. Treating these cell
hybrids with specific oligonucleotides results in telomere elongation. It is thought
telomere elongation reduces the probability of DNAses cutting into essential
regulatory and expressed sequences in chromosomal DNA and so extends the life
span of the hybrids [Wright et al. 1996], [See Subsection [1.7.3] for an explanation
of the problem of terminal replication of linear DNA].
It was observed that activation of cell-type specific gene expression can also
occur when different cell types are fused [Reviewed by Baron et al. 1996]. However
gene repression is far more commonly observed than activation [Baron et al. 1996],
An interesting example of activation involves fusing erthryoid cells at different
developmental stages [Broyles et al. 1999]. The phenotype of hybrid cells involves
the retention of specific chromosomes [Weiss et al. 1971] and is dependent on the
number of copies of chromosomes retained. For example in hepatoma x fibroblast
hybrids possessing only one hepatic chromosome set, the hepatic phenotype is not
observed; if however the hybrid contains two sets of hepatic chromosomes, it is.
Clearly a delicate equilibrium between positive and negative trans-acting factors
mediates hybrid phenotype [Peterson & Weiss 1972]. It is interesting to juxtapose
these data with similar findings from imprinting experiments injecting transgenes
containing differentially methylated regions (DMRs) [Reik et al. 1999]. Introduction
of such genes alters the methylation status of the chromosomal DNA also indicating
a trans-acting mechanism with a delicate equilibrium [Reik et al. 1999].
The characteristics of cell hybrids generated from somatic cells and
pluripotent embryonic cells will now be summarised.
[1.8.3.2] Pluripotent stem cell hybrids
The literature concerning cell hybrids generated by fusions of EC cells and
somatic cells offers no clear pattern of extinction and activation of cell-specific
genes. Some researchers state that the EC phenotype is dominant in EC cell x
somatic cell hybrids [Takagi et al. 1983], whereas EC specific genes are shown to be
repressed by others [Shimazaki et al. 1993][Ben-Shushan et al. 1993][Rousett et al.
1979]. This is not merely due to differences in selection regime and it has been
assumed that this is due to the genomic variance between EC cell lines. It is hoped
that EG, ES and EC fusions with somatic cells could give rise to pluripotent stem cell
populations eliminating the need for continued isolation of such cells from embryos.
This would greatly decrease the demand for foetal and embryonic material in
scientific research. The genetic abnormality of EC cells will however seriously limit
their use in any new therapy involving nuclear reprogramming.
Another interesting example of nuclear reprogramming in EC x somatic cell
hybrids is associated with the reversible repression of the Oct-4 gene. Oct-4, as
previously discussed, is involved in the maintenance of pluripotency in ES, EG and
EC cells (see Section [1.5]). In fusions between EC cells, where Oct-4 is expressed,
and normal differentiating fibroblasts, where it is not, the extinction of Oct-4
coincides with differentiation of the cell hybrid clones. Introduction of Oct-4 trans-
activating elements (chimeric proteins derived from fusion of the transactivating
domain of Oct-4 and the DNA binding domain of GAL4) into the hybrid cells is
found to elicit phenotypic changes associated with dedifferentiation [Shimazaki et al.
1993], This observation is consistent with the theory that Oct-4 is involved in the
maintenance of the pluripotent state in EC cells.
Fewer publications refer to cell hybrids generated from EG cells. EG cells
display a dominant demethylating effect on somatic chromosomal DNA when fused
with lymphocytes. This includes effects on both imprinted and non-imprinted genes
[Tada et al. 1997]. Germ cells have a strong demethylase activity while lacking
factors that protect specific regions from demethylation [Weiss et al. 1996], The link
between methylation and change in phenotype has been observed but it is not known
how important methylation status is to the nuclear reprogramming mechanism.
7>a/-acting cytoplasmic and possibly nuclear factors are known to be involved
however.
Also reported in EG x somatic cell hybrids is the reactivation of the
maternally silent Peg allele {Peg/Mest is an imprinted gene that is paternally
expressed during development), and extensive demethylation of the inactive X
chromosome derived from the somatic nucleus [Tada et al. 1997]. These epigenetic
changes along with maternal Peg allele activation show chromatin remodelling but
do not further elucidate how nuclear reprogramming may occur.
ES and EG cells are both pluripotent, but they differ in one important respect:
parental imprints are maintained in ES cells while erased in EG cells. Surani (1999)
suggests that in similar experiments involving hybrids between somatic cells and ES
cells, the imprints may not be erased as they are in the presence of ES cells. Tada et
al. 2001 generated hybrids generated from ES and somatic cells that were still able to
contribute to the three embryonic germ layers. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns
were found at imprinted loci in these hybrids highlighting that correct expression of
imprinted genes is not required for reprogramming of somatic nuclei to pluripotency.
[1.8.3.3] Interspecies cell hybrids
Cells more similar in terms of histology and species have a higher efficiency
of in vitro hybridisation than those that are not closely related in experiments using
PEG as a fusagen [Hart 1983]. However, Siroky & Cervenka (1990) report no such
decrease between different mammalian cell types (CHO, HeLa, mouse melanoma
cells and human skin fibroblasts) with electrofusioa
The preparation of monoclonal antibodies is the main practical use of trans-
species hybridisation [Shirahata et al. 1998]. Many different types of chromosome
rearrangements are seen in trans-species somatic hybrids. Fluorescence in situ
hybridisation (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly
used to identify integrated chromosomal elements [Boshart et al. 1993].
[1.8.3.4] Spontaneous cell fusion and the overestimation of adult stem cell
plasticity
Cell fusion in vivo may also explain the apparent plasticity of adult stem
cells. Neural, hematopoietic, or mesenchymal stem cells have been reported to give
rise to developmentally unrelated tissues [Morrison et al. 2001]. Data from coculture
experiments have been interpreted to show myocytes can transdifferentiate into
adipocytes [Hu et al. 1995], pancreatic cells into hepatocytes [Shen et al. 2001],
keratocytes into fibroblasts [Funderburgh et al. 2001] and endothelial cells into
cardiomyocytes [Condorelli et al. 2001]. It is possible that these data may be
explained by spontaneous cell fusion as has been reported elsewhere [Pells et al.
2002][Ying et al. 2002][Terada et al. 2002]. A more recent report by Ianus et al.
2003 shows transdifferentiation of bone marrow cells into glucose-competent
pancreatic endocrine cells where cell fusion is not thought to have occurred based on
results with a Cre-LoxP GFP reporter system. Transdifferentiation and spontaneous
fusion may not be mutually exclusive and the spontaneous fusion data does not
reduce the prospect of adult stem cells being valuable for therapeutic purposes.
[1.9] Heat Shock
Major changes in chromatin structure and gene expression patterns are
induced when cells are temporarily placed in a moderately hyperthermic
environment. Unlike imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, the effects of this
treatment on gene expression do not persist throughout the life time of the cell and
are relatively short lived (typically several hours).
Cells transiently exposed to a temperature a few degrees above physiological
optimum undergo a process termed a heat shock response. The heat shock response
entails major changes in gene expression [Csermely et al. 1994] and chromatin
structure [Iliakis & Pantelias 1989]. The heat shocked cells' capacity to condense
chromatin were decreased (when these cells were fused to interphase cells containing
factors that normally elicit rapid chromatin condensation, they did not do so) [Iliakis
& Pantelias 1989], Additionally changes in both the pattern of gene transcription and
the way mRNAs were recognised for translation resulted in major changes in gene
expression [Craig 1986]. When heat shocked, a cell displays a general increase in
proteolysis, the strong inhibition of most genes expressed before the heat-shock, and
the induction of genes coding for evolutionarily conserved polypeptides termed
"heat-shock proteins" (Hsps). The induction of hsps is rapidly initiated but is
generally short lived in the absence of a continuing stress: hsp synthesis is normally
repressed minutes after induction [As reviewed by Mathew et al. 2000].
The heat shock response was initially observed by Ritossa (1962). Upon
increasing the ambient temperature from 20C to 37C, Ritossa reported several new
puffs appearing in the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila. These were sites of
vigorous RNA transcription with some of the RNA synthesised being translated into
heat shock proteins. Since this discovery, the heat shock response has been found in
all organisms tested including mammals [Craig 1986]. A lot of study has been
devoted to this process in order to learn more about the regulation of gene expression
[as reviewed by Mathew et al. 2000]. This process is termed "heat shock response"
only for historical reasons and is more accurately termed the stress response because
other stressors (i.e anoxia, ethanol, arsensite, heavy metals, amino acid analogues
[Munro & Pelham 1985], puromycin [Hightower 1980], cell confluence [Wantanabe
et al. 1995] and deprivation of cell nutrients [Neuer et al. 2000] can also induce the
process.
Several observations suggest that the heat shock response is of fundamental
biological importance: the heat shock response is observed in all organisms in which
it has been sought, from archebacteria to humans [Craig 1986]; genes coding for
heat shock proteins show highest degree of sequence conservation of any genetic
system known [Lindquist et al. 1988] and heat shock proteins are the first major
products of zygotic transcription in mouse embryos [Bensuade et al. 1983], However
the physiological role of the heat shock response is still unknown despite the
expression levels and structure of heat shock proteins being well characterised. A
long held assumption is that the Hsps serve to protect cells from toxic effects of
stresses. There is indirect evidence to support this view:
(a) The induction of Hsps is extremely rapid and this suggests the role of such
proteins in an emergency response [Lindquist & Craig 1988].
(b) The temperature required to induce Hsp synthesis in an organism is related to
those experienced in the organism's natural environment. For example in
thermophilic bacteria growing optimally at 50C, the Hsp induction temperature
is 60C [Daniels et al. 1985], while in arctic fish living at 0C, very closely
related proteins are induced at 5-10C [Lindquist & Craig 1988]. Mammals
induce heat shock protein expression typically between 39-44C [Li & Laszlo
1985]
(c) The correlation between Hsp synthesis and an acquired thermotolerance was
initially observed in Chinese hamster fibroblasts [Li & Werb 1982] and has since
been shown in many species including human and mouse [Reviewed in Lindquist
& Craig 1988], The papers cited in this review show that cells or organisms are
killed rapidly when shifted from their normal growth temperature to a much
higher temperature, whereas they are killed much more slowly by the same stress
if they are exposed to a mild heat stress beforehand. The assumption many make
on the basis of these data is that heat shock protein synthesis, induced by
exposure to a moderate stress, confer the ability to better deal with additional
more severe stress. However much data refutes this simple hypothesis:
thermotolerance does not always correlate with synthesis of heat shock proteins,
and attempts to identify the role of any one hsp in thermotolerance have failed.
[1.9.1] Heat shock proteins
Heat shock proteins are highly conserved polypeptides that are expressed
immediately after cells have been moderately shocked. Heat shock proteins have
been extensively characterised and are grouped into superfamilies based on their
approximate molecular weight: hsp90s, hsp70s and so called "small" hsps. Some are
involved in protein-protein interactions. In mammals, hsp90s are generally associated
with protein assembly and disassembly, hsp70s have been shown in vivo to remove
clathrin from coated vesicles [Ungewickell et al. 1985][Chappell et al. 1986]. It is
thought that heat inducible proteins, such as hsp72, are involved with reassembling
structures damaged by hyperthermia or other stresses.
The mechanism by which expression of heat shock proteins is induced after
stress involves specific DNA sequences called 'heat shock elements'. These elements
are found within the promoters of heat shock genes. In eukaryotes, heat shock
elements are found upstream of the TATA box, constituting contiguous arrays of the
5-bp sequence NGAAN present in both orientations [Sorger 1991].
Some heat shock proteins have a role in the cell cycle [See Section [1.3]].
Members of the Hsp90 and Hsp70 families show elevated levels in proliferating
mammalian cells and a cell cycle-dependent expression [Helmbrecht 2000]. They
have been shown to interact with cell cycle factors Cdk4, Wee-1, pRb, p53, p27/Kipl
and are involved in the nuclear localisation of regulatory proteins. Small hsps and
their state of phosphorylation and oligomerization also seem to be involved in cell
proliferation and differentiation [Helmbrecht et al. 2000],
The interaction between heat shock proteins and chromatin structure seems to
be bidirectional: the chromatin structure affects hsp expression and this affects
chromatin structure. Hsp90 interacts with histones [Schnaider et al. 1999] and also
induces the condensation of chromatin [Csermely et al. 1994],
The synthesis of heat shock proteins can have deleterious effects if expressed
at the wrong developmental time e.g. if in the mammalian embryo heat shock protein
expression is induced during neural tube development, developmental abnormalities
of the forebrain and eye can occur [Walsh et al. 1991] [Englen & Finnell 1991].
[1.10] Chromatin structure
In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is packaged into a highly organised protein containing
structure. Chromatin is the term used to describe this DNA-protein complex. It is
thought that restoration of totipotency to a cell is mediated in part by changes in
chromatin composition and structure [Clarke et al. 1998].
Genomic DNA from eukaryotic cells is packaged with histones (basic highly
conserved proteins) and also other proteins into chromatin, compacting DNA some
10,000-fold [as reviewed by Zlatanova & Leuba (2003)]. Such condensation ofDNA
changes accessibility to the nuclear machinery that drives processes such as
replication, transcription or DNA repair. Based on historical staining methods
chromatin is generally subdivided into highly condensed heterochromatin, which is
generally associated with genes that are not expressed, and more diffuse
euchromatin, which is generally associated with genes that are.
Chromatin is highly dynamic during development and differentiation.
Chromatin not only acts as a DNA packaging element but also as a controller of
genetic information either presenting an accessible nucleosome structure or by
organising distinct higher order structures that prevent accessibility to underlying
DNA. Nuclear reprogramming mechanisms are thought to induce dedifferentiation
by stably and safely deconstructing such repressive chromatin conformations [as
reviewed by Wade & Kikyo (2002)].
[1.10.1] Lower order chromatin structure
Nucleosomes
Decondensed chromatin viewed in the electron microscope looks like 'beads
on a string'. The string is the DNA helix and the beads are DNA protein complexes
known as nucleosomes [See Fig 1.12 overleaf]. Nucleosomes are the fundamental
structural unit of chromatin and these assemblages are all composed of histones,
other associated proteins and DNA. A nucleosome consists of approximately 1.8
turns ofDNA wound around a core particle of histone proteins. The core particle is a
roughly heart-shaped octamer of 4 types of histones: two each of the H2A, H2B, H3,
and H4 proteins. These core histones are small (Mr 11,000-15,000) basic proteins
that are highly conserved during evolution. Core histones bind DNA very tightly.
The N-terminal tails of core histones modulate DNA accessibility within the
nucleosome and also affect inter-filament interactions resulting in structural and
functional changes within chromatin [Zheng & Hayes 2003], More will be discussed
about posttranslational modifications of core histone tails in Subsection [1.11.5].

Chromatin is composed of DNA specifically packaged as DNA protein complexes
known as nucleosomes. The 10 nm fibre composed of DNA wound around histone
cores. The DNA wound around the histone core is termed 'nucleosomal DNA',
whereas the DNA that stretches between nucleosomes is termed Tinker DNA'.
Histones that bind linker DNA are termed Tinker histones'. 10 nm fibres are tightly
wound together to form a 30 nm fibre.
|1.10.1.1] Nucleoplasmin
Nucleoplasmin is a thermostable histone-binding protein [Laskey et al. 1978]
consisting of over 200 amino acid residues [Dingwall et al. 1987]. It was initially
identified in the nuclei of oocytes and eggs from Xenopus laevis [Laskey et al. 1978],
where it constitutes 9-10% of the total protein produced [Krohne & Franke 1980],
Nucleoplasmin has several cellular functions. It was the first protein to be
termed a "molecular chaperone" [Laskey et al. 1978], Nucleoplasmin binds histones,
shielding their positive charges, preventing non-specific histone-histone interactions
thereby facilitating nucleosome assembly [Laskey et al. 1978]. Nucleoplasmin is
found complexed with histones in vivo [Dilworth et al. 1987] and is required for
nucleosome assembly in vitro where it assembles nucleosomes on naked DNA
[Earnshaw et al. 1980]. As Fig 1.13 outlines, nucleoplasmin and another molecular
chaperone, Nl, are thought to assemble nucleosomes in the amphibian system where
they mediate DNA binding to core histones.

Nucleosomes
Figure 1.13 Proposed pathway of nucleosome assembly in Xenopus eggs.
Both Nl and nucleoplasmin are acidic proteins that have been shown to associate
with histones as indicated [Adapted from Dilworth et al 1987 Cell 51:1009],
Nucleoplasmin is also involved in the decompaction of sperm DNA at
fertilisation. It binds and removes sperm basic proteins, called protamines, from
DNA-protamine complexes in sperm [Iwata et al. 1999]. It also replaces these basic
proteins with histones [Leno et al. 1996], As is the case with the histones,
nucleoplasmin is though to bind specificially to the protamine via its polyglutamic
acid tract.
Nucleoplasmin is known to play an important role in the transfer of proteins
into the nucleus [Dingwall & Laskey 1986]. It is associated with ribonucleoproteins.
Based on this observation, it has been suggested that this protein may also have a
role in post transcriptional events [Moreau et al. 1986].
[1.10.1.2] Linker histones and histone switching during development
Linker histones, also called HI histones, bind both intra-nucleosomal DNA
[See Fig 1.12] and core histone tails [Hill 2001][Kornberg & Lorch 1999]. The
bonds between linker histones and linker DNA are weaker than corresponding
interactions between core histones and nucleosomal DNA. Genes coding for linker
histones also display a lot more sequence variability than highly conserved genes
coding for core histones [Kornberg & Lorch 1999].
Interestingly, during development of many non-mammalian organisms, the
species of linker histones associated with DNA reproducibly changes during
development. There are embryonic and somatic species of linker histones that are
found in chromatin at the embryonic and more developed stages of development
respectively. When associated with chromatin, linker histones influence the
accessibility of regulatory factors to the DNA and play an important role in
controlling gene expression [Clarke et al. 1998][Alami et al. 2003]. The presence of
stage-specific linker histone subtypes in non-mammalian oocyte and embryos,
together with their role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression suggest
that linker histones may play a role in nuclear reprogramming in these species [Fu et
al. 2003].
Linker histones are less well characterised in mammals and their roles in
chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression are at present unclear. Six
linker histone subtypes have been identified in mammalian chromatin [Wang et al.
1997][Parseghian and Hamkalo 2001]. These have been divided into two groups:
somatic linker histones (Hla-e) and the embryonic linker histone HI0. Somatic linker
histones are found in chromatin of oocytes and somatic cells, they share a highly
conserved globular domain and mRNA coding for these histones fluctuates during
the cell cycle, rising sharply during S phase. In contrast, embryonic linker histone
HI0 is expressed highly only in oocytes and some non-dividing cells. It's abundance
in embryonic cells decreases rapidly after the zygote begins to divide [Fu et al.
2003]. HI0 has a larger configuration than somatic linker histones and lacks their
conserved globular domain. Furthermore, the mRNA coding for it maintains a
constant level throughout the cell cycle.
It is now clear that, as in non-mammalian species, linker histone complement
in mammalian chromosomes changes during late oogenesis and early embryogenesis
[Fu et al. 2003]. Unclear however is why, assuming linker histones are important to
chromatin conformation and gene expression in mammalian cells, mice lacking
somatic linker histones (Hlc, Hid or Hie) [Fan et al. 2001] or even the embryonic
linker histone HI0 [Sirotkin et al. 1995] do not display any phenotypic abnormalities.
Also at present unclear is whether mammalian somatic linker histone subtypes are
functionally different to each other. It is known that different subtypes bind to
different locations in the chromatin but as yet differences in the effects they cause
have not been observed [Khochbin 2001]. Further characterisation of mammalian
linker histone subtypes and variants of subtypes and investigation into the changing
chromatin complement of such proteins during development will help clarify their
role in differentiation and nuclear reprogramming in mammalian cells.
[1.10.2] Higher orders of chromatin structure
Chromatin folding
Most of the chromatin in the nucleus is in the form of 30 nm filaments [See
Fig 1.12], The exact structure of 30 nm filaments is still being elucidated although it
is known formation of these filaments is highly dependent on HI being present and is
influenced by the N terminal histone tail domains of core histones. The actual
location of linker histones within the 30 nm fibre has yet to be identified [as
reviewed by Zlatanova & Leuba 2003].
Chromatin loops
Little is known about additional levels of chromatin organisation beyond 10
nm and 30 nm filaments though much evidence exists to support the idea that
interphase chromosomes are composed of loops of chromatin filament. The loops are
attached to the nuclear skeleton at their bases and project into the interior of the
nucleus [Zlatanova & Leuba 2003],
Higher levels ofchromatin structure
Very little is known about chromatin structure above the loop level. It appears
such higher levels of chromatin organisation do not need to be maintained for
complete reprogramming to occur, at least in sheep: Loi et al. 2002 transferred nuclei
from severely heat shocked (75C, 15 min) sheep granulosa cells to enucleated
oocytes and the reconstructed embryos developed to live offspring with an efficiency
higher than non-heat shocked controls. Studies using mammalian somatic nuclei
show high-order chromatin structure to have been destroyed in nuclei from cells heat
shocked to this extent [Balbi et al. 1989][Shih & Lake 1972]. Also mouse sperm
nuclei in which all elements of chromatin structure are lost except the DNA loop
anchored in the nuclear matrix were able to generate live offspring when injected
into oocytes [Ward et al. 1999].
[1.11] Nuclear reprogramming and associated chromatin modification
Nuclear reprogramming involves introducing heritable, but reversible
changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, resulting in a
restoration of developmental potential. Such reprogramming affects the local
structure, composition and remodelling of chromatin that regulates the transcriptional
competence of genes and controls the accessibility of regulatory factors to DNA.
Cloned animals frequently show epigenetic abnormalities while the sequence of their
genomic DNA remains unaltered from that of the donor nuclei [as reviewed by Shi et
al. 2003]. Complete establishment, maintenance and resetting of epigenetic states are
thought to be vital for successful reprogramming. Epigenetic modifications such as
DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, chromatin
remodelling, histone modification, and telomere maintenance are all likely to be
associated with the mechanism responsible for nuclear reprogramming [Shi et al.
2003],
How epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression is still unclear and
much remains to learnt about how epigenetic modifications are initiated, what their
consequences are, and whether they have a role to play in the restoration of
developmental potential. Such epigenetic modifications and why they might be
important to nuclear reprogramming will now be reviewed.
[1.11.1] DNA Methylation
DNA methylation is the best studied epigenetic modification likely to play a
part in nuclear reprogramming in mammals. During development it plays an essential
role in the determination of cell fate and cell type-specific gene expression by
transcriptional repression [Holliday & Pugh 1975][Riggs 1975]. Methylation of
DNA takes place at CpG dinucleotides. Small regions in the genome with unusually
high cytosine and guanine nucleotide content relative to the rest of the genome are
referred to as CpG islands. In the human genome 29,000 of the conservatively
estimated 40,000 genes have associated CpG islands, which are generally
unmethylated in normal tissues. In contrast, CpG islands associated with imprinted
genes, X-linked genes in females, germ line-specific and tissue specific-genes are
normally methylated [Shi et al. 2003].
The formation of a covalent bond between a methyl group and a cytosine
moiety within a CpG dinucleotide is catalysed by cytosine methyltransferases
(Dnmts). Dnmtl is found to be responsible for the maintenance ofDNA methylation
patterns where Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are required for de novo methylation of DNA.
Targeted disruption of these enzymes alters DNA methylation patterns and has
profound biological consequences: Dnmtl knockout mouse embryos die at mid-
gestation [Li et al. 1992]. Mouse ES cells lacking Dnmtl exhibit increased mutation
rates of both the endogenous hprt gene and a viral thymidine kinase transgene
indicating greater genomic instability [Chen et al. 1998]. Overexpression of Dnmtl
leads to loss of imprinting and embryonic lethality [Biniszkiewicz et al. 2002]
Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b knockouts also exhibit embryonic lethality in mice [Okano et
al. 1999]. Other studies, using an inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-azacytidine,
showed an increase in rat embryonic abnormalities during gestation in a dose
dependent manner [Doerksen and Trasler 1996]. Taken together these observations
show DNA methylation is necessary for appropriate gene expression and normal
development.
During normal mouse embryonic development, there are two times where the
genome is globally demethylated and then remethylated, one occurs during the
development of germ cells [Lee et al. 2002][Hajkova et al. 2002] and the other
happens shortly after fertilisation [Monk et al. 1987][Santos et al. 2002]. During
germ cell development, genome-wide demethylation leads to mitotic arrest of male
and female primordial germ cells (PGCs). De novo methylation is initiated before
birth in the male germ line, whereas it occurs after birth with the female [Hajkova et
al. 2002]. During gametogenesis, both the oocyte and sperm genomes become
heavily methylated and consequently cease gene transcription. Prior to fertilisation,
the sperm genome is tightly packed with small proteins called protamines, whereas
the oocyte genome is packaged with histones in nucleosomes as outlined in
Subsection [1.10.1] [Perreault 1992]. When the egg and sperm fuse, the sperm DNA
is exposed to oocyte cytoplasm and is rapidly remodeled. Protamines are quickly
removed, by the nuclear chaperone nucleoplasmin (See Subsection [1.10.1.1]), and
replaced with histones and sperm genome-wide demethylation ensues before the
zygote divides [Oswald et al. 2000]. In contrast, demethylation of the oocyte
genome occurs much more slowly due to the failure to demethylate DNA. By the
morula stage, both sperm and oocyte genomes are hypomethylated [Mayer et al.
2000], Genome-wide de novo methylation occurs at the blastocyst stage, especially
in cells contained within the inner cell mass (ICM) [Dean & Ferguson-Smith 2001].
By gastrulation there is an almost uniform methylation pattern between homologous
chromosomes, with the exception of imprinted genes which display different allelic
methylation states depending on whether they were derived from the maternal or
paternal genome [Surani 2001].
The degree of genomic methylation varies depending on cell lineage. Most
somatic cells are heavily methylated, although trophoblast derived lineages that
contribute to placental formation as well as the yolk sac are undermethylated [Reik et
al. 2001]. Little is known about what the post-zygotic demethylation and
remethylation waves do biologically or the reason for differences in DNA
methylation patterns exhibited by the parental genomes immediately after
fertilisation. Oswald et al. 2000 suggest that such changes in methylation are needed
to reprogram the highly differentiated gametic genomes so that totipotency is
restored and both paternal and maternal genomes can direct normal development.
The timing and cell-type specificity of post fertilisation global DNA
remethylation varies with species of mammal: eg. extensive genome wide
methylation is observed both in the ICM and trophectoderm in the 8-16 cell stage of
bovine embryonic development whereas in mouse embryos equivalent methylation is
only observed approximately four cell divisions later and then only in cells of the
ICM [Dean et al. 2001],
Incomplete and abnormal DNA methylation have frequently been observed in
cloned animals. The methylation status in preimplantaion cloned embryos, especially
at repeat sequences, closely resembles that of the donor cell genome, indicating
incomplete removal of methylation patterns.
Differential biparental genomic demethylation does not occur in NT
reconstructed embryos. The genome from the donor nucleus is packaged with
histones (not protamines) and when exposed to ooplasm shows the same slow
decline in genome wide methylation as seen in the maternal haploid genome during
normal development.
Cloned animals generated by nuclear transfer often express abnormal
methylation patterns. No active demethylation was observed in cloned bovine
embryos generated by Bourc'his & Viegas-Peguignot (2001) and transferred nuclei
maintained methylation patterns associated with somatic nuclei. Furthermore,
premature de novo methylation was observed in a large proportion of nuclei post
transplantation to enucleated oocytes. During normal bovine embryonic
development, de novo methylation occurs at the 8-16 cell stage but in the
reconstructed embryos, it was observed at the 4-8 cell stage [Dean et al. 2001].
In the mouse, aberrant genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 2 cell
stage embryos correlate well with the failure to develop to the blastocyst stage and
may also contribute to embryonic lethality later in the pregnancy [Shi & Haaf 2002],
The fact that cows and sheep have a longer period than the mouse before de novo
methylation begins may explain the apparent differences in cloning efficiencies
between murine and bovine species [Shi et al. 2003]. De novo methylation in normal
cow and sheep embryos does not start naturally until the 8-16 cell stage whereas in
mouse embryos it starts at the two cell stage. Passive removal of methylation patterns
would seem more probable as the start of de novo methylation occurs later in
development in these species.
Oocytes and fertilized eggs express different Dmnts (cytosine
methyltransferases) and Dmnt-associated factors eg. Dmntlo, a oocyte-specific form
of Dmntl, is not found in fertilized eggs [Ratnam et al. 2002] and Dnmt3L, a Dmnt
like factor which is associated with Dmnt3a and Dmnt3b is found expressed in
fertilized eggs but not oocytes [Bourc'his et al. 2002]. It has been speculated that
these differences may underly the aberrant DNA methylation patterns in
reconstructed embryos. If this were confirmed, Dnmtlo, Dnmt3L as well as other
differentially expressed factors may be used as markers for nuclear reprogramming
[Shi et al. 2003],
[1.11.2] Genomic Imprinting
Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that controls the expression
of an allele on the basis of its parternal origin (i.e. whether it was derived from the
maternal genome in the egg or the paternal genome in the sperm). As a result of
imprinting, mammalian paternal and maternal genomes are non-equivalent and for
normal development to ensue both parental genomes must be present. Parthenogenic
embryos where only the maternal genome is represented only develop to the
blastocyst stage [as reviewed by Renard et al. 1988].
In nuclear transfer experiments, where imprints were removed from the
paternal genome prior to transfer, the resultant reconstructed embryos have
abnormalities associated with extraembryonic tissues whereas when maternal
imprints are removed the embryo appears abnormal. This suggests paternal genome
has more influence on extra embryonic development and the maternal genome has
greater affect on the development of the embryo proper. Imprinting also affects other
processes important to reproduction including energy metabolism, lactation and
parental behaviour to offspring [Lefebvre et al. 1998]
Imprinted genes display differential DNA methylation and, as previously
outlined, such epigenetic modification is known to play a role in the repression of
gene expression. Many imprinted genes are found clustered in groups that display
different DNA methylation profiles from the rest of the genome, consequently these
loci are termed differentially methylated regions or DMRs [Tilghman et al.
1999][Reik et al. 2001]. While DNA methylation is generally associated with the
repression of gene expression, Surani (2001) states that the relationship between
imprinted genes and methylation is more complex: methylation of DMRs can be
required for the expression of imprinted genes. An example of this is the imprinted
Igf2/H19 locus on mouse chromosome 7. Methylation of the DMR upstream ofHI 9
prevents a regulatory factor CTCF from binding the parental insulator, making the
Ig/2 promoter accessible to enhancer elements that are shared by HI 9 and Igf2,
allowing the expression of Igf2 [Bell & Felsenfeld 2000][Hark et al. 2000].
During early mammalian development, the global epigenetic state of the
genome undergoes extensive change, however the epigenetic state of imprinted genes
appears to remain relatively stable. Initiation of imprints occurs in primordial germ
cells, diploid cells that produce gametes. During PGC migration to the genital ridge a
wave of global DNA demethylation occurs at the same time as imprint erasure [Kafri
et al. 1992][Hajkova et al. 2002] and it is suspected that DNA methylation plays a
role in the re-introduction of imprints during gametogenesis. After imprints have
been established in the germline, the parental genomes are not equivalent with the
maternal genome displaying methylation at many of its imprinted loci while the
paternal genome displays a reciprocal pattern. Such epigenetic differences are then
maintained during normal development from fertilisation through to adulthood.
Erasure and resetting of genomic imprints is important for the removal of aberrant
epigenetic modification that occurred during the lifespan of the previous generation
[Surani 1999],
Interestingly, the phenotypes of some cloned animals mirror those of animals
in which imprinted genes have been mutated [Wang et al. 1994][Ludwig et al. 1996].
It is speculated that imprinting may be disturbed during the nuclear transfer process
and that this accounts for frequent instances of failure to generate viable offspring.
Unlike PGCs, imprints can neither be initiated nor deleted in the mature oocyte, so
the genomic imprints cannot be altered by simply exposing chromatin to oocyte
cytoplasm [Surani et al. 1986]. From this one might expect that transfer of a nucleus
into an oocyte would not affect somatic genomic imprints but there are exceptions
[Solter et al. 2000] where imprints have been erased and this leads to abnormal
growth in both the embryo and associated extra-embryonic tissues.
Loss of appropriate imprinting patterns is commonly observed in cloned
embryos and newborn animals [as reviewed by Shi et al. 2003]. This is thought to
occur because (a) the DMRs of imprinted genes are not properly protected from
genome-wide demethylation which occurs after nuclear transfer; and (b)
reconstructed embryos do not lose and reinitiate their imprints, as occurs in PGCs, so
any errors acquired during the lifetime of the somatic nucleus persist in the
reconstructed embryo [Hajkova et al. 2002],
There is no clear correlation between abnormal expression of any of the 54
imprinted genes identified in mice and the appearance of aberrant development in
cloned embryos [Shi et al. 2003].
In vitro culture and manipulation of cells disrupts imprinted gene expression
but such treatment is not the sole reason for it. In sheep and cattle, large offspring
syndrome (LOS) could arise as a consequence of embryo culture, where DMR2
methylation and Ig/2r expression are affected by components of serum [Young et al.
2001], The imprinting status of HI9 in mouse embryos is also affected by culture
conditions [Doherty et al. 2000]. The length of in vitro culture of mouse ES cells is
correlated with the frequency of imprinting errors [Dean et al. 1998].
[1.11.3] X Chromosome Inactivation
Abnormal XCI is observed in embryos generated by parthenogenesis and also
in those reconstructed using nuclear transfer [as reviewed by Shi et al. 2003].
Parthenogenic embryos have two maternally derived X-chromosomes and both
remain activated in associated extraembryonic cells. It seems some imprinting
mechanism makes maternally-derived X chromosomes resistant to being inactivated
[Tada & Takagi 1992], During somatic nuclear transfer, the nucleus to be fused with
the ooplasts contains one inactive and one active X chromosome. However after
transfer, some researchers have reported aberrant reactivation of X-chromosomes in
reconstructed bovine embryos [Wrenzycki et al. 2002], Xue et al. 2002 reported the
aberrant expression of 9 X-linked genes in several dead bovine calf clones.
Differences in which parental X chromsome was inactivated in placental cells was
reported between these calves and calves which survived.
[1.11.4] Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity
Perhaps surprisingly, there are many reports showing telomere lengths are
maintained or lengthened after nuclear transfer [Betts et al. 2001]. Lanza et al. 2000
used nearly senescent bovine fetal cells as nuclear donors and reported the telomere
length restored or in some cases elongated in the cloned animals. Wakayama et al.
(2000) serially recloned cloned mice for up to 6 generations and reported no decrease
in telomere length. Thus, while telomere length can be a contributory factor to the
death of clones, it is not the only factor [Tian et al. 2000], The generation of larger
numbers of cloned animals that display a developmentally normal lifespan suggests
telomere length is commonly restored by nuclear transfer at least using certain cell
types [Yanagimachi 2002], How telomerase activity is reinitiated after nuclear
transfer is, however, poorly understood.
The stage at which high telomerase activity is observed in reconstructed
bovine embryos after nuclear transfer is significantly delayed compared to normal
development. Control embryos generated by IVF display high telomerase activity at
the 8-16 cell stage whereas in cloned embryos comparable activity was only
observed at the blastocyst stage [Betts & King 1999].
[1.11.5] Histone modifications
Acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation and
ubiquitination of the N-terminal tails of core histones have been linked to changes in
high-order chromatin structure [Turner 2002]. Such epigenetic modifications are
thought to be important in altering the accessibility of regulatory factors to DNA and
affecting gene transcription. It has been hypothesized that combinations of these
epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression in a consistent manner and
therefore comprise a "histone code" [Turner 2000].
Of the histone modifications mentioned, histone acetylation is the best
studied. Histone acetylation generates a more open chromatin structure that generally
correlates with transcriptional activation, whereas histone deacetylation is generally
associated with repression of transcription. Deacetylated histone tails bind repressor
proteins, whereas acetylated tails bind bromodomain motifs of certain regulatory
factors that promote changes in chromatin structure and transcriptional activation
[Winston and Allis 1999]. Histone acetylation, at particular regions within the
genome, is controlled by the activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and
deacetylases (HDACs). Interestingly, Dnmts and HDACS have been found in the
same protein complexes indicating that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation
are linked in the mechanism responsible for transcription repression.
Histone acetylation of a locus is not always sufficient to induce transcription
but it does facilitate such induction by reducing folding of nucleosomal fibres
[Wolffe and Matzke 1999]. It is thought that histone acetylation acts in conjunction
with chromatin remodeling mechanisms to facilitate gene expression. Such
complexes weaken histone-DNA interactions and increase the accessibility of
nucleosomal DNA to regulatory factors (See Subsection [2.11.6]).
Histone methylation occurs on the arginine and lysine residues. Certain lysine
residues at specific positions in the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 are
thought to be important for gene repression. For example, methylation of Lys9 of
histone H3 (MeK9H3) forms a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1, a protein
commonly found in heterochromatin and inactivated chromatin of Xi [Bannister et
al. 2001][Cowell et al. 2002], The exact mechanism by which this could initiate
repression of gene expression is, as yet, not understood. In contrast to histone
acetylation and phosphorylation, some histone methylation at lysine residues appears
to be a stable epigenetic modification, though the biological consequences are
unclear. Some of the enzymes responsible for methylation of histone tails, HMTases,
have been identified in mouse and human [Kouzarides 2002].
[1.11.6] Chromatin remodeling complexes
In addition to covalent modification to the N-terminal tails of core histones,
chromatin structure can be altered in a regulated manner by protein complexes, so
called chromatin remodeling complexes, that utilize energy derived from ATP
hydrolysis. These complexes change the position and/or structure of nucleosomes
such that the accessibility to nucleosomal DNA is enhanced [Kingston & Narlikar
1999],
Deletion or mutation of components of chromatin remodeling complexes can
cause death or developmental aberrations in mammals. Murine embryos deficient in
either SNF5 (commonly found in chromatin remodeling complexes) or Brgl die
before implanation [Miiller & Leutz 2001]. Mice with mutations in Brm are viable
and fertile, but exhibit 10-15% increase in bodyweight over their wildtype littermates
[Reyes et al. 1998].
Chromatin remodeling complexes are involved in many processes beside
gene transcription which include: DNA replication; DNA recombination; DNA
repair and cellular differentiation [Langst & Becker 2001],
[1.12] Summary
Nuclear reprogramming may be defined as the process by which a cell
reacquires developmental potential [Singh 2000]. Cell hybridisation and nuclear
transfer have demonstrated that a mammalian somatic cell's differentiated state may
be reprogrammed. The factors responsible for nuclear reprogramming are currently
being sought. Nuclear reprogramming involves chemical and structural chromatin
changes. When mechanisms by which mammalian cells can be reprogrammed are
elucidated, resultant technologies will be of profound benefit to science and
medicine.

[2] Materials and Methods
Protocols for generating solutions and media used here are listed separately in
the appendices (Section [12-1]). All reagents were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.
(www.sigma-aldrich.com) unless otherwise stated.
[2.1] Cell Culture
[2.1.1] Routine Culture Conditions
[2.1.1.1] Murine ES cells and EC cells
Culture of murine ES/EC cells with Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF)-
supplemented medium
Cells were grown at 37C (5% CO2) on 0.1% gelatin-treated tissue culture flasks
(Iwaki, www.iwaki.com) and fed daily with murine ES medium. All media were stored
at 4C when not in use. Media older than 2 weeks were disguarded.
Disaggregation of murine cells
To disaggregate cells, medium was aspirated from the flask and the cells were
washed with lx Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Trypsin/EGTA disaggregation
solution (TEG) was then added until the surface of the flask was completely covered.
The flask was then incubated at 37C for 2-3 minutes. Cells were then detached by
slapping the flask. 5 ml of medium were added to inhibit further trypsin activity and
pipetted up and down several times to obtain a single-cell suspension. The resultant
suspension were then transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes and centrifuged at 3,000g for
5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet of cells was resuspended in
fresh medium and plated out or treated as required.
Freezing and resuscitation of cells
A similar freezing procedure was used for all cell types in this study. 2x freezing
mix was made by mixing 15 ml of culture medium, 5ml dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO
(Sigma) and 5ml of foetal calf serum [or 5 ml Knockout SR serum replacement (Life
Technologies) for human ES cell lines]. This solution was filtered and stored at -20 C
when not in use. When cells were to be placed in cryostasis, they were disaggregated,
resuspended in medium (l-5xl07 cells / ml) and placed on ice. One volume of ice-cold
freezing mix was added and the suspension was gently mixed and aliquoted into pre-
cooled cryovials. The cryovials were stored at -80C for two days and were then placed
into liquid nitrogen.
To resuscitate the cells, cryovials were placed in a water bath (37C) until
thawed. Five milliliters of complete medium were added to the contents of a vial in a 15
ml Falcon tube, and then centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was
discarded and pellets resuspended in medium for plating out.
[2.1.1.2] Human ES cells
Human ES cells were cultured using medium conditioned by murine primary
embryonic fibroblasts (PEF) in a manner similar to Xu et al. 2001.
Derivation of primary embryonic fibroblasts from mid-gestation murine fetuses
Primary Embryonic Fibroblasts (PEFs) were derived from day 13.5 murine
fetuses as follows: The uterine horns of a pregnant CBA female mouse were removed on
the thirteenth or fourteenth day of pregnancy. Fetuses were liberated from the uterine
horns. Each fetus was then dissected such that the placenta, membranes and the soft red
tissue (liver, heart and other viscera) was also removed. The dissected fetuses were then
separately vortexed in TEG until the solution went cloudy with disaggregated cells. TEG
was then neutralised with Primary Embryonic Fibroblast (PEF) medium [See Section
[13.1] for details of media and solution preparation]. Large clumps of cellular debris
were allowed sediment out and after 4 minutes the cells in suspension were removed.
The cells were spun down (3,000 g, 5 min) and resuspended in PEF medium before
being used to seed flasks (1 embryo was normally used to seed one 75 cm2 flask).
Routine culture of PEF feeders
Murine primary embryonic fibroblasts were used as feeders for the human ES
cells. When being resuscitated or expanded, these cells were grown at 37C (5% CO2)
on tissue culture plastic flasks (Iwaki, www.iwaki.com) and fed daily with complete
PEF medium. Prior to using them to condition medium, the cells were washed for times
with lx Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS) to remove serum that would induce human ES
cell differentiation.
Conditioning of human ES cell medium with PEF feeders
When culturing human ES cells, the requirement for feeder cells could not be
replaced with LIF supplemented medium (as is the case with murine ES cells). It was
necessary to condition human ES medium using murine primary PEFs prior to its use on
the cells. PEFs provided the necessary growth factors for successful culture of the
human ES cells.
PEFs were grown at 37C (5% CO2) on tissue culture flasks (Iwaki) and fed
human ES medium. Human ES medium was conditioned on feeders for 24-48 hour prior
to feeding human ES cells. All conditioned medium was filtered and 4 ng / ml fresh
human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor was added directly to the medium
before feeding human ES cells. Flasks with dead PEFs (seen as either adherent or
floating circular refractile cells) were not used as feeders. Typically, PEFs could be
passaged four times before significant levels of cell death were seen.
Culture in conditioned human ES medium
Human ES cells were cultured on GFR matrigel (Becton Dickinson,
www.bectondickinson.com) a matrix of laminin, collagen IV and heparin sulphate.
Aliquots of matrigel were thawed overnight on ice and diluted 1:100 with cold
Knockout Delbeccos Modified Essential Medium (KO DMEM). Flasks were then
coated with this solution and the matrigel was left to polymerize for at least 1 hour at
37C. Flasks were then washed with lx HBS to remove any excess matrigel.
Human ES cells were grown at 37C (5 % CO2) on matrigel treated tissue culture flasks
and fed daily with murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned human ES medium.
Disaggregation of human ES cells
The protocol for disaggregating human ES cells is similar to that previously
described for murine cells (See Subsection [2.1.1.1]), although there are the following
differences:
1) lxHBS, instead of lxPBS, was used to wash the cells. The cells will "round up"
and lower plating efficiencies will be observed if PBS is used.
2) Human ES cells lyse and clump together if overexposed to TEG. The cells need
to be closely monitored under the microscope and the duration of TEG exposure
minimised to prevent this occuring. Human ES cells grown on matrigel are less
easily detached than murine cells, thus vigourous slapping of the flask is
required to detact the cells after TEG has been added.
3) As human ES medium lacks serum protein and thus trypsin inhibitors, it is
necessary to add more medium to dilute the trypsin activity and prevent cell lysis
(typically 10 ml hES medium per 1 ml of TEG was added prior to
centrifugation).
[2.1.2] Transfection
Transfection is the genetic modification of cultured animal cells by the uptake of
DNA from the culture medium. This process was used throughout this work mainly to
generate selectable cell lines.
[2.1.2.1] Transfection of murine ES cells and human EC cells
Lipofection
Transfection was performed using the Effectene kit (Qiagen). For transfection of
40-80% confluent cell cultures in 60 mm dishes, best results were observed using the
following proportion of reaction components: ~2 pg of DNA in up to 150 pi of EC
buffer; 16 pi of Enhancer solution and 20 pi of Effectene reagent.
Electroporation
Mouse ES cells were passaged 24 hr prior to transfection so that one 80%
confluent 175 cm2 flask was available for each electroporation on the day of the
experiment. The medium was changed 2 hours prior to the electroporation to maximize
the number of dividing cells and correspondingly the transfection efficiency. The cells
were harvested with TEG. 60 mg linearised, EtOH precipitated DNA was used for each
stable transfection experiment. This DNA was resuspended in 200 pi lxHBS. DNA was
resuspended using a pipette as vortexing might cause shearing of the DNA. The cells
were resuspended in 10ml mES medium, counted and pelleted. 107 cells were
resuspended in 800pl of lxHBS. The cells were mixed thoroughly with DNA and the
suspension was placed in an electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap. Using a
genepulser (BIORAD, www.biorad.com), a pulse of 800 V, 3 pF was applied. The
recorded time constant should lie within a range from 0.1 to 0.19. The pulsed cells were
left in the cuvette at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before transferring them to 5ml
of ES medium. The cells were then seeded at 5xl06 cells/15 cm plates. Forty eight hours
after electroporation, selection media was applied to the plates and colonies of stably
transfected clones were picked when they had grown to the appropriate size (this
typically takes 10-14 days).
[2.1.2.2] Transfection of human ES cells
Transfection of hES cells was performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 kit
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. H9 cells were plated at 1x10s per
well of 6 well plate (at passage 55) forty eight hours later transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (life technologies).

[2.2] Cell fusion and hybridisation
[2.2.1] Electrofusion
Electrofusion is the induction of cell fusion by the administration of an electric
pulse (or pulses) to a cellular suspension. The electrofusion protocol described was the
amalgamation of ideas from several sources, with the principal influence being the work
of Tada et al. (1997) and unpublished experiments by the student and Drs. Gallagher and
McWhir.
Experiments where reprogramming of the Oct4 locus was investigated used
somatic cells derived from CBA 0c,,,,o/0ct"eo mjce [McWhir et al. 1996]. This transgenic
line was generated by pronuclear injection of pOctoeol into F1 (CBA X C57BL/6)
embryos. The pOcbreol plasmid contains a 1.9kb sequence 5' of the Oct4 coding
sequence (containing the Oct4 promoter and proximal enhancer) linked to the bacterial
neomycin cassette. Embryos with a genetic background which was 87.5% CBA, 12.5%
C57BL/6 were obtained by mating homozygous pOctneol males with CBA females.
The HM-1 ES cell line was used in most murine cell fusion experiments. This line was
derived from hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficient strain 129/Ola
mice [Magin et al. 1992] (Subsection [2.2.4] discusses HPRT and HAT selection). The
protocol for fusions using CBA 0ct"eo/0ct"eo mjce ancj G418 and HAT double selection is
now outlined:
Thymocytes were obtained from female CBA 0ctneo/0ctneo mice at age 6-7 weeks.
Mice were dissected and the thymocytes removed and placed in lx PBS. They were
chopped into small chunks with fine dissecting scissors and passed several times through
an 18-gauge needle to give a partial single cell suspension. The crude cellular
suspension was allowed to settle for 5 minutes. The supernatent was gently taken off
without disturbing the clumps of tissue at the bottom of the tube. The resultant single
cell suspension was washed three times with lx PBS (spun at 3,000 g for 5 minutes each
time).
The ES cells were then disaggregated, rendered into single cell suspension and
washed three times with PBS. Aliquots of lxl07 HM-1 cells and 5xl07 thymocytes were
made and mixed. The cells were then spun down (3000 g, 5 min) and resuspended in
400pl of freshly made electrofusion buffer (0.3M D-Mannitol titrated to 280
milliOsmoles (mOs) using 0.1mM MgSC>4).
Prior to electropulsing, the cell mixture was centrifuged in a 0.2 cm cuvette at
l,000g for 5 minutes inside 50 ml Falcon tubes cushioned with tissue paper. The cells
were then electropulsed (standard conditions 300 V, 25 pF) using a Biorad genepulser.
Cuvettes were left to sit at room temperature for 15-20 min prior to removing and
plating the cells. Each single fusion experiment was plated onto five 100 cm plates with
ES cell medium. After 48 hours selection was applied, lxHAT and 150pg / ml G418
(double selection) or lxHAT selection (single selection).
During the course of work described in this thesis, breeding problems with the
CBAOct"ro/0ct"'" line were encountered. This resulted in CBA wild type mice and HAT
selection only being used in most of the fusion experiments.
Heat shocking cells
If thymocytes were to be heat-shocked prior to electropulsing and seeding,
lxPBS washed cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml 42C PBS and placed immediately in a
42C water bath for 10 minutes. The cells were then counted, divided into 5xl07 cell
aliquots, and mixed with lxlO7 ES cells. Controls for prefusion heat shock experiments
were treated in the same manner except the PBS was not preheated and the cells were
left at 37C for 10 minutes while the other cells were being heat-shocked. For post-
fusion heat shock experiments where the cells have already been pulsed and seeded, the
cells were heat shocked by removing the medium at the appropriate time point and
replaced with preheated PBS (42C) and placed in a 42C incubator for 10 minutes. The
PBS was then removed and fresh 37C ES medium was then applied.
[2.2.2] Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Mediated Cell Fusion
PolyEthyelene Glycol (PEG), a chemical that perturbs membrane structure, was
also used to induce cell fusion. The PEG fusion protocol outlined here is based on a
similar one by Matveeva et al. (1998):
Murine ES cells were fused with somatic cells (either) thymocytes or splenocytes as
follows:
A suspension of 5x107 somatic cells was added to a T175 flask already seeded
with a 90-100% confluent monolayer of ES (or EC) cells and allowed to attach. The cell
mixture was treated with a 45% polyethylene glycol MW 1,450 (Sigma) in full growth
medium plus 10% DMSO for 1-4 min [Davidson and Gerald (1976)]. The cells were
then thoroughly washed with lxPBS and left overnight in complete growth medium. The
cells were then transferred to dishes containing selection media. Viable colonies were
harvested 9-15 days after fusion. Subsection [2.2.4] discusses the selection used.
Human ES cells were fused with other cell types in a similar manner. The only
differences were that PEG solution and selection media were made up using conditioned
human ES medium (and not murine ES medium) and lxHBS (not lxPBS) was used to
wash away the PEG solution.
[2.2.3] Sendai' Virus Mediated Cell Fusion
Sendai virus has been used to induce cell fusion [Harris et al. 1965], Such cell
fusion has been found to be dependent on the expression of two viral proteins: the
haemagluttinin neuraminidase (HN) protein which is thought to be required for close
contact between the membranes being fused, and the F glycoprotein which is necessary
to disrupt membrane structure and induce membrane fusion [Bousse et al. 1994],
This virus is extremely contagious in mice, where it can cause epithial
hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and syncytial cell formation. Therefore the virus was
completely inactivated prior to its use as a cell fusagen. This was done using (3
propiolactone (BPL - Sigma), a chemical that destroys viral RNA [Neff & Enders
1967]. Such treatment, unlike other inactivation treatments such as UV exposure, does
not reduce the virus's ability to induce cell fusion.
BPL-inactivated Senda'i virus was kindly supplied by Prof. Ian Wilmut and Bill
Richie (Roslin Institute). This stock had been generated by inoculating day 9 hens' eggs
with the active virus and removing the virus-rich allantoic fluid from the eggs after 72hr
at 37C. This fluid was centrifuged (3,000 g, 20 min) to remove detritus. 1 ml of 0.5%
BPL in saline bicarbonate was added to 9 ml viral suspension and was gentle agitated at
4C for 10 minutes. The solution was then incubated at 37C for 120 min with agitation,
then statically at +4C overnight. The concentration of the inactivated viral stock was
measured using the haemagluttinin assay11 and diluted to 7,500 HAU / ml in KO DMEM.
This stock was then aliquoted into 1 ml aliquots and stored at -70C. The BPL treated
stock was subsequently tested for infectivity by inoculating hen's eggs with 1:4-1:20
dilution of the stock in KO DMEM. No hemagglutination activity was detected,
verifying that the virus was no longer capable of infecting cells.
Attempts to induce human ES cell fusion using BPL-inactivated Senda'i virus
were carried out as follows: cells from several confluent T150 flasks were disaggregated
separately using TEG. Flasks were physically agitated until the cells dislodged from the
flask. 10 ml lxHBS was added to the flask for every 1 ml of TEG used and the cell
suspension was transferred to 50 ml Falcon tubes and pelleted.
Cells were resuspended in lxHBS and counted. Cells were stained as outlined in
Section [2.2.5], Fusions were then exposed to 5 ml Sendai' viral suspension and left for
30 minutes at 37C while leakage controls were not exposed to the viral suspension
11 This assay is based on the fact Sendai' virus particles bind erythocytes. Normally, erthryocytes will form
a sharp dot when added to a cell culture well full of medium. When virions are present however, the
erythrocytes are bound by virus and the sharp dot does not form. By serially diluting the viral suspension
and looking at the distribution of added erthrocytes, one can assay the virion concentration. Such a
concentration is cited as haemaglutinin activity units (HAU).
[7,500 haemaglutinin activity units (HAU) / ml]. Cells were then washed three times in
lxHBS and plated on matrigel treated 10 cm plates (2xl07 cells were typically plated
across five 10 cm plates).
|2.2.4) Selecting for cell hybrids
Murine heterokaryons were selected using HAT and/or G418 selection [Fig 2.1 J.

Fig 2.1 Schematic showing electrofusion and selection for ES x somatic cell hybrids
In a typical experiment lxlO7 HM-1 cells are mixed with 5xl07 CBAct"eo/0ctneo
thymocytes and electrofused in fresh D-mannitol electrofusion buffer [See Section
|12.1] for details of buffer composition]. The cells are plated out on five 10cm plates
(~1.2xl07cells/plate), placed under selection after 24 hours and cultured for 12-14 days
when hybrid colonies become visible. Note: Octneo is a knock-in of the endogenous
Oct4-locus.
Inherent selection conditions of cell culture
While culturable in serum supplemented GI medium [Sawa et al. 1997], murine
thymocytes die under murine ES cell culture conditions. Thus these conditions alone
select against unfused thymocytes, thymocyte homokaryons and cell hybrids displaying
a thymocytic phenotype. In contrast, fibroblasts proliferate under mES culture
conditions and in fusion experiments with fibroblasts an additional selection was
required.
HAT selection
HAT selection utilises growth medium containing Hypoxanthine, the folate
reductase antagonist Aminopterin, and Thymine. Aminopterin is an inhibitor of de novo
purine synthesis. Cells lacking the capacity to generate nucleotides via the salvage
pathway will die in the presence of aminopterin as they will be unable to synthesise
purines. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) is the enzyme
catalysing the first step of the salvage pathway. Cells lacking this enzyme (e.g. HM-1
cells) will be unable to generate purines in the presence of aminopterin and will die.
HAT selection is commonly used to select for hybrid cells (eg. somatic cell hybrids in
monoclonal antibody production) where one of the parental cell types is HPRT deficient
[Hope & Graves 1978]. Under this selection cells are forced to use exogenous bases, via
the salvage pathways, as their sole source of purines and pyrimidines. Parental cells
lacking HPRT cannot replicate their DNA under these circumstances. HM-1 cells were
used in cell hybridisation experiments, so HAT selection could be used to select against
unfused HM-1 cells or HM-1 x HM-1 fusion products.
6-thioguanine selection
6-thioguanine (6-TG) is a purine analogue which is converted to a toxic
nucleotide through a reaction that requires a functional HPRT-encoded enzyme. Thus,
medium that contains 6-thioguanine kills normal cells but does not affect the growth of
mutant cell clones harboring inactivating mutations within the HPRT gene. It is used in
this thesis to generate HPRT deficient lines which when unfused can be then selected
against with HAT medium [Hope & Graves 1978].
G418 Selection
G418 is an aminoglycosidic antibiotic that inhibits prokaryotic and eukaryotic
protein synthesis. It is commonly used for the selection and maintenance of eukaryotic
cells transfected with the neo / kan gene [Mohler & Blau 1994], This gene allows
production of aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, which inactivates G418, neomycin
and kanamycin by phosphorylation.
G418 was used in hybridisation experiments to select against heterokaryons
where the Oct-4 locus had not been reprogrammed. In somatic 0ctneol0ctneo cells, the Oct-4
promoter was shown to be off (See Subsection [4.3.2]) and so would not drive neo
expression that would enable a cell to remain viable in appropriate concentrations of
G418.
Puromycin
Like G418, puromycin also inhibits protein synthesis in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Specifically, it inhibits peptidyl transfer on ribosomes. It is commonly used
for the selection and maintenance of mammalian cells transfected by the bacterial pac
gene [de la Luna et al. 1988]. The pac gene encodes a puromycin N-acetyl transferase.
Blasticidin
Again, blasticidin inhibits protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Blasticidin specifically inhibits protein bond formation in ribosomal machinery.
Resistance to blasticidin is conferred by the BSD gene which codes for the enzyme
blasticidin deaminase [Kimura et al. 1994],

cell types is shown overleaf.

The column on the left shows the cell types fused in hybridisation experiments and the
right hand column shows what selection was used to isolate hybrids derived from
heterokaryons.
[2.2.5] Measuring heterokaryon formation
Cell fusion was assayed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickson). The
two cell aliquots were each stained with a different dye and then induced to fuse to form
heterokaryons. Heterokaryons were identified as doubly-stained cells and these were
measured using 2-dye FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) analysis.
Cytoplasmic dye staining
Cytoplasmic dye staining was used to assess cell fusion using a similar method to
that described by Scott-Taylor et al. (2000). CellTracker probe dyes 5-
chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) and (5-(and-6)-(((4-
chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino) tetramethylrhodamine) (CMTMR) (Cambridge
Biosciences) were used to stain ES and somatic cells respectively. Where fusions were
between different subclones, each subclone was exposed separately to one or other of
these dyes. The dyes are membrane permeable and contain thiol-reactive chloromethyl
groups, which interact with cytoplasmic glutathione transferases, forming fluorescent
thioester adducts. Such adducts are membrane impermeable and so cannot diffuse back
out of the cell [Jaroszeki et al. 1994],
Use of these dyes therefore mimimises problems associated with dye leakage and
dye transfer between cells not fused. The dyes were stored at -80C as 10 mM stock
solutions in DMSO. Scott-Taylor et al. (2000) found that the fluorescent intensity of
human cells is altered if cells are stained within three hours of electropulsing. Based on
this observation, it was decided that after electropulsing stained cell mixtures, the cells
would be incubated in full medium for a minimum of 4 hours before harvesting and
FACS analysis as described later in this section. Fluorescence spectra of HM-1 cells
[Fig 2.2 overleaf], murine thymocytes [Fig 2.3], murine primary embryonic fibroblasts
[Fig 2.4], and H9 cells [Fig 2.5] stained with different concentrations of dye were
generated to identify appropriate concentrations of dye to use in 2-dye FACS
experiments.

Data acquisition and analysis
A FACScan FACS sorter and "Cellquest" software (Becton Dickson) was used
to acquire and analyse FACS data. Once the cytometer had been calibrated, the cell
samples (containing >106 cells) were run, acquiring cells until 10,000 events had been
registered by the machine. In the analysis of stained samples, control fluorescence was
established using the negative (unstained) controls. The FACS analyser was equipped
with two filters: FL1 measures green fluorescence and FL2 measures red fluorescence.
In the double staining experiments used to assess heterokaryon formation, the
data were compensated manually as described in Subsection [12.2] to prevent false
positive events being registered (this problem arises as there is overlap between
wavelengths measured using the filters FL1 and FL2).
Two-dye FACS analysis for assessment of heterokaryon formation
The FACS analyser was first calibrated using unstained cells. Histograms with
Counts-FLl axes or Counts-FL2 axes were drawn and the voltages for the two filters
were modified until autofluorescent peaks were positioned at the least fluorescent end of
each axis (See Section [12.2] Optimising Instrument Electronics for FACS analysis).
After the peaks were properly positioned, a FL1-FL2 histogram showed the unstained
cells as discrete compact bodies located near the origin. Calibration continued using
populations of singly stained cells (either 'green' CMFDA or 'orange' CMTMR
stained). The stained fluorescence peaks appeared further up the axes as the stained cells
had a greater fluorescence than unstained cells. As the green fluorescence spectrum
measured using the FL1 filter overlaps slightly with that measured using the FL2 filter,
the data was be manually compensated. Using a FL1-FL2 plot, mixtures of green and
orange cells were compensated by altering the FL1-%FL2 setting until that CMFDA -
stained cells were distinct from CMTMR-stained cells (See Section [12.2]). The
histogram was then divided into four quadrants so that the CMFDA stained cells
appeared in the upper left quadrant and the CMTMR-stained cells appeared in the lower
right quadrant, and unstained cells appeared in the lower left quadrant. Samples were
then measured by the machine, and doubly stained cells appeared in the upper right
quadrant. The number of doubly stained cells was expressed as the percentage of the
total cells gated.
To ensure dye leakage does not cause over estimation of heterokaryon formation,
leakage controls were undertaken in all 2-dye FACS experiments. These used the same
number and types of cells as actual fusions but the cells are exposed to the fusagen
separately instead of together. The individually exposed cells were then mixed and
plated as the cells from the fusion experiments. The percentage of double staining in
leakage control is subtracted from that for the fusions in order to calculate actual
percentage heterokaryon formation.
[2.2.6] Calculation of hybridisation frequency
Hybrid colony yield on its own is not a good measure of reprogramming in the
hybrid system. This yield (number of colonies generated / number of cells induced to
fuse) is directly affected by the proportion of cells that are viable and the proportion of
cells fusing to form heterokaryons. Hybridisation frequency (hybrid / heterokaryon) is
calculated so that differences due to cell viability or cell fusion are taken into account
when analysing data thus giving a clearer measure of the frequency of nuclear
reprogramming.
Viable cells were identified using Forward Scatter/Side Scatter (FCS/SSC) plots
generated by FACS analysis. Dead cells are represented as a smaller less granular
population located near the origin of the plot [Subsection 12.2], Gates were drawn to
exclude this population and subsequently calculate cell viability (as a percentage of all
cells used). This gating procedure removed dead cells allowing heterokaryon formation
(as a percentage of viable cells) to be calculated. The two measurements cell viability
and heterokaryon formation were used to control for changes in either cell viability or
cell fusion that occurred between individual experiments. The measure of the incidence
of nuclear reprogramming is used throughout this thesis termed "hybridisation
frequency". Assuming two cell types are being fused to generate hybrid cells, this is
calculated as follows:
Hybridisation
_ # hybrid colonies
frequency ^ viable heterokaryons
# hybrid colonies
(# viable cells) x (fraction of viable cells fusing)
# hybrid colonies
(total# ofcells in selection) (fraction of total cells) * ( fraction of viable cells that fuse)I J t that remain viable J I becoming doubly stained J
So for example lxl07 CMFDA stained HM-1 cells are electropulsed with 5xl07
CMTMR stained thymocytes. Electropulsed cells were split equally across five 10 cm
plates. 4 plates (4.8x107 cells) were placed in selection for hybrid colonies and the other
plate (1.2xl07 cells) was used to assess cell viability and heterokaryon formation. FACS
analysis showed that 9.2% of pulsed cells were viable. Two-dye FACS analysis showed
8.8% of viable cells in the fusion were doubly stained, whereas 0.9% of viable cells
were in the leakage control. Subtracting the leakage control percentage from that of the
fusion, it is calculated that 7.9% of all viable cells fused to form heterokaryons. 12 days
later, 100 colonies were counted on the remaining 4 selection plates.

[2.3] Cytogenetic Analysis
[2.3.1] Giemsa staining
Giemsa stain is used to make transparent cells and their colonies more visible
under the microscope so that morphologies may be more easily assessed or colonies
more easily counted after they are fixed.
Colonies to be counted were gently washed with lxPBS, fixed for 10 minutes in
70% methanol and stained for 10-15 minutes in a 10% Giemsa R-66 solution. After
staining, plates were washed with water and air-dried.
[2.3.2] Mitotic spreads
Mitotic spreads were prepared to assess the chromosome content of cells. Cells
were incubated in medium containing 1 mM colcemid (Sigma) for 45 minutes. 50%
confluent cultures were trypsinised and gently resuspended first in 1 ml of hypotonic
solution (0.56% w/v KC1) and then up to 5 ml. Tubes were incubated at room
temperature for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 minutes. Supernatant
was discarded and tubes flicked to ensure cell resuspension. 1 ml of ice-cold fixative (18
ml methanol, 6 ml glacial acetic acid) was added dropwise to the cells while flicking the
tube. More fixative was added until the suspension was made up to 6 ml. After 5
minutes at room temperature, tubes were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 minutes.
Supernatant was removed and cells were washed with fixative twice more as above.
Pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of fixative. Using a Pasteur pipette, single drops
of this suspension were released from approximately 30 cm above 70% ethanol-treated
slides. After evaporation of the fixative, slides were stained in 3% Giemsa R-66 for 10-
15 minutes for chromosome counting.
(2.3.31 G-banding and karyotyping
Mitotic spreads were left at room temperature for 72 hr. The slides were then
incubated in 2x SSC. The slides were incubated at 60C for lhr and then dipped in
0.25% trypsin in PBS for 5 sec and then 2% Giemsa stain in Gurr's buffer pH6.8. The
slides were left in the stain for 20 min and then washed with deionised water. The slides
were then dried on top of a drying oven for 30 min and then left at room temperature
overnight. Chromosomes were digitised and partially karyotyped using a MRC HGU
Fip-2 (KMR programme) computer assisted chromosome analysis system [Piper &
Granum 1989],
[2.3.4] Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation
Metaphase slides were generated as described in Subsection [2.3.2]. These were
fixed with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid prior to being probed using FISH. The FISH
protocol was carried out over two days: on the first day, the DNA of the chromosomes
and of the X-chromosome paint were denatured and added together to hybridise and on
the second day, unbound paint was washed away and the cells were then counterstained
and mounted.
Denaturation and Hybridisation
The chromosome paint (human X-chromosome specific probe from Cambio kit
1153-Cy3-01, Cambridge Biosciences, www.cambio.co.uk) was warmed to 37C for 5
minutes and then denatured at 65C for 10 minutes before being left at 37C until it was
used. Slides were serially dehydrated washing for 2 minutes each in 70% (v/v) EtOH,
70%, 90%, 90% and 5 minutes in 100% EtOH. The slides were air dried and left to age
for 90 minutes at 65C. The slides were then denatured by incubation in prewarmed
denaturation solution at 65C for 2 minutes. The slides were quenched in ice-cold 70%
(v/v) EtOH for 4 minutes and dehydrated by repeating the serial EtOH washings. 15 p,l
of probe was applied to each slide and coverslip were applied and sealed with rubber
cement. The slides were then placed in an air tight humidified box and incubated
overnight in the dark at 37C.
Washing and Mounting
Stringency Wash solution, 2x SSC solution and detergent wash solution were
preheated to 45C. Slides were removed from the incubator and incubated in 2x SSC
solution at 45C for 5 minutes. The rubber cement and coverslips were removed from
slides and they were washed as follows: two 5 minute washes in Stringency Wash
Solution (45C), two 5 minute washes in lx SSC solution (45C) and one 4 minute wash
in Detergent Wash solution (45C). The slides were drained well and mounted with 50
pi of Working Reagent A. Glass overslips were then applied to the slides and these were
sealed with nail varnish. Slides were viewed using standard epifluorescence filters for
Cy3 and for counterstain DAPI.
[2.3.5] Propidium Iodide staining and associated FACS analysis
Cells were disaggregated using EG, washed once with cold PBS, and processed
for cell cycle analysis as follows:
Centrifuged cells were resuspended in one volume of cold "saline GM" and fixed by
adding three volumes of 95% ethanol (-20C). After overnight fixation at 4C, cells
were pelleted, washed once with PBS/EDTA (5 mM), and stained for 2 hours at room
temperature with 50 pg / ml of propidium iodide and 100 pg / ml of RNase A in lxPBS
containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% BSA. Samples were analysed using a FACScan
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with an argon laser (excitation wavelength, 488
nM) and a 610-nM long-pass filter. For each sample, 104 events were stored for analysis.
The doublet discrimination module was applied to exclude doublets or higher-order
aggregates from DNA analysis. The percentage of cells existing in the various stages of
the cell cycle were calculated using the CELLQuest program (Becton Dickinson) to
visualize a histogram plot of red fluorescence (DNA) and by gating the cell populations
with 2n(G0/Gl phase), 2n/4n (S phase), and 4n (G2/M phase) content ofDNA.
[2.3.5] PCNA staining
A marker commonly used to assess cell proliferation, Proliferating Cell Nuclear
Antigen (PCNA) is expressed in two forms: an insoluble form, which is expressed at low
levels in quiescent and senescent cells and highly expressed in cycling cells, and an
insoluble nucleoplasm^ form which is constitutively expressed during the cell cycle.
When staining for nuclear antigens, such as PCNA, fixation is the most critical
step. The use of organic solvents (eg. ethanol, methanol, acetone) instead of cross-
linking reagents (eg. paraformaldehyde) is recommended for three reasons: (i) they only
fix insoluble PCNA, the marker for cell proliferation whereas cross-linking reagents
denature it, (ii) they are better at preserving antigenicity and (iii) paraformaldehyde
followed by acid treatment has been shown to generate artefacts [Campbell 1998], An
optimised method for staining mouse fibroblasts was developed based on Kill et al. 1991
and information from Alpha Laboratory's technical services department:
Cells were grown on glass slides. Cells were fixed in 50% acetone:50% methanol
for 4 minutes at -20C, washed twice with cold lxPBS and stored in PBS at 4C until
ready to be stained. When staining the fixed slides, the slides were removed from the
PBS and excess liquid was shaken off the slides. 25pl 1:10 aPCNA cyclin (Alpha labs
Cat # 2037) in blocking solution (PBS with 1% FCS) was added to each slide and
covered with parafilm cut to fit the surface area of each slide. The slides were incubated
overnight at 4C. Desiccation of the slides was avoided by placing them in a sealed box
containing wet paper towels. After 24 hours the slides were washed five times with
blocking solution before being incubated with the secondary antibody. 25 pi of
secondary antibody (1:100 Texas red conjugated goat anti-human IgG3 in blocking
solution) was added to each slide and covered with parafilm. Slides were placed in a
sealed box with wet paper towels and left in darkness at room temperature for 1 hour.
The slides were then washed three times in lxPBS only. Excess liquid was removed and
1 drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories,
www.vectorlabs.com) was added to each slide. Coverslips were added and sealed with
PANG solution (Pangus, www.pangus.com). After the slides had dried, they were
examined with a lOOx Fluor oil objective (Nikon, www.nikon.com), on a Nikon
Microphot-SA microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and supplied with a mercury
lamp (100W, Nikon HB 10101AF) and TXR (Nikon G-1A; excitation 546-556 nm) and
DAPI (Nikon B-2A; excitation 450-490 nm) selective filter sets. Photographs were taken
using a photomicrographic attachment (Nikon FX-35DX camera and Microflex UFX-
[2.4] Analysis of phenotype
[2.4.1] Alkaline phosphatase staining
The alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) group of enzymes hydrolyse
orthophosphoric monoesters at alkaline pH. The tissue-non-specific isozyme of this
family (TNAP), is not expressed in adult murine tissues other than in the testis, while
being highly expressed by undifferentiated cells (such as ES cells). Thus it can be used
as a biochemical marker for ES and EC cells. The Vector BCIP/NBT Alkaline
Phosphatase Substrate Kit IV (Vector Laboratories, www.vectorlabs.com) was used to
assay for alkaline phosphatase activity. The active enzyme cleaves BCIP/NBT
producing a dark blue/violet reaction product. The kit was used in accordance with the
protocol outlined by the manufacturer. Typically, samples were left to stain for 10-15
minutes in darkness before being fixed and mounted.
[2.4.2] In vitro differentiation ofmurine hybrid clones
Embryoid body formation
Cells were disaggregated with TEG, resuspended in murine embryoid body
medium and transferred to bacteriological plates. Cells were maintained in this medium
until complex embryoid bodies formed, typically 8 days for HM-ls and 10 days for HM-
1 derived hybrids.
Cardiomyogenic, neurogenic and myogenic differentiation
3-8 complex embryoid bodies were seeded in TC chamber slides and grown in
the relevant murine differentiation medium (Protocols for making cardiogenic,
neurogenic and myogenic differentiation media are listed in Section [12.1]). After 11-14
days, cells were immunostained.
[2.4.3] Immunostaining
Immunostaining cells on slides
Cells to be stained were washed with PBS twice and fixed by incubating in
freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were then washed twice with
lxPBS, then incubated in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 1% Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA) for 5 minutes. Non-specific binding was blocked using TBS-T (2%
Triton in TBS) containing 1% BSA. The cells were incubated with primary antibody
diluted in TBS-T containing 1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were
washed again TBS and TBS-T containing 1% BSA as before. Cells were then incubated
in secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (biotinylated) for 1 hour at room temperature.
The washing steps, using TBS and TBS-T containing 1% BSA, were then repeated a
third time. Cells were then incubated in 1:200 dilution of Texas Red stain (Vector
Laboratories) for 20 minutes. Cells were washed once again with TBS and then mounted
using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, www.vectorlabs.com).
Immunostaining cells for FACS analysis
Cells to be immunostained were harvested using TEG and resuspended in 9 ml
Glutamine-Free Glasgow's Modified Eagle's Medium (GMEM). 1 ml aliquots were
dispensed into 9 prelabelled tubes (label specified cell line and antibodies to be used).
The tubes were spun at 3,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and the
cells were resuspended in 50 pi of blocking buffer. Non-specific binding was blocked by
leaving the cells in blocking buffer for 15 minutes on ice. The primary antibody or
staining buffer was added to the appropriate tube. The samples were the incubated on ice
for 30 min. 3.0 ml staining buffer was added to each tube and the samples were spun at
3,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatants were removed and 100 pi of appropriately
diluted secondary antibody or preconjugated antibody in staining buffer was added to
each sample. The samples were incubated for 30 minutes on ice in the dark. 3.0 ml
lxPBS was added to each sample to wash away excess antibody. The cells were spun for
3000 g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 1 ml 0.01% ParaFormAldehyde (PFA) in
lxPBS. The samples were stored at 4C in darkness until they were FACS analysed.
Samples were FACS analysed within a week of preparation.
[2.4.4] In vivo differentiation
The potency of hybrid cell lines in vivo was assessed by injecting adult severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice strain C.B-17/Icr (Flarlan UK Ltd,
www.harlan.com) with cells and analysing the resultant tumours histologically.
SCID mice injections
Single 200 pi aliquots containing 2x107 cells in PBS were injected into the calf
muscle of anaesthetised C.B-17/Icr mice. When tumours became evident, the injected
mice were culled and their tumours were promptly removed and fixed in 4x PFA. Due to
their large size, the tumours were cut into segments to ensure complete perfusion with
the fixative. Fixed tumour segments were stored in 4x PFA at 4C.
The tumour segments were immersed in fresh 4x PFA the day prior to paraffin
embedding and left on a roller overnight at room temperature. Each segment was then
paraffin embedded using a Shandon Hypercentre XP processor (Shandon Scientific UK
Ltd, www.shandon.com) that treated the tissue as detailed in Table 2.2.

Table 2.2 Protocol used to automatically embed tumour segments in paraffin
A Shandon Hypercentre XP processor (Shandon Scientific UK Ltd, www.shandon.com)
was programmed to treat the tumour segments as detailed. The tissue was first
dehydrated using ethanol and cleared prior to embedding using Paraffin Clearing Agent
(Sakura Finetek USA, INC., www.sakuraus.com). 'PCA' and 'RT' are abbreviations of
'Paraffin Clearing Agent' and 'Room Temperature' respectively.
Embedded tissue was cut into 6 pm thick sections using a Microm HM325 rotary
microtome (MICROM International GmbH, www.microm.de). The sections were
transferred to polylysine coated microscope slides. These slides were dried overnight at
37C before staining.
Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining
The dried slides were deparaffinised in xylene for 1 hour and rehydrated in
successively more dilute solutions of ethanol (2 minute incubations in 100%, 90%, 80%,
70% EtOH, and H2O). These were then incubated in haematoxylin for 5 min and
developed under running water for 5 minutes. The sections were then stained for 2-5
minutes with eosin (Sigma, www.sigma.com) and transferred to H2O for 2 minutes
before being dehydrated in EtOH (15 second incubations in 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%
EtOH). The slides were then incubated in xylene for 1 hour to remove the alcohol.
Xylene was then allowed to evaporate from the slides by placing them in a fume
cupboard for 1 hr. Finally the sections were mounted in DPX (a synthetic resin made
from distyrene, tricresyl phosphate and xylene) and left to dry at 37C overnight.
Histological analysis of H&E stained sections
In addition to the student's own efforts, the sections were independently assessed
by Dr. Bob Fleming (Roslin Institute) and Dr. Edward Duvall (Pathology Department,
University of Edinburgh Medical School). Analysis was carried out using light
microscopy (10-200 x magnification).
Paraffin removal and immunostaining of embedded sections
Paraffin was removed by incubating sections in xylene (BDH) for five minutes
(three times). Slides were rehydrated by incubation in absolute ethanol for five minutes
(twice) followed by incubation in 95% ethanol for five minutes (twice). Slides were
washed in dH20 for five minutes (twice) and then in PBS for five minutes. To unmask
antigens, slides were incubated in 10 mM trisodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes at
100C. Slides were then washed in dH20 for five minutes (three times) and lxPBS for
five minutes. Stripped sections were immunostained with anti-ezrin to confirm the
presence of endoderm. This was done as follows: Slides were incubated in blocking
solution for 1 hour and then incubated in ezrin antibody overnight at 4C (1:100). Slides
were washed for 20 minutes in PBST (three times) and incubated with AP-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 hour (1:200). Slides were washed for 20 minutes three times
using 0.01% Tritin-T in lxPBS (PBS-T) and incubated in AP staining solution. Slides
were mounted in aquamount (BDH).
[2.4.5] LacZ staining
Cells were washed in lxPBS and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature in
fixing solution. The cells were subsequently washed 3 times with washing solution. The
cells were covered in LacZ staining solution at 37C until staining of appropriate
intensity was achieved (3-6 hours typically). Cells were then washed three times in
lxPBS and examined under the microscope. LacZ expressing cells will stain blue, as the
gene product of LacZ ((3-galactosidase) catalyses the hydrolysis ofX-gal.
[2.5] Manipulation and analysis ofDNA
[2.5.1] Extraction of mammalian genomic DNA
The following procedure for mammalian DNA isolation has been adapted from
Laird et al. (1991). Cell cultures were rinsed once with lxPBS before addition of lysis
buffer (3 ml for 25 cm2 flasks, 10 ml for 75 cm2 flasks). Following overnight incubation
at 37C with gentle shaking, one volume of isopropanol was added to the lysate. Samples
were shaked for several hours until a white DNA precipitate was visible. Using a Pasteur
pipette, the DNA was lifted and placed in an Eppendorf tube. Excess liquid was
eliminated and the DNA was dissolved in 500 pi of Tris HC1 buffer pH 8.5. Vials were
incubated at 70C for 3 hours.
[2.5.2] Extraction of plasmid DNA from bacteria
Minipreps
For routine plasmid DNA extraction from bacteria, individually picked colonies
were incubated overnight at 37C in Falcon 15 ml tubes containing 5-7 ml of Luria-
Bertani (LB) bacterial medium supplemented with 100 pg/ml of ampicillin. Following
centrifugation of 1.5 ml cultures (10,000 g for 5 minutes) supernatants were discarded
and pellets resuspended in 250pl of solution 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 nM EDTA,
100 pg / ml RNase A). Lysis buffer (250 pi of 200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS) was
subsequently added to this solution, which was gently mixed and incubated for 5 minutes
at room temperature. The lysis reaction was stopped by adding 350 pi of neutralising
solution (3.0M potassium acetate pFI 5.5). Immediately after centrifugation (13,000 g for
10 min) supernatant was recovered and taken to a fresh tube, where it was mixed with an
equal volume of isopropanol and centrifuged again (13,000 g for 10 minutes). Pellets
were air-dried for 5 minutes and then resuspended in a 50 pi of Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5.
For those applications requiring high purity DNA (such as subcloning), the Qiagen
miniprep kit was used as directed by the manufacturer.
Maxipreps
Purification of large amounts of plasmid DNA for electroporation was done using
the Qiagen Maxiprep kits. These procedures yielded an average of 500-1000 pg ofDNA
from 500 ml cultures.
[2.5.3] DNA purification
Phenol/chloroform is used to extract and purify nucleic acids from a variety of sources
[Sambrook et al. 1989]. An equal volume of 1:1 phenokchloroform (Life Technologies)
added to an aqueous DNA solution causes the denaturation and dissociation of proteins
from DNA. After inverting several times the tube containing the mixture, centrifugation
(13,000 g for 20 minutes) yields two distinct phases: a lower organic phenol :chloroform
phase containing the protein (mostly in the white, flocculent interface) and the lighter
aqueous phase with the DNA.
DNA was recovered from the aqueous solution by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium
acetate pH 5.5 and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol (alternatively, 1 volume of isopropanol
can be used). The tube was mixed and then chilled for at least 30 minutes at -80 C or 2
hours at -20C. This ensures a 75 % recovery for volumes <1 ml containing at least 10
pg of DNA. For very low DNA concentrations, 2 pi of seeDNA (Amersham,
www.amersham.com) were added to each tube, regardless of the volume. This pink-
coloured reagent co-precipitates with the DNA and makes identification of the pellet
easier. The tube was subsequently centrifuged for 30 minutes (13,000 g, 4C),
supernatant removed, and the pellet rinsed once with 500 pi 70 % ethanol. This step is
essential for removing the excess salt, and for very sensitive applications (such as blunt-
end ligation) it was done twice. The tube was centrifuged as before for 5 minutes, and
the pellet allowed to air-dry for 5 minutes after removal of excess ethanol. DNA was
resuspended in an appropriate volume of distilled water or TE buffer pH 8.5.
[2.5.4] DNA quantitation
Quantitation of diluted DNA (typically 1:100 in distilled water) was performed in an
UNICAM 5625 UV/VIS spectrophotometer at a X = 260 nm. Since an optical density
(O.D.) of 1 corresponds approximately to 50 pg/ml of double-stranded DNA, DNA
concentration can be calculated in the following manner:
concentration ofDNA = OD260 x 50 pg/ ml x dilution ratio (e.g. 100 or 400)
When there was not sufficient DNA for spectrophotometric assay, fluorescent yields of
lpl aliquots were compared to a series of standards of the same size in ethidium
bromide-supplemented agarose gels.
[2.5.5] DNA Analysis and Manipulation
[2.5.5.1] Restriction analysis of DNA
Genomic and plasmid DNA were digested using restriction enzymes and buffers
(Roche, www.roche.com) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For DNA
analysis, a 10-fold excess of enzyme was normally used. The following examples
describe the typical proportions of reagents in a standard linearisation of plasmid DNA
for electroporation (1) and restriction analysis (2), respectively.
(1) 200 pi (1 pg/pl) plasmid DNA, 50 pi Buffer H, 30 pi EcoRl (10 units/pl), (1 unit
restriction enzyme cuts 1 pg DNA per hour), 220 pi distilled H2O. Total
volume: 500 pi. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2-4 hours at 37C.
(2) 1 pi (1 pg/pl) plasmid DNA, 2 pi Buffer H, 1 pi coRI (10 units/pl), 220 pi
distilled H2O. Total volume: 500 pi. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2-4
hours at 37C.
After digestion, and following the addition of 6x loading buffer, samples were loaded
in agarose gels (The gels were made with 0.1% (v/v) ethidium bromide and 0.6-3%
(w/v) agarose in TAE depending on band size of interest). Agarose gels were run in TAE
buffer either for 2hr (50-90 V) or overnight (25-40 V). A UV transilluminator was used
to visualise bands on gels.
[2.5.5.1] Extraction of DNA bands from agarose gels
DNA bands were extracted from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction
kit (Quigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dissolved gels are poured into
minicolumns and centrifuged. DNA is retained in the minicolumns as it binds to
positively charged silica gel within. The DNA is then eluted using a high salt elution
buffer.
[2.5.5.3] DNA Ligation
Ligation of DNA fragments was performed using the rapid DNA ligation kit
(Roche, www.roche.com) according to the manufacturer's instruction. This system
enables sticky-end or blunt-end ligations in 5-10 minutes at room temperature. Ligation
reactions contained no more than 200 ng of total DNA (insert and vector) in a total
volume of 21 pi. The molar ratio used was always 1:4. Prior to ligation, vectors were
incubated (1 hr, 37C) with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) (Amersham,
www.amersham.com) in order to de-phosphorylate the ends and prevent self-ligation.
SAP was heat inactivated by incubating the sample at 65C for 15 min.
Where required, blunt ends were generated by adding 1-5 units of the Klenow enzyme
and lpl of lOmM each dNTP to the restriction digest mixture (30 minutes at room
temperature). The Klenow fragment consists of the C-terminal domain of E.coli DNA
polymerase I, which lacks the 5'-3' exonuclease activity while retaining the DNA
polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities [Joyce & Grindley 1983].
The following example described a typical ligation reaction with a 1:4 vector to
insert ratio: 100 ng vector DNA (10 kb) and 40ng insert DNA were dissolved with 2pl
of 5x DNA Rapid Ligation buffer (Roche) in a total volume of lOpl (distilled water
added as required). After thorough mixing, 10 pi of 2x DNA Rapid Ligation buffer
(Roche) were pipetted into the vial. The soltion was mixed again before the final
addition of 5 units (1 pi) of T4 DNA ligase (Roche, www.roche.com). The ligation
mixture was incubated for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
[2.5.5.4] Transformation of bacterial cells with DNA
For routine circular plasmid transformation, Subcloning Efficiency DH5a
competent cells (Life Technologies, www.lifetechnologies.com) were used. 50 pi
aliquots of these cells were thawed on ice and incubated with 50-500 ng of plasmid DNA
for 30 minutes. After a 20 second heat shock at 37C, vials were placed on ice for two
minutes. Following 1 hour of incubation in 900 pi of the LB medium (37C, on a cell
shaker at 200 rpm), cultures were diluted as necessary, seeded on antibiotic
supplemented agar plates (2 pg/ml ampicillin was generally used, though when plasmids
only containing a zeocin resistance cassette were use to transform cells, 5 pg/ml zeocin
was used). The agar plates were incubated overnight at 37C
[2.5.6] Plasmids
pPUR (Clontech) is a selection vector that confers puromycin resistance to eukaryotic
cells [De la Luna et al. 1992], The puromycin resistance gene of pPUR can be used as a
dominant selectable marker to select for stably transformed mammalian cell lines. This
resistance gene, the Streptomyces alboniger puromycin-N-acetyl-transferase (pac) gene,
is cloned between the SV40 early promoter and polyadenylation signals to create a
cassette that will be expressed in mammalian cells. Cells expressing pac are resistant to
the antibiotic puromycin [See Subsection [2.2.4] for more on puromycin selection].
pSV40neo
pSV40neo is a selection vector that confers G418 resistance to eukaryotic cells
[Schmidhauser et al. 1992], The neomycin reisitance of pSV40neo can be used as a
dominant selectable marker for stably transforming mammalian lines. The resistance
gene, neo, is cloned in between the SV40 early promoter and polyadenylation
polyadenylation signals to create a cassette that will be expressed in mammalian cells
[See Subsection [2.2.4] for more on G418 selection],
pBI-G
pBI-G Vector (Clontech) is a response plasmid that can be used to express a gene
of interest and b-galactosidase from a bidirectional tet-responsive promoter Pbi which is
responsive to the rtTA regulatory proteins in the Tet-On systems [Baron 1995][Gossen et
al. 1995], Pbi contains the Tet-responsive element (TRE), which consists of seven copies
of the 42-bp tet operator sequence (tetO). The TRE element is between two minimal
CMV promoters (PminCMV), which lack the enhancer that is part of the complete CMV
promoter. Consequently, Pbi is silent in the absence of binding of TetR or rTetR to the
tetO sequences. PminCMV-1 controls the expression of the gene of interest; and
PminCMV-2 controls the expression of beta-galactosidase. This plasmid was used in this
work as the expression of a gene of interest could be monitored indirectly via the beta-
galactosidase reporter function (See Subsection [2.4.5] for details on LacZ staining).
pB-RMCE2722
pB-RCME2722 contains a multiple cloning site (MCS) flanked by incompatible
loxP sites (wild type loxP and lox2722). It was used in Chapter 8 to introduce introduce
incompatible loxP sites on either side of the nucleoplasmin cassette so that other
transgenes could be inserted into pTetNPM (See Fig 12.5). This plasmid was a gift from
Dr.Andreas Kolb. pB-RCMEBSD is a plasmid derived from this one. A 1.5kb
blasticidin cassette was inserted into the EcoRI site in the mutiple cloning site.
pUCNPM
pUCNPM contains a the nucleoplasmid coding sequence which may be excised
as a 0.8kb EcoRI fragment [Dingwall et al. 1987], This plasmid was a gift from Prof.
Ron Laskey.
[2.6] Manipulation and analysis of RNA
[2.6.1] RNA extraction and quantitation
RNA was extracted from mammalian cell cultures using the TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, www.lifetechnologies.com), according to manufacturer's instructions.
This product is a mono-phasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate that
maintains the integrity of total RNA while lysing and dissolving cell components.
Addition of chloroform and centrifugation separates the solution into an organic phase
(bottom) and an aqueous phase (top), from which RNA can be isolated by isopropanol
precipitation. Quantitation was performed as described for DNA. 1 OD at 260 nm
corresponds to ~40 pg / ml of single-stranded RNA.
[2.6.2] RNA analysis
RNA Quantitation
RNA has to be maintained at denaturing conditions at all times in order to avoid
the formation of secondary structures by intramolecular base pairing. This was achieved
by treating agarose gels with formaldehyde. In order to prevent degradation of the
samples, RNase free solutions and glassware were used. Autoclaved water was treated
with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and working surfaces were thoroughly cleaned
with RNaseZAP. The following protocol has been adapted from that of Sambrook et al.
(1989): The pH of lOx Running Buffer (RB) was adjusted to 7.0 with 5M NaOH.
Formaldehyde agarose gels (0.8-1.2%) were prepared by melting the appropriate amount
of agarose in 10 ml lOx RB, 72.1 ml DEPC-water and 17.9 ml of 38% formaldehyde.
Gels were poured and set inside a fume hood. RNA samples (max 40pg) were dissolved
in a total volume of 20pl of sample buffer (200pl of lOx RB, 1ml of deionised
formamide and 356 pi of 38% formaldehyde) and then heated to 65C for 5 minutes.
8 pi of dye solution (7.5% Ficoll 400 and bromophenol blue) were added to each sample
before loading. After overnight running in lxRB (20mA), gels were stained in lx RB
containing 5-10 mg of ethidium bromide and photographed under UV transillumination.
The absence of RNA degradation was verified by running an aliquot of the RNA of a
formaldehyde gel. The production of distinct clear bands and the absence of smearing
indicated good RNA quality.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
RT-PCR was performed using the First Strand preamplification kit (Amersham,
www.amersham.com) as outlined by the manufacturer. This system is designed to
synthesise first strand complementary DNA (cDNA) from purified total RNA, making
use of oligo (dT) primers for hybridisation with the 3' poly-A tails found in eukaryotic
mRNAs. The first strand cDNA synthesis reaction is catalysed by the enzyme M-MLV
RNase H" reverse transcriptase (RT). This enzyme degrades any DNA present while
leaving the RNA intact. PCR was then used to amplify single stranded-cDNAs obtained
by mRNA retrotranscription. PCR reactions using RT-untreated RNA extracts were
made up as controls to rule out genomic contamination of the RNA samples.
[2.7] Polymerase Chain Reaction
All PCRs were performed on the Omnigene Hybaid thermal cycler in 50 ml
reaction mixtures with 16 mM (NPL^SCU, 67 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 0.01% Tween-20,
1.5 mM MgCh, 2.5 units Taq polymerase, 200 pM dNTPs. Template genomic DNA or
cDNA of 0.2 -1 pg was used with primers at a final concentration of 0.2 pM.
a -FETOPROTEIN:
Primers AFPRT FWD (5'-AGTTTTCTGAGGGATGAAACC-3') and AFPRT REV
(5'-TCCAAAAGGCCCGAGAAATC-3') with 2 min at 94C, 30 cycles of 30 sees at

minutes at 72C. Expected fragment size: 2,100 bp.
[2.8] Protein analysis
[2.8.1] Generation ofwhole cell lysates
Whole thymuses were extracted from eight 6-7 week old CBA wild type female
mice and placed in 2 ml lxPBS supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail as per the
manufacturer's instructions (Roche, www.roche.com). The thymuses were made into a
single cell suspension by passing the cells through an 18G syringe after cutting up the
glands in lxPBS using fine dissecting scissors. This suspension was divided into two
equal aliquots. One aliquot was heat shocked (42C for 10 min) and the other was left at
room temperature. The aliquots were then incubated for 2 hours at 37C. The
suspensions were homogenised using a sonicator. An equal volume of 2x Sodium
Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) loading buffer was added to the homogenate and the samples
were boiled for 10 minutes to lyse the cells. Lysates were kept on ice when in use and
stored at -70C to prevent protein renaturation.
[2.8.2] Protein quantitation
The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using a BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce, www.piercenet.com). The assay is based on the formation of a purple
complex formed when substances containing two or more peptide bonds react with
copper salts in the reagent causing the reduction of Cu2+ to Cul+. Cuprous ions are then
sequestered by the bicinchonic acid (BCA) in the reagent forming a purple complex that
may be assayed by measuring absorbance at 562 nm. There is a linear relationship
between absorbance of the purple Cu2+ BCA complex and protein concentration below
1000 pg / ml. For each quantitation, diluted serum albumin (BSA) standards are
prepared (0-500 pg / ml) using the kit as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol.
These were used to generate a standard curve using the kit as indicated by the
manufacturer's protocol. Various dilutions of samples were incubated in parallel with
the standards and 520 nm OD values were compared against the standard curve. The
protein concentrations of the diluted samples were calculated from the standard curve.
[2.8.3] Western Blotting
Western blotting was used to detect specific proteins in a complex mixture such
as a cell lysate. The method consists of three steps:
(a) fractionating the protein mixture by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis;
(b) transferring and immobilizing the mixture onto a solid membrane and
(c) incubation of the membrane with an antibody raised to the protein of interest
and assaying for specific antibody binding.
Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
This was carried out using an X-cell Surelock Mini-cell apparatus (Invitrogen,
www.invitrogen.com). 10-12% gels were run in lxTris-Glycine running buffer. Samples
containing 150pg protein were boiled for 5 mins before being placed on ice to cool prior
to loading. Gels were run according to manufacturer's instructions.
Staining the blot for total protein
Using wet gloved hands the portion of the gel to be stained was cut out and
carefully transferred to a tank with 50 ml staining/fixative (50 ml 100% methanol, 75 ml
acetic acid, 20 g TCA, 0.4 g coomasie blue g250, and 450 ml dfUO). This was then
placed in an air-tight container to avoid evaporation and shaken on a cell shaker for two
hours. The gel was then destained by gently shaking the gel in 50 ml destaining solution
(230 ml methanol, 70 ml acetic acid, 700 ml dfUO) for 30 minutes. The destaining
solution was then decanted before adding another 50 ml fresh destaining solution and
shaking for another 30 minutes. The plate was then removed photographed and wrapped
in Saran wrap and stored at 4C.
Semi-Dry Electroblotting
Semi-dry electroblotting was used in preference to traditional wet methods as it
was quicker and required less buffer. Semi-dry electroblotting was carried out as
follows: the gel to be transferred was equilibriated in transfer buffer for 30 minutes to
removes salt and detergents which would hinder transfer of protein to the membrane.
The membrane (Millipore Immobilon-P Transfer PVDF membrane, pore size 0.45 pm)
was cut to the dimensions of the gel. The membrane was carefully placed in transfer
buffer and left for 30 minutes. The membrane was kept wet at all times to insure proper
binding. Gloves were worn when handling the membrane.
Filter paper was cut into the dimensions of the gel. Two pieces of thick filter
paper per gel are needed for each gel/membrane sandwich. The filter paper was
completely saturated by soaking in transfer buffer. The pre-wetted blotting media was
placed on top of the filter paper and all the air bubbles were removed. The equilibriated
gel was carefully placed on top of the gel on the centre of the membrane. It was made
sure that the gel did not hang over the blotting media. All air bubbles were removed.
Another sheet of pre-soaked filter paper was placed on top of the gel, and again air
bubbles were carefully removed from between the gel and filter paper.
The cathode was carefully placed onto the stack. The latches were engaged without
disturbing the filter paper stack. The safety cover was placed on the unit and then
plugged into a power supply. Normal transfer polarity is cathode to anode. Transfer was
performed at 200-300 mA (<22 V) for 1 hour.
Immunoblotting
If the hybond membrane was allowed to dry, it was rehydrated by placing it in
methanol for 10 seconds, and then washing it in water before being transferred to
blocking solution.
The membrane was pre-blocked in blocking solution for 2-4 hr at 37C. A second
membrane similar to the first was always prepared and blotted with the secondary
antibody only as a control for non-specific secondary antibody binding.
The primary antibody was mixed in fresh blocking solution (1:1000) and the
membrane was incubated in this overnight at 4C. The membrane then washed six times
at room temperature (each wash lasted 10 minutes and used >10ml wash solution). The
membrane was then washed twice for 5 minutes in lxPBS. The secondary antibody was
diluted 1:100 in blocking solution and the membrane was incubated in this for 2 hours at
room temperature. Subsequently the membrane was washed in wash solution and then
lxPBS in a similar manner to that carried out after incubation with the primary antibody.
Secondary antibodies used for Western Blotting were conjugated to horseradish
    
peroxidase (HRP), which catalyses the oxidation of luminol in the ECL
chemiluminescence reaction mix (Amersham, www.amersham.com). This resulted in
the emission of light and detection after quick exposures of X-ray films. The membrane
was developed using ECL western reagents (as directed by the manufacturer). The
membrane was covered in Saran wrap and X-ray film was exposed to it using a film
exposure cassette. The exposed X-ray film was then developed using a Konica SRX
101A developer.
[3] Generation of cell hybrids from murine ES cells
[3.1] Introduction
The process underpinning lineage commitment and differentiation of the
mammalian somatic cell is poorly understood and has, until recently, been assumed to be
unidirectional. However, several observations now show that the differentiated state of
the cell can be experimentally manipulated [See Section [1.4] for details].
Cell fusion is a versatile technique, which has been utilised in characterising, and
mapping genes involved in tumour suppression [as reviewed by Stanbridge 1998], cell
senescence [as reviewed by Ning & Pereira-Smith 1991] and aspects of differentiation
[as reviewed by Blau 1999], This technique has potential to contribute to the
understanding of somatic cell reprogramming and the molecular events leading to
differentiation.
Nuclear reprogramming has been defined as the process by which a
differentiated somatic nucleus reacquires developmental potential [Singh 2000]. ES
phenotypic cell hybrids have been generated from fusions between murine ES cells and
murine somatic cells [Pells et al. 2002][Tada et al. 2001]. These observations indicate
that somatic cells can be reprogrammed via fusion with Embryonic Stem cells.
This chapter details the generation of cell hybrids by fusing murine ES cells with
murine somatic cells. It describes attempts to optimise the protocol so large numbers of
cell hybrids are reproducibly generated. Subsequently Chapter [4] deals with the
characterisation of the cell hybrids generated. Chapters [5-9] then uses this hybrid
system to study the affect of various factors known or thought to perturb patterns of gene
expression on the nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells.
[3.2] Objectives
1) To generate cell hybrids from fusions ofmurine ES cells and somatic cells.
2) To optimise the generation of such hybrids.
[3.3] Results and discussion
[3.3.1] Development of selection regimes to isolate murine hybrid cells
When two cell types are mixed and induced to fuse [See Fig 2.2], some cells do
not fuse, others fuse to cells of the same cell type (homokaryon formation) and yet
others fuse to cells of the other cell type (heterokaryon formation). Without an
appropriate selection regime hybrid cells are quickly overgrown by unfused cell types.
In order to isolate cell hybrids derived from fusions of murine ES cells and somatic
cells, it was necessary to develop selection regimes where unfused cells and hybrids
derived from homokaryons are removed.
As outlined in Subsection [2.2.4], various forms of selection were used to isolate
cell hybrids derived from fusions of murine ES cells and somatic cells. In nearly all
murine experiments, unfused ES cells were removed using HAT selection. The murine
ES cell line used was HM-1, a hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase deficient line
developed by Selfridge et al. (1992). Aminopterin prevents both unfused HM-1 cells and
HM-1 homokaryons from synthesizing nucleotides de novo (See Subsection [2.2.4]) and
consequently such cells die in HAT selection.
Unfused somatic cells and somatic homokaryons can also removed by selection.
In fact, inherent conditions of culture can, on their own, act a form of selection. Murine
thymocytes [Sawa et al. 1997] and splenocytes [Matveeva et al. 1998] require
considerably different culture conditions from murine ES cells and die when cultured in
murine ES cell medium. They also grow in suspension rather on the flask surface like
ES cells and other adherent cell-types do. Thus when fusing mES cells to these cell
types, additional levels of selection are not required to isolate hybrid colonies. Other cell
types however can grow under the murine ES cell culture conditions (e.g. fibroblasts). In
such cases, additional levels of selection against unfused somatic cells and somatic
homokaryons are required.
In order to isolate cell hybrids from fusions of PEFs and HM-1 cells, puromycin
was used to select against unfused PEFs and PEF homokaryons. A puromycin kill curve
for PEFs was generated (Fig 3.1) showed that 2.5pg / ml puromycin is the minimum
concentration required to completely kill all PEFs.

15 gelatinised 10cm plates were each seeded with 1x10s primary embryonic fibroblasts
(passage number 1) and were incubated in murine ES medium. After 24hr, plates were
divided into groups of three and each group was fed murine ES media supplemented
with a different concentration of puromycin antibiotic [0-5 (ig / ml]. Cells were cultured
for an additional 12 days while maintaining the concentration of puromycin. Cells
incubated in 0 pg / ml puromycin reached confluence during this time and these cells
were trypsinised and transferred to larger gelatinised dishes. After 9 days in puromycin,
PEFs were trypsinised and the number of cells in each well as counted. The graph shows
the mean cell count calculated from each group of triplicate plates incubated with a
different concentration of puromycin. Error bars represent standard error of the mean
cell number.
As wild-type HM-1 cells also die at this concentration of puromycin and so a puromycin
resistant HM-1 clone, HM-lpuro, had to be generated. This was done by lipofecting HM-
1 cells (passage 13) with pPUR (See Subsection [2.1.2.1] for details of how cells were
transfected and Subsection [2.3.5] for a description of pPUR). pPUR contains a cassette
where the SV40 promoter constitutively drives expression of the puromycin resistance
gene, pac. After transfection with pPUR, stably tranfected clones were selected using
murine ES medium supplemented with 2.5 pg / ml puromycin. After 12 days in
selection, pac expressing, puromycin resistant colonies was picked and expanded. One
of these transfected subclones, HM-lpuro, was used in all hybridisation experiments
where hybrid cells were to be derived from murine ES cell x PEF fusions. Puromycin
was chosen as it quickly kills unfused PEFs or PEF derived homokaryons before they
overgrew hybrid colonies derived from heterokaryons.
Previous forms of selection isolated hybrids generated from heterokaryons. An
additional level of selection was developed to isolate hybrids in which reprogramming
of a somatically derived Oct-4 transgene was required (See Subsection [2.2.4]). It was
assumed and later confirmed that in somatic cells derived from CBA0ct"eo/0ct'eo mice, the
transgenic Oct-4 promoter is inactive and did not drive neo expression (Fig [4.3]). By
placing cells in the appropriate concentration of G418, only cells expressing neo would
survive (due to the reprogramming of the somatically derived Oct4 transgene). The
appropriate concentration of G418 to use was identified by generating a G418 kill curve
for HM-1 cells [Fig 3.2], All HM-1 cells are killed with G418 concentrations of
150pg / ml or greater. In subsequent fusion experiments, double selection of lxHAT and
150pg / ml G418 was applied to isolate reprogrammed hybrids.

Fifteen gelatinised 10cm plates were each seeded with 2x105 HM-1 cells and incubated
in murine ES medium. After 24 hours, plates were divided into groups of three and each
group was fed murine ES media supplemented with a different concentration of G418
[0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 pg / ml]. Cells were cultured for an additional 9 days while
maintaining the concentration of G418. Cells incubated in both 0 and 50 pg / ml G418
reached confluence during this time and these cells were trypsinised and transferred to
larger gelatinised dishes. After 9 days in G418, cells were trypsinised and the number of
cells in each well as counted. The graph shows the mean cell count calculated from each
group triplicate plates incubated with a different concentration of G418. Error bars
represent standard error of the mean cell number.
Before attempting to generate cell hybrids, cell fusion was assayed under the
physical conditions that were to be used to generate cell hybrids. As large numbers of
cells would be required for hybridisation experiments, it was important to ensure cell
fusion was occurring at a sufficient frequency. Obviously if heterokaryon formation was
not occurring, no cell hybrids could be produced.
[3.3.2] HM-1 cells can be fused to other HM-1 cells or to thymocytes
The prevailing dogma in the literature states that cells of the same cell type more
readily fuse to each other than to cells of another cell type or species. Thus HM-1 cells
were first electropulsed with other HM-1 cells in order to perfect the method of staining
and fusing cells. As described in Subsection [2.2.5], the two cell aliquots were
previously stained, each with a different cytoplasmic dye. The cells are then mixed and
electropulsed. Two-dye FACS analysis (Subsection [12.1]) was then used to measure
the proportion of cells that are stained with both dyes. Controlling for dye leakage, an
assessment of the proportion of viable cells fusing can be made [Fig 3.3]. It was
calculated that 12.4% of HM-1 cells were fused to form homokaryons.
Next, HM-1 cells were electropulsed with a different cell type (thymocytes) to
generate heterokaryons. Fig 3.4 shows data from which the proportion of viable cells
forming viable heterokaryons was calculated to 7.2%. Unfused thymocytes died within a
few hours of being placed in murine ES cell medium, so the leakage control and fusion
histograms do not show a cluster of CMTMR stained cells in the upper left quadrant as
previously seen in Fig 3.3. Unfused thymocytes, along with other dead cells, had been
gated out using the Forward Scatter / Side Scatter histogram as discussed in Section
[2.2.5],
It should be noted that the percentages in Fig 3.3 and Fig 3.4 are not directly
comparable because in the first experiment the HM-1 cells are viable in the culture
conditions used, whereas in the second experiment > 16% of the cells (thymocytes and
hybrids displaying a thymocyte phenotype) are not.

[3.3.3] Colonies were generated by electropulsing mixtures of HM-1 cells and
thymocytes and then selecting for cell hybrids generated from heterokaryons
HM-1 cells and thymocytes could be electrofused to produce viable
heterokaryons. Whether hybrid cells could be derived from such fusions of HM-1 cells
and thymocytes was now investigated. Two fusion experiments were carried out, the
results of which are summarised in Table 3.1 and Fig 3.5. Control and electropulsed
mixtures of HM-1 cells and thymocytes, which were not placed in selection, quickly
reached confluence within two days. This confirmed that electropulsing the cells, in
itself, did not significantly affect cell viability.

selection being applied. Plates were maintained in lxHAT selection for 12 days by

lxl 07 HM-1 cells and 5xl07 CBA0ct"eo/0c"eo thymocytes were electropulsed as described
in Subsection [2.2.5]. The electropulsed cells were divided equally between three 15cm
gelatinised plates and cultured in mES medium for 24hr. After 24hr, mES medium was
applied to the first plate, mES medium supplemented with lxHAT to the second, and
mES medium supplemented with both lxHAT and 150pg / ml G418 to the third. Plates
were maintained under these conditions for 12 days by which time colonies had stopped
appearing on the plates. Panel A The colour code used to highlight whether single or

Graph showing mean hybrid yield for single and double selection plates from three

Electropulsed mixtures of cells where only one cell type (HM-1 cells or
thymocytes) was present did not generate colonies [Table 3.1]. This shows that as
expected homokaryons and unfused cells are not viable in lxHAT selection as expected.
An electropulsed mixture of lxlO7 HM-1 cells and 5x107 thymocytes yielded 109
colonies under lxHAT selection verifying hybrids could be generated as others has
previously done [Tada et al. 2001] [Gallagher & MeWhir Unpublished]. Electrofusions
of HM-1 cells and thymocytes yielded colonies at low frequencies (~1 colony per 6xl05
cells electropulsed) similar to those generated by Gallagher & McWhir (Unpublished).
Previous studies electrofusing EG cells with thymocytes also reported similar
hybridisation frequencies using HAT selection [Surani et al. 1997]. Chemically induced
fusion, using polyethylene glycol reported similar hybridisation frequencies both using
HM-1 cells and splenocytes [Matveeva et al. (1983)] or EC cells and thymocytes
[Tagaki et al. (1983)].
All colonies generated here displayed a classic murine ES cell morphology [Fig
3.6], However, only cell hybrids expressing an ES cell phenotype were being selected
for and it is unknown whether hybrids of a somatic phenotype could have also arisen.
Fewer colonies were generated in double selection plates than single selection
plates (99 versus 109). The lower colony number in double selection plates could be due
to the necessary retention within the hybrid nucleus of two chromosomes, one
containing the active hprt gene and the other containing the integrated neo gene, instead
of just one chromosome, that containing the hprt gene, which would be required for
viability in single selection plates. It could also be due cells not being completely
resistant to the concentration of G418 used in double selection.
Colonies were picked and expanded. These lines maintained an ES cell
morphology. Such cells are hereafter referred to as TESH cells (abbreviated from
'putative Thymocyte ES cell Hybrid').
Fig 3.6 All colonies derived from selection plates displayed a murine ES cell
morphology
Representative images of colonies are shown. All colonies, derived either from HM-1
fusions with either thymocytes or fibroblasts, displayed morphology indistinct from
HM-1 cells. Images A, B and C are typical hybrid colonies derived from thymocyte
fusions. Image D is a typical colony from a primary embryonic fibroblast fusion (See
Section [3.3.4]).
[3.3.4] Colonies were generated by pulsing HM-lpuro cells and primary
embryonic fibroblasts and selecting for cell hybrids generated from
heterokaryons
In order to investigate whether cell hybrids could be generated from other
somatic cell types, HM-1 electrofusions with primary embryonic fibroblasts
(PEFct"eo/0ct"eo) were performed. Cells were fused, resuspended in mES medium and
plated on 10 cm gelatinised plates. Twenty four hours after plating the cells were placed
under lxHAT and 2|ig/ml puromycin selection. Fibroblasts grew to confluency before
dying in HAT selection, so the cells were disaggregated with TEG and plated in larger
40 cm gelatinised dishes. Selection was maintained for 12 days. Colonies were
generated (Table 3.2).

2.5 pg / ml puromycin) 24 hours after fusion and left for 3 days before being
disaggregated with TEG and transferred to gelatinised 40 cm dishes due to fibroblast
confluency. Selection was continued for 12 days by which time colonies had stopped
appearing on the plates.
[3.3.5] Colonies were generated by PEG induced fusions of HM-1 cells
with thymocytes but not splenocytes
Colonies had been derived from fusions using thymocytes and PEFs. In order to
show a broader range of cell types could be reprogrammed, attempts were made to
generate ES cell hybrids from splenocytes. Initial experiments, each electrofusing 107
cells HM-1 cells with 5x107 CBA splenocytes in a manner similar to the previous
thymocyte experiments, failed to generate colonies under single (lxHAT) selection.
Matveeva et al. (1998) has successfully generated hybrids from HM-1 cells and
murine splenocytes using polyethylene glycol (PEG). This PEG protocol (described in
Subsection [2.2.2]) was used to attempt cell hybrid generation using either thymocytes
or splenocytes as somatic fusion partners with HM-1 cells. As Table 3.3 shows hybrids
were derived from both electrofusion and PEG experiments where thymocytes were
used as somatic fusion partners. Electrofusion proved more efficient that PEG exposure
under the conditions used at generating colonies from HM-1 cells and thymocytes:
colony yield is, on average, over 4 greater with electrofusion than with PEG (1083
versus 261).

Table 3.3 Colonies could be generated from thymocytes but not from splenocytes
using either electropulsing or PEG exposure to induce fusion
Electropulsing (Subsection [2.2.1]) or PEG exposure (Subsection [2.2.2]) were used to
fuse HM-1 cells to either thymocytes or splenocytes taken from 6-7 week old
CBA0ctm?o/0ct"'0 mice. After being induced to fuse, cell mixtures were left in full medium
for 24 hours before being placed under single (1 xHAT) selection for 12 days. The table
above shows colony yields for two replicate experiments.
Experiments optimising the generation of cell hybrids from HM-1 cells and
thymocytes (Subsection [3.3.5]) were prioritised over those attempting to generate
hybrids from splenocytes and the reason for failure to generate cell hybrids from
splenocytes was not further investigated. One possible explanation is that splenocytes
did not fuse to HM-1 cells under the conditions used. This could be tested using the 2-
dye FACS analysis similar to that applied in experiments fusing HM-1 cells and
thymocytes (Fig 3.4). Why the splenocytes would not fuse to HM-1 cells when the
protocol used had previously generated hybrids [Matveeva et al. 1998] is unknown.
Another possible explanation is that the splenocytes were dead when fused to HM-1
cells but again why this would be so is unclear given that Matveeva's protocol was
followed. It is suspected that some small technical difference between the protocol
followed here and that carried out by Matveeva et al. is the reason for failure to isolate
colonies from splenocytes fusions.
[3.3.6] Optimisation of hybridisation
Optimisation of the protocols for generating cell hybrids from HM-1 cells and
thymocytes was sought as the colony yield was thought to be low (1 colony per 10-10
cells), even though similar figures were reported by both electrofusion [Tada et al.
(1997)] and PEG mediated fusion [Matveeva et al. (1998)]. If more cell hybrids could
be generated for a given number of cells, fewer cells would be required to carry out
fusion experiments. If less somatic cells were required for hybridisation experiments,
less mice could be sacrificed, but it was principally the need for large numbers of HM-1
cells that was the main limitation to the number of hybridisation experiments carried out.
300 V was found to be the optimal voltage of a range of four for generating
hybrid colonies in either single or double selection plates (Table 3.4).

HM1 x thymocyte fusions were carried out in 0.2cm cuvettes with various voltages. In

resuspended in 400pl mannitol and placed in the appropriate cuvette. Cells were placed
in selection 24hr after fusion and left for 12 days before colonies were counted.
Chamber conductivity is known to affect cell fusion and hybridisation
frequencies [Jaroszeski et al. 1994], The effect of cell conductivity on hybridisation
frequency was investigated. Three conditions known to alter cell conductivity were
altered in three separate experiments. The conditions varied were (i) the gap distance i.e.
the distance between the electrodes of the cuvette (Table 3.5), (ii) the chamber volume
(Table 3.6) and (iii) polarisation of the electro fusion chamber (Fig 3.7).

Table 3.5 Hybrid colony yield is affected by gap distance
HM1 x thymocyte fusions were carried out in cuvettes with various distances between
their electrodes (gap distances). In each fusion experiment, lxlO7 HM-1 cells and 5xl07
CBAOct"e0/Oct"e0 thymocytes were resuspended in 400pl D-mannitol buffer and placed in
the appropriate cuvette. The V/cm ratio was kept constant i.e. single pulses of 150V,
300V, 600V were applied to cuvettes with gap distances of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4cm respectively.
Cells were placed in selection 24hr after fusion and left for 12 days before colonies were
counted.
Table 3.5 showed that hybridisation frequency is affected by gap distance. The
voltage was increased in proportion to the distance between electrodes so that 1500 V /
cm was applied in each case. Fusions using 0.1 cm and 0.2 cm cuvettes produced hybrid
colonies. It was hypothesised that the 0.1 cm cuvette fusion failed to yield as many
colonies as the 0.2 cm cuvette because approximately one third of the cellular
suspension lay above the electrodes in the smaller cuvette. Most of the cells in 0.4 cm
cuvettes lysed after application of 600 V. No colonies were isolated from cells fused in
this cuvette size. The highest colony yield was observed in 0.2 cm cuvettes electropulsed
with 300V.
The effect of chamber volume on hybridisation frequency was then investigated
(Table 3.6). The voltage applied was increased in proportion to the chamber volume.

Table 3.6 Hybrid colony yield is affected by chamber volume
HM1 x thymocyte fusions were carried out in cuvettes with various chamber volumes.
Cellular suspension was added to each cuvette until the meniscus of the cellular
suspension reached the top of the cuvette electrodes. The V / cm ratio was kept constant
for each cuvette. Cells were placed in selection 48hr after fusion and left for 12 days
before colonies were counted.
Colonies were derived from cells in 0.1 cm and 0.2 cm cuvettes. No colonies
were derived from the 0.4 cm cuvette, despite no cell lysis being evident. The highest
colony yield was observed using the 0.2 cm cuvette electropulsed with 300V.
The next experiment investigated the effect of polarising the electrofusion
chamber (Table 3.9). Application of an insulating wax to one electrode of the cuvette
affects the functional area of one electrode and polarises the electrofusion chamber. This
polarisation changes the chamber conductivity, increasing the pulse duration. Elongation
of the pulse has been observed to enhance both survival of electropulsed cells and
hybridisation frequency [Scott-Taylor et al. 2000]. Despite this observation, waxing
failed to increase hybridisation frequency (See Table 3.7). The lack of colonies
generated under HAT selection from the waxed cuvette was not caused by the wax being
toxic to the cells as the waxed control without selection showed no sign of toxicity and
reached confluency at the same time as the unwaxed unselected control.

HM1 x thymocyte fusions were carried out in waxed and unwaxed cuvettes to assess
whether polarisation of the electrofusion chamber increased colony yield. lxlO7 HM-1
cells and 5x107 CBA<)ct"M/<)ct"co thymocytes were fused in waxed and unwaxed 0.2 cm
cuvettes (300V). Cells were placed in selection 48hr after fusion and left for 12 days
before colonies were counted.
In summary, experiments indicated that of all the conditions tested, pulsing HM-1 cells
and thymocytes resuspended in 400p,l, in an unwaxed 0.2cm cuvette, with a voltage of
300V gives the highest hybridisation frequency.
[3.4] Conclusions
Appropriate levels of selection, for isolating cell hybrids generating from fusion
of HM-1 cells and somatic cells, were identified. A puromycin resistant HM-1 clone,
HM-lpur0, was generated so puromycin selection could be used to select against unfused
PEFs in hybridisation experiments.
Electropulsing induced the fusion of HM-1 cells both to themselves (to form
homokaryons) and to thymocytes (to form heterokaryons). Colonies were generated by
pulsing mixtures of HM-1 cells and either thymocytes or primary embryonic fibroblasts
and selecting for hybrids generated from heterokaryons. All colonies generated in
selection displayed a murine ES cell morphology even when cells displaying the somatic
phenotype are viable in the culture conditions (i.e. HM-1 x PEF fusions). This shows
that the ES cell morphology is dominant over the somatic cell morphology in ES x
somatic hybrids.
In addition to pulsing, colonies were also generated by exposing mixed pellets of
HM-1 cells and thymocytes to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Experiments using mixtures
of HM-1 cells and splenocytes failed to generate colonies using either pulsing and PEG
to induce fusion.
Attempts were made to optimise colony generation from fusions of HM-1 cells
and thymocytes. Colony yield was affected by gap distance (the distance between the
cuvette electrodes) and not found to be directionally proportional to chamber volume of
the cuvette. Polarisation of the chamber by applying a thin layer of wax to one electrode
did not increase colony yield. Of all the conditions tested, application of a single pulse
(300 V, 25 p,F) to cells resuspended in 400 (il D-mannitol buffer in a 0.2 cm cuvette
gave the highest colony yields.
[4] Characterisation ofmurine hybrid cells
[4.1] Introduction
In Chapter [3] colonies of cells were recovered from mixtures of ES cells
and somatic cells that had been fused and placed under culture conditions that
selected for reprogramming of somatic cells to an ES phenotype. Colonies were
picked and expanded and this chapter describes the characterisation of three lines:
TESH1 (generated from HM-1 cells and CBA0ct"eo/0ct'"?0 thymocytes via
electrofusion); TESH2 (also generated from HM-1 cells and cba0^070^0
thymocytes but via exposure to PEG); and FESH1 (generated from HM-1 and
CBAct"<?o/0ct"<'0 primary embryonic fibroblasts via electrofusion).
These lines were studied to see whether reprogramming of the somatic
nucleus had taken place. If reprogramming of the somatic nucleus had truly occurred,
one would expect the patterns of gene expression to change so that cell type specific
genes active in the thymocyte would be silenced and genes associated with ES cell
phenotype would be activated. Additionally, reprogrammed nuclei would behave
functionally as ES cells (i.e. they could direct the formation of embryoid bodies and
display pluripotency both in vivo and in vitro). Thymocytes and fibroblasts are
differentiated cells and if cell hybrids derived from these cells displayed pluripotency
this would show that nuclear reprogramming had taken place.
[4.2] Objective
To investigate whether clones (TESH-1, TESH-2 and FESH-1) were phenotypic
ES cell hybrids and whether reprogramming of the somatic nuclei had taken
place.
[4.3] Results and discussion
[4.3.1] Clonal lines are cell hybrids displaying sub-tetraploid chromosome
number
Mitotic spreads were made from TESH-1, TESH-2, and FESH-1 clones at
passage number 7. Fifty representative spreads were counted for each cell line. All
spreads displayed tetraploid or near tetraploid chromosomal numbers verifying that
TESH-1, TESH-2, and FESH-1 were all cell hybrid lines. Representative mitotic
spreads of TESH-1 (showing complete tetraploidy at passage 7) and HM-1 cells
(showing a diploid chromosome number) are shown in Fig 4.1 Panel A. The modal
chromosomal number for both TESH-1 and FESH-1 was 80 at passage 7, whereas it
was 76 for TESH-2. TESH-2 was generated using PEG, and unlike the electrofusion
derived lines, it displayed a constant and noticeable degree of cell death during
culture.
The effect of passage number on cell hybrid genotype was investigated. Two
of the cell hybrid lines, TESH-1 and TESH-2, were cultured beyond passage number
7 and mitotic spreads were made from them at passage numbers 12 and 17. Fig 4.1
Panel B shows that the two lines tested lost chromosomes during culture. It was
observed that the modal chromosomal number of TESH-2 cells decreased more
rapidly than that of TESH-1 cells at the same passage number (P<0.05 as calculated
using Student's unpaired t-test [Caria 2000]). A possible explanation for this is that
TESH-2 cells needed to undergo more cell divisions than TESH-1 cells before
approaching confluence as they display a low level of spontaneous cell death. Cells
were only passaged when approaching confluence, thus viable TESH-2 cells will
have divided more times than TESH-1 cells of equivalent passage number.
The literature describing fusion of ES cells and somatic cells also suggests
that PEG-fused cell hybrids lose chromosomes more quickly with respect to passage
number when cultured in HAT selective medium. Tada et al. 2001 electrofused
murine ES cells with murine thymocytes and reported a full tetraploid complement in
all 10 mitotic spreads (passage 7). Matveeva et al. (1998) however reported hybrid
clones derived from PEG fusion of HM-1 with splenocytes as having as few as 41-43
chromosomes at passage 12. It would be interesting, but beyond the remit of this
work, to investigate whether genomic stability of cell hybrids is affected by the
fusagen used. No explanation could be given for how PEG might affect genomic
stability of cells.

1 and FESH-1 was 80, whereas for TESH-2, it was 76. Panel B As TESH-1 () and
TESH-2 () cells are passaged, the modal chromosome number of the spreads,
decreases. Mitotic spreads of hybrid clones TESH-1 and TESH-2 were generated at
higher passage numbers (12 and 17). Cells were continuously grown in lxHAT
selective medium. The modal chromosome number was calculated from 50 good
spreads for each passage.
Before phenotypic characterisation of the hybrid lines was undertaken, the
formal possibility that hybrids were generated from ES cells fusing with an
undifferentiated stem cell population present in the thymus was addressed. If adult
thymocytes had been fused with HM-1 cells, one could confirm this by assaying for
DNA rearrangement. DNA rearrangement is one of the clear signs that thymocytes
have differentiated into lymphoid cells [Fowlkes & Pardoll 1989]. Hochedlinger &
Jaenisch (2002) used T-cell receptor gene rearrangement to verify that nuclear
transfer experiments had used donor nuclei from differentiated cells.

cells as described in Subsection [2.6.3]. The PCR amplification products were
loaded on an agarose gel and visualised with ethidium bromide. Panel A Schematic

DNA rearrangement of the Tcry gene occurs in thymocytes and TESH-1 cells but not

DNA used in each PCR reaction were similar.
A PCR experiment was performed using primer sets specific to the V-J
region of Tcry [Fig 4.2], Rearrangement of the V-J region of Tcry was found in
TESH-1 cells. Thus, this line was derived from HM-1 cells fusing with adult
thymocytes and not with an endogenous stem cell. Tada et al. (2001) had previously
investigated T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in ES phenotypic cell hybrid lines
generated from ES cells. Out of 31 hybrids clones analysed, 17 carried at least one
rearrangement of the following genes: Tcry, Tcrfi, IgH, and TcrS. Rearrangement in
the Tcra gene was not assessed.
[4.3.2] A somatically derived transgenic Oct-4 promoter is silent in thymocytes
but is reactivated after fusion with HM-1 cells
Whether reprogramming of the somatic chromatin had taken place within the
hybrid cells was now investigated. As discussed in detail in Section [1.6], Oct-4 is a
transcription factor expressed in all pluripotent cell types of the mouse. When the
activity of the Oct-4 promoter decreases within a pluripotent cell, the cell
differentiates. The activity of the somatically derived Oct-4 promoter was assayed in
thymocytes and TESH-1 cells to see if there is epigenetic reprogramming at this
locus.
TESH-1, TESH-2 and FESH-1 lines were all derived from fusions of HM-1
cells with somatic cells derived from CBA<:)ct"e0/Oct"eo mice. Total RNA was isolated
intact from 4 cell types: CBA0ct"eo/ct"eo ES cells, HM-1 cells, CBA0ct"eo/0ct"eo
thymocytes and TESH-1 cells (Fig 4.3 Panel A). cDNA was made from these RNA
samples and their integrity was verified by RT-PCR with (3-actin primers (Fig 4.3
Panel B). A series of RT-PCR reactions using neo specific markers was then
performed using the same cDNA. No neo expression was seen in controls lacking
reverse transcriptase showing that genomic DNA contamination of the cDNA had
not taken place, neo expression was detected in the positive control (gg001"1^01^0
cells) where the Oct-4 promoter was actively driving neo expression, neo was not
expressed in unfused thymocytes showing that the Oct-4 promoter is inactive in this
terminally differentiated cell type. No neo expression was observed in HM-1 cells
either (here the Oct-4 promoter is active but the neo coding sequence is absent).
Finally neo was expressed in TESH-1 hybrid cells. Together these data show that the
somatic derived Oct-4 promoter was inactive in unfused thymocytes but reactivated
following hybridisation with HM-1 cells. This confirms that epigenetic
reprogramming of the somatic Oct-4 locus has occurred as a result of cell fusion.

promoter occurred in TESH-1 which had been selected using G418 but also in other
hybrid clones where G418 had not been used (data not shown).
[4.3.3] Cell hybrid lines display high alkaline phosphatase activity
Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase activity is high in the ICM of
preimplantation embryos [Johnson et al. (1977)] and in murine primordial germ cells
[Matsui et al. 1992]. Consequently, it is a commonly used biochemical marker for
undifferentiated pluripotent cells like ES and EC cells. Activity of this enzyme was
assessed in hybrid cells to better define the ES cell-like phenotype of the hybrid
clones. Figure 4.4 shows that cell hybrid lines TESH-1, TESH-2 and FESH-1, as
well as the HM-1 control, all displayed high endogenous alkaline phosphatase
activity. Unfused thymocytes showed no alkaline phosphastase activity and unfused
PEFs showed a small portion of cells that displayed comparatively weak alkaline
phosphate activity. The PEFs are isolated by a crude method ofmashing up embryos
(Subsection [2.1.1.2]) and consequently there is a mixture of cell types present. The
morphology and relatively weak level of alkaline phosphatase activity of these PEF-
associated cells suggest that they are somatic cells and not undifferentiated cells.
Similar to the data described here, Matveeva et al. (1998) showed high alkaline
phosphatase activity in cell hybrids generated from HM-1 cells and murine
splenocytes.
Fig 4.4 Cell hybrid lines displayed alkaline phophatase activity
Subconfluent cultures of cells were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity as
described in Subsection [2.4.1]. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells are
characterised by high levels of alkaline phosphatase expression which is down-
regulated following stem cell differentiation. Panel A Alkaline phosphatase staining
for HM-1 cells, PEFs and thymocytes. PaneI B Three cell hybrid lines generated
from fusions of these cell types. All cells in the HM-1 control, TESH-1, TESH-2 and
FESH-1 wells stained positive for alkaline phosphatase activity. A small proportion
of cells in the PEF well displayed comparatively weak staining.
[4.3.4] Cell hybrid lines display cell surface marker expression profiles similar
to HM-1 cells
Next, the expression of cell surface markers by the cell hybrids was
investigated. Cells were immunostained for SSEA-1 (a cell surface marker for
undifferentiated murine cell types), SSEA-4 (a cell surface marker for primative
endoderm) and CD90 (a thymocyte-specific cell surface marker, this is also called
Thy-1). Fig 4.5 shows histograms compiled after the cells were FACS analysed for
expression of these three markers. The HM-1 control was SSEA-1 positive and did
not express either SSEA-4 or CD90. In contrast, the thymocyte control expressed
both SSEA-4 and CD90 but not SSEA-1. Hybrid clones TESH-1, TESH-2 and
FESH-1 all displayed a marker expression profile similar to that of the HM-1 cells.
Again similar to these data, Matveeva et al. 1998 reported hybrid cell
expression of the undifferentiated cell marker ECMA-7 and suppression of the
differentiated cell marker TROMA-1 in their hybrid lines. Andrews & Goodfellow
(1980) generated cell hybrids from murine EC (PCC4azaR) cells and thymocytes and
also found the expression of SSEA-1 and the extinction of CD90. They also reported
continued expression of another embryonic antigen (3C4-10) and the suppression of
expression of another thymocyte antigen (Ly-2) in the hybrid cells. Not all EC
markers were expressed and thymocyte specific markers suppressed in these hybrid
cells however {i.e. the PCC4azaR specific marker, H-2Db, was not expressed in the
while the thymocyte specific marker, H-2Kk, still was).

[4.3.5] Hybrid cells generate tumours in SCID mice that contain cells
representing all three embryonic germ layers
As highlighted in Section [1.6], one of the hallmarks of ES cells is that they
generate tumours which comprise all three embryonic germ layers (endoderm,
mesoderm and ectoderm) when injected into immunodeficient mice. To investigate
tumourigenicity and developmental competence, 2xl07 HM-1 cells or hybrid cells
respectively were injected into adult severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
(strain C.B-17/Icr) as described in Subsection [2.4.4]. The two HM-1 controls and
the three hybrid lines all generated tumours within 3 weeks of cell injection. The
hybrid lines took longer to produce tumours than the HM-1 controls (19 days as
opposed to 14). This may be due to the longer doubling time of hybrid cells in vivo
which was also observed in culture. TESH-2 produced the smallest tumour. It is
suspected that this is due to a low level of spontaneous cell death in vivo that had
previously observed in vitro.
All five tumours were then fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned as
described in Subsection [2.4.4], H&E staining of both control and cell hybrid
derived sections was carried out (see Subsection [2.4.4]) and this provided
histological evidence that tumours contained cells representing the ectoderm and
mesoderm (Fig 4.7 Panels B,C,D & E). Visual examination of tumour sections
failed to provide unequivocal histological evidence for endoderm. Consequently
unstained sections were dewaxed, rehydrated (See Subsection [2.4.4] for details) and
immunostained for ezrin as described in Subsection [2.4.3]. Ezrin is a marker of
endodermal cells [Abelev 1971][Bretscher 1986]. Immunostained sections of all the
HM-1 and hybrid line derived tumours showed ezrin-positive epithelium (Fig 4.7
Panel A), providing evidence that tumours also contained cells representing the
endoderm. Thus hybrid cells are capable of generating cells of all three embryonic
germ layers in vivo and display an equivalent developmental potential to HM-1 cells.
Fig 4.6 Hybrid cells and HM-1 cells generate benign tumours when injected into
SCID mice
2xl07 cell aliquots of HM-1 cells (Passage #21) and the three cell hybrid lines
(Passage #6) were injected into adult SCID mice strain C.B-17/Icr as described in
Subsection [2.4.4], Two SCID mice each injected with 2xl07 HM-1 cells generated
detectable tumours after 14 days: the excised tumours (i) and (ii) weighed 0.97g and
1.12g. Three SCID mice injected with cell hybrid lines all generated tumours 19 days
post injection. Tumours (iii), (iv) and (v) were derived from mice each injected with
2xl07 TESH-1, TESH-2, and FESH-1 cells respectively. Excised tumours weighed
0.92g, 0.87g, and 1.21 g in that order. Scale bar in each figure represents 5mm.

[4.3.6] Hybrid cells can be differentiated in vitro into cells representing all three
embryonic germ layers
Finally, the ability of hybrid lines to differentiate in vitro was investigated
[Fig 4.8]. HM-1 cells and cells from all three cell hybrid lines generated embryoid
bodies after being grown in suspension in LIF free 'murine embryoid body' medium
for one week. Fig 4.8 Panel A shows representative images of one-week-old HM-1
and FESH-1 derived embryoid bodies. Approximately thirty one-week-old embryoid
bodies were disaggregated with TEG and total RNA was isolated from these cells as
described in Section [2.6.1], cDNA from HM-1 cells and all three hybrid lines was
generated. This was used in a series of RT-PCR reactions to detect whether the
endodermal marker a-fetoprotein was expressed (See Subsection [2.6.3] for PCR
conditions). Fig 4.8 Panel B Lane 1 showed the 'no reverse transcriptase' control
that confirmed that cDNA has not been contaminated with genomic DNA. Lane 2
showed that a-fetoprotein was not expressed in undifferentiated HM-1 cells but lanes
3-6 showed that it was in 1 week old embryoid bodies derived from HM-1 cells and
the three hybrid cell lines. These data verify that both HM-1 cells and the hybrid
lines can be differentiated into endodermal cells in vitro.
One-week-old embryoid bodies derived from all four lines (HM-1, TESH-1,
TESH-2, and FESH-1) were also grown in either murine cardiomyogenesis or
neurogenesis differentiation media as described in Subsection [2.4.2]. In
cardiomyogenic medium, beating clumps of cells were found in HM-1 cell cultures
after 9 days and in all three hybrid cell derived cultures after 10 days. After 14 days
in cardiomyogenesis differentiation medium, the cultures were immunostained for
troponin T (cardiac isoform) and all cultures displayed positive staining. Fig 4.8
Panel C shows representative images of Troponin T staining of HM-1 and FESH-1
derived cultures. These data verify that all four lines can be differentiated into
cardiomyocytes, a mesodermal cell type.
In a similar fashion, cultures fed neurogenesis differentiation medium for 14
days were immunostained for (3-tubulin III, a neuronal cell marker. Cultures of all
four lines displayed the marker and positively staining cells displayed long
cylindrical outgrowths consistent with the morphology of neuronal tissue. Fig 4.8
Panel D shows representative images showing P-tubulin III expression in cultures
derived from HM-1 cells and FESH-1 cells. This verifies that the cell hybrid lines
and ES cells can be differentiated down the neurogenic pathway and give rise to
ectodermal cells. In summary, the data described in this section shows that cell
hybrid lines can be differentiated in vitro into cells comprising all three embryonic
lineages and these lines possess a similar potential to HM-1 cell controls.

[4.4] Conclusions
The three clonal lines (TESH-1, TESH-2, and FESH-1) displayed sub-
tetraploid complements of chromosomes confirming that they were cell hybrids. Cell
hybrid lines TESH-1 and FESH-1 were found to be genomically stable whereas
TESH-2 (generated using PEG) lost more chromosomes the longer they were
cultured. TESH-1 displayed DNA rearrangement of Tcry verifying that this cell
hybrid line was the result of a fusion between an ES cell and an adult thymocyte and
not an endogenous stem cell.
All three hybrid lines displayed an ES phenotype. In TESH-1 cells the
somatically derived Oct-4 promoter is reactivated, showing epignetic reprogramming
had occurred at this locus. All three cell hybrid clones displayed strong alkaline
phosphatase activity. They also expressed the undifferentiated cell surface marker
SSEA-1 but not either the differentiated cell surface marker SSEA-4 or the
thymocyte specific marker CD90.
When injected into SCID mice, all three cell hybrid lines formed tumours that
contained cells from all three embryonic germ layers. In addition, in vitro
differentiation of the three cell hybrid lines produced embryoid bodies from which
cells representing the three embryonic germ layers could be derived. These two
observations show that ES cell derived genome can retain pluripotency even when it
is in contact with the differentiated cell genome.
In summary, data in this chapter show that hybrid and HM-1 cells display
similar phenotypic characteristics. These data indicate that ES cell phenotype is
dominant over somatic cell phenotype in hybrid cells. This is consistent with the
findings of others [Tada et al. 2001][Matveeva et al. 1998],
[5] The effect of heat shock on the murine cell hybrid
system
[5.1] Introduction
Cells transiently placed in an environment several degrees above
physiological optimum display a heat shock response [See Section [1.9] for a
detailed review of the heat shock response]. Heat shocked cells can show profound
changes in gene expression [Csermely et al. 1994] and chromatin structural changes
[Iliakis & Pantelias 1989],
It was hypothesised that inducing such a response in murine thymocytes
would alter somatic chromatin structure affecting the amenability of somatic nuclei
to being reprogrammed when fused with an ES cell. This hypothesis would be tested
by investigating the effect of heat shocking thymocytes in the murine cell hybrid
system.
[5.2] Objective
To investigate the effect of heat shock on nuclear reprogramming in the murine cell
hybrid system.
[5.3] Results and discussion
[5.3.1] Thymocytes are heat shocked when incubated at 42C for 10 minutes
In order to investigate the effect of heat shock on nuclear reprogramming,
conditions in which the heat shock response could be reliably induced in murine
thymocytes were sought. Wells (1983) had shown that optimal heat shock conditions
for deriving ES cell lines from mouse blastocysts was 42C for 10 minutes prior to
ICM extraction. As reprogramming the somatic nucleus to an ES cell-like state is the
goal of hybridisation experiments, it was thought that these conditions would be
suitable for heat shocking murine thymocytes. In order to verify that incubation of
cells at 42C for 10 minutes induced a heat shock response in murine thymocytes,
whole cell lysates of thymocytes were generated and probed for inducible heat shock
protein hsp72. "Treated" lysate had been derived from thymocytes that had been
incubated at 42C for 10 minutes, whereas "control" lysate was generated from
thymocytes that had not been exposed to such hyperthermic conditions. Hsp72 was
assayed as it is a good marker for the heat shock response: it is not expressed in
normal unstressed mammalian cells but is quickly induced to high levels following
stresses such as heat shock [Welch & Suhan (1986)]. Fig 5.1 (overleaf) shows a
Western blot that verifies that murine thymocytes are heat shocked under the
conditions used. Control lysate contained only a low level of hsp72 induction
whereas in treated lysate a significantly higher level of Hsp72 was observed (at least
a three fold induction over the control level).
During lysate generation, thymocytes were disaggregated mechanically and
then with TEG, before either being exposed to hyperthermia (treated lysate) or left at
room temperature (control lysate). Subsequently the cells were incubated in lxPBS
at 37C for 2 hours prior to lysis, denaturation and fixation [See Subsection [2.8.1]
for details]. It is thought that the low level of Hsp72 observed in the control lane was
due to the stress that disaggregation and incubation in a serum-free environment
caused the cells.
Mosser et al. 1993 had previously shown the induction of a heat shock
response in adult mouse thymocytes by incubating the cells at 42C for 20 minutes. It
was reported that hsp68 levels rose rapidly after such hyperthermic exposure but
decreased after 1 hour. The heat shock response was induced in mouse thymocytes in
subsequent experiments by incubating the cells at 42C for 10 min.

In order to test the hypothesis that heat shocking thymocytes prior to fusion
with ES cells would make them more amenable to being reprogrammed, control and
heat shocked thymocytes were used in parallel hybridisation experiments. HM-1
cells were electropulsed in the presence of either control or heat shocked thymocytes
in a ratio of 1:5 under standard electrofusion conditions. One fifth of the
electropulsed cells were used to assess heterokaryon formation and cell viability [See
Figs 5.4 & 5.5]; the remainder was placed under selection for cell hybrids (lxHAT).
Table 5.1 shows the hybrid colony number from experiments using both control and
heat shocked thymocytes. In each case, more hybrid colonies were counted on plates
where heat shocked thymocytes has been used. Fig 5.2 shows that, on average,
84.616.9% more hybrid colonies were derived using heat shocked rather than
control thymocytes. When statistically analysed, using the Student's paired t-test
[Caria 2002], heat shocking thymocytes is found to significantly affect hybrid colony
yield (P<0.0026 for the corrected data).

[5.3.3] Heat shocking thymocytes does not affect cell viability of electropulsed
mixtures of cells but does increase heterokaryon formation
Hybrid colony yield on its own is not a good measure of nuclear
reprogramming. Such a yield may be affected by other factors (i.e. cell fusion, or
more precisely heterokaryon formation, and also cell viability). In order to
investigate the effect of heat shock on nuclear reprogramming, both of these
parameters were measured. Fig 5.3 shows that the heat shock of thymocytes did not
affect the viability of electropulsed cells as measured between 6 and 13 hours after
seeding (,P>0.05 as calculated using a Student's paired t-test (1 tailed) [Caria 2000]).
In control and heat shocked samples respectively, only 10.61.2% and 10.11% of
electropulsed cells remained viable. This was consistent with the observation that
most of the cells in electropulsed ES cell/thymocyte mixtures died: The low levels of
cell viability were expected as thymocytes are not viable under murine ES cell
culture conditions.
Fig 5.4 shows 2-dye FACS analysis data from which the percentage of cells
forming heterokaryons was calculated [See Subsection [2.2.5] for details]. Fig 5.5
shows heterokaryon formation (as percentage of viable cells) for control or heat
shocked fusions. In all replicates, heat shocked fusions showed an increase in
heterokaryon formation over control levels. Statistical analysis showed heat shocking
thymocytes prior to fusion to have a significant effect on heterokaryon formation
(P<0.05 as calculated by the Student's paired t-test (2 tailed) [Caria 2000]). On
average, fusions with heat shocked thymocytes displayed 395% more heterokaryon
formation than that measured in control fusions. This increase in heterokaryon
formation was unexpected. Despite an extensive review of the literature, no reports
of exposing cells to a hyperthermic state prior to fusion induction were found. It was
speculated that heat shocking thymocytes destabilised cell membranes making them
more fusogenic. There is data showing that increased fusion of liposomes to cultured
cells when the liposomes had previously been exposed to hyperthermia (41.5C, 2hr)
[Arancia et al. 1994]. The outer bilayer of multilamellar liposomes fused more
readily to cell membrane under these hyperthermic conditions and induced changes
in the fluidity and molecular organisation of the plasma membrane. In a similar
way, heat shocked thymocytes might experience membrane disruption that affects
their ability to fuse. It was noted that even in the leakage controls, a higher
percentage of cells were double stained, indicating that thymocytes remained in this
fusagenic state for some time after heat shock.

[5.3.4] Heat shocking thymocytes prior to fusion does not affect hybridisation
frequencies
When hybridisation frequencies were calculated, the mean frequency was
higher in heat shocked fusions than that found in controls, however this difference
was not found to be significant [Fig 5.6] (P>0.05, as calculated by the Student's
paired t-test (2 tailed) [Caria 2000], It is possible that reprogramming to an ES cell
state was facilitated by heat shocking but such an increase could not be detected with
only five replicate experiments. Consultation with a statistician revealed that >100
replicate experiments would be required to identify whether enhanced nuclear
reprogramming, in addition to increased heterokaryon formation, caused the
observed increase in hybrid colony yield.

yields is shown. There was no significant difference between control and heat
shocked experiments (P>0.05 as calculated using the Student's paired t-test (2 tailed)
[Caria 2000])
[5.3.5] Heat shocking cells after fusion did not increase hybridisation frequency
It was decided to investigate the effect of heat shocking cell mixtures after
they were electropulsed to induce fusion. It was reasoned that such treatment might
still facilitate nuclear reprogramming of the somatic nucleus. This approach would
also avoid the problem of discriminating between increased heterokaryon formation
and nuclear reprogramming as the cause of increased hybrid yield. However this
approach would mean that the ES cell derived part of hybrids would also be exposed
to hyperthermic conditions. Fig 5.7 shows that heat shocking cells after electrofusion
did not increase hybridisation frequencies. Only two experiments were carried out
and thus too little data were generated to apply statistical analysis. However in both
experiments, there was no indication that heat shocking after electrofusion facilitated
nuclear reprogramming.
On the contrary, heat shocking thymocytes after electrofusion only caused a
decrease in hybrid colony yield. One explanation for this is that unlike previous
experiments, the ES cell derived moiety of heterokaryons / hybrids is being heat
shocked in addition to the thymocyte derived moiety. Perhaps the reprogramming
factors in the HM-1 cell are sensitive to heat shock. Applying this hypothesis one
would expect that longer the duration between electrofusion and heat shock, the
longer the reprogramming factors will be active before being exposed to heat shock
and the more hybrids will have been reprogrammed. Thus as the duration between
electropulsing and heat shock gets longer, the greater the hybrid colony yield. This is
consistent with the data in Fig 5.7 and could be tested by heat shocking HM-1 cells
prior to electrofusion to somatic cells and investigating whether there is a change in
hybrid colony yield. If reprogramming factors are sensitive to heat shock, one would
expect a decrease in hybrid colony yield when heat shocked HM-1 cells are used.
Another explanation for the data is that heat shock just interrupts the reprogramming
process, without affecting the reprogramming factors per se. If this is the case one
might expect the hybrid yield of heat shocked HM-1 cells to be similar to control
HM-1 cells when both are electropulsed with the same numbers of thymocytes.

heterokaryon formation were measured 14 hr after fusion). Aliquots were seeded on

heat shock was >lmin. Two separate experiments were carried out with different
durations between electrofusion and heat shock. Samples from the first experiment

[5.4] Conclusion
Heat shock can be induced in thymocytes by incubating them at 42C for 10
minutes. Heat shocked thymocytes showed at least a stronger induction of hsp72 that
seen in control thymocytes. Heat shocking thymocytes prior to pulsing increased
both hybrid colony yield (P<0.05) and heterokaryon formation (P<0.05). With five
replicate experiments, the increase in heterokaryon formation made it impossible to
determine whether the frequency of nuclear reprogramming had changed. With the
data acquired, there was no significance difference between the hybridisation
frequencies of control and heat shocked samples (P>0.05).
Heat shocking cells at various time points after pulsing decreased the hybrid
colony yield. In the experiments where heat shock was applied between 1 min and 12
hours after electrofusion, the longer the duration between electropulsing and heat
shock, the higher the hybrid colony yield. This could be due to ES cell derived
nuclear reprogramming factors being sensitive to heat shock or perhaps a non
specific effect that does not directly affect nuclear reprogramming activity within the
cell. These hypotheses could be tested by heat shocking HM-1 cells prior to
electropulsing and investigating whether there is an effect on hybrid colony yield.
[6] The effects of ES cell confluence and passage number on
the murine cell hybrid system
[6.1] Introduction
Gao et al. (2003) observed that confluence of HM-1 cells affected their ability to
be completely reprogrammed to totipotency in nuclear transfer experiments. When
nuclei from HM-1 cells at 80-90% confluence were transferred into ooplasts and
reprogrammed by oocyte cytoplasm, 49.0% of the reconstructed embryos developed to
morula/blastocyst stage and 9.1% of these went on to develop into adult animals. When
nuclei from HM-1 cells at 60-70% confluence were used however, only 22.2% of the
embryos developed to the morula / blastocyst stage of which 2.3% went on to adulthood.
The first aim of work discussed in this chapter was to investigate if reprogramming of
somatic cells by ES cells was affected by ES cell confluence. At the time this work was
carried out, cell hybrids could not be repeatedly produced from fusions of ES cells and
PEFs, so investigating the effect of somatic cell confluence on their ability to be
reprogrammed could not be investigated.
The term "confluence" describes the relationship between adherent cells and the
surface area of the substratum to which they are attached, "percentage confluence" refers
to the percentage of surface area of the flask that is covered by cells e.g. a 50% confluent
culture is one in which half the surface area of the flask is covered with cells. The term
"superconfluent" will be used throughout this chapter to describe cultures kept growing
24 hours after the entire flask surface has been covered with cells.
The biological consequences of confluence are cell-type dependent [McAteer &
Douglas 1979], As cells grow to confluence in culture for example, most somatic cell
types enter into a quiescent state where they cease proliferating. In contrast, ES cells
continue to proliferate and begin to differentiate. There is no evidence that ES cells ever
become quiescent.
If ES cell confluence was found to affect nuclear reprogramming, the optimal
degree of confluence for nuclear reprogramming would then be sought and used in
subsequent experiments. Additionally, differences between ES cells at different ranges
of confluence would also be sought with the aim of elucidating further what aspect of
confluence affects nuclear reprogramming.
The second aim of work done in this chapter was to investigate the effect of ES
cell passage number on nuclear reprogramming in the hybrid system. In nuclear transfer
experiments reported by Gao et al. (2003) the developmental potential of reconstituted
embryos was affected by passage number of the donor ES cells. When R1 ES cells of
passage 19 were used as nuclear donors, 47.2% of the reconstructed embryos reached
morula/blastocyst stage and of these 1.69% went on to generate live offspring. With R1
ES cells of passage 22-25 were used, however only 27% of the embryos reached
blastocyst/morula stage and no live offspring were produced. It was hypothesised that
ES cell passage number would also affect the ES cells' capacity to reprogram somatic
nuclei in the cell hybrid system.
[6.2] Objectives

To investigate the effect of passage number of murine ES cells on the murine cell hybrid
system.
[6.3] Results and discussion
[6.3.1] HM-1 cell seeding densities, that yield cultures at different
ranges of confluence, were identified empirically
Seeding densities, to generate HM-1 cell cultures at various ranges of
confluence, were identified empirically. The densities shown in Fig 6.1 Panel A are
those which reproducibly yielded ES cell cultures at 50-60%, 70-80%, 90-100% and
>100% confluence 48 hours after seeding. Images of respresentative ES cell cultures at
each range of confluence are shown in Fig 6.1 Panel B. In order to test the hypothesis
that confluence of ES cells affected their capacity to reprogram somatic nuclei,
experiments fusing ES cells, grown to four different ranges of confluence, to murine
thymocytes were undertaken. Standard cell numbers and electrofusion conditions for
HM-1/thymocyte fusions were used (See Subsection [2.2.1]) and reprogrammed hybrids
were selected in the usual manner (murine ES medium supplemented with lxHAT).
[6.3.2] HM-1 cell confluence affects hybrid colony yield
HM-1 cells at different levels of confluence were fused to CBA thymocytes
using standard electrofusion cell numbers and conditions. Fig 6.1 Panel C and Fig 6.2
show that hybrid colony yields were affected by HM-1 cell confluence (P<0.05 as
calculated using 2-way Analysis of Variance [Caria 2000]). In all five replicate
experiments the same trend is seen: the hybrid colony yield increased as ES cell
confluence is increased until the cells reach 100% confluence. 41151% more hybrid
colonies were generated using HM-1 cells at 90-100% confluence than were generated
in equivalent fusions using HM-1 cells at 50-60% confluence. After the HM-1 cells have
reached 100% confluence however, the colony yield quickly declined to below that
observed with 50-60% confluent HM-1 cells. The probable explanation for this decrease
in hybrid colony yield is that in fusions using > 100% confluent HM-1 cells, a significant
portion of ES cells have already started to differentiate and were no longer able to
reprogram the somatic Oct4 locus. Indeed, as shown in Fig 6.1 Panel C, differentiation
of some HM-1 cells was routinely observed in >100% confluent cultures (i.e. small
clusters of cells had lost ES cell morphology and had begun differentiating).

[6.3.3] HM-1 cell confluence does not affect viable heterokaryon
formation or cell viability
In order to investigate the effect of HM-1 cell confluence on nuclear
reprogramming, viable heterokaryon formation and cell viability had to be measured
for each experiment in addition to calculating the hybrid colony yields. These
measurements were made using FACS analysis as described in Subsection [2.2.6] and
Section [13.3].
Fig 6.3 shows data from 2-dye FACS analysis experiments from which
percentages of cells forming viable heterokaryons was calculated. Fig 6.3 Panel C
shows a table where calculated percentage of cells forming viable heterokaryons in five
representative experiments are summarised. Fig 6.4 Panel A shows a graph of these
data for individual experiments while Panel B shows the mean percentage values.
These data show that HM-1 cell confluence did not affect viable heterokaryon
formation as a percentage of all cells (F>0.05 as calculated using 2-way Analysis of
Variance [Caria 2000]).

Using hybrid colony yields, heterokaryon formation and cell viability data detailed in
Subsections [6.3.2] and [6.3.3], hybridisation frequencies were calculated as described
in Subsection [2.7.5J. Fig. 6.6 shows mean hybridisation frequencies for each HM-1 cell
confluence range from five replicate experiments. These yields are affected by HM-1
cell confluence (/>=().014 when P is calculated using 2-way Analysis of Variance [Caria
2000]) highlighting that confluence of ES cells affects the reprogramming of thymocyte
nuclei in the hybrid system.

data were used to calculate hybridization frequencies (hybrid / heterokaryon) as
described in Section [2.7.5]. The mean and standard error of the mean of these
frequencies is shown in the graph above.
[6.3.5] 90-100% confluent ES cells display the greatest capacity to
reprogram thymocytes
Fusions using 90-100% confluent HM-1 cells showed the highest hybridisation
frequencies (hybrid per heterokaryon) highlighting that this ES cell confluence has the
greatest capacity to reprogram thymocyte nuclei. Fortunately, due to the large number of
cells needed for each fusion, HM-1 cells had been consistently grown to this confluence
in all experiments previously described in this thesis.
[6.3.6] Confluence of HM-1 cells affect their cell cycle characteristics
Campbell et al. 1996 stated that cell cycle stages of both recipient cytoplast and
donor nucleus affected complete reprogramming in nuclear transfer experiments [More
in Subsection [1.8.1]]. The cell cycle profiles of the HM-1 cell populations were
assessed to see if there was any correlation between cell cycle stage and the increase in
nuclear reprogramming in cell hybrids. HM-1 cell populations at different ranges of
confluence were stained with propidium iodide [Krisan 1975] and FACS analysed [See
Section [1.3] for details]. The resultant spectra are shown overlaid in Fig 6.7 PanelA.
ES cells proliferate quickly and have short G1 and G2 phases [Savatier et al. 2000]. To
ensure accurate differentiation between the various cell cycle stages, a subconfluent
cycling population of PEFs was used as a control for positioning the stage gates [Fig 6.7
Panel B], Fig 6.7 Panel C highlights the relationship between the gates Ml, M2 and M3
and the phases of the cell cycle.

Fig 6.8 HM-1 cell confluence affects the mean percentage of HM-1 cells lying within

PI fluorescence spectra shown in Fig 6.7 were divided into gates corresponding to Gl, S,
and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The percentage of events within each gate showed
the cell cycle characteristics of the HM-1 cell populations. Panel A Mean percentage of
HM-1 cells in Gl phase at four different ranges of confluence (S.E.M). Panel B Mean
percentage of HM-1 cells in S phase at four different ranges of confluence (S.E.M).
Panel C Mean percentage of HM-1 cells in G2/M phases at four different ranges of
confluence (S.E.M).
The cell cycle profiles of HM-1 cell populations were affected by confluence [Fig 6.7].
As Table 6.1 shows the proportion of cells in each gate changed with HM-1 cell
confluence range in each of three replicate experiments. Fig 6.8 shows the mean
percentages lying within each gate as calculated from the five replicates. Percentage of
HM-1 cells at each stage of the cell cycle was affected by confluence (P<0.05 in each
case as calculated using 2-way Analysis of Variance [Caria 2000]). The percentage of
events in G2/M increased from 18.4 to 41.1% as cells approached 100% confluence
while the percentage of cells in G1 decreased from 32.8% to 11.9%. The proportion of
cells in S phase did not change significantly (P>0.05) as 100% confluence was
approached. Zhou et al. 2001 had previously carried out similar analysis on a
subconfluent murine ES (Rl) cell population. They reported that 18% of the cells were
in G1 phase, 64% were in S phase and 18% were in G2/M phase. While the proportion
of cells in G2/M phase was similar to the 50-60% confluent HM-1 population observed
here (18% versus 17.20.7%), more cells were in G1 phase (18% as opposed to
32.83.8%) and less in S phase (64% compared to 48.84.1%). Fewer cells in S phase
may suggest the HM-1 cells are growing more slowly than Rl cells however Rl and
HM-1 cells do not have a significantly different doubling time (11.4 hr versus 11-13 hr)
when grown in similar culture conditions [Udy et al. 1997]. This suggests inherent
differences between the cell lines might not be the reason for differences in the
proportion of cells in S phase. A possible explanation for the differences in cell cycle
profile is the different culture regimes used to grow the cells (Rl cells were grown on
inactivated feeders whereas HM-1 cells were grown on gelatin with serum supplemented
medium). Gao et al. 2003 shows 60-70% subconfluent HM-1 populations as having a
different cell cycle profile (33.8% in Gl, 37.3% in S and 28.9% in G2/M) to 50-60%
HM-1 populations analysed here (32.8% in Gl, 48.8% in S, and 18.4% in G2/M). Gao's
cells were grown in serum depleted medium (5% serum) for 24 hours prior to analysis
and this appears to change cell characteristics. Comparing Gao's data with data detailed
in Table 6.1 there is a decrease in the percentage ofHM-1 cells in S phase, suggesting a
slowing of the cell cycle. This would be expected in serum depleted conditions.
The observed increase of 2c cells in the superconfluent population compared to
HM-1 cells at other confluence ranges may be due to differentiation of the ES cells. In
general, differentiated cells cycle more slowly than embryonic cells [Savatier et al.
2000] [Murray & Hunt 1993], and have more checkpoints that need to be overcome prior
to the cells initiating DNA synthesis [Murray & Hunt 1993]. Thus, the probability of
differentiated cells being 2c at any given time will be higher than that of an ES cell.
It is interesting that the 90-100% confluent population gave the highest
phenotypic ES hybridisation frequencies and also contained the highest proportion of ES
cells in G2/M. These cells, poised to undergo mitosis, not only contain a tetraploid
complement of DNA but also contain twice the volume of cytoplasm. One might
speculate that by fusing these G2/M ES cells to a somatic cell, one has a better chance of
reprogramming the nucleus given this greater abundance of ES derived regulatory
factors. If this was the case, one might expect where tetraploid hybrids, generated by ES
cell x ES cell fusions, were themselves fused to somatic cells there may be an even
greater incidence of thymocyte nuclear reprogramming.
As discussed in Section [1.3], cells in M phase induce mitosis in the fusion
partner regardless of its previous cell cycle stage. If a G2 cell fuses to another cell that is
in interphase, G2 nucleus remains arrested at the G2/M checkpoint until the second
nucleus has also progressed to G2 and then both nuclei initiate mitosis simultaneously.
As others have shown the proportion of cycling ES cells in G2 to be relatively small
[Savatier et al. 2000], one might speculate that the number of ES cells in M phase
increases as 100% confluence is approached. Cells, at the G2/M transition or in the M
phase, display high MPF activities [Jung et al. 1993]. MPF activity promotes the
breakdown of the nuclear membrane, and as many suspect that exposure of chromatin to
cytoplasm is a necessary trigger for reprogramming, then one might expect cells with
high MPF activity to promote greater reprogramming. The decrease in the proportion of
ES cells in G1 (G1 cells have low MPF levels) and the increase in the proportion of ES
cells in G2/M (G2/M cells have high levels) means that the ES cell population will
contain more cells with a high level of MPF [See Fig 1.5]. Perhaps this causes more
frequent somatic and ES nuclear membrane breakdown and thus nuclear reprogramming
is more common. To test this hypothesis, one could disrupt MPF activation (eg. partial
suppression of cdc2 kinase) in the confluent ES cell populations prior to fusion or
express MPF in subconfluent ES cells and observe whether these treatments affects
reprogramming.
[6.3.7] HM-1 cell confluence affects the induction of heat shock protein
Hsp72
Growing cells to confluence is a classic trigger for inducing a stress response in
many cell types [Garrido et al. 1997]. Another potential explanation for the data is as ES
cells approach confluence they express progressively higher levels of stress shock
proteins that facilitate somatic nuclear reprogramming after fusion. Chaperone activity
of induced stress response proteins repairs misfolded protein and RNA components of
the cell's machinery necessary for many function including altering the somatic
chromatin. Some Hsps have even been shown to play a role in chromatin structural
changes directly [Nover 1994]. Fig 6.9 shows the induction of Hsp72 expression in ES
cells as they approach confluence.

Fig 6.9 HM-1 cell confluence affects the induction ofHsp72
Whole cell lysates were generated from ES cell populations displaying four different
ranges of confluence. 150|ag protein of HM-1 cell lysate representing each confluence
range was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel, run, transferred and probed with anti-
Hsp72 as described in Subsection [2.7.3]. Panel A Western blot probed with anti-
Hsp72. The control was the antibody manufacturer control lysate, a heat shocked Hela
cell lysate. As the confluence of HM-1 cells increased, more Hsp72 was detected in the
lysates. PaneI B The same plot was reprobed with anti-|3-actin to confirm the same
amount of protein lysate had been added to each lane.
Hsp72 induction increased as HM-1 cells became more confluent. However it
remains unclear if this or other stress induced factors are important for nuclear
reprogramming. This could explain why both reprogramming of and by ES cells is
increased when more confluent ES cells are used.
The hypothesis that stress induced proteins (Hsps) are important to nuclear
reprogramming could be tested if their induction in HM-1 cells could be temporarily
disrupted in some way [eg. addition of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prior to
fusion]. If such HM-1 cells failed to show elevated hybridisation frequencies (hybrid /
heterokaryon) after cell confluence this might suggest stress induced proteins may be
involved in reprogramming.
[6.3.8] Confluence does not affect HM-1 cell size
The only difference Gao et al. observed between their ES populations of different
degrees of confluence was that "more small sized cells" were observed at the 80-90%
confluent population than the 60-70% confluent one. This was based on visual analysis
looking at the cells under the microscope. No discernable difference was seen in cell size
when similar assessments were repeated here. However HM-1 cell morphology was
difficult to assess as individual cell boundaries become less distinct at higher densities
[See Fig 6.1 Panel B]. In order to make a more objective assessment, Forward Scatter
(FCS) FACS analysis was used to measure cell sizes of different populations [See Fig
6.10], The forward scatter spectra of the four cell populations representing each
confluence range overlaid perfectly indicating there was no significant change in cell
size as populations became more confluent. Only the > 100% confluent (blue) spectrum
showed any difference: a small proportion of larger cells that also exhibited a greater
degree of granularity when FACS analysed for side scatter. Such cells are almost
certainly newly differentiated cells.

confluence does not affect cell size.
|6.3.9] HM-1 cell passage number affects their capacity to reprogram PEF nuclei in
cell hybrids
Finally, the effect of ES cell passage number on the cell's capacity to
reprogramme somatic nuclei was investigated. Although many reports linked a decline
of germline transmission in ES chimeras with increasing passage number [Longo et al.
1997][Zhou et al. 2001], its effect on successful nuclear reprogramming in nuclear
transfer experiments is less clear. A correlation between cloning problems and
increasing cell passage was made in sheep studies [Wilmut et al. 1997][McCreath et al.
2000][Schnieke et al. 2000], Additionally Gao el al. 2003 had also reported that passage
number of R1 ES cells affected developmental potential of reconstructed embryos. In
contrast though, many reports have failed to show that passage number affects nuclear
transfer efficiencies. Wakayama et al. (1999), using R.1 cells at passage 34, failed to
observe such a passage number related effect. Zhou et al. (2001) reported that using high
R1 cell passage (28) resulted in no change in the proportion of reconstructed embryos
developing to morula / blastocyst stage. There was a decrease in the rate of embryo
implantation compared to control embryos derived from lower passage ES nuclei.
Bovine studies have also shown a lack of evidence that cell passage affects nuclear
transfer efficiencies [Hill et al. 2000][Kubota et al. 2000].
Several standard electrofusion experiments using CBA PEFs (Passage 3) and
HM-lpur0 of various passage numbers (ranging from 17 to 53) were carried out. As Fig
6.11 shows the hybrid colony yield was affected by passage number. Experiments where
HM-lpuro cells at passage number > 36 were used failed to produce hybrid colonies
(n = 4); whereas experiments using cells of lower passage number produced hybrid
colonies (n = 4).

Fusions between CBA PEFs (Passage 3) and HM-lpur0 cells of various passage number
were carried out under standard electrofusion conditions. The resultant hybrid colony
number is plotted against passage number of the ES cells used in each fusion.
In research generating chimeras from ES cells, a decrease in germline transmission has
long been observed with ES cells of high passage. This, in some cases, has been found to
be related to progressive loss of euploidy [Longo et al. 1997] while in others this was
not found to be so [Zhou et al. 2001]. The ploidy of HM-lpuro cells was assessed to
investigate whether cells became aneuploid as they were grown to higher passage.
Mitotic spreads of HM-lpuro cells at passage 31 and 36 were generated using the cells
from the same frozen stocks used to carry out the previous fusions. Cells at these
passages were chosen as this was where the cells lost their capacity to generate
phenotypic ES hybrids. Interestingly, cells at passage 31 were euploid, while passage 36
cells were not: of the 50 spreads counted, 5 had an extra chromosome and 5 had two
extra chromosomes. The loss of nuclear reprogramming activity in the ES cell line
correlated with the appearance of aneuploidy. Karyotypic analysis showed random
chromosome duplication rather than the copying of any particular chromosome was
enough to disrupt nuclear reprogramming. Representative karyotypes of HMlpuro cells at
passage 31 and 36 are shown in Fig 6.12. 40 of 50 spreads still have a euploid number
so this alone would only account for a 20% reduction in the number of hybrids, so there
must be other factors in addition to misregulation of chromosome number that are
involved. Perhaps the mechanisms that regulates genotypic stability are necessary for
nuclear reprogramming.

Mitotic spreads of HMlpuro cells at passage 31 and 36 were generated. At passage 31, all
50 spreads counted displayed a diploid complement (40 chromosomes). At passage 36
however, only 40 of the spreads were diploid, 5 contained 41 chromosomes and 5
contained 42. Karyotypic analysis revealed that in no chromosome was triplicated more
than once suggesting random chromosome duplication. In the representative karyotype
shown, there are three copies of chromosome 8 (the red arrow highlights the third
inappropriate copy).
[6.4] Conclusions
Confluence of HM-1 cells affected their capacity to reprogram thymocyte nuclei
in cell hybrids (P=0.014). Hybrid colony yield increased as HM-1 confluence increased
until HM-1 cells reached 100% confluence and began to differentiate. The optimum ES
cell confluence range for nuclear reprogramming was found to be 90-100%, which had
previously been used in all hybridisation experiments because of the high cell numbers
required for each experiment. It would be interesting to investigate whether somatic cell
confluence also affects hybridization frequencies. Gao et al. 2003 showed that the more
confluent an ES cell population, the more readily nuclei from those ES cells could be
completely reprogrammed when transferred into oocytes.
In an effort to understand why HM-1 cell confluence affected nuclear
reprogramming the cell cycle characteristics of HM-1 cells were analysed. As the cells
approach 100% confluence, the proportion of cells in G1 decreases, the proportion in
G2/M phases increased while the proportion in S remains unchanged. As MPF triggers
nuclear membrane breakdown and G1 cells have a low level of MPF activity while
G2/M cells have a high level, it was hypothesised that perhaps the overall increase in
MPF levels of HM-1 cell populations as they approach confluence may account for the
increase in reprogramming. This could be tested by altering the MPF activity of HM-1
cells (either by expressing the genes coding for the factor, or by decreasing MPF activity
by partially suppressing cdc2 kinase expression with RNA interference) and
investigating whether there is any change in their nuclear reprogramming capacity.
In addition to affecting cell cycle characteristics, ES cell confluence was
associated with induction of stress response factor Hsp72. As HM-1 cells approached
confluence, higher levels of Hsp72 were observed. This indicates that confluence is a
trigger for the stress response in HM-1 cells. It was hypothesised that some aspect of the
stress response may facilitate reprogramming.
The passage number of HM-1 cells affected their capacity to reprogram PEFs.
Fusion experiments using HM-lpuro cells of passage number >36 yielded no hybrids
whereas those of passage < 31 did. This correlated with the cells becoming aneuploid. It
was hypothesisied that mechanisms required for genotypic stability also have a role in
nuclear reprogramming.
[7] The effect of serum starvation and quiescence on
the murine cell hybrid system
[7.1] Introduction
In the absence of factors that stimulate proliferation, some mitotic cell types
stop dividing and enter a reversible state termed quiescence or GO. A quiescent cell
can reinitiate proliferation if growth factors are re-introduced. This distinguishes
quiescence from senescence (another viable though non-proliferative cellular state)
where cells can no longer re-enter the cell cycle (Subsection [1.3] reviews the cycle
cell and quiescence in more detail).
It has been suggested that quiescent nuclei are more amenable to being
reprogrammed than cycling nuclei [Campbell 1996, Campbell et al. 1999]. The
successful production of Dolly used a nucleus from a cultured adult differentiated
somatic cell taken from a population of cells that had been serum starved into
quiescence [Wilmut et al. 1997]. Quiescence affects the histone composition of
chromatin and also the sub-nuclear distribution of chromatin structural proteins
[Khochbin & Wolffe 1994][Dimitrov & Wolffe 1996]. It is thought that some aspect
of these changes may make the nuclei of quiescent cells more amenable to being
reprogrammed [Pallante 2002],
Interpretation of nuclear transfer data from various groups has failed to
resolve whether quiescence affects nuclear reprogramming. The central problem lies
in not being able to verify the quiescent state of a cell and use its nuclei for nuclear
transfer at the same time, therefore no direct correlation between the quiescent state
and nuclear reprogramming success can be drawn. Campbell's contention that a
quiescent nucleus is more amenable to being reprogrammed than a nucleus at a
random cell cycle stage has yet to be proven (see Subsection [1.8.1] for more detail).
Two observations have raised doubt as to whether quiescence is beneficial for
nuclear reprogramming: (a) quiescent cells such as terminally differentiated neurons
fail to support development to term of nuclear transfer embryos [Yamazaki et al.
2001], and (b) cattle have been successfully cloned using apparently non-quiescent
foetal fibroblasts as nuclear donors [Cibelli et al. 1998].
The aim of this chapter was to investigate the effect of quiescence on nuclear
reprogramming on the murine cell hybrid system. The successful generation of ES
phenotypic cell hybrids from primary embryonic fibroblasts (Section [3.3.4])
provided the opportunity to do this. Fibroblasts could be rendered quiescent by serum
starvation [Itahana et al. 2002][Kill et al. 1991],
[7.2] Objective
To investigate the effect of serum starving fibroblasts into quiescence on the murine
cell hybrid system.
[7.3] Results and discussion
[7.3.1] Serum starvation of primary embryonic fibroblast renders them
quiescent
In order to investigate the effect of quiescence on nuclear reprogramming,
one had first to verify that serum starvation of primary embryonic fibroblasts
rendered them quiescent. Figure 7.1 (overleaf) shows that fibroblasts, cultured in
low serum conditions, ceased proliferating, whereas control PEFs continued until
they became contact inhibited (day 4). At day 6 serum starved PEFs were re
introduced to normal serum conditions, and by day 7 they had resumed proliferating.

and left for 24hr in PEF medium. After 24 hours (Day 0), serum starvation medium
was used to feed seven of the flasks, while the other seven were fed with PEF
medium. The flasks were maintained in either PEF or serum starvation medium for
up to six days. Normal serum levels are applied to both control and serum starved
populations on day 6. Growth curves were generating by sacrificing and counting the
number of viable PEFs in one control flask and one serum starved flask every 24hr.

Fibroblast populations grown in low serum conditions contained fewer cells
expressing PCNA than control populations (Fig 7.2). During the first six days of the
experiment, less than 10% of nuclei stained positive for PCNA whereas in control
populations over 60% of nuclei stained positive. Serum starved PEFs were
reintroduced to normal serum conditions on day 6 and on day 7, 575% of nuclei
derived from these serum reactivated cells were PCNA positive.
Furthermore, the cell cycle characteristics of fibroblasts were affected by
serum levels (Fig 7.3 overleaf)- When fibroblasts were serum starved, the proportion
of cells in G1/G0 rose (from 53.7 to 73.0%) while the relative amount in S and G2/M
fell (from 8.6 to 2.7% and from 37.7 to 24.3% respectively). Reintroduction of serum
starved fibroblasts to normal serum conditions resulted in the cell cycle
characteristics changing until they became similar to control PEFs (52.5% in G1/G0,
8.7% in S, and 38.8% in G2/M).
Pallante (2002) had also shown an increase in the number of cells in G1/G0
when she serum starved murine PEFs (63.9 to 65.9%). She also noted that there was
a decline in the proportion of cells in S phase (10.6% to 3.5%). However unlike data
presented here, she reports an increase in the proportion of cells in G2/M (from
25.5% to 30.5%). This difference could not be accounted for.
It was also found that serum starvation altered the morphology of the cells
(Fig 7.4). Fibroblasts, placed in low serum conditions, lost their long tapered
morphology and flattened out. However when these cells were reintroduced to
normal serum levels, they quickly reacquired their original fusiform morphology.
Pillante 2002 had previously reported that murine PEFs changed morphology when
they were rendered quiescent. Her observations were consistent with those described
here.
In summary, serum starvation stopped cell proliferation, down-regulated
PCNA expression, increased the number of cells in G1/G0 of the cell cycle, and
caused loss of the fibroblast fusiform morphology. Reintroduction of serum reversed
all these effects. Taken together these data confirm that the serum starvation
conditions used here renders fibroblasts quiescent.

[7.3.2] Serum starvation of primary embryonic fibroblasts increases hybrid
colony yield
Large numbers of quiescent PEFs were required for the subsequent
fusion/hybridisation experiments, and to minimise the amount of time and materials
needed to generate these cells, a greater plating density was required than used in
previous experiments. The maximum initial seeding density (IPD) which did not
result in significant amount of cell death under conditions used (i.e. 24hr culture in
murine ES medium followed by serum starvation) was empirically found to be
15,000 cells / cm2 [Fig 7.5], This plating density was used for all subsequent
fibroblast fusion experiments.
Serum starvation of the fibroblasts into quiescence increased hybrid colony
yield (Fig 7.6) (P<0.05 as calculated using the Student's paired t-test [Caria 2000]).
Hybridisation experiments using quiescent fibroblasts yielded on average 38.6111.6
fold more colonies than control experiments.

5 12 cm plates. One plate was used for FACS analysis to measure cell viability and
heterokaryon formation. Twenty four hours after electropulsing, double selection
mES medium (lxHAT and 2.5 pg/ml puromycin) was applied to the cells in the
remaing plates. Panel A The colour code used throughout this chapter to represent

[7.3.3] Serum starvation of fibroblasts does not affect cell viability of
electropulsed cells but does decrease heterokaryon formation
In order to see if quiescence affected nuclear reprogramming of fibroblasts,
viability of cells after electropulsing and the proportion of viable cells forming
heterokaryons was measured for each replicate experiment.
Fig 7.7 shows that serum starving the PEFs did not affect viability of
electropulsed cell mixtures (P>0.05 as calculated using a Student's paired t-test (one
tailed) [Caria 2000]). When 2-dye FACS analysis was performed on the cells, it was
found that serum starving the cells decreased heterokaryon formation [Figs 7.8 &
7.9] (P<0.05 as calculated using the Student's paired t-test (2 tailed) [Ciara 2000].
It was speculated that perhaps proliferating cells are more likely to fuse than
quiescent cells, although no reports were found in the literature investigating whether
this is true.

[7.3.4] Serum starvation of fibroblasts increases nuclear reprogramming
Fusions with serum starved fibroblasts had higher phenotypic ES hybridization
frequencies than controls (P<0.05 as calculated by the Student's paired t-test (2
tailed) [Caria 2002]). On average, the hybridisation frequencies (hybrid /
heterokaryon) were 5311 fold higher than controls [Fig 7.10].
This result is consistent with observations that quiescence render nuclei more
amenable to being reprogrammed [Campbell 1999], Campbell assumed that the
characteristic of serum starved cells that made their nuclei easier to reprogram was
related to the cells being quiescent. However serum starvation has a much broader
affect on cells that just affecting their cell cycle.

Four replicate experiments electro fused HM-lpur0 cells to either control or serum
starved fibroblasts. Experiments generated data on hybrid yield, viable heterokaryon
formation and cell viability. These data were used to calculate ES phenotypic
hybridisation frequencies as described in Section [2.2.6]. The graph shows mean
phenotypic ES hybridisation frequencies and associated error for both treatments as
calculated from four replicate experiments.
[7.3.5] Serum starvation of fibroblasts strongly induces expression of Hsp72
Fig 7.11 shows the serum starved PEFs show high levels ofHsp72, indicating
the cells are undergoing a stress response. This result illustrates that there are serum
starvation does a lot more to the cell than just render it quiescent. It was decided to
investigate whether quiescence was the characteristic of cells that made their nuclei
easier to reprogram. An experiment was designed where serum starved fibroblasts
were reintroduced to normal serum levels. If Campbell's hypothesis is correct, then
one would expect that the nuclei of reactivated PEFS would be more difficult to
reprogram as they will have re-entered the cell cycle. This experiment is discussed in
the next subsection.

Whole cell lysates were generated from ES cell populations displaying four
different ranges of confluence. 150 pg protein of lysate generated from control or
serum starved PEFs was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel, run, transferred and
probed with anti-Hsp72 as described in Subsection [2.7.3], Panel A Western blot
probed with anti-Hsp72. The control was the antibody manufacturer control lysate, a
heat shocked Hela cell lysate. More Hsp72 expression was found in the serum
starved lysate. Panel B The same plot was reprobed with anti-(3-actin to confirm the
same amount of protein lysate had been added to each lane.
It is also interesting that here and in Chapter 6 where there are significant
increases in nuclear reprogramming, that there are also corresponding inductions of
hsp72. Perhaps some aspect of the stress response is facilitating reprogramming. In
Chapter 5, the effect of stressing the cells was investigated. Heat shocking
thymocytes at 42C for 10 minutes induced a moderate rise of Hsp72 expression over
control levels [Fig 5.1] but as it as is unknown whether the incidence of nuclear
reprogramming was increased (due to increased cell fusion and insufficient
replication of the experiment) these heat shock data cannot be used to either support
or refute this stress response hypothesis.
[7.4.6] Hybrid colony yields remain elevated after serum reactivation
Within 24 hours after normal serum were reintroduced, previously starved
fibroblast populations began to proliferate (Fig 7.1). Soluble PCNA expression level
rapidly increased to that consistent with the control fibroblasts (Fig 7.2). If
quiescence is the characteristic making serum starved PEFs more amenable to being
reprogrammed, one would expect the hybrid colony yield to decrease when serum
reactivated PEFs are used for fusions. Surprisingly however this was not the case in
the pilot experiment (n = 1) (Fig 7.12).
Fig 7.12 shows that hybrid colony yield does not decrease to control levels
when serum reactivated PEFs are used in fusions. Figs 7.1-7.4 highlight that these
cells are no longer quiescent. Reactivated PEFs were observed to reinitiate
proliferation when looked at down the microscope. It time had permitted, the Hsp72
level in serum reactivated PEFS would have been measured to see if there was a
correlation between elevated hybridisation frequency (hybrid / heterokaryon) and
Hsp72 levels. Previous work in rodent fibroblasts has show that Hsp70 levels remain
high for 36 hours and more [Li & Werb 1982].

(Passage 22) were also fused with serum starved lxlO7 PEFs (Passage 3) that had
been reintroduced to normal serum conditions for either 24 or 48hr prior to being
fused. PEFs to be serum reactivated were seeded at lower plating densities than
normal (10,000 cells/cm2 for 24hr reactivation and 7,500 cells/cm2 for 48hr
reactivation) so that any affect of serum reactivation could not be attributed to
differences in PEF confluence. These plating efficiencies resulted in serum
reactivated PEF populations with comparable levels of confluence to the control and
serum starved PEF populations prior to disaggregation and electropulsing. Panel A
shows a graph of hybrid colony yield versus PEF treatment. Panel B shows the same
data in tabular form. This experiment was unable to be replicated (n=l) due to time
restrictions.
[7.4] Conclusions
Serum starvation of primary embryonic fibroblasts resulted in several
changes: a cessation in proliferation; a decrease in PCNA expression, a loss of
fusiform morphology; and a change in the proportion of cells at different stages of
the cell cycle. Reintroduction of normal serum levels to such cells reversed these
changes. These results show that serum starvation renders PEFs quiescent.
Fusions using serum starved fibroblasts yielded on average 35 fold more
hybrid colonies than similar fusions using control fibroblasts (52.34.0 versus
1.50.5). Serum starvation caused decreases in both the viability of electropulsed
cells and viable heterokaryon formation. Experiments using serum starved fibroblasts
displayed hybridisation frequencies (hybrid / heterokaryon) on average 5311 fold
higher than in controls. This indicates that serum starvation of primary embryonic
fibroblasts affects nuclear reprogramming in the murine hybrid system.
Serum starvation induced a stress response in primary embryonic fibroblasts
as shown by the strong induction of inducible heat shock protein, Hsp72.
A single experiment using serum reactivated fibroblasts showed that the
hybrid colony yield remained elevated even after the cells had re-entered the cell
cycle. If reproducible, this experiment would suggest that a characteristic of serum
starved fibroblasts other than quiescence, is facilitating nuclear reprogramming.
[8] The effect of Xenopus nucleoplasmin expression on the
murine cell hybrid system
[8.1] Introduction
The aims of this chapter are two fold: (a) to investigate the effect of
expressing the Xenopus molecular chaperone, nucleoplasmin, on nuclear
reprogramming in the murine hybrid system and (b) to generate a lab resource
pTetNPM, an expression plasmid into which different transgenes could be easily
introduced and controllably expressed. This introduction deals first with the
evidence suggesting nucleoplasmin might affect nuclear reprogramming. Then in
order to clarify how pTetNPM may be used to transiently induce the expression of
Xenopus nucleoplasmin and other 'exchanged' transgenes, the Tet-On expression
system, and Cre mediated cassette exchange are described.
[8.1.1] Xenopus nucleoplasmin and reprogramming
The factors involved in a nucleus's reacquisition of developmental potential
are unknown. Development of the mouse cell hybrid system, as a model for nuclear
reprogramming, provided the opportunity to attempt to identify such factors. Global
changes in gene expression, which occur during nuclear reprogramming are
associated with major structural changes of chromatin [as reviewed by Wolffe
(1996)].
The Xenopus nuclear chaperone nucleoplasmin [Subsection 1.10.1.1] plays a
part in altering chromosome structure [Laskey et al. 1978]. Dilworth et al. 1987 have
shown that Xenopus nucleoplasmin, which is expressed in extremely high levels in
Xenopus oocytes (it comprises 9-10% of all cellular protein), induces changes in the
chromosome structure in Xenopus erythrocyte nuclei. Dimitrov & Wolffe (1996)
found that nucleoplasmin directs the specific removal of somatic linker histones from
chromatin. Linker histone exchange from embryonic to somatic histone subtypes is a
common developmental feature (Linker histone exchange is discussed in Subsection
[1.10.3]).
Although genes with sequences very similar to Xenopus nucleoplasmin have
been cloned in mouse [Lange et al. 2003], rat [Szebeni et al 2003] and human [Chan
et al. 1989] [McArthur & Shackleford 1997], it has never been shown that such genes
produce proteins which interact with chromatin. Hence Xenopus nucleoplasmin and
not a related mammalian gene was chosen for these experiments.
Although it was assumed as this work was being done, it has since been
shown that nuclei of mammalian somatic cells (specifically adult mouse thymocytes
and adult human blood lymphocytes) are reprogrammed when injected into Xenopus
oocytes. These mammalian nuclei ceased expressing differentiation markers and
began to strongly express the pluripotent cell marker Oct-4 [Byrne et al. 2003] (Oct-
4 is discussed in Section [1.6]). This showed that factors in Xenopus ooplasm have
the capacity to reprogram Oct-4 promoter. The work carried out in this chapter
sought to test the hypothesis that Xenopus nucleoplasmin was the one of the key
factors involved in such reprogramming.
It was hypothesised that the removal of somatic linker histones from somatic
chromatin would facilitate the reprogramming of the somatic nucleus when fused to
an ES cell. The hypothesis is based on at least three assumptions:
(1) Xenopus nucleoplasmin could perform somatic linker histone stripping in the
murine cell hybrid system.
(2) As a result of somatic histone removal, embryonic linker histones would have
a greater access to chromatin.
(3) Incorporation of embryonic linker histones into the chromatin would facilitate
reprogramming.
[8.1.2] Tet-On system for inducible transgene expression
The Tet-On system was developed to permit the conditional activation of a
transgene [Gossen et al. 1995], It is based on the tetracycline resistance operon 'tet'
from E. coli transposon TnlO [Gossen et al. 1992][Furth et al. 1994]. This system is
a particularly good system for conditional transgene expression in animal cells. The
Tet-On system comprises a reverse transactivator protein (rtTA) which is a
regulatory protein composed of a mutant tet repressor fused to the activating domain
of viral protein VP 16 of herpes simplex virus. Upon activation, transcription is
driven from a minimal promoter fused to seven tet operator sequences from TnlO.
Transcriptional activation from this promoter is activated by administration of
tetracycline to the animal cell and inactivated upon withdrawal of the antibiotic. The
activation is caused by the binding of the antibiotic to rtTA. This changes the
confirmation of this rtTA allowing it to interact with the tet operon. Although
initially discovered using tetracycline, it has since been found that a similar
antibiotic, doxycycline, activates transcription in this constellation in the same way.
This antibiotic is now normally used in Tet-expression systems as it is cheaper and
less persistent in cells.
The Tet-On system would be used to inducibly express nucleoplasmin in
HM-1 cells. This requires the presence of both the regulatory plasmid pTNG (which
constitutively expresses the gene coding for the reverse transactivator) and a
response plasmid pTetNPM (which will express Xenopus nucleoplasmin in the
presence if rtTA and doxycycline) in this cell type. Once this has been accomplished
nucleoplasmin would be induced by addition of the antibiotic doxycycline to the
system (See Fig 8.1 overleaf).

tetracycline). Panel B Response Plasmid, pTetNPM (See Fig 8.4 for description of
pTetNPM). The doxycycline rtTA complex binds the tet response element (TRE) on
the response plasmid activiating transcription of the nucleoplasmin gene immediately
downstream and also the lacZ gene immediately upstream.
While not directly used in work outlined in this chapter, RCME requires discussion
to clarify how pTetNPM can be used and why introduction of 'incompatible loxP
sites' were incorporated into its design (Fig 12.5).
[8.1.3] Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)
The successful integration and expression of transgenes in mammalian cells
is subject to several technical hurdles being surmounted e.g. the transgene must be
incorporated into a site permissive for expression [Clark et al. 1994], or integration
of multiple copies of a transgene may result in transgene expression being silenced
[McBurney et al. 2002][Dorer (1997)]. Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange
(RMCE) is a useful strategy which allows the introduction of a single copy transgene
into a chromosomal locus previously shown to be permissive to transgene
expression.
RMCE is dependent on the specific activity of Cre recombinase [Sauer
1993][Mack et al. 1992]. Cre recombinase is a bacteriophage PI derived member of
the integrase family of enzymes [Sternberg 1979][Sternberg et al. 1986], indeed Cre
is an acronym for "causes recombination". The enzyme mediates precise site-specific
recombination between short DNA sequences called loxP sites. The structure and
sequence of loxP sites is outlined in Fig 8.2 (overleaf).
A loxP site consists of two 13bp inverted repeats and a central unique spacer
region. The role of the spacer region has been investigated and it has been shown that
Cre recombinase can only recombine efficiently loxP sites with identical spacer
sequences [Lee & Saito 1998], loxP sites with different spacer sequences are said to
be incompatible loxP sites (Fig 8.2 overleaf).

ATAACTTCGTATAAaGTATeCTATACGAAGTTAT
Fig 8.2 Sequence and structure of incompatible loxP sites
All loxP sites are 34-bp double stranded DNA fragments containg two Cre binding
sites (blue) flanking a spacer sequence (red). The spacer region sequence of a loxP
site affects its compatibility with other loxP sites i.e. loxP sites with different
mutations within the spacer sequence cannot be recombined by Cre activity. In work
done described in this chapter, wild type loxP sites and lox2722 sites (so called
incomatible loxP sites) were used to prevent Cre activity resulting in inversions of an
integrated cassette or the integration of an exchanged cassette in the wrong
orientation. The mutations to the lox2122 spacer sequence are denoted by green
lower case letters.
Cleavage and strand exchange of recombining compatible loxP sites occurs
within the spacer region of the sites. loxP sites have a directionality due to the
asymmetry of the spacer sequence [Hoess & Abremski 1984]. The directionality of
loxP sites affects the result of Cre mediated recombination: recombination between
two directly repeated compatible loxP sites results in excision of the intervening
DNA sequence. Cre-mediated recombination between pairs of compatible loxP sites
that have an opposite orientation results in inversion of the intervening DNA rather
than excision.
The possibility of Cre-mediated recombination with an endogenous
eukaryotic sequence is minute due to the length of the loxP sequence and specificity
of the Cre recombinase [Kilbey et al. 1993]. However, recombinase recognition sites
have been identified in mouse and human genomes and these '"pseudo-loxP sites"
complicate matters in vitro [Thyagarajan et al. 2000] and in vivo [Schmidt et al.
2000]. Only two reports of such "illegitimate Cre recombination" have been
published however while many papers report successful application of the system.
One way of minimising illigitimate recombination is by removing the recombinase
from the system after the desired recombination event has occurred [Bunting et al.
1999],
The action of Cre recombinase at loxP sites represents a valuable tool for
manipulating the mammalian genome. Several transgenic strategies such as
integrated transgene excision and inversion have proved very efficient using this
system [Metzger and Feil 1999], Furthermore, Cre also has the advantage of not
requiring any other cofactors to carry out recombination, unlike other members of the
integrase family.
The RMCE system was to be used when pTetNPM has been stably
transfected into mES cells and integrated at a site permissive for transgene
expression. It would allow exchange of cassettes between an integrated site on the
genome and episomal DNA. The nucleoplasmin cassette will be exchanged with
other cassettes containing transgenes of interest. This strategy is outlined in Fig 8.3
(overleaf).

Fig 8.3 Use of recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to insert other
genes besides nucleoplasmin into a site permissible for Tet inducible transgene
expression
When pTetNPM is stably integrated into mES cells at a site permissive for transgene
expression, RCME would be used to exchange the nucleoplasmin cassette for other
cassette. Using this strategy, the nucleoplasmin cassette (purple rectangle) located on
the chromosome would be exchanged for any cassette X (green rectangle) present on
a plasmid. Both genes are flanked by wild type and mutated loxP sites [loxP (yellow
triangle) and lox2722 (blue triangle) respectively]. Use of incompatible loxP site
prevents chopping of the nucleoplasmin cassette out altogether when Cre is
activated. Several possible products of Cre recombination can be generated. High
concentrations of plasmid DNA should be added to the cells to alter the reaction
equilibrium such that transgene exchange becomes a more probable outcome of the
reaction. The exchange of the X cassette for the nucleoplasmin cassette may occur
via two different series of reactions. Ideally, the X cassette would contain a
selectable marker so that cells is which the RMCE has taken place can be isolated.
This figure was modified from Bouhassira et al. (1997).

[8.3] Results and discussion
[8.3.1] Expression strategies for investigating the effect of
nucleoplasmin on nuclear reprogramming
Two expression vectors, pSV40NPM and pTetNPM, were built to study the
effect of Xenopus nucleoplasmin on nuclear reprogramming. pSV40NPM was
constructed, as shown in Fig 12.4, by cloning a nucleoplasmin cassette into
constitutive expression vector pTracerSV40 (described in Subsection [2.5.3]).
pTetNPM was constructed, as shown in Fig 12.5, by cloning a floxed nucleoplasmin
cassette into the inducible expression vector pBI-G (described in Subsection [2.5.3]).
The two plasmids constructed, in addition to pTNG (the Tet-On response
plasmid), are described in Fig 8.4. Using these three plasmids, two strategies for
expressing nucleoplasmin in the hybrid system would be investigated. The first
strategy would constitutively express nucleoplasmin using pSV40NPM. As Xenopus
nucleoplasmin affects lower chromatin structure [Dimitrov & Wolffe 1996], it was
suspected that cells would be sensitive to constitutive high levels of nucleoplasmin
expression. A second more complicated strategy which allowed transient expression
of nucleoplasmin at different levels was also developed as a backup in case
constitutive expression was toxic to the cells. The principle steps in both the
'constitutive' and 'inducible' expression strategies are shown in Fig 8.5.
Fig 8.4 Description of plasmids pSV40NPM, pTNG and pTetNPM
pSV40NPM is an expression vector used to study the constitutive expression of
nucleoplasmin. pSV40NPM contains the viral pSV40 promoter driving the
constitutive expression of the nucleoplasmin gene. It also contains a constitutively
expressed GFP/Zeocin fusion cassette that allows pSV40NPM cells to be identified
by GFP fluorescence and selected for with antibiotic zeocin.
pTetNPM is a Tet-inducible response plasmid, with a bi-directional promoter (Pbi)
driving a reporter gene (LacZ) and a floxed nucleoplasmin cassette. This construct
was primarily developed as a resource for inducible transgene expression within the
research group: one the plasmid is stable transfected into cells, single copy
transgenes could be integrated into sites permissive for transgene expression via
recombinase-mediated cassette exchange and expression of these genes could be
induced with doxycycline. With regards to work described in this thesis however,
pTetNPM would be used to overexpress one particular transgene coding for the
nuclear chaperone, nucleoplasmin, in order to investigate its effect on nuclear
reprogramming.
pTNG is a regulatory plasmid used to produce the reverse transactivator, a necessary
regulator protein required for tetracycline induced transgene expression (See Fig
8.1). The plasmid contains the reverse transactivator gene constitutively dnven by a
modified viral promoter (phCMV). pTNG also contains a constutively expressing
GFP cassette. TNG-8, a HM-1 subclone stably transfected with this plasmid and
which strongly expressing the rtTA gene, was acquired from Dr. Edward Gallagher.

Fig 8.5 Strategies for Xenopus nucleoplasmin expression in the mouse hybrid
system
In the first strategy, the effect of constitutive nucleoplasmin expression is
investigated, (a) HM-l cells were transiently transfected with either pTracerSV40 or
pSV40NPM (pTracerSV40 with an integrated nucleoplasmin cassette). Transfection
is verified by measuring GFP expression. The two transfected populations are placed
in selection for reprogrammed hybrid cells after 24 hours, (b) In the second strategy,
the effect of inducible NPM expression was investigated. TNG-8 cells (HM-l cells
constitutively expressing the reverse transactivator) are transfected with pTetNPM
(pBI-G with an integrated floxed nucleoplasmin cassette). LacZ staining of a portion
of these cells is carried out to confirm that the bi-directional promoter was activated
in response to doxycycline addition. Populations of such cells exposed to different
concentrations of doxycycline were then fused to thymocytes.
[8.3.2] Constitutive expression ofXenopus nucleoplasmin affects
HM-1 cell viability
HM-1 cells were lipofected with pTracerSV40 and pSV40NPM to assess the effects
of transient nucleoplasmin expression on HM-1 cells. Both pTracerSV40 and
pSV40NPM both contained the same independently expressing GFP cassette
allowing the assessment of transfection efficiencies using the two plasmids. The
proportion of cells expressing GFP one day after transfection was analysed by FACS
(Fig 8.6 Panel A). This verified that transfection efficencies for transfection using
either plasmid were similar.
The cell viabilities of transfected and untransfected HM-1 wells were assessed every
twenty four hours for four days after transfection. Cell viabilities of transfected wells
were expressed as a percentage of those in untransfected control wells. Fig 8.6 Panel
B shows after 48 hours, pSV40NPM transfected wells displayed significantly higher
levels of cell death than in either pTracerSV40 transfected or untransfected wells.
This indicates that transient nucleoplasmin expression is toxic to HM-1 cells. 96
hours after transfection, pTracerSV40 transfected wells contained 80.46.2% the
number of viable cells present in untransfected wells whereas pSV40NPM wells
contained only 18.42.1%. Furthermore, the number of viable GFP expressing cells
decreased more rapidly in pSV40NPM wells than in the pTracerSV40 wells (Fig 8.6
Panel C). 48 hr after transfection for example, 40.21.1% of viable cells expressed
GFP in pTracerSV40 transfected wells whereas only 17.10.8%. Taken together,
these data indicate that the level of nucleoplasmin expression is toxic to HM-1 cells.
Fig 8.6 Panel D shows an image of wells Giemsa stained 96 hours after transfection.
Almost all the cells in the pSV40NPM wells have died in contrast to untransfected
and pTracerSV40 transfected wells where cells had not.
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Xenopus nucleoplasmin
will interact with murine chromatin and mediate linker histone exchange but may
also arise as a consequence of non-specific toxicity. It was probable that the system
would be sensitive to strength and duration of nucleoplasmin expression. The
inducible expression strategy was now pursued.

(8.3.3] Transient nucleoplasmin expression affects the viability of
TNG-8 cells and decreases a decrease in hybrid colony yield
Data described in this section come from an experiment where TNG-8 cells were
transfected on Day 0, exposed to either 0, 10 or 100 nM doxycycline for 1 hour on
day 1, and either assessed for cell viability or fused to thymocytes on day 2. TNG-8
cells used for lacZ staining [Fig 8.6], cell viability assessment [Fig 8.7] cells and
fusions [Table 8.1] came from the same transfection experiment.
TNG-8 cells transfected with either pBI-G or pTetNPM and exposed to two
concentrations of doxycycline (10 or lOOnM) for one hour were stained for LacZ
expression 24hours after doxycychn exposure as described in Subsection 12.4.3].

Subsection [2.1.2.1], Twenty four hours after transfection transfected and
untransfected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 1
hr. Twenty four hours after doxycycline exposure cells were fixed, permeabilised and
LacZ stained as described in Subsection [2.4.5].
similar proportions of positively stained cells were found in pBI-G and pTetNPM
transfected wells that had been exposed to similar concentrations of doxycycline
indicating that pBI-G and pTetNPM transfections had similar transfection
efficiencies indicating that there was no toxic effect of nucleoplasmin in the first 24
hour period. It also showed that doxycycline exposure activates transcription from
the bidirectional promoters of pBI-G and pTetNPM. Cells exposed to lOOnM
doxycycline concentrations displayed stronger staining intensity than those exposed
to lOnM concentrations. Control wells where TNG-8 cells transfected with either
pBI-G or pTetNPM but had not been exposed to doxycycline showed no detectable
lacZ staining [Fig 8.7], This indicates a dose dependent relationship between
doxycycline and transcription from the bi-directional promoter.
The effect of transfection and doxycycline exposure on cell viability was
assessed for cells exposed to 10 nM concentrations of doxycycline. Fig 8.8 (overleaf)
shows TNG-8 cells transiently transfected with either pBI-G or pTetNPM (hereafter
called TNG-8pB1"G andTNG-8pTetNPM cells respectively) that were exposed for one
hour to 10(iM doxycycline 24 hours prior to staining. Cell viability was expressed as
a percentage of untransfected TNG-8 cells exposed to 10p,M doxycycline for 1 hour.
The graph shows that TNG-8pletNPM cell viability decreased more rapidly than the
pBI-G transfected controls indicating that transient expression of nucleoplasmin at
this level was toxic to TNG-8 cells.
Time after doxycycline exposure
(hours)
Fig 8.8 TNG-8 cell viability is affected by nucleoplasmin expression induced by
exposing the cells to 0.1 pM doxycycline for 1 hour
Wells containing TNG-8, TNG-8 pB1~Cj and TNG-8 pletNPM cells were incubated with
in 1 OnM doxycycline for 1 hr. The proportions of viable cells in replicate wells were
assessed at four time points after doxycycline exposure (24, 48, 72, 96 hr) using
Forward Scatter / Side Scatter FACS analysis as described in Section [12.3]. Cell
viabilities of pBI-G (--) and pTetNPM (--) transfected wells were expressed as
percentages of those measured in untransfected control wells. Error bars show
associated standard error of the mean cell viability calculated for each well.
Before cell viabilities were assessed, TNG-8 cells from the same transfection
experiment were fused to thymocytes under standard murine electrofusion conditions
and placed in selection for hybrids. The hybrid colony yields for these fusions are
shown in Table 8.1. TNG-8 cells not exposed to doxycycline generated the
approximate number of colonies seen in standard HM-1 x thymocyte fusions.
Exposure to 10 or lOOnM doxycycline did not significantly decrease hybrid colony
yield from fusions with these cells, nor fusions using TNG-8pBI" cells.
In fusions using TNG-8pletNPM cells, no decrease in hybrid yield was observed in the
absence of doxycycline exposure. If however the cells were exposed to either lOnM
or lOOnM concentrations of doxycycline, there was a >40% decrease in hybrid
colony yield. This result may be explained by fusion products dying due to too high a
level of nucleoplasmin expression being induced. Due to time constraints, other
similar experiments exposing cells to lower concentrations of doxycycline were not
carried out.

standard murine electrofusion conditions. Cells were placed in selection 48hr after
fusion and left for 12 days before colonies were counted.
[8.4] Conclusion
A lab resource, pTetNPM, was generated. This expression vector allowed
controllable transgene expression using the Tet-On expression system and was used
to transiently express Xenopus nucleoplasmin in the murine cell hybrid system. The
nucleoplasmin coding sequence was flanked with incompatible loxP sites so, when
stably integrated into cells at a site permissive for transgene expression, different
cassettes can be inserted using RMCE.
Transient transfection of HM-1 cells with pSV40NPM, which constitutively
expressed nucleoplasmin in the cells, caused significant cell death after 48 hours,
and after 96 hours, nearly all the transfected cells were dead.
TNG-8 cells were transiently transfected with either pBI-G or pTetNPM and
after 24 hours were exposed to either 0, 10 or 100 nanomolar concentrations of
doxycyclin. LacZ staining showed a dose dependent relationship between
transcription from the bi-directional promoters of pBI-G and pTetNPM.
In the wells containing TNG-8pretNPM cells that had been exposed to 10 nM
doxycycline, decreased cell viability was observed. This did not occur on pBI-G
transfected or untransfected control wells. This indicates nucleoplasmin was toxic to
the TNG cells at the induced levels of expression.
Fusions using TNG-8pTetNPM cells exposed to doxycycline showed decreased
hybrid colony yields compared to doxycycline exposed TNG-8pBI"G or non-
doxycycline exposed TNG-8pTctNPM controls. The most probable explanation is that
levels of nucleoplasmin induced in TNG-8 cells exposed to either lOnM or lOOnM
concentrations of doxycycline are killing hybrid cells. Future experiments should use
lower doxycycline concentrations or shorter doxycycline exposure times to stimulate
nucleoplasmin expression.
[9] Attempts to generate cell hybrids from human ES and
EC cells
[9.1] Introduction
The ultimate goal of scientists studying nuclear reprogramming is to restore a
human ES cell phenotype to a human adult differentiated cell. Such a reprogrammed
cell could be multiplied and differentiated into human cells required for biological
and therapeutic purposes, see Fig 1.1.
The aim of this chapter is to develop a system in which the nuclear
reprogramming activities of human ES and EC cells could be assessed and factors
affecting successful reprogramming could be identified. This would be done in a
manner similar to the murine work discussed earlier in this thesis i.e. via whole cell
hybridisation between selectable cell lines.
Work described in this chapter initially used human EC cells, but when
human ES cells became available, these were then subsequently used for two
reasons:
(i) it was assumed that ES cells would be a better model for studying
reprogramming as they should be untransformed and karyotypically
normal.
(ii) Unlike hEC cells [Duran et al. 2001][Tageki et al. 1983], no work had
been published investigating whether human ES cells can reprogram
somatic cells like their murine counterparts.
[9.2] Objectives
1) To generate cell hybrids from human ES or EC cell fusions
2) To optimise conditions for the generation of cell hybrids from human
ES cells
[9.3] Results and discussion
[9.3.1] Development of selection regimes to isolate human cell
hybrids
In order to carry out hybridisation experiments, selection for cell hybrids
derived from heterokaryons had to be developed for human cells as had previously
been done for murine cells (Subsection [3.3.1]). Several selectable cell lines were
generated:
HPRT deficient hEC subclones
6-thioguanine (6-TG) selection was used to attempt generation of HAT
sensitive (.HPRT deficient) hEC clones (Subsection [2.2.4] discusses 6-TG & HAT
selection and the HPRT gene). Three experiments where progressively greater
numbers ofNTERA-2 cells (lxlO8, 5xl08 and lxlO9) were place in 6-TG selection
(5 pg / ml for 2 weeks) failed to generate resistant colonies. This was surprising as
the cells are male and spontaneous mutation rates at the HPRT locus were expected
   f* 7  
to be higher than those seen in mouse ES cells (typically 1:10-10 as in Abuin et al.
2000). A similar experiment using lxl09 NCCIT cells also failed to generate HPRT
deficient colonies.
It was hypothesised that abnormal duplication of the HPRT locus in the hEC
cells might be the reason for this failure to isolate HPRT deficient clones. Should
multiple copies of the HPRT gene exist in these cells then the numbers of cells
placed in selection would be insufficient to isolate a HPRT deficient clone by
spontaneous mutation in in 6-TG selection. FISH analysis with an X-chromosome
specific paint was used to probe NTERA-2 mitotic spreads to investigate whether
there was abnormal duplication of X-chromsome segments (Fig 9.1). In 74% of all
spreads probed, abnormal duplication of segments of X-chromosome existed.
Consequently, it seems probable that attempts to generate HAT sensitive clones
failed due to these isochromosomal replications of HPRT containing region of the
chromosome. This was also assumed to be the reason for failure of similar
experiments using NCCIT cells.
Fig 9.1 Aneuploid NTERA-2 nuclei frequently have abnormally
replicated segments of the X-chromosome
Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) with a DNA probe for X chromosome (pink)
was performed on NTERA-2 metaphase slides as described in Subsection [2.3.4],
Slides were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Images show three representative
metaphases, where abnormal duplications of segments of the X-chromosome are
evident. Of the 50 spreads probed, 37 exhibited such abnormal duplication.
Antibiotic resistant hEC subclones
Kill curves generated for NTERA-2 cells showed that either 300pg / ml G418 or
3 pg / ml puromycin was sufficient to kill all wild type cells (Fig 9.2 & Fig 9.3
respectively - shown overleaf). Two selectable clones (NTERA-2neo and NTERA-
2puro) were generated by lipofecting cells with either pSV40neo and pPUR
(Subsection [2.1.2.1] contains details of how of hEC cells were lipofected while
Subsection [2.5.5] describes these plasmids). Stably transfected clones were
selecting in either 300pg / ml G418 (for SV40neo) or 3pg / ml puromycin (for pPur).

Plates were incubated overnight in murine ES medium. After 24 hours, plates was
fed murine ES media supplemented with a different concentration of G418 [0, 100,
200, 300 and 400 pg / ml]. Cells were cultured for an additional 9 days while
maintaining the concentration of G418. Cells incubated in both 0 and 100 pg / ml
G418 reached confluence during this time and these cells were disaggregated and
transferred to larger gelatinised dishes. After 9 days in G418, cells were trypsinised
and the number of cells in each plate was counted. Numbers of NTERA-2 cells and
NCCIT cells are represented by () and () respectively.

additional 9 days while maintaining the concentration of puromycin. Cells incubated
in Opg / ml puromycin reached confluence during this time and these cells were
disaggregated and transferred to larger gelatinised dishes. After 9 days in puromycin,

Antibiotic resistant hES lines
In collaboration with Dr. Alison Thomson a blasticidin selectable hES clone,
Hlblast, was generated by transfecting male hES (HI) cells with pLoxBSD2a, a
plasmid with a blasticidin gene drived by a constitutively active promoter [described
in Section 2.1.2.2], Several targeted clones were received from Dr. Thomson and
these were expanded and placed in 2 pg / ml blasticidin. Dr. Thompson has
previously generated a blasticidin kill curve which showed all wild type HI cells die
with this level of selection. Three expanded clones were resistant to blasticidin
selection. Controls wells transfected with pLoxBSD2b (a plasmid similar to
pLoxBSD2a except for the BSD coding sequence had been inserted in the wrong
orientation) died in the blasticidin selection. This confirmed that the expression of
the blasticidin trangene had made the cells resistant to the antibiotic.
HPRT deficient hES lines
Again in collaboration with Dr. Alison Thomson, HPRT deficient human ES
(HI) cells were generated. Dr. Thomson targeted the HPRT locus ofHI cells with an
an adeno-associated viral vector AAV-Hpe3PN [Hirata et al. 2002] and selected for
targeted clones. The student expanded three clones (H-1-6-1, HI-6-2 and HI-6-3)
and tested to see whether they were HAT sensitive. Untargetted HI cells grew to
confluence and showed no significant levels of cell death when placed in lxHAT
selection whereas Hl-6-1, Hl-6-2 and Hl-6-3 cells all died within four days under
the same conditions. The HPRT gene had been successfully targeted in all three
clones rendering them HAT sensitive.
[9.3.2] Attempts to generate cell hybrids from human ES and from
human EC cells failed
Before human ES cells became available, attempts to generate cell hybrids
from hEC lines was attempted. Using standard electrofusion conditions that had
successfully fused murine cells, two attempts were made to derive cell hybrids from
fusions of lxl07 NTERA-2ne0 and lxlO7 NTERA-2puro cells. After electropulsing and
culture in mES medium for 24 hours, cells were placed in selection (i.e. mES
medium supplemented with 4pg / ml puromycin and 300 pg / ml G418). These were
the minimum antibiotic concentrations shown to kill all NTERA-2 cells when
applied separately [See Fig 9.2 and Fig 9.3 (overleaf)]. No colonies were generated
and it was realised that perhaps inappropriate selection levels had been applied. Both
G418 and puromycin inhibit protein synthesis and would probably be more potent at
killing cells when applied together rather than singly. A control experiment was
planned where NTERA-2"eo would be stably transfected with pPUR generating a
doubly resistant subclone NTERA-2neo/puro. Double selection kill curves of this
subclone would then reveal appropriate selection levels to use when fusing singly
resistant NTERA-2 subclones. At this time, human ES cells became available and
this experiment was deprioritised in favour of experiments seeking to generate
hybrids from human ES cells. A hprt deficient, neomycin resistant NTERA-2
subclone, called TGI l.nR, had been received from Prof. Peter Andrews (Univeristy
of Sheffield). TGI l.nR was especially useful as one could fuse such a clone with
wild type hES cells and apply double selection to isolate cell hybrids. It was felt that
attempts to fuse this line with human ES lines might prove more productive than
continuing with the hES experiments.
Prior to the using PEG in fusion experiments, the effect of duration of PEG
exposure on the viability of cells used for the fusions was investigated [Fig 9.4
overleaf]. Exposing TGI l.nR or H9 cells to PEG for up to 4 minutes did not affect
cell viability and this duration was used in subsequent fusion experiments. TGI l.nR
cells (and Soc2 cells) were cultured in conditioned hES medium supplemented with
LIF for 3 passages prior to fusion experiments. This was done to prevent H9 cells
being exposed to serum from the murine ES medium which would cause the
differentiation of H9 cells. Twenty four hours after fusion, selection for cell hybrids
was applied (selection medium consisted of conditioned human ES medium
supplemented with 1,000U / ml LIF, 1% non essential amino acids, lxHAT and 300
pg / ml G418). Despite three attempts however, where 5x107 TGI l.nR cells were
added to a confluent T175 flask of H9 cells and induced to fuse by exposing the cells
to PEG for 4 minutes (an exposure time which was not toxic to the H9 cells [Fig 9.4
(overleaf)], no hybrid colonies were generated.
Two attempts were made to generate cell hybrids by fusing H9 cells and
Socs2 cells. Socs2 cells were similar to TGI l.nR in that they are HAT sensitive and
neomycin resistant but they were murine ES cells. 5xl07 Socs2 cells were applied to
T175 flasks confluent with H9 cells and selected in a similar manner to the previous
experiments. Again no hybrid colonies were generated. The cells were exposed to
PEG for 4 minutes, a duration that did not significantly reduce viability of Socs2
cells (Fig 9.4).
As these experiments were being completed, Ray Ansell and Jim McWhir
successfully generated viable single cell suspensions of H9 cells using a TEG
disaggregation protocol. One could now use electrofusion to attempt to generate cell
hybrids from ES cells and so the PEG experiments were deprioritised. Had they not
been, a longer PEG exposure time would have been used (8 min) to induce fusion.
Duration of PEG exposure (min)
Figure 9.4 Duration of PEG exposure affects viability of H9, Socs2 and
TGll.nR cells
Cells were exposed to PEG for a range of durations (0, 2, 4, and 8 min) and their
viability was assessed. Cells from the used media and all post-trypsinisation
washings were combined and pelleted before being washed and resuspended in
lxPBS. Cell viability (as % of total cells) was measured for H9 (--), Socs2 (-) and
TGI l.nR (-*-) cells using Forward Scatter/Side Scatter FACS analysis as outlined in
Section [12.2], The graph shows mean cell viability (as percentage of all cells) for
each cell line at each time interval  S.E.M.
Using standard electrofusion conditions, two attempts at generating fusion
from H9 and TGI l.nR, and then from Socs2 cells again failed to generate hybrids. It
was decided to use 2-dye FACS analysis to investigate where lack of fusion was the
reason for the failure to generate cell hybrids from H9 cells.
[9.3.3] Under a range of conditions human ES cells are less fusable than their
murine counterparts
After the failure of several experiments to generate hybrid colonies from
human ES or EC cells (outlined in Subsection [9.3.2]), a series of 2-dye FACS
analysis experiments was performed to assess fusion of H9 cells under the conditions
used. The human ES line was found to be less fusable than its murine counterpart.
Fig 9.5 shows only 2.01 0.10% of all viable H9 cells generated homokaryons when
induced to fuse using standard murine electrofusion conditions (n=2). This is a
smaller percentage than that seen in similar experiment using HM-1 cells Fig 3.3
shows that 12.4% of viable HM-1 cells formed homokaryons (Fig 3.3).
Subsequently a range of different electrofusion conditions was tested to
identify optimal conditions for fusing H9 cells [Fig 9.6], Single or double pulses with
    7
voltages ranging from 200-800V were applied to 0.2cm cuvettes, each containing 10
CMTMR stained H9 cells and 107 CMFDA stained H9 cells suspended in 0.3M
mannitol buffer (280mOs). The optimal fusion conditions were found to be those
used in previous experiments (i.e. 300V, single pulse).

percentage of gated cells fusing for each condition (shown in red underneath the

stained in the leakage control from that of the electrofusion treatment. The data is
taken from one of three replicate experiments.
As PEG and electrofusion had failed to induce fusion at a frequency needed
to produce hybrid colonies, it was decided to try a different fusagen, the Sendai virus.
This virus contains two proteins on its coat (haemagluttinin neuraminidase (HN)
protein and F glycoprotein) that induce membrane fusion [Bousse et al. 1994] This
viral had been used to fuse both human and mouse somatic cells for many years
[Harris et al. 1965] (See Section [2.2.3] for more details). Experiments in which
either stained HM-1 cells or stained H9 cells were exposed to Sendai virus
suspension (7,500 HAU / ml) for 30 minutes were carried out. After viral exposure,
cells were seeded on matrigel-treated plates and incubated for 10 hours in
conditioned human ES medium prior to measuring homokaryon formation using 2-
dye FACS analysis. Only 0.01% of the H9 cells formed homokaryons when exposed
to the viral fusagen but 4.42% of HM-1 cells did in the control [Fig 9.7 overleaf].
Again it seemed human ES cells were less fusable than murine ES cells.

considerably lower than that seen with HM-1 cells. It was hypothesised that the
reason for this may be the matrix on which human ES cells was being grown, i.e.
Matrigel. Whether matrigel inhibits fusion was tested using HM-1 cells grown either
gelatin or matrigel.

Fig 9.8 shows that matrigel did not inhibit fusion of HM-1 cells. Percentages of cell
fusion for both HM-1 cells grown on gelatin or matrigel were not significantly
different (14.1% versus 14.2%). Thus this was probably not the problem with H9
cells either.
[9.3.5] H9 cell fusion increases five fold after hyaluronidase
treatment
No evidence was found which indicated that growing the cells on matrigel
inhibited fusion of H9 cells. Now the hypothesis that the cells own natural
extracellular matrix was inhibiting fusion was tested. Many embryonic tissues have
an extracellular matrix of which hyaluronic acid is a major component [Caplan
2003]. It was decided to investigate whether enzymatic cleavage of this component
using hyaluronidase would breakdown the cells own extracellular matrix and
facilitate fusion [See Subsection 1.8.3], Ohno-Shosaku and Okada (1984) refers to
experiments where pronase had successfully been used to increase mouse cell hybrid
yield. Pronase cleaved cell surface glycoproteins, increasing membrane-membrane
interaction which was thought to cause the resultant increase in yield of hybrid
colonies.
First an experiment was carried out to investigate whether hyaluronidase
broke down the ECM of H9 cells. As hyaluronan is itself non-immunogenic, control
and hyaluronidase treated H9 cells were stained for hyaluronidase binding protein.
Fig 9.9 (overleaf) shows data suggesting that hyaluronidase treatment removes the
hyaluronan based extracellular matrix from H9 cells. Treatment with hyaluronidase
reduces the binding of this protein to H9 cells, indicating that hyaluronan-based
ECM has been broken down.

Control and hyaluronidase treated H9 cells were immunostained with a FITC
labelled antibody raised to hyaluronan (as described in Section [2.4.3]), Green
fluorescence spectra of unstained H9 cells (), control immunostained H9 cells ()
and hyaluronidase immunostained H9 cells () were overlaid. After the cells are
treated with hyaluronidase, there is bandshift to the left, showing that much less
hyaluronan binding protein is binding to the cells. This strongly suggests that the
hyaluronan-based extra cellular matrix of the cells has been broken down by
hyaluronidase.
Experiments were carried out where control and hyaluronidase treated H9
cells were electrofused under standard conditions. Again 2-dye FACS analysis was
used to assess homokaryon formation. Fig 9.10 (overleaf) shows that hyaluronidase
treatment also repeatedly increased electrofusion of H9 cells. On average the
hyaluronidase increased fusion five fold over control levels (5.370.38% versus
1.050.06%, n=3). It seems probable that the hyaluronan-based extra cellular matrix
produced by H9 cells was inhibiting higher levels of fusion in previous experiments.

[9.4] Conclusion
Selectable lines were generated to allow the isolation of human cell hybrids
derived from heterokaryons was generated. Attempts to generate hprt deficient hEC
subclones using 6-TG selection failed. FISH analysis of NTERA-2 mitotic spreads
revealed abnormal duplication of segments of the X-chromosome which could
account for the failure to generate colonies.
Attempts to generate cell hybrids from somatic fusions with either hEC and
hES cells failed. Early hES experiments used PEG as a fusagen because H9 cells
were not viable in single cell suspension when disaggregated with collagenase. It was
later discovered that TEG disaggregation of H9 cells could generate a viable single
cell suspension, and electrofusion experiments were attempted. These also failed to
generate hybrid colonies.
Two-dye FACS analysis revealed that human ES and EC cells were less
fusable than their murine counterparts under the conditions used. Attempts to
optimise conditions for H9 cell fusion showed that the artificial matrix matrigel on
which the cells were cultured did not inhibit cell fusion. The most probable reason
for failure to generate cell hybrids was that the degree of fusion was insufficient to
generate hybrids from the cell numbers used. Breakdown of the native ECM of H9
cells with hyaluronidase increased the level of fusion five fold. Such treatment
should be used in future attempts to generate cell hybrids from H9 cells.
[10] General discussion and conclusions
Use of the cell hybrid system for studying nuclear reprogramming
Murine somatic nuclei can be epigenetically reprogrammed by factors present
in murine Embryonic Stem cells [Tada et al. 2002][Matveeva et al. 1998].
Hybridising murine ES cells with somatic cells alters somatic chromatin structure
causing major changes both in patterns of global DNA methylation [Tada et al.
2002] and in gene expression [Tada et al. 2002][Matveeva et al. 1998]. Functionally,
the hybrid cells are pluripotent highlighting extensive reprogramming of the somatic
chromatin has taken place [Tada et al. 2002][Matveeva et al. 1998], The work
described in this thesis sought to identify factors that affect such reprogramming. To
do this, a system for consistently generating large numbers of hybrid colonies from
fusions of murine ES cells and somatic cells was developed and optimised. ES cell
hybrids were successfully generated from two somatic cell types: thymocytes and
fibroblasts. To the best knowledge of the student, work described in Chapter 3,
where murine ES cells and primary embryonic fibroblasts were hybridised, is the
first report of generating such hybrids from a somatic cell type that can be grown in
culture. It is also the first example of ES cell hybrid generation where ES cell hybrids
can display either murine ES cell or also in theory somatic cell phenotypes and
remain viable in hybrid selection conditions. Although similar experiments fusing
with EC cells could generate hybrids with either phenotype (as reviewed in
Subsection [1.8.3.2]), work described in this thesis shows that murine ES x PEF
hybrid cells only ever displayed a murine ES cell morphology, even when Oct"e0/Octe?o
somatic cells and selection for reprogramming with G418 were not used. This
suggests that the ES cell phenotype is dominant over the somatic cell phenotype.
Hybrid cells generated by fusing HM-1 cells with somatic cells (either
thymocytes or fibroblasts) were morphologically indistinguishable from HM-1 cells
and phenotypic characteristics assessed in the hybrids cells were similar to those
observed in HM-1 cells but not in their somatic fusion partners. Both in vitro and in
vivo studies showed that such hybrid cells were pluripotent. These data, outlined in
Chapter 4, are similar to those previously described in the literature where
thymocytes [Tada et al. 2002] and splenocytes [Matveeva et al. 1998] were used as
somatic fusion partners to generate ES cell hybrids.
Whether ES phenotypic dominance within these hybrid cells is complete is
still unknown. Andrews and Goodfellow (1980) fused murine EC (PCC4azaR) cells
with thymocytes and resultant hybrid cells still expressed differentiated cell marker
H-2Kk. This shows that reprogramming to an EC phenotype was not complete (even
though these hybrid cells were still pluripotent as assessed by tumour generation in
SCID mice). Incomplete change in gene expression profiles in these hybrid cells may
be just a consequence of EC cell genomic instability but the extent to which murine
ES cell-specific genes are expressed and somatic cell-specific genes are repressed
requires further analysis in order to understand the extent of reprogramming that has
taken place. Microarray technology, for example, could be used to assess the
transcripton levels ofmany ES cell specific and somatic cell specific genes in hybrid
cells.
The cell hybrid system was used to investigate the effect of different
treatments on nuclear reprogramming. This system was chosen because ES cells
contain little cytoplasm, making nuclear transfer or cytoplasm incubations
technically very difficult to carry out. Use of this system has both benefits and
limitations for the study of nuclear reprogramming. In addition to being technically
simpler than either nuclear transfer [Campbell 1999] or cytoplasmic incubation
[Hakelien et al. 2002], it quickly generates large amounts of reproducible data. The
system not only allows the effects of broad treatments (such as heat shock,
confluence and serum starvation) on nuclear reprogramming, but also allows the
effect of transient expression of specific transgenes to be studied. This approach was
exemplified in Chapter 8, where the Tet-On inducible gene expression system was
used to transiently express nuclear chaperone Xenopus nucleoplasmin in the hybrid
system.
Unlike nuclear transfer and cytoplasmic incubations however, the nucleus of
the reprogramming cell are still present. Only cytoplasmic factors are required to
direct complete reprogramming of mammalian nuclei as shown by nuclear transfer
[Wilmut et al. 1997] and one could argue that the presence of ES cell chromatin and
associated nuclear components might directly influence reprogramming of somatic
chromatin.
A novel approach was developed and used in this thesis to assess the nuclear
reprogramming activities of ES cell population. Two-dye FACS analysis was used to
measure the fraction of viable cells forming heterokaryons. Hybridisation
frequencies, calculated by dividing the number of hybrid colonies by the number of
viable heterokaryons, were used a measure of the frequency of nuclear
reprogramming. Ideally however, the total number of viable hybrid cells could have
been measured at the onset of selection for reprogramming. The proportion of
successfully reprogrammed hybrid cells could then be directly calculated providing a
direct measure of nuclear reprogramming. This was not possible as non-toxic
nucleus-specific probes were not available. If they had been, nuclei of ES cells and
somatic cells would have been labeled with different probes and analysised to
determine the number of hybrid cells, rather than the number of heterokaryons. It is
probable however that one would not be able to discriminate accurately between
viable hybrid cells and heterokaryons because of the cytoplasm surrounding the
nuclei. One would also be unable to control for probe leakage meaning an
overestimation of the number of hybrid cells would be made.
As heterokaryons are not viable in culture for longer than a few hours [Blau
and Blakely 1999], this cell hybrid system requires nuclear fusion of the ES and
somatic nuclei. For hybridisation frequencies (hybrid / heterokaryon) to be an
accurate measure of the incidence of nuclear reprogramming, the rate of nuclear
fusion in heterokaryons will be relatively constant between different treatments in
experiments.
Nuclear fusion does seem to be relatively constant in hybrid generating
experiments where cells are treated similarly (e.g. under standard conditions
experiments electrofusing HM-1 cells and thymocytes consistently produced one
viable cell hybrid for every -4,000 viable heterokaryons). This however does not
argue that nuclear fusion is constant in heterokaryons derived from cells that have
been treated differently. Very little is known about factors affecting nuclear fusion so
it is not yet possible to assess how much nuclear fusion will vary with different cell
treatments.
The serum starvation data presented in Chapter 7 suggests that nuclear
fusion is relatively constant and that hybridisation frequency (hybrid / heterokaryon)
is actually a good measure of reprogramming (at least in this case). These data are
similar to nuclear transfer data in that nuclei of serum starved primary embryonic
cells underwent nuclear reprogramming more frequently [Campbell et al.
1996] [Campbell 1999]. However more needs to be done to investigate whether
nuclear fusion is relatively constant where cells have been differentially treated in
other ways (e.g. growing cells to different levels of confluence).
Cellular stress and nuclear reprogramming
In Chapter 5, the effect of heat shocking somatic cells prior to fusion with ES cells
was tested. It was hypothesised that disruption of higher chromatin structure at
hyperthermic temperatures would make the somatic cell more amenable to being
reprogrammed by the ES cell. Heat shocking thymocytes to 42C for 10 min prior to
fusion increased not only hybrid colony yield (84.616.9% increase over control
yields) but also heterokaryon formation (395% increase over control levels). The
data from five replicate experiments were not enough to assess whether the increase
in hybrid colony yield could be accounted for solely by increased heterokaryon
formation or whether an increase in the frequency of nuclear reprogramming had
also taken place. Thus nothing could be concluded about whether heat shocking
thymocytes prior to fusion affected reprogramming of the thymocytes. Just after this
work was completed, Loi et al. (2002) published data showing that heat shocking
granulosa cells at either 55C and 75C prior to injecting their nuclei into enucleated
metaphase II oocytes increased the number of reconstructed embryos developing to
blastocyst stage and beyond. Their data also shows that exposing granulosa cells to
such non-physiological temperature destabilised higher orders of chromatin
structures. Thus, some evidence for the hypothesis being tested in Chapter 5 now
exists. Unfortunately application of Loi et a/.'s heat shock conditions to thymocytes
before cell fusion only caused lysis and cell clumping so similar experiments using
the cell hybrid system could not be carried out.
Experiments where HM-1 cells and thymocytes were heat shocked at 42C
for 10 min after being fused caused a decrease in hybridisation frequencies (hybrid /
heterokaryon). In samples that were heat shocked between 1 and 12 hours after
electropulsing, cell viability and heterokaryon formation were relatively constant
between samples, while hybrid yield gradually increased. Thus, heat shocking cells
after fusion only resulted in a decreased hybridisation frequencies. This suggests that
such post-fusion treatment impairs rather than assists reprogramming of thymocyte
nuclei. As ES cell components are also being heat shocked here, one possible
explanation is that reprogramming factors present in the ES cell are sensitive to the
heat shock treatment. The later the heat shock is after cell fusion, the more hybrids
will have already been successfully reprogrammed. One might test this hypothesis by
heat shocking the HM-1 cells prior to fusion with thymocytes and observing the
resultant hybridisation frequencies (hybrid / heterokaryon). If ES cell derived
reprogramming factors are sensitive to heat shocking, one would expect a decrease in
hybridisation frequencies. However, analysis of data from such an experiment is
likely to have the same problems associated with increased heterokaryon formation
as pre-fusion heat shock experiments.
If one assumes that reprogramming factors are sensitive to stresses such as
heat shock, one might expect that the more stressed an ES cell is, the less
reprogramming capacity it is likely to have. Data shown in Chapter 6 do not seem to
support this view. As HM-1 cells approach confluence, and more stressed they
become (as measured by Hsp72 induction) and yet the greater the nuclear
reprogramming capacity they appear to have. One possibility is that ifHM-1 cells are
stressed and allowed to express significant levels of heat shock proteins, they are
more likely to reprogram somatic nuclei successfully. In the case of heat shocking
after HM-1 cells and thymocytes have fused, heat shock protein expression may not
be induced to sufficient levels quickly enough to have an effect on reprogramming.
As HM-1 cells approach confluence, the more they express heat shock
proteins (including Hsp72 as measured here in Fig 6.8). Many heat shock proteins
act as chaperones repairing misfolded protein and RNA which are denatured as a
consequence of stress. The higher the expression of such proteins, the quicker
denatured proteins and RNA will be refolded correctly, and the greater the
probability of the cell withstanding further stress. Hsp72 levels [Fig 6.8] and
hybridisation frequencies [Fig 6.6] both increase as HM-1 cells approach confluence.
It is possible that nuclear reprogramming is assisted by the expression of such
proteins (by correcting denaturation of chromatin remodeling complexes for
example). If this is true, one would expect that moderately stressing either fusion
partner in a fusion experiment and allowing heat shock proteins to be induced would
result is increased nuclear reprogramming. In Chapter 7, where PEFs are serum
starved to induce quiescence, these somatic cells are also stressed by this treatment
and induce Hsp72 strongly [Fig 7.2]. The hybridisation frequencies (hybrid /
heterokaryon) of experiments where serum starved controls were used were 5311
fold higher than in control experiments.
Considering both the data described in Chapter 6 and data generated by Gao
et al. 2003, it seems that reprogramming both by and ofHM-1 cells is affected by
HM-1 cell confluence. These observations are consistent with the heat shock protein
hypothesis, where stress induction of such factors in either the cell doing the
reprogramming or the cell being reprogrammed would increase nuclear
reprogramming.
It is important to bear in mind however, that these observations only correlate
induction of the stress response and increases in nuclear reprogramming and do not
show a direct effect. More evidence will be needed before this hypothesis is taken
seriously. There will be major difficulties in testing this hypothesis given the range
of heat shock proteins.
Changes in the cell cycle and nuclear reprogramming
In Chapters 6 and 7 respectively, the cell cycle characteristics of HM-1 cells
approaching confluence and serum starved primary embryonic fibroblasts were
investigated to see if there was any relationship between cell cycle and nuclear
reprogramming. In the case of HM-1 cells grown to different levels of confluence,
the mean proportions of cells at different stages of the cell cycle changed as follows:
the proportion in G1 dropped from 32.8% to 11.9%, the proportion in S remained
unchanged and the proportion in G2/M rose 18.4% to 41.1%. Assuming that cell
cycle characteristics are directly influencing nuclear reprogramming, HM-1 cells in
G1 seem less efficient at reprogramming thymocytes or HM-1 cells in G2/M seem to
be more efficient. This could be due to different levels of the putative
reprogramming factor MPF, which is expressed at low levels in G1 cells and at high
levels in G2/M cells [Murray & Hunt 1993]. This could be tested by expressing MPF
in the somatic cell line prior to fusion. Recently published bovine nuclear transfer
work however shows no correlation between MPF levels and nuclear reprogramming
[Tani et al. 2003]. An alternative explanation could be that as HM-1 cells in G2/M
phases have duplicated cytoplasmic components in preparation for cell division, and
such cells consequently may contain more reprogramming factors. When fused to
somatic cells, they may have a greater capacity to reprogram these cells. This
hypothesis could be tested by fusing HM-1 cells to form HM-lxHM-1 hybrid cells
and then fusing these cells to somatic cells so see if there is an increase in
hybridisation frequency.
In chapter 7, the cell cycle characteristics of the cells to be reprogrammed
were assessed. When primary embryonic fibroblasts were serum starved, the
proportion of cells in G1/G0 phases increased (53.7% to 73.0%), that in S phase
decreased (8.6% to 2.7%) and that in G2/M phases decreased from 37.7% to 24.3%
[Fig 7.4]. Experiments using serum starved PEFs produced significantly higher
hybridisation frequencies indicating that they were more amenable to being
reprogrammed than control fibroblasts. Since these PEFs were shown to be in a
quiescent state, such an increase in nuclear reprogramming is consistent with
Campbell's hypothesis that quiescent nuclei are more amenable to being
reprogrammed. However, in the final experiment ofChapter 7, fusions using serum
reactivated PEFs displayed an elevated hybrid colony yield even though the cells
were no longer quiescent. Obviously, no conclusion can be drawn from only one
experiment but should these data be repeatable, it might suggest that some
characteristic of serum starved PEFs other than their quiescent state make them more
easily reprogrammed. It is surprising similar experiments have not been previously
done in the nuclear transfer system given the controversy surrounding the role of
quiescence in nuclear reprogramming.
Role of specific genes in nuclear reprogramming
The murine cell hybrid system developed here allowed the effect of expression of a
specific transgene on nuclear reprogramming to be studied. In Chapter 8, the effects
of constitutive and transient expression ofXenopus nucleoplasmin on reprogramming
in the cell hybrid system were studied. Unfortunately the levels at which
nucleoplasmin were expressed proved toxic to HM-1 cells, and had time permitted,
the effect of lower expression levels would have been tested. As this work was being
completed, Byrne et al. 2003 published data showing that transferring murine
thymocyte nuclei in Xenopus oocytes reprogrammed the nuclei such that they began
to express the pluripotent cell specific transcription factor Oct-4. As Xenopus oocytes
express nucleoplasmin at very high levels (constituting 9-10% of all protein
produced by the cell [Krohne & Franke 1980]), there is even more justification to
continue this line of investigation in the hybrid system.
Had more time been available, Xenopus nucleoplasmin would have been
expressed in the somatic fusion partner rather than ES cell prior to fusion. A suitable
somatic cell line would have been chosen and stably transfected with both pTNG and
pTetNPM. A clone appropriately expressing nucleoplasmin inducibly in response to
doxycycline addition would have been used in experiments where various levels of
nucleoplasmin expression induced in somatic cells prior to fusion with HM-1 cells.
Inducing nucleoplasmin expression after cell fusion would also have been tested.
Thus by transiently expressing nucleoplasmin at different levels and at different time
points, the effect of nucleoplasmin expression on reprogramming of the somatic
nucleus would be further investigated.
Difficulties overcome in attempts to develop a human ES cell hybridisation
system
Several steps were made toward developing a human ES cell hybrid system to study
reprogramming. In collaboration with others, selectable human ES cell lines have
now been produced and fusion with other cell types was measured. Human ES cells
were less fusable with other cell types than their murine counterparts even when a
range of conditions and fusagens (electropulsing, PEG and Sendai' virus) were used.
Establishing that breaking down the native extracellular matrix of human ES cells
facilitates cell fusion is an important step toward generating hybrids from human ES
cells. Whether hyaluronidase treatment of hES cells also increases lipofection
efficiencies should also be investigated.
In future attempts to generate hybrids from human ES cells, it would be
advisable to use low passage cells given that human ES cells may also lose their
capacity to reprogram somatic cells when they reach high passage number, as murine
ES cells have been shown to do (Fig 6,9). Had time permitted, a selectable human
somatic cell line would have developed and experiments fusing hyaluronidase-
treated human ES cells with these selectable human somatic cells would have been
attempted. It would have been interesting to see whether human ES cells were
phenotypically dominant over human somatic cells and whether or not resultant
hybrid cells were pluripotent. Generation of such a human ES hybrid system will in
the future provide the opportunity to identify factors necessary for reprogramming
human somatic cells to a pluripotent state.

[12.2] OPTIMISING INSTRUMENT ELECTRONICS FOR FACS ANALYSIS
Full details of optimising instrument settings for FACS analysis is given in DB
Biosciences Software Users Guide Chapter 4. A brief summary is presented here to
help readers unfamiliar with FACS analysis understand how the graphs and
histograms in the text were generated.
ADJUSTMENT OF FORWARD SCATTER (FSC) AND SIDE SCATTER
(SSC) SETTINGS
First the FSC Amp gain, SSC Voltage were adjusted so the scatter properties of the
sample are clearly displayed. In any cell sample there will be two populations: living
cells will be seen as large grouping of cells with a varied cell size and complexity.
Dead cells will be a smaller less complex population. This is done by adjusting the
FSC AMP gain and SSC voltage settings.

Fig 12.1 Forward Scatter (FSC) Amp gain, Side Scatter (SSC) Voltage
adjustment allows gating of live cells from dead cells
In A, the FSC AMP gain is set too high, in B it is set too low. Decreasing the AMP
gain moves the cells to the right and increasing it moves it to the felt. In C SSC
voltage is set to low and in D it is set too high. Decreasing the SSC voltage is too
high and in D it is too low. Decreasing the SSC voltage moves the cells down and
increasing them up. E shows a properly adjusted FSC/SSC plot.
ADJUSTMENT OF FLUORESCENCE DETECTORS
In order to insure that the FACS machine can register fluorescent cells, its important
that the fluorescence peaks of non-fluorescent controls lie just above the minimum
fluorescent limit that the FACS machine registers. This is done by adjusting the
voltage setting for fluorescent channels.
Fig 12.2 Forward Scatter (FSC) adjustment of the fluorescence detectors
A shows FL1 voltage set too high, and B shows it too low. Decreasing FL1 voltage
will move the peak to the left and increasing it will move the peak to the right. C
shows a properly adjusted histogram for negatively control cells. The FACS machine
will be able to register cells up to a 1000 times greater than the negatively controlled
cells while still registering unstained cells.
ADJUSTING FLUORESCENCE COMPENSATION
Compensation are used to adjust for spectral overlap. For 2-dye FACS
anaylsis, mixtures of stained but unpulsed cells were used to insure that CMTMR
stained cells were misidentified as CMFDA stained cells. The FL1-%FL2 setting was
increased until both populations of stained cells were clearly distinct from each other
and in each fluorescence spectrum peaks were distinct from each other. If the cells
are not properly compensated, CMFDA cells can be misidentified as CMTMR cells
due to spectral overlap. If cells are properly compensated, mixtures of stained cells
appear as two distinct cell populations on FL1/FL2 histograms (See Fig 12.3).
