Summary
This thesis concerns the study of the neutron transport equation, which describes how neutrons
move through a fissile medium, such as a nuclear reactor. By studying various stochastic pro-
cesses that model the behaviour of these neutrons, we address some of the criticality problems
associated with such systems.
We first build a class of branching processes, whose behaviour mimics that of neutrons
undergoing fission in a nuclear reactor. We then construct a class of weighted random walks,
which are in some sense equivalent to the branching processes via a many-to-one formula. Anal-
ysis of these two processes allows us to characterise the long-term behaviour of the underlying
nuclear fission processes.
One of the parameters associated with characterising this asymptotic behaviour quantifies
the average growth of particle numbers. A large part of this thesis is dedicated to what is known
as the supercritical phase, which is where the average number of particles grows exponentially.
In this regime, we consider both a spine and skeletal decomposition of the branching process in
order to further describe the growth of the system through a law of large numbers result.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The Neutron Transport Equation (NTE) is used to model the movement of neutrons in fissile
environments. This thesis concerns the development of probabilistic methods for studying the
NTE in order to characterise the growth of such systems. We begin this chapter by describing
some of the physics that governs the movement of neutrons in these environments.
1.1 The physical process
The neutron transport equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons in an inhomogeneous
fissile medium, such as a nuclear reactor. It can be described as a function of time, t, Euclidian
location, r  R3, direction of travel,   S2, and neutron energy, E  (0,). However, it
is usual to assume that energy is a function of velocity (E = m||2/2), thereby reducing the
number of variables by one. This allows us to describe the dependency of flux more simply in
terms of time and the configuration variables (r, )  D  V where D  R3 is a smooth, open,
connected and bounded domain1 such that D has zero Lebesgue measure and V is the set of
admissible velocities, given by V = {v  R3 : min < |v| < max}, where 0 < min < max <.
In order to describe the evolution of the flux, we describe the main processes that dictate
how neutrons move in their domain.
1.1.1 Transport
The system is started from an initial source term, denoted Q(r, , t), with t = 0, r  D and
  V . After this, a neutron with initial configuration (r, ) will move along the trajectory
(r + s, ), s  0, until it either hits the boundary of the reactor, at which point it is absorbed
and no longer tracked, or either a scattering or fission event occurs, which we describe below. We
note that in some radiation transport systems, the source term continues to contribute particles
to the system throughout the whole process, however in most fissile media, the source term is
neglected after a fixed period of time since the subsequent fission overwhelms this term.
1We will later impose further assumptions on the domain. We note that in the literature, infinite domains
have also been considered.
1.1.2 Scattering
A scattering event occurs when a neutron collides with a nucleus in the reactor and then
bounces off, continuing to move in a straight line but with a new velocity. There are two
main types of scattering, which we briefly describe.
Elastic scattering
This is the most common type of scattering. It occurs when the total energy involved in the
scattering event is conserved, i.e. the nucleus involved in the collision gains precisely the amount
of energy lost by the colliding neutron. In fact, elastic scattering can be further subdivided
into compound and potential elastic scattering, depending on whether the incident neutron is
absorbed by the nucleus or just comes into close proximity with it during the scattering event.
Inelastic scattering
Inelastic scattering only occurs when the energy of the colliding neutron is sufficiently high. In
this case, the nucleus initially absorbs the energy lost by the colliding nucleus but it is left in
an excited state. In order to return to stability, it releases energy in the form of gamma rays,
so that the total energy of the neutron and nucleus after the collision is less than the energy
beforehand.
In this thesis, we will not distinghuish between the different types of scattering. However,
the models we consider are general enough to allow a distinction to be made if necessary.
1.1.3 Fission
Roughly speaking, nuclear fission occurs when a neutron collides with a nucleus, which then
causes the nucleus to release several more neutrons. Initially, the incident neutron is absorbed
by the nucleus, which results in the nucleus becoming excited or unstable. In order to return
to its ground state, the nucleus splits open and releases surplus neutrons. However, not all
neutrons are released from the nucleus at the same time, which leads us to the following two
categories of fission neutrons.
Prompt neutrons
Neutrons that are released immediately (on a time scale of about 1014 seconds) from a fission
event are called prompt neutrons. Most of the neutron yield (about 99%) from fission events is
made up of prompt neutrons, with the average yield of such neutrons being between two and
three per fission event.
Delayed neutrons
When the excited nucleus splits open and releases prompt neutrons, the remaining fragments
from the nucleus may still be in an excited state. These fragments are called delayed neutron
precursors and after some time, they release further neutrons, called delayed neutrons, in order
to become stable again. Although delayed neutrons constitute a much lower proportion of the
total yield from a fission event, they are very important in the design and safety of nuclear
reactors. The time taken to release these neutrons can be anything from a few seconds to a
minute, which is enough time to allow procedures to be put in place to absorb surplus neutrons
in the case where too many are being produced, i.e. when the reactor is in a supercritical state.
It is possible that when a neutron is absorbed by a nucleus in a fission event, the resulting
nucleus remains in a stable state. In this case, the nucleus will not release any neutrons, and we
refer to this possibility as neutron capture or absorption. In the literature, capture and fission
are often considered as two separate events; however it is not uncommon to consider absorption
to be a fission event with zero offspring.
Although we have only described the behaviour of neutrons, there are several other types
of particles involved in fission processes, such as gamma rays and alpha particles. Models that
include these other various types of particles shall be discussed in Chapter 2.
1.2 Neutron Transport Equation
Based on the above dynamics, we are now in a position to write down the neutron transport
equation. For now, we will only consider prompt neutrons, and as previously mentioned, we do
not make a distinction between the different types of scattering.
1.2.1 Forwards equation
For t  0, we denote the neutron flux at time t by t : D  V  [0,). By considering the
dynamics described above and balancing neutron production and loss, one can show, at least
heuristically, that it solves the integro-differential equation, also known as the forward neutron
transport equation2,
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, )
t(r, 
)s(r, 
)s(r, 
, )d +
t(r, 
)f(r, 
)f(r, 
, )d, (1.1)
2Here and everywhere else in this thesis,  is the gradient operator with respect to the variable r  R3.
where the different components (or cross-sections as they are known in the physics literature)
have the following interpretation:
s(r, 
) : the rate at which scattering occurs from incoming velocity ,
f(r, 
) : the rate at which fission occurs from incoming velocity ,
(r, ) : the sum of the rates f + s, also known as the total cross section
s(r, 
, )d : the scattering yield at velocity  from incoming velocity ,
satisfying
s(r, , 
)d = 1,
f(r, 
, )d : the neutron yield at velocity  from fission with incoming velocity ,
satisfying
f(r, , 
)d <.
It is also natural to consider the following boundary conditions.
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr < 0,
(1.2)
where nr is the outward facing normal of D at r  D and g : D  V  [0,) is a bounded,
measurable function. Heuristically, the forwards equation and corresponding boundary condi-
tions describe possible previous configurations of neutrons in the reactor in order to achieve the
current configuration.
The forwards equation is also sometimes written including the source term Q, which
continually produces neutrons while the reactor is running. In the presence of a source term,
the initial data is taken to be g = Q. However, as we will only be considering fissile systems, we
have set Q = 0, as the resulting fission will overwhelm the radioactive source term.
1.2.2 Backwards equation
Although the forwards equation is the most common form of the NTE in the physics and
engineering literature, there is another, related, equation, called the backwards equation, which
also describes the flux of neutrons in fissile systems, and is given by
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, )
+ s(r, )
t(r, 
)s(r, , 
)d + f(r, )
t(r, 
)f(r, , 
)d, (1.3)
with additional boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr > 0.
(1.4)
The backwards equation is also known as the adjoint equation since it is the adjoint (in the sense
of operator adjoint) of the forwards equation. It describes where the system could evolve to,
given the current configuration. Accordingly, the boundary conditions state that neutrons that
hit the boundary of the domain with outgoing velocity are killed and do not contribute to the
system after this time. We will discuss the relationship between the forwards and backwards
equations, and their respective boundary conditions, in more detail in Chapter 2.
1.3 Criticality problems
One of the principal ways in which neutron flux is understood is to look for the leading eigenvalue
and associated ground state eigenfunction. From the perspective of nuclear engineers, this
corresponds to determining the average growth rate of the number of neutrons in the system,
and a heat map to describe the reactivity profile throughout the reactor. However, there are
a variety of different eigenvalue problems associated with the NTE, each leading to a slightly
different measure of criticality.
-eigenvalue
The -, or time-dependent, eigenvalue problem involves finding the largest  such that there
exists a function  satisfying
  (r, ) (r, )(r, ) + s(r, )
(r, )s(r, , 
)d
+ f(r, )
(r, )f(r, , 
)d = (r, ). (1.5)
Setting  to be zero in the above equation would indicate a perfect balance between neutron
production and absorption. Hence,  quantifies the imbalance between these two processes,
which yields one notion of criticality. In this situation, we have the following regimes:
 > 0 supercritical,
 = 0 critical,
 < 0 subcritical.
Moreover, the eigenfunction , also called the importance map in the physics literature, gives a
profile of the hot spots in the reactor. In other words, it describes where the fission activity is
most prevalent.
This eigenvalue problem has been considered predominantly in the mathematics literature
from a number of perspectives. For example, the works [15, 11] consider this eigenvalue problem
from an analytical perspective, while a probabilistic point of view is taken in [16, 12].
k-eigenvalue
The k-eigenvalue problem is a time-independent, or stationary, problem. It corresponds to
finding a value k > 0 (commonly referred to as keff) and a function eff such that
  eff(r, ) (r, )eff(r, ) + s(r, )
eff(r, 
)s(r, , 
)d
f(r, )
eff(r, 
)f(r, , 
)d. (1.6)
In this case, k = 1 corresponds to a perfectly balanced system, and in fact, it can be shown that
this occurs precisely when  = 0 in the time-dependent problem. In this case, the eigenfunctions
 and eff are equal. However, more generally, k can be interpreted as a measure of the average
number of neutrons produced from one generation to the next and so, dividing the fission
operator by this quantity reestablishes the balance between fission and absorption. Due to this
interpretation, k is also used as a measure of criticality, which, in this problem, is categorised
as follows:
k > 1 supercritical,
k = 1 critical,
k < 1 subcritical.
This eigenvalue problem is the main focus of criticality calculations in industry [3], and has
received much attention from the numerical analysis community [10, 17].
It is worth mentioning that this categorisation of criticality is very basic. There is a finer
level of classification that takes delayed neutrons into account. For this, we introduce two more
parameters, eff , which is the average number of delayed neutrons produced per fission event,
and  = (k  1)/k, a measure of reactivity of the reactor. We then have the following regimes:
 Prompt critical: k > 1;  > eff .
The average number of prompt neutrons produced is greater than one and the reactivity
of the reactor is higher than the average number of delayed neutrons produced at each
fission event. In this case, the number of neutrons is increasing on the same time scale
as the production of prompt neutrons. Since this happens very quickly, a system in this
regime is highly unstable. For example, this is the situation one would need in order to
create a nuclear bomb.
 Prompt subcritical, delayed supercritical: k > 1; 0 <  < eff .
Again, the average number of prompt neutrons produced is greater than one, however, in
this case it is not these types of neutrons that cause the supercritical state. Of course, the
average number of neutrons is still increasing but now on the time scale of delayed neutron
production, and it is these latter neutrons that sustain the nuclear reactor and maintain
the supercritical state.
 Prompt subcritical, delayed critical: k = 1;  = 0.
This is the state in which reactors are designed to operate in and corresponds to the critical
state defined above. Indeed, we have  = 0, and so neutron production and loss are in
equilibrium. As in the previous case, the prompt neutrons alone are not enough to sustain
the reactivity, and so the delayed neutrons help to achieve this.
 Prompt subcritical, delayed subcritical: k < 1;  < 0.
This is where neutron loss outweights neutron production and corresponds to the subcrit-
ical regime above.
c-eigenvalue
This final eigenvalue problem is very similar to the previous one, in the sense that it is a
time-independent problem, however there is a subtle difference that arises from requiring the
eigenvalue, c, to also weight the scattering operator, as well as the fission operator. More
precisely, the aim is to find c > 0 and a corresponding function  such that
  (r, ) (r, )(r, )
s(r, )
(r, )s(r, , 
)d + f(r, )
(r, )f(r, , 
)d
. (1.7)
Similar heuristics to those given for k give the interpretation that c is the effective number of
neutrons produced between generations per collision, where, in this case, a collision is either a
scatter or a fission. Criticality is also categorised in the same way as the k-eigenvalue problem,
and it can be shown that the critical regime also coincides with the critical regime in the previous
two problems, with equality of eigenfunctions. This problem has received the least attention
in the literature, however, due to its similarities with the k-eigenvalue problem, many of the
methods used for solving the latter can be adapted solving the c-eigenvalue problem.
Clearly, in all of these cases, the optimal regime for a reactor is the critical one, since this
pertains to a high enough energy production whilst operating at a safe level. In particular, as
mentioned above, reactors are designed to operate in the prompt subcritical, delayed critical
regime. This is the most stable regime and allows the reactor to be operated on the same time
scale as the production of delayed neutrons.
In this thesis, we will predominantly focus on the time-dependent problem (1.5), except for
Chapter 5, in which we consider the k-eigenvalue problem (1.6). For a more extensive discussion
on the various eigenvalue problems, see [17, 10, 13, 2].
1.4 Monte Carlo methods
Although it is not the focus of this thesis, the results obtained in later chapters have allowed
us to develop Monte Carlo algorithms that complement existing ones in industry, in order to
compute quantities such as the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions discussed in the previous section.
We therefore spend a little time discussing some of the algorithms we have developed in parallel
to the theoretical results. These algorithms have been developed further in [6].
The main tool for studying the NTE in this thesis is a branching process, denoted (Xt)t0,
whose behaviour corresponds to that of a nuclear fission process. Let P(r,) denote its law
when issued from a single neutron with configuration (r, ). Note that for the purposes of
this discussion, it is not necessary to give the details of this branching process here; they will
be stated in later chapters. By considering an appropriate average of this branching process,
we obtain a stochastic analogue of the flux, t. More precisely, the linear semigroup of this
branching process
t[g](r, ) := E(r,) [g,Xt] := E(r,)
g(ri(t), i(t))
where Nt is the number of neutrons alive at time t and {(ri(t), i(t)) : i = 1, . . . , Nt} are their
configurations, solves the (backwards) NTE in some sense, and hence, we can think of it as a
representation of the flux, t, with 0 = g.
One of the main results we present in this thesis is a Perron-Frobenius decomposition of
t[g], which roughly says that for (r, )  D  V ,
t[g](r, )  et, g(r, ) + o(et), t (1.8)
where ,  and  are the leading eigenvalue, and right and left eigenfunctions, respectively,
associated with the -eigenvalue problem described in the previous section. Manipulating this
asymptotic leads to
 = lim
logt[g](r, ). (1.9)
In particular, setting g = 1, the constant function with value one, we have
 = lim
logE(r,) [Nt],
which leads to the following Monte Carlo algorithm.
Algorithm 1
Input: T  0, N  N, (r0, 0)  D  V .
for i = 1, . . . , N :
1. Simulate a copy of the branching process, (X(i)t )t0 initiated from (r0, 0).
2. Calculate the number of particles, N (i)T , alive at time T .
Output:  = 1
log 1
For large T and N , this algorithm approximates the eigenvalue .
We would also like to produce estimates of the left and right eigenfunctions,  and . For
this, we define the discounted occupation measure of the branching process up to time t by
esg,Xsds.
For non-negative and measurable functions g, we can apply Fubinis theorem to switch the
expectation and the integral. Then using (1.8), we have
E(r,) [At] = , g(r, ), (1.10)
which inspires a second algorithm.
Algorithm 2
Input: g  L+(D  V ), (r0, 0)  D  V , T  0, N,M  N
for i = 1, . . . , N :
1. Simulate a copy of the branching process, (X(i)t )t0 initiated from (r0, 0).
2. for m = 1, . . . ,M : calculate
g,X(i)
tm/M
j (mt/M), 
j (mt/M)),
whereN (i)
is the number of neutrons in alive at time tm/M , and (r(i)j (mt/M), 
j (mt/M)),
j = 1, . . . , N
are their configurations.
Output: 1
i=1g,X
Due to (1.10), for sufficiently large T,M and N , the output of this algorithm gives an estimate
of g, (r0, 0).
Now, on the one hand, fixing g and varying the initial configuration (r0, 0) allows us
to build a profile of the right eigenfunction , up to a multiplicative constant. On the other
hand, fixing (r0, 0) and varying g allows us to estimate the left eigenfunction . For example,
choosing g = 1B(r,), the indicator function of the ball centred at r  D with radius  > 0, one
can approximate  in a neighbourhood of r.
In short, one can run Algorithm 2 in an outer loop that iterates over either the test
function or the initial condition depending on whether one wants to estimate the left or the
right eigenfunction. As an example of this algorithm, we built a toy two-dimensional reactor
consisting of a square domain and four uranium rods. The scattering and fission rates within
these rods are much higher than in the rest of the reactor to demonstrate inhomogeneities. The
figures below show simulations of the eigenfunctions.
Figure 1-1: A simulation of the leigenfunctions for a two-dimensional reactor containing four
uranium rods. The image on the left is a simulation of the left eigenfunction, , and the one on
the right is the right eigenfunction, .
We note that similar algorithms can be built for estimating the quantities in the other
eigenvalue problems. For example, we refer the reader to Chapter 5 for a discussion regarding
the k-eigenvalue problem.
In terms of efficiency of these algorithms, the variance associated with the estimators of the
eigenelements is very low since they essentially simulate reality. However, since these algorithms
require the simulation of a whole tree of neutrons, the process can become expensive due to
increasing particle numbers in even a slightly supercritical regime.
As previously mentioned, there are already several Monte Carlo algorithms in industry
for calculating various quantities associated with neutron transport criticality problems. For an
overview of some of these methods, we refer the reader to [3, 17, 14, 1, 7].

1.6 Outline of thesis
The aim of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the neutron transport equation
from a probabilistic point of view. Each of these chapters contain a research article, which
were written in collaboration with my supervisors Dr Alexander M. G. Cox, Professor Simon C.
Harris and Professor Andreas E. Kyprianou, and collaborator Dr Denis Villemonais.
1. Multi-species neutron transport equation (Chapter 2). We begin this thesis with
the analysis of a multi-type version of the neutron transport equation. As hinted in the
introduction, nuclear fission does not only involve neutrons but a whole range of emissions,
such as alpha, beta and gamma radiation. From an analytical perspective, this leads to
the analysis of a system of equations of the form
(i, r, ) = (
T i +
S i +
F i)t(i, r, ), t  0, i  {1, . . . ,m}, r  D,   V, (1.12)
where the index i denotes the particle type, and the operators
S i and
F i are of a similar
form to those defined in (1.11). When combined with initial conditions, classical solutions
to this problem take the form ut  L2 whose time derivative also lies in L2, for some
appropriate L2 space.
On the other hand, from a probabilistic perspective, one can build a branching process
X = (Xt)t0, whose dynamics match those of the (multi-type) fission process and whose
linear semigroup is the stochastic analogue of the flux, t. More precisely, we can repre-
sent the system by a collection of particles {(ri,j(t), i,j(t)), i = 1, . . . , N
t , t  0}, where
(ri,j(t), i,j(t)) is the space-velocity configuration of the ith type j particle alive at time t.
Then the branching process can be defined as the empirical distribution of these particles:
Xt(j, A) =
(ri,j(t),i,j(t))(A), A  B(D  V ), (1.13)
and the expectation semigroup is given by
t[g](i, r, ) = E(i,r,) [g,Xt] ,
where Xt(A) = (Xt(1, A), . . . , Xt(m,A)).
We would like to be able to match these two perspectives by saying that t[g](i, , )
solves (1.12), however the notion of solution to (1.12) is too strong for this to be the
case. In the first part of this chapter, we spend time defining an appropriate notion of
solution to the NTE in order for us to say that the expectation semigroup does indeed
solve (1.12). We then consolidate the two approaches.
The second part of the chapter is devoted to the time-dependent eigenvalue problem (1.5).
We use spectral theory to prove the existence of a leading eigentriple (, , ) and an  > 0
such that
t[g](r, ) = e
tg, (r, ) +O(e()t), t, (1.14)
where t[g](r, ) = (t[g](1, r, ), . . . , t[g](m, r, )). In other words, the eigentriple char-
acterises the leading order behaviour of the branching system.

2. Linear semigroup asymptotics (Chapter 3). We now restrict ourselves to the basic
NTE where only (prompt) neutrons are considered. Although we were already able to
provide a solution to the criticality problem (1.5) in Chapter 2, this is still unsatisfactory
from a probabilistic point of view, since we were forced to work in L2 spaces, whereas the
more natural setting for expectation semigroups is L and its dual, L1.
In this chapter we develop a probabilistic approach to characterising the growth of t[g].
The main tools for this approach come from the theory of quasi-stationary distributions
that were developed in [4] and [5]. The first step is to show that the neutron branching
process is equivalent to another process, which we call the neutron random walk, via a
many-to-one formula. Indeed, one can rearrange the NTE to obtain
L + ,
where
L is an operator that has the same form as
S but with a different rate and
kernel, and  is a local potential. This inspires the Feynman-Kac representation
t[g](r, ) = E(r,)
(Rs,s)dsg(Rt,t)1(t<D)
where (Rs,s)s0 is the process with generator
L . Under certain assumptions, one can con-
sider a sub-Markov process that also has generator
L but is eventually absorbed. Studying
the quasi-stationary distribution of this latter process allows us to characterise its growth
in a similar way to (1.14), which immediately gives us the leading order behaviour of the
semigroup t.
In the rest of this chapter we consider the martingale
Wt = e
t ,Xt
, 
, (1.15)
where (, ) are the leading eigenvalue and right eigenfunction of t, and  =
i=1 (ri,i)
describes some initial configuration of particles. We show that there are two regimes for
the long-term behaviour of (Wt)t0, depending on whether  > 0 or   0. Finally, we
use (Wt)t0 to define a change of measure, which leads to a spine decomposition for the
neutron branching process.

3. Skeleton decompositions and the strong law of large numbers (Chapter 4). We
revisit the basic NTE from the previous chapter but instead focus on the supercritical
case,  > 0. Our main goal in this chapter is to characterise the growth of the system via
a strong law of large numbers (SLLN) result:
et
g,Xt
, 
= g, W, almost surely,
where (, , ) is the leading eigentriple from the previous chapter, and W is the limit
of the martingale (Wt)t0, defined in (1.15).
Our methods for proving this result are inspired by those presented in [8]. Indeed, we
would like to be able to adapt the authors proofs directly to the neutron branching process.
However, their proof relies on the fact that the number of particles in the system is non-
decreasing, whereas in our setting, neutrons can be absorbed. This leads us to consider a
skeleton decomposition, similar in spirit to [9]. The idea is to split the neutron branching
process into a tree, Xl, which contains all the particles that survive forever, and subtrees
X, which are attached to Xl and all become extinct. We are then in a position to apply
the proof of [8] to Xl to obtain a SLLN for this process. It then remains to show that the
subtrees X contribute nothing to the limit, due to the fact that they eventually become
extinct.

4. Time-independent criticality problems (Chapter 5). In this final chapter, we move
away from the time-dependent eigenvalue problem and consider the stationary problems.
In particular, we focus on the k-eigenvalue problem, since this is of particular interest
in industry; however our methods will also apply with only minor modifications to the
c-eigenvalue problem.
The k-eigenvalue problem pertains to finding a positive parameter k and associated eigen-
function eff such that
S  fI) = 
F + fI),
so that k can be interpreted as the average number of neutrons produced per fission event.
Again, we would like to view this problem from both an analytical and probabilistic point
of view, and consolidate the two approaches. In order to address the existence of (k, eff)
in the classical sense, we apply similar techniques to those employed in Chapter 2. For
the probabilistic approach, it turns out that the correct object to study is the semigroup
n associated with the average of the neutron branching process at the nth generation of
fission events. As in Chapter 3, we construct a many-to-one formula in order to study
the quasi-stationary distribution of an associated killed random walk in order to obtain
(k, eff , eff) and  > 1 such that
n[g](r, ) = k
ng, effeff(r, ) +O(n), n.

This thesis is presented in the alternative format which includes publications. This means
the research chapters are developed independent of the introduction and supposed to be self-
contained. Hence, it is inevitable that there will be some inconsistencies in notation and redun-
dant content in the introduction chapter.

Abstract
The Neutron Transport Equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons through an inhomoge-
neous fissile medium. Whilst well treated in the nuclear physics literature (cf. [8, 29]), the NTE
has had a somewhat scattered treatment in mathematical literature with a variety of different
approaches (cf. [7, 27]). Within a probabilistic framework it has somewhat undeservingly re-
ceived little attention in recent years; nonetheless, probabilistic treatments can be found: see for
example [19, 28, 24, 31, 4, 3]. In this article our aim is threefold. First we want to introduce a
slightly more general setting for the NTE, which gives a more complete picture of the different
species of particle and radioactive fluxes that are involved in fission. Second we consolidate the
classical c0-semigroup approach to solving the NTE with the method of stochastic representa-
tion which involves expectation semigroups. Third we provide the leading asymptotic of our
multi-species NTE, which will turn out to be crucial for further stochastic analysis of the NTE
in forthcoming work [15, 13, 5]. The methodology used in this paper harmonises the culture
of expectation semigroup analysis from the theory of stochastic processes against c0-semigroup
theory from functional analysis. In this respect, our presentation is thus part review of existing
theory and part presentation of new research results based on generalisation of existing results.

2.1 Introduction
The neutron transport equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons across a directional planar
cross-section in an inhomogeneous fissile medium (typically measured in number of neutrons per
cm2 per second). As such, the flux is described as a function of time, t, Euclidian location,
r  R3, direction of travel,   S2, and neutron energy, E  R. It is not uncommon in the
physics literature, as indeed we shall do here, to assume that energy is a function of velocity
(E = m||2/2), thereby reducing the number of variables by one. This allows us to describe the
dependency of flux more simply in terms of time and, what we call, the configuration variables
(r, )  D  V where D  R3 is a smooth, open, connected and bounded domain of concern
such that D has zero Lebesgue measure and V is the velocity space, which can now be taken
to be V = {v  R3 : min < |v| < max}, where 0 < min < max <5.
Before stating the NTE, let us remind the reader of some elementary nuclear physics,
which is required to describe the evolution of neutron flux. In the most basic of flux models,
there are essentially only four processes at the level of the atomic nuclei which contribute to the
evolution of neutron flux.
The first is spontaneous neutron emission from unstable nuclei. This comes from ra-
dioactive isotopes whose nuclei are excited. They cause what is known as non-transmutation
emissions, in which a neutron is ejected with an escape velocity (neutron emission), or, con-
versely, what are called transmutation emissions in which the nucleus instantaneously fragments
into two or more nuclei (spontaneous fission) with a range of possible masses, emitting one or
more neutrons with escape velocities in the process.
The second process pertains to neutron scattering. This is where a neutron travelling with
a given velocity passes in close proximity to an atomic nucleus, which, in our model, results in
an instantaneous change of velocity.
The third process is neutron-induced fission. This is the classical setting in which a neutron
travelling with a given velocity strikes an atomic nucleus sending it into an excited state, from
which it instantaneously fragments into two or more nuclei, simultaneously releasing one or more
neutrons.
The fourth and final process is neutron capture. In this setting, a neutron travelling with
a given velocity strikes an atomic nucleus, but instead of causing nuclear fission, it is absorbed
into the nucleus. It can also be the case that neutrons decay into other subatomic particles,
and thus disappear from the system. To all intents and purposes, we can treat this as neutron
capture.
When modelling the transmission of neutrons in a fissile material, those neutrons which
have been released from nuclei are known as prompt neutrons.
With more advanced modelling, one can also take account of the fact that some of the
processes described above can also involve other types of nuclear emissions, often in addition
to neutrons. These include alpha and beta particles and gamma radiation. Whilst the former
5In practice, min = 1/40MeV and max can be taken to be the speed of light.
two are not sufficiently energetic to cause fission, sufficiently energetic gamma rays are able to
induce fission.
Spontaneous fission and neutron-induced fission can also produce what are known as de-
layed neutrons. These are neutrons released from a fission product (isotope) some time after
fission has occurred. In terms of modelling, they are spontaneous neutron emissions which occur
at the site of neutron-induced fission but at a moment later in time. Delayed neutrons are only
in a delayed state until they are released after which they are considered as prompt neutrons.
We refer to models which take account of the full range of flux profiles as multi-species
models.
2.2 Neutron Transport Equation
Let us now write down the basic neutron transport equation (prompt neutrons only), which has
been widely considered in a variety of physics and engineering literature (cf. [8, 29], to name but
two classical references), and somewhat more sporadically studied in the mathematical literature.
See [7, 27, 19] for the three most authoritative mathematical texts in more recent times, as well
as e.g. [28, 14, 24] for some of the rarer examples of the probabilistic treatment of the NTE.
Neutron flux at time t  0 is henceforth identified as t : D  V  [0,), and the
classical presentation of its evolution in time is given by the integro-differential equation, also
known as the forward neutron transport equation6,
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, ) +Q(r, , t)
t(r, 
)s(r, 
)s(r, 
, )d +
t(r, 
)f(r, 
)f(r, 
, )d, (2.1)
where the different components (or cross-sections as they are known in the physics literature)
are all uniformly bounded and measurable with the following interpretation:
s(r, 
) : the rate at which scattering occurs from incoming velocity ,
f(r, 
) : the rate at which fission occurs from incoming velocity ,
(r, ) : the sum of the rates f + s, also known as the total cross section
s(r, 
, )d : the scattering yield at velocity  from incoming velocity ,
satisfying
s(r, , 
)d = 1,
f(r, 
, )d : the neutron yield at velocity  from fission with incoming velocity ,
satisfying
f(r, , 
)d <, and
Q(r, , t) : non-negative source term.
It is normal to assume that all quantities are uniformly bounded away from infinity. It is also
6Here and everywhere else in the document,  is the gradient operator with respect to the variable r  R3.
usual to assume the additional boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr < 0,
(2.2)
where nr is the outward facing normal ofD at r  D and g : DV  [0,) is a bounded, mea-
surable function which we will later assume has some additional properties. Roughly speaking,
as the forward equation describes where particles could have evolved from in order to contribute
to the current configuration, this boundary condition means that particles from outside the do-
main with incoming velocity are not taken into account. The second of the above two boundary
conditions is sometimes written t|D = 0, where D = {(r, )  D  V :   nr < 0}. It is
also usual to set Q = 0 when considering a reactor with a multiplying medium, as the resulting
fission will overwhelm the radioactive source term.
The notion of a solution of the form (2.1) turns out to be too strong to expect to make
mathematical sense of it. This is predominantly due to the non-diffusive nature of the equation,
in particular the non-local nature of the scattering and fission operators as well as regularity
issues on the domain D  V in relation to continuity properties of e.g. the operator   . It
is much more natural to look for solutions that belong to e.g. an appropriate L2 space. This
is, moreover, helpful when looking to understand (2.1) as a backwards equation, rather than a
forwards equation.
With some rearrangements, the components of (2.1) separate into transport, scattering
and fission. Specifically,

Tg(r, ) :=   g(r, ) (r, )g(r, ) (forwards transport)
Sg(r, ) :=
g(r, )s(r, )s(r, 
, )d (forwards scattering)
Fg(r, ) :=
g(r, )f(r, )f(r, 
, )d (forwards fission)
(2.3)
such that all operators are defined on D V and their action is zero otherwise. Let us momen-
tarily consider the operator on the right-hand side of (2.1) as acting on L2(DV ), the space of
square integrable functions on D  V , and write
f, g =
f(r, )g(r, )drd
for the associated inner product. Note that, for f, g  L2(D  V ) such that both   f and
  g are well defined as distributional derivatives, which are also in the space L2(D  V ),
with g respecting the second of the boundary conditions in (2.2), we can verify with a simple
integration by parts that, for   V ,
f,   g =
(  )f(r, )g(r, )drd    f, g =   f, g (2.4)
providing we insist that f respects the boundary f(r, ) = 0 for r  D if   nr > 0. Moreover,
Fubinis theorem also tells us that, for example, with f, g  L2(D  V ),
g(, )s(, )s(, , )d =
DVV
f(r, )s(r, 
)g(r, )s(r, 
, )ddrd

= s(, )
f(, )s(, , )d, g.
These computations tell us that, for f, g  L2(DV ) such that  g and  f are well defined
in the distributional sense and in L2, and moreover, that g(r, ) = 0 for r  D if   nr < 0,
and for f  L2(D  V ) such that f(r, ) = 0 for r  D if   nr > 0,
f, (
F)g = (
F)f, g,
where now we identify the transport, scattering and fission operators as

Tf(r, ) :=   f(r, ) (backwards transport)
Sf(r, ) := s(r, )
f(r, )s(r, , 
)d  s(r, )f(r, ) (backwards scattering)
Ff(r, ) := f(r, )
f(r, )f(r, , 
)d  f(r, )f(r, ) (backwards fission)
(2.5)
such that all operators are defined on D  V with zero action otherwise. The reader will
immediately note that, although the terms in the sum
F are identifiable as the adjoint
of the terms in the sum
F , the same can not be said for the individual T, S and F
operators. That is to say, the way we have grouped the terms does not allow us to say that e.g.
T is the adjoint operator to
T and so on.
The reason for this difference in grouping of terms lies with how one reads the operators
in terms of infinitesimal generators as a probabilist. Although this will not make any difference
in the analysis of this paper, we keep to this notation for the sake of consistency with further
related articles which offer a probabilistic perspective on the backwards NTE; see [5, 15, 13].
Roughly speaking,
T , with an appropriately defined domain, is the generator of the rather
simple Markov process consisting of a deterministic motion with velocity , i.e. transport due
to pure advection, with killing on exiting the domain D. Similarly, with an appropriately
defined domain, the operator
S is the generator corresponding to scattering, in which a particle
travelling with velocity  at position r is removed at rate s and replaced by a new particle
at r with velocity  chosen with probability s(r, , )d. Taking advantage of the fact that
s(r, , d)d = 1 we can also write
s(r, )
f(r, )s(r, , 
)d  s(r, )f(r, ) = s(r, )
[f(r, ) f(r, )]s(r, , )d
and also note that it takes the classical form of a difference operator. Finally
F is the generator
action of a fission even in which a particle travelling with velocity  at position r is removed at
rate f and replaced by an average number of particles f(r, , )d moving onwards from r
with velocity .
This leads us to the so called backwards neutron transport equation (which is also known
as the adjoint neutron transport equation) given by
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, )
+ s(r, )
t(r, 
)s(r, , 
)d + f(r, )
t(r, 
)f(r, , 
)d, (2.6)
with additional boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr > 0.
(2.7)
Similarly to previously, the second of these two conditions is often written t|D+ = 0, where
D+ := {(r, )  D  V :   nr > 0}.
The NTE has played a prominent role in real-world modelling and, for many years, has
found a home in commercial software7 which is used in the nuclear safety industry. In partic-
ular, this is most prominent in the modelling and design of environments which are exposed to
radioactive material, from nuclear reactor cores and hospital equipment, through to equipment
used to irradiate produce that is sold in supermarkets, thereby prolonging its shelf-life. More
recently, with the notion of human interplanetary space exploration becoming less of a sci-fi fan-
tasy and more of a fast approaching reality, an understanding of how long-lasting and compact
nuclear power sources, for e.g. Moon or Mars bases has become increasingly important.
Figure 2-1 below illustrates a typical geometrical model of a reactor core rod, cladding
and outer shielding.8 The structural design of such a reactor can easily be stored as virtual
environment (i.e. storing the coordinates of the different geometrical domains and the material
properties in each domain) with around 150MB of data, on to which extensive data libraries of
numerical values for the respective quantities s, f, s, f can be mapped. (It is an otherwise
little known fact that countries which are heavily invested in nuclear power, such as the UK,
USA, France, China, etc., are all in possession of such numerical libraries of cross sections, which
have been carefully built up over decades.)

properties of the virtual materials used. Uranium rods are arranged into hexagonal cells which

One of the principal ways in which neutron flux is understood is to look for the leading
eigenvalue and associated ground state eigenfunction. Roughly speaking, this means looking for
an associated triple of eigenvalue   R, non-negative right eigenfunction  : DV  [0,) in
L2(DV ) satisfying |D+ = 0 and a non-negative left eigenfunction  on DV in L2(DV )
satisfying |D = 0 such that
, f = (
F), f and f,  = (
F)f, .
As such, this introduces the notion of fissile stability, in particular in the case that  = 0. This
is naturally the desired scenario9 for a nuclear reactor.
In the physics literature, it is thus often understood that, to leading order, the NTE (2.6)
is solved in the approximate sense
t(r, ) = e
tg, (r, ) + o(et), t  0. (2.8)
Note that the scenario that  > 0 is obviously to be avoided in practice as this would
correspond to a set-up that could result in exponential growth in fission.
The approximation (2.8) can be seen as a functional version of the Perron-Frobenius The-
orem and has given rise to a number of different numerical methods for estimating the value of
the eigenvalue  as well as the eigenfunctions  and . One approach pertains to the discreti-
sation of (2.1) followed by the use of numerical analytic methods; see [32]. Another pertains to
the previously alluded to identification of the solution to the NTE as the linear semigroup of a

this is that at criticality, as proved in [13], neutron activity will eventually die out.
Markov branching process, which in turn implies Monte Carlo methods involving the simulation
of the aforesaid branching process. Such methods are computationally expensive, as branching
processes, being tree-like structures, are complex to simulate, e.g. from the point of view of
parallelisation. In related papers to this one, we will discuss a new Monte Carlo approach to the
NTE based on some of the stochastic analysis we deal with in this article as well as in related
work undertaken by the authors of this paper; see [15, 13, 5].
The aim of this paper is as follows. First and foremost, we aim to reposition the theory
of the NTE into a contemporary probabilistic setting. We will do this by explaining a precise
relationship between the NTE and two different families of Markov processes via FeynmanKac
type formulae. Indeed, this article is one of a cluster of forthcoming pieces of work, which take
a new and predominantly probabilistic point of view of the NTE; cf [5, 15, 13]. Next we want to
introduce the notion of the (multi-species) NTE into the literature, which generalises (2.1) by
simultaneously modeling the flux of all species of particles and radiation involved in the process
of nuclear fission. In doing so we will show that, just as in the classical setting, one may develop
the notion of a lead eigenvalue and eigenfunction, which is an important part of describing fissile
stability. As such, the current article is part review of existing theory and part presentation of
new research results based on generalisation of existing results.
Together with the accompanying papers [5, 15, 13], we believe that the probabilistic per-
spective presented here, i.e. coupling the solutions to the NTE with averaging procedures of
certain Markov processes, opens up the possibility of many questions that can be considered at
depth in the arena of stochastic analysis and Monte Carlo algorithms, which are currently missing
from the literature. Indeed, returning to the kind of environments seen in Figure 2-1, there are
many questions concerning how to analyse and numerically generate the leading eigenfunctions
and eigenvalue to a reasonable degree of precision. Such questions might include: What is the
connection of the eigendecomposition discussed in this paper and e.g. R-theory or the theory of
general Harris recurrence for stochastic processes (cf. [10, 26, 25])? How do different stochastic
representations lead to different Monte Carlo simulations? Based on stochastic representation
how does one measure convergence of Monte Carlo algorithms? How strong can they be predicted
to be? What kind of variance reduction techniques does stochastic representation suggest? Does
the inclusion of multi-species models make estimation of the leading eigenvalue more accurate?
2.3 Organisation of the paper
In the next section, we give a brief overview of the key mathematical literature for the NTE.
(Note we do not stray beyond mathematical literature, as the physics and engineering literature
is significantly more expansive.) Thereafter in Section 2.5, we introduce the multi-species NTE
(MNTE) and its rigorous formulation, existence, uniqueness and asymptotics in the setting of an
abstract Cauchy problem. In particular, we show how the unique solution is identified as a c0-
semigroup in the appropriate L2 space. In Section 2.6, we introduce a spatial branching process
that is constructed using the cross sections that appear in the NTE to describe its stochastic
evolution. Here we introduce its expectation semigroup. In Section 2.7, we provide a second
stochastic representation to the expectation semigroup introduced in the previous section via a
classical method of the many-to-one formula.
Ideally, we would like to claim that the expectation semigroup discussed in Sections 2.6
and 2.7 agree with the c0-semigroup introduced in Section 2.5 (its formal definition appearing
just above Theorem 2). This is particularly desired as it forms the foundations of how Monte
Carlo simulation of the physical process can be used to develop a numerical solution to the
MNTE. In Section 2.8, we consolidate the two notions of semigroup and show that there is
partial agreement in an appropriate sense. As far as we are aware, this is a point which is
currently not clearly discussed in the literature. Finally we end the paper with a proof of one of
the main theorems in Section 2.6 which provides the asymptotic behaviour of the solution to the
MNTE in terms of the lead eigenfunction. This is a new result in the multi-species setting in the
sense that we have allowed for multiple types of prompt emissions (both particles and radioactive
emissions) rather than the case of only one type of prompt emission dealt with in [27]; we also
allow for multiple types of delayed emissions (that is, emissions that are pre-emptively held in an
unstable radioactive isotope product from an earlier fission event). Our proof nonetheless takes
inspiration from the classical approach of [7, 27], and remains loyal to the techniques there.
2.4 Historical remarks on the mathematical treatment of the
Classical texts such as Davison and Sykes [8] were once hailed as a bible of mathematical
knowledge during the 1950s post Manhattan Project era when rapid technological advances lead
to the construction of the very first nuclear reactors driving commercial power stations. Around
this time, there was an understanding of how to treat the NTE in special geometries and also
by imposing isotropic scattering and fission, see for example Lehner [20] and Lehner and Wing
[22, 21]. It was also understood quite early on that the natural way to cite the NTE is via the
linear differential transport equation associated to a suitably defined operator on a Banach space.
Moreover, it was understood that in this formulation, a spectral decomposition should play a key
role in representing solutions, see e.g. Jrgens [17], Pazy and Rabinowitz [30]. This notion was
promoted by the work of R. Dautray and collaborators, who showed how c0-semigroups form a
natural framework within which one may analyse the existence and uniqueness of solutions to
the NTE; see [6] and [7]. Moreover, a similar approach has also been pioneered by Mokhtar-
Kharroubi [27].
The probabilistic interpretation of the NTE was appreciated from the very first treatments
of the NTE (see e.g. [8] and references therein as well as Bell [2]). Indeed, the physical description
of nuclear fission, when governed by basic principles, allowing for additional randomness, is
nothing more than a branching Markov process. Numerous derivations of the NTE from this
perspective can be found in the literature to various degrees of rigour; see e.g. Bell [2], Mori et
al. [28], Pazy and Rabinowitz, [31], Lewins [23] and Pzsit and Pl. [29].
A more modern treatment of the probabilistic representation through Feynman-Kac ex-
pectation semigroups and the connection to the theory of Markov diffusions is found in Dautray
et al. [6]. A purely probabilistic treatment can be found in Lapeyre et al. [19]. See also the
accompanying papers to this one [5, 15, 13].
We finish this section by noting that there is a body of literature that pertains to the
numerical analysis of the NTE. Recent work in this field, including the notion of uncertainty
quantification, can be found in e.g. [24, 16, 32]. See also references therein.
2.5 Multi-species (Backwards) Neutron Transport Equation
In the following discussion, rather than talk about typed particles, we prefer to say typed
emissions as the different types correspond to particles, electromagnetic rays (e.g. gamma
rays) and isotopes (which are considered to be carriers for delayed emissions). Let us now
introduce an advanced version of the NTE, which takes account of both non-transmutation
emissions as well as transmutation emissions, in particular, allowing for the inclusion of all types
of emissions, prompt neutrons, delayed neutrons, alpha, beta and gamma emissions etc. An
important feature (and arguably a restriction) of our model is that only prompt neutrons can
produce delayed emissions.
In order to keep track of the various emission types, we define the type space I :=
{1, . . . ,m} for some m  N, ordered such that
type 1 emissions: prompt neutrons (neutrons released immediately after fission)
types 2, . . . , ` emissions: other prompt emissions (e.g. alpha, beta, gamma emissions)
types `+ 1, . . . ,m emissions: isotopes (holding types/precursors) that hold delayed emissions.
Finally, the set of admissible velocities for each of the types i can be embedded within a
common space V = {  R3 : min  ||  max}, with 0 < min  max < ). In practice,
neutrons travel with a minimum speed of 1
MeV but from a mathematical perspective, a lower
bound on the speed ensures irreducibility of the system, as we later discuss.
We now consider the flux, t(i, r, ) of type i emissions through a given region r  D with
velocity   V at time t  0. We are interested in the so called multi-species neutron transport
equation (MNTE) which takes the form
t(i, r, ) =   t(i, r, ) i(r, )t(i, r, )
+ is(r, )
t(i, r, )
s(r, , 
)d
+ if(r, )
t(j, r, )
f (r, , 
)d
+ 1(i=1)
f(r, )
j=`+1
mj(r, )t(j, r, ), (2.9)
for prompt emissions i = 1,    , `, whereas, in the case of delayed emissions, i = ` + 1,    ,m
satisfies
t(i, r, ) = it(i, r, ) + i
t(j, r, )
f (r, , 
)d, (2.10)
which is of a simple form because it describes only how these emissions are held in a suspended
state (no advection) before being converted back to prompt emissions. Similarly to before, we
have the following interpretation:
is(r, ) : the rate at which scattering occurs for a type i emission with incoming
velocity ,
if(r, ) : the rate at which fission occurs for a type i emission with incoming
velocity ,
i(r, ) : the sum of the rates if + 
s and is known as the total cross section for a
type i emission,
is(r, , 
)d : the scattering yield at velocity  from incoming velocity  for a type i
emission, satisfying
is(r, , 
)d = 1,
f (r, , 
)d : the average type j yield at velocity  from fission with incoming velocity
 for a type i emission satisfying
f (r, , 
)d <,
mj(r, ) : the average type j (unstable) isotope yield from a fission event due to a
type 1 particle with incoming velocity ,
i : the decay rate for a type i isotope.
The above quantities are also called cross sections and there are a number of assumptions about
these quantities that will remain in force throughout the remainder of this text.
Assumption 1. All cross sections are non-negative, measurable and uniformly bounded from
above. Moreover, all prompt emissions scatter and hence, without loss of generality, we also
assume that for for each i = 1,    , `, the terms isis are uniformly bounded away from the
origin on D V  V . We need not assume that the cross sections if
f are uniformly bounded
away from the origin for 1  i, j  `, with the exception of i = 1, for which it only makes
sense that 1fm
j is uniformly bounded away from 0 for each j = ` + 1,    ,m. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that 0 < `+1 <    < m.
We also assume similar boundary conditions to the single-type case in the sense that
emissions exiting the physical domain D are killed. That is to say
0(i, r, ) = g(i, r, ) for 1  i  m, r  D,   V,
t(i, r, ) = 0 for 1  i  `, r  D if   nr > 0.
(2.11)
For the second condition, we will write t|D+ = 0, where D+ = {(i, r, )  {1,    , `} D
V :   nr > 0}
Classical literature suggests that one can integrate delayed neutrons into the setting of the
NTE by adding an inhomogeneity corresponding to the integral of incoming delayed neutrons
from time  to the present; see e.g. [8]. A vectorial representation such as the one above
can be found, however, in the work of [27]. There, only one category of prompt emissions are
considered with multiple species of delayed neutrons.
As before, let us define the multi-species backward transport, scattering and fission op-
erators as they appear in MNTE (2.9) and (2.10), acting on f 
i=1 L2(D  V ), so that, for
i = 1,   m,

T if(, r, ) := 1(1i`)  f(i, r, )
S if(, r, ) := 1(1i`)
[f(i, r, ) f(i, r, )]is(r, )is(r, , )d
F if(, r, ) := 1(1i`)
f(j, r, )if(r, )
f (r, , 
)d  if(r, )f(i, r, 
+1(i=1)

if(r, )m
j(r, )f(j, r, )
+1(`+1im)
i
f(j, r, )
f (r, , 
)d  if(i, r, )
with zero action otherwise.
It is not often that MNTE is stated as above in (2.9) and (2.10) in existing literature; see
e.g. [27] for presentation of the NTE in a similar vectorial format, which allows for only one
category of prompt neutrons.
The requirement that all cross sections are uniformly bounded is by far not the weakest
assumption we can make (see e.g. Chapter XXI of [7]).
The precise mathematical sense in which we must understand solutions to the coupled
system (2.9) and (2.10) needs some discussion before we can proceed. To this end, we shall first
introduce some notational conventions.
As alluded to above, we are interested in a vector space of functions, written as the column
vector g() = (g(1, ), . . . , g(m, ))T, whose entries g(i, ) : DV  [0,), for each i = 1,    ,m.
More precisely we are interested in functions f 
j=1 L2(DV ), which is easily verified to be
itself an L2 space with inner product given by
f, g =
(f, g)i, where (f, g)i =
f(i, r, )g(i, r, )drd. (2.12)
Generally speaking, for a scalar quantity which is indexed by i, say a(i), when written without
the index, we will understand it to be a column vector. Sometimes we will want to put f m
j=1 L2(D  V ) on the diagonal of an m  m matrix, in which case we will write diag(f).
For our transport, scattering and fission operators, we will understand
T = diag(
T1,    ,
however, we will understand
F to be the matrix acting on vectors f 
j=1 L2(D  V ), with
i, j-th entry given by
F i,jf(j, r, ) := 1(1i,j`)
f(j, r, )if(r, )
f (r, , 
)d  1(i=j)
f(r, )f(i, r, 
+ 1(i=1,`+1jm)
f(r, )m
j(r, )f(j, r, )
+ 1(`+1im,1j`)
f(j, r, )
f (r, , 
)d  1(i=j)if(i, r, )
The operator
S can be handled similarly to
We are fundamentally interested in a classical solution to the so-called (initial-value) ab-
stract Cauchy problem (ACP) 
ut = (
u0 = g
(2.13)
where ut is treated as a column vector belonging to the space
j=1 L2(D  V ), for t  0.
Specifically this means that (ut, t  0) is continuously differentiable in this space. In other
words, there exists a t 
j=1 L2(D  V ), which is time-continuous in
j=1 L2(D  V ) with
respect to 2, such that limh0 h1(ut+h  ut) = t for all t  0.
The theory of c0-semigroups gives us a straightforward approach to describing the unique
solution to (2.13). Recall that a c0-semigroup also goes by the name of a strongly continuous
semigroup and, in the present context, this means a family of time-indexed operators, (Vt, t  0),
j=1 L2(D  V ) with the properties that
(i) V0 = Id,
(ii) Vt+s[g] = Vt[Vs[g]], for all s, t  0, g 
j=1 L2(D  V ) and
(iii) for all g 
j=1 L2(D  V ), limh0Vh[g] g2 = 0.
To see how c0-semigroups relate to (2.13), let us define
F and define
(Vt[g], t  0) the semigroup generated by
A via
Vt[g] := exp(t
A)g, g 
L2(D  V ). (2.14)
Note that
A) :=
L2(D  V ) : lim
h1Vh[g] g2 exists
is the domain of
A and standard theory (cf. [12]) tells us that Vt[g]  Dom(
A) for all t  0, and
g  Dom(
A). Proposition II.6.2 of [12] now gives us the relevance to (2.13).
Theorem 2. (Proposition II.6.2, [12]) Let (
A ,Dom(
A)) be the generator of a c0-semigroup
(Vt, t  0). If g  Dom(
A), then ut := Vt[g] is a representation of the unique classical solution
of (2.13).
The reader may well have wondered where the second boundary condition in (2.11) has
gone in the above formulation. This is a matter of interpretation of (
T ,Dom(
T)), and hence the
generator (
A ,Dom(
A)), as we now discuss.
We are interested in the advection semigroup with killing on the boundary of D,
Ut[g](i, r, ) = g(i, r + t, )1(t<Dr,), i = 1,    , ` and t  0. (2.15)
where
Dr, := inf{t > 0 : r + t 6 D}. (2.16)
In essence, (Us, s  0) is the semigroup of the process which moves from a point of issue r in a
straight line with velocity  and which is killed on hitting D. To see why U := (Us, s  0) has
the semigroup property, note that
Dr+s, = inf{t > 0 : r + (t+ s) 6 D} = (r,  s)  0,
so that t < Dr+s, if and only if t+ s < 
r,. Hence for any g 
i=1 L2(D V ) satisfying the
boundary conditions (2.11), we have from the definition (2.15), for i = 1,    , `, r  D,   V ,
Us[Ut[g]](i, r, ) = Ut[g](i, r + s, )1(s<Dr,)
= g(i, r + (t+ s), )1(t<Dr+s,)
1(s<Dr,)
= Ut+s[g](i, r, )
Defining Ut[g](i, r, ) = g(i, r, ) for i = ` + 1, . . . ,m, it is a straightforward exercise, see
e.g. Theorem 2 in Chapter XXI of [7], to show that U is a c0-semigroup with generator
T . Its
domain satisfies
T i)
i=`+1
L2(D  V ), where
T i) =
g  L2(D  V ) :   g  L2(D  V ) and g|D+ = 0
. (2.17)
Here, by   g  L2(D  V ) we mean that   g exists in the distributional sense and is
integrable in the space L2(D  V ).
The domain of
A can be no larger than Dom(
T). It turns out however that Dom(
A) =Dom(
To see why, we need only consider that the linear operators of the form
Kif(i, r, ) := 
i(r, )
f(j, r, )i,j(r, , )d,
are continuous mappings from
i=1 L2(D  V ) into itself, where  and 
i,j are non-negative,
measurable and uniformly bounded. The proof is a straightforward exercise which uses the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality; see for example Lemma XXI.1 of [7]. It follows that Dom(
S) and
F) are both equal to
i=1 L2(D  V ) and, hence, Dom(
A) and Dom(
T) agree.
Note there is no particular necessity to put solutions in an L2 space. One might equally
work with the space
i=1 Lp(D  V ), for p  (1,). As the reader might suspect, solutions of
the backwards equation in an Lp space comes hand in hand with a similarly formulated solution
to the forward equation in the conjugate space
i=1 Lq(D  V ), where q
1 + p1 = 1. See
for example Chapter XXI of [7] or [27]. The reader will note the exclusion of the L1 and L
conjugacy. The reason for the exclusion boils down to the cumbersome nature of the advection
operator
T =   . Quite simply it is not possible to verify the strong continuity property of
the advection semigroup
Ut[g](i, r, ) = g(i, r + t, )1(t<Dr,), t  0. (2.18)
where Dr, := inf{t > 0 : r+t 6 D}. Hence we cannot give a meaning to   as a c0-semigroup
on L(D  V ). This is unfortunate as the latter is the more natural setting for probabilistic
interpretation of solutions to the ACP. Having said that, the backwards scattering and fission
operators, respectively
S and
F , are well defined on all
i=1 Lp(D  V ) spaces for p  [1,].
One of our main results will be to establish the asymptotic (2.8) but now in the current
setting. Recall that we have assumed thatD  R3 is a smooth open pathwise connected bounded
domain such that D has zero Lebesgue measure.
Theorem 3. Let D be convex. We assume the following irreducibility conditions. For each
i, j  {1, . . . , `} assume that each of the cross sections if(r, )
f (r, , 
), if(r, )m
j(r, ) and
is(r, )
s(r, , 
) are piece-wise continuous10 on DV V and there exists k = ki,j  {1, . . . , `}
such that

Then,

is leading in the sense that c = sup{Re() :  is an eigenvalue of
A} and which has

polytopes) such that there is continuity in each element of the partition. This is precisely how cross sections are

value for , suppose we enumerate the real eigenvalues of
A in decreasing order by the
set {(1),    , (n)} (noting from earlier that we have at least (1) = c). Then we have
(n) > `+1 and we can take any  such that  < c((2)(`+1)) where we understand
(2) =  if n = 1.
Remark 1. It could be argued that the assumptions in the above theorem rule out the possibility
that we may, for example, include alpha or beta emissions emissions in the model for that
particular conclusion. Whilst alpha and beta emissions may scatter, they are not energetic
enough to cause fission. The irreducibility conditions (2.19) and (2.20) would thus fail. On
the other hand, it is also known that when such particles are energetic enough, they can draw
gamma radiation or positrons out of nuclei when passing in close proximity. If the latter are
sufficiently energetic, then they can induce fission.
2.6 Multi-species neutron branching process
Heuristically speaking, (2.13) can be thought of as being closely related to the expectation
semigroup of a Markov branching process, or Multi-species nuclear branching process (MNBP) as
we shall call it, whose infinitesimal generator is
F . Consider the system of typed emissions
whose configurations in DV at time t  0 are given by {ri,j(t), i,j(t) : i = 1, . . . , N
t }, where,
for each j = 1, . . . ,m, N jt is the number of type j emissions alive at time t. In order to describe
the system as Markovian, we will represent it by the atomic measures
Xt(j, A) =
(ri,j(t),i,j(t))(A), j = 1, . . . ,m,
where A is a Borel subset of D  V and  is the Dirac measure defined on the same space.
Then the system can be described via the m-tuple Xt() = (Xt(1, ), . . . , Xt(m, )), t  0, which
evolves as follows.
. A emission of type i  {1, . . . , `} with configuration (r, ) moves in a straight line with
velocity  from the point r until one of the following events occur:
 The emission leaves the domain, at which point it is killed.
 Independently of all other emissions, a scattering event occurs when an emission comes
in close proximity to an atomic nucleus and, accordingly, makes an instantaneous change
of velocity. For an emission in the system of type i  {1, . . . , `} with initial position and
velocity (r, ), if we write T is for the random time until the next scattering occurs, then,
independently of any other physical event that may affect the emission,
Pr(T is > t) = exp
is(r + s, )ds
. (2.22)
 When scattering of an emission of type i  {1, . . . , `} occurs at space-velocity (r, ), the
new velocity is selected independently with probability is(r, , 
)d.
 Independently of all other emissions, a fission event occurs when an emission smashes into
an atomic nucleus. For an emission in the system with initial position and velocity (r, ),
we will write T if for the random time that the next fission occurs. Then independently of
any other physical event that may affect the emission,
Pr(T if > t) = exp
if(r + s, )ds
. (2.23)
 When fission occurs, the smashing of the atomic nucleus releases a random number of
other prompt emissions of type i = 1,    , `, say N i,j  0, which are ejected from
the point of impact with randomly distributed, and possibly corollated, velocities, say
{i,jk : k = 1,    , N
i,j}. When fission occurs at location r  D from an emission with
incoming velocity   V , the quantity i,jf (r, , 
)d describes the average number of type
j prompt emissions released from nuclear fission with outgoing velocity in the infinitesimal
neighbourhood of . In particular
f (r, , 
)d = E
N i,j
 , A  B(V ).
 Note, the possibility that Pr(N i,j = 0) > 0 is possible. If i = j = 1 then this is tanta-
mount to neutron capture or further decomposition into subatomic particles which are not
counted.
 Further, if the initial emission is a (type 1) neutron, a fission event (occurring at rate 1f)
may result in the production of unstable isotopes (which later release delayed emissions).
On this event, an average number, mj(r, ), of type j  {` + 1, . . . ,m} isotopes will be
produced from a collision at position r from a neutron with incoming velocity . The
isotopes will inherit the configuration of the incoming nucleus at the time of collision.
. An isotope of type i  {` + 1, . . . ,m} with inherited physical configuration (r, ) stays
in the same place for an exponentially distributed amount of time with rate i. At this point,
it produces a random number of type j  {1, . . . , `} prompt emissions, the average number
of which, along with their corresponding velocities, are chosen according to i,jf (r, , 
), in a
similar way to previously described. We note that although unstable isotopes stay in the same
spatial position, we will still assign them a velocity as a mark.
In all cases, it is natural to make the following physical assumption which will remain in
force throughout.
Assumption 4. Random emissions of any type are bounded in number by the non-random
constant nmax  1. In particular this means that
1im,1j`,rD,V
f (r, , V )  nmax and sup
r,D,V1,1j`
mj(r, )  nmax.
For non-negative and uniformly bounded g :
i=1(DV ) 7 [0,), that is g 
i=1 L
V ), define the expectation semigroup
t[g](i, r, v) := E(i,r,v) [g,Xt], (2.24)
where P(i,r,v) is law of the process started from a single type i emission with configuration (r, )
with corresponding expectation operator E(i,r,v) .
As we have assumed that all cross sections are uniformly bounded, ignoring spatial trajec-
tories of neutrons (in particular those that are killed by leaving the domain D), it is straightfor-
ward to compare the growth of (t[g], t  0) against that of a continuous-time Galton-Watson
process with growth rate {(mnmax)1}, where  = sup1i`,rD,V if(r, )+max`+1im i.
The rate of growth {(m  nmax)  1} simply assumes that each emission of type i gives
rise to at most nmax emissions of any other type and at a rate which is uniformly bounded
by a uniform upper bound of all possible rates at which fission events occur. Note this rate
takes account of the emission count introduced into the system at a fission event and the single
emission removed from the system which caused the fission event.
It is also straightforward to stochastically upper bound the process 1, Xt, t  0, by the
aforesaid continuous-time Galton Watson process on the same probability space. The latter
process branches whenever X does, topping up the number of offspring always to nmax, but also
has additional independent branching events at rate (1(1i`)if(r, )1(`+1im)i) always
producing precisely nmax offspring of each of the m possible emissions.
If we denote this Galton-Waton process by (Zt, t  0), then we have both the stochastic
bound 1, Xt  Zt  Zt+s, for all s, t  0 and the upper estimate
1im,rD,V
t[g](i, r, )  g exp(((nmax m) 1)t), t  0. (2.25)
If we put g in the smaller space
+(D  V ), the space of non-negative, continuous and
uniformly bounded vector functions on D  V , then we also have by a dominated convergence
argument, limt0 t[g] = g in the pointwise sense. Otherwise the latter convergence is not
necessarily clear.
The name expectation semigroup is earned thanks to the behaviour of (t, t  0) under
an application of the Markov branching property. Indeed, associated to the MNBP are the
probabilities P for atomic measures of the form
(1,ri,1,i,1),    ,
(m,ri,m,i,m).
=: (1,    , m). (2.26)
The Markov branching property dictates that, for g 
i=1 L2(D  V ) as before and t  0,
E[g,Xt] =
E(j,ri,j ,i,j) [g,Xt] = E(,,) [g,Xt], 
Here we are abusing our earlier notation in (2.12) and writing for finite atomic measures  of
the form (2.26),
g,  =
(g, )i, where (g, )i =
g(i, r, )i(dr, d). (2.27)
Hence, by conditioning on the configuration of the system at time t  0, we have, for s  0,
t+s[g](i, r, v) := E(i,r,v) [EXt [f,Xs]] = E(i,r,v) [s[g], Xt] = t[s[g]](i, r, v). (2.28)
The expectation semigroup property of (t, t  0) does not imply that it is necessarily a
c0-semigroup on
i=1 L2(D V ). Recalling our earlier discussion, if we were able to work with
(2.13) in the setting of a c0-semigroup on
i=1 L(D  V )), then we would be much closer to
being able to match the expectation semigroup (t, t  0) to the solution (ut, t  0). But even
then, problems would occur with verifying strong continuity at the origin.
Nonetheless, classical literature supports the view that it is the physical processes, i.e. in
this setting the MNBP, that provides a stochastic representation of the solution to the backward
MNTE. The authors are not aware of a formal proof of this fact. We will nonetheless try to
address this point shortly in Section 2.8. In the mean time, let us present an alternative mild
form of the MNTE (also called a Duhamel solution in the PDE literature) which the semigroup
(t, t  0) more comfortably solves.
Lemma 1. The expectation semigroup (t[g], t  0) is the unique solution in
i=1 L
(D V )
to the mild MNTE
ut(i, r, ) = Ut[g](i, r, ) +
F)uts](i, r, )ds, (2.29)
for t  0, 1  i  m, r  D,   V and g 
i=1 L
(D  V ).
Before proceeding to the proof, let us remark that, in the statement of the theorem, we
are not working with (Ut, t  0) as a c0-semigroup on
i=1 L(D  V ), but a pointwise shift
operator. The reader will recall from the discussion preceding (2.18) that (Ut, t  0) cannot be
defined as such for
i=1 L(D  V ).
Proof of Lemma 1. First suppose we start with an emission of type i. By splitting the expecta-
tion in the definition of t[g] at the first scattering or fission event, and remembering that the
time Dr, defined in (2.16) is deterministic, we have for r  D and   V ,
t[g](i, r, )
i(r+s,)dsg(i, r + t, )1(t<Dr,)
 tDr,
i(r + s, )e
i(r+u,)du
is(r + s, )
i(r + s, )
ts[g](i, r + s, 
)is(r + s, ,

f (r + s, , 
)d

 tDr,
i(r+u,)du(
S i +
F i + 
i)ts[g](i, r + s, )ds, t  0.
Now appealing to an analogue of Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4 in [11] (see also the Appendix of [18]),
we can transfer the exponential integrals in each of the terms on the right-hand side above to a
potential term in the integral as follows
t[g](i, r, ) = g(i, r + t, )1(t<Dr,) +
 tDr,
S i +
F i + 
i)ts[g](i, r + s, )ds
i(r + s, )t[g](i, r, )ds
= g(i, r + t, )1(t<Dr,) +
 tDr,
S i +
F i)ts[g](i, r + s, 
)ds, t  0,
(2.30)
which agrees with (2.29), for 1  i  `.
Following a similar approach, for `+ 1  i  m, r  D, , V , we also get
t[g](i, r, ) = g(i, r, )1(t<Dr,)  i
 tDr,
ts[g](i, r, )ds
 tDr,
ts[g](1, r, 
f (r, , 
)d
= g(i, r, )1(t<Dr,) +
 tDr,
S i +
F i)ts[g](i, r, )ds, t  0, (2.31)
noting in particular that, for `+ 1  i  m,
S i  0. Now putting (2.30) and (2.31) together we
obtain (2.29).
For uniqueness, suppose that ((i)t , t  0), i = 1, 2 are two bounded solutions to (2.29).
Define t[g] := |
t [g] 
t [g]| and note that, for i = 1    , `,
t[g](i, r, ) 
 tDr,

)dds+ C2
 tDr,
ts[g](i, r + s, )ds
(2.32)
for some constants C1, C2  (0,), where the final inequality follows on account of all cross
sections being uniformly bounded.
Now define t[g] = sup1im,rD,V t[g](i, r, ), t  0. From (2.32) we have that
t[g] 
C1 m
Vol(V ) + C2
ts[g]ds. (2.33)
Reversing the order of integration on the right-hand side above and then applying Grnwalls
Lemma allows us to conclude that t[g]  0, which shows uniqueness. A similar argument holds
for i = `+ 1, . . . ,m
2.7 Multi-species neutron random walk and the Many-to-one
Lemma
A second probabilistic perspective for analysing the MNTE is possible but seems rarely to
have been discussed in existing literature, if at all. This consists of collapsing the sum of the
operators
F to take the form
L +diag() for an appropriate choice of , where
L is the
operator which is similar in structure to
S . In essence, this transformation, which we will
describe more rigorously in a moment, heuristically postulates that the operator
F can
be reinterpreted via a Feynman-Kac formula as the infinitesimal generator of a single emission
which undergoes linear transport and scattering and which also accumulates potential .
To describe this more precisely, we need to introduce the notion of a multi-species neutron
random walk (MNRW). In the current setting this means a continuous-time typed random walk
denoted by (Jt, Rt,t), t  0, on {1,    ,m}(DV ) with additional cemetery state {} when it
exits the physical domainD or an emission otherwise disappears from the system. The MNRW is
described by two fundamental quantities (which are functions of the current particle type, spatial
position and velocity). First, a scattering rate i(r, ), i  {1,    ,m}, r  D, ,   V , such
that i(r, ) = i, for i  {` + 1,    ,m}. Second, a scattering probability kernel i,j(r, , ),
i, j  {1,    ,m}, r  D, ,   V . In the spirit of the description of the MNBP, the MNRW is
described as follows.
. When the MNRW is of type i  {1, . . . , `} with configuration (r, ), it moves in a straight line
with velocity  from the point r until one of the following events occur:
 When the MNRW position moves out of D or e.g. it decomposes into an emission type
that is not counted, or is captured in a nucleus, it is instantaneously killed.
 A scattering event occurs and, accordingly, the MNRW keeps the same emission type but
makes an instantaneous change of velocity. If we write T is for the random time until the
next scattering occurs, then,
Pr(T is > t) = exp
i(r + s, )ds
. (2.34)
 When scattering of an emission of type i  {1, . . . , `} occurs at space-velocity (r, ), the
new velocity and type is selected independently with probability i,j(r, , )d.
. Otherwise, if ` + 1  i  m, then the emission remains motionless, i.e. the random walk is
dormant, holding its initial position r, but retaining the velocity  as a mark. After an inde-
pendent and exponentially distributed random time with rate i, the particle transfers its type
to j  {1,    , `} and acquires a new velocity  with probability density i,j(r, , ).
We can associate to the MNRW the infinitesimal generator
L if(r, v) := 1(i`)  f(i, r, )1(rD)
+ i(r, )
[f(j, r, ) f(i, r, )]i,j(r, , )d. (2.35)
for f  Dom(
L) = Dom(
T). We thus refer to the process as an
L-MNRW.
With the notion of the MNRW in hand, let us consider the following algebraic manipula-
tions. For i  {1, . . . , `}, j  {1, . . . ,m}, (r, )  D  V and   V , define
i(r, ) = 1(1i`)
s(r, )
+ 1(1i`)
f(r, )
f (r, , 
)d + 1(i=1)
j=`+1
mj(r, )
+ 1(`+1im)i
f (r, , 
)d, (2.36)
i,j(r, , ) = (i(r, ))1
is(r, )
s(r, , 
)1(1i=j`)
+ if(r, )
f (r, , 
)1(1i,j`) +m
j(r, )1(i=1,j>`))
+ i
f (r, , 
)1(`+1im, j`)
(2.37)
i(r, ) = i(r, ) 1(1i`)
s(r, ) 1(`+1im)i  1(1i`)
f(r, ). (2.38)
Note, in particular, that for each fixed 1  i  m, r  D and   V , i,j(r, , ) is a probability
distribution on {1,    ,m}  V in the sense that
i,j(r, , )d = 1. Note also that
the assumption
f (r, , 
)d  0 ensures that i  0, for 1  i  m.
With simple algebra, we may now identify
F)f(r, ) =
Lf(r, ) + diag()f(r, ) (2.39)
where f  Dom(
A) (for which it was remarked earlier that it is equal to Dom(
T)), and
given by (2.35).
Heuristically speaking, we have algebraically gathered all of the operators into the in-
finitesimal generator of an
L-MNRW and local potential . This has the attraction of leading us
the aforementioned single emission representation of the solution to the MNTE using a single-
emission Feynman-Kac representation. Said another way, this means that one would expect
that, in the appropriate sense, the solution to the NTE to be represented in the form
t[g](i, r, ) = E(i,r,)
Js (Rs,s)dsg(Jt, Rt,t)1(t<D)
, (2.40)
for t  0, 1  i  m, r  D,   V . Here P(i,r,v) is the law of the
L-MNRW starting from a
single emission with configuration (i, r, ), and E(i,r,v) is the corresponding expectation operator.
Appealing to the Markov property for (J,R,), it is not difficult to show that a semigroup
property similar to (2.28) holds. That is to say, for s, t  0, 1  i  m, r  D,   V
s+t[g](i, r, ) = s[t[g]](i, r, ).
Similarly to the case of (t[g], t  0), if we put g in the smaller space
+(D  V )) then
we also have limt0 t[g] = g in the pointwise sense, but otherwise strong continuity at t = 0
is unclear. Note also that, since all cross sections are uniformly bounded, then so is  (in all of
its variables) by a constant, say . Hence, for g 
i=1 L(D  V ), t[g]  g exp(t),
t  0. As with the case of (t[g], t  0), the notion that (t[g], t  0) solves (2.13) is not a
straightforward claim. Nonetheless, as one might expect, these two expectation semigroups are
equal and we can see this by relating back to (2.29).
Indeed, by conditioning the expectation in the definition of t[g] on the first scattering
event, and then appealing to the Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4 in [11] in a similar manner to what was
done in the proof of Lemma 1, one easily deduces the below result. In the the spatial branching
process literature, this would be called a many-to-one lemma.
Lemma 2. For g 
i=1 L
(D  V ), the two expectation semigroups (t[g], t  0) and
(t[g], t  0) agree.
2.8 Consolidating the ACP with the expectation semigroup
We want to understand how the
i=1 L2(D  V ) semigroup (Vt, t  0) that represents the
unique solution to the Abstract Cauchy Problem (2.13) relates to the expectation semigroups
(t, t  0) and (t, t  0) that offer two different stochastic representations to the mild equation
(2.29).
We start by noting that if g 
i=1 L
(D  V ), then, on account of the fact that
i=1(D  V )) = (
DV drd)
m < , we also have g 
i=1 L2(D  V ). Since it is
unclear whether (t[g], t  0) is well defined for all g 
i=1 L2(D  V ), it makes sense to
consider the comparison with (Vt[g], t  0) (defined in (2.14)) for the more restrictive choice
i=1 L(D  V ). The natural setting in which to make the comparison is in the spacem
i=1 L2(DV ) as, by (2.25), t[g] < and the latter implies t[g]2 <, again thanks
to the fact that Vol(
i=1(D  V )) <.
Theorem 5. If g 
i=1 L
(D  V ) then, for t  0, Vt[g] = t[g] on
i=1 L2(D  V ), i.e.
Vt[g] t[g]2 = 0.
Before moving to its proof, the reader should take care to note that this does not imply
that (Vt, t  0) and (t, t  0) agree as c0-semigroups on
i=1 L2(D  V ). In particular,
the comparison between the two semigroup operators is only made on
i=1 L2(D  V ), and
(t, t  0) was not (and in fact cannot be) shown to demonstrate the strong continuity property
i=1 L2(D  V ).
Remark 2. If we consider Theorem 5 in light of Theorem 3, noting that (t[g], t  0) is a
uniformly bounded sequence, it is tempting to want to say that the leading eigenfunction 
belongs to
i=1 L(D  V ). This is not the case necessarily and remains to be proved. In the
setting of a single type of emission, this will be demonstrated in the forthcoming paper [15].
Proof of Theorem 5. Consider the adjusted ACP with inhomogeneity given by
Tut + (
F)Vt[g]
u0 = g
(2.41)
By taking the difference of two solutions and invoking the uniqueness of the ACP in
i=1 L2(D
V ) with initial data g = 0 2, we note that the solution to (2.41) is unique in
i=1 L2(D  V ).
However, on the one hand, it is straightforward to verify that
ut := e
T g +
e(ts)
F)Vs[g]ds, t  0,
solves (2.41). On the other hand, taking account of the fact that (Vt[g], t  0) solves (2.13), it
is also the case that taking
ut := Vt[g], t  0,
also gives a solution to (2.41). Uniqueness thus tells us that on
i=1 L2(D  V ),
Vt[g] = Ut[g] +
e(ts)
F)Vs[g]ds = Ut[g] +
F)Vts[g]]ds, t  0,
where in the second equality we have reversed the direction of integration. In conclusion, whereas
(t[g], t  0) solves (2.29) in the pointwise sense, (Vt[g], t  0) solves it in the
i=1 L2(D  V )
sense.
On the other hand, we know that (t[g], t  0) is valued in
i=1 L2(D  V ), hence we
can consider,
t[g] Vt[g]2 =
F){ts[g] Vts[g]}]ds
, t  0.
To conclude the theorem, let us note that, for T > 0, and wt 
i=1 L2(DV ), t  T , we have
2
ws(r, )
ws(r, )
ws22ds, t  T, (2.42)
where in the first inequality we have used Jensens inequality and Cauchy-Schwarz in the second.
Moreover, for f 
i=1 L2(D  V ),
Us[f ]22 =
1(s<Dr,)f(i, r + s, )
2drd
f(i, r, )2drd
= f22 (2.43)
where the inequality follows as a consequence that, for each , the integral
1(s<Dr,)v(i, r +
s, )2dr integrates over a subdomain of D. Also, we have for the operator
S (and similarly for
F), for f 
i=1 L2(D  V ),
S + diag(s))f2 =
f(i, r, )s(r, )
s(r, , 
)d
f(i, r, ) 1 d
Vol(V )
f(i, r, )2ddr
 C max
1im
Vol(V )f2, (2.44)
where the constant C appears by upper estimating the uniformly bounded cross sections and in
the second inequality we have used Cauchy-Schwarz.
It thus follows from (2.42), (2.43) and (2.44) that, for t  T , writing t = t[g]  Vt[g],
t  0,
t22 =
F)ts]ds
2
Us[(

F + diag() diag())s22ds
S + diag(s))s2 + (
F + diag(f))s2 + diag()s2
 C 
s22ds, t  T, (2.45)
where the constant C  comes from the fact that  is uniformly bounded. The final inequality
in (2.45) together with Grnwalls Lemma now tells us that t2 = 0, for all t  T . Since
T is chosen arbitrarily, it follows that (t[g], t  0) and (Vt[g], t  0) are indistinguishable inm
i=1 L2(D  V ).
The conclusion of this section is that it is not unreasonable to now understand the expec-
tation semigroups (t[g], t  0) and (t[g], t  0) for non-negative, bounded and measurable g
on DV as the solution to the MNTE in place of (Vt[g], t  0) for the same class of g. Indeed,
the two agree both in
i=1 L2(D  V ) and hence (dr  d)-Lebesgue almost everywhere.
The reader will also note that from the perspective of Monte Carlo simulation, the expec-
tation semigroup (t[g], t  0) carries the potential to be exploited in a way that (t[g], t  0)
cannot. More precisely, where branching trees are difficult to simulate and are not convenient
for Monte Carlo computational parallelisation, random walks are. This simple idea is explored
in greater detail in the accompanying paper to this one [5].
2.9 Asymptotic behaviour of the MNTE: Proof of Theorem 3
In this section we return to the fundamental notion that the solution to the MNTE in the form
(2.13) is described by its leading asymptotics for large times. That is to say, we give the proof
of Theorem 3. Our proof follows closely ideas found in Chapters 4 and 5 of [27].
Recall that the quantities i, i,j , i, i, j = 1,    ,m were defined in (2.36), (2.37) and
(2.38) respectively. They were arranged into the operator

For j = 1, . . . ,m, let us introduce the operators Ki,j on L2(D  V ) by
Ki,jf(r, ) = 
i(r, )
f(r, )i,j(r, , )d.
These are integral operators, which take the form
Ki,jf(r, ) =
f(r, )ki,j(r, , 
)d
on D  V  V , where
ki,j(r, , 
) = is
s(r, , 
) + if
f (r, , 
). (2.46)
A similar computation to (2.44) also shows that Ki,jg  L2(D V ) when g  L2(D V ). Then
from (2.9) and (2.37), taking care to note the use of the indicators for the inclusion of terms for
different indices, we can write, for 1  i  `, for g  Dom(
A ig(i, r, ) =
T ig(i, r, ) i(r, )g(i, r, )
Ki,jg(j, r, ) + 1(i=1)
1(r, )
j=`+1
mj(r, )g(j, r, ) (2.47)
Moreover, for `+ 1  i  m,
A ig(i, r, ) = ig(i, r, ) +
Ki,jg(j, r, ) (2.48)
With this notation, write
T = diag(
T1  1,    ,
T `  `),
 = diag(`+1, . . . , m),
K = (Ki,j), for i, j = 1, . . . , `,
M = (Mi,j), where Mi,j = 1(r, )mj(r, )1(i=1), for i = 1, . . . , `, j = `+ 1, . . . ,m,
K = (Ki,j), for i = `+ 1, . . . ,m, j = 1, . . . , `.
Then the abstract Cauchy problem (2.13) on
j=1 L2(D  V ) may now be written in matrix
ut = Aut, t  0.
where A = T + K and
and K =
The matrix T is an operator on
i=1 L2(D  V )) with domain
Dom(T ) =

which generates the strongly continuous (or c0-) semigroup (UTt , t  0) given by
UTt [g] =
i(r+s,)dsUt[g] 1  i  `
eitg `+ 1  i  m,
(2.49)
for g 
i=1 L2(D  V )).
In order to prove Theorem 3, we consider a different operator that is related to A as
follows. Consider the eigenvalue problem
A = ,  > `+1, (2.50)
for  
i=1 L2(D  V ). Write
() = ((1, ),    , (`, )) and () = ((`+ 1, ),    , (m, ))
so that  is the concatenation (, ). Separating this into prompt and delayed initial emissions,
it can be written as
T + K + M = 
Im` =  + K,
where Im` is the (m `) (m `) identity matrix. Rearranging the second equation, we get
 = (Im` + )
1K
 (2.51)
and substituting this into the first equation,
(I`  T)1K() =  where K() = K + M(Im` + )1K. (2.52)
Our strategy is to show that there exists a c such that (cI`T)1K(c) has a leading eigenvalue
1, and that this is equivalent to c being an eigenvalue of A. The tool we shall use to do this is
the Krein-Rutman Theorem, which we recall here for convenience in a format that is appropriate
for our use; c.f. [7, p. 286].
Theorem 6 (Krein-Rutman Theorem). Let X be a Banach space and suppose it contains a
convex cone C such that C  C := {h = f  g : f, g  C} is dense in X. Suppose L is a
positive compact linear operator on X such that r(L) := sup{|| :   (L)} > 0, where (L) is
the spectrum of the operator L. Then r(L) is an eigenvalue of L with a corresponding positive
eigenfunction.
Our proof of Theorem 3 requires the following intermediary result below. Before stating
it, the reader is reminded that `+1,    , m are arranged so that `+1 is the smallest. Thus, the
condition  > `+1 ensures that K() is well defined. In particular, (Im` + ) is invertible.
Proposition 1. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3, for each  > `+1, r
(I`T)1K()
is the leading eigenvalue of (I`  T)1K() with a corresponding positive eigenfunction .
Proof. In relation to the Krein-Rutman theorem stated above, our Banach space is X =m
i=1 L2(D  V ) and the corresponding cone is C =
i=1 L
2 (D  V ). It is clear that this
cone is convex, and since every L2 function can be written as the difference of its positive and
negative parts, C satisfies the assumptions of the theorem. We now break the rest of the proof
into a number of steps which are stated with a proof immediately afterwards.
Step 1. First we claim that (I`  T)1K() is a compact operator.
Fix 1  i, j  m. By Fubinis Theorem we have that r 7 Ki,jf(r, ) is measurable for
g  L2(D  V ). The operators Ki,j are also integral operators and therefore are continuous on
L2(V ) and compact. The assumed piecewise continuity of the cross sections is
s and 
and the boundedness of the domain V is sufficient to ensure that r 7 Ki,j  (r, ) is piecewise
continuous under the operator norm from L2(D  V ) to L2(V ) and hence {Ki,j  (r, ) : r  D}
forms a relatively compact set in the space of linear operators on L2(V ). With these properties,
the mapping r 7 Ki,j  (r, ), for r  D, is said to be regular. One similarly (but more easily)
shows that r 7 Mi,j  (r, ) is regular for r  D as operators on L2(V ). By linearity, this implies
that, for 1  i, j  `, the mapping r 7 K()i,j is also regular. We now conclude by [27,
Theorem 4.1], which we state here for convenience.
Theorem. Let 1 < p <  and let D be bounded and convex. We assume that d is such
that the hyperplanes have zero d-measure and that the collision operator K is regular. Then
K(I  T )1 and (I  T )1K are compact in Lp(D  V,dxd).
In this case d is Lebesgue measure on V so the condition on the hyperplanes is satisfied.
Hence, due to the above analysis (I`  T)1K() is a compact operator.
Remark 3. It is precisely at the application of [27, Theorem 4.1] that we need the convexity
of the domain D, as this is required within the aforesaid result.
Step 2. Next we show that (I`  T)1K() is a positive irreducible operator.
Positivity is a straightforward consequence of the assumptions on the operators Ki,j and
the form of the semigroup defined in (2.49). For irreducibility, it is enough to show that there
exists an integer n  1 such that [(I`  T)1K()]nf > 0 for each f 
i=1 L
2 (D  V ), cf.
[1]. Note, this latter property is the definition for (I`  T)1K() to be positivity improving.
To this end, note that due to (2.52), the entries of K()(I`  T)1K() satisfy
[K()(I`  T)1K()]i,j  [K(I`  T)1K]i,j =
Ki,k(I`  T)1k,kKk,j ,
and that Ki,k(I`T)1k,kKk,j is an integral operator L2(DV ) L2(DV ), 1  i, j  `, whose
kernel is greater than or equal to 
e+
k( rr
))tki,k
r  r
, v
r, v,
r  r
, (2.53)
where k(v) = infrD{k(r, )}. Note, in order to produce this estimate, the reader will note
that (I`  T)1k,k is the resolvent of (U
t , t  0) in (2.49). If we choose the index k as in the
assumptions (2.19) and (2.20) then the lower bound (2.53) ensures that [K()(I`T)1K()]i,j
is positivity improving. It follows that [(I`  T)1K()]2 is also positivity improving and
therefore (I`  T)1K() is irreducible.
Step 3. We claim that there exists a non-negative eigenfunction 0 6=  
i=1 L2(DV )
for the operator (I`  T)1K() with eigenvalue that agrees with r
(I`  T)1K()
We use de Pagters Theorem, cf. [9], which says that the spectral radius of a positive,
compact, irreducible operator is strictly positive; that is to say r
(I`  T)1K()
> 0. In
turn the Krein-Rutman Theorem 6 states that r
(I` T)1K()
is thus an eigenvalue for the
operator (I`  T)1K() with a corresponding non-negative eigenfunction .
Proof of Theorem 3. (i) In looking for a non-negative eigenfunction of
A with real eigenvalue,
our earlier discussion tells us we must equivalently look for a solution to (2.50) and hence (2.52).
This is equivalent to finding a real value c such that r
(cI`  T)1K(c)
= 1. We again
achieve this goal in steps.
Step 1. We want to show that
`+1
(I`  T)1K()
=. (2.54)
Recall that (I` T)1K() is compact and irreducible so by [27, Theorem 5.13] we have
the comparison of the spectral radii,
(I`  T)1K()
(I`  T)1[K()]
, (2.55)
where [K()] is the matrix whose entries are given by [K()] = diag(K()1,1,    , K()`,`).
Suppose  is an `  ` whose diagonal entries are given by operators i on L2(D  V ),
for i = 1,    , `. If   (1), the spectrum of 1, then (I` )1,1 is not invertible, and so
I`   is also not invertible. Hence   (), the spectrum of , and so (1)  ().
Applying this argument to the diagonal matrix (I`  T)1K(), we have that
([(I`  T)1K()]1,1)  ((I`  T)1K()) (2.56)
and so
(I`  T)1K()
[(I`  T)1K()]1,1
T1  1)1[K()]1,1
. (2.57)
where, in the final inequality, we have used (2.56).
Next recall that (I`  T)1K() =  where K() = K + M(Im` + )1K. Similar
reasoning to the proofs of previous steps shows us that (
T11)1[K()]1,1 and (
1)11fm
`+1(K)1,`+1 are both compact and irreducible operators, so that
T1  1)1[K()]1,1
T1  1)11fm`+1(K)1,`+1
+ `+1
> 0, (2.58)
where the first inequality follows from [27, Theorem 5.13] and the second follows from [27,
Theorem 5.7]. Combining (2.55), (2.57) and (2.58), we have
(I`  T)1K()
T1  1)11fm`+1(K)1,`+1
+ `+1
with the latter term tending to  as  `+1.
Step 2. Next we need to show that
(I`  T)1K()
The spectral radius r
(I`  T)1K()
as is K(). Using the standard operator norm
2 on
i=1 L2(D  V ),
K()g2 = M
(+ `+1)
1,    , (+ m)1
Kg2
and, hence, by inspection, K() is decreasing with  and tends to K as . Note, moreover,
that for all g 
i=1 L2(D  V ),
(I`  T)1K()g =
etf, UTt [K
()g]dt,
showing similarly that (I`  T)1K() is decreasing in . Due to [27, Lemma 8.1] (note that
it is not difficult to see from the proof of that lemma that that the order of the operators there
can be reversed), we have
(I`  T)1K()
Step 3. In this penultimate step, we show that we have found a non-negative function of
A , with eigenvalue c.
We have the existence of a c > `+1 such that r((I` T)1K()) = 1. That is to say,
thanks to Proposition 1, we have found  = c which solves (2.52), which in turn, thanks to
(2.51) gives us that  = (Im` + )1Kc so that with the concatenation
 = (c , (cIm` + )
1K
)  0
we have the eigensolution
A = c.
which is equivalent to
A = c.
Step 4. For the final step we need to show that c is the leading real eigenvalue of
A , i.e.
c = s(A) := sup{Re() :   (A)},
where (A) is the spectrum of the operator A or equivalently of
A . Moreover we need to show
that it is simple and isolated.
We first note that since we have shown that c  (A), in particular that the spectrum
is non-empty, it follows from [27, Theorem 5.2] that s(A)  (A). Now suppose that c 6=
s(A) so that, in particular, c < s(A). Then, thanks again to [27, Lemma 8.1], r
(s(A)I` 
T)1K(s(A))
< 1 and so 1 is not an eigenvalue of (s(A)I`  T)1K(s(A)). Said another way,
this means that s(A) is not an eigenvalue of A (and hence of
A), leading to a contradiction.
Algebraic and geometric simplicity of c follows from [7, Remark 12] and [7, Theorem 7(iii)],
respectively.
Before turning to the proof of Theorem 3 (ii), we must state another intermediary result
which is translated from a general setting of Banach operators to our current situation; cf. [27,
Theorem 4.1] and [1, p. 359, Theorem 22].
Proposition 2. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3
(A)  {Re() :  > s(T )}
consists of isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicities, where s(T ) := sup{Re() :   (T )}.
Note the Theorem from which the above proposition is derived in [1, p. 359, Theorem 22]
requires as a sufficient condition that (I  T )1K is compact, where I is an m m identity
matrix. This fact easily follows from the conclusion in Step 1 of the proof of Proposition 1.
Finally we can complete the proof of Theorem 3
Proof of Theorem 3. (ii) It is also easy from the structure of T that `+1,    ,m, belong
to its spectrum. Moreover, for all i = 1,    , `, s(
T i  i) = . Since `+1 is the largest
of these eigenvalues, and c > `+1 (from part (i) of Theorem 3), Proposition 2 tells us that
(A)  { : Re() > `+1} contains at least one isolated eigenvalue with finite (algebraic)
multiplicity (i.e. the lead eigenvalue c).
Suppose we enumerate the eigenvalues in (A){ : Re() > `+1} in decreasing order
by the set {(1),    , (n)} (noting from earlier that we have at least (1) = c and (n) > `+1).
Then, from [7, p. 265], for g  Dom(
A), we have
Vt[g] =
order((k))1
tmmk [g]
+O(e`+1t),
as t, where k are projectors in Dom(
We are really only interested in the projection onto the eigenfunction that we know exists
in the real part of the spectrum. The projector 1 can be written in the form
1[g] = g, , g 
L2(D  V ),
where  is the left-eigenfunction with eigenvalue c, which is guaranteed to exist by examining
the preceding arguments for
A and re-applying them for
F , the adjoint operator
A . Hence, we have the following leading order expansion,
Vt[f ] = e
ct(f, )+O(e[
(2)(`+1)]t).
Note that since, according to Proposition 2, c is isolated, there exists a  > 0 such that
(2)  (`+1) < c  , where we understand (2) =  if n = 1. The statement of part (ii)
of Theorem 3 now follows.

Concluding remarks
In this chapter we have addressed both the classical PDE perspective and the probabilistic
branching perspective of the neutron transport equation, and consolidated these approaches in
an appropriate sense. This will allow us to work with both approaches in later chapters.
We then considered a multi-type neutron transport equation that takes into account the
full range of emissions associated with fission processes. Exploiting methods from spectral theory,
we were then able to prove the existence of the leading eigenelements of this multi-type model,
in the classical sense.
In the next chapter, we will focus on the branching process associated with the neutron
transport equation, in order to answer the same questions but with probabilistic techniques.

Abstract
The Neutron Transport Equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons through an inhomoge-
neous fissile medium. In this paper, we reconnect the NTE to the physical model of the spatial
Markov branching process which describes the process of nuclear fission, transport, scattering,
and absorption. By reformulating the NTE in its mild form and identifying its solution as an
expectation semigroup, we use modern techniques to develop a Perron-Frbenius (PF) type de-
composition, showing that growth is dominated by a leading eigenfunction and its associated
left and right eigenfunctions. In the spirit of results for spatial branching and fragmentation
processes, we use our PF decomposition to show the existence of an intrinsic martingale and
associated spine decomposition. Moreover, we show how criticality in the PF decomposition dic-
tates the convergence of the intrinsic martingale. The mathematical difficulties in this context
come about through unusual piecewise deterministic motion of particles coupled with an infinite
type-space which is taken as neutron velocity. The fundamental nature of our PF decomposition
also plays out in accompanying work [20, 9].

second). Neutron flux is described as a function of time, t, Euclidian location, r, direction, 
and neutron energy E. It is not uncommon in the physics literature to assume that velocity
is a function of both direction and energy, thereby reducing the number of variables by one.
This allows us to describe the dependency of flux more simply in terms of time and, what we
call, the configuration variables (r, v)  D  V where D  R3 is a non-empty, open, smooth,
bounded and convex domain such that D has zero Lebesgue measure, and V is the velocity
space, which we take to be the three dimensional annulus V = {  R3 : vmin  ||  vmax},
where 0 < vmin < vmax <.

where the different components (or cross-sections as they are known in the nuclear physics
literature) have the following interpretation:
s(r, ) : the rate at which scattering occurs from incoming velocity ,
f(r, ) : the rate at which fission occurs from incoming velocity ,
(r, ) : the sum of the rates f + s and is known as the total cross section,
s(r, , 
)d : the scattering yield at velocity  from incoming velocity ,
satisfying
s(r, , 
)d = 1, and
f(r, , 
)d : the neutron yield at velocity  from fission with incoming velocity ,
satisfying
f(r, , 
)d <.
Some or all of the three assumptions below will be used from time to time in our main results.
(H1): Cross-sections s, f, s and f are uniformly bounded away from infinity.
(H2): We have ss + ff > 0 on D  V  V .
(H3): There is an open ball B compactly embedded in D such that ff > 0
on B  V  V .
It is also usual to insist on the physical boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr > 0,
(3.2)
where nr is the outward unit normal at r  D and g : D  V  [0,) is a bounded,
measurable function on which we will later impose further conditions. Physically, these boundary
conditions mean that any neutron starting on the boundary of the reactor with velocity pointing
outwards will be killed.
Formally speaking, (3.1) as stated is ill defined (because of regularity issues associated to
the transport operator   ) and has traditionally otherwise appeared in applied mathematics
and physics literature in the form of an abstract Cauchy problem on L2(D  V ), the space of
square integrable functions on D  V . This has formed the principle historical outlook of the
analysis of the NTE, appealing to c0-semigroup theory; see for example the classical works of
[13, 29, 31, 30, 26, 2, 39, 11, 12, 37, 22, 28, 38].
The connection of the NTE via semigroup theory to an underlying stochastic process
has, in contrast, received a very limited amount of attention; cf [11, 28, 33]. Accordingly the
stochastic analysis of (3.1) has seen very little development in light of recent innovations in the
relevant theory of stochastic processes.
In the current article, we are more interested in exploring how NTE can be interpreted as
a mild equation, describing the mean semigroup evolution of the stochastic process that models
the underlying physical process of neutron fission, transport, scatter and absorption. More
precisely, we have two main contributions: (i) to develop a new precise statement of the form
t  etcg+ o(et), where  and  are a leading eigenvalue and eigenfunction associated to
the NTE and cg is a constant that depends on the initial data g; (ii) to make the first step in
understanding how the growth of the solution to the NTE relative to its lead eigenfunction plays
out in terms of the aforementioned physical stochastic process and an associated martingale.
This paper follows the review article [10] which consolidates the existing c0-semigroup
approach and how it relates to the stochastic representation. A deeper subsequent analysis
in the direction of our second objective is continued in the accompanying paper [20]. Further
numerical and Monte-Carlo considerations based on our stochastic approach will also appear in
forthcoming work [9].
In order to consider the probabilistic perspective, we start by defining the underlying
stochastic processes which mimics the physics of neutron fission, transport, scattering and ab-
sorption.
3.2 The physical process and the mild NTE
Consider a neutron branching process (NBP), which at time t  0 is represented by a config-
uration of particles which are specified via their physical location and velocity in D  V , say
{(ri(t), i(t)) : i = 1, . . . , Nt}, where Nt is the number of particles alive at time t  0. In order
to describe the process, we will represent it as a process in the space of finite atomic measures
Xt(A) =
(ri(t),i(t))(A), A  B(D  V ), t  0,
where  is the Dirac measure, defined on B(D V ), the Borel subsets of D V . The evolution
of (Xt, t  0) is a stochastic process valued in the space of atomic measures M(D  V ) :=
i=1(ri,i) : n  N, (ri, i)  D  V, i = 1,    , n} which evolves randomly as follows.
A particle positioned at r with velocity  will continue to move along the trajectory r+t,
until one of the following things happens.
(i) The particle leaves the physical domain D, in which case it is instantaneously killed.
(ii) Independently of all other neutrons, a scattering event occurs when a neutron comes in
close proximity to an atomic nucleus and, accordingly, makes an instantaneous change
of velocity. For a neutron in the system with position and velocity (r, ), if we write Ts
for the random time that scattering may occur, then independently of any other physical
event that may affect the neutron, Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
s(r + s, )ds}, for t  0.
When scattering occurs at space-velocity (r, ), the new velocity is selected in V indepen-
dently with probability s(r, , )d.
(iii) Independently of all other neutrons, a fission event occurs when a neutron smashes into
an atomic nucleus. For a neutron in the system with initial position and velocity (r, ), if
we write Tf for the random time that fission may occur, then independently of any other
physical event that may affect the neutron, Pr(Tf > t) = exp{
f(r + s, )ds}, for
t  0.
When fission occurs, the smashing of the atomic nucleus produces lower mass isotopes
and releases a random number of neutrons, say N  0, which are ejected from the point
of impact with randomly distributed, and possibly correlated, velocities, say (i : i =
1,    , N). The outgoing velocities are described by the atomic random measure
Z(A) :=
i(A), A  B(V ). (3.3)
When fission occurs at location r  Rd from a particle with incoming velocity   V ,
we denote by P(r,) the law of Z. The probabilities P(r,) are such that, for   V , for
bounded and measurable g : V  [0,),
g()f(r, v, 
)d = E(r,)
g()Z(d)
=: E(r,)[g,Z]. (3.4)
Note, the possibility that Pr(N = 0) > 0, which will be tantamount to neutron capture
(that is, where a neutron slams into a nucleus but no fission results and the neutron is
absorbed into the nucleus).
In essence, one may think of the process X := (Xt, t  0) as a typed spatial Markov
branching process, where the type of each particle is the velocity   V and the underlying
Markov motion is nothing more than movement in a straight line at velocity .
Remark 5. It is worth noting how the assumptions (H1)-(H3) play out in the construction of the
NBP. Whilst they serve as a sufficient conditions, they are not necessary. For example, one could
equally assume that e.g. there are two open domains Bs and Bf (which may or may not intersect)
contained in D on which s(r, )s(r, , ) > 0, for Bs  V  V and f(r, )f(r, , ) > 0, for
Bf  V  V , respectively. This would ensure that, at least starting from some configurations
(r, )  D  V , the NBP could access regions where scatter or fission occurs with positive
probability. From there, the particle system will thus propagate by allowing further opportunities
for scatter or fission. That said, there will also be some initial configurations (r, )  D V for
which the particles will neither scatter nor undergo fission and head straight for the boundary
D, whereupon they are killed.
This example informally alerts us to the notion of irreducibility of the state space. For
contrast, and to highlight the issue further, it is worth comparing the situation to e.g. a branch-
ing Brownian motion on a smooth, convex, bounded domain of D  Rd for which the branching
rate is supported only on a subdomain B strictly contained in D. In that setting, the Brownian
motion of a given particle would always be able to find the region B with positive probabil-
ity, where branching can occur (thus propagating the stochastic process in a non-trivial way).
Through this comparison, we see that the piecewise linear spatial paths of neutrons in the NBP,
although simpler to depict than the path of a Brownian motion, are significantly more irregular.
The assumption (H2) may be thus be thought of as a sufficient condition to ensure irreducibility
of the state space by enforcing the possibility of either scatter or fission (but not necessarily the
possibility of both), whereas assumption (H3) ensures that there is at least one area of the do-
main where fission occurs. The condition (H1) simply ensures that activity (scatter and fission)
cannot happen too fast, and hence the eventuality of explosion in finite time does not appear in
our forthcoming calculations.
Remark 6. The NBP is parameterised by the quantities s, s, f and the family of measures
P = (P(r,), r  D,   V ) and accordingly we refer to it as a (s, s, f,P)-NBP. It is associated
to the NTE via the relation (3.4), and, although a (s, s, f,P)-NBP is uniquely defined, a
NBP specified by (s, s, f, f) alone is not.
What is of importance for the purpose of our analysis, however, is that for the given
quadruple (s, s, f, f), at least one (s, s, f,P)-NBP exists such that (3.4) holds. It is
relatively easy to construct an example of P as such.
Indeed, let us suppose (H1) and (H3) hold. Then, for a given f, define
nmax = min{k  1 : sup(r,)DV
f(r, , 
)d  k}.
Define the ensemble (i, i = 1,    , N) such that: (i) N  {0, nmax}; (ii) the probability
of the event {N = nmax} under P(r,) is given by
f(r, , 
)d/nmax; (iii) on the event
{N = nmax}, each of the nmax neutrons are released with the same velocities 1 =    = nmax ;
(iv) the distribution of this common velocity is given by
P(r,)(i  d
|N = nmax) =
f(r, , 
f(r, , )d
for i = 1, . . . , nmax.
With the construction (i)-(iv) for P(r,), we have for bounded and measurable g : V 
[0,),
g()f(r, v, 
)d
1 P(r,)(N = nmax)
+ P(r,)(N = nmax)nmax
g()P(r,)(i  d
|N = nmax)
f(r, , 
)d
g()
f(r, , 
f(r, , )d
g()f(r, v, 
)d,
thus matching (3.4), as required.
It is interesting to note that the construction above is precisely what happens in industrial
models of nuclear reactor cores (for which only the cross-sections (s, s, f, f) are known)
when it comes to Monte-Carlo simulation; see further discussion below as well as [9].
The maximum number of neutrons that can be emitted during a fission event with positive
probability is finite. For example in an environment where the heaviest nucleus is Uranium-235,
there are at most 143 neutrons that can be released in a fission event, albeit, in reality it is more
likely that 2 or 3 are released. We will thus occasionally work with:
(H4): Fission offspring are bounded in number by the constant nmax > 1.
In particular this means that suprD,V
f(r, , 
)d  nmax.
Write P(r,) for the the law of X when issued from a single particle with space-velocity
configuration (r, )  D  V . More generally, for   M(D  V ), we understand P :=
P(r1,1)      P(rn,n) when  =
i=1(ri,i). In other words, the process X when issued from
initial configuration  is equivalent to issuing n independent copies of X, each with configuration
(ri, i), i = 1,    , n.
Like all spatial Markov branching processes, (X,P), where P := (P,   M(D  V )),
respects the Markov branching property with respect to the filtration Ft := ((ri(s), i(s)) : i =
1,    , Ns, s  t), t  0. That is to say, for all bounded and measurable g : D V  [0,) and
  M(D  V ) written  =
i=1 (ri,i), we have E[
i=1 g(ri(t), i(t))] =
i=1 ut[g](ri, i),
for t  0, r  D,   V, where ut[g](r, ) := E(r,) [
i=1 g(ri(t), i(t))]. In this setting it is also
customary to work with the notion that the empty product is valued as unity; see [23, 24, 25].
What is of particular interest to us in the context of the NTE is the expectation semigroup of
the neutron branching process. More precisely, and with pre-emptive notation, we are interested
t[g](r, ) := E(r,) [g,Xt], t  0, r  D,   V, (3.5)
for g  L+(D  V ), the space of non-negative uniformly bounded measurable functions on
D  V . Here we have made a slight abuse of notation (see ,  as it appears in (3.4)) and
written g,Xt to mean
DV g(r, )Xt(dr, d).
To see why (t, t  0) deserves the name of expectation semigroup, it is a straightforward
exercise with the help of the Markov branching property to show that
t+s[g](r, ) = t[s[g]](r, ) s, t  0. (3.6)
The connection of the expectation semigroup (3.5) with the NTE (3.1) was explored in
the recent article [10] (see also older work in [11, 28]). In order to present the relevant findings,
let us momentarily introduce some notation. The deterministic evolution Ut[g](r, ) = g(r +
t, )1{t<Dr,}, t  0, and 
r, := inf{t > 0 : r + t 6 D}, represents the advection semigroup
associated with a single neutron travelling at velocity  from r. The backwards scatter operator
is denoted by
Sf(r, ) = s(r, )
f(r, )s(r, , 
)d  s(r, )f(r, ) (3.7)
and the backwards fission operator is given by
Ff(r, ) = f(r, )
f(r, )f(r, , 
)d  f(r, )f(r, ), (3.8)
for f  L+(D  V ), such that both
S and
F are defined on D  V and zero otherwise.
Lemma 3 ([10]). Under (H1) and (H2), for g  L+(D  V ), there exist constants C1, C2 > 0
such that t[g], as given in (3.5), is uniformly bounded by C1 exp(C2t), for all t  0. Moreover,
(t[g], t  0) is the unique solution to the so-called mild equation (also called a Duhamel solution
in the PDE literature):
t[g] = Ut[g] +
F)ts[g]]ds, t  0, (3.9)
for which (3.2) holds.
The fact that (3.5) solves (3.9) is a simple matter of conditioning the expression in (3.5) on
the first fission or scatter event (whichever occurs first) and rearranging the resulting equation.
Uniqueness is a matter of working in the right way with Grnwalls Lemma. The association of
(3.9) with (3.1) in this way was also explored in Theorem 7.1 [10], where it was shown that the
unique solution to (3.1) when seen as an abstract Cauchy problem on L2(D  V ) agrees with
the unique solution to (3.9) in the L2(D  V ) norm.
The reader should note that we do not need (H3) or (H4) as the result does not require
information about the pathwise behaviour of any associated underlying stochastic processes.
Nor does it distinguish between the settings that
F is present or not.
3.3 Perron-Frobenius asymptotics
As alluded to above, one of the classical ways in which neutron flux is understood is to look for
the leading eigenvalue and associated ground state eigenfunction. Roughly speaking, this means
looking for an associated triple of eigenvalue   R, positive right eigenfunction  : D  V 
[0,), a left eigenmeasure (r, )drd on DV in L+2 (DV ) (the cone of non-negative square
integrable functions on D  V ) such that f, t[] = etf,  and , t[f ] = et, f, for
t  0. Here, we again abuse our notation (see the use of ,  in (3.4) and (3.5)) and write, for
f, g  L+2 (DV ), f, g =
DV f(r, )g(r, )drd.With the eigentriple in hand, it is a common
point of analysis that, to leading order, the NTE (3.1) is solved through the approximation
t(r, ) = e
tg, (r, ) + o(et), t  0, r  D,   V, (3.10)
where the sense of the equality depends on how one interprets the NTE (i.e. as an abstract
Cauchy problem or in its mild form).
Figure 3-1: Zooming into a virtual model of a pebble bed nuclear reactor core made from tennis
ball sized orbs which encapsulate uranium pellets. From left to right, the diagrams illustrate
detail from metres down to millimetres. Colour indicates the different regions in which the cross
sections s, f, s, f are constant. The structural design of such a reactor can easily be stored
as a virtual environment (i.e. storing the coordinates of the different geometrical domains and
the material properties in each domain) with just circa 150MB of data, on to which extensive
data libraries of industrial numerical values for the respective quantities s, f, s, f can be
mapped.
The eigenfunction  is called the importance map and offers a quasi-stationary profile of
radioactive activity (unless  = 0, in which case it is a stationary profile). Indeed, in modern
nuclear reactor design and safety regulation, it is usually the case that virtual reactor models
such as the one seen in Figure 3-1 (an example of a uranium pebble bed reactor) are designed
such that  = 0 and the behaviour of  within spatial domains on the human scale remains
within regulated levels. Existing physics and engineering literature with focus on applications
in the nuclear regulation industry has largely been concerned with different numerical methods
for estimating the value of the eigenvalue  as well as the eigenfunction  and eigenmeasure
(r, )drd. Giving a sensible meaning to (3.10) will play an important part in unraveling the
analysis of stochastic representations of solutions to the NTE as well. Moreover, in additional
forthcoming work [9], we will also see that our asymptotic (3.10), together with the accompanying
stochastic analysis developed here, has influence on a number of completely new Monte Carlo
methods associated with the NTE that, in turn, bears relevance to the applied NTE literature.
The approximation (3.10) can be seen as a functional version of the Perron-Frobenius
Theorem, in particular when noting via (3.9) that we can understand t[g] as a semigroup.
Many attempts have been made to generalise the notion of the Perron-Frobenius decomposition
to semigroups of Markov processes with countable and uncountable state spaces, as well as with
killing and mass creation (see for example [14, 34, 35, 36]), using what has come to be known
as R-theory. The conditions there seem difficult to verify in the current setting.
More recently, [7, 8] have provided an alternative approach to the R-theory presented in
aforementioned works. In the current context, Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.3 of [7] will help
us to achieve the global result, given below. To state it we need to introduce the quantity
(r, )(r, , ) = s(r, )s(r, , 
) + f(r, )f(r, , 
) r  D, ,   V, (3.11)
where  is taken to be a probability density. As such it necessarily follows that
(r, ) = s(r, ) + f(r, )
f(r, , 
)d. (3.12)
Theorem 7. Suppose that (H1) holds as well as (H2): infrD,,V (r, )(r, , ) > 0.
Then, for the semigroup (t, t  0) identified by (3.9), there exists a   R, a positive4 right
eigenfunction   L+(DV ) and a left eigenmeasure which is absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue measure on D  V with density   L+(D  V ), both having associated eigenvalue
et, and such that  (resp. ) is uniformly (resp. a.e. uniformly) bounded away from zero on
each compactly embedded subset of D  V . In particular, for all g  L+(D  V ),
, t[g] = et, g (resp. t[] = et) t  0. (3.13)
Moreover, there exists  > 0 such that
gL+(DV ):g1
et1t[g] , g
= O(et) as t +. (3.14)
This result differs significantly from what is already in the literature principally through the
assumptions on the cross-sections, the strict positivity properties and the uniform boundedness
of ,  and uniformity in the mode of convergence. In existing literature (3.14) is usually given
in the Lp setting, where 1 < p <  is strictly enforced due to the nature of the c0-semigroup
perturbation analysis; cf. [12, 37] and the discussion in [10].
The proof of Theorem 7 is a non-trivial application of the recent theory of [7, 8] in that
verifying their assumptions (which essentially leads to the full statement of Theorem 7) is highly
technical, taking account of the dimension of the system and the piecewise linear (and hence
irregular) nature of the neutron paths in the underlying NBP.
Once again the assumptions (H3) and (H4) are unnecessary. As we shall shortly see, the
4To be precise, by a positive eigenfunction, we mean a mapping from DV  (0,). This does not prevent
it being valued zero on D, as D is an open bounded, convex domain.
result relies on the treatment of the sum of the operators
F as a single object, re-written as
a scattering generator with action
f(r, ) =
(f(r, ) f(r, ))(r, )(r, , )d, r  D,   V.
The assumption (H2) is a condition on the intensity of this new generator. In this sense, the
need for fission or for control of the pathwise behaviour of number of offspring (other than
through their mean) is not needed.
3.4 Neutron random walk and many-to-one methodology
There is a second stochastic representation of the unique solution to (3.9) which will form the
basis of our proof of Theorem 7. In order to describe it, we need to introduce the notion of a
neutron random walk (NRW).
A NRW on D is defined by its scatter rates, (r, ), r  D,   V , and scatter probability
densities$(r, , ), r  D, ,   V such that
$(r, , )d = 1 for all r  D,   V . Simply,
when issued from r with a velocity , the NRW will propagate linearly with that velocity until
either it exits the domain D, in which case it is killed, or at the random time Ts a scattering
occurs, where Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
(r + s, )ds}, for t  0. When the scattering event
occurs in position-velocity configuration (r, ), a new velocity  is selected with probability
$(r, , )d. If we denote by (R,) = ((Rt,t), t  0), the position-velocity of the resulting
continuous-time random walk on DV with an additional cemetery state {} for when it leaves
the domain D, then it is easy to show that (R,) is a Markov process. Note, neither R nor 
alone is Markovian. We call the process (R,) an $-NRW. It is worth remarking that when
$ is given as a single rate function, the density $, and hence the rate , is uniquely identified
by normalising of the given product form $ to make it a probability distribution.
To describe the second stochastic representation of (3.9), we define
(r, ) = f(r, )
f(r, , 
)d  1
  sup
rD,V
f(r, ) > , (3.15)
where the lower bound is due to assumption (H1). The following result was established in
Lemma 7.1 of [10].
Lemma 4 (Many-to-one formula, [10]). Under the assumptions of Lemma 3, we have the second
representation
t[g](r, ) = E(r,)
(Rs,s)dsg(Rt,t)1{t<D}
, t  0, r  D,   V, (3.16)
where D = inf{t > 0 : Rt 6 D} and P(r,v) for the law of the -NRW starting from a single
neutron with configuration (r, ).
Noting that  := suprD,V (r, ) <  thanks to (H1), let us introduce P := (P
t , t 
0) for the expectation semigroup of the -neutron random walk with potential , such as
is represented by the semigroup (3.16), but now killed at rate (  ). More precisely, for
g  L+(D  V ),
Pt [g](r, ) = t[g](r, )e
= E(r,)
((Rs,s))dsg(Rt,t)1{t<D}
= E(r,)
g(Rt,t)1{t<k}
(r,)
[g(Rt,t)] , t  0, r  D,   V, (3.17)
where
k = inf{t > 0 :
(  (Rs,s))ds > e}  D, (3.18)
and e is an independent exponentially distributed random variable with mean 1.
We will naturally write P
(r,)
for the (sub)probability measure associated to E
(r,)
, r 
D,   V . The family P := (P
(r,)
, r  D,   V ) now defines a Markov family of probability
measures on the path space of the neutron random walk with cemetery state {}, which is where
the path is sent when hitting the boundary D or the clock associated to the killing rate   
rings. We note for future calculations that we can extend the domain of functions on D  V to
accommodate taking a value on {} by insisting that this value is always 0.
Our strategy for proving Theorem 7 thus boils down to understanding the evolution of
the semigroup of the NRW ((R,),P). In this sense, we see that the essence of Theorem 7
is, roughly speaking, a classical Perron-Frobenius-type problem for the semigroup of a Markov
process; namely ((R,),P).
It is also worthy of note that, given the role the -NRW in the proof of Theorem 7, we
can also interpret the role of the assumptions (H1) and (H2) in terms of this process. The
condition (H1) ensures that scattering cannot occur too fast. We can describe the condition
(H2) by saying that it offers strong irreducibility of the -NRW (where e.g. we could say
that (H2) only offers weak irreducibility).
As alluded to previously, we can also see why the absence of the assumption (H3) is not a
problem. In the event that e.g. ff is identically zero, the original NBP is nothing more than
a ss-NRW, i.e.  = ss and   0. As such the analysis in the proof of Theorem 7, which
fundamentally concerns a NRW with a strictly irreducible state space and killing is still valid.
Similarly, the inclusion of (H4) is not necessary as we only need control over the kernel  for
the purpose of analysing the associated NRW and not the pathwise behaviour of the otherwise
associated NBP.
3.5 The ground state martingale
As an application of the Perron-Frobenius behaviour of the linear semigroups discussed in Theo-
rem 7, we complete the summary of the main results of this paper by discussing how the existence
of the right eigenfunction  plays directly into the existence of a classical (ground state) martin-
gale for the underlying physical process. Analogues of this martingale appear in the setting of
all spatial branching processes and are sometimes referred to as the additive martingale (see for
example the recent monograph [40] which discusses the analogous setting for branching random
walks, or [3] for fragmentation processes).
Under the assumptions of Theorem 7, thanks to the semigroup property of (3.5) and the
invariance of  in Theorem 7, it is now easy to see that
Wt := e
t ,Xt
, 
, t  0, (3.19)
is a unit mean martingale under P where  M(D V ). It is worth noting that this claim is
not so easy to make under analogues of Theorem 7 found in previous literature (cf. [11, 12, 37])
as the setting of the eigenfunction  in an Lp space would make it difficult to make sense of
expectations of the inner product ,Xt without saying more about the mean semigroup of
(Xt, t  0).
As a non-negative martingale, the almost sure limit of (3.19) is assured. Our second main
result tells us precisely when this martingale limit is non-zero. Before stating the theorem, we
require one more assumption on the fission rate and kernel, which is a stricter version of (H3).
(H3): There exists an open ball B, compactly embedded in D, such that
rB,,V
f(r, )f(r, , 
) > 0.
Theorem 8. For the (s, s, f,P)-NBP satisfying (H1), (H2) and (H4), we have the following
cases for the martingale W = (Wt, t  0):
(i) If  > 0 and (H3) holds, then W is L1(P) convergent;
(ii) If  < 0 and (H3) holds, then W = 0 almost surely;
(iii) If  = 0 and (H3) holds, then W = 0 almost surely.
As we can see from the above theorem, the critical case requires slightly more stringent
conditions than the super- or sub-critical cases. However, it we assume the conditions of the
critical case across the board, we get the aesthetically more pleasing corollary below.
Corollary 1. For the (s, s, f,P)-NBP satisfying (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4), the martin-
gale W is L1(P) convergent if and only if  > 0 and otherwise W = 0, almostsurely.
Note that, unlike many spatial branching process (e.g. the classical result of [6]), there is
no xlogx condition thanks to the assumption (H4) and a precise dichotomy on  emerges. The
result mimics a behavioural trait that has been observed for branching diffusions in compact
domains in e.g. [18]. In essence it states that in the competing physical processes of fission,
transport, scattering and absorption, it is the lead eigenvalue which dictates growth or decay of
mass. In this respect we can also mimic other similar results in the spatial branching process
literature (cf. [1, 19, 27]), the proof of which falls out of the proof of Theorem 8.
Corollary 2. For the (s, s, f,P)-NBP satisfying the assumptions (H1), (H2), (H3) and
(H4), when  > 0, the martingale (Wt, t  0) is L2(P) convergent.
It is particularly interesting to note that in the setting of a critical system,  = 0, which
is typically what is envisaged for a nuclear reactor, the above results evidence the hypothesis
that the fission process eventually dies out (similarly to other examples of critical branching
processes). To verify this rigorously, one needs an almost sure growth result for the particle
system which would take the format
et
g,Xt
, 
= g, W, (3.20)
P-almost surely, for all g  L+(D  V ). This is a much more difficult result than the one
stated in Theorem 8 and is addressed in a second instalment to this paper; see [20]. The reader
should note that (3.20) verifies what has been known in the nuclear industry for a long time.
Namely that critical nuclear reactors will not persist in energy generation, but will eventually
cease working, corresponding to the case that W = 0.
3.6 Neutron random walk and spine decomposition
As with many spatial branching processes, the most efficient way to analyse martingale conver-
gence is through the pathwise behaviour of the particle system (known as a spine decomposition)
when considered under a change of measure induced by the martingale itself. Whilst classical in
the branching process literature, it is unknown in the setting of neutron transport. We will de-
vote the remainder of this section to describing the pathwise spine decomposition of the physical
process, our final main contribution.
We are interested in the change of measure
= Wt, t  0, (3.21)
for the NBP with characteristics s, s, f,P (cf. Remark 6), where  belongs to the space of
finite atomic measuresM(D  V ).
In the next theorem we will formalise an understanding of this change of measure in terms
of anotherM(D  V )-valued stochastic process
X := (X
t , t  0) with probabilities P
 := (P ,  M(D  V )), (3.22)
which we will now describe through an algorithmic construction.
1. From the initial configuration  M(D  V ) with an arbitrary enumeration of particles,
the i-th neutron is selected and marked spine with empirical probability
(ri, i)
, 
2. The neutrons j 6= i in the initial configuration that are not marked spine, each issue
independent copies of (X,P(rj ,j)) respectively.
3. For the marked neutron, issue a NRW characterised by the rate function
s(r, )
(r, )
(r, )
s(r, , 
), r  D, ,   V.
4. The marked neutron undergoes fission at the accelerated rate (r, )1(
F + fI)(r, ),
when in physical configuration (r, )  DV , at which point, it scatters a random number
of particles according to the random measure on V given by (Z,P
(r,)
) where
(r,)
dP(r,)
,Z
E(r,)[,Z]
. (3.23)
5. When fission of the marked neutron occurs in physical configuration (r, )  D  V , set
(r,i), where, in the previous step, Z =
i ,
and repeat step 1.
The processXt describes the physical configuration (position and velocity) of all the parti-
cles in the system at time t, for t  0 (i.e. ignoring the marked genealogy). We will also be inter-
ested in the configuration of the single genealogical line of descent which has been marked spine.
This process, referred to simply as the spine, will be denoted by (R,) := ((Rt ,
t ), t  0).
Together, the processes (X, (R,)) make a Markov pair, whose probabilities we will denote
by (P
,(r,)
,  M(D  V ), (r, )  V D). Note in particular that
P =
(ri, i)
, 
,(ri,i)
when  =
i=1 (ri,i).
Theorem 9. Under assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H4), the process (X, P) is Markovian and
equal in law to (X,P), where P = (P ,  M(D  V )).
It is also worth understanding the dynamics of the spine (R,). For convenience, let us
denote the family of probabilities of the latter by P = (P
(r,)
, (r, )  D V ), in other words,
the marginals of (P
,(r,)
,  M(D  V ), (r, )  V D).
Next we define the probabilities P := (P
(r,)
, (r, )  D  V ) to describe the law of an
-NRW, where
(r, )(r, , ) =
(r, )
(r, )
s(r, )s(r, , 
) + f(r, )f(r, , 
, (3.24)
for r  D, ,   V We are now ready to identify the spine.
Lemma 5. Under assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H4), the process ((R,), P) is a NRW
equal in law to ((R,),P) and, moreover,
(r,)
dP(r,)

= et+
(Rs,s)ds(Rt,t)
(r, )
1(t<D), t  0, r  D,   V, (3.25)
from which we deduce that ((R,),P) is conservative with a stationary distribution (r, )drd
on DV . (Recall that (R,) under P is the -NRW that appears in the many-to-one Lemma
Now that we have stated all of our main results, it is worth noting that, in places, the
analysis echoes very similar issues that have very recently appeared in the analysis of growth-
fragmentation equations, see e.g. [5] and [4], and for good reason. Growth-fragmentation equa-
tions, although dealing with a particle system in which particles mass is positive-valued and
for which there is no consideration of classical velocity, the dynamics of fragmentation shares
the phenomenon of non-local branching. This explains the appearance of integral operators.
Moreover, a combination of Lvy-type and piecewise linear movement of particles in the growth-
fragmentation setting also mirrors the phenomenon of advection and scattering in the NTE and
the associated operators.
In the rest of the paper we prove Theorem 7, Theorem 9, Lemma 5, Theorem 8 and
Corollary 2 in that order.
3.7 Proof of Theorem 7
Our approach to proving Theorem 7 will be to extract the existence of the eigentriple ,  and 
for the expectation semigroup (t, t  0) from the existence of a similar triple of the semigroup
(Pt , t  0) defined in (3.17). Indeed, from (3.17), it is clear that when the latter exists, the
eigenfunctions of the former are the same and the eigenvalues differ only by the constant .
Throughout this section, we assume the assumptions of Theorem 7 are in force.
As alluded to earlier, what lies at the core of our proof is the general result of Theorem
2.1 and Proposition 2.3 of [7] and Theorem 2.1 and the discussion around (1.5) of [8], which,
combined in the current context, reads as follows.
Theorem 10. Suppose that there exists a probability measure  on D  V such that
(A1) there exist t0, c1 > 0 such that for each (r, )  D  V ,
P(r,)((Rt0 ,t0)   |t0 < k)  c1();
(A2) there exists a constant c2 > 0 such that for each (r, )  D  V and for every t  0,
P(t < k)  c2P(r,)(t < k),
where k was defined in (3.18). Then, there exists c < 0 such that, there exists an eigenmeasure
 on D  V and a positive right eigenfunction  of P with eigenvalue ect, such that  is a
probability measure and   L+(D  V ), i.e. for all g  L(D  V )
[Pt [g]] = e
ct[g] and Pt [] = e
ct t  0. (3.26)
Moreover, there exist C,  > 0 such that, for g  L+(DV ) and t sufficiently large (which does
not depend on g), ect1Pt [g] [g]  Cetg. (3.27)
In particular, setting g  1, as t,ect1P(t < k) 1
 Cet. (3.28)
We aim to prove that assumptions (A1) and (A2) are satisfied, so that the conclusions
of the above theorem hold. Then we prove that  is uniformly bounded away from 0 on each
compactly embedded subset of DV and that  admits a positive bounded density with respect
to the Lebesgue measure on DV (see Lemma 9), which concludes the proof of Theorem 7. In
order to do so, we start by introducing two alternative assumptions to (A1) and (A2):
There exists an  > 0 such that
(B1) D := {r  D : infyD |r  y| > vmax} is non-empty and connected.
(B2) there exist 0 < s < t and  > 0 such that, for all r  D\D, there exists Kr  V
measurable such that Vol(Kr)   > 0 and for all   Kr, r+s  D for every s  [s, t]
and r + s / D for all s  [0, s].
It is easy to verify that (B1) and (B2) are implied when we assume that D is a non-
empty convex domain, as we have done in the introduction. They are also satisfied if, for
example, the boundary of D is a smooth, connected, compact manifold and  is sufficiently
small. Geometrically, (B2) means that each of the sets
Lr :=
z  R3 :
z  r
 [s, t],   Kr
, r  D\D (3.29)
is included in D and has Lebesgue measure at least (t2  s2)/2. Roughly speaking, for each
r  D which is within vmax of the boundary D, Lr is the set of points from which one can
issue a neutron with a velocity chosen from   Kr such that (ignoring scattering and fission)
we can ensure that it passes through D\D during the time interval [s, t].
Our proof of Theorem 7 thus consists of proving that assumptions (B1) and (B2) imply
assumptions (A1) and (A2). Our method is motivated by [7, Section 4.2]; however, we note that
our approach accommodates for the more general setting we have here (e.g. V  R3 is bounded
and d = 3) at the cost of greater technicalities.
We begin by considering several technical lemmas. The first is a straightforward conse-
quence of D being a bounded subset of R3.
Lemma 6. Let B(r, ) be the ball in R3 centred at r with radius .
(i) There exists an integer n  1 and r1, . . . , rn  D such that D 
i=1B(ri, vmax/32)
and D B(ri, vmax/32)6=  for each i  {1, . . . , n}.
(ii) For all r, r  D, there exists m  n and i1, . . . , im distinct in {1, . . . , n} such that
r  B(ri1 , vmax/32), r  B(rim , vmax/32) and for all 1  j  m  1, B(rij , vmax/32) 
B(rij+1 , vmax/32) 6= .
Heuristically, the above lemma ensures that there is a universal covering of D by the balls
B(ri, vmax/32), 1  i  n such that between any two points r, r in D, there is a sequence of
overlapping balls B(ri1 , vmax/32),    , B(rim , vmax/32) that one may pass through in order to
get from r to r.
The next lemma provides a minorization of the law of (Rt,t) under P. The result
is similar to [7, Lemma 4.5]; however, we provide a less geometrical proof by considering a
change of variables from Cartesian to polar coordinates. In the statement of the lemma, we use
dist(r, D) for the distance of r from the boundary D.
Define  = infrD,V (r, ) > 0 and  = infrD,,V (r, , ). We will also similarly
write  and  with obvious meanings. We note that due to the assumption (H1) we have  <
and  < and hence, combining this with (H2) it follows that,
rD,V
(r, ) 
rD,,V
(r, )(r, , ) > 0,
and a similar calculation shows that  > 0.
Lemma 7. For all r  D,   V and t > 0 such that vmaxt < dist(r, D), the law of (Rt,t)
under P
(r,)
, defined in (3.17), satisfies
(r,)

where C > 0 is a positive constant.
Proof. Fix r0  D. Let Jk denote the kth jump time of (Rt,t) under P
(r,)
and let 0 be
uniformly distributed on V . Assuming that vmaxt < dist(r0, D), we first give a minorization
of the density of (Rt,t), with initial configuration (r0,0), on the event {J1  t < J2}. Note
that, on this event, we have
Rt = r0 + J10 + (t J1)J1 ,
where J1 is the velocity of the process after the first jump. Then

coordinates, and C1 is an unimportant normalising constant.
For fixed 0, 1, 1 and 1, we first consider the part of (3.32) given by
(s, 0, 0) 7
d0f(r0 + 0,1,1,1(s, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1))(0, 0, 0),
(3.36)
The Jacobian of 0,1,1,1 , as a function of (s, 0, 0), is given by
0 cos 0 sin0  1 cos 1 sin1 s0 sin 0 sin0 s0 cos0 cos 00 sin 0 sin0  1 sin 1 sin1 s0 cos 0 sin0 s0 cos0 sin 0
0 cos0  1 cos1 0 s0 sin0
whose determinant, det(D0,1,1,1(s, 0, 0)) satisfies
(0, 0, 0)
det(D0,1,1,1(s, 0, 0))
4s2v3max
4t2v3max
, s  t.
We thus have the following lower bound for (3.36)
4t2v3max
d0f(r0 + 0,1,1,1(s, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)) (3.37)
 det(D0,1,1,1(s, 0, 0)).
Making another change of variables (s, 0, 0) 7 r  R3 and using the fact that, regardless of
the values of 1, 1 and 1, 0,1,1,1 maps (0, t) (0, ) (0, 2) surjectively onto a set that
contains B(0t), where B(r) is the ball in R3 of radius r centred at the origin, (3.37), and hence
(3.36), is bounded below by
4t23max
B(0t)
f(r, (1, 1, 1))dr. (3.38)
Substituting this equation back into (3.32) and changing (1, 1, 1) back to Cartesian coordi-
nates, we have

where C2 = C1/(4v3max).
Now suppose we fix an initial configuration (r0, 0)  D  V , with tvmax < dist(r0, D).
By considering the event {J2  t < J3} and noting that the scattering kernel is bounded below
by , we may apply the Markov property together with (3.39) to the process at time J1 before
choosing the new velocity. Using the bounds on  and  as before, and recalling that 0 is
uniformly distributed, we have

where we have used the substitution y = r0 + s0 + r to obtain the final line and C3 is another
constant in (0,). Now note that for s  0t/(0 + vmax) we have r0 +B(0t (0 + vmax)s) 
r0 + s0 +B(0(t s)). Combining this with (3.40) and using Fubini, we have

We finally compute the integral with respect to 0  (vmin, vmax). In order to do so, we first note
that since 0 < vmax, the integrand in (3.41) is bounded below by
0t |y  r0|
2vmax
Absorbing 1/2vmax into the constant C3, applying Fubini and computing the 0 integral yields

as required.
We now turn to the proof of (A1) under the assumptions of (B1) and (B2).
Proof of (A1). In this proof, we will follow a similar strategy to the one presented in [7, Section
4.2]. We therefore start by proving (A1) for initial configurations in D  V .
To this end, fix (r, )  D  V . From Lemma 6, there exists an i  {1, . . . , n} such that
r  B(ri, vmax/32) D. Then, for each t  [/2, ), Lemma 7 yields
(r,)

 |z  r|
vmax  vmin

1{zB(r,vmaxt)} dz dw. (3.43)
Now, if j  {1, . . . n} is such that B(ri, vmax/32)  B(rj , vmax/32) 6= , the triangle inequality
implies that D  (B(ri, vmax/32)  B(rj , vmax/32))  B(r, vmax/8)  B(r, vmaxt), with the
latter inclusion following from the fact that t  [/2, ).
Hence, for z  B(ri, vmax/32) B(rj , vmax/32) and t  [/2, ), the density on the right-
hand side of (3.43) is bounded below by a constant C > 0, which is independent of r, , i and
j. Hence,
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)  C1{zD(B(ri,/32)B(rj ,/32))} dz dw, z  D,w  V. (3.44)
Now let t  (n+ 1)/2. By writing t = k/2 + t, for some k  n and t  [/2, ). We will
demonstrate that a repeated application of (3.44) will lead to the inequality
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)  Cck1{zD}dzdw, z  D,w  V, (3.45)
for (r, )  DV , where c > 0 is another unimportant constant which depends only on  and
is defined in the following analysis.
To this end, we start by noting that, since r  D and   V , there exists i0, i1  {1, . . . , n}
such that r  B(ri0 , vmax/32) and B(ri0 , vmax/32)B(ri1 , vmax/32)D 6= . Applying (3.44)
at time t (recall that we have identified t = k/2 + t for some k  n) we obtain,
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)

(Rt+k/2  dz,t+k/2  dw)

We now turn our attention to P
(r,)
(Rk/2  dz,k/2  dw), for (r, )  (B(ri1 , vmax/32) 
D)  V and k  n. Thanks to Lemma 6, for all ik+1  {1, . . . , n}, there exist i2, . . . , ik 
{1, . . . , n} such that B(rij , /32)B(rij+1 , /32) 6=  for every j  {1, . . . , k}. Note, here we see
the importance of choosing k  n, to ensure the validity of the previous statement.
Applying (3.44) and following the same steps that lead to (3.46), we obtain
(r,)
(Rk/2  dz,k/2  dw)
B(ri2 ,/32)D
(r,)
(R(k1)/2  dz,(k1)/2  dw)dr

(r,)
(R/2  dz,/2  dw)dr

where c = CVol(V ) mini=1,...,n Vol(B(ri, vmax/32)  D). Using this inequality to bound the
right-hand side of (3.46) yields
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)
 Cck1
B(rik ,/32)D
(r,)

We now apply (3.44) a final time at time /2 to obtain
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)  Cck1{zB(rik+1 ,/2)D} dz dw. (3.50)
Since this inequality holds for every ik+1  {1, . . . , n}, it also follows that
(r,)
(Rt  dz,t  dw)  Cck sup
ik+1{1,...,n}
1{zB(rik+1 ,/2)D}
dz dw
 Cck 1{zD} dz dw,
where the final line follows from Lemma 6 since k + 1 > n. This is the lower bound claimed
in (3.45).
Finally, noting that for any two events A,B, Pr(A|B) = Pr(A B)/Pr(B)  Pr(A B),
we have that for initial conditions (r, )  D V , any t0  (n+ 1)/2 and  equal to Lebesgue
measure on D  V , there exists a constant c1  (0,) such that
P(r,)((Rt0 ,t0)   |t0 < k)  c1(),
as required by (A1).
We now prove (A1) for initial conditions in (D\D)  V . Once again, we recall that
assumptions (B1) and (B2) are in force.
Choose r  D\D,   V and define the (deterministic) time
D\Dr, := inf{t > 0 : r + t 6 D\D},
which is the time it would take a neutron released at r with velocity  to hit the boundary of
D\D if no scatter or fission took place. Note in particular that 
r, is not a random time
but entirely deterministic. We first consider the case r + D\Dr,   D
(r,)

Combining this with (3.45) and the Markov property, for all t  (n + 1)/2

where k  n is such that t = k/2 + t for some t  [/2, ).
On the other hand, suppose r+ D\Dr,   D. Then, recalling the assumptions (B1) and
(B2) it follows that {J1 < 
r,  (t  s),J1  Kr+J1 , J2 > t}  {Rt  D, t < k}.
Heuristically speaking, this is because if the first jump occurs before time D\Dr,  (ts), then
the process hasnt hit the boundary and there are still (at least) s units of time left until t.
By then choosing the new velocity, J1 , from Kr+J1 , thanks to the assumption (B1) and the
remarks around (3.29), this implies that the process will remain in D\D for s units of time, at
some point in time after which, it will move into D, providing the process doesnt jump again
before entering D. Combining this with the usual bounds on , and recalling from (B2) that
Vol(Kr) >  > 0 for all r  D\D and   V , we have
P(r,)(Rt  D, t < k)  P

Now, since we are considering the case r + D\Dr,   D and t + t

with the bound on the right-hand side above being itself bounded below by a constant that
does not depend on (r, ). Substituting this back into (3.54), this proves (A1) with  taken as
Lebesgue measure on DV as before, t0 can be sufficiently taken as (n+1)/2+diam(D)/vmin
and we may start with any initial configurations in D\D  V .
In order to prove (A2) we require the following lemma, the proof of which will be given
after that of (A2).
Lemma 8. For all r  D and   V , recalling that Jk denotes the kth jump time of the process
(R,), we have
(r,)
(J7 < k, RJ7  dz)  C1{zD} dz, (3.56)
for some constant C > 0, and
P(J1 < k, RJ1  dz)  c1{zD} dz, (3.57)
for another constant c > 0, where , from the proof of (A1), is Lebesgue measure on D  V .
Proof of (A2). Again, we follow the proof given by the authors in [7]. Let t  7diam(D)/vmin
and note that on the event {k > t}, we have J7  7diam(D)/vmin almost surely. This inequality
along with the strong Markov property imply that,
P(r,)(t < k)  E
(r,)
1{J7<t}P(RJ7 ,J7 )
(t s < k)s=J7
(r,)
P(RJ7 ,J7 )
7diam(D)
. (3.58)
Since  is uniformly bounded above, conditional on {J7 < , RJ7  dz}, the density of J7
is bounded above by  multiplied by Lebesgue measure on V . Combining this with (3.56)
and (3.58), we obtain
P(r,)(t < k)  C
P(z,w)
7diam(D)
dw dz, (3.59)
for some C   (0,) Similarly, for t  diam(D)/vmin, equation (3.57), the fact that the inclusion
{t < k}  {J1  diam(D)/vmin}, the strong Markov property and the fact that  is uniformly
bounded below entail that,
P(t < k) = E
1{J1k}P(RJ1 ,J1 )
(t s < k)s=J1
 E
1{J1k}P(RJ1 ,J1 )
(t < k)
P(z,w)(t < k) dw dz,
for some c  (0,), where  is Lebesgue measure on DV . Putting (3.58) and (3.59) together,
for all t  8diam(D)/vmin, we have
P(r,)(t < k) 
7diam(D)
. (3.60)
Now, recalling t0 and  from the proof of (A1), it follows from (A1) that
P((Rt0 ,t0)  )  c1P(t0 < k)(). (3.61)
The event {t < k} occurs if the particle has either been killed on the boundary of D or if it
has been absorbed by fissile material, which occurs at rate   . Since t0 and  are fixed, and
     + 1 <  by assumption, P(t0 < k)  K for some constant K > 0. Thus, keeping
t  8diam(D)/vmin, using (3.61)
7diam(D)
+ t0 < k
1{t0<k}P
(Rt0 ,t0 )
7diam(D)
 c1P
7diam(D)
, (3.62)
where c1 = Kc1.
Now define N = d7diam(D)/(vmint0)e. Then, for any t > 0, t 7diam(D)/vmin +Nt0  t
so that, trivially,
P(t < k)  P
7diam(D)
+Nt0 < k
. (3.63)
Applying (3.62) N times implies that
P(t < k)  cN1 P
4diam(D)
. (3.64)
Combining this with (3.60) completes the proof of (A2).
Proof of Lemma 8. Let us first prove (3.56). Again, following the proof given in [7], we couple
the neutron transport random walk in D with one on the whole of R3. Denote by (Rt, t) the
neutron random walk in D = R3, coupled with (R,) such that Rt = Rt and t = t for all
t < k and (R0,0) = (R0, 0) = (r, ), for r  D,   V . Denote by J1 < J2 < . . . the jump
times of t. Then for each k  1 such that Jk < k, we have Jk = Jk. Due to the inequality
(r,)
[f(RJ7); J7 < k]  E(r,)[f(RJ7)], r  D,   V, (3.65)
we will consider the distribution of R
for i  2. We first look at the case when i = 2. For
(r, )  D  V and non-negative, bounded, measurable functions f ,
E(r,)[f(RJ2)] = E(r,)[f(r + J1 + J1(J2  J1)]
 2
(j1+j2)f(r + j1 + 1j2) (3.66)
For j1 fixed, we consider the integrals over 1 and j2 in (3.66). Making the change of variables
1 7 (, , ), we have
j2f(r + j1 + 1j2)
j2f
r + j1 + (j2, , )
2 sin, (3.67)
where  was defined in (3.34). Now making the substitution u = j2 in (3.67),
j2f(r + j1 + 1j2)
 vmax
dueu/f
r + j1 + (u, , )
 sin
dueu/vmaxf
r + j1 + (u, , )
sin, (3.68)
where C = vmax(vmax  vmin). Making a final change of variables (u, , ) 7 x  R3, we have
j2f(r + j1 + 1j2)  C
dx f(r + j1 + x)
e|x|/vmax
. (3.69)
Substituting this back into (3.66) yields
E(r,)[f(RJ2)]  K
dxf(r + j1 + x)
e|x|/vmax
, (3.70)
where K = C. Iterating this process over the next five jumps of the process gives
E(r,)[f(RJ7)]  K
dx1  
dx6f(r + j1 + x1 +   + x6)g(x1) . . . g(x6)
(3.71)
where g(x) = e|x|/vmax/|x|2, x  R3. Now, g  Lp(R3) for each p < 3/2 so that, in particular,
g  L6/5(R3). Hence, repeatedly applying Youngs convolution inequality implies that the six-
fold convolution 6g  L(R3). (The reader will note that this is the fundamental reason we
have focused our calculations around the 7th jump time J7, rather than it being an arbitrary
choice.) Making the substitution x = x1 +   + x6,
(r,)
[f(R
)] K6 6 g
dx1  
dx6f(r + j1 + x). (3.72)
Finally, setting z = r + j1 + x yields
(r,)
[f(RJ7); J7 < k]  E(r,)[f(RJ7)]  C
f(z)dz, (3.73)
where C  = K6g      g, which completes the proof of (3.56).
We now prove (3.57). For r, r  R3, let [r, r] denote the line segment between r and
r. For all f  B(R3), recalling the definition of  from the proof of (A1) and using the usual
bounds on ,
E [f(RJ1); J1 < k] 
Vol(D)
Vol(V )
ds1{[r,r+s]D} e
sf(r + s), (3.74)
where Vol(D) =
dr and Vol(V ) =
d. Following a similar method to those employed
in the proof of Lemma 7 and (3.56) and changing first to polar coordinates via  7 (, , ),
followed by the substitution u = s, and finally changing back to Cartesian coordinates via
(u, , ) 7 x, the right-hand side of (3.74) is bounded below by
dx1{[r,r+x]D}
es/vmin
f(r + x), (3.75)
where C > 0 is a constant. Making a final substitution of x = z  r, yields
E [f(RJ1); J1 < k]  C
dz1[r,z]D
e|zr|/vmin
|z  r|2
v2mine
diam(D)/2min
(diam(D))2
dz1{[r,z]D}f(z). (3.76)
For all z  D\D, (B1) and the discussion thereafter now imply that
1{[r,z]D}dr  Vol(Lz) 
(t2  s
), (3.77)
where s and t are defined in (B2), and Lz is defined in (3.29). On the other hand, for all
z  D, 
1{[r,z]D}dr  Vol(D B(r, )). (3.78)
Since the map z 7 Vol(D  B(z, )) is continuous and positive on the compact set D, the
latter equation is uniformly bounded below by a strictly positive constant. It then follows that
for every z  D, the integral
dr1{[r,z]D} is bounded below by a positive constant. Using
this to bound the right-hand side of (3.76) yields the result.
We thus have proved that the conclusions of Theorem 10 are valid under our assumptions.
In order to conclude that Theorem 7 holds true, it remains to prove that  is uniformly bounded
away from 0 on each compactly embedded subset ofDV and the existence of a positive bounded
density for the left eigenmeasure .
Lemma 9. The right eigenfunction  is uniformly bounded away from 0 on each compactly
embedded subset of D  V and the probability measure  admits a positive density with respect
to the Lebesgue measure on D V , which corresponds to the quantity  and which is uniformly
bounded from above and a.e. uniformly bounded from below on each compactly embedded subset
of D  V .
Proof. For all  > 0, we deduce from the eigenfunction property of  (cf. Theorem 10) and
from (3.45) that there exist a time t > 0 and a constant C > 0 such that
(r, ) = ectPt [](r, )  e
tC
(z, w)dzdw > 0,
for all (r, )  D  V . It follows that  is uniformly bounded away from 0 on each compactly
embedded domain of D  V .
Using the same notations as in the proof of Lemma 8, we consider the neutron transport
random walk (Rt, t) in D = R3, coupled with (R,) such that Rt = Rt and t = t for
all t < k. We also denote by J1 < J2 < . . . the jump times of (t)t0. Let T  0 be a
random time independent of (R, ) with uniform law on [T , T ], where T < T are fixed and
T  7diam(D)/vmin. We first prove that the law of (RT , T ) after the 7th jump admits a
uniformly bounded density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We conclude by using the
coupling with (R,) and the quasi-stationary property of  in (3.26).
For all k  7 and for any positive, bounded and measurable function f vanishing outside
of D  V , we have
E[f(RT , T )1{JkT<Jk+1}
| R0, 0, T ]
= E[f(R0 + J10 +   + Jkk1 + (T  J1      Jk)k, k)1{JkT<Jk+1} | R0, 0, T ]

| R0, 0]

d1   
 ts1sk1
 f(R0 + 0s1 +   + k1sk + k(t s1      sk), k).
Using the change of variable (u1, . . . , uk, uk+1) = (s1, . . . , sk, t s1      sk) yields

| R0, 0]
kk
[0,T ]k+1
du10u1++uk+1T
 f(R0 + 0u1 +   + k1uk + kuk+1, k).
The same approach as in Lemma 8 shows that there exists a constant C > 0 (which does not
depend on R0 nor on 0) such that, for all measurable function g : R3  [0,+),
[0,T ]7
d g(R0 + 0u1 +   + 6u7)  C
dxg(x).
Hence,

where we used the change of variable y = x+ 7 u8 +   + kuk+1 and the fact that f vanishes
outside DV . Summing over k  7, we deduce that there exists a constant C  > 0 (which only
depends on C, ,  and T ) such that
E[f(RT , T )1{J7T} | R0, 0]  C
d f(y, ).
Similarly as in the proof of (A2), we chose T  7diam(D)/vmin, so that, on the event
{k > T}, we have J7  7diam(D)/vmin  T almost surely. Hence, we obtain that, for any
(r0, 0)  D  V ,
(r0,0)
[f(RT ,T );T < k] = E
(r0,0)
[f(RT ,T );T < k, J7  T ]
 E(r0,0)[f(RT , T ); J7  T ]

Integrating with respect to  and using the quasi-stationary property (3.26) and Fubinis The-
orem (recall that T and the process (R,) are independent), we obtain
T  T
dt ect[f ] =
T  T
dtE[f(Rt,t); t < k]
= E[f(RT ,T );T < k]
 C 
d f(y, ). (3.79)
Since f was chosen arbitrarily, this proves that  admits a uniformly bounded density (from
above) with respect to the Lebesgue measure on D  V .
Finally, using the quasi-stationarity of  (3.26) and integrating inequality (3.44) with
respect to  implies that (here the time t and the constants k,C, c depend on  as in inequality
(3.45)), for all bounded measurable functions f on D  E,
f(x)(dx) = E[f(Rt,t); t < k]
 (D  V )Cck
f(z, w) dz dw.
This implies that  is a.e. lower bounded by ect(DV )Cck onDV . Since this inequality
can be proved for any  > 0 small enough, one deduces that, on any subset D  V with  > 0
and hence on any compactly embedded subset of DV ,  is a.e. uniformly bounded away from
zero.
3.8 Proof of Theorem 9
There are three main steps to the proof. The first is to characterise the law of transitions of the
Markov process (X,P), defined in the change of measure (3.21); note that the latter ensures
the Markov property is preserved. The second step is to show that they agree with those of
(X, P). The third step is to show that (X, P) is Markovian. Together these three imply
the statement of the theorem.
Step 1. Next we look at the multiplicative semigroup which characterises uniquely the
transitions of (X,P) (cf. [23, 24, 25])
t [g](r, ) := E(r,)

(3.80)
for t  0 and g  L+(D  V ) which is uniformly bounded by unity. Note, we keep to the
convention that an empty product is understood as 1, however we also define the empty inner
product as zero (corresponding to all functions scoring zero when particles arrive at the cemetery
state {}). As such, if we are to extend the domain of test functions in the product to include
the cemetery state {}, we need to insist on the default value g({}) = 1; see [23, 24, 25].
We start in the usual way by splitting the expectation in the second equality of (3.80)
according to whether a scattering or fission event occurs. (The reader may wish to recall the
role of the quantities s, f,  = s + f, s and f in (3.1)). We get

g(r + (t  D
(r,)
), ) to account for the fact that g({}) = 1. Before developing the right-hand
side above any further, we need to make two additional observations and to introduce some more
notation.
The first observation is that, since W is a martingale, by sampling at the time of the first
scattering event, fission event or when it leaves the domain D, whichever happens first, thanks to
Doobs Optional Sampling Theorem, its mean must remain equal to 1 and we get the functional
equation

(3.82)
for r  D,   V . Now appealing to Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4 in [16], to treat the last two terms
of (3.82) as potentials, with a little bit of algebra we can otherwise write the above as
(r, ) = (r + t, ) exp
F  I)(r + s, )
(r + s, )
for t < Dr,, where I is the identity operator, which is to say, for t < 
(r + t, )

= exp

(r + s, )
. (3.83)
Our second observation pertains to the manipulation of the expectation on the right-hand side
of (3.81). Define for g  L+(D  V ), (r, )  D  V and t  0,
ut[g](r, ) := E(r,)

We will also make use of the notation
Gf[f ](r, ) = f(r, )E(r,)
g(r, j) g(r, )
, (3.88)
for r  D,   V and g  L+(D  V ), which is uniformly bounded by unity. Recall that the
empty product in the definition (3.84) is defined as unity.
In a similar manner to (3.81) we can break the expectation over the event of scattering or
fission in (3.84), which defines of ut[g], to see that the operator Gf appears in the decomposition
ut[g](r, ) = Ut[g] +
Suts[g] +Gf[uts[g]]ds, t  0, (3.89)
for g  L+(DV ), which is uniformly bounded by unity. Here, we have adjusted the definition
of the semigroup U to
Ut[g](r, ) = g(r + (t  Dr,), ), t  0, r  D,   V. (3.90)
Now returning to (3.81) with the above observations and definitions in hand, whilst again ap-
pealing to Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4 in [16], we have

for g  L+(D  V ), where {(Rit,it) : i = 1,    , Nt} are the physical configurations of the
particles alive in the system at time t  0 in X.
By conditioning ut on the first time a scattering of fission event occurs, it is a straight-
forward exercise to show that it also solves (3.92). For the sake of brevity, we leave this as an
exercise to the reader as the arguments are similar to those mentioned previously. In order to
show that (3.92) has a unique solution, we consider vt [g] := u
t [g] and v
t [g] := u
t [g]. Since
t and u
t both satisfy (3.91), applying [16, Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4] along with (3.83), it is
straightforward to show that vt and v
t both satisfy
vt[g](r, ) = g(r + (t  D(r,)), )(r + t, )e

Due to the assumptions (H1) and (H4), an application of Grnwalls inequality implies unique-
ness of (3.94), which in turn implies uniqueness of (3.92). We leave this as an exercise to the
reader as it is a relatively standard computation and very similar to the calculations given in
[10].
Step 3. We start by noting that the joint process (X, (R,)) is, by construction,
Markovian under P, we thus need to show that the marginalisation of the coupled system
to just X retains the Markov property. We do this by showing that for f  L+(D  V ),
 M(D  V ) and (r, )  D  V ,
E [f(R
t )|X
t ] =
f,Xt 
,Xt 
, t  0. (3.95)
This says that knowingXt only allows one to construct the law of (R
t ) through an empirical
distribution using . Hence, for g  L+(DV ) which is bounded by unity and  M(DV ),

We are thus left with proving (3.95) to complete this step. To do so we note that it suffices
to show that for f, g  L+(D  V ) bounded by unity,  M(D  V ) and (r, )  D  V ,
log g,Xt

(3.97)
To this end, we note that splitting the expectation on the right-hand of (3.97) side at either a
scattering or fission event results in a calculation that is almost identical to the one above that
concludes with (3.92). More precisely, the expectation on the right-hand side solves (3.92) albeit
the role of Ut[g] is replaced by Ut[fg]. Similarly splitting the expectation on the left-hand side of
(3.97) also results in a solution to (3.92) (with the aforementioned adjustment). The uniqueness
of (3.92), with U replaced by U, follows from the same arguments and hence the equality in (3.97)
now follows, as required. 
3.9 Proof of Lemma 5
The fact that the spine is Markovian is immediate from its definition of (R,). Indeed, once
given its initial configuration, it evolves as the NRW associated to the rate 1(r, )s(r, )(r, )s(r, , ).
Moreover, when in configuration (r, )  DV , at rate (r, )1(
F +fI)(r, ), it experiences
an additionally scattering with new velocity , with distribution

for   V , where we have used (3.87). The total scatter rate is thus

For the second statement, write
t [g](r, ) := E(r,)
et+
(Rs,s)ds(Rt,t)
(r, )
g(Rt,t)1(t<D)
. (3.99)
By conditioning the expectation on the right-hand side on the first scattering event we
have, for t  0, r  D and   V ,
t [g](r, ) = e
t+
(r+`,)(r+`,)d`(r + t, )

(r, )
ts[g](r + s, 
(r + s, )
(r + s, )
(r + s, , )dds (3.100)
Now appealing to (3.83), then using the standard trick of replacing the role of an additive
potential by the role of a multiplicative potential in such semigroup evolutions, see e.g. Lemma
1.2, Chapter 4 in [16], and noting (3.99) we get
t [g](r, ) = Ut[g](r, ) +
L + 
I)ts[g] (
F)+ (  )I)ts[g]](r, )ds
(3.101)
where
Lf(r, ) = 
(r, )
[f(r, ) f(r, )](r, , )d, (3.102)
for f  L+(D  V ). Referring to (3.7), (3.8) and (3.15), we note that
(r, )

 f(r, )
f(r, , 
)d  1
+ s(r, ) + f(r, )
f(r, ,

Hence (3.101) reduces to the somewhat simpler recurrence equation
t [g](r, ) = Ut[g](r, ) +
ts[g]](r, )ds, t  0,
where we recall that
L was defined in (3.102). This is nothing more than the mild equation
for the semigroup evolution E
(r,)
[g(Rt,t)], t  0, which has a unique bounded solution from
the usual Grnwall arguments. Note that when g = 1, we see the solution is 1. This, together
with the Markov property implies that the right-hand side of (3.25) is a martingale. Moreover,
it follows that the martingale change of measure in (3.25) describes law of the -NRW.
The fact that t [1](r, ) = 1 for all r  D,   V , implies that ((R,),P
) is conservative.
Moreover,
(r,)
[g(Rt,t)] = 
t [g](r, ) = e
tt[g](r, )
(r, )
, r  D,   V.
where g  L+(D  V ); cf. (3.99). Hence limt P
(r,)
[g(Rt,t)] = g,  for all g  L+(D 
V ). In other words,  is the density of the stationary distribution of (R,) under P. 
3.10 Proof of Theorem 8
The proof we offer here is a variant of a standard one, which has been used to analyse the
convergence of many analogous martingales in the setting of different spatial branching processes.
We mention [32], [40], [3] and [17] to name but a few of the contexts with similar results.
In the case that  < 0 and  > 0, we need (H3) to ensure that the NBP can undergo
fission. In the setting  = 0 we need the stricter condition (H3) for technical reasons in the
proof to ensure a minimal rate of reproduction.
A standard measure theoretic result (cf. p. 242 of [15]) tells us that the martingale change
of measure in (3.21) is uniformly integrable if and only if
P(r,)
lim sup
Wt <
In the case that lim suptWt =, P almost surely, we have P(r,)(W = 0) = 1.
(i) Let us first deal with the case that  > 0. To this end, let us define the sigma algebra
S = (Ti,Zi : i  0), where Ti, i  1, are the times at which the spine undergoes fission and Zi,
i  1, are point processes on V that describe the velocities of fission offspring (i.e. whose law
is given by the family (3.3) under the change of measure (3.23)). For convenience we will write
T0 = 0.
Appealing to the pathwise spine decomposition in Theorem 9, letting Tj denote the birth
times along the spine and Nj the number of offspring (excluding the spine itself), we can write
E(r,) [Wt] = E
(r,)
et
(Rt,t)

 (3.103)
where, for a given (r, )  D  V , the process W js (r, ) is an independent copy of (Ws, s  0),
under P(r,) (and consequently has unit mean, which is also used above). Our objective is to
prove that the right-hand side of (3.103) is finite. In that case, it will follow with the help of
Fatous Lemma that
 > lim sup
E(r,) [Wt]  E
(r,)
lim inf
. (3.104)
Recalling that W is a non-negative P-martingale, it holds that 1/W is a non-negative P-
supermartingale and thus its limit exists [21]. The conditional expectation in (3.104) ensures
that lim inftWt (and hence from the immediately preceding remarks lim suptWt) is P
(r,)
almost surely finite.
To this end, we again recall the description of the pathwise spine decomposition in Theorem
9 and note that fission along the spine occurs at the accelerated rate 1(
F + fI). Hence
(recalling the generic point process Z defined in (3.3))
E(r,)

where we have used (H4) in the first inequality, features of the spine decomposition for the first
equality, (3.87) and (H1) in the second inequality, the change of measure (3.25) in the third
inequality and the semigroup (3.16) for the final line. Finally, note that since  is uniformly
bounded above, the contribution from the spine term in (3.103) is zero in the limit t. Now
using Theorem 7, it follows that
lim sup
E(r,) [Wt] <
as required.
(ii) Next, for the case  < 0, it is easy to see that, on the event {Tj  t < Tj+1},
Wt  et(Rt,Tj1)
which ensures that P(r,)(lim suptWt =) = 1 for all (r, )  DV and hence P(r,)(W =
0) = 1.
(iii) Finally, for the case  = 0, our aim is to show that, for each r  D,   V ,
P(r,)(lim supt
Wt =) = 1.
We do this by constructing a random sequence of times (sn : n  0) such that lim supnWsn =
almost surely with respect to P.
Lemma 5 tells us that  is the density of the stationary distribution of (R,) under P.
Moreover, thanks to Theorem 7, the density  is a.e. uniformly bounded away from 0 on each
  D  V . It follows that 1,  > 0 for all   D  V and that the spine R visits 
infinitely often under P.
Fix k  N. We want to show that there is an   D  V such that
(r,)
P(r,)(X(D  V )  k) > 0, (3.106)
where  = 2diam(D)/vmin (note that  is twice the time it would take a neutron to cross the
equivalent of the diameter of D, when moving at minimal speed). To this end, fix r  D,   V
and choose  > 0 sufficiently small such that both r  D := {r  D : infyD |r  y| > vmax}
and B (introduced in the assumption (H3)) is in D. Then, define
 = {(r, )  D  V : {r + s : s  0} B 6= } .
Write m for the smallest natural number such that m(nmax  1) + 1  k. Recalling
from Theorem 7 that infrD,,V (r, )(r, , ) > 0, and taking account of the positivity
properties of , we can lower bound the probability that, from any (r, )  , the spine can
enter B. Moreover, on this event, due to (H3), we can also lower bound the probability that
the spine immigrates nmax  1 particles on m (evenly spaced in time) separate occasions, all of
which are still inside of B by time . The strategy for doing so is to head into B from the given
point of issue in  by travelling in a straight line within a small cone of possible velocities (which
would be guaranteed to happen within /2 units of time), and then for neutrons to cycle around
the perimeter of B in an annulus by scattering within a narrow cone of velocities each time; see
Fig 3-2. As such we can provide the lower bound desired in (3.106). The technical details are
tedious and left to the reader.
(r, )  
Figure 3-2: There is a uniform lower bound on the probability that the spine issued from
(r, )   heads directly into the annulus contained in B and subsequently immigrates nmax  1
neutrons on each of m separate occasions, which then cycle around the annulus, and all this is
completed over the time horizon  = 2diam(D)/vmin elapses.
With (3.106) in hand, we can construct the sequence (tn : n  0) by defining t0 = 0 and
subsequently, for n  1,
tn = inf{s > tn1 + (10m ) : (Rs,s)  }.
Note that since (R,) visits  infinitely often under P we have that tn <, P-almost surely
for n  0, and tn  , P-almost surely. By applying the strong Markov property at the
sequence of times (tn, n  0), it now follows from (3.106) that, in the spirit of a sequence of
independent Bernoulli trials, lim supnXsn(D)  k almost surely with respect to P, where
sn = tn + (m  ). Since the integer k can be chosen arbitrarily large, we also have that
lim supnXsn(D) = almost surely with respect to P.
As  is uniformly bounded below away form 0 on DV (see Theorem 7), it follows that
Wt  cXt(D  V ), t  0,
for some constant c > 0. The analysis above, thus shows that P(r,)(lim suptWt =) = 1,
as required, for each r  D,   V .
3.11 Proof of Corollary 2
Doobs martingale inequality ensures that, for  M(D  V )
E[(sup
2]  lim inf
4E[(Ws)2].
Showing that the right-hand side above is finite is sufficient to obtain L2(P) convergence. Note,
however, that E[(Ws)2] = E
 [Wt], t  0, and hence, from (3.104), the desired upper bound is
proved.

Concluding remarks
In this chapter we considered the so-called neutron branching process and its linear semigroup, in
order to analyse the neutron transport equation from a stochastic point of view. We also obtained
a second stochastic representation, called the neutron random walk, via a many-to-one formula.
Using theory from quasi-stationary distributions, we were able to analyse this latter process in
order to obtain existence of the leading eigenvalue and associated left and right eigenfunctions.
We then obtained a Perron-Frbenius decomposition, which explicitly characterises the leading
order behaviour of the branching system in terms of these leading eigenelements.
In the second half of this chapter, we looked at the different regimes of the branching
process in accordance with the sign of the leading eigenvalue. We also obtained a spine de-
composition, which we will exploit in the next chapter to obtain a strong law of large numbers
result.

Transport Equation II: Almost sure growth
Abstract
The neutron transport equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons across a planar cross-
section in an inhomogeneous fissile medium when the process of nuclear fission is active. Clas-
sical work on the NTE emerges from the applied mathematics literature in the 1950s through
the work of R. Dautray and collaborators, [7, 8, 24]. The NTE also has a probabilistic represen-
tation through the semigroup of the underlying physical process when envisaged as a stochastic
process; cf. [7, 22, 23, 25]. More recently, [6] and [17] have continued the probabilistic analysis
of the NTE, introducing more recent ideas from the theory of spatial branching processes and
quasi-stationary distributions. In this paper, we continue in the same vein and look at a fun-
damental description of stochastic growth in the supercritical regime. Our main result provides
a significant improvement on the last known contribution to growth properties of the physical
process in [25], bringing neutron transport theory in line with modern branching process theory
such as [14, 12]. An important aspect of the proofs focuses on the use of a skeletal path decom-
position, which we derive for general branching particle systems in the new context of non-local
branching mechanisms.

4.1 Introduction
In this article we continue our previous work in [17] and look in more detail at the stochastic
analysis of the Markov process that lies behind the Neutron Transport Equation (NTE). We
recall that the latter describes the flux, t, at time t  0, of neutrons across a planar cross-
section in an inhomogeneous fissile medium (measured in number of neutrons per cm2 per
second). Neutron flux is described in terms of the configuration variables (r, v)  D V , where
D  R3 is (in general) a non-empty, smooth, open, bounded and convex domain such that D
has zero Lebesgue measure, and V is the velocity space, which is given by V = {  R3 : min 
||  max}, where 0 < min < max <.
In its backwards form, the NTE is introduced as an integro-differential equation of the
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, )
+ s(r, )
t(r, 
)s(r, , 
)d + f(r, )
t(r, 
)f(r, , 
)d, (4.1)
where the five fundamental quantities s, s, f, f and  (known as cross-sections in the
physics literature) are all uniformly bounded and measurable with the following interpretation:
s(r, ) : the rate at which scattering occurs from incoming velocity  at position r,
f(r, ) : the rate at which fission occurs from incoming velocity  at position r,
(r, ) : the sum of the rates f + s and is known as the total cross section,
s(r, , 
) : probability density that an incoming velocity  at position r scatters to an
outgoing velocity, with probability  satisfying
s(r, , 
)d = 1, and
f(r, , 
) : density of expected neutron yield at velocity  from fission with
incoming velocity  satisfying
f(r, , 
)d <.
It is also usual to assume the additional boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D, if   nr > 0,
(4.2)
where nr is the outward facing normal of D at r  D and g : D  V  [0,) is a bounded,
measurable function which we will later assume has some additional properties. Roughly speak-
ing, this means that neutrons at the boundary which are travelling in the direction of the exterior
of the domain are lost to the system.
We will also work with some of (but not necessarily all of) the following assumptions in
our results:
(H1) Cross-sections s, f, s and f are uniformly bounded away from infinity.
(H2) We have ss + ff > 0 on D  V  V .
(H3) There is an open ball B compactly embedded in D such that ff > 0 on
B  V  V .
(H4) Fission offspring are bounded in number by the constant nmax > 1.
We note that these assumptions are sufficient but not necessary, and refer the reader to
Remark 2.1 in [17] for a discussion of their implications.
4.1.1 Rigorous interpretation of the NTE
As explained in the companion paper [17], the NTE (4.1) is not a meaningful equation in the
pointwise sense. Whereas previously (4.1) has been interpreted as an abstract Cauchy process
on the L2(D  V ) space, for probabilistic purposes, the NTE can be better understood in its
mild form; see the review discussion in [6]. In particular, the NTE is henceforth understood as
the unique bounded solution on bounded intervals of time which satisfy (4.2) and the so-called
mild equation
t[g](r, ) = Ut[g](r, ) +
F)ts[g]](r, )ds, t  0, r  D,   V. (4.3)
for g  L+(D  V ), the space of non-negative functions in L(D  V ). In (4.3), the advection
semigroup is given by
Ut[g](r, ) = g(r + t, )1(t<Dr,), t  0. (4.4)
where Dr, := inf{t > 0 : r + t 6 D}, the scattering operator is given by
Sg(r, ) = s(r, )
g(r, )s(r, , 
)d  s(r, )g(r, ), (4.5)
and the fission operator is given by
Fg(r, ) = f(r, )
g(r, )f(r, , 
)d  f(r, )g(r, ), (4.6)
for r  D,   V and g  L+(D  V ).
The papers [17] and [6] discuss in further detail how the mild representation relates to
the other classical representation of the NTE via an abstract Cauchy problem which has been
treated in e.g. [7, 8, 24]. To understand better why the mild equation (4.3) is indeed a suitable
representation fo the NTE, we need to understand the probabilistic model of the physical process
of nuclear fission.

4.1.2 Neutron Branching Process
Let us recall from [17], the neutron branching process (NBP), whose expectation semigroup
provides the solution to (4.3). It is modelled as a branching process, which at time t  0 is
represented by a configuration of particles which are specified via their physical location and
velocity in D  V , say {(ri(t), i(t)) : i = 1, . . . , Nt}, where Nt is the number of particles alive
at time t  0. In order to describe the process, we will represent it as a process in the space of
finite atomic measures
Xt(A) =
(ri(t),i(t))(A), A  B(D  V ), t  0, (4.7)
where  is the Dirac measure, defined on B(DV ), the Borel subsets of DV . The evolution of
(Xt, t  0) is a stochastic process valued in the space of measuresM(D  V ) := {
i=1(ri,i) :
n  N, (ri, i)  D  V, i = 1,    , n} which evolves randomly as follows.
A particle positioned at r with velocity  will continue to move along the trajectory r+t,
until one of the following things happen.
(i) The particle leaves the physical domain D, in which case it is instantaneously killed.
(ii) Independently of all other neutrons, a scattering event occurs when a neutron comes in
close proximity to an atomic nucleus and, accordingly, makes an instantaneous change of
velocity. For a neutron in the system with position and velocity (r, ), if we write Ts for
the random time that scattering may occur, then providing r + t  D, independently of
the action of fission, Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
s(r + s, )ds}, for t  0.
When scattering occurs at space-velocity (r, ), the new velocity is selected in V indepen-
dently with probability s(r, , )d.
(iii) Independently of all other neutrons, a fission event occurs when a neutron smashes into
an atomic nucleus. For a neutron in the system with initial position and velocity (r, ),
if we write Tf for the random time that fission may occur, then, providing r + t  D,
independently scattering, Pr(Tf > t) = exp{
f(r + s, )ds}, for t  0.
When fission occurs, the smashing of the atomic nucleus produces lower mass isotopes
and releases a random number of neutrons, say N  0, which are ejected from the point
of impact with randomly distributed, and possibly correlated, velocities, say {i : i =
1,    , N}. The outgoing velocities are described by the atomic random measure
Z(A) :=
i(A), A  B(V ). (4.8)
When fission occurs at location r  Rd from a particle with incoming velocity   V ,
we denote by P(r,) the law of Z. The probabilities P(r,) are such that, for   V , for
bounded and measurable g : V  [0,),
g()f(r, v, 
)d = E(r,)
g()Z(d)
=: E(r,)[g,Z], (4.9)
where E(r,) denotes expectation with respect to P(r,). Note, the possibility that Pr(N =
0) > 0, which will be tantamount to neutron capture (that is, where a neutron slams into
a nucleus but no fission results and the neutron is absorbed into the nucleus).
Write P for the the law of X when issued from an initial configuration   M(D  V ).
Coming back to how the physical process relates to the NTE, it was show in [6, 17, 7, 8]
that, under the assumptions (H1) and (H2), the unique solution, which is bounded on bounded
intervals of time, to (4.3) is given by
t[g](r, ) := E(r,) [g,Xt], t  0, r  D,   V, (4.10)
for g  L+(D V ). The NBP is thus parameterised by the quantities s, s, f and the family
of measures P = (P(r,), r  D,   V ) and accordingly we refer to it as a (s, s, f,P)-NBP. It
is associated to the NTE via the relation (4.10), but this association does not uniquely identify
the NBP. Nonetheless for a given quadruple (s, s, f, f), it was shown in [17] that under the
assumptions (H1) and (H3), at least one NBP always exists that can be associated to it via
(4.10).
There is, however, a second equation similar to (4.3), which describes the non-linear semi-
group of the neutron branching process and which does uniquely identify the (s, s, f,P)-NBP.
Write the branching generator associated with the physical process by4
G[g](r, ) = f(r, )E(r,)
g(r, j) g(r, )
(4.11)
for r  D,   V and g  L+(D  V ) and define
ut[g](r, ) := E(r,)
g(ri(t), i(t))
, t  0. (4.12)
Formally speaking, by extending the domain in which particles live to include a cemetery state
, corresponding to neutron capture or neutrons going to the boundary D, we will always work
with the convention (cf. [19, 20, 21]) that functions appearing in additive functionals are valued
as zero on {}, whereas in multiplicative functionals, they are valued as one on {}. One may
think of this as requiring that empty sums are valued as zero where as empty products are valued
as one.
As shown in Section 8 of [17], we can break the expectation over the event of scattering
or fission in (4.12) and, appealing to standard manipulations (cf. [6, 17]) we see that, for
g  L+(D  V ), which is uniformly bounded by unity,
ut[g] = Ut[g] +
Suts[g] +G[uts[g]]ds, t  0, (4.13)
where
Ut[g](r, ) = g(r + (t  Dr,), ). (4.14)
Under the assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H4), it was also shown in [17] that (4.13) has a unique
solution in the space of non-negative functions, which are bounded over bounded intervals of
time.
Before moving on to the asymptotics of (t, t  0), let us make an important note regarding
alternative representations of equations (4.3) and (4.13) for later use. In order to do so, let us
momentarily introduce what we mean by a neutron random walk (NRW); cf. [17]. A NRW
on D, is defined by its scatter rates, (r, ), r  D,   V , and scatter probability densities
(r, , ), r  D, ,   V where
(r, , )d = 1 for all r  D,   V . When issued
from r  D with a velocity , the NRW will propagate linearly with that velocity until either
it exits the domain D, in which case it is killed, or at the random time Ts a scattering occurs,
where Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
(r + s, )ds}, for t  0. When the scattering event occurs in
4Here and elsewhere, an empty product is always understood to be unity.
position-velocity configuration (r, ), a new velocity  is selected with probability (r, , )d.
We refer more specifically to the latter as an -NRW.
The linear mild equation (4.3) and its accompanying non-linear mild form (4.13), although
consistent with existing literature (cf. [6, 17, 18, 5]) can be equally identified as the unique (in
the same sense as mentioned in the previous paragraph) solution to the equations
t[g](r, ) = Qt[g](r, ) +
Fts[g]](r, )ds, t  0, r  D,   V. (4.15)
ut[g] = Qt[g](r, ) +
Qs[G[uts[g]](r, )ds, t  0, r  D,   V, (4.16)
respectively, where for g  L+(D  V ),
Qt[g](r, ) = E(r,)[f(Rt,t)1(t<D)],
Qt[g](r, ) = E(r,)[f(RtD ,tD)],
are the expectation semigroups associated with the ss-NRW and D = inf{t > 0 : Rt 6 D}.
4.1.3 Lead order asymptotics of the expectation semigroup
In the accompanying predecessor to this article, [17], a Perron-Frobenius type asymptotic was
developed for (t, t  0). In order to state it we need to introduce another assumption, which
is slightly stronger than (H2). To this end, define
(r, )(r, , ) = s(r, )s(r, , 
) + f(r, )f(r, , 
) r  D, ,   V. (4.17)
Our new condition is:
(H2): We have infrD,,V (r, )(r, , ) > 0.
Theorem 11. Suppose that (H1) and (H2) hold. Then, for semigroup (t, t  0) identified
by (4.3), there exists a   R, a positive5 right eigenfunction   L+(D  V ) and a left
eigenmeasure which is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on D  V with
density   L+(D  V ), both having associated eigenvalue et, and such that  (resp. ) is
uniformly (resp. a.e. uniformly) bounded away from zero on each compactly embedded subset of
D  V . In particular for all g  L+(D  V )
, t[g] = et, g (resp. t[] = et) t  0. (4.18)
5To be precise, by a positive eigenfunction, we mean a mapping from DV  (0,). This does not prevent
it being valued zero on D, as D is an open bounded, convex domain.
Moreover, there exists  > 0 such that, for all g  L+(D  V ),et1t[g] , g
= O(et) as t +. (4.19)
In light of Theorem 11, we can categorise the physical process according to the value of
. In particular, when  > 0 we say the process is supercritical, when  = 0, the process is
critical and when  < 0, the process is subcritical.
4.1.4 Strong law of large numbers at supercriticality
The main aim of this article as a continuation of [17] is to understand the almost sure behaviour
of the (s, s, f,P)-NBP in relation to what is, in effect, a statement of mean growth in Theorem
11, in the setting that  > 0. In the aforesaid article, it was noted that
Wt := e
t ,Xt
, 
, t  0, (4.20)
is a unit mean martingale under P,   M(D  V ) and, moreover its convergence was stud-
ied. In particular, since the martingale is non-negative, we automatically know that it must
converge to a limiting random variable, that is, Wt W, P-almost surely, where we can take
W := lim inft0Wt for definiteness. Before stating the result regarding the latter, we require
one more assumption on the NBP:
(H3): There exists a ball B compactly embedded in D such that
rB,,V
f(r, )f(r, , 
) > 0.
Theorem 12 ([17]). For the (s, s, f,P)-NBP satisfying the assumptions (H1), (H2), (H3)
and (H4), the martingale (Wt, t  0) converges to W P-almost surely and in L2(P) if and only
if  > 0, otherwise W = 0 P-almost surely.
Note that when   0, since limt0Wt = 0 almost surely, it follows that, for each 
compactly embedded in D V , limtXt() = 0. It therefore remains to describe the growth
of Xt(), t  0, for  > 0. This is the main result of this paper, given below. In order to
state it, we must introduce the notion of a directionally continuous function on D  V . Such
functions are defined as having the property that, for all r  D,   V ,
g(r + t, ) = g(r, ).
Theorem 13. Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 12 hold. For all measurable and directionally
continuous non-negative g on D  V such that, up to a multiplicative constant, g  , then for
any initial configuration  M(D  V ),
et
g,Xt
, 
 g, W
P-almost surely and in L2(P), as t.
To the best of our knowledge no such results can be found in the existing neutron transport
literature. The closest known results are found in the final section of [25] and are significantly
weaker than Theorem 13.
We can think of Theorem 13 as stating a stochastic analogue of (4.19), noting, for example,
that the former implies
et
E(r,) [g,Xt]
(r, v)
= g,  (4.21)
for all r  D,   V , which is a version of the latter (albeit without the speed of convergence).
The proof of Theorem 13 relies on a fundamental path decomposition, often referred to
in the theory of spatial and non-spatial branching processes as a skeletal decomposition, see e.g.
[12, 14, 2, 9, 26]. The skeletal decomposition is essential in that it identifies an embedded NBP
within the original one for which there is no neutron-absorption (neither at D nor into nuclei
at collision). This thinned down tree is significantly easier to analyse for technical reasons, but
nonetheless provides all the mass in the limit (4.21).
4.2 Skeletal decomposition
Inspired by [14], we dedicate this section to the proof of a so-called skeletal decomposition,
which necessarily requires us to have  > 0. In very rough terms, for the NBP, we can speak
of genealogical lines of descent, meaning neutrons that came from a fission event of a neutron
that came from a fission event of a neutron ... and so on, back to one of the initial neutrons a
time t = 0. If we focus on an individual genealogical line of descent embedded in the NBP, it
has a space-velocity trajectory which takes the form of a NRW whose spatial component may or
may not hit the boundary of D. Indeed, when the NBP survives for all time (requiring  > 0),
there must necessarily be some genealogical lines of descent whose spatial trajectories remain in
D forever.
The basic idea of the skeletal decomposition is to consider the collection of all surviving ge-
nealogical lines of descent and understand their space-velocity dynamics collectively as a process
(the skeleton). It turns out that the skeleton forms another NBP but with different scatter and
fission statistics from the underlying NBP, due to the fact that we are considering genealogical
lines of descent which are biased, since they remain in D for all time. For the remaining neutron
trajectories that go to the boundary of D or end in neutron capture, the skeletal decomposition
identifies them as immigrants that are thrown off the path of the skeleton.
Below, we develop the statement of the skeletal decomposition. It was brought to our
attention by a referee that the proof is robust enough to work in the relatively general setting
of a Markov branching process (MBP) with non-local branching and hence we first set up the
notation of a general branching process. It is worthy of note that the motivation for this
switch to a general setting is that, for branching particle systems, nothing is known of skeletal
decompositions for non-local branching generators; although some results have been identified in
the more continuous setting of superprocesses, cf [26], they do not apply to particle systems. Our
proof is inspired by the martingale arguments found in [14] which gives a skeletal decomposition
for branching Brownian motion in a strip with local branching.
4.2.1 The general branching Markov setup
Until the end of this section (Section 4.2), unless otherwise mentioned, we will work in the setting
of a general MBP, which we will shortly define in more detail. The reader will note that we
necessarily choose to overlap our notation for this general setting with that of the NBP. As such,
the reader is encouraged to keep in mind the application to the NBP at all times. Additionally,
we provide some remarks at the end of this section to illustrate how the general case takes a
specific form in the case of the NBP.
Henceforth, X = (Xt, t  0) will be a (P, G)-Markov branching process on a non-empty,
open Euclidian domain6 E  Rd, where P = (Pt, t  0) is a Markov semigroup on E and G is
the associated branching generator. More precisely, X is an atomic measure-valued stochastic
process (in a similar sense to (4.7)) in which particles move independently according to a copy
of the Markov process associated to P such that, when a particle is positioned at x  E, at
the instantaneous spatial rate (x), the process will branch and a random number of offspring,
say N , are thrown out in positions, say x1,    , xN in E, according to some law Px. (Note, we
always consider of (x1, . . . , xN ) as an ordered set of points.)
We do not need P to have the Feller property, and we assume nothing of the boundary
conditions on E, in particular, P need not be conservative. That said, it will prove to be more
convenient to introduce a (possible) cemetery state  appended to E, which is to be treated as
an absorbing state, and regard P as conservative. As such,
Pt[f ](x) = Ex[f(t)] = Ex[f(t)1(t<k)], x  E, f  L
(E), (4.22)
where the process , with probabilities (Px, x  E), is the Markov process on E  {} with
lifetime k = inf{t > 0 : t  {}}, L+(E) is the space of bounded, measurable functions on E
and, in this context, we always take f() := 0.
As such, in a similar spirit to (4.11), we can think of the branching generator, G, as having
definition
G[f ](x) = (x)Ex
f(xj) f(x)
, x  E, (4.23)
6The arguments presented here are robust enough to work with more abstract domains; see for example the
set up in [1].
for f  L+,1 (E), the space of non-negative measurable functions on E bounded by unity. As
previously, we always define the empty product as equal to unity.
We use Px for the law of X issued from a single particle positioned at x  E. In a similar
spirit to (4.12), we can introduce the non-linear semigroup of the branching process,
ut[g](x) := Ex
g(xi(t))
, t  0, x  E, g  L+,1 (E), (4.24)
where Xt =
i=1 xi(t), t  0. As before, we define the empty product to be unity, and for
consistency, functions, g, appearing in such functionals can be valued on E  {} and forced to
take the value g() = 1.
Similarly to the derivation of (4.13) and (4.16), it is straightforward to show that, for such
functions, ut[g] solves the non-linear mild equation
ut[g] = Pt[g](x) +
Ps[G[uts[g]](x)ds, t  0, x  E, (4.25)
where we need to adjust P to P to accommodate for the fact that empty products are valued as
one, as follows
Pt[g](x) = Ex[g(tk)], x  E. (4.26)
Now, define
 := inf{t  0 : 1, Xt = 0}, (4.27)
the time of extinction, and let
w(x) := Px( <). (4.28)
We will also frequently use with
p(x) := 1 w(x), x  E.
Recalling that we need to take as a definition w() = 1, by conditioning on Ft = (Xs, s  t),
for t  0,
w(x) = Ex
w(xi(t))
. (4.29)
Taking (4.29), (4.25) and (4.26) into account, it is easy to deduce that w also solves
w(x) = Pt[w](x) +
Ps [G[w]] (x)ds, t  0, x  E. (4.30)
We will assume:
(M1): infxE w(x) > 0 and w(x) < 1 for x  E.
Beyond this, we assume relatively little about P and G other than:
(M2): The branching rate  is uniformly bounded from above.
Re-writing (4.30) in the form
w(x) = Ex[w(tk)] + Ex
[ tk
w(s)
G[w](s)
w(s)
, t  0,
and noting that supxE G[w](x)/w(x) <, we can appeal to the method of exchanging ex-
ponential potential for additive potential7 in e.g. [10, Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4, Part 1], which
yields
w(x) = Ex
w(tk) exp
( tk
G[w](s)
w(s)
, x  E, t  0. (4.31)
This identity will turn out to be extremely useful in our analysis, in particular, the equality
(4.31) together with the Markov property of  implies that the object in the expectation on the
right-hand side of (4.31) is a martingale.
In Theorem 14 below we give the skeletal decomposition in the form of a theorem. In
order to state this result, we first need to develop two notions of conditioning. As there is rather
a lot of notation, we include a table in the Appendix which the reader may refer to as needed.
The basic pretext of the skeletal decomposition is that we want to split genealogical lines
of descent into those that survive forever and those that reach a dead end. To this end, let ci(t)
denote the label of a particle i  {1, . . . , Nt}. We label a particle prolific, denoted ci(t) = ,
if it has an infinite genealogical line of descent, and ci(t) = , if its line of descent dies out (i.e.
non-prolific). Ultimately, we want to describe how the spatial genealogical tree of the MBP can
be split into into a spatial genealogical sub-tree, consisting of -labelled particles (the skeleton),
which is dressed with trees of -labelled particles.
Let Pl = (Plx , x  E) denote the probabilities of the two-labelled process described above.
Then for t  0 and x  E we have the following relationship between Pl and P:
dPlx
1(ci(t)= ) + 1(ci(t)= )
= 1, (4.32)
where F =  (t0Ft). Projecting onto Ft, for t  0, we have
dPlx
= Ex
1(ci(t)= ) + 1(ci(t)= )
) Ft
I{1,...Nt}
Px(ci(t) =  |Ft)
i{1,...,Nt}\I
Px(ci(t) =  |Ft)
I{1,...Nt}
p(xi(t))
i{1,...,Nt}\It
w(xi(t)), (4.33)
7We will use this trick throughout this paper and consistently refer to it as the transfer of the exponential
potential to the additive potential and vice versa in the other direction.
where we understand the sum to be taken over all subsets of {1,    , Nt}, each of which is
denoted by I.
The decomposition in (4.33) indicates the beginning point of how we break up the law
of the (P, G)-MBP according to subtrees that are categorised as  (with probability w) and
subtrees that are categorised as  with  dressing (with probability p), the so-called skeletal
decomposition.
In the next two sections we will examine the notion of our MBP conditioned to die out
and conditioned to survive, respectively. Thereafter we will use the characterisation of these
conditioned trees to formalise our skeletal decomposition.
4.2.2 -trees
Following [14], let us start by characterising the law of genealogical trees populated by the marks
. Thanks to the branching property, it suffices to consider trees which are issued with a single
particle with mark . By definition of the mark c(0) = , where  is the initial ancestral particle,
this is the same as understanding the law of (X,P) conditioned to become extinct. Indeed, for
A  Ft,
Px(A) := P
(A|c(0) = )
Plx(A; ci = , for each i = 1, . . . , Nt)
Plx(c(0) = )
i=1w(xi(t))
. (4.34)
We are now in a position to characterise the MBP trees which are conditioned to become extinct
(equivalently, with genealogical lines of descent which are marked entirely with ). Heuristically
speaking, the next proposition shows that the conditioning creates a branching particle process
in which particles are prone to die out (whether that be due to being killed at the boundary
under P, or suppressing offspring). Our proof is partly inspired by Proposition 11 of [14].
Proposition 3 ( Trees). For initial configurations of the form  =
i=1 xi , for n  N and
x1,    , xn  E, define the measure P
 via (4.34),
P = 
i.e. starting independent processes at positions xi each under Pxi , for i = 1,    , n. Then under
P , X is a (P, G)-MBP with motions semigroup P and branching generator G defined as
follows. The motion semigroup P is that of the Markov process  with probabilities (Px, x  E),
where

For x  E and f  L+,1 (E), the branching generator is given by
G[f ] = (x)Ex
f(xj) f(x)
[G[fw] fG[w]] , (4.36)
where,
(x) = (x) +
G[w](x)
w(xj)

(N,x1,...,xN )
i=1w(xi)
j=1w(xj)
] = (x)
(x)w(x)
w(xi) (4.38)
Proof of Proposition 3. First let us show that the change of measure results in a particle process
that respects the Markov branching property. In a more general sense, for  as in the statement
of this proposition, (4.34) takes the form

i=1w(xi(t))n
i=1w(xi)
It is clear from the conditioning that every particle in the resulting process under the new
measure P must carry the mark , i.e. be non-prolific, by construction.
Let us define, for g  L+,1 (E),
t [g](x) = E
g(xi(t))
 c(0) = 
ut[wg](x), (4.39)
which describes the evolution of the the process X under P. In particular, for g  L+,1 (E),
x  E and s, t  0, note that
Nt+s
g(xi(t+ s))
Ft
 = 1
w(xi(t))Ex
N isj=1w(xij(s))g(xij(s))
w(xi(t))
Ft
w(xi(t))u
s[g](xi(t)), (4.40)
where, given Ft, ((xij(t)), j = 1,    , N
s) are the physical configurations of particles at time t+s
that are descendent from particle i  Nt. This ensures the Markov branching property holds.
It thus suffices for the remainder of the proof to show, in the spirit of (4.13), that, for
g  L+,1 (E),
t [g](x) = P
t [g](x) +
Ps[G
ts[g]](x)ds, t  0, x  E. (4.41)
holds, where P
is defined in a similar spirit to (4.26), which is the semigroup evolution equation
for a (P, G)-MBP, and to identify the internal structure of G.
From (4.25) and (4.39) it follows that, for g  L+,1 (E),
t [g] =
Pt[wg] +
Ps[G[wu
ts[g]]ds, t  0, (4.42)
In the spirit of the derivation of (4.31), we can apply [11, Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4, Part 1]
and use (4.35) and (4.42) to get, for x  E,
t [g](x) =
Pt[wg](x) +
ts[g]]

where we have used the definition (4.36).
It remains to identify the internal structure of G. Recalling that  =  + w1G[w], we
have, for f  L+,1 (E),
G[f ](x) =
[G[fw] fG[w]] (x)
(x)Ex
f(xi)w(xi)

f(xi)w(xi)

(x)w(x)
w(xi)f(xi)
 f(x)
Moreover, recalling the change of measure (4.38), note that, for x  E, Px is a probability
measure on account of the fact that, when we set f  1, recalling again that  =  + w1G[w]
as well as the definition of G given in (4.23),
(x)w(x)
w(xi)
G[w](x) + (x)w(x)
(x) + w1(x)G[w](x)
as required.
4.2.3 l-trees
In a similar spirit to the previous section we can look at the law of our MBP, when issued from
a single ancestor, conditioned to have a subtree of prolific individuals. As such, for A  Ft, we
define
Plx(A|c(0) = ) =
Plx(A; ci = , for at least one i = 1, . . . , Nt)
Plx(c(0) = )
i=1w(xi(t))
. (4.43)
In the next proposition, we want to describe our MBP under Plx(|c(0) = ). In order to do so,
we first need to introduce a type--type- MBP.
Our type--type- MBP process, say Xl = (Xlt , t  0), has an ancestor which is of type-
. We will implicitly assume (and suppress from the notation Xl) that Xl0 = x, for x  E.
Particles in Xl of type- move as a P-Markov process. When a branching event occurs for a
type- particle, both type- and type- particles may be produced, but always at least one type-
is produced. Type- particles may be thought of as offspring and any additional type- particles
may be thought of as immigrants. Type- particles that are created can only subsequently
produce type- particles in such a way that they give rise to a (P, G)-MBP.
The joint branching/immigration rate of type- and type- particles in Xl at x  E is
given by
l(x) =
1 N
w(xj)
 . (4.44)
We can think of the branching rate in (4.44) as the original rate (x) multiplied by the probability
(under Px) that at least one of the offspring are of type-, given the branching particle is of
type-
At a branching/immigration event of a type- particle, we will write N and (xi , i =
1,    , N) for the number and positions of type- offspring and N and (xj , j = 1,    , N
) for
the number and positions of type- immigrants. We will write (Plx, x  E) for the joint law of
the the random variables in the previous sentence. Formally speaking, the branching generator,
Gl, of offspring/immigrants for a type- particle positioned at x  E is written
Gl[f, g](x) = l(x)
 f(x)
 (4.45)
for f, g  L+,1 (E).
For our process Xl, for each x  E, we will define the laws Plx in terms of an additional
random selection from (xi, i = 1,    , N) under Px. WriteN  for the set of indices in {1,    , N},
which, together, identify the type- particles, i.e. (xi, i  N ) = (x
j , j = 1,    , N
). The
remaining indices {1,    , N} \ N  will identify the type- immigrants from (xi, i = 1,    , N).
Thus, to describe Plx, for any x  E, it suffices to give the law of (N ;x1, . . . , xN ;N ). To this
end, for F  (N ;x1, . . . , xN ) and I  N, we will set
Plx(F  {N
 = I}) := 1{|I|1}
l(x)p(x)
1F{I{1,...,N}}
p(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)
(4.46)
Equivalently, we could define Plx(F ) := Px(F ) for all F  (N ;x1, . . . , xN ), and, for all
I  N,
Plx(N
 = I|(N ;x1, . . . , xN )) := 1{|I|1}{I{1,...,N}}
iI p(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I w(xi)
1 Ex
j=1w(xj)
] . (4.47)
The pairs (xi , i = 1,    , N
) and (xj , j = 1,    , N
) under (Plx, x  E) in (4.45) can thus
be seen as equal in law to selecting the type of each particle following an independent sample
of the non-local branching configuration (x1, . . . , xN ) under Px, where each xk is independently
assigned either as type- with probability p(xk) or as type- with probability w(xk) = 1p(xk),
but then conditional on there being at least one type-.
As such with the definitions above, it is now a straightforward exercise to identify the
branching generator in (4.45) in terms of (xi, i = 1,    , N) under (Px, x  E) via the following
identity, for x  E,
Gl[f, g](x) =
I{1,...,N}
|I|1
p(xi)f(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)g(xi)
 l(x)f(x) (4.48)
Proposition 4 (Dressed -trees). For x  E, the process Xl is equal in law to X under
Plx(|c(0) = ). Moreover, both are equal in law to to a dressed (P
, G)-MBP, say X, where
the motion semigroup P corresponds to the Markov process  on E  {} with probabilities
x, x  E) given by (recalling that p is valued 0 on )

(s,st)
p(t)
G[w](s)
p(s)
, t  0, (4.49)
and the branching generator is given by
G[f ] =
(G[pf + w] (1 f)G[w]) , f  L+,1 (E). (4.50)
The dressing consists of additional particles, which are immigrated non-locally in space at the
branch points of X, with each immigrated particle continuing to evolve as an independent
copy of (X,P) from their respective space-point of immigration, such that the joint branch-
ing/immigration generator of type- offspring and type- immigrants is given by (4.48).
Proof of Proposition 4. We may think of ((xi(t), ci(t)), i  Nt), t  0, under Pl as a two-type
branching process. To this end, let us write Nt =
i=1 1(ci(t)= ) and N
 = Nt N
t , for t  0.
Define, for f, g  L+,1 (E),
t [f, g](x) = E
[t[f, g]| c(0) = ] , t  0. (4.51)
where, for t  0,
t[f, g] =
i (t))f(x
i (t))
j (t))g(x
j (t)),
where
i (t), i = 1,    , N
t ) = (xi(t) such that ci(t) =, i  Nt)
and (xi (t), i = 1,    , N
) is similarly defined.
We can break the expectation in the definition of ult [f, g] over the first branching event,
noting that until that moment, the initial ancestor is necessarily prolific. We have (again re-
membering p() = 0)
t [f, g](x)
t[f, g]1(c(0)= )
Px(c(0) = )
p(t)f(t)e
(u)du
p(s)
(s)
p(s)
(u)du
I{1,...,N}
|I|1
p(xi)u
ts[f, g](xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)u
ts[g](xi)
. (4.52)
To help the reader interpret (4.52) better, we note that the first term on the right-hand side
comes from the event that no branching occurs up to time t, in which case the initial ancestor
is positioned at t. Moreover, we have used the fact that Px(c(0) = |Ft) = p(t). The second
term is the consequence of a branching event occurring at time s  [0, t], at which point in
time, the initial ancestor is positioned at s and thus has offspring scattered at (xi, i = 1    , N)
according to Ps . The contribution thereof from time s to t, can be either captured by u
ts[f, g],
with probability p, if a given offspring is of type- (thereby growing a tree of particles marked
both  and ), or captured by uts[g], with probability w, if a given offspring is of type-
(thereby growing a tree of particles marked only with ). Hence projecting the expectation of
t[f, g]1(c=) onto the given configuration (xi, i = 1    , N) at time s, we get the sum inside
the expectation with respect to Ps , which caters for all the possible markings of the offspring of
the initial ancestor, ensuring that at least one of them is  (which guarantees c(0) =). In both
expectations, the event of killing is accommodated for the fact that p() = f() = () = 0.
We may now substitute and (4.48) into (4.52) to get
t [f, g](x)
p(t)f(t)e
(u)du
p(s)
(s)
p(s)
(u)du
ts[f, g], u
ts[g]](s) + 
l(s)u
ts[f, g](s)
(4.53)
Next, recalling the first equality in (4.44) that (x) = l(x) +G[w](x)/p(x), in each of the
terms on the right-hand side of (4.53), we can exchange the exponential potential exp(
(u)du)
for the exponential potential exp(
G[w](u)/p(u)du) by transferring the the difference in
the exponent to an additive potential (cf. Lemma 1.2, Chapter 4 in [10]). In this exchange,
the term l()u
ts[f, g]() is cancelled out on the right-hand side of (4.53). Then recalling the
change of measure (4.49) that defines the semigroup P, we get, on E,
t [f, g] = P
t [f ] +
ts[f, g], u
ts[g]]
ds, t  0. (4.54)
(Note, there is no need to define the object P
in the sprit of (4.26) as the semigroup P is that
of a conservative process on E.) This is the semigroup of a two-type MBP in which -marked
particles immigrate off an -marked MBP. We have yet to verify however that the -marked
MBP is in fact the previously described (P, G)-MBP. In order to do this, we need to show that
G[f ] = Gl[f, 1], for all f  L+,1 (E), where G was given in (4.50).
To this end, let us note two computational facts. First, for any x  E,
1 = Ex
(p(xi) + w(xi))
I{1,...,N}
p(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)
 , (4.55)
so that
l(x) =
 
I{1,...,N}
|I|1
p(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)
 . (4.56)
Second, recalling (4.23), note
G[f ](x)G[g](x) = (x)
f(xj)
 Ex
g(xj)
and G[1](x)  0. We thus have that, for x  E,
G[f ] = Gl[f, 1](x)
I{1,...,N}
|I|1
p(xi)f(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)
 f(x)
 
I{1,...,N}
|I|1
p(xi)
i{1,...,N}\I
w(xi)
(p(xi)f(xi) + w(xk))
w(xk)
 f(x)
(p(xi) + w(xk))
w(xk)
{G[pf + w](x)G[w](x)}  f(x)
{G[1](x)G[w](x)}
{G[pf + w](x) (1 f)G[w](x)} ,
since p(x) + w(x) = 1, and this is just as required.
Theorem 14 (Skeletal decomposition). We assume throughout that (M1) and (M2) are in force.
Suppose that  =
i=1 xi , for n  N and x1,    , xn  E. Then (X,P) is equal in law to
t + (1 Bi)X
, t  0, (4.57)
where, for each i = 1, . . . , n, Bi is an independent Bernoulli random variable with probability of
success given by
p(xi) := 1 w(xi) (4.58)
and the processes Xi, and Xi,l are independent copies of (X,Pxi ) and (X,P
(|c(0) = )),
respectively.
As alluded to previously, Theorem 14 pertains to a classical decomposition of branching
trees in which the process (4.57) describes how the MBP divides into the genealogical lines of
descent which are prolific (surviving with probability p), in the sense that they create eternal
subtrees which never leave the domain, and those which are unsuccessful (dying with probability
w), in the sense that they generate subtrees in which all genealogies die out.
Remark 8. It is an easy consequence of Theorem 14 that, for t  0, the law of Xt conditional
on Ft = (Xs, s  t), is equal to that of a Binomial point process with intensity p()Xt(). The
latter, written BinPP(pXt), is an atomic random measure given by
BinPP(pXt) =
Bixi(t),
where (we recall) that Xt =
i=1 xi(t), and Bi is a Bernoulli random variable with probability
p(xi(t)), i = 1,    , Nt.
Remark 9. It is also worth noting that the skeleton process X, given above, necessarily
has at least one type- offspring at each branch point, and indeed might have exactly one
type- offspring (although possibly with other simultaneous type- immigrants). As such, an
alternative way of looking at the type- process would be to think of the skeleton of prolific
individuals as a (P, G)-MBP with at least two type- offspring at each branch point, with a
modified motion P in place of P which integrates the event of a single type- as an additional
discontinuity in the movement. However, note these additional jumps are special in the sense
as they are also potential points of simultaneous immigration of type- particles, unlike other
jumps corresponding to P where there is no type- immigration.
4.2.4 Combining l-trees and -trees into the skeletal decomposition
Finally we are now ready to give the skeletal decomposition of (X,P).
Proof of Theorem 14. As previously, we may think of ((xi(t), ci(t)), i  Nt), t  0, as a two-type
branching process under Pl. A similar calculation to (4.33) gives us that, for  =
i=1 xi with
n  1 and xi  E, i = 1, . . . , n,
El [t[f, g]] =
I{1,...,n}
p(xi)u
t [f, g](xi)
i{1,...,n}\I
w(xi)u
t [wg](xi).
What this shows, together with the conditional version (4.33), is that the change of measure
(4.33) (which is of course unity) is equivalent to a Doob h-transform on a two-type branching
particle system (i.e. types {, }) where we consider the system after disregarding the marks.
The effect of this Doob h-transform on type- particles is that they generate (P, G)-MBPs,
where as type- particles generate a dressed (P, G)-MBP as described in Proposition 4.
4.2.5 Remarks on the skeletal decomposition for the NBP
The case of the skeletal decomposition for the NBP adds an additional layer of intricacy to
the general picture given above. In this case, we have E = D  V with cemetery state  that
is entered when there is neutron capture (a neutron disappears in D  V without undergoing
fission) or neutrons go to the physical boundary points {(r, ) : r  D and  nr > 0}. It turns
out that for the NBP, it is more convenient to view Theorem 14 in the spirit of Remark 9, i.e.
we view the process X as a branching process that has at least two offspring at every branching
event and whose movement corresponds to advection plus an extra discontinuity, which accounts
for a branching event with one offspring.
To make this statement more precise, we first enforce the conditions of Theorem 12 in order
to ensure (M1) and (M2) are satsfied. Indeed, on account of the inclusion { <}  {W = 0},
we see that w(x)  Px(W = 0), r  D,   V . Recalling thatW converges both almost surely
as well as in L1(P) to its limit, we have that Px(W = 0) < 1 for r  D,   V . This, combined
with the fact that every particle may leave the bounded domain D directly without scattering
or undergoing fission with positive probability, gives us that
 Dr,
0 (r+s,)ds < w(r, ) < 1 for all r  D,   V. (4.59)
Note that the lower bound is uniformly bounded away from 0 thanks to the maximal diameter
of D, the minimal velocity min (which, together uniformly upper bound Dr,) and the uniformly
upper bounded rates of fission and scattering. The upper inequality becomes an equality for
r  D and   nr > 0.
Now, viewing the NBP X as a process with movement Q and branching generator G,
heuristically speaking, we can understand a little better the the motions of X and X through
the action of their generators. By considering only the leading order terms in small time (the
process (Xt, t  0) is but a Markov chain), the action of the generator can be see as the result
of the limit
Lf = lim
(Qt[f ] f) , (4.60)
for suitably smooth f (e.g. continuously differentiable within L+(D  V )). It is easy to show,
and indeed known (cf. e.g. [6, 8]), that the action of the generator corresponding to Q is given
Lf(r, ) =   f(r, ) +
f(r, ) f(r, )
s(r, )s(r, , 
)d, (4.61)
for f  L+(D V ) such that f is well defined (here  is assumed to act on the spatial
variable r). We emphasise again that, in view of Remark 9, this corresponds to motion plus a
branching event with one offspring (or scattering).
The change of measure (4.35) induces a generator action given by
f(r, ) =
w(r, )
L(wf)(r, ) + f(r, )
(r, )
=   f(r, ) +
f(r, ) f(r, )
s(r, )
w(r, )
w(r, )
s(r, , 
)d
+ f(r, )
(r, )
=   f(r, ) +
f(r, ) f(r, )
s(r, )
w(r, )
w(r, )
s(r, , 
)d, (4.62)
where the fact that the right-hand side of (4.35) is a martingale will lead to
Lw +G[w] = 0.
In other words, our heuristic reasoning above shows that the motion on the -marked tree
is tantamount to a w-tilting of the scatting kernel. This tilting favours scattering in a direction
where extinction becomes more likely, and as such,
encourages -marked trees to become
extinct quickly.
Almost identical reasoning shows that the change of measure (4.49) has generator with
action
f(r, ) =
p(r, )
L(pf)(r, ) f(r, )
(r, )
=   f(r, ) +
f(r, ) f(r, )
s(r, )
p(r, )
p(r, )
s(r, , 
)d, (4.63)
for suitably smooth f , where we have again used
Lw +G[w] = 0 and left the calculations that
the second equality from the first as an exercise for the reader. One sees again a p-tilting of
the scattering kernel, and hence L rewards scattering in directions that enable survival. Note,
moreover for regions of D  V for which p(r, ) can be come arbitrarily small (corresponding
to a small probability of survival), the scattering rate also becomes very large, and hence L
urgently scatters particles away from such regions.
4.2.6 Remarks on BBM
On account of the fact that we have stated Theorem 14 for a relatively general MBP with non-
local branching, it is worth pointing to the known example of a BBM in a strip that has previously
been worked out in detail in [14]. This model has the features that P is that of a Brownian motion
with drift  killed on existing an interval [0,K], so that
L = (1/2)d2/dx2 +d/dx, the branching
rate  is constant (not spatially dependent) and the offspring distribution is concentrated at the
point of death of each particle. As such, the generator G in (4.23) takes the simpler form
G[] = E
N  
(4.64)
where it suffices to take  as a number in (0, 1), rather than a function, as there is no spatial
dependency. The extinction probability now solves the differential equation
+G[w] = 0 on (0,K) with w(0) = w(K) = 1.
In order for survival to occur with positive probability, it is required that the leading eigenvalue of
the mean semigroup associated to the branching process, which is  := (m1)2/22/2K,
must satisfy  > 0, where m =
k=0 kpk is the mean number of offspring. Note, the mean
semigroup is the analogue of (4.10) and the leading eigenvalue plays precisely the role of  in
Theorem 11 for the NTE.
For the  process, writing G in (4.36) in a similar format to (4.64), it is straightforward
to verify that it agrees with the branching generator stipulated in analysis of the red tree given
in [14].
However, for the  process, this model also takes the point of view described in Remark 9.
Indeed, it is straightforward to show that the branching generator for the blue tree in [14] agrees
with G given in Remark 9 and the discontinuity associated with a birth of one offspring is
appended to the motion. However, since this model only has local branching and the movement
is a Brownian motion, this does not actually change the motion. On the other hand, this choice
does affect the overall process Xl and leads to two types of immigration of red trees onto the
blue tree: immigration at branch points and immigration along the trajectory, with the latter
immigration occurring at the points corresponding to a birth of one offspring.
When, additionally, the interval [0,K] is replaced by R, the extinction probability w is
no longer spatially dependent and is a simple solution of G[w] = 0. Assuming that w  (0, 1),
it is easy to see that
are both equal to
L and the skeletal decomposition is nothing
more than the original skeletal decomposition for GaltonWatson processes (albeit in continuous
time) given in the book of Harris [16].
4.3 SLLN on the skeleton
Our aim is to use the skeletal decomposition of the neutron branching process to prove Theorem
13 by first stating and proving the analogous result for X. Hence, in what follows, we will
assume (H1), (H2), (H3) and (H4) hold. Before continuing to the proof, let us consider a
useful identity. For a suitable g  L(DV ) and t  0, we have from Theorem 14 (cf. Remark
8) that
E(r,)
g,Xt 
= El(r,)
g, pXt
c(0) =] = 1
p(r, )
E(r,) [gp,Xt] . (4.65)
We can use this identity to show that  is also an eigenvalue for the linear semigroup
of X, as well as to compute the associated left and right eigenfunctions (in a similar sense to
(4.18)). Our first claim is that the right eigenfunction is given by /p. Indeed, for (r, )  DV ,
due to the above computation,
E(r,) [/p,X
t ] =
E(r,) [,Xt]
p(r, )
= et
(r, )
p(r, )
. (4.66)
For the left eigenfunction, again using (4.65), we have
p,E [g,X
t ] = p,E [gp,Xt]/p() = ,E [gp,Xt] = e
tp, g. (4.67)
Hence p is the corresponding left eigenfunction with eigenvalue et.
It now follows by similar arguments to those given in [17] that
t := e
t /p,X
/p, 
, t  0, (4.68)
is a positive martingale under P for   M(D  V ), and hence has a finite limit, which we
denote W .
A second useful fact that we will use is the following result.
Lemma 10. There exists a constant C  (0,) such that suprD,V (r, )/p(r, ) < C.
Proof. Let us introduce the family of measures P := (P ,  M(D  V )), where
= Wt, t  0, (4.69)
We start by noting that, for all r  D,   V , p(r, ) = 1 P(r,)( <) = P(r,)(X survives),
where  is the lifetime of X defined in (4.27). Taking account of (4.69), we can thus write, with
the help of Fatous Lemma and Jensens inequality,
p(r, ) = lim
P(r,)(t < )
= lim
E(r,)
1(t<)
 E(r,) [1/W]
 1/E(r,) [W],
where we note that the indicator is dropped in the first inequality as, from Lemma 6.1 in [17],
the process (X,P) is immortal.
From equations (10.1) and (10.3) in [17], it has already been shown that
E(r,) [W] = limt
E(r,)
e2t
t[1](r, )
(r, )
dt, (4.70)
for some constant c  (0,). Taking account of Theorem 11, which tells us that
ett[1](r, ) = 1, (r, )  1, ,
we deduce that there exists a constant C  (0,), which does not depend on (r, )  D  V ,
such that
p(r, ) 
(r, )
The result now follows.
We are now in a position to state and prove a strong law for the skeleton X.
Theorem 15. For all non-negative and directionally continuous g (in the sense that lims0 g(r + s, ) = g(r, )
for all r  D,   V ) such that, for some constant c > 0, g  c/p,
etg,Xt  = g, p/p, W
. (4.71)
P-almost surely for  M(D  V )
We prove this theorem by breaking it up into several parts. Starting with the following
lemma, we first prove that Theorem 15 holds along lattice times. Our proofs are principally by
techniques that have been used a number of times in the literature, developed by [1, 13, 4, 3]
amongst others. Just before we state the next lemma, it will be convenient to quickly introduce
the notation Ft = (X
s : s  t), t  0.
Lemma 11. Fix  > 0. For non-negative bounded functions g  L+(D  V ), define
Ut = e
tg/p,Xt , t  0. (4.72)
Then, for any non-decreasing sequence (mn)n0 with m0 > 0 and (r, )  D  V ,
|U(mn+n)  E
[U(mn+n)|F
n]| = 0, P
(r,)
-a.s.. (4.73)
Proof. By the Borel-Cantelli lemma, it is sufficient to prove that for each (r, )  DV and all
 > 0, 
P(r,)
(U(mn+n)  E[U(mn+n)|Fn] > ) <.
To this end, note that Markovs inequality gives
P(r,)
(U(mn+n)  E[U(mn+n)|Fn] >  )  2E(r,) (U(mn+n)  E[U(mn+n)|Fn]2) .
Hence, let us consider the term in the conditional expectation on the right-hand side above.
First note that
U(mn+n)  E
[U(mn+n)|F
n] =
en(U
 E[U (i)mn|F
n]), (4.74)
where, conditional on Fn, Zi = U
 E(U (i)mn|F
n) are independent with E[Zi] = 0. The
formula for the variance of sums of zero mean independent random variables together with the
inequality |a+ b|2  2(|a|2 + |b|2), we get
E(|U(mn+n)  E[U(mn+n)|F

where we have used Jensens inequality again in the final inequality. Hence, with {(Ri(n),i(n)) :
i = 1, . . . , Nn} describing the configurations of the particles at time Nn in X, we have
|U(mn+n)  E

where we have used Lemma 10 in the second inequality. From Corollary 5.3 of [17], more
precisely from its proof, we know that E(r,) [supt0W
t ] < . Hence we have from Doobs
maximal inequality that, for each fixed t  0,

for some constant C  which does not depend on (r, ), where we have used (4.70). (Note (4.77)
implies that W  is an L2(P)-convergent martingale.)
Substituting the estimate (4.76) back into (4.75) and making use of the uniform bound-
edness of , we get
|U(mn+n)  E

Taking expectations one more time with respect to P(r,) and appealing to Fubinis Theorem
to exchange the sum and expectation on the left hand side of (4.79) completes the proof of the
lemma.
It is worth noting that a small corollary falls out of the above proof, which will be useful
later on.
Corollary 3. We have supt0W
t is square integrable and hence W
 converges in L2(P).
Proof of Theorem 15 (lattice sequences). We have already noted that
E(r,)
Ft ] = Nt
etU (i)s ,
where, given Ft , the U
s are independent and equal in distribution to Us under P
(Ri(t),i(t))
{(Ri(t),i(t)) : i = 1,    , Nt} describes the configuration of X at time t  0. Hence, once
again using (4.65), the many-to-one formula and the spine change of measure, we have
E(r,)

p(Ri(t),i(t))
(4.80)
Appealing to Theorem 11, we can pick s sufficiently large so that, for any given  > 0,
es1s[g] , g < . (4.81)
Combining this with (4.80) yields
E(r,) [Ut+s|Ft ]W g,  p(r, )(r, )
 = 0. (4.82)
The above combined with the conclusion of Lemma 11 gives the conclusion of Theorem 13 along
lattice sequences.
We now make the transition from lattice times to continuous times.
Proof of Theorem 15 (full sequence). For  > 0 and (r, )  D  V , define
(r, ) :=
(r, )  D  V : g(r, )
(r, )
p(r, )
 (1 + )1g(r, )
(r, )
p(r, )
If we consider the equation (4.30) for the special setting of the NBP, we can decompose it over
the first scatter event, rather than the first fission event, from which we will obtain
w(r, ) = Ut[w](r, ) +
Sw +G[w]
(r, )ds, t  0, x  E,
where the semigroup (Ut, t  0) was defined in (4.4), (Ut, t  0) was defined in (4.14), and the
scattering operator
S was defined in (4.5). This implies that, for a given r  D and   V ,
w(r + t, ), and hence p(r + t, ), are continuous for all t sufficiently small. Similarly noting
that t[] = et, from (4.3), we can also deduce a similar continuity property of . Hence,
together with the assumed directional continuity of g, for each r  D,   V and   1, there
exists a  such that (r + t, )  (r, ) for all t  .
Next, for each  > 0 define
,(r, ) := 1{supp(Xt )(r,) for all t[0,]}
, (r, )  D  V,
and let ,(r, ) = E(r,) [
,(r, )]  1. Appealing to Fatous Lemma and the continuity
properties discussed above, we have, for  1,
lim inf
,(r, )  E(r,) [lim inf0
1{supp(Xt )(r,) for all t[0,]}
= E(r,) [lim0
1{(r+t,)(r,) for all t[0,]}]
Since we can effectively see the skeleton as producing at least two offspring at every fission
event (see Remark 9)8, it follows that if t  [n, (n+ 1)) then,
etg/p,Xt 
(1 + )
eng(Ri(n),i(n))
(Ri(n),i(n))
p(Ri(n),i(n))
,(Ri(n),i(n)). (4.83)
If we denote the summation on the right-hand side of the above equation by Un(r, ), and
assume that supp(g) is compactly embedded in D, then we can apply similar arguments to
those given in the proof of Lemma 11 together with (4.65) to show that
E(r,)
|Un  E[Un|F

p(r, )
e2nE(r,)
(g)2p1, Xn
p(r, )
e2nn[(g)
2p1](r, ). (4.84)
Note in particular that the compact embedding of the support of g in D  V together with
Lemma 10, the fact that p  1,  belongs to L+(D  V ) and is bounded away from 0 on
8Although a subtle point in the argument, this is fundamentally the reason why the skeletal decomposition is
needed and makes the proof much easier than otherwise.
compactly embedded subsets of D  V ensures that (g)2p1 is uniformly bounded away from
0 and  and hence, taking account of the conclusion of Theorem 11, the expectation on the
right-hand side of (4.84) is finite.
Noting that
E[Un|F
n] = e
ng,/p,Xn,
the consequence of (4.84), when taken in the light of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma and the already
proved limit (4.71) on lattice times, means that, P(r,)-almost surely,
lim inf
etg/p,Xt  
1 + 
g,/p, pW 
(r, )
p(r, )
Letting   0 with the help of Fatous Lemma and then   0 in the above inequality yields
lim inf
etg/p,Xt   g, W
(r, )
p(r, )
, (4.85)
P(r,)-almost surely. Now replacing g by hp/, ensuring still that the support of h is compactly
embedded in D  V , so that hp/ is uniformly bounded away from 0 and , the lower bound
(4.85) yields
lim inf
eth,Xt   h, pW
(r, )
p(r, )
. (4.86)
We can push (4.86) a little bit further by removing the requirement that the support of h is
compactly embedded in D  V . Indeed, suppose that, for n  1, hn = h1Bn , where h  c/p
for some constant c > 0 and Bn is an increasing sequence of compactly embedded domains in
D  V , such that n1Bn = D  V . Then (4.86) and together with monotonicity gives us
lim inf
eth,Xt   lim

p(r, )

To complete the proof of Theorem 15 it now suffices to show that, P(r,)-almost surely,
lim supt e
tg,Xt   g, pW
(r, )/p(r, ). To this end note that, for 0  g  c/p,
for some constant c > 0 (which, without loss of generality, we may take equal to 1),

as required, where we have used the normalisation ,  = 1.
4.4 Proof of Theorem 13
The proof we will give relies on the stochastic embedding of the skeleton processX inX together
with a measure theoretic trick. It is worth stating the latter in the format of a proposition
which is essentially taken from [15]. (The reader may note that there is a slight variation in the
statement as the original version was missing an additional condition.)
Proposition 5. Let (,F , (Ft, t  0),P) be a filtered probability space and define F :=
(i=1Ft). Suppose (Ut, t  0) is an F-measurable non-negative process such that supt0 Ut
has finite expectation and (E(Ut|Ft), t  0) is cdlg. If
E(Ut|F) = Y, a.s,
E(Ut|Ft) = Y, a.s..
In fact, this result can be readily obtained by considering Yt := E(Ut|F) then using right
continuity and Hunts Lemma: If Yn  Y a.s., (Yn, n  N) is dominated by supnN |Yn| with
E supnN |Yn| <, then E(Yn|Fn) E(Y |F) a.s..
We will take the quantities in the above proposition from their definition in the context
of the physical process of the neutron transport equation. In a similar fashion to the proof
of Theorem 15, set Ut = etg,X
t , for g  L
(D  V ), and recall that (Ft, t  0) is the
filtration generated by the neutron branching process (Xt, t  0). Note that we can easily bound
(Ut, t  0) by a multiple of (W
t , t  0) and hence we automatically get that supt0 Ut has a
second, and hence first, moments thanks to Corollary (3). Due to Theorem 15 and the fact that
t is F-measurable, Ut = E(Ut|F) and hence
E(Ut|F) = gp, W 
(r, )
p(r, )
P(r,)-almost surely, for r  D,   V .
Using (4.65) (which comes from the skeleton embedding Theorem 14, cf. Remark 8) as we
have in the proof of Theorem 15, we get
E(Ut|Ft) = E(etg,X
t |Ft) = e
tg, pXt.
Combining this with Proposition 5 yields
etg, pXt = gp, W 
(r, )
p(r, )
, (4.88)
P(r,)-almost surely. If the support of g is compactly embedded in DV , then we can replace g
by g/p, with the assurance that the latter is uniformly bounded away from 0 and (cf. Lemma
10), and (4.88) gives us
etg,Xt = g, W 
(r, )
p(r, )
, (4.89)
P(r,)-almost surely. We can remove the assumption that the support of g is compactly embedded
in D  V by appealing to similar reasoning as that of the computation in (4.87).
To complete the proof of almost sure convergence, we need to show that W /p = W,
almost surely. To do so, note that if we take g =  in (4.89), noting that the left-hand side is
equal to limtWt(r, ) and ,  = 1, we get the desired result.
Finally, for the convergence in L2(P), first recall that we already know that E(supt0W 2t ) <
by Doobs Lp-inequality and L2(P)-boundedness of W (see discussion within proof of Lemma
11). Then, by assumption g  , we similarly have supt0g,Xt in L2(P), hence we can use
the dominated convergence theorem to conclude that we have convergence in L2(P), as well as
almost surely. 
4.5 Concluding remarks
The proof of Theorem 13 above gives a generic approach for branching particle systems which
have an identified skeletal decomposition. Indeed, the reasoning is robust and will show in any
such situation that the existence of a strong law of large numbers for the skeleton implies almost
immediately a strong law of large numbers for the original process into which the skeleton is
embedded. As an exercise, the reader is encouraged to consider the setting of a branching
Brownian motion in a strip (cf. [14]). Supposing a strong law of large numbers exists on
the skeleton there (in that setting it is called the blue tree), then we claim that the the
above reasoning applied verbatim will deliver the strong law of large numbers for the branching
Brownian motion in a strip.
More generally, we claim that, modulo some minor technical modifications (e.g. taking
account of the fact that E may be unbounded), in the general MBP setting of Theorem 14, an
analogue of Theorem 13 may be reconstructed once the following three important components are
in hand: (i) An analogue of Theorem 11; (ii) A degree of knowledge concerning the continuity
properties of  and p; (iii) the martingale W has the property Ex [supt0W
t ] <, for all
x  E. Indeed, last of these three may be weakened to -integrability of the martingale W , for
  (1, 2), in which case one may replace many of the estimates in the Borel-Cantelli arguments
by  moment estimates instead of second moment estimates (see e.g. [13] for comparison).
It is also worth pointing out however that the reasoning in the proof of Theorem 13 does not
so obviously work in the setting of superprocesses with a skeletal decomposition. Indeed a crucial
step, which is automatic for branching particle systems, but less obvious for superprocesses, is
the point in the argument at which we claim that Ut = E(Ut|F). In the particle system, this
statement follows immediately from the fact that F carries enough information to construct
the marks  and  on particles because individual genealogical lines of descent are identifiable.
For superprocesses, it is less clear how to choose the filtration (Ft, t  0) so that the notion of
genealogy or otherwise can be used to claim that Xt , and hence Ut, is F-measurable.

Concluding remarks
We considered the supercritical regime in order to characterise the growth of the system when
extinction is not guaranteed. We obtained a strong law of large number result by considering a
skeletal deomposition of the neutron branching process, which pertains to splitting the process
into a tree which contains the particles that survive forever, and the remaining subtrees which
all go extinct. For completeness, we also obtained a weak law of large numbers.
In the next chapter, we will consider a stationary eigenvalue problem. We will demonstrate
the robustness of the methods developed in the previous chapters by applying them to this time-
independent setting.

Abstract
The Neutron Transport Equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons over time through an
inhomogeneous fissile medium. In the recent articles [5, 10], a probabilistic solution of the NTE
is considered in order to demonstrate a Perron-Frobenius type growth of the solution via its
projection onto an associated leading eigenfunction. In [9, 4], further analysis is performed to
understand the implications of this growth both in the stochastic sense, as well as from the
perspective of Monte-Carlo simulation.
Such Monte-Carlo simulations are prevalent in industrial applications, in particular where
regulatory checks are needed in the process of reactor core design. In that setting, however, it
turns out that a different notion of growth takes centre stage, which is otherwise characterised
by another eigenvalue problem. In that setting, the eigenvalue, sometimes called k-effective
(written keff), has the physical interpretation as being the ratio of neutrons produced (during
fission events) to the number lost (due to absorption in the reactor or leakage at the boundary)
per typical fission event.
In this article, we aim to supplement [5, 10, 9, 4], by developing the stochastic analysis
of the NTE further to the setting where a rigorous probabilistic interpretation of keff is given,
both in terms of a Perron-Frobenius type analysis as well as via classical operator analysis.

To our knowledge, despite the fact that an extensive engineering literature and industrial
Monte-Carlo software is concentrated around the estimation of keff and its associated eigenfunc-
tion, we believe that our work is the first rigorous treatment in the probabilistic sense (which
underpins some of the aforesaid Monte-Carlo simulations).
5.1 Introduction
As described in [10, 9, 5] the NTE is a balance equation for the flux of neutrons across a planar
cross-section in an inhomogeneous fissile medium. The backwards form of the equation can be
written as follows,
t(r, ) =   t(r, ) (r, )t(r, )
+ s(r, )
t(r, 
)s(r, , 
)d + f(r, )
t(r, 
)f(r, , 
)d, (5.1)
where the flux t(r, ) is a function of time, t and the configuration variables (r, )  D  V
where D  R3 is a non-empty, smooth, bounded convex domain such that D has zero Lebesgue
measure, and V = {  R3 : min  ||  max}. Furthermore, the other components of (5.1)
have the following interpretation:
s(r, ) : the rate at which scattering occurs from incoming velocity ,
f(r, ) : the rate at which fission occurs from incoming velocity ,
(r, ) : the sum of the rates f + s and is known as the total cross section,
s(r, , 
)d : the scattering yield at velocity  from incoming velocity ,
satisfying
s(r, , 
)d = 1, and
f(r, , 
)d : the neutron yield at velocity  from fission with incoming velocity ,
satisfying
f(r, , 
)d <.
We also enforce the following initial and boundary conditions
0(r, ) = g(r, ) for r  D,   V,
t(r, ) = 0 for t  0 and r  D if   nr > 0,
(5.2)
where nr is the outward unit normal at r  D and g : D  V  [0,) is a bounded,
measurable function. Throughout we will rely on the following assumptions in some (but not
all) of our results:
(H1): Cross-sections s, f, s and f are uniformly bounded away from infinity.
(H2): We have ss + ff > 0 on D  V  V .
(H3): There is an open ball B compactly embedded in D such that ff > 0 on
B  V  V .
(H4): the fission offspring are bounded in number by the constant Nmax > 1.
Note, the assumption (H1) ensures that all activity occurs at a maximum rate. Assumption
(H2) ensures that at least some activity occurs, whether it be scattering or fission, together with
(H3), it ensures that there is at least some fission as well as scattering. Finally (H4) is a
physical constraint that is natural to nuclear fission, typically no more than 3 neutrons are
produced during an average fission event. Figure 5.1 illustrates the complex nature of the in
homogeneity in the domain one typically considers.
Figure 5-1: The geometry of a nuclear reac-
tor core representing a physical domain D, on
to which the different cross-sectional values of
s, f, s, f are mapped, also as a function of
neutron velocity.
Due to the irregular nature of gradient
operator, (5.1) is meaningless in the point-
wise sense, so it is often stated in one of
two forms. The first is to treat (5.1) as a
weak linear partial integro-differential equa-
tion (PIDE) in an appropriate Banach space,
usually L2(D  V ), the space of functions f :
D  V 7 [0,) which are finite with respect
to the norm f2 = (
DV f(r, )drd)
1/2);
see e.g. [6, 7, 15]. The second is to consider
the integral or mild form of (5.1). We refer the
reader to [10, 9, 5] and the references therein
for a discussion on the various formulations of
the NTE and its solution. We will also elabo-
rate on both in the forthcoming discussion.
For both formats of (5.1), the papers
[6, 7, 15, 10, 5] dealt with the time-eigenvalue
problem and an associated Perron-Frobenius
decomposition. More precisely, they give a
rigorous stochastic meaning to the asymptotic
t  etcg+ o(et), (5.3)
as t  , where  and  are the leading eigenvalue and associated eigenfunction associated
to the NTE in the appropriate sense and cg is a constant that depends on the initial data g.
Such an understanding is important as it promotes a number of different Monte-Carlo
algorithms that can be used to estimate both the lead eigenvalue  and the associated non-
negative eigenfunction . The latter can be formulated as an eigenpair in L2(D V ) satisfying
(T + S + F) = , (5.4)
on D  V , where


T f(r, ) :=   f(r, ) (r, )
Sf(r, ) := s(r, )
f(r, )s(r, , 
)d
Ff(r, ) := f(r, )
f(r, )f(r, , 
)d,
(5.5)
Here, we can think of  as characterising the rate of growth of flux in the system over time.
It turns out that, predominantly in industrial, engineering and (some) physics literature,
there is another eigenvalue problem that plays a fundamental role in the design and safety of
nuclear reactors; see for example Section 1.5 of [13]. The aforesaid eigenvalue problem involves
finding (in any appropriate sense) an eigenpair k and  such that
(T + S)+
F = 0. (5.6)
The leading eigenvalue, which in the nuclear regulation industry is called k-effective, writ-
ten keff, has the physical interpretation as being the ratio of neutrons produced (during fission
events) to the number lost (due to absorption in the reactor or leakage at the boundary). An-
other interpretation of k is that it represents the average number of neutrons produced per
fission event. It is this second interpretation which we exploit, since keff acts as a measure of
neutrons produced between fission generations.
It is worth noting that the two eigenproblems offer potentially different sets of solutions,
however, they agree in terms of criticality. More precisely, in (5.4), the triple (T ,S,F) is called
critical if the leading eigenvalue, , in (5.4) is zero, and otherwise called subcritical (resp.
supercritical) if  < 0 (resp.  > 0). In the setting of (5.6), the triple (T ,S,F) is called
critical if keff = 1 and subcritical (resp. supercritical) if keff < 1 (resp. keff > 1).
We note however that in [2], there is a relationship between the two eigenvalues, regardless
of the criticality of the system and at criticality, both (5.4) and (5.6) agree.
The main objective of this paper is to put into a rigorous setting the existence of the
leading solutions to (5.6) in the two main contexts that the NTE (5.1) is understood; that is,
the weak linear PIDE context and the probabilistic context. Moreover, in the mild setting, we
will build an expectation semigroup, say (n, n  0), out of a stochastic process such that
n[g]  kneffCg+ o(k
eff),
for g  L+(D  V ), as n  , and an appropriate choice of Cg  0. (See Theorem 22
below.) This also provides a mathematically rigorous underpinning for many of the Monte-
Carlo algorithms that are used in industry for computing keff. We will offer further discussion
in this direction at the end of the paper.
The rest of this article is organised as follows. In the next section, we formally introduce
the description of (5.1) as a PIDE on a functional space, that is, we describe it as an abstract
Cauchy problem. Moreover, we introduce two underlying stochastic processes, both of which
can be used to describe the solution to the mild NTE. Also in this section, we introduce a
second mild equation, (5.19), whose eigen-solutions give us a sense in which we can characterise
solutions to (5.6).
In Section 5.3, we provide a solution to the newly introduced mild equation (5.19). In
addition, we state the main result of this paper (Theorem 19) which shows the existence of a
lead eigensolution to (5.19).
In Section 5.4, for comparison, we show how to construct and give meaning to the lead
eigensolution to (5.6) in the setting of a functional space. In addition, we show how the two
notions of the lead eigensolution, in this and the previous section, agree.
In Section 5.5, we give the proof of the main result of Section 5.3. Finally, we conclude in
Section 5.6 with some discussion concerning the relevance of such results to previous work and
Monte-Carlo methods.
5.2 Formulations of the NTE and associated eigenfunctions
As alluded to in the introduction, there are two principal ways in which the NTE is formu-
lated. In this section, we will elaborate on them in a little more mathematical detail for later
convenience and context of our main results.
5.2.1 Abstract Cauchy Problem (ACP)
Following e.g. [6, 7, 15], we want to formulate (5.1) in the function space L2(D  V ). The
so-called (initial-value) abstract Cauchy problem (ACP) takes the form
Aut and u0 = g, (5.7)
where
A = T + S + F and ut belongs to the space L2(D  V ), for t  0 (in particular g 
L2(DV )). Specifically, (ut, t  0) is continuously differentiable in the space L2(DV ), meaning
there exists a ut  L2(D  V ), which is time-continuous in L2(D  V ) with respect to 2 and
such that limh0 h1(ut+h  ut) = ut for all t  0. Necessarily, the solution to (5.7) forms a
c0-semigroup5. Moreover, Dom(
A) := {g  L2(D  V ) :   g  L2(D  V ) and g|D+ = 0} is
the domain of
A and ut  Dom(
A) for all t  0.
5Recall that a c0-semigroup (Vt, t  0) also goes by the name of a strongly continuous semigroup and, in the
present context, this means it has has the properties that (i) V0 = Id, (ii) Vt+s[g] = Vt[Vs[g]], for all s, t  0,
g  L2(D  V ) and (iii) for all g  L2(D  V ), limh0Vh[g] g2 = 0.
Theorem 16. Suppose (H1) holds. For g  L2(D V ), the unique solution to (5.7) is given by
(Vt, t  0), the c0-semigroup generated by (
A ,Dom(
A)), i.e. the orbit Vt[g] := exp(t
In the ACP setting, the notion of an eigenpair (, ) is well formulated on L2(D V ) via
(5.4). Equivalently, it means we are looking for   L+2 (D  V ) and  such that Vt[] = e
on L+2 (D  V ), for all t  0. The sense in which we mean that  is a leading eigenvalue
roughly boils down it corresponding to the eigenvalue in the spectrum of the operator A on
L2(D  V ) with the largest real part (and, as usual, it is real valued itself), and moreover, its
associated eigenfunction  is non-negative. As such, one expects the existence of a non-negative
left eigenfunction  (e.g. in the sense that , Vt[g] = et, g for t  0) such that
etVt[g] , g2 = o(et), (5.8)
as t  . Here, we use the notation f, g =
DV f(r, )g(r, )drd, so that 2 = , 
Precise results of this nature can be found in [7, 15, 5].
5.2.2 Neutron branching process (NBP) and the mild NTE
We recall the neutron branching process (NBP) defined in [10], which at time t  0 is represented
by a configuration of particles which are specified via their physical location and velocity inDV ,
say {(ri(t), i(t)) : i = 1, . . . , Nt}, where Nt is the number of particles alive at time t  0. The
NBP is then given by the empirical distribution of these configurations,
Xt(A) =
(ri(t),i(t))(A), A  B(D  V ), t  0, (5.9)
where  is the Dirac measure, defined on B(D  V ), the Borel subsets of D  V .
The evolution of (Xt, t  0) is a stochastic process valued in the space of atomic measures
M(D  V ) := {
i=1(ri,i) : n  N, (ri, i)  D  V, i = 1,    , n} which evolves randomly as
follows.
A particle positioned at r with velocity  will continue to move along the trajectory r+t,
until one of the following things happens.
(i) The particle leaves the physical domain D, in which case it is instantaneously killed.
(ii) Independently of all other neutrons, a scattering event occurs when a neutron comes in
close proximity to an atomic nucleus and, accordingly, makes an instantaneous change
of velocity. For a neutron in the system with position and velocity (r, ), if we write Ts
for the random time that scattering may occur, then independently of any other physical
event that may affect the neutron, Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
s(r + s, )ds}, for t  0.
When scattering occurs at space-velocity (r, ), the new velocity   V is selected inde-
pendently with probability s(r, , )d.
(iii) Independently of all other neutrons, a fission event occurs when a neutron smashes into
an atomic nucleus. For a neutron in the system with initial position and velocity (r, ),
if we write Tf for the random time that scattering may occur, then, independently of any
other physical event that may affect the neutron, Pr(Tf > t) = exp{
f(r + s, )ds},
for t  0.
When fission occurs, the smashing of the atomic nucleus produces lower mass isotopes
and releases a random number of neutrons, say N  0, which are ejected from the point
of impact with randomly distributed, and possibly correlated, velocities, say {i : i =
1,    , N}. The outgoing velocities are described by the atomic random measure
Z(A) :=
i(A), A  B(V ). (5.10)
If such an event occurs at location r  Rd from a particle with incoming velocity   V ,
we denote by P(r,) the law of Z. The probabilities P(r,) are such that, for   V , for
bounded and measurable g : V  [0,),
g()f(r, v, 
)d = E(r,)
g()Z(d)
=: E(r,)[g,Z]. (5.11)
Note, the possibility that Pr(N = 0) > 0, which will be tantamount to neutron capture
(that is, where a neutron slams into a nucleus but no fission results and the neutron is
absorbed into the nucleus).
The NBP is thus parameterised by the quantities s, s, f and the family of measures
P = (P(r,), r  D,   V ) and accordingly we refer to it as a (s, s, f,P)-NBP. It is associated
to the NTE via the relation (5.11), and, although a (s, s, f,P)-NBP is uniquely defined, a
NBP specified by (s, s, f, f) alone is not. Nonetheless, it is easy to show that for a given
f, a (s, s, f,P)-NBP always exists which satisfies (5.11). See the discussion in Section 2 of
[10].
Define
t[g](r, ) := E(r,) [g,Xt], t  0, r  D,   V, (5.12)
where P(r,) is the law of X initiated from a single particle with configuration (r, ), and g 
L+(DV ), the space of non-negative uniformly bounded measurable functions on DV . Here
we have made a slight abuse of notation (see ,  as it appears in (5.11)) and written g,Xt to
DV g(r, )Xt(dr, d). The following result was shown in [5, 10, 7, 6].
Theorem 17. Suppose (H1) and (H2) hold. For g  L+(D  V ), the space of non-negative
and uniformly bounded measurable functions on D  V , there exist constants C1, C2 > 0 such
that t[g], as given in (5.12), is uniformly bounded by C1 exp(C2t), for all t  0. Moreover,
(t[g], t  0) is the unique solution, which is bounded in time, to the so-called mild equation
t[g] = Ut[g] +
F)ts[g]]ds, t  0, (5.13)
for which (5.2) holds, where the deterministic evolution Ut[g](r, ) = g(r + t, )1{t<Dr,}, t  0,
with Dr, := inf{t > 0 : r + t 6 D}, represents the advection semigroup associated with a single
neutron travelling at velocity  from r at t = 0.
In [5] the below result was shown, which demonstrates the context in which the mild
solution to the NTE and the ACP can be seen to coincide.
Theorem 18. Suppose (H1) and (H2) hold. If g  L+(DV ) and if (t[g], t  0) is understood
as the solution to the mild equation (5.13), then for t  0, Vt[g] = t[g] on L+2 (D  V ), i.e.
Vt[g] t[g]2 = 0.
In the probabilistic setting, the meaning of (5.4) can be interpreted as looking for a pair
 and  such that, pointwise on D  V , t[] = et, for t  0. As alluded to in (5.3), we
have a similar asymptotic to (5.8), which isolates the eigenpair (, ) in its limit. The notion of
leading in the probabilistic setting is less obvious, however, due to Theorem 18, the eigenpairs
that emerge from the mild setting and the weak linear PIDE setting should in principle agree
on L2(D  V ). This is discussed with greater precision in [5, 10].
5.2.3 Neutron random walk (NRW)
There is a second stochastic representation of the unique solution to (5.13), which makes use of
the so-called neutron random walk (NRW). This process takes values in DV and is defined by
its scatter rates, (r, ), r  D,   V , and scatter probability densities (r, , ), r  D, ,  
V . When issued with a velocity , the NRW will propagate linearly with that velocity until
either it exits the domain D, in which case it is killed, or at the random time Ts a scattering
occurs, where Pr(Ts > t) = exp{
(r + t, )ds}, for t  0. When the scattering event
occurs at position-velocity configuration (r, ), a new velocity  is selected with probability
(r, , )d. If we denote by (R,) = ((Rt,t), t  0), the position-velocity of the resulting
continuous-time random walk on D  V with an additional cemetery state for when it leaves
the domain D, it is easy to show that (R,) is a Markov process. We call the process (R,)
an -NRW.
Given a NBP defined by s, f, s and P, set
(r, )(r, , ) = s(r, )s(r, , 
) + f(r, )f(r, , 
) r  D, ,   V. (5.14)
(r, ) = f(r, )
f(r, , 
)d  1
. (5.15)
The following result, given in [5], gives the so-called many-to-one representation of solution to
the NTE in the form (5.13).
Lemma 12. Suppose (H1) and (H2) hold, we have that
t[g](r, ) = E(r,)
(Rs,s)dsg(Rt,t)1{t<D}
, t  0, r  D,   V, (5.16)
is a second representation of the unique mild solution (in the sense of Theorem 17) of the NTE
(5.13), where D = inf{t > 0 : Rt 6 D} and P(r,v) for the law of the -NRW starting from a
single neutron with configuration (r, ).
5.2.4 Neutron generational process (NGP)
In order to solve the k-eigenvalue problem (5.6), it turns out that (t, t  0) and (t, t  0)
are not the right objects to work with on account of their time-dependency. We now consider
a generational model of the NBP. We can think of each line of descent in the sequence of
neutron creation as genealogies. In place of (Xt, t  0), we consider the process (Xn, n  0),
where, for n  1, Xn is M(D  V )-valued and can be written Xn =
i=1 (r(n)i ,
, where
{(r(n)i , 
i ), i = 1,    Nn} are the position-velocity configurations of the Nn particles that are
n-th in their genealogies to be the result of a fission event. X0 is consistent with X0 and is the
initial configuration of neutron positions and velocities. As such, for n  1 we can think of Xn
as the n-th generation of the system and we refer to them as the neutron generational process
(NGP). The reader who is more experienced with the theory of branching processes will know
Xn to be an example of what is called a stopping line; see [12].
Appealing to the obvious meaning of g,Xn, define the expectation semigroup (n, n  0)
n[g](r, ) = E(r,) [g,Xn] , n  0, r  D,   V, (5.17)
with 0[g] := g  L+(D  V ). The main motivation for introducing the NGP is that, just as
we have seen that the meaning of (5.4) can be phrased in terms of a multiplicative invariance
with respect to the solution of an ACP (5.7) or of the mild equation (5.13), we want to identify
the eigen-problem (5.6) in terms of the semigroup above.
To this end, let us introduce the problem of finding a pair k > 0 and   L+(DV ) such
that, pointwise,
1[](r, ) = k(r, ), r  D,   V. (5.18)
In the next section we will show the existence of a solution to (5.18) which also plays an important
role in the asymptotic behaviour of n as n  . Before getting there, let us give a heuristic
argument as to why (5.18) is another form of the eigenvalue problem (5.6).
By splitting on the first fission event, n solves the following mild equation
n[g](r, ) =
Qs [Fn1[g]] (r, )ds, r  D,   V, g  L+(D  V ), (5.19)
where (Qs, s  0) is the expectation semigroup associated with the operator T + S. More
precisely,
Qs[g](r, ) = E(r,)
f(Ru,u)dug(Rs,s)1(s<D)
, (5.20)
where (Rs,s)s0 is the ss-NRW. Then, if the pair (k, ) solves (5.18), the strong Markov
property along with an iteration implies that
kn(r, ) = n[](r, ), r  D,   V.
Using it in (5.19) and dividing through by kn yields
(r, ) =
(r, )ds. (5.21)
Now set
Vt :=
Qs [g] (r, )ds.
Then, heuristically speaking, since Q is associated to the generator T +S, classical Feynman-Kac
theory suggests that Vt solves the equation
= (T + S)Vt + g.
with V0 = 0. Note that Vt/t = Qt[g], which tends to zero as t thanks to the transience of
(R,). Hence, taking g = k1F, letting t in the above equation, recalling that (Qs, s  0)
is the expectation semigroup associated with the operator T + S, and using the identity (5.21)
yields
0 = (T + S)+
5.3 Probabilistic solution to (5.6)
In this section we state our main result regarding the existence of the eigenvalue and eigenfunc-
tion as specified by (5.18). We are once more motivated by the ideas presented in [3] and will
use some of the techniques that were further developed in [10].
We start by constructing the many-to-one formula that is associated to the semigroup
(n, n  0) in the spirit of the two representations of (t, t  0) given in Sections 5.2.2 and
5.2.3. In this case it takes a slightly different form to the one in the time-dependent case. For
ease of notation, let
m(r, ) :=
f(r, , 
)d,
denote the mean number of offspring generated by a fission event at (r, ), and let (Tn, n  1)
denote the time of the scatter event in the -NRW that corresponds to the n-th fission event
in the corresponding NBP, X.
More formally, referring to, (5.14), we can think of the -NRW at each scatter event
as follows. For k  1, when the NRW (R,) scatters for the k-th time at (r, ) (with rate
(r, )), a coin is tossed and the random variable Ik(r, ) takes the value 1 with probabil-
ity f(r, )m(r, )/(s(r, ) + f(r, )m(r, )) and its new velocity, is selected according to an
independent copy of the random variable fk(r, ), whose distribution has probability density
f(r, , 
)/m(r, ). On the other hand, with probability s(r, )/(s(r, ) + f(r, )m(r, ))
the random variable Ik(r, ) takes the value 0 and its new velocity, is selected according to an
independent copy of the random variable sk(r, ), whose distribution has probability density
s(r, , 
). As such, the velocity immediately after the n-th scatter of the NRW, given that the
position-velocity configuration immediately before is (r, ), is coded by the random variable
Ik(r, )
k(r, ) + (1 Ik(r, ))
k(r, ).
We thus can identify sequentially, T0 = 0 and, for n  1,
Tn = inf{t > Tn1 : t 6= t and Ikt(Rt,t) = 1},
where (kt, t  0) is the process counting the number of scattering events of the NRW up to time
Note, for the above construction of indicators to make sense, we should at least have some
region of space for which fission can take place. As such the assumption (H3) becomes relevant
here. Analogously to Lemma 12, we have the following many-to-one formula associated with the
Lemma 13. Suppose (H1), (H2) and (H3) hold. The solution to (5.19) among the class of
expectation semigroups is unique for g  L+(D  V ) and the semigroup (n, n  0) may
alternatively be represented6 as
n[g](r, ) = E(r,)
m(RTi ,Ti)g(RTn ,Tn)1(Tn<D)
, r  D,   V, n  1, (5.22)
(with 0[g] = g), where (Rt,t)t0 is the -NRW, and
D := inf{t > 0 : Rt / D}.
Proof. We first note that the sequence (n, n  0) as defined in (5.22) is a semigroup since, due
6Here, we define
 := 1.
to the strong Markov property, we have
n+m[g](r, )
= E(r,)
m(RTi ,Ti)g(RTn+m ,Tn+m)1(Tn+m<D)
Fn
= E(r,)
m(RTi ,Ti)E(RTn ,Tn )
m(RTi ,Ti)g(RTm ,Tm)1(Tm<D)
1(Tn<D)
= n[m[g]](r, ), r  D,   V.
In order to show that n as defined in (5.22) does indeed solve (5.19), we consider the
process at time T1. Before doing so, we first note that the -NRW is exactly the same as the
ss-NRW over the time interval [0, T1) and, at time T1, the velocity of the former is chosen
according to the expectation operator
F [g](r, ) :=
g(r, )
f(r, , 
m(r, )
Then, applying the strong Markov property at time T1,
n[g](r, ) = E(r,)
m(RTi ,Ti)g(RTn ,Tn)1(Tn<D)
= E(r,)
m(RT1 ,T1)F [n1[g]](RT1 ,T1)1(T1<D)
E(r,)
f(Rs,s)e
f(Ru,u)dum(Rs,s)F [n1[g]](Rs,s)1(s<D)
Qs[Fn1[g]](r, )ds,
where the final equality follows from the fact that mfF = F .
It remains to show that (5.19) has a unique solution for g  L+(D  V ) among the class
of expectation semigroups, suppose that (n, n  0) is another such solution with 0 = g 
L+(D V ). Define n = n n, for n  0, and note by linearity that (n, n  0) is another
expectation semigroup with 0 = 0. Moreover, by linearity (n, n  0) also solves (5.19). On
account of this, it is straightforward to see by induction that if n = 0 then n+1 = 0. The
uniqueness of (5.19) in the class of expectation semigroups thus follows.
The next result will provide the existence of a solution to (5.18) by working directly with
a variant of the semigroup (n, n  0). To this end, note that, under the assumption (H4), for
non-negative functions g that are bounded by one, say, we have
E(r,) [g,X1]  gE(r,) [1,X1]  Nmax. (5.23)
Dividing both sides of the above inequality yields a sub-Markovian semigroup. Indeed,
n[g](r, ) := N
maxn[g](r, )
= E(r,)
m(RTi ,Ti)
g(RTn ,Tn)1(Tn<D)
= E(r,)
g(RTn ,Tn)1(Tn<D, n<)
(r,)
[g(RTn ,Tn)] , (5.24)
where  = min{n  0 : Kn(RTn ,Tn) = 1} where, for n  0, r  D and   V , the random
variable Kn(r, ) is an independent indicator random variable which is equal to 0 with probability
m(r, )/Nmax (note, from the assumptions in Section 5.1, it follows that suprD,V m(r, ) 
Nmax).
We are now ready to state the main result of this section, and indeed the article. As its
proof is quite lengthy we will delay it until Section 5.5. We will need the following stronger
assumption of (H3):
(H3): The fission cross section satisfies infrD,,V f(r, )f(r, , ) > 0.
Theorem 19. Under the assumptions (H1), (H3) and (H4), for the semigroup (n, n  0)
identified by (5.19), there exist k  R, a positive7 right eigenfunction   L+(DV ) and a left
eigenmeasure, , on D  V , both having associated eigenvalue kn . Moreover, k is the leading
eigenvalue in the sense that, for all g  L+(D  V ),
,n[g] = kn , g (resp. n[] = k
) n  0, (5.25)
and there exists  > 1 such that, for all g  L+(D  V ),
gL+(DV ):g1
kn 1n[g] , g = O(n) as n +. (5.26)
5.4 Classical existence of solution to (5.6)
Our objective here is to make rigorous the sense in which solving (5.18) is consistent with solving
the eigenvalue problem (5.6) in the classical sense.
We begin by considering the abstract Cauchy problem (ACP) on L2(D  V ),
ut = (T + S)ut
u0 = g.
(5.27)
7To be precise, by a positive eigenfunction, we mean a mapping from DV  (0,). This does not prevent
it being valued zero on D, as D is open.
Then, just as in the spirit of Theorems 16 and 18, it is not difficult to show that the operator
(T +S,Dom(T +S)) generates a unique solution to (5.27) via the c0-semigroup (Vt, t  0) given
Vt[g] := exp(t(T + S))g,
on L2(DV ) (and hence for g  L2(DV )). Moreover, we have that the expectation semigroup
(Qt, t  0) agrees with (Vt, t  0) on L2(D  V ), providing g  L+(D  V ). This latter claim
follows the same idea as the proof of Theorem 8.1 in [5].
The equivalence of the semigroups (Qt, t  0) and (Vt, t  0) is what we will use to
identify a classical (in the L2-sense) and probabilistic meaning to (5.6). We start by showing
the classical existence of a solution to (5.6) on L2(D V ). We note that this problem has been
previously considered in [14, 15]. In [14], the author converted the criticality problem (5.6) into
a time-dependent problem in order to exploit the existing theory for time-dependent problems,
whereas the methods used in [15, Section 5.11] are similar to those presented in [5]. Another
more restrictive version of assumption (H2) is needed, which also implies that (H3) holds:
(H5): We have s(r, )s(r, , ) > 0 and f(r, )f(r, , ) > 0 on D  V  V .
Theorem 20. Suppose that the cross sections ff and ss are piecewise continuous8. Further,
assume that (H1) and (H5) hold. Then there exist a real eigenvalue k > 0 and associated
eigenfunction   L+2 (DV ) such that (5.6) holds on L2(DV ). Moreover, k can be explicitly
identified as
k = sup
|| : (T + S)+
F = 0 for some   L2(D  V )
. (5.28)
Proof. We start by considering a related eigenvalue problem. First recall from [5] that, due to
the transience of T on D, there exist constants M1,  > 0 such that etT   M1et for each
t  0. Further, since S is conservative, there exists M2 > 0 such that9 etS  M2, t  0.
Hence Vt  Met, t  0, where M = M1M2. Then, classical semigroup theory [18] gives
the existence of the resolvent operator (I  (T + S))1 for all  such that Re > , where
I is the identity operator on L2(D  V ). In particular, the resolvent is well-defined for  = 0.
Hence, the eigenvalue problem (5.6) is equivalent to
 (T + S)1F = k. (5.29)
Due to the assumptions (H1) and (H5), almost identical arguments to those given in the proof
of [5, Proposition 9.1] show that (T + S)1F is a positive, compact, irreducible operator.
8A function is piecewise continuous if its domain can be divided into an exhaustive finite partition (e.g.
polytopes) such that there is continuity in each element of the partition. This is precisely how cross sections are
stored in numerical libraries for modelling of nuclear reactor cores.
9We use the standard definition of operator norm, namely A = supf21Af2, where, as before, 2 is
the usual norm on L2(D  V ).
Concluding in the same way as the aforementioned proposition, de Pagters theorem [15, The-
orem 5.7] implies that its spectral radius, r((T + S)1F), is strictly positive. It follows
from the Krein-Rutman Theorem [5, Theorem 9.1] that k := r((T + S)1F) := sup{|| :
(T + S)1F =  for some   L2(D  V )} is the leading eigenvalue of the operator
(T + S)1F with corresponding positive eigenfunction .
In a similar manner to [5], we are able to provide more information about the structure of
the spectrum of the operator (T + S)1F .
Proposition 6. Under the assumptions of Theorem 20, the part of the spectrum given by
((T +S)1F){ : Re() > 0} consists of finitely many eigenvalues with finite multiplicities.
In particular, k is both algebraically and geometrically simple10.
Proof. We follow the idea of the proof of [15, Theorem 4.13] and consider the invertibility of the
operator I + (T + S)1F by considering the following problem,(
(T + S)1F
for   ((T + S)1F)  { : Re() > 0}. Note that this latter set is non-empty on account
of the previous theorem.
As stated in the proof of Theorem 20, the operator 1(T +S)1F is compact in L2(D
V ) so that by Gohberg-Shmulyans Theorem [16],
I + 1(T + S)1F
)1 exists except for a
finite set of discrete degenerate poles. This implies that
I + (T + S)1F
,   ((T +
S)1F)  { : Re() > 0} exists except for a finite set of eigenvalues with finite multiplicities.
We now prove that k is a simple eigenvalue of the operator (T + S)1F . In order to do
so, we need to consider the adjoint eigenvalue problem
F>(T > + S>)1> = k>>, (5.30)
where T > denotes the adjoint of T , with similar definitions for F> and S>.
We first note that, since the operator T > + S> enjoys similar properties to T + S, the
same methods as those given in the proof of Theorem 21 apply to give existence of a leading
eigenvalue k> and corresponding eigenfunction >. Now, due to [11, p.184], if  is an isolated
eigenvalue of (T +S)1F , then its complex conjugate, , is an isolated eigenvalue of the adjoint
of (T + S)1F with the same multiplicity. Equivalently, for each isolated  solving (5.6)
with eigenfunction ,  solves (5.30) with a corresponding eigenfunction > and has the same
multiplicity as . In particular, since k is real, it follows that the leading eigenvalue associated
with (5.30) is also k. These observations along with similar arguments to those presented in [7,
Theorem 7(iii)] and [19] yield geometric simplicity of k. Then straightforward adaptations of
the arguments in [7, Remark 12] yield algebraic simplicity.
10An eigenvalue  associated with an operator A is geometrically simple if dim(ker(I  A)) = 1 and alge-
braically simple if supk1 dim(ker(I A)
k) = 1
The next result shows that if we can find a solution to (5.6), then it must necessarily agree
with the eigensolution constructed in Theorem 19 on L2(D  V ).
Theorem 21. Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 20 are in force11, that (k, ) solves (5.18)
and (k, ) denotes the leading eigensolution to (5.6). Then k = k, and, up to a positive constant
multiple,  agrees with  on L2(D  V ).
Proof. Recall the semigroup, (Vt)t0, generated by T +S and note that, due to boundedness of
the operator F , if g  Lp(D  V ), then Fg  Lp(D  V ), p  [1,]. Thanks to [8, Chapter II,
Lemma 1.3], (Vt)t0 satisfies
Vt[Fg] = (T + S)
Vs[Fg]ds+ Fg. (5.31)
Letting t in the above equation, we obtain
0 = (T + S)
Vs[Fg]ds+ Fg, (5.32)
which follows from the fact that (T +S) is a transient operator so that limt Vt[g] = 0. Setting
g =  in (5.32) and using the fact that (Qs, s  0) and (Vs, s  0) agree on L2(DV ), providing
g  L+(D  V ), yields
0 = (T + S)
Qs[F]ds+ F. (5.33)
Now taking advantage of (5.18) for , noting in particular (5.19), we have 
Qs[F] = 1[] = k. (5.34)
Substituting this into (5.33) shows that (k, ) is a solution to (5.6) on L2(D  V ).
To conclude the proof, we first show that k = k. Again, consider the adjoint prob-
lem (5.30) and note that
0 = (T + S)1F, >  F>(T > + S>)1>, 
= (k  k)>, .
Since  and > are positive, we must have k = k. Due to simplicity of k from the previous
proposition, it follows that  =  up to a multiplicative constant.
5.5 Proof of Theorem 19
As previously stated, our methods of proving Theorem 19 are motivated by those used in [10, 3].
The main part of the proof comes from [3, Theorem 2.1], which we restate (in the language of
11Note that these assumptions imply those required for Theorem 19.
the desired application) here for convenience. To this end, recalling the notation in (5.24), define
k =  min{n  1 : Tn  D}.
Theorem 22. Suppose that (H1), (H3) and (H4) are in force. Suppose that there exists a
probability measure  on D  V such that
(A1) there exist n0, c1 > 0 such that for each (r, )  D  V ,
P(r,)((RTn0 ,Tn0 )   |n0 < k)  c1();
(A2) there exists a constant c2 > 0 such that for each (r, )  D  V and for every n  0,
P(n < k)  c2P(r,)(n < k).
Then, there exists kc  (0, 1) such that, there exist an eigenmeasure  on D  V and a positive
right eigenfunction  of n (defined in (5.24)) with eigenvalue knc , such that  is a probability
measure and   L+(D  V ), i.e. for all g  L(D  V ),
[n[g]] = k
c [g] and 
n[] = k
c  n  0. (5.35)
Moreover, there exist C,  > 0 such that, for g  L+(D  V ) and n sufficiently large (indepen-
dently of g), knc 1n[g] [g]  Cng. (5.36)
In particular, setting g  1, as n,
knc 1P(n < k) 1  Cn. (5.37)
It is then straightforward to conclude that  and  are the left eigenmeasure and right
eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue k = kcNmax for the semigroup n.
We now proceed to the proof of Theorem 22. We will use the notation Jk to denote the
kth scatter event of the random walk (R,) under P and recall that Tk denotes the scatter
event that corresponds to the kth fission event in the original NBP. The basis of our proof relies
on the fact that, for each k  1, Tk = Jk with positive probability.
A fundamental part of the proof of (A1) and (A2) is the following lemma. We refer the
reader to [10, Lemma 7.3] for its proof.
Lemma 14. Under the assumptions of Theorem 22, for all r  D and   V , we have
(r,)
(J7 < k, RJ7  dz)  C1(zD) dz, (5.38)
for some constant C > 0, and
P(J1 < k, RJ1  dz)  c1(zD) dz, (5.39)
for another constant c > 0, where  is Lebesgue measure on D  V .
Proof of (A1). In order to prove (A1), we use similar arguments to those presented in the proof
of (5.39). To this end, fix r0  D and suppose 0 is uniformly distributed on V . Then, due to
the assumptions (H1) and (H3), the techniques used in [10] to prove (5.39) yield
E(r0,0)
f(RJ1)1(T1=J1)
dz1([r,z]D)f(z). (5.40)
Recall the (deterministic) quantity Dr0,0 , for r0  D, 0  V , defined in Theorem 5.13. Also
note that due to (H3),  is bounded below by a constant (see discussion just before Lemma 7.2
of [10]). Using this, along with the strong Markov property, (H1) and (5.40), we have
(r0,0)
[f(RT2 ,T2)1(T2=J2)]  C1
 Dr0,0
dses
(r0+0s,1)
[f(RJ1 ,J1)1(T1=J1)]
 C2Dr0,0
df(r, ). (5.41)
Finally, we note that due to (H1) and (H3),
(r0,0)
(T2 < k)  P(J1 < k) 
 Dr0,0
dses  C3Dr0,0 . (5.42)
Combining this with (5.41) yields (A1) with  as Lebesgue measure on D  V and n0 = 2.
We now prove (A2). Again, we use a similar method to the one used in [10], however, we
state the proof in full to illustrate where the differences occur.
Proof of A2. Let n  7 and note that Tn J7  Tn T7. This and the strong Markov property
imply
P(r,)(n < k)  E
(r,)
P(RJ7 ,J7 )
(n 7 < k)
 C 
P(z,w) (n 7 < k) dzdw, (5.43)
where we have used Lemma 14 to obtain the final inequality.
Now suppose n  1. Recalling the measure  from (A1), another application of Lemma 14
gives
P(n < k) = E
1(J1<k)P(RJ1 ,J1 )
(n < k)
P(z,w)(n < k)dzdw. (5.44)
Then, for n  8, combining (5.43) and (5.44) yields
P(r,)(n < k) 
P (n 7 < k) . (5.45)
Now recalling n0 from (A1), it follows from (A1) that
P((RTn0 ,Tn0 )  )  c1P(n0 < k)(). (5.46)
Again, due to assumptions (H1) and (H3),
P(n0 < k) 
(r,)
(Tn0 = Jn0 , n0 < k)(dr, d)  K, (5.47)
for some constant K > 0. Then, for n  8, due to (5.46) and (5.47),
P (n 7 + n0 < k) = E
1(n0<k)P(RTn0 ,Tn0 )
(n 7 < k)
 Kc1P (n 7 < k) . (5.48)
Finally, noting that for n  1 we have n 7 + 4n0  n, so that
P(n < k)  P (n 7 + 4n0 < k) ,
and applying (5.48) four times implies
P(n < k)  (Kc1)4P (n 7 < k) . (5.49)
Combining this with (5.45) yields the result.
5.6 Concluding remarks
We complete this paper with a number of remarks that reflect on the main theorem here and
previous work in [5, 10, 9, 4].
5.6.1 -, k- and c-eigenvalue problems
There is a third eigenvalue problem associated with the NTE: find (c, c) such that
T c +
(S + F)c = 0.
The associated mild form of this eigenvalue problem is
St[c](r, ) +
Ss[(S + F)c](r, )ds = c(r, ), (5.50)
where
St[g](r, ) = e
(r+s,)dsg(r + t, )1(t<Dr,).
By considering the semigroup n[g](r, ) = E(r,) [g,Xn], where Xn is the neutron population
at the nth collision (either a scatter or a fission), almost identical proofs to those given in the
previous sections yield the existence of the (c, c), both in the classical sense and the probabilistic
In this case, the eigenvalue c can be interpreted as the ratio between neutron production
(from both scattering and fission) and neutron loss (due to absorption and leakage). Alter-
natively, it can be seen as the number of secondary neutrons per collision, rather than only
collisions due to fission events.
5.6.2 Martingale convergence and strong law of large numbers
In a similar fashion to [10], Theorem 19 implies that
Wn := kn
,Xn
, 
is a non-negative mean one martingale under P(r,) . One could then show that (Wn)n0 con-
verges in L2(P) in the supercritical case, and otherwise has a degenerate limit.
One could also reconstruct the arguments presented in [9] to characterise the growth in
the supercritical regime to obtain a strong law of large numbers:
g,Xn
, 
= g, W,
where W is the limit of the martingale (Wn)n0.
We leave these arguments as an exercise to the reader to avoid unnecessary repetition.
5.6.3 Monte-Carlo considerations
We end this paper with a discussion of the existing Monte Carlo methods for calculating keff
and the associated eigenfunctions, and how we may use the semigroup approach to propose
comparable algorithms, similar in style to those presented in [4].
Due to the interpretation of the eigenvalue keff, most of the existing methods in the
numerical analysis and engineering literature are based on iterative methods. For example,
several algorithms are given in [17] that demonstrate how to calculate keff and . The main
idea is to start with a set of N neutrons, distributed in D  V according to some function
(0) that serves as an initial guess12 at . The system of neutrons then evolves until the first
12In practice, this is usually either the uniform distribution, or the solution to a diffusion approximation of the
eigenvalue problem.
generation of fission events. Letting (1) be the distribution of these first generation neutrons,
the first approximation, (1), of the eigenfunction  is then obtained by normalising13 (1). At
the same time, the eigenvalue keff is approximated by
k(1) =
1,F(1)
1, (T + S)(1)
which corresponds to the ratio of source neutrons for generation 2 to the number of paths
simulated in generation 1. The process is then repeated using (1) as the initial distribution of
neutrons, in order to obtain (2) and k(2), and so on.
However, some of the methods presented in the literature lead to bias and correlations
between the neutrons in successive fission generations. To overcome this problem, the notion
of superhistory powering was introduced in [1]. This idea is based on letting the initial set
of neutrons evolve for some number, L, of generations until the estimates for keff and  are
computed. It is usual in industry to set L = 10.
As we have shown in the previous sections, solving (5.6) is equivalent to look for the leading
eigentriple (k, , ) of the semigroup n. Heuristically, this pertains to finding functions  and
 that describe where neutron production (due to fission events) is most prominent, and a
parameter k that describes the average growth of the number of neutrons in the system. We
may use the asymptotics (5.26) to inform Monte Carlo methods for the calculation of k,  and
. Indeed, we have
k = lim
log n[1](r, ),
where 1 is the constant function with value one. Here, as an expectation, n[1] can be approx-
imated by Monte-Carlo simulation.
In order to calculate the eigenfunction, one can manipulate the following asymptotic.
, g(r, ) = lim
E(r,)
km Xm, g
Varying the test function g, while keeping (r, ) fixed allows us to obtain estimates for , whereas
varying the initial configuration (r, ) and keeping the test function fixed allows us to estimate
Once again, the expectation can be replaced by a Monte-Carlo approximation.
We refer the reader to [4] for a more in-depth discussion of Monte Carlo algorithms based
on the above asymptotics, as well as a complexity analysis of their methods. Although the
algorithms and efficiency results given in [4] are for time-eigenvalues, cf. (5.4), it is straightfor-
ward to see how they may be adapted to fit the current situation (as well as their complexity).
Of course, problems such as burn-in and inefficiencies that were encountered in [4] will still be
present in the stationary case. We hope to carry out more formal work on this in the future.
13This is usually done by either setting (1) = (1)/(1) or by sampling N neutrons according to (1)

Concluding remarks
In this final chapter we have reconstructed the analysis used in previous chapters to prove the
existence of the leading eigenvalue for the stationary problem, in both the classical L2 setting
and the expectation semigroup. In this case, we were able to show that the two settings actually
agree, in the sense that the leading eigenvalues match along with their corresponding leading
eigenfunction.
Since the notion of criticality in this chapter is the one most used in the nuclear industry,
understanding this problem in further detail is extremely important to safety regulations and
optimal reactor design. As hinted in the final discussions, the rest of the analysis carried out
in previous chapters for the time-dependent problem will also apply in this setting, leading to
better intuition of how to simulate the relevant quantities more efficiently.
Chapter 6
Conclusions
In this thesis, we studied criticality problems associated with the neutron transport process.
Firstly, we considered the time-dependent eigenvalue problem however, as seen in the litera-
ture, there are two ways to do this, which use very different techniques. Our first step was to
consolidate these two approaches. To do so, we built a branching process whose linear semi-
group agreed, in an appropriate sense, with the c0-semigroup generated by the neutron transport
integro-differential equation. We then proved the existence of the leading eigenvalue and asso-
ciated left and right eigenfunction, along with Perron-Frbenius-type decompositions, in both
the analytic setting and the probabilistic setting.
Focussing on the stochastic perspective, we analysed the behaviour of the neutron branch-
ing process in the supercritical regime and obtained a spine decomposition and a skeletal de-
composition. We then exploited these decompositions, in order to prove a strong law of large
numbers result.
Finally, we analysed another eigenvalue problem, namely the k-eigenvalue problem. In-
spired by the above analysis, we again, proved the existence of the leading eigenelements using
both spectral theory and probability theory. In this case, we were able to show that the two
solutions were identical.
It is worth noting that the theoretical results proved in this thesis have been used to
build Monte Carlo algorithms and techniques, which we hope will complement those already in
existence in industry.
We finish by discussing some of the open questions that have resulted from this research.
In Chapter 2, we were able to prove the existence of the leading eigenelements, in the classical
sense, for a multi-type branching process. This allowed us to capture the behaviour of the full
range of particles involved in nuclear fission processes. However, in Chapter 3, when addressing
the same problems in the probabilistic setting, our methods were only able to consider the
movement of prompt neutrons. We hope to develop the latter methods in order to consider a
multi-species model from this perspective. Another direction for future work lies in the critical
regime, since this is the regime in which reactors operate in reality. We believe that it is possible
to obtain a Yaglom-type limit in order to characterise the long-term behaviour of the branching
process in the critical regime, conditioned on non-extinction. Finally, as previously mentioned,
we have also considered Monte Carlo algorithms in parallel to this research, however, there is
still much to be done along these lines.
