Abstract
Same- and opposite-sign charge asymmetries are measured in lepton+jets tt events in which a
b-hadron decays semileptonically to a soft muon, using data corresponding to an integrated lu-
minosity of 20.3 fb1 from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV
collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The charge asymme-
tries are based on the charge of the lepton from the top-quark decay and the charge of the soft
muon from the semileptonic decay of a b-hadron and are measured in a fiducial region corre-
sponding to the experimental acceptance. Four CP asymmetries (one mixing and three direct)
are measured and are found to be compatible with zero and consistent with the Standard Model.

Preface
This thesis describes the measurement of charge and CP asymmetries in b-hadron decays using
top quark events collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass
energy of
s = 8 TeV. The analysis is based on the prescription outlined in a paper entitled Top
B Physics at the LHC, published in Physical Review Letter 110, and is the first to exploit the re-
lationship between CP violation (CPV) and the relative charge of two leptons in tt `+jets decays.
The identification of soft muons from semileptonic b-hadron decays is required to perform this
analysis, and is achieved using a method known as soft muon tagging (SMT). The soft muon
tagger relies on the fractional difference in momentum between reconstructed tracks in the inner
detector and the muon spectrometer (extrapolated back to the primary vertex) of the ATLAS de-
tector (known as the momentum imbalance (MI)), to separate true soft muons from heavy-flavour
decays from fakes of other sources. The calibration of the tagger is described herein. Chapter 1
includes a brief introduction to the Large Hadron Collider and top-quark physics. Chapter 2 in-
cludes an overview of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, with specific focus on CPV
which leads into the more detailed discussion of CPV in the B-physics sector in Section 2.6.
Chapter 3 includes an overview of top-quark physics, including details on the primary produc-
tion and decay mechanisms at
s = 8 TeV, as well as updates in the most recent experimental
developments. Chapter 4 gives an outline of the analysis motivation and technique, with def-
initions of the charge and CP asymmetries measured. Chapter 5 describes the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), the ATLAS experiment and each of the subsystems relevant to top-quark mea-
surements. Chapter 6 includes an introduction to the reconstruction of physics objects following
particle collisions and utilising the physics signatures in the aforementioned detector systems, it
also includes some discussion of collisions simulations used to test data against the SM or be-
yond the Standard Model (BSM) theories. Chapter 7 describes the calibration of the soft muon
tagger using a tag and probe analysis. Tag and probe analyses are widely utilised in the ATLAS
collaboration as calibration techniques, Chapter 7 is built upon a calibration code written by a
previous Royal Holloway (RHUL) student, using a 2 track fit as the discriminating variable
instead of momentum imbalance (as defined later). The MC and data samples derived from
selected triggers were already implemented, and my involvement was to update the calibration
to discriminate between real and fake soft muons using MI, to provide code maintenance and
bug-fixing, to retrieve the data/MC scale factors as binned by angular information and trans-
verse momentum and to take the results through the internal ATLAS approval procedure. All
results and plots presented are updated versions of those previously derived for the 2 calibra-
tion. Chapter 8 describes the event selection utilised for the charge and CP asymmetry analysis,
it is based upon a standard selection used to identify tt events as prescribed by the ATLAS top
quark group. Alterations to this selection are derived following joint studies between myself and
a colleague at Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL). A more detailed description of the
W+jets data-driven estimation is provided as I was involved in the early implementation of this
background estimation, however the final code used to complete the estimation and retrieve the
relevant scale factors is not my own. Chapter 9 includes descriptions of the sources of experi-
mental and modelling uncertainties considered to be relevant to the charge and CP asymmetry
analysis. Chapter 10 describes the implementation and optimisation of a Kinematic Likelihood
Fitter (KLFitter) which contributes information paramount to the measurement. I was in charge
of the implementation and optimisation of the KLFitter. Chapter 11 describes the unfolding
procedure used to correct the reconstructed charge asymmetries to the particle level in a fiducial
volume, I was in charge of the implementation and optimisation of the unfolding. Chapter 12
presents the results of the culmination of work by the joint RHUL-QMUL analysis team, and
my contribution of an interpretation of the measured charge and CP asymmetries. Chapter 13
provides a summary of the analysis and the individual studies performed in the prior chapters, as
well as my contribution of quantified estimations of future performance for a repeat of the anal-
ysis with more statistics and utilising my ideas for reductions in the systematic uncertainties.
Much work in this thesis is similar in tone to my contributions to the published paper:

Introduction
This thesis describes an analysis based on data from proton-proton collisions at the ATLAS ex-
periment [1] general purpose detector, based on the Large Hadronic Collider (LHC) [2] ring
at the European Centre Nuclear Research (CERN) [3] in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a
high energy circular particle accelerator designed to collide protons in the centre of four detec-
tor points on the ring, for study and analysis. High energy physics analyses probe parameters
of the Standard Model (SM) [4] of particle physics, to search for discrepancies in experimen-
tal observations from our present understanding of the universe. Analyses may also constrain
measurements of known processes with ever-increasing precision, and search for signals of new
processes, to find or constrain models of new physics.
Studies of top-quark physics are considered to be fertile ground in the search for new physics.
The top quark is the most massive of all known fundamental particles and may couple to as of yet
undiscovered higher energy particles and processes. The top quark is also unable to hadronise,
and its decay products provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of a bare quark.
Properties on the top quark, such as its mass, are crucial parameters which can provide stringent
tests of the SM.
Top quarks are produced in large numbers at the LHC as the centre-of-mass energy of col-
lisions is enough to produce on-shell top quarks. The most common mechanism at the LHC
is the production of top-quark pairs from gluon splitting, g tt, which then each decay with
an almost 100% branching ratio to a W -boson and a b-quark. The final state searched for in
physics analyses depends on the subsequent decay of the W -boson, into a lepton and neutrino
pair, or into two quarks which form hadrons. For all final states the b-quark will also hadro-
Introduction
nise, leading to a collimated chain of decays forming a detectable signal called a jet. Jets which
originate from b-quarks specifically are known as b-jets and their identification is crucial to the
measurements of many processes. Algorithms used to identify b-jets are known as b-taggers. A
particular technique, known as soft muon tagging (SMT) relies on the observations of a muon
aligned with the b-jet, which originates from a 21% branching ratio of b  process. The SMT
tagger is described in detail in Section 7, where it is calibrated on J/  decays.
In this thesis, the SMT tagger is utilised to identify soft muons in b+jets from tt decays in
the lepton+jets channel. In this channel, the W -boson from one top-quark decays to a lepton and
a neutrino, and the W -boson from the other top quark produces a pair of jets. In this event topol-
ogy, the measurement of the charged lepton from the W -boson decay provides information about
the charge of the b-quark from the same top-quark decay. This information can be combined with
the charge of a soft muon produced in the subsequent decay of the b-hadron to build asymmetries
sensitive to charge-parity (CP) violating effects in the heavy-flavour sector. CP violation implies
that physical laws for matter and antimatter are different, and understanding the source and mag-
nitude of this difference may be key to understanding the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry
in the universe [5]. Existing measurements in the heavy-flavour sectors [616] continue to be
insufficient to explain the observed cosmological asymmetry, and precision measurements of
potential CP violating processes are required to search for discrepancies from the SM.

The Standard Model of particles
physics
The Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) [4] is the culmination of knowledge regarding the
fundamental constituents of our universe and its interactions. Its development has proceeded
through both theoretical and experimental exploration and is considered to describe all known
particles and three of the discovered fundamental forces. The SM has stood up to rigorous
examination and is able to make precise predictions about our universe.The SM however is
however incomplete, and this drives the field of particle physics research to continue to search for
answers. In the context of this thesis, the most notable deficiency in the SM is the prediction for
the relative yields of matter and antimatter in our universe (see Section 2.5.2). A nave study of
the Big Bang would suggest that matter and antimatter should have been produced and destroyed
in equal numbers, which would continue to be the case in the modern universe. However, an
asymmetry of the order 109 is actually observed [5]. Charge-parity (CP) violating processes
(along with other effects) can go some way towards an explanation, but current measurements of
CP violation known to be allowed within the SM are insufficient by several orders of magnitude
to produce the required effect, this is discussed further in Section 2.6.6. Experiments continue
make precise measurements of CP violating decays to find discrepancies which might lead help
develop new theories to go beyond the standard model (BSM). The work in this chapter is based
on the documentation in [4], [17] and [18].
2.1 Elementary particles The Standard Model of particles physics
2.1 Elementary particles
The SM describes the existence of 12 spin-half particles (plus their antiparticles) and their inter-
actions via unitary-spin particles. These particles are summarised in Figure 2.1 [19] below. Each
particle is uniquely defined by its properties and quantum numbers, such as its mass m, charge q
and spin S. Spin-half particles (e.g. S = 12 ,
2 , ...) are called fermions, and 12 exist within the cur-
rent framework. The first six are leptons, three of which carry unitary electric charge (electron
e, muon  and tau ), and 3 of which carry zero electric charge (electron-neutrino e, muon-
neutrino , tau-neutrino ). These 6 leptons are separated into doublets by the increasing mass
of those with unitary charge, they therefore exist as three generations of leptons. The second
6 fermions are known as quarks. Quarks are analogously separated by mass into three gener-
ations. The first generation doublet consists of the up (u) and down (d) quarks, the second of
the charm (c) and strange (s) quarks, and the third of the heaviest top (t) and bottom (b) quarks.
In each generation, the quarks (in order) have charge of Qu,c,t = +
3 and Qd,s,b = 
3 , and are
hitherto known as up-type and down-type quarks respectively. The quark names are referred
to as flavours and as such their study is often called the study of flavour physics (as opposed to
lepton flavours, e, and ). All fermions above are described as they exist in matter. Antimatter
partners for each exist for which the electric charge, colour and weak hypercharge are reversed.
This makes for a total of 24 fundamental fermions described by the SM.
2.2 Fundamental forces
The fermions described above are only known to interaction via three fundamental forces; the
electromagnetic, weak (or unified electroweak, see Section 2.7), and strong, with the latter most
reserved to interactions in the quark sector only. In the SM each of these forces is described as
being carried (or mediated by) unitary spin particles known as bosons, which are also shown in
Figure 2.1. Missing from this figure is the theoretical boson responsible for mediation of the
gravitational force, the true mechanism for which has yet to be discovered and is not incorpo-
rated in the SM. Electromagnetic interactions proceed via the exchange of a massless photon
, described in Section 2.3. Strong interactions proceed via the exchange of massless gluons
g, described in Section 2.4. Most relevant for this thesis, the weak interaction proceeds by a
neutral massive boson Z, and two charged massive bosons W, described in Section 2.5. Just

as in the case of the fermions, bosons also have antiparticle forms. The W+ antiparticle is the
W, the other bosons are their own antiparticles. The relative strengths of the forces are shown
in Table 2.1.

2.3 Quantum electrodynamics The Standard Model of particles physics
2.3 Quantum electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) describes the electromagnetic force mediated by the  boson.
This force acts upon all charged fermions, via the vertex of Figure 2.2 [19]. Conservation of
electric charge is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and the electromagnetic force interacts
with a coupling strength proportional to the electronic charge gQED = qe, where q is the electric
charge of the interacting particle in units of e.
Figure 2.2: The primary vertex for QED showing the interaction between a photon and two fermions.
Rotation of this vertex and replacement of the generic fermions f with appropriate particles describes all
possible QED processes.
2.4 Quantum chromodynamics
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the strong force mediated by the gluon, with cou-
pling strength gs. This force acts upon all particles which carry a quantum colour, namely those
in the quark sector. Colour is conserved at all strong interaction vertices and is represented by
three orthogonal states:
red(r) =
 , green(g) =
 , blue(b) =
 . (2.1)
Quarks are defined to carry colours (r, g, b) and anti-quarks carry anti-colours
r, g, b
Gluons also carry colour and are therefore capable of self-interaction. Through the conservation
of colour at gluon-quark vertices, it is necessary for each gluon to carry a combination of colour
and anti-colour, and therefore the gluon in SU(3) exists in a colour octet, with assignments:

(rrgg) and

(2.2)
Figure 2.3: The primary vertices for QCD showing the interaction between a gluon and two quarks, as
well as the three- and four-gluon self-interaction vertices.
Naively nine gluons would be expected from simple combinations of colour-anti-colour
pairs, however this would lead to a colourless gluon which could not interact strongly. The
vertices for the strong interaction are shown in Figure 2.3 [19]. The strong interaction is respon-
sible for the binding of quarks into heavier particles known as hadrons, which are categorised as
mesons (qq states) and baryons (three-quark states). More recently, experimental evidence also
exists for tetraquarks (four-quark states) and pentaquarks (five-quark states) [20, 21]. Hadrons
are colourless objects held together by strong interactions, which must notably be stronger than
QED by several orders of magnitude to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between sim-
ilarly charged quarks. Mesons consist of a quark q and an anti-quark q as a single states qq,
whilst baryons can be any combination of three quarks so long as the final state remains colour-
less. Protons and neutrons fall into the category of some of the most well known baryons,
consisting of uud and udd quark combinations respectively. Prominent examples of mesons
produced at hadron colliders include the neutral pions 0
uu/dd
, kaons K0
ds/sd
and B-
mesons B0
db/bd
, as well as their charged alternatives.
2.5 Weak interactions
The weak interaction is mediated by three massive bosons, the neutral Z and the charged W,
with coupling strength gZ and gW respectively. The weak force is responsible most famously
for nuclear -decay (n pee), and has considerably different behaviour in the SM compared
with QED and QCD, which will be discussed in detail in this chapter. It is for example the only
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
known source of processes in the SM which violate the conservation of parity.
The Z boson is similar in concept to a massive , with the exception that it can couple to
neutral fermions such as neutrinos. This allows for processes such as elastic e scattering. The
other boson for the weak interaction is the W -boson. The W has unit charge and therefore must
couple to fermions which are separated in charge also by one unit. This provides a mechanism
for interactions between leptons and their respective neutrinos, between quarks with charges
q =13 and q =
3 respectively, between Z and W bosons themselves, and also between the 
and the W . The first three vertices are shown in Figure 2.4 [19].
Figure 2.4: The primary vertices for the weak interaction. (a) Z boson coupling to fermions, (b) W boson
coupling with a lepton and a neutrino and (c) W coupling with two differently-charged quarks.
Experimental data for weak interactions with leptons is consistent with the theory of lepton
universality, which states that after accounting for phase-space differences according to the lep-
ton mass, the strength of the weak interaction is identical for all lepton flavours. The vertex of
eeW has identical form factors to W . The qW vertices are described as flavour-changing cur-
rents, as they have the potential to connect (or convert between) up-type and down-type quarks.
Historically it was this feature which led to a long string of discoveries in flavour physics, in-
cluding the prediction of the b,c and t quarks and the phenomena of neutral-meson mixing.
In order to explore the weak interactions of quarks, it is initially useful to reduce to a two-
generation system. The concept of lepton-quark symmetry (LQS) is extremely important and
drives the SM formulation which follows. LQS draws a symmetry between the lepton doublets
and the quark doublets in the weak interaction, via the replacements e  u, e  d,  
c,  s, with a weak coupling constant in all cases gud = gcs = gW :
 (2.3)
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
LQS leads to the vertices in Figure 2.5 [4]. The downfall of the basic theory of LQS came
from the observation of generation-crossing interactions involving for example usW vertices,
such as kaon decay. It was these observations which led (even before the discovery of the charm
quark) to Cabibbos hypothesis of quark mixing, whereby inter-generation interactions of the
quark families would be permitted via a mixing angle C. Otherwise forbidden vertices could
then be permitted with coupling strengths modified by this angle:
gud = gcs = gW cosC (2.4)
gus =gcd = gW sinC (2.5)
Rather than interacting as mass eigenstates, the d and s are theorised to propagate instead as
mass eigenstates and interact as weak eigenstates
, where:
= d cosC + ssinC, (2.6)
=d sinC + scosC (2.7)
or in matrix form:
 d 
 cosC sinC
sinC cosC
 (2.8)
The Cabibbo angle is a free parameter of the SM which must be measured experimentally,
and was determined from the measurement of various hadronic decays to be approximately
C = 13.
Extension to a third generation of quarks is less trivial, and described in Section 2.5.1.
2.5.1 The CKM matrix
In order to account for quark mixing in three generations, the formulation of Equation 2.8 must
be extended into what has become known as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix:

where all required coupling constants then take the form gi j = gWVi j, and where the entries
to the CKM matrix must be determined from experiment. The probability for quark interactions
is proportional to |Vi j|2, and the near-diagonality of Equation 2.10 shows reduced likelihood for
inter-generation vertices. These are referred to as being suppressed vertices.

2.5.2 Charge and parity operators
This section explores the phenomena of charge and parity violation in the weak interactions as
part of the SM.
Charge operator
Application of a charge operator C to a quantum state takes the effect of swapping all particles
q for antiparticles q, i.e. their charge conjugates. Eigenstates of the charge conjugation operator
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
are those for which the system remains unchanged. QED and QCD interactions are invariant
under charge conjugation, however the weak interaction has the potential to violate this symme-
try. Consider a particle wavefunction  for a neutral particle  under charge conjugation in the
following notation:
C |=C | (2.11)
Charged particles have well defined anti-particles, however neutral particles with nonzero
magnetic moments such as the neutron must be carefully considered. The phase factor C eigen-
value can be determined using the conservation of charge if the operator is applied twice, C2
Therefore the eigenvalue must be:
C =1 (2.12)
which is referred to as a particles intrinsic C-parity. C-parities may be determined as above
through the principle of charge conservation.
Two-particle states with particle-antiparticle pairs (a, a) can also form eigenstates of the C
operator.
C |a1, a2= |a1,a2=|a1, a2 (2.13)
With proper treatment, the orbital angular momentum (L) of the pair of particles must be
considered during charge conjugation, as interchanging particle with antiparticle will reverse
their relative positions, and this is true for hadrons and fermions alike. Furthermore, when
accounting for the interchanging of particles in the spin (S) wave functions, the eigenvalues for
a charge conjugated two-particle state are:
C |aa;J,L,S= (1)L+S |aa;J,L,S (2.14)
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
Parity operator
Analogous to the concept of charge conjugation which swaps particles and their antiparticles,
the Parity operator P reverse all space-like dimensions of a system:
ri r
i =ri (2.15)
Parity is conserved by QED and QCD, but is maximally violated by the weak interaction,
discussed in Section 2.5.3.
Consider a single particle wavefunction (r, t), the parity operator has the effect:
P(r, t) = Pa(r, t) (2.16)
P2(r, t) = P2a (r, t) (2.17)
Pa =1 (2.18)
For particles at rest, the eigenvalue Pa is known as the intrinsic parity, and again must be
equal to 1 in order to return a system to its nominal state after two successive parity opera-
tions. Electron scattering experiments are able to determine the product Pe+Pe =1, however
in electromagnetic interactions electrons are never produced or destroyed by themselves, this
means that cancellations between parity factors always occur and so the unique parity Pe can-
not be determined. A convention is taken to define all fermion parities as positive unity, and all
antifermion parities as negative unity:
Pf = Pq = 1 (2.19)
Pf = Pq =1 (2.20)
Moving to two-particle states, and taking into account orbital angular momentum again
(which has direction and is affected by parity conjugation), the intrinsic parity of a meson M = ab
is then:
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
ab= PaPb (1)L ab= PM ab (2.21)
PM = PaPb (1)
= (1)L+1 (2.22)
2.5.3 CP violation and neutral meson-mixing
CP violation in the SM comes about as a result of the structure of the weak interaction, which
is outside the scope of this thesis. In short however, five forms of interaction are possible within
the SM to represent the bosons whilst maintaining Lorentz-invariance, these are scalar, pseu-
doscalar, vector, axial vector and tensor, named to reflect their individual ranks and intrinsic
parities. To explain parity violation in particular, the weak interaction propagates as a linear
combination of the vector and axial vector type currents, to form the so called V A structure.
As the vector and axial vector currents are of the same rank but have opposing intrinsic parities,
application of P on weak interactions is able to violate parity conservation. The violation of com-
bined CP invariance was first discovered in the decays of neutral kaons. Neutral mesons such
as the K0 and B0 have the freedom to mix with their antiparticles due to the weak interactions
permitted by the CKM matrix. This means that as a neutral meson propagates, it will oscillate
between its particle and antiparticle state via Feynman diagrams such as that in Figure 2.6 [4].
Figure 2.6: Neutral meson mixing in the SM via the weak interaction. (a) converts between the neutral
K0 and K0 states, (b) converts between the neutral B0d and B
d states.
Neutral kaon mixing
Historically, neutral meson mixing was first observed in the kaon system. As this particle-
antiparticle oscillation is possible, it means that the kaon must be considered to propagate as CP
eigenstates in the form of a superposition of its mass eigenstates:
2.5 Weak interactions The Standard Model of particles physics
K0 + K0
, (2.23)
K0 K0
. (2.24)
Since experimentally two kaons are observed with separate lifetimes, the K-short (KS) and
the K-long (KL), and as kaons decay almost exclusively to either two- or three-pion states,
comparing the intrinsic charge-parities arguments below initially led to the belief that K1 = KS
and K2 = KL, as the two-pion states and the K1 stay have positive instrinsic CP and the three-
ption states and the K2 have negative instrinsic parity.
CP |K1=+ |K1 and CP |K2=|K2 (2.25)
00=+ 00 and CP +=+ + (2.26)
000= 000 and CP +0= +0 (2.27)
Assuming CP invariance the KS should be responsible for the two-pion final states (and
forbidden from producing three-pions) and the KL should be responsible for the three-pion final
states (and forbidden from producing two-pions). However, an experiment to study the decays
of a pure KL beam found two-pion contributions, which violate the CP symmetry, albeit by a
very small amount [22]. This leads to the reformulation of the kaon system to instead describe
the KS,L as linear combinations of K1,2, with a small complex parameter  introduced to allow
for CP violating effects:
|KS=
1+ ||2
(|K1+  |K2) , (2.28)
|KL=
1+ ||2
(|K2+  |K1) . (2.29)
CP violation is then incorporated in two ways, in the context of the pure KL beam experi-
ment:

1. Mixing; The KL interacts via its CP-forbidden component K1 which then decays in a CP-
conserving manner.

A A X
2. Direct; The KL interacts via its CP-conserving component K2 which then decays in a
CP-violating manner.
(A X) 6=

The relative strength of the direct CP violation may be parameterised by 
=(K2 )/(K2 ),
which has been measured at NA48, CERN [23] to be
= (1.472.2)103 . (2.30)
As neutral kaons are able to mix the time evolution of a neutral kaon state is
|K (t)= a(t)
K0+b(t) K0 , (2.31)
where a(t) and b(t) are the amplitudes and phases of the K0 and K0 components. These give
the coupled time evolution equations and effective Hamiltonion

The solutions for a(t) and b(t) are typically found by solving the eigenvalue equation of the

Neutral B mixing
Analogous to neutral kaon mixing, CP violation is also been observed in the oscillations for
heavy neutral mesons such as the B0 and D0, which are most relevant to this thesis. The B-
mesons are categorised by the subsequent partner quark to the b, which affects the CKM matrix
elements involved in the oscillation diagrams. Neutral B mesons with a down-component are
labelled B0d
, and with a strange-component are labelled B0s (bs). For the remainder of this
section, the label B0 shall be used to refer to both inclusively. Instead of the short- and long-lived
particles of the kaon system, the B-system is described by a light- and heavy-mesons, B0L and B
respectively, which have comparable lifetimes and a very small difference in mass md which
provides a useful variable in the determination of factors in the CKM matrix.
Like the kaon system, the B-meson decays are sensitive to a third type of CP violation due
to interference between decays which share a common final state, where one B-decay requires
2.6 B-physics and CP violation with time-integrated analyses The Standard Model of particles physics
mixing and the other does not, B0 X vs. B0 B0 X .
Experimentally, CP violation in B-mesons is accessible by construction of CP-sensitive
asymmetries. Using the notation above a CP violation sensitive asymmetry can be defined for
direct B X decays:
Abdir =
B0 X
B0 X
P(B0 X)+P(B0 X)
(2.40)
where P
B0 X
denotes the inclusive probability of a B0 meson decaying to a final state
X , and is most commonly assessed via the decay width 
B0 X
. It is with this sort of
asymmetry that this thesis is concerned.
2.6 B-physics and CP violation with time-integrated analyses
In the B-meson system the mass and flavour eigenstates are distinct, and are not equivalent
to CP eigenstates (although the CP and mass eigenstates are nearly identical in the neutral B-
meson system). The neutral flavour eigenstates, which are most useful for describing particle
production and decay are B0d = bd and B
d = db (with an equivalent B
s definition). Each particle
propagates as a mass eigenstate (either a heavy BH or light BL) governed by a time-dependent
Schrodinger equation:
|BL= p
B0+q B0 , |BH= p B0q B0 , (2.41)
= (M i
) p
 . (2.42)
where p and q are complex coefficients, and BH and BL are seen to have a mass difference
mB and width difference  and where it is expected that  mB. During the lifetime
of a neutral B-meson, the particle wavefunction oscillates between the B0 and B0, via the box
diagram in Figure 2.6. The complex coefficients have phases which are unique to the weak
sector in the SM, appearing only in the CKM matrix. These are referred to as weak phases, and
open the possibility for CP violation. Other phases, which do not violate CP, are also present
and these are referred to as strong phases. In each case, only phase differences between multiple
terms within a decay amplitude are important, not the phase of any individual term itself as
2.6 B-physics and CP violation with time-integrated analyses The Standard Model of particles physics
this is convention-dependent. For a particle decay amplitude (such as A f for B0 f , or its CP
conjugate) it is possible to write down three parts; the magnitude Ai, the weak phase eii and the
strong phase eii , such that for multiple contributing terms
A f = 
i(i+i), (2.43)
A f = e
2i( fB)
i(ii), (2.44)
where B and  f are arbitrary phases related to the flavour content of the initial- and final-states.
2.6.1 CP violation in decays
A meaningful quantity for the study of direct CP violation in decays is the ratio of the CP
conjugate amplitudes
 A fA f
=
i Aie
i(ii)
i Aiei(i+i)
 , (2.45)
which exhibit CP violation if
 A fA f
 6= 1. This can only occur if multiple contributing terms
to the amplitudes have both different weak and different strong phases ( = (i j) 6= 0 ,
 = (i j) 6= 0), since
|A|2
A2 =2
AiA j sinsin. (2.46)
A CP asymmetry may then be defined as the magnitude of this difference in amplitudes
a f =
A/A2
A/A2 =
|A|2
A2
|A|2 +
A2 . (2.47)
As the width of a process is proportional to the square of its amplitude, experiments can detect
direct CP violating effects by studying asymmetries of differences in rates, such as
a f =
(B+ f )
B f
(B+ f )+
B f
) . (2.48)
The direct CP asymmetries measured in this analysis are of this format.
2.6 B-physics and CP violation with time-integrated analyses The Standard Model of particles physics
2.6.2 CP violation in mixing
The meaningful quantity for the study of CP violation in mixing is the ratio of the complex
coefficients in the propagation of the mass eigenstates. CP violation in mixing occurs if
qp
 6= 1.
A relevant asymmetry may be defined (using semileptonic decays as an example) as
asl =
1|q/p|4
1+ |q/p|4
|p|4|q|4
|p|4 + |q|4
, (2.49)
which leads to
asl =
B0phys (t) `
B0phys (t) `
B0phys (t) `+X
B0phys (t) `X
) , (2.50)
following from the time evolution of an initial pure B0phys or B
phys. The mixing CP asymmetries
measured in the this analysis are of this format. The asymmetry formula may be re-arranged to
measure |q/p|
|q/p|=
1asl
1+asl
. (2.51)
However the approximation that asl = Im
does not allow access to 12 or M12 without
input of a separate measurements.
2.6.3 CP violation in the interference between decays with and without mixing
A meaningful quantity to measure CP violation in the interference between decays with and
without mixing is a combination of the important variables for mixing and decay themselves
 f =
. (2.52)
In this case, the relevant asymmetries have to be measured in a time-dependent way and provide
sensitivity to the mass difference mB
2.6 B-physics and CP violation with time-integrated analyses The Standard Model of particles physics
a f =
B0phys (t) f
B0phys (t) f
B0phys (t) f
B0phys (t) f
) , (2.53)
a f =
 f 2)cosmbt2Im( f )sinmBt
 f 2 . (2.54)
However as this analyis is time-integrated it is not sensitive to these effects. Time-dependent
analyses are employed to probe additional variables of interest such as mB, and provide sen-
sitivty to parameters of the CKM matrix. It is not the goal of this analysis to measure those
parameters, but rather to probe for the presence of new physics in an inclusive B-meson decay
system.
2.6.4 Relation to the CKM matrix
Semileptonic decays of B-mesons involve either the b u process, sensitive to Vub, or b
c which is sensitive to Vcb, although neither may be inferred seperately when measuring inclu-
sive decays [24]. Through these parameters, measurements of direct CP asymmetries in B-meson
decays can provide inputs to probe angles of the CKM matrix such as  = arg
VudV ub
VcdV cb
. The
green ring in Figure 2.7 requires the input of |Vub| (it is labelled thus because it is the least accu-
rately measured of the three elements required
2 +2 = |Vub/VusVcb|). Following the vertices
in Figure 2.6, neutral B-meson mixing is sensitive to VtbV td and VtbV
ts, these are used determine
the yellow and orange rings in Figure 2.7 [25] which further constrain the CKM angles.
2.6.5 New Physics
There are numerous models describing BSM physics which could contribute to measurements
of CP violation in mixing and direct decays. New physics may result in asymmetries which are
expected to be very small in SM model instead being found to be much larger than predicted.
These changes would derive from new interactions in tree-level B-decays or from the presence
of new phases in virtual contributions to loop-processes such as neutral B-meson mixing. For
example CP violation in a minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) standard model (MSSM) may affect
Bs meson mixing [26, 27]. Other possibilites include:

2.6.6 CP violation in the SM
CP violation as described by the SM is fundamental to our understanding of the universe, and
believed to be the key to the mystery of big bang baryogenesis, the process due to which it is
hypothesised that we live in a matter-dominated universe.
Big bang baryogenesis
It is considered that in the early universe shortly after the big bang there would have been equal
numbers of baryons (nB) and antibaryons (nB). In thermal equilibrium (using protons as an
example) with the thermal energy kBT far greater than the masses of the hadrons, the reversible
process for photon production and combination would have occurred
p+ p  + . (2.55)
On expansion the universe cooled and eventually the production of baryons would have ceased
and the low-density of the baryon pairs would have also made the forward reaction unlikely. It
is expected at that point that the (nB) and (nB) would be equal and follow the relation
nB = nB  10
18n. (2.56)
However, the observations of the numbers of baryons and antibaryons in our universe suggest
that this relation is far from true, with a measured baryonic asymmetry of the order
nBnB
 109, (2.57)
a nave estimate is clearly insufficient. In 1967, Sakharov formulated three conditions which
must be met in order to produce any baryonic asymmetry in the early universe:
1. Baryon number violating interactions; Processes must exist which allow for the produc-
tion or destruction of baryons and antibaryons in unequal numbers.
2. CP violation; A baryon number violating process is not enough to produce an asymmetry
if the CP conjugate generates the exact opposite process, as this would re-balance the total
number of baryons and antibaryons present.
2.7 The Higgs Mechanism and electroweak unification The Standard Model of particles physics
3. Departure from thermal equilibrium; In thermal equilibrium, even with the first two con-
ditions satisfied every process would occur at an equal rate to its inverse process and again
the baryon numbers would be balanced.
CP violation then opens the possibility to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the uni-
verse. However to date all experimental observations of CP violation in the quark sector have
been insufficient to explain the magnitude observed in Equation 2.57. It is this question which
drives precision measurements of CP violation in the SM, particularly in the B sector which is
expected to yield the largest effect. At present, it is believed that a BSM source of CP violation
must be responsible to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and therefore results which are
in tension with the SM predictions could be fertile ground for the discovery of new physics (NP).
If a CP-violating BSM source couples to the B sector, it will show up in precision measurements.
2.7 The Higgs Mechanism and electroweak unification
The Higgs mechanism is responsible for allowing fermions and bosons in the SM to have non-
zero mass (prior to this theory, inserting mass terms by-hand would break gauge-symmetries,
see below). Theories of electroweak unification prescribe that the observed fundamental elec-
tromagnetic and weak forces represent low-energy manifestations of a single force. The clearest
difference in their manifestation is the difference in the masses of the gauge bosons, with the
massless  compared to the heavy W,Z bosons. Electroweak symmetry breaking, which makes
use of the Higgs mechanism, provides a solution to this disparity.
2.7.1 Gauge invariance
Gauge theories represent fundamental symmetries in the SM in the form of local and global
phase transformations, under which the Lagrangian is required to be invariant. As an example,
the basic free-particle Lagrangian for a free Dirac field
L = im, (2.58)
transforms with a global gauge invariance
  = ei, (2.59)
2.7 The Higgs Mechanism and electroweak unification The Standard Model of particles physics
where  is an arbitrary non-complex phase, which allows each term  to exactly equal .
This Lagrangian however is not invariant under a local gauge transformation where the phase
has some space-time dependence, (x). Modifying the basic Lagrangian with substitutions
including a new field A
 D =  + iqA, (2.60)
leads to a new Lagrangian:
L = (im)qA, (2.61)
which is both globally and locally gauge-invariant, if A transforms as A A
 = A. The
A can be identified as the photon.
In the Standard Model, the local gauge invariance of the Lagrangian is broken by terms corre-
sponding to particle masses. A massive photon for example would introduce the term
which does not cancel under the gauge transformations. In this case the gauge symmetries may
only be satisfied for particles which are massless. This is accurate for the photon and gluon,
however it is in direct conflict with experimental results showing massive W and Z-bosons.
2.7.2 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
The Higgs mechanism attests the existence of a complex scalar field able to provide the fermions
and weak interaction bosons with mass terms without affecting the massless photon and gluon.
The scalar field is constructed to have a so-called sombrero-style potential, with degenerate
vacuum energy states as shown in Figure 2.8 [4], and a vacuum expectation energy . This
figure represents the potential V () for a complex scalar field  which can be written in terms
of two real fields 1 and 2.
With similar substitutions to the above, a complex scalar field doublet (the Higgs field,  =
 a + ib
c + id
) can be designed to exhibit gauge-invariance. The derivation is beyond the
scope of this thesis, however is it important to note that this Higgs field leads to the generation
of an additional scalar particle (the Higgs boson). A phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry
breaking occurs when a choice of the physical vacuum state is made from the infinite degeneracy.
The result is that the manipulation of the doublet is seen to permit a massless photon and 3

massive weak bosons as different manifestations of the same interaction. The masses of the
bosons are directly related to the vacuum expectation energy, for example for the W
gW  . (2.62)
The  and Z can then be shown to be eigenvectors of a single process, but for which only the Z
obtains a mass via the Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, it is derived that the coupling strength
of fermions with the Higgs field run as a function of their attained mass, such that the heaviest
observed particles will feel the largest coupling with the Higgs field. As the most massive of all
known fermions, the top quark is an obvious candidate for additional study of the Higgs.
2.7.3 Top quark
The top quark is described in further detail in Section 3, the top-quark mass is of particular
importance in both the search for new physics and, prior to its discovery, the search for and
understanding of the Higgs boson. As mentioned previously, the coupling with the Higgs boson
uniquely scales as a function of the mass of the particles with which it is interacting, gH (mi).
This means that the Higgs boson couples most strongly to the top quark and the W boson.
2.7 The Higgs Mechanism and electroweak unification The Standard Model of particles physics
Important production (and decay) mechanisms for the Higgs boson involve radiative corrections
from top loops and W loops (such as in Figure 2.9 [31]), this means that predictions for the Higgs
boson mass were made using precision measurements of the top and W masses. These are now
comparable with the measurement of the Higgs mass itself and provide a rigorous consistency
check for the SM, as in Figure 2.10 [32]. More detailed theory, experimental techniques and
results for measurements of the top-quark properties are described further in Section 3.

Top-quark physics
The top quark is by far the most massive of all known fundamental particles, with mt  173 GeV.
Discovered at Fermilab in 1995 [33], it was originally postulated to exist alongside the lighter
b-quark as a third quark generation to solve the problem of CP violation observations in kaon
decays [22]. Although the b-quark was discovered in 1977 [34], it took 23 years for particle
accelerators to reach the centre-of-mass energy required to detect top quarks via on-shell pro-
duction. The mass window prior to its discovery had already been constrained to approximately
mt = 17030 GeV at the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) [35] through measurements of
the cross-section 
e+e bb
in which a virtual top quark appears in an intermediate loop,
with two W -bosons.
Top-quark studies at high-energy colliders have a high potential for sensitivity to NP. The
large mass implies it may be the most likely particle to couple to NP at the TeV level and is
crucial to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. It may also appear as a background
to potential searches for BSM physics.
The top quark also has an extremely short lifetime t due to its large mass, which means
that unlike other quarks it cannot hadronise as there is not sufficient time for a strong interaction
to take place. This is shown in Equation 3.2, where GF is the usual Fermi constant and the
near-unity branching ratio of t Wb, provided by the CKM element |Vtb|2, is used to justify
the approximation of the partial decay rate (tWb) as equivalent to the total decay rate t .
Preservation of properties such as spin through the weak interaction provide the opportunity for
the study of the bare top quark through analysis of its decay products.

Precision studies of top-quark properties form a stringent test of the SM, and at the ATLAS
experiment require the entire detector to be utilised, as the most common decay channels for the
top quark include charged leptons (detected using the inner detector, electromagnetic calorimeter
and muon spectrometer), jets (detected using the inner detector, electromagnetic calorimeter
and hadronic calorimeter) and missing energy (reconstructed via momentum conservation using
many detector parts, see Section 6.2.6).
3.1 Top-quark production
The primary production mechanism for top quarks at the LHC is in tt production through gluon
fusion, as in Figure 3.1a [36]. This is in contrast to the primary production mechanism at the
Tevatron which was quark-antiquark annihilation interactions, as in Figure 3.1b [36]. The differ-
ence stems from the centre-of-mass energy at which the collisions occur and the different initial
colliding hadrons (pp at the LHC and pp at the Tevatron). For the Tevatron at
s = 1.96 TeV
the valence quarks in the pp collisions carried the largest momentum fractions xi of all of the
partons. At LHC energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV the gluon interactions dominate. At the Teva-
tron the quark to gluon production mechanism ratios were about 9:1, at the LHC the ratios are
1:4 and 1:9 at 8 TeV and 13 TeV respectively [37]. Figure 3.2 [38] shows the predicted parton
interactions at next-to-leading order (NLO) as a function of xi. The theoretical cross-section
at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) for top-quark pair production at the LHC at 8 TeV is
tt = 252.011.7+6.48.6pb [39].
In addition to tt pairs it is also possible to produce single top quarks through several mech-
anisms: qq
 bt via a virtual W -boson Wtb vertex (s-channel), bg tW via a virtual b or t
(Wt-channel), and qb q
t or qb q
t also via a virtual W -boson (t-channel). These are shown
in Figure 3.3a- 3.3d [36], with predicted cross-sections at 8 TeV [40]:

production, as they proceed via the weak force rather than the strong force. The top-quark cross-
sections for the t- and s-channels are larger than the anti-top-quark cross-sections due to available
valence quarks in proton-proton collisions. The proton valence quarks are able to produce more
W+-bosons than W-bosons in each case, resulting in more W+ tb vertices than the charge
conjugate.

3.2 Top quark decay modes
Due to the near-unity value of the Vtb coupling constant the branching ratio for top-quark decays
to Wb is almost 100%. Top-quark pairs produced at the LHC then follow down the major decay
channels detailed in Figure 3.4 [36].
The dominant decay channels (not including s), dependent on the branching ratios of the
W -boson decays (Table 3.1 [41]), are:
 `+jets : ttWb Wb b` bqq
 Dilepton : ttWb Wb b` b` 30%
 Fully hadronic : ttWb Wb bqq
 45%

These three categories of top-quark pair decay channel are often studied separately, as the
final states are significantly different. As such they have different analytical challenges. Each
channel will also have considerably different background processes and require different tech-
niques to identify. Fully-hadronic events suffer from extremely large multijet backgrounds due
to the number of expected jets (8) to be reconstructed in the final state, but benefit from the
largest branching ratio. Fully-hadronic analysis typically suffer from large jet-calibration related
systematics. Dilepton events in contrast have the smallest branching ratio, but also the clean-
est signature requiring a trigger on two oppositely-charge leptons. However the missing energy
from two neutrinos may cause issues when trying to reconstruct the top-quark four-momenta.
The `+jets can be considered as a balance between the other scenarios, both in terms of cross-
section and reconstruction. The complication in the `+jets channel comes from +jets events.
3.3 Top quark properties Top-quark physics
The s may decay leptonically or hadronically, and the leptonic decays may fall within the ac-
ceptance of e+jets and +jets channels. Due to the complex nature of the  particle, often `+jets
analyses focus on e and  only and -type analyses are performed separately.
3.3 Top quark properties
Precision measurements of many different properties of the top quark act as stringent tests of the
SM and may yield the first signs of evidence of BSM physics.
The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle and a crucial parameter of the SM and
electroweak symmetry breaking, which must be accommodated for in BSM theories. Due to this
it has the largest coupling to the Higgs boson and is predicted to have large couplings to many
BSM models. Knowledge of the top-quark mass also plays a role in predicting the vacuum
stability of the universe [42]. Therefore precision measurements of the top-quark mass may
provide powerful constraints on many different SM and BSM scenarios. Many Run 2 top-quark
mass measurements are expected to kick off shortly at both ATLAS and CMS. The ATLAS
results at 8 TeV are summarised in Figure 3.5.
Width
The top-quark width is dominated by t Wb decays, however there are some suggestions of
tension between the a previous measurement of the ratio of the top-quark widths and the expec-
tations for those values from the CKM matrix (|Vtb|2= 1.0210.032). The measured branching
ratio at D0 is (tWb)/(tWq) = 0.9 0.04 [41], however a more recent measurement
at CMS is in better agreement with |Vtb|2 with (tWb)/(tWq) = 1.014 0.03 [41].
Deviations from the predicted top-quark width could indicate the possibility for top quark to be
decaying to other final states or BSM particles which escape detection. It would also open the
possibility for a fourth generation of quarks to exist which are not currently accounted for.
3.3 Top quark properties Top-quark physics
Figure 3.5: Summary of ATLAS direct top-quark mass measurements, compared to the overall ATLAS,
Tevatron, and Tevatron+LHC combinations.
Cross-section
Deviations of the measure cross-section for the production or decay of top quarks could indicate
the presence of couplings to NP. An excess in the cross-section would imply the possibility of
heavy BSM particles being produced at the LHC and decaying via top quarks. Additionally,
precision knowledge of the top-quark cross-section is important as it appears as a large back-
ground to other physics analyses such as Higgs-boson measurements. Differential cross-section
measurements also have the potential to be sensitive to more subtle signals from NP. Top-quark
pair decay cross-section measurements are made in all channels by both ATLAS and CMS, and
contribute to combinations to tighten the overall results. Figures 3.6 details the results at 8 TeV
and 13 TeV, with no significant deviations from the SM expectations.
Spin-correlation
As the top quark does not hadronise its spin information is preserved and affects the kinematic
properties of its decay products. While the spin of either top quark in a tt decay individually

may not be measured, there are SM predictions for the correlation between their spins, which
yields observables in the angular properties of the leptons in the dilepton decay channel. BSM
scenarios (such as supersymmetric stop-quark decays) may give predictions for different spin
3.3 Top quark properties Top-quark physics
correlations [43] which could be detected by precision measurements of those angular properties.
Charge asymmetry
At leading order (LO) the rapidity distributions of top and anti-top quark are expected to be
symmetric. However at next-to-leading-order (NLO), interference between the Born and Box
feynman diagrams, and diagrams with initial and final state radiation, in the quark annihilation
production processes yields asymmetries (Figure 3.7 [44]). At the Tevatron, as the collisions
were between protons and anti-protons, this interference manifests itself as a forward-backward
asymmetry in the top quarks, however at the LHC as the pp collisions are initially symmetric
the effect is instead to create a difference in the width of the rapidity distributions, shown in
Figure 3.8 [45]. BSM models may enhance or reduce the expected charge asymmetry. Charge
asymmetry measurements have been made by ATLAS and CMS at 8 TeV, the results show no
significant deviations from SM expectations and are shown in Figures 3.9.

Analysis outline
As discussed in Section 2.6.6, CP violation implies that physical laws for matter and antimatter
are different, and that understanding the source and magnitude of this difference may be key to
understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Existing measurements in the
heavy-flavour sector [616] continue to be insufficient to explain the observed asymmetry, and
all are in good agreement with SM predictions. There are however hints at the potential for new
physics following an inclusive like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry measurement reported by the
D0 experiment [46], which observed an excess of approximately 3 from the SM, but has not
been confirmed by similar analyses at LHCb [47, 48] and BaBar [49]. This is discussed at the
end of this chapter.
4.1 CP violation in heavy flavours with top-quark events at ATLAS
The abundance of top quarks produced at the LHC, with the near-unity tWb branching ratio,
may be exploited as a high statistics source of b-quarks. This production mechanism, differing
from the coherent bb production at B-factory experiments, opens the possibility to utilise new
techniques in measuring CP asymmetries. As each b-quark is produced with a partner W -boson,
in cases where the W -boson decays to a leptonic final state the charged lepton will be correlated
precisely to the charge of the associated b-quark. The b-quark will hadronise, and in the events
where the hadron follows a semileptonic decay path, the charge of the resultant soft lepton
will determine unambiguously the charge of the b-quark at decay. Soft electrons from jets in
the ATLAS detector are extremely difficult to detect as they are buried in the electromagnetic
4.1 CP violation in heavy flavours with top-quark events at ATLAS Analysis outline
components of the jet absorbed in the ECAL. Soft muons however leave a signal in the muon
spectrometer aligned with a jet, and analyses may exploit a soft muon heavy-flavour tagging
algorithm (described in Section 7) to detect them. Knowledge of the charge of a b-quark at
the point of production and the point of decay provides information relevant to potentially CP-
violating processes.
4.1.1 Charge asymmetries
Using the `+jets channel, there are three decay chains in a tt system (Figure 4.1) which would
produce a W -boson lepton and a soft muon with the same charge (same-sign) (SS) and three
which would produce a pair of leptons with opposite charge (opposite-sign) (OS). These are
described by Equations (4.1)(4.3) and Equations (4.4)(4.6) respectively,

tonic B-meson decay.

4.1 CP violation in heavy flavours with top-quark events at ATLAS Analysis outline
the semileptonic decay of an individual quark [50] (a very small effect), or dilution in the decay
of J/ ``. Let N represent the number of soft muons with charge  which are paired with
W -boson leptons of charge . The charge of the W -boson lepton is correlated to the initial charge
of the b-quark. It is usual to measure the magnitude of CP violation in SM processes by building
asymmetries from CP conjugate decays. Following [50], SS and OS charge asymmetries (CA)
are defined as
Ass =
(N++N)
(N+++N)
, (4.7)
Aos =
(N+N+)
(N++N+)
. (4.8)
However there are experimental issues which have been neglected in this definition and
must be accounted for. Alterations to the expressions for the CAs are necessary to normalise
the observables to account for detector-related and other effects which could introduce unrelated
asymmetries into the measurement.The sources of other asymmetries include:
 tt pair production charge asymmetry. In next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations for
pp collisions at the LHC experiment, interferences between the born- and box-diagrams
for qq tt production results in different rapidity distributions for the top and the anti-top
quarks. As the detector has a finite acceptance and analyses introduce selection require-
ments on pseudorapidity , the sampled data will contain more anti-top quarks than top
quarks, and therefore more initial negatively charged W -boson leptons than positively
charged. This is a small effect as the LHC production of tt pairs is dominated by gluon
fusion, and has been measured at ATLAS to be AC = (0.90.5)% [51].
 Lepton reconstruction. Any charge-dependency in the reconstruction of leptons at the
ATLAS detector would lead to a different initial number of positive and negative W -boson
leptons. However at ATLAS no such dependence is known to exist.
 b-jet reconstruction. Any charge-dependency in the reconstruction of b-jets at the AT-
LAS detector would enter into an event selection at the same level as the lepton recon-
struction, and lead to a different initial number of positive and negative W -boson leptons.
It should be noted that a charge-dependency in the soft muon tagging algorithm will not
4.1 CP violation in heavy flavours with top-quark events at ATLAS Analysis outline
be resolved by normalising the observables as described below. The performance of the tagger
must therefore be studied as a function of charge explicitly, which is done in Section 7.

ble decay channels. The CAs are combinations of multiple individual CP asymmetries (CPA),

charm quarks (or with light quarks only). The CP asymmetries are related to B-meson mixing
and direct CP-violating b- and c-decays (additional negligible contributions from cham mixing
are omitted [50]). The decay-chain fractions, ri and ri, represent the relative rates of each chan-
nel. The decay-chain fractions are dependent on the fiducial region chosen and are calculated in
MC as:

are unaffected by the previous substitution of N
, shown in Appendix B.
4.2 The D0 like-sign dimuon asymmetry
The D0 measurement has been published several times with increasingly large data sets, but the
most recent utilised 10.4 fb1 of pp collisions at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab, Chicago. The
analysis is an inclusive counting experiment using both single muons (approximately 2 109
events) and like-sign dimuon signals (approximately 6106 events) as inputs to asymmetries of
the form
Single muon asymmetry : a =
(N+N)
(N++N)
, (4.25)
Dimuon asymmetry : A =
(N++N)
(N+++N)
, (4.26)
where in the single muon case N represents the number of events with a single muon of charge
, and in the dimuon case N represents the number of events with two muons of charge .
As this is an inclusive measurement the muons may come from many different sources, after
accounting for background and detector-related processes the measurement assumes that the
only source of non-zero charge asymmetries to which it is sensitive come from CP violation in
B decays.The single muon asymmetry is found to be consistent with zero, however A is found
to differ from the SM expectation by approximately 3, when interpreted as CP violation in
the mixing of neutral B-mesons (Figure 4.2 [48]), and also when interpreted as the result of CP
violation in the direct decays of B and D mesons (Figure 4.3 [52]).
In Figures 4.2 the flavour-specific asymmetries are defined as

Chapter 5
The LHC and ATLAS Detector
This chapter describes the structure of the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment,
as relevant for the 2012 data taking conditions at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV.
5.1 Large hadron collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the worlds largest and highest energy particle collision ex-
periment. Based at the Centre for European Nuclear Research (CERN) just outside of Geneva,
Switzerland, the LHC consists of a 27 km pseudo-circular ring about which two beams of pro-
tons are accelerated in opposite directions, 100 m underground. The beams are designed to
cross and collide at four interaction points (IP), each of which hosts a major detection exper-
iment as shown in Figure 5.1 [3]; ATLAS [1], CMS [53], LHCb [54] and ALICE [54], as well
as numerous other on-ring experiments such as TOTEM [55] and LHCf [56] which focus on
forward-physics, and off-ring experiments such as NA62 [57] which studies rare kaon decays,
and ISOLDE [58] which studies properties of atomic nuclei.
The process of proton acceleration begins at a hydrogen bottle source at LINAC 2. An
electric field is applied to strip the hydrogen of electrons, before being accelerated (as protons)
through the radiofrequency (RF) cavities of the LINAC. Protons are extracted from the hydrogen
in pulses at a rate of up to 100 microseconds per pulse until a high enough yield has been
produced, and are held in a tight beam during acceleration by quadrupole magnets. At the end
of LINAC 2, the protons have reached an energy of 50 MeV and are passed into the Proton
Synchrotron (PS) Booster (labelled in Figure 5.1 as booster) to begin the second stage of
5.1 Large hadron collider The LHC and ATLAS Detector

preparatory accelerators prior to the primary ring.
acceleration.
The booster uses several synchrotron rings to increase the energy of the protons to 1.4 GeV,
before handing over to the PS itself. The PS is a much larger synchrotron, with a 628 m circum-
ference and 277 electromagnets. This allows for the acceleration of the protons up to 25 GeV.
Once a year outside of proton collision data taking, the PS is also used to accelerate lead-ions
passed to it by the low energy ion ring (LEIR) for the heavy-ion physics experiment ALICE.
After the PS, protons are passed to the super proton-synchrotron (SPS) which has a circum-
ference of 7 km. The SPS accelerates the proton beam to 450 GeV. Historically the SPS was
used as a proton-antiproton collider prior to the LHC commission, during which time it led to
the discovery of the W - and Z-bosons. As the last stage of acceleration before the primary ring,
the SPS passes the protons into the LHC in two beams of opposite direction. The injection itself
5.1 Large hadron collider The LHC and ATLAS Detector
takes the form of proton bunches. A bunch is an individual packet of protons containing of the
order 1011 particles. This technique is used to control the collision rate of beams in the LHC. The
bunches form trains with deliberate spacing. The number of bunches and the distance between
each bunch is adjusted to increase or decrease the time between collisions according to the data
recording capabilities of the detectors. Early in Run-1 a bunch spacing of 50 ns was used to test
beam stability and allow for low luminosity sanity analyses. The design bunch spacing for the
LHC is 25 ns, this increases the luminosity (and therefore the data yield) substantially, however
additional problems are introduced related to the speed at which data can be recorded and the
amount of activity in the collisions produced, which will be discussed later in Section 5.2.5.
The LHC ring is another synchrotron accelerator, but with 1232 dipole magnets (for bend-
ing), 392 quadrupole magnets (for focusing) and 16 RF cavities (8 per beam), the LHC is capable
of accelerating protons up to extremely high energies. During Run-1, the nominal beam energy
was 3.5 TeV to create a collision centre of mass energy
s = 7 TeV. In 2012 this was increased
to 8 TeV collisions for approximately one year of data taking, it is with this data that this the-
sis is concerned. After the completion of Run-1, the LHC entered into a long shutdown (LS1)
for repairs and upgrades to move towards design energy. Run-2 started in 2015 operating at
s = 13 TeV, with the goal being 14 TeV for the highest energy collisions. The process of ac-
celerating protons from the hydrogen bottle up to collision energies can take several hours. The
2012 data in particular added up to just over 20 fb1, where an inverse barn is the standard unit
for time-integrated luminosity and is equivalent to 1b1 = 1028m2. Instantaneous luminosity
is a normalised measurement of particle flux, for beam collisions this is expressed as
L = f kb
4n
, (5.1)
where f is the revolution frequency of the two beams, kb is the number of proton-bunches per
beam,  is the usual relativistic factor and Ni represents the average number of protons per
particle bunch in each beam. The denominator is the beam cross-section (a measure of the
probability for collision between two particles, with units of area) built from the normalised
emittance n (a measure of beam quality in terms of particle spacing, where smaller values
infer denser collisions) and the amplitude function at the IP . The amplitude function can be
controlled by squeezing the beam using quadrupole magnets shortly before the IP, as shown in
Figure 5.2 [59]. Higher luminosity collisions come from producing numerous, dense bunches
5.1 Large hadron collider The LHC and ATLAS Detector
with minimal bunch spacing, low emittance and with low amplitude functions at the IP. After
accounting for inefficiencies in data taking (due to detector down-time) the total 2012 data taken
Ldt = 23.1fb1. (5.2)
Figure 5.2: Beam squeezing prior to collision at the ATLAS experiment.
For specific physics studies however only a subset of the data will be relevant, according
to the rate at which the process of interest occurs. For a given process j, the total number of
recorded events (ignoring trigger efficiencies and expressed as a subset of the total number of
events) can be described as a function of the process cross-section  j and the total integrated
luminosity. For a total number of events, N, the relation is
N = N j =
Ldt . (5.3)
The design luminosity, bunch spacing, and other parameters are compared to those achieved
in the 2012 8 TeV data run in Figure 5.3 [60].
As instantaneous luminosity is increased pile-up becomes an important problem. Pile-up
describes the overlap of many proton collisions occurring concurrently, which introduces dif-
ficulties in separating and recording individual events. Pile-up can be separated into two cate-
gories, in-time and out-of-time. In-time pileup occurs when multiple proton pairs collide during

design specifications.
the same bunch crossing and produce multiple primary vertices (PV) at the IP, which must be
distinguished algorithmically. Out-of-time pile-up occurs from separate bunch crossings, but
when the bunch spacing is too small or collision rate is too high for the read-out electronics to
keep up with. If more data enters the system before the existing event has been fully recorded
then this may cause out-of-time pile-up. This is discussed further in Section 5.2.5. Pile-up can
be described by the average number of interactions per bunch crossing , and the distribution for
pile-up during 2012 data taking is shown in Figure 5.4 [61] where it is shown that <  >= 20.7.
This is in contrast with the lower instantaneous luminosity during the previous 7 TeV run where
the average pile-up was closer to 10 interactions per bunch crossing.
5.2 ATLAS
ATLAS (A Large Toroidal LHC Apparatus) is a forward-backward symmetric general purpose
detector and one of the four major experiments based on the LHC ring. It is the largest single
detector in the world, at a length of 44 m and a height of 50 m, and weighs over 7000 t. The
detector is cylindrical in shape and follows an onion-skin design, whereby successive layers of
different materials and technologies are used to detect, identify and measure the particles created
by collisions at its centre, where the IP is. A cylindrical coordinate system is adopted (whereby
the standard x,y and z coordinates can be translated into angular information). At the ATLAS

detector, the positive x-direction is defined as pointing radially inwards from the IP to the middle
of the LHC ring, the positive y-direction is defined as pointing away from the ground, and the
positive z direction is defined as pointing parallel to the beam axis in the anti-clockwise direc-
tion following the layout of Figure 5.1. The positive-z side (z > 0) is then labelled as Side A,
as the negative-z side (z < 0) is labelled as Side C. Due to the geometry of the landscape, the
z-axis itself actually has a 1.25% incline following the shape of the LHC ring in that region [1].
Converting to the cylindrical system, a polar angle  is defined as the angle (starting on Side A)
between 0 and  in the z y plane, an azimuthal angle  spans from  to  in the x y plane,
and the radial distance between the origin and the point of interest is labelled r. In practice a
substitute angular variable  is used called the pseudorapidity, defined as  = ln tan 2 . This
substitution is made as at relativistic energies the pseudorapidity acts as an approximation for the
rapidity of a decay, which is useful as differences in rapidity are lorentz invariant. The polar an-
gle  is susceptible to lorentz contractions in the z-direction. Total distance between two points
is then given by R =
2 +2 and overall positions are described in (,) space. The
transverse direction is also defined as coinciding with the xy plane and is useful for describing
components of variables such as the transverse momentum pT and transverse missing energy
EmissT which are conserved in particle collisions and decays (alongside the full momentum infor-

mation) which can be used in calculations when information is missing about the momentum in
the z-direction of the system. The momentum in the z-direction is unknown due to missing infor-
mation on a collision-to-collision basis about the parton momentum-fractions for the colliding
constituents of the protons. The standard ATLAS detector diagram is shown in Figure 5.5 [1].
Figure 5.5: A cut-away diagram of the overall construction of the ATLAS detector, labelling the individual
components.
The ATLAS detector consists of concentric sections each with a different focus. The inner-
most layer measures charged-particle tracks and is called the inner detector (ID), outside of that
is the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) which measures the energy of photons and electrons.
The hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) then detects hadronic activity from hadrons, and finally the
outermost layer detects the presence of muons and is called the muon spectrometer (MS). The
design specifications for the intended precision of all sections is shown in Figure 5.6 [1].
5.2.1 Inner Detector
The purpose of the inner detector is to identify and distinguish tracks of charged particles in the
region immediately surrounding the beam pipe and IP. It must have extremely high resolution
in order to accurately locate the PV and any secondary vertices (SV) among the large track
density following each pp collision. To achieve the required granularity three technologies are
combined; pixel detectors, silicon micro-strip (semi-conductor) trackers (SCT) and a transition
radiation tracker (TRT). The layout of these sections is shown in Figures 5.7 [1] and 5.8 [1].
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector

pT are GeV.
After pattern recognition using hits throughout the ID, the PV is identified as the vertex with
which the largest momentum can be associated. SVs are most usually related to the decays of
b-hadrons (important to this thesis) and s.

individual components.
The inner detector functions within a 2 tesla (T) magnetic field provided by an encasing
solenoid magnet. The purpose of this field is to bend the paths of charged particles, introducing
curvature to their tracks. This curvature assists in particle identification and momentum mea-
surements. The material choice for the ID segments is also extremely important, due to the
high-radiation environment in which is it required to operate, the materials must be radiation-

tolerant. At the centre of the ID is the beam pipe, which at the intended collision point in the
ATLAS experiment is 0.8 mm thick, with an internal radius of 29 mm and made from beryllium
due to its high-transparency to particles.
The Pixel Detector wraps around the beam pipe and consists of three layers of oxygen-
doped silicon wafers. The silicon is an n-type extrinsic semiconductor, which generates electron-
hole pairs as charged particles pass through. It is treated with oxygen impurities in order to
reduce total radiation damage from charged hadrons. After ionisation from charged particles,
the electron-hole pairs drift in opposite directions under a potential difference ranging from
150 V-600 V (depending on pixel ageing), and upon reaching the ends of the pixel are detected
as hits. There are 1744 sensors, each with 47232 pixels of approximate size 50400 m2, are
arranged in concentric layers combined with three end-cap plates to cover a total pseudorapidity
range of ||< 2.5 with an intrinsic track position resolution of 10 m in the R  plane and
115 m in the z-plane [1]. The innermost pixel layer is commonly referred to as the B-layer
due to its importance in identifying the presence of secondary vertices due to b-hadron decays.
However it should be noted that for Run-2 an additional layer has been introduced in the form of
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
an instrumented beam-pipe known as the insertable B-layer (IBL), bringing the total number of
pixel layers to 4. The IBL was introduced to improve the resolution on track parameters, in the
face of higher pile-up for precision measurements such as for the Higgs boson (H bb being an
important decay channel), and to recover lost performance due to pixel failures from radiation
intensity in the existing B-layer.
The Semi-Conductor Tracker is built from silicon strips rather than squares but has a
similar purpose. Four layers of double-sided micro-strip sensors are placed at increasing radii,
complemented by 9 SCT plates in the end-cap. Each strip provides 2 hits for precise tracking,
and a total intrinsic resolution of 17 m in the R plane and 1580 m in the z-plane [1].
The Transition Radiation Tracker uses substantially different technology to cover the out-
ermost region of the ID. Transition radiation occurs when charged particles move between vol-
umes of material with different dielectric constants, related to the difference in electric fields
in each medium. The amount of radiation produced is dependent on the traversing particles
Lorentz Factor  = Em and therefore lighter particles emit more radiation this way. The intensity
of the radiation is proportional to the particle energy E. Combining the two effects provides
some information for particle identification. The TRT consists of proportional drift tubes filled
with a mixture of xenon (70%), carbon dioxide (27%) and oxygen (3%) gas. The drift tubes each
contain four straws; cylindrical negatively charged cathodes around singular (31 m diameter)
anode wires. Inside each drift tube polypropylene foil is placed between the straws in order to
provide the material-transitions required for the generation of transition radiation. As a particle
passes through the drift tube, the transition radiation ionises the gas mixtures and the ionised
electrons move towards the central anodes before being read out as electrical signals. Multi-
ple signals are then recombined to determine a particles trajectory. Although 52544 straws are
present in the barrel, and 122880 are radially aligned in the end-caps, an average particle will
only produce 35-40 hits.
5.2.2 Calorimetry
In particle physics detection, particle energies can be determined by placing absorption materials
in the path of the decay products of a pp collision, by then counting the number of photons which
are produced. The ATLAS experiment employs sampling calorimeters, these are systems which
alternate between layers of absorption material (to induce particle interactions) and detection
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
material, known as an active medium (AM). Homogeneous calorimeters use the same material
for absorbing and collecting particle energy. As sampling calorimeters cannot ensure that 100%
of the measurable energy is deposited in the AM, the total energy contained follows the relation
for the sampling fraction
fsamp =
EAMdep
Ecaldep
, (5.4)
where EAMdep is the energy deposited into the AM, and E
dep is the total energy deposited into
the calorimeter. The sampling fraction will depend on the materials chosen for the AM (for
which also the calorimeter response, i.e. the efficiency of the AM in collecting energy, must
be considered) and their relative thickness with respect to the absorption layers. This requires a
scaling factor to be applied to determine the true particle energy, and the calibration is usually
performed using minimally ionising particles of well known initial energy.
Electrons and photons may be detected by the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimter (ECAL).
On traversing an absorber, an electron has some probability to interact and produce a single
photon via bremsstrahlung (braking-radiation). Photons may also pair produce into electron-
positron pairs. This creates what is known as an EM shower in the material. For EM interactions
this is described by the radiation length X0 of a material. The radiation length is the distance in
a material through which an electron would have to travel to be reduced in energy to a factor of
e of its initial energy E0
E = E0e
X0 , (5.5)
where (E,x) describe the energy and position of the particle at time of measurement.
Hadrons may be detected by the HCAL. On traversing the absorber the hadrons will experi-
ence nuclear interactions and create more hadrons of lower energy, this process repeats until the
initial particle energy has been fully absorbed. The structure created by the decay chains of the
hadrons is much larger and often travels much further than an EM shower, it is instead called
a jet. About 30% of activity within a jet is EM showers from 0   decays. The relevant
material property for nuclear interactions is the interaction length 0.
The calorimeters need to be long enough to cover enough X0 or 0 lengths to contain all
of the energy of EM showers and hadronic jets. Failure to contain the energy from a particle
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
decay is known as punch-through and leads to issues of fake signals in subsequent detector
layers. Punch-through from the HCAL may leave a signal in the muon spectrometer and fake
the signature of a muon.
Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The ECAL is made of lead absorption plates layered with liquid argon as the active medium for
energy deposition. Lead is a high density material to minimise the X0, and has a total thickness
of  24X0 in the barrel and  26X0 in the end-caps. Liquid argon (LAr) is chosen as the active
medium due to its intrinsic radiation hardness. The barrel region of the ECAL covers a pseudo-
rapidity range of ||< 1.475 and the two end-caps extend this range to 1.375 < ||< 3.2. There
is however a crack region excluded from measurements, 1.37 < ||< 1.52, so-called because
there is too much non-detector material (such as cabling) which makes calorimetry unreliable.
The barrel sections of the ECAL follow an accordion geometry in order to be fully hermetic in
the  space, and are split into 16 modules of  = 22.5 each. The end-cap sections are built
from two wheels behind an additional LAr presampler. Each wheel is divided into an inner and
outer wheel, consisting of eight segments to again fully cover the required  geometry.
Hadronic Calorimeter
The HCAL consists of both a barrel and an end-cap. The barrel section uses different materials
to the rest of the detectors in order to provide the high-density environment required to minimise
the interaction length 0 and minimise the overall size (and cost) of the detector. For the region
of ||< 1.7 it uses steel absorption layers alternated with scintillating tiles. The scintillating tiles
induce production of ultraviolet scintillation photons as ionising particles pass through. These
photons are collected, shifted to lower-wavelengths by doped fibres, and are directed towards
photomultiplier tubes for measurement of the total energy. The total thickness corresponds to
9.7 0. The end-caps of the HCAL however again use LAr, as greater radiation-hardness is
required for the more forward region, combined with copper absorbers due to its slightly smaller
nuclear interaction length. The end-caps consist of two wheels at each end, each split into 32
segments, and covers the range of 1.5 < ||< 3.2.
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
Forward Calorimeter
The forward calorimeter (FCAL) system is included to extend the range in  of ATLASs
calorimetry capabilities. Positioned inside the ECAL and HCAL end-caps close to the beam
pipe, the FCAL again employs LAr active layers, interspersed with copper (for EM) and tungsten
(for hadronic) absorbers to cover a pseudorapidity region of 3.1 < ||< 4.9. This is extremely
high-radiation region includes only the most forward-physics, as such data from this section of
the detector is not commonly found in physics analyses.
5.2.3 Muon Spectrometer
The MS is of paramount importance to the analysis presented in this thesis as it provides the
basis for detection of muons, used (along with the ID) for jet b-tagging by the soft muon tagger
(Section 7). Whilst interacting electromagnetically, muons do not get absorbed by the ECAL as
their large mass minimises the energy loss through bremsstrahlung, which is proportional to Em2 .
Energy loss due to ionisation is inversely proportional to the energy of a particle also, and so at
collision energies used by the LHC the resultant muons are able to escape the detector - although
still leaving detectable hits in the ID and MS as they travel. Muons are also not absorbed by the
HCAL again due to minimal energy loss through bremsstrahlung, and as unlike hadrons they do
not undergo strong nuclear interactions. The MS has three purposes; to distinguish muon tracks
in the ID from other charged particles (by combining the tracks in the ID with tracks in the MS),
to provide high resolution muon momentum measurements using a combined ID-MS track under
ATLASs magnetic fields, and to provide fast muon-trigger information (see Section 5.2.5) for
data taking. The MS is subject to the second magnetic field in the ATLAS detector, generated
by toroids and explained in detail in Section 5.2.4. The MS is designed to have a resolution
of pT  10% for 1 TeV tracks, and pT  4% for muons in the momentum range relevant
to this anaysis. The MS, consists of both barrel and end-cap regions, with a total coverage of
||< 2.7. For tracking, the majority of the barrel and end-cap sections used monitored drift tubes
(MDT), except for the innermost end-cap for which cathode-strip chambers (CSC) are used, due
to the improved capabilities in the higher-radiation region of 2 < ||< 2.7 which impacts upon
the quality of pattern recognition and muon reconstruction efficiency. For triggering, the inner
(||< 1.05) barrel region uses three concentric layers of resistive plate chambers (RPC) whilst
the outer (1.05 < ||< 2.4) region uses thin gap chambers (TGC) to deal with the high-particle-
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
intensity.
Tracking
Monitored drift tubes are pressurised with a mixture of argon (93%) and carbon dioxide (7%)
gas, with a central tungsten-rhenium wire under a potential difference of 3080 V. With similar
functionality to straws, ionising particles passing through the gas will drift towards the central
point and register as a signal. This requires an average drift time of  700 ns and provides
an average resolution of  80 m per tube. Multiple tubes are then stacked together for each
chamber to improve the total resolution to about 35 m.
Cathode-strip chambers are radially-oriented multi-wire proportional chambers with sev-
eral layers to resolve multi-track ambiguities. The wires act as the anodes above the orthogonally-
oriented cathode strips. The total precision achieved by the CSCs is on the order of 60 m per
plane, for a total of about 40 m in r and 4 mm in .
Triggering
Resistive plate chambers are 2 mm-separated charged plates between which an ionisable gas
and a large potential difference is applied (the electric field is of the order 4.9 kVmm1). Passing
charged particles will ionise and produce electron avalanches. As there are three layers, the
potential for up to six measurements in  and  is provided. The RPCs provide a low-pT trigger
for (three out of four) hits in two layers, and a high-pT trigger for at least one hit in each of three
layers, with a signal width in the region of 5 ns.
Thin gap chambers are similar in functionality to CSCs, as they are multi-wire proportional
chambers. In this case however instead of precision tracking, the TGCs are used to provide
a trigger signal within 25 ns of a particle passing combined with a lower resolution position
coordinate.
5.2.4 Magnet system
The ATLAS detector uses multiple superconducting magnets (three toroids and one solenoid)
to achieve the large fields used for bending charged particles to measure their momenta. The
magnets are large and as such dominate multiple areas of the detector, which must be considered
when calculating total X0 and 0 lengths for event reconstruction and detector simulations.
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
The central solenoid (CS) surrounds the ID and creates a 2 T axial magnetic field to bend
the paths of charged tracks. It is designed to introduce minimal radiation lengths into the detector
mass and shares a vacuum vessel with the inner ECAL calorimeter.
The barrel toroid (BT) consists of eight air-core racetrack-shaped coils, which generate a
total magnetic field of (up to 3.9 T but averaging) 0.5 T for the MS system.
The end-cap toroids (ECT) also consist of eight coils, offset by 22.5 to the BT, and gener-
ate a total of (up to 4.1 T but on average) 1 T for the MS in the higher pseudorapidity region.
5.2.5 Triggers and Data Acquisition
The trigger and data acquisition (TDAQ) system at the ATLAS detector is responsible for react-
ing to and recording events of interest. It has been changed substantially during LS1, but the
description given is here as appropriate for Run-1 data taking. ATLAS employs a three-stage
system. At design performance, the raw data output from the ATLAS detector if taken in full
would be overwhelming with a rate of about 50 TBs1. This is prohibitively large, given a re-
alistic data storage rate closer to 300 MBs1, and is due to the design bunch crossing rate of
40 MHz. Even during the 8 TeV run, a rate of 20 MHz was used. The vast majority of bunch
collisions do not yield interesting physics. Low energy processes with large cross-sections
dominate the output stream, and whilst these are useful for calibration and re-determination/re-
discovery of known physics phenomena, the vast yield effectively gets in the way of new physics
searches and measurements. The task of the three-stage system therefore is to reduce the output
of known uninteresting physics to an acceptable level, allowing for efficient usage of the lim-
ited storage and recording speed, this is sometimes referred to as online selection and requires
the definition of prescales to reduce recording rates by predetermined factors. It is a system
which must be carefully managed, to minimise bias and prevent the accidental removal of new
physics processes which could be missed.
The level 1 trigger (L1) is a hardware-based solution which acts first for each pp colli-
sion. The L1 uses physical signatures of electrons/photons in ECAL, jets/s in the HCAL,
high-pT muons in the MS, or large missing momentum to decide whether an event should be
recorded. Only low-granularity information is required, coming from the MS RPC and TGC and
the calorimeter subsystems (the ID is not required due to the more complex readout). The deci-
sion is only based on the multiplicity of signals. During 8 TeV data taking, the L1 trigger was
5.2 ATLAS The LHC and ATLAS Detector
required to make this decision within about 2.5 s and reduce the output rate to 70 kHz, with the
back flow of collision information held in a buffer known as the read-out system (ROS). If the
L1 trigger decides an event should be recorded, it defines a region-of-interest (RoI) to be used
as a seed in the next stage of the triggering system. An RoI defines the physical region of each
detector segment which led to an L1-acceptance and in which there is likely to be interesting
physics signals.
The level 2 trigger (L2) occurs on a processing farm and uses information within the RoIs
handed to it by the L1 and ROS to perform basic event reconstruction. An RoI only contains
coordinates, energies and types of signatures to minimise the data transfer, although the L2 does
have access to the full granularity of the detectors within the RoI, as well as tracking information
from the ID. L2 selections then follow preset criteria and can process many bunch-crossings in
parallel. During 8 TeV data taking, the L2 was required to make a decision within about 75 ms
and reduce the output rate to 6.5 kHz. Decision parameters include shower shapes, matches
between tracks and clusters, and missing momentum thresholds.
The event-builder (EB) acts after the L2 but before the final stage of the triggering system.
It collects together all available information from a given event which has passed an L2 decision
and assembles a single formatted data structure for further use. An average event might produce
a file of approximately 1.3 MBs.
The event filter (EF) is the final stage of the online selection process. The EF has the
advantage of having the fully reconstructed event and running in parallel over large computing
farms. At 8 TeV it was only required to make a decision on each event within 1 s. The decisions
for the EF are largely based on specific physics criteria, and the events are separated into various
physics streams for offline analysis, where a single event may appear in multiple streams.
The L2, EB and EF are commonly referred to as the high-level trigger (HLT).
The design event rates and processing times for the ATLAS detector, alongside those achieved
during the 8 TeV run, are shown in Table 5.1 [31].
Collisions L1 L2 EF
8 TeV 20 MHz 70 kHz (2.5 s) 6.5 kHz (75 ms) 1 kHz (1 s)
Design 40 MHz 75 kHz (2.5 s) 4.0 kHz (40 ms) 300 Hz (4 s)

Data simulation and object selection
6.1 Monte Carlo simulation
Monte Carlo (MC) is the name given to simulations of collision events at particle colliders. At
the LHC it is required to model the propagation of physics processes resulting from pp colli-
sions all the way to final state particles which may be detected by the instrumentation, in order
to make predictions for the expected event signals for each decay process of interest in analyses.
The simulations include the initial hard-scattering interactions, the underlying parton interac-
tions, the parton shower (PS), hadronisation, the decay of the resultant hadrons and gluonic and
photonic radiation throughout the whole process. It also includes the mapping of the aforemen-
tioned processes onto the detector instruments and the production of simulated output signals
utilising the same reconstruction algorithms as are applied to data.
6.1.1 Event generation
Event generators for the LHC start from the point of pp (shown as incoming objects in green on
both sides of Figure 6.1 [62]) collisions producing hard-scattering interactions. Matrix element
information (describing partonic interactions) is combined with parton density functions (PDFs)
to calculate the cross-section for different hard-scattering processes, where the PDFs describe
the probability of a particular parton (quark or gluon, shown in blue) with a particular momen-
tum fraction of the total proton momentum being present to partake in the interaction (central
red circle). Once a hard-scattering interaction is modelled for a particular collision, the output
particles from the interaction (shown in red) undergo parton showering. Parton showering de-

scribes the propagation of coloured objects (quarks, gluons) including the emission of gluons
from quarks, and the production of quarks from gluon splitting. The remaining objects are then
recombined via hadronisation (shown in pale green) into colourless hadrons, which may con-
tinue to decay (dark green). Interactions of objects not involved in the hard-scattering process
(including proton remnants) are referred to as the underlying event (shown in purple), this con-
stitutes multiple QCD processes with their own decays otherwise known as pile-up. The yellow
parts of the diagram represent electromagnetic emissions.

A summary of the MC simulation tools used in this analysis and their main features is given
in Table 6.1 [63]. Often separate generators and parton shower models are combined to improve
the precision of event simulation. This requires matching [64] to be performed to connect the
short-distance matrix element calculations from generators to the long-distance descriptions
for parton showering, without double-counting initial- and final-state radiation.

6.1.2 Detector simulation
A tool-kit known as GEANT4 [72] contains all available information regarding the material
construct of the ATLAS detector. This includes the functionality and alignment of each compo-
nent, detailed descriptions of the wiring and support structures, and maps of the magnetic fields.
The generated events are passed through GEANT4 in order to simulate the interactions of the
particles with the detector mass, and the modelling of further particle decays due to these inter-
actions, such as the formation of electromagnetic showers in the ECAL. Following modelling
of particle decays with the detector, the response of the instrumentation is simulated and output
signals from each section (ID, ECAL, HCAL, MS) are propagated to the same reconstruction
algorithms (Sections 6.2- 6.2.6) as used for data. This results in the production of the simulated
event output known as MC which may be directly compared to the measurements made during
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
data taking. A secondary technique for detector simulation, which is an order of magnitude
faster, is ATLFASTII (AFII) [7375]. Whilst GEANT4 utilises the full detector information,
AFII fully models the ID and MS but parameterises the response of the calorimeters as a func-
tion of the active material in the detector. AFII is use to simulate some of the systematic MC
samples in this analysis.
6.2 Object reconstruction
The algorithms which utilise output signals from the detector and predict the particle (and their
properties) which caused them, perform a task known as object reconstruction. The reconstruc-
tion of objects relevant to tt `+jets decays requires numerous algorithms.
6.2.1 Vertices and Tracks
As described in Section 5.2.1 the ID is designed to provide a series of spacepoints following the
transitions of charged particles through its layers. The first few spacepoints are used to define
track seeds which are then extended to further layers to form track candidates. Each candidate
track, from different combinations of the spacepoint hits within the ID, is provided a weight
by comparing to a large selection of pre-simulated potential combinations of all spacepoints in
the ID with the magnetic field taken into account. This procedure is an implementation of the
Kalman Filter, in which each new material layer represents an opportunity to for the track to
take a number of different paths, and fitting each different fork provides the relevant weights.
Tracks candidates below a particular weight are removed and in cases where ambiguities appear
between multiple tracks (the same spacepoints are utilised in multiple separate track candidates),
the tracks with the largest weights are kept. Quality conditions are then enforced (for example
no track may miss a certain number of detector hits in its path) and the selections are refitted
using the full ID information. The primary vertex (PV) for an event is decided by selecting the
reconstructed vertex (feeding the spacepoints backwards to the beam pipe) which has the largest
associated momentum.
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
6.2.2 Electron reconstruction
Electron reconstruction at ATLAS relies on the combination of ID and ECAL information. As-
sociation is required between reconstructed tracks and energy deposits (clusters) in the ECAL.
Clusters are reconstructed using seed energy deposits with a transverse energy of at least 2.5 GeV [76],
using MC W  e and Z  ee decays and the expected efficiency for high energy electrons
(ET > 20 GeV) nears 100%. Tracks with pT > 0.5 GeV are extrapolated out of the ID and into
the ECAL to be compared to the cluster seed position in (,), and are considered matched if
||< 0.05 and ||< 0.1|, where the larger  criterion is required to account for the effect
of bremsstrahlung. Multiple track matches with ECAL clusters are distinguished by selecting
the track with the most spacepoints and the smallest R to the cluster seed. In the absence of
matching tracks, ECAL clusters are considered to be photon candidates instead. Hard-scatter
electrons are separated from those originating from pair production from photons by checking
for multiple tracks which match the ECAL cluster but share a displaced vertex. The matching of
a cluster with a track forms an electron candidate. Electron candidates then undergo cluster size
optimisation. This process determines the measured energy of the electron candidate by vary-
ing the window in the ECAL for which deposited energy is to be associated with the candidate.
It must take into account several factors; the energy loss of the electron in the ID, the energy
deposited in the ECAL cluster, the correction required as part of the sampling calorimeter tech-
nique, energy deposited outside of the cluster and energy which may leak beyond the length of
the ECAL. These are mostly estimated using MC simulations as functions of  and . Confirma-
tion of electron candidates as real electrons requires the criteria to be met for the properties of the
cluster and track variables. Electrons may be classified as loose, medium or tight in accordance
with the strictness of the selection criteria applied. These are discussed in detail in [76] and in
Appendix C. Muultiple criteria are provided in order to allow optimisation of object selection
on an analysis-to-analysis basis, by providing different levels of background-rejection countered
by different levels of electron identification efficiency.
An additional selection of tight++ uses isolation requirements to further separate electron
candidates from other activity such as jets, although these requirements may optimised in accor-
dance to the needs of each analysis. Isolation requirements may take several forms [77]:
 Calorimeter-based isolation. The sum of transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
cells in a cone of size R around the electron is given the label EconeRT . The standard cone
sizes for ATLAS analysis are R = 0.2,0.30.4. The contribution to EconeRT within 
= 0.1250.175 of the electron cluster barycentre is removed, and the total is corrected
for energly leakage from the electron shower into the isolation cone. A correction is also
applied to account for pileup as a function of the number of reconstructed vertices.
 Momentum-based isolation. The scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the tracks
with pT > 0.4 GeV in a cone of size R around the electron is given the label pconeRT . The
electron track itself is excluded, and all other tracks must originate from the same primary
vertex, must have at least nine silicon hits and must have a hit on the innermost pixel layer
(for quality control).
 Track-based isolation. The number of tracks within a cone around the electron, satisfying
the same criteria as the momentum-based isolation, is labelled NconeRtrk .
6.2.3 Muon reconstruction
Muon reconstruction at ATLAS may rely on information from the MS only, or on the com-
bination of ID and MS information [78] as described below. In the context of this analysis,
hard-muons from W -boson decays are reconstructed using the MUID [79] algorithm, whilst
soft-muons from semileptonic b-decays are reconstructed using the STACO [80] algorithm.
 Standalone reconstruction: This technique utilises hits in the MS only. Pattern recogni-
tion (on each MS chamber individually) is applied to the MS hit spacepoints and straight
line fits are applied, these fits are referred to as segments. Segments from all three MS
chambers are then combined to perform a full track fit including the magnetic field ef-
fects, and extrapolation back to the primary vertex is performed accounting for expected
energy loss for the muon through the detector material. Standalone reconstruction is a
prerequisite to both the MUID and STACO algorithms, although the exact method differs.
For MUID the standalone reconstruction employs the Moore algorithm [79] which looks
for hit patterns using a Hough transformation. For STACO the standalone reconstruction
employs the Muonboy algorithm, which builds tracks radially inwards starting from the
outermost muon station.
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
 Tagging ID tracks: This technique tags ID tracks using additional information from the
MS or calorimeters, and it is utilised to recover muons in areas with limited MS coverage.
ID tracks extrapolated to the MS and associable with at least one MS segment track are
labelled as segment-tagged. ID tracks extrapolated to the ECAL and associable with an
energy deposit compatible with a minimum ionising particle are labelled as calo-tagged.
Both techniques may be utilised to complement the MUID and STACO algorithms.
 Combined reconstruction: This technique requires explicit combination of ID and MS
information. Standalone MS tracks may be extrapolated using different methods back
to the ID, and matched with existing ID tracks to create a single muon track candidate.
The power of this technique is in improvement in the resolution of spacial and kinematic
muon measurements using all available information. The MUID combination technique
performs a full track refit using all of the spacepoints in the ID and MS, whereas the
STACO combination performs a statistical combination (using a 2 fit) of ID and MS
track parameters; ,, pT ,d0,z0. Ambiguous ID-MS track combinations are resolved by
choosing the track-pair with the best 2.
All muons for use in analyses need to satisfy a set of requirements recommended by the
Muon Combined Performance (MCP) [81] group to ensure quality criteria are met as in the
points below, where TRT outliers describe either straw tubes with a signal which are not crossed
by the track, or TRT track hits which failed to form a smooth trajectory with the pixel and SCT.
The MCP cuts are used to reduce contamination from fake tracks and punch-through.
 MCP Cuts:
 N(Pixel hits) + N(crossed dead pixel sensors) > 0
 N(SCT hits) + N(crossed dead SCT sensors) < 4
 N(Pixels holes) + N(SCT holes) < 3
 Track extension into the TRT:
 If 0.1 < || < 1.9: N(TRT hits) + N(TRT outliers) > 5 and N(TRT outliers)
 0.9(N(TRT hits) + N(TRT outliers))
 if ||  0.1 or ||  1.9: If N(TRT hits) + N(TRT outliers) > 5 then require
N(TRT outliers)  0.9(N(TRT hits) + N(TRT outliers))
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
For this analysis, hard muons are required to fulfil the MUID criteria as per the default selec-
tion for ATLAS top-quark analyses. The soft muons from semileptonic b-decays are required to
fulfil the STACO selection because of historical reasons; the previous iteration of the soft muon
tagger utilised a 2 match between ID and MS tracks, which is more in-line with the construc-
tion of a STACO muon. MUID is considered to be a slightly higher efficiency algorithm (good
for identifying muons coming from the W -boson decay), whilst STACO has better fake rejection
(good for improving the purity of the SMT tags).
6.2.4 Jet reconstruction
The hadronisation and subsequent decay of quarks and gluons as they traverse the detector re-
sults in the formation of cones of particles known as jets. Jets comprise of chains of hadronic
decays producing increasingly soft hadrons until the full energy of the decay is absorbed by
the hadronic calorimeter. Jets also contain electromagnetic components primarily from 0 
decays. Jet reconstruction algorithms attempt to rebuild the original parton interaction from the
combination of all reconstructed particles in the jet, by clustering together the energy deposits in
the calorimeters into a single object. Some constraints must be considered in the reconstruction
of jets, such as infrared and collinear safety. Infrared safety describes the requirement for the
number of reconstructed jets to be independent from the effects of soft gluon emissions, such as
in Figure 6.2 [82]. Collinear safety describes the requirement for the number of reconstructed
jets to be independent from the effects of collinear splittings, such as in Figure 6.3 [82]. The
ATLAS default reconstruction algorithm is called anti-kT and is described below.
Figure 6.2: A representation of a collinear safe algorithm (left) for which the number of jets is not
modified due to the soft gluon emissions in (a) and (b). A collinear unsafe algorithm is also represented
(right) for which the number of jets reconstructed is altered by the same emissions, between (c) and
(d). The verticle lines represent partons with the height of each line proportional to their transverse
momentum, the horizontal axis indicates rapidity.
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
Figure 6.3: A representation of two jets (a) which remain as two jets when reconstructed with an infrared
safe algorithm (b), but converge to a single jet when reconstructed using an infrared unsafe algorithm (c).
Anti-kT algorithm
Sequential recombination algorithms such as the anti-kT algorithm [83] work by building jets
by iteratively considering particle combinations until certain conditions are met. Two variables
may be defined; di, j as the distance between two calorimeter cells with energy deposits, and di,B
as the distance between calorimeter cell i and the beam axis
di j = min
k2pti ,k
) 2i j
, (6.1)
diB = k
ti , (6.2)
where 2i j = (yi j)
+(i j)
2, kti is the transverse momentum of particle i, yi is the rapidity,
and  is the azimuthal angle. The parameter R defines the intended radius for a jet, and the
parameter p varies to specify the type of sequential recombination algorithm invoked; p = 1 is
the inclusive kT algorithm, p = 0 is the Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) algorithm, and p =1 is the
anti-kT algorithm.
The anti-kT algorithm considers all pairs of calorimeter cells i, j and calculates in each case
di j and diB, if di j > diB then the energy deposits in the two cells are combined to form the
prototype of a jet, and the process continues until diB > di j when the jet is considered fully
constructed, and any remaining objects may begin to form the prototype for a second jet. This
method is infrared and collinear safe as soft emissions are inclined to combine with hard jet
prototypes before combining with one another. The radius parameter R is set to 0.4 as default in
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
ATLAS analyses, and objects at a distance of 2R or greater apart will form separate jets.
The behaviour of recombination algorithms using variables of this form depend greatly on
the choice of the parameterp. The differences in behaviour are shown in Figure 6.4 [83], which
represents the reconstruction a parton-level event surrounded by  104 random soft particles.
The kT and C/A algorithms reproduce jets with jagged edges and considerable dependence on the
soft particles. An additional algorithm, SISCone [84] produces more desirably circular shapes,
however fails to sensible reconstruct a boundary between the hard (light green) jet and the soft
(purple) jet next to it. The anti-kT algorithm however creates uniformly shaped jets with sensible
boundaries dependent on the relative pT of nearby objects.
Figure 6.4: Four examples of jet reconstruction on a parton-level event generated with  104 random
soft particles. The kT and C/A algorithms show dependency on the distribution of the soft particles. The
anti-kT algorithm is less influenced by soft radiation and produces uniformly shaped jets.
Jet calibration
The ATLAS HCAL has a different response for the electromagnetic and hadronic components
of jets. Jets must have their measured energy corrected for this effect, and for other issues which
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
could lead to the incorrect determination of the energy of the initial partons, such as pile-up, PV
alignment and non-instrumented areas of the detector. Groups of clusters of energy deposits in
the calorimeter are known as topo-clusters, shower shape variables are used to determine if the
clusters should be reconstructed at the electromagnetic scale (EM scale) as EM components tend
to be shorter, or at the hadronic scale (called local cluster weighting, or the LCW scale), as
hadronic jets tend to penetrate further into the calorimeter due to the relative size of the hadronic
and electromagnetic interaction lengths. The energy calibrations for the EM and LCW scales
are derived from MC simulations. After a scale has been set, the remaining aforementioned
corrections are applied to produce either the EM+JES or LCW+JES scales, where JES is the jet
energy scale. The resulting jet energies measured in simulation should then match those from
data.
6.2.5 b-Tagging techniques
The identification of jets from the decay of heavy flavour b- or c-quarks is critical to many
physics analyses, from CP violation studies such as described in this thesis, to H  bb cross-
section measurements. The identification b-jet decays is known as b-tagging and there are nu-
merous strategies for performing this task. A few techniques are described below:
 Secondary vertex tagging (SV0, SV1): b-hadrons are relatively long-lived particles
which travel a greater distance in the ATLAS detector than other hadrons. Their decays
then result in track vertices which are separated from the IP by a measurable distance, and
can be reconstructed to identify the jet as a b-jet.
A long-lived b-hadron will travel a distance of the order d = c, where  =
,  =
is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and  is the average lifetime of the particle
(  1012s for B-hadrons). Using  =
E2m2
, a neutral b-hadron with an
energy E = 50 GeV may travel a distance of approximately d  5 mm.
Secondary vertex taggers utilise the distance d as the discriminating variable for b-tagging
jets, and must apply appropriate requirements on this length to define the tagging effi-
ciency at different working points (a looser requirement will result in a high efficiency but
a low purity from the large number of fakes). This is the technique of the SV0 algorithm.
The SV1 algorithm extends the technique by considering additional variables such as the
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
ratio of energy assigned to the tracks in a jet to the energy assigned to tracks associated
with the primary vertex. The additional parameters are combined into a likelihood fit to
increase the performance of the tagger.
 Multivariate tagging (MV1): Multivariate taggers intake numerous jet variables such
as secondary and tertiary vertex positions, topological information, track invariant mass
reconstruction, and output from other taggers, and pass them through multivariate algo-
rithms such as boosted decision trees and neural networks. The MV1 tagger is a neural
network calibrated by ATLAS to separate b-jet decays from light-flavour (LF) jets, the
performance for which is shown in Figure 6.5 [85] for a collision energy of
s = 8 TeV.
The MV1 tagger uses as its input, the output discriminants of several other taggers:
 SV1: As described above, a vertex based tagger.
 IP3D: A tagger based on the transverse and longitudinal track parameters d0,z0.
 JetFitter: A topology based tagger, which discriminates on the basis of the number
of vertices with at least two tracks, the total number of tracks at each vertex, the
number of additional single track vertices, the mass attributed to each vertex, the
energy of the particles associated with each vertex as a fraction of the total energy
associated to the jet, and the flight length significance (L/L for each vertex).
Alternate versions of the MV1 tagger exist, labelled MV1c, which are trained to provide
extra rejection against c-jets [85]. The working points calibrated at
s = 8 TeV for the
MV1 tagger discussed later in this thesis are shown in Table 6.2 [86].

(c)  semileptonic branching ratio. Semileptonic HF decays within jets result in a
collinear electron or muon within the jet, usually with a low pT distribution. Soft electron
tagging is very challenging and not utilised at ATLAS, it would require the reconstruction
of a low energy EM shower aligned with a jet. The jet itself would have EM components in
the ECAL and the two would likely be indistinguishable. Soft muon tagging on the other
hand is viable, as the MS is the outermost layer of ATLAS and the jet energy is usually
fully absorbed by the detector prior to this region. Collinear muons from the decay of
HF hadrons within jets may still be identified as hits in the MS aligned with the jet axis.
Sources of fakes for soft muon taggers includes the decay-in-flight of other hadrons such
as pions or kaons, and punch-through of highly energetic jets into the MS. A soft muon
tagger may be calibrated using variables related to the muon to reject fakes. The soft muon
tagger calibrated in this thesis utilises the fractional difference in momentum between a
track candidate as measured in the ID, and as measured in the MS when extrapolated back
to the ID, this is known as the Momentum Imbalance (MI):
6.2 Object reconstruction Data simulation and object selection
pID pME
(6.3)
As muons are minimally ionising particles, a soft muon produced from a semileptonic b-
decay will lose only a small amount of energy as it traverses the detector and the fractional
difference in momentum will be very small. Tracks in the MS aligned with ID tracks
associated to charged hadrons and their decays, or punch-through hits in the MS associated
with any ID tracks, will show a larger fractional difference in momentum and a larger
value of MI, as shown in Figure 6.6.

has been normalised to unity.

as the colliding partons to good approximation will have zero momentum in the x- and y
directions, it can be assumed that the total initial (and therefore final) momentum for those
components (the transverse momentum) should sum to zero. In events for which the sum of
transverse momentum does not equal zero, it must be assumed that an undetected particle (e.g.
a neutrino) has escaped undetected, the imbalance in transverse momentum is called missing
energy EmissT . The ATLAS strategy for the reconstruction of missing energy is described in
detail in [87]. The missing transverse energy is defined as the quadratic sum of the x- and
y-components

where Emiss,calox(y) represents the contribution from the calorimeters, where each contribution has

tion from the muon spectrometer. Both are assisted by tracking information in the ID, to assist in
the inclusion of low-pT objects which fail to reach the calorimeters, and to improve the removal
of fake MS hits from punch-through by only using combined ID-MS tracks.

Calibration of the Soft Muon Tagger
Determination of jet flavour is critical to many physics analysis at ATLAS. Precision measure-
ments of the SM (such as top quark and Higgs boson production cross-sections) and searches
for new physics (NP) often rely on the identification of heavy-flavour (HF) jets. The most com-
monly used tools include vertex taggers, which exploit the relatively long-lifetimes of b- and
c- hadrons which result in secondary particle production vertices identified in the ATLAS in-
ner detector (ID). The soft muon heavy-flavour tagging algorithm (SMT) is designed to identify
reconstructed jets from the decays of B-hadrons by exploiting the  21% branching ratio for
semileptonic b (c)  decays. This branching ratio results in a tagger with an overall lower
efficiency than vertex based tagging algorithms, however on the subset of events for which a
soft muon exists a working point may be calibrated with is very efficient and has a good light-jet
rejection. The SMT is a complementary tool which does not use vertex information. It focuses
on the subset of events with semileptonic b- and c- decays and is sensitive to alternate systematic
uncertainties. The calibration of a tagger is required to account for differences in performance
when applied to data and to MC, and results in a set of scale factors (SF) to account for such
differences. The calibration of the SMT is based on the momentum imbalance (MI) between a
muon track found in the inner ID and a track in the muon spectrometer (MS) extrapolated back
to the ID (ME). Selecting jets to tag based on this parameter allows for good light-jet rejection.
As the SMT depends only on the quality of agreements between muon tracks as measured in the
ID and MS, the calibration of the tagger does not require the presence of a jet. The calibration
may be performed using isolated J/  low-pT muons and Z   high-pT muons. This
chapter will describe the calibration of the tagger for the ATLAS 8 TeV data set. I updated the
7.1 Tag and Probe Calibration of the Soft Muon Tagger
calibration code for the tagger at 8 TeV to use the momentum imbalance parameter, from the
previous iteration of a track-based 2 technique [19], within the existing infrastructure.
7.1 Tag and Probe
Tag and probe is a well-defined technique for obtaining data-driven performance estimates. The
technique attempts to utilise a pure selection of events in data on which to calibrate algorithms,
as the closest equivalent to a MC study where the truth information is always known. A data
sample is obtained (following the selection requirements in Section 7.1.2) containing J/ 
events. Each event is expected to contain two muon tracks; one is required to satisfy stringent
criteria to ensure (as best as possible) that it is a muon track from a J/, this track is the Tag
and requires the combination of an MS and ID track. A pool of secondary tracks (the Probes)
satisfy less stringent criteria and are ID tracks only. The Tag is then paired with any Probe tracks
which generate the correct invariant mass (within a window) when combined with the Tag. For
the purpose of this tagger calibration a subset of Probes known as the MuonProbes are defined,
where a MuonProbe is a Probe track in the ID able to be combined with a track in the MS. The
fraction of Tag and MuonProbe pairs out of the total number of Tag and Probe pairs is defined
to be the combined muon reconstruction efficiency (reco), as in Equation 7.1. On this subset the
performance of the SMT tagger may then determined. The fraction of Tag and MuonProbe pairs
for which the MuonProbe satisfies the SMT requirements, out of all Tag and MuonProbe pairs,
is defined to be the efficiency of the SMT MI (MI), as in Equation 7.2. The aforementioned
Data/MC scale factors are defined as the ratio between the measurement efficiencies, in each
relevant region of phase space, as in Equation 7.3.

7.1 Tag and Probe Calibration of the Soft Muon Tagger
7.1.1 Collision data and Monte Carlo samples
The data included in the calibration of the SMT represents 20.3 fb1 of LHC Run 1 collisions.
This included events which passed a numerous triggers, but the largest fraction are provided
by the EF mu6 Trk JPsi loose trigger. This trigger selects events which have at least one muon
with a momentum greater than 6 GeV and an ID track which combines with the muon to produce
an invariant mass in the window of 2.6 GeV < minv < 3.6 GeV, around the J/ mass. Two MC
J/  samples are used with generator-level criteria to require that the two relevant muons
had total momentum greater than 2.5 GeV and 4.0 GeV respectively.
7.1.2 Selection
The Tag and Probe selections are listed in this section. The criteria are divided into sections for
each object type. Kinematic requirements are always applied on measurements made in the ID
as it has better resolution than the MS, and all tracks must initially satisfy a set of requirements
recommended by the Muon Combined Performance (MCP) [81] group to ensure quality criteria
are met, as described in Section 6.2.3.
The Tag selection is detailed in the points below. The first four requirements focus on signal
selection, whilst the remaining two are to reduce the contamination from pile-up and decay-
in-flight hadrons. The last two requirements are selections on the impact parameters and their
resolutions, where d0 is the distance in the x y plane between the primary vertex and the start
of the track, and z0 is the equivalent shift along the z-axis. The Probe and MuonProbe selections
are then detailed, before the criteria required to pair a Tag and a Probe muon. The pairing
requirements are designed to identify objects which could come from a J/ decay, however
overlap requirements are enforced to reduce the possibility of the same track pairing with itself
due to misreconstruction. To improve the reconstruction efficiency, each Tag is permitted to pair
with several Probe tracks. This introduces more combinatoric pairings than allowing only the
nearest Probe in z0, however these are removed along with other backgrounds by fitting within
an invariant mass window, as will be described in Section 7.2. This technique retains higher
statistics of correct Tag and Probe pairs than could otherwise be achieved. Finally, the SMT
requirements are detailed at the end. These SMT requirements are the tagger specific criteria
as used in an analysis setting, however as the calibration is performed on isolated muons any

The momentum imbalance requirement in the SMT selection is defined as the difference
in the total momentum of a track measured in the ID (pID), and a track measured in the MS
extrapolated back to the ID (pME), as a fraction of the total momentum of the track measured
in the ID. This is shown in Equation 7.4, and the calibration working point is chosen to be MI

7.2 Invariant mass fitting and background subtraction
It is possible for non-J/ pairs of muons or other tracks to satisfy the selection and enter into
the calibration sample. This includes a combinatoric background of wrong Tag and Probe pair-
ings, and also a continuous Drell-Yan (qq /Z  `+` distribution. It is important to re-
move these contributions to measure the efficiency of the tagger correctly. The distribution of
7.2 Invariant mass fitting and background subtraction Calibration of the Soft Muon Tagger
the invariant mass of Tag and Probe pairs shows a peak around the invariant mass of the J/,
mJ/ = 3.097 GeV, with shoulders either side indicating the distribution of the background and
combinatoric pairings. A sideband fit may be performed for the underlying background distri-
bution and also a fit for the combined background+signal. This allows for the extraction of the
number of background pairings and their subsequent subtraction. The background distribution
is fit with a quadratic polynomial, and the integral under the fit is subtracted from the total of
the binned data. This remaining data is used as the signal, rather than relying on an accurate fit
of the signal peak. However, to extract the width of the signal peak, used in the determination
of the overall uncertainties described in Section 7.2.1, a Gaussian fit is applied in tandem to
the signal peak region in order to extract the width of the function. An illustrative example is
given in Figure 7.2, and the real fit is performed automatically for every bin in the (, pT ) range
considered, an example of which is shown in Figure 7.3 and the full results of which are shown
in Figure 7.4- 7.11. The invariant mass range between 2.73.5 GeV is utilised, and for each fit
the mean is not constrained although it is expected to be close to mJ/. The actual background
subtraction is applied in the region of 3 around the mean. For the Tag and Probe pairs, the
remaining events after subtraction are used as the denominator of Equation 7.1. For Tag and
MuonProbe pairs, the remaining events after subtraction are used the numerator of Equation 7.1
and the denominator of Equation 7.2.
7.2.1 Uncertainty measurement
The uncertainty assigned to the measured efficiencies consists of multiple components. The
total is the quadratic combination of a binomial statistical uncertainty, stat., and two systematic
uncertainties based on the fit; the first is the difference in efficiency as measured for a 3 and
5 range around the distribution mean sig, the second is the difference between maximal and
minimal background estimations from variation of the fit polynomial bkg.
The statistical uncertainty is the binomial error, for efficiency  out of total pairings N.
stat. =

. (7.5)
The first systematic uncertainty relating to the fit is obtained by comparing the measured
efficiencies according to the 3 and 5 windows around the mean, labelled 3 and 5. The
mean and widths are determined by the Gaussian fit to the signal peak. The central value used

The second systematic uncertainty relating to the fit is obtained by varying the polynomial
function used in the background estimation. The nominal function takes the form
f (x) = ax2 +bx+ c . (7.7)
Alternate maximal and minimal functions are created by varying each parameter away
from their central values by the uncertainties determined by the fit. This produces the upper and
lower variations as shown in Figure 7.2 following the functions

7.3 Efficiencies
The Data/MC SFs for the SMT efficiencies are dependent on kinematic and spatial variables. A
key factor is the behaviour of the SFs as a function of isolation of the muons. If an isolation
dependency exists then it would indicate that the calibration technique is unsuitable for a tagger
required to function correctly in a jet environment. Dependency on the  and the pT of the
tracks is found, as in Figures 7.10 and 7.11. No overall asymmetry is observed with regards
to the positive and negative pseudorapidity regions of the detector however there is a small
deviation in the efficiency as a function of the Probe muon charge. The scale factors are therefore
determined separately for positive and negative muons. An example in data of the invariant
mass construction and fitting distributions is shown in Figure 7.3, the sharp shoulders on the

of the SFs on kinematic and spatial variables, and are presented as a function of pT for all
five detector regions (detailed in Table 7.1) in both sides A and C, separated by probe charge.
Figures 7.4 and 7.5 indicate that the tagger is not sensitive to the isolation of the muons and
therefore is suitable for use in a jet environment. The first isolation variable, EconeRT (etcone)
describes the sum of the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter cells around the fitted
muon track, within a cone of size R. The second variable, pconeRT (ptcone) describes the sum
of the transverse momentum of the tracks around the muon track within a cone of size R and
the third variable NconeRtrk (nucone) describes the number of tracks around the muon track with
within a cone of size R. All isolation variables refer to the level of activity surrounding the
muon. The SFs resulting from this study are all extremely close to 1.0 with uncertainties ranging
from 0.5% to 15% depending on the pT and  bin, although the vast majority are not larger than
2%. This shows good agreement between the performance of the SMT tagger on data and on
MC and that the soft muons are well modelled. The largest uncertainties in the SFs appear in
the crack, transition and forward regions. In the crack and transition regions the reconstruction
of tracks is hindered due to the lack of instrumentation, and the uncertainties tend to increase
towards high pT (for all -regions) due to the lack of available statistics. Lack of statistics is
also the cause of the larger uncertainties in the forward region. The bulk of the data used in an
8 TeV analysis is in the barrel and endcap regions, with a peak in the pT spectrum of the soft
muon around 510 GeV, this is the region in which the data/MC agreement is the strongest.
The SFs resulting from this study are detailed in Tables 7.2a- 7.2d.
7.3.1 Z 
The J/ analysis is performed to calibrate the tagger for low-pT muons. However to calibrate in
the medium- and high-pT regions more statistics may be gained from using Z  events. The

procedure for obtaining the SMT efficiency and SFs is identical to the J/ analysis, however
this is carried out by another student and therefore will not be looked at in detail in this thesis.
The important feature, shown in Figure 7.13 is that the two calibration methods agree within
uncertainties for the SFs derived in the overlapping pT region. In the 15 20 GeV region the
SFs from the Z   method are to be used for analyses as these have the smaller overall
uncertainty.
7.4 Fake rate
The fake (or mistag) rate is defined as the fraction of light-flavour (LF) jets be tagged by the
SMT. Mistags occur when LF jets mimic the signals of HF jets, in the case of the SMT this can
include the decay-in-flight of LF hadrons such as s, Ks and J/s which produce signal-like
muons. It can also include instrumental effects such as punch-through of hadrons into the MS,
and nuclear interactions of hard jets with the calorimeter material which can produce high-pT
muon tracks. The mistag rate is measured by another student and will not be discussed in detail
here. It is studied as a function of jet pT , pile-up, and spatial variables, and the data/MC SFs
are found to be consistent within uncertainties. A low-pT method is devised using a W+jets
estimation, and a high-pT method used dijet samples.The W+jets method is required in order to
make up for low-statistics in the dijet method at low-pT . The results, binned bt pT , are shown in
Table 7.3.

Event selection
This section describes the MC samples used for the analysis, and the critera applied to MC
and to data to identify tt `+jets decays and reject the other processes with the highest purity
possible. The nominal selection, in Section 8.2.3 is prescribed by the ATLAS top quark group.
The background estimations (Section 8.3), for the MC simulated processes, and the data-driven
W+jets and multijet processes, are performed by a colleague at QMUL, as well as the derivation
of the relevant event weights. The optimisation of the selection to improve the purity for this
analysis is performed jointly between myself and a colleague and is described in Section 8.2.4.
8.1 Collision data and simulated samples
The collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector which are used in this analysis amount to
20.3 fb1 of Run 1 data at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV. Events needed to satisfy
requirements set by the ATLAS GoodRunList (GRL) which defines quality thresholds, accord-
ing to the detector functionality and running conditions. The MC samples, used to simulate the
signal and background physics processes, are detailed as follows:
 tt (nominal) - POWHEG generator [65] interfaced to PYTHIA6 [68] for parton shower
modelling
 tt (PDF systematic) - MC@NLO generator [66], interfaced to HERWIG++ [67] for parton
shower modelling

 tt (ISR/FSR systematic) - POWHEG generator [65] interfaced to PYTHIA6 [68] for par-

both interfaced to HERWIG++ [67] for parton shower modelling
 tt (Parton shower systematic) - POWHEG generator [65] interfaced to PYTHIA6 [68] and
HERWIG++ [67] for parton shower modelling
 Single-top (background) - POWHEG generator [65] interfaced to PYTHIA6 [68] for par-
ton shower modelling
 Four samples are required: t-channel top, t-channel anti-top s-channel and Wt-
channel
 W+jets (background) - ALPGEN generator [71] interfaced to PYTHIA6 [68] for parton
shower modelling
 Parton flavour specific samples with additional objects are generated separately. A
heavy flavour overlap removal (HFOR) procedure is required to avoid double count-
ing events which satisfy multiple categories in the following:
 LF partons with 0-5 additional partons
 cc with 0-3 additional partons
 bb with 0-3 additional partons
 c with 0-4 additional partons

shower modelling

elling
8.1 Collision data and simulated samples Event selection
The samples used are all standard samples within the ATLAS top quark group. The majority
use the full ATLAS detector simulation of GEANT4 [72] however several systematic tt samples
instead utilise ATLFAST2 [7375] fast simulation. To simulate pile-up, all samples are over-
laid with PYTHIA8 [88] minimum bias events, and all events are reweighted to normalise the
average pile-up density <  > (the average number of pile-up interactions per bunch crossing)
to that which is measured in data, as in Figure 5.4. Finally, it must be noted that the b-hadron
production fractions and the b  decay branching ratios as implemented in the existing ver-
sions of PYTHIA6 and HERWIG++ are not in agreement with those specified in the Review of
Particle Physics (RPP) [41] and calculated by the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group (HFAG) [89].
It is necessary to apply a re-weighting scheme to correct for this as these branching ratios are
crucial to the measurement. An associated systematic uncertainty is introduced as a result of the
reweighting procedure. Table 8.1 details the b-hadron production fractions as listed in the RPP
and as implemented in PYTHIA6 and HERWIG++. Table 8.2 is an equivalent comparison of
the b  branching ratios.

8.2 Object identification and event selection
8.2.1 Trigger selection
The lowest unprescaled single electron trigger (EF e24vhi medium1) is used to identify electron
objects, which is a trigger chain implemented in stages from the Level 1 trigger (L1) to the
event filter (EF). This utilises a pT > 24 GeV criterion and a dead material correction. It is
known to produce inefficiencies on selecting very high energy (Et > 200 GeV) electrons and
so is combined with a logical OR with a second trigger (EF e60 medium1) which has looser
requirements for higher energy objects. The EF e24vhi medium1 trigger applies a loose track
isolation requirement of
pcone20T
> 0.1 to reduce the effects of multijet backgrounds. Single
muon triggers (EF mu24i tight, EF mu36 tight) are combined (logical OR) to identify muon
signals. They utilise pT thresholds of 24 GeV and 36 GeV respectively and the second trigger
has in addition an isolation requirement of
p0.2T
< 0.12.
8.2.2 Offline selection
All selection criteria below follow the recommendations of the ATLAS top quark group for
a Run 1 tt `+jets analysis, unless otherwise specified. Departures from the recommendations
beneficial specifically to this analysis include the use of multiple b-tagging algorithms and the
omission of missing transverse energy (EmissT ) and W -boson transverse mass (m
T ) requirements,
detailed in the following sections. The offline selection is applied to MC and to data.
Electrons
Electron objects (associated with the decays of W bosons in this analysis) are required to satisfy
a tight++ offline identification criteria. Detailed descriptions of the loose, medium, tight and
tight++ criterion may be found in [77] and in Appendix C. The overarching electron require-
ments are as follows:
 pT > 25 GeV
 |cluster|> 2.47 (detector acceptance)
8.2 Object identification and event selection Event selection
 1.37 < |cluster|< 1.52 excluded, due to poor instrumentation in the barrel and end-cap
calorimeter transition regions.
 Econe20T isolation requirements to reduce the multijet background, tuned as a function of
Et and cluster to maintain a uniform 90% efficiency.
 pcone30T isolation requirements to reduce the multijet background, tuned as a function of Et
and cluster to maintain a uniform 90% efficiency.
where cluster refers to the energy deposits in the ECAL reconstructed as electrons. The isolation
requirements are functions of ET and cluster such as to maintain a uniform 90% electron selec-
tion efficiency. In addition, a procedure known as overlap removal is used to prevent the double
counting of energy clusters as both electrons and jets. Jets within a cone of R < 0.2 of recon-
structed electrons are removed, and for surviving jets within a cone of R < 0.4 of electrons, the
electrons are instead discarded, to suppress semileptonic b e decays.
Muons
Muon objects (associated with the decays of W -bosons in this analysis, as distinct from the
soft-muons described in Section 7) are required to satisfy the reconstruction criteria for MUID
combined muons (see Section 6.2.3). The overarching muon requirements are as follows:
 pT > 25 GeV
 ||< 2.5 (detector acceptance)
 Satisfy MCP requirements as detailed in Section 7.1.2
 Econe20T < 4 GeV isolation requirements in both the ID and ECAL/HCAL
 pcone30T < 2.5 GeV isolation requirements in both the ID and ECAL/HCAL
In addition, overlap removal is again utilised to reduce contamination from punch-through
and from heavy flavour parton to muon decays inside of jets. Muons within a cone of R < 0.4
from the nearest jet are discarded.
8.2 Object identification and event selection Event selection
The reconstruction of jets is performed using the anti-kt [83] clustering algorithm (see Sec-
tion 6.2.4) with a cone radius of R = 0.4. Jet reconstructions begins with topological clusters,
which are then corrected for pile-up effects and calibrated using a pT and  dependent scheme
for the jet energy scale (JES). The overarching jet requirements are as follows:
 pT > 25 GeV
 ||< 2.5 (detector acceptance)
 |JVF|> 0.5 for pT < 50 GeV jets, to reduce the effects of pile-up minimum bias interac-
tions
where JVF is the jet vertex fraction which is defined as the fraction of track momenta associated
with the jet, to also be associated with the PV
JVF =
 pT ofjettracksfromPV
 pT ofjettracks
. (8.1)
b-tagging
b-tagging is a process by which an attempt is made to identify heavy flavour jets which contain
b-hadron decays as distinct from jets which contain only light-flavour (LF) hadron decays. It is
critical for this analysis to identify b-jets which contain soft-muons using the SMT algorithm as
described in Section 7. A more common tagging algorithm (MV1 [86]), based on a multivariate
analysis of the track parameters in jets to identify secondary vertices related to b-hadron decays
(see Section 6.2.5), is regularly used for b-tagging at the ATLAS experiment. The MV1 tagger
works on orthogonal variables to the SMT algorithm and has an independent efficiency and fake
rate. In Section 8.2.4 the potential to combine the SMT and MV1 taggers in a logical AND
to tag b-jets is explored. Following the optimisation below, this analysis requires at least one
b-tagged jet per event, required to satisfy both the SMT (Section 7) and MV1 (Section 6.2.5)
tagging criteria.
8.2 Object identification and event selection Event selection
Missing transverse energy and W transverse mass
For events in which neutrinos escape the detector undetected, the vector sum of transverse mo-
mentum in the event will be non-zero and yield a measurement of the missing energy, EmissT . A
related parameter, the transverse mass of the W boson mWT , is also considered. The transverse
mass is defined as
mWT =
2plT p
T (1 cos(l)), (8.2)
where pT and 
 are calculated assuming they are the components of the EmissT 4-vector. ATLAS
top-quark analyses usually utilise the following (nominal) requirements:
 |EmissT |< 4.9
 EmissT > 30 GeV and m
T > 30 GeV for the e+jets channel
 EmissT > 20 GeV and
EmissT +m
> 60 GeV for the +jets channel
However it will be shown in Section 8.2.4 that for this analysis an improved signal purity may
be achieved by neglecting any selection requirements based on these variables.
8.2.3 Event selection
The nominal event selection for this analysis is as follows:
 Only one hard electron OR muon, with a veto on any second hard lepton (to avoid dilepton
events)
  4 jets
  1 b-tagged jet, tagged by both the SMT and MV1@85% algorithms (justified in Sec-
tion 8.2.4)
 For +jets events, the muon identified as originating from the W -boson decay must not be
the same object as the muon utilised in the SMT algorithm (R(,SMT )> 0.01)
 No requirements based on EmissT or m
T (justified in Section 8.2.4)
where a hard lepton is defined as one passing the pT > 25 GeV requirement.
8.2 Object identification and event selection Event selection
8.2.4 Optimisation
The event selection is optimised in order to maximise the signal purity in the final data sample, to
reduce the uncertainties on the final results. However, optimisation of selection to maximise the
purity should not be permitted to reduce too heavily the efficiency of the selection, as this would
lead to a large statistical uncertainty. This analysis is expected to be limited by its statistical
uncertainty. The following metrics are considered (where S,B denote the number of signal and
background events respectively after a selection is performed):
 Signal significance (maximise): S/
 Background fraction (minimise): B/(S+B)
 Proxy for statistical uncertainty (minimise): 1/
The background events include tt contributions from fake SMT muons (referred to as tt
backgrounds), alongside the non-tt events documented in Section 8.3. The tt background events
include dilepton events, and muons from initial or final state radiation, decay-in-flight of LF
hadrons, and pile-up. These types of events are abbreviated as tt mis-ID from hereon. Although
the fake rate for the SMT algorithm is extremely small, the low efficiency due to the 21% b 
branching ratio results in fake SMT muons still contributing a considerable background. The
breakdown of the tt backgrounds (from fake SMT muons) after the optimised selection is given
in Section 10.2.1.
In order to focus on reducing the fake SMT muon contributions specifically, combinations
of the SMT tagger with the MV1 tagger are considered. It is found, as detailed in Tables 8.3-
8.9 that the combination of taggers results in a more powerful rejection of background events
than either tagger individually. In order to retain high statistics multiple working points of the
MV1 tagger are considered, where each working point represents the efficiency of the tagger
for a specific calibration (the price for higher efficiency being a lower purity). Alternate MV1
algorithms with enhanced c-jet rejection (MV1c [86]) are tested as well, and in addition, for
each tagging combination, statistics are recuperated by removal both the nominal EmissT and m
requirements.
Tables 8.3- 8.9 detail the 12 event selections considered with the resultant event yields and
performance. These tables also detail the performance as a function of same-top (ST) and
8.2 Object identification and event selection Event selection
different-top (DT) muons within tt, as discussed in Section 4. Events labelled tt same- and
diff-top contain two SMT muons from different jets, and enter the event yields twice. In all
cases the signal significance is found to improve after removing both the nominal EmissT and
mWT requirements, and larger statistics overall, although the price is a slightly larger background
fraction. While the SMT-only tagging selection yields a high signal significance, the large back-
ground fraction is notable. This is alleviated applying the MV1 tagging algorithm subsequent to
the SMT, and the highest signal significance is found for the combination of SMT+MV1@85%.
This combination has a larger background fraction than the other combined tagging options,
but it is still much lower than the SMT-only background fraction. The MV1c algorithms yield
minimal notable difference to the original MV1 results.

The b-jet criterion requires a good SMT muon be found within R < 0.5 of the jet axis. The
SMT muon must have a b-hadron with a pT > 5 GeV found in its MC production chain, and
this b-hadron must also fall within R < 0.5 of the associated jet, and originate from a top-quark
decay.
8.3 Background estimation
The background estimations described in this chapter are performed by a colleague working on
the analysis. I have involvement in some initial studies for the W+jets data driven background
estimation, but not in the production the code framework or performance of the final estimation.
There are several other physics signatures which either share a final state with the `+jets tt
decay or have a very similar final state which may satisfy the same selection. Single leptons,
multiple jets (with one or more b-tagged jets) and missing momentum are common signatures
in a number of decays from pp collisions, referred to hereon as backgrounds if they are not
from the signal decay mode. The primary backgrounds for this particular signature are: W+jets,

Z+jets, diboson, single-top and multijet (QCD). Several of the backgrounds (multijet, Z+jets, di-
boson) are produced charge symmetrically, and with the charges of the charged-lepton (from the
W -boson decay) and the soft-muon uncorrelated, these backgrounds should contribute flat dis-
tributions to the charge asymmetries (CA). Other backgrounds (W+jets, single-top) have some
elements of charge asymmetric production and correlation between the aforementioned lepton
charges, these backgrounds will likely contribute non-flat distributions to the CAs and must be
estimated with care. Figure 8.1 shows example Feynman diagrams for each background chan-
nel, with labels to identify production charge (a)symmetries and lepton charge correlations in
each case.
Each background, other than W+jets and multijets which will be discussed separately, is
well-modelled and accounted for using MC simulations. Diboson (WW , WZ, ZZ) events may
satisfy the selection as they contain real leptons, missing momentum (from neutrinos or unde-
tected other leptons), and jets (either b-tagged heavy-flavour (HF) or mistagged light-flavour
(LF)). Diboson WW and ZZ events are produced charge symmetrically, however WZ events are
produced charge asymmetrically, due to the quark anti-quark content of the protons (uud) gen-

and one anti-d sea quark) compared to W-boson production (using only one possible d valence
quark and one anti-u sea quark). The charge of the soft muon and charged lepton are uncor-
related, for WW events either W -boson may decay leptonically or hadronically, and either jet
from the hadronic decay may be tagged, for ZZ events either lepton may be reconstructed as the
charged lepton, and either jet may be tagged, for WZ events, either boson may decay leptonically
or hadronically and in the hadronic case either jet may be tagged.
Single-top events are able to satisfy the event selection requirements as they contain a real
charged-lepton, missing momentum and a b-jets from the top-quark decay. This can coincide
with other HF or LF jets and provide all of the signatures of a tt decay. The production charge
for single-top events is asymmetric due to the asymmetric production of W -bosons from the
quark content of the protons. In the first diagram of Figure 8.1, assuming the charged lepton
and the SMT muon both originate from the decay products of the top quark, the two leptons will
be correlated in charge. In the second and third diagram, either b-jet could be tagged and the
lepton and soft muon charged become uncorrelated. In the Wt diagram, the charges are again

Z+jets decays can result in leptons (charged or neutral) coincident with HF or LF jets. For
the case of two charged leptons (Z  `+`), one lepton may fail to be reconstructed due to
detector inefficiencies (such as the crack region or dead pixels) or fall outside of the selection
acceptance, this would give the signature of missing momentum. For the case of two neutral

leptons (Z ), one of the additional jets may fake the signature of a real electron in the ECAL,
or a real muon (if punch-through occurs beyond the HCAL). Additionally, Z  decays may
result in a real lepton and neutrino from a leptonic  decay, and jets from the other  decay.
Z+jets events contain multiple charged leptons and jets, either lepton could be reconstructed as
the charge lepton and numerous jets could pass the tagging requirements, so the SMT muon and
charged lepton are uncorrelated.
Multijet events contain numerous LF and HF jets which may satisfy the b-tagging require-
ments. It is possible for jets to be misidentified as leptons, or to contain real electrons or muons
through photon conversions and semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour quarks which may then be
reconstructed and satisfy the lepton selection requirements. Missing momentum is also required,
this could be present in multijet events due to misreconstruction. Pile-up, the crack-region,
malfunctioning calorimeter cells and object misidentification may all contribute to a missing
momentum signature. The cross-section for multijet events is extremely large, and as such con-
stitutes a considerable background even though the probability of object mis-reconstruction is
small. Data driven methods are utilised instead of MC simulations to estimate the multijet back-

grounds, this is because our knowledge of QCD processes is not sufficient to accurately predict
multijet final states, especially towards lower pT regions. Numerous jets in a multijet events
may fake a lepton (or produce a real charged lepton) or pass the SMT tagging requirements, so
the charged lepton and SMT charges are uncorrelated.
W+jets events can produce real charged-lepton and neutrino pairs in association with multi-
ple LF or HF jets. A data-driven method is utilised for estimating this background, described in
Section 8.4 below. In tt analyses, W+jets is often the most prevalent background due to its large
production cross-section and the presence of real charged-leptons, b-jets and missing momen-
tum. The Wc production mode gives correlation to the charged lepton (from the W -boson decay)
and soft muon (from c ) which comes directly from the correlation of the initial charges of
the W -boson and c-quark. The second diagram in Figure 8.1 provides numerous jets which may
pass the b-tagging requirements and the charges become uncorrelated.
8.4 W+jets data-driven estimation
There is significant uncertainty on the overall normalisation of the W+jets background and on
the quark-flavour of the jets (knowledge of this is required to accurately predict tagging rates),
as such W+jets MC simulations may not be reliable. Data-driven methods are instead utilised
to estimate the W+jets background, utilising the ratio of W+ to W, as the ratio of the cross-
sections is known better than either cross-section individually. The primary method used is
known as W charge asymmetry [90], it relies on pp collisions yielding a non-unitary ratio of
positive to negative W -bosons. As stated above, this asymmetry stems from the quark anti-
quark content of the protons (uud) generating a larger production cross-section for W+ bosons
(using two possible u valence quarks and one anti-d sea quark) compared to W bosons (using
only one possible d valence quarks and one anti-u sea quark). The uncertainty on the ratio of
cross-sections
is smaller than the uncertainty on either individual cross-section [90]. The
ratio may be used to attain the correct normalisation for the number of asymmetric events in
data, using Equation 8.4,

and rMC is the ratio of interest. A scale factor may be defined as
fCA =

This method utilises the ratio rMC to correct the W+jets charge asymmetry in MC to that in the
data. It uses the same cuts as the primary analysis (in pT , , isolation etc) but further subdivides
the samples into events containing positively or negative charged leptons and different jet mul-
tiplicities. It relies on the only source of asymmetry present in the data being W -boson events.
For this assumption to be true it is first necessary to subtract from data the estimations of the
diboson and single-top backgrounds. All other backgrounds are found to be charge-symmetric,
as shown in Tables 8.10- 8.11.

the total number of positive and negative W+jets events in data (after background subtraction),
DW , and the requirement for i Ki = 1. The system can be solved if the assumption is made
that Kbb = Kcb to reduce to three unknown parameters.

The system is then solved using an iterative approach, applying the scaling factors Ki to the

scale factors are stable.
8.4 W+jets data-driven estimation Event selection
The combination of these data-driven methods provides the total estimation for the W+jets
background. To reduce uncertainties, the estimations are calculated in the high-statistics 1-
lepton and 2-jet exclusive bin and then extrapolated to the analysis region of 1-lepton and 
4 jets inclusive region using MC. In order to reduce the overall uncertainty further, the data-
driven estimate is recalculated for every systematic variation considered in this analysis. This
estimation is therefore performed approximately 350 times per channel. Only the statistical
component of the W+jets estimate is considered separately, the magnitude of which may been
seen in Tables 12.1-12.7 in Section 12.
8.4.1 b-Tagging combinations
Further justification for the combination of the SMT and MV1 b-tagging algorithms may be
found by exploring the uncertainties on the W+jets estimations for the MV1, SMT and combined
MV1+SMT b-tagging algorithms in turn. The uncertainties on the scale factors are shown in
Table 8.12 for each b-tagging option. The combination of the taggers leads to an overall smaller
uncertainty on the scale factors Kbb,cc and KLF , although there is an increase for Kc. However,
the reduction in the uncertainty on Kbb,cc is greater than the increase for Kc, this is a secondary
motivation (to the selection purity) for combining the taggers.

the extrapolation from the 2-jet exclusive to the 4-jet inclusive region, however the 3- and 4-jet
exclusive jet multiplicity regions are used as control regions in order to understand and monitor
the extrapolation. Other studies [91] have shown that this technique provides the lowest overall
uncertainty and is stable against systematic variations.

8.5 Multijet data-driven estimation
A technique known as the matrix method is used to estimate the contribution from the multijet
background in both the electron and muon channels, this is also known as the fake lepton
background as it requires a jet to fake the signal of a hard lepton (as described earlier) to pass
the event selection. In the electron and muons channels, the loose lepton definitions are used
(Section 6) without any isolation requirements, and events in data are separated by whether they
pass the standard tight++ lepton selections (Ntight++) or only the loose lepton selections (Nloose).
8.6 Control plots Event selection
The total number of events will contain contributions from both real leptons and fakes,
Ntight++ = rNloosereal + f N
loose
fake , (8.12)
Nloose = Nloosereal +N
loose
fake , (8.13)
where r, f are the fractions of the real and fake events which satisfy the loose criteria to also
satisfy the tight++ criteria. With knowledge of r, f the number of events with fake leptons to
enter into the data may be calculated as
Ntight++fake = f N
loose
fake = f
Ntight++ rNloose
f  r
. (8.14)
The relative fraction for real electrons (muons) is measured in an inclusive sample of Z ee
(Z ) decays. The relative fractions for fake leptons are measured in data samples dominated
by non-prompt and fake lepton backgrounds. For fake electrons, f is measured using a sample
with the transverse mass of the W -boson, MWT < 20 GeV and the sum of the missing trans-
verse energy and the transverse mass of the W -boson EmissT +M
T < 60 GeV. For fake muons,
f is measured in a sample with the muon impact parameter significance dsig0 = d0/(d0) > 5,
therefore giving tracks unlikely to be associated with the primary decay process.A conservative
uncertainty of 50% is applied to both of the fraction estimates and propagated through to the
pretag multijet uncertainty. Additional uncertainties that derive from the data driven method
relate to uncertainty on the number of real leptons subtracted from the data samples used for
the f -estimates (a 10% systematic), and alternate measurements of the real and fake fractions
using different samples or control regions.
8.6 Control plots
This section contains control plots to analyse the data-MC agreement in different kinematic dis-
tributions. All predictions are found to be in good agreement with the data within uncertainties.

Systematic Uncertainties
Systematics describe experimental or theoretical uncertainties which may affect the normalisa-
tion or shapes of distributions relevant to the measurement of a particular analysis. The system-
atics relevant to this analysis are described below. I provide only an overview of each systematic
as I have no involvement in the implementation of this part of the analysis. The impact of all
systematics decribed here, on the tt cross-section and the asymmetry measurements, is discussed
in the results in Section 12.
9.1 Experimental uncertainties
Experimental systematic uncertainties describe those which relate to the mismeasurements of
the properties of analysis objects. Uncertainties related to the hard lepton, the four jets, the SMT
muon and the b-tagging procedure are all considered. In the charge and CP asymmetry (CA,
CPA) measurements, many systematic uncertainties will be reduced due to the ratios of events
cancelling out these effects to first order. This ratio also, as described in Section 4.1.1, removes
the dependency of the analysis on experimental effects which might result in different numbers
of reconstructed leptons from W -bosons. The systematics will not be reduced in this way for the
cross-section measurement presented in Section 12.1, as will be seen in a quantitative way in the
results of Tables 12.1, 12.3 and 12.7.
9.1 Experimental uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
9.1.1 Lepton reconstruction, identification and trigger
The reconstruction of leptons using the ATLAS detector may differ slightly between simulation
and data. Charged-dependent scale factors (SF) are derived using tag-and-probe analysis on Z-
boson and J/ to charged lepton decays to correct the simulation reconstruction efficiencies.
These SFs have uncertainties and the systematic contribution to this analysis is found by repeat-
ing the CA and CPA measurements after varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
The electron reconstruction efficiency at ATLAS [93] varies from 97 99% depending on the
 region and the transverse energy of the electron. The uncertainty on the reconstruction effi-
ciency varies from 0.55.0%, where the lower value is measured in high-statistics high-energy
(ET > 35 GeV) Z e+e decays, and the larger value is a conservative uncertainty assigned to
the region of electron ET < 15 GeV where MC simulations are used due to the lack of available
statistics. The electron identification efficiency, for the tight electron definition, is found to be
 6595% depending on the electron ET and . The uncertainty on the electron identification
efficiency is of the order 0.5% for central electrons with high ET , and 10% for electrons with
low ET in the transition regions of the detector. The combined reconstruction and identification
efficiencies for electrons, ranging from 65 95%, alongside the total statistical and systematic
uncertainties and the Data/MC SFs, are shown in Figure 9.1 [93]. For muons the reconstruction
efficiency is measured to be above 99% for the region of ||< 2.7 and 5 pT  100 GeV, with
an uncertainty of  0.1%, as shown in Figure 9.2 [93] alongside the Data/MC SFs.
9.1.2 Lepton energy scale and resolution
The resolution of the lepton energy may differ slightly between simulation and data. Z-boson to
charged lepton decays are again utilised to provide SFs to correct the simulation distributions to
those in the data. The SFs have uncertainties and their systematic contribution to this analysis is
found by repeating the CA and CPA measurements after varying the SFs up and down by their
uncertainties. For electrons, the energy resolution is ET dependent but averages around 10%,
with an uncertainty of less than 10% for ET < 50 GeV, and 40% for ET  500 GeV [94]. For
muons, the momentum resolution varies from 1.7% in the central  region at pT  10 GeV, to
4% in the largest rapidity region at pT  100 GeV [94].

 for different cut-based selections in data, compared to MC simulations. The lower panel shows the
Data/MC SFs.

niques, CB = Combined, ST = Segment-Tagged. The lower panel shows the Data/MC SFs.
9.1.3 Lepton charge misidentification
Lepton charge misidentification at ATLAS is considered negligible in the muon channel due
to the low bremsstrahlung of muons within the detector and the larger number of ID and MS
9.1 Experimental uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
hits each one creates, increasing the performance of track reconstruction algorithms. Charge
misidentification in the electron channel must however be considered as it is non-negligible at
ATLAS. Electrons which undergo bremsstrahlung will emit photons which may pair-produce.
One of the subsequent positrons may be reconstructed instead of the original electron and this
can lead to charge misidentification. This is more likely to occur towards higher values of pseu-
dorapidity as the electrons must traverse a greater number of interaction lengths in the detector
material. Moreover, high energy electrons will produce increasingly straight tracks which may
be harder to accurately reconstruct than their muon equivalents which benefit from additional
MS hits. Figure 9.3 [93] shows the electron charge misidentification probability as a function of
pseudorapidity at the ATLAS detector, which varies from 010% over the range 0 < ||< 2.5.
Only a small number of electrons selected in this analysis will be in the largest pseudorapidity
region where poor performance occurs. SFs are produced to correct the charge misidentification
of simulation to that in data, using Z  e+e tag-and-probe techniques [93]. These SFs have
uncertainties and the systematic contribution to this analysis is found by repeating the CA and
CPA measurements after varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
9.1.4 Jet energy scale (JES)
The energy measurement of jets is dependent on a number of different experimental issues, for
example the definition of jet clusters using the anti-kT algorithm will alter the number of particles
associated with each jet and the overall jet energy and angular properties. Modelling of pile-up,
additional radiation and detector response must also be accounted for. Additional sources of JES
uncertainty are -calibration, jet flavour composition and mismodelling due to the measurement
of high-pT single hadrons. Each source of JES uncertainty requires SFs to correct the simulation
to measurements in data. These SFs have uncertainties and the systematic contribution to this
analysis is found by repeating the CA and CPA measurements after varying the SFs up and
down by their uncertainties. As shown in Figure 9.4 the uncertainty in the measured jet energy
at ATLAS is 4% in the region of 17< pT < 25 GeV and 13% for jets with 35< pT < 210 GeV,
for jets at the most central region of ||= 0.0. Figure 9.5 shows the uncertainty as a function of
 for jets with pT = 40 GeV, where the uncertainty ranges between 46%.
9.1 Experimental uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties

criteria, compared to MC simulations. The lower panel shows the Data/MC SFs.
9.1.5 Jet energy resolution (JER)
The jet energy resolution may differ slightly between simulation and data. The differences are
studied [95] as a function of pT and  and additional jet smearing is applied to the simulation to
account for this. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution at ATLAS is  20% in the region
of 20 < pT < 80 GeV.

||= 0.0. The total uncertainty (all components summed in quadrature) is shown as a filled blue region

pT = 40 GeV. The total uncertainty (all components summed in quadrature) is shown as a filled blue
region topped by a solid black line.
9.1 Experimental uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
9.1.6 Jet reconstruction efficiency
Slight differences may exist in the jet reconstruction efficiency between simulation and data.
Studies at ATLAS [95] have found the difference to be of the order 0.2% for pjetT < 30 GeV. To
account for this, 0.2% of jets in that transverse momentum region are randomly removed from
the nominal sample and the CA and CPA measurements are performed again.
9.1.7 Jet vertex fraction (JVF)
The jet vertex fraction requirements (Section 8.2.2) may be satisfied by a different fraction of
jets in simulation than in data. To account for this the in JVF efficiency is studied in simulation
and in data using Z+1-jet events enriched in hard-scatter jets or pile-up. The JVF requirement
in this analysis is altered by the magnitude of the measured differences between simulation and
data to evaluate the systematic uncertainty.
9.1.8 Flavour tagging uncertainty
This systematic uncertainty relates to the usage of the MV1 tagging algorithm for the identi-
fication of jets from b-hadron decays. The performance of this algorithm varies for b-jets and
c-jets, and the efficiencies for each as well as the mistag rate for light-flavour jets may differ in
simulation compared to data. SFs are required to correct the tagging rates, binned by pT and
. These SFs have uncertainties and the systematic contribution to this analysis is found by re-
peating the CP and CA measurements after varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
The calibration of the MV1 algorithm at ATLAS is performed using a combinatorial likelihood
approach using dilepton top-quark pair events [96]. An overview of the technique, built up as
described in [96] is as follows. After a kinematic selection to obtain tt dilepton events with a
high purity, all jets in each event are treated individually and to extract the b-tagging efficiency
b the fraction of jets selected by the tagger, ftagged is defined as
ftagged = fbb (1 fb) j, (9.1)
where fb is the fraction of b-jets in the sample, b is the b-jet tagging efficiency and  j is the
light-flavour jet efficiency. With this technique, ftagged is measured in data whilst fb and  j are
determined in simulation. Additional information may be utilised for two-jet events, as in tt
9.1 Experimental uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
dilepton decays, by expanding to a system of two equations which define the fraction of events
with one or two tagged jets, f1 tag or f2 tags as
f1 tag = 2 fbbb (1 b)+ fb j [ j (1 b)+(1  j)b]+
1 fbb fb j
2 j (1  j) (9.2)
f2 tags = fbb
b + fb j jb +
1 fbb fb j
j (9.3)
where fbb and fb j are the fractions of events in the sample with true bb and b j jet pairs. With
this technique, f1 tag and f2 tags may be measured in data, whilst utilising determinations of fbb,
fb j and  j from simulation to get a higher precision estimate of b. To expand on this approach
with two jets, a per-event likelihood function is defined as
L (pT 1, pT 2,1,2) =[ fbbPbb (pT 1, pT 2)Pb (1|pT 1)Pb (2|pT 2)
+ fb jPb j (pT 1, pT 2)Pb (1|pT 1)P j (2|pT 2)
+ f j jP j j (pT 1, pT 2)P j (1|pT 1)P j (2|pT 2)
+1 2]/2,
(9.4)
where fx are the usual jet flavour fractions, P f (|pT ) is the probability density function
(PDF) of the b-tagging discriminant i for jet i of flavour f and a given transverse momentum,
and P f1 f2 (pT 1, pT 2) is the two-dimensional PDF for two jets with flavours f1,2 and transverse
momenta pT 1,2. The b-tagging efficiency is then extracted as
b (pT ) =
. (9.5)
This technique, with expansion to events with 3 or more jets, it utilised to calculate the b-
tagging efficiency of the MV1 algorithm on MC and on data and provide SFs (with statistical
and systematic errors) to apply in analyses, as detailed in [96], and to identify the b-tagging
discriminant cuts required to define working points for particular efficiencies.
9.2 Modelling uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
9.1.9 SMT uncertainty
The efficiencies and fake rates discussed in Section 7 have associated uncertainties. The sys-
tematic contribution to this analysis is found by repeating the CA and CPA measurements after
varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
9.1.10 Background uncertainties
In addition to the statistical uncertainties, the data-driven multijet background has additional
uncertainties deriving from the techniques used in its estimation. The cross-section of each of the
background estimates from MC simulations are varied up and down by their total uncertainties
and the CA and CPA measurements are re-performed in each case.
9.1.11 Luminosity
The uncertainty on the luminosity affects the measurement of the cross-section tt , as the lumi-
nosity directly appears in the denominator of the cross-section calculation
tt =
NdataNbkg
Ldt BR
. (9.6)
The uncertainty related to the integrated luminosity for the 8 TeV data set is 1.9% [97]. The
measured luminosity is varied up and down by its uncertainty to account for this effect. A shift
in the overall event yield will not affect the measured CA and CPAs.
9.1.12 Beam energy
The uncertainty on the LHC beam energy also affects the measurement of the cross-section tt .
The uncertainty related to the beam energy at the LHC for the 8 TeV data set is 1.7% [98]. The
beam energy is varied up and down by its uncertainty to account for this effect. A shift in the
overall event yield will not affect the measured CA and CPAs.
9.2 Modelling uncertainties
Modelling systematic uncertainties describe those which relate to the accuracy of the simula-
tion oh physics processes. Uncertainties related to particle production and decay rates, partons
9.2 Modelling uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
showering, hadronisation and similar effects are all considered. Many modelling systematic un-
certainties will be reduced due to the ratios of events in the CA and CPA calculations cancelling
out these effects to first order.
9.2.1 b-hadron production
SFs are required to correct the b-hadron production fractions in simulation to the world average
measurements listed in the RPP [41] (and detailed in Section 8) and each SF has an associated
uncertainty. The systematic contribution to this analysis is found by repeating the CA and CPA
measurements after varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
9.2.2 Hadron-to-muon branching ratios
The scale factors required to correct the b  branching ratios in simulation to the world average
measurements listed in the RPP (and detailed in Section 8) have associated uncertainties. The
systematic contribution to this analysis is found by repeating the CP and CA measurements after
varying the SFs up and down by their uncertainties.
9.2.3 Asymmetry of single-top production
In pp collisions a charge asymmetry exists in the production of single-top-quarks for the t- and
s-channels, due to the available valence quarks in proton-proton collisions. The proton valence
quarks are able to produce more W+-bosons than W-bosons in each case, resulting in more
W+ tb vertices than the charge conjugate. Differences in the asymmetry predicted in theory
and implemented in the simulation may exist. For this analysis, a conservative approach is taken
to account for any charge-related effects. The theoretical cross-sections for the t-channel and s-
channel are varied within their uncertainties, but with the additional consideration that a shift in
the total asymmetry may be caused by enhanced or reduced top or anti-top production separately.
Four systematics are considered for the t- and s-channels, where for each either the top or anti-
top production cross-section is varied individually to generate new CA and CPA measurements.
Tables 9.1- 9.3 detail the theoretical production cross-sections, and the systematic variations in
the t- and s-channels as described. In these tables,  and  represent shifts in the top or anti-top
cross section with the other held static.

9.2.4 Next-to-leading order (NLO) generator
The choice of event generator may produce a number of differences in the distributions consid-
ered in simulation and used for generation of response matrices during unfolding. To account for
this, an uncertainty is evaluated as the difference between two different generators (MC@NLO
and POWHEG, both interfaced with HERWIG++) in calculating the CA and CP asymmetries.
9.2.5 Parton shower and hadronisation
Analogously, the choice of model to describe the parton shower and hadronisation in the sim-
ulated samples will also generate different results. To account for this, an uncertainty is evalu-
ated as the difference between two different samples (POWHEG, interfaced with PYTHIA6 and
HERWIG++ separately) in calculating the CA and CP asymmetries.
9.2 Modelling uncertainties Systematic Uncertainties
9.2.6 Additional radiation
Mismodelling of the magnitude of initial- and final-state radiation in pp collisions produce the
largest variation in results for this analysis due to the presence of additional jets which affect
the performance of kinematic likelihood fitting (Section 10). Samples are generated using
POWHEG with additional and reduced radiation and the largest difference in measurements
of CA and CP asymmetries with respect to the nominal sample is taken as the total systematic
uncertainty.
9.2.7 Parton distribution function
The parton distribution function describes the fraction of energy carried by each parton inside of
the protons used in the LHC collisions. Following the prescription of PDF4LHC [102], three dif-
ferent PDF sets (CT10, MSTW2008, NNPDF2.3) are considered (using MC@NLO interfaced
with HERWIG++). The differences in the measured CA and CP asymmetries due to the choice
of PDF set are taken as systematic uncertainties on the final results.

Kinematic Fitting
To determine accurately the correct charge-pairings of soft muons and charged leptons from W -
boson decays, it is required to separate events into two categories; same-top (ST) and different-
top (DT). Events in which the two leptons both originate from the decay products of an individual
top quark are labelled ST, and event in which the two leptons originate from the decay products
of two different top quarks are labelled as DT. Any event classified as DT must have its charge
information altered before inclusion into the charge and CP asymmetry measurements, for ex-
ample an event with a positive charged lepton from the W -boson, l+, and a negative soft muon
from the b-quark, , would (with no ST/DT separation) enter into the bin yield N+. However,
once identified as a DT event, the first charge must be flipped to correctly reflect the charge of the
W -boson originating from the same-top decay as the soft-muon, N+N, as this is required
in the definition of the charge asymmetries. To achieve the ST/DT separation in this analysis,
kinematic fitting is employed as described in the sections below. The task is not to perfectly
rebuild the entire tt decay from the available analysis objects as is most commonly required of
kinematic fitters, but only to correctly assign the SMT-tagged jet to the correct top-quark decay
in the event.
10.1 Kinematic Likelihood Fitter
The Kinematic Likelihood Fitter (KLF) [103] is a standard ATLAS package using ROOT [104]
and MINUIT [105] from a Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT). It uses a maximum likelihood
method, as described below, to produce estimates of unknown parameters when presented with
10.1 Kinematic Likelihood Fitter Kinematic Fitting
data and a model decay channel. The goal of the fitter is two-fold; to find both the pairings
(matchings) between measured objects and those in the model, and to fit the measured properties
of those objects to reflect more realistic values with the knowledge of the expected true decay.
In many analyses the fitted parameters are used to perform further calculations (reconstruction
of top-quark mass for example), however the fitted parameters are not utilised for the CA and
CPA measurements.
10.1.1 Kinematic fitting
In the context of this analysis the goal is to ascertain the most likely pairings between recon-
structed objects and model particles for the decay. Given a single lepton and four jets, the task
is to find the most likely orientation of the jets to match to the known partons. It is possible
to build a likelihood function using the measured jet and lepton properties and constraints from
theory and from detector resolution.
Constraints
For the tt`+jets decays channel it is expected to measure four jets (two b-jets from the top-quark
decays, and two light-jets from a W -boson decay) and a charged lepton, and to expect missing
momentum due to a neutrino. This provides multiple opportunities to place constraints on the
system, such as on the invariant mass of the reconstructed parent particles. The first constraint
is provided by the probability to measure the value of the invariant mass of the two light jets
given a Breit-Wigner (BW) distribution for the known W -boson mass MW = 80.4 GeV of width
W = 2.1 GeV. A second similar requirement is put on the invariant mass ml built from the
lepton and missing energy. Other constraints may be created by reconstructing the invariant
masses of the top quarks on either side of the decay, via m j j j and ml j, given a BW of the top-
quark mass Mt = 172.5 GeV with a width of W = 1.5 GeV (from MC). This describes four
constraints for a likelihood calculation, which may provide some power in identifying the most
likely combination of jets for the decay topology. The BW distribution for measurements of a
mass m around an expected central mass M and width  is
BW (m|M) =
(m2M2)2 +2M2
. (10.1)
10.1 Kinematic Likelihood Fitter Kinematic Fitting
Transfer functions
The energies and angular properties of each the charged lepton and the jets will not be perfectly
measured, which may also be accounted for in the likelihood, for example a poorly measured jet
distribution could affect the likelihood to assign any particular jet to any particular parton. This
is considered by the use of a transfer function (TF). The TFs relate the input and the output of
the detector system. They utilise detector resolution information, binned in energy (E) and -
regions, to estimate potential shifts in measurements due to the detector response. TFs are used
to map the detector response (for example for jets) onto single particles from hard-scattering
processes. This is relevant for both the model quarks and leptons. It is possible to build trans-
fer functions (resolution functions) for a measured value in the ATLAS detector when given
some true value, according to the resolution of the detector, designed to account for imperfect
measurements of the energies E and angular properties i of the jets and leptons. The KLFit-
ter toolkit comes with transfer functions for E and  bins; W (Ei|Ei) and W (i|i). These are
derived using MC to calculate the relative deviations between truth particles and reconstructed
objects, including the effects of physical detector issues such as dead pixels, and also of recon-
struction algorithms. The TFs are asymmetric, as often the true energy of a particle is more than
is measured by the detector (Etruth > Emeasured) and therefore the resolution (
EtruthEmeasured
Etruth
not symmetric. The TFs are therefore built using double Gaussian functions of the form
W (E) =
2(p2 + p3 p5)
(E p1)
+ p3 exp
(E p4)
(10.2)
with E = EtruthEmeasuredEtruth and p1,...,5 parameters of the detector and reconstruction performance
and Etruth which are fit, as described in [103]. The TFs are binned in  due to variations in the
detector resolution and efficiency, specifically related to the calorimeter crack region.
Input parameters
In order to build a likelihood using the constraints and TFs as described above, it is required to
provide 18 measured input parameters, as follows:
 the energies Ei of four jets
10.1 Kinematic Likelihood Fitter Kinematic Fitting
 the angular information of four jets, i =
i, i
 the energy El of the lepton
 the angular information of the lepton, l =
l, l
 the missing momentum x-, y- and z-components. The z-component is calculated using a
constraint on the W -boson mass, M2W = (p + p`)
2. In general two solutions exist, and the
one which results in the larger likelihood is selected. If no solution exists (or if both fall
outside of a1 TeV bound) then the longitudinal momentum is set to 0 GeV. Additionally
the transverse momentum components px,y are permitted to float during the fit alongside
the other parameters.
The lepton information is used in the invariant mass constraints, however it is assumed that
there is no uncertainty on the measured direction of the lepton and as such this angular informa-
tion does not float during the fit.
10.1.2 The likelihood function
The likelihood takes a form which accounts for all of the above constraints and TFs, using
all leptonic, jet and missing energy information. The nominal likelihood as prescribed in the
nominal usage of the KLFitter is
W (Ei|Ei)
W (El|El) W (Emissx |p
x) W (E
W (i|i)
BW (m j j|MW )  BW (ml|MW )  BW (m j j j|Mt)  BW (ml j|Mt). (10.3)
The KLFitter makes use of the Minuit minimisation algorithm in order to find the global min-
imum of the negative log likelihood  lnL, to test each of the four reconstructed jets as placed
in each of the possible parton positions within the event topology. Using four reconstructed jets
in four positions results in 24 possible permutations, however as the likelihood is insensitive to
a swapping two jets in the place of the hadronic W -bosons decay, the fit is simplified to only 12
permutations. There is further possibility to reduce (or increase) this complexity as discussed in
sections below.
10.1 Kinematic Likelihood Fitter Kinematic Fitting
Angular Likelihood
The V A structure of the electroweak interaction in the top-quark decay provides predictions
for the angular distribution of the charged lepton. There is the option to use an extra angular
term in the likelihood fit taking into account helicity corrections in the decays of the W -bosons.
These corrections take the form
d cosl blep
1 cosl blep
1 cosl blep
1+ cosl blep
(10.4)
d cosqbhad
1 cosqbhad
(FL +FR)
1 cosqbhad
, (10.5)
where F0,L,R represent the W -helicity fractions for longitudinal, left- and right-handed W -bosons
respectively. These are set to F0 = 0.687, FL = 0.311 and FR = 0.002 in the KLFitter following
the theoretical predictions [106].
Fit parameters
Within each permutation, the KLFitter has the freedom to fit the measurement of each parameter.
The fit simultaneously finds the most optimal distribution of jets whilst correcting the event
kinematics. The KLFitter is designed, for every jet permutation, to scan over 16 parameters
defined below as part of the likelihood minimisation process:
 energy of the four quarks, Ei  [min(0, Ei7 
Ei), Ei +7 
Ei] GeV
 energy of the lepton, El  [min(0, El2 
El), El +2 
El] GeV
 missing energy x- and y-components, px,y  [Emissx,y 100,Emissx,y +100] GeV
 missing energy z-component, pz  [1000,+1000] GeV
 pseudorapidity of the four quarks, i  [i0.2, i +0.2]
 azimuthal angle of the four quarks, i  [i0.1, i +0.1]
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
The parameter ranges are intended to be conservative with respect to the resolution of the
detector, to prevent the fit on each from reaching the edge of the parameter space [107]. Option-
ally, it is possible to include a 17th free parameter in the form of the top-quark mass, however
such a wide mass window is unlikely to produce an increase in performance and this is tested
further later. The default use for permitting a free top-quark mass is to provide functionality for
analyses using the KLFitter which wish to measure the top-quark mass and avoid bias, for all
other analyses the default top-quark mass constraint is expected to provide better performance.

10.2 KLFitter optimisation
The KLFitter may be configured in many ways in order to increase the performance of the
likelihood fit. It is important to find the best configuration, unique to each analysis, to maximise
the performance of the tool; here defined as the purity of the final selection. The use case for
this analysis is to identify specifically the correct placement of any SMT-tagged jet considered
by the analysis, in order to classify the jet as either a same-top (ST) or different-top (DT) jet
(events in which the the charged lepton from the W -boson and the soft muon from the b-quark
both originate from the decay products of an individual top quark are labelled ST, and event in
which the two leptons originate from the decay products of two different top quarks are labelled
as DT). The KLFitter does not know about the soft muon itself, and bases its decisions on the
kinematics of the reconstructed jets.
10.2.1 Truth matching and performance
Before it is possible to measure the performance of the KLFitter in classifying tagged jets as
either ST or DT, it must be known in simulation what the tagged jet represents. The MC contains
information required to track the full history of every soft muon contained in the simulation
record for each event. Each soft muon is classified as either ST, DT signal, or as one of several
backgrounds; dilepton (DIL), pileup (g bb X), additional radiation (g(q) bb X),
c  (tWb csb bX) and light flavour (LF, such as +
 +). The breakdown
of the nominal tt MC into signal and backgrounds (anything which is not ST or DT is referred
to as a tt background) is shown in Tables 10.1- 10.4. Figure 10.1 and Figure 10.2 include
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
the non-tt backgrounds also. The yields are separated by reconstructed charge-pair bin after
a KLFitter ST/DT decision, for these tables in particular the KLFitter decision has been made
using the optimised configuration as described at the end of this chapter, as opposed to the
nominal configuration initially described below.
The signal tt processes is dominated by direct b  (see Table 10.9 below) which in ST
events will populate the opposite-sign (OS) bins, and in DT events will populate the same-sign
(SS) bins (until flipping the charge of the first lepton to account for this, and therefore populating
the OS bins as seen below).
For the background c , where the muon originates from a W -boson hadronic decay,
the pairing of the soft muon and the charged lepton from the other W -boson is by definition a
DT-type event, with the expected charge pairing to be of opposite sign (OS). If the KLFitter
mistakenly classifies this type of event as ST, then it will populate the ST OS bins, as shown in
Table 10.1. If the KLFitter correctly identifies this type of event as DT (which it does correctly
for most occurrences), then it will flip the charge of the first lepton, and populate the DT same-
sign (SS) bins, as shown in Table 10.2. This is the reason for the difference in shapes between
the ST and DT plots shown in Figure 10.1 and Figure 10.2.
The light flavour background is seen to have a slight asymmetry between SS and OS, and
also between ST and DT, however the magnitude of the differences in each bin fall within one
standard deviation of the systematic uncertainties, which are of the order of 20 events for each
LF bin.
The dilepton background is extremely asymmetric, this is because the tagged muon is not
a real SMT muon but is instead the second charged lepton from a W -boson in the event. The
two leptons are then by definition perfectly anti-correlated in charge and also constructed as a
DT-type event. If the KLFitter mistakenly classifies this type of event as ST, then it will populate
the ST OS bins, as shown in Table 10.1. If the KLFitter correctly identifies this type of event
as DT (which it does for most occurrences), then it will flip the charge of the first lepton, and
populate the DT SS bins, as shown in Table 10.2.
The additional radiation background is found to be fairly symmetric across all ST, DT, SS
and OS bins, any deviations are well within the systematic uncertainty on each bin which is of
the order 30 events.
The pileup background, originating from interactions within a tt event but not from the
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
hard scatter, is the second smallest contribution to the tt backgrounds. It is shown to have
a slight asymmetry in favour of positive SMT muon fakes, larger than the magnitude of the
systematic uncertainty on each bin which is of the order 4 events. This is considered to be
a real effect, although given the very small number of events (pileup fakes  1% total yield,
largest bin deviation  0.03% of true tt signal yield) it is considered to have a negligible effect
within the uncertainties of the CA and CPA measurements. A possible hypothesis for the slight
asymmetry could result from the presence of kaons in the underlying event, as the interaction
cross-section of a negative kaon in the detector is greater than that for a positive kaon. This
means a positive kaon is more likely to decay and produce a soft muon before it is absorbed in
the detector material. As the SMT tagger fake rate is calibrated in data it is expected that the
contribution of these types of fakes is well understood, and as the acceptance is extremely small
kaons do not constitute the same magnitude of difficulty as for the inclusive muon measurement
at D0 [46].

The performance of the KLFitter can be measured by looking at the purity of its decisions,
here described for the ST case but relevant for DT also,
KLFitter Purity: KL =
NSTtruth and N
NSTKL
= P(TST|KLST) (10.6)
where NSTtruth is the number of truth ST events, N
KL is the number of events classified as ST by
the KLF, and P(TST|KLST) is the probability of an event being a truth ST event TST given a ST
KLFitter decision KLST.
The performance may only be measured for SMT muons which are classified in the truth
record as ST or DT, all tt background muons in MC are removed. A high purity is required to
maximise the diagonality of the response matrix for unfolding, and minimise the uncertainties
propagated through the matrix inversion.

10.2.2 Nominal setup
The nominal setup for the KLFitter is based on the prescription described in [103]. The initial
configuration, all of which may be altered and is optimised in the following sections, is given in
Table 10.5.
Configuration option Nominal setting
b-tagging SMT+MV1@85%
Number of b-tags  1
Jet multiplicity Four jets permuted per event only
Jet selection priority Highest pT jets selected for permutations
b-tagged jet positions No permutations with tagged jets in light flavour positions
Top-quark mass treatment Fixed at 172.5 GeV
Likelihood Basic (not angular)
Permutation selection Permutation with maximum likelihood
Likelihood cuts No cuts
Table 10.5: Overview of the nominal KLFitter configuration.
Using this configuration, the nominal performance of the KLFitter is presented in Tables 10.6
and 10.7, where each entry represents the probability for an event of true charge pairing  to
be reconstructed with charge pairing ab. The magnitude of the MC statistical uncertainty on all
performance figures for the tables in this section is of the order of 0.001. It has not been added
onto every table to prevent repetition. In all cases the muon channel has the same performance
as the electron channel, and is not shown.
The results of the KLFitter are used to produce a response matrix required for the unfolding
of the measurement and described in detail in Section 11. For the nominal setup, the response
matrices (as separated by ST and DT) appear as below. There is a clear difference in performance
between SS and OS bins, which is discussed and resolved in Section 10.2.3 below. Also present
is a difference in performance between ST and DT type events, similar to that observed in [103].
Prior to unfolding, the electron and muon channels, and ST and DT classifications are combined,
with the total performance shown in Table 10.7.
10.2.3 Semileptonic corrections
The KLFitter performances deviates significantly between the SS and OS bins. OS leptons
appear in all decay chains of truth tt events. There is no correlation between the drop in per-

formance as a function of charge when the events are separated by ST or DT, or in terms of
the charge of either of either lepton individually. The only identifiable difference between well
reconstructed and poorly reconstructed events is the SS/OS classification of the two leptons. In
order to find the root cause, the SS and OS decays are studied individually to search for dis-
crepancies. Equations 2-7 in [50] show the possible b  decay channels, labelled as PRL2 to
PRL7 to easily compare with the equations from that paper:

where in each case it is the second lepton which is identified as the soft muon in the event.

shows the KLFitter performance for each PRL equation, within their primary SS/OS category

Similar performance is seen for PRL3-4 and PRL6-7, whilst the performance for PRL2 and
PRL5 is significantly worse. This means that whilst a decay chain with poor KL is present
for both the SS and OS decays, the relative yields show why the drop in performance is only
apparent for the full sample in the OS case. PRL2 only makes up about 20% of the SS decays
and therefore the stronger performance from PRL3 dominates the total. PRL5 however makes
up about 89% of the OS decays and it is the performance of the KLFitter on this decay which is
seen primarily.
The explanation for this lies in the intermediate D-meson for the better performing decays.
The KLFitter TFs are designed to map a measured jets energy and angular variables back to
that of its parent quark. Performance degrades if the jets reconstruction is significantly different
than expected by the TFs. As the jets in consideration are b-jets with semileptonic decays, the
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
measurement of the jet will never be exact as there will always be energy removed by the soft
muon and its associated neutrino. The greater the energy of the  pair, the more unlike the
initial quark the b-jet will appear and the more the TFs will struggle to produce a good likelihood
for positioning that jet correctly within the tt topology. When an intermediate D-meson exists,
the total energy given to the soft muon and the neutrino is smaller than for a more direct b 
transition and the TFs perform well. However without the D-meson the soft muon comes directly
from the B-meson and has a larger energy on average with a larger neutrino energy alongside,
in those cases the KLFitter has worse performance. Without measurement of the neutrino, other
than its contribution to the total missing momentum, tests may be made using only the soft
muon as an approximation. The soft muon and the neutrino will be highly correlated in terms of
energy. Figure 10.3 shows the SMT pT distribution for each PRL decay, and Figure 10.4 shows
the difference in energy between the reconstructed b-jet and its true MC b-quark, p
It is clear that there are two distinct shapes in the SMT pT distribution according to the
presence of a D-meson. It is possible to plot the performance of the KLFitter as a function
of difference between reconstructed jet pT and the matched MC parton b-quark pT in order to
gauge the direct dependence, as in Figure 10.5.
The KLFitter dependency on p
T shows that it is the missing energy from the semileptonic
decay which is causing the drop in performance. It is possible to alleviate this issue by correcting
every tagged SMT jet with the expected energy loss from the soft muon and neutrino. An
ATLAS internal tool performs this correction using scale factors calibrated in double b-tagged
dijet events. The correction is applied as follows:
1. Identify reconstructed muons within the radius of the jet cone (the SMT muon).
2. Subtract the expected muon ionisation E loss (energy left in the detector) from the recon-
structed jet.
3. Identify the characteristic scale factor, fSLC, required to correct a jet of measured energy
E j with muon(s) of energy E, to the correct value when neutrinos are accounted for.
4. Reconstruct the corrected jet energy as: ESLCj = fSLC
E j +E +E loss
Apply the soft-lepton corrections (SLC) significantly reduces the difference between the
KLFitter performance for the SS and the OS events and also improves the performance of the
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
KLFitter overall. The purity of the KLFitter per decay chain with this SLC correction and the
updated response matrices are shown in the tables below.

The effect of the SLC corrections on the above distributions is clear, with in all cases the
larger improvement occuring in the direct b  decay channels (PRL2, PRL5) as expected.
In all cases the difference between the reconstructed b-jet pT and the matched b-quark pT is
reduced, as in Figure 10.6. The improvement in the KLFitter performance is produced by pro-
viding the fitter with reconstructed b-jets closer in properties to the b-quarks into which the
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
KLFitter tries to transform them, in search of the correct jet-parton pairings in the event topol-
ogy. The KLFitter TFs are required to alter the reconstructed jet pT by a lesser amount during
the fit in order to reconstruct the top-quark and W -boson masses as part of the likelihood con-
straints. This reduction of the strain on the TFs results in a higher likelihood for the correct jet
permutations. This may be seen in Figures 10.7 and 10.8.
10.2.4 Configuration optimisation
The follow sections, with reference to the nominal settings given in Table 10.5, explore al-
terations to the configuration of the KLFitter to optimise the performance. Each alteration is
performed individually, and the performance tables below are to each be compared directly to
Tables 10.6 and 10.7 (unless otherwise stated), and each is performed without the semileptonic
corrections applied. A summary table giving the average performance over all bins for each
alteration, as well as the optimised performance for the final configuration, is provided at the
end of this section.
Tagging selection
In this analysis, it is a requirement to use the SMT tagger in order to identify the soft muon
utilised for the charge asymmetry. However it is interesting to study the performance of the
KLFitter as a function of different MV1 tagger working points (combined with the SMT). Per-
formance of the KLFitter using MV1 tagging alone would be higher, as the fraction of double-
tagged events would increase. The KLFitter is known to have much stronger performance on
events with two tagged jets, where there are only two possible permutations to consider [103].
Tables 10.13- 10.22 show the performance of the KLFitter with the SMT tagger only, and the
combination of the SMT tagger with the MV1 tagger at various working points. The MV1
working points are selected from the available ATLAS calibrations, with 70%, 80%, and 85%
(nominal) b-jet tagging efficiency. In addition, two working points (70%, 80%) are tests for
the modified MV1c tagger [86] which provides additional charm jet rejection. It is seen that
providing the KLFitter with MV1 information in addition to SMT tagging does not affect the
performance of the KLFitter and KL is stable. The power of the tagging combination is utilised
in the reduction of fakes as described in Section 8.

Jet multiplicity
The event selection for this analysis requires at least four jets to satisfy quality and momentum
requirements. By default in events with more than four jets, only the four with the highest pT
are provided to the KLFitter for consideration. There are events however where the inclusion of
the 5th or 6th reconstructed jets may be beneficial. It is possible for ISR/FSR jets from quarks
in the event to be measured with larger pT than other primary jets, and in such a scenario the

KLFitter is unlikely to perform well in reconstructing the correct event topology as it is working
with the wrong objects. It is also however possible for SMT-tagged jets to be excluded by
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
extending the jet multiplicity inclusion, for example if by chance the additional jet combines to
produce a higher likelihood than with the primary SMT jet. This section should be considered
in context with the following study on jet priority (Section 10.2.4). The results of this study are
in Tables 10.24 and 10.31. It can be seen that inclusion of the 5th highest pT jet (in events for
which one exists) provides a similar performance of the KLFitter as the four jet case. However,
inclusion of six or more jets begins to show a small decrease in performance in the OS bins - the
possibility of creating a reasonable likelihood from a random jet combinatoric increases as more
jets are added. It must also be noted from a practical viewpoint that the inclusion of more jets
greatly increases the number of permutations per event for which a likelihood must be calculated,
and therefore the processing time and computational power required quickly grows. If all jets in
every event are included this would become a very limiting factor. The optimal selection is to
use five jets in each event, when combined with the study in the following Section 10.2.4.

Table 10.32: Summary of performance of the KLFitter for different jet multiplicity permutations
Jet priority
By default in an event with more jets than the permitted multiplicity described above, the jets
provided to the KLFitter to work with are selected based on pT (hereon labelled as the pT -
priority technique). An event with eight jets but a jet multiplicity allowance of five will have its
five highest pT jets considered only, the remaining three jets will be ignored. This means it is
possible to lose events with correctly tagged SMT jets which happen to be at low pT . To resolve
this, it is possible to give priority to SMT tagged jets for use in the KLFitter permutations. If an
event has eight jets and the SMT does not qualify as being one of the hardest, it can be given to
the KLFitter first regardless, before the remaining spaces in each permutation are filled in pT or-
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
der from the remaining jets. This avoids any situation regarding the exclusion of tagged jets and
therefore in some events will allow correct permutations to be found when otherwise this may
have been impossible. This technique is labelled b-tag priority. In the tables below, extended
versions of the b-tag priority technique are also applied. The KLFitter may be informed of
additional b-tagging information on jets which are not tagged by both the SMT and MV1 algo-
rithms (doubly-tagged), to improve the reconstruction performance. The KLFitter may be told
about additional MV1 or SMT-tagged jets (singly-tagged) in the event, to reduce the number of
possible permutations (however any additional singly-tagged SMT jets will not be used as input
for the charge asymmetry measurement). The fitter then benefits from the inclusion of events
with two MV1 tags (as stated previously the KLFitter is known to have stronger performance on
events with two tagged jets, where there are only two possible permutations to consider [103]),
whilst continuing to ensure that a doubly-tagged SMT+MV1 jet is present in all events. In con-
junction with the previous section, this study is performed with a jet multiplicity of four jets (the
nominal) and also of five jets. For Tables 10.33- 10.38 the following definitions are used:
 PtP: The nominal condition, the hardest jets are given to the KLFitter only. No single-
tagged jet information is utilised.
 PtAdv: The hardest jets are given to the KLFitter only. Singly-tagged jets are utilised for
additional information.
 bTagP: b-tagged jets are added to the KLFitter first, followed by the subsequent hardest
jets. No singly-tagged jet information is utilised.
 bTagPAdv: b-tagged jets are added to the KLFitter first, followed by the subsequent
hardest jets. Singly-tagged jets are utilised for additional information.
In the four jet multiplicity study, the best performance comes from prioritising jets by pT
and including information about singly-tagged MV1 and SMT jets. In the five jet multiplicity
study, the best performance comes from prioritising the addition to the KLFitter of firstly doubly-
tagged jets (SMT+MV1), and then secondary singly-tagged MV1-only and SMT-only jets. In
both cases this is because although we only use the doubly-tagged jets for the analysis, the
individual efficiencies of the taggers (primarily the MV1 tagger) are high enough that there is a
good chance the additional tagged jets are also real b-jets. Using the results from Table 6.3, it is

possible to estimate that the fraction of events with two SMT+MV1 tagged jets is only  0.8%,
the fraction of events with two SMT tagged jets is  1%, whilst the fraction of events with two
MV1 tagged jets is  73%.
Prioritising doubly-tagged jets slightly lowers the performance in both cases. Without this
configuration, events with the lowest pT doubly-tagged jets are discarded as the KLFitter is
not given an opportunity to make a ST or DT decision. With this configuration, approximately
3000 events are recovered, however as the KLFitter performance improves with jet pT , the
performance on the recovered events is poor. In all cases, providing additional information to the
fitter about singly-tagged jets is beneficial as it reduces the fit to only two permutations (per four
jets) and the KLFitter performs extremely well. Using the five jet multiplicity, the improvement
in performance on events with additional singly-tagged jets outweighs the drop in performance
from the low pT doubly-tagged jets, whilst retaining the gain in statistics, potentially from the
opportunity to throw out surviving high pT IFSR jets.
b-tagged jet positions
In the nominal setup the KLFitter interprets a jet which is tagged as being the absolute truth.
A tagged jet is considered to be a b-jet without question, and therefore when permuting the
jets within the event topology any tagged jets are only placed in b-quark positions. Placing a
b-jet into a light-quark position is vetoed and the likelihood is not calculated to save time, this
configuration within the KLFitter is known as kVetoNoFit. The KLFitter is able to include
an extra term in the likelihood which takes into account the efficiency and mistag rate of the b-
tagger in use. This is designed to reduce problems caused by a tagger with a high mistag rate in
data, and therefore having numerous events with chance of finding correct jet permutation. This
alternative setup is known as the kWorkingPoint configuration. In this analysis however usage
of kWorkingPoint is non-trivial. It is not clear whether to quote the SMT efficiency as inclusive
of the low b  branching ratio for the likelihood calculation. The taggers real efficiency is
much higher (see Section 7), however with the inclusion of the 21% b  branching ratio
the KLFitter may assume that the majority of tagged jets are mistags. Such a low effective
efficiency would cause the KLFitter to give a low weight to b-tagged jets and to effectively
ignore the tagger. Secondly as it has already been decided to combine the SMT+MV1 taggers,
the situation is complicated further by trying to provide a single efficiency and mistag rate for
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
the combined tags. Lastly, as it is already known that the inclusion of MV1 tagging removes
many of the mistagged SMT jets (see Section 8.2.4), it is unlikely that the kWorkingPoint mode
would provide much additional power against mistagged jets still in the events.
Top-quark mass constraints
As part of the nominal likelihood calculation the KLFitter reconstructs the event topology using
as a constraint top-quark mass target of 172.5 GeV, for each side of the decay. This provides
strong limits for how far the fitter can modify the reconstructed jet and lepton energies and
angular variables within their resolutions. However it could be argued that, in the interest of
separating signal events from non tt backgrounds, a reconstruction of the top-quark mass for a
real tt event would tend to produce a mass much closer to the real top-quark mass than a selection
of jets from a background event such a W+jets. In a fixed-mass scenario (nominal) this constraint
should decrease the average likelihood of all background event permutations as the objects need
to be smeared further from their true properties to reconstruct a target top-quark mass (which
could then be separated by a cut on the likelihood, as is explored in Section 10.2.6 below). For
the signal tt events, in general, placing more limits on the system will result in a better result.
However, it is interesting to study the option of permitting a free top-quark mass as this allows
for plotting of the reconstructed top-quark mass for the best permutation in each event, to see
if there is a signal to background separation. It is seen in the Figure 10.9 that the distinction is
unclear, as the yield of true tt events selected is already so much greater than that of background
events, any cuts would be detrimental to the overall selection purity. Tables 10.45- 10.46 of the
KLFitter performance indicate working with a free top-quark mass is not beneficial.

between the nominal, and the angular form with W -boson helicity corrections. Tables 10.47

The performance of the KLFitter is seen to improve with the angular likelihood.

boson helicity fractions, and therefore it is this option which is used in the analysis.
10.2.5 Likelihood interpretation
Having optimised the input to the KLFitter in the previous section, it is important to continue
to look for improvement which can be made once the output of the fitter has been determined.
Studies in this section onward are performed on the optimised KLFitter configuration as de-
fined in Table 10.55, comparisons in performance should be made directly with Tables 10.56
and Tables 10.57.
Studying the output of the fitter may allow for the possibility to identify further discrepancies
between the behaviour of true ST, DT and background events.
It is possible to study the distribution of likelihoods calculated from each permutation, per
event. The default technique is to select the permutation with the best likelihood as the correct
one. However alternative options exist as described in the sections below which may represent
more sophisticated ways to interpret the likelihood output.
Highest likelihood
The default option is to pick the permutation in each event which produces the highest likeli-
hood. The full performance, with all of the optimisations from the previous section, is given in
Tables 10.56 and Tables 10.57.
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
Highest average likelihood
For events with a single tagged and four jets in total to permute (the majority of events), the
KLFitter will calculate six permutations falling into only two categories; ST or DT, depend-
ing on the position of the tagged jet. In many permutations all of the calculated likelihoods
are extremely similar, comparable likelihoods for all permutations may lead to selections of jet
combinatorics by chance. A technique for avoiding potential combinatoric contamination could
be to consider the results not as six separate permutations, but as two sets of three; defined by
the placement of the SMT+MV1 jet. Taking the average likelihood of the ST permutations com-
pared with the DT permutations may provide a slight increase in performance. The performance
with this configuration is given in Tables 10.49 and Tables 10.50, it is not found to provide an in-
crease in purity of the KLFitter decision, the performance is equivalent to the highest likelihood
option.

Dominant likelihood
Another method for many-permutation events, is to pick the category (ST or DT) which appears
most of the top 50% of all permutations, once ordered by likelihood. In a six permutation event,
this would select the modal ST or DT decision in the top three permutations. This technique
could remove any fluke high likelihoods from an incorrect reconstructions. The performance
with this configuration is given in Tables 10.51 and Tables 10.52, it is not found to increase the

Lowest likelihood rejection
Similar to selecting the highest likelihood permutation as being correct, it is possible to use the
alternative of rejecting the ST or DT decision given by the lowest likelihood permutation. If the
tagged jet is in the correct position, the calculated likelihood for each permutation is expected
to be better than permutations where the tagged jet is not correctly placed, although this is very
sensitive to the positions of the other jets. Focusing on the lowest likelihood permutation in each
event and selecting as correct the category the opposite decision may yield an improvement in
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting

10.2.6 Likelihood manipulation
Further to considering potential combinations or reinterpretations of likelihoods within a single
event, it is possible to study the distribution of the selected permutation likelihoods for the
sample as a whole. It is possible to compare the distributions of likelihoods for truth ST and
DT separately, for signal versus background events, and within signal events it is possible to
compare the distributions according to whether the KLFitter decision is correct or incorrect.
Further to the total likelihood distribution, it is possible to break the likelihood down into its
constituent parts and also compare each of those distributions in the aforementioned categories.
It may be possible to find separation in the distributions to improve the overall performance on
signal events, or reject additional background events, using cuts on the final likelihood.
10.2 KLFitter optimisation Kinematic Fitting
Cut for tt signal enhancement
Figure 10.10 shows the likelihood distributions for the selected permutations in signal and back-
ground events. Background events may have distributions shifted further to the low-negative
(worst-performance) side than signal events, as the KLFitter is attempting to fit non-tt recon-
structed objects to a tt topology, which would provide the possibility of cutting on the likelihood
distribution to increase the signal purity. However as the figure shows, it is difficult to differen-
tiate between signal and background using the likelihood, as any difference in shape is hidden
underneath the large difference in yields of signal to background events over the full distribution.

The +jets distribution is analogous
Cuts for KLFitter purity enhancement
Figure 10.11 shows the likelihood distributions for the highest likelihood permutations in signal
events only, separated by whether or not the KLFitter decision is correct. Any difference in shape
is hidden underneath the large difference in yields of correct to incorrect decisions over the full
distribution. Applying any cut would remove more correctly identified events than incorrectly
identified events.

10.2.7 KLFitter performance
The optimised configuration is given in Table 10.55 described by the studies in this chapter. The
performance for the optimised KLFitter is given in Tables 10.56 and 10.57. However there
remains a small difference in the performance between the true ST and true DT events. A po-
tential hypothesis relates to the semileptonic jet corrections. The missing momentum correction
has been applied to the tagged jets, however it has not been corrected for in the total MET for the
event. Considering the event topology, the missing momentum from the semileptonic decay will
tend to be more aligned with the MET in the ST events and less aligned with the MET in the DT
events. Whilst in both cases the angular information and the total amplitude for the MET will be
mismeasured (with respect to the removal of the neutrino in the semileptonic b-quark decay), the
measurement will be worse in DT as the difference in angle is greater. The MET-x and MET-y
components provided to the fitter will vary by a larger degree from the truth in the DT case than
the ST case, leading to a worse reconstruction. However, differences in performance between
ST and DT events are quoted in KLFitter implementation papers [103], and the magnitude of the
difference in performce and not deemed to be an issue. All events, ST or DT, are combined be-

fore the response matrix used for unfolding is constructed. A future improvement to the analysis
would be to apply diagnose this difference fully and apply a correction to increase the combined
performance of the fitter.

Chapter 11
Unfolding techniques
Unfolding is the process by which all detector, algorithmic or other effects which may cause a
measurement to differ from a true value in nature are removed. Measurement only have mean-
ing within the context of the experiment in which they are made, equivalent measurements per-
formed under different experimental conditions cannot be compared directly until all of the
experimental effects are removed. This include the experimental phase space, measurement res-
olutions, efficiencies, acceptances and bias. In order to make a measurement globally accessible,
each analysis must undo all of these factors. The method for unfolding will differ from exper-
iment to experiment and analysis to analysis as necessary; the intended method for this analysis
is reported in this section. From a mathematical perspective, the goal of unfolding is to construct
estimators for the contents of a true histogram y given a reconstructed histogram x, where the
probability density functions (PDF) are unknown, but related in the form of Equation 11.1 [108].
fmeas (x) =
R(x|y) ftruedy, (11.1)
where R(x|y) is known as the response function and defines the transformation between the
true and measured PDFs. In some analyses events are counted and filled into histograms as
approximations for PDFs, in this scenario the relation takes the form
Mi j j, (11.2)
where i is the expectation value for the number of observed events in bin i of variable x, and  j
is the expectation value for bin j from the true histogram y. In this formulation, Mi j is a response

matrix which defines the probability of migration for a true event in any bin j to be reconstructed
and observed in any bin i, as in
Mi j = P(observed in bin i|true value in bin j) . (11.3)
In reality however the presence of background events  must also be considered, and so Equa-
tion 11.2 is modified into
Mi j j +i. (11.4)
Unfolding describes the process reversal this equation to solve for  j and rebuild an estima-
tion for true histogram y. This requires the inversion of the response matrix, to produce Equa-
tion 11.5, where for N bins  = (1, ...,N),  = (1, ...,N), and each has been replaced by their
estimators  and n (assuming independent Poisson-distributed events in the observed data set).
 = M1 (n) (11.5)
However the application of this inversion is not always trivial, and is explored further in
Section 11.7.
11.1 Unfolding formulation
In order to unfold an experimental measurement several additional steps are required. The com-
plete function for the analysis presented here is
M 1i j  f
acc  (N
dataN
bkg), (11.6)
where i, j = {N++,N,N+,N+} and index i runs over the particle-level (MC truth) while
index j runs over the reconstruction-level. N jdata and N
bkg are the number of events observed in
data and the estimated background, respectively. An acceptance term, f jacc, and an efficiency
term, i, are applied bin-by-bin and are discussed in the sections below.
The response matrix, Mi j, is a discrete 44 matrix, shown in Table 10.57, where non-zero
off-diagonal terms can only occur via charge misidentification or via the misassignment of the

11.2 Combination of e+jets and +jets channels
The physics of interest should not depend on the flavor of the lepton from the W -boson should
also not depend the ST or DT classification of the soft muon. Prior to measurement of the CA
and CP asymmetries, and prior to the construction of the response matrix and the acceptance
and efficiency factors used for unfolding, the observed ST and DT events in both the e+jets and
+jets data must be combined. The background composition and total yield varies for each N
bin, and as such all backgrounds are subtracted from the data prior to combination. ST and DT
distributions are combined via direct addition, and for the data the e+jets and +jets are also
combined via addition. For MC, the e+jets channel reweighted such that the Monte Carlo ratio
of e/ events, matches that of the data (e/) according to Ncb =
e/ Ne
+N, where Ne is the
binned e+jets yield, N is the binned +jets yield and Ncb is the combined yield for any particular
bin. A factor of e/ = 0.993
+0.039
0.038 is observed, with the systematic uncertainty break down given
in Table 11.1. The dominant uncertainty comes from additional radiation. A separate epsilon
emu data / MC ratio is calculated and used for each systematic uncertainty individually.
11.3 Fiducial volume
A fiducial volume describes the region of phase space in which an analysis is performed after
removing all experimental effects. An ideal analysis would have an unconstrained fiducial vol-
ume, representing a fully inclusive result and yielding an estimation for the value of interest as
it exists in nature. However the extrapolation of any measurement to an unconstrained fiducial
volume is impractical, as for example modelling uncertainties on low-energy QCD processes
are prohibitively large. Attempting to extrapolate a measurement to include a low energy regime
would increase modelling systematics such as those from additional radiation and parton distri-
bution functions by several orders of magnitude. Instead a fiducial volume within which physics
processes are well understood is defined. Comparisons to theoretical models may still be made
as predictions for each model may be constrained to the same fiducial volume of interest.
In the case of this analysis, as presented in Equations 4.20- 4.24, the charge and CP asym-
metries are related by decay-chain fractions (DCFs) which describe the relative contributions

11.4 Acceptance
The acceptance, f jacc, is a bin-by-bin correction factor to account for events which satisfy recon-
struction requirements, but fail to satisfy particle-level requirements. This can occur due to reso-
lution effects from the detector, a jet with true pT near (but outside of) the selection phase space
may be mismeasured (pT smearing) and therefore allow the event to be erroneously included
11.4 Acceptance Unfolding techniques
at reconstruction-level. The acceptance factor is designed to scale down from all events which
satisfy reconstruction-level requirements, to only those events which satisfy both reconstruction-
level and particle-level requirements. The acceptance term also includes backgrounds within
the tt sample itself, such as muons originating from light-flavour, pile-up, c , initial- and
final-state radiation and dilepton tt events. This choice (as opposed to subtracting the tt back-
ground events with the non-tt backgrounds) removes dependency of the acceptance terms on the
tt production cross section. If the tt backgrounds are subtracted with the non-tt backgrounds,
an iterative process is required, as the measured production cross section meastt would differ
slightly from the cross section used to scale the tt MC sample (inclusive of those backgrounds)
initially. The measurement would have to be repeated several times until the two values agreed.
Allowing the tt backgrounds to factor into the acceptance terms directly avoids this issue. The
acceptance terms take the form of f jacc =
Nrecofid
Nreco
, where Nreco is the number of MC recon-
structed events after background subtraction, and Nrecofid is the number of MC reconstructed
events after background subtraction for which the MC truth is also inside the fiducial volume.
The result of performing the acceptance correction is to create a distribution of events which
satisfy both reconstruction- and particle-levels requirements, and which exist within a well-
defined phase space (the fiducial volume). The acceptance factors, for the combined ST and DT
distributions, with both electron and muon channels, are as follows:
f++acc = 0.642

where the experimental (Expt.) and modelling (Model) systematic uncertainties are broken down
in Table 11.2. The opposite-sign (OS) acceptances are larger as (from Tables 10.1- 10.4) the OS
events suffer from a smaller tt background fraction, primarily due to the distribution of the c 
background events.

11.5 Response matrix
A response matrix (or migration matrix) is designed to correct for events which drift between CA
bins due to misidentification. Traditionally, migration matrices account for effects of measure-
ment resolution; in a distribution of jet pT event reconstruction with a given detector smears
the shape of the histogram due imperfect resolution. In this analysis the causes of migrations
between bins are much simpler; a mistake in the KLFitter decision, or a charge mis-ID on the
triggered lepton or soft muon. With the ATLAS detector charge mis-ID is extremely small (see
11.6 Particle-level corrections Unfolding techniques
Section 9.1.3), as such the response matrix will be entirely dominated by the purity of the KL-
Fitter decision. There is a correlation between the diagonality of the response matrix and the
statistical uncertainty associated with the measurement (see Section 11.8.3 below); so ensuring
the best performance from the KLFitter is important. Any response matrix, whether a 50% di-
agonal or 95% diagonal, should unfold the data to the correct measurement, however the 95%
purity matrix will do so with a much smaller uncertainty. The response matrix, Mi j, is pop-
ulated exclusively by SMT muons which are matched between the reconstruction and particle
level (no tt background events). A response matrix must be inverted in order to undo the effects
of misidentification, this process requires some optimisation and is discussed in Section 11.7.
The response matrix produced for this analysis, for the combined ST and DT distributions, with
both electron and muon channels, is shown in Table 11.3 (as shown also in Table 10.57 in the
previous chapter).

11.6 Particle-level corrections
The efficiency i in unfolding is to account for events which have not yet been included in the
analysis as they failed to satisfy the reconstruction-level requirements. The analysis must scale
up from the sample which now satisfies all reconstruction- and particle-level requirements, to a
sample weighted to include events which satisfy particle-level requirements but are not success-
fully reconstructed. An efficiency term, i, is applied bin-by-bin to the unfolded data to correct
for these non-reconstructed SMT muons. The efficiency terms take the form of Equation 11.11,
where Nfid is the number of MC truth events which are inside the fiducial volume, and Nrecofid
is the number of MC reconstructed events after background subtraction for which the MC truth
is inside the fiducial volume.

11.7 Matrix inversion and regularisation
The inversion of a response matrix must be performed carefully. Matrices which are considered
to be very off-diagonal (a relative phrase dependent on the bin sizing and measurement reso-
lution) may produce highly oscillatory results from minor fluctuations and increase the overall
uncertainty on analysis results. This is primarily caused by statistical fluctuations. For a PDF
with fine structure, the details of that structure and the random fluctations become indistinguish-
able. This is generally a greater problem for distributions with too many bins and as such a
compromise is required between the desired resolution of the measurement for the variable of
interest and the extent of the systematic error resulting from the matrix inversion. Response ma-
trices are often regularised in order to decrease the variance on the inverted result by enforcing
some constraints on the smoothness of the resulting distribution. The more regularised a ma-
trix is however the greater the bias it will also produce, as regularisation introduces correlations
between bins in the unfolded distribution. Following the examples in [108] for a log-likelihood
method, for a regularised matrix inversion it might be chosen to maximise
() =  lnL()+S () , (11.16)

where S () is a regularisation function and  is a regularisation parameter. These represent
the smoothness and may be chosen freely. Often S () is chosen to be related to the second
derivative of  in each bin, a technique known as Tikhonov regularisation [109, 110].
This analysis has the advantage of only using four bins, due to this minor fluctuations be-
tween the bins will not produce significant effects. This suggests that unfolding may be achieved
by Unregularised Matrix Inversion (UMI). In the following sections, studies are performed to
compare the performance of UMI, against Iterative Bayesian (IB) matrix inversion [111], with
four (IB4) and eight (IB8) iterations respectively.
11.8 Statistical uncertainty and bias Unfolding techniques
11.7.1 Unregularised matrix inversion
Unregularised matrix inversion is a very simple algorithm which directly inverts the response
matrix without any smoothing or regularisation. It is considered to be the most vulnerable to
statistical fluctuations, however it is also known to produce the smallest possible variance for
an unbiased estimator. In the sections below, unfolding performed using unregularised matrix
inversion is labelled as UMI.
11.7.2 Iterative Bayesian matrix inversion
Iterative Bayesian matrix inversion was first proposed in 1995 [111]. This approach uses a
freely defined prior probability pi for finding each true event in each reconstructed bin, along
with Bayes theorem [112] to update estimators for the true bin contents as
i =
P(true value in bin i|found in bin j)n j =
Mi j pi
k M jk pk
n j, (11.17)
where i is the estimator for the number of events in true bin i, n j is the number of events in
reconstructed bin j, and i = 
i=1 Mi j = P(observed anywhere |true value in bin j) is the prob-
ability to observed each event at all. Equation 11.17 is applied iteratively (using
i i
as the
value for the next pi) until an accepted balance between the variance on the estimated i and the
introduced bias is reached. In the sections below, unfolding performed using iterative bayesian
matrix inversion is labelled as IB4 or IB8 for inversion using four or eight iterations respectively.
11.8 Statistical uncertainty and bias
11.8.1 Closure test
To ensure the correct functioning of the unfolding code, a software closure test must be per-
formed. The acceptance and efficiency factors and the response matrix are all built from MC.
If the same MC at the reconstruction-level is unfolded using these factors and matrix, it should
reproduce exactly the MC at the fiducial truth-level. This test is performed on the nominal MC
in this analyses and the system is found to close fully.
11.8 Statistical uncertainty and bias Unfolding techniques
11.8.2 Stress tests
Stress tests are designed to ensure that the method is robust against mistakes in modelling such
as the simulation of the expected charge asymmetries (CA). Unfolding should be able to recover
the truth parameters, regardless of what the true parameters are. An unfolding method which
is not robust against modelling mistakes would return erroneous results when applied to data.
The unfolding technique must be unbiased with respect to the CA modelled in the MC from
which it is built is the , and the CA in the sample it is applied to. The steps below are taken to
test the capability of the response matrix and efficiency terms to unfold a distribution built from
the same MC but with different CAs. The acceptance terms are not included in this stress test,
as the technique involves reweighting the nominal sample at the fiducial truth-level to produce
a sample with a new inbuilt charge asymmetry. This reweighting is only applicable to events
which are true tt signal events and fall within the fiducial volume, reconstructed events which
are true tt but fall outside of the fiducial volume, or which are part of the tt backgrounds, cannot
be subject to the same reweighting procedure as there is no fiducial-truth level event to link their
reweighting to. This means that a sample of reconstructed-level events including those tt events
which are not fiducial is poorly defined, and applying acceptance factors to such a sample is also
poorly defined. As such, the following technique is used to stress test the unfolding procedure
from the point of the response matrix inversion only, and the potential effects of the acceptance
factors are assumed to be similar to that of the efficiency factors, which are stressed:
1. Create nominal CA bins and efficiency factors from tt MC
2. Calculate scale factors to alter each bin yield in order to artificially produce a sample at
the fiducial truth-level with a different desired CA (SS or OS in turn, as they are anti-
correlated and therefore not uniquely controlled)
3. Reweight every event in order to produce new CA bins with the desired CA at the recon-
struction level, for the subset of events which are also present at the fiducial truth level
(after the point of an acceptance scale factor in the nominal unfolding process). The mod-
elling of these events is identical in every way to the nominal sample except the CA has
been altered to stress test the unfolding. This reweighting method provides an effectively
new sample for which both reconstructed and truth events already exist
11.8 Statistical uncertainty and bias Unfolding techniques
4. Use the nominal response matrix (and efficiency terms) to unfold the CA-altered recon-
structed samples and compare the unfolded outputs to the CA-altered true fiducial values.
The analysis bias is defined as the raw difference between the unfolded CAs (CAUF) and
their true fiducial values (CAfid). This is measured in MC as bias b = CAMCfid CA
UF . This
may be measured at the point directly subsequent to the matrix inversion, as in Tables 11.5
and 11.6, or following the application of the efficiency factors, as in Tables 11.7 and 11.8.
Tables 11.5 and 11.6 show that the UMI method is unbiased against changes in the CA of
the test sample. The IB4 method shows minimal bias, whilst the IB8 method falls inbetween.
Tables 11.7 and 11.8 show that the affect of the efficiency factors is similar, the UMI method
has a bias which falls between 010% of the central value (which is negligible with respect to
the overall uncertainties on the measurement), IB4 has a bias between 310% and on average
higher than UMI, and IB8 again falls inbetween.

uncertainty on data. The study described in this section is also used to justify the optimisation
of the KLFitter. It will be shown that the statistical uncertainty on the unfolded results has a de-
pendency on KLFitter performance. In order to estimate the statistical uncertainty on the charge
asymmetries using the optimised KLFitter:
1. Construct the acceptances, efficiencies and response matrix using the nominal MC signal.
2. Run tests with varying numbers of toys. For every toy, smear the contents of each CA bin
by a Poisson function, then use the nominal unfolding components to unfold the smeared
sample back to a fiducial truth-level.
3. For each toy, calculate the unfolded CAs and CPs. Plotting these asymmetries into his-
tograms results in Gaussian distributions around the true CA and CP values. The width
of these distributions gives an estimate of the statistical uncertainty on the asymmetry
measurements.
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 are used to determine that the statistical uncertainty may be reason-
able predicted using 5000 toys, the central values the errors on the uncertainties are stable. The
pull of the distributions after 5000 toys, used to ensure that the statistical uncertainties are cor-
rectly estimated, is defined in Equation 11.18, where x is a measured value,  is the mean of all

based on a random number generator, using truth information to provide a specific probability
of correctly identifying each SMT jet as ST or DT. For UMI, IB4 and IB8 it is apparent that the
statistical uncertainty is dependent on KL, however all three converge at KL = 80%. Therefore
it is determined that for KLFitter purity of 80%, UMI is the optimal choice of matrix inversion.

Results
Following from the definition and optimisation of the analysis in the previous sections, the results
of this measurement are presented in this section.
12.1 Measurement of tt cross-section
To demonstrate good understanding of the signal process and relevant backgrounds it is informa-
tive to report the tt cross-section determined using the events in this analysis. This is an inclusive
cross-section as measured using the b-tagged event selection and built from Equation 12.1,
tt =
NdataNbkg
Ldt BR
, (12.1)
where Ndata is the measured data yield, Nbkg is the predicted background yield, BR = 0.543 is the
branching ratio for the single-lepton and dilepton channels derived using the W  ` branching
ratio BR(W  `) = 0.108 per flavour (e,,) [41]. The signal efficiency  also relates only
to the single-lepton and dilepton channels as the acceptance for the tt fully hadronic channel is
negligible. The signal efficiencies are observed to be

12.1 Measurement of tt cross-section Results
where the uncertainties include both statistical and systematic components. The cross-section is
measured in the e+jets and +jets channels separately as well as in the combined selection. The
results are shown in Equations 12.5- 12.7 and the full breakdown of uncertainties is shown in
Table 12.1 [92].

The uncertainty related to the beam energy at the LHC is 1.7% [98], and the uncertainty
related to the integrated luminosity is 1.9% [97].
The cross-sections are found to be in good agreement with both the 8 TeV theoretical predic-
tion and the most recent results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, as shown in Table 12.2.
The result agrees within one standard deviation with the existing ATLAS `+jets channel mea-
surement, and benefits from an improved luminosity estimation (due to time spent by ATLAS
improving the understanding of the luminosity between the measurements), the events used for
the two analyses are highly correlated, although updates to detector calibrations and MC sim-
ulations may have occurred in between. However this measurement is not competitive with
the ATLAS and CMS dilepton results. The dilepton channel has much smaller statistics, and
therefore an overall increase in the statistical uncertainty, however it also has minimal back-
ground contamination and less jet modelling required, so the overall systematic uncertainties
are reduced. The exception to this is the dilepton channel with -leptons, where the s may
decay leptonically or hadronically. The dominant systematics on the cross-section are found to
be the jet energy scale (JES), the MV1 b-tagging fake rate, the hadron-to-muon branching ratio
uncertainties and the MC modelling.

sections. The observed charge asymmetries are found to be compatible with zero, and with good
MC to data agreement. The results are given in Equations 12.8 and 12.9 with the full breakdown
of uncertainties shown in Table 12.3. Figure 12.1 and 12.2 show the same-top-like (ST) and

where the total statistical and systematic correlations between Ass and Aos are estimated to be

where Ass,osi are the MC toy measurements, A
ss,os are the means of the toy distributions, and
ss,os are the uncertainties. A strong correlation between Ass and Aos is expected, as shown in
Equations 4.9, they are both built from the same four numbers, N++, N, N+, N+.
The majority of systematic shifts are small as they alter the yields in the four charge bins
in similar ways, such that their effects are cancelled out when applied to the ratio structure in
the CA calculations. The largest systematic uncertainties are those which adversely affect the
structure of the response matrix. The additional radiation is found to be the dominant system-
atic uncertainty. An increase in the number of additional radiation jets (IFSR) results in poorer
performance of the KLFitter, moreso than any other systematic uncertainty (equivalently, a de-
crease in the number of additional radiation jets results in a better performance of the KLFitter).

This generates a response matrices which vary from the nominal by a greater degree than other
systematics. Additionally, due to the random nature of IFSR, the performance on each true
charge-pair bin varies in a non-uniform way which generates additional variations in the charge
asymmetries. Table 12.4 shows the diagonal components of the response matrices generated
by the nominal MC, the increased IFSR MC, the decreased IFSR MC, two JES systematic MC
samples, and MC samples with the SMT momentum imbalance scale factor shifted up and down
by its uncertainty. In brackets are the raw differences between the nominal values and the shifted
values in each bin. The largest shift in each bin, which is a measure of the KLFitter performance,

is caused by the changes in the IFSR. For comparison with the results in Table 12.3, the values
in Table 12.5 shows the total systematic uncertainties as converted into an uncertainty on the
response matrix (shown to three decimal places). The first row shows the central values of the
diagonal with a full combination of the systematic uncertainties from all sources, each subse-
quent row shows the individual contributions of the systematic uncertainties from the IFSR, JES
and SMT systematics. The relative magnitude of these uncertainties is coherent with the relative
systematics in Table 12.3. The MC statistical uncertainty on the central values is  0.001.

largest modifiers to the KLFitter performance) align with the largest uncertainties on the measured charge
and CP asymmetries.
This measurement is therefore currently statistically limited. Future analyses with larger
statistics would focus on the reduction of the systematic uncertainties, this is discussed further
in Section 13.1.
12.3 Measurement of CP asymmetries Results
For comparison, the CA are also calculated using the nominal MC sample using the same
procedure as applied to the data. This gives a measure of the CAs as they are implemented in the
nominal MC model with a small uncertainty owing to the large MC statistics. The MC results
are found to be compatible with zero and in good agreement with the data and are shown in
Equations 12.11 and 12.12, with the MC statistical uncertainty.

12.3.1 Decay chain fractions
The decay chain fractions (DCF) are measured in MC at the particle level, with definitions given
in Equations 12.15-12.17, where each N refers to the number of events to follow the decay
chains previousyl described in Equations 4.1-4.6. The DCFs obtained are shown with their
modelling systematic uncertainties in Table 12.6. In all cases the systematics are dominated
by the parton shower and hadron-to-muon branching ratio uncertainties. The parton shower
modelling controls the probability for any particular decay to propagate via a b c transition
or to include b-meson mixing, and the hadron-to-muon branching ratio uncertainty controls the
probability for each b- or c-quark to produce a soft muon. Variations of each will alter the

12.3.2 CP asymmetry extraction
Attempting to extract four CPAs from two CA measurements is non-trivial, the system is under-
constrained and this results in extremely large uncertainties on all parameters as many combina-
tions of CPAs may recreate the same CA values. Since a linear combination of CPAs may cancel
each other out, each can potentially vary from 100% to +100% and still produce CAs near to
0%. In order to tighten the uncertainties on the measured CPAs it is necessary to implement fur-
ther constraints. The SM predictions (see Table 12.8) for each CA and CP parameter are small
and compatible with zero. It is therefore justified to produce an upper limit on each CPA individ-
ually by considering each one to be solely responsible for the measured CAs in turn, and setting
all other CPAs to zero. This technique [50] leads to a fully constrained system, and removes the
requirement to perform a fit, as it is now possible to produce a one-to-one relationship between
the CAs and CPAs (including the DCFs) as shown in Equations 12.18-12.21 (for parameters
which appear in both Ass and Aos, the result with the smallest uncertainty is taken). Furthermore
12.4 Interpretation of results Results
as suggested in [50, 118, 119], in the case of no direct CP violation, Ab`mix = A
mix (comparing
Equations 4.15-4.19, if direct CP violation in b  and b c decays is disallowed, Ab`mix and
Abcmix are only sensitive to b b mixing). The mixing asymmetry from hereon is referred to as
simply Abmix. The full breakdown of uncertainties is shown in Table 12.7.

This measurement is therefore currently statistically limited. Future analyses with larger
statistics would focus on the reduction of the systematic uncertainties, this is discussed further
in Section 13.1.
For comparison, the CPAs are also calculated using the nominal MC sample using the same
procedure as applied to the data. This gives a measure of the CPAs as they are implemented
in the nominal MC model with a small uncertainty owing to the large MC statistics. The MC
results are found to be compatible with zero and in good agreement with the data and are shown
in Equations 12.22 and 12.25, with the MC statistical uncertainty shown.

on the absolute values |A|. The existing experimental limits are derived from measurements in
exclusive channels which are extrapolated to inclusive estimations by considering uncertainties
on relevant branching ratios (each CPA prediction makes no assumption on the value of any
other CPA). For Abmix the last two columns are determined using the prescription from [50], with
inputs from the HFAG world average high-energy fd,s [89] and either the world average [89]
or the SM predictions [120] for adsl and a
sl respectively (where a
sl are the flavour-specific CP
asymmetries, and fd,s are the fragmentation functions of B0d,s, as discussed in Section 4.2). The
observations are compatible with the SM. This analysis is found to provide an equivalent limit
to the existing limit on Ab`dir, a stronger limit on A
dir, and the first limits on A

12.4.1 The D0 anomalous dimuon asymmetry
As discussed in Section 4, an inclusive like-sign dimuon charged asymmetry measurement was
reported by the D0 experiment [46], which observed an excess of approximately 3 from the
SM. The asymmetry may be interpreted as the result of either mixing or direct CP asymmetries.
It is calculated that to account for the D0 result in terms of mixing CP violation it would be
required that Abmix  0.008 0.003 [46]. To account for the D0 result in terms of direct CP
violation it would be required that Ab`dir  (0.003 0.001) or A
dir  (0.009 0.003) [52] (no
equivalent calculation has been performed for Abcdir). The observed CPAs are compatible with
both the SM and with the D0 results within 1.

Chapter 13
Conclusions
A study of CP violation in inclusive b- and c-hadron is performed in the tt `+jets decay channel
using collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, amounting to 20.3 fb1 of Run
1 data at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV. Same- and opposite-sign charge asymmetries
are measured, each built from the pairing of a lepton from the W -boson in the top-quark decay
and a soft muon from the semileptonic decay of a b- or c-hadron.
Soft muons are identified by the ATLAS Soft Muon Tagger (SMT), which is calibrated using
J/  and Z   events. The SMT tagger uses the fractional difference in absolute mo-
mentum, the Momentum Imbalance (MI), between a track measured in the Inner Detector (ID)
and Muon Spectrometer (MS) (extrapolated back to the primary vertex) in order to differentiate
between true soft muons from heavy-flavour decays and fakes. The calibration takes the form
of a tag and probe analysis, and the efficiency is measured as a function of muon transverse
momentum and angular position. It is also studied as a function of the isolation of the muon,
to determine that the calibration performed on isolated muons from J/ and Z decays may be
utilised in a jet environment for tt decays.
Background estimates are taken from MC for the Z+jets, diboson and single-top back-
grounds, whilst data-driven methods ware utilised to estimate the multijet and W+jets back-
grounds. Contributions from tt fakes (such as soft muons from c  decays and pile-up) are
reduced and the signal purity is maximised by combining the SMT tagger with a multivariate
(MV1) tagger at the 80% efficiency working point. A measurement of the tt `+jets cross-section
is performed and found to be in agreement with other experimental results and the Standard
Model expectation.
13.1 Future improvements Conclusions
A kinematic likelihood fitting algorithm is optimised and used to resolve the ambiguity re-
lated to the source of the leptons from the W -boson and the soft muon (whether they are the
result of the same- or different-top-quark decays) with a purity of KL = 79 1%. The Kine-
matic Likelihood Fitter (KLFitter) performance is studied when altering many parameters, the
final optimisation for which may be found in Table 10.55.
Unfolding to correct for the KLFitter event misidentification is performed using an unregu-
larised matrix inversion to determine the charge asymmetries in a well-defined fiducial volume.
Unregularised matrix inversion is chosen to avoid the introduction of bias from regularised meth-
ods. At the KL = 791% working point, the statistical uncertainty on the final results yielded
by the regularised and unregularised methods are comparable.
Decay chain fractions are taken from MC, and used to extract four CP asymmetries (CPAs).
Each CPA is extracted from the CAs individually, using the assumption that all other CPAs are
negligible in turn. This is justified using the SM expectations for each CPA shown in Table 12.8.
This is the first measurement of the inclusive charge asymmetries presented, and the results
reported are compatible with zero and with the Standard Model. The analysis also sets the first
limits on Abcdir, and reports an equivalent value to the existing limit on A
dir, a stronger limit on
Ac`dir, and the first limits on A
dir. All results reported are also compatible with the anomalous D0
dimuon asymmetry [46].
13.1 Future improvements
A repeat of this experiment using the Run 2 data set has the potential to yield significantly
improved results. Assuming (naively) that the statistical uncertainty on each CA and CPA will
decrease as a direct function of the cross-section and integrated luminosity, the predictions for a
13 TeV analysis using 100 fb1 are shown in Table 13.1. The numbers in this table are derived
using the theory values for the tt production cross-section of 8 TeV = 252 pb [39] and 13 TeV =
832 pb [39,123], assuming the same reconstruction efficiencies apply. For the calculation of the
total uncertainty, it is assumed that the systematics will not decrease.
An analysis under these conditions would find negligible statistical uncertainty, and focus
would be put onto reduction of the dominant systematic uncertainties. The largest individual
systematic uncertainty is the additional radiation (the modelling of the initial- and final-state

radiation in pp collisions resulting in the formation of additional jets). Reduction of the addi-
tional radiation systematic could be achieved by focusing on the exclusion of IFSR jets. In this
analysis the KLFitter is optimised to include up to five jets. Reverting the selection to only the
hardest four jets would allow for less contamination from IFSR, although it would also produce
a small decrease of the KLFitter performance. The most promising potential change would be
to increase the cut on the jet transverse momentum. At 8 TeV the peak in the jet pT spectrum is
around 50 GeV, for existing 13 TeV analyses the peak is seen to be around 70 GeV. The large gain
in statistics might allow for increasing the pT cut to 50 GeV to remove contributions from softer
IFSR jets without suffering from a significant increase in statistical uncertainty. The reduce
number of IFSR jets would decrease the additional radiation systematic, and potentially also re-
duce the second and third largest systematics of the jet energy scale and jet vertex fraction also.
Increasing the jet pT cut would also provide the additional benefit of improving the KLFitter
performance. The KLFitter purity is known to increase as a function of transverse momentum,
as higher pT jets tend to be more collimated and better separated than low pT jets. At 13 TeV this
performance increase combined with the decrease of the additional radiation systematic might
provide considerable improvement to the resolution on the measured asymmetries.
Another alternative is to replace usage of the KLFitter with a multivariate approach. A
multivariate discriminant trained on angular variables such as R(SMT, `) has the potential to
yield similar performance. If the chosen input variables could be designed as independent from
additional radiation, this could produce a reduction in the systematic uncertainties.
The current analysis is reported to be competitive in measuring the direct CP asymmetries,
however to be competitive with existing limits on the mixing CP asymmetries (which are domi-
nated by B-factory measurements and LHCb) would require a reduction on the total uncertainty
13.1 Future improvements Conclusions
on Abmix to 0.1%. Using the same technique as utilised to build Table 13.1, it would require at
least 3000 fb1 of 13 TeV data (the expected yield of the high-luminosity LHC by 2035) and a
significant reduction of systematic uncertainties (a factor of 20) to achieve this level of precision.
To refute the central value of the D0 result in mixing to a level of 3 however, a total uncertainty
on the order of 0.25% would be required. This could be achieved with 500 fb1 assuming again
a similar reduction of systematic uncertainties.
One final technique which could be utilised to reduce the uncertainties on specific CP asym-
metries could be to modify the definition of the fiducial volume to include more phase space (and
therefore more statistics) for a particular decay chain, or to have a variety of fiducial volume def-
initions to optimise the extraction of each one. A study is performed to monitor the change in
central values of the decay chain fractions as a function of the fiducial volume requirement ap-
plied to the soft muon pT and jet pT . Table 13.2 shows the variation in decay chain fractions
observed, however it is unlikely that alterations of this magnitude would be significant for the
uncertainties on the final results. Taking the fifth row as an example (Soft muon pT > 8 GeV,
jet pT > 25 GeV), the increase of rb would only reduce the statistical uncertainty component
of Abmix down to 0.020 from 0.021, a much larger alteration of the fiducial volume would be
required to enhance the contribution of b b ` decays to have a significant effect.

Additionally, the increase in statistics might permit for an analysis binned by b-hadron life-
time. In analogy to the technique utilised in [46], the difference in the impact parameters (IP)
between the charged lepton track and the soft muon track gives an indication of travel distance

which are the CP asymmetries for mixing in B0d and B
s mesons respectively. Cq are functions
of the mean mixing probabilities (q) and production fractions of B0d and B
s mesons. The mixing
probabilities of neutral B mesons follow the form of 1 - cos(mqt) and the proper decay time
t. Samples with large IP tend to have larger t and as a result larger q. Although Asmix are inde-
pendent of the proper decay time, their extraction using this technique requires this information.
Binning by b-hadron lifetime also opens sensitivity to CP violation in the interference between
mixing and decay, in the form of an asymmetry Aint, from decay chains with similar identical
final states (such as t `+(b cc) `+`X decays including charge conjugation).
Appendix A
Charge and CP asymmetry relations
This appendix justifies the relations between the charge asymmetries (CA) in Equations A.1
and A.2, and the CP asymmetries (CPA) in Equations A.3-A.7, via the decay chain fractions
(DCF) in Equations A.8-A.16.
For Ass, it is expected for events to contain two leptons in the final state with the same charge.
Each term is justified here, where decay chains starting with a b-quark (as opposed to a b-quark)
will always contain an `+ from the W -boson, and therefore to qualify as same-sign, require an
`+ in the final state from the b-quark decay chain. Charge conjugation is assumed for the ``
pairings.
 rbAb`mix
 Ab`mix requires a b b `
+ decay chain, this exactly lines up with the chain given
in Equation A.11 to which rb relates.
 rcAbcdir
 Abcdir requires a b c decay chain, and rc provides b c `
 rcAc`dir
 Ac`dir is defined in reverse to the other asymmetries as the anti-quark appears on the
left of the asymmetries in Equation A.6. Nonetheless, it requires a c `+ decay,
which is provided by rc. The negative contribution to the same-sign events is a result
of the reversed asymmetry definition.
Charge and CP asymmetry relations
 rccAbcmix
 Abcmix requires a b b c decay, this is provided by rcc, however to reconstruct this
as a same-sign event the lepton must come from the c decay, not the c decay.
 rccAc`dir
 Ac`dir as described above has the reverse definition. In this case, as in the previous
rcc case, the lepton must come fromthe c decay, not the c decay. The negative con-
tribution to the same-sign events is a result of the reversed asymmetry definition.
For Aos, it is expected for events to contain two leptons in the final state with opposite charge.
Each term is justified here, where decay chains starting with a b-quark (as opposed to ab-quark)
will always contain an `+ from the W -boson, and therefore to qualify as opposite-sign, require
an ` in the final state from the b-quark decay chain. Charge conjugation is assumed for the
``+ pairings.
 rbAb`dir
 Ab`dir requires a b `
 decay, this exactly lines up with the chain given in Equa-
tion A.14 to which rb relates.
 rcAbcmix
 Abcmix requires a b b c decay, which agrees with Equation A.15 where the final
lepton comes from the c as expected.
 rcAc`dir
 Ac`dir is defined in reverse to the other asymmetries as the anti-quark appears on the
left of the asymmetries in Equation A.6. The rc however provides this correctly as
part of the longer b b c decay, so Ac`dir may appear with a positive contribution
in the opposite-sign asymmetry, as opposed to in the same-sign asymmetry.
 rccAc`dir
 Ac`dir as described above has a reverse definition. In the rcc decays the b  cc
satisfies the opposite-sign requirements assuming the lepton comes from the c decay,
so Ac`dir may again appear with a positive contribution in the opposite-sign asymmetry.
