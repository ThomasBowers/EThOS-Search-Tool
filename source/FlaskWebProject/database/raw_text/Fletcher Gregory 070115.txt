A study is presented on the production of vector boson (W and Z0)
events in association with recoiling hadronic activity in the form of hadronic
jets, using proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The dataset was taken by the
ATLAS detector during the 2011 data-taking run, at a centre of mass energy
s = 7 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb1. A
measurement of the cross-section ratio of W+jets
Z+jets
events is defined, reducing the
large systematic uncertainties inherent in the experimental measurement of
such events. Inclusive and differential cross-sections are presented for W+jets
Z+jets
as a function of a range of kinematic variables, and are compared to state-of-
the-art theoretical predictions.

Introduction
The Large Hadron Collider is a particle accelerator designed to produce proton-
proton collisions at unprecedented energies. ATLAS is a general purpose de-
tector designed to measure the products of such collisions, thereby allowing
scientists to explore a new and extremely rich physics programme. In such an
environment, certain components of the Standard Model of particle physics
will be produced in abundance. Among them are the propagators of the weak
nuclear force, namely the W and Z vector bosons1. Such particles will be pro-
duced in association with hadronic activity, which we can measure in ATLAS
as jets of particles. It is therefore imperative for searches for new physics
processes, and continued study of the Standard Model, to gain a comprehensive
understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A deeper understanding
of QCD will facilitate precise predictions of hadronic behaviour at the high
energy frontier of experimental particle physics.
In addition, W and Z bosons with associated hadronic activity produce the
same final state signatures as processes that could indicate the presence of new
physics. A thorough understanding of how W+jets and Z+jets events behave
is crucial to new physics studies, and studies of the Higgs boson, for which
W+jets and Z+jets events are background processes.
1Throughout this work, W refers to either a W+ or W boson, and Z refers to either a
Z0 or  boson.
4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
This work presents a measurement of the ratio of W+jets
Z+jets
events as a function
of a wide range of kinematic variables. The decay modes of the W and Z
bosons are very well understood, therefore an analysis of W+jets
Z+jets
events is a
way to measure the differences in the kinematic distributions of hadronic jets
recoiling from a W or Z, providing a precise test of QCD. The precise nature
of this measurement draws from the fact that many sources of systematic
uncertainty that dominate separate W+jets and Z+jets measurements, but
are nevertheless common to both, are greatly reduced in the ratio.
A precise evaluation of state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of QCD ef-
fects can be extracted by comparing the measured ratio with predictions from
Monte Carlo simulation and next-to-leading order calculations.
The measurement presented in this thesis was conducted on data acquired
by the ATLAS detector during the 2011 LHC proton-proton run at a centre
of mass energy of
s = 7 TeV. The first measurement of this kind was made
by the ATLAS collaboration using data taken during the 2010 LHC run [1].
This measurement demonstrated the sensitivity of the ratio to QCD effects but
suffered from statistical limitations and was therefore narrow in scope. The
dataset employed in the analysis described here is over 100 times as large as
that used in the former ratio measurement. This increase in statistics lead to
a significant improvement in precision over a large region of phase space, and
provided access to previously unobtainable differential distributions.
The structure of this work is as follows: Chapter 2 provides a theoreti-
cal background and overview of the Standard Model of particle physics, with
particular emphasis placed on those concepts most relevant to the ratio mea-
surement: the W and Z vector bosons and hadronic jets.
Chapter 3 discusses the LHC, specifically the process by which protons
are accelerated to desired energies. The ATLAS detector is also discussed,
detailing the various components pertinent to detecting events of the type
that enter the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio. Additionally, a short study of the Lorentz angle as
measured in the ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker is presented, this study was
conducted as part of the authors service task.
Chapter 4 describes the method by which W+jets and Z+jets events were
selected from the 2011 dataset. Separate selections are detailed for the electron
and muon decay channels. The way in which the ATLAS collaboration per-
forms calibrations on hadronic jets is discussed, and the sources of systematic
uncertainty entering the analysis at detector level are detailed. Detector-level
distributions are shown for W+jets and Z+jets events, in both leptonic chan-
nels.
Chapter 5 details the way in which background events were characterised
for this analysis. This chapter focuses on those backgrounds determined by
data-driven techniques. They are multi-jet events from QCD processes passing
the W+jets and Z+jets event selections, and tt events passing the W+jets event
selection. A discussion of the sources of systematic uncertainty associated with
each background estimation is included.
Chapter 6 details the Bayesian iterative method by which the distribu-
tions measured at detector level are unfolded to particle level. Unfolding
was performed to account for detector effects and for direct comparison with
theoretical predictions. Sources of systematic uncertainty associated with this
method are presented and particle level distributions for W+jets and Z+jets
events in the electron channel are shown.
Chapter 7 presents a short study with leading order Monte Carlo pre-
dictions that demonstrates the sensitivity of the ratio measurement to QCD
radiation, and the decoupling of QED and QCD radiation in this analysis.
Chapter 7 also includes a discussion of the theoretical predictions to which
the unfolded data are compared. Most attention is paid to the next-to-leading
order calculations provided by BLACKHAT+SHERPA, and the various bin-
by-bin correction factors (and associated systematic uncertainties) required
before direct comparisons can be made.
Finally, Chapter 8 provides a brief overview of the extrapolation of the
two separate lepton channels from their respective fiducial phase space to a
6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
common phase space, and the method by which the two measurements are
combined. The W+jets
Z+jets
ratio is then presented at particle level, as a function of
inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicity up to four jets. Additionally, differential
measurements of the ratio are presented as a function of: (i) the transverse
momentum and rapidity of the leading, second- and third-leading jets in events
with at least one, two or three jets respectively, (ii) the scalar sum of all jet
transverse momentum in events with at least two or three jets, and (iii) a
set of di-jet variables in events with at least two jets. A discussion of each
distribution and the salient features of their agreement or disagreement with
theoretical predictions is included.
The analysis presented in this thesis was conducted within the ATLAS
collaboration, by an analysis team of 12 people. The internal ATLAS note,
that describes the full analysis in every detail, is over 850 pages long. For this
reason, not every aspect of the analysis is discussed in this thesis, nor was the
full analysis the sole work of the author. Instead, an attempt has been made
to highlight the pertinent points at each stage of the analysis, with particular
emphasis on the aspects that the author contributed to. The measurement of
W+jets
Z+jets
is powerful due to the cancellation of many systematic uncertainties.
Therefore, care has been taken to describe in detail the sources of systematic
uncertainty entering the measurement at each stage of the analysis.
Additionally, the author worked on a separate analysis of W+jets events
[2] which was conducted in parallel with the W+jets
Z+jets
measurement. The former
measured a wider range of kinematic variables than those measured in the
W+jets
Z+jets
analysis, but is not described here due to space constraints. All plots
in this thesis were produced by the author, unless specified otherwise.

Theory
2.1 The Standard Model
The Standard Model of particle physics describes the fundamental constituents
of matter and the interactions between them. Decades of experimental evi-
dence have revealed the Standard Model to be extraordinarily robust, success-
fully predicting the existence of many particles. Quantum field theory allows
us to represent particles in terms of quantisable fields, therefore the Standard
Model is best described as a theory of interacting fields. The dynamics of such
fields can in turn be expressed by a renormalisable Lagrangian which is invari-
ant under local gauge transformations. The requirement of invariance under
symmetry transformations is of particular importance as it is this quality of
the Standard Model Lagrangian that gives rise to conservable quantities and
their associated conservation laws. This is a direct result of the theorem proved
by Emmy Noether in 1915. For example, invariance under rotational transla-
tions leads to conservation of angular momentum and likewise time translation
symmetry leads to conservation of energy.
One of the principal achievements of the Standard Model has been the
successful description, within the same theoretical framework, of three of the
four fundamental forces of nature: the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces,
8 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
expressed in terms of gauge theories as U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) respectively.
The Standard Model can be written as their combination, namely SU(3) 
SU(2)U(1) (the combination of SU(2)U(1) gives rise to what is formally
known as electroweak theory). The mediators of the aforementioned forces
and the particles on which they act are described in the following section. The
fourth known force, gravity, is not included in the current Standard Model,
described as it is by the theory of General Relativity.
2.1.1 Particles of The Standard Model
The fundamental particles of the Standard Model are categorised into two
groups, defined by their intrinsic angular momentum (spin): bosons (integer
spin) and fermions (half-integer spin). Each fermion and boson with non-zero
quantum numbers has a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass, life-
time and equal-but-opposite charge. Fermions are sub-categorised into quarks
and leptons, and three generations of particles, with increasing mass, exist for
each. Quarks carry one of three colour charges (red, blue, green) and exist only
in bound, colourless, states known as hadrons. This is a direct consequence of
colour confinement, more on which in subsequent sections. Hadrons are com-
prised of either quark-anti quark pairs or three quarks; the former are known
as mesons and have integer spin (e.g. pions and kaons) and the latter baryons
which have half-integer spin (e.g. protons and neutrons). The three genera-
tions of quarks are grouped in pairs with a charge difference of one electron
charge (e). Leptons are not confined to bound states and therefore exist freely.
Each lepton also has an associated neutrino. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 summarise the
three generations of quarks and leptons respectively.
The other primary category of elementary particles, bosons, are the force
mediators in the Standard model. Massless photons () mediate the electro-
magnetic force, by coupling to electric charge, and massless gluons (g) mediate
the strong force, by coupling to colour charge. Massive W and Z0 bosons

2.2 Quantum Electrodynamics, Gauge Invari-
ance and Electroweak Theory
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the quantum field theory (QFT) that de-
scribes the dynamics of the electromagnetic force. It is represented by a U(1)
gauge theory. As mentioned above, invariance under symmetry transforma-
tions is a fundamental principle of QFT. Following this guiding principle, the
QED Lagrangian is formed by requiring invariance of the Dirac Lagrangian
(where  are the Dirac matrices):
LDirac = i m (2.1)
under local gauge transformations:
(x) 
(x) = ei(x), (x) (x) = ei(x) (2.2)
2.2. QED, GAUGE INVARIANCE AND ELECTROWEAK THEORY 11
This is achieved by replacing  with the covariant derivative D =  ieA,
which in turn requires the introduction of the photon gauge field A. This
field couples to charged particles and transforms as:
A  A +
A (2.3)
Since A is a physical field, a final term corresponding to its kinetic energy is
added to the Lagrangian. This term must also be gauge invariant and thus
involves the gauge invariant field strength tensor F = F  F . The
QED Lagrangian is therefore written as:
LQED = (i m) + eA 
 (2.4)
It can be shown from equation 2.4 that a non-zero mass term would break the
gauge invariance of the QED Lagrangian, therefore the photon is required to
be massless.
Electroweak theory was formulated independently by Sheldon Lee Glashow,
Abdul Salam and Steven Weinberg as a way to construct a gauge invariant
theory of the weak force, provided the electromagnetic force was also included.
As mentioned in Section 2.1, electroweak theory is represented by a combi-
nation of the gauge theories based on the invariance groups SU(2) and U(1).
The Lagrangian for the group SU(2) U(1) contains three bosons associated
with SU(2), W i (i=1,2,3), and one associated with U(1), B. The kinetic
energy terms for the vector boson fields (analogous to 1
 in the QED
Lagrangian) are:
L = 
(W)
i(W )i 
 (2.5)
where:
B = B  B (2.6)
12 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
W i = W
  W
  gWW
kl (2.7)
where gW is the gauge coupling of SU(2) and 
kl is the Levi-Civita symbol
representing the permutation tensor. The non-abelian nature of SU(2) results
in the third term in Equation 2.7. This term corresponds to self coupling of
the vector bosons, W i (directly analogous to gluon self coupling discussed in
Section 2.3). W i and B can be expressed in terms of the physical gauge fields
W+ , W
 , Z and A, connected to the W
+, W, Z0 bosons and the photon
respectively:
W 1 =
(W+ +W
 ) (2.8)
W 2 =
(W W
 ) (2.9)
W 3 = coswZ + sinwA (2.10)
B = coswA  sinwZ (2.11)
where w is the weak mixing angle. In this model all four bosons are massless.
This contradicts what is observed in nature where only the photon is massless,
whereas the W and Z0 vector bosons have the well defined masses given in
Table 2.3. Additional explicit mass terms for W and Z0 violate the local
gauge invariance of electroweak theory. For this reason, the Higgs mechanism
of spontaneous symmetry breaking was formulated to allow the aforementioned
bosons (as well as fermions) to have mass. The additional boson required by the
Higgs mechanism was first observed at the LHC by the ATLAS [4] and CMS
[5] experiments in July 2012. In electroweak theory spontaneous symmetry
breaking rotates the W i and B plane by w, producing the Z
0 vector boson
and the photon.
2.2. QED, GAUGE INVARIANCE AND ELECTROWEAK THEORY 13
2.2.1 Charge Screening and Running Coupling in QED
As stated above, QED describes the interactions between charged particles
via a massless photon. The strength of those interactions is determined by
the fine structure constant, . Spontaneous emission of a virtual photon,
that annihilates into an electron-positron pair, can lead to the polarisation of
the vacuum surrounding an electron, as positive charges are attracted to the
negatively charged electron. The resulting effect of such ee+ loops in the
photon propagator is a screening of the negative electron charge, and thus a
partial cancellation of the electric field. The effective charge of an electron is
therefore dependent on probing distance, i.e. the closer you are, the smaller
the effect of the polarised vacuum, and the larger effective electron charge.
This means that the electromagnetic coupling is dependent on energy scale, q,
and is referred to as a running coupling constant, (q2). The contribution from
momentum transfers in the charge screening loops can be infinite and therefore
a renormalisation scale, q2R, is introduced to avoid ultraviolet divergences. For
this reason, a value for q2R is chosen in the region q
R << q
2. The running
coupling of the fine structure constant can be expressed as a sum over all
higher order corrections from virtual loops (in powers of ln( q
)). For instance,
to second order this can be expressed as:
(q2R)
(q2)
+ 0ln(
) + . . . (2.12)
where 0 =
is dependent on the number of fermion generations, Nf = 3.
In the region q2R << q
2, Equation 2.12 is approximated to:
(q2) =
(q2R)
1 (q
ln( q
(2.13)
14 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
2.3 Quantum Chromodynamics
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes the strong interaction between
particles with colour charge. Colour charge is a property of quarks and gluons,
and can take values of red (R), blue (B) or green (G). Mediated by massless
gluons, the strong force is responsible for the binding together of quarks into
hadrons, as mentioned in Section 2.1.1. Like QED, QCD is represented by a
gauge theory, SU(3), expressed by a Lagrangian invariant under local colour
transformations:
LQCD = a(i m)a + gs(aTAa)GA 
FAF
A (2.14)
The Lagrangian is a sum over indices: the colour indices, a (running from 1 to
Nc = 3), and the colour degrees of freedom, A (running from 1 to 8, i.e. N
c1).
In the above equation gs is the coupling constant of the strong interaction
(analogous to  in the previous section), GA represent the gluon fields and a
the colour-carrying quark fields in the fundamental triplet representation of
SU(3):
(x) =
R(x)
B(x)
G(x)
 (2.15)
The generators of SU(3), TA, are matrices that describe the couplings of the 8
types of gluon to different colour charges and are provided by the 8 Gell-Mann
matrices A, where TA =
. The four-gradient transform in Equation 2.3
was sufficient for the photon field. However, the gauge transformations of the
gluon field can include rotations of its colour indices. Therefore, an extra term
is added to the four-gradient transform:
GA  G
 + 
A  gsfABCBGC (2.16)
2.3. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 15
where fABC are the structure constants of SU(3), and the indices A,B,C run
over the 8 colour degrees of freedom. To ensure invariance under such gauge
transforms, an additional term is required in the field strength tensor FA ,
which is expressed in terms of the gluon fields as follows:
FA = G
  G
 + gsf
ABCGBG
 (2.17)
The non-commuting third term in Equation 2.17 gives rise to the non-abelian
nature of SU(3) and leads to the interesting feature of gluon self-coupling
(both cubic and quartic) that ultimately distinguishes QCD from QED. The
implications of gluon self-coupling are discussed in more detail in the following
section.
2.3.1 Running Coupling and Asymptotic Freedom in
As mentioned in the previous section, QCD differs from QED in the crucial
feature that gluons carry colour charge and can therefore self-interact, unlike
electrically neutral photons. This means that gluons can not only emit quark-
antiquark pairs to form loops, which screen the colour charge in the same
manner as virtual photons discussed in Section 2.2.1, but also form virtual
gluon loops. This latter phenomenon augments the colour field and therefore
has the opposite effect of the quark-antiquark pairs, i.e. anti-screening. The
consequence of this is that the coupling strength of QCD, s, is also a scale
dependent, running coupling. Unlike the running coupling in QED, s has the
inverse property that the QCD coupling strength is largest at larger distances.
The reduction of colour field strength at high energies means that at in-
creasingly short distances the size of the force experienced by colour charges
tends to zero. In this region they behave as if free. This is known as asymptotic
freedom and means that in this regime perturbation theory can be applied to
16 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
To account for gluon self-coupling, the expression for the strong coupling
constant must contain not only a renormalisation scale, q2R (to avoid ultraviolet
divergences), but also an additional term. The expansion of the coupling
constant can be expressed as shown in Equation 2.12. In this case, 0 is
defined as 0 =
(2Nf  11Nc), where the term in Nc is an additional term
to account for gluon self-interaction, and Nc is the number of colour charges.
s can therefore be expressed as:
1 s(q
(2Nf  33)ln( q
(2.18)
which is commonly rearranged to give:
(33 2Nf )ln( q
(2.19)
where 2QCD is the value of q
R for which s tends to infinity, and is the limit
at which perturbation theory can be applied to QCD calculations. This QCD
scale represents the boundary between the perturbative and non-perturbative
regions of QCD and has a value of 0.3GeV.
Protons are composite particles, therefore there are many interactions be-
tween partons during proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC. The highest
momentum transfer between partons in a proton-proton collision is termed
the hard scatter. In order to calculate the hadronic cross-section of the hard
scattering process, we must consider physics processes in two energy regimes,
separated by the QCD scale, 2QCD. As seen above, at energy scales greater
than 2QCD, s tends to zero and perturbation theory can be used to calcu-
late the hard scatter partonic cross-section. At energies below 2QCD (long-
distance processes), asymptotic freedom no longer holds and the constituents
of the proton can no longer be resolved. In this energy region, experimentally-
determined parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used to make calculations
of the non-perturbative part of the hard scatter. In this manner, the two en-
ergy regimes are treated separately and combined by factorisation. Both PDFs
2.3. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 17
and factorisation are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
Interactions between proton remnants not included in the hard scatter
are referred to as the underlying event (UE). The UE typically occurs at
an energy scale lower than 2QCD and therefore cannot be calculated from
first principles using perturbation theory. Phenomenological models which are
tuned to data are used to predict the behaviour of the UE. Once the hard
scatter hadronic cross-section has been calculated via factorisation theorem,
the UE is included to yield a prediction for the full hadronic cross-section.
2.3.2 Parton Distribution Functions
Deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of leptons off hadronic targets provides an ex-
tremely useful experimental technique to probe hadrons and reveal their quark
and gluon substructure. From such experiments, we obtain a description of
the momentum distribution of the quarks in a proton via the proton struc-
ture functions F1(x, q
2) and F2(x, q
2), where x is the momentum fraction of
a given parton. As mentioned in Section 2.3.1, at sufficiently high energies
asymptotic freedom allows the modelling of quarks within a proton as point-
like particles, and as such the parton model arising from DIS can be extended
to understand hadron-hadron collisions. Since the total momentum of a pro-
ton is shared among its constituent partons, it is necessary for cross-section
calculations to know the momentum fraction carried by a particular parton.
Such distributions of momentum fraction, x, for a quark or a gluon are known
as parton distribution functions (PDFs). It is impossible to know the momen-
tum fraction carried by a parton on an event-by-event basis, therefore PDFs
are best described as the probability of a particular parton having momentum
fraction between x x+ dx at a given momentum transfer, q2. PDFs cannot
be determined from perturbative calculations like the hard scatter processes
in proton-proton collisions, rather they are extracted from global fits to data
from DIS, Drell-Yan and jet production measurements. At high momentum
18 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
transfer the PDFs, fquark(x, q
2), are related to the aforementioned structure
functions F1(x, q
2) and F2(x, q
2) as follows:
F2(x, q
xfquark,i(x, q
2) (2.20)
where:
F2(x, q
2) = 2xF1(x, q
2) (2.21)
and the index i runs over the quarks in a proton. Using Equations 2.20 and
2.21 we can extract the quark PDFs from the experimentally measured struc-
ture functions. This also helps us to understand the proton as consisting of
valence and sea quarks. The three valence quarks, uvuvdv, carry the elec-
tric charge and baryon quantum numbers, they radiate very many (a sea
of) light quark-antiquark pairs (qq). Since the sea contains quarks with
mass, mquark << q
2, we can assume it contains quarks of the three lightest
flavours; u, d and s. The Bjorken scaling hypothesis states that F1 and F2 are
not dependent on q2 but rather are purely functions of momentum fraction x.
Therefore, the number of u and d quarks in a proton can be expressed, as a
function of momentum fraction x only, as the sum of the number of valence
and sea quarks, i.e1:
u(x) = uv(x) + us(x) (2.22)
d(x) = dv(x) + ds(x) (2.23)
us(x) = us(x) = ds(x) = ds(x)  ss(x)  ss(x) (2.24)
Furthermore, summing over all parton constituents of a proton it is neces-
sary to retrieve the correct quantum numbers (charge: 1, baryon number: 1,
1It should be noted that in Equation 2.4 the strange quark PDFs are only approximately
the same as the u and d quark PDFs, as the former are usually assumed to be suppressed
with respect to the later. However, a recent study from ATLAS, whereby a PDF fit was
performed using 2010 W/Z inclusive data, suggested that the strange quark PDFs are not
suppressed [6].
2.3. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 19
strangeness: 0), hence the following summation laws:
[u(x) u(x)]dx = 2 (2.25)
[d(x) d(x)]dx = 1 (2.26)
[s(x) s(x)]dx = 0 (2.27)
A quark in the proton can emit a gluon and by this mechanism acquire
large transverse momentum (PT ). The PT of the parton is thus not restricted
to being small, leading to logarithms of q2. Such perturbations ultimately
break the Bjorken scaling hypothesis. The consequence being that the structure
functions are indeed dependent on momentum scale; decreasing with increasing
q2 at large values of x and exhibiting the opposite behaviour at small x.
The q2 dependence of PDFs (directly from Equations 2.20 and 2.21) is dealt
with by picking an initial momentum scale, q20, and a functional form to be fit
to data such as:
F (x, q2 = q20) = A0(q
A1(1 x)A2P (x) (2.28)
where A1 and A2 are free parameters in the PDF fit to data, and P (x) is a
smooth function chosen to add flexibility to the PDF parameterisation. Con-
straints on the above functional form include the summation laws expressed in
Equations 2.25-2.27. The Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Atarelli-Parisi (DGLAP)
[7, 8, 9, 10] equations are then employed to evolve the function up to the mo-
mentum scale of data, q2.
The DGLAP equations contain a number of splitting functions, Pqiqj , Pqg,
Pgq, Pgg, which describe the probability of a quark or gluon emitting a daughter
quark or gluon with momentum fraction x of the longitudinal momentum of
the parent parton. The splitting functions are perturbative expansions in the
running coupling, s, in a generalised form:
20 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
Pab(x, s) = P
ab (x) +
ab (x) + ... (2.29)
The splitting functions are the same for quarks and anti-quarks, this is a con-
sequence of charge conjugation invariance. They are also independent of quark
flavour as a consequence of flavour symmetry. They are typically calculated to
next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). The
transverse momentum scale up to which the DGLAP equations are used to
define the q2 dependence of PDFs is called the factorisation scale, q2F . This
is defined as the scale which separates the long and short distance physics
discussed in Section 2.3.1, i.e. emitted partons with momentum < q2F are
considered soft-processes, absorbed into the hadronic structure described by
PDFs. Partons with momenta above the factorisation scale are part of the
short-distance, hard scatter cross-section. The combination of the two dis-
tinct momentum regions to form the full hadronic cross-section is known as
factorisation and is discussed in the following section.
The PDF description (before DGLAP evolution) of non-perturbative, soft-
QCD effects (such as fragmentation, hadronisation processes and multiple-
parton interactions) within a given collision at the LHC must be informed by
empirical models from data.
2.3.3 Hard Scatter and Factorisation Theorem
As discussed in previous sections, the highest energy processes (above the
factorisation scale, q2F ) in a hadron-hadron collision are known as the hard-
scatters. They occur at short distances, where s is small enough to allow the
perturbative calculation of the parton-parton interaction cross-section (ij),
while all other lower energy processes are absorbed by the PDFs of the protons
in the collision. Therefore, the full hadronic cross-section for a physics process
can be expressed via the factorisation theorem as:
2.4. W AND Z BOSON PRODUCTION 21
dx1dx2fi(x1, q
F )fj(x2, q
F )ij
p1, p2, s(q
(2.30)
where the sum over i, j is a sum over all available partons. fi,j(x1,2, q
F ) are
the PDFs of the partons evaluated at the factorisation scale, p1 and p2 are
the momenta of the partons involved in the hard interaction, and q2 is the
momentum scale of the hard scatter. The renormalisation scale, q2R, is the
momentum scale chosen to prevent divergences in QCD calculations arising
from the running coupling strength of s, as discussed in Section 2.3.1. To
avoid very large logarithms appearing in the perturbative calculations of ij,
the factorisation and renormalisation scales are chosen to be of the order of
the momentum scale of the hard scatter, i.e. typically qF = qR = q.
2.4 W and Z Boson Production
The W and Z0 gauge bosons were first observed at UA1 and UA2 at CERN
in 1983 (via pp collisions) [11, 12]. They are the force mediators of the charged
(W) and neutral (Z0) current weak interactions, and couple to all fermions.
The Standard Model decay widths of the W and Z0 (W=2.08 GeV and
Z=2.50 GeV) are comparatively small against their masses (given in Table
2.3), so they are considered relatively stable. W and Z0 (referred to from now
on as W and Z) can decay both leptonically and hadronically, Tables 2.4 and
2.5 give an overview of the decay modes and branching fractions (the fraction
of bosons which decay by a specific decay mode) for W and Z respectively. The
total cross-section for a given final state is therefore found by multiplying the
vector boson production cross-section by the relevant branching ratio (BR),
for example:
(qq  Z  l+l) = (qq  Z)BR(Z  l+l) (2.31)
22 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
The W and Z production cross-sections can be derived by treating them
as Drell-Yan2 cross-sections, with the subprocess qq    l+l replaced
by qq  W  l and qq  Z  l+l respectively. At lowest order, the
cross-section for the Drell-Yan mechanism mediated by a photon is expressed
q(p1)q(p2) l+l
Q2q (2.32)
where Q2q is the quark energy, s is the centre of mass energy, (p1 +p2)
2,  is the
electromagnetic coupling and the 1/N term arises as an average over the colour
states of initial quarks (only quarks and antiquarks of the same colour can
annihilate). Equation 2.32 can be extended to express the production of either
a lepton pair or a lepton and a neutrino by quark-antiquark annihilation. For
example, at energies around the Z mass, MZ , terms for s-channel Z exchange
are added to Equation 2.32 which becomes:
q(p1)q(p2) l+l
42s
Q2q2QqVlVq1(s)+(A
l )(A
q )2(s)
(2.33)
where A and V are the axial and vector couplings of quarks and leptons to
Z. 1 and 2 represent the Z/
 interference and the Z exchange amplitude
respectively, given by:
1(s) = 
s(sM2Z)
(sM2Z)2 + 
(2.34)
2(s) = 
(sM2Z)2 + 
(2.35)
(2.36)
2The Drell-Yan process describes quark-antiquark annihilation (arising from hadron-
hadron scattering) creating a virtual photon or Z, which in turn decay into a pair of leptons
of opposite charge.
2.4. W AND Z BOSON PRODUCTION 23
where GF is the Fermi constant. At s  M2Z , the 2 term dominates in
Equation 2.33. Furthermore, as a result of the aforementioned small Z decay
width, the narrow width approximation allows us to replace the Breit-Wigner
distribution in 2 with a delta function, i.e:
(sM2Z)2 +M
(sM2Z) (2.37)
Finally, integrating over lepton-pair masses aroundMZ (since the quark-antiquark
pairs will have a spectrum of centre of mass energies) yields:
 (MZ+)2
(MZ)2
q + V
(Z  l+l)
(sM2Z)
= (qq  Z)BR(Z  l+l)
(2.38)
where |M MZ |<  and Z <<  << MZ , (Z  l+l) is the decay width
of the Z to leptons only. From Equation 2.38 (and setting N = 3) we can
extract the cross-section for Z production from quark-antiquark annihilation:
(qq  Z) =
q + V
q )(sM
Z) (2.39)
Similarly, the analogous cross-section for W production is found to be:
qq
W =
W |Vqq|
2(sM2W ) (2.40)
where in this case Vqq relates to the probability of transition between q and
q, i.e the relevant element of the CKM mixing matrix between quark families
[13, 14]. In this treatment of the cross-section for W production the narrow
width approximation has once again been used to replace the Breit-Wigner
distribution with a delta function. Under this approximation the transverse
mass distribution for W decay is cut at MW . In practice W is finite and thus
the endpoint of the transverse mass distribution extends beyond MW .
In high energy hadron-hadron collisions at the LHC, the final state of the
hard scatter process will often contain extra quark-antiquark pairs or gluons.

Thus, the picture painted above is somewhat complicated both theoretically
and experimentally. The following sections outline the theoretical approach to
such final state objects and the experimental tools developed to measure the
cross-sections of such processes.
2.4.1 Production with Associated Hadronic Jets
The final state of a hard scatter process in which a W or Z is produced, and
decays into two leptons, can also include extra coloured partons, i.e. quarks
and gluons. At high energies, quark-antiquark pairs begin to separate and
2.4. W AND Z BOSON PRODUCTION 25

Coulomb field (between an e+e pair) with V (r)  1/r (right).
the running of the strong coupling constant is such that the coupling strength
between the two quarks increases with distance (as discussed in Section 2.3.1).
The virtual gluons mediating the force between the separating quarks also
carry colour charge and consequently self-interact, the effect of which is a
squeezing of the gluon field between the quarks into a narrow flux tube (or
QCD string). This is in contrast with QED for which there is no self-interaction
of the mediating photons and therefore nothing preventing the Coulomb field
lines between two electric charges spreading out, Figure 2.1 represents this
pictorially.
The energy density per unit length of the so-called colour tube is constant.
Therefore, with increasing distance, r, between the separating quarks, so does
the potential energy of the two quark system increase, i.e. V (r)  r. This is
the reason why quarks are not observed in free states, rather exist in combined
colour singlet states as colourless hadrons, the phenomenon formally known
as colour confinement. As the quarks continue to separate, and their po-
tential energy increases, it becomes energetically favourable to emit another
quark-antiquark pair, in a direction almost collinear with the parent quark.
The emission of the quark-antiquark pair occurs via the radiation of a gluon.
In this way, the colour tube is fragmented into two shorter tubes as the colour

field experienced between the initial quarks is screened by the newly created
pair. This process of fragmentation (depicted in Figure 2.2) is known as parton
showering. The parton shower continues as the quark-antiquark pairs separate
and in turn produce further pairs, each time of decreasing energy. What re-
mains is a collimated jet of low-momentum quarks and gluons which combine
(due to colour confinement, and via hadronisation) to colourless hadrons.
Jets of hadrons are what is experimentally observed in a particle detector.
They provide a very powerful tool by which we can infer the existence of final
state quarks and gluons from a hard scatter process. Section 2.5 describes
how hadronic jets are experimentally defined and how jet-finding algorithms
are used to detect them.
2.4.2 Multi-jet Cross-Sections
Figure 2.3 shows the subprocess by which a W or Z is produced in a hadron-
hadron collision in association with 1 hadronic jet from a final state gluon.
In the case of W production, the factorised hadronic cross-section calcu-
lation for W+1j can be rearranged and expressed as an integral over phase
space:
dq2dydP 2T
dygfu(x1, q
2)fd(x2, q
(2.41)
2.4. W AND Z BOSON PRODUCTION 27

where PT is transverse momentum, s is the centre-of-mass energy, and y is the
quantity known as rapidity, defined as:
Ei + Pi,z
Ei  Pi,z
(2.42)
The cross-section calculation contains matrix elements of the form:
|MudW+g|2 (
t2 + u2 + 2q2s
) (2.43)
where s = sud, t = sug and u = sdg, thus the PT of the gluon is expressed
as P 2T = tu/s. Problems arise when the final state parton is either collinear
with the initial quarks, or becomes soft (Eparton  0), leading to t = 0 or
u = 0. In these cases, the calculations contain divergences at the singularities
(those from soft partons are termed infrared divergences). In order to avoid
such divergences, restrictions are imposed on the phase space over which the
cross-section is calculated. This can be illustrated by considering the integral
over phase space of Equation 2.41 in the limit where s q2 and the PT of the
W is small. Here Equation 2.41 can be approximated to:
d2dydP 2T
log(s/P 2T )
(2.44)
From the above it is clear that unless a minimum PT requirement on the
gluon is applied (PTmin), Equation 2.43 will diverge. Therefore, the cross-
section result becomes proportional to log(s/P 2Tmin). The full perturbative
28 CHAPTER 2. THEORY

expansion for W+1j calculations at high energies is thus an expansion in
slog(. . . ). The logarithm takes arguments dependent upon the jet defini-
tion parameters, e.g. the aforementioned minimum PT , jet cone size and jet
separation. The significance of the latter two quantities becomes clear when
considering the process shown in Figure 2.4, where the event can be recon-
structed as containing 0, 1 or 2 jets, depending on how a jet is defined.
Following the treatment of cross-section calculations outlined above, the
full cross-section for the production of a W or Z boson, in association with
hadronic jets, can be built from the sum of its multi-jet components, e.g:
W = W+0j + W+1j + W+2j + W+3j + . . . (2.45)
where:
W+0j = a0 + sa1 + 
sa2 + . . . (2.46)
W+1j = sb1 + 
sb2 + . . . (2.47)
W+2j = 
sc2 + . . . (2.48)
and ai, bi, ci are the logarithmic functions discussed above. Finally, it is
worthy of note that while the perturbative expansions are dependent upon the
jet definition parameters, the sum at each order is independent.
2.5. JET RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS 29
2.5 Jet Reconstruction Algorithms
At the level of experiment, final state partons can only be inferred by the
measurement of jets of hadrons which deposit energy in the calorimeters of
a particle detector. In order to make valid comparisons between measured
data and theoretical predictions, hadronic jets must be defined and measured
in a consistent way across parton, hadron and detector levels. The general
principle of a jet algorithm is to form a jet by combining final state hadrons
and summing their 4-momenta.
There are certain general requirements that a successful jet algorithm must
satisfy, such as being as independent of detector effects as possible. Addition-
ally, the output of the algorithm must be invariant when treating soft and
collinear partons in order to avoid divergences in cross-section calculations, of
the type discussed in Section 2.4.2. This requirement is important not only
in the theoretical treatment described above, but also experimentally since
detectors cannot resolve either soft or collinear jets.
Jet algorithms can be broadly categorised by how the combination of final
state hadrons is approached. There are two main types of jet algorithm: cone
and cluster algorithms.
2.5.1 Cone Algorithms
Cone algorithms take a relatively simple approach to combining jet constituents:
a seed particle above a specific PT threshold is chosen within a cone of radius
R and the 4-momenta of all particles that fall within the cone are summed.
This procedure forms a trial jet, the direction of which becomes the axis
for a redefined cone, and again all particles within the cone are combined and
the 4-momentum of the trial jet is recalculated. Iterations continue until the
direction of the jet is unchanged and is thus considered stable.
Complications arise when two cones overlap, in this case a split-merge
procedure is applied by which jets that share hadrons are either merged into
30 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
one jet or the shared hadron is assigned to the jet whose axis it is closest to.
This decision is made on the basis of a threshold parameter, this is a function
of the percentage of PT shared between the overlapping jets. The split-merge
procedure is affected by soft partons, rendering cone algorithms exposed to
infrared divergences and thus unfavourable for comparisons between data and
theory.
2.5.2 Cluster Algorithms
The preferred approach at the LHC is to employ cluster jet algorithms. The
idea is to recombine pairs of hadrons into one until all final state hadrons have
been considered. Distance parameters dij and diB are defined to determine
which particles are to be combined to form a jet. dij represents the distance
between particles i and j, and diB represents the distance between particle i
and the LHC beam. They are defined as:
dij = min(P
(Rij)
(2.49)
diB = P
(2.50)
where p and R are parameters of the algorithm. Rij is defined as:
(Rij)
2 = (yi  yj)2 + (i  j)2 (2.51)
In the above equations i is the azimuthal angle of particle i and y is rapidity.
For a set value of the radius parameter R, dij and diB are calculated for all
pairs of objects and the smallest distance is determined. If this is dij, objects
i and j are combined into one pseudo jet, if diB is the smallest value then i
is considered a complete jet and removed from the list of objects. dij and diB
are then recalculated and the procedure repeats until all objects have been
removed.
The choice of parameter p influences the relative influence of the energy to
geometrical scales. This will of course influence the recombination procedure
2.6. MONTE CARLO GENERATORS 31
and algorithms of this type can be subcategorised according to their choice of
p. p=1 yields the k algorithm [15], this implementation merges the softest
objects first and works backwards to merge the hardest objects. In this way
it attempts to approximate a reversal of parton showering, as described in
Section 2.4.1. Choosing p=0, as in the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm [16],
removes any dependence on the PT of an object, so objects that have the
smallest R are merged first. It is sensitive to the distribution of soft objects
and often produces jets with irregular shapes. Finally, a choice of p=-1 yields
the anti-k jet algorithm [17] which proceeds by merging hard objects then
successively combining softer objects in the region R < R of the hard object.
The means that for anti-k, the shape of the final complete jets is unaffected
by soft constituents. The jets will therefore be very well defined and roughly
circular in the y   plane. This feature leads to easier calibration with the
calorimeters of a detector. For this reason, anti-k algorithms are favoured by
the ATLAS experiment and anti-k with a radius parameter of 0.4 are used
for jet definition and selection throughout the analysis described in this thesis.
Figure 2.5 shows a comparison between the three different types of recom-
bination jet algorithms, and one cone algorithm (SISCone). Each had the same
particle inputs and value of the R parameter. All four reconstruct the same
two jets with the highest PT (shown in red and green), but the particles that
comprise the jets differs between each algorithm. This means that the shape
of the jets is quite varied, the uniform shape of the anti-k algorithm jets is
particularly clear, compared to the rather irregular shape of the k algorithm
jets.
2.6 Monte Carlo Generators
Monte Carlo generators are computer programs designed to simulate real
physics processes according to a particular theoretical model, and to calcu-
late the cross-section of said process within a defined kinematic region. The
32 CHAPTER 2. THEORY

sample parton-level event (generated with HERWIG [18]) with many additional random
soft particles [19].
2.6. MONTE CARLO GENERATORS 33
simulations use random number generators to perform phase space integra-
tions, thereby randomly sampling the cross-section over phase space.
For proton-proton collisions a generator proceeds on an event-by-event ba-
sis by first modelling the hard sub-process, then adding initial and final state
bremstrahlung radiation via gluons. This is followed by the parton showers (re-
sulting from bremstrahlung), their hadronisation, and the subsequent decay of
the colourless hadrons. Finally, interactions and decays of all proton remnants
(known as the underlying event) are simulated. The 4-vector information of
all simulated particles is outputted.
This is the first stage of Monte Carlo event simulation, what remains is
to account for detector effects (i.e. the interaction of particles in the volume
of the detector). This is achieved by passing the hadron level objects (as 4-
vectors) through a simulation (GEANT4 [20] in the case of ATLAS) of the
materials in the detector and their location. The final output of this stage
is in the same format as raw data collected by the detector (e.g. as charges
measured on tracker wires, electronic pulses in the calorimeter anodes etc.)
and can therefore be reconstructed in the same way as raw data. In this way,
a full simulation of how an event would be observed in the detector is achieved.
The Monte Carlo events can then be used in an analysis for direct comparison
between theoretical models and experimental data.
A number of different generators are available, each of which simulate dif-
ferent theoretical models by employing different matrix elements, PDFs, evolu-
tion equations and models for parton showering and hadronisation. One of the
aims of the analysis presented in this thesis is to provide a precise test of how
well certain state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (as implemented through
Monte Carlo generators) describe the measured data, in the region of per-
turbative QCD. The generators most pertinent to this analysis are described
below. HERWIG, ALPGEN and SHERPA are all leading-order Monte Carlo
generators.
34 CHAPTER 2. THEORY
2.6.1 HERWIG
HERWIG is a general-purpose event generator for high energy processes which
places a particular emphasis on detailed simulation of parton showers. The
evolution of the parton shower is ordered angularly and a cluster model for
jet hadronisation is utilised. HERWIG v6.520 [18] (as used in this analysis)
requires an interface with JIMMY v4.31 [21] to provide the underlying event
modelling, but HERWIG++, contains an in-built underlying event algorithm.
2.6.2 ALPGEN
ALPGEN is specifically designed to model hard processes with multiple par-
tons in hadronic collisions. Events with up to 6 final state partons are sim-
ulated via leading-order matrix elements, yielding a very useful tool for the
study of final states with several hard and well separated jets. In the analy-
sis presented in this thesis ALPGEN v2.13 [22] (employing CTEQ6L1 PDFs
[23]) is used and is interfaced with both HERWIG v6.520 (to provide the par-
ton shower and fragmentation modelling) and JIMMY v4.31 (to model the
underlying event).
2.6.3 SHERPA
SHERPA is a general-purpose tool for the calculation of both hard scattering
processes within the Standard Model and also various new physics models.
Like ALPGEN, it employs leading-order matrix elements to calculate the cross-
section of processes with multiple hard jets in the final state. However, it differs
from ALPGEN in that it utilises self-contained algorithms for the modelling of
the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event. SHERPA v1.4.0 [24]
(with CT10 PDFs [25]) is used in this analysis.
2.6. MONTE CARLO GENERATORS 35
2.6.4 BLACKHAT
BLACKHAT [26, 27, 28] is an automated program for performing next-to-
leading order (NLO) QCD calculations for events with high final state mul-
tiplicity. It provides perturbative QCD predictions for W and Z production
in association with up to 4 jets via the computation of virtual one-loop am-
plitudes. BLACKHAT is combined with SHERPA, which provides the real
emission part of the calculation.
The inclusion of NLO calculations in theoretical predictions of W+jets and
Z+jets production has the advantage of greatly reducing the factorisation and
renormalisation dependencies suffered by leading-order predictions.

The LHC and The ATLAS
Detector
3.1 The LHC
Located at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) on the
Franco-Swiss border, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator
of 26.7 km circumference situated underground, at depths between 45-170 m
below surface level. It is primarily designed to collide proton beams at a peak
centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. The protons must first undergo a series of
accelerations to increase their energy and create the bunches of which the beam
is comprised. The process begins with LinacII, a linear accelerator in which the
application of an electric field ionises hydrogen atoms to yield free protons that
are subsequently accelerated to an energy of 50 MeV. The energetic protons
are then injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), an intermediary
circular accelerator that increases the proton energy to 1.4 GeV before injection
into the larger Proton Synchrotron (PS). The PS squeezes the proton beam
into bunches with 2 ns separation and accelerates the protons to an energy of
25 GeV. The final stage before entering the main LHC ring is injection into a
larger synchrotron known as the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), the purpose

of which is to accelerate the protons to 450 GeV before entering into the LHC as
two beams circulating in opposite directions. Radio frequency cavities within
the LHC are used to accelerate the protons. The cavities contain electric fields
which accelerate charged particles that pass through them. Superconducting
dipole magnets provide a strong magnetic field to steer the accelerated protons
around the LHC ring and quadrupole magnets focus the beam as it circulates.
Once the desired beam energy is achieved, extra fine tuning is employed to
focus and collide the two beams at 4 interaction points on the LHC ring.
The interaction points correspond to the site of 4 particle detectors: ATLAS,
CMS, LHCb and ALICE. The former two are general-purpose detectors, while
the latter two have designs optimised for the study of specific physics: the
properties of B mesons, and heavy-ion collisions respectively. Figure 3.1 shows
a schematic of the LHC, including an overview of the various sub-accelerators
discussed above.
The rate of production, R, of a given physics process is related to the corre-
sponding cross-section1 () by R = L, where L is the instantaneous luminos-

ity, a quantity proportional to the beam intensity. The total luminosity is the
time integration of instantaneous luminosity. A large instantaneous luminos-
ity is desirable, particularly when studying processes with small cross-sections.
This can be achieved by increasing 3 quantities; the number of bunches, the
proton density per bunch or the beam focus. Instantaneous luminosity is re-
lated to the number of bunches (nb), the number of protons in the colliding
bunches (n1, n2), and the horizontal and vertical widths of the beam profile
(x and y respectively) by L = nbfrn1n22xy , where fr is the rotation frequency of
the beam. The challenge presented with increased instantaneous luminosity
is the increase in particle interactions occurring simultaneously with the hard
scatter process in which we are interested, otherwise known as pile-up events.
This relation is illustrated in Figure 3.2, as the peak luminosity increases over
time, so does the peak number of interactions per crossing.
3.2 The ATLAS Detector
A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) is a general-purpose detector located
at one of the collision points on the LHC ring. ATLAS has a very broad
physics programme and is designed to observe many particles with high pre-
cision, which in turns facilitates the inference of those particles that cannot
be directly detected. The detector consists of four major components, mov-
ing out from the interaction point they are: the Inner Detector used for high
precision tracking of charged particles close to the interaction point, the Elec-

tromagnetic and Hadronic Calorimeters for measuring the energy deposits of
electrons/photons and hadrons respectively, and the Muon Spectrometer for
identifying and measuring muons. Figure 3.3 depicts the arrangement of the
above components in the detector.
Momentum measurements of charged particles are achieved through the
ATLAS magnet system: the solenoid magnet which encloses the Inner Detector
and the toroidal magnet system contained within the Muon Spectrometer. The
magnets serve the purpose of bending the trajectory of charged particles. The
curvature of the bent track is proportional to the momentum of the particle
and the direction of curvature reveals its charge.
3.2.1 Coordinate System
The ATLAS detector employs a right-handed coordinate system. The z-axis
is defined along the beam pipe, positive in a anti-clockwise direction around
the LHC ring. The x-y plane is perpendicular to the z-axis (intersecting at
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 41
0), positive x points towards the centre of the LHC ring and positive y points
upwards. Transverse quantities2, such as momentum (PT ) and energy (ET ),
are defined in the x-y plane, i.e. perpendicular to the beam line. The azimuthal
angle, , covers the range [-,+] around the beam pipe, measuring =0 along
x-axis and increasing clockwise when looking in the direction of positive z. The
polar angle, , is the angle from the beam axis, it is more commonly expressed
in relation to pseudorapidity,  = -ln(tan(/2)).  is an approximation of
rapidity3, y, in which zero particle mass is assumed, i.e. in the high-energy
limit.  is a preferred coordinate in particle physics because particle production
from the interaction point is approximately constant as a function of 
The impact parameters d0 and z0 are respectively the transverse distance
to the beam axis and the z position of a track, both measured at the point of
closest approach [32].
3.2.2 The Inner Detector
The innermost component of the ATLAS detector is the Inner Detector (ID),
contained within the central solenoid magnet which provides a nominal mag-
netic field of 2 T. As mentioned above, the magnetic field bends the trajectory
of charged particles passing through the ID and thus allows measurements of
particle momentum and charge.
The ID consists of three subcomponents, moving out from the centre they
are; silicon pixel detectors, semiconductor tracking (SCT) detectors and tran-
sition radiation (TRT) detectors. The arrangement of the inner detector sub-
components is shown in Figure 3.4. The LHC produces very high track den-
2Transverse quantities are used because in LHC collisions there will be momentum along
the beam axis left over from the beam particles (since protons are composite particles). So
the transverse quantities will give the only reasonable measure of objects from interacting
partons.

sities at the interaction points, therefore the fine-granularity pixel and SCT
detectors are employed at the inner radii to ensure high resolution for mo-
mentum and vertex measurements. The TRT provides continuous tracking in
the outer radii of the ID. The combination of detectors in the ID facilitates
high precision momentum measurements, pattern recognition and both pri-
mary and secondary vertex measurements for charged tracks above a nominal
PT threshold of approximately 0.5 GeV. In addition, the ID provides electron
identification over ||< 2 and between energies of 0.5 GeV and 150 GeV [34].
The ID covers an angular range of || 2.5 [35].
3.2.2.1 The Pixel Detector
Designed to provide high precision measurements, the Pixel Detector lies in the
region closest to the interaction point. This highly modular detector consists
of 1744 silicon-pixel sensors, each sensor contains 47232 pixels, has a thickness
of 250 m, and dimensions 1963 mm. 90% of the pixels are of nominal size
50400 m, the remainder lie in the regions of the front-end readout chips on
the pixel sensor and are larger (50600 m). The pixel sensors are overlapped
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 43
and mounted on staves which are arranged to form thee concentric barrels at
radii 50.5, 88.5 and 122.5 mm, thus providing three precision measurements per
particle track. The ||<2.5 angular coverage of the pixel detector is completed
with end-caps on each side of the barrel.
The fine-granularity of this section of the ID determines the resolution on
the impact parameters (z0 and d0) and the ability to detect the secondary
vertexes from the decay of short-lived particles, such as B hadrons and  -
leptons (important for heavy flavour and  -tagging respectively) [36].
3.2.2.2 The Semiconductor Tracker
Surrounding the Pixel Detector are a series of silicon micro-strip detectors
that comprise the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT). The SCT is built from 4088
modules, the modules consist of four silicon detectors of dimension 636640
mm, with a thickness of 28515 m and a strip pitch of 80 m. On each
module, two silicon detectors are aligned in the azimuthal angle, , that provide
measurements in R. Two such pairs are set back-to-back at a stereo angle
of 40 mrad to provide a measurement in z. The spatial resolution of each
module in the barrel is 17 m in R  and 580 m in z, the resolution in the
end-caps is 17 m in R  and 580 m in R [37]. The double-sided modules
are arranged on four concentric carbon fibre cylinders that carry the cooling
system, at radii of 299, 371, 443 and 514 mm. This forms 8 silicon detector
layers providing 8 measurements per particle track [38]. End-caps complete
the ||<2.5 angular coverage of the SCT.
The SCT provides precision track measurements in the R  and z coor-
dinates, and contributes to the measurements of the Pixel Detector. Together
the two sub-detectors are referred to as the Precision Tracker [39].
44 CHAPTER 3. THE LHC AND THE ATLAS DETECTOR
3.2.2.3 Lorentz Angle in The SCT
As mentioned in the previous section, the Inner Detector is surrounded by a
solenoid magnet that produces a nominal magnetic field of 2 T. The presence
of a very strong magnetic field means that charge-carrying particles passing
through the silicon detectors in the SCT will experience a Lorentz force, caus-
ing them to drift. The Lorentz angle, L, is the angle by which the charge
carriers are deflected. It is dependent on their mobility and the size of the
external magnetic field. For a magnetic field B, L is expressed as:
tanL = HB = dB (3.1)
where H is the Hall mobility
4, d is the drift mobility of the charge carrier
and  is the Hall factor (of the order 1). The mobility is dependent on the
bias voltage of the silicon sensors and their temperature, L is therefore also
dependent on these quantities. Theoretical values for L, for SCT layers 0, 1
and 2 (which have a temperature -2C) and layer 3 (at 4.5C), are 3.880.28
and 3.710.27 respectively. These predictions were reached via the Jacoboni-
Calani model for drift mobility [40, 41].
When a charged particle passes through the SCT, the number of adjacent
strips (per layer and per module) that are hit is known as the cluster size. For
a zero magnetic field this quantity should be at a minimum when the incident
angle, , is zero ( is measured in the plane defined by the normal to the wafer
and the axis perpendicular to the strip direction). When a magnetic field is
present and the Lorentz force causes the charged particles to drift, the cluster
size minimum will no longer be at zero, rather at L. The Lorentz angle can
thus be extracted by considering the mean number of strip hits in an event,
i.e. the cluster width, against  and performing a fit to find the value of  for
4Mobility is a quantity that characterises how quickly an electron or hole (the mathe-
matical opposite of an electron, i.e. the absence of an electron) can move through a metal or
semiconductor. Mobility is most commonly measured via the Hall effect, and the resultant
measurement known as the Hall mobility.
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 45
which the cluster width is minimum.
Track Selection: The track selection on data was designed to be loose to
ensure a statistically significant sample of good quality tracks. The drift di-
rection of charged particles passing through the silicon detectors in the SCT
end-cap modules is almost perpendicular to the magnetic field. Therefore, the
Lorentz force experienced by a particle in the end-caps, and the resultant drift,
will be negligible. For this reason only tracks in the barrel were included in
the data to be fitted. The track selection was as follows:
 Track PT > 500 MeV.
 |d0 with respect to the primary vertex|< 1mm.
 At least 7 hits in the SCT barrel.
 At least 1 hit in the Pixel Detector.
 Negatively charged tracks only: due to the angle at which the silicon
sensors are tilted with respect to the beam axis, only negative tracks
have a minimum in cluster size. Positive tracks will have an incident
angle greater than zero.
Silicon Sensors of Differing Crystal Orientation: The majority of
modules in the SCT are comprised of silicon sensors with <111> crystal ori-
entation (see Figure 3.5). However, a small number of modules (93) have
sensors with <100> orientation. The latter have a fairly even distribution in
 throughout the SCT barrel. Figure 3.6 is an  map showing the position
of the sensors with <100> crystal orientation. Due to the different orientation
of the silicon crystal plane, it is expected that the Lorentz angle for <100>
sensors will be different than for <111> sensors. The data sample was split
into two subsamples: those with <111> sensors and those with <100> sensors.
The Lorentz angle was extracted separately for each.
Fit: The fitting function used to find the minimum of the cluster width (the
distribution is as a function of ) was an empirical function used in previous
studies [42], and took the form:

where L, a, b and  are four free parameters of the fit, corresponding
to the Lorentz angle, the gradient of the distribution, the minimum cluster
width and the smearing effect (from diffusion of electric charge in the silicon
modules) respectively. The fit was performed between a  range of [-9, 2]
degrees. The choice of fit range was arrived at following an optimisation study
described in [42]. As mentioned above, the SCT barrel modules are arranged on
double sided staves in three concentric layers, therefore the fit was performed
separately for each side and layer, yielding a separate Lorentz angle for each.
Figure 3.7 shows the fits for the sample of <111> and <100> modules.
Systematic Uncertainty: A systematic uncertainty on this method was
derived by performing the analysis on data from cosmic rays passing through

Cosmics B-Off data (All sides and layers)

The fit was performed on a combined profile of all sides and layers. The error bar on this
measurement is the statistical error from the fit.
the detector when the magnetic field was turned off. Under these conditions,
the Lorentz angle is expected to be zero across all sides and layers. Therefore,
the offset from zero of the result obtained by fitting to this data can be taken
as a systematic uncertainty on the procedure of the Lorentz angle extraction.
Cosmic ray data from all SCT sides and layers were combined to increase
statistics and the fit was performed as described above. The Lorentz angle
extracted from the fit is shown in Figure 3.8, a clear offset from zero can be
seen. From this result, two systematic bounds were considered; a lower bound
which corresponded to the offset of the data point from 0 ( 7%) and a more
conservative upper bound corresponding to the offset of the upper statistical
error band on this result from 0 ( 11.5%).
Lorentz Angle Results: Figure 3.9 shows the values of the Lorentz an-
gle extracted for each side/layer and for <111> and <100> modules, with the
lower and upper systematic uncertainty bands. The Lorentz angle values do
not agree well with the model prediction. Only a few data points are just con-
sistent with the model within the upper systematic band. It is understood that

the Jacoboni-Canali model is applicable only for silicon with <111> crystal
orientation and inadequately describes the drift mobility for <100> sensors.
The remaining large discrepancy between the Lorentz angle for <111> sensors
and the Jacoboni-Canali model prediction is yet to be understood. A sepa-
rate study using a different model for mobility (the Becker-Fretwurst-Klanner
model [43]) has been conducted. The Becker-Fretwurst-Klanner model is ap-
plicable to both <111> and <100> sensors, but large discrepancies with data
are still observed for the Lorentz angle5. The large amount of data provided
by the LHC presents a unique opportunity for deeper understanding of the
predictions mentioned above.
3.2.2.4 The Transition Radiation Tracker
The final component of the Inner Detector is the Transition Radiation Tracker
(TRT). The TRT is based on straw drift tube detectors: 4 mm diameter tubes
filled with a gas mixture of 70% Xe, 27% CO2 and 3% O2. Each tube acts
as the cathode and contains a coaxial anode; tungsten wire of 31 m diam-
5Studies are ongoing to understand the discrepancies, including interaction with the
authors of both predictions.
50 CHAPTER 3. THE LHC AND THE ATLAS DETECTOR
eter plated with 0.5-0.7 m of gold. Approximately 50,000 straws, 144 cm
in length, are arranged around the barrel in 36 layers (providing 36 measure-
ments) between radii of 554 and 1082 mm, and are embedded in a matrix of
polypropylene fibres [44].
A charged particle passing through the straw will ionise the gas within,
allowing drift time measurements of the liberated electrons to the central an-
ode. In this way, each straw of the TRT provides a spatial resolution of 130
m. Charged particles with relativistic energies passing from one material to
another, with a different refractive index, undergo a change in velocity and
produce transition radiation in the form of photons. In this way, a particle
passing through the TRT from the drift straws to the polypropylene fibres will
emit transition radiation. The amount of radiation emitted is proportional
to the change in velocity of the particle and as such can be used to identify
type of particles, e.g. an electron passing through the TRT will produce more
radiation than a hadron. The output electronic channels of the TRT have two
independent thresholds; a lower threshold used for tracking hits, and a higher
threshold used to identify photons from transition radiation.
Despite the coarser granularity (with respect to the Pixel Detector and the
SCT) and thus lower precision of the subdetector, the TRT contributes to the
tracking and momentum measurements of the Inner Detector, by providing a
large surface area which increases the track length and the number of hits in the
detector. The ability of the inner detector to identify electrons is augmented
by measurements of transition radiation.
3.2.3 Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The ATLAS calorimetry is divided into two major subdetectors; the Electro-
magnetic Calorimeter (ECal) and the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal). Closest
to the interaction point, the ECal consists of alternating layers of absorber
and detector material, lead and liquid argon (LAr) respectively. The layers
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 51
are arranged in an accordion-shaped geometry, providing full symmetry in 
without azimuthal cracks.
When a charged particle traverses the absorber material, it loses energy via
Bremsstrahlung radiation due to deflection in atomic fields. Photons emitted
via Bremsstrahlung will interact with the detector atoms and lose energy via
production of e+e pairs, which will in turn cause ionisation in the LAr volume.
This process continues as a cascade of increasingly low energy photons and
electrons, yielding an electromagnetic shower across many layers of the ECal.
The ECal covers the  range ||< 3.2 and, as for the ID, is divided into
barrel (||< 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < ||< 3.2) components. The barrel
is comprised of two half barrels separated by a gap of 4 mm at z=0. It has
a constant LAr gap thickness of 2.1 mm and a total thickness of over 24
radiation lengths (X0). Each end-cap consists of two coaxial wheels, the LAr
gap thickness increases with radius and the total thickness of the end-caps is
over 26 X0. There is a large amount of non-sensitive material at the boundary
between the ECal barrel and end-caps. This is defined as the crack region
of 1.37 < ||< 1.52 and is excluded from the electron channel selection of this
measurement (full details are given in Chapter 4).
The region of precision physics in ATLAS is ||< 2.5, in this region the ECal
is segmented into three longitudinal sampling sections. The    gran-
ularity of the sampling sections is 0.0030.01, 0.0250.025 and 0.050.025
[45]. The first of these sections is known as the strip section, it acts as a pre-
electromagnetic shower detector to enhance the separation in identification
between /0 and e/ and provide precision position measurements.
Preceding the ECal is a pre-sampling detector which consists of a LAr layer
of 1.1 mm thickness in the barrel and 0.5 mm in the end-caps. This acts to
correct for the energy lost by a charged particle in the material between the
interaction point and the front face of the ECal (a distance of around 2X0 for
||< 1.8) [45].
52 CHAPTER 3. THE LHC AND THE ATLAS DETECTOR
3.2.4 Hadronic Calorimeter
Surrounding the ECal is the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal), designed to measure
hadronic activity in the detector. The HCal covers the  range ||< 4.9 and
consists of three subcomponents; a scintillating tile barrel, LAr hadronic end-
caps (HEC) and a forward calorimeter (FCal, also made of LAr). The tile
barrel, HEC and FCal cover  ranges of ||< 1.0, 1.5 < ||< 3.2 and 3.1
< ||< 4.9 respectively. An extension to the tile barrel covers the range 0.8
< ||< 1.7.
The HCal works on a similar principle as the ECal, consisting of alter-
nating layers of absorber and active material. The former produces particle
interactions, resulting in cascades that are measured by ionisation of the latter.
Hadrons interact with the absorber material via the strong force producing a
cascade of hadrons. The resultant hadronic showers are larger than the elec-
tromagnetic equivalent. The HCal must be thick enough to contain hadronic
showers and reduce punch-through radiation into the Muon Spectrometer. The
HCal has a thickness of 11 radiation lengths (), sufficient to provide good res-
olution for high energy jets.
The tile region of the HCal is designed to provide precise measurements of
the angle and energy of hadronic jets. The tile barrel extends from a radius of
2.28 to 4.25 mm from the interaction point and consists of alternating layers of
iron absorber and plastic scintillating tiles of 3mm thickness. Two sides of the
scintillating tubes read out to photomultiplier tubes by wavelength-shifting
fibres. As in the ECal, the tile barrel is segmented into three longitudinal
sampling layers of 1.4, 4.0 and 1.8 , and    granularity of 0.10.1,
0.10.1 and 0.20.1 [46].
The HEC consists of two independent wheels positioned behind each end-
cap, and built from 32 identical wedge-shaped modules. The modules in the
wheel closest to the interaction point are made from 25 mm copper plates,
the outer wheel is made from 50 mm copper plates. The gap between the two
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 53

wheels is 8.5 mm and filled with LAr. Each of the wheels is divided into two
longitudinal segments of granularity; 0.10.1 for 1.5 < ||< 2.5, and 0.20.2
for 2.5 < ||< 3.2 [46].
The forward calorimeter (FCal) covers an  range of 3.1 < ||< 4.9. The
front end of the FCal is positioned 4.7 m from the interaction point. The FCal
consists of three modules; the first is made of copper and the remaining two are
made of tungsten, designed to measure electromagnetic and hadronic activity
respectively. Each module is a matrix of the relevant material, with regularly
spaced gaps filled with high positive voltage rods and grounded tubes, and LAr
in the gaps between. The FCal is used, among other measurements, to observe
forward jets in ATLAS. The FCal occupies a small volume within ATLAS, this
is compensated for by high density material. The FCal has a thickness of 10
Figure 3.10 shows a schematic of the ATLAS calorimetry, indicating the
position of the components discussed above.
54 CHAPTER 3. THE LHC AND THE ATLAS DETECTOR
3.2.5 Muon Spectrometer
The outermost component of ATLAS is the Muon Spectrometer, designed to
detect and make measurements of muons that traverse the preceding parts of
the detector whilst losing little energy. The Muon Spectrometer combines a
system of superconducting toroidal magnets with high precision muon tracking
ionisation chambers.
The magnet system provides a magnetic field that is mostly orthogonal to
the trajectory of the muon. Measurements of the momentum and charge of a
muon passing through the Muon Spectrometer are made on the same principle
as those of charged particles passing through the ID. The magnetic field serves
to bend the trajectory of a muon as it traverses the spectrometer, the track
curvature and direction yield the momentum and charge of the muon. The
magnets are divided into two sections; the large barrel toroid which covers an
 range of ||< 1.0, and the end-cap toroids covering 1.4 < ||< 2.7. In the
intermediate region between the barrel and end-cap toroids (1.0 < ||< 1.4)
muons are bent by both [48].
The tracking chambers in the barrel of the Muon Spectrometer cover ||<
1.0 and are arranged in three concentric cylinders around the beam pipe at
radii of 5, 7.5 and 10 m. The end-cap tracking chambers cover 1.0 < ||< 2.7
and are arranged vertically in four disks at 7, 10 and between 21-23 m from the
interaction point. The tracking chambers are of four types: Monitored Drift-
Tube chambers (MDTs), Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs), Resistive Plate
Chambers (RPCs) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs). The MDTs and CSCs
are used for precision tracking, whereas the RPCs and TGCs are used for
triggering in the barrel and end-caps respectively.
The MDTs cover an  range of ||< 2.7 and provide precision muon track
measurements. They consist of 30 mm diameter aluminium tubes of 400 m
thickness filled with a mixture of 93% Ar and 7% CO2, with a coaxial tungsten-
rhenium anode wire. The MDTs have a spatial resolution of 35 m in z and
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 55
measure the coordinates of the muon in the plane of bending. The CSCs
are positioned close to the interaction point and cover 2.0 < ||< 2.7. They
are equipped with high granularity to withstand the high particle flux in this
region of the detector. They are multi-wire proportional chambers filled with
a mixture of 80% Ar and 20% CO2 and achieve a spatial resolution of 50 m
in the plane of bending [49].
The RPC and TGC trigger chambers serve a number of purposes; to iden-
tify bunch-crossing, to trigger with a well defined PT and to measure a second
muon spatial coordinate in a direction orthogonal to that measured by the
chambers upstream [50]. The RPCs cover ||< 1.05 and provide triggering for
the Muon Spectrometer barrel. Like the MDTs, the RPCs are arranged in
three concentric cylinders to provide measurements within the magnetic field
and at the inner and outer field boundaries. The RPCs have a spatial reso-
lution of 10mm in z and . The TGCs cover ||> 1.4 and are positioned in
the end-caps. The position of the magnet cryostats in this region prevents
measurements inside the field volume, therefore the chambers are arranged to
perform a point-like measurement to determine muon momentum. The spatial
resolution of the TGCs is between 2-6 mm in R and between 3-7 mm in .
Figure 3.11 is a schematic in which the position of the various Muon Spec-
trometer components is shown.
3.2.6 Trigger System
When operating at design conditions, the LHC produces events at a rate of
around 40 MHz. This rate of data generation is too high for everything to
be recorded, therefore ATLAS employs a trigger system to reduce the rate of
data taking to a manageable level, at which data can be permanently recorded.
The general principle of the ATLAS trigger system is to reduce the rate of
selected events from 40 MHz to around 200 Hz by rejecting uninteresting
events, while retaining high trigger efficiencies for physics processes that are

muon chambers (top) [51] and their arrangement in the x-y plane (bottom) [52].
3.2. THE ATLAS DETECTOR 57
part of the ATLAS physics programme. The ATLAS trigger system is based
on three levels of online event selection; the hardware-based Level 1 (L1), and
the software-based Level 2 (L2) and Event Filter (EF). The latter two are
collectively known as the High Level Trigger (HLT). Each trigger level refines
the event selection by using more detailed detector information and taking
more time to make the decision of which events to keep and which to discard.
The hardware-based L1 trigger reduces the rate to about 75 kHz by making
an initial decision based on reduced granularity information from a subset of
detectors. Information from the calorimeters are used to search for high PT
electrons, photons, jets and taus, in addition to large ET and E
T . High
PT muons are searched for using information from the RPC and TGC trigger
chambers in the Muon Spectrometer, as mentioned in Section 3.2.5. The L1
trigger defines a Region of Interest (RoI) in  space around a selected object
and this information is seeded to the L2 trigger. Measured from the time of
collisions to the time of the trigger decision, the L1 trigger has a latency period
of approximately 2s [53].
The L2 trigger refines the decision made by the L1 trigger by using full
detector information to partially reconstruct events within the RoI and reduce
the rate to approximately 3.5 kHz. The selection rate for electrons is reduced
by requiring a match between a high PT track in the ID and one in the electro-
magnetic calorimeter. The muon selection rate is reduced by using the ID and
the precision muon chambers to sharpen the muon PT threshold. The latency
period for the L2 trigger is approximately 40 ms [53].
The final level of the trigger system is the Event Filter (EF) which further
refines and finalises the selection of physics objects from information seeded
from L2 and reduces the rate to around 200 Hz. The EF employs offline
algorithms adapted to an online environment, to allow for a near-full event
reconstruction, and has a latency period of around 4 s [53]. Events passing the
EF are then written to tape and stored for offline analysis.
The ATLAS trigger system has a central trigger processor which imple-

ments a trigger menu. The menu is a number of different triggers, each of
which designed to select specific physics objects. The final data rate of 200 Hz
is split among each of triggers on the menu. Due to limitations in bandwidth
many triggers are prescaled, i.e. only a fraction of the events that pass the
trigger are stored.
For the analysis presented in this thesis, separate triggers were used to
select electron and muon candidate events. The exact trigger used for each
selection was dependant on data taking period (more details in Section 4.2).
For electron candidate events the triggers used selected events with at least
one electron. Electron candidates were also required to have PT of at least 20
GeV (or 22 GeV, depending on data taking period) at the EF. Muon candidate
events were triggered on by requiring at least one muon with PT of at least 18
GeV at the EF.

Detector Level Study of W+jets
and Z+jets
The data used in this analysis were collected by the ATLAS detector dur-
ing proton-proton collisions conducted at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV
throughout the 2011 LHC data taking run. This dataset corresponds to an
integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb1. Data was collected during periods of stable
beam operation, with all ATLAS sub-detectors and magnets (detailed in the
previous section) fully operational. A good run list (GRL) [54] was imple-
mented as part of the event selection. It was required that the only runs used
were those during which all parts of the detector relevant to the analysis were
in stable operation. The GRL was common to W  l + jets and Z  ll +
jets selections in both the electron and muon channels.
4.1 Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulations were used in this analysis to model W  l + jets
and Z  ll + jets signal processes, and to subtract the contribution of cer-
tain background processes that still contaminate the data selected. Among the
background processes are other electroweak decays, whereby W+jets or Z+jets
events decay to a final state with a tau lepton (W  , Z  ). These pro-
60CHAPTER 4. DETECTOR LEVEL STUDY OF W+JETS AND Z+JETS
cesses contribute a source of fake leptons, either through the mismeasurement
of jets or leptonic tau decays. Another electroweak background are di-boson
events (those with WW, ZZ, WZ). Di-boson processes contribute a source of
background via missed extra leptons and also through jet mismeasurement.
Monte Carlo was also used for the simulation of Z  ll events that are
present as a background to the W  l selections. Fake EmissT can occur in an
event if a lepton is not reconstructed due to trigger or detector inefficiencies.
A lepton can also be missed if outside the detector acceptance. W  l events
were also treated as a background to the Z  ll selections.
W  l + jets and Z  ll + jets signal processes (and W  , Z 
 backgrounds), were simulated using ALPGEN v2.13 [22] interfaced with
HERWIG v6.520 [18] (to provide the parton shower) and to JIMMY v4.31
[21] (to model the contribution from the underlying event, using the AUET2-
CTEQ6L1 tune [55]). CTEQ6L1 [23] PDFs were employed and the PHOTOS
program [56] was used to simulate final state QED radiation in ALPGEN.
Di-boson processes were simulated using HERWIG with the AUET2-LO**
(MRSTMCal) tune [55]. Signal samples for V+jets processes generated using
SHERPA v1.40 with CT10 [25] PDFs were also used for comparison to the
ALPGEN signal samples1.
Events with a single top quark in the final state present a small source
of background contamination to the signal sample. Single top backgrounds
(including Wt production) were simulated using ACERMC [57] interfaced with
PYTHIA [58].
As discussed in Section 2.6, all samples were passed through the GEANT4
full simulation of the ATLAS detector and trigger. The full analysis selection
described in Section 4.2 was then applied to each of the samples, after which
they were normalised to data luminosity (4.6 fb1). Table 4.1 presents an
overview of the Monte Carlo samples use in this analysis.
All Monte Carlo samples were normalised to the inclusive cross-section from

4.2 Event Selection
A strong motivation for performing a W+jets
Z+jets
ratio analysis with respect to
individual cross-section measurements is the cancellation of experimental sys-
tematic uncertainties. Therefore, a guiding principe of the event selection was
consistency (where possible) across both lepton channels for both W l +
jets and Z  ll + jets events. The selection of W l + jets events was
62CHAPTER 4. DETECTOR LEVEL STUDY OF W+JETS AND Z+JETS
defined to achieve the largest possible fiducial coverage in the ATLAS detector
for electrons, muons and jets. The selection of Z  ll + jets events was de-
fined in a similar way in order to synchronise the cancellation of experimental
uncertainties when forming the ratio of W+jets
Z+jets
events.
Before any lepton selection a general preselection was applied to each event,
requiring at least one primary vertex2 with at least three associated tracks.
The initial vertex requirements were to ensure a reduction of non-collision
backgrounds.
The liquid argon (LAr) calorimeters can sometimes have short noise bursts
during data taking. Events for which this is the case were also removed as part
of the preselection. These events affect data only and were removed individ-
ually rather than incorporated into the GRL. A correction is then applied for
the missing events, such that no bias in luminosity is introduced.
The following sections detail the selection criteria for electrons, muons,
W and Z bosons, and jets. The event selection is summarised in Tables 4.3
and 4.4. The number of events predicted by Monte Carlo and data-driven
background estimations (described in Chapter 5) are compared with the total
number of events observed in data in Tables 4.5 and 4.6.
4.2.1 Electron Selection
Electrons are reconstructed in the ATLAS detector by matching clusters of en-
ergy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter to tracks formed in the inner
detector. In this analysis, electrons candidates were reconstructed following
the tight++ identification criteria which imposes various cuts on electron
objects including track quality (e.g. the minimum number of hits in various
parts of the inner detector). The tight++ criteria also includes require-
ments on the shape of the electromagnetic shower in the calorimetry, and the
2The primary vertex is the scattering vertex with the highest PT sum of all associated
tracks in an event.
4.2. EVENT SELECTION 63
aforementioned track-cluster matching. The full definition of the tight++
selection is detailed in [59].
Triggers were applied to select electron candidate events with at least one
reconstructed electron object in the event. The trigger also required that the
electron candidates have transverse energy of at least 20 GeV for data taking
periods D-I and 22 GeV for periods K-M. The same triggers were used for
both W e and Z  ee selections. The specific electron triggers employed
for different data-taking periods are shown in Table 4.2.
In both lepton channels, fiducial volume cuts were applied for the selection
of leptons; a requirement on the transverse momentum, PT , ensured that the
event was above the trigger turn on curve and lies on the trigger efficiency
plateau. An || requirement ensured that the lepton was within the acceptance
of the inner detector. For this analysis, the electron fiducial requirements were
PT > 25 GeV and ||< 2.47, excluding the electromagnetic calorimeter barrel-
end-cap transition region of 1.37 < ||< 1.52.
Also for both lepton channels, events with multiple jets will produce leptons
in the final state from semileptonic hadronic decays. Such leptons will not be
isolated, rather accompanied by hadronic activity in the detector. To reduce
these background processes, isolation requirements were applied to the leading
lepton (defined as that with the largest PT ) for the W l event selection,
and the two leading leptons for the selection of Z  ll events. In the electron
channel this took the form of a combination of calorimeter and track-based
isolation requirements, each of which was dependent on the PT and  of the
leading electron.
4.2.2 Muon Selection
This analysis employed the STACO algorithm [60] to reconstruct muons. This
algorithm matches and combines inner detector (ID) and muon spectrometer
(MS) tracks by a statistical averaging of the ID and MS track parameters

[61]. As with the electron selection, various quality requirements were placed
on candidate muons, such as a minimum amount of hits in the sub-detectors
(detailed in full in [61]). Muon triggers requiring at least one muon with trans-
verse momentum of at least 18 GeV were applied, the exact trigger dependent
on data taking period. As in the electron channel, the same triggers were used
for both W  and Z   selections (see Table 4.2). The fiducial volume
cuts on the PT and || of muon candidates were PT > 25 GeV and ||< 2.4.
Track-based isolation requirements were applied in the muon channel with
the same motivation as for those in the electron channel. A cone was defined
around the leading muon, with R 
()2 + ()2 = 0.2. For the muon
to pass the isolation cut, the sum of the PT of all tracks within the cone had
to be less than 10% of the PT of the leading muon, i.e P
cone20
T < 0.1.
A further isolation cut was applied to the leading muon, requiring that the
impact parameter significance was |d0/(d0)|< 3.0, where d0 is the impact
parameter with respect to the primary vertex, and (d0) is its uncertainty.
4.2.3 W l events
Since neutrinos pass through the ATLAS detector without causing any ionisa-
tion, their existence in an event can only be inferred through the existence of
missing transverse energy (EmissT ) in the final state. It is therefore not possible
to reconstruct the W mass peak by calculating the invariant mass of the two
4.2. EVENT SELECTION 65
decay products. Instead, a different quantity, the transverse mass (MT ) of
the lepton and the missing energy, is used to reconstruct W boson candidates.
MT is defined by the PT and direction of both the lepton and the missing
momentum, and is given by the expression:
2P lTP
T (1 cos(l  )) (4.1)
where P T is the E
T in the event and 
 its  component. Events passed the
W l selection if they had EmissT > 25 GeV and MT > 40 GeV. Distributions
for the transverse mass, EmissT and the transverse momentum of the selected
W in the electron channel are shown in Figure 4.1.
4.2.4 Z  ll events
Z ll candidate events were required to have exactly two oppositely charged
leptons of the same flavour. Unlike W l, both decay products from Z ll
events can be identified in the volume of the detector, so the Z mass peak can
be reconstructed by calculating the invariant mass, Mll, of the two final state
leptons, given by the formula:
Mll = m
+m2l2 + 2(El1El2  ~pl1  ~pl2) (4.2)
The invariant mass for the Z selection was required to be 66 Mll  116 GeV.
All lepton pairs were also required to be separated by R(l1, l2) > 0.2, where

(l1  l2)2 + (l1  l2)2. Figure 4.2 shows the distributions of
Z invariant mass and transverse momentum in the electron channel.
4.2.5 Jet Selection
As mentioned in Section 2.5.2, hadronic jets in this analysis were reconstructed
using the anti-k cluster algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4. The algo-
rithm takes as inputs topological clusters of energy deposited in the detector
calorimeters. Jets were required to have P

4.4. To avoid the misidentification of leptons as jets, a jet-lepton isolation re-
quirement was imposed that removed any jet within R < 0.5 of the leading
lepton in the W channel, and the first and second leading leptons in the Z
channel.
To remove jets from pile-up events (extra proton-proton interactions in the
same bunch crossing as the hard scatter process), a cut was placed on the jet
vertex fraction (JVF). JVF is a measure of the fraction of the PT sum of tracks
associated with a jet that come from the hard scatter process (i.e. originating
from the primary vertex), divided by the PT sum of all tracks associated with
the jet (as illustrated in Figure 4.3). Only jets that satisfied JVF > 0.75 (i.e. at
least 75% of the track PT associated with the jet originated from the primary
vertex) passed the selection. This cut was applied to all jets within ||< 2.4,
to be within the acceptance of the tracker.

4.3 Jet Calibration
As we shall see in subsequent sections, the way in which jets are calibrated by
the ATLAS collaboration contributes the largest source of systematic uncer-
tainty on the final measurements of this analysis. This section outlines the jet
calibration techniques employed for the ATLAS detector.
The ATLAS calorimeters are calibrated using test beam measurements with
electrons in order to correctly measure energy from electromagnetic showers.
They are thus calibrated to the electromagnetic (EM) scale3 to achieve the best
response to electromagnetic showers [62]. When reconstructing jets, ATLAS
suffers from non-compensation, i.e. there is energy deposited in the calorime-
ters from hadron showers that goes undetected (e.g. energy lost in nuclear
breakdowns or excitations). Therefore, there is a lower response to hadrons.
A jet-energy scale (JES) correction is thus applied to correct for this effect.
Correcting the JES to the EM scale is known as EM+JES calibration. Fur-
thermore, EM+JES also corrects for energy lost in regions of the detector with
poor instrumentation, and lost via calorimeter and jet reconstruction inefficien-
cies [63, 64]. Before the JES is calculated and applied, jets origin corrections
are applied, as are corrections to account for pile-up effects.
4.3.1 Jet Origin and Pile-up Corrections
Jets reconstructed from calorimeter clusters are initially assumed to have orig-
inated in the geometrical centre of the detector. It is therefore necessary to
correct the jet inputs to point to the primary vertex (as defined in Section 4.2)
and recalculate the jet 4-momentum. This correction improves the angular
resolution and also slightly improves the jet PT resolution.
Energy associated with additional interactions not originating from the
hard scatter (pile-up events) must also be corrected for. An average energy
correction is therefore subtracted from EM scale jets. The correction is derived
3The Z resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale [62].
4.4. DETECTOR LEVEL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 73
from minimum bias data and is calculated as a function of the number of
vertices in an event and jet .
4.3.2 Jet Energy Scale
Following the former two jet corrections, EM+JES calibration is applied. The
JES correction is derived using Monte Carlo simulated events (a PYTHIA6
di-jet sample using the AMBT1 tune[65]). It is calculated by first matching
individual particle-level jets (defined using final-state particles) to individual
jets that have been reconstructed in the calorimetry (defined using the full
detector information). The final correction for the calorimeter energy response
is obtained by dividing the energy of the particle-level jet by the EM scale
energy of the calorimeter jet to which it has been matched.
The calibration concludes with a small -dependent correction to remove
any direction bias, resulting from jets reconstructed in regions of the detector
with a lower energy response due to dead material. Without this correction,
the 4-momentum sum of the clusters contributing to the reconstruction of a
jet will be biased towards regions of the detector with higher response. This
correction is a function of energy and . It is typically 1% in most detector
regions, but it can be as large as 7% in the crack regions between the barrel
and the forward calorimetry [63, 64].
4.4 Detector Level Systematic Uncertainties
This section presents a breakdown of the sources of systematic uncertainty on
the measurements of W+jets and Z+jets events at detector level. Uncertainties
pertaining to the evaluation of jet-energy scale and the resolution of jet energy,
and of missing transverse energy in the detector are common to both electron
and muon channels.
Each of the systematic uncertainties described below (with the exception of
74CHAPTER 4. DETECTOR LEVEL STUDY OF W+JETS AND Z+JETS
the Monte Carlo background uncertainties) was evaluated by a dedicated AT-
LAS subgroup. They provided the size of the relevant uncertainty and a gen-
eral prescription on how to apply it to an analysis. The ATLAS Jet/EtMiss
Performance group provided the jet-energy scale, jet-energy resolution and
EmissT systematics, the Egamma Performance and Muon Combined Per-
formance groups provided the electron and muon systematics respectively.
For each source of systematic uncertainty, the effect on the detector-level
results was evaluated by varying the Monte Carlo correction factors (e.g. the
jet-energy scale corrections discussed in the following section) for signal and
background processes up and down by one sigma, and applying the event selec-
tion described above. The up and down variations were applied and evaluated
separately for each uncertainty. This propagates the uncertainty through the
analysis, the results of which can be compared with the nominal results to de-
rive the relative effect of each uncertainty. Where a background was estimated
using a data-driven technique (see Chapter 5), the effect of each uncertainty
on the estimation was evaluated by performing the fit for each systematic vari-
ation of the Monte Carlo templates. Figure 4.4 shows the relative size of the
electron and muon channel systematic uncertainties described in this section,
for the exclusive jet multiplicity distributions. Tables 4.7 and 4.8 relate the
systematic uncertainties for both the electron and muon channels in exclusive
jet multiplicity bins.
4.4.1 Jet Energy Scale Uncertainty
Uncertainties related to the jet calibration, e.g. jet-energy scale corrections,
contribute the largest source of systematic uncertainty at detector level in the
separate lepton channels. These uncertainties are common to both W + jets
and Z + jets channels, and therefore largely cancel in the ratio. Jet-energy
scale uncertainties considered in this analysis can be sub-categorised into four
main sources:
4.4. DETECTOR LEVEL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 75
 Uncertainties associated with the methods of calibration.
 Uncertainties on the pile-up correction.
 Uncertainties due to the presence of jets close to the calibrated jet.
 Uncertainties arising from differences in jet flavour composition and re-
sponse between the MC samples used for calibration and those used in
the analysis.
Uncertainties due to methods used for jet calibration are evaluated in three
ways [66]:
4.4.1.1 -Intercalibration
Jets in the central region of the detector are reconstructed with a higher preci-
sion than forward jets due to the higher tracking precision in the inner detector.
Therefore, the systematic uncertainty from JES is lower for jets in the cen-
tral region. To ensure uniform response throughout the detector, the jets in
the forward region are calibrated against the well-measured jets in the central
region. This was achieved by balancing the PT of a di-jet system with one cen-
tral and one forward jet, this is known as -intercalibration. The uncertainty
associated with this jet calibration was evaluated as the RMS spread of the
Monte Carlo predictions used for the study around the data points. This is
because Monte Carlo predictions for the jet response significantly differ and
for this quantity there is no reason for trusting one over the other.
4.4.1.2 Single-hadron response at large PT
The uncertainty in EM+JES calibration arising from the calorimeter response
to isolated hadrons is evaluated by taking the ratio of the energy deposited in
the calorimeter, by the isolated hadron, to its momentum. This is calculated
from the associated track in the inner detector. The deviation of Monte Carlo
predictions from data for the value of <E/p> is taken as a jet-energy scale
uncertainty.
76CHAPTER 4. DETECTOR LEVEL STUDY OF W+JETS AND Z+JETS
4.4.1.3 Non-closure
Once JES corrections have been calculated, they can be re-applied to the
nominal sample of reconstructed-level Monte Carlo jets from which they were
derived and compared to Monte Carlo jets reconstructed at particle level. If
the corrections are calculated perfectly the ratio of PT distributions for the
corrected jets and particle-level jets should yield unity. The largest deviation
from unity in the jet PT and energy is taken as a systematic uncertainty.
4.4.2 Jet-energy Resolution
Jet-energy resolution (JER) relates to the width of the jet response in the
detector, and is calculated with fully calibrated jets. This is achieved via two
techniques involving di-jet systems with a back-to-back topology ( > 2.8),
in which both jets are in the same region of the detector and therefore subject
to the same detector response. The first involves measuring the PT asymmetry
((PTjet1PTjet2)/(PTjet1+PTjet2)). The second method used to determine the jet-
energy resolution is a bisector technique. It involves constructing a balance PT
vector which is the vector sum of the di-jet system in question and projecting
onto the di-jet  and  axes [67].
As for JES uncertainties, JER uncertainties are evaluated by comparing
the results of the above measurements from data and Monte Carlo.
4.4.3 Missing Transverse Energy
The missing transverse energy, EmissT , in an event is calculated by combin-
ing measurements of all the physics objects (electrons, muons and jets) in an
event, with the addition of soft terms which account for energy depositions
in the calorimeter not directly included in the aforementioned physics objects
[68]. Uncertainties in the missing transverse energy are derived from uncer-
tainties in the resolution and scale of the soft terms that contribute to the
EmissT calculation. Any change to the physics objects are also propagated into
4.4. DETECTOR LEVEL SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 77
the EmissT calculation. A prescription is provided to shift the E
T up and
down by its resolution. Separate up and down variations are applied to the
soft terms and the physics objects. This is because the systematic uncertainty
on these terms is treated as uncorrelated. Uncertainties on EmissT only affect
the W+jets channel, since no EmissT requirement is included in the Z+jets event
selection.
4.4.4 Lepton Systematic Uncertainties
Lepton energy uncertainties are derived using data-Monte Carlo comparisons
from tag and probe studies. Tag and probe is a common method for measuring
lepton efficiencies, whereby Z  ll events are selected to provide a clean sample
of leptons. One lepton, the tag, must pass strict identification cuts while the
other, the probe, has few or no selection requirements. The invariant mass of
the two leptons must also be near the Z mass peak. By this method the probe
lepton is considered unbiased and can therefore be used for energy calibration
and efficiency studies
4.4.4.1 Electron Uncertainties
Both the electron-energy scale and resolution are measured using data and
Monte Carlo; the two are compared and the latter is then scaled to the data.
Systematic uncertainties on the tag and probe method used to derive the scale
factors are evaluated using Monte Carlo and can be generally separated into
five terms [59]:
 A statistical component from the limited statistics of the samples used
to conduct the study.
 A method component (i.e. non-closure).
 Uncertainty from the choice of generator used to conduct the study.
 A material budget component derived by varying the ATLAS geometry
used to conduct the study and comparing with results using the standard
78CHAPTER 4. DETECTOR LEVEL STUDY OF W+JETS AND Z+JETS
ATLAS geometry.
 A pre-sampler component.
Electron reconstruction, identification and trigger scale factors are also de-
rived using a tag and probe technique, with data and Monte Carlo predictions
[59]. The reconstruction and identification scale factors each have 7 associated
systematic components. These are subcategorised into six correlated compo-
nents and one uncorrelated. The uncorrelated components are the dominant
source of uncertainty on the electron scale factors. The electron uncertainties
are somewhat cancelled in the ratio of W+jets to Z+jets events. However, a
full cancellation is not achieved due to different numbers of electrons in the
final state of W+jets and Z+jets events. In any case, each individual uncer-
tainty in each channel is fully propagated through the analysis before forming
the final ratios.
4.4.4.2 Muon Uncertainties
As with the electron channel, muon uncertainties are derived using a tag and
probe technique, in this case with Z   events [61]. Scale factors are ap-
plied for muon PT resolution of the inner detector and muon spectrometer, PT
scale, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies. Systematic uncertainties are as-
sociated with each of the aforementioned muon scale factors and are evaluated
using similar methods to those described for the electron channel. All muon
systematics are small compared to others in the analysis.
4.4.5 Uncertainties on Monte Carlo Backgrounds
As mentioned in Section 4.1, each Monte Carlo sample used was normalised to
the relevant (N)NLO cross-section4. Each background processes modelled by
4The NNLO cross-section calculation for hadronic Z production was calculated using the
FEWZ 2.0 program [69] and the NNLO calculation for top pair production was provided by
the top++ 2.0 program [70].
4.5. DETECTOR LEVEL DISTRIBUTIONS 79
Monte Carlo will therefore have an uncertainty associated with the uncertainty
on that normalisation. The cross-section uncertainty for electroweak processes
is 5% (arising from scale and PDF uncertainties in the NNLO prediction).
For WW and ZZ diboson backgrounds the uncertainty is also 5%, and 7% for
WZ (taken from [71]). For single top backgrounds the t-channel has a 3.4%
associated uncertainty and 4% for the s-channel.
The tt background for the Z+jets channel was also estimated using Monte
Carlo simulation provided by ALPGEN+HERWIG+JIMMY. The uncertainty
on this background includes a normalisation uncertainty of 6% (taken from
[72]). Another uncertainty is included which accounts for shape differences in
the predictions. The uncertainty on the final result was evaluated for each
distribution by performing the unfolding (as described in Chapter 6) using
an alternative tt sample provided by POWHEG+PYTHIA and taking the
difference between that result and the result achieved using the nominal ALP-
GEN+HERWIG+JIMMY tt sample.
4.5 Detector Level Distributions
Figures 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 show the exclusive jet multiplicity, leading jet PT and
leading jet rapidity distributions respectively, in the electron and muon chan-
nels, for both W  l + jets and Z  ll + jets events. Included are the
data-driven background estimations discussed in Chapter 5. The systematic
uncertainty band includes all detector level systematics discussed in Section
4.4, and the systematics associated with the background estimations as dis-
cussed in Sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.4. In each plot the MC/Data ratio un-
derneath the main plot is the ratio of selected data to ALPGEN signal plus
background predictions from Monte Carlo and data-driven techniques. The
red dotted line in the ratio represents a corresponding ratio in which SHERPA
signal has replaced ALPGEN+HERWIG.

Chapter 5
Background Characterisation
This chapter details the data-driven techniques developed for this analysis to
estimate the size and shape of certain physics processes that are backgrounds
to the signal events. They are QCD events for the W  l + jets and Z  ll
+ jets channels, and tt events for the W  l + jets channel1.
5.1 Data-Driven QCD Background
Multi-jet events from QCD processes can have final state signatures indis-
tinguishable from the signal processes of this analysis, and will contaminate
the signal event selection. It was important to understand the rate at which
such processes occur. In order to subtract this contribution from the signal
selection we needed to estimate the size and shape of the QCD background
contribution for each variable measured in this analysis. We achieved a QCD
background characterisation via a data-driven technique. Such an approach
1The authors contribution to this part of the analysis was to adapt existing code in
order to provide the muon channel QCD estimate for each variable in the analysis, for both
W   + jets and Z   + jets channels. The author also provided the evaluation of the
systematic uncertainties on the QCD estimation method in the muon channel (discussed in
detail in Section 5.1.3), and the full propagation of the detector-level systematic uncertainties
(described in Section 4.4) through the muon channel QCD estimation.
88 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
was taken due to the large uncertainties which accompany Monte Carlo simu-
lations of hadronic backgrounds. For each lepton and boson channel, the basic
technique was the same, and can be broken down into 4 stages; (i) selection
of QCD control sample, (ii) extraction of control template shape, (iii) a fit to
find normalisation scale factors and (iv) estimation of the background size and
shape for each kinematic variable.
Selection of control sample: The first stage was to select a set of data
which was enriched in QCD events while maintaining similar kinematic prop-
erties as the signal selection. This set of data was termed the control sam-
ple. Contamination of the QCD control sample from signal events, and events
from electroweak and top background processes was evaluated by applying the
control sample selection to Monte Carlo simulation modelling the relevant pro-
cesses2. This sample will be referred to as (Sig+Bkg)CS.
Shape of Control Template: A variable was then chosen with the power
to discriminate between the shape of QCD events and the Sig+Bkg events
selected with the signal selection, referred to here as (Sig+Bkg)SS (where SS
refers to the signal selection). The QCD control template was found by sub-
tracting (Sig+Bkg)CS from the control sample for the distribution of the chosen
variable. The subtraction was a bin-by-bin subtraction of histograms.
Extraction of normalisation scale factors: The control template and the
(Sig+Bkg)SS template were fit to the data distribution from the signal selec-
tion, dataSS. The fit determined the relative contribution of QCD events and
(Sig+Bkg)SS events in dataSS. This provided normalisation scale factors for
the rate of QCD events with respect to the total number of signal data events.
2A study to determine the effect of using a data driven tt estimate (as described in Section
5.3) in place of Monte Carlo for this template concluded that it had a negligible impact on
the QCD fractions obtained by the fit, thus Monte Carlo was used.
5.1. DATA-DRIVEN QCD BACKGROUND 89
Estimation of the QCD background for each variable: Finally, the
size and shape of the QCD contribution was extracted for each kinematic vari-
able studied in this analysis. This was achieved by applying the control sample
selection to data and subtracting (Sig+Bkg)CS to find the shape of the QCD
background. The background shape for each distribution was then scaled by
the normalisation scale factors determined from the fit.
The details of the control sample selection and the fit, and their associated
systematic uncertainties, are discussed in the following subsections for both
lepton and both boson channels.
5.1.1 Muon Channel
QCD events that contaminate the W   + jets and Z   + jets signals
are primarily heavy flavour events decaying to real muons. This is because
the muon isolation requirements in the event selection (Section 4.2.2) were
designed to reject other types of multi-jet events. As mentioned above, the
Monte Carlo simulations of hadronic backgrounds are accompanied by large
uncertainties arising from the difficulty in modelling the rate at which isolated
muons are falsely reconstructed from a jet or a muon within a jet, and from
uncertainties on the cross-section of such hadronic processes. For this reason, a
data driven technique was employed in this analysis to model the contribution
of QCD background processes. The variables used to discriminate between
signal and background were EmissT and invariant mass (M) in the W  
+ jets and Z   + jets channels respectively. As mentioned above, a QCD-
enriched control sample was selected from data. A control template was then
extracted and was fit to the EmissT distribution in the W   + jets channel
and to the M distribution in the Z   + jets channel.
90 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
5.1.1.1 Selection of Control Sample
It was required of the QCD control samples that they be enriched in QCD
events, while maintaining similar kinematic properties to the QCD events
which contaminate the data signal sample. With this in mind, the W  
+ jets channel QCD enriched data sample was selected by requiring all events
to pass the full W   + jets event selection, as described in Section 4.2.
The main change to the W signal event selection to obtain a QCD-enriched
control sample was to reverse the isolation requirement on the leading muon3,
but restricting the isolation to a window. The requirement (termed restricted
anti-isolation) was that the PT sum of all tracks within a    cone of 0.2
around the leading muon, as a fraction of leading muon PT , was between
10-50%, i.e. 0.1 < P cone20T /P
T < 0.5. The muon isolation requirement on
the impact parameter (d0) significance was still applied. The restricted
requirement was applied to reduce contamination from Sig+Bkg processes.
A number of alternative selection criteria were investigated and evaluated
in terms of the QCD fraction they yielded and the relative contamination from
W+jets signal only, and Sig+Bkg processes. This is discussed in the following
section.
In the Z   + jets channel, the control sample was selected by applying
the full Z   + jets event selection with an anti-isolation muon selection.
Due to lower statistics, the anti-isolation requirement was not restricted
(P cone20T /P
T > 0.1 was applied) and the d0 significance isolation requirement
was also removed.
The QCD control template for W(Z) was formed by performing a bin-by-
bin histogram subtraction of the EmissT (M) distribution for (Sig+Bkg)
from the control sample EmissT (M) distribution.
In the W   + jets channel, one change was made for the purposes of
3As discussed in Section 4.2.2, the muon isolation requirement for the nominal signal
selection was < P cone20T /P
T < 0.1
5.1. DATA-DRIVEN QCD BACKGROUND 91
the fit, to both the signal and control sample selections. The EmissT requirement
was removed (while still requiring the transverse mass, MT > 40GeV). QCD
events do not contain high PT neutrinos and thus peak at lower values of E
Therefore, the removal of the EmissT requirement exploited the shape difference
between the control and (Sig+Bkg)SS templates at low EmissT . This was pri-
marily for the purpose of performing the fit to find the relevant contribution
of each, but also further enriched the control sample in QCD events.
5.1.1.2 Alternative Control Sample Selection
For the W   + jets channel, a number of different combinations of the iso-
lation requirements were investigated as potential alternatives to the restricted
anti-isolation with d0 significance requirement (RestrAntiIsoWithD0) that
was used in the analysis. The alternative QCD control sample requirements
were as follows:
 AntiD0WithIso: Reversed d0 significance (fails d0/d0 < 3), includes
signal isolation cut.
 AntiD0WithIso D0Window: Reversed d0 significance, includes sig-
nal isolation cut and additional requirement of 0.1 < |d0|< 0.4.
 AntiD0NoIso: Reversed d0 significance, no isolation requirement.
 AntiIsoNoD0: Reversed signal isolation requirement (P cone20T /P
0.1), no d0 significance requirement.
 AntiIsoWithD0: Reversed signal isolation, includes d0/d0 < 3 cut.
 RestrAntiIso: Restricted reversed signal isolation within 0.1< P cone20T /P
0.5 window.
 RestrAntiIsoWithD0: Restricted reversed signal isolation within win-
dow, includes d0 significance cut.
For each control sample selection, the QCD fractions (ratio of QCD events
in data to the total number of data events) were extracted by fitting the control
sample template and the (Sig+Bkg)SS template to the dataSS distribution. The
92 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
signal only and Sig+Bkg contaminations were also determined for each control
sample selection.
The control sample should provide a high QCD fraction while maintain-
ing tolerable contamination. Table 5.1 shows the QCD fraction yielded by
fits using the control sample selections listed above, along with signal only
and Sig+Bkg contaminations. The AntiD0WithIso and AntiD0noIso selec-
tions were deemed unsuitable due to large signal contamination in the selected
control sample. AntiD0WithIso D0Window was rejected due to a large back-
ground contamination and was thus more dependent on the Monte Carlo mod-
elling of diboson and tt processes. Of the remaining two selections, both of
which employ the restricted anti-isolation requirement, RestrAntiIsoWithD0
was chosen as the nominal template following comparison studies with heavy
flavour bb and cc Monte Carlo samples generated using Pythia. For this study,
the shape of the bb and cc leading jet PT distribution for each selection was
compared with the shape of the distribution from the signal selection. The
RestrAntiIsoWithD0 control sample was found to be most similar with the
signal selection distribution.
5.1.1.3 Fit Results
The fit was performed (using the TFractionFitter class in ROOT [73]) by
fitting the QCD control template and the (Sig+Bkg)SS template to the dataSS
distribution. In the W   + jets channel, the fit was performed on the
EmissT distribution within the range [15, 70] GeV and in the Z   + jets
channel on the invariant mass, M, distribution within the range [45, 150]
GeV. The normalisation of each template was varied to obtain the best fit
with the data distribution, thus determining the fraction of QCD and Sig+Bkg
events entering the data signal selection. This provided scale factors for the
total normalisation of the shape of QCD events.
The fits in both channels were performed in bins of exclusive jet multiplicity,
yielding a separate normalisation scale factor for each. In the W   + jets

channel, the fit was performed for exactly 0-5 jets and in the Z   + jets
channel for 0-2 jets. For exclusive jet multiplicities above 5 (or above 2 in the
Z   + jets channel), the QCD template statistics are insufficient for a
stable fit. Therefore, the scale factor for exactly 5 jets (or exactly 2 jets for
the Z   + jets channel) was applied to all higher jet multiplicity bins.
Figures 5.1 and 5.2 respectively show the EmissT and M distributions for
data (with the EmissT cut removed in the former) and the fit result for the QCD
and Sig+Bkg event templates. Table 5.2 shows the value of the QCD fractions
obtained for the exclusive jet multiplicity bins in each channel.
To obtain the shape of the QCD background for each variable considered
in this analysis, the QCD control sample selection was applied to data (in the
W   + jets channel the signal selection EmissT requirement was applied).
The Sig+Bkg contamination was estimated by applying the QCD selection to
the relevant Monte Carlo simulations, and a bin-by-bin histogram subtraction
from the control data distribution was performed. The resultant data distri-
butions were then scaled by the QCD normalisation factor provided by the
template fits, relevant to the jet multiplicity bin. This yielded the size and
shape of the QCD background contribution for each kinematic variable.

5.1. DATA-DRIVEN QCD BACKGROUND 97
5.1.2 Electron Channel
In the W  e + jets channel, QCD events contaminate the signal mainly
by mismeasured jets that fake an electron. A mismeasured jet can also affect
the EmissT in an event. In the Z  ee + jets channel, events with two jets can
contaminate the signal if both jets fake an electron and their reconstructed
mass is within the invariant mass range around the Z mass peak used in the
analysis. A very large Monte Carlo sample would be required to provide enough
events to simulate the multi-jet background in the electron channel. For this
reason, and the presence of large jet cross-section uncertainties, a data-driven
technique was employed to estimate the QCD background in this channel. A
similar approach was applied as in the muon channel. Again, a QCD-enriched
control sample was selected from data, and a control template was extracted.
Fits to the EmissT and Mee distributions were then performed in the W  e
+ jets and Z  ee + jets channels respectively.
5.1.2.1 Selection of Control Sample
The QCD control sample was selected from data acquired using loose elec-
tron triggers. During the 2011 ATLAS data taking period, the conditions for
pile-up events changed substantially and the increase in additional jets affected
the shape and rate of the QCD background. For this reason, in the electron
channel the data was split into two sections, corresponding to earlier data tak-
ing periods (D-K) and later periods (L-M). The fit was performed separately
for each of the datasets before combining them to provide a QCD estimate for
the whole of the 2011 dataset.
For the W  e + jets channel, the electron identification criteria were
relaxed from the tight selection used for the signal selection. We required
only that an electron pass the loose, and a subset of the medium, identifi-
cation requirements, and that it failed the tight criteria. The electrons were
also subjected to a calorimeter-based anti-isolation requirement that the to-
98 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
tal energy deposited within a cone of size R=0.3 be more than 20% of the
energy of an electron, i.e. Econe30T /E
T > 0.2. The values of this anti-
isolation requirement were chosen based on four criterion: the goodness of
the fit, the (Sig+Bkg)SS and QCD normalisation scale factors returned from
the fit, and the amount of Sig+Bkg contamination entering the QCD control
sample. Variations on the anti-isolation requirement were used as alternative
templates to evaluate the systematic uncertainty associated with the choice of
Econe30T /E
T > 0.2.
In the Z  ee + jets channel, the control sample was selected by using
a loose trigger and requiring that both electrons pass the loose identification
criteria while failing the medium criteria.
5.1.2.2 Fit Results
The electron channel fit was performed in a very similar way to the muon
channel fit described above. The W  e + jets channel fit to EmissT (with
the EmissT requirement removed) was performed over the range [15, 80] GeV
for exactly 0-5 jets, and the Z  ee + jets channel fit to Mee over [50, 140]
GeV for exactly 0-2 jets. For the Z  ee + jets channel fit, the region
around the Z mass peak was highly contaminated by signal processes and was
thus dependent on Monte Carlo modelling of the signal template. For this
reason the region around the Z peak was removed from the fit. Table 5.3
shows the QCD fractions obtained in exclusive jet multiplicity bins for both
channels. The shape of the QCD background for each variable in the analysis
was determined in exactly the same way as for the muon channel, as described
in Section 5.1.1.3.

5.1.3 Systematic Uncertainties
In both lepton channels, four sources of systematic uncertainty were considered
in evaluating the overall uncertainty on the QCD background estimation. An
additional systematic associated with electron identification was included in
the electron channel only. Furthermore, the effect of the detector-level system-
atic variations (i.e. those discussed in Section 4.3) on the QCD background
estimate was evaluated by varying the Monte Carlo templates and repeating
the fit. The latter systematic variations are not included in the QCD error
band, rather they are propagated through the analysis. Figure 5.3 shows the
fractional uncertainties on the QCD background associated with the method
of estimation, for the W   + jets channel. Table 5.4 relates the corre-
sponding breakdown in terms of percentage error on the nominal result. The
QCD systematics considered were:
Fit Range: A systematic was assigned to the choice of fit range by varying
the nominal fit range, performing the fit and taking an envelope of the overall
maximum and minimum values from the varied fit results. In the W  
+ jets channel, the nominal fit range of [15, 70] GeV was varied by taking a
100 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
minima of 10 and 20 and a maxima of 50 and 90 GeV, all combinations with
the nominal minima and maxima were considered. In the Z   + jets
channel, the nominal range of [45, 150] GeV was varied using 40 and 50 GeV
as minima and 145 and 155 GeV as maxima. For the W  e + jets and
Z  ee + jets channels, the nominal ranges of [15, 80] GeV and [50, 140] GeV
respectively were varied using minima of 10 and 20 GeV for W, 45 and 55 Gev
for Z, and maxima of 60 and 100 GeV for W, and 135 and 145 GeV for Z.
Choice of Template: Alternative templates were used to evaluate the sys-
tematic uncertainty associated with the choice of QCD control sample. The
fit was performed for each template and again an envelope of the minimum
and maximum deviations from the nominal fit value was taken as the overall
systematic uncertainty. In the muon channel, the alternative templates were
taken from those listed in Section 5.1.1.2, specifically in the W   +jets
channel, AntiD0WithIso D0Window and RestrAntiIso were taken as the
alternatives, and for Z   AntiD0NoIso and AntiIsoWithD0 were used.
In the W  e channel, alternative control sample selections were employed by
varying the parameters of the nominal isolation requirement (Econe30T /ET <
0.2). The cone size was varied up and down to values of 0.4 and 0.2 respec-
tively, and the cut value was varied to 0.15 and 0.25. The difference between
calorimeter and track based isolation was also included as a source of system-
atic uncertainty.
Electroweak Background Modelling: A systematic associated with the
choice of Monte Carlo generator for the Sig+Bkg samples was determined by
using an alternative template from samples generated using SHERPA. The
value of the systematic uncertainty was taken as the difference between the
fit results using this template, and that generated using the nominal ALP-
GEN+HERWIG template. This approach was applied to both W and Z chan-
nels in each lepton channel.
5.1. DATA-DRIVEN QCD BACKGROUND 101
Statistical Uncertainty: The final QCD background systematic uncertainty,
common to both lepton channels, was the statistical uncertainty on the QCD
scale factors returned by the fitting tool. This is a small uncertainty that only
becomes significant in bins of higher jet multiplicity.
Electron Identification: One source of systematic uncertainty was consid-
ered in the electron channel only, this related to the choice of tight identification
criteria the electron was required to fail. Alternative templates were created
for which the failure of certain tight identification cuts was not required. The
fit was performed for each alternative template and an envelope of the maxi-
mum and minimum deviations from the nominal result was taken as the overall
systematic associated with electron identification.

5.2 tt Background
Figure 5.4 depicts the decay of a tt pair to a final state with two W bosons
and two b quarks. When the b quarks decay hadronically, events of this type
can have a final state that includes a W decaying into a lepton and neutrino,
with associated hadronic jets from the b quarks. This final state signature is
indistinguishable from W l + jets events this analysis aims to measure. For
events with four or more jets, such decays become the dominant background
process contaminating the signal in the W+jets channel. The proportion of
this background increases with increasing jet multiplicity. It was therefore very
important for this analysis to have a good understanding of the shape of this
background.
Previous analyses estimated this background using Monte Carlo simula-
tions. However, such estimations were plagued by large systematic uncertain-
ties from a variety of sources, including the uncertainty on the cross-section for
5.2. T T BACKGROUND 103
top production and the propagation of the jet energy scale uncertainty through
the Monte Carlo background estimate. The resultant systematic uncertainty
for the W+jets analysis with 35 pb1 of data was nearly 40% in the 4-jet
bin. In order to reduce this large uncertainty on the tt background estimation
for the W+jets channel, a data-driven technique was employed4. The general
approach was the same as for the data-driven QCD background estimation
described in Section 5.1:
1. A control sample enriched in tt events was selected from data.
2. A variable was chosen with the power to discriminate between the shape
of tt events, W signal, electroweak and multi-jet QCD events (referred to
here as Sig+EWK+QCD). The tt control template was extracted from
the control sample by subtracting the (Sig+EWK+QCD)CS distribution
(formed by applying the control sample selection to Sig+EWK+QCD
events) from the control sample distribution for the discriminating vari-
able. This was a bin-by-bin histogram subtraction.
3. A maximum likelihood fit was performed to fit the tt control template
and the Sig+EWK+QCD template from the signal selection (referred
to as (Sig+EWK+QCD)SS) to the distribution of data from the signal
selection, dataSS. This yielded total normalisation scale factors for the
contribution of tt events to dataSS.
4. The shape of the tt background for each kinematic variable in the anal-
ysis was extracted by applying the control sample selection to data and
removing contamination by subtracting the kinematic distribution from
the (Sig+EWK+QCD)CS sample. Finally, the relevant normalisation
4For the Z channel, this analysis estimated the tt contribution using Monte Carlo sim-
ulation with samples from the ALPGEN+HERWIG+JIMMY generators. This is justified
since the Z channel analysis is performed within a lower inclusive jet multiplicity range (up
to 4 jets), and the Monte Carlo simulations provide a reliable estimation of tt production in
this region. Furthermore, the tt background in the Z+jets channel is comparatively small.

scale factor was applied to the control sample distribution to provide the
tt background distribution for each kinematic variable.
Unlike for the QCD estimate, the primary challenge was not the selection of a
suitable control sample of tt events, rather choosing a variable with the power
to discriminate between the shape of tt events and the shape of our W+jets
signal events. For this part of the analysis, Sig+EWK processes were modelled
using Monte Carlo simulation, and the shape of QCD events was taken from
the data-driven estimation described in Section 5.2.
5.2.1 Selection of Control Sample
The selection of a top enriched data control sample was readily achieved by
exploiting top quark decay via t  Wb. As such there are always two b
quarks in the event which decay hadronically. No b-tagging requirements were
included in the signal selection. Therefore, it was sufficient to require at least
one b-jet in an event to select a data sample of predominantly top events that
will also model well the expected kinematic distributions for top background.
The MV1 b-tagging algorithm [74] was used to select events with at least
one b-jet, with three different tagging criteria (tight, medium and loose) con-
5.2. T T BACKGROUND 105
sidered. The requirement of at least two b-jets was also investigated for the
control sample selection. W events from signal processes, electroweak back-
ground processes and multi-jet background processes contaminate this sample
of tt events. Checking all combinatorics of tagging criteria and number of b-
jets mentioned above yielded an optimal selection of medium tagging criteria
and requiring at least one b-jet. This selection provided the optimal purity
of the tt sample because it had an acceptable level of background contami-
nation from W events (as estimated using Monte Carlo). Furthermore, the
event selection requiring two b-jets distorted some kinematic distributions in
the control sample, with respect to the signal selection.
At low jet multiplicities, the non-negligible W contamination was dom-
inated by W+c, W+cc, W+bb events. Such events, along with single top
and electroweak processes, were removed from each distribution of the con-
trol sample. This was achieved by a bin-by-bin histogram subtraction of the
(Sig+EWK)CS sample from the control sample. Contamination from QCD
events was also subtracted using a QCD estimation from data, using the same
method as described in Section 5.2 but also including the above b-tagging
requirement applied to the QCD control sample selection.
The process of b-tagging introduced a small bias in the control sample with
respect to a non-b-tagged inclusive tt Monte Carlo sample. The size of this
bias was evaluated using Monte Carlo, by comparing the difference between
distributions from an inclusive top sample with and without the b-tagging
requirement applied. The bias was due to a lack of b-tagging available beyond
the tracking acceptance. Correction factors were derived from ALPGEN tt
Monte Carlo by taking the ratio of the number of inclusive tt events to the
number of b-tagged tt events. They were then applied to the control sample
to correct for this bias.
106 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
5.2.2 Discriminating Variable
A suitable variable had to be chosen which provides good separation between
the shape of the tt events and signal events. A maximum likelihood fit could
then be performed over this variable to estimate the normalisation of tt events
to the signal data selection. This proved somewhat problematic since the top
decays to a W, therefore the kinematic distributions of the two types of event
are very similar. A number of different variables were considered to perform the
fit, and Monte Carlo samples for W signal and tt events were used to determine
the discriminating power of each variable for different jet multiplicities.
The first two variables to be considered were lepton  and top mass, cal-
culated using 3 jets that yield the highest summed PT . The former was tested
because leptons produced in tt events are more central than those in W+jets
events [75]. Lepton  provided good separation but was deemed too sensitive
to the PDF used for the W signal Monte Carlo. The top mass gave the best
overall separation but was also too sensitive to fluctuations in the shape of the
W signal template, arising from jet energy scale and other uncertainties.
The EmissT in an event was tested and demonstrated the best power of sep-
aration for low jet multiplicities, but the top and W signal shapes became
increasingly similar with increasing jet multiplicity. This is because of the
two W bosons produced in tt decay, we required only one to decay leptoni-
cally. The other W boson can also decay leptonically and be a source of extra
EmissT . With increasing jet multiplicity, the tt events that will be more likely
to pass the signal selection will be those in which the second W boson decayed
hadronically, in this case there is no extra EmissT .
The next variable considered was transverse sphericity: the summed P 2T in
an event with respect to the event axis. The lepton and all jets passing the
event selection, and the EmissT in an event are included in the momentum tensor
used for the calculation of transverse sphericity. Transverse sphericity takes
values between 0 (pencil-like events) and 1 (isotropic events) [75]. Because tt
5.2. T T BACKGROUND 107
pairs are produced with back-to-back topology, the summed P 2T of all decay
products is likely to be more isotropic and therefore take higher values of
transverse sphericity. W signal events will be less isotropic and take lower
values of transverse sphericity than tt events. Transverse sphericity provided
good separation for all jet multiplicities, but the region of good separation was
limited to the range [0.0, 0.4] of this variable.
The final variable considered was transformed aplanarity: defined as e8A,
where aplanarity A = 33 and 3 is the smallest eigenvalue of the normalised
momentum tensor. As for transverse sphericity, the momentum tensor in-
cludes the lepton and all jets passing the selection. The choice of transformed5
aplanarity was based on a similar rationale as for transverse sphericity, i.e. tt
events will be more isotropic [75]. Transformed aplanarity provided a good
overall separation and is largely stable against fluctuations in the W template
arising from jet energy scale and other uncertainties. It was therefore decided
to use this variable for the fit.
5.2.3 tt Fit
The fit was performed using RooFit [76]. As with the QCD estimation, the
normalisation of the control and (Sig+EWK+QCD)SS templates was varied to
provide the best fit with the dataSS. The relevant normalisation scale factors
for each contribution were thus extracted. At values of transposed aplanarity
above 0.9 the effect of jet energy scale variations became significant, therefore
the fitting range was chosen to be [0.0, 0.85]. Figure 5.5 shows the fit to
transposed aplanarity in the muon W channel, for the Njet=3 and Njet=5
bins.
To estimate the shape and size of the tt contribution for each variable
measured in this analysis, the control sample selection was first applied to data.
5The transformed quantity is used instead of aplanarity directly in order to increase the
separation in the aplanarity distribution between tt and signal events.
108 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
The (Sig+EWK+QCD)CS sample was subtracted via bin-by-bin histogram
subtraction to remove contamination. The scale factors for the tt contributions
extracted from the fit were then applied to data, in the relevant jet multiplicity
One issue with this procedure was that, unlike the method for QCD estima-
tion, the control sample was a subset of the data signal sample, i.e. they were
not mutually exclusive. This means that the tt template was statistically cor-
related with data signal template. Therefore, RooFit may underestimate the
statistical uncertainty on the fit. The correlation between the two templates
is somewhat loosened by:
 The b-tagging correction factors (described in Section 5.2.1).
 The bin-by-bin contamination subtraction of (Sig+EWK+QCD)CS from
the control sample.
 The fact that the top template is only a partial subset of the full signal
region.
Nevertheless, the statistical uncertainty on the method was checked by using a
toy Monte Carlo procedure to evaluate the statistical correlation between the
tt template and the data signal template (the full details of the procedure are
described in [77]).
5.2.4 Systematic Uncertainties
Five sources of systematic uncertainty on the method for estimating the tt
background were evaluated, the total systematic uncertainty associated with
the method was then taken as their quadratic sum. Figure 5.6 shows the
breakdown of tt systematics for the electron and muon W channels, and Table
5.5 relates the corresponding numerical breakdown, along with the tt fractions
obtained from the fit. The systematics considered were:

multiplicity lower than 3, the tt background is taken from Monte Carlo simulation. Plots

Model uncertainty on the subtracted b-tagged W signal: As men-
tioned above, at lower jet multiplicities (3 or 4 jets) there was a significant
contamination from W+c, W+cc and W+bb events which was subtracted us-
ing ALPGEN Monte Carlo. The modelling of the heavy flavour contamination
has an associated systematic uncertainty which was evaluated by applying
normalisation to the heavy flavour distributions. Studies showed that W+cc
and W+bb distributions had similar shapes to each other in many kinematic
distributions, whereas W+c were different. For this reason, one normalisation
was estimated for the W+cc and W+bb contribution, and a separate one was
estimated for W+c. The b-tagged data and Monte Carlo samples were com-
pared in the 1-jet and 2-jet bins, and normalisation factors were calculated
such that the total number of events in the Monte Carlo samples equalled
the total in data. The normalisation factors were then applied to the relevant
heavy flavour samples, and the subtraction from the control sample and subse-
quent fit were performed again to evaluate the overall effect of this uncertainty.
Choice of fit range: The systematic associated with the choice of fitting
range was determined by varying the upper limit of the fit from 0.85 to 0.83
and 0.87.
110 CHAPTER 5. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISATION
b-tagging correction factors: As mentioned in Section 5.2.1, the b-tagging
requirement in the control sample selection introduced a small bias with re-
spect to a non-b-tagged inclusive tt sample. The correction factors that were
applied to the control sample had an associated systematic uncertainty. The
nominal corrections were derived using ALPGEN Monte Carlo and were com-
pared to an alternative set of correction factors derived using POWHEG-BOX
Monte Carlo. If the difference between the two sets of corrections was not
statistically significant then the uncertainty on the correction was simply the
statistical uncertainty on the nominal corrections, otherwise the uncertainty
was taken as the size of the difference between ALPGEN and POWHEG-BOX
corrections.
b-tagging uncertainty on the subtracted W signal: The control sample
contamination from W signal events was estimated using Monte Carlo and
subtracted from the sample of tt events. This W signal sample suffers from
tagging uncertainties, the effects of which were evaluated by applying ATLAS
standard uncertainties for b-tagging, c-tagging and light flavour-tagging. For
each of the three sources of uncertainty, the W signal sample was varied up
and down before subtraction. Each variation was performed independently,
the uncertainties derived from each were then added in quadrature.
Statistical uncertainty: The statistical uncertainty on the fit was also in-
cluded as a uncertainty on the value of the estimated tt background.

Chapter 6
Unfolding to Particle Level
The distributions shown in Section 4.5 are presented at detector level. This
analysis aims to present the ratio of the W+jets
Z+jets
cross-sections at particle level1.
Therefore, it was necessary to correct for detector effects such as the ineffi-
ciency with which ATLAS reconstructs the vector bosons and jets in an event.
The process by which measured events are corrected to particle level is called
unfolding.
The simplest form of unfolding is a bin-by-bin correction for which the
ratio of the Monte Carlo particle-level and reconstructed-level distributions
is formed, and used to correct each bin of the measured data distribution.
The limitation of this approach is that migrations of events between bins
are not correctly accounted for. The next simplest approach would be to
treat the problem as one of inverting a matrix which relates particle-level and
reconstructed-level quantities. Again, this approach has its limitations ren-
dering it unsuitable for this analysis; namely that it is strongly affected by
large statistical fluctuations which may in turn be interpreted as real struc-
ture. This would be a large problem, since the migration matrices were formed
1As described here, the leptons at particle level are dressed, i.e. the lepton kinematics
include the four-momentum of the photons radiated within a cone of radius 0.1 around the
final state lepton direction. Particle-level jets are clustered from final state hadrons and
their decay products, this excludes the dressed W and Z-decay products.
114 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
from Monte Carlo with limited statistics. Therefore, in this analysis, unfold-
ing was achieved by using a Bayesian iterative procedure utilising Monte Carlo
samples.
This chapter describes the rationale behind Bayesian unfolding, the method
by which unfolding was performed in this analysis, and the systematic uncer-
tainties associated with that method. Finally, unfolded electron channel data
distributions are presented, for both the W+jets and Z+jets channels2.
6.1 Bayes Theorem
Given a probability space, P(S), with two subspaces, P(A) and P(B), Bayes
theorem of conditional probability describes the probability that an event will
occur in space A, given that it has occurred in space B, provided that A and
B overlap:
P (A | B) =
P (A B)
P (B)
(6.1)
Likewise, the probability that an event occurs in space B given it has
occurred in space A can be written as:
P (B | A) =
P (B  A)
P (A)
(6.2)
A  B and B  A are equivalent and as such we can combine Equations 6.1
and 6.2 to form the equation relating P (A | B) and P (B | A). This is known
as Bayes theorem:
2The plots shown in Section 6.5, and in Chapter 8, were created using a common plotting
macro for the purposes of presenting the final combined ratio results, to which the author
contributed some cosmetic work. They are therefore not the sole product of the authors
work. For the plots shown, the author contributed the full set of electron channel unfolded
data distributions, and for each distribution the full propagation of each individual system-
atic uncertainty source through the unfolding. Here the author also contributed the electron
channel particle-level ALPGEN and SHERPA distributions, and for each distribution the
corrections to BLACKHAT+SHERPA discussed in Sections 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3.
6.1. BAYES THEOREM 115
P (A | B) =
P (B | A)P (A)
P (B)
(6.3)
In Equation 6.3, P(A) is referred to as the prior , that is, the initial estima-
tion of the probability of an event occurring in space A. P (A | B) is referred
to as the posterior , the updated probability of A, given what is known about
P(B). Equation 6.3 can be further generalised by treating the total probability
space P(S) as a sum of disjoint subsets, Ai, and as such we can form the law
of total probability:
P (A | B) =
P (B | A)P (A)
iP (B | Ai)P (Ai)
(6.4)
Thus Equation 6.4 can provide a powerful tool for making statistical infer-
ences about hypotheses, given experimental observations.
6.1.1 Practical Application of Bayes Theorem
We wish to employ Bayes Theorem for the means of this analysis, i.e. to cor-
rect the measured data for known detector effects and acceptances, in order to
retrieve the particle-level data distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to for-
mulate Equation 6.4 in terms of binned histograms. In this case, the posteriors
are elements of a Monte Carlo-based unfolding matrix, MMCij . The matrix de-
scribes the probability, P (TMCI ), of an event existing in bin i of a particle-level
histogram, TMCi , given that the event lies in bin j of the reconstructed-level
histogram, RMCj . Written in the nomenclature of conditional probability the
unfolding matrix elements describe P (TMCi | RMCj ). We can therefore rewrite
Equation 6.4 in these terms to yield:
P (TMCi | R
j ) =
P (RMCj | TMCi )P (TMCi )
iP (R
j | TMCi )P (T
(6.5)
where P (RMCj | TMCi ) are elements of a response matrix, a description of
the probability of measured data, given the particle-level distribution. Here
116 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
P (TMCi ) acts as the prior knowledge and relates to elements of a 1-dimensional
particle-level histogram from a suitable Monte Carlo physics model.
Finally, the unfolding matrix can be applied to the measured data distribu-
tion, RDataj , to correct for detector effects and yield the unfolded particle-level
distribution:
UDatai = jP (T
i | R
j )(R
j ) (6.6)
The distribution UDatai can be then be used for comparisons with theoretical
predictions. This very useful application of Bayes theorem to the unfolding
of experimental data was first proposed by DAgostini [78].
6.2 Unfolding Method
The iterative Bayesian unfolding technique described in the previous section
was implemented using the RooUnfold package [79]. RooUnfold provides a
C++ based framework. It takes as inputs ROOT ntuples containing the
particle-level and reconstructed-level Monte Carlo distributions (TMC and
RMC), the response matrix (as described in the previous section) and the
observed data distribution (RData) for each observable.
At this stage in the analysis, RData refers to the distribution of data events
that pass the event selection described in Section 4.3, and after a bin-by-
bin histogram subtraction of all background distributions. The background
distributions are those estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (as described in
Section 4.1), and the QCD and tt background distributions obtained through
the methods described in Chapter 5.
As can be seen from Equation 6.5, the solution to the unfolding matrix
depends on the particle-level Monte Carlo. In order to reduce the dependence
on the particle-level distribution, as simulated using Monte Carlo, an iterative
procedure was used. For the first iteration of this technique, TMCi was used
as the prior in Equation 6.5. UDatai was then computed from Equation 6.6,
6.2. UNFOLDING METHOD 117
and was in turn used as the prior for the subsequent iteration and so on. The
number of iterations performed therefore acted as a regularisation parameter,
defining the relative weight of the Monte Carlo particle-level sample, compared
to the data. If this regularisation parameter has a small value, it indicates
favour towards Monte Carlo, with larger values favouring more the data. It is
preferable to have the smallest possible dependence on a prior physics model.
However, with an increasing number of iterations, the statistical uncertainty
associated with the Monte Carlo sample used increases. The value of the
regularisation parameter was therefore chosen to reflect the balance between
reducing Monte Carlo dependence on the unfolded data and keeping the size of
the statistical uncertainty tolerable (this is discussed in the following sections).
ALPGEN Monte Carlo samples were used for the unfolding procedure de-
scribed in this chapter. This is because ALPGEN was found to provide a
satisfactory description of the measured detector-level distributions for the
lepton and jet kinematics studied in this analysis (see Chapter 4)3.
6.2.1 Response Matrices
For this analysis, the response matrix mentioned in the previous section was
a 2-dimensional histogram filled with the numbers of ALPGEN Monte Carlo
events at reconstructed-level and particle-level. Reconstructed-level and particle-
level Monte Carlo events were required to have passed the event selection shown
in Table 6.1. A separate matrix with specific binning was created and filled
for each observable to be unfolded.
Figure 6.1 shows the electron channel response matrices for exclusive jet
multiplicity, leading jet PT and leading jet rapidity, in the both the W+jets
and Z+jets channels. As presented here, the reconstructed values are given
3From the detector level distributions it was clear that ALPGEN provides a better de-
scription of the data than SHERPA. SHERPA was used for closure tests (described in Section
6.2.3), but the uncertainty associated with the Monte Carlo model was determined using
ALPGEN samples with varied parameters (described in more detail in Section 6.3.2).

on the vertical axis, with the corresponding particle-level (or hadron-level),
values are given on the horizontal axis. Each column has been normalised
to the total number of particle-level events (for exclusive jet multiplicity), or
total number of jets (for leading jet PT and rapidity) that pass the acceptance
selection for that particular bin. Therefore, the sum of all elements in a given
column represents the reconstruction efficiency for that particle-level bin.
As expected, most events lie on the diagonal of the matrix, meaning that
particle-level events are reconstructed in the same bin. However, non-negligible
off-diagonal elements are visible for some distributions, particularly leading jet
PT . These elements represent the case where a particle-level event or jet has
been reconstructed in a different bin, this is known as migration. For jet
PT , matrix migrations can, and do, occur into and out of regions of the jet PT
spectrum lower than the analysis selection threshold (30 GeV). To account for
such migrations, the jet PT cut for the unfolding of jet PT distributions was
loosened to 20 GeV.

120 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
6.2.2 Fake Corrections
Events outside of the analysis phase space at particle level can be reconstructed
(migrate) into the fiducial phase space of the analysis at detector level. Such
migrations lead to reconstructed distributions that contain extra events not
present in the corresponding particle-level distribution. Excess reconstructed-
level events can arise from a number of sources, including:
 Jets reconstructed above the PT threshold of the analysis that neverthe-
less correspond to a particle-level jet below the threshold.
 Vector bosons passing the fiducial cuts at reconstructed level and failing
at particle level.
 Pile-up jets.
A correction was calculated to account for the effect of such additional
fake events on the unfolding procedure. A bin-by-bin fake correction was
determined for each observable4. The correction was defined as the ratio of
the number of events that pass both the reconstructed-level and particle-level
selections to the total number of events that pass the selection at reconstructed
level:
F icorr =
# events in bin i that pass both reconstructed and particle-level selections
Total # reconstructed events in bin i
(6.7)
The ratio was formed using ALPGEN signal Monte Carlo and applied be-
fore unfolding to both the data distribution RData (after background subtrac-
tion), and the reconstructed level Monte Carlo distribution, RMC .
Figure 6.2 shows the size of the electron channel fake corrections for exclu-
sive jet multiplicity, leading jet PT and leading jet rapidity, in both the W+jets
4The fake correction was applied as a multiplicative factor, a correction close to one
means the effective correction is small, i.e. the reconstructed distributions before and after

and Z+jets channels. For the exclusive jet multiplicity correction, the numera-
tor is the number of events that pass the boson selection at both reconstructed
level and particle level. The denominator is the total number of events passing
the boson selection at reconstructed level. For the leading jet PT and rapidity
corrections, the numerator requirements are extended to include events that
not only pass the boson selection at reconstructed and particle levels, but also
contain at least one reconstructed-level jet and at least one particle-level jet.
The denominator in this case is the total number of reconstructed-level events
passing the boson selection, with at least one reconstructed-level jet.
The rate of fake events (and therefore the size of the fake correction) is
largely impacted by pile-up effects. This can be seen in Figure 6.2, in which
large corrections in the low jet PT region are observed. This is the kinematic
region in which pile-up is most prominent. Furthermore, the large increase in
the fake rate at a rapidity of about 2.5 represents the move from the central
region of the detector to the end-caps, and a further increase in fake rate
above about 3.8 represents the move from the end-caps to the forward region
of the detector. The detector response for jets in the end-caps and the forward
region is lower than in the central region, thus we see larger fake rates in these
kinematic regions. For all distributions, the correction is consistently larger
for the W+jets channel than for the Z+jets channel. This is once again is
attributable to pile-up effects, which have a large impact on the reconstruction
of missing transverse energy, essential for the reconstruction of the W boson.
At reconstructed-level, the jets used to build the response matrices and fake
correction numerator were not required to match a particle-level jet within a
specific cone. This approach corresponds to that used in the previous W+jets
ATLAS analysis with the 2010 dataset [80]. In the previous Z+jets ATLAS
analysis with the 2011 dataset [81], the matching procedure was employed.
This alternative approach was investigated and compared with the nominal
no-matching approach applied to this analysis. The impact was found to be
negligible on the unfolded cross-section measurements.
122 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
Figure 6.3 shows the electron channel unfolded data distributions in the
W+jets and Z+jets channel, for exclusive jet multiplicity, leading jet PT and
rapidity. Figure 6.4 shows the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio distributions for the same variables.
The ratio cannot be directly unfolded, instead it is formed by taking the ratio
of the unfolded W+jets and Z+jets distributions. Each figure presents the
results achieved for unfolding with different numbers of Bayesian iterations
(1-6), with comparison to particle-level results from ALPGEN Monte Carlo.
For the distributions shown in Figures 6.3 and 6.4, the difference in the results
obtained with different numbers of iterations is small.
6.2.3 Closure Tests
Two closure tests were used to assess the validity of the unfolding procedure, as
performed by the RooUnfold framework. The first involved replacing the data
distribution used as input to RooUnfold with the corresponding ALPGEN
Monte Carlo distribution at reconstructed level, i.e. replacing RData with
RMC . All other unfolding inputs (response matrix, fake correction, ALPGEN
particle-level and reconstructed-level distributions) were unchanged. The same
ALPGEN sample was used both in place of RData and for the construction of
the unfolding matrix. Therefore, it was expected that the resulting unfolded
distribution will agree very well with the corresponding ALPGEN particle-
level distribution, across all bins and for all variables. The second closure test
acted as a check of the dependancy of the unfolded results on the chosen Monte
Carlo physics model, by using the reconstructed-level distribution modelled by
SHERPA in place of RData, instead of the distribution modelled by ALPGEN.
Both closure tests were performed for 1-6 Bayesian iterations, the results
for the electron channel are shown in Figures 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7, for exclusive
jet multiplicity, leading jet PT and rapidity. Results are shown in the W+jets,
Z+jets and W+jets

channels. As expected, for the ALPGEN closure test there
is perfect agreement between the unfolded reconstructed-level ALPGEN distri-

butions and the corresponding ALPGEN particle-level distributions. For the
closure test with SHERPA, very good closure is achieved for most of the distri-
butions, with deviations occurring in the regions of low Monte Carlo statistics.
The shape differences between ALPGEN and SHERPA are small, yet they are
still an overestimation of the potential effect on unfolded data. The differences
between data and ALPGEN at detector level are generally smaller than the
shape differences between ALPGEN and SHERPA. This was one of the jus-
tifications for using ALPGEN samples for unfolding, and why the unfolding
model uncertainty is evaluated with ALPGEN samples with shifted parameters
(see Section 6.3.2).
The unfolded ratio measurement cannot be directly achieved by imple-
menting Bayesian unfolding. It has to be formed by taking the ratio of the
two statistically uncorrelated unfolded results for W and Z, thus rendering it
more susceptible to the statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo samples and
the data than either the W or Z measurements. One can see for the closure
tests for the ratio measurements that the effect of such uncorrelated statistical
fluctuations is negligible.
The results of the closure tests are largely similar for each number of
Bayesian iterations, therefore the closure test could not be used to inform
the decision on how many iterations to employ for the unfolding of data in
this analysis. Instead, the number of iterations to use was decided upon after
investigating how the systematic uncertainty related to the unfolding method
(described in detail in Section 6.3) behaved for different numbers of iterations.
We wished to find the number of iterations for which the uncertainty was min-
imum, this proved to be between one and three for most variables. Therefore,
two was chosen as the nominal number of iterations used for the unfolding in
this analysis.

130 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
6.3 Systematic Uncertainties on the Unfold-
ing Technique
The systematic uncertainties associated with the unfolding method described
above can be broken down into two components; (i) those pertaining to the
statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo sample used, (ii) those pertaining to
the modelling of jet characteristics as implemented by the Monte Carlo sample
chosen for unfolding. The methods of evaluating the two sources of systematic
uncertainty are described below.
6.3.1 Statistical Unfolding Uncertainty
Toy Monte Carlo experiments were used to evaluate the unfolding uncertainty
arising from limited statistics. Each of the unfolding inputs (Monte Carlo
particle-level and reconstructed-level distributions, fake corrections and re-
sponse matrices) were smeared according to a Gaussian distribution. The
contents of each bin were varied according to a Gaussian distribution with
a mean and sigma corresponding to the number and root mean square of the
Monte Carlo events in that particular bin respectively. In order to avoid double
smearing of events that are present at both reconstructed-level and particle-
level, the distributions to be smeared were split into four discrete samples:
1. Particle-level events that had a corresponding event at reconstructed
level.
2. Reconstructed-level events that had a corresponding event at particle
level.
3. Particle-level events with no corresponding reconstructed-level event.
4. Reconstructed-level events with no corresponding particle-level event.
Each sample was smeared independently, after which the reconstructed-
level and particle-level distributions were rebuilt. The particle-level distribu-
tion was built via a bin-by-bin sum of histograms from samples (1) and (3).
6.3. UNCERTAINTIES ON THE UNFOLDING TECHNIQUE 131
Likewise, the reconstructed-level distributions were built via a sum of his-
togram from samples (2) and (4). The data was then unfolded according to
the method described above, but using the varied inputs. This was repeated
100 times and the root mean square of the average of the 100 results was taken
as the unfolding statistics systematic uncertainty.
6.3.2 Model Unfolding Uncertainty
The unfolding uncertainty associated with the modelling of jet characteristics
by ALPGEN was evaluated by separately unfolding the data with five different
sets of ALPGEN samples, each with varied parameters. Specifically, the mini-
mum parton PT and the cone size of the MLM parton-jet matching
5 [82] were
varied. The effect of changing the amount of radiation emitted by hard par-
tons was also considered, by varying the QCD renormalisation/factorisation
scales to twice and half the nominal values6. The data were unfolded with
each of the varied ALPGEN samples in place of the nominal, and the offset
from the nominal unfolded results was considered to be a source of systematic
uncertainty. The five systematic uncertainties were then added in quadrature
to form the total unfolding model uncertainty. Table 6.2 presents a breakdown
of the electron channel unfolding statistical and modelling errors, in bins of
exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicity. Figure 6.8 shows the unfolding uncer-
tainties, and their quadratic sum, for exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicity,
leading jet PT and rapidity.
5The MLM matching procedure is employed in ALPGEN to remove any double counting
between partons from the matrix element calculation and those from the parton shower.
6ALPGEN Monte Carlo simulations employ a nominal value for the renormalisa-
tion/factorisation scales of
M2V + P
, where V is the W or Z boson.

6.4 Systematic Uncertainties on the Unfolded
Results
In addition to the systematic variations specifically related to the unfolding
method, each of the systematic uncertainties mentioned in the preceding chap-
ters was also propagated through the unfolding. Those variations, pertaining
to the jet energy scale (JES), jet energy resolution (JER), lepton and EmissT
uncertainties were propagated by shifting the reconstructed signal Monte Carlo
distributions, the Monte Carlo backgrounds, the unfolding matrices and fake
corrections. The data driven QCD and tt backgrounds were re-estimated using
shifted Monte Carlo templates corresponding to the uncertainty to be evalu-
ated, and those varied background estimates were used in the unfolding. For
those systematic uncertainties relating to a specific background process (i.e.
from Monte Carlo normalisation, or directly related to the data-driven tech-
nique), the variations were applied to the relevant background sample. This
applied to both backgrounds estimated with Monte Carlo and those derived
from data-driven techniques. All other inputs were unvaried in this case. The
unfolding procedure was then performed for each systematic variation, tak-
ing each time the combination of nominal and varied inputs mentioned above.
The components of each systematic uncertainty were propagated individually,
e.g. the five up and five down electron energy scale uncertainties (see Section
4.4.4.1) were each treated separately. After unfolding each kinematic distribu-
tion, the individual systematic uncertainties were stored as variations from the
nominal unfolded results. This way, the systematic sources could be treated
individually in the combination technique (see Chapter 8).
Finally, the value for luminosity by which the Monte Carlo samples were
scaled to data was deemed to have an associated error of 1.8% [83]. This
error was propagated through the unfolding by scaling all inputs from Monte
Carlo up and down by the luminosity 1.8% and once again unfolding the
data distributions.
6.5. ELECTRON CHANNEL RESULTS UNFOLDED TO PARTICLE LEVEL135
Tables 6.3 and 6.4 present the systematic uncertainties on the unfolded
inclusive jet multiplicity measurements for the electron and muon channels.
Shown are the uncertainties on the W+jets and Z+jets channels, and the
W+jets
Z+jets
ratio. Here the sources of uncertainty have been grouped and summed in
quadrature for the purpose of providing an overview. Uncertainties on JES and
jet energy resolution (JER) are the largest source of uncertainty in the separate
lepton channels, but are highly correlated between the W+jets and Z+jets
channels. Therefore, they are largely cancelled for the ratio measurement.
Despite large cancellation, for low jet multiplicities, JES and JER are still the
dominant source of uncertainty on the ratio measurement. This is because
variations due to JES and JER were propagated to the measurement of EmissT
in each event, yielding larger overall variations in the W+jets channel. The
size of background processes is also larger for W+jets than Z+jets (see Tables
4.5 and 4.6), resulting in a larger overall jet uncertainty in the W+jets channel.
A final observation is that in the individual lepton channels, the JES and
JER uncertainties on the ratio measurement are slightly larger in the electron
channel than in the muon channel. At low jet multiplicities, this is mainly
due to the Z  ee background in the W  e selection being larger than the
corresponding Z   background in the W   selection. This is because
one electron from Z  ee events can be mis-identified as a jet, thus contribut-
ing to the total JES and JER uncertainties. At higher jet multiplicities (up
to around 5 jets), the JES and JER uncertainties are larger in the electron
channel due to fluctuations of the tt fit, described in Section 5.2.3.

previous sections. The data is compared with theoretical predictions from
BLACKHAT+SHERPA, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The theoretical predictions
will be discussed in more detail in the following chapter. Figure 6.9 shows
the unfolded measurements for exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicity. Figure
6.10 shows the measurement for leading and second-leading jet PT in events
with at least one and two jets respectively. Finally, Figure 6.11 shows the
unfolded measurements for the scalar sum of all jet PT in events with at least
two jets, and leading jet rapidity for events with at least one jet. All results
are shown for both W+jets and Z+jets channels. The corresponding muon
channel results were unfolded using the same method described above. To
form the final ratio measurement for each kinematic variable, the results from
the two lepton channels were combined. Chapter 8 presents a discussion of the
combination technique and the final unfolded ratio results.

142 CHAPTER 6. UNFOLDING TO PARTICLE LEVEL
Chapter 7
Theoretical Predictions
The data which has been unfolded to particle level is presented with compar-
isons to theoretical predictions in Chapter 8. Two separate multiple-parton
leading-order predictions, matched to leading-log parton shower approxima-
tions, are obtained from ALPGEN and SHERPA. Additionally, comparisons
are made to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions for parton
multiplicities zero to four, provided by BLACKHAT+SHERPA (BH+S) [26,
27, 28].
This chapter presents a study on leading-order theoretical predictions to
demonstrate the sensitivity of the ratio measurement to differences in QCD
radiation modelling. Also discussed in this chapter are the sources of system-
atic uncertainty associated with next-to-leading order predictions provided by
BH+S, and the corrections to BH+S required before accurate comparison with
data can be made.
7.1 Sensitivity Study with Leading-Order Pre-
dictions
As mentioned above, the leading-order theoretical predictions provided by
ALPGEN and SHERPA employ different methods of modelling the parton
144 CHAPTER 7. THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
shower and different matching procedures. The former is interfaced with
HERWIG to model the parton shower and hadronisation, and uses the MLM
matching procedure (performing a geometric measure of jet cones to analyse
unconstrained radiation) [22]. SHERPA contains its own parton shower and
uses the CKKW matching procedure which is based on parton showers which
have been truncated [24, 84]. The matrix element calculations are the same for
ALPGEN and SHERPA. With this knowledge, a study to compare the ratio
as predicted by ALPGEN+HERWIG and SHERPA was performed. The aim
of the study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio predictions to
perturbative QCD predictions of radiation effects. Since the ratio is insensitive
to non-perturbative effects and has a negligible sensitivity to choice of PDFs1,
the differences in their ratio predictions can be explained by the aforemen-
tioned differences in parton shower modelling and matching scheme, and thus
their respective modelling of QCD radiation effects.
Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show the results of this study for leading jet PT and
ST distributions respectively, where ST is the scalar PT sum of all jets in the
event. The variables considered in this study are a subset of those this analysis
measured. They were chosen because they are kinematic variables for which
there are significant differences in the behaviour of W+jets and Z+jets events.
The figures show a clear impact of the differences in radiation modelling on the
ratio measurement. The shape of the ratio indicates differences in radiation
between W+jets and Z+jets events. A flat ratio, as a function of PT , would
suggest that W+jets and Z+jets radiate energy at the same rate. For the ratios
in Figures 7.1 and 7.2, SHERPA falls less steeply and is generally flatter than
ALPGEN+HERWIG. This suggests SHERPA models a smaller difference than
ALPGEN+HERWIG in radiated energy between W+jets and Z+jets events.
The difference between the two predictions is as large as 8% in the lower PT
1A full cancellation of PDF effects is prevented primarily because of mass differences
between the W and Z and a residual b quark contribution from Z+jets events. However,
the cancellation is good to the level of a few percent.
7.2. NEXT-TO-LEADING ORDER PREDICTIONS 145
region, where differences between W+jets and Z+jets are expected.
The comparison of ratio predictions was performed in both electron and
muon channels, and both channels exhibit very similar differences between
ALPGEN+HERWIG and SHERPA. This is particularly evident in Figure 7.3
which shows the ratio comparison as a function of leading jet rapidity. For
this distribution, large deviations between the two predictions are observed at
high values of rapidity, and the same trend is seen in both lepton channels.
As previously mentioned, ALPGEN is interfaced with PHOTOS to provide
modelling of final state QED radiation, whereas SHERPA employs its own
QED radiation model. From this, and the similarity of the ratio prediction
comparisons across both lepton channels, we can conclude that QCD radiation
effects are independent of QED final state radiation. The decoupling of QED
and QCD radiation across the kinematic observables in this analysis, and the
shape differences of the ratio for different QCD radiation models, demonstrate
the sensitivity of the W+jets
Z+jets
measurement to QCD radiation from perturba-
tive QCD models. Comparisons of the predicted ratio with data unfolded to
particle level can therefore illuminate the successes and failures of the QCD
modelling of theoretical predictions. This will be further discussed in Chapter
7.2 Next-to-Leading Order Predictions
Next-to-leading order predictions are provided by BH+S, which uses CT10
PDFs [25]. The renormalisation and factorisation scales for these predictions
is HT/2, where HT is the per-event scalar sum of the PT of all particles and
partons in the final state. BH+S reconstructs jets at particle level, using the
anti-k algorithm with a cone size of 0.4.

148 CHAPTER 7. THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
7.2.1 Uncertainties on BH+S Predictions
Sources of systematic uncertainty on the BH+S predictions are threefold; un-
certainties on the renomalisation and factorisation scales, PDF uncertainties,
and the uncertainty on the value of s propagated through the evolution of the
PDFs. The individual uncertainties on the W+jets and Z+jets channels were
provided by the BH+S collaboration, the way in which they were evaluated is
described below.
The renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainty was evaluated by
varying the energy scale up and down to twice and half the nominal value, i.e.
HT and HT/4 respectively. The scale uncertainties are completely correlated
between W and Z channels, therefore for each variation the uncertainty on
the ratio was computed by simply taking the ratio of the varied W and Z
distributions and taking the deviation from the nominal ratio.
The PDF uncertainties were evaluated from the 52 CT10 eigenvectors pro-
vided by the PDF fitters. An envelope of the maximum and minimum values
for the ratio, achieved by varying each eigenvector independently, was taken
as the uncertainty.
The value of s used in for the next-to-leading order calculations is 0.118.
The uncertainty on the predictions arising from the uncertainty on s was
evaluated by varying the value used in the calculation up and down by 0.0012.
This uncertainty is a conservative estimate. However, the s uncertainty on
the final predictions is small compared to the dominant renormalisation scale
uncertainty. The s uncertainty was also considered in the evolution of the
PDF uncertainty. As with the scale uncertainties, the uncertainty on s is com-
pletely correlated between W and Z channels, therefore the ratio uncertainty
is evaluated in the same way, i.e. vary the W and Z distributions separately,
form the ratio of the varied distributions, then take the uncertainty as the
deviation of the varied ratio from the nominal ratio.
Each of the above systematics were added in quadrature to form the total
7.2. NEXT-TO-LEADING ORDER PREDICTIONS 149
systematic uncertainty on the BH+S predictions. In the individual W+jets
and Z+jets channels the dominant uncertainty is that related to the renormal-
isation scale. However, this uncertainty and the others mentioned are largely
reduced for the ratio prediction. For example, in both W+jets and Z+jets
channels the scale uncertainties on inclusive jet multiplicity are between 0.7-
11.4%, as jet multiplicity increases from 1-4. This uncertainty on the ratio is
between 0.7-2.3% in the same region. Breakdown plots for the uncertainties
on the BH+S predictions are shown in [77].
7.2.2 Corrections to BH+S Predictions
In order to make appropriate comparisons between measured data and the
BH+S predictions, a number of corrections must be first applied to the pre-
dictions. They are detailed below.
7.2.2.1 Non-Perturbative Corrections
The BH+S predictions are provided at parton level whereas the data is un-
folded to particle level. Therefore, the non-perturbative contributions associ-
ated with hadronisation and the underlying event (UE), involved in moving
from partons to hadrons, must be taken into account. The nominal ALP-
GEN+HERWIG+JIMMY Monte Carlo samples employed for the unfolding
technique (described in Chapter 6) were used to evaluate two separate sets of
bin-by-bin corrections for hadronisation and UE. The former correction was
defined as the ratio of the distributions obtained from the above mentioned
Monte Carlo when hadronic jets were selected, to those obtained by select-
ing parton jets. The BH+S predictions were formed using the lepton four-
momentum before photon radiation, i.e. at the W or Z vertex. Such leptons
are referred to as being at Born level. The distributions used in the numerator
and denominator were selected using Born-level leptons, i.e:
150 CHAPTER 7. THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
had =
hadron jets, Born leptons
parton jets, Born leptons
(7.1)
The UE correction was formed by using separate ALPGEN+JIMMY+HERWIG
samples generated without the underlying event. Another ratio was defined,
of the distributions formed with parton jets and Born-level leptons with and
without the underlying event, i.e.:
UE =
parton jets, UE on, Born leptons
parton jets, UE off, Born leptons
(7.2)
A systematic uncertainty on the above corrections was calculated by form-
ing a separate set of corrections with ALPGEN+PYTHIA samples with the
Perugia2011C tune [85]. The ALPGEN+PYTHIA samples utilise different
hadronisation models and UE tunes, and the systematic uncertainty was eval-
uated as the difference between the total correction, hadUE, as formed with
the nominal samples and those generated with ALPGEN+PYTHIA. These
corrections are shown in [77].
7.2.2.2 Corrections for QED Final State Radiation
The measured data distributions were formed from a selection which uses the
lepton four-momentum in the final state. This includes the radiation of pho-
tons within a cone of radius 0.1 around the bare lepton. Such leptons are
referred to as dressed. For comparison with data, BH+S had to be cor-
rected for QED final state radiation. Bin-by-bin corrections were once again
calculated using the nominal ALPGEN+HERWIG+JIMMY samples. The
corrections were applied as multiplicative factors, i.e. the closer a correction
factor was to one, the smaller the correction. They were defined as the ratio of
the parton level distributions obtained using a selection with dressed leptons,
to those selected with Born leptons, i.e:
fsr =
dressed leptons
Born leptons
(7.3)
7.2. NEXT-TO-LEADING ORDER PREDICTIONS 151
The systematic uncertainty on the QED final state radiation corrections
was calculated by comparing the corrections obtained with the nominal Monte
Carlo to those produced with SHERPA 1.4 samples. The latter employs its
own model for photon radiation which is based on the YFS method [86]. The
systematic uncertainty was once again taken as the difference between the two
sets of corrections and symmeterised around the nominal corrections.
Separate corrections were derived for each kinematic distribution measured
in this analysis. Figures 7.4 and 7.5 present two example distributions of the
QED final state radiation corrections, shown are the corrections for exclusive
jet multiplicity, leading jet PT and rapidity, and the ST for events with at least
two jets. The corrections are mostly flat for these variables.
7.2.2.3 Acceptance Corrections
A final set of corrections were applied to the BH+S predictions to correct for
the phase space selection employed. In the individual lepton channels, the mea-
sured data was from a selection in the fiducial phase space of that channel (as
described in Chapter 4). The BH+S predictions were provided in the common
phase space, defined in Table 8.1, in which the lepton has ||< 2.5. There-
fore, for data comparisons with BH+S in the individual channels, a bin-by-bin
acceptance correction must be applied. The acceptance corrections for each
distribution were calculated using the nominal ALPGEN+HERWIG+JIMMY
samples and was defined as the ratio of the distribution obtained from a se-
lection in the fiducial phase space to a selection in the common phases space,
fsr =
Fiducial lepton phase space
Common phase space
(7.4)
When the lepton channels were combined, the inverse of the quantity was
applied to the measured data distributions to move them into a common phase
space. As for the QED corrections, the acceptance corrections were applied as

tions was evaluated in the same way as for the QED corrections: an alternative
set of corrections was formed using SHERPA samples and their difference from
the nominal is symmeterised around the nominal corrections.
Figures 7.6 and 7.7 present examples of the acceptance corrections, shown

acceptance corrections are larger, this is expected as in this case there are two

space requirements.

Combined Results and
Discussion
In this chapter, the method of combining the electron and muon channel mea-
surements is discussed, and the final W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurements are presented
as a function of exclusive and inclusive jet multiplicity up to four jets. The ratio
is also presented as a function of a host of kinematic variables for which there
are significant differences in the behaviour of W+jets and Z+jets events. This
is especially true in the kinematic regions where the mass differences between
the W and Z affect the scale of partonic radiation from hard processes, and
polarisation differences affect the kinematics of decay products upon which the
event selections are based. The ratio is presented as a function of the PT and
rapidity of the leading and sub-leading jets in an event, the di-jet variables
pertaining to the kinematics of the two leading jets, and the scalar sum of the
PT of all jets in an event
Comparisons with theoretical predictions discussed in the previous chapter
are presented, providing a test of how well such predictions describe the pertur-
bative QCD processes to which the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio is sensitive (as demonstrated

deemed less relevant to the scope of the analysis. Therefore, only those more relevant to the

8.1 Combination of Electron and Muon Chan-
Once the electron and muon channel measurements have been unfolded to par-
ticle level, they were combined, exploiting lepton universality. This increases
the statistics of the measurements and thus improves the precision of the differ-
ential cross-section measurements. Before combination, the individual lepton
channels were extrapolated from their respective fiducial phase space into a
common phase space (defined in Table 8.1) by correcting the lepton  require-
ment from the fiducial selection to ||<2.5. Bin-by-bin acceptance correction
factors derived using ALPGEN Monte Carlo samples in the manner described
in Section 7.2.2.3 were applied to each distribution, but since we were extrapo-
lating from fiducial to common phase space, they were defined as the reciprocal
of Equation 7.4. Once extrapolated, the individual lepton channels were com-
pared and the results were found to be compatible within their respective total
(statistical+ systematic) uncertainties.

The combination was achieved via an averaging procedure as described in
[87, 88] whereby each distribution is combined separately by minimising the

where the index k runs over the two lepton channel sets of extrapolated
measurements, i runs over the bins in each distribution and j runs over the
correlated-across-bins sources of systematic uncertainty. The function is de-
pendent on mi and bj, respectively the combined measurement (number of
events) in bin i and the size of the systematic uncertainty j. istat,k and
iuncor,k are the relative statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties
on a measurement in bin i respectively. ij,k is the relative correlated system-
atic uncertainty and quantifies the influence of the correlated error source j
on the measurement in bin i in the dataset k. Finally, ik are the original
measurements, the deviation of mi from which is minimised.
For this approach, most sources of systematic uncertainty were treated
as completely correlated across all channels and bins. They were the jet en-
ergy scale (JES), unfolding model, luminosity, Monte Carlo background un-
certainties and all systematic uncertainties associated with the data driven tt
background estimation (as described in Section 5.2.4), except the statistical
uncertainty on the tt fit. Systematic uncertainties treated as correlated across
bins, but independent between lepton channels, were the lepton uncertainties
and those systematic uncertainties associated with the data driven QCD esti-
mation as described in Section 5.1.3. The statistical uncertainties associated
with data and Monte Carlo predictions, and the statistical uncertainties on the
unfolding method and the tt fit, were all treated as completely uncorrelated
across all bins and lepton channels. Also treated as completely uncorrelated
was the jet energy resolution (JER) uncertainties2.
2The JER uncertainties were treated as uncorrelated for technical reasons relating to the
code which performed the combination. Work is ongoing to include the JER uncertainties
as correlated, in the same way as JES. The effect of treating JER uncorrelated is not very

8.2 Results
This section presents the unfolded combined electron and muon channel W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurements, with comparisons to theoretical predictions at leading or-
der from ALPGEN and SHERPA, and next-to-leading order from BLACK-
HAT+SHERPA, after the corrections described in Section 7.2.2 have been
applied. The distributions as a function of jet multiplicity correspond to the
actual data luminosity. All other distributions have been normalised to unity,
such that the shapes of the distributions of data and theoretical predictions to
be accurately compared. The normalisation was achieved by dividing the mea-
sured differential cross-section distributions for the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio by the total
cross-section obtained for the ratio of W+jets and Z+jets events, in corre-
sponding jet multiplicity bin, as presented in Figure 8.1.
8.2.1 Jet Multiplicity
Figure 8.1 shows the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio combined measurement as a function of exclu-
sive (left) and inclusive (right) jet multiplicity. For exclusive jet multiplicity,
a good agreement with data is observed for both ALPGEN and BLACK-
HAT+SHERPA predictions. The good agreement excludes the zero-jet bin in
which a discrepancy of approximately 2 is observed for both predictions. The
SHERPA predictions describe the data less well. As jet multiplicity increases,
SHERPA systematically overestimates the value of the ratio such that at high
multiplicities (the region in which the effects of hard QCD radiation are tested)
the discrepancy is as large as 1.5.
For inclusive jet multiplicity, the data once again favours the predictions
from ALPGEN while SHERPA increasingly overestimates the ratio with in-
creasing jet multiplicity. The observed discrepancy between data and BLACK-
HAT+SHERPA in the higher jet multiplicity bins is expected. This is because
BLACKHAT+SHERPA predictions are only available up to an exclusive jet
large and therefore has a negligible impact on the final results.

multiplicity of four, and are therefore not directly comparable to data in the
high inclusive jet multiplicity region.
8.2.2 Leading Jet PT
Figures 8.2 and 8.3 respectively show the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurements as a func-
tion of leading jet PT , for events with at least one jet (both lepton channels
and the combined measurement) and exactly one jet. All distributions are
normalised to their respective jet multiplicity bins as shown in Figure 8.1. In
both distributions, a shape difference between W+jets and Z+jets events is
observed in data for the region below 200 GeV, evidenced by the decay of the
ratio values in this region before flattening out. The shape difference between
the leading jet PT distributions for W+jets and Z+jets events can be attributed
to the differing mass of the W and Z bosons which in turn affects the scale
of partonic radiation. Polarisation differences between the W and Z affect
162 CHAPTER 8. COMBINED RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
the kinematic properties of their decay products, on which the fiducial event
selections described in Section 4.1 are applied. For this reason, polarisation
differences will also affect the shape of the W+jets and Z+jets distributions,
contributing to the observed shape differences.
As shown in Section 7.1 (Figure 7.1), ALPGEN predictions for this distri-
bution are steeper than the corresponding SHERPA predictions. The region
below 80 GeV is where radiative parton shower effects are important and is
thus the region that provides a test of the radiation model employed in the
theoretical predictions. In this region we observe that the data is steeper than
both predictions but in better agreement with ALPGEN than with SHERPA.
This suggests the need for the generators to employ a better tuning of the
parton shower interfaced to the matrix element.
In the region of high leading jet PT (400-700 GeV) for events with at
least one jet, we observe a systematic underestimation of the combined data
across all predictions. This effect appears to be led by the electron channel.
The individual lepton channel results show the consistent underestimation of
approximately 1 in the electron channel, yet a consistent overestimation in
this region in the muon channel, albeit of smaller magnitude. Such a deviation
is not observed in the combined ratio distribution for events with exactly one
jet in the final state since there are insufficient statistics in the high PT region
of the Z+jets distribution to see such an effect. This statistical limitation
derives from the high likelihood of a jet of 400-700 GeV radiating a jet of at
least 30 GeV.
Figures 8.4 and 8.5 show the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio as a function of leading jet PT
for events with at least two and three jets respectively, where the specific
requirement that the event contain a second (or third) jet of at least 30 GeV
has been imposed. In these cases, the difference between the generators in how
the parton shower is matched to the higher multiplicity matrix element is of
greater importance than the case of events with at least one jet.
For events with at least two jets, the first observation is that the general

shapes of the data distributions are different than for events with at least and
exactly one jet. Specifically, the data fall less steeply in the lower PT region of
the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio. This suggests that the differences between W+jets and Z+jets
events discussed above propagate to the kinematics of higher multiplicity jets,
as opposed to the case of at least one jet in the final state. This effect can be
explained by the fact that, in such events, two jets can now recoil against each
other which leaves W and Z bosons of a lower PT than when there is only one
jet. Since the average boson PT is lower than the leading jet PT , the effect of
the mass and polarisation differences is reduced with respect to the case with
at least one jet. This W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurement is therefore more sensitive to
QCD effects.
The W+jets
Z+jets
ratio for the combined electron and muon channels in Figure 8.4
exhibits similar features to that in Figure 8.2, namely that the data favours
ALPGEN over SHERPA. This conclusion appears to be driven by the muon
channel, since the electron channel distribution favours neither ALPGEN nor
8.2. RESULTS 165
SHERPA. Again for the combined result, in the low PT region where differences
between W+jets and Z+jets events are most pronounced, ALPGEN is still
somewhat lacking in its ability to accurately predict the data distribution.
For the individual W+jets and Z+jets measurements (shown in Figure 8.6),
there are significant discrepancies between ALPGEN and BLACKHAT+SHERPA
at low PT . This difference can be attributed to the lack, in BLACKHAT+SHERPA,
of parton shower matching to the matrix element in the fixed order next-to-
leading order calculation. The effect of this lack of correction is significantly
cancelled in the ratio, for which ALPGEN and BLACKHAT+SHERPA pre-
dictions are in good agreement at low PT . On the contrary, the effect of
including the correction (but in different ways) is not cancelled, as observed
by the differences between ALPGEN and SHERPA in this region, which is
sensitive to differences between W+jets and Z+jets. The high PT regions of
the distributions in Figure 8.4 exhibit similar discrepancies as observed in the
distributions presented in Figure 8.2 and described above.
The ratio distribution as a function of leading jet PT for events with at
least three jets (Figure 8.5) exhibits similar properties as that for at least two
jets. The discrepancy between ALPGEN and BLACKHAT+SHERPA in the
low PT region is more pronounced for this distribution, suggesting that the
lack of parton showering matched to matrix element is increasingly important
for events with at least three jets of roughly the same PT . Furthermore, this
effect does not cancel in the ratio and is thus of different magnitude for W+jets
and Z+jets events.

Figures 8.7 and 8.8 present the combined W+jets

ratio measurements as a func-
tion of the second and third most energetic jets for events with at least two
and three jets in the final state. At low PT , these distributions are probing the
lowest energy jet in an event. With increasing PT , there will be an increasing

fraction of these events with a lower PT jet than the one probed. This contri-
bution is marginal, however, it is nevertheless expected that the low and high
PT regions of the distributions shown will exhibit different levels of agreement
between the data and theoretical predictions and will be discussed separately
below.
In the region of low PT , the data agrees well with the predictions pro-
vided by ALPGEN and BLACKHAT+SHERPA. As with the leading jet PT
distributions presented above, SHERPA falls less steeply than the data in this
region. SHERPA is therefore less sensitive to the differences between W+jets
and Z+jets events, radiating similar amounts of energy through the softest jet
PT for both W+jets and Z+jets events.
In the region of high PT , we observe trends similar to those in the leading
jet PT distributions for events with at least one jet, i.e. that all theoretical
predictions underestimate the data in the electron channel while overestimat-
ing the data in the muon channel. However, the conclusions in the region are
somewhat affected by larger systematic uncertainties and data fluctuations
than in the leading jet PT distribution.
Similar trends can be observed for the third jet PT distribution in Figure
8.8 but are less pronounced due to the flatter nature of the ratio and the large
uncertainties on the measurement.
8.2.4 Scalar Sum PT
Figure 8.9 shows the W+jets

ratio measurement as a function of ST , the scalar
sum of the PT of all jets in an event, for events with at least two jets and exactly
two jets respectively. This variable is often used in searches for new high-mass
particles. The effects on the ST distributions for events with more than two
jets are obscured by large systematic uncertainties and data fluctuations, and
are therefore not shown.
In the region of low ST , it is observed that ALPGEN provides a better

description of QCD radiation as there is a better agreement in this region
with the data distribution than for SHERPA, which once again exhibits a
less steeply falling, flatter ratio. In the region of high ST , the data do not
particularly agree with one theory prediction over another. The observations
for the ratio in both low and high ST regions are similar to those for leading
and sub-leading jet PT ratio distributions. This is to be expected since ST is
the scalar sum of all jet PT in an event.
BLACKHAT+SHERPA predictions do not include higher-order contribu-
tions in the calculation of ST . This means that higher multiplicity jets that
contribute to the PT sum in the high ST region are not included, therefore
BLACKHAT+SHERPA does not describe this ST region of the individual
W+jets and Z+jets distributions very well. However, this effect is significantly
cancelled when the ratio is formed, yielding a good agreement with data for
high ST .
172 CHAPTER 8. COMBINED RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
8.2.5 Jet Rapidity
Figures 8.10 and 8.11 present the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurement as a function of
leading jet and second-leading jet rapidity in events with at least one and at
least two jets respectively. In the region of low rapidity (below 2.5), a very
good agreement is observed between the data and both the SHERPA and
BLACKHAT+SHERPA predictions, while the data favours ALPGEN less in
this region.
Figure 7.3 in Section 7.1 shows that there is a very large disagreement
between ALPGEN and SHERPA predictions of leading jet rapidity in the
region of high rapidity. This large discrepancy is attributable to differences in
the PDF set used. While the uncertainty on the PDF is cancelled in the ratio,
the effect of the difference between PDF sets for the ratio measurement, as
a function of leading jet rapidity, is large at high rapidity. This is illustrated
in Figure 8.12 which shows MCFM predictions for the leading jet rapidity
ratio measurement, obtained with different PDF sets. As mentioned earlier,
SHERPA employs a next-to-leading order PDF (CT10) whereas ALPGEN
uses a leading order PDF (CTEQ6L). Leading order PDFs are not particularly
reliable when probing the region of large longitudinal momentum fraction (x)
considered when high rapidity jets are observed. Therefore, a large discrepancy
between ALPGEN and SHERPA is to be expected in this region.
For Figure 8.10, at high rapidity (between 2.5-4.4), ALPGEN provides a
poor description of the data in the electron channel, whereas SHERPA de-
scribes the data well. In the muon channel, ALPGEN overestimates the data
in the high rapidity region but not as significantly as in the electron chan-
nel. SHERPA exhibits a significant underestimation of the muon channel data
which is also manifest in the combined ratio measurement. It should be noted
that although the electron and muon channels show different trends when
compared with theory in the high rapidity region, the data measurements
are compatible within errors. From Figure 8.11, similar observations can be

made about the ALPGEN and SHERPA description of the electron channel.
However, here we observe a much better overall agreement between data and
predictions for the combined ratio result.
8.2.6 Di-jet Variables
The final set of variables measured were those pertaining to the topology and
invariant mass of the two leading jets (in PT ) in events with at least two jets.
This subset are termed di-jet variables, here the ratio results are presented
as a function of the angular distance, Rj1,j2 =
(j1,j2)
2 + (j1,j2)
2, the
separation in azimuthal angle, j1,j2 , and invariant mass, Mj1,j2 , of the two
leading jets in an event. The W+jets
Z+jets
ratio results for the di-jet variables are
shown in Figures 8.13 and 8.14.
For the ratio as a function of Rj1,j2 , the predictions provided by ALPGEN,
SHERPA and BLACKHAT+SHERPA exhibit no major shape differences be-
tween each other and mostly agree well with the data. The exception is in
the low Rj1,j2 region of the spectrum where a large discrepancy with data
is observed, this is driven by the electron channel. This analysis is primarily
concerned with the behaviour of perturbative QCD calculations, therefore the
low Rj1,j2 region is not of particular interest since non-perturbative effects
are important here and are not expected to cancel in the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio. The
non-perturbative contribution in this region is attributed to the fact that jets
that are close together are more likely to be produced from softer radiation
such as gluon splitting in the parton shower. Furthermore, such effects are not
expected to cancel since the difference in mass between the W and Z bosons
results in softer and broader jets in the low kinematic region of W+jets events
than in the same region of Z+jets events.
The angular separation in  is shown in Figure 8.14. Unlike the Rj1,j2
distribution, a large systematic discrepancy between data and all predictions
at low values of j1,j2 is not observed. This is because two jets that are

close in  may be well separated in rapidity and thus not necessarily have a
small value of Rj1,j2 . However, large discrepancies are observed between the
data distribution and all predictions. Figure 8.15 gives a comparison between
the theory predictions provided by ALPGEN and SHERPA for j1,j2 which
clearly shows that jets are less separated in j1,j2 in the SHERPA predictions
than in those provided by ALPGEN, and that this effect is more pronounced
for Z+jets events.
For the invariant mass of the two leading jets, also shown in Figure 8.14,
all predictions overestimate the data in the region below approximately 40
GeV. Above around 80 GeV there is agreement with data, apart from an
upward trend in all predictions at approximately 500 GeV which is most likely
attributable to a data fluctuation.

Chapter 9
Conclusion
A W+jets
Z+jets
ratio measurement has been performed of the cross-section for hadronic
jets produced in association with W and Z vector bosons. The analysis used 4.6
fb1 of data acquired by the ATLAS detector during proton-proton collisions
at the LHC, with a centre of mass energy
s=7 TeV. It has been demonstrated
that the ratio measurement is sensitive to the differences between W+jets and
Z+jets events, and that many systematic uncertainties on W+jets and Z+jets
measurements are significantly reduced in the ratio. The cancellation of many
non-perturbative effect such as those from hadronisation and multiple-parton
interactions allow the ratio to provide a robust and sensitive test of theoret-
ical predictions for perturbative QCD processes. The understanding of such
processes is crucial for the future success of the ATLAS physics programme.
The measurement was performed in two separate lepton channels: for vec-
tor bosons decaying to electrons and muons. In each case, background pro-
cesses were characterised by a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and
data-driven techniques. The latter approach was taken for the understanding
of multi-jet QCD backgrounds and those from semileptonic top decay. Fol-
lowing the subtraction of background processes, each channel was separately
unfolded to particle level before being combined via a 2 minimisation tech-
nique.
180 CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSION
The combined ratio measurements have been compared to theoretical pre-
dictions for perturbative QCD, arrived at from fixed order next-to-leading
order calculations and high multiplicity leading-order matrix element calcu-
lations, matched to parton shower. The former were provided by BLACK-
HAT+SHERPA, the latter by ALPGEN+HERWIG and SHERPA Monte Carlo
simulations.
The cross-section of the W+jets
Z+jets
ratio has been presented as a function of
inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicity up to four jets. Differential cross-section
W+jets
Z+jets
ratios were also presented as a function of the transverse momentum
and rapidity of jets in the final state, of the scalar sum of all jet transverse
momentum in an event, and of di-jet variables pertaining to the kinematics
of the two leading jets. The ability of the various predictions to provide an
accurate description of data in various kinematic regimes has been discussed.
To conclude, the advent of the LHC, and the unprecedented energies at
which it is designed to operate, presents an extremely fertile hunting ground for
hitherto undiscovered physics. Testament to this statement was the discovery
of the Higgs boson in July 2012. Faced with the requirement of increasingly
accurate theoretical predictions to describe perturbative QCD in the LHC
environment, measurements to highlight the successes and failings of state-of-
the-art predictions must be performed. The work presented in this thesis is
one such measurement.
